Do they really expect us to believe Biden is the one tweeting these tweets because I know this is how the PR team is moving rn
when is Biden going to announce his VP
Hilarious... Biden didn't write this apology!! He doesn't even remember giving the speech!!! ü§£ü§£ü§£
I am Joe Biden and I approve this message.
Yeah, so no. You have a choice between Trump or Biden period. Pathetic if you would even remotely consider to vote for Trump or 3rd party.
If opposed by someone who knows what they are doing (Trump) and not someone who is courting their vote (Biden), or any other sorry-ass Democrat.
Whine whine whine me me me, you all know the world circles around me so I never have to shut up with the crazy talk, never.  I have no idea how good a debater Joe Biden, he‚Äôs going to eat my lunch.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait....  Is Biden incompetent and feeble  OR  Is he powerful enough to hurt God  Which is it????
As person who prefers Republicans to democrats but likes Biden (the person) more than trump and sees both parties paying less attention to people with my views, I feel the only way I can make my voice heard is voting for someone else.
I'm waiting to order my  gear til he announced his VP so I can have both names on my bumper sticker, hat, and shirt.  Please Joe make it #BidenHarris2020 Biden/Harris!
Biden‚Äôs dad, a car salesman, traded in Joe‚Äôs old car and his wife‚Äôs car for the corvette as a wedding gift to them in 1966.
Can You Drive?   #Biden
Leftists want him to be president. If he debates trump it would be for entertainment purposes. It would be funny with what joe Biden says.
Biden leads Trump by nearly 40 points in California: poll   California must have the highest percentage of idiots of any state in the union!
Remember! If you voted for trump last time and now vote for Biden it‚Äôs like +2 for Biden! We need more Republicans to switch!
NO Biden was the vice prez.
Anyone who thinks Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate Trump should google up some earlier Biden debates, he might be best debater in my lifetime.
Biden will eat Trumps lunch in a debate, he is a great debater &amp; he‚Äôll call Trumps lies out, while Trump still has the floor.  Biden is knowledgeable on history, military, trade agreements, he can talk details &amp; defuse untruths
Biden scraps plans to travel to Milwaukee for nomination acceptance, citing coronavirus concerns, the White House is not a Nursing home he needs to scrap the White House plan and move into a memory care unit.
Probally a biden fan
I would watch what you say about Biden being a demented buffoon... Cause we all know you are beating the world in covid - 19.  Best ever, never seen before, simply amazing... I have been saying it wrong my whole life.
And now, some good news:   Trump approval back to 51% and supporters 70% more enthusiastic than Biden‚Äôs
Cover for Biden
Lol You will have to support the VP because Joe Biden is not capable of running a country he‚Äôs barely capable of being a nursing home and when you‚Äôre talking about life or death if you‚Äôre talking about Covid then why what is there no social distancing At this funeral
Vote for Joe Biden so you too can sniff children together #VoteTrump2020
I‚Äôm sure working with two big time segregationists was merely a coincidence as well ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden is a racist and a sexual predator haha but you keep calling him decent. Please do your research before you call Biden decent. Ask the hundreds of thousands of people who were victims of his mass incarceration bill how decent he is...just stop man!!
I honestly have no preference in this election. Much like in 2016, it proves the two party system is the biggest flaw in our political system. Trump is terrible, and Biden is a joke as well so I will probably vote for the 3rd party candidate again ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden slams Trump, McConnell for 'political games' with further coronavirus aid  via
His grandchild that Hunter had out of wed-lock but denied could have possibly helped him, but I‚Äôll bet he has never seen her once! Just some low-class trash that should have been aborted. Joe ‚ÄúArchie Bunker‚Äù Biden for President. As for me, I‚Äôll vote to keep what I have.
One would think that being in office for 8 years would have given him the opportunity to do this.  I‚Äôm sure Biden widen will make it happen... oh wait he was a Senator for 37 years.
There is no world where Biden is ahead of/even with Cooper.
Liberal democrats! See what you get by with if Biden gets elected!
He was a Dem his whole carreer and was highest ranking senator prior to his death (Biden spoke at his funeral)...  He voted NAY on the 1964 civil rights act (vote roll pictured below)...
This is only because he thinks he may lose. Any time he's behind in the polls, he calls it fake news. Should Biden win, we all know he's going to claim the polls were rigged. It's like he can't accept fault in any way, shape, and/or form.
But see, Democrats can do that because they aren‚Äôt racist like Republicans. And he‚Äôs excused for everything else he has said and done that was racist in his past because he is Democrat. Yeah, that Barak is certainly a clean and well-spoken black. Joe ‚ÄúArchie Bunker‚Äù Biden.
I see. I think November will be a lose/lose for our country. Sleepy Joe is a joke. Trump thrives off this power which isn‚Äôt what you want. Narcissistic af. Starts shit. Atleast he‚Äôs mentally aware tho. Biden 4 prez is elder abuse at this point
And if Biden wins you get to live in a Communist Country and live in a city looking like Portland does now. You want be able to piss unless the government allows you.
All kanye tryna do is steal the black vote from Joe Biden üíØhe ain't got me fooledHarris is a sellout. She chastised Biden in the debates for his segregationism and now supports him. Proof democrats don't care about America. They care about power and control... and #BidenIsARacist
Come on man. No one believes your malarkey. Long history of #JoeBidenIsRacist
Even lefty Snopes says it true #BidenIsARacist
I don't understand why people think Trump is going to walk away with the debates. Yes, Biden struggled to put two sentences together but so does Trump.
I saw the same thing yesterday but his name was Joe Biden!
Naw, you can't unsay racist comments. Any apology would be any empty attempt to save face. Biden's record and comments are decades long and further enlightens the fact that #BidenIsARacist.
I have a feeling they‚Äôre going to swap Biden out or put in a VP that can hold their salt. Watch for a celebrity or a strong minority leader. They always know how to tug on the heart strings to get votes.
nope.
has been and always will be #BidenIsARacist
When Vice President and Presidential Nominee Joe Biden says ‚ÄúJunkie‚Äù it further calls for why #LanguageMatters and why each of us should pick up a shovel and treat the soil and environment we live in.
This article is beeeeeeeee esssssssss. Biden could have a houseplant for a running mate and he would still get my vote.
Unscripted  shows his true colors.
Not Joe.
He fumbled it decades ago...
back peddle this #JimCrowJoe
Trump is definitely spiraling downward when has has to accuse Biden of doing something to hurt the almighty something that the orange Cheeto head does regularly.
There‚Äôs plenty of qualified, amazing female in this country; anyone would do an amazing job as VP.   And (mandatory joke) Biden has binders full of them (Badum, Tssssss! ducks for cover)
So Joe Biden is a level 20 dnd character!
Oh, come on man. Tell folks about this.
Military mom &amp; educator,  will give the keynote address at the  volunteer leadership conference, Gun Sense University this Sunday!   Sign up to get an email reminder to watch with me:  #GSU2020 #TeamJoe
You wanted me to say one thing about Biden that didn‚Äôt mention Trump so I mentioned the one thing Biden is that Trump isn‚Äôt: he‚Äôs a good person.
Trump is trash for a million other reasons. He‚Äôs an idiot, too, but I used his issues with the word Yosemite as an example. Just the most recent one. I want Biden as president for one reason only: he‚Äôs going to beat Trump in November
Joe Biden is a good, decent man. There.
Trump is a pathological liar. And an absolute moron. I‚Äôd be more confident in Joe Biden 100%. Was he my first choice in primaries? No. Is he the obvious choice for the soul of our Democracy in November? 1000% yes. Trump is an embarrassment. An all-time loser on a historical level
Wrong.
Biden standing up going into WH with 22 point lead.  With his woman of color VP pick he will have a 35 point lead....Joe is in the coasting mode.
Biden should have never committed himself to a women. Doing so boxed him into picking a women of color.
Guess you want a racist in the WH.
Kamala Harris, Karen Bass, Susan Rice, and Elizabeth Warren are all bad picks imo but if I was Biden and I would gamble with Susan Rice
I still think Keisha Bottoms and Amy Klobuchar were the two best VP picks for Biden
Okay man. Whatever. Read the article. Don‚Äôt read the article. Believe it. Don‚Äôt believe it. Muh Trump. Muh Biden. We get it.
You will see a broken country if Biden wins.
Biden knows more about roaches and kids jumping on his lap than he does about COVID-19. Keep the record player on at night there Joe.
Black America suffered from you failed leadership.
Yelp...and Joe Biden has been in Washington for 50 years, tell us what he's done for America.
Um, him and his boy Obama put kids in cages.
Nothing. He hasn't for 50 years.
The most common reason is that they want to vote for Biden because they believe that‚Äôs the most likely way to prevent Trump from having a second term. Secondary to that is they dislike elements of the libertarian platform. Their preferred candidate was typically Elizabeth Warren.
On Biden's short list.  #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
If the democrats floated out a mop in a bucket as Trump's opposition, I would vote for that combo. I don't think Biden is more than a one term president.   5. Last reason, Biden isn't a whiny bitch looking for adoration and validation.  #DumpTrump2020 /end
I can't give a definitive on what Biden is or is proposing to do while in office. I can tell you what he is not.  1. He is not Trump.  2. He is not an intentional racist. 3. He is not under investigation from multiple authorities for crimes committed. 1/?
No Matter What Happens, Joe Biden Can't Slither Out of Debating Trump
Wow, in the debates she blasts him for this. Now she wants him to win. This is typical of democrats. The don't believe in anything, definitely not America.
I have a dime on the person being VP pick who Biden secretly told he would make his VP in 2016 if he ran. She speaks to him regularly on policy. She polls as swaying the most undecideds. She has coathoured opeds w him and had the most $ raised for him.
So you're saying you want a known racist to be President, gotcha.
Biden Announces $775B Plan to Boost the Caregiver Economy, Support In-Home Care Providers

Maybe this where you should spend your energy instead of working against VP Biden and stating there is no difference in Trump and VP Biden.  Learn how to be a graceful loser maybe you learn how to win over more people for your candidate.
Is that your car or mine? - Joe Biden
Of course Biden plans to tax the crap out of  and  if he's elected.  also.
Biden is the systemic racist that has done ANYTHING good for race relations in 50. #WakeUpAmerica
then you don't want Biden.
I truly believe that. I can‚Äôt believe we are about to have such a crucial election without debates. All Biden is doing is showing his lying commercials and allowing the Democratic Party to fuel more lies and do everything they can to destroy our country.
Joe Biden is going to throttle you at the polls. Prepare for a good old fashioned thumping, loser!
Lemme start some thing.... Biden is a complete shit show, gov. Cooper Is a complete fuck tard. This whole pandemic could be fixed so easily. Black lives will always matter, NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK! Trump has done more for minorities them Obama did. The Media in the USA sucks!!!!

As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals.
I would love to see Dr. Rice who served Pres. Obama and Vice-Pres. Biden.
Bill Clinton is 4 years younger than Joe Biden.
The Mayor of Atlanta is still the best VP pick for Biden
I'm sure the Biden folks really like me. LOL
Sure thing....has soon as America prosecutes Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, McCabe, Peter Strzok, Clapper, Brennan, and James Comey.  John Durham's got facts and evidence against these Democrat crooks and all Democrats have against Trump is accusations.
No way Trump can win, Joe Biden has a 22 point lead and he's coasting to the WH...regardless of his VP pick.
Joe Biden is awesome. He can do more from a basement than fatass wandering aimlessly around photo-ops.
Suicide bombers, the use of human shields, gays thrown off buildings, women being stoned to death, little girls being disfigured by acid for wanting an education, women imprisoned for being gang raped, honor killings, soldiers set on fire in cages.
I‚Äôm definitely with Biden and he will make a good president. Can‚Äôt wait to see his VP pick!!
No he does not. In fact one can argue that Biden is more responsible than any other politician left or right for mass incarcerations. His crime bill that he pushed for was extremely draconian. Research it, even Reagan was against it and Biden pushed it
This is what happened in marxist America, in Biden‚Äôs America. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica

With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has announced he will choose his running mate next week.
Guys seriously where is Trumps version of Joe Biden? Can we please elect that version of Joe Biden? Like I will do some very questionable and unethical shit for that version of Joe Biden. Meanwhile in reality our two choices are an establishment Dem and Putin‚Äôs bottom bitchChip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
constantly lies about EVERYTHING and  stays silent.  Biden makes speaking "gaffe" and
You can't be a devout Catholic (Biden) &amp; be a liberal Democrat. It's HIPOCRISY if you believe in ABORTION.
Think its pretty obvious Biden looks down on the Black community
Whatever you say CW.  Should I assume that since you support Biden, you enjoy sniffing little girls hair?  If you don't agree with CW, you ain't black?  Keep painting with your broad brush.
This article is so irresponsible. Trump is dangerous and mentally unfit, and there is no one that Biden could pick as his VP that would in any way shape or form justify not voting for him over Trump.
Is it better? Biden‚Äôs age is the reason everyone is stressing his VP. Normally it‚Äôs to satisfy a large demographic, in this case, it‚Äôs really to step in and become President when the time arises. Who he chooses will decide the Presidency!
I see many voters sitting this 1 out. Biden‚Äôs whole campaign is ‚Äú I‚Äôm not Trump! ‚Äú Biden turns 78 in Nov. I wouldn‚Äôt want a 78 yr. old driving me in a car, much less running the country! There will be backlash, but Dems need to blame themselves! They had 4 years to groom a champ!
The left uses every trick in the book to keep Biden off that stage with Trump! They come up with every lie and excuse to keep him away from Trump!  Biden is mentally impaired...America isn't fooled! Biden smells of fear!
What are you complaining about Joe Biden things black Americans don't think but all the same
Yeah Joe Biden is nothing but a puppet
Imagine we pay for flying this creature everywhere,  hi auto, his advance team, his secret service team, the 2 other planes w nuclear codes and backup. All to hear him say Biden is hurting God. You racist MF that still support this evil abomination. God bless your hearts
Probably. But, few of us are fundamentally persuadeable, right? Regardless of which party/which candidate we prefer. Like the few % who may vote Biden but might have  voted Trump over Bernie. Which is why the Dems blocked Bernie, but are pushing Biden 2 run on Bernie's views.
Is he talking about Biden or John Lennon?  Either way count me in.
C'mon Eric... why drag  and  on this?  is getting sh-tcanned for 'Darling  (&lt;-- see what I did there?) once Biden announces his VP candidate. And Kayleigh will 3 or 4 Press Secretaries in the past and writing her memoir by then....
Biden: Blacks all think the same way
"I support BLM. I support the removal of the statue of liberty, it represents racism and oppression. If elected president on day 1 I will sign legislation for its immediate removal." Joe Biden     Think about that America, vets.
Not voting for Trump isn‚Äôt the same as supporting Biden. I think privately you do, but why not say it?! It doesn‚Äôt make you less of a conservative to say Joe is the best choice AND the Joe has been an enormous support to you &amp; your family.
Are you kidding me. This will be if Biden get elected.
Where‚Äôs Hiden Biden
While he has not yet endorsed many of the things listed above to avoid upsetting some moderate voters, Biden has promoted giving statehood to DC and banning most assault weapons, both of which had been confined to Bernie and Warren just six months ago.
Usually the challenger is the one asking for more debates.  Trump knows Biden won‚Äôt do a 4th but is just using it for a political hammer.  I think Biden should propose either 6 or 3 debates and watch Trump move in to something else.
That has got to be the most ridiculous statement ever! And creepy Biden for president?? You can not be serious??! He can‚Äôt even form a complete sentence, hows he going to run an entire nation???!!!
I have thought this from the beginning, they have someone waiting in the background. It will not be Biden.
Need to get her on record that she deny Biden propose Logan act to go after Flynn
Purely political. Biden wins and we will be back to normal
I cringe every time Biden speaks.
What did Biden do ? Did he proposed the Logan act to go after Flin?
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : Biden scraps plans to travel to Milwaukee for nomination acceptance, citing coronavirus concerns
Joe Biden is whatever Bernie Sanders tells him to be.
It was painful to watch. Ok, question. Totally off subject. What do you think of Biden not providing more interviews? I think it‚Äôs smart, especially when this dude can drive a news cycle with his incompetence.
Reminder that when Libs get Biden they will actively be working against any systemic change, in essence becoming mask off enemies to real progress, keep that in mind
Hey bro, Republican and Democrats are Persons their both a party. You may like trump but not the republicans. You may like democrats but not Biden.
President Biden should pardon Donald Trump, this way he is reduced to a memory, a distant reminder of when we hated, when we were scared, when we lacked hope and were sick.  When we were divided and were fearful, no more, now hopeful and now turning a new corner, together.
President Biden‚Äôs first course of action:  pardon Donald J Trump.   This way we can move on, relinquishing him and his awful being, his lies, his divisiveness to the footnotes of a bad memory, a miserable experience, hopefully to never be repeated.
President Biden‚Äôs first action should be to pardon Donald Trump.  This will allow our country to move on, forgetting him and his reign of incompetence and division.
President Biden‚Äôs first action should be to grant immunity to Donald Trump.  This will allow country to heal, move on and forget him and his reign of incompetence, division and terror.
gap in feelings toward Biden. Only 57 percent of black registered voters ages 18 to 29 say they have a favorable opinion of Biden. By contrast, 88 percent of black seniors say they view the former vice president favorably, including 72 percent who have a very favorable perception
I think the day after Biden wins the election we should start our general strike and demand all that we have earned and deserve. üî•üî•üî•üåπ
Chris Wallace is the worst. He is a democrat not a Republican. He asked harder questions to Trump that these 2 idiots running for VP with Biden
After Biden is sworn in he will go to the podium and announce he is stepping down and from the tunnel Hillary will take the stage

You‚Äôre nuts if you even remotely think that Biden could run this country....that‚Äôs a joke within itself!!!
But Biden has said almost nothing, as he didn't have to. Trump has been shooting himself in the foot.

Weekend At Biden's!
Then who is she gonna vote for? Howie Hawkins? ‚ÄòCause she definitely isn‚Äôt gonna vote for either Trump or Biden
Biden is a moderate, anf one that wasn't asleep at the wheel when COVID-19 arrived.
Laughing at the truth doesn't make it go away. Aggressive lies don't change reality. Biden is up in ALL polls, often by 15 points.
He knows Biden is taking the suburban Republican "Romney" vote.
The real polls show Biden up by vastly more than Hilary at this point.
That's why I'm voting for Biden.
Every VP has dreams of being President. Hell, Kamala just ran for POTUS! However, she would never undercut Biden once selected as VP.
Biden's going to stop Marxism with a little stutter and a calm demeanorExcept the conspiracy theory that you all expect the Durham report to color doesn‚Äôt make sense on its face. The obama admin spies on Trump‚Äôs campaign only to release none of the info before the election all the while re-opening the one into HRC? And Obama, Biden and Rice knew?
I know that the entire investigation is a political sham and that it will turn up the same obama-Biden killshot that all the other ones have: none.
Leo Terrell: Joe Biden is a racist but gets a free pass because he's a Democrat...never a truer word spoken Leo!  #walkaway
Kanye here to hurt Joe Biden and People of Color who vote for him.  What is wrong with this dude?
This absurd list of "reasons" Rice is the pick makes me more confident that it's Harris. 1) Biden also knows Harris well. 2) For VP, Senate experience matters far more than White House experience. 3) That debate moment was political theater. 4) A misdirect right now makes sense.
The DNC is truly a group of idiots.  1st Hillary, and now Biden?  Hillary being one of the most unlikeable people on the planet and Biden clearly showing Mental Illness.  I don't get it.
Ya, Trump‚Äôs tweet was allll about Kanye, hoping he‚Äôll take votes away from Biden and split the ticket. Which isn‚Äôt racist at all, LOL. Doesn‚Äôt Kaye know he‚Äôs being used?
SE, if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden because of his VP pick after alllll the BS that Trump has done to this country, then you are voting for Trump. Period.  Suck it up and do the right thing. Unbelievable...
What Biden said was IGNORANT, but I‚Äôve seen way too many bad takes. If you are willing to vote for Trump because of what Biden just said, then wait to I show you Trump has been doing for the past three decades üëÄ
1973- the year Joe Biden came to Washington.  47 years with zero accomplishments.   Who in their right mind would vote for a 78 year old who has been in politics for that long??  Not to mention his cognitive decline...
There is no amount of mental gymnastics the Biden campaign can do to explain away this racism. Wow.
I love the show, but your teaser talking about Biden gaffe and not adding Trump with his crazy remarks in OH was inappropriate.
Interesting that Cupp would vote for Biden with Harris but not with Rice. I wonder how many other anti-Trump Republicans agree.  Of course, it's foolish. If you're a Never Trump conservative, it must be because you recognize the existential threat he poses. Vote Biden either way.
I still maintain he didn't actually particularly want to be President and ran as an emergency Biden understudy.
Biden 49 Trump 49
Hypothetical: Rob Portman retires in 2022. President Joe Biden has a national approval rating of around 48 approve/50 disapprove. Republicans decide to nominate Jim Jordan for Senate and Democrats nominate Tim Ryan. Who wins the Senate election?
Thoughts about Biden: 1) I think he'll be a great president. 2) I'm confident he'll surround himself with highly qualified, capable people. 3) I wish he'd think a bit more before he speaks sometimes. 4) He definitely needs a Black woman as his running mate.
Apparently when Joe Biden becomes president a Bill of Rights amendment will be invalidated "immediately and without notice".  This nonsense could be refuted by any D student in a high school civics class.  All Republicans have is scare tactics. Unfortunately, they work.
No democrat is going to take away guns so stop lying to everyone.  And Biden is NOT going to take any guns
They were worried about Trump and the Nuclear Football.   Come on, man' you can't give the Football to Biden.  He might start the apocalypse!
The chryon says you‚Äôre talking about the economy, but all I hear is talk of how Biden is against God. Really? Against God? Ohhhkay, then. And I‚Äôm against Xenu.
God must not be as all powerful as all of the Bible verses say he is.  Or else Biden is really that damn powerful.  Either way, why would ANYONE listen to Donald f‚Äôing Trump about anything that has to do with Christianity?  He‚Äôs the most morally bankrupt man to ever hold office.

Hold up Biden is Lord Asriel???
All Biden had to do was drop out and admit he doesn‚Äôt give a shit about anything besides getting trump out of office.
Joe Biden with the Nuclear Football.    Bidens finger on the the button! I am truly afraid!!!   He could start a Nuclear War while looking for his tapioca pudding.
All I have to say is  and  were right on the mark
The debates with Biden are going to be painful to watch. The gaffes/minute will leave us all with heads in our hands.
Is it wrong of me if I say that Biden should talk less and smile more?
Biden is "against God", says the guy who is all in with Satan.
That is pathetic. Biden/Dead Horse would get my vote, 110%.
The over-70 crowd in my neighborhood is all in on Biden. Shirts, hats and bumper stickers everywhere.
Biden will lose for the following reasons:  1) Limited passion for Joe by his base.  Opposite on the Trump side 2) Civil unrest works against Biden and not for him given the Dem views on policing 3) The Debates: Trump should dominate 4) The cognitive issue  5) AA% inc for Trump
My favorite Trump campaign attack against Biden is still the one that said "we can't risk electing the oldest president ever elected" even though if Trump won he would also be the oldest president ever elected.   It really encapsulates the overall BS of Trumpism.
Biden, so strong he can hurt God!
Between the ‚ÄúBiden hurts God‚Äù and ‚ÄúLatinos are diverse, unlike blacks‚Äù riffs today, really makes you wonder if it‚Äôs time for faithless electors to do their duty.
Just wondering your thoughts on Biden‚Äôs VP pick ...also, tomorrow‚Äôs lottery numbers? #ClaireVoyant #psychichotline
Kamala will probably be spending a lot of time in the Senate, whether she is Biden‚Äôs pick or not
With every such utterance, he shows how much contempt he has for his constituents, not one of whom believes Biden or anyone else can "hurt God."
Biden rockets to victory after arriving to the debate conscious and standing upright
Relax bro, Biden is actually pretty moderate.
Joe Biden is asking for Chic-fil-A level grace
Twitter &amp; Facebook's action on removing Trump's misinformation about covid shows that they DO have the capacity to act swiftly and the appetite for removal.  NOW DO ELECTION MISINFORMATION - per your OWN policies

Trump Team's Dream Pick for Joe Biden's Running Mate: Susan Rice.  üëâTrump will pick her apart like a vulture!! üëà
45's campaign will find something like this (or worse) to spin for each and every one of Biden's potential running mates with a misogynistic cherry on top.
Or diverting our attention from something.  Between the Booms and FBI raids, I think it‚Äôs all pointing to Biden.  I ha e a feeling they are going to nail him up.
If elected president, Joe Biden said he would not tear down the parts of the barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border built by Trump's administration. But he would end construction.  "There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration."
Another item for President Biden‚Äôs to-do list.
Good perspective on the upcoming presidential election.
Chuck Schumer‚Äôs boy  endorsed by Brady and Giffords, gun-grabbing organizations who are putting millions behind Biden‚Äôs candidacy. BUT, Brady and Giffords took COVID PPP funds at taxpayer expense. Oh I forgot Cal, your company did too #2A #VoteTillis
That... is not logical.
Senator Biden seems a bit shaky.
I'm not sure how much to credit this piece, but they say that the campaign's "case for Rice" is that she'll ensure the enthusiastic support of the Obamas. Like Barack and Michelle are gonna sit on their hands and let Trump win regardless of Biden's running mate. Much less Harris.
We will, by voting for Biden!!
I read this on Newsweek though.  I was just making a joke about it.
Biden Is Right. Pay for Home Health Workers Is Paltry. #ncpol   ttps://khn.org/MTE0MjYwOQ via
Here you go that Biden understands what going on in America (with women) much more than Trump. Biden announced in July platform, if elected a $775B Plan to boost the caregiver economy, support In-Home Care Providers
We‚Äôre working on that.  Donate to the Biden campaign, America, and keep organizing to vote Trump out of office.
Spoiler alert: he calls it for Biden! "He Predicted Trump‚Äôs Win in 2016. Now He‚Äôs Ready to Call 2020." Video with his 13 keys to predict presidential wins/losses. Go, Allan!

I'm thinking there's a sizable group of dipshit libs and centrists that are only involved in the blm protests to the extent that it's a repudiation of trump. I won't be surprised if they start telling everyone to shut the fuck up after they get the keys to power when Biden wins.
people are still using March‚Äôs talking points of ‚Äúwell we‚Äôll all vote Green, that‚Äôll show them!!1!1!1!!!!!‚Äù while 92% of non-Twitter Bernie people are already voting Biden.  It‚Äôs like...nobody cares.  nobody knows you exist.  this is unhealthy.  organize locally
Well, Biden‚Äôs camp won‚Äôt have to spend any additional funds generating advertising content after that insane display. #AxiosOnHBO #ResignNowTrump
Actually frankly 20% of the remainder act exactly the same except about "ridin' with biden" and being anti-GMO, so...
I don't have an absolute nope. I'm voting for Biden even if his running mate is a balloon with a face drawn on it in Sharpie.  But of the names being mentioned, Warren is by far the worst pick.
I'll add, in my personal opinion, that I think Biden wants to be seen as more independent of Obama. Choosing an Obama administration official as his highest-profile pick would make it seem like he's not capable of choosing his own people.
reads more like 'any port in a storm' they look like crap, and have nothing substantive to attack Biden with, so they dreamed this up
Biden should definitely not debate. Why bother? He‚Äôd spend the whole time refuting the lying freak show that is Trump.
On Zoom with the church's stockbroker (who is very good). He says we can expect an inflationary bull market with significant volatility over the next 12-18 months. Oh, and Wall Street is betting on a win for Biden in the general election.
Secret Service released Hunter Biden‚Äôs trips he took with security detail while his daddy was VP...he was busy üßê
i know March was a lifetime ago but the goldfish memory thing is still annoying. people said the same thing was going to happen with Biden's one-on-one debate with Sanders
Alright, just to be clear a lot of liberals who would never support positions AD holds were tweeting "What does Angela David know that you don't?" When she publicly endorsed Biden. Fine. This has nothing to do with what she thinks about Avakian or Maoism, it is ab the libs.
Just realized that Biden still has to do debates this fall, and suddenly I don't feel he can amass a polling lead large enough to make me comfortable
Meh. Save your money Trump. We are going to #TurnNCBlue. Biden is up in the polls, and will remain there. Say goodbye to #OneTermThom as  takes his senate seat. #ncpol #ncsen #NorthCarolina
Opinion | Biden‚Äôs Quietly Radical Care Plan  #caregivers    #dementia
What is up with Ed Rendell?  What a misogynist!  Biden would do well to rid himself of this man and Chris Dodd. They are fossils. Dems equivalence of GOP old white men and a bad look for the party.
Conservatives seem skeptical of another poll showing Biden leading in NC, but several major trends are driving the shift in the state.  #NCPOL
Good to know they exist. But I've started having this discussion with various friends around the country. Everybody has seen lots of Trump signs, but when asked, people struggle to recall seeing any Biden signs or materials.
I don‚Äôt understand the strategy behind painting Joe Biden - Joe. Biden. - as some kind of radical leftist. I don‚Äôt know if anyone other than the cultiest of the Trump cultists who will buy this. Joe has been a defined national figure for 40 years. This won‚Äôt work.
NPR just reported on an Ohio poll that shows Biden up only 46-42. We have the electoral college.
Yeah, funny how Biden supporters don‚Äôt stand in large gatherings on roads and highways. Must have something to do with IQ?
Well, at least there are Trump signs around. I live in a very blue part of a swing state, and I've yet to see a single Biden sign, bumper sticker, or any other campaign paraphernalia. We do get slick, substance-free TV ads about how Biden is nicer than Trump.
They already know that Obama knew about the surveillance, who was in that meeting and that Biden was the one that planted the idea of charges for Flynn.  All they are going to corroborate, to have it on record.  Yes, i think she will answer those questions.
Center for Marketing and Opinion Research has Biden +4 in Ohio. (Disclosure: I worked for CMOR as a high school/college student in the summers of 08/09.)
Biden is part of the Washington swamp.  He funneled billions of dollars from China into Rosemont Capital in 2012/14.  Rosemont Capital is owned by Hunter Biden and Christopher Heinz.  Christopher Heinz is John Kerry's stepson.
I'm not as worried as some people are. I think Biden is smart enough to make the right choice.
I said weeks ago. Biden will withdraw. An emergency candidate will be chosen. Guess who.
Hillary is up. Biden is not going to be the nominee.
Weird that Trump is giving such solid reasons to vote for Biden, but I‚Äôll take it.
Oddly enough, Deshanko (Ukraine provided dossier) has to be tied to Soros as well, he worked with the Think Tank.  Which means, Biden is all over this too.  We may not have an election this year!!
Sally Yates goes before the Senate Judiciary Com. 8/5.  Biden appears to be the one that planted the idea of the Logan Act against Flynn.  Igor Deshanko (Ukrainian) worked at Brookings and has strong ties with Fiona Hill.  Mr. VP, you are in trouble...
Donald Trump, did it ever occur to you that a lot of people DON‚ÄôT have money in the bank? How about if you tell us that Biden‚Äôs coming for our yachts?  #TrumpDestroysAmerica
TIL: there exists a ‚ÄúRepublicans for Joe Biden‚Äù
If Barr or Republican Senators/Reps use the propaganda info they received from Ukraine/Russia to smear Biden, is that a violation of FEC rules.

If this wasn't a staged, wouldn't  the Biden supporters be wearing masks?
On FB I posted the meme of Biden and they declared it false...so I then posted the pic of Warren...it was NOT declared false  ü§£üòÇü§£
I‚Äôll bet you a flat $10.00 that Biden wins North Carolina. He will outperform them because the GOP base has dwindled to uneducated white voters in rural areas.
I don‚Äôt think anybody wins North Carolina by 17 points but I do believe Joe Biden would win handily if the election were today. The rapid GOP collapse in the suburbs is one of the more remarkable trends I‚Äôve seen in politics.
The Durham-Barr Origin of Russia investigation has a pre-determined outcome. Barr travelled with Durham to Australia, UK, Ukraine, US states and other places to support the following: that Comey, McCabe, Strozk, Page, Brennan, Clapper, Biden, Obama and maybe Rice and Yates guilty
Yet Trumpers want to make you think it‚Äôs the DEMS who are the racists.  I‚Äôd bet my house this cat ain‚Äôt voting for Biden?  Any takers?
I‚Äôm still looking for Biden to swing it. But I expect Biden to win an old school landslide like we haven‚Äôt seen in this century. ü§û
Listen, Im going to vote for Biden. But it‚Äôs a real ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to everyone who‚Äôs passionate about a younger, more engergized candidate for this to be the primary narrative of the campaign. I‚Äôm worried that ‚Äútrump bad, me good‚Äù won‚Äôt motivate enough turnout from my generation
If you don't vote for Biden, Trump will win. That's just a fact. #Election2020
This post brings up an excellent point: Zombie Joe Biden would be a MUCH cooler candidate
Exactly. A lot of them don't care if Biden wins. They have their sights set on 2024, and to hell with what happens to our country in the meantime.   But they want to be able to say they supported a Black woman so they can tell themselves they're not engaging in misogynoir.
Maybe the delay is because Biden‚Äôs trying to talk Kamala into being his first SCOTUS pick, and she‚Äôs weighing her options. üòÇ  And that‚Äôs why Clyburn‚Äôs suddenly all ‚ÄúSCOTUS is more important than VP...‚Äù  *Yes. I am bored. I do not think any of this is true.
Joe... You had 54 years.  All you did was get rich.  Let's see Hunter Biden's tax records.
Biden is the nominee.  He should choose his VP, not Sanders or Sanders‚Äô adherents.
It doesn't, but it gives them a very distinct advantage, especially in this instance. If Biden has a successful term, it'll be very difficult to defeat his VP. Choosing someone who doesn't want to run would be sacrificing a key advantage in a critical election. Why would he?
We're not fooled by the leftist white supremacists who are naming as acceptable running mates Black women who, even if they were chosen and were able to help Biden win this year's election, wouldn't be likely to run for the presidency in 2024. We see you.
I can't wait until the conventions are over so we can finally be done with the following theories that never made sense to begin with: 1) Biden will be replaced as nominee 2) Biden will choose Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama as running mate 3) Pence will be replaced as VP
I like this shirt because it's a reminder that Harris is proven in the crucial "attack dog" role of the running mate. Most of the other names being mentioned are at best untested.  That role might be more important than ever with Biden leading the ticket.
There are exactly 2 running mate picks Biden could make that would make sense at all: Kamala Harris and Susan Rice.  Of the two, Harris is the better pick for VP.  Rice would be ideal for Secretary of State.  #KamalaHarrisForVP #SusanRiceForSecState  But no matter what happens...
Lots of good lookin‚Äô stuff here!  And will look even better when and if it says Biden/Warren!
I'm not saying it's unprecedented. I'm saying Biden won't do it.
Hey Joe Biden that was a great commercial you did for Muslim Americans.  üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èBut...ummm....I have a question. Why didn't you ask about Christian views or say your administration will have a "voice" for Christians?  #Pandering #Hypocrisy

it feels like the same shit from last year like Biden, there's this recurring obvious theme that it's Harris and no one wants to accept it  like when reporters said Eric Swalwell was running, even though no one knows who that is, even people in his own district
You know what Joe Biden didn‚Äôt do?  He didn‚Äôt cause the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans theough sheer incompetence.  You can‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre dead.  He also didn‚Äôt preside over the largest contraction in GDP in the history of the country and golf through it all.  #GTFO
There's no perfect alternative but I'd rather not select an untested candidate who has past quotes/actions that may hurt in an important swing state (Florida). If Biden wants to pick a Black female House member who isn't a national name, go with Terri Sewell.
I just want to hurry up and order my Biden/Harris Tshirt.
Someone needs to play the Bruno Gianelli kelp speech for the Biden team.
Joe Biden should want to pick an ambitious VP to potentially set up 12 years of mainstream Democratic leadership in the White House. Any advisor who suggests that he shouldn't should be sacked.
When your claim to fame is that you‚Äôre the president‚Äôs son‚Äôs girlfriend, you‚Äôre insignificant. Real moms like Biden. #MomsForBiden
you are an idiot. To compare Trump to Biden?  Really? Voting for anyone other than Biden could re-elect Trump. That‚Äôs what happened in 2016. How‚Äôs that work out for you? Thanks Jill Stein and Bernie Sanders hold outs. You gave us Trump. Don‚Äôt do it again.
I think there‚Äôs so much 3D chess going on that Karen Bass being ‚Äúshort-listed‚Äù is part of a plan to make her Kamala‚Äôs Senate replacement. I mean, she‚Äôs a worthy VP candidate for sure, but Biden adding another CA option doesn‚Äôt make much sense otherwise.
Is it so hard for Biden to announce that he‚Äôd be in favor of a UBI study? That alone would go a long way with progressives... i.e. to vote for him, to fight for him. Upside - they learn, become more receptive; downside - really none, other than the cost of said study.
i‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll just have Biden do another Medium post instead.  That‚Äôs more their speed
The crime bill talking point is so tired. Anyone that‚Äôs actually been following knows that Biden has learned since that racism is much further reaching than he had thought in 1994
I mean, Biden‚Äôs not opting for secret police kidnapping random civilians and won‚Äôt demonize the press for starters
I can assure you, the majority of Americans will vote for Joe Biden.
Guessing they imagine they‚Äôll get through almost all they want in Biden‚Äôs first couple years, then like the ACA, be impossible to really unwind.
Hey  &amp; #SonOfaBunkerBitch  "what about Hunter Biden?"  "Did the Media forget already?"  I guess the biggest GDP drop in history is real news story.  Better start practicing your Prison Skills, daddy ain't going to be President forever #Grifter #VoteBlue

On tomorrow‚Äôs episode of Biden‚Äôs picks: I undoubtedly get called a racist, sexist pig for thinking that Kamala is bad because she kept prisoners incarcerated for their value as cheap labor and threatened poor families with arrest over truancy issues.
Joe Biden has literally been running for president for over 30 years. Fine.  But let a woman move toward the presidency and all of a sudden she's "too ambitious".  Make that make sense.
Every time I hear someone like "What about how Harris attacked Biden in that debate? How will they ever get past that?", I have a sudden urge to give that person a Baby Shark coloring book and a box of crayons.
I'm just gonna put this here again.  Joe Biden is not stupid, and he cares about his legacy.
I live in Chapel Hill. When Biden takes over, please don't let America swing "left" too fast or too far. We need moderate bipartisan leadership.Aren't you all still waiting for hillary to die from your 2016 conspiracy theories? Stick with her before starting new conspiracy theories about biden..
Sure uhhh pervert camera worsen....uhh and another thing did you hear about what Biden did when they asked him to take a cognitive test because not a lot of people know this, and I told them, millions of Americans are talking about this but it's like nobody knows it
Oh and stone talking to Wikileaks and russian intelligence to discuss releasing emails..the list is long of the campaign trying to solicit help from russia..now name one time biden has asked Iran or China to help him win his election..
I'm really a tremendous person, probably the most tremendous since at least, when I took the cognitive test, and I took a cognitive test and of course Biden wouldn't do it but I did it and they said this is incredible nobody does this but i did it.
You may be pushing it with Sarah Palin, but I‚Äôd be good with any of the rest.
Let biden or his campaign ask any foreign government for help with his elections..the minute Biden says something like, China if you are listening,   we'll be onto him as well..most of the world wants normalcy out of USA..doesn't give them the right to meddle in our elections..
Maybe because Biden doesn‚Äôt use Twitter
U.S. Intelligence: China Opposes Trump Reelection; Russia Works Against Biden
Robin Williams' 'rambling' Joe Biden bit resurfaces 11 years later
NOT TRUE. Russia is WAY ahead of China/Iran in their influence of US (and other countries) elections.Everyone knows  Biden isnt WELCOMING help from China/Iran, while Trump has already welcomed Russia's help, even assisting them.
The big difference here is that neither China nor Iran have even a fraction of the influence campaign that Russia have developed: no where near  Biden isnt WELCOMING help from China/Iran.Trump already has and  the Mueller report!
Trump has been very confrontational with Russia for several years now. Why would Russia prefer Biden? China I get. They've already paid the family off. And, Iran would do almost anything to get rid of Trump. This report is pure bullshit.
You do realize that Ivanka Trump got MILLIONS in patents from China when she went on the Presidential visit there last year right, you hypocrite? Hunter Biden didn't work for the Administration........really not the same thing.
At least Joe Biden can clarify his comments!  You, on the other hand, distract and blame others for your failings and blatant bigotry.  #CENTRALPARK5 #FAIRHOUSING  #THEBLACKS
Biden could tell black jokes and the MSM would explain the punchline.
That was put up when Obama and Biden
Counterintelligence chief: Russia aiming to ‚Äúdenigrate‚Äù Biden ahead of election
Biden is done.  Wait for the first debate.  Trump will get under his skin and totally get him off the teleprompter.  It will be for great comedy
I need this sign to go with my eventual Biden/? sign.  Drive the Trumpers crazy on my block.
Bet Biden only tried to stop Russia.
Sweetie we settled for Joe Biden.... That should be enough.
If the Biden Justice Department won‚Äôt prosecute, he should speak up now so another candidate can be nominated.
Everyone should vote NOW.  Biden has already agreed to the debate schedule and Trump has not. Biden released his tax returns. Do you think Trump will release his tax returns before this debate?  Lots of people are saying Trump and Deutche Bank are under criminal investigation.
Please don‚Äôt vote green in 2020. I love their platform but we need every vote we can get to go to Biden so we can prevent Trump from being re-elected. At this point, as much as I hate to say it, it really is the lesser of two evils. #SettleForBiden
and any Democratic idea of a black bailout should never and never have been tolerated.   worth repeating James' words on the day, as predicted, Biden issues an apology. #Biden2020
Sounds kinda like how many people don't like Biden or Trump but they just settle for one of those two anyway.... also terrifying.

Folks are really out here ripping Biden for this. All the while, Kanye is OPENLY conspiring with the Trump campaign in an attempt to "split the black vote" because they actually believe "black people will vote for the black guy..."
I am so tired of the text and email begging for money.  It's not just the Biden campaign it's everyone running plus the DNC.  I get emails from Nancy Pelosi saying Maria I beg you.......lol JFC I'm ready to delete my email
Joe Biden was absolutely correct. Hispanic and Latino people come from many countries, including the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. A majority of African Americans descend from a few countries on the West Coast of Africa. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.
Maybe not but it could mean that we get someone like Come on Man Biden !! Hey guess what Meg , we can‚Äôt go for that , NO!!
The big story here is that Biden can't keep his messaging straight between the image of America his team gets from polls, and the image of America he's supposed to present as a candidate. Imagine if Obama said "as you know, 78% of Latinos support X policy"
Stop it , there is no comparing the two. Trump can get up in front of a crowd and give a two hour speech with no notes. Biden can't even get a sentence out with notes.
Biden supports legalizing abortions for women that want them. Trump bans women fleeing forced abortions from entering the United States.  I understand many Catholics are upset with the former, but why are you ok with the later.
Let me guess, one of the notable exceptions is Barack Obama. The man who Biden describes as ‚ÄúThe first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,"
Yes, compared to, say, the Pope Biden isn't very religious.  He's not running against the Pope. He's running against someone who fucked a porn star while his wife was at home with a baby and who brags how he can get away with sexual assault.
At least you're honest. ;-)  The choice is between Trump and Biden. I'll take Biden and see where we are in 4 years instead of Trump continuing to burn down the nation and wipe his arse with the Constitution.
They don't have work very hard for Team Pete.  We made it extremely easy for the Biden campaign from the day Pete dropped out.  That's why it better to expect nothing from them.  The only thing they should expect from me is my vote.
Y‚Äôall just want voters to die if it means putting Biden in who is the same as trump lol
I bet you believed Hillary was sick and going to die in 2016..well we have been through all of trump's playbooks..we are not gullible like the Trump University students or helpless like the cancer kids he stole money from..get to biden once you're out of conspiracies on Hillary.
Well, let me embarrassingly admit I'm holding near max NO on Rice and "over-paid" by an average of 8 cents, so if Biden's crew is doing this I know someone high up in the campaign and will submit a reimbursement claim.
Thing is Biden totally could have talked about the diversity of the latinx community, without adding the insulting remark about the black community. C‚Äômon man...
I'm voting Libertarian, because apparently only Libertarians get three votes this year: a vote for Jorgensen, a vote for Trump, AND a vote for Biden all as t once.

Correct. Anyone on the right would‚Äôve had their career destroyed by this.  However, this is a distraction:   Biden is so fuddled that he can‚Äôt recognize softball questions from friendlies. His reaction was to get angry and attack.  Imagine him doing this with Xi or Putin.

Who voted for Biden? Was he not voted as the nominee defeating Bernie in state after state with his wide support base among suburban populations and overwhelming black support for his record as VP under obama..
You can complain that Biden isn't the most religious person, but compared to Donald Trump...
2016 you wrote someone in and Trump won. You're "100%" against Trump yet are considering a write-in again depending on Biden's VP pick? Nonsense! Liberals respect the Constitution, the rule of law, fiscal responsibility, national security interests, free speech and a free press
Accept that Bernie didn't have popular support and move on..biden won with his suburban base and his popularity with the black communities based on his record as VP under Obama..there's no reason to blame anyone..bernie's message did not resonate with people..i wish it had..
Has Biden said he will take away people's guns? I remember the same thing said about Obama and nobody took anyone's guns
BTW they have all thrown each other under the bus to save Biden and Obama.  But ur right the GOP have zero balls to actually do something about it.
If Biden were to pick #SarahPalin for #VP, would you vote for #Trump??  ü§£
He is a racist. He is telling you who he is.....
It's more likely than not Biden picked a VP weeks ago &amp; the timing of an announcement is to maximize its' effect.  This is politics performance art. VP announcements since late 80's are with 1 exception announced 2-3 days prior to convention. Ya think all prez just can't decide?
That and just calling it a hoax. Biden says he will accept nomination in his home state, so Trump comes back and says  He might use the WH. How appropriate. Looking for any advantage even if by association
Earlier this week,   launched his Agenda for the Latino Community. The Latino community is a core part of the American community &amp; our contributions are evident in every part of society. I was delighted to join other NC Leaders &amp; praise Biden's bold agenda. #ncpol
Obama got all the other centrist contenders to drop out and endorse Biden. That's not a conspiracy.
Yo, America can have Biden problems or Trump problems. Your choice. But if that fraudulent pig gets re-elected Biden problems will fit into a teacup compared to the monstrosities Trump has in store ‚Äúfor‚Äù America over the next four years.
Truer words probably have never been spoken in the history of American presidential elections: "I am going to beat #JoeBIden!' -- said by none other than Joe Biden! himself. #CNBC
Due to Biden's mental decline, the VP pick is critical. The VP will likely be running the show from early on. That's one reason Dubya kept Cheney around. The other reason was that he and his neocon buddies had him by the balls. I'd hope for better this time.

Are you slow? Biden said all black people are the same.
Wake up AMERICA, you cannot take this man seriously. God help us all if you do. Vote, BIDEN in November.
I don't give two shits if Biden or Trump are religious. This is not an argument I care about. Show me which one believes in science.
Fuck You...!!!...I‚Äôm still Ridin with Biden...!!!
they won't after they saw what you did to Trump.  Biden is in worse shape when it's non scripted questions.
Biden's gonna get at least 90% of the Black vote, folks. These "gaffes" don't change anything. Any Dem nominee for President is guaranteed to win at least 90% of the Black vote these days.
I think she was a perfect spokesperson for Bernie. Did you see her on "The Breakfast Club"? I disagree with her about Joe Biden, but ONLY because Trump is killing us by the thousands. ANYONE would be lucky to have her on their team.
Vote Biden and this will be the norm. And you won‚Äôt have guns to protect yourself. #Trump2020NowMoreThenEver
Love it. Now if we could get Biden to keep his mouth shut and quit giving Trump ammo...
It‚Äôs a virus. Unless he has a magic wand, there‚Äôs nothing more our President could have done. Hillary, Obama, or Biden‚Äôs actions would‚Äôve been similar, if not identical. You deranged, TDS infected libs are so far gone, you‚Äôve lost all sense of reality.
Bollier is winning 18% of Republicans and has a 45-29 advantage with independents.  Trump leads Biden only 50-43. That would be the largest share of the vote for a Democratic candidate in Kansas since 1976:
Joe Biden, the gif that keeps on giffing
Trump says Biden will "hurt God." If anything hurts God, it's a leader who has allowed 160,000 to die without a shred of compassion. It's children taken from the arms of their parents and put into dog kennels. It's someone trying to take away healthcare in a pandemic.  #JesusWept

Nobody liked Tim Kaine. At the time, it was widely regarded as a bad and confusing choice. Biden will almost certainly pick a bad VP as well. It is what it is. Democrats are idiots
Ah yes, the primaries, where Biden‚Äôs support was clearly driven by his policy stances and not by an elite/media narrative around ‚Äúelectability‚Äù
-You, a hater, in 2011: ‚ÄúChristian, why are taking multiple undergrad classes on philosophy of religion? When will those topics ever be relevant?‚Äù  -Trump, 2020, probably: ‚ÄúJoe Biden is mailing glitter bombs to God‚Äôs house. It‚Äôs getting in God‚Äôs eyes and it hurts God real bad.‚Äù
I guess Biden‚Äôs one of those people who think that all blacks look alike.
While this may be correct, I feel quite sure this criticism of Trump is in response to his recent rantings about Biden. You know the old saying - pot calling the kettle black. Biden has made word errors and has stuttered thru speeches, however doesn't dis Trump on his gafs.
Why did Trump make attack ad of Biden praying ???
At a debate, Biden should just lob quotes and verses from the Bible at every chance and challenge Trump to do the same.  The emperor has no clothes.
If Biden looses the election, it will be because of his own big mouth.  What a disaster.
Russian troll farms are actively working to convince progressive Dems not to vote for Biden and some are actually falling for it. HELLO? Did you see what happened in 2016? Getting played once might be excusable, but twice? This would be your OWN damn fault. Don't be dumb! #ncpol
You Ain‚Äôt Black didn‚Äôt hurt Biden and this won‚Äôt either... Taking the side of police over black lives does matter however... When you call black protesters anarchists that matters Trump
Trump picked the wrong subject here. I have met VP Biden many times and worked with his son Beau on a charity project.  He is as decent, kind and sincere as they come. And his faith is an integral part of him. Trump is no match for this man. #Biden2020
Who's the Bully...a reporter challenges Biden about his mental state and Biden accuses him of being on cocaine...anytime Biden gets a tough question which is rare... he bullys the reporter
Biden must pardon this man on Inauguration Day.

Remember when Trump ran from debates with Hillary.   He is desperate. We know him and we know Biden. Debates are a waste of time at this point.

Trump was wealthy before he became President. How about Obama and Clinton and Biden and Pelosi and Feinstein. And don‚Äôt get me started on Sharpton and Jackson.
The DNC is a spectacle, not a policy conference. She's one of the three most visible and culturally relevant politicians in the country and she's particularly popular among young &amp; left-leaning people, two blocs Biden needs even more in states like WI where the margin is narrow.
True (he‚Äôs been at like 1%), but GOP help is cynical &amp; even 1% could alter history if it came mostly out of Biden‚Äôs pocket (I don‚Äôt think it will).
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?
It‚Äôs so adorable to see my republican friends call people idiots for considering a Biden vote because ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt even put together a coherent sentence‚Äù as if Trump is poet laureate of 2020.
Although you also have Bernie and Warren speaking, which makes me think this is as much about not giving AOC a leg up on some of the other future party leaders as not wanting Biden to be outdone (nearly everyone will ‚Äúoutdo‚Äù Biden)
Again...it‚Äôs a plan to take away votes from Biden. Don‚Äôt fall for it.
Waiting for Joe Biden's VP pick is like waiting for a toddler to put on their shoes. It's like... I can just do it for you, please let me. We have places to be.

First off I said more than likely. 2nd off, Trump has shown me he‚Äôs detrimental to the country. At the very least, Biden is someone new.

Eric, great sharing of Robin Williams on Joe Biden!!  Thanks!

Joe Biden is Racist AF. He‚Äôs been like that his whole life, he only gets away with it Because he‚Äôs a Democrat. I‚Äôm sick of it.
The problem is will the Dems and the non-Caucasian community still be enough to vote him into office.  If so, Biden really knew what he was saying.
JFC, do you not watch Pelosi and Biden? Those two buffoons can‚Äôt pronounce cat. GTFOH, can you people possibly be more petty??
Biden should insist that Trump debate Kanye first
Just saying universal health care, especially given vulnerabilities exposed by a global pandemic is wildly popular and Biden's continued opposition to it is suicidally stubborn. If he took a stand for something 69% of America and 88% of Democrats want, it would help.

"THEN JOE BIDEN EITHER IS GOD OR CAN HURT GOD, AND I DO NOT CARE IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE"  -  2020
When asked if he could "hurt God" as his opponent alleged, Joe Biden shoved back one sleeve and said, "You're darn skippy. I'd give him the ol' one-two, straight in the pucker, just like on the corner back in my shoeshine days. We didn't take no guff or malarkey, deity or not."

Is there anyone Biden could pick that would make you reconsider? Like I don't even particularly like Biden but he could pick Ted Cruz as his running mate and I'd still be like, "Well, shit, still gotta do this because it's not literally the worst option possible."

You misunderstood, understandably, but you'll get it if you take a minute. He's talking about a "landslide" election in which Biden is flipping states (red-to-blue). Those states are ranked by probability of a win (even if &lt;50%). Big drop in prob after TX. AK next most prob flip.
One of the most annoying parts about this whole Biden will ‚Äúhurt g-d‚Äù speech is that trump shouldn‚Äôt even be bringing religion or g-d into this. It has nothing to do with politics at all. We‚Äôve strayed way too far from separation of church and state

I can only assume that Biden car video is him endorsing The Onion as his speech writers/election strategists.
It's a considerable stretch from "Joe Biden will be a puppet controlled entirely by AOC" to "Joe Biden is powerful enough to physically harm the Lord."
"Yeah, I was going to vote for Biden because Trump is a narcissistic insane person who is wholly unfit to govern, but then I found out he was going to nominate Val Demings as VP and I'm just not so sure anymore..."
Even then, at least the Trump would be VP instead of President. I would still vote for Biden, but also be his personal bodyguard and ensure he survives the term so the VP can't take over. üòÇ
This reminds me of that Wonder Showzen bit where the kids meet god and eat him. Now I'm laughing picturing Joe Biden with bbq sauce all over his face with that stupid grin
Joe Biden needs to start punting on first down. Just say nothing man. No more Interviews.
He's set the bar so low for Biden that during the debates Biden just has to show up. If I was advising Trump I'd tell him to drop the cognitive decline attacks. It just calls attention to his tenuous grasp of things.
I think we can explore the differences. The goal of exploring those differences should be to find common ground though. We already agree fuck Biden. So let's use it as a starting point to bring together African Americans and latines who agree with that
Idk where these people get off with their "Trump is the worst president ever but if Biden doesn't satisfy my very arbitrary desires I guess it's a wash" bullshit.
Clinton was out reminding people why they hate her for months by this time. Biden's hidin'. That's not going to help his numbers.    1st week of 11/16 you were saying Hispanic support for Clinton was up. Trump outperformed  McCain and has higher support with minorities NOW.
Joe Biden wants to hurt God?  How is it possible Trump has one single supporter. HOW!!!!
You're either voting for Biden and change or you're FOS. Please stop with all the clickbait.
"Less homogeneous" is very different from "not homogeneous" which is basically what Biden said. Why try and defend that statement?
In the primaries there was a huge split with older African Americans supporting Biden and young African Americans supporting Bernie. Latin Americans supported Bernie regardless of age. Are you going to use that to say we're all the same?
Anyone claiming they still might vote for Trump unless Biden VP picks suits them...is a Trump voter.
Why can't you people grasp that there are very many of us who absolutely don't want Trump as POTUS *and* absolutely don't want Biden as POTUS?
I don't want Trump to be POTUS.  I don't want Biden to be POTUS.  Therefore, I will not vote for either of them.  This is not a difficult concept to comprehend.

Biden is going to take all your rights away but Trump can't even get Hillary locked up. üòÇ
That finally explains whisper campaigns around Harris's veep campaign, multiple sources claiming she won't "get in the eva" to Biden's liking.
Like there are truly so many valid things to criticise Biden for, including his mental stamina, but Trump is so obviously far more unstable why even bother calling attention to mental fitness? Proposal: No one over 70 eligible for the office of POTUS.
Wow, Biden is going to repeal a constitutional amendment on his first day in office. That's impressive.
I know who &amp; what Trump and Biden are. If you don't at this point you won't be capable of evaluating a debate. I think Biden will mop the floor w/ Trump, but even if Biden comes out &amp; curls up in a fetal ball on stage I'll vote for him. Trump is a plague upon us, literally.
It is mind boggling that the right can't come up with any better criticism of Biden than to say he is mentally unfit and "against God" when Trump, who has trouble reading and can't say anything remotely informed about Christianity or the Bible, is their man...
Where‚Äôs the lie? Biden is talking about a true but unfortunate reality. BA‚Äôs are much more monolithic in voting habits than the Latinx community.
I don't think God's got much to fear from J.Biden, tbh.
You‚Äôre reaching.  BA‚Äôs are the most loyal democratic voting bloc without fail. We are not monolithic when it comes to political views and values but we are when it comes to voting. Biden is correct on this one.
You and I obviously have different memories of Obama/Biden. They faced 2 pandemics and a severe recession and left the country in better shape than they got it in. I voted for McCain and Romney but thinking Biden is the end of America is just ridiculous

That much everyone seems to agree on. Trump is definitely down from 2016 but nothing shows Biden leading. I know Democrats are polling the general election for the House race. I simply don't buy that Republicans aren't. It doesn't make sense.
My source further elaborates that he has not seen anything from Republicans showing a Biden lead. Possible this is an unweighted poll though (before they weight it to match the electorate). Outside groups have done polling here and they match campaign. Trump down from 16.

Fascinating to see so many people on Twitter try to call Biden racist for his comments about black people (which I‚Äôm not saying weren‚Äôt messed up) when Trump has said much worse things like 10,000 times over the last four years. Fascinating.

'Better America': Biden's campaign launches new national ad aimed at Black Americans
No, the guy is a hardcore far-left communist like Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, Biden, Bernie, AOC, etc. They all want to hold the country, our economy, and political discourse hostage until the election because they have no other option to hide Joe Biden's horrific record.
He says we don't need a Biden program that includes a jobs program. Also likes the tax cuts Trump has provided.   He talks in a reasonable tone, but his views are just as tone-deaf as Trumps. In other words, he likes the boat loads of money Trump has provided for people like him.

Trump used this photo of Joe Biden praying in church in an attack ad.... Trump attacks prayer
With 88 days to go until Trump's reelection, Biden's handlers have still not been able to select a running mate for him.   They have, however picked a campaign theme song: "Nowhere Man" by the Beatles.
The Biden campaign announced today that the former V.P. won't be travelling to Milwaukee for the Democratic convention, presumably to reassure foreign donors that there will not be any live mic moments or creepy sniffing of his as yet unnanounced running mate at the convention.
You know as well as I know. If Biden wins it‚Äôs not going to be ncbof the boogie man of the far left
Joe Biden or  should make an ad about Trump's 2016 broken promises. Here he is promising 4+% GDP growth (never got above 3%) and that with Hillary we'd have less than zero (which we now have with Trump).
So many lies to unpack in your comment..Biden is not a progressive nor crowd funded..BLM donations don't go to Biden..we have never seen a more corrupt admin in our history in trump..those are the facts..
Biden has been wrong about every major foreign policy issue for the past 40 years.  Bob Gates the former Sec Def said this not too long ago also.  He opposed Reagan in cold war, he opposed 1st Iraq war, supported the 2nd, opposed killing Bin Laden...just to name a few.
Biden won't go to Milwaukee for DNC acceptance speech: Sources
You should know all about impotence..I mean incompetence. Birds of a feather.  I bet you and Biden would get along great in rambling babbling convo.
Fauci he is playing politics. Anything to make trump look bad. Tell that to the ppl of Brazil &amp;India.We just have way more tests. Fauci getting paid by Obama/Biden and probably China. He changes his mind every week. If Obama was still prez the media coverage would b way different
Wrong. Health issues go to the states largely. Trump did all he possibly could. Biden said 150 million ppl died haha. Blind hatred without knowing the facts makes you stupid. Trump paid for ppls treatment who didn't have insurance for free. But you wouldn't know that watching cnn
We should have debates like we have always had in this country..this request by trump campaign is just because they know they are losing and the debate committee will probably not fall of this..and if they do, I think Biden will show up for the extra debates as well..
Why does Biden think he can make low paid people go to work at grocery stores, Home Depot, WalMart, liquor stores and such, yet it is too dangerous for him to appear at the convention? The other dim delegates and convention attendees must go and conduct business and Biden hides
Don't you love Sally Yates?  Biden should make her his AG.
new claim w/ a good chance of being true: GOP is successfully getting Kanye on ballots in whatever states are left in order to siphon votes from Biden. A 2020 Jill Stein-esque type of deal but way less prepared and  more cynical. *hitting restart button now*
My concern would be for younger voters, regardless of race. Might vote for Kanye as a joke when they would have voted for Biden out of hatred for Trump. I‚Äôm just speculating though. I hope young voters would be serious about 2020 elections though. ü§ûüèª
I‚Äôve noticed that something is happening to Biden. I think it‚Äôs more of a mental and physical exhaustion from the campaign. At least that‚Äôs what I hope is happening.
It‚Äôs truly disgusting. Why not retire &amp; spend the rest of their days being cozy?? &amp; I can‚Äôt believe we don‚Äôt have a nonpartisan something in place 2 make sure candidates are mentally healthy. Trump, Kanye and Biden may all be mentally compromised. We know they‚Äôre not totally well
President Joe Biden
I see what you did there. Can President Biden name his Cabinet now? It will lower the Nation‚Äôs blood pressure.
And the first Black Woman to get the job on top of that? This is the same woman who said it‚Äôs time to ‚Äúlet the Anita Hill thing go.‚Äù But Kamala is supposed to apologize for DEBATING Biden? It‚Äôs all fishy to me. Jill doesn‚Äôt want 2 take a backseat 2 a black woman.
What I‚Äôve been thinking the entire time. Joe Biden never should have run, I‚Äôm willing to bet she was all for it. She wants the same amount of attention as Michelle, not possible. And no chance if it‚Äôs Harris, no matter what project she takes on. VP has never been more important.

Unscathed, maybe. But definitely rattled. Nice to see someone finally able to make him that jumpy and nervous. And yes, no way Biden puts even one sentence together in that interview.

As she said, people were dumb enough to vote for Reagan and W twice. Hopefully America votes for Biden instead. üëçüèª
Black folks who might vote for Kanye were Not going to vote for Biden anyway.  If anything, it might pull those few black voters away from trump.
There a lot of good reasons to question Trump‚Äôs mental acuity. There are no good reasons for Biden not to take this extremely simple test before he is potentially elected President.
This is so true !  Black folks who might vote for Kanye were Not going to vote for Biden anyway !
It's really sad and pathetic that the Bernie Bros are still attacking Biden and spewing Russian talking talking points to help Trump.

I‚Äôm not convinced that Biden will be the nominee. Biden is obviously not calling the shots, who is?  I think whoever is calling the shots will replace him at the convention

No, that is not true.   Biden can‚Äôt complete a thought; he‚Äôs a known racist; he is really creepy; he hasn‚Äôt done anything in 47 years; and he‚Äôll be a puppet for the ‚Äúsquad.‚Äù  Anything is better than that.
He won‚Äôt travel to any in-person debate.  They will push for a split screen virtual debate so Biden can stay in his basement and his people off-camera will tell him what to say. Don‚Äôt want to risk him being on stage alone with no one to help him complete a thought...
Trump's campaign knocks on a million doors a week. Biden's knocks on zero.
Amen anyone with half a brain has to know that Joe Biden is just a puppet!
Mrs Biden should be ashamed allowing this.  This is when family steps in.  Clearly his mind is impaired.
And I doubt Biden will debate Trump in person alone. He has agreed to three debates‚Äîbut what format will it take? Trump and Biden on split screen with Biden in his basement where his people off camera can tell him what to say? That‚Äôs my guess.

This not to siphon from Biden but is a way for foreign actors to move vote just like they did with Stein. Johnson was a non zero sum gain.  They moved HRC votes to Stein in just the right numbers because they had the totals.  Last minute moves with 67,000 votes won the day.
Aren't we a critical one? Nearly 20 yrs ago, Biden eulogized Strom Thurmond, a staunch bigot. You bagged on Beto &amp; pled he's tone-deaf when he called Netanyahu a racist- though the US doesn't negotiate with terrorists. Re-evaluate. Who gave U the deed to the corner on criticism?

If I was advising him I‚Äôd tell him to not attack Biden for having lost a step. That‚Äôs like me saying someone has a big head; it may be true, but I‚Äôm not the one to make that point.
Unless I‚Äôm woefully missing some shenanigans here, this is some 4th Reicht bullshit. Vote for Biden. Then vote against Biden a few years later in a primary if you must.
Predictably right on queue, #whatboutism defense.  When you can't actually defend the issue, drop back, punt and meme.  We're all quite aware of Biden's issues but now...back to King Hamberder, Lord of the 15 Flushes.
Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄòBuild Back Never‚Äô: His Endless Government Assaults Will Make Building America Impossible
Joe Biden Can't Stop Lying About Getting Arrested, Tucker Carlson Roasts Him
Biden is simply a puppet of the far left.  Do we really want a president who can‚Äôt think for himself?  Won‚Äôt debate?  Can‚Äôt make his own decisions?
Mr. President. You're 74 years old now. You and Joe Biden have the same problem. You'll both probably need walkers by 2024 comes around. The White House is going to need a geriatric wing between the two of you.
So you are saying Trump is afraid of Joe Biden ?
The communist party endorsed #DementiaJoe #JoeBiden
I‚Äôm sure the replies are full of ‚Äòbut they were wrong in 2016‚Äô. Remember, he was up against Hillary, who was despised by anyone that didn‚Äôt support her. Biden doesn‚Äôt carry the baggage that the Clinton name does.
If Biden won‚Äôt debate he should become known as ‚ÄúChicken Little‚Äù.             If Biden wins the election, he will become a puppet.  He claims to be moderate.  The reality is that he is already a puppet to the far left Dems.
One would think that Biden, having been in gov't most of his life, would understand that all bills originate in the Legislative Branch, and that the Executive faithfully executes legislation signed into law.
"As President, Biden will do everything in his power to eliminate health care disparities" Except pass Medicare for All
Biden was one of the Dems I stated I'd vote for he were the nominee. His cognitive abilities seem to have declined significantly and his platform has been hijacked. I may take a chance that he's still a centrist (&amp; just lying to keep the socialist wing of the D party engaged).
Wow, Susan, those are stunning characteristics? Joe Biden could really use someone who adds to those talents, putting the US on the mend. You must be supporting Kamala Harris for VP too! That's great. You did such a nice job National Security advisor. Why not go for it again?
Please consider working with community organizations instead. Biden may not be as horrific as Trump for the latine community but we should not pretend he's going to help
The only way is for Trump and his supporters to pound the Democrats into the dirt and capture House, Senate and the Presidency. Maybe Americans will be so sick of the Dems that will happen. Biden was in the thick of things
Trump‚Äôs bag of tricks comes up empty against Biden  via  keeping his promises to his  2016 voters, most especially  slowing the demographic tide wrought by illegal immigration, were the  most important things he could have done. He doesn't get it.
‚ÄúCivility‚Äù went out the window too, Biden jabbing his finger into people and telling them to piss off is good now.
Oh you mean the record unemployment numbers in this country Pre-Covid?  You talking about the economy that was roaring Pre-Covid?  Yea that was Trump and his Administration.  NOT the senile Biden you seem to champion.  Good luck with that come November.
Joe Biden, Elon Musk, Bill Gates And Others Hacked In 'Coordinated' Bitcoin Scam
Right- he should‚Äôve waved his magic wand over a globe and done away with all illness, just like Hillary, Obama or Biden would‚Äôve...... I‚Äôve never seen such misplaced blame and unbridled hate for our country.
This inexpensive advertisement authored by  has an excellent return on investment for our future president, Joe Biden.  Keep 'em coming Trumpy!

Joe Biden‚Äôs wife should be ashamed.  To allow her husband to continue to run and be ridiculed because of his obvious dementia is mean.  Family should never allow this. #shameonthem #BidenCrimeFamily #JoeBidendementia
None! ...only old left over Obama/Biden stickers
That is priceless coming from your side. You hold onto every conspiracy theory like it‚Äôs your last breath. Care to comment on what Biden and Pelosi said. Fauci?  No mask, let‚Äôs go to Chinatown. Bwaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaa
I don't lecture anyone on anything, why would I?  Pointless. Surely you are not stupid enough to try to paint the picture of perfection for your Democrat party...  If you don't like corruption, why vote for Biden?
As usual he had to clean up after a failure Republican. Biden‚Äôs gonna have to do the same because American conservatives are some of the worst people on earth. And the past four years have revealed them as the degenerates that they are
I have this thought which makes me smile. Biden has the US rejoin the Human Right's Council of the UN and they go after him for Human Right's violations. He needs to be held accountable.
Each time I listen to üçä speak, I think blood is going to come out of my ears. Jan 2021 can't come soon enough (provided Biden wins).
Joe Biden knows we have to build a more equitable future for all. That's why he released his agenda for the Latino Community.   Join Julie Chavez Rodriguez &amp;  who's running to be the 1st Latino Democratic member of the #NCGA, to discuss it:
Joe Biden is running for president... he's not the president yet.  Like,  he doesn't have the job, he's still in the interview process. He's been through debates where he laid out some policy proposals, but there haven't been any debates since the plague year began.
I wouldn't be surprised if Trump takes issue with something about the debates, refuses to debate, and blames it on Biden.
Not hardly. Putin knows damn well he can't trample on America while Trump is president. Biden on the other hand would be a weak puppet to Putin, and he knows it.
Democrats won‚Äôt even vote for biden because all the CON GAMES, one sided fake impeachment, FBI , Obama‚Äôs eara COUP, to be fair most of them caught and will probably go to PRISON!! Durham report soon, the LIARS ü§• and the COUP will have to answer for this AMERICAN embarrassment!!!

Bret: "The moment we read the tweet, ‚ÄúJust ‚Äòcongratulated‚Äô ‚Äòpresident-elect‚Äô Joe Biden (total loser). You‚Äôll miss me VERY SOON!!!‚Äù is the moment our long national nightmare will finally be over."
I love how he tries to project his own decline onto Biden too. Sure, Biden's had some gaffes, but yeesh, 45 is textbook dementia. Reading aloud isn't that hard.
And he tries to say Biden with is occasional gaffe is losing it? Jeeez.
Biden leads Trump, Kelly tops McSally in Arizona: poll
But you see Biden will take us back to the days where America was better at clandestine efforts to destabilize South American governments. See it'll all be fixed and better and good and not like now when it's bad and we just look like dorks...
Before election. I will go with September 29th. They will try too indict Biden.
Joe Biden, Jr, is that truth or fact??
For voters who decide to vote-by-mail, this election isn‚Äôt in 3 months -- it starts in 30 days:
Bret: Trump laying groundwork for...a mythology to explain defeat...&amp; keep Trump family relevant in the GOP. ..that he‚Äôd pull a stunt like this...it‚Äôs so important that he lose in a landslide. Gail: Get your act together, GA. And I‚Äôm looking at you, AZ.
I agree, and this is why I think Biden's strategy of not agreeing to more debates is correct. As my late father used to say, don't get into a pissing match with a skunk
Again.: I am not disagreeing. Biden has a proven record of racism, he is against gay marriage (or was, now he says differently). I am hoping that people pay attention during primaries and we don‚Äôt have to have these convos.
Plot twist! Biden picks Alyssa Milano for VP!üòÆ Dear lord, could you imagine? I mean it is a 2020 afterall.üòê

Is Biden going to be any better? Almost certainly. The people around him are going to be far better, smarter people who believe in the role of government. Is Biden some political genius? No. But the people who fill his cabinet will be. Unlike today.
Why? Biden clearly is the one for the job. We need a leader who cares, can handle a crisis, and believes in science. Your guy is a moron.
Joe Biden is forgetting how to even tie his shoes.
I want to make myself clear, I think Trump is a pompous ass. I just do not think that Joe Biden is any better or different.
Absolutely not. But I have also seen examples of where Biden did the same. At the end of the day I think we need to get rid of both parties and start over
By policy I mean platform. I do not agree with a lot. But I don‚Äôt see anything in Biden‚Äôs economics that sound practical.
Seeing a lot of reporters who should know better, opining something is wrong with Biden's search for a VP.  Since 1960, virtually every VP was picked within 1 week of the party convention, or at the convention. But convention picks are outdated. Last times? Dems in 84/GOP in 88
Yep. Even the video of Biden putting on a Phillies hat broke my brain a little with how much red hats have become an at-a-glance identifier of people to avoid.

His campaign co-chair is another matter.  He's had a few issues with campaign staff hasn't he?
Sanders has been earlier and more emphatic in his insistence that people vote for his former primary opponent over Trump this time around, right?
How disassociated from reality are YOU thinking Biden would be any better?????? Lmfao!! Laughable
Joe Biden stumbles over his words from time to time. This motherfucker can‚Äôt READ. In fact, he knows better than anyone that he can‚Äôt read, and yet he doesn‚Äôt even bother to proofread a speech before stepping to the podium. #CognitiveFlatline
Now I get a text message from the Biden HQ asking if I'm wondering who Joe is going to pick for VP.  Nope I'm really not...At this point just pick one.   I need a lawn sign.
Biden would‚Äôve said yo-mamma
If the USPS slowdown doesn't depress the count, people are not fully recognizing how Biden will run up the popular vote totals with VBM being added in states he already does well in.  Will not change states from red to blue, per se, but the raw vote count, yes.
I think one of Biden‚Äôs strengths is his willingness to bring in folks to his circle of advisors, listen to them, and defer to their expertise on a given matter. He‚Äôll be the deciding voice in the room, but he‚Äôll lean on his cabinet more than Trump. No more ‚ÄúI know everything‚Äù BS.
And they say Biden is senile... &lt;eyeroll&gt;
I can't wait to watch. Every time Trump lies he needs to be called a liar. That way,the only thing that Biden has to keep saying is - that's a lie, that's a lie, that's a lie!  #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

Where does that come from? I'm curious..  He wasn't my favorite personality but I didn't necessarily find him objectionable.. especially compared to #Trump or #Biden  Granted they're hard to compete with..
The Trump interview is full batshit. This man is not sound of mind and never has been in his political career. I cannot believe people want to watch that interview and then complain about Biden's mind.
Seriously, Dude??? B-B-B!!!  President Biden with Compassion over a Cold, Ignorant, Self Entitled Dictator Anyday! Everyday! You really are the special son, arent you?
If Joey Biden really wants my vote, he should pick me as his Vice President
I‚Äôm not doing this for Biden. I‚Äôm voting for him to give some hope to the poor, the oppressed races, the refugees, the minority religious faiths, the uninsured, and my brothers and sisters of the LGBT.
Biden isn‚Äôt perfect, but I can guarantee you he is nowhere in the vicinity of ‚Äújust as bad‚Äù as Trump. That was Trump‚Äôs play in 2016‚Ä¶‚Äùall politicians are crooks; might as well take me‚Äù‚Ä¶but trying to draw that false equivalency simply isn‚Äôt true.
I might not be working on a presidential campaign this year but TRUST I‚Äôm about to organize and do whatever I can to get Biden elected.
Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt even want vote for Biden. Whew! Couldn‚Äôt be me.
Barely   Although Biden *might* have some cognitive problems, he will at least listen to the health advisors about covid, and hopefully not go against them.  It's not even "we want Biden" it's more of "we don't want Trump" haha
First, you gotta love the Brits and how they interview. Second, Trump is petty. Vote for Joe Biden for President on Nov. 3. Trump can‚Äôt be president ever again. Ever.
‚ÄúThe base is high 30s and that won Trump the primary but he largely won the general election because Hillary was so unpopular. And Biden‚Äôs negatives are not as high as Hillary‚Äôs so there‚Äôs a big problem.‚Äù
If Joe Biden is fortunate enough to win on Election Day (I‚Äôm done counting chickens), we need to all have a clear understanding on Day One the type of mess he‚Äôll be inheriting, because there‚Äôs a good chance his entire four years will be spent digging us out of it.
Maybe have school children read a bunch of Trump tweets and a bunch of Biden tweets verbatim and see which ones seems vile.
These swing state polls are getting dicey for Biden. üôÑ
Yeppp anybody who doesn‚Äôt believe what YOU believe is ‚Äúuneducated‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure all of the ‚Äúeducated‚Äù people will be voting for Joe Biden this November! The man can barely speak and hasn‚Äôt done shit in 40 years of public service. we‚Äôre uneducated though!
May not be(or never was) Biden... Bait &amp; Switch!
I think he's more focused on his successful efforts to roll back Biden's 1994 crime bill, which incarcerated a generation of black males, and minority unemployment, which he helped reduce to the lowest level since tracking began.

All of them apply to Biden

he resonated with a lot of people - I don‚Äôt see that as the same as ego. People kept him where he was. I liked him a lot but saw it has his first attempt to get his name out there. I mean hey Joe Biden has been running for President since the 1988 election. It takes time.
Nobody hates Joe Biden. Lots of people don't like him for one reason or another, but hate is what drives lots of voting based on pure negative partisanship. And Trump's not going to get that from running against Biden.
I am a Republican voting for Biden come this November.

Biden also is a lifelong stutterer. Much of his verbal gaffs are *very* much the kind of avoidance behaviors you see in stutterers trying NOT to stutter. Such issues are not uncommon to be worse under stress.
Biden is to the anti-war community.
LMAO! So Biden is better?
Biden isn't part of a lying administration at all...
Including the Central American who are here illegally &amp; don't even connect the dots if Biden wins. I read them on comments in YouTube.
After Duckworth (who lost both her legs in combat) made Biden's list for VP, Tucker Carlson began regularly attacking her, claiming she IS NOT A PATRIOT.This coming from a man who has never served in the military.
Of COURSE all these people are. Biden sucks. Whoever he picks for VP is gonna suck. This whole thing sucks.  And with ALL of that, it's still a million times better than what's there now.

Biden won't debate. duh
Old news.... anyone other than a Trump supporter doesn't care... let them waste their time..the important question is... who is the most qualified to be president... because in the end Biden is 77 and will probably be a 1 term president or less....Rice is ready day one.
Biden should only debate Trump if T‚Äôs tax returns are released.  Biden gains nothing by debating this BS artist.
"Massive amounts of generalizable data consistently show Biden leading in almost every battleground state. Highly visible yet unrepresentative signs will instead in all likelihood dictate strategy."  The wrong lesson was learned from 2016.

Dementia Joe .Aren't you all still waiting for hillary to die from your 2016 conspiracy theories? Stick with her before starting new conspiracy theories about biden..
Sure uhhh pervert camera worsen....uhh and another thing did you hear about what Biden did when they asked him to take a cognitive test because not a lot of people know this, and I told them, millions of Americans are talking about this but it's like nobody knows it
Oh and stone talking to Wikileaks and russian intelligence to discuss releasing emails..the list is long of the campaign trying to solicit help from russia..now name one time biden has asked Iran or China to help him win his election..
I'm really a tremendous person, probably the most tremendous since at least, when I took the cognitive test, and I took a cognitive test and of course Biden wouldn't do it but I did it and they said this is incredible nobody does this but i did it.
You may be pushing it with Sarah Palin, but I‚Äôd be good with any of the rest.
Let biden or his campaign ask any foreign government for help with his elections..the minute Biden says something like, China if you are listening,   we'll be onto him as well..most of the world wants normalcy out of USA..doesn't give them the right to meddle in our elections..
Maybe because Biden doesn‚Äôt use Twitter
U.S. Intelligence: China Opposes Trump Reelection; Russia Works Against Biden
Robin Williams' 'rambling' Joe Biden bit resurfaces 11 years later
NOT TRUE. Russia is WAY ahead of China/Iran in their influence of US (and other countries) elections.Everyone knows  Biden isnt WELCOMING help from China/Iran, while Trump has already welcomed Russia's help, even assisting them.
The big difference here is that neither China nor Iran have even a fraction of the influence campaign that Russia have developed: no where near  Biden isnt WELCOMING help from China/Iran.Trump already has and  the Mueller report!
Trump has been very confrontational with Russia for several years now. Why would Russia prefer Biden? China I get. They've already paid the family off. And, Iran would do almost anything to get rid of Trump. This report is pure bullshit.
You do realize that Ivanka Trump got MILLIONS in patents from China when she went on the Presidential visit there last year right, you hypocrite? Hunter Biden didn't work for the Administration........really not the same thing.

Everyone should vote NOW.  Biden has already agreed to the debate schedule and Trump has not. Biden released his tax returns. Do you think Trump will release his tax returns before this debate?  Lots of people are saying Trump and Deutche Bank are under criminal investigation.
Please don‚Äôt vote green in 2020. I love their platform but we need every vote we can get to go to Biden so we can prevent Trump from being re-elected. At this point, as much as I hate to say it, it really is the lesser of two evils. #SettleForBiden

I am so tired of the text and email begging for money.  It's not just the Biden campaign it's everyone running plus the DNC.  I get emails from Nancy Pelosi saying Maria I beg you.......lol JFC I'm ready to delete my email
Joe Biden was absolutely correct. Hispanic and Latino people come from many countries, including the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. A majority of African Americans descend from a few countries on the West Coast of Africa. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.
The big story here is that Biden can't keep his messaging straight between the image of America his team gets from polls, and the image of America he's supposed to present as a candidate. Imagine if Obama said "as you know, 78% of Latinos support X policy"
Stop it , there is no comparing the two. Trump can get up in front of a crowd and give a two hour speech with no notes. Biden can't even get a sentence out with notes.
Biden supports legalizing abortions for women that want them. Trump bans women fleeing forced abortions from entering the United States.  I understand many Catholics are upset with the former, but why are you ok with the later.
Let me guess, one of the notable exceptions is Barack Obama. The man who Biden describes as ‚ÄúThe first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,"
Yes, compared to, say, the Pope Biden isn't very religious.  He's not running against the Pope. He's running against someone who fucked a porn star while his wife was at home with a baby and who brags how he can get away with sexual assault.
At least you're honest. ;-)  The choice is between Trump and Biden. I'll take Biden and see where we are in 4 years instead of Trump continuing to burn down the nation and wipe his arse with the Constitution.
They don't have work very hard for Team Pete.  We made it extremely easy for the Biden campaign from the day Pete dropped out.  That's why it better to expect nothing from them.  The only thing they should expect from me is my vote.

Well, let me embarrassingly admit I'm holding near max NO on Rice and "over-paid" by an average of 8 cents, so if Biden's crew is doing this I know someone high up in the campaign and will submit a reimbursement claim.
Thing is Biden totally could have talked about the diversity of the latinx community, without adding the insulting remark about the black community. C‚Äômon man...

Imagine if Biden is president üò≤ a lot of LEGAL immigrants who don't speak Spanish would be screwed by thousands of recently arrived economic migrants.
That‚Äôs why I hate those people. ‚ÄúNot voting for Biden is voting for Trump.‚Äù No it‚Äôs not, both are extremely corrupt: Biden is owned by the oligarchs that run this country and Trump is a wannabe fascist dictator. I want no part of it.
Correct. Anyone on the right would‚Äôve had their career destroyed by this.  However, this is a distraction:   Biden is so fuddled that he can‚Äôt recognize softball questions from friendlies. His reaction was to get angry and attack.  Imagine him doing this with Xi or Putin.
Too late. #Portland Mayor says continued rioting will help re-elect #Trump in November. Damage is already done...people of all ages and races have seen the destruction and attach it to #Biden and #Democrats lack of concern for public safety. Hard to run away from now

The only thing Biden has going for him is that he‚Äôs not Trump üíÄ  Buckle up y‚Äôall.
That‚Äôs fine. Not at the convention. They get no benefit from it and in fact doing a joint event with Biden after the convention would have more impact. No convention time for someone to launch their 2024 Presidential Campaign.
AMERICANS SHOULD BOYCOTT KIMYE IF THEY WANT BIDEN TO WIN.  KANYE WOULD DROP OUT IF IT MEANT IT WAS DESTROYING THEIR LIVELIHOOD.
Who voted for Biden? Was he not voted as the nominee defeating Bernie in state after state with his wide support base among suburban populations and overwhelming black support for his record as VP under obama..
You can complain that Biden isn't the most religious person, but compared to Donald Trump...
Accept that Bernie didn't have popular support and move on..biden won with his suburban base and his popularity with the black communities based on his record as VP under Obama..there's no reason to blame anyone..bernie's message did not resonate with people..i wish it had..
Has Biden said he will take away people's guns? I remember the same thing said about Obama and nobody took anyone's guns
BTW they have all thrown each other under the bus to save Biden and Obama.  But ur right the GOP have zero balls to actually do something about it.
If Biden were to pick #SarahPalin for #VP, would you vote for #Trump??  ü§£
He is a racist. He is telling you who he is.....
It's more likely than not Biden picked a VP weeks ago &amp; the timing of an announcement is to maximize its' effect.  This is politics performance art. VP announcements since late 80's are with 1 exception announced 2-3 days prior to convention. Ya think all prez just can't decide?
That and just calling it a hoax. Biden says he will accept nomination in his home state, so Trump comes back and says  He might use the WH. How appropriate. Looking for any advantage even if by association
Earlier this week,   launched his Agenda for the Latino Community. The Latino community is a core part of the American community &amp; our contributions are evident in every part of society. I was delighted to join other NC Leaders &amp; praise Biden's bold agenda. #ncpol
Obama got all the other centrist contenders to drop out and endorse Biden. That's not a conspiracy.
Yo, America can have Biden problems or Trump problems. Your choice. But if that fraudulent pig gets re-elected Biden problems will fit into a teacup compared to the monstrosities Trump has in store ‚Äúfor‚Äù America over the next four years.

Due to Biden's mental decline, the VP pick is critical. The VP will likely be running the show from early on. That's one reason Dubya kept Cheney around. The other reason was that he and his neocon buddies had him by the balls. I'd hope for better this time.

Love you, Kanye. Maybe he actually dislikes Biden and the Democrats that much that he would do this, to me that warrants some attention and skepticism from the crowd that wants Joe in no matter what. Consider the evidence in front of you.
Are you slow? Biden said all black people are the same.
Wake up AMERICA, you cannot take this man seriously. God help us all if you do. Vote, BIDEN in November.
I don't give two shits if Biden or Trump are religious. This is not an argument I care about. Show me which one believes in science.
Fuck You...!!!...I‚Äôm still Ridin with Biden...!!!
they won't after they saw what you did to Trump.  Biden is in worse shape when it's non scripted questions.
Biden's gonna get at least 90% of the Black vote, folks. These "gaffes" don't change anything. Any Dem nominee for President is guaranteed to win at least 90% of the Black vote these days.
I think she was a perfect spokesperson for Bernie. Did you see her on "The Breakfast Club"? I disagree with her about Joe Biden, but ONLY because Trump is killing us by the thousands. ANYONE would be lucky to have her on their team.
Vote Biden and this will be the norm. And you won‚Äôt have guns to protect yourself. #Trump2020NowMoreThenEver
Love it. Now if we could get Biden to keep his mouth shut and quit giving Trump ammo...
It‚Äôs a virus. Unless he has a magic wand, there‚Äôs nothing more our President could have done. Hillary, Obama, or Biden‚Äôs actions would‚Äôve been similar, if not identical. You deranged, TDS infected libs are so far gone, you‚Äôve lost all sense of reality.
Bollier is winning 18% of Republicans and has a 45-29 advantage with independents.  Trump leads Biden only 50-43. That would be the largest share of the vote for a Democratic candidate in Kansas since 1976:

Nobody liked Tim Kaine. At the time, it was widely regarded as a bad and confusing choice. Biden will almost certainly pick a bad VP as well. It is what it is. Democrats are idiots
Ah yes, the primaries, where Biden‚Äôs support was clearly driven by his policy stances and not by an elite/media narrative around ‚Äúelectability‚Äù
-You, a hater, in 2011: ‚ÄúChristian, why are taking multiple undergrad classes on philosophy of religion? When will those topics ever be relevant?‚Äù  -Trump, 2020, probably: ‚ÄúJoe Biden is mailing glitter bombs to God‚Äôs house. It‚Äôs getting in God‚Äôs eyes and it hurts God real bad.‚Äù
I guess Biden‚Äôs one of those people who think that all blacks look alike.
While this may be correct, I feel quite sure this criticism of Trump is in response to his recent rantings about Biden. You know the old saying - pot calling the kettle black. Biden has made word errors and has stuttered thru speeches, however doesn't dis Trump on his gafs.
Why did Trump make attack ad of Biden praying ???
At a debate, Biden should just lob quotes and verses from the Bible at every chance and challenge Trump to do the same.  The emperor has no clothes.
If Biden looses the election, it will be because of his own big mouth.  What a disaster.
Russian troll farms are actively working to convince progressive Dems not to vote for Biden and some are actually falling for it. HELLO? Did you see what happened in 2016? Getting played once might be excusable, but twice? This would be your OWN damn fault. Don't be dumb! #ncpol
You Ain‚Äôt Black didn‚Äôt hurt Biden and this won‚Äôt either... Taking the side of police over black lives does matter however... When you call black protesters anarchists that matters Trump
Trump picked the wrong subject here. I have met VP Biden many times and worked with his son Beau on a charity project.  He is as decent, kind and sincere as they come. And his faith is an integral part of him. Trump is no match for this man. #Biden2020
Who's the Bully...a reporter challenges Biden about his mental state and Biden accuses him of being on cocaine...anytime Biden gets a tough question which is rare... he bullys the reporter

The DNC is a spectacle, not a policy conference. She's one of the three most visible and culturally relevant politicians in the country and she's particularly popular among young &amp; left-leaning people, two blocs Biden needs even more in states like WI where the margin is narrow.

It‚Äôs so adorable to see my republican friends call people idiots for considering a Biden vote because ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt even put together a coherent sentence‚Äù as if Trump is poet laureate of 2020.
Although you also have Bernie and Warren speaking, which makes me think this is as much about not giving AOC a leg up on some of the other future party leaders as not wanting Biden to be outdone (nearly everyone will ‚Äúoutdo‚Äù Biden)
Waiting for Joe Biden's VP pick is like waiting for a toddler to put on their shoes. It's like... I can just do it for you, please let me. We have places to be.

Just saying universal health care, especially given vulnerabilities exposed by a global pandemic is wildly popular and Biden's continued opposition to it is suicidally stubborn. If he took a stand for something 69% of America and 88% of Democrats want, it would help.

You misunderstood, understandably, but you'll get it if you take a minute. He's talking about a "landslide" election in which Biden is flipping states (red-to-blue). Those states are ranked by probability of a win (even if &lt;50%). Big drop in prob after TX. AK next most prob flip.
One of the most annoying parts about this whole Biden will ‚Äúhurt g-d‚Äù speech is that trump shouldn‚Äôt even be bringing religion or g-d into this. It has nothing to do with politics at all. We‚Äôve strayed way too far from separation of church and state

I can only assume that Biden car video is him endorsing The Onion as his speech writers/election strategists.
It's a considerable stretch from "Joe Biden will be a puppet controlled entirely by AOC" to "Joe Biden is powerful enough to physically harm the Lord."
"Yeah, I was going to vote for Biden because Trump is a narcissistic insane person who is wholly unfit to govern, but then I found out he was going to nominate Val Demings as VP and I'm just not so sure anymore..."
Even then, at least the Trump would be VP instead of President. I would still vote for Biden, but also be his personal bodyguard and ensure he survives the term so the VP can't take over. üòÇ
This reminds me of that Wonder Showzen bit where the kids meet god and eat him. Now I'm laughing picturing Joe Biden with bbq sauce all over his face with that stupid grin
Joe Biden needs to start punting on first down. Just say nothing man. No more Interviews.
He's set the bar so low for Biden that during the debates Biden just has to show up. If I was advising Trump I'd tell him to drop the cognitive decline attacks. It just calls attention to his tenuous grasp of things.
I think we can explore the differences. The goal of exploring those differences should be to find common ground though. We already agree fuck Biden. So let's use it as a starting point to bring together African Americans and latines who agree with that
Idk where these people get off with their "Trump is the worst president ever but if Biden doesn't satisfy my very arbitrary desires I guess it's a wash" bullshit.
Clinton was out reminding people why they hate her for months by this time. Biden's hidin'. That's not going to help his numbers.    1st week of 11/16 you were saying Hispanic support for Clinton was up. Trump outperformed  McCain and has higher support with minorities NOW.

You're either voting for Biden and change or you're FOS. Please stop with all the clickbait.
"Less homogeneous" is very different from "not homogeneous" which is basically what Biden said. Why try and defend that statement?
In the primaries there was a huge split with older African Americans supporting Biden and young African Americans supporting Bernie. Latin Americans supported Bernie regardless of age. Are you going to use that to say we're all the same?

That finally explains whisper campaigns around Harris's veep campaign, multiple sources claiming she won't "get in the eva" to Biden's liking.
Like there are truly so many valid things to criticise Biden for, including his mental stamina, but Trump is so obviously far more unstable why even bother calling attention to mental fitness? Proposal: No one over 70 eligible for the office of POTUS.
Wow, Biden is going to repeal a constitutional amendment on his first day in office. That's impressive.
I know who &amp; what Trump and Biden are. If you don't at this point you won't be capable of evaluating a debate. I think Biden will mop the floor w/ Trump, but even if Biden comes out &amp; curls up in a fetal ball on stage I'll vote for him. Trump is a plague upon us, literally.
It is mind boggling that the right can't come up with any better criticism of Biden than to say he is mentally unfit and "against God" when Trump, who has trouble reading and can't say anything remotely informed about Christianity or the Bible, is their man...
Where‚Äôs the lie? Biden is talking about a true but unfortunate reality. BA‚Äôs are much more monolithic in voting habits than the Latinx community.
I don't think God's got much to fear from J.Biden, tbh.
You‚Äôre reaching.  BA‚Äôs are the most loyal democratic voting bloc without fail. We are not monolithic when it comes to political views and values but we are when it comes to voting. Biden is correct on this one.
You and I obviously have different memories of Obama/Biden. They faced 2 pandemics and a severe recession and left the country in better shape than they got it in. I voted for McCain and Romney but thinking Biden is the end of America is just ridiculous

That much everyone seems to agree on. Trump is definitely down from 2016 but nothing shows Biden leading. I know Democrats are polling the general election for the House race. I simply don't buy that Republicans aren't. It doesn't make sense.
My source further elaborates that he has not seen anything from Republicans showing a Biden lead. Possible this is an unweighted poll though (before they weight it to match the electorate). Outside groups have done polling here and they match campaign. Trump down from 16.

Fascinating to see so many people on Twitter try to call Biden racist for his comments about black people (which I‚Äôm not saying weren‚Äôt messed up) when Trump has said much worse things like 10,000 times over the last four years. Fascinating.
It‚Äôs very simple. Joe Biden expects to get 99% of the Black vote and about 75% of the Latino vote.

tRump with all this God, Bible and Gun talk is just orange with jealousy over all the power and influence Biden possesses.
The media is sure fans of decrying literally everything Trump does, but loves when Biden says (or when Obama said) he‚Äôll use executive power to accomplish stuff. The people low key like authoritarianism- when it is on their side. This is true for D and R.
Of course crime comes down when you jail everyone. I‚Äôm sure Democrats areglad that blacks must vote for Biden regardless of how this impacted their community, since they give up on their race if they stray from the Democrat party line.
Biden is a poltician and is about as empathetic as any. Suffering tragedy does not make you a better person by default. Attacking decent men like Romney as sexist and ‚Äúgoing to put blacks back in chains‚Äù shows a lot about his character.
Good for you. I‚Äôm sure you believe Trump is a man of faith because he is endorsed by many faith leaders who coincidentally have political aims that align with his. It‚Äôs not like Biden authored the bill that led to the higher mass incarceration of minorities in modern history.
Yeah, I‚Äôm sure that saying that people are attractive means you fuck them. Biden has far creepier interactions with children than Trump.
I don‚Äôt believe Biden hates God, but neither of them are good Christians.  Biden does use minorities as political pieces- as most politicians do. That meets the threshold for racism if you are a R, obv not if you‚Äôre D.

Given that methodological choice, the extant calendar 2020 polling in AK &amp; PA (with that adjustment for timing) gives us the following: AK: Trump +3.53 PA: Biden + 5.07 3/
Trump's interview debacle sends a warning for the fall campaign
Somebody said that Montana looks !like Biden sniffing Idaho, and now I can't unsee itüòé
Biden needs to accept interviews from diverse groups of Media. He can request questions in advance and determine who has journalistic credibility It hurts his brand to turn down Chris Wallace, who has proven to be a credible and balanced interviewer.
The commercials will largely take aim at President Donald Trump‚Äôs response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic fallout.
Did Biden just come out against pre-employment drug screens? Big policy move, if so.

You are the most corrupt President in US history. Stop rigging the upcoming election to your favor. Take on Joe Biden on your terrible record alone and stop the BS. #TrumpCorruption #TrumpHasNoPlan
Trump is so easy. He will lie about anything and everything trying to make a case to rig the election to his favor. He is afraid to go head to head with Biden, knowing he would lose badly. #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpTheSnake
I just have one question: Who is Biden‚Äôs running mate? Only 4 months until Election Day and no VP candidate? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
They‚Äôre basically selling Biden as Chairman Mao as is on Fox News so why not?
I knew my HOA was communist. They forbid me to hang out Old Glory. The president back up into a visitor space. Biden 2020. I wanted to vomit.
Isn‚Äôt it interesting how he only changed his tune when he began to trail Biden in the polls by double digits?  Obviously $600/month would be a good thing, but not only is it the bare minimum, it‚Äôs already several months too late for millions of Americans
John Lewis, George Floyd, Colin Kaepernic, Joe Biden, RBG, Nicholle Wallace, Joy Ried, Kamala Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Col. Vindman? Every month a hero steps up.
Biden's talking about in-bred hillbillys, right? Your version has been cut&amp;pasted. In summary regarding violent criminals (rape&amp;murder) Biden said "We have obligation to cordon them off from rest of society, try to help them, try to change behavior.That's what we do in this bill"
I mean Biden would get embarrassed. I can‚Äôt knock the strategy when Trump is out here killing his own campaign daily
Trump is more of the general political rah rah to the highest levels. People love yas qweening their pols to own the other side‚Ä¶.idk if we will ever see truly civil politics at the top again. Biden surely isn‚Äôt, and obv not Trump.
I feel like Biden has been picking his VP next week for the last 6 weeks

At FHQ the current tipping point state is PA (always in yellow on the Spectrum).  Biden is +5.19 there as of now.
With only 2 on a stage and only a couple of moderators, distance, therefore debates (in person) should not be an issue. For God‚Äôs sake, Biden‚Äôs mind is so far away, no virus could ever find it.
Wait what! Joe Biden can't wait find out who he picked?ü§î
Oh please. Biden hasn‚Äôt done anything in his 40+ years in government and you think he‚Äôs going to start now? The poor old Joe is already starting.
As a libertarian when i bash trump im a biden supporter when i bash biden im a trumper people dont seem to get they both suck lol
Biden won‚Äôt heal this nation, he is a puppet for the Democratic Party who can‚Äôt put a comprehensive sentience together. Hillary and Obama and other Democrats want to divide us and keep us divided.
Georgia and Ohio remain the most competitive states on the board at FHQ, but they switched spots in the order yesterday. The Buckeye state is now the closest state. Just 0.07 points separate Trump and Biden there right now.

Still not sure how Biden beat him.......
You just hate Trump so you had to say something negative. I bet you have no problem understanding Pelosi and Biden right!
When biden thinks people are mad enough at trump for him to pick clinton and get away with it lol
Because anyone whos watched Biden in front of a camera for more than 3 minutes can see that his age is getting too him rapidly.
After at least a week of not spending money on TV ads, the president's campaign is going to come out with a new set of them next week supposedly attacking an America under Biden.    Um, that is "new?"
You're lying to associate Biden with the Green New Deal.  But thanks for playing.
I mean Biden is a hundred years old and failing so it may matter somewhat
Wow. Really bad poll numbers for Trump. Biden is doing great, leading Trump by far!   not a factor!!!
I fucking hate Biden and I detest Buttar and his workplace discrimination against women should those accusations be true. But they are better than the alternative. Someone on the ballot is gonna win regardless of if you do or don't vote.  Lets make sure the better one wins, yea?
Biden has assembled a foreign policy team that can undo a lot of wrong that Trump has done. He has shown that he more than likely won't try touching the medical care and workplace rights of transfolk that Trump has tried (and sometimes succeeded) tampering with
"No we vote for Biden, he's the same as Trump and he sucks"  "No we can't vote for Shahid Buttar, he's been accused of workplace discrimination"  Biden &gt; Trump and Buttar &gt; Pelosi means we vote that way, that's the end of the discussion imo
Who is joe Biden? Oh is this not a jeopardy answer
Too early. The silent voters need to feel safe to come out only after Biden is the official candidate.
Looking forward to Biden booting you from this job you don't deserve.
#DearMichigan Joe Biden would STILL have the US border open to all travelers from China! I fail to see how he would've gotten private companies to offer  producing PPE, especially when he has people in his ear that think many of those companies shouldn't even exist as they do.
Joe Biden would still have the borders wide open to all travelers from China, but what difference does that make I guess.
Steve Hilton warns Trump campaign is 'sleepwalking into a Biden presidency': 'Wake Up'  #FoxNews

Just because Biden is bad doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not the best person who actually has a chance at winning   I‚Äôd rather argue with and organize against him and the Dems than Trump and the GOP any day of the week. Besides, they‚Äôre closer to us on policy by several miles
And Biden wants to destroy the charter schools that TEACH these basic findamentals
Obama picked Biden August 23, 2008.  Were you concerned then in more than one way? ‚Äò  Your concern concerns me.
Hey Donnie! This is what we know. The repairs to the American Democracy, Economy, Spirit and Rule of Law, all of which you have decimated, will officially commence with the very well attended Inaguration of Joe Biden!#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Agreed.   I think the only way Trump gets Biden on stage is if he provokes him with some grade-A schoolyard taunting.
It will be interesting seeing Trump fight the stacked deck. With Biden being less than functional, you know the moderators will do all they can to tilt the playing field.
SSHHHH. We don't need the reality out yet.   Let's make sure Biden has the nomination first.
Look, provided he doesn't select Jared from Subway as his running mate, I think Biden's good on the VP pick
politically, shouldn't he be stating reasons not to vote for Biden ?
My thoughts are it‚Äôs going to be like two drunken uncles fighting for the last piece of chicken. Still voting for Biden though
Like at least with Biden vs Trump the GARBAGE electoral system means that people not in swing states don't have to worry about their vote mattering but GOD what a shitty deflection from the actual point at hand for folks who use that excuse
Really...he should be out there holding underwhelming rallies, full of people who are too patriotic to protect themselves (and others) from a contagious disease.          Also: ‚Äúbsaement‚Äù Biden? Not nearly as catchy as #BunkerBoyTrump üòÇ
He has also seemed to assemble one of the best foreign policy teams available that could undo a lot of the harm Trump has done for relations over the past 4 years but nah Biden is a shitty person so I guess we shouldn't care
I genuinely do not give half of a fuck if you sleep better at night not voting for Biden over Trump because you tricked yourself into thinking checking a box on a ballot degrades your humanity or whatever but my safety is partially dependant on Biden winning
Unfortunately one of the candidates is going to win and I'd rather it be the lesser of two evils  I can sit here and pretend like Biden v Trump doesn't matter despite Trump literally working to revoke my workplace and medical care rights as a trans person but why would I
Because of the assumption that Biden wants to serve just one term, it's likely that his VP choice would have the top line on the next president. I do not want another celebrity as president.
I hope and pray that Biden wins and I believe he will. However when it comes to which party works for corporations, they both do.
I agree   Biden would rip DT into small shreds.  So the premise of "If Joe Biden refuses to debate..." does not make sense.
I will ONLY vote for Biden if he says ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Pok√©mon Go to the polls‚Äù
Im yanggang but ill be voting libertarian this election would get more of what i want from  than from biden or trump
Only way to make America great again is by getting you out of the White House so Joe Biden can demonstrate real leadership unifying our great country and leading the charm to contain COVID-19, re-engaging our allies and strengthen our economy.
I heard on MSNBC that Biden is afraid to debate you. He needs to be disqualified is he does not want to debate!
Um, I think a Biden win would remove Trump from office. Just saying.
Honestly liberals would get more of what they want from libertarians than democrats or gop at this point end war on drugs end forever wars demilitarize police end corporate welfare all shit neither biden or trump will ever do.
What crimes you ass? Best President Ever. Someday you'll realize what a Danger the DNC is to US! If Biden's elected, there won't be a Country left in 4 yrs. But some of you decide to remain blind.
Just want to watch Biden to blow 45's little mind off the stage.
Biden is expected to begin one-on-one interviews in the coming days.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden if he debates a Yorkshire terrier and loses. Badly.  And I‚Äôd crawl over glass to do so.
Burning Bibles. Burning American flags. Burning American cities. This is the Biden campaign.
As August opens with just 94 days until election day on November 3, Biden starts it with the tipping point state -- PA now -- tilted a but more than 5 points in his direction.
I like to think that all Biden needs to do in January is walk into the Oval Office with Major, his (quite large) German Shepherd, and Trump will run like the coward he is.
TikTok has 800M active users worldwide.  41 percent of TikTok users are aged between 16 and 24.   TikTok has the Highest Social Media Engagement Rates Per Post.  Should tRump ban TikTok in the U.S., he best be prepared to hand Biden a shitload of free ads. #WrathOfTikTok
Now I'm definitely voting Biden üò°
Always vote for who you think should win ive voted libertarian every election and been told i let other person win everytime lol but you know what when biden starts next war or trump does more terrible shit it wont be my fault lol itll be on their voters heads
That would get me to vote biden but as of not im voting for
I supported Yang and his platform of universal basic income. I still see a good soul with Biden. I do not with Trump. And I see a threat to our democracy with trump and especially now with Barr. It‚Äôs not personal...exactly.
Yeah shes not yang but compared to biden or trump its not even close lol
All the polls this week shifted some states around at FHQ, but the work week ended the same as it began: with Biden projected to clear 270 electoral votes on his Strong and Lean states alone.

The more we see Biden and the more we see social unrest, the better Trump will look.
There was finally a polling update out of NH yesterday (along with a couple of backdated releases from UNH). That was enough to shift the Granite state into Lean Biden territory.   PA moved back there too.
This is a rather biased trope. Obama and Biden reduced unemployment left over from 43's housing meltdown and generated economy 45 loves to brag about. So let's look at NOW, shall we? GNP down 33% b/c 45 utterly failed at controlling pandemic.
That will be 9PM Eastern after FL, NC and PA score big Wins for Biden. At that point, the rest will be Karmic icing on the cake!

sounds familiar. Many libs said similar stuff when Clinton was ‚Äú100% gonna win‚Äù then turned around and cried manipulation for years- to the point of impeachment. In the slim chance Trump wins, watch Biden supporters cry voter suppression / ballot manipulation.
You‚Äôre right. RBG should have retired when the Dems controlled the WH+Senate. My point is that anybody who cares about getting a new liberal justice should be doing everything they can to elect Dems. As bad as they are, Biden+the Dems won‚Äôt confirm an anti-Roe judge
We replaced two SCOTUS judges in those two years. If you care about RBG &amp; Breyer &amp; possibly Thomas being replaced by people who won‚Äôt gut Roe v. Wade, then vote for Biden and help to win back the Senate. I don‚Äôt see how voting third party will help to accomplish this
I can if the Dems win the White House+Senate   Unless you think a Democratic majority would vote against Biden‚Äôs SCOTUS pick?
And the RCV proposal fails 154-13 with 4 abstentions. The Biden rep argued that with RCV someone would technically win with an initial plurality of support (which would require rules changes to how the convention in particular chooses a presidential/VP nominee). #DNCRulesMeeting
A Biden rep was against the ranked choice voting amendment, and as a result, we'll likely see a split on this one.  #DNCRulesMeeting
So Biden has Obama holding  a rally during what's supposed to be his funeral. What a POS  the Democratic party is.
Here's a fun one. Proposal to institutionalize the delegate deal hatched between the Biden and Sanders camps. This would get rid of the automatic reallocation of statewide delegates (unless released by the candidate) that has been a part of the rules forever. #DNCRulesMeeting
With all of that out of the way -- and an hour in -- it is onto the rules resolution proposals. Up first is the proposal described here (an agreement between the Biden and Sanders camps). #DNCRulesMeeting
that is because Trumpism is a cult. Joe Biden people don't need to be so overtly obnoxious
If your people don‚Äôt show up on Election Day and your opponents are able to coalesce around and actually for vote for one candidate, that‚Äôs not rigging: that‚Äôs just the nature of elections  I say this as a Bernie supporter in a state that Biden won overwhelmingly
This is the only reason Biden has a chance. The masters of the universe don‚Äôt fear him
When is the first debate? I can‚Äôt wait!
If enough people do it a hell of a lot more than voting for biden
Conversely, now the Democrats will insist on a timely election because Trump opposes it.   Biden officially is nominated.  Trump shows Biden to being incapable of running the country.  The Democrats can not postpone the election to get a lucid candidate.  Trump wins.
debate Biden from computers have them put it on national TV both of you side-by-side screenshots no predetermined. questions ask what you want a debate is necessary for you Mr. President
He would be a HUGE upgrade to someone who had to ask a doctor on NATIONAL TV if ok to inject disinfectant into our bodies!!  You cannot compare the mental capacity of the two. Trump is just plain dumb &amp; has no excuse. Biden was born with a speech impairment &amp; had his entire life.
For the time being, get used to states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin constantly changing categories at FHQ. It isn't so much a function of wild fluctuations as it is their positions in the averages. Each is around that Lean/Toss Up Biden line.
Remember when Biden said something to the effect that Obama was "clean" he suffered for that inappropriate remark for 8 years.
Biden slams Trump for promoting false COVID-19 claims from 'crazy woman'
And until earlier this week, Ohio has been a Biden Toss Up at FHQ. It is just barely a Trump Toss Up in our averages at the moment, only marginally closer than Georgia as of today. Those are the clearest targets if Biden is to go on offense. 2/2
Ohio is next in line in the order for Biden after the six consensus battlegrounds (AZ, FL, MI, NC, PA &amp; WI). 1/
I agree with you mostly, and don't want to vote for Biden, but I fear we will all be dead in 4 years to make a point.
Woo hoo! I‚Äôm voting      Anyone know how Cooper is doing in polls against NO PLAN DAN?
So while Pennsylvania shifted back into Biden Toss Up territory at FHQ just recall that the Keystone state is among a group that is tightly knit around the Lean/Toss Up Biden line. Around 5 points in Biden's direction.
Amen. America 1st. Best President Ever! Reelect  4 more yrs. If Biden is elected we won't recognize US in 4 yrs. The violence he is ignoring now will become the Norm. Marshall law will be necessary. America won't be 1st. He'll finish selling US out to China.
I mean Biden is like a hundred so it might
He's not going to  we're not going to have this under control until we have a President Biden. Flipping the Senate will make it easier as well. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Who should Biden select as has running mate? Harris, Warren or Duckworth? Let us know what you think!
I hate it,but you‚Äôre right.Trump will lose his shit when he loses the election.He‚Äôll scream bloody murder about the election being rigged,corrupt,deep state fix.He‚Äôs already laying the groundwork for his cult members.I doubt there will be a peaceful transition to Biden.biden is pro-abortion so his ‚Äúdevout catholic‚Äù title should automatically be removed
Every time Joe Biden speaks it becomes more obvious that something is not right. It‚Äôs sad that the left hates Trump so much they are willing to put him through all of this it‚Äôs cruel.
Remember when Obama bashed your father because his arms couldn‚Äôt reach the computer to type and other things Obama called your father like Biden as well. All I can say is to you remember lack of disgrace those two showed to your dad

Biden's crime legislation led not only to a doubling of the prison population, but a tripling of federal funding for local law enforcement as well, directly leading to the militarized police force we see today.

Please don‚Äôt DM me telling me that voting for Biden makes me not a Christian and then unfollow me. Thanks üòá
The ban was part of the infamous 1994 crime bill, authored by Biden in conjunction with pro-police lobbyists, which exacerbated mass incarceration.  Biden has (rightfully) expressed regret regarding much of the bill. The assault weapons ban is an inextricable part of its legacy.
Get this one:
I don't know why we have vice presidents. If a president becomes incapacitated or dies, go straight to the speaker of the House. But I do know that as soon as Biden got the nod, he should have picked a VP right then and there.
This absurd list of "reasons" Rice is the pick makes me more confident that it's Harris. 1) Biden also knows Harris well. 2) For VP, Senate experience matters far more than White House experience. 3) That debate moment was political theater. 4) A misdirect right now makes sense.
And yet one of the most qualified candidates to ever run for president lost to him, just like Biden is apparently trying to.   If they aren't going to campaign for a compelling progressive vision for this country, Democrats should just be quiet and let Trump lose this himself.
Well look at that, looks like Trump enjoys bombing Iraq and Syria just as much as Obama did. But go on about Biden.
The Trump campaign has decided to attack Joe Biden as an enemy of religion &amp; the Bible. It‚Äôs a mean-spirited attack, for sure. But it also seems unwise. I‚Äôve rarely heard a politician speak as authenticity as Biden does about the role of his Christian faith in his life.
They're already saying "Why won't Biden lead?!?!?" even though he isn't president.
And I say ‚ÄúChristian imagery‚Äù because faith outreach and Christian outreach aren‚Äôt interchangeable. Biden is pitching a large tent by using moral calls for shared interfaith dignity (see linked statement), but specific Christian themes in his narratives.
is running ads to piss off the President, their strategy is not about making big ad buys to support races in competitive districts or Biden in battleground states, though it happens sometimes.  Way more efficient to donate directly to candidates or their PACs.
The DNC is truly a group of idiots.  1st Hillary, and now Biden?  Hillary being one of the most unlikeable people on the planet and Biden clearly showing Mental Illness.  I don't get it.
Ya, Trump‚Äôs tweet was allll about Kanye, hoping he‚Äôll take votes away from Biden and split the ticket. Which isn‚Äôt racist at all, LOL. Doesn‚Äôt Kaye know he‚Äôs being used?
SE, if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden because of his VP pick after alllll the BS that Trump has done to this country, then you are voting for Trump. Period.  Suck it up and do the right thing. Unbelievable...
What Biden said was IGNORANT, but I‚Äôve seen way too many bad takes. If you are willing to vote for Trump because of what Biden just said, then wait to I show you Trump has been doing for the past three decades üëÄ
How Joe Biden is constantly fucking up the Black vote being handed to him on a silver platter is absolutely beyond me.  Mr. Magoo looking ass boy.

Nope. He didn't.
There is no amount of mental gymnastics the Biden campaign can do to explain away this racism. Wow.

If you ‚Äúwant to vote for Biden‚Äù then vote for Biden. If you want to grandstand and spew bullshit...well, seems like you‚Äôve got that covered.
Biden can say as much as he wants.  Unfortunately he has an extensive record of doing the opposite and supporting/passing legislation that harms people and increases profits.  I dont trust him or anyone around him, simple as that.
I love the show, but your teaser talking about Biden gaffe and not adding Trump with his crazy remarks in OH was inappropriate.
Interesting that Cupp would vote for Biden with Harris but not with Rice. I wonder how many other anti-Trump Republicans agree.  Of course, it's foolish. If you're a Never Trump conservative, it must be because you recognize the existential threat he poses. Vote Biden either way.
when discussing polls, I've heard there's low democratic enthusiasm for voting for Biden. Has anyone asked the enthusiasm level for voting out trump? I'm low-moderate on the former, high on the latter.

Biden is much more popular among older people than Hillary was, and Florida has a lot of those. Makes sense when you add that demographic advantage over Hillary + (hopefully) a wider national margin and you have blue Florida.

Maybe the polls are more accurate this time at the state level, maybe Biden maintains a big national lead that allows for these clear but not overwhelming wins.    I‚Äôm def more cautious than that model.
At the height of Biden‚Äôs numbers so far, he‚Äôs led in these 2 states by no more than 4, currently less than that in AZ.    State polls less frequent and reliable than state polls, Hillary posted similar state-level polling leads in several states that didn‚Äôt materialize.

I don‚Äôt think you can claim Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a racist, then look at his record with a straight face.
Hypothetical: Rob Portman retires in 2022. President Joe Biden has a national approval rating of around 48 approve/50 disapprove. Republicans decide to nominate Jim Jordan for Senate and Democrats nominate Tim Ryan. Who wins the Senate election?
I'm voting for Biden.     I saw the "not going to take a cocaine test" "are you a junkie" comments. They made me cringe. I wish he'd stop trying to be "cool" ("...then you ain't black") and just answer yes or no questions with yes or no.
Thoughts about Biden: 1) I think he'll be a great president. 2) I'm confident he'll surround himself with highly qualified, capable people. 3) I wish he'd think a bit more before he speaks sometimes. 4) He definitely needs a Black woman as his running mate.
That's more likely with Biden than it is for Trump, without a doubt.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
If you take this at face value, you are just asserting a Biden blowout. There isn't really a battleground. Don't take this at face value.  I'll take an example: I'll believe Biden win's NC on election day and not a day sooner.
seeing biden in the news
Fucking fuck fuck. And fuck you if you are wavering on voting for Biden. Yet another reason I‚Äôm trying to get citizenship in another country. Too many selfish fucks in this stupid country. I‚Äôm tired of seeing it and reading it on Twitter. My tweets next yr? Ciao Mofos.
I think that's called a Biden presidency.
Apparently when Joe Biden becomes president a Bill of Rights amendment will be invalidated "immediately and without notice".  This nonsense could be refuted by any D student in a high school civics class.  All Republicans have is scare tactics. Unfortunately, they work.
I ordered my mail-in/absentee ballot yesterday. I will be voting for Mr. Biden. You, Mr. Trump, have been a total waste of 4 years as US President and of 74 years as a human being -- I'm guessing, "human being."
No democrat is going to take away guns so stop lying to everyone.  And Biden is NOT going to take any guns
love your ad about Biden raising taxes. You need to run an ad about the deficit that Trump has exploded due to his reckless behavior.
Not surprised a bit that ‚Å¶ photoshopped these images. It‚Äôs in the same vein of those ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs America‚Äù ads that that try to terrify viewers using actual footage from Trump‚Äôs America.
Re: POTUS‚Äô Biden will ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù comment.  Biden has been running more Christian imagery (praying, mostly) in his ads than any Democratic general election candidate I can remember. Kerry didn‚Äôt at all, Obama did to a decent extent, Clinton not so much.
TRUMP CLAIMS BIDEN IS ‚ÄúAGAINST GOD‚Äù, BIDEN CAMPAIGN¬†RESPONDS
So...are we done with him now?
No, he's hoping that BIPOC Democrats will write in Kanye, rather than vote for Biden.
Jeez Trump, I'm already voting for the guy. You don't gotta keep selling Biden to me.
They were worried about Trump and the Nuclear Football.   Come on, man' you can't give the Football to Biden.  He might start the apocalypse!
The chryon says you‚Äôre talking about the economy, but all I hear is talk of how Biden is against God. Really? Against God? Ohhhkay, then. And I‚Äôm against Xenu.
PROFESSOR WHO PREDICTED EVERY ELECTION SAYS BIDEN WILL BEAT¬†TRUMP
I be damn Biden!!!  No man is above the law!!!
Kanye West openly admits here that he has not abandoned Trump, has no intention to win and wants only to hurt Joe Biden. A shocking and, given he said one month ago he was actually abandoning Trump, dishonest turn to the right. I have to ask: who paid Kanye‚Äôs debt?
God must not be as all powerful as all of the Bible verses say he is.  Or else Biden is really that damn powerful.  Either way, why would ANYONE listen to Donald f‚Äôing Trump about anything that has to do with Christianity?  He‚Äôs the most morally bankrupt man to ever hold office.
Of course it is. Democrat who has repeatedly said she is going to take out the NRA targets the most powerful gun lobby right as Biden announces he plan to attack gun rights?
Joe Biden shut the fuck up 2020 challenge
trump or biden, either way nos va cargar la berga compa
I said this exact thing to my friend so thought Republicans would vote for Klobuchar.  Every time it‚Äôs Lucy and the football.  I said in august they‚Äôd start talking pro choice and prominent Republicans would say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt vote for Biden ‚Äú.  Always the same story

BULLSHIT. Don't listen to this crap.  VOTE BIDEN!
Hold up Biden is Lord Asriel???
All Biden had to do was drop out and admit he doesn‚Äôt give a shit about anything besides getting trump out of office.
I would vote for Biden no matter whom he chose!!!!
Joe Biden with the Nuclear Football.    Bidens finger on the the button! I am truly afraid!!!   He could start a Nuclear War while looking for his tapioca pudding.

The debates with Biden are going to be painful to watch. The gaffes/minute will leave us all with heads in our hands.
Is it wrong of me if I say that Biden should talk less and smile more?
Biden is "against God", says the guy who is all in with Satan.
That is pathetic. Biden/Dead Horse would get my vote, 110%.
The over-70 crowd in my neighborhood is all in on Biden. Shirts, hats and bumper stickers everywhere.
By applying that to NC, which has Biden +2, we set our expectations at Tr*mp +3 instead.
I have invented a statistic to keep my election expectations in check. Basically, I look at the 538 number for Florida, then subtract it from all their other calculations. The Florida Adjusted Information Level.   Right now Biden is +5.1 there according to 538, so the FAIL is 5.1
Comrade Biden is finally on board with our plan to attack and dethrone god
The poll doesn't work. It leaves out important candidates. I will vote for neither Biden nor Trump, but I'm not undecided. I'm voting for
Biden will lose for the following reasons:  1) Limited passion for Joe by his base.  Opposite on the Trump side 2) Civil unrest works against Biden and not for him given the Dem views on policing 3) The Debates: Trump should dominate 4) The cognitive issue  5) AA% inc for Trump
My favorite Trump campaign attack against Biden is still the one that said "we can't risk electing the oldest president ever elected" even though if Trump won he would also be the oldest president ever elected.   It really encapsulates the overall BS of Trumpism.
Biden is not progressive. In fact, the Democratic Party is soft on every progressive issue that truly matters. Not just soft, truly squishy.
Biden, so strong he can hurt God!
Idk where these people get off with their "Trump is the worst president ever but if Biden doesn't satisfy my very arbitrary desires I guess it's a wash" bullshit.
Between the ‚ÄúBiden hurts God‚Äù and ‚ÄúLatinos are diverse, unlike blacks‚Äù riffs today, really makes you wonder if it‚Äôs time for faithless electors to do their duty.
Clinton was out reminding people why they hate her for months by this time. Biden's hidin'. That's not going to help his numbers.    1st week of 11/16 you were saying Hispanic support for Clinton was up. Trump outperformed  McCain and has higher support with minorities NOW.
Just wondering your thoughts on Biden‚Äôs VP pick ...also, tomorrow‚Äôs lottery numbers? #ClaireVoyant #psychichotline
Kamala will probably be spending a lot of time in the Senate, whether she is Biden‚Äôs pick or not
If Biden made this part of his campaign from the beginning, I might have been more excited voting for him.
With every such utterance, he shows how much contempt he has for his constituents, not one of whom believes Biden or anyone else can "hurt God."
Biden rockets to victory after arriving to the debate conscious and standing upright
Relax bro, Biden is actually pretty moderate.
Uh, it ain't just the South, dude.  Check the crosstabs here, for instance: Trump winning NY white voters by 1%.
I can't believe Joe Biden isn't watching I May Destroy You because I feel like they just covered this whole topic.
Trump is ridiculous. Joe Biden is a Catholic.
Joe Biden is anti-black. There is no way around it.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs against God. He‚Äôs against guns.‚Äù?!?! Is tRump suggesting that God is for guns?  And to be absolutely certain, Biden certainly has more Christ-like qualities than devilish divisive tRump regardless of religious beliefs. If any evangelicals fall for D‚Äôs con, the Devil smiles.
If the cross, death, and the grave couldn't hurt God what makes you believe Joe Biden can???
Biden will hurt God? Powerful guy I guess.
Follow up to this. Early days ppl said Trump was archie bunker racist. kinda held onto stereotypes but really didn't think anything of them or have malicious intent. I don't think that framework quite holds anymore.  Is it a better framework for Biden. I'm thinking it might be
If he could not be him, Biden's gaffe's would actually have runway. But you're seriously gonna counter with this foolishness. Come on man
If Biden wins, I'm going to have to spend a lot of time considering whether than amount of grace I give Biden's verbal flubs makes sense in light of the amount or lack of grace I gave Trump's flubs.  There is a difference, but it's a worthy thought experiment to do continually
Hahahah exactly. They would put the KKK hat on him and post this video everywhere. When its biden, let it slip, he cool.
Michigan doesn't want Lumpy Trump.  Michigan wants Biden to heal the country.  His ability to drink water from a glass one-handed is just a bonus.
Joe Biden is asking for Chic-fil-A level grace
Biden is a politician so obviously stuck in the 70s and 80s.  His solutions now are to double down on the "solutions" and policies that got us I to iur current predicament in many ways.  21st century issues require 21st century solutions, not a dinosaur.
Trump‚Äôs position is incredibly weak and his recent interviews show that he utterly incapable of defending his actions or the current state of the country. He might believe that he can beat Biden, or that he‚Äôs got some trick up his sleave, but he‚Äôs wrong.
I honestly don‚Äôt understand this thinking. Biden most definitely should debate Trump. Rile him up, step back and let him self-immolate. The only reason Biden shouldn‚Äôt is if he can‚Äôt handle it for some reason, but that‚Äôs a different problem entirely.
Lyin' Joe Biden, scrambling to cover his arse.
I don‚Äôt fuck with Biden Or Trump. Biden getting my vote though, dat boy trump gotta get the fuck up outta there.
Zooming out a little bit though, doesn‚Äôt this argument extend to Medicaid as a whole program, not just the Biden plan stuff?
You are ignoring what I said ! Can you tell me anything Biden has accomplished and that he is not a racist or is either of these two things not important to you?
Twitter &amp; Facebook's action on removing Trump's misinformation about covid shows that they DO have the capacity to act swiftly and the appetite for removal.  NOW DO ELECTION MISINFORMATION - per your OWN policies
Sherrell it‚Äôs been proven to you by many of Biden‚Äôs videos that not only is he incompetent he is a proven racist!   Now if you can tell me anything Biden has accomplished other than being Obama‚Äôs side kick in his 47 years of public service I am listening!
If you can listen to Biden with his continued incoherent ramblings and still entertain voting for him then you have more issues than can be corrected.
The only piece I've seen on this thus far: he took more votes from trump than Biden
This pathetically desperate and also laughable. Joe Biden is a radical?! The party‚Äôs nominee illustrates the CURRENT direction of the party. Lumping him in with the committed left is going to require quite the con job.
But I am assured by well meaning liberals that "it cant happen here" and Biden will save us all.
Who‚Äôs getting excited to hear Biden‚Äôs VP pick? Any guesses? ü§î #2020Election #Biden #VicePresident #dukeblue #anydaynow
Honest question. Does Biden have a realistic plan to fix the eviciton and homeless crisis?  That is, does he have a plan to house people who have no reaoruces and no jobs?  And if its "give more money to police to round up the 'criminals'" Thats not a good plan.
That‚Äôs actually the least of the things about Biden that bother me.
This progressive isnt convinced Biden is a worthwhile candidate. I was told Bernie was too old, I am selfish for supporting M4A, i dont vote anyways so I dont matter among hundreds of insults and now this. That bridge was burned in the primaries.
With 88 days to go until Trump's reelection, Biden's handlers have still not been able to select a running mate for him.   They have, however picked a campaign theme song: "Nowhere Man" by the Beatles.
The round about argument from ‚ÄúVote for Biden please‚Äù to ‚Äúyou dont even vote we dont need you‚Äù is hilarious to watch
The Biden campaign announced today that the former V.P. won't be travelling to Milwaukee for the Democratic convention, presumably to reassure foreign donors that there will not be any live mic moments or creepy sniffing of his as yet unnanounced running mate at the convention.
What if Biden gave $280 million to charities helping feed and home people?  Our politics are absolutely asinine.  Worthless.  At least Roman senators built public works and temples.  And dont "its against campaign law"  Yea I know, law doesnt matter now.
Biden Leading Trump Among Voters Who Favor Being Alive  via

indeed - he's being used as a willing spoiler to draw votes from Biden
Biden has been known as a gaffe machine for a long time.
Trump makes at least 20 false claims in Fox interview, and of course the incompetents at  don‚Äôt correct him. They run the clip again later. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
You know why Biden won the primary in NC?  And Bernie didn't?  Because the Bernie's voters didn't show up to vote.  Sure there was a lot of shit talking about how the Democrats "hate the left...". But the reality is the Bernie voters didn't go vote, and not just here in NC.
I think Biden didn‚Äôt give a full context in his comment and I think that neither did poltifact. I didn‚Äôt say anyone lied except Tulsi Gabbard. Are you a bot? Often bots struggle with nuance and aim for these attack lines without substantative prose. That‚Äôs how the algo works.
This is absolutely horrifying to consider the implications of, even if Biden is elected as President. This could end up destroying the Internet as-is.
Shirtless Biden Washes Trans Am In White House Driveway
Biden's been getting a lot of campaign mileage out of hanging back and not really drawing attention to himself. He should probably stick to that approach.
Um...yall were just yelling that Kanye was gonna steal votes from Biden just because he was black.
I'd rather have a Biden/Beavis &amp; Butthead Ticket that Harris.  I'll repeat ya, GOD NO  #BidenWarren2020
It‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm pointing out that Biden‚Äôs campaign didn‚Äôt have $ until he basically swept the race for delegates. Sorry if I didn‚Äôt elaborate I just get bored telling the story of reality to people who should know how to google.
Uh Biden campaign was broke by Super Tuesday. This is just more vague ‚Äúinstitution‚Äù talk when you don‚Äôt even know what the word ‚Äúinstitution‚Äù means. This is why you‚Äôre dudes to me. Go ahead and just rant about ‚ÄúThe Man.‚Äù
üôÑ Rose twitter has been holding their votes for Biden hostage, ignoring the shifts in policy already made via working w/Sanders. I brought up Bernie‚Äôs lost bc your ‚Äúwe want structural change‚Äù is just starting to sound like a tantrum.
We already know the pre-determined results: aimed at Comey, McCabe, Strozk, Page, Orh, Brennan, Clapper, Obama, Biden and maybe Yates and Rice.

The Onion was right all along!   Diamond Joe Biden 2020!!!!
Yes but I also believe that there are obvious reasons why ALL of the open white supremacist groups are behind trump. If there‚Äôs no difference between biden/trump then the white supremacists wouldn‚Äôt have a favorite. Trump is their guy for a reason despite biden being racist too
Do you think that Biden would be able to get away with using the military against protestors?  Do you think that Biden would be in with these white supremacist militia groups?   Do you think that Biden could get away with openly trying to suppress the black vote?
Joe Biden: *drives a corvette with a brooks brothers polo, hint of nearby grill*  Fox News: ‚Äúcultural Marxist Joe Biden wants to outlaw white people‚Äù
Biden for sure. Trump's been fattening up...
I'd like Biden to keep his promise about the VP slot, but yes I'll vote for him whatever.
Saw your Biden tax ad. Let's see higher taxes with Biden or death with Trump? Trump has killed 160000 Americans and completely fucked President Obama's economy and you're okay with that?
It doesn't matter who he picks. Lots of things he has done should be illegal. Trump must not be allowed the see the inside of the Oval Office for another four years, and Biden shouldn't be allowed to see it either.
Grow a soul Ms Frizzle.  It‚Äôs not like Biden is somehow unaware Americans need healthcare.  It‚Äôs a central pillar of his campaign.
This is an edited photo of Biden sitting on the floor during a campaign event in a voter's home in Iowa. Report this tweet.
Just wait till Biden stsrts comforting them that he wont let "antifa" come to the suburbs either.
45's campaign will find something like this (or worse) to spin for each and every one of Biden's potential running mates with a misogynistic cherry on top.
I'm not a Biden supporter. I'm an Anti-Trump supporter. I'm not against Biden. I just know that his VP pick better be what's best for the NEXT generation. Then that VP better be good enough to check Biden for the next four years to set things in place for 2024.
Could there honestly be a worse candidate for this moment than a racist, old white guy who eulogizes segregationists, goes to bat for credit card companies, would VETO #M4A and wouldnt ban fracking?  Am I taking crazy pills or what?

Or diverting our attention from something.  Between the Booms and FBI raids, I think it‚Äôs all pointing to Biden.  I ha e a feeling they are going to nail him up.
They want Biden to say no just so they can say he said no
Is that a quote from the Biden interview earlier?
If elected president, Joe Biden said he would not tear down the parts of the barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border built by Trump's administration. But he would end construction.  "There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration."
They are both working harder to elect Biden than Biden
Lmfao and then they downgraded him to Potsie. üíÄ
I hate that America picked two folks, that we wouldn‚Äôt let drive cars if they were regular folks, to possibly control the country. Y‚Äôall know y‚Äôall took the keys from granny at 70. Biden 77! Slip and fall would take him out.

Hey all, def a progressive Dem here, def voting for Biden/whichever amazing woman is the VP pick, AND wanted to just ask for some empathy for those of us that had relatives gassed and cremated by the Nazis (Irma Behlow, 1940, my great-great-aunt). Thanks y'all.
Are... you calling a Black woman racist!
I didn‚Äôt vote for Biden. If you wanted a progressive president you should have chosen a more effective figurehead. Don‚Äôt blame me you chose a losing horse.
Good perspective on the upcoming presidential election.
Biden and his coronation did more to harm the progressive movement than arguing on Twitter.  Biden ideologcially is a neoconservative in all but name.
Sorry that you've been sold on a lie, but there is no "Radical Left" in the US. That is a myth.  Not even commenting on the rest of your reply because I don't understand how people continue to criticize Biden for flaws Trump also has, except way worse.
The DNC and their donors are using the same game plan and same strategy as 2016 and will lose.  Biden cant even embrace meaningful climate mitigation strategies like ban frackingor , decriminalize weed, or raise taxes on the wealthy, or medicare for all.  He doesnt represent me.
The dnc picked the worst candidate with the worst policies and are relying on marginal "never trumpers" instead of building an enthusiastic coalition.   Biden isnt even campaigning. Hes advertising.   There gonna lose against Trump and its 100% the DNC and their puppeteers fault.
I'm gonna be blunt.  Biden, his team, and the DNC are a joke.  They are running Biden cause the "donors" can control Biden.  Biden is visibly unfit to lead people through this crisis and an ineffective poltician constantly on the wrong side of history. Apalling and embarrassing.
that joe biden sucks

I was just reading the Shaun king thread and the tv interview...  Its embarrassing... Trying to convince/gaslight reasonable people that Biden is our only choice.  Biden is a joke. And no ones laughing.

The only reason Biden won‚Äôt debate Trump is because Trump does nothing but lie and distort the truth and it would be a painful exercise in fact checking to do so.  Besides, he‚Äôs already way up in the polls. Why should he waste his time on someone who‚Äôs already lost the election?
Someone needs to make this a Biden Commercial.
So if Biden wins, will he stay in his basement too?

I'm not sure how much to credit this piece, but they say that the campaign's "case for Rice" is that she'll ensure the enthusiastic support of the Obamas. Like Barack and Michelle are gonna sit on their hands and let Trump win regardless of Biden's running mate. Much less Harris.
this man is a spoiler being used to draw votes from Biden
On cable it‚Äôs even  for me, maybe slightly more trump. But if I‚Äôm using watching something on a streaming channel it‚Äôs 100% Biden.
I don‚Äôt even really watch cable, I use streaming services, and EVERY SINGLE ad break is three Biden ads in a row.
Anyone else play Four Tops, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there‚Äù and imagine Joe Biden singing it to them?
We will, by voting for Biden!!
I read this on Newsweek though.  I was just making a joke about it.
He absolutely should apologize for it and do better. I think he'll apologize. He probably won't do better...   It's not ideal but Trump won't even apologize so Biden wins on points. Wanna win on points, get Trump to apologize for anything.
Yeah, we're seeing the part of Biden that is a bad candidate here. Let's not sugarcoat that. He has plenty of upside. This is a bad side.  But also, if Trump had said this to a journalist the right would be gleeful that he owned the media. This isn't a serious critique from them
The definition of false equivlance is comparing Biden's answer on mental fitness question to Trump interview with Swan.  Not arguing it was ideal. But they are only the same if you have an added variable for disdain for Biden/Democrats.

Here you go that Biden understands what going on in America (with women) much more than Trump. Biden announced in July platform, if elected a $775B Plan to boost the caregiver economy, support In-Home Care Providers
Run this in NC. It seems like  and  are on the air 1/3 or 1/4 as much as the Republicans. Maybe that's just digital and streaming but it's a wide variance. And Biden and Cal are being smeared in the meantime.
We‚Äôre working on that.  Donate to the Biden campaign, America, and keep organizing to vote Trump out of office.
This is why we need a literacy test for POTUS candidates. The Biden campaign should just play this on a loop until November 3
I mean, the Axios interview is like a preview. All Biden has to do is state the facts, and Donnie is toast.
Spoiler alert: he calls it for Biden! "He Predicted Trump‚Äôs Win in 2016. Now He‚Äôs Ready to Call 2020." Video with his 13 keys to predict presidential wins/losses. Go, Allan!
Biden's political instincts are so bad or just so finely tuned to what oligarchy wants.  I wouldnt vote for him to represent me in the best of times, let alone worst of times.
Trump surrogates keep talking about Biden's basement but it's clearly projection about the White House Hurt Feelings Wuss Bunker that the Tangerine Libertine hid in during the gentlest protests in US history

If Biden wins in November, they stop immediately as he begins ‚Äúthe healing process‚Äù üòÜ. If Trump wins, they‚Äôll be ratcheted up continuously for the next 4 years.
Serious question: are there actually people who would decide to vote for Kanye who currently plan to vote for Biden? I just don‚Äôt see that. Seems like he‚Äôd be more likely to siphon votes from Trump.
Democrat Party HQ doesn‚Äôt even have Biden‚Äôs name on display ü§£üòÇ
Biden was one of the Dems I stated I'd vote for he were the nominee. His cognitive abilities seem to have declined significantly and his platform has been hijacked. I may take a chance that he's still a centrist (&amp; just lying to keep the socialist wing of the D party engaged).
Ugh she said ‚Äúso conservative.‚Äù üôÑ I like her. She‚Äôs a great representative, works hard, and I think I‚Äôm progressive. But progressives need to appreciate pragmatic progress. Biden‚Äôs agenda is one a progressive should look forward to, as was HRC‚Äôs. It‚Äôs def not ‚Äúconservative‚Äù wth

Trump's campaign ads are "THE RADICAL LEFT HAS TAKEN OVER JOE BIDEN AND AMERICA!!!1". The sort of hyperbolic projection we've come to be used to while he deploys troops to "declare victory" over his own constituents. This political polarization will end badly.

I'm thinking there's a sizable group of dipshit libs and centrists that are only involved in the blm protests to the extent that it's a repudiation of trump. I won't be surprised if they start telling everyone to shut the fuck up after they get the keys to power when Biden wins.
If Joe Biden is elected, I have no doubt Christians will still be able to sing in our churches when it's safe to gather. But more of us will have access to healthcare, living wages, public education &amp; clean water. Which will be another reason to sing our praises to God.
I do know most of my twitter friends are dealing with loved ones who are Trump supporters. I am trying not to sit here crying about all my YAY BIDEN WEAR A PANTSUIT AND TAKE A DRONE PHOTO family members.
Biden accepted the debates over a month ago. Stop lying. Also, eat less, exercise more.
Joe Biden? Former VP Joe Biden?  Is he really different on whatever planet you're tweeting from?
Who‚Äôs #KarenBass? (not one of those Karens.)  Potential VP pick. I like ‚Å¶ but if I had to settle, someone with a #healthcare background who‚Äôs known for working across the aisle would be OK.
Agreed. Although given the number of debates in Democratic primaries not sure Biden and exposure to live debates is an unknown. His debate performance ahead of South Carolina was one reason for momentum there.
ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST JILL BIDEN, WHY DID DANA PERINO OF FOX&amp;FRIENDS, HAVE BIDENS WIFE ON. SHE KNOWS SHE WILL LIE ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S MIND. HE WILL BE 4YRS OLDER THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP. BIDEN HAS MEDICAL PROBLEMS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT. THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM FOR BIDEN.

Trump now encourages only citizens of Florida to vote by mail, hours after Politico published polls showing Trump‚Äôs attacks on mail-in voting are making only his voters, not Biden‚Äôs, more skeptical. Trump voters skew older and more vulnerable to Covid-19 fears on Election Day.

I'll step aside while you tilt and windmills on twitter, my man. I'm trying to dig it up, but somewhere in this thread I said I would vote for Biden.  But it's not something I do lightly, and it's even harder when people like you are out for a fight with anyone you disagree with

Facebook is stacked with ads from "Republican Voters Against Trump" featuring people explaining that they voted for him, but now they don't like him and they're voting for Biden. They're all white, mostly claim Christianity, and it's mostly his attitude/demeanor they object to.
Sanders acknowledged Sanders lost  Sanders endorsed Biden  Sanders encouraged his supporters to do the same  If you trust Sanders's judgment, then re-litigating the primary at this stage is a bit pointless
So what you are saying is that everyone in the country who won't vote for Biden for any reason is an idiot?
So if Biden wins, but I didn't vote, then I helped Biden win?
I generally do not support Gileadean policy, but maybe after Biden's inauguration, we can have one little particicution, as a treat.
I mean, literally this isn't the case.  Are people who would have voted Trump and are sitting out, or voting libertarian, defacto voting for Biden?  You have to assume that Biden gets everyones vote by default for that logic to work.
They won't pick Trump over Biden.  I know it's hip these days to say you support Trump if you don't vote for Biden, but that's never how elections have worked.  And yes, they would have voted for a progressive and not a moderate republican.  Not that weird
0%. The only ones who won't vote for Biden were never going to vote for any Dem who wasn't Bernie   Everyone else will crawl across crushed glass and hot coals to vote against Trump
It wasn't fully clear even after Super Tuesday, although it was a long shot. By then we had the Biden camp actively encouraging people to go to the polls during the pandemic. Sanders isn't perfect.  I will never forgive Biden for sending his voters out to die so he could win.
Well for starters, if he gets prosecuted under state law (which the state of NY was already doing), Biden can't do shit even if he wants to.  Second, he's gotten FDR delusions recently. I hope he's reading up on FDR's "Blame absolutely everything on Hoover" strategy.
He could say American died at all in his time as president and the moderators would go "Mr. Biden, your thoughts?"
Listened this morning and bought 14/1 on the VP announcement happening after the 17th. I like the theory that Biden‚Äôs going to announce it on the anniversary of the 19th Amendment...
Biden is nothing more than an irrelevant placeholder. Lawrence Tribe, far left Harvard prof, let the strategy out of the bag. Go to  and read the article 'The Real Reason Democrats are Pushing for Mail-In Ballots'.
Why Has Explicit Anti-Semitism At A UNC/Duke Conference About Gaza Been Ignored By The Media? ‚Å¶ ‚Å¶ ‚Å¶ NC Jews are outraged Joe Biden would listen to Linda Sarsour‚Äôs lies. We have extended video.
I think he's more focused on his successful efforts to roll back Biden's 1994 crime bill, which incarcerated a generation of black males, and minority unemployment, which he helped reduce to the lowest level since tracking began.
Actually frankly 20% of the remainder act exactly the same except about "ridin' with biden" and being anti-GMO, so...
I don't have an absolute nope. I'm voting for Biden even if his running mate is a balloon with a face drawn on it in Sharpie.  But of the names being mentioned, Warren is by far the worst pick.
Trump outflanks Biden on left.  DHS/goons are sent in to guard polls.  Normal everyday voter suppression is turned up to 11.  USPS breaks early October.  White suburbs can vote easily, and scared of "antifa", they reelect Trump.  Trump pulls a Buttiegieg election night.
You think Democrats could have any humility and say the things they did during Obamas time were pretty bad and a lot of those policies lead us here.  Even having Biden apologize for being on the wrong side of history would go a long way.  But nope, vote shame is name of the game.
Like especially when they are very clewrly spitting in our faces.  The DNC/Biden campaign has a clear strategy to court neoconservative never trumpers, corporate lobbyists, lawyers, Wall St... And not a bit of good faith outreach to the left.
Wizard of oz circus shit going on.  Biden has told numerous people of you dont like Bidens policies to not vote for him.  So im not voting for him or Trump.
Tell Joe Biden: Make Abortion Access for All* A Top Priority
I'll add, in my personal opinion, that I think Biden wants to be seen as more independent of Obama. Choosing an Obama administration official as his highest-profile pick would make it seem like he's not capable of choosing his own people.
Oh no, it‚Äôs a planned scenario to get the vp in they really want as president. Biden said it would be a woman of color!
If I was Joe Biden...I wouldn't say a word... Four years of persistent incompetence has said enough
Some conservatives are talking about Biden skipping the debates like they are trying to manifest it
Bernie is imploring people to vote for Biden. There are no excuses anymore.
reads more like 'any port in a storm' they look like crap, and have nothing substantive to attack Biden with, so they dreamed this up
Biden's strategy is working out, isn't it?
Activists and Asheville tell me that they wouldn't give üí©üí© if it was a Biden sticker. That aside, why isn't anyone questioning that this is an inside job? Who just walks up to a bear and slaps a sticker on its' tracking colli? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden will deal with this competently.
"If Biden wins he'll be dead before his term is up."
Oh they do have a trick up their sleeve. They hired 600 lawyers to gum up the elections results until Jan 20, 2021 at which time Pelosi becomes President if neither Trump or Biden have the advantage. Therefore Biden is merely a placeholder.
Biden is kicking your ASS right now. Why change? YOU'RE the one that need more debates, not Joe. You are truly desperate. You have nothing.
Biden should definitely not debate. Why bother? He‚Äôd spend the whole time refuting the lying freak show that is Trump.
On Zoom with the church's stockbroker (who is very good). He says we can expect an inflationary bull market with significant volatility over the next 12-18 months. Oh, and Wall Street is betting on a win for Biden in the general election.
Secret Service released Hunter Biden‚Äôs trips he took with security detail while his daddy was VP...he was busy üßê
I mean they are gonna put her in as vp to brainless biden
I know that could be different this year. There's a much greater than normal chance that Biden goes 4 years and drops, meaning whomever is in the VP seat has a line to succeed him.  But it's not a given.
A record high for the Nasdaq ‚Äòwould all come crashing down,‚Äô says Trump in a tweet, ‚Äòincluding your jobs, stocks, and 401(k)s,‚Äô if Biden wins presidency
The cheek caressing &amp; the touchy hugging of kids in that video make me so sick. I remember that feeling of wanting to scream but not knowing I could. It‚Äôs horrifying to watch.   I‚Äôll crawl over broken glass to vote for Biden but I wish I didn‚Äôt have to.
Really? It‚Äôs already abundantly clear that Trump is completely unqualified, while Biden is a proven leader with a sound mind &amp; a good heart.
Biden won't debate. duh
i know March was a lifetime ago but the goldfish memory thing is still annoying. people said the same thing was going to happen with Biden's one-on-one debate with Sanders
uh yeah the ENTIRE WORLD knows Biden can't speak. LOL
Biden is terrified...of his image in the mirror
Lets have a moratorium on "biden VPs" and just cover this for a while.
üë§: Is there a dem presidential candidate you would have preferred over Biden?  üë¥üèº: I voted for Elizabeth Warren. Frankly any of the Democrats are better than Trump ‚Äì I will be voting for Biden ‚Äì but generally prefer candidates with deep policy chops
What is Biden fighting for again?
Guess the people we will be bombing under Biden dont count as people...
Alright, just to be clear a lot of liberals who would never support positions AD holds were tweeting "What does Angela David know that you don't?" When she publicly endorsed Biden. Fine. This has nothing to do with what she thinks about Avakian or Maoism, it is ab the libs.
Given how many people the DNC is choosing to leave out of its platform it's more like a series of rather large umbrellas than a tent.  I have no idea who a Bob Akavian of Joe Biden is supposed to appeal to but uh, sure...
üë§: Even if Biden wins and there‚Äôs a relatively smooth transition of power, is there any hope of us actually getting back to a government that functions?  üë¥üèº: Not any time soon, no
üë§: Do you give any credence to the notion that the DNC picked Biden as a patsy, to lose the election, to avoid taking responsibility for what about to happen with...  üë¥üèº: No. Biden won the primary because Sanders failed to win over African-Americans
Just realized that Biden still has to do debates this fall, and suddenly I don't feel he can amass a polling lead large enough to make me comfortable
Well, I think you might be giving the other side too much credit here. The issue with Biden is not simply that he is not a "perfect" candidate.
Just about everything I've seen for Biden has been 'Not Trump'.  It's enough to get my one vote, but not much else.  Here's a look at Biden's current proposals and...this is actually not a bad look for him.
"Grace is to Trump what garlic is to vampires."  Trump Doesn‚Äôt Like What He Sees in the Crystal Ball
Agree with the NYT on this one -- they are unrevealing quip contests.  Trump is terrible at debates, so I would have thought that the right would be happy with this one.  I, for one, would LOVE to see the contrast in physical fitness between energetic Biden and Lumpy Trump.
Wow GOP, you really have nothing. Pure desperation. Not a SINGLE issue, just attacks.
We had 8 years of Obama/Biden and it never crashed once. Steady growth, consistency...all without YOUR drama. Get a life, you're going to need one.
Meh. Save your money Trump. We are going to #TurnNCBlue. Biden is up in the polls, and will remain there. Say goodbye to #OneTermThom as  takes his senate seat. #ncpol #ncsen #NorthCarolina
Report: Biden Will Roll Back Israel to Pre-Trump Days
Since I think veepstakes coverage is silly, I hope Biden just drags it out and leads people on until November 2 before he announces. Media people would hyperventilate about it, and basically no one else would care.
Opinion | Biden‚Äôs Quietly Radical Care Plan  #caregivers    #dementia
What is up with Ed Rendell?  What a misogynist!  Biden would do well to rid himself of this man and Chris Dodd. They are fossils. Dems equivalence of GOP old white men and a bad look for the party.
Conservatives seem skeptical of another poll showing Biden leading in NC, but several major trends are driving the shift in the state.  #NCPOL
The good news for those folks - if they get their way and Biden isn't elected, they'll probably never need to worry about voting again...
Good to know they exist. But I've started having this discussion with various friends around the country. Everybody has seen lots of Trump signs, but when asked, people struggle to recall seeing any Biden signs or materials.
Biden needs to renew the call for disclosure of Trump's taxes  now that Rudy has advised us the audit is over. No debates until he produces taxes.
say what you will, the democratic primary did a great job of making sure that no one could possibly believe the attack line that joe biden is a tool of the radical left. this line of attack is doa.
I don‚Äôt understand the strategy behind painting Joe Biden - Joe. Biden. - as some kind of radical leftist. I don‚Äôt know if anyone other than the cultiest of the Trump cultists who will buy this. Joe has been a defined national figure for 40 years. This won‚Äôt work.
NPR just reported on an Ohio poll that shows Biden up only 46-42. We have the electoral college.
they would say Biden is up in the polls, as intended
Yeah, funny how Biden supporters don‚Äôt stand in large gatherings on roads and highways. Must have something to do with IQ?
Well, at least there are Trump signs around. I live in a very blue part of a swing state, and I've yet to see a single Biden sign, bumper sticker, or any other campaign paraphernalia. We do get slick, substance-free TV ads about how Biden is nicer than Trump.
Apparently to some Biden voters, wanting M4A during a global pandemic is selfish.   Wanting a livable planet for future generstions and plants and animals is selfish.   Wanting UBI so that people can be sheltered and eat is selfish.  Good voter outreach.
"I'm going to vote Biden-Harris, but if he picks Bass, I'm voting Trump"?  Obama announced Biden on August *23*.  FOCUS, PEOPLE.
If Id get arrested under a Biden regime whats the difference?  American electoral politics dont work.  We live in an oligarchy, what the elite need gets first, second, third priorities.
They already know that Obama knew about the surveillance, who was in that meeting and that Biden was the one that planted the idea of charges for Flynn.  All they are going to corroborate, to have it on record.  Yes, i think she will answer those questions.
It's flat dumb.  I know we are all locked down, but for gods sake, write about Trump's crimes.  Obama announced Biden as VP on AUGUST *23*.  Which is 3 weeks from now.
If monthly premiums are $1200 for a family and there is no work and housing is $1000 and food is $500 and I only got a $1200 check one time...  It doesnt matter who I vote for if I am dead next month.  Reality...  Neither Trump or Biden will act quickly and decisevely enough.
Alot of people will have the privielge and lotto luck of their birth, to go right back to sleep in a Biden presidency.  I hope to never be blind to the injustices all around me; by my country and those that rule it against, all peoples.  "While there is a lower class, I am in it"
For me the outcomes of a Biden or Trump presidency are minimal.  Children will still be in cages. The climate crisis will get worse. Close to 25% of the pop cant afford decent housing Affordable care act is and was forever a joke. Fascists have been in police forever.
We dont live in a binary world and saying, repeatedly, our choise is between Biden or Trump, negates centuries of international revolutionary liberation politics authored by black, brown, and poor people.  We dont have to accept elite control.  Biden offers nothing but status quo
No its not. Trying to force people to accept the binary status quo, Biden or Trump, is statist propaganda.  Its not a choice if the elite chose who we get the "privilege" of electing.  Biden is not the savior of the Republic. The people, organized, will determine our fates.
Center for Marketing and Opinion Research has Biden +4 in Ohio. (Disclosure: I worked for CMOR as a high school/college student in the summers of 08/09.)
Biden is part of the Washington swamp.  He funneled billions of dollars from China into Rosemont Capital in 2012/14.  Rosemont Capital is owned by Hunter Biden and Christopher Heinz.  Christopher Heinz is John Kerry's stepson.
All lawful Americans should own guns and have one available in every room of the house. One in every car. Do not allow yourself, grandparents, parents, children and grandchildren to be victimized in Biden‚Äôs America under more false narratives.
I can barely wait for Biden's inauguration. POTUS is a job for a grownup and you, sir, are the oldest 5-year-old ever.
Bernie is now imploring people to vote for Biden.  And Bernie makes a very important point in this video: he will at least have a chance to cooperate with the Biden administration.  But if Trump wins, any chance for progressive policy vanishes.
I'm not as worried as some people are. I think Biden is smart enough to make the right choice.
Isn‚Äôt Biden at least a step in the right direction, though? Won‚Äôt four years of Biden do more to accomplish the goals of progressives than four more years of Trump?
I said weeks ago. Biden will withdraw. An emergency candidate will be chosen. Guess who.
It will be at least a month after Biden gets the national mask and social distance campaign established.
Hillary is up. Biden is not going to be the nominee.
I agree w/ President Obama, statehood is the right answer IMO. I know some prominent advocates for PR statehood are supporting Biden FWIW. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Looks like this op-ed from last year is the best encapsulation of his publicly-started position (key quote on the future status of PR screenshotted below):
I could not possibly love this more,  üíôüñ§üëäüèº  Opinion: I'm ready to call our sister in the movement for justice Madam Vice President Kamala Harris #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris #MadamVicePresident #KamalaHarrisForVP #KamalaHarris
Weird that Trump is giving such solid reasons to vote for Biden, but I‚Äôll take it.
Oddly enough, Deshanko (Ukraine provided dossier) has to be tied to Soros as well, he worked with the Think Tank.  Which means, Biden is all over this too.  We may not have an election this year!!
Sally Yates goes before the Senate Judiciary Com. 8/5.  Biden appears to be the one that planted the idea of the Logan Act against Flynn.  Igor Deshanko (Ukrainian) worked at Brookings and has strong ties with Fiona Hill.  Mr. VP, you are in trouble...
Debating 45 would be useless. He lies and projects his own defiencies on others. Trump is mentally deranged. I hope Biden declines a debate. It would be a waste of all our time.
Andrew, do you not see the obvious cognitive issues with Joe Biden? The man cannot formulate a sentence; he can no longer reason and think on the fly. We all know he is a pawn in the hands of the Democratic Party system. The last place Joe Biden wants to be is on a debate stage.
I liked this because I like Warren, not because I like the prospect of Biden dying. That would be a terrible thing to happen, not only for him, but also for the Democratic party.

If Barr or Republican Senators/Reps use the propaganda info they received from Ukraine/Russia to smear Biden, is that a violation of FEC rules.

I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre getting at. Just defending Biden? He put out a plan to achieve racial equity that will not. That‚Äôs my only point. I didn‚Äôt argue that his proposals will do damage apart from producing an illusion of ‚Äúprogress.‚Äù Very Obama-like.
If this wasn't a staged, wouldn't  the Biden supporters be wearing masks?
You people are hilarious. Too many people show up, it's egregious and irresponsible. Too few show up, he's losing supporters. Where's the pics of Biden supporters? Oh wait, he's not allowing cameras in his basement, is he?
So afraid there's a good possibility Trump will actually lose. You're also angry seeing all those posts about Biden winning you're lashing back with nonsense like this one.  Good job at deluding yourself so HARD. üëå
. looks at how #NorthCarolina is a toss up state this  #2020Election. Frustration with #COVID19 &amp; college grads in metro areas trending toward a dem vote are 2 factors that show Biden has the edge as 48% of NC voters support Biden in the poll and 44% support Trump
Better Biden deal with the attacks when he did than have to do it now. I'm not even going to try to suggest to him what he should do--- he was a VP with an excellent example of a president to work with, so he should have ideas of who he wants. I'm happy with 4-5 of the candidates
It really says a lot about the two-party system when Republicans want us to vote for Joe Biden. The truth is Republicans and Democrats are really much more similar than they ever wanted us to believe. #NoMoreTrump #NeverBiden #VoteGreen #RideTheGreenWave
We both will vote for Biden
"The 2017 tax reform law dropped the corporate income rate from 35% to 21%. Biden wants to raise the rate to 28%. He has also called for a 15% minimum tax on large corporations."
Thanks--never seen that. She is so extreme, look what the stodgy tax folks say about Biden's tax plans.
I discuss the impracticality of Biden's claim that the Fed's traditional monetary policy instruments can have an effect on the black-white unemployment ratio in this  article by Danielle Kurtzleben
I think it‚Äôs more that he hated Hillary and is, in his heart, a misogynist. He wouldn‚Äôt be so moved to be a team player were this Hillary again in Biden‚Äôs place.
On FB I posted the meme of Biden and they declared it false...so I then posted the pic of Warren...it was NOT declared false  ü§£üòÇü§£
I mean Biden himself, mainly. Some potential VPs could counteract that, some could reinforce it. I'm not thinking that much about particular candidates because I find it hard to care about Democrats after being told my ideas and issues don't matter for the last 30 years.
Given her finish behind Biden, Sanders, and arguably Mayor Pete and Klobuchar, too, what makes you conclude that Warren is "the best campaigner"?
SHAME  Mr Biden You Are Telling Outright Falsehoods On TV Never In History Have I Seen Such Bigotry Hatred Lies Come From Democrats Dailey for 3 years your party has Attacked millions YOU HAVE LOST HISPANIC. VOTE TRUMP 202O
I‚Äôll bet you a flat $10.00 that Biden wins North Carolina. He will outperform them because the GOP base has dwindled to uneducated white voters in rural areas.
if electoral politics worked we would have fixed or mitigated climate crisis over the last few decades  the fact that we have accelerated CO2 emissions, and Biden cant stand by 3 of the most popular policy positions, #M4A, #GreenNewDeal and legalization is a huge problem

I don‚Äôt think anybody wins North Carolina by 17 points but I do believe Joe Biden would win handily if the election were today. The rapid GOP collapse in the suburbs is one of the more remarkable trends I‚Äôve seen in politics.
This isn‚Äôt the slightest shred of truth in this statement. It‚Äôs just plain silly. As if Biden were some unknown character.
What's the point of debates? We're all just going to vote for the dude we think is the least senile right? Unless these debates are formatted as head-to-head "Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV" dungeon fights to the death, let's skip them.
That's what I was gonna say, it looks like if you include the Biden + Richardson numbers it would add up. I bet that's a first ballot or something.
Also there are Biden stickers everywhere on the east coast.
That‚Äôs exactly what we plan to do by replacing you with Joe Biden.  You are the worst president ever.  Even the republicans don‚Äôt want you any more.

The Durham-Barr Origin of Russia investigation has a pre-determined outcome. Barr travelled with Durham to Australia, UK, Ukraine, US states and other places to support the following: that Comey, McCabe, Strozk, Page, Brennan, Clapper, Biden, Obama and maybe Rice and Yates guilty

If you don't vote for Biden, Trump will win. That's just a fact. #Election2020
Way less than now if Biden gets elected.
This post brings up an excellent point: Zombie Joe Biden would be a MUCH cooler candidate
I detest the two-party system and Biden as much as most, but the GOP is irredeemable. It's unhinged patriarchy.
Compared to what Biden has proposed, trump‚Äôs policies do defund the police.
Exactly. A lot of them don't care if Biden wins. They have their sights set on 2024, and to hell with what happens to our country in the meantime.   But they want to be able to say they supported a Black woman so they can tell themselves they're not engaging in misogynoir.
It really is like he's trying to hypnotize the country into believing that the past 4 years were some kind of extended Obama/Biden administration. (Of course, the gains in the economy before the pandemic basically were)
Maybe the delay is because Biden‚Äôs trying to talk Kamala into being his first SCOTUS pick, and she‚Äôs weighing her options. üòÇ  And that‚Äôs why Clyburn‚Äôs suddenly all ‚ÄúSCOTUS is more important than VP...‚Äù  *Yes. I am bored. I do not think any of this is true.
Joe... You had 54 years.  All you did was get rich.  Let's see Hunter Biden's tax records.
Biden is the nominee.  He should choose his VP, not Sanders or Sanders‚Äô adherents.
As a 10yo boy, Shirley Chisholm spoke to my public school district  about racism. Me: Ms Chisholm, do you think racism will end in my lifetime? SC: Honey, I hope so... Its time to do the hard work to make this happen.
It's just not as much fun campaigning against Biden as it was against Hillary. He hasn't had fun since election night November 2016, except maybe when he was behind the steering wheel in that big truck
It doesn't, but it gives them a very distinct advantage, especially in this instance. If Biden has a successful term, it'll be very difficult to defeat his VP. Choosing someone who doesn't want to run would be sacrificing a key advantage in a critical election. Why would he?
True conservatives will vote for Biden. I look forward to real political election in 2024üá∫üá∏
Biden is the ‚ÄúAnyone but Trump‚Äù candidate.
We're not fooled by the leftist white supremacists who are naming as acceptable running mates Black women who, even if they were chosen and were able to help Biden win this year's election, wouldn't be likely to run for the presidency in 2024. We see you.
There are plenty of reasons to oppose Kamala, but shading her for being ambitious is ... y‚Äôall realize Biden‚Äôs been running for President since the Reagan administration?
And in order to do this easily, just imagine YOU are Biden's pick and that write a tweet with that sensitivity.
I can't wait until the conventions are over so we can finally be done with the following theories that never made sense to begin with: 1) Biden will be replaced as nominee 2) Biden will choose Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama as running mate 3) Pence will be replaced as VP
Oh blimey. Hope it‚Äôs a Biden landslide, might discourage a challenge!
I like this shirt because it's a reminder that Harris is proven in the crucial "attack dog" role of the running mate. Most of the other names being mentioned are at best untested.  That role might be more important than ever with Biden leading the ticket.
Nah, I'll vote for the fascist if Biden doesn't debate üôÑ
There are exactly 2 running mate picks Biden could make that would make sense at all: Kamala Harris and Susan Rice.  Of the two, Harris is the better pick for VP.  Rice would be ideal for Secretary of State.  #KamalaHarrisForVP #SusanRiceForSecState  But no matter what happens...
Greetings VP Biden!  I, together with countless millions believe in you; trust you to put the White House train wreck back on track..."We are with you Joe!"  HINT: Senator Kamala Harris would make an excellent running mate.  Like you, she speaks for all of us.

Lots of other older people chiming in, saying they love Biden because he lost his wife and his ‚Äúbeautiful son.‚Äù Something about Biden resonates with older Americans more than it did with Hillary or other candidates. I think maybe because they observed his grief so many times.
I'm not saying it's unprecedented. I'm saying Biden won't do it.

Saturday morning politics take: Whoever leaked the story about the old guys on the Biden VP team criticizing Kamala Harris for being good at politics might have guaranteed her selection as VP.
Biden should sit this one out. You can‚Äôt debate a name calling, adolescent, narcissist.

True, vote Biden
No, they're fine with old white guys like Biden. But yes, fear of blacks and women in the nation's highest office was a big part of why insecure white men love Trump.
Why Biden‚Äôs VP pick will matter so much -  -
... oh, but Hunter Biden!!!!
She may be our next President after Biden!  Love her!

The survey was administrated by Dynata (who could be collecting data for GOP for marketing purposes?) It was just odd to have questions be like, "Joe Biden has been in Washington for 47 yrs and has done nothing. Do you think he would be a good leader?" Lots of leading questions.

Agree
Sometimes the right choice is the hardest choice: Joe Biden should drop out of the election. What comes next? No clue but we should have figured this out in February. And yes, same sentiments to 45.
And Joseph R. Biden selects as his running mate...drum roll please...Tim Kaine, senator from the great commonwealth of Virginia! Come on down, Tim! *a nation dies*
I'm trying to understand Biden's "Green New Deal" but everything I'm seeing claims it's either the end of the world or the only thing to save us and I just want some facts.
Very. Course some states get Kanye. Which will probably divide young black and white voters who dig his music and help pull votes from Biden.  Mainly because Rep operatives are helping Kanye get set up in some states

Does anyone actually believe this? I know most of us have resigned to the reality that we're probably gonna vote for Biden, but come on, we can be honest here. Does anyone actually believe that literally any important Democrat knows Latin America?
I say this as an extremely unhappy Biden voter: Biden does not know Latin America. Neither did Obama. No one whose analysis is worth taking seriously would look at Obama's administration and say that he knew Latin America. And Obama is infinitely smarter than Biden.

Joe hasn‚Äôt chosen his VP yet, so you could always throw in your name in there! Doesn‚Äôt Biden/Cher 2020 have a nice ring to it?
Democrats Advise Biden Not to Debate Trump
Which month. Never mind Donald . President Joe Biden will improve our healthcare because he will care for others something you don‚Äôt.
Once again,  my post clearly wasn't read correctly.  That was a response to a person complaining about biden being in office for 40 years not doing anything about current issues. If you look at my page,  im NO trump supporter.
If this election is so important, wth are they doing nominating Biden
You ‚Äúbottom line‚Äù is the reason I will vote for Biden! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare 46 &gt; 45 #TrumpHatesWomen
He has to master the use of adjectives before debating against Biden.
That would be Biden!üíØ
A record high for the Nasdaq ‚Äòwould all come crashing down,‚Äô says Trump in a tweet, ‚Äòincluding your jobs, stocks, and 401(k)s,‚Äô if Biden wins presidency - MarketWatch. Tired message dude. Fear, division, racism blah blah. ‚Å¶ failure

Why would Biden supporters show up at your gatherings? I bet you didn't see anyone there supporting logic either... sometimes people don't show up where they aren't welcome.
There is one he's called joe biden.
I have heard Joe Biden speak for close to 40 years. I don‚Äôt know if he has a mental condition or dementia currently, but he was an idiot 40 years ago. He has kept his foot in his mouth as long as he‚Äôs kept his hands on little girls and his nose on girls head sniffing them. Creepy
Chicken shit brainless Biden.
I will be surprised if any debates take place.  The democrats are already floating lots of reasons to eliminate them.  Biden is unable to answer questions unless the answers are written down for him to read.
Nobody thinks it‚Äôs okay..... Democrats don‚Äôt want Biden either
The debates were canceled when the dems nominated Biden ,
Am I the only one who thinks Joe Biden‚Äôs face looks orange in this ‚Å¶ picture? üò≥ #Biden2020
‚ÄúAs a law professor, her work on bankruptcy illuminated the systemic barriers Black Americans face and helped convince Ms. Warren that race was intimately intertwined with inequality.‚Äù ü§î  So not until she was in her 30s...
We really have to get Joe elected.  Biden‚Äôs Quietly Radical Care Plan
I don't know.  Keeping their candidates off live camera and letting the media doing the talking would probably heavily benefit Biden.  Let the ship sink while taking shots through advertising.  No choice BUT to vote for anything else.
Dodd and Pelosi need to Stop Trying to get Vice President Joe Biden to pick Karen Bass as his running mate! She Cried when Castro Died! We don't like This! Get It???
Karen Bass is A Castro Supporter trying to turn Vice President Joe Biden in the Wrong Direction towards Cuba! Susan Rice was in the Failed Bush Administration that led US into the Worse Recession ever! Rices son is going to vote for Trump!
With 92 days until Election Day, here's what we're watching heading into a new week in the 2020 campaign:
Why? Why would you vote for Biden? What policies does he focus on that interest you the most? What has Biden done throughout his career that will benefit US? What does he bring to the table?
"Oh dear. Biden might have a more deliberative management style!"
2 month &amp; 15 days , THAT'S 75 STRAIGHT DAYS OF TRUMP POLLS BLOCKED! This site can‚Äôt be reached  The webpage at
The media wants us to believe that Biden is ahead in all the polls and they want mail-in voting so they can cheat then if Biden wins they can say, "He won because the polls showed he was ahead."
With all the buzz on media about who will Biden tap for VP, you would think it's a big deal. Joe choosing a VP is about as important as choosing which hand to flush the toilet with. Doesn't matter, either one gets rid of the s...!
Who made the comment about Vice President Joe Biden should choose someone Latino? Senator Karma Harris is half Jamaican!

Karma Harris will let Trump Pence Miller Meadows McConnell have at it! Harris will take Direct Aim at Our African American Friends to get out and vote for Biden!!
Demmengs is already being attacked! Warren is To White and to Old to be Vice President and Our African American Friends won't vote for Biden with Warren! Warren is to Old to take over if something happens to Biden!
Trump has nothing to do with what Microsoft does. That's capitalism. But Biden and Obama gave all of our manufacturing jobs to China. Trump got them back.
If Vice President Joe Biden can't take a little attack from Harris on the Debate Stage how is he going to Debate Trump! Karma Harris will Have Trump Pence Miller Meadows McConnell Jordan for Breakfast!!
I think Biden and Obama already did this. That's why Trump was elected.
I‚Äôm still sad about Beto. I had such high hopes. But, I am happy that it is Biden and not Boot-edge-edge.
I'm still disgusted by the John Lewis funeral. That was nothing more than a campaign speech for Biden. You were their to honor a fallen civil rights activist/congressman and failed miserably. #Trump2020 #KAG2020

Yes, we‚Äôve paid quite a bit less since the tax cuts. Our income increased with modest raises (3%-ish,) in 2018 and 2019, but our taxes paid dropped by around $7500 from 2017.  Regardless, there is zero chance I‚Äôll be voting for Trump. Still praying about voting for Biden.
Biden never met one he didn't sniff. Oh and looks like ol Clinton definitely likes em young.
Can‚Äôt wait for China to help us overthrow Biden then!
why there are no Biden signs where there were Hillary signs last time .... Watch "Joe Biden steals speech - Johnny Carson 1987" on YouTube  .  more revealing now than then.
You cant dodge debates, this is standard. Biden is being protected to keep agenda
If by some miracle Biden should win, his handlers will have to show him where to report to work. The poor man can‚Äôt complete a sentence, it‚Äôs embarrassing he‚Äôs in the race for the presidency. The guy is a tool for left-wing socialist.
I am not sure Joe Biden knows where he is!
Joe wants to be a transitional figure, but only in terms of party leadership. A Biden presidency will not address the systemic issues that facilitated Trump's rise to power. My bigger concern is that a more competent fascist will represent the GOP in 2024 and will probably win.
Last point: if Biden loses, which at present is incredibly unlikely, Obama should be blamed. During his tenure in office he hemorrhaged almost 1000 state legislature seats which gave Republicans the tools needed to manipulate election results for the foreseeable future.
Tag Joe Biden. MAGA STEPPIN‚Äô video coming soon üá∫üá∏
Joe Biden is not smart enough to conduct a campaign. He is operating as a mouthpiece for the liberal left. I doubt even he thinks he could finish four years in office if there was a miracle in his favor and he won.The Biden campaign is the lefts move towards socialism
I think he‚Äôs talking about taking it back from incompetent liberal mayors,governors and members of Congress.We are trying to make America great again after the Obamas and Biden‚Äôs almost destroyed our culture and our country. The president can get it all done.
15 days until the Democratic Convention and we still don't know who Biden's VP pick is.  How long does it take to run a full background check on Whitmer?
Get your made in CHYNNNNNA trump gear. Extra large available for your fat heads and big asses. Hurry they will be a fun novelty during the Biden Presidency
So you support another Communist run business and trust them. So does Biden. Good For You.
lol at you, ya dumbass.  Just watch Biden in action and you can easily see a clear decline, but by all means go on pretending otherwise üòÇ
Biden entered the Senate the year that I could vote for the first time. He's not perfect all the time, but who is. I know when a politician pisses on my leg and tell me it's raining. He doesn't do that. I admire his quiet strength. I hope he takes Trump and bloody their nose.
But Biden is working for Americans by hiding in his basement?
If Vice President Joe Biden debates Trump keep pointing out the fact that Trump's Lawyers are at the Supreme Court trying to end Obamacare!!! The only and Best Healthcare We've ever had!
Vice President Joe Biden doesn't have to Debate Trump to Win the Election! But if he decides to Keep hitting on Trump and the Republican Party for trying 3 years to Repeal the only Healthcare We have leaving over 133 Million Americans without Healthcare!
He‚Äôs taking his time. People are voting for Biden not his vp.
Dementia Joe Beijing Biden is not a whole man... Dementia is the worst disease a person can have because it steals you memories and don't remember!  Stop the Elder Abuse to Joe and let him live his life out in peace!!
I'm ready to call our sister in the movement for justice Madam Vice President Kamala Harris
With Harris or Warren by his side I don't think they'd let Biden let the criminals slide. The girls are both tough cookies and have a clear understanding what's right and what's wrong. They're ready to stomp!
So disgusting!! And Dementia Joe Beijing Biden got his the same day he unmasked General Flynn!!
One of the things about the #Biden2020 campaign that I actually find healthy is that it seems so few people ‚Äúworship‚Äù Biden as someone who will save us. Our past political figures (R &amp; D) have become such obsessions. People want him to win, but it‚Äôs not necessarily about HIM.
I‚Äôm voting for Joe. I trust him. But if I am fully honest, the VP pick is so important to me. Because, face it... #TheFutureisFemale

Karen Bass, on Biden VP shortlist, scrambles to explain remarks on Castro, Scientology
The best explanation I've read about the left loving her is that she's "safe" and won't run in 2024 if Biden retires. Harris would and would win and the dirtbag left rather have their anointed one. Keep in mind Harris is a progressive but they don't care.
YOU WRITE WITH GASOLINE INK.  THANK YOU FOR MAKING BIDEN‚ÄôS CASE.
2 things ..  Biden never said he wanted to defund the police   My life is currently in chaos with racial tension and economic chaos
Who is deciding policy for Biden?
I have seen some Biden toilet paper but nobody was buying it.
I am a Joe Biden fan but would not stoop so low as to spread disgusting rumors for which you have no evidence!!!
Lol!!!  NC HERE....VOTING FOR BIDEN!
The primaries are over. Harris landed some good shouts. She would be an asset to the ticket. George Bush and Ronald Reagan scrapped before becoming a winning ticket. Obama and Clinton  fought hard. Biden will chose on ability and we need a Veep with backbone,  not a lapdog.

If Vice President Joe Biden is President!
As a matter of point,  was hitting us over the head with this sentiment in all his debates: New challenges will emerge and this President cannot handle them. Biden said in October that this Administration is ill prepared for a pandemic. They knew.
Adam you can‚Äôt legitimately think Biden is a viable candidate.  The Dems had a great chance to win and they fumbled the ball big time.
Really! Is that why Biden and the Democrats called him a racist and xenophobe for stopping travel to and from China? Then after they realized he was right they said he didn't act quick enough.
Key impeachment witness Vindman rebukes Trump on retirement from military. PRESIDENT BIDEN. Your first order of business. RESTORE THIS HERO AS A PART OF YOUR ADMINISTRATION.
this isn‚Äôt a partisan argument; although i have always disliked trump, i don‚Äôt favor Biden either.

NO. We picked joe Biden because was the one to beat trump. If he resigns not only will we lose we will have mike, I believe in conversion therapy, pence as president for four more years.

Biden isn't clapping back and taking the bait.   But he is actively doing virtual events and putting out exciting policies.   Like... a normal presidential candidate
Dodd and Others need to Stop! If Vice President Joe Biden can't take a hit from Senator Karma Harris on the Debate Stage just think what Trump will Do! Stop your Whining and Get to Work!

Y‚Äôall do realize if Joe Biden chooses Tammy Duckworth as his VP then Trump is going to do something like enter his rallies to ‚ÄúLegs‚Äù by ZZ Top, right?

Dodd and others need to Stop putting Down Senator Karma Harris! What she did to Biden in the Debate is what she will do to Trump Pence McConnell! No Karen Bass or Susan Rice! Please Shut up or Lose this Election!!
Dodd and Others that don't want Senator Karma Harris as Joe Bidens running mate better think again! Harris will attack Trump and Pence like she did Biden in the Debate! Former Federal Prosecutor very smart and only 55 years old and can Run Our Country right off the Start!

Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Then I conclude you either 1) Don't know what a "hawk" is, or 2) Don't want to publicly list the countries that need intervention. This isn't a trick question. You said Biden "hopefully" picks a hawk. Peak neolib. Maybe the mask slipped.
Nothing they say surprise me they own Joe Biden they own the DNC!
You said you hope he gets a hawk, someone who is pro-intervention. My question is not stupid. By hoping for a hawk, you are hoping for intervention. So you do or don't have a few countries that need some of Biden's freedom? Or is this my 8th question you refuse to answer?
Biden's gotta git gud but it's not off the table. If he gets Tulsi for VP it's a done deal.
More examples. What am I wrong about? All the kids he grabs are the children of Republicans. Is this behavior normal to you? How would you feel if it was Trump doing this instead of Biden?
montage from Media Matters of on-air personalities taking Biden to task for (now rightfully) suggesting Trump would try and find a way to delay the election.
Yea I'm ignoring "Never Biden" Democrats really not worth taking seriously right now
They probably believe in harm reduction (which I disagree with) but I'm not going to shame them for it. While I won't vote for Biden since he's effectively a 90s Republican, I'm not going to shame the anyone but Trump crowd.
So Biden isn't picking Kamala as VP¬ø? Bad.

you sound just like Biden ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not black if you don‚Äôt vote for me‚Äù, the democratic party literally created the KKK, Joe played a huge role in the 90s crime bill that led to more mass incarceration, you haven‚Äôt looked at Trump‚Äôs policies that have benefited the Negro..REsearch
That‚Äôs because no matter what we are voting JOE BIDEN 2020
You know if Joe Biden Defeats Trump and Trump refuses to leave Office he has no Power and Federal Agents will escort him from the White House! Or maybe Trump will get a Majic Bullet like JFK.
Only Congress can change an Election Date! Not Barr! Not Trump! Even if Trump tried to stay on January 21st 2021 he wouldn't have any Power as the new incoming President Joe Biden!
Fact!!!  He and Biden should get adjoining rooms at the Nursing Home !!!
actually look at the things trump has done w his policies compared to obama‚Äôs administration for the Negro people. If anything Joe Biden is more ‚Äúracist‚Äù he played a huge role in the 90s crime bill...this is America you know how many ‚Äúracist‚Äù presidents there has been?üòÇ
Straight, white men are a trip sometimes y‚Äôall. Imagine being so privileged that your American experience allows you to view Biden‚Äôs election is the end of the nightmare and not just a transition to a new, slightly less shitty phase of the nightmare.
The 20th Amendment! If Joe Biden Defeats Trump whether he tries to stay as President he won't have any Power! Your Times Up! You better go on your own!
Even if Trump could Cancel the Election if Vice President Joe Biden Defeats Trump and Pence would not have any Power! Only Congress can change an Election which Nancy Polosi won't do! Trump should leave Office Politiy like Obama or be escorted out by Federal Agents!
every state elects their own personal imbecile,here in Ohio we have several with Jim Jordan at the top!All the real Republicans that wouldn't accept a lying racist sexual predator who is clearly in debt to Russia need to win as many votes as possible for Biden
Trump can't Cancel the Election! Because of the Corona Virus, a War or any other reason! If Vice President Joe Biden Defeats Trump will have to leave Office January 21st 2021!
You mean what is happening NOW under the current president who is actually not Biden?  What are you smoking?
What are the odds that he loses, refuses to concede, the incoming Biden Admin negotiates a deal in which he is not prosecuted by DOJ if he agrees to leave.   I think that's all he cares about. On the upside he'd probably sell everyone out, up to &amp; including his kids, to do it.

Considering Biden himself has said he‚Äôll be a one-term President, shouldn‚Äôt he *want* a veep who‚Äôs ready to take the reins in 2024?
I choose Trump over Biden!
Any of them have their positives and negatives. Biden needs someone who is comfortable working with and can trust to push back on him when needed. I will be okay with any of them but hope it isn't Warren. She needs a bigger economic role.
If the man would quit tweeting he would be fine...... Don't worry in Nov you will be relected just said people hate Trump so much they willing to vote for Joe biden. I want to see the debate between them Joe Biden can't make a sentence oh dumbass....

NO! Black people do not think alike. Many younger blacks (under30) think Biden‚Äôs racist &amp; many of the unfortunate whose lives &amp; businesses utterly destroyed  will never support him also!  Plus many affluent blacks (those that see Biden as he is) know they are hated also by Obama.
Are you agreeing with Biden black people can‚Äôt think for themselves then?
How do you explain joe biden saying he was against desegregation because it would turn schools into jungles if blanks were allowedin white schools?
My vote for Biden was set on November 4th 2016! We had enuf evidence of what to come from a Trump WH even before the casting of the first mail-in ballot in 2016!  Really a VP pick is make or break for voting for BIDEN?
Idioto! U &amp; many others have been spreading this half truth for far too long. The whole truth is that he was showing support to a senator who gave up &amp; denounced KKK for 53 years before that photo was taken with Biden! There r many such KKK converts who gave up old ways!!
Someone who makes mistakes, owns up to it and is eager to learn 4rm it is like u &amp; me. Basically i am not looking to elect an infallible God but a kind &amp; empathetic decent human being like Joe Biden!

I see many voters sitting this 1 out. Biden‚Äôs whole campaign is ‚Äú I‚Äôm not Trump! ‚Äú Biden turns 78 in Nov. I wouldn‚Äôt want a 78 yr. old driving me in a car, much less running the country! There will be backlash, but Dems need to blame themselves! They had 4 years to groom a champ!
DONY  WORRY, she won‚Äôt be VP. ITLL BE SUSAN RICE! Obama, who will be running country again (Biden napping) needs her extensive past experience to coalesces FBI CIA NSA JUSTICE &amp; HOMELAND with one agenda. Spy, terrorize &amp; persecute even more as he seeks REVENGE.
Guess which presidential candidate co-sponsored this bill.....  Trump is absolutely racist.  Biden is racist by policy

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening but your entitled to your stance. I‚Äôm just not a fan of white nationalist heroes as senior White House advisors. Regardless of what I think of Biden, he‚Äôs not allowing people are worshipped by white nationalist into his administration.

What has Biden accomplished in 44 years?
No in 2022 we make our move to takeover the party by uniting the lost tribes of black America to keep the house and move to 60 senators. Then Biden replacement pass reparations
It would be an interesting poll. Speaking only for myself, a Warren pick would make me reconsider not voting for Trump. None of the other candidates would do that, and Biden isn't going to pick someone who makes me want to vote D so I guess it's LP or write-in.
Did anybody else have older black people say ‚ÄúBill Clinton, was our first black president?‚Äù I‚Äôm gonna take a guess and say y‚Äôall heard that too.. these same people tell us to vote for scoundrels like Biden. ü•¥

Wacko Biden!!

I'm not worried about Biden because it will take 60 senators vote to pass anything. Republicans vote no on everything black so little will get done until 22 if we get 60. Then in 24 the revolution election happens we win them all reparations in 25.

Probably. But, few of us are fundamentally persuadeable, right? Regardless of which party/which candidate we prefer. Like the few % who may vote Biden but might have  voted Trump over Bernie. Which is why the Dems blocked Bernie, but are pushing Biden 2 run on Bernie's views.

If Biden is so horrible, why do these pro-Trump PACs and super PACs constantly have to lie to scare voters away from him?
So sad.  Biden can't get out a legible sentence and Trump won't shut up.  #americasfinest
That being said, even tho they brought it on themselves dissolving the #NRA NOW is a TERRIBLE move for the Democrats. They should wait til after the election to make a move on that.  Some Indeps who are mostly pro-2A still connect NRA with #2A policies, and this could hurt Biden.

There‚Äôs no point to even make fun of Biden and his awkward gaffes anymore. It‚Äôs honestly so sad to me and really makes me think about my grandpa who has been struggling with dementia for over 4 years now. I hope he gets the help he deserves.
In other words you're looking for an excuse not to vote for Biden.
Yep, Dems are foolishly acting like Biden already won.
NO.... not only Obama, but Biden, Brennan, Clapper, Rice, Holder, Yates, Comey, Hillary....  Fake News and Deep State would pummel anyone trying such a thing... hence Conservatives are too timid to try üòñüòñüòñ
Uhhh.... yeah. Hmm.  I've got nothing here.    Does he even know who Biden is?  Far left extremist? Bible Hater?  I think not.
I‚Äôd rather Biden‚Äôs corrupt over Trump/Kanye‚Äôs corrupt
Why Joe Biden gets 'belligerent' when challenged: Michael Goodwin |
I do believe I‚Äôd check the skies before venturing out.  Trump calling out Biden in the name of religion might not be wise.  Altar boy vs rent collector?  Not good.
Clearly Biden himself, as Trump has declared that he is powerful enough to ‚Äúhurt God.‚Äù
Joe Biden is making it VERY hard to vote for him lmao like bruh....just shutup, you have our vote rn but don‚Äôt fuck that up
He really doesn‚Äôt have anything to hit Biden with. Maybe on Sunday they‚Äôll show a pic of Biden at church and Trump playing golf!  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Joe Biden does not have to prove he reads his Bible, or how to hold it. üòâ
I honestly dont think neither Trump or Biden wants to win this november. They are just going through the motions. Literally every day they either say or do shit thats says ‚Äúwhat can i do not to get elected‚Äù.
This demon actually said Biden would hurt God .... if white folks don‚Äôt wake up  i don‚Äôt know what will happen to them
Trump on Biden:  "He's against breathing air, he kicks puppies. Once he punched my granny. He likes to take candy from babies. He's pro bubonic plague"
There is, for example, a massive difference between Kamala Harris and Susan Rice. For me, it‚Äôs likely the difference between Biden getting my vote and writing someone else in. Harris would have my vote. Rice would not.     Well damn SE didn‚Äôt see that coming
That's all Biden is care about is Latinos and other immigrants! He ain't thinking about us ( the black community). #FBA #B1
DID Biden announce his VP? I just got a text saying ‚Äúhere‚Äôs your chance to meet HER.‚Äù Who‚Äôs her?
Biden and Hilary have virtually the same politics. If anything, Biden has been pushed to be a lil more progressive. But he‚Äôs polling so much better with white men than she ever did. The misogyny inside of this bus!!
Calling Biden a practicing Catholic is a joke. He is against protecting the unborn....very basic Catholic belief. Same with  Nancy P....I'm sure she is still praying for our President.
HOW CAN ANY SELF RESPECTING BLACK PERSON VOTE FOR BIDEN? WOW?
At this point, Donald Trump is saying anything just see if it will stick to the wall on Biden
Whoever is tweeting for Biden is vying for my vote. HARD.
I'm waiting to order my  gear til he announced his VP so I can have both names on my bumper sticker, hat, and shirt.  Please Joe make it #BidenHarris2020 Biden/Harris!
Biden doesn‚Äôt articulate his thoughts well but I don‚Äôt know a lot of black people who trace their roots like the latin community does and that‚Äôs all he was trying to say..
Joe Biden looks like an important piece of paper that got left in the rain and then dried out and everyone keeps insisting it's "just as good as before."
Literally all Biden needs to do to win is follow Aaron Burr‚Äôs advice ‚ÄúTalk less, smile more‚Äù  And yet
My mother is a tiny bit older than Joe Biden, and I wouldn't hire her for anything more strenuous than a sleep study. This is a woman who raised five children and moves 75 pound rocks around her yard obsessively all day every day.
Biden is a practicing Roman Catholic; there'd be no Bible unless for the Catholic Church!
Neither Biden nor Trump never offer me and the rest of the black community tangibles and reparations! So, here's my final answer! #FBA #B1
Dude just said the ‚ÄúGreat State of Ohio‚Äù.... Biden here I come
Wait until Biden finds out some Latinos ARE Black ü§ØüôÉ
Exactly. It‚Äôs bigger than Biden and Trump. These idiots don‚Äôt know how to look at the bigger picture.
Nothing will happen to Trump under a Biden admin. Corporate Democrats are fucking useless. So much for an ‚Äúopposition‚Äù party.
Any day now right-wing nut jobs will come up with the conspiracy theory that Hunter Biden worked with China to release the virus just to undercut Trump's reelection. Who cares how many lives get sacrificed for the glory of Trump?
I‚Äôm surprised Biden even makes it to work each day. If you call what he does work
all I‚Äôm saying is if they make Biden take a cognitive test, Trump should too
Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself, Joe Biden like a lot of people, like I even thought a long time ago, think blacks people have to be democrats. We don‚Äôt have a hive mind and a lot of liberals think we do.
I though I had signed up to try to help Joe Biden but all I get is a text everyday to donate money.
You know she's voting Biden. That was her Dad's friend. There should be no confusion or doubt on this point. Trump is not an option.
BIDEN IS A RACIST!

Biden is a horrible, bad, no good person.   #Biden2020 #Latinos #Blacks

BREAKING: Joe Biden‚Äôs Worst NIGHTMARE Comes True ‚Äì It‚Äôs Happening  via  News Network
talked with a deep red state dude the other day claiming biden is not up to the mental challenge. wonder where he gets his news?
Joe Biden used US money, we'll, the threat of withholding it, and e
I agree. It‚Äôs not about liking Donald Trump. I find him entertaining but I also think if he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù or ‚Äú I was wrong‚Äù every now &amp; then he could win over a huge chunk of the middle. It‚Äôs only a race between he &amp; Biden because Trump is making it one.
If you vote for a man who doesn't even know what state he's in or if he's running for senate instead of President you have no right to question a Christians decision to vote for  Trump. Biden is a sick man &amp; needs a mental acuity test. Trump is greatest President of all time!üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
It's not the news...It's the Snark Report with  Strange obsessions and  bad behavior with a fianc√©, a possible new campaign slogan for Joe Biden, and Napoleon's sister is now minus a few toes thanks to a tourist. MORE:  #WCCB #rising #news
I think Biden should make his campaign slogan ‚Äúmy time is up‚Äù it would be a nice wink and a nod to the #metoo movement that really failed to call him out on countless creepy things he‚Äôs done... and it is something he says all the time to cheat the clock in debates.
Jill biden is the creepo
Why can‚Äôt you say you are voting for Biden? Are you not casting a vote for President period?
Can‚Äôt Believe Trump &amp; Biden are our only options ...
Atleast with trump I‚Äôm learning how to deal wit da pecawood shit &amp; I can see everything for what it is. Joe Biden gon y‚Äôall his self right into not coming out the room like Hilary did when trump won last time.  Y‚Äôall better tell y‚Äôall man to stfu or find a way 2 get us some money
Again, it doesn‚Äôt matter what Biden says. If he said ‚Äú when elected I will send all African Americans to the gas chamber‚Äù he would still get 85% of the black vote. Kinda reinforcing the point he just made wouldn‚Äôt you say?
Yo fat guy Go back and watch Biden v Ryan in the VP debate and rethink this tweet
What are the odds Biden is on the ticket, but doesn‚Äôt realize it?
From the 70s through the 90s. Joe Biden is responsible for 2.5 million blacks being locked up in that time. I saw it with my own eyes. I did what I did. But others got amplified time and life for bs. He is the worst.
The Democrats knows that Joe can't compete on a level playing field. Joe Biden has early symptoms of Dementia or Alzheimers, and the Dems know it. They're using Joe to get a younger Socialist in power. Joe has been dragged hard LEFT, until he doesn't recognize himself.
Yo if Kanye really trolling just to divert the black vote from Biden.  Trump team gave him 80 million MINIMUM.   So in that case he still a OPP &amp; that would be nasty work !
As i do ... Biden‚Äôs tone and laughter at the question didn‚Äôt set well with them. What part of freedom of speech do you think you control behind a keyboard   Debate is healthy  maybe you need to develop thicker skin   Their was nothing toxic about their comments #goodtrouble maybe
Biden supporters won‚Äôt be drawn away, but there could be some young voters that aren‚Äôt too enthusiastic about Uncle Joe. The Trump supporters won‚Äôt be swayed regardless.
BLM needs to pick up the pace for Biden.
Understood - totally, those issues need to be addressed. So how are these things being solved by the current health care system, or what Biden will implement? As opposed to what M4A would do.

My dad died a year ago from Alzheimer‚Äôs, was high functioning until last 3-4 months, he had a form of aphasia = u mix up words, yes vs no, up vs down. Biden is reminiscent of how my dad stuttered to get his words right. I love my dad but wouldn‚Äôt have voted for him to be POTUS
‚ÄúHas Joe Biden ever tear-gassed anyone so that he could stand outside a building holding a Bible like a crossing guard‚Äôs stop sign? No? I rest my case.‚Äù
Good question. Well it backfired with me. I voted for Bernie in 2016 but because of nuts like this guy I didn‚Äôt vote for him this campaign. This guy doesn‚Äôt understand what he is doing to their movement. Every time he texts I remind somebody to vote for Biden.
So is Biden going to stand up for black people?? We need black specific targeted problems not that we are all in this together crap  -black specific home lending programming on the scale of fdr which we were excluded  -HR40  You want us marching we demand protections

Yeah its pretty insane. I hope the Biden campaign uses the "You cannot do that" line in their campaign ads
How? Because the difference between you and Biden is so vast that there is no need for additional decision making. Besides...all you are going to do in the debates is lie continuously like you did in 2016 and have continued ever since.

You don't have to check Polifact to know this is true.  Throw every other thought out. This is a referendum on Trump and Biden has little to do with it other than being an avatar for the DNC. Joe can only lose what should be a slam dunk.
While he has not yet endorsed many of the things listed above to avoid upsetting some moderate voters, Biden has promoted giving statehood to DC and banning most assault weapons, both of which had been confined to Bernie and Warren just six months ago.
It‚Äôs the hypocrisy for me, she is 100 percent correct. They only care about decorum. Biden could do some of the same things Trump is doing and liberals won‚Äôt care because ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs nice‚Äù, it‚Äôs sick.

The Biden campaign should thank the Trump team for these interviews.
Fascinating. It‚Äôs like Biden has been reading Friedman instead of Karl Marx. Biden is taking a conservative free market capitalist position on trade with China. He is right. We should cancel tariffs. They only hurt America. Trump‚Äôs trade war failed.
Blew past 500, on the way to 600. Also don‚Äôt let anyone bully u into picking the lesser of two evils this election. If Biden doesn‚Äôt want to make concessions for the left don‚Äôt feel bad about not giving him your vote, he‚Äôs not entitled to it.

I'm with Brian Cates, Biden is nearly 80 years old and has lived the life of a billionaire while riding on the backs of corruption.   Biden deserves nothing more than the slow and public decline of a corrupt politician.
Wow. Trump is flailing. And bigly.
This is the whole game, y‚Äôall. I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt like Joe Biden. Vote for him because of the courts.
No, they are members of a political party that believes blacks are so stupid they'll only vote for a black candidate. They voted for Obama, so logically, they'll vote for Kanye instead of Biden. They also believe the world is flat, the sun orbits the earth and water flows uphill.
I am. Biden's got dementia.
LeoTerrell on Hannity...Donald Trump has done more in 3 short yrs for blacks, minorities&amp; for America than Obama/Biden in8yrs! That‚Äôs painful to DEMS BC REPS aren‚Äôt suppose to care for minorities, but Trump is COLOR BLIND &amp; does what is in the best interest of America! Thanks LT!
Keep Trump on the interview circuit. It‚Äôs working. For Biden
He cut deals with Biden because Biden gave away the store! So much so that Harry Reid banned him from further negotiations!
There has been so much expertise tossed out the door in this admin! I have no idea how we‚Äôll ever get them back. Especially if Biden actually passes healthcare reform (since we don‚Äôt pay public servants shit vs private sector so the only draw is healthcare &amp; passion) #Maddow
And Biden said if you vote for Trump you ain‚Äôt black.....I think both sides know very little about black people lol
I‚Äôm not trying to be mean or political here but Biden can‚Äôt string a few coherent sentences together.  He would get chewed up and spit out by every foreign leader in the world. I keep watching Biden and his mental capability has dramatically declined.   Just watch his interviews.
Laugh now, don‚Äôt get too complacent! If Biden wins, you won‚Äôt be exempt  from increasing crime, mob rage, nor cyber-bullies. I doubt your smugness will remain if protestors  rob your house &amp; threaten to kill you!
I am voting for what I always vote for.   Supreme Court Low taxes. Strong natl defense.  Why do you vote. Biden has been in DC since 1972. He has never accomplished anything. He has never managed anything. Doesn‚Äôt know one thing about job creation. Or the economy. Same for Rice
They think black people are stupid and they think we will vote for West rather than Biden! Trust me... we are not stupid and we will vote for BIDEN!

Complete and utter disaster. This whole Biden catastrophe has got to be some sort of conspiracy. There is just no way that the DNC wants to actually win if they‚Äôre keeping this dumpster fire candidate. No way. They could have replaced him by now and haven‚Äôt. Question is...why.

What Biden is peddling too little, too late.  Besides I don't trust him to keep any progressive promises because the very first thing he did as a candidate was to promise the donor class that nothing would change for them.  I REALLY want change, so I will change my voting.

Real talk, the very best way of convincing a leftist to vote for Biden is by shutting the fuck up about it. Trying to shame or condescend me about Trump is only going to make my obstinate-ass dig my heels in.
You aren't convincing a single person to vote for Biden, and you know that.

Basically trump lose and Biden wins.

My interpretation of his words. Trump supporters always try to explain what Trump meant.   It's a shame that whatever you heard Biden say is exactly what it is but when Trump says something, he didn't mean it that way.  How do YOU interpret "My father was born in Germany?"

Joe Biden was not chosen until the last week of August. He shouldn‚Äôt be forced to hurry a decision. And, if African Americans do not see the danger in #45 and ready to vote, that‚Äôs not Biden‚Äôs fault.
The debate's are meaningful, and revealing! If Joe Biden is not able to verbally spar with an American President, how can hold office, and interact with foreign president's, and other leaders? What's he going to do, send Jill with a note??
Trump supporters don't care that he fawns over dictators, but opponents care very much. This is one reason among many why some of us who don't agree with Biden on much, are inclined to vote for him anyway. A running mate who also fawns over dictators would neutralize that issue.

Ehh...I dunno. Should Trump lose, he'll have to leave the White House eventually. Biden could possibly even have Secret Service kick him out.  Chances are more likely he'll have someone piss on the bed on the way out, due to his sheer pettiness.
GOP must do something to prevent the cheating. Otherwise, the election will certainly go to Biden.
Disagree. First "no," and the one Luntz cited, was a clear answer to the question: do you flatly rule this out, yes or no." The later promise to beat Biden "fair and square" leaves weasel room for "yes we'll accept foreign interference again, and it will be fair and square."

&lt;Sees "Mulatto" trending on Twitter&gt;  Please don't be a Biden gaffe please don't be a Biden gaffe please don't be a Biden gaffe..... &lt;clicks&gt;...
Biden's gonna get at least 90% of the Black vote, folks. These "gaffes" don't change anything. Any Dem nominee for President is guaranteed to win at least 90% of the Black vote these days.
It‚Äôs a virus. Unless he has a magic wand, there‚Äôs nothing more our President could have done. Hillary, Obama, or Biden‚Äôs actions would‚Äôve been similar, if not identical. You deranged, TDS infected libs are so far gone, you‚Äôve lost all sense of reality.
While this may be correct, I feel quite sure this criticism of Trump is in response to his recent rantings about Biden. You know the old saying - pot calling the kettle black. Biden has made word errors and has stuttered thru speeches, however doesn't dis Trump on his gafs.
Who's the Bully...a reporter challenges Biden about his mental state and Biden accuses him of being on cocaine...anytime Biden gets a tough question which is rare... he bullys the reporter

What did Joe Biden just say!!?
Biden's a practicing Catholic, lol?
A lot of people are very bullish on Garcia but if anything, Trump's political fortunes have sunk further since May. Based on the trends and polling elsewhere, Biden is going to carry CA-25 by double digits and it's gonna be a tough race for Garcia.

Ah bud...are you okay?? Did Biden hurt you that bad that you‚Äôre just saying random stuff now??
Also, I think it's more likely that my elderly beagle will chase down the squirrel that sits on the trellis and critters at him than it is that Biden tweets anything. So technically the Twitterer didn't say the other thing.
Nope- and these idiot lefties pan Trump for how he pronounces Thailand and Yosemite.... Biden couldn‚Äôt find them on the map....
JFC, do you not watch Pelosi and Biden? Those two buffoons can‚Äôt pronounce cat. GTFOH, can you people possibly be more petty??
Who are you VOTING FOR silly woman? Biden? The abortionists?
When asked if he could "hurt God" as his opponent alleged, Joe Biden shoved back one sleeve and said, "You're darn skippy. I'd give him the ol' one-two, straight in the pucker, just like on the corner back in my shoeshine days. We didn't take no guff or malarkey, deity or not."
Biden believes in a woman's right to kill her children...and he's a Marxist ...thats not someone who is with God...but you better wear a mask!
I‚Äôm not voting for Biden. That‚Äôs all I know for now.
Let‚Äôs get a calendar and put a red X on every Sunday that Trump went to church in the last four years and a blue X for Biden. Want to place bets on what that calendar looks like?
Biden's message is very clear and focused.  Yo Semite and Thigh-land are trump's words.
You misunderstood, understandably, but you'll get it if you take a minute. He's talking about a "landslide" election in which Biden is flipping states (red-to-blue). Those states are ranked by probability of a win (even if &lt;50%). Big drop in prob after TX. AK next most prob flip.
Joe Biden has ‚Äúpolices‚Äù?  ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If Joe Biden is capable of hurting your god, you don't have much of a god.
Don't get the Republican desire to get Biden on the debate stage. It's not like Trump is a great debater or doesn't have a habit of saying controversial things.
Lol lol lol black people voting for Biden are really brainless. Biden is pondering to us the Hispanics because the democrats know they lost the black vote. #Biden2020 #BidenIsARacist
I JUST CAN'T HANDLE THIS  He knows exactly who he's talking to. They'll eat it up.  Nevermind that Biden is a Catholic. The almighty Trump says he's anti-God, then it must be true
I mean, you have a choice between Biden and the current moron, whose negligence and ego have cost tens of thousands of lives.  But sure, let it come down to the VP pick.
If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, you‚Äôre voting for Trump, sweetie
If you‚Äôre voting for Joe Biden you might actually be a racist üëÄ Unlike the Trump supporters you tried to peg that on in 2016
I know who &amp; what Trump and Biden are. If you don't at this point you won't be capable of evaluating a debate. I think Biden will mop the floor w/ Trump, but even if Biden comes out &amp; curls up in a fetal ball on stage I'll vote for him. Trump is a plague upon us, literally.
You didn't put the record player on at night like Uncle Joe Biden told you to do?
The people who are pro NRA weren't going to be voting for Joe Biden....
That much everyone seems to agree on. Trump is definitely down from 2016 but nothing shows Biden leading. I know Democrats are polling the general election for the House race. I simply don't buy that Republicans aren't. It doesn't make sense.
My source further elaborates that he has not seen anything from Republicans showing a Biden lead. Possible this is an unweighted poll though (before they weight it to match the electorate). Outside groups have done polling here and they match campaign. Trump down from 16.
youtube is desperately trying to dissuade me away from voting for biden but every ad they show me just convinces me more... like ohh no hes gonna defund the police and raise taxes! exactly the things i want to happen!
It is a Binary Choice..... A vote for Biden is a vote for Liberal Facsism 100% and a Vote for a minor candidate is a non-vote.
You think your debate skills are going to change anyone‚Äôs mind?  You were horrible in the debates with Hilary- lumbered around the stage like an oaf shouting random words.  You‚Äôre pathetic.  There is nothing more we need to see- mailing in my vote for Biden ASAP!

Will this turn out gun owners to vote against Biden?
As people age, they lose inhibition and speak their thoughts rather bluntly. These racist thoughts are flowing out of Biden due to age-related cognitive decline.
It‚Äôs very simple. Joe Biden expects to get 99% of the Black vote and about 75% of the Latino vote.

Because that's what Trump is doing.  He's hiding in the bunker on the floor.   Everything Trump says is wrong with Biden is really wrong with him.
Beautifully putted, Mr. President! Big media and new media, don‚Äôt want the debate! They don‚Äôt want America to know what it is obvious, Biden, is not up to the task!  Trump 2020!!! üá∫üá∏

You should know all about impotence..I mean incompetence. Birds of a feather.  I bet you and Biden would get along great in rambling babbling convo.
My concern would be for younger voters, regardless of race. Might vote for Kanye as a joke when they would have voted for Biden out of hatred for Trump. I‚Äôm just speculating though. I hope young voters would be serious about 2020 elections though. ü§ûüèª
It‚Äôs truly disgusting. Why not retire &amp; spend the rest of their days being cozy?? &amp; I can‚Äôt believe we don‚Äôt have a nonpartisan something in place 2 make sure candidates are mentally healthy. Trump, Kanye and Biden may all be mentally compromised. We know they‚Äôre not totally well

I see what you did there. Can President Biden name his Cabinet now? It will lower the Nation‚Äôs blood pressure.
And the first Black Woman to get the job on top of that? This is the same woman who said it‚Äôs time to ‚Äúlet the Anita Hill thing go.‚Äù But Kamala is supposed to apologize for DEBATING Biden? It‚Äôs all fishy to me. Jill doesn‚Äôt want 2 take a backseat 2 a black woman.
What I‚Äôve been thinking the entire time. Joe Biden never should have run, I‚Äôm willing to bet she was all for it. She wants the same amount of attention as Michelle, not possible. And no chance if it‚Äôs Harris, no matter what project she takes on. VP has never been more important.
"Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report"
Thanks to you, I‚Äôm aware that Republicans trying to get Kanye on the ballot to take votes from Biden is nowhere close to the dirtiest trick ever pulled in a presidential race. Still... ewwww!
Lol !  Those folks were not going to vote for Biden.
Repub losers are trying to get Kanye West on several states' ballots, hoping he'll be able to siphon votes from Vice President Joe Biden, thereby giving trump an edge...and a "win." But poetic justice may prevail here. Maybe folks will trade their trump vote for Kanye, instead!üò°
Black folks who might vote for Kanye were Not going to vote for Biden anyway.  If anything, it might pull those few black voters away from trump.
This is so true !  Black folks who might vote for Kanye were Not going to vote for Biden anyway !
Kamala Harris would be a good pick. If he picks someone else, I'm good with that too. If he picks a can of tomato soup, I'm still voting for Biden.
As long as Donald Trump loses and Biden wins, I don‚Äôt care how it is predicted. I just hope he‚Äôs correct and you Rachel. I admire you very much!
Don‚Äôt even. Biden was the first elected official to publicly support gay marriage.
Jill is new voice of Biden. No hint of cognitive decline when she speaks!

If Kamala Harris is selected as VP, does that mean you won't vote for Biden?
Trump's campaign knocks on a million doors a week. Biden's knocks on zero.
I grew up in a Rep home also. Started changing in college then became solidly Dem as I started my teaching career. I clash with my Rep dad a lot (mom leans D now), but I‚Äôm glad he at least hates Trump. I was shocked when he voted Hillary bc he hates her. He‚Äôll vote Biden this yr.
I think it speaks volumes that they know the party can't broaden its appeal with Black voters and is therefore just focused on taking votes away from Biden.
It shouldn't make any difference to you who former VP Biden chooses as his VP since you're not voting for him anyway !
99% of dead people support Biden and they WILL BE VOTING BY MAIL
Those of us who have parents exhibiting speech and memory issues from forms of dimentia recognize it in Biden. People who have it Do Not know they have it and often argue with those who take care of them. They can‚Äôt operate a remote much less a nation.

Politically Trump can attack Biden on lots of things, but after that interview cognitive decline shouldn‚Äôt be one of them. It‚Äôs like me saying a guy has a big head; it could be true, but I‚Äôm not the one to make that point.
He is bot! But if GOP makes him get on the ballot some stupid idiots will vote for him...b/c Biden is ‚Äúnot very exciting‚Äù. Happened in 2000, 2010 when idiots voted for third party.

Joe Biden is running for president... he's not the president yet.  Like,  he doesn't have the job, he's still in the interview process. He's been through debates where he laid out some policy proposals, but there haven't been any debates since the plague year began.
Not hardly. Putin knows damn well he can't trample on America while Trump is president. Biden on the other hand would be a weak puppet to Putin, and he knows it.
Is Biden going to be any better? Almost certainly. The people around him are going to be far better, smarter people who believe in the role of government. Is Biden some political genius? No. But the people who fill his cabinet will be. Unlike today.
I can't wait to watch. Every time Trump lies he needs to be called a liar. That way,the only thing that Biden has to keep saying is - that's a lie, that's a lie, that's a lie!  #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

Barely   Although Biden *might* have some cognitive problems, he will at least listen to the health advisors about covid, and hopefully not go against them.  It's not even "we want Biden" it's more of "we don't want Trump" haha
‚ÄúThe base is high 30s and that won Trump the primary but he largely won the general election because Hillary was so unpopular. And Biden‚Äôs negatives are not as high as Hillary‚Äôs so there‚Äôs a big problem.‚Äù

Biden should only debate Trump if T‚Äôs tax returns are released.  Biden gains nothing by debating this BS artist.
I agree that it should be Biden's decision, however we are free to advocate for the candidate of our choice.  That's how we do it here in America!  And I do hope he doesn't choose Daffy Duck, Hun.

Great article. I'm tired of hearing, "Are we ready for a woman VP/President?" Nothing dispels that like a win. Also, we can't overlook the need to get out the vote; the VP pick is key to that. Many will vote for Biden regardless, but a good VP pick can fire up uninspired voters.
Biden won‚Äôt implement any of those things. Biden won‚Äôt even be elected.

Same old story.#FDR after Hoover, Clinton after Reagan After Bush #1, Obama after W, and Biden after Trump! Just to name a few.
Biden is referred to as the presumptive nominee.  Will Democrats really nominate him at their convention? If they do, then he should debate. Otherwise it is fair to conclude that he is incapable of doing so.

Why? Why would you vote for Biden? What policies does he focus on that interest you the most? What has Biden done throughout his career that will benefit US? What does he bring to the table?
The media wants us to believe that Biden is ahead in all the polls and they want mail-in voting so they can cheat then if Biden wins they can say, "He won because the polls showed he was ahead."

as a NC resident this my exact sentiment. Tuesdays primary results and other progressive wins this year have given me hope. Also Brooks would have wanted me to vote for Biden so I'm reluctantly voting Biden like Michael would have wanted IMO. Love and solidarity Beth!
But they say Biden isn't hiding...if this is his idea of fighting for the presidency and soul of America he clearly doesn't fight very hard
Not so much fear, more like realization that Biden is an idiot. Dude said if u don‚Äôt vote for him u ain‚Äôt black. Like cmon bruh. U prolly don‚Äôt even know why u hate trump. Give me a reason

The ticket is already energized.  Biden needs someone competent and with well rounded experience to get this train wreck straighted out.  Domestically and internationally.  Only Rice is that qualified....
Exactly. If Obama didn't take any guns away after 20 toddlers we slaughtered then Biden won't take any away now.

Didn't she compare voting for him to eating excrement? That might be a tough sale for Biden.
Do you think Biden could be putting on a show to avoid prosecution for extortion in Ukraine and conspiring with Obama/ Clinton's FBI Russia coupe?

Yep Trump's draining the swamp that's why they want him out even before he became President I just wonder when they are going to get Obama he just as guilty so is the Clinton's even Joe Biden I saw a you tube clip his hands all over a little girl
The reason democrats are allowing rioting in their cities over police is to avoid the riots of US citizens talking about Clinton, Obama- Biden  using the whole DNC and FBI friends to try and steal an election they needed to win in order to hide their crimes
Clarifies? You are a joke,  He said on June 29 or 30 that he was being tested all the time.  So, your headline should read:  Regarding cognitive testing, Biden lied
I think if the DNC had a better candidate than Biden and Trump would be toast. If Obama could run again, Trump would never had won in 2016.
I find it funny how people look for any little thing they didn‚Äôt like hearing out of a trump interview just to slander him bc that‚Äôs ‚Äúthe thing‚Äù to do these days seems like. Yet these same people think joe Biden is fit to be president talking about kids touching his leg hairs ü§î

Like reporters who don't follow up and let Biden Weasel out answering Questions
The truth being seen. Biden is a sick man and his family should be ashamed for not protecting him.
Very true. Trump would chew him up. Not his fault. Dementia is a sad disease. For his family to allow this to be done to him is down right sad. Biden is being used in the worst way...by his family.
The (D) Party knows how to fix everything, but they never do.  8 years of Obama-Biden - the US should be a perfect Utopia.

I know nothing, and I don't know people who know things at this level, but I suspect there was some ferocious pushback internally at the quotes trashing Harris. Props to the Biden team for corralling Rendell.

Okay my Canadian peeps who do you all want Biden's VP to be? Whom ever he chooses the media will be ready to shred their record apart. I will just be glad when he chooses one.

Biden won't let that std factory any where near him.
If Biden gets elected &amp; they control all 3 phases I really hate to think not only the military but the whole country would be like. I remember Clinton cutting the military &amp; every year the budget was used up by June therefore no training for 6 months every yr &amp; Base closings!

Biden is horrible in my opinion... he is just like trump as well. The thing that makes trump more appealing is that he know what he‚Äôs doing most of the time... we don‚Äôt need a president who has stage 4 dementia.
I‚Äôm tired of you blind Biden supporters not listen to facts. How can anyone support a guy like Trump but liberal. Fact don‚Äôt care about you feelings bitch. We don‚Äôt need Trump or Biden. What makes you think Biden will do the things he‚Äôs been trying to do for 40+ years. (he won‚Äôt)

Love Bernie but if the rest of the demd don't settle for biden then we're just gonna get trump again, not voting is also a vote for the person you dont want to win
Biden needs a VP who can take tough questions on the spot about race &amp; social issues. He,or we,need a VP who has a eloquent yet determined disposition that isn‚Äôt easily offended by reporters. We need someone who keeps their cool in the line of fire, but articlates with strength.
‚ÄúMy Statement on  Faith‚Äù by Joe Biden Anyone can research Trumps faith/ church history. I did about a yr ago. You will find in NY;  Before elected  "joined the church but never attended", statement by the pastor.
We‚Äôre with you. I hope you get VP! Biden / Harris!
She opened my eyes to a new way to consider Joe Biden. And as a leader, he will be imperfect, but he‚Äôs a good, decent man who will try to do everything he can to help all Americans. That‚Äôs 180 from what we‚Äôve seen with Trump.
LOL, every time Trump interrupts with "wrong" or straight up insults someone without making a point, drink. Every time Biden forgets what his point was mid sentence, or puts his foot in his mouth, drink.
Trying! But know too many white family/friends who‚Äôs heels are so dug in, they don‚Äôt see the idiotic things Trump does. They only hear Fox News telling them to be mad at the media for reporting on these big blunders. And they compare them to any insignificant misstep by Biden.
Isn't it interesting how the media jumps on DJT so quickly, yet Biden has repeatedly made a fool out of himself lately, and nothing is said by the same press?
I totally agree with that. I wish you were running for president. You can fix this nation. I am unsure about Biden. You won New Hampshire.
It doesn‚Äôt appear that things have been locked down yet. Older well known and loved voices are as important as new voices. I expect them to include both. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see those critical of Biden to not be included and some of those are younger ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù.
He definitely trips over his words constantly, but that's pretty much all right-leaning publications say about him.. hell even the New York Times has an article about it..  it's not like it's not mentioned lol
Wow. I stopped reading at ‚ÄúBiden knows...‚Äù ü§£
Those behaviors don‚Äôt make him a racist? COM! If W had made the same series of statements, the left would be screaming racist. For Trump, if he clears his throat they yell racist. So why does Biden, with his lousy record, get a pass?

So Trump stated today that Biden is against God &amp; he wants to hurt God. That‚Äôs not just crazy, it‚Äôs horrifically dangerous &amp; untrue. That‚Äôs why I tweeted. I know Joe would never say that about Trump. But Trump is trying to rally his base. Like 20/21 tweets today were positive :)

Truth Bomb from Flynn's attorney.  The Obama/Biden/Clinton Mafia were scared to death that Flynn was getting ready to expose their crimes.
Hot take: Biden is actually fairly coherent in this clip. I don't think he was asking the reporter if he "was a junkie," but instead going on a weird tangent about his son &amp; cocaine.   "I want America to judge my physical and mellal, milal, mental fildess."
Sadly, nothing anyone says is clear. Biden because he doesn't remember, so his promises change, and Trump because the media twists what he says.

I think Kamala Harris is a reverse racist and I hope Joe Biden does not pick her for his vice president running mate I do not like the way she came at him when they were deciding who was going to be the Democratic FrontRunner.
Voting by mail would be through USPS. The same USPS union that just endorsed Biden for president.  Imagine that.

Well, to be fair his staff did the plagiarizing. Biden is just a puppet at this point who just reads off of the prompter. They wont let Biden answer questions because he has put his foot in his mouth so much he has athlete tongue.
Biden wants us to wear masks for 3 months minimum. So, right up to the election. Coincidence?
In case there‚Äôs the slightest chance Kamala becomes the Vice President, let me be the first to say: Biden didn‚Äôt kill himself
Most republicans don‚Äôt even like trump and most democrats don‚Äôt like Biden or Kamala how did we choose them as our main characters
The Biden/Harris campaign need to address the attack on our law enforcement. Explain that ‚Äúdefunding‚Äù police departments is not gonna happen. There may be some restructuring measures recommended but not defunding.
Imagine that. Guess she is using the same speech writers as Joe Biden
"Just go" is right. Because in what universe does Joe Biden and Kamala Harris embrace the far left? They're about as moderate as democrats get.
Sorry bitch Kamala, obama Biden era was NOT the greatest recovery. When I apply for ANY job employers bite at the bit, during that time I COULDNT GET A JOB SHOVELING SHIT ..  your a L I A R !
Awesome roll out with Biden-Harris just now! They sound like the President-VP America deserves after all this mess from the last 4 years.  I'm going to volunteer in my area of NC. Gotta carry this state! So excited!
This isnt Joe Biden he is on TV live and he is not on his phone
I knew Joe Biden didn't do his own tweets. This one was sent while he was on TV introducing his VP pick.  Look at the time from my twitter page and TV.
LOL if you guys wanted her so bad why didn‚Äôt you guys vote for her? Just remember she believes Joe Biden‚Äòs accuser‚Äôs and indirectly called him a racist personally I thought the last three in the debates would‚Äôve been Biden Sanders and Harris
Come on man (Biden) fake hahaha (Harris)

No...I think of someone not being a sheep...you obviously would be easily led...you probably think Biden is a sane competent choice too??? So sad
Yes, China would prefer Joe Biden.  But why?  Because they know Joe Biden is weak and through harsh negotiations Joe will give the Communist Chinese every thing they want.  Where Trump will stand up to them for better   negotiations that work better for the American people.
It‚Äôs amazing with all his benefits, plus the lies, that Trump trails Biden in most polls.  Perhaps it‚Äôs just Trump overload, people are third of his whining, dishonesty, complete failure on handling virus, juvenile name calling &amp; lack of responsibly on everything.
Why is it with celebrities and Democrats the sky is always falling? She is right this is an important election because if you‚Äôre scared more about the coronavirus then a Joe Biden presidency you are the problem

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait....  Is Biden incompetent and feeble  OR  Is he powerful enough to hurt God  Which is it????
As person who prefers Republicans to democrats but likes Biden (the person) more than trump and sees both parties paying less attention to people with my views, I feel the only way I can make my voice heard is voting for someone else.Cops want strong leadership not a feckless buffoon.
Imagine taking the time to type this considering what Joe Biden is... wow
I trust her. Much more than I trust Biden.
The results from our August 12-13 poll of registered voters is in. The report won't be released until Monday, but we have a tie between Biden and Trump, 47%-47%.
Wrong, your boy has been trying for 40 years.
Though Biden has previously supported nationwide mask-wearing, he specified his call in remarks earlier Thursday, saying that every American should wear a mask when they're in public for the next three months "at a minimum" and every governor should make it a mandate immediately.
Nothing will stop me from voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
But the choice is one or the other.  A reasonable centrist vs an inept lying science rejecting person who is ruining our country.  BTW- the Biden suggestion for a mask mandate was for in public outdoor settings.

TIL (on Facebook) that the Biden Harris official platform is to destroy America, and the post was also #factchecked so it‚Äôs definitely true.
So is everybody just gonna forget how Harris spent the past year continuously harshing Biden? She has called him racist and has made it known that didn‚Äôt think he was mentally capable of handling the job. But I guess kissing up to the winner is what you do when you lose.
Thank god #Biden is out of the basement and spinning some shit against trump. #BidenHarris2020
Your og tweet certainly didn't sound like a "this is good strategy" tweet. It sounded like a "this is why Biden is good" tweet.
Qui pro Quo Joe Biden caved to pressure to pick a black female VP candidate...now that he had caved in from the far left liberals what else will he have in to.  They will kill American businesses with government regulations &amp; taxes, and will tax the working middle class.

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden picked U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, and the reaction is pouring in for the historic announcement.
I fucking hate Neo-liberals like Biden and Harris
Trump is not a racist, he has implemented laws to help blacks.  Unlike Joe Biden &amp; Democrats who grandstand for black votes, Trump walks the walk, not talk.
Amazing. Biden picks someone who challenged him. Look forward to a Cabinet meeting that doesn't look North Korean with all the slobbery praise. Trump is fucked and you know it.
I bet you would, then you‚Äôll have someone, or in this case the same person to blame if Biden follows Hillary‚Äôs establishment campaign playbook and loses as well
Still voting Biden, I was unhappy to before, but I'm fucking depressed about it now. So many exceptional women, several of colour, and Biden goes with the cop who has an awful record in sentencing reforms, unjust penalties, and prison labor. Also iffy on LGBT.

Biden specifically? It just looks like a random man to me.

Kamala Harris is the feds I cant rock with trump or Biden but this America always choosing between 2 bad candidates
I will be voting for Biden/Harris ONLY to get him out of office. However, I still think it‚Äôs critical to discuss the problems with them, and the DNC/democratic establishment. Them &amp; republicans are two sides of the same coin. They are all to the right. They are not progressive.

Perhaps there is a misunderstanding. It seems you are saying I don‚Äôt think black people are equals after I just said I want Rice for VP. To clarify, there are many qualified black women so it‚Äôs a difficult choice for Biden. We need her foreign relations, et al experience.

constantly lies about EVERYTHING and  stays silent.  Biden makes speaking "gaffe" and
You can't be a devout Catholic (Biden) &amp; be a liberal Democrat. It's HIPOCRISY if you believe in ABORTION.
Think its pretty obvious Biden looks down on the Black community
Whatever you say CW.  Should I assume that since you support Biden, you enjoy sniffing little girls hair?  If you don't agree with CW, you ain't black?  Keep painting with your broad brush.
This article is so irresponsible. Trump is dangerous and mentally unfit, and there is no one that Biden could pick as his VP that would in any way shape or form justify not voting for him over Trump.
Is it better? Biden‚Äôs age is the reason everyone is stressing his VP. Normally it‚Äôs to satisfy a large demographic, in this case, it‚Äôs really to step in and become President when the time arises. Who he chooses will decide the Presidency!
I see many voters sitting this 1 out. Biden‚Äôs whole campaign is ‚Äú I‚Äôm not Trump! ‚Äú Biden turns 78 in Nov. I wouldn‚Äôt want a 78 yr. old driving me in a car, much less running the country! There will be backlash, but Dems need to blame themselves! They had 4 years to groom a champ!
The left uses every trick in the book to keep Biden off that stage with Trump! They come up with every lie and excuse to keep him away from Trump!  Biden is mentally impaired...America isn't fooled! Biden smells of fear!
What are you complaining about Joe Biden things black Americans don't think but all the same
Yeah Joe Biden is nothing but a puppet
Imagine we pay for flying this creature everywhere,  hi auto, his advance team, his secret service team, the 2 other planes w nuclear codes and backup. All to hear him say Biden is hurting God. You racist MF that still support this evil abomination. God bless your hearts
Probably. But, few of us are fundamentally persuadeable, right? Regardless of which party/which candidate we prefer. Like the few % who may vote Biden but might have  voted Trump over Bernie. Which is why the Dems blocked Bernie, but are pushing Biden 2 run on Bernie's views.
Is he talking about Biden or John Lennon?  Either way count me in.
C'mon Eric... why drag  and  on this?  is getting sh-tcanned for 'Darling  (&lt;-- see what I did there?) once Biden announces his VP candidate. And Kayleigh will 3 or 4 Press Secretaries in the past and writing her memoir by then....
Biden: Blacks all think the same way
"I support BLM. I support the removal of the statue of liberty, it represents racism and oppression. If elected president on day 1 I will sign legislation for its immediate removal." Joe Biden     Think about that America, vets.But you still weren‚Äôt sure you‚Äôd vote for Biden unless you liked the VP pick? OK, then.
Mass has supermajorities in both houses and they could have made Baker pick a Dem.  I wish Warren would have won and would have been picked but I don't think the moment gave Biden the room to pick her. I would bet he wanted to.
My patience with the Obama/Jarrett/Clinton/Pod Save America wing of the democratic party has worn paper thin in the last few years and this is a good summary of why.
I don‚Äôt care how you feel about Biden/Harris. You should be helping to scrub the orange stains off the white walls
I would never suggest that, nor did I imply it.  I loathe Trump.  I am voting Biden and I will put my body in the line of fire when the coup comes.  But I am talking to you about our leaders, who are failing us.  Don‚Äôt defend them.
Electoralism can no longer save us.  Biden will not protect us.  Only direct mass action and a #GeneralStrike will stop fascism

How much you want to bet?  The only ones caught have been REPUBLICANS.  Projecting again, you Trumpers are good at it.  Should have known what was coming when started the whole Biden sniffing hair thing.  NOW WE KNOW TRUMP HAS CHILD RAPE CHARGES.
Biden has been in DC since 1973.   Just think about that- it's the only "job" he's ever had.

The DNC and Jill Biden are horrible people putting Joe Biden in this position.  He is clearly mentally deteriorating ever week.
I'm more concerned by her limited qualifications and "on the record" opposition with Biden.   In addition, Biden excluded 93% of the population by using race &amp; gender as a prerequisite for the job.  How is this acceptable??
3 new national polls of registered voters were released today, with Biden leading by 10, 11 &amp; 13 points, all taken before the Harris VP announcement. Now you know why Trump is illegally destroying the USPS &amp; attacking voting by mail.
This is a really good piece by  about the Obama-Biden relationship, which was always a lot more complicated and tense than the fantasy version of it.
Ideally this won't be resolved this year, and with no leadership and voiding all the horrible things done, we can have a humane approach in the Biden/Harris administration.
The latest poll from NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist finds that:  üìà Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by 11 points. üìä 71% of Americans see the coronavirus as a real threat. üìâ 35% of Americans say they won't get vaccinated.  More analysis here:
these articles are probably very useful for biden and kamala herself, who probably never thought to check into her eligibility
Harris is an empty suit, along with Biden. She's a pathological liar.
Harris is an empty suit, along with Biden. She's a pathological liar. Amazing that the people running for the highest office in the land, do not know how the position even works? God helps us all!!
Trump has been in office 3 years.  Biden has been in office 48 years.  What make you think Biden will do something now?   Albert Einstein : ‚ÄúInsanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.‚Äù ...  Say no to Joe!
Good point. I think conclusions about not having a policy mandate are difficult to make in polls that demand only one response. This one simply shows that getting Trump out of office is the highest priority for Biden voters.
Not sure you can reach this conclusion from a poll that requires you to select only one response. Getting Trump out of office is the highest priority for those voting for Biden. Full stop.
Trump, Biden tied in NC heading into this month‚Äôs nominating conventions #ncpol
Kamala supports forced gun confiscation. Choosing her has moved the Biden campaign further to the left on gun control ‚Äì more radical than any other major party campaign in recent history. Kamala‚Äôs baggage has damaged the perception that Biden is a more moderate Democrat. #2A
As a survivor of CSA and rape, I am FAR more offended by this adult woman‚Äôs interactions WITH A CHILD than I am by anything Joe Biden has ever been proven to have done with anyone. She *deliberately* and continually crossed lines with this kid. That‚Äôs appalling.
TBC - "GO VOTE" means any way that doesn't rely on the mail delivering stuff. Biden better fix the USPS - one of our great institutions.
I think if we frame it as an anti-Republican thing that would help Biden we could fool them into supporting it
But it doesn‚Äôt matter if Biden loses 10% because of voter suppression. Trump can win this if nothing is done about him blocking voting from every direction.  With what I see, I think Trump will ‚Äúwin‚Äù and this is all so depressing.
Girl, from your lips to Gods ears! So exhausted for all of us. Biden/Harris makes me believe again that good will triumph over evil. Let‚Äôs right this ship!

Tell Biden &amp; Kamala I said good luck with that.  They will need more people.  A lot more people.
Hahahaha I do not, and I truly hate thatü§¢ü§¢. But I suppose it‚Äôs not good to generalize the millennials either. Just upset about the Biden situation
I didn't address "It's always politics with Donnie."  Look at Joe Biden. Harris.. really?? Always politics with you Democrats, anything to win.  Burn the Country down to win.  We love Trump because Trump loves America. Trump is a Patriot. He puts America 1st. So FO you communist.
Perhaps but I feel like the ones that I personally know are very excited about this Biden situation and tend to lean more center. But again I cannot speak for every millennial. Will read though
I have my 2008 Obama one still on the car! But the very minute I learned that Biden had chosen Kamala Harris, I sent off for a Biden Harris sticker! I was so demoralized after Hillary lost, then I took that sticker off pretty quickly.
Besides Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, whose convention speech are you most excited to hear?
Trump should debate Biden 3 times and the fourth debate against Kamala since she‚Äôll be governing
Right.  Trumps been in public office for 3 years.  Joe Biden has been in public office for 48 years.  Do nothing Joe.  Except make his family rich.
yeah me too, don‚Äôt get me wrong.  I am voting Biden.  But I do believe we need to push them to be better when we can

Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks...power hungry fools
Glasses fogging up. Was he also moved by the announcement that Kamala would join Biden on the ticket?
Question:  Kamala Harris ran in the primary all last year, and she's been the frontrunner for Biden's running mate ever since he got the nomination.  How are the Republicans SO unprepared for her?  Did they convince themselves that Biden would pick Warren?
Biden is a racist. I concur.
This should be enough to push NC to Biden in the 538 model, no?
New  poll has Biden +1 in NC, Cal +3, Cooper +10.
Nuclear reactor accident followed by leaked letter showing Biden pushed to get it up and running back in the 70s.
Let‚Äôs be clear, if you don‚Äôt vote because you don‚Äôt agree with Biden‚Äôs pick. YOU ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP.
Since we are comparing circumstances, Bernie wasn‚Äôt a realistic alternative after Super Tuesday. The momentum shifted and Biden clearly claimed victory. Polling and votes were against him.
I'm less concerned by her temperament than her qualifications.  In addition, Biden excluded 93% of the population by using race &amp; gender as a prerequisite for the job.  How is this acceptable?
Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's newly minted running mate, told The  Politics Podcast last year that the next DOJ would have "no choice" but to act.  Biden has said that pursuing criminal charges against Trump would be "a very, very unusual thing."
"Americans are accustomed, still, to discussing the notion of a woman in power in terms of toleration and palatability."
Are they threatening Biden? Are they asking others to do their dirty work? The network should reprimand them. This is not news nor opinion.
Ironic that you meanly label Biden in this Tweet calling out meanness and condescension. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
You can't possibly believe this- right?   Who is "excited" about a 78 year old career politician who has been in DC for 47 years!  This is the best the Dems have to offer?   Close race for sure but Trumps base is strong and Biden/Harris doesn't energize anyone.  4 more yrs..

Kamala Harris prosecuted trump/pence yesterday in stark, definitive terms.  She laid out the failures of trump point by point. Her statements were precise, accurate and by trump/pence reactions afterwards devastating. Congratulations Senator Harris.  Biden/Harris 2020

We got a new stainless fridge in January and I haven‚Äôt re-magged it yet. I‚Äôm torn between maintaining the aesthetic of having new, matching appliances for the first time in my life, and restoring the awesome chaos of my crap. I think a Biden/Harris magnet could break the tie.

No, it wasn‚Äôt dangerous in the least hahahahaha   Nothing Obama did weighs on Biden. Biden is his own person.
47 years of zero and I mean zero accomplishments. He's had 1 job his entire life.  What new and fresh ideas will Biden bring to the table??   Stock market will hit an all time high this week.  TRUMP
He is an absolute sellout; and Biden has zero dignity
Biden is absolutely screwed
No, 3+ years apart.  However, Biden has been milking America for 47 years! Numb nuts...
Trump shouldn‚Äôt even be allowed to run. He‚Äôs. Heated the entire time staring w/Giuliani digging up dirt on Biden in Ukraine, to Kushner colluding with Kanye for a bogus ballot run and Trump slowing down the postal service. He‚Äôs a dirt bag and a cheat!
I have a bunch of examples of what Biden has done and said‚Äînone of them positive. I remember, even though he probably doesn‚Äôt. üòâ
Exactly! Someone (political blue check) said a desperate candidate asks for more debates. Hoping Biden denies and he can attack him for it? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Biden has nothing to gain by debating Trump. Nothing at all. He's already in the lead. When someone asks for an additional debate (the Trump camp just did) it means they know their candidate is tanking. That said, Trump won't do any, let alone four.

I was sad for about 10 days after Warren dropped out of the race.   Then I dusted myself off and put on my big boy boots, because Trump is that bad.   If you need to be spoon fed reasons to vote for Biden-Harris, you're less reasonable than my toddler.
But Sanders endorses Biden. By that logic, he also isn‚Äôt a progresssive.
Yeah the OP wasn‚Äôt disputing that.  The point is that Biden was handsy with women and that made Reade more plausible.  Morse has no comparable, visible record of misconduct.  There is a really obvious difference there
While stricter gun control measures have at times been a major part of Harris‚Äô campaign platforms, the issue was barely raised at Wednesday's press conference.
I was genuinely impressed by Biden and Harris modeling social distancing at this event. I know it‚Äôs a formality, but that‚Äôs the point. Leaders *should* model proper public health behavior. It matters!  I also love that they‚Äôre selling Biden/Harris masks.
How do you top the words of Biden and Harris which sounded like a beautiful symphony in contrast.
Milli Vanilli would be an appropriate analogy for Biden and Harris. 100% fake and full of poo.
Just in case you forgot Joe Biden will be 78 in November.
that would be great, i hope they do.  Biden‚Äôs current plan doesn‚Äôt even restore the tax rate to the (low) level it was at under Obama
Sure that could happen...but why doesn't Biden win MS then, not to mention NC.  (Or OH for that matter.)
What a delight to think of all the highly competent people who could be part of the Biden administration
Okay, sure Trump could win NH...but how does Biden win LA at the same time...while not winning MS...but winning GA...and not winning NC???

So what? The dispute is not that the prosecutor was corrupt; the point is that Biden was on the take, so he pushed the firing for his own personal ulterior motives

Trump‚Äôs failure to contain COVID has absolutely cratered the economy. Not talking about numbers on Wall Street. Talking about people‚Äôs lives, and jobs!  Voting for Biden, and Harris.

Biden could have picked Donald trump jr as his running mate and I‚Äôd still have to vote for him, why does anyone care who it is
It goes so far out of bounds. He is supposed to be apolitical. Talk about bias. He needs to resign. He needs to be held accountable even after Biden wins.
Biden struggles with green or red jello.  He didn't pick Harris.
Well best of luck in the election then. I hope Biden and his disaster of a pick will make you proud ü§£ü§£ü§£  You don‚Äôt look long for this world, however. So perhaps whether Trump wins or not (he‚Äôs going to win in a landslide), you won‚Äôt have to endure him.

Crucial thread. Look we have to vote Biden/Harris- but we also have to know exactly who we‚Äôre electing. Harris is pro-police, pro-war, pro-corporation &amp; has voted to further oppression of BIPOC Americans COUNTLESS times. Ethnicity &amp; gender do not a hero make.
I love how excited Kamala Harris‚Äôs colleagues are about her selection as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate. People who worked with her back in the day and people who work with her now have all said how great she is.   It‚Äôs nice to have candidates who just know how to work as a team.

Third, she‚Äôs qualified and competent for the position, and will be a good leader if Biden has to step down for something like a medical issue. Finally, it‚Äôs depressing that people continue to try and divide us, on the left and the right. What we need is unity, not division.
It pisses me off that people are saying ‚ÄúKamala‚Äôs bad bc she‚Äôs a cop!‚Äù First of all, she was a prosecutor, and prosecuted people according to the laws in place. Secondly, nominating her damaged the Trump argument that Biden‚Äôs soft on crime and will let antifa destroy cities. 1/2

We will vote for Biden/Harris BECAUSE she ‚Äúwas nasty to Brett Kavanaugh‚Äù in your words.
Harris is such the right pick. I was worried honestly that Biden would feel outclassed next to her and run away. Cudos to him for making the choice.
Great, historic choice! I‚Äôm so thrilled that Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs pick for VP! (And yes, for pete‚Äôs sake, I know that‚Äôs Maya Rudolph below. Did you see the movie CHiPs? Harris was in that. Rudolph took over as attorney general of California during filming. Facts matter!)
Could‚Äôve had Bernie and we ended up with biden and kamala aint that some shit
Again, it‚Äôs politics. You eill a candidate that will add to the ticket and bring more voters. It‚Äôs a game of numbers not a correctness. Plus she is the best to run with Biden based on the climate.
How would Lester feel if Biden asked him if he took a cocaine test?
Democrats will capture the White House and Congress too. Just watch now, Excellent choice of VP by Joe Biden
Don't make Biden snap his fingers in a Z formation

I know the thought of burning it all down seems glamorous, but if you burn it while Trump is in charge, the left is going to be caught in the fire and we set ourselves back and we put so many vulnerable people at risk. Vote Biden/Harris and then hold them accountable.

SAME! I'm not really interested in watching the Biden vs Trump debates, but am so stoked to watch Kamala eviscerate Mike Pence

Did we forget thar Biden has been coined a long time supporter of law enforcement, who advocated for increased police funding for "reform" in response to the Ferguson protests?
Did we all forget? Did we forget that there were tanks in Ferguson, MO while Biden was VP? Did we forget that rubber bullets were being shot at protestors while Biden was VP? Did we forget that the department of justice ruled Michael Brown not a victim, while Biden was VP?

I think Romney would be well suited to be Secretary of State in a Biden administration.
Oh, Biden is still embarrassing. Absolutely. But on a much more amateur level than Trump.
I think even a lot of the GOP legislators silently would prefer him to 4 more years of Trump. Biden is someone they can work with, and knows everybody has to walk away from the table with something they need for their constituents.

My thoughts exactly!
Get over it and vote for Biden!
Nothing you or Biden have proposed would improve the situation. Trump has advocated reopening the schools and the economy precisely to help those who are out of work and allow kids to get an education. Lockdown and wear masks until we have a vaccine is not a strategy.
She's staying in the Senate and watching you Biden and Harris üßê.

So the  poll (CPD used in 2016) released today asks about Biden and Trump and does NOT mention any other candidate. So when  hides behind their arbitrary requirement of 15% to participate in a debate, just remember, THEY AREN‚ÄôT EVEN ASKING ABOUT OTHER CANDIDATES!
Biden, Harris Want To Force Schools To Let Biological Males into Girls' Sports
Trying to figure out who‚Äôs more mentally deranged ... you ... or  U.S PRESIDENT TRUMP: ‚ÄúAT EVERY TURN, BIDEN HAS BEEN WRONG ABOUT THE VIRUS - IGNORING THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE‚Äù
Thinking of starting a PAC - NC Republicans for Biden. Need to get rid of this monster and his enablers (which includes you Senator Tillis).
Do that at the debate Mr President.  So the works can see.  Go on.  Avoid.  And then watch Vice President Biden answer every question in complete sentences and in complete honesty.  He was so flustered because he doesn‚Äôt know truth.
Joe Biden is also a bad representative of my values, but that‚Äôs another discussion. What about when trump restricts in person voting and congressional democrats do nothing but tweet and send letters on their way to yet another recess?
We need numbers great enough to transcend their creative and prolific malfeasance.     #PostalService  #USPSsabotage
Free infomercials?     Our local TV stations showed 4 interviews after Harris‚Äôs selection as the Democrat‚Äôs VP candidate.  They were nothing but non stop praise about her and Biden.
So Biden wants all Americans to wear masks for at least 3 months.....what is in 3 months? The election. #tinfoilhatthoughts
I saw a Trump commercial with a woman saying we can't rebuild if Biden is elected because he's too weak.  Biden should create, like a rap battle commercial response asking, "Now how did we get into this mess in the first place? Why exactly do we need to rebuild? Just asking?"
It‚Äôs very clear Biden said wear the masks for the next three months so that as soon as the election gets here they can say take the mask off and say it was their leadership that cured the country if they win. Just another ploy because one way or another Covid ends on November 3rd
Exactly. Their corruption is In Your Face, So What Are You Going To Do About It? It shakes your faith in people to know that so many voters will still vote for them in November. Biden's election is not a given.
Turn-out for Democrats exceeded 2016 and is on course to reach 2008 numbers.  Biden and Trump both got 18 million votes this year, but Democrats had 36 million total votes cast with a contested primary.  Biden wound up winning 51% of the vote.
Nobody's expecting Biden (or Trump) to fix all the world's problems. But it sure would be nice to have a President that wasn't actively making more!
Well for one nick cannon is a definite racist lol  but i mean obama picked joe biden as VP cause he was white so im pretty sure thats the only reason biden is picking kamala..and shes a women so even mor evotes
Very easily. Biden/Trump will focus on the NY/Calif voters, while not caring about the middle of the country. Why go to Nashville to get 500k votes when I can go to LA to get 5 million? Not getting into a political discussion but don't rewrite the constitution to benefit yourself
‚ÄúAnd right after Reagan‚Äôs ‚Äòwall‚Äô speech, Biden again took the line that Reagan shouldn‚Äôt dare to provoke the Soviet bear.‚Äù  Sheesh...has Biden been right about ANY foreign policy decision?
No one even said they weren't voting for Biden in the thread so......????
We asked the public about a number of key federal and state races, but also surveyed their opinion on several political statements/slogans, such as: - Law and Order - Black Lives Matter - Defund the Police You can take a look at these results here.
If there is a fair election and the votes are all counted cleanly (big if), then Biden will win.  If Biden wins and Trump refuses to leave, then the US military is constitutionally bound, more than able, and will likely be very willing, to escort him out of the White House.
Biden &amp; Harris  Campaign 2020!
I hope this is incorrect! Professor who accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump
Dunno ... tell me  This scared the hell out of me ...
Yeah, even if Biden wins and Trump leaves (willingly or not), 2022 is going to be very challenging.
#ncpol On the same day   completes a poll showing Biden with a one percentage point lead.....
It‚Äôs hilarious that these people think Biden has any clue how to fast track an economic recovery. The first thing he will do is give away Nancy‚Äôs 3 Trillion dollars, then raise taxes by 4 Trillion while a ton of ppl are out of work. He‚Äôll spend the SS money in his first month.
Biden can suck my balls
Historic, especially because so much ground had to be made because Obama &amp; Biden totally sold Israel up the river. Stabbed them in back
Joe Biden has never helped anyone other than his family. If you don't do anything it is virtually impossible to do anything wrong.
Honestly &amp; selecting Kamala for VP, completely solidified their stance with progressive politics/voters, Hispanic/Latino peeps, &amp; young voters. It‚Äôs honestly a shame. I can‚Äôt say I hope Biden loses but I do hope they find out how dumb it is to alienate such a large voting bloc.
Wow, just wow. Such a lie. Reagan had the longest peacetime recovery EVER. Obama and Biden destroyed the economy.  History revisionism will not work this time lady.  #reclaimingmytime
Republican voters, PLEASE force your representatives to have actual ideas and policies! Attacking the left is *not* a policy. "Biden wants to raise your taxes " Bleh - too easy. Why does he want to raise taxes? How much? Where will the $$ go? Make Haley prove it. Dig deeper.
I literally have been wondering who, if anyone, had been doing any leg work within the Biden camp to gain the Hispanic/Latino vote since Bernie dropped out and I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs no one.
I just hope if Biden becomes president ( and God I sure hope so) Kamala remembers she is vice president not the president.üòâ

The mass incarceration ticket of 2020 pledges unconditional support to Israel "unlike some Democrats." Interesting.  Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's VP pick - here's what Jewish voters should know - Jewish Telegraphic Agency  via
She's a hypocrite for calling Biden a racist and saying she believed the accusations against him SMH. She prosecuted over 1500 marijuana cases, but laughed when she was asked is she smoked. It's pathetic! Biden and her will be the incarcerating dream team.
Obama/Biden.  Hands down THE MOST CORRUPT administration in the history of our nation.  I don‚Äôt care what your politics are, open your eyes to what the Democrats have become past 20 years.  I used to be one of them.  Time for others to wake the hell up...they do nothing but lie.
Uhhhh..#Biden and #Obama already had 8 years to try to get this done but did not. #Fail
Did Biden say it would not help democracy to prosecute tRump? Oh yes hell it will sir. Along with each and every one of his criminal co-conspirators.
It should not be that close!!! Biden and Harris should be ahead by a landslide!!
ü§£ü§£ü§£ they all puppets.. ima vote for Biden though
None of them. It‚Äôs all about JoJo!! #JoJorgensen2020 !!!! Voting for Biden or Trump is a vote for old racist sex offending pedophiles!!
People can ACTUALLY SUPPORT AND VOTE FOR KAMALA because she's QUALIFIED.. not just cause she's BLACK! BIDEN-HARRIS 2020
I'm watching VP Biden speak abt the virus. What a breath of fresh air! He makes sense, I CAN trust what he says &amp; he's not degrading his apponents by calling them names &amp; acting like a bully. He's acting like an adult &amp; leader. It's like someone we've known has finally come home.
I bet Biden's happy it's only 56%!
If you don't vote for Biden, and could otherwise vote and are not disabled/afflicted in some similar way, it helps Trump win. You are, therefore, a Trump supporter. Vote for Biden and bug the hell out of him if he wins.
I think you mean ‚ÄúKamala Harris news conference‚Äù....because Joe Biden is just an empty vessel....
Obama had bipartisan cabinet. If Mitt Romney would just get some courage and come out for Biden I would have no objection to his being SecOfState--and it would also be a slap in face to Trump üòä
i dont think you cab be making fun of biden when your own idiot cant do the same
‚ÄùIf he wins, you‚Äôre going to end up with a disaster,‚Äù he claimed of Democratic rival Joe Biden."  No sense of the self-own.  Aren't we're in a disaster *right now* thanks in no small part  to your ineptitude?  Can we just skip ahead to Nov 3?
The  campaign appears to believe that Republicans can be trusted to vote by mail.  It's just Biden supporters that can't be trusted, I guess.
I'm pretty sure helping Black people wasn't in the job description packet Biden handed her.
Going to make calls for Biden to spite her now.
I'm going to go make calls for Biden to spite you, Naomi.
Anyone that believes Joe Biden writes his own tweets hasnt been paying attention.
Most of the U.S. government‚Äôs 200 immigration detention centers are run by private contractors holding asylum seekers and other immigrants accused of administrative violations or awaiting deportation.
You're forgetting how racist this version of the GOP has become. They could not conceive that Biden would actually choose someone who wasn't lily white to run with him, particularly someone as strong as Harris.
We all know thatTucker/Hannity have a huge draw nightly, and I've never contested that.  I'm saying lets look at the data on a day that Biden doesn't pick his VP in the 18-49 segment. We already know the NBA heavily outdraws all news in 18-49 demo by a landslide on a normal day.
I‚Äôm sure mlk would love Biden who is a bigot then and I‚Äôm sure he died so he could be voted for
That's great and all but please don't give the Biden administration a pass like you did for the Obama administration. If Trump taught us nothing else it's that when you ignore abuses from your side, they will be doubled down on by the other side.
There might not be any partisan differences in states that already use VBM, but if bluer states increase its use while reddish states do not, vote margins for Biden will increase.  He could win nationally by 7 million votes and yet lose in the EC.
Biden and Harris are the same as trump and Biden is a klansman who brought slave markets to Libya but these ppl against confederates got no issue with slavery we brought there
Trump will do far worse (and less) for this country than Biden but....they both suck. Politics is always choosing between the lesser of two evils. We need an ACTUAL change to the system. I‚Äôm sick of choosing between two shitty options.
And Mark responded that the data here is skewed to the topical news of Biden picking his VP. It's literally the first line in the summary of data on the link Clay provided.  But alas, its still apples and oranges, per my earlier point.
Kinda reminds me how Biden is strong enough to ride a bike, in a mask, in the summer.  Trump, on the other hand, is so unhealthy that he can barely walk down a ramp.   I would make sense that Biden might choose to get some exercise that would likely kill Trump.
vote for biden because you will be able to hold him accountable also please donot hold biden accountable because that is a vote for trump
I am afraid there is no more time to settle for these bullshit artists. Ecologically, sociologically, and financially Biden is the worst choice imaginable. It is time to quell this.
Joe Biden has welcomed progressive input in his campaign. Lefty activists are hoping Kamala Harris, his vice-presidential nominee, will be just as flexible,  reports:
Watch Joe Biden and Kamala Harris First Joint Campaign Event Here
It would help to get a commitment to a policy platform so we can hold them accountable.  So far in the last 48 hours Biden has backtracked on M4A by saying people will get free coronavirus treatment.  Dude what about after that?!?!
Obama/Biden: "Listen to scientific experts. Constantly reevaluate options." Trump/Pence: "The FDA is wrong. Listen to the demon-sperm lady. There are only two options: take Hydroxychloroquine or inject yourself with bleach."
Your tweets alone can cheer me up. I‚Äôm trying to find the collection of montages from the 25th Ammendment now. I‚Äôm sick of the orange clown saying Biden is not mentally fit. 4 some reason I think it was u who put them 2gether. I want 2 post them so bad on FB where the asses are!
Dear Nate, We are not joined at the hip. Biden hasn't done anything to earn a vote. He believes he is entitled. Most Bernie Bros were Independents, and lean towards 'green' policies and aid the working class. Biden ain't that.
Biden and Kamala..tough on crime but also on board with police reforms..that's what the country needs right now..but we need to push for more reforms and more crime prevention than prison filling..
Obama/Biden: "Do this." Trump/Pence: "Do the opposite of this."
Yes, yes, yes.This, to me, is job one for the Biden-Harris administration.
Biden owns a gun
The August #CivitasPoll is out! Some important numbers that reveal a couple of very tight races.   Trump/Biden: 44%/45%  Tillis/Cunningham: 38%/41%  Cooper/Forest: 49%/39%  #ncpol
Clearly you‚Äôre not interested, I just don‚Äôt really care. ‚ÄúLol Dr. Jill Biden had no ‚Äòporn pics‚Äô‚Äù jokes are sex shaming and obnoxious. Comments about people being less-than because they don‚Äôt have a college degree are elitist.
This country is a mess. As a Conservative, I want a guaranteed, accurate election. In person or absentee with Verified ID. There is too much division and distrust on both sides for any mail in nonsense. And if we LEGITIMATELY elect Biden, then so be it. I‚Äôll do what I have to.

In Biden's defense, I suggest that Trump is insulting men everywhere by claiming to be one.

Its interesting watching Democrats who complained about Biden/Harris now defending them and voting for them and not realizing that they‚Äôre doing the exact same thing Republicans have done with Trump.   ‚ÄúIf they win, our team wins, so I‚Äôll overlook everything I don‚Äôt like to win.‚Äù
"...only the 2nd Black woman ever to serve in the US Senate, and the first South Asian-American woman. No Black woman has ever served as the governor of a state...no Black woman had ever been on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket."   The power she has!
I keep tryna say that only way Trump loses is if he fumbles hard, but instead Biden's the one continually fumbling. It's gotta be game over right?
LISTEN. Biden should‚Äôve picked Bernie as his running mate. But I see what they did. Having an African American woman on the ticket is MONUMENTAL, so I‚Äôm not taking anything from her. Trump is going to spend the next 80 days focusing on defining a woman.. &amp; what she should be.
WOW üò≥!! That‚Äôs joey biden , the one that gets lost all the time and mumbling all the time!!!!
Ads here in NC by the admin take Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄúNot gonna be happy about raised taxes‚Äù (referring to the rich and himself, actually) and making it seem like he meant the middle and lower classes.  Still yet to see an ad about their successful COVID management though. Weird.
What jobs? We're tired of all the lies. That's why the Biden&amp; Harris ticket is the honest WINNER!
Remember all the hiring signs we saw in the past 3 years;  displayed in stores, on back of vehicles, billboards and everywhere we looked? Now think back to the 8 years of Biden and Obama.
Top story: WATCH: New Trump ad hammers Biden/Harris over Joe's endless array of racial gaffes  see more
This is exactly the tactics Putin uses and this will happen in every Republican state Trump needs. FL, TX, GA, PA, OHIO, etc..  Biden and Harris should file complaints now.
We have been hearing no defense for Biden since the reports surfaced... Unilaterally, the Democratic party has chosen to completely ignore or disavow outright the claims. I understand innocent until proven guilty, but people should at least investigate and have an inquiry.
WOW ! THAT IS DISTURBING TO SAY THE LEAST.
Hillary lost because of Michigan, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Ohio, Florida, and Wisconsin‚Äôs going for Trump. Biden will win VA. Whomever wins won‚Äôt be decided by VA voters. Volunteer with the campaign if you want to make an impact.
Voter suppression, gerrymandering, pushback against mail-in voting, the elimination of polling sites, and Russian interference‚Äîall remove any possibility of a level playing field.  We have to overcome their criminality with numbers.    #BidenHarris2020
I‚Äôm good as long as trump isn‚Äôt president. We‚Äôve had racist presidents before and the country was ran way better than this. If Trump wins because we keep slandering Biden and Harris which will split the votes or cause us to not vote at all... ima have a mental break down üòì

Its only going to get worse when the unemployment checks stop next year and the real depression begins. And when Biden- Harris win or when the Left to contests a Trump victory.
You better take the social out of your name if you're going to vote for Biden and Harris. They're both tough-on-crime Republicans with a D next to their name.
Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election | Fox Business: Harris is a Sanders socialist , already rejected by the voters.
Don't forget Biden also wrote the 1983 Comprehensive Forfeiture Act that allows cops to steal people's property without charging them with a crime!
I cannot believe that I‚Äôm actually seeing posts from people about them not voting in September. You really want another 4 years of Trump?! Biden/Harris is not a perfect ticket but they are a HELL of a lot better than Trump. Check yourselves, people. #BidenHarris2020
A phrase you are beginning to hear pop up in private conversations about #presidential race is: '#JoeBiden has a lead..but his support is a mile wide and an inch deep". One operative characterized Biden support in #NorthCarolina as "1/4 mile wide 1/4 inch deep" Keep that in mind
PS...  Had he picked Klobuchar I suspect that would have been the knockout punch.  She would have delivered the midwest.  Harris?  Outside of California she's not well liked and never polled more than 1%.  California already voted for Biden so it doesn't matter.

good interview with Jack Lew this morning.  If Biden wins you think he brings him back to Treasury to tackle this mess? Or consider keeping Mnuchin and allowing him to negotiate without the limitations he clearly has now.
The entire world has a "dog in this fight."  Or...have you not been paying attention?  I do tend to agree with Gundlach, however.  She was poor choice for Biden.
That‚Äôs really gracious of Carlson to campaign so hard for Biden.
It means Biden is a stooge who they put up because they see him as ‚Äúelectable‚Äù. Then, they slip an in unelected socialist (Heels up) to fast track the socialist agenda that Trump halted. I feel like the voters will see through this obvious trickery and do the right thing though.

Hats off to Biden for making political ads that are actually pro-biden instead of just anti-trump. I still don't like the guy, but I can at least respect that, especially since dissing Trump is so easy.
Bring up Biden and Harris records was it relates to prison and arrest and then bring up Trump and Pences.

Biden being a conservative, pandering, racist who will escalate military tensions‚Äîlike LBJ‚Äîwas my original point. I think you missed it.
LBJ was a racist who did most things out of political expediency. He's also largely responsible for the escalation in Vietnam.  Biden would be the most conservative Democrat President in 50+ years.
Come on now Matt. It's almost September. Go ahead and tweet your half-hearted last-minute gotta-get-Trump-out-of-there endorsement of Biden now and don't keep us waiting.

I finally understand why experienced SA members went to such pains the last 4 years to clarify that we're not in a fascist moment yet and Trump is not actually a fascist leader: libs saying that fascism means we have to vote for Biden.
Has anyone floated this idea? Biden Wins, sworn in, resigns due to health.  Wala! The DNC is right where they always wanted to be. Don't sell them short.
This Biden and his granddaughter. You might wanna leave out family flavored metaphors with this guy.

Kamala Harris was born to highly educated middle class parents.  She was able to get scholarships to excellent universities.  She is not black.  She may be a wonderful role model, but as Joe Biden has said, ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù.
Not even close. Listen to what these people are actively fighting for and you will understand why they are angry the Biden and Harris are the nominees. Progressives have legitimate concerns about Biden and Harris. Offer them the respect of paying attention to their needs.
Or purchase of Biden family support by the Chicoms to the tune of $1.5 billion. Bought and paid for by the CCP
Victory for Biden is not any type of victory for a progressive platform. Not now, not ever.

Good point, but:  Worst case scenario w/ Biden is returning to pre-Trump status quo. Which is bad, I know. That is WORST case.  4 more yrs w/ GOP will give us a full dictatorship, supported by a federal secret police, the DOJ, and the Supreme Court.   No contest. None. IMHO.

Someone at Fox News who is not a Biden fan‚Äîmaybe it was Tammy Bruce‚Äîsaid recently that one advantage Biden has over other political liars is that his lies are entertaining. His made-up-stories are at least interesting to listen to. Maybe he should‚Äôve been a fiction author.

All of the ‚ÄúI‚Äôd vote for Biden but could never vote for an extreme candidate‚Äù all of a sudden finding a whole bunch of reasons to not for Biden. It‚Äôs almost like we shouldn‚Äôt let Republicans control who Democrats nominate.
what if at the first debate biden just walked out and smashed an orange with his fist before saying a single word, i feel like that‚Äôd really set the tone
I think that‚Äôs a cop out you know deep in your heart why ..nobody wants to talk to Biden or Obama either they are just blowing smoke up our ass if your not going to talk to everyone involved your wasting time

No, I support Biden. I disagree with Sara but she's still a friend.

Radical or moderate? Trump paints Joe Biden-Kamala Harris ticket as both
Lyin‚Äô hidin‚Äô Biden.
Like Trump was? Funny you're questioning Biden &amp; Harris's credentials.
I‚Äôm not thrilled about a Biden-Harris  presidency, but at least I actually trust Biden to appoint cabinet members who are highly educated in their fields and know wtf they‚Äôre talking about. It‚Äôs like would you rather be shot in the foot or the head? I‚Äôm going foot. You should too
I think Biden would be asking Who is Hunter?
Kamala tryna pull off a Insurgency on Biden. Infiltration step complete
Where is Hunter ? Did Biden forget about his other son
Biden Harris 2020. The Choice is Clear.
Joe Biden should do a press conference.
Seeing videos of Harris and Biden together doesn't even feel real
Hey Margaret Biden mispronounced kamala's name too. Was he disrespectful or only Tucker?
I don't know why I cried through almost all of this speech, but I did. LFG, you guys.
Historic! Joe Biden Picks ‚ÄòFearless‚Äô Kamala Harris as His VP Running¬†Mate
Is she calling for someone to assasinates Biden? Where is secret service, FFS!!
Yes vote for trump... after Biden after 50 years in Congress has 0, nothing, nada, zilch to show for helping African Americans ... WHILE Trump has done prison reform, opportunity zones ( do you even understand what they are and how the benefit the black community?), etc.
Joe Biden's VP choice of Kamala Harris signals return to American values and competence
Joe Biden is a compassionate human being.   Donald Trump is a sociopath.  Professed Christians should vote for Biden for this fact alone.  #BidenHarris2020
This person was presumably born the last time Joseph Biden was on a presidential ticket???
Why would you even post this with out including Biden's January Op-ed where he laid out exactly what  POTUS should have done?
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make first joint appearance as running mates
has taken North Carolina out of Biden's column and given it to Trump, so YOU SEE??? we must really  get serious in order to ensure a victory for America
I‚Äôve been saying all along  no big names will be arrested they will say some low level person acting on his own  hell Biden  and Obama where off limits I will be surprised if any thing else happens hell look at the  case deep state all around
Amazing what our Crooked Fake Racist President  came up with after hearing about Kamala Harris:  ‚ÄúTake my word for it, if Biden-Harris gets elected, more blacks will move to the suburbs.‚Äù
I think she'll stay in the Senate.  A cabinet pick would pigeonhole her which is why she wanted President.  I'm happy for her to stay and fuck around with Biden/Harris as they've got little to no power.
Yes it is the two white women's fault because Biden scheduled their fundraiser from 4 to 6, and then announced his VP pick around that time (receipt attached üòâ).
Same here. As the next President of the US, Joe Biden, and his badass VP, Kamala Harris, said today, Possibilities. Say it again, possibilities. A good day, for sure.
Joe Biden is just a vessel.
Biden buried him like a hungry top in the spring harvest.
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event

A public option will be way more difficult to pass and implement assuming Biden and Pelosi would even try. See you in 2024!
Yes famous authoritarians joe biden and kamala Harris!
how in the FUCK can y‚Äôall sit here and say ‚Äúfree black men and women locked up on marijuana related crimes‚Äù then THEN TURN AROUND AND FUCKING VOTE FOR BIDEN AND HARRIS?????
Kamala &amp; Biden won't cut it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Both are bitter, negative, ugly personality.
Funny, so the law and order guy is the guy in office when crime and murders surge? Get Biden in there to make America's streets safe again.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to be able to get excited about a Biden/Harris candidacy. However, I am very much looking forward to Harris saying more stuff like ‚Äújust like everythingp else he‚Äôs inherited, he ran it into the ground‚Äù.
Hey Twitter boy. Nothing inappropriate to say about the Biden-Harris press conference? Matter of time I‚Äôm sure. You are incapable of behaving like a leader.
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make first joint appearance as running mates
Can‚Äôt wait for my ballot to start the journey afresh with BIDEN/HARRIS ticket!
But if something does happen to Biden, we know who to investigate. Question 1: How did you know something was going to happen to him?
3. Jeff Grundlach is an Economist, Global Macro Strategist, and Bond Manager. Without additional context, I don't see a problem with him saying a VP pick would be too dominant next to Biden. People said the same thing about LBJ next to Kennedy.
And winning is what Biden does best. #BidenHarris2020
OMG - The GOP compared to Biden - Harris looks like corrupt old white men from the Deep South, grasping at power that they know is slipping from their hands.  Goodbye and good riddance. Goodbye to the  hatered / bigotory/ and vial maliciousness of the Trump GOP.
Biden literally was friends with a KKK member and went to his funeral
Don't bother.  We knew she was first pick.  So, let's make her proud and get these progressives elected.  She will drag Biden and Harris in the Senate - the more of her we have, the more we can drag their asses.
Hoping there will be a spot in the Biden administration for you!
OMG - The GOP compared to Biden - Harris looks like corrupt old white men from the Deep South, grasping at power that they know is slipping from their hands.  Goodbye and good riddance. Goodbye to the  hatered / bigotory/ and vial maliciousness of the Trump GOP.
It's not about Trump or Biden. It's about becoming a dictatorship or keeping a democracy where we live to fight another day. The GOP will turn us into an autocracy if they get another term. They might have already, if they succeed in stealing this election.

. And this statement of mine remained true as well. It was Clyburn‚Äôs endorsement that cinched it for Biden. Obama didn‚Äôt endorse until it was ‚Äúsafe‚Äù for him to do so‚Äîafter it was a foregone conclusion so Obama coudn‚Äôt be appear to be wrong.
What would the percentages for Biden look like in this situation. 80% of the vote in CA?
Biden and Kamala knocked it out of the park!!!
‚ÄúAnd like everything else he‚Äôs inherited, he‚Äôs run ot in the ground.‚Äù (the economy from Obama/Biden) the NEXT VP of the United States,

Beau Biden died at age 46 from glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer.  For over a decade I have been fighting for Burn Pit legislation to help veterans like myself and Beau.  I'm proud to stand with  as he fights for us.
I love your perfect purity.  Sorry for using shorthand (on twitter) to describe the overwhelming electoral turnout and validation among MANY, but not ALL, black voters that we all watched push Biden to the front.
God bless Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and god bless America. We at last have hope againüí´ #JoeBidenForPresident2020 #JoeBidenKamalaHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020
While I don‚Äôt believe there will be any debates in which Biden is on a stage alone with Trump with no teleprompter to read or handlers to whisper in his ear‚Äîif there are, will the liberal MSM carry it on a delay so Biden‚Äôs losses of thought can be hidden from the viewers?
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make first joint appearance as running mates: WATCH LIVE
Amazing how black voters LOVE Joe Biden...I am going to trust them on this one.
I am surprised the liberal networks are running the Biden/Harris annoucement live. If Biden forgets his place, everyone will see it.
Funny how #Kamala forgot Biden is a #racist who bussed her. ü§£üòÇ So freaking #fake  Oh kamala not even California love you. üòÇü§£üòÅ Did you realize #DementiaJoe didn't express any optimistic plan? Nope just bashing POTUS. #SystemicRacism my butt

Win one for the entire üåè everyone.   All people who are or want to be free need you to vote for President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.  And bring some friends. Get them registered.  üí™üëäüèæ
She is not my choice for President or Vice President, just my own opinion, so sadly she can become President if Biden can longer perform his Presidential duties, although I dont feel he will get elected anyway.  So im not too worried about it.
Why when you type  in your browser does the Joe Biden website come up????? WTF?
The weather evidently has thrown the Biden schedule off per
Is what you are doing to Biden and Obama daily.
Biden on women, 2020: Sniff as many as you can ü§Æ  Kamala on politics for decades: who ya gotta sleep with to get anywhere‚Äôs here...
Unfortunately it‚Äôs a lesser of two evils. Not voting  all just gives it to him, and I don‚Äôt think Joe Biden could possibly do much more worse
I need Biden and Harris to hurry up though. They‚Äôve been ‚Äúspeaking at any moment‚Äù for an hour and a half now
Liberals and Socialist love ‚ù§Ô∏è fining People that vote for them , like guy‚Äôs that own the fitness center in NEW YORK! Well they have already said they will definitely vote for PRESIDENT TRUMP!! And you‚Äôre not black unless you vote for master biden!! He will take the chains off üßê
Rob, don‚Äôt get suckered in by this far-right conspiracy drivel, the domain owner likely transferred traffic toward the Biden website, which to me is actually clever if a bit sneaky.  My guess is this link will be down before the end of the day....
The next 100 days will be way more bearable if everyone admits that we all know exactly what will happen: liberals will check out the second trump is gone and Biden will sit in the chair and do nothing like they want.
Stick with the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs better than trump‚Äù argument, stop insulting our intelligence re: the ‚Äúmost progressive platform ever‚Äù full of things Biden didn‚Äôt support until this year and in most cases actively opposed for decades.
Despite Kamala Harris‚Äôs history, she probably looks better to the electoral college unfortunately.we all want Trump out so suck it up and vote Biden for 2020
In Joe Biden's case he said if a woman says she was sexually assaulted you believe her except of course for the woman accusing him of sexual assault.  You just ignore her.  Believe all women unless they accuse a democrat is usually how it goes.
‚ÄúBut not Joe Biden, he‚Äôs not that smart‚Äùü§£
no you mean the super delegates decided biden.  don't worry i'm sure that trump won't bring up kamala's attacks on biden at all during the next three months.
This is what boils my piss, people saying "but Biden is x, Kamala is y, and I voted for z"  Don't care.  There's an actual monster in charge now and do you really want an 4 more years of absolute misery??? Is the moral high ground worth all the COVID dead and kids in cages???
you understand that she said she believed what they said right?  you realize that what they said is accusing joe biden of inappropriate touching right?
No i've never had the position of believe all women.  that's a dumb position to take because then you end up in situations like harris and biden are in now.  You should investigate but to say believe all of anyone off the jump is just stupid.
Joe Biden: You ain‚Äôt black!ü§¨  Kamala Harris: I know.üò™
This is the Biden War Room's best one yet.  üëç
Good deal- there‚Äôs one educated voter that won‚Äôt be voting Biden ü§£
Yes biden=FAILURES and AMERICA going to HELL !! SAD üò¢!! REAL AMERICANS can‚Äôt let this HAPPEN!!
Four more years of Trump will definitely get those libs on our side.  They just wanna go back sleep under Biden
If you're looking to justify voting for Trump, look elsewhere. You know good and well Biden is the only viable alternative.
Seems odd that you dont want Joe Biden to do this.
Yeaaaaaaaaah if biden and kamala get elected I‚Äôm snitching
How y‚Äôall feel about Biden picking Harris?
This is too accurate. My view is at least Biden is less likely to be a national embarrassment.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
So what? Both Trump and Biden are creeps I thought this was already established
That‚Äôs a pretty gross way to describe a supporter. Are you in the Colon of Biden or any of the other corrupt scum you support?
Absolutely! Between Biden and Kamala! What is the Number of Black Lives Destroyed, Jailed or Inprisoned! If you have a Number! Let's Roll!
Followed and retweeted! üåäüíÉüèª blue wave coming through!
All you ppl complaining about biden/harris. Do you realize what the other option is, i mean come on, I cant take 4 more years of that cheeto puff bitch. #BidenHarris2020
There is no one solution my guy, you do what you can step by step to make progress and Biden is a step away from Trump, it might not be an end all solution, but it‚Äôs a step in the right direction to have our voices heard. I wanted Bernie, but you gotta do what you gotta do
I'm sure you were trying to look like Biden...right?
omg thought it was Biden lol
I'm not giving to the Lincoln project, but literally, it isn't Trump or Biden on ballot, but our Constitutional Republic. Will we keep moving towards a more perfect union based on the values we have espoused or slide into the abyss of a white nationalist totalitarian oligarchy.
Just ordered 2 Biden/Harris yard signs. One for the front and one for the back since our yard is up against the greenway.
They will spend the next 5 mo trashing everything they can just to make it that much harder for Biden to make actual progress.
Followed! Thank you! üåäüíÉüèª
Wouldn't want people to see that Biden and Trump agree on everything.
again semantics aren't helping you here.  four women plus tara reade have accused biden of sexual assault.  unwanted touching is sexual assault.  the voters may not care at all but still doesn't change harris statement's
Biden has been criticized for telling a black jounalist that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not black‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not black enough‚Äù.  If Joe applied those accusations to Kamala Harris, he would be right.
#GOP Trying to find bad things to say about Biden and a Harris is hilarious!  Your DEFENDING TRUMP!  PRES CLUELESS! We Win!   165000 DEAD!  Solution ‚ÄòIT WILL MAGICALLY GO AWAY‚Äô
Meanwhile, radical liberals are crying like babies and saying they won‚Äôt vote for Biden/Harris.
I‚Äôm white and live in the suburbs.  I didn‚Äôt misinterpret anything from this statement.  Nor did I get hysterical. Nor did I think that his statement showed any intelligence.  Just more of the divisive rhetoric that defines this man.  I‚Äôll be voting Biden/Harris 2020.
One thing that is already odd (as if 2020 is not already "odd" enough) is that most presidential tickets tack to the center after primaries are over. #Biden keeps lurching farther and farther left with every decision including #Veep choice. Will center unaffiliated voters follow?
Meet President Biden
it's not a lie if it's true.  she did say she believed biden's accusers.  you just loop that over and over and there is nothing she can do especially after her grandstanding during the kavanaugh hearings.  again it will be glorious.
for biden/kamala who are both extremely pro policing pro cop and pro jail
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúNational Women for Biden Bimonthly Training‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
It is the political equivalent of #FourCorners before shot clock. The only problem is #JoeBiden is no #PhilFord...in order to win, you have to at least make your free throws when fouled and Biden keeps clanking even the easy softball interviews he has online
I heard her Family owned a lot of slaves, is that is the quality Joe Biden found most appealing in her. üò≥not to  mention she‚Äôs black in color as well.
I assume anybody that really wants Biden to win will do whatever is necessary to vote for Biden. If you want Trump to win you will vote for Trump.  I don‚Äôt think Trump will want people who want Trump to win to vote for Kanye. I don‚Äôt see how this can help trump
Every time I here little girls I think of Joe Biden, hopefully those aren‚Äôt the same little girls he molested right in front of their parents. WTFüò≥
It's not excitement - it's the rage aimed at all those who were willing to risk our democracy by voting for a two-bit traitor reality TV personality. Vote for Biden, but the 2016 misogyny will not be forgotten.
Absolutely! The Perfect! Candidate for Biden! Maybe he can keep track of Kamala by her SMELL!
He is trying to replicate early days of  Republic where guys like Washington and Jefferson didn"t campaign for office...crass politicking was below them. They 'stood' for election and stayed home at Mount Vernon or Monticello. #Biden is trying new spin: Hiding Out with Biden
Biden knows what he‚Äôs doing  #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris #Election2020
Might be the first, and only time, you will see anyone in the public polling arena brag about how wrong they were in 2016 and also brag about how their model gives #Trump "MUCH higher" chance than other polls do...although still saying he will probably lose to a weak #Biden
In a Biden/Harris World! #Trump2020
Biden could‚Äôve picked a Kit Kat to be his VP and I would still vote for him foh
So she's going to do all the work and Biden gets to lead and get credit?  No thanks.   stay in the Senate and give them hell.
Good for Democrats maybe, but bad 4 the people of North Carolina.  Joe Biden threw progressives to the curb with his pick, while shamelessly using African-American voters to advance neoliberalism.  Harris inspires nobody but party elites seeking power for their donors.  #ncpol
Moments After Biden Announced Harris, Trump Absolutely Flattened Her
Trump leads Biden by only 2 points in NC-11?
Number 35.
Congratulations to Senator Kamala Harris on being selected as the Vice Presidential running mate with VP Joe Biden. A Voteless People Is A Hopeless People.
And still Biden is 10 points ahead. AMAZING
Prob a long-shot for a D pick-up (former Meadow's seat), but redrawing of it will shorten the odds. That Trump is treading water vs. Biden is a good sign for the D. He prob lags behind Biden due to name recognition not preference. The R will likely make blunders, too.
Why isn't Biden (Or, really, his campaign folks) Segmenting emails?
Which will only happen with a D administration?  Work to get them elected and to move Congress to the left.  Biden/Harris will back it if the Congress passes it.
He actually admitted to most of the stuff you called obscure. You just pick and choose when to politicize your religion. Today you care about whatever is anti Biden.
No way Biden should debate Trump. Every word out of Trump's mouth is a lie.
Despite what happened to Ms. Clinton, I think the odds are in Biden-Harris‚Äô favor.
What did I miss? #LincolnVoter  Lindsey Graham praises Joe Biden and calls Donald Trump a 'race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot' in new ad
We are ready to go to work to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  This is a winning ticket.  And we are ready to #FlipTheSenate      Goodbye Thom, Susan, and of course, #MoscowMitch
if y‚Äôall keep gatekeeping biden by expecting everybody to kiss the ground he walks on and not have any critique ur gonna lose the progressive votes which u desperately need!üò∏
all my feed is rn is ‚ÄúStOp CoMpLaiNiNg AbOuT bIdEn/KaMaLa‚Äù like damn i thought we all believed in freedom of speech/having an opinion on issues, do y‚Äôall want my vote or not
Biden‚Äôs leadership has already been compromised.  This wasn‚Äôt his choice, nor was it his second choice.
I keep seeing people talk about how shitty the Kamala pick is for Biden but I have to ask, would any of Biden's VP picks NOT been shitty?
Biden seizes on Trump's attack on Social Security and Medicare, while team Trump panics
Biden must be pulling horribly behind Trump which is why The left is on this full court press about voter fraud all of the sudden.
If most people had suspected Biden was going to pick Harris for weeks, why is it taking the Rs so much time to come up with a strategy to attack her? Ahhhh, that‚Äôs right, we stole  , their best marketing team. üòÇ
‚ÄúGood job siphoning those votes away from Biden!‚Äù - Jared
You keep acting like Tara Reade is the only woman to accuse Joe Biden of inappropriate behavior.  I just gave you a link with four other women.  That is why she said accusers.  Not accuser.
What happened to WSJ who uncovered Watergate? Exposed TRUTHFUL news? You r a mouthpiece for radical left. Expose that Biden can't string a sentence or remember where he is; that the flip-flop radical woman he's chosen for VP will be Pres within a year.
Biden's climate plan "drew from policies that Harris herself has pushed, specifically including accountability for fossil fuel companies in Department of Justice investigations."   via
MR. PRESIDENT, please don't talk or worry yourself about Biden's pick for VP, WE. Already know she can get CALIFORNIA , Dem. Already had that state anyways, THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING .JUST BE THE BETTER PERSON AND KEEP DOING YOUR JOB, THE REST WILL FOLLOW üí™
Dear Biden campaign - I would like to see individual debates between Kamala Harris and Bill Barr, Mike Pence, The Impeached One, Ben Shapiro, and the owner of Hobby Lobby. Thank for considering this request.
Anyone know if Biden gonna choose 8 treasury secretaries, make them battle it out for months, knowing the whole time he will cave to peer pressure, bullying and threats?  Or does he only do that with women?
Already tired of reading ‚Äúwell Biden/Harris wasn‚Äôt my IDEAL choice BUT‚Äù   Just vote in November plz
I got opinions too but bitch I‚Äôm voting for Biden. Get that gahdamn Cheeto outta there!
Agreed.  She just needs to stay in the Senate so she can hold Biden Harris accountable.  The Dems don't need her apparently, they've got their ticket let them live with the consequences.
Yep.  I called it five weeks ago.  Biden is a coward who caves to peer pressure.  Should be a fun four years of *checks notes* zero things changing.
Either way I'm voting for Biden. I just want trump out of there.
love that people are celebrating a cop being biden's VP pic, very cool
And I‚Äôm not voting for no joe biden foh
Keen observers point out unusual elements of Biden‚Äôs Instagram post with Harris ‚Äî Puppet Joe Biden
I feel like there needs to be more room to be critical of the Biden/Kamala ticekt and also excited about the potential of having a black woman VP. Ostracizing anybody who feels differently than you about the Kamala pick is just generally unhelpful.
That makes sense, but the counterpoint is that on the few occasions Biden says something it seems like he fucks up and has to do damage control pretty regularly!
If Biden really wanted to win in November he would have gone with Elizabeth Warren as his VP - but he coddled up to the mob and went Kamala to check off the box - he must be scared Trump was making big inroads with black voters (which he is! #blexit)
Facts. Trump was accused of using Kanye to steal Black votes from Biden in an interview. Stay woke y‚Äôall. Don‚Äôt be fooled.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
Yes he is. Whatever we are talking about here in terms of the VPs influence electorally is on the extreme margins. It‚Äôs Biden v Trump is the bottom line
Here's more proof.  This lady seems to think it was something:   She literally said she believed all of biden's accusers.  So are all of them liars or just admit she's power hungry who will do anything.  She's a hypocrite.
I just wish Biden didn't look so fragile and senile sometimes.
You should build one in Joe Biden‚Äòs basement. He won‚Äôt know the difference and for the next four years he‚Äôll think he‚Äôs president after he loses
So by NOT voting for Biden, means you approve of Trump?  Ok, well that sums up all I need to know.  It's either one or the other there is no middle ground on this one.
I'd like Biden to debate BUT think he should add a condition. Don't debate unless Trump releases his tax returns and medical records.
There is no lack of quality candidates for AG for Biden to pick from - include Preet Bharara on that list too.
With Harris you're either talking about things that aren't controversial to most people (she's a cop who now believes in police reform?) or you go down the Biden-esque rabbit hole. "Well, her dad was this guy who said this thing, and her family did this, and and and."
The Harris outrage machine is so similar to the Biden outrage machine it's unreal. Both are weak b/c neither has anything to go off of. With the other VP choices, there was an easily packaged and digestible scandal (Warren, Bass, and Rice especially).
The country is calling for police and justice reform. The VP pick for Joe Biden is the complete opposite.
Great she also said she believed all of Biden's accusers.  You know more than one.  Here let me help you.
Lolol, someone doesn't want Biden speaking off script
Biden took 0.5 hits. Harris delivered the .5.
I 100% understand that if Biden flops, "leftists didn't support him hard enough" will be the excuse.  The damage is going to be equally insurmountable if we have Trump II in 2-4 years.
The VP pick is an example of how Joe Biden has been so quiet during the current campaign. My newest  is on why this is good and should continue:
It is! It can also be ominous that again - hard not to think of 2016, ever!!! - we're doing a ticket where we have some reason to believe that we've talked ourselves into it and maybe voters don't actually like them that much.  The odds are heavily in Biden's favor, granted.
As an independent I try to get diff. viewpoints. And usually I found u credible. But your article on Harris is nonsensical. No matter who Biden picked R‚Äôs would label her radical..Trump had no qualifications to be Pres. &amp; has proven to be a lying incompetent buffoon
All the folks highlighting GOP talking points about Kamala and then saying, "but I'm still going to begrudgingly vote for Biden" or "I'm just going to vote 3rd party" can enjoy smugly sniffing their own farts when Trump wins due to a divided Dem party.
So. Many. Emails. From. The. Biden. Campaign.
I mean check out the opening paragraph from today's Washington Post story...
I can‚Äôt support anyone‚Äôs decision not to vote for Joe Biden right now is not the time for some nihilistic purity test
Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris as his running mate, was celebrated by many Democrats. Here's what President Donald Trump had to say about it,
#Magic8BallTweet   All you guys can say is either Biden is forgetful or Harris is liberal. How about articulating a meaningful argument of why trump should remain president versus a change?  I know it's not a winning argument, but try.
While some of y'all are bashing Biden and/or Harris, I just have one question:  What outcome are you trying to bring about? Like, what goal is putting the Dem ticket on blast going to achieve for you?  Because the effect it WILL have is to persuade some people not to vote at all.
We will take things not said by NPR in 2011 when Obama/Biden dropped the payroll tax.
Joe Biden can‚Äôt get through a sentence but go ahead and vote for him
Corrupt corporate warmongers like Clinton, Obama &amp; Biden are not lesser evil They‚Äôre better at institutional evil like the Crime Bill &amp; permanent war
Good for Biden see what happens
LOL she's a self-declared "Top Cop" of California. How will THAT play out? She also said she believed Joe's accuser! OK so the Top Cop believes Biden is guilty of sexual harassment!! but now you pander to the left, hilarious
This is the weakest field of 3rd party candidates in many  cycles. They really hurt Clinton in those key states in 16. Trump will not be as fortunate this go-around.
NYTimes White House "journalist" spews spin and opinions for Biden/Dems and against Trump/Republicans.  In next breath whines she is NOT biased and is straight news person.  Can not figure out why nobody believes her...
NYTimes hack "reporter" admitting she is a stenographer for the Biden campaign!
You did not sound honored when you were with Biden at the debates. You will be soundly defeated.
Like watching forecasters trying to plug in -50000% GDP and 2000% unemployment and voila Biden wins 538-0.  Nothing matters.  Whatever, I'll take their money and it will require less working capital to do so.
This is a pretty accurate description. But that's why she was picked. She's a response to Trump's argument that with Biden in office every city will be Chicago or Portland. She's also got the identity politics bona fides and, unlike a Stacey Abrams etc, is a leader not a victim.
can‚Äôt wait to vote Biden/Harris to own the libs
You should say that you do remember, and will still work for Biden/Harris. Otherwise you're just as bad as any Trump supporter who denies any bad shit he did and shouts TRUMO 2020!  Or do you already have your blue MAGA hat?
A vote for a radically pro abortion ticket is not worth teaching the Republicans a lesson. I vote out of principle, not pragmatism. Just as I think Trump is horrible for the country and unfit, so do I maintain that bc of the abortion issue primarily Biden/Harris is also unfit.
Vote for the most pro-abortion ticket in history? No thanks. I won't sell out my principles and values just because I can't stand Trump. And I'm so tired of this faulty logic. Staying home is as much a vote for Biden as it is Trump. I still care about my local elections also.
Obama said Biden really nailed the pick
No candidate, especially in this 2 party system should be able to move an inch w/out critique. My biggest fear is the history of Biden &amp; Harris will show up in the presidency. I can support and vote their ticket while also side eyeing their political resumes.
Kinda the same way the republicans feel for Biden when he debates Trump.
Biden‚Äôs campaign is a pro run machine that has ignored every cable pundit and twitter know it all and steamrolled. Harris should come in, follow the blocking the campaign sets out and prep her ass off for oct 7. Bring energy and gut Pence in the debate. That‚Äôs it.
So Nate  releases his election prediction confirming Biden's advantage in both the popular vote and electoral map.  The reaction? The prediction market moves the other way. Huh.
If CNN can read Biden's mind, why didn't they tell us all this before the pick was made?
yeah.. I mean trump's policies haven't been bad. just hard to vote for someone with lack of character. But no way am I voting for Biden/Harris.. I guess I will be writing in or Kanye. haha.
I was thinking the same: Biden has a trusted, dedicated staff. No leaking implies they are a team working toward the same goal. A novel concept after 3.5 years of chaos.
Just vote for Biden and shut up. LITERALLY anyone is better than trump
She's definitely blowing some energy into the Biden campaign
BIDEN IS A STRATEGIST BIDEN HAS A PLAN #BidenHarris2020 TRUMP IS A CRIMINAL TRUMPS ONLY PLAN IS AVOIDING PRISON.
I'm not RTing this to make people think you shouldn't vote for Biden/Harris and that you should vote for Trump/Pence. But its good to know what the people you are voting for did so youre not surprised if/when they do that shit again.

Ok for anyone judging Kamala Harris and saying she isn‚Äôt qualified or they don‚Äôt trust her... May I please remind you that MIKE PENCE is our current VP. If you don‚Äôt cast your vote for Biden/Harris, you are casting one for Dipshit/Dipshit
Biden went from everyone‚Äôs 6th choice to the consensus nominee in 48hrs, and Harris went from primary candidate who couldn‚Äôt crack 2% in polls to the presumptive heir apparent in 6mo.  Harris was also the only dem primary candidate with net unfavorable.  You people are weird.
Wait, Joe Biden Picked That Kamala Harris?
‚ÄúTrump is also much better at negotiating than Biden.‚Äù
Soooooooooooo they admit Biden is just a placeholder and Kamala is the real candidate. This is all sorts of wrong.
No it ain‚Äôt.  1.) Y‚Äôall not black so y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have anything to say about a black card. 2.) Her record is trash but look who she‚Äôs up against. Pence believes in shocking gay people until they turn straight. Biden could run with Jeffrey Dahmer and he still getting all the votes
They really aren‚Äôt they? I mean Biden could have chosen Adam Smith as his running mate
This is the last thing law enforcement in the US needs!  Vote for our safety in November!  The Biden administration would be a disaster in many ways!
"During her presidential run, Harris also frequently advocated for the federal government to take legal action against fossil fuel companies for their legacy of climate pollution."

I am a Joe Biden supporter and I want to see Trump out of the White House but I wonder if having Kamala Harris on the ticket is a liability. Regardless I shall cast a vote for him anyway.
Can we please get more progressive victories like this over the next 4 years, it'll make the Biden/Harris situation more palatable
I will crawl over broken glass to vote üó≥ for Biden/ Harris in November.
Biden could‚Äôve chosen peppa pig and guess what? I‚Äôm still voting. Get 45 out of there, period.
Good point also we should consider the fact that pelosi is in play here. Biden gets declared unfit Kamala cannot become president and bam Nancy got her dream that she has been warning us about.

Kamala Harris met the most important qualification for Biden‚Äôs running mate
Nice try Donnie but Biden never took out a full page ad in the NY Times calling for the execution on 5 innocent black teenage boys.  Trump's COVID response has resulted in the death of 50,000+ black Americans. More dead bkacks than the Jim Crow era.  #RESIGN while you can.
Biden Has More Than enough ammunition to fire back at Trumps track record...
No,  Biden brought history where it should‚Äôve been. He gave Kamala Harris a chance. But it was her struggle to ignore social bias, she battled American oppression. From the time she went to school to be AG of Ca., she chose what‚Äôs her right to become, Vice President of America
I believe they‚Äôre just talking about the DNC‚Äôs anticipation that Biden will only serve 1 term. That makes his VP choice the nominee in 2024
It would help if progressives actually voted. If they did, we would have seen a Bernie ticket. But hey, progs can rant on all they like about Biden/Harris but without getting out there and voting - their voice is going to be a whisper.
John Legend and Cher applaud Joe Biden's vice president pick -  ‚Ä¶
I wasn‚Äôt competing with  could? My prediction was different‚Äîit was about the composition of the Democrat ticket. And I got it exactly right, at a time when most people thought Biden and Harris would never be on the ticket together after their debate exchange.
It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating to watch well meaning folks on Twitter, including many of which who will tell you they‚Äôre voting a Biden/Harris ticket in November, do the opposition research for Republicans. The people you‚Äôre being retweeted by are Ben Shapiro.
I think Biden's medicare as a public option will also eventually lead to medicare for all..people will eventually realize medicare is better and cheaper and switch to it..or private insurance companies will have to keep up with government negotiated prices..keep up the pressure..
I see Green2020. Who do you think is more Environment Friendly, Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris?
But yeah ugh this election. Still voting for Biden + Kamala but not happy about it
Yeah, she was definitely a choice and I can‚Äôt say she wasn‚Äôt an obvious choice. But her record with policing and her role in SESTA/FOSTA prevents me from feeling good about her. But I also don‚Äôt like Biden and would I have really felt good about any pick? Honestly, prob not
At the end of the day, if she wanted the job, I want her to have it. And hopefully it will be helpful for whatever she strives for in the future. Hopefully Biden is still around to advocate for whatever that may be...
Your thoughts are always appreciated. I think she‚Äôll bring energy. My brothers were thrilled, 1 is in Utah, the other NM. We have very different politics. I think Biden trusts her judgment, &amp; since we have no idea what‚Äôs up w/him, she may have a large behind the scenes role?
What‚Äôs the bet Biden mistakes a different black woman for Kamala
I‚Äôd love debate w/ Dems right now...but anyone ignoring &amp; defending Joe Biden‚Äôs mental deterioration is dangerous in my book. Politics aside, the fact no one on the left (inner circle or voters) seems to even care that something is severely wrong is scary as hell for our country.
Thanks, I was feeling let down by Biden. If this is true I‚Äôm ecstatic! Dems want to raise the taxes of the RICH, not middle class and poor.

Did we forget thar Biden has been coined a long time supporter of law enforcement, who advocated for increased police funding for "reform" in response to the Ferguson protests?
Did we all forget? Did we forget that there were tanks in Ferguson, MO while Biden was VP? Did we forget that rubber bullets were being shot at protestors while Biden was VP? Did we forget that the department of justice ruled Michael Brown not a victim, while Biden was VP?

I think Romney would be well suited to be Secretary of State in a Biden administration.
Oh, Biden is still embarrassing. Absolutely. But on a much more amateur level than Trump.
I think even a lot of the GOP legislators silently would prefer him to 4 more years of Trump. Biden is someone they can work with, and knows everybody has to walk away from the table with something they need for their constituents.
Won‚Äôt be long before all the woke ppl will be reposting anti Biden/Kamala propaganda from fake Russian social media accounts.  will be a former Grand Wizard of the KKK and  will be Uncle Toms granddaughter by November just like they did to

Every single Joe Biden commercial on my fucking TV is about the pandemic. These Democrat governors are 100% sandbagging opening and making it seem worse than it is. This is their platform.
Why is Biden on there!?!?
My thoughts exactly!
Get over it and vote for Biden!
Nothing you or Biden have proposed would improve the situation. Trump has advocated reopening the schools and the economy precisely to help those who are out of work and allow kids to get an education. Lockdown and wear masks until we have a vaccine is not a strategy.
She's staying in the Senate and watching you Biden and Harris üßê.
Pretty sure NBA folks in the bubble had done much worse in regards to Trump

It drives him nuts that nothing sticks against Biden. Joe Biden has been in public life for an eternity. People just don't buy the attacks on him. People don't associate those things with Biden.
This is a pretty revealing tweet. He just can't accept that Biden can't be pinned down so easily like Clinton.
I'm planning to vote for Biden but I don't think the last 20 years would have been much different if Gore had won. Doubt this argument will convince anyone who actually thinks Biden and Trump are equivalent.

Biden campaign had better be working a strategy as well!
The top two candidates in the primary elections should be on the Presidential and Vice Presidential ticket- since those two candidates represent the majority of the voters. Therefore it should‚Äôve been Biden and Sanders.

Joe Biden Introduces National Mask Mandate, Storms Out of Event Without ...  via  ‚Äúwhen am I going to get vaccinated?‚Äù Never you piece of play dough.
If I follow a MAGA head let me know! Some people are gaining followers through the resistance and then switching up their profiles! They can‚Äôt get them any other way apparently.
Biden‚Äôs greatest battle will be republicans who still won‚Äôt want to follow science led by ‚Äúsir tweets a lot‚Äù who will have time on his hands after he gets FIRED by the American People!
Trump making a play for New York would be akin to Biden making a play for deep red Nebraska.
That‚Äôs not his name. And journalists ask hard questions. Trump has told over 20000 lies since taking office. If you don‚Äôt believe that, you‚Äôre in a cult. ü§ûüèªyou can find a good shrink in Russia.   Also Biden has a stutter, not dementia. That‚Äôs Donnie you‚Äôre thinking of. Again.
Not  Check my profile. He is not a nice resister! Thank you for the shout out!
False.  This fiasco of a virus response is 100% on sitting President  .  Trump ignored the science, claimed it wasn't a problem, invoked his signature #magicalthinking that it would all just go away.  Not Biden. Trump.  To this day putting politics ahead of lives.
just gonna put this pic of joe biden out there again
I‚Äôll be happy to wear a mask for the next 3 months, President Biden.
We won‚Äôt have to imagine. The precedent is set now. If Biden wins this kind of stuff WILL happen. The tribalism is going to get worse before it gets better.
I am leaning toward voting Biden, but every time they start the scolding or the "ha ha Bernie lost" smugness, I start thinking again.
I am patiently awaiting the sale of the Biden and Harris art prints. Hope they will be available soon.
It‚Äôs currently collapsed  under your administration.  Don't worry, Biden/Harris will make America great again.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris ticket. I‚Äôm walking to my polling station &amp; I‚Äôll be happy to stand in line in inclement weather for hours to cast my ballot in person.trump just try to deny the validity of my vote. Like everything Dems not trump will fix this issue.
I would have voted for anyone else in the Democratic primary, just as I voted against Trump in the 2016 Republican primary. But I have no doubt that Biden will be a better president than Trump.
Honesty Poll:  Biden 98% trump DQ
Trump has said the 1918 flu happened in 1917 dozens of time. He suggested using bleach injections to fight a virus. He is a pathological liar and serial adulterer. He is 74 years old. And 170k Americans have died on his watch. I'll take my chances with Biden.
#GeneralStrike2020 Because Trump‚Äôs a Fascist, Biden/Kamala ain‚Äôt going to cut it, and our nation/world has too many problems that are being completely ignored by the people in positions to actually do something about it!
This is a three month old article but I haven't read or heard anything new since.  New Reporting Increases Doubts on Tara Reade‚Äôs Allegation Against Joe Biden  via
Exactly NO Dems are asking, or expecting, u to be excited. We ARE asking u to vote for Biden Harris, bec not voting for them is a vote for tRump. Still not excited?? I DON'T CARE. Why don't you get excited about combating voter suppression? This whole thread is a waste otherwise.
Yes, why yes, it did. Don‚Äôt forget the percieved sense of familiarity that they have with Biden.
Biden is clueless.
Joe Biden is a professional career politicians.  We know he‚Äôs never has an original idea because his history of plagiarism is well documented.  But he‚Äôs also a pretty prolific liar as well.  There a reason his voting records are locked up in a dark closet
Ok, our very serious mushroom cloud relative scariness index (VSMCS Index for short üòÄ) is 1. Harris 2. Pence 3. Biden 4. Trump üòÇüòÇüòÇ  Personally I found Ms. Clinton so scary, she should be an honorary 5th. I am sure she is nuking it out with Russia in an alt reality right now
Provide one single shred of evidence that Biden wants to "take all your guns!" üôÑ The fact that y'all keep pushing this BS propaganda goes to show it's YOU who think your followers are morons, because you know good &amp; well it's just a manipulative LIE! Real leaders don't gaslight.
"For those whom God to ruin has design'd, He fits for fate, and first destroys their mind."  You are officially out of your minds!
You.  I am on the fence, but scolding by liberals makes me want to not vote for Biden  aka vote for Trump as you would put it.
#Biden can‚Äôt form an impromptu sentence...and they are afraid of what #KamalaHarris might say.  Too risky.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ I don't know about PR team, but Dem Leadership have sure turned into a bunch little warriors.  So in your estimation of scariness? 1. Harris 2. Pense 3. ¬øBiden or Trump? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
No one actually cares who you vote for !! We don‚Äôt need your vote !!! If you vote for Biden you are a socialist !! You are admitting that you are OK with the government making decisions for you
Very disappointed in Joe Biden‚Äôs choice of running mate
They don‚Äôt want to vote ‚ÄúFOR‚Äù Joe Biden but they want to vote ‚ÄúAGAINST‚Äù Donald Trump
It‚Äôs amazing that Biden\Trump\Pence\Harris are the best this country has to offer.  What a fucking joke.

‚ÄúIt appears that (President Trump has) lost some party loyalty, and he‚Äôs lost some of the voters that define themselves as very conservative. And, so he‚Äôs going to have to make up some of the ground.‚Äù #CivitasPoll #ncpol
I would argue your hostility to the left is counterproductive to your presumed goal of getting some of them to vote for Biden.
I‚Äôm seriously wondering if that‚Äôs not why Biden is saying that. It‚Äôs been proven over and over that they have little to no affect on prevention of the virus.
Trump is suing TV stations who run (truthful) campaign ads against him Trump's lawyers are working overtime to get a 3rd party candidate on the ballot to pull votes away from Biden in swing states
You are not just voting for Biden in November. If he was to claim presidency, there are serveral other appointed positions to be filled that can serve as change to our country.  These positions include the Attorney General, Supreme Court Seats, Secretary of Education etc.
Remember the long, long parade of Biden-alternatives from Democratic leadership? How the hell do you think Deval Patrick would be doing right now???
Vote for Biden. It's the only way to end this. No Marshal of the Supreme Court, no impeachment, no 25th amendment, and no handshake with a Brazilian minister who has COVID. There's just one thing we can do. I hope enough of us do it.
And you are holding millions of Americans hostage with this phony shut down of the economy. Your zeal to destroy Trump is dragging down the livelihoods of millions of Americans over what is no more than a bad flu season. I wager the masks come off November 4th if Biden wins.
Trump Lies, lies , lies.  Dems only want to help Dem run cities. Lie Dem cities are poorly run. Lie Dems want to close schools so they can‚Äôt be used 4 polling. Stupid Lie Mail in voting is fraudulent. Lie Biden asked him to mandate masks. LIE!  Aaaaaaah!

Clearly an over sample of blue states and if unskewed turns out 97% of Americans prefer to starve and lose their homes than let Biden and Harris give them health care and an Obama phone
So the  poll (CPD used in 2016) released today asks about Biden and Trump and does NOT mention any other candidate. So when  hides behind their arbitrary requirement of 15% to participate in a debate, just remember, THEY AREN‚ÄôT EVEN ASKING ABOUT OTHER CANDIDATES!
Biden, Harris Want To Force Schools To Let Biological Males into Girls' Sports
Trying to figure out who‚Äôs more mentally deranged ... you ... or  U.S PRESIDENT TRUMP: ‚ÄúAT EVERY TURN, BIDEN HAS BEEN WRONG ABOUT THE VIRUS - IGNORING THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE‚Äù
Thinking of starting a PAC - NC Republicans for Biden. Need to get rid of this monster and his enablers (which includes you Senator Tillis).
Do that at the debate Mr President.  So the works can see.  Go on.  Avoid.  And then watch Vice President Biden answer every question in complete sentences and in complete honesty.  He was so flustered because he doesn‚Äôt know truth.
Joe Biden is also a bad representative of my values, but that‚Äôs another discussion. What about when trump restricts in person voting and congressional democrats do nothing but tweet and send letters on their way to yet another recess?
Free infomercials?     Our local TV stations showed 4 interviews after Harris‚Äôs selection as the Democrat‚Äôs VP candidate.  They were nothing but non stop praise about her and Biden.
So Biden wants all Americans to wear masks for at least 3 months.....what is in 3 months? The election. #tinfoilhatthoughts
I saw a Trump commercial with a woman saying we can't rebuild if Biden is elected because he's too weak.  Biden should create, like a rap battle commercial response asking, "Now how did we get into this mess in the first place? Why exactly do we need to rebuild? Just asking?"
It‚Äôs very clear Biden said wear the masks for the next three months so that as soon as the election gets here they can say take the mask off and say it was their leadership that cured the country if they win. Just another ploy because one way or another Covid ends on November 3rd
Exactly. Their corruption is In Your Face, So What Are You Going To Do About It? It shakes your faith in people to know that so many voters will still vote for them in November. Biden's election is not a given.
Turn-out for Democrats exceeded 2016 and is on course to reach 2008 numbers.  Biden and Trump both got 18 million votes this year, but Democrats had 36 million total votes cast with a contested primary.  Biden wound up winning 51% of the vote.
Nobody's expecting Biden (or Trump) to fix all the world's problems. But it sure would be nice to have a President that wasn't actively making more!
Well for one nick cannon is a definite racist lol  but i mean obama picked joe biden as VP cause he was white so im pretty sure thats the only reason biden is picking kamala..and shes a women so even mor evotes
Very easily. Biden/Trump will focus on the NY/Calif voters, while not caring about the middle of the country. Why go to Nashville to get 500k votes when I can go to LA to get 5 million? Not getting into a political discussion but don't rewrite the constitution to benefit yourself
‚ÄúAnd right after Reagan‚Äôs ‚Äòwall‚Äô speech, Biden again took the line that Reagan shouldn‚Äôt dare to provoke the Soviet bear.‚Äù  Sheesh...has Biden been right about ANY foreign policy decision?
No one even said they weren't voting for Biden in the thread so......????
We asked the public about a number of key federal and state races, but also surveyed their opinion on several political statements/slogans, such as: - Law and Order - Black Lives Matter - Defund the Police You can take a look at these results here.
If there is a fair election and the votes are all counted cleanly (big if), then Biden will win.  If Biden wins and Trump refuses to leave, then the US military is constitutionally bound, more than able, and will likely be very willing, to escort him out of the White House.
Biden &amp; Harris  Campaign 2020!
#ncpol On the same day   completes a poll showing Biden with a one percentage point lead.....
It‚Äôs hilarious that these people think Biden has any clue how to fast track an economic recovery. The first thing he will do is give away Nancy‚Äôs 3 Trillion dollars, then raise taxes by 4 Trillion while a ton of ppl are out of work. He‚Äôll spend the SS money in his first month.
Biden can suck my balls
Historic, especially because so much ground had to be made because Obama &amp; Biden totally sold Israel up the river. Stabbed them in back
Honestly &amp; selecting Kamala for VP, completely solidified their stance with progressive politics/voters, Hispanic/Latino peeps, &amp; young voters. It‚Äôs honestly a shame. I can‚Äôt say I hope Biden loses but I do hope they find out how dumb it is to alienate such a large voting bloc.
Wow, just wow. Such a lie. Reagan had the longest peacetime recovery EVER. Obama and Biden destroyed the economy.  History revisionism will not work this time lady.  #reclaimingmytime
Republican voters, PLEASE force your representatives to have actual ideas and policies! Attacking the left is *not* a policy. "Biden wants to raise your taxes " Bleh - too easy. Why does he want to raise taxes? How much? Where will the $$ go? Make Haley prove it. Dig deeper.
I literally have been wondering who, if anyone, had been doing any leg work within the Biden camp to gain the Hispanic/Latino vote since Bernie dropped out and I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs no one.
I just hope if Biden becomes president ( and God I sure hope so) Kamala remembers she is vice president not the president.üòâ

She's a hypocrite for calling Biden a racist and saying she believed the accusations against him SMH. She prosecuted over 1500 marijuana cases, but laughed when she was asked is she smoked. It's pathetic! Biden and her will be the incarcerating dream team.
Obama/Biden.  Hands down THE MOST CORRUPT administration in the history of our nation.  I don‚Äôt care what your politics are, open your eyes to what the Democrats have become past 20 years.  I used to be one of them.  Time for others to wake the hell up...they do nothing but lie.
Uhhhh..#Biden and #Obama already had 8 years to try to get this done but did not. #Fail
Did Biden say it would not help democracy to prosecute tRump? Oh yes hell it will sir. Along with each and every one of his criminal co-conspirators.
It should not be that close!!! Biden and Harris should be ahead by a landslide!!
ü§£ü§£ü§£ they all puppets.. ima vote for Biden though
None of them. It‚Äôs all about JoJo!! #JoJorgensen2020 !!!! Voting for Biden or Trump is a vote for old racist sex offending pedophiles!!
People can ACTUALLY SUPPORT AND VOTE FOR KAMALA because she's QUALIFIED.. not just cause she's BLACK! BIDEN-HARRIS 2020
I'm watching VP Biden speak abt the virus. What a breath of fresh air! He makes sense, I CAN trust what he says &amp; he's not degrading his apponents by calling them names &amp; acting like a bully. He's acting like an adult &amp; leader. It's like someone we've known has finally come home.
I bet Biden's happy it's only 56%!
If you don't vote for Biden, and could otherwise vote and are not disabled/afflicted in some similar way, it helps Trump win. You are, therefore, a Trump supporter. Vote for Biden and bug the hell out of him if he wins.
I think you mean ‚ÄúKamala Harris news conference‚Äù....because Joe Biden is just an empty vessel....
Obama had bipartisan cabinet. If Mitt Romney would just get some courage and come out for Biden I would have no objection to his being SecOfState--and it would also be a slap in face to Trump üòä
i dont think you cab be making fun of biden when your own idiot cant do the same
‚ÄùIf he wins, you‚Äôre going to end up with a disaster,‚Äù he claimed of Democratic rival Joe Biden."  No sense of the self-own.  Aren't we're in a disaster *right now* thanks in no small part  to your ineptitude?  Can we just skip ahead to Nov 3?
I'm pretty sure helping Black people wasn't in the job description packet Biden handed her.
Going to make calls for Biden to spite her now.
I'm going to go make calls for Biden to spite you, Naomi.
Anyone that believes Joe Biden writes his own tweets hasnt been paying attention.
Most of the U.S. government‚Äôs 200 immigration detention centers are run by private contractors holding asylum seekers and other immigrants accused of administrative violations or awaiting deportation.
You're forgetting how racist this version of the GOP has become. They could not conceive that Biden would actually choose someone who wasn't lily white to run with him, particularly someone as strong as Harris.
We all know thatTucker/Hannity have a huge draw nightly, and I've never contested that.  I'm saying lets look at the data on a day that Biden doesn't pick his VP in the 18-49 segment. We already know the NBA heavily outdraws all news in 18-49 demo by a landslide on a normal day.
I‚Äôm sure mlk would love Biden who is a bigot then and I‚Äôm sure he died so he could be voted for
That's great and all but please don't give the Biden administration a pass like you did for the Obama administration. If Trump taught us nothing else it's that when you ignore abuses from your side, they will be doubled down on by the other side.
There might not be any partisan differences in states that already use VBM, but if bluer states increase its use while reddish states do not, vote margins for Biden will increase.  He could win nationally by 7 million votes and yet lose in the EC.
Biden and Harris are the same as trump and Biden is a klansman who brought slave markets to Libya but these ppl against confederates got no issue with slavery we brought there
Trump will do far worse (and less) for this country than Biden but....they both suck. Politics is always choosing between the lesser of two evils. We need an ACTUAL change to the system. I‚Äôm sick of choosing between two shitty options.
And Mark responded that the data here is skewed to the topical news of Biden picking his VP. It's literally the first line in the summary of data on the link Clay provided.  But alas, its still apples and oranges, per my earlier point.
vote for biden because you will be able to hold him accountable also please donot hold biden accountable because that is a vote for trump
I am afraid there is no more time to settle for these bullshit artists. Ecologically, sociologically, and financially Biden is the worst choice imaginable. It is time to quell this.
Joe Biden has welcomed progressive input in his campaign. Lefty activists are hoping Kamala Harris, his vice-presidential nominee, will be just as flexible,  reports:
Watch Joe Biden and Kamala Harris First Joint Campaign Event Here
It would help to get a commitment to a policy platform so we can hold them accountable.  So far in the last 48 hours Biden has backtracked on M4A by saying people will get free coronavirus treatment.  Dude what about after that?!?!
Obama/Biden: "Listen to scientific experts. Constantly reevaluate options." Trump/Pence: "The FDA is wrong. Listen to the demon-sperm lady. There are only two options: take Hydroxychloroquine or inject yourself with bleach."
Your tweets alone can cheer me up. I‚Äôm trying to find the collection of montages from the 25th Ammendment now. I‚Äôm sick of the orange clown saying Biden is not mentally fit. 4 some reason I think it was u who put them 2gether. I want 2 post them so bad on FB where the asses are!
Dear Nate, We are not joined at the hip. Biden hasn't done anything to earn a vote. He believes he is entitled. Most Bernie Bros were Independents, and lean towards 'green' policies and aid the working class. Biden ain't that.
Biden and Kamala..tough on crime but also on board with police reforms..that's what the country needs right now..but we need to push for more reforms and more crime prevention than prison filling..
Obama/Biden: "Do this." Trump/Pence: "Do the opposite of this."
Yes, yes, yes.This, to me, is job one for the Biden-Harris administration.
Biden owns a gun

Clearly you‚Äôre not interested, I just don‚Äôt really care. ‚ÄúLol Dr. Jill Biden had no ‚Äòporn pics‚Äô‚Äù jokes are sex shaming and obnoxious. Comments about people being less-than because they don‚Äôt have a college degree are elitist.
This country is a mess. As a Conservative, I want a guaranteed, accurate election. In person or absentee with Verified ID. There is too much division and distrust on both sides for any mail in nonsense. And if we LEGITIMATELY elect Biden, then so be it. I‚Äôll do what I have to.

"...only the 2nd Black woman ever to serve in the US Senate, and the first South Asian-American woman. No Black woman has ever served as the governor of a state...no Black woman had ever been on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket."   The power she has!
I keep tryna say that only way Trump loses is if he fumbles hard, but instead Biden's the one continually fumbling. It's gotta be game over right?
LISTEN. Biden should‚Äôve picked Bernie as his running mate. But I see what they did. Having an African American woman on the ticket is MONUMENTAL, so I‚Äôm not taking anything from her. Trump is going to spend the next 80 days focusing on defining a woman.. &amp; what she should be.
Ads here in NC by the admin take Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄúNot gonna be happy about raised taxes‚Äù (referring to the rich and himself, actually) and making it seem like he meant the middle and lower classes.  Still yet to see an ad about their successful COVID management though. Weird.
What jobs? We're tired of all the lies. That's why the Biden&amp; Harris ticket is the honest WINNER!
Remember all the hiring signs we saw in the past 3 years;  displayed in stores, on back of vehicles, billboards and everywhere we looked? Now think back to the 8 years of Biden and Obama.

This is exactly the tactics Putin uses and this will happen in every Republican state Trump needs. FL, TX, GA, PA, OHIO, etc..  Biden and Harris should file complaints now.
We have been hearing no defense for Biden since the reports surfaced... Unilaterally, the Democratic party has chosen to completely ignore or disavow outright the claims. I understand innocent until proven guilty, but people should at least investigate and have an inquiry.
WOW ! THAT IS DISTURBING TO SAY THE LEAST.

A phrase you are beginning to hear pop up in private conversations about #presidential race is: '#JoeBiden has a lead..but his support is a mile wide and an inch deep". One operative characterized Biden support in #NorthCarolina as "1/4 mile wide 1/4 inch deep" Keep that in mind
PS...  Had he picked Klobuchar I suspect that would have been the knockout punch.  She would have delivered the midwest.  Harris?  Outside of California she's not well liked and never polled more than 1%.  California already voted for Biden so it doesn't matter.

Hats off to Biden for making political ads that are actually pro-biden instead of just anti-trump. I still don't like the guy, but I can at least respect that, especially since dissing Trump is so easy.

I would say that Biden is Catholic*** or quality it somehow.   Many priests won‚Äôt perform communion or other rites while he had a left leaning abortion agenda.  Seems like a fake religion like trump standing with a bible photo.
I feel you. If you just think logically, the dems were very divided in 2016.. and are pretty united right now. There is a female POC on the ticket, and several prominent republicans have abandoned Trump. Biden is the perfect centrist to peel away his support.
Did anybody tell Biden?
Hey, Democrats. I have heard the new Biden ads, in which he says that everyone has a right to be treated with dignity. Considering what he and Harris plan for preborn children, someone should explain to him what dignity means.

When pointing out a blatant lie from Biden, why is it necessary to state you‚Äôre not a fan of Trump? Just point out the damn lie!
If Joe Biden Speaks about anything, it is to build confidence in every American Child above the age of 5. That they are already intellectually developed beyond the level of a Democrat Presidential Candidate. And therefore they can accomplish anything if they so choose.
So are you writing a column about Joe Biden, since he just mispronounced her name????
I‚Äôd like to see side by side videos of Trump and Biden speaking. Somebody make one.
People must understand that the Democrats are NOT the party that "cares." They are that, you are voting foe party of genocide. if you vote Democrat, you are voting for killing the helpless.
Joe Biden's Awful Vice Presidential Pick
Hahaha, I completely agree. The Kamala Harris pick makes a lot of sense to me because she will immediately demonstrate an organizational competence the Biden and Trump both lack. It may not be impactful now, but when she has to speak I expect her to dominate the weak competition.
Thanks for sharing the good news! I‚Äôm even happier I get to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket now.
Trump's handling of COVID is the issue of the election, but there seems to be more at play here. Only 38 percent of Americans approve of his response. 58 disapprove. Biden's pathetic campaign is making this WAY closer than it should be.

And there's no particular reason to be confident that partisan State Supreme Courts or even SCOTUS will be especially interested in resolving the Biden campaign's emergency petitions the way they are interested in hearing emergency Trump petitions

On one hand yes it SEEMS like the dozens of bad faith legal actions would eventually be resolved in the favor of Biden, on the other hand an 11th hour order granted by a random partisan state judge in a critical swing state could be terrible
Ideally this won't be resolved this year, and with no leadership and voiding all the horrible things done, we can have a humane approach in the Biden/Harris administration.
She lost the election. Not saying to wait, saying to fight them *now* which people won't do if they assume Biden will win.   I always have faith in Democrats to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, especially when they act like they are in a fair fight when they are so not.

One under discussed difference between the Clinton and Biden campaigns is that Biden‚Äôs team have made early and consistent investments in the states that shocked us on election night ‚Äò16 by voting for Trump.   Clinton effectively ran no campaign in several of these states.

Good point. I think conclusions about not having a policy mandate are difficult to make in polls that demand only one response. This one simply shows that getting Trump out of office is the highest priority for Biden voters.
Not sure you can reach this conclusion from a poll that requires you to select only one response. Getting Trump out of office is the highest priority for those voting for Biden. Full stop.

I called him Rudy Colludy earlier today. He's asking ignorant questions about Hunter Biden and other people/things of no relevance to the election.
But it doesn‚Äôt matter if Biden loses 10% because of voter suppression. Trump can win this if nothing is done about him blocking voting from every direction.  With what I see, I think Trump will ‚Äúwin‚Äù and this is all so depressing.
Translation:  Trump: 50-57 Biden: 34-41  (Based on polls historically weighted 8-15% in favor of Democrats)
Between the last three minutes of that game and watching Biden try to keep this thing between the lines through November, I don't even need booze to be completely on edge and feel like shit anymore!
Well, the difference between these two is Biden will concede victory to Trump if the election result is proven to be fair whereas, as for Trump, he will refuse to concede no matter the result. That's the difference between an adult and a toddler.
Just saw a nice Biden ad though.

I am getting so disheartened.  Just as polls show #Biden leading and Trump floundering, I keep seeing tweets from pundits who say "he could win with the EC," or "what happens between November and January even if he loses" or about the USPS being decimated so he'll win.
Elizabeth Warren is a political virtuoso: the Joan Sutherland of politics.  I‚Äôll go to my grave thinking about what could have been.  I‚Äôm voting for Biden but can he please throw us paupers a tiny bone ü¶¥...?

I didn't address "It's always politics with Donnie."  Look at Joe Biden. Harris.. really?? Always politics with you Democrats, anything to win.  Burn the Country down to win.  We love Trump because Trump loves America. Trump is a Patriot. He puts America 1st. So FO you communist.

Besides Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, whose convention speech are you most excited to hear?
We already watched Joe Biden today.  No thank you to Trump!!
Trump should debate Biden 3 times and the fourth debate against Kamala since she‚Äôll be governing
Sadly, also sounds like something the president would say too! Which is precisely the problem. Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'
We are digging mass graves now in America to bury those who have died from Corona virus. We have a facist President. This is our reality. Biden believes in Democratic process &amp; Biden will improve our health crisis. That‚Äôs all I care about at this point.
Dude, relax with the hard sell, I'm already voting for her and Biden
If Democrats - especially Joe Biden - don't show some bold and outraged leadership about the Republicans literally stealing our government right in front of our eyes, then I can only conclude that they aren't fit to govern us either.
A few months back I signed up for Trump's campaign mailing list out of curiosity. Not kidding...they sent me 7 emails the day Biden picked Harris as his VP. They all say exactly the same thing. Apparently those two are the farthest left candidates that the democrats could find.ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Right.  Trumps been in public office for 3 years.  Joe Biden has been in public office for 48 years.  Do nothing Joe.  Except make his family rich.

It wont matter meaningfully.  Biden is all for natural gas which will accelerate release of methane.  Weve already passes tipping points so really this is all academic posturing and rearranging chairs on the titanic.  Weve jumped off a cliff, now do we land on rocks or ocean?
Under the Democrats, I firmly believe we would see:  Rampant destitution Negative growth Epic job loss And the Dream turning into a Nightmare.  In other words: A return to the Obama/Biden years and all that came with it.

Question:  Kamala Harris ran in the primary all last year, and she's been the frontrunner for Biden's running mate ever since he got the nomination.  How are the Republicans SO unprepared for her?  Did they convince themselves that Biden would pick Warren?
Biden is a racist. I concur.
I pitched a story to a major national pub asking to go to SC simply to report out the narrative playing out in churches and other key spaces w some other Biden themes I had discovered. A editor kept asking ‚Äúbut what poll will you be basing this story on?‚Äù

They may try to charge Obama or Biden to affect the election. Now that Trump's crony controls the USPS, I worry about Democrat absentee/mail-in ballots being systematically thrown away based on some Saudi or Israeli algorithm Jared's buddies cooked up for him as a favor.
But but but how come Biden‚Äôs not up more in the swing states of Texas and Georgia?!?!?
YES. Biden and Harris need to always be this forceful and straightforward when talking about what Trump and his cronies are doing to the USPS. They need to regularly tell every American to drop off their absentee/mail ballots at their county elections board IN PERSON if they can.
Let‚Äôs be clear, if you don‚Äôt vote because you don‚Äôt agree with Biden‚Äôs pick. YOU ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP.

Again I understand, and it‚Äôs an unfortunate situation we are in of not having a candidate that truly inspires us and speaks to us. However there are lives that are at stake. As shitty as it is fewer lives will be lost under a Biden/Harris administration.
Since we are comparing circumstances, Bernie wasn‚Äôt a realistic alternative after Super Tuesday. The momentum shifted and Biden clearly claimed victory. Polling and votes were against him.
I'm less concerned by her temperament than her qualifications.  In addition, Biden excluded 93% of the population by using race &amp; gender as a prerequisite for the job.  How is this acceptable?

Now do Joe Biden.
47 years of zero and I mean zero accomplishments. He's had 1 job his entire life.  What new and fresh ideas will Biden bring to the table??   Stock market will hit an all time high this week.  TRUMP
He is an absolute sellout; and Biden has zero dignity
So actively cutting social programs is better?   I‚Äôm not unfamiliar with Biden‚Äôs shortcomings dude   The problem is that you, and other Twitter-only leftists have yet to provide a viable alternative that results in something other than a Biden or Trump presidency.
Biden is absolutely screwed
He‚Äôd have to go on record as a D president, opposing a bill passed by the D house and senate.   And M4A won‚Äôt get passed until it‚Äôs viable   Does voting for Biden change my ability to oppose him 4 the next 4 years? If neither candidate supports M4A, I‚Äôm considering other factors
No, 3+ years apart.  However, Biden has been milking America for 47 years! Numb nuts...
Trump shouldn‚Äôt even be allowed to run. He‚Äôs. Heated the entire time staring w/Giuliani digging up dirt on Biden in Ukraine, to Kushner colluding with Kanye for a bogus ballot run and Trump slowing down the postal service. He‚Äôs a dirt bag and a cheat!
I have a bunch of examples of what Biden has done and said‚Äînone of them positive. I remember, even though he probably doesn‚Äôt. üòâ
Exactly! Someone (political blue check) said a desperate candidate asks for more debates. Hoping Biden denies and he can attack him for it? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Remind me how many states Joe Biden carried in his first two presidential runs before becoming Vice President of the United States of America?
Biden has nothing to gain by debating Trump. Nothing at all. He's already in the lead. When someone asks for an additional debate (the Trump camp just did) it means they know their candidate is tanking. That said, Trump won't do any, let alone four.

I was sad for about 10 days after Warren dropped out of the race.   Then I dusted myself off and put on my big boy boots, because Trump is that bad.   If you need to be spoon fed reasons to vote for Biden-Harris, you're less reasonable than my toddler.
But Sanders endorses Biden. By that logic, he also isn‚Äôt a progresssive.
I wonder if this is like the World Cup where they print swag for all the top VP contenders? Or like the iPhone where Biden actually make his choice a while back and the printers were under NDA?
Yeah the OP wasn‚Äôt disputing that.  The point is that Biden was handsy with women and that made Reade more plausible.  Morse has no comparable, visible record of misconduct.  There is a really obvious difference there
While stricter gun control measures have at times been a major part of Harris‚Äô campaign platforms, the issue was barely raised at Wednesday's press conference.
I was genuinely impressed by Biden and Harris modeling social distancing at this event. I know it‚Äôs a formality, but that‚Äôs the point. Leaders *should* model proper public health behavior. It matters!  I also love that they‚Äôre selling Biden/Harris masks.
Exactly. I plan to vote for Biden and bitch about him for the next 4 years, ideally he gets primaried but idk if it‚Äôs likely   Politicians listen to the people that vote for them, above all else (except money but that‚Äôs a different convo)
Anyone watching Biden/Harris must be able contrast the divisiveness of Trump. For the first time in 4 years I watched LEADERS who were kind, strong, positive- oh man, what a joy!!!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
How do you top the words of Biden and Harris which sounded like a beautiful symphony in contrast.
Milli Vanilli would be an appropriate analogy for Biden and Harris. 100% fake and full of poo.
Everybody but Ben Carson will vote for Biden/Harris.
The fact that Biden chose KH is still not enough to persuade this perennial republican to vote for someone who says the spawn of Hitler are "some good people" or that he wishes well to the pimp of a pedophile.  For the record, no, the spawn of Hitler have NO good people!
Hawkins/Walker. Only real choice. We must talk both past and present. Neither Trump/Pence nor Biden/Harris will address the pressing issues this nation faces. We must vote our values. #VoteGreen2020 #RideTheGreenWave
Biden and Harris make debut as running mates, vowing to defeat Trump  Try to keep your pants on Joe, your chance is coming.
Not sure who Biden is talking to. Certainly no one with an attention span longer than that of a gnat.
Democrats never do things straight forward or above board.  My belief is that they plan to get Biden elected and then, within 6 months remove him as incompetent, thus elevating Harris to POTUS.  Barring election fraud, it would all be done Constitutionally.  But it would be done.
$30 million in a single day from individual donors is an incredible feat for Biden and Harris.
But did not mention H1N1 which arguably killed more people than Covid.  Probably because the Obama/Biden response to that epidemic was nonexistent.
But avoided altogether a comparison to H1N1. Probably because doing so would show how Obama/Biden did precisely NOTHING to counter that epidemic.
Wouldn't surprise me if they try and charge Biden or Obama with some bullshit. Trump is a wannabe autocrat.
But they will scrupulously avoid mention of the Obama/Biden response to H1N1.  Which, BTW, was precisely NOTHING.
Just watched Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak as a ticket. This is the first time I‚Äôve been excited and energized by a VP pick! #KamalaHarris #BidenHarris2020
Just in case you forgot Joe Biden will be 78 in November.
This is the one positive. If Biden makes Harris head of his pandemic task force, it will be in the hands of someone that is extremely competent. Though the jury is still out on the states with Republican leaders ... I doubt they will be on board w any Dem plan
And notice, Harris mentioned Ebola, but NOT the H1N1 epidemic. That, of course, is because H1N1 arguably killed more people (under Obama/Biden) than Covid has.  I'm in no way minimizing or dismissing the seriousness of Covid. I'm simply trying to inject some reality into things.
‚ÄúAnd like everything else he‚Äôs inherited, he‚Äôs run ot in the ground.‚Äù (the economy from Obama/Biden) the NEXT VP of the United States,
that would be great, i hope they do.  Biden‚Äôs current plan doesn‚Äôt even restore the tax rate to the (low) level it was at under Obama
Love this Beau Biden connection. And Joe and Kamala Harris bringing it up. And the specifics of their relationship. Makes me teary. It's SO good for parents to hear other people talk about their kids, no matter what age. Love that she did that. #BidenHarris2020
Sure that could happen...but why doesn't Biden win MS then, not to mention NC.  (Or OH for that matter.)
I mean that's fair but it's a bit of a strawman in Tucker's case. He went on an irrational rant about how it means she can't be criticized. It's not a big deal he mispronounced it. It is a big deal he didn't respect her enough to look it up or care he did. Biden clearly did.
What a delight to think of all the highly competent people who could be part of the Biden administration
Okay, sure Trump could win NH...but how does Biden win LA at the same time...while not winning MS...but winning GA...and not winning NC???
Biden doing a great job of singing Kamala‚Äôs praises as he introduces her now on CNN...
Biden says Kamala has our back, now it‚Äôs time to have hers...such a loaded statement.  I‚Äôm trying to be good today...I promise üòá
STARTING NOW: Biden and Harris give their first joint remarks as running mates. Watch live:
Remember when Biden introduced Obama as "Barack America" in 2008 when Biden was selected as VP?
Even  discredited this idea that Biden is pro-defunding when Chris Wallace interviewed Trump. Come on, NCGOP. Your arguments are in bad faith at this point.
Any minute now, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will appear in Wilmington, Delaware, at their first event together. Don't miss their show-stopping opening duet on "Ain't No Mountain High Enough." It's sure to be amazeballs.
I like the way you think. But I also think Biden can win Montana and Alaska, so I may be a touch too exuberant.
I agree 100% with your point, but I don't get how it's related to Republicans trying to get Kanye to pull votes away from Biden.
His lead in North Carolina is probably about 2-4 points. And Biden got 50% in this poll, which is noteworthy in itself.
gahhhh... i want to watch this Biden Harris unity rally  with people who are fired up!   Stinks to have to socially distance
Joe Biden could not pick his own NOSE
May vote biden/harris to epically troll internet leftists and alt right at the same time
Wow Biden, you hit 3 with one stone. Great advertising, this will fool them. No, really.
It‚Äôs a surprisingly appealing pitch, and I think the Biden team knows it.
Update: Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris will speak at 4:30 p.m. ET.

(fwiw, I think if we play this election right Biden and Harris, to say nothing of Pelosi and Schumer, will have a caucus of Dems in Congress that is markedly to the left of the administration and will push them aggressively on policy. But that's my last shred of optimism talking)
C'mon man... Biden is still trying to decide, green or red jello.
I love this take.  Get Trump out of office but push Biden/Harris to get on board with policies you care about !!!
Biden/Harris still well ahead of you, Corona baby.

We need YOUR help getting the word out! Let's get everyone in NC *United For Biden/Harris* to win in November!  #NCForJoe #TeamRespectNoMalarkey 6/6
Biden &amp; Harris are not progressive enough. They have both done awful things. I‚Äôm disappointed that Biden is the Democratic Party candidate and that Harris is his chosen VP.   But I am still voting for them. And I think you should too.
I'm sure you were trying to look like Biden...right?
omg thought it was Biden lol
My point is that she has multiple allegiances and her loyalties aren‚Äôt necessarily to blacks especially black Americans. She &amp; those behind her play up the ‚Äúblack woman‚Äù thing when it‚Äôs convenient. She adds nothing to the Biden ticket imo. Her presidential campaign was a failure
Any % of voters voting for Kanye is detrimental to Biden and helpful for Trump. If you don‚Äôt get that, idk what to tell you.
So what? The dispute is not that the prosecutor was corrupt; the point is that Biden was on the take, so he pushed the firing for his own personal ulterior motives
I need news stories about woke police unions backing Biden/Harris
Biden Harris 2020 let's get it done!
Voting for Joe Biden only feels like the only option if the arc of your political participation begins and ends with the electoral process
So what I'm seeing is this: Socialists hate Biden because they think he's a Republican, and Republicans hate him because they think he's a socialist.
Republican attack ads here are doing all they can to associate Biden with AOC and other progressives in an attempt to scare voters, because they know it has a chance.
I think Biden and Harris have a chance to get as much done as a more progressive team, due to having a lower fear level than a truly progressive team.
And the supposed extent to which a candidate is Jewish is no way the determinative factor for me in this election. "Trump or Biden? Hard to say so I'll just go with the one the Jewish establishment can convince me is most Jewish!"
I do get asked about candidates' faith. Here's something I found.  5 faith facts about Biden‚Äôs veep pick, Kamala Harris ‚Äî a Baptist with Hindu family, via
Meanwhile the GOP has moved further into total unreality and gaslighting at the behest of a buffoonish would-be fascist. Maybe the mainstream democratic part has moved very far left (doubtful given that Biden won the primary), but the GOP has shown that they believe in nothing.
I mean, yeah I‚Äôll vote for Biden but I‚Äôm gonna angry cry while I do it
Just call them female Biden supporters. üòå
Who am I kidding? All the people mad at me for not being excited about a Biden/Harris ticket will likely cease all political engagement until around this time in 2024
If you hate the system, GOOD.  We can‚Äôt change the system without a voice in the system.  Unless you‚Äôre happy with Trump as your voice, you have to vote and you have to vote for Biden.   Do I like it? No! But is it what we‚Äôre faced with? Yes.
There‚Äôs no statement to be made with a protest vote if the person in office won‚Äôt even acknowledge the protest.  If he wins Trump will set us back YEARS.   If you vote for anyone but Biden Trump will win.   Period.  It is the harsh truth of our broken system.
Righties saying Kamala called Biden a racist when she explicitly said he isn‚Äôt when asked, pointedly, after the relevant primary debate by a reporter last year is relevant.    They‚Äôre going to use ‚Äúwoke‚Äù as a proxy for exoticizing her and sadly it will work with some anti-wokies.
Seeing a lot of Biden/Harris hate on my TL.  And I get it, I do.  But there is no world in which they are comparable to another 4 years of Trump/Pence.  In order to progress in any way Trump has to be voted out this election cycle.  Period. End of discussion.
I can't wait to see y'all try to push Biden left
I should donate to get a chance to speak to both Biden and Harris, so that way, if I am picked, I can just tell them to ‚ÄúFuck Off‚Äù and ‚ÄúFuck You Both for using us and being in bed with the Wall Street Corporatists.‚Äú  And also thank Harris for taking money from the Trump Family.üòâ
Joe Biden just did.
Trying to say  should be in Biden's cabinet, now that she didn't get the VP nod, where you can't push progressive policies like she can in the senate is honestly kind of a slap in the face. She deserves better and her expertise cannot be confined to one area.
I‚Äôm mostly just looking forward to her making those lefties‚Äô heads explode tbh. Lol  kAmAlA iS a CoP   Between that and ‚ÄúBiden is Antifa‚Äù the opposition to the ticket is running very thin and is poorly thought out.
Maybe vote Green &amp; just say you rode the Biden bus.
I'm going to be on edge the probability of Biden being elected is 100%, which will not occur until the votes are tallied and the election results certified.  Until then, we need to encourage people to vote like their lives depend on it.
White people saying Hillary lost because we talked shit about her &amp; that we shouldn't be critical of Biden and Harris while voting for them. Politicians need to be held accountable. Even when campaigning they have to serve us, because we are giving time &amp; money to help them win.
A lot of justifiable anger out there as well, especially around prison/police abolition and Kamala's history with it. But I would argue there's more room for holding the Biden/Harris admin accountable on progressive demands than a Trump admin with an even worse track record
rich celebrities are so quick to support biden and kamala because they will always be protected by society, regardless of what's going on in the world.   they won‚Äôt have to deal with our struggles in the same way.
Its just tiring "we have to vote Biden in so we can get real change later"  No one sees we are actually going backward, nothings getting fixed, but the rich are getting richer, black and brown people are imprisoned more, climate is deteriorating.  What is it gonna take?
Cool imma vote for Biden
The person you replied to didn't say all boomers like him though. Anyway, moving on. Need to focus our efforts on electing Biden. üëç
What was going on in the head of the consultants that thought Kamala would get Biden even one more vote in a swing state than he already had.  Is there something I'm missing?
But I‚Äôm sure this won‚Äôt be the end of that right wing ad about how Biden‚Äôs America will be scary and cop-less showing up on my tv bc Joe Biden is so ~radical~
Biden +2 and DePasquale +2 in #PA10
Also true. The public wanted something done about crack. The original CBC bill accomplished that without centering incarceration. That‚Äôs not what Joe Biden and the Clintons sold to the people
Bernie is all in for Biden/Harris.  Let's take a page from his book and unite to take our country back and govern with compassion and humanity.
üëÜüëÜüëÜ And allies that Biden and Kamala would consider "anarchists"  They would just do it "legally" and eith the backing of neoliberals
We've lived for four years under a man who can never be criticized. If the only people who can serve in Biden's White House are people who have nothing negative to say about it, we're in for four more.
The other thing I'm super sick of is the hot take that Harris has recently criticized Biden on the debate stage and therefore she should have rejected the VP pick. Why? Criticism is good. I hope she keeps criticizing him all the way to the Oval and in it.
Imagine telling politically engaged, complex, sophisticated, intelligent people who are struggling with a myriad of problems that Biden/Kampala are the "most progressive" ticket in US history.  Its shameful and embarrasing.  We have cspan and records. Its a bold faced lie.
I be seeing y‚Äôall tweets and be like:  Yeah there‚Äôs no way they have read up anything on Biden fr lol guys when I do ya research, ian telling you to hack the NSA. Im telling you to go the man campaign websiteüòÇ its allll thereü§Ø crazy right.
If you email me or message me and your "climate focused strategy" is to canvas and vote for Biden/Kamala.  Please dont talk to me and leave me alone. Thanks.
The CBC knew the Biden bill was bad, and offered their own version of the bill that focused on drug treatment, mental health, community interventions, demilitarization of the local police, and racial justice. White Congresspeople and bitch ass Lacy Clay stripped it of everything.

This is where we diverge. I do not believe I owe the Democratic Party my loyalty. I will vote, bc voting is important to me; but I am not sure I will vote for a major party candidate. And if I do not vote for Joe Biden and he loses, I will not be convinced that it is my fault.
I can‚Äôt wait for y‚Äôall to say ‚Äúc‚Äômon man, there was crack everywhere‚Äù in defense of Biden bankruptcy bill.
Joe Biden's Awful Vice Presidential Pick
Biden is a practicing catholic. Why do you spew lies to stoke hatred and divisiveness?
Apropos of future Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Cory Booker, I was interviewing Barney Frank for something recently and he said that, if Biden wins, Biden should put Mike Bloomberg in charge of HUD.
Telling Progressives that they should be happy while voting for Biden and Kamala is like telling women they would look prettier if they smiled more.
Same. Exactly. I was excited to vote trump out but now I‚Äôm also excited to vote for Biden and Harris. I can‚Äôt wait.
Electrifying!
I like this too. Biden is actually tilting his head down. Body language tells me SO much about someone.
#Fact Check:  üó≥While #Biden and #Harris may not have been your first choices, at least they know the ‚Äú1917‚Äù pandemic didn‚Äôt end WWII  üó≥The 1918 pandemic caused tens of millions of deaths worldwide in 1918 and 1919, not 1945  üó≥It did sicken soldiers during the final year of WWI
Biden and Kalama are bad for Black people when it comes to crime.  But Tony The Tiger has been bad for Black folk economically
LOL she's a self-declared "Top Cop" of California. How will THAT play out? She also said she believed Joe's accuser! OK so the Top Cop believes Biden is guilty of sexual harassment!! but now you pander to the left, hilarious
i just had a class of 3rd graders shit on Trump so hard lmao they dont fw biden either tho
‚ÄúHarris might also be a good policy influence on Biden if he treats her as a real governing partner, as he hopefully will. Here are three reasons why.‚Äù #progressives #KamalaHarris
Y'all are really ready to fall for the jig.  Black people are still suffering. Having a black VP won't change that. We celebrated Obama like Jesus was here and did he save us?  Is there doubt in ANYBODY'S mind we will continue to suffer under Biden/Harris?  Wolf in sheepskin.
Glad I didn't have to see Biden at the dentist, tho.
"Make no mistake: Putting a qualified person of color like Harris ‚Äî whose parents are Jamaican and Indian immigrants ‚Äî on the ticket is a statement against President Trump."  Takeaways from Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris from
I dont wanna sound flippant but yea.  Community is your best defense. And cant fight if your hungry. So priorities.  "Under no pretext"  Its why Biden/Kamala scare me. They are perfect for instituting a disarmament of the working class while upgrading the militarization of cops.
a voter rights org put together by basketballer  may have an important impact in this crucial election. We need this. All hands on deck! #Vote2020 #Biden #KamalaHarris2020
We‚Äôve heard your racist misogynistic attacks before. BORING. Biden/Harris. We have your backs.
üåä twitter:   "In this essay I will show how Biden and Kamala will take the exact opposite policy position they have historically taken and are actually more progressive than MLK, Stalin, Bush Jr. Climate change will be so afraid it will stop on its own. Vote and donate!"
Neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris were inevitable selections. They were chosen, and different choices could have been made.
No question about it, As a suburban housewife I would climb mountains to vote for Biden and Harris!  #BidenHarris2020
GOPmay not be willing to do anything about trumps racism, misogyny dog whistles, but women of color, white women, suburban women, will do something about it on Nov. 3rd.  We have Biden/Harris ticket backs that‚Äôs for sure.
Kamala Harris is a f**king warrior, and that‚Äôs what Joe Biden needs right now. She will also make an excellent POTUS, whenever that time comes.   All the rest is noise.   #BidenHarris2020
Way too close for comfort.  We still have plenty of work to do.  Let‚Äôs get on it.  I just donated to the Biden-Harris campaign.
do Postal workers vote for Biden given  intentional actions to harm USPS and the wonderful people that work so hard for our country?
I think the pro is she energizes some of the DNC progressives that were disappointed in Biden.   I think the con is she doesn‚Äôt inspire independents or nevertrumpers.
How is Biden trying to manipulate you? This just seems like catastrophising.
If this was your original tweet (which doesn‚Äôt include using Warren statements as an excuse to not vote for Biden) I wouldn‚Äôt have taken any issue with it.  You don‚Äôt owe anyone your vote.
I‚Äôm talking about Biden and Warren.
Saying Biden is saying something when he isn‚Äôt and getting frustrated about it is silly.   The SJW part is about how you mentioned his statement as if he didn‚Äôt publically apologize for it.
you fool. vote for Biden/Harris or you're voting for cheeto.
You can run through the same hypocrisy on the new right. Nothing about Trump‚Äôs spending says ‚Äúfiscal responsibility.‚Äù   But I digress. My point is this prediction and Dems who had a primary choice other than Biden prophesying that X candidate would have crushed Trump is...wild.
Warren isn‚Äôt on the ticket, and Biden isn‚Äôt saying that.
What kills me about this is: 1) He either doesn‚Äôt remember that Biden was the ‚ÄúCatholic on the ticket‚Äù in 08 and 12, or is asserting that he‚Äôs not a catholic because of his abortion stance.  2)I wonder if he counts Pence as a Catholic because he grew up catholic before converting
Congratulations on being selected as Joe Biden‚Äôs VP.  #Bigsupporter #excitment #infectioussmile #ruleoflaw #beconofhope
Endorsement of Biden-Harris from Governor Roy Cooper of the great state of North Carolina. üôè üá∫üá∏
Let me just say to all the people that are hating the idea of Biden/Harris. The alternative will destroy America. The SC is going to lose RBG and I hope she can hang on until Nov. Do your protest voting or nonvoting in 2024 after we get rid of the sociopath in the WH.
This isn‚Äôt even ‚ÄúChomsky on Biden,‚Äù it‚Äôs Chomsky on the difference between voting and doing the work, and how people gotta be prepared to do both.
You said ‚Äúchoosing not to vote for a candidate that doesn‚Äôt align with ideals‚Äù  Your options are literally Biden, Trump, or not voting
It is unreal to me how people are talking about not voting for Biden because of Harris. Unclench your privileged ass.
In answer 2 latest Trump stupidity (he said Americans will have 2 learn Chinese if Biden is elected) I am ready 4 that, Donald, I have taken 2 years of #Mandarin
‚ÄúBiden may also face an outgoing administration that hinders his efforts, whether because of incompetence or malign intent. Planning, coordination, and information-sharing across government agencies and functions is vital to a successful transition.‚Äù
If you‚Äôre on this app referring to Biden and Harris as ‚Äúflawed candidates,‚Äù you should refrain from ever talking about politics ever again. Vote for your cops, and leave the rest of us alone.
You mean the base that got wiped out by Joe Biden? Not much of a base.
I voted for her, but if Biden/Harris win, Warren could become Secretary of Education or part of their cabinet in another way. It may not be over for her just yet.
Today's rule: every person who yaps about how Joe Biden is "building a bridge" should go watch "The Bridge on the River Kwai" to see how well the bridge building thing worked out for Alec Guinness. "Madness! Madness!" (Actually, just call quits on today &amp; watch a great film.)
#Bunkerboy is just predicting his biglee loss to the Biden Harris ticket
I hope I'm wrong. I hope the election happens relatively unimpeded and violence free. I hope Trump loses. I hope people snap out of the brainwashing. I hope biden/harris is the most "progressive" admin and takes real meaningful physical actions on racial, social, climate justice.
Trump‚Äôs failure to contain COVID has absolutely cratered the economy. Not talking about numbers on Wall Street. Talking about people‚Äôs lives, and jobs!  Voting for Biden, and Harris.
I mean is he supposed to openly disparage the nominee and vp pick because he lost? Or is he smart and understands that it will be far easier to get movement on his agenda under Biden/Harris than Trump/Pence? Idk what this tweet changes?
Biden could have picked Donald trump jr as his running mate and I‚Äôd still have to vote for him, why does anyone care who it is
Biden/Harris voters in swing states without much experience with mail-in voting - Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina &amp; Florida - should shun mail-in voting &amp; vote early, in person.  I‚Äôm in.  I‚Äôll take the risk. Others risked far more to make sure their vote counts.
I know people who post pics of their ( rightfully) jailed cousins who can't stand Kamala. Biden ain't getting that vote üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
It goes so far out of bounds. He is supposed to be apolitical. Talk about bias. He needs to resign. He needs to be held accountable even after Biden wins.
Biden struggles with green or red jello.  He didn't pick Harris.
Well best of luck in the election then. I hope Biden and his disaster of a pick will make you proud ü§£ü§£ü§£  You don‚Äôt look long for this world, however. So perhaps whether Trump wins or not (he‚Äôs going to win in a landslide), you won‚Äôt have to endure him.
If Biden is elected, they'll take credit for anything in the pipeline that will stem it.  If Trump is re-elected, they'll pillory him for having those same things in the pipeline and not on the market.
Well, why don‚Äôt you ask the President of Ukraine? He just named Biden as an accused party in a crime yesterday. üòÉ
Crucial thread. Look we have to vote Biden/Harris- but we also have to know exactly who we‚Äôre electing. Harris is pro-police, pro-war, pro-corporation &amp; has voted to further oppression of BIPOC Americans COUNTLESS times. Ethnicity &amp; gender do not a hero make.
Many ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù don‚Äôt think we Catholics are Christian.  Not all Catholics are Christians, but not all Christians are Christians either.  Living your faith is a choice-they shall know him by his fruits-Biden is a Catholic in name only.
So, to translate it out of CNN-speak...  Kammy will assume the office of president as soon as the DNC declares Biden unfit and  removes him. I conservatively estimate within 5-6 months.  Assuming, of course, that the American electorate is stump dumb stupid enough to elect them.
Legally, I don't know of a stipulation absolutely requiring a VP.  If I am correct, it would have been tactically better for Pelosi had Biden run without a VP.  Because in that case, should anything happen to Biden, Pelosi would, as Speaker, succeed to the Oval Office.
Me, now until Nov. 3: Biden/Harris 2020! Get on the bus! Me, for the entire ensuing four years: we elected you, now do your job, according to your electorate, who elected you. Imagine the damage the Trumpists could've done if they demanded real work out of their president
In the abstract, Biden and Harris are uncomfortably close to the center for my taste. But, pragmatically, my next president said "holy fucking shit don't drink bleach what is wrong with you people", and the next VP made little poop pellets come out of Barr and Kavanaugh
So, Biden was part of an administration that passed on prosecuting the previous administration for very clear crimes that could've stuck, at least for some. Heal and move on, I get it. But can a Biden/Harris ticket ignore the clear mandate that justice must be served?
So, what do you think is next For Elizabeth Warren?  You think she will have a Prominent Position in the Biden Administration like, Secretary Of State, Secretary Of Treasury?  Or do you think she will stay in the Senate and then make a run for President in 2024?  #Warren2024
I love how excited Kamala Harris‚Äôs colleagues are about her selection as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate. People who worked with her back in the day and people who work with her now have all said how great she is.   It‚Äôs nice to have candidates who just know how to work as a team.
Furthermore, Kamala Harris took money from Steve Mnuchin in 2016!  Kamala Harris for the people???? Riiiiiight, for the people My Ass. She only looks out for herself &amp; nobody else.  Fuck Kamala Harris, Screw Joe Biden, I'm Voting 3rd Party.  #Warren2024
Kamala Harris Accepted Donations From Donald Trump And Ivanka Trump, you honestly think she will do anything to him? No, she will let Donald Trump &amp; his Criminal Enterprise Walk!  As far as I'm concerned, Both Harris &amp; Biden can go to hell.  #Warren2024
If you do get a cabinet spot, do you think Biden will support any of your policies? I fear that it will be like Robert Reich in the Clinton administration. You would be better off running for mayor of NYC. Don't get burried by this establishment administration.
You said on your podcast that you expected to have a spot in Biden's cabinet. Do you still believe that after this? I fear they're just using you for your supporters and you'll never hear from them again after the election. They're engrained in the institution you are fighting.
Independent voters who don‚Äôt like Joe Biden‚Äôs VP choice in Kamala Harris and are threatening not to vote for him now are essentially guaranteeing another 4 more years of the worst president in US history! C‚Äômon! We have to stick together and see this through! #BidenHarris2020
I much rather prefer #HeelsUpHarris, with no mention of Biden. He‚Äôs as lost from this ticket as are his marbles. ü§£ü§£
At the end of the day, it‚Äôs whether you want Trump back or not. I hate to over simplify it butü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ur options:   Vote for Trump.....  No vote (which) = Trump vote  Kanye vote (which) = Trump vote   Vote for Biden
I willlllllll...NOT be voting for the Biden/#HeelsUpHarris ticket!   #Trump2020 #KAG2020 #TrumpTrain
you really are terrified right now aren't you ? yeah all the progressives in the Dem party are not happy with the pick right now but most will suck it up and vote for the Biden\Harris ticket. But you say she is radical and too far left. Sure that makes sense. Go with that. LOL
üê∑ FUCK KAMALA üê∑   IF BIDEN DIES, BERNIE IS THE PRESIDENT
Biden is a sellout. Kamala is a phony
Keep this in mind before your rush off to vote for the Segregationist/Cop (Biden/Harris)  ticket, folks! üòÉüëçüèº #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
It really does say that Biden has great BRAINS !!!
Did Biden ever say, "grab em by their p...y?" And excuse it as "locker room talk?". Did Biden ever have to pay off a porn star?  How many of Biden's cronies are in jail?
Waiting for his ‚ÄúBiden/Harris‚Äù fundraising email
That 17 year old who hacked Joe Biden‚Äôs account for a Bitcoin scam should have announced his Vice President instead. Huge missed opportunity
Val Demings would have been a Tim Kaine like choice for Biden, imo.   VPs gotta compliment the Pres.  Pence was the straight man and got religious cons.  Biden added experience and foreign policy.  Don't see what Demings would add b/c she is so similar to Biden in many ways.
why couldn't we have this race instead of the lame one we're stuck with?  Also we should run Hunter Biden on the Green Party so it's a 3 way brawl
The party ideologically is closer to Bernie (single payer gets 60% in primary exit polls) but loves the Obama years and they really want to beat Trump.   I expect the Sanders wing to go all out in '24, assuming Biden does not run again.
This reads like a Biden interview
Right? Biden was pro-choice on his previous two Dem tix/wins. Tim Kaine's pro-choice. Same with John Kerry. By this pedo-protecting bishop's standards, the numbnutz should be pouting that there's never been a single Roman Catholic candidate on either party's ticket.
Predicable: WaPo was going to say this about whatever running mate Biden chose.
i don‚Äôt wanna see any of y‚Äôall not showing up to the polls because you don‚Äôt like biden or harris because you know damn well trump supporters will be showing up and voting for his stupid ass
The LOL of the day today comes from a  fundraising email about the Biden/Harris ticket. "These two liberals are as far-left as they come." üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
I‚Äôm backing Biden and Harris 2020.
Biden leads Trump in Georgia, a state that Democrats haven't won in a presidential race since 1992
Ppl who think we gotta support biden/kamala because there is a white supremacist in the white house have a fundamental misunderstanding of what white supremacy is lol Trump is just loud. Biden's version and Kamala's adjacency have been/are/will be awful for millions of ppl.
And more good news for Biden and women voters today. Biden has an amazing 31% lead over Trump among women nationally in Monmouth poll (pre-Harris announcement).
I don‚Äôt think anyone in the market will vote for Biden if today was any indication of what his presidency will look like. üòÇüòÇ $spy $qqq
Was I confident that Biden could win Texas? Not really.  Am I confident that #BidenHarris2020 can win Texas? Hell, yes.
Joe Biden being president likely won‚Äôt enact sweeping changes.  The thing is, it‚Äôs either him or Trump at this point. And no matter how little Biden may or may not do, Trump is going to be worse. Guaranteed.
Derp!  Here‚Äôs where you can donate to the Biden-Harris campaign, everybody.
Could you imagine what 45 would say about and do to a person (i.e. a black woman) who harshly challenged him on the debate stage? I‚Äôll tell y‚Äôall one thing - he sure as hell isnt picking that person as his VP. Say what you will, but this says a lot about Biden‚Äôs character.
Joe Biden ran two campaigns before even winning a primary.
Ready to vote now for Biden/Harris. Hurry up November 3rd!
Ah yes, something well within his purview. Biden is truly a different political animal than.... John Kerry?
I guess you have this because Biden‚Äôs info is available while Trump‚Äôs is secret. Shame on you.
The Biden-Harris ticket &amp; new Congress (with a record number of progressive BIPOC/women as Democratic candidates) can together enact a progressive agenda. Progressives need to hold the Biden administration accountable but there's a lot to be optimistic about! #BidenHarris2020
Where you alive during the Obama Administration? Which Biden was VP of? When do you think the BLM movent started.
lmao if they think Biden and Harris are far-left
I think it‚Äôs great that Biden picked a woman, and intentionally so.  Kamala Harris is one of several woman qualified to be President.  It‚Äôs good to have more women at the decision-making table.
I have very little hope that a Biden/Harris administration will do much to help the poor or move us forward in ways we desperately need. But I feel reasonably sure they won't actively kill people, so....ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs a black woman. I don‚Äôt agree with much Kamala and Biden have to say. I will still do everything to get them elected. I‚Äôve spent hours trying to decide what my reaction is and I think it‚Äôs just numbness, but there‚Äôs work to be done.
Biden already has one more person than trump does that'll call him on his bullshit and he's only filled one position.
Radical left Radical left Radical left Does this crap resonate with rubes?  Joe Biden...radicalüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump is a literal white supremacist so yeah I‚Äôm far from enthused but will vote for Biden and Harris
Is Biden not Catholic? Am I making this up?
Kamala got the Republicans out here accidentally campaigning for Biden.
When this game started, Joe Biden had not yet announced Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate. #CBJVsTB
I mean, black women. That‚Äôs it! That‚Äôs who will step up &amp; Biden knows it.   The immature left still has to learn to do the hard work of politics. Compromising. Coalition-building. Service.   Not sure they‚Äôll ever get there.
I guess he should've cared what Biden said.
biden is really trolling the ACAB crowd with this one, real king shit
Black Women Have Been Waiting for Kamala Harris Far Too Long
If Trump had shown just a little bit of restraint and a little more support for moderate reforms in May and June, he could easily outflank Biden on criminal justice  But because he went so hardline you can be tough on crime and still look like the progressive next to him
Radical left!üòÇüòÇüòÇ You tried it with Obama You tried it with Hillary You even tried it with Biden! Your playbook is as old and moldy as your constituents!
Especially since Biden is Antifa and wants to defund the police. üòÇ  They clearly don‚Äôt think more than one step ahead.
My thought was ‚ÄúI‚Äôll probably grit my teeth and vote Biden as long as it isn‚Äôt Kamala.‚Äù  Now I don‚Äôt know (but definitely won‚Äôt be Trump)
Also Tim Kaine has more or less the same views as Biden on the obvious hot-button issues Tobin is thinking of, why does he count?
The Biden campaign equates socialists and plutocrats fo gods sake
If you think voting for a cop, old white segregationist who has been on the wrong side of history at every opportunity, and a Wall St approved cabinet is "fighting" American fascism...  Will you be surprised when the protests continue and Biden/Kampala clamp down harder than T?
This strategy is gonna backfire. Painting Biden and Harris as "radical left" is just gonna help turn out the far-left Democrats.
Great headline.
Biden-Harrisüëçfor me. + AG Adam Schiff to BRING THE PAIN after 3+ years to 45 and  who are tied sloppy close with a ‚Äúcord of steel‚Äù. The real Super Bowl is probs not happening. THIS is the righteous Super Bowl of our era. See ya in court, then prison,
#Biden well past his #sellbydate  The guy is decepid
I have read it. Biden has been bad on mass incarceration.  But your contention above? It's just opportunistic inanity, the recency bias in full effect.
Imagine: it‚Äôs March 2021. The Biden Justice Department has been *actually* investigating foreign bribery issues: the Trump Campaign, the Trump Org, government officials who blatantly defied the law for the last four years. Indictments are rumored.   Who gets indicted first?
PBS did a great synopsis of #KamalaHarris‚Äôs career. Biden and Harris are already leading by example.  ‚ô•Ô∏è‚úåüèΩ
Biden did! üòÅ
y‚Äôall really think Biden gonna win? üåö
Joe Biden only picked Kamala so he can get all the black votes... we were gonna vote for him anyways cause we don‚Äôt have a choice
The nicest thing I can say about today‚Äôs news?  Biden/Harris 2020 At Least It Isn‚Äôt Klobuchar or Buttigieg
Boy, he got that right! Biden-Harris: the clear choice!
Just know I see you. Getting your Biden &amp; Kamala jokes off while Trump racks up 150k+ Covid deaths. When mass homelessness is around the corner, corporations racking up benefits while families starve.   And this is just the past 4 months.   But please, get your jokes off.
Absolutely...there‚Äôs no way out for him, Biden, Wray, Comey, etc...
So the author of the crime bill will be running for President with a cop as his running mate...  You can‚Äôt make this shit up.   The Democrats will never learn.   #BidenHarris #Biden #KamalaHarrisForVP
My daughter (21) has said she doesn't want a Biden sticker on our car. üôÑ Little does she know, I was just waiting for the #BidenHarris stickers to become available. Ordered one today. ü§£ü§£ü§£ (Yes, she's voting for them.)
Third, she‚Äôs qualified and competent for the position, and will be a good leader if Biden has to step down for something like a medical issue. Finally, it‚Äôs depressing that people continue to try and divide us, on the left and the right. What we need is unity, not division.
It pisses me off that people are saying ‚ÄúKamala‚Äôs bad bc she‚Äôs a cop!‚Äù First of all, she was a prosecutor, and prosecuted people according to the laws in place. Secondly, nominating her damaged the Trump argument that Biden‚Äôs soft on crime and will let antifa destroy cities. 1/2
It‚Äôd be pretty sweet if Biden took office, appointed Anita Hill to the Supreme Court, and then resigned. I can dream
Bernie has decided that beating Trump is the priority despite Biden &amp; now cop Kamala Harris being the alternative. And because of this, so many of his supporters are understandably angree with him, as if he's abandoned the movement.
Dem establishment even threw the me too movement under the bus by picking someone that can rival Trump's misogyny. Joe Biden is such a terrible candidate, worse than Hilary Clinton.   All of this because they'd rather cater to their wealthy donors than actually change the world.
Biden is obviously anti-yo-semitic, too.
Biden/Harris 2020: Extraordinarily Nasty to Assholes  That might make for a pretty good t-shirtTell me exactly what you think Pelosi has the power to do? Everything humanly possible has already been done. It's time to stop whining and get out the vote and  contribute to the Biden campaign.
Apparently Biden Harris campaign only cares about the black vote! According to the ads they have done everything for the black people nothing for any other race
Did Biden type this?
Jews across America &amp; the world will be far less safe in a 2nd Trump term. I‚Äôll take Biden-Harris &amp; the Constitution over your corrupt, criminal conduct &amp; shameless support for racism &amp; discrimination.
Joe Biden Asshole song  via
He is currently relevant in several countries for his employment at Burisma. Investigations are ongoing.  Former President Joe quid pro quoed is charged w/ high treason. Ukraine prosecutors played audio tapes that included convos between President of Ukraine and VP Biden.
From an Americanized Canadian in the middle of it all:  what you may not understand is the Pelosi, Biden, Harris all want the exact same thing Trump wants. They‚Äôre all in the same club and are acting out the same ‚Äúplan‚Äù. It‚Äôs a lose-lose situation down here.
Is Biden also pledging his presidential salary? He's been in office 40 years.

I was wondering the same thing. Black women were going to vote for Biden regardless.
So you would rather have Biden/Harris and the rest of the Democrat (Socialist/Communist) party destroy our Republic as they have been planning for the past 60 years?
First of all, your vocabulary needs work Mike. Second, Harris is no role model. She put hundreds of thousands of black Americans in prison for very minor crimes or no crimes at all. She is the ancestor of slave owners. She accused Biden of rape, now she loves him. Surely you jest
If we are firing the liar the only people we will be firing is Biden and Harris.  Get used to it Princess,  we WILL re-elect POTUS and we WILL change congress to all RED.  We will NOT allow this country to go Socialist!

Dementia Joe Beijing Biden has been confused most of his life and on the wrong side of most major decisions. So where does he get the idea he would make a great President?? Even Barack told him to leave it alone...
She is not eligible to be President. She is an anchor baby. She cannot replace  Biden.
Even few of my social media friends who are conservative are so mad about her... it‚Äôs strange because they didn‚Äôt say anything about Biden to my face. Honestly, if they got mad then it‚Äôs absolutely total nightmare for them.   Not my problem.   We go forward together.
I‚Äôm not gonna lie. I‚Äôm definitely one of those people who are questioning Biden/Harris üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ but I refuse to vote for trump so it‚Äôs really no choice, we fucked either way. Might as well be fucked w/ Biden. It‚Äôs still just bullshit to think about ü§£

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris: The Most Pro-Abortion Ticket in American History
No, I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to have the decency to congratulate the new president.  He would feel belittled, embarrassed and humiliated standing behind Biden at inauguration.  More likely to have a Twitter kniption fit from Florida on Inauguration Day.
Biden reportedly mocked for using script to tap Kamala Harris as his running mate. Ohh the scandal. A piece of paper near the laptop. Where is the FBI? Where is the investigation?
And you said Biden has a racism problem ??
Biden/Harris is the anti-black male ticket!
Don‚Äôt know , I do know that the Dem voters didn‚Äôt like her and she was forced out of the race. I do know she was picked primarily cause she is black. I do know Biden is running, so nothing has changed.
Thank you for your voice of reason. Most people don't know that Biden and Harris have done more harm for Black Americans than many in recent history. They are directly responsible for putting hundreds of thousands of them in prison, many for very long sentences
"Running to replace a president who has celebrated incompetence and elevated incompetents, Mr. Biden needed to choose a running mate who respects public service and has served well. In Sen. Kamala Harris, he has found such a partner.  - Washington Post Editorial Board
Incorrect.  Biden will be her puppet. Therefore, yes she can. But it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs just her decision, but she would have major influence especially if Dems win Congress.
Unable to breathe with so much pride and hope! GOD bless Biden/Harris, and deliver us from the evil that is donald j. trump
Betsy gonna fuck over kids in 4 more years bro..like hardcore fuck over kids that‚Äôs why i gotta ride with Biden bum ass

Trump literally has nothing on Biden anymore as long as shit don‚Äôt improve lol
CNN reporter calls Biden's Harris pick 'big risk,' says American culture 'primed' to be racist and sexist    So let me get this straight- if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden then your a racist and/or a sexist...it‚Äôs so played out and old and tiring.
No Princess, but the truth hurts, dosnt it?   I suggest you go watch ‚ÄúAgenda‚Äù. It‚Äôs on Amazon Prime right now.  It will give you a whole new perspective on the Obama/Biden WH.
At pretty much every key political juncture in the last five years, Warren has made the wrong decision, and she has paid dearly for these mistakes. (For that reason alone, I'm glad she's not on the ticket with Biden ‚Äì I've seen enough of her political skills.)   4/6
(4) ham-fistedly attacking Sanders for being a sexist; (5) breaking her own pledge not to accept Super PAC money; (6) withholding an endorsement of Sanders in the hope of earning influence and/or VP spot with Biden.  3/6

Trump 'surprised' Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate  via
You can‚Äôt be serious a fearless fighter for the little guys I know you‚Äôre not writing this your campaign team is specially at 4 o‚Äôclock in the morning when Joe Biden is sleeping. Hell she put more people in jail and is a true leftist.
Wasn‚Äôt kamela Harris callin Biden a closet racist now they running mates the dems got this puppet runnin all different directions
This sums up Democratic voters who are ‚Äúhappy‚Äù about Kamala or just confident Biden can win in general   ‚ÄúWHAT!? He chose a literal pretzel? Oh my god! The progressiveness. The pure genius. We got this boys and girls! Trump is going down! REVOLUTION‚Äù
Biden picked a running mate That‚Äôs a gift to you.
America is extremely racist + sexist. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm worried for this Biden campaign. üòì
Agreed...but realistically that‚Äôs what it is...give Biden a count by number puzzle to the side to look busy and keep from interrupting
Here's an inside look at the vetting process that led to Joe Biden picking Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Just remember, not voting Biden/Harris is a vote for Trump
Biden is the gift that keeps  She is a good debater, but nobody will be able to save old Joe.
Biden had no choice.  He knew his background and track record on burying black folks is documented.
Just threw $25 into the Biden/Harris ring. Felt good.
FTR : I was hoping that Biden would pick Susan Rice over Kamala Harris as his VP candidate due to Kamala's record as a prosecutor; HOWEVER, Kamala is his pick. That makes her my pick! I will rally around this sista and embrace her. LFG! #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs been in office for over four decades, so what‚Äôs the point of having him on the ballot anyway?‚Äù
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden‚Äôs history-making pick for vice president
I understand Biden and Harris might not be everyone‚Äôs favorite choice but Trump has to go.
Discipline and having the right number of political vets leading the way. Biden's team actually seems like a well oiled machine all with a common goal. Compared to Bernie's campaign where the major players all had their own agendas and Bernie winning wasn't on the top of the list
Biden and Harris huh? Sigh...i guess...
In 2011  kicked me out of a conversation for asking their guest, someone running for US Congress, if they would change their stance on nuclear energy. Literally, that‚Äôs all I did. Anyways, that‚Äôs how I feel about the Biden Kamala ticket.
To see all these white dudes shitting on #KamalaHarris...you are really disrespecting women of color and EVERYONE sees it #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris #Biden #JoeBiden #RidinWithBiden
If not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump, then by not voting for Trump I'm actually voting for Biden. Or is it that I'm voting twice by not voting for either?
Over 160,000 Americans are dead under the watch of Trump &amp; Pence. I‚Äôll take Biden &amp; Harris ANY DAY

When Biden picked Kamala, Trump pissed his Pence. #BidenHarris
Voting for Biden is going to hurt me to the core but it‚Äôs what we gotta do üò≠üíî #JesusFixIt
President Trump wasted no time attacking Sen. Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate. But in 2014, he was donating to her political campaign.
my hope is that Biden picked Harris to balance out as there are a fair number of Sander's policies being adapted
Reasons why Kamala Harris is a shit VP pick:  1. California is a safe state for the dems.This was a lost opportunity at gaining an electoral advantage in a battle ground state.  2. While the black community is not a monolith, they already showed in the primary they backed Biden.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the same ticket? What‚Äôs the plan? To see how many black men that they can put in jail for non violent crimes over the course of 4 years?
I don‚Äôt care if you support Trump or Biden or whoever. Be mindful that not everything you see or read online is real.
Oh, I thought this was about Biden picking Harris...
Great News! She will be able to do very ,very well!      Go Biden &amp; Harris ,
November can‚Äôt come soon enough. Biden/Harris
And he still moves quicker than Biden and in the right direction!
honestly, i‚Äôm not sure. which is why i asked my initial question.  at the end of the day, i want niggas to vote for whoever is going to help then sleep at night. but i genuinely don‚Äôt know if i can vote for biden in good faith.
if joseph biden criticism triggers you, you should probably just hit unfollow. we don‚Äôt stan any politicians this way.
The more likely scenario is that Biden will step away from the ticket.
You think she has a cabinet position? I think Biden likes her just lacked major experience . She had a future though . Governor of GA?
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden‚Äôs pick for vice president  via  BUT she's Muslim! Sorry Felicia they need an American for that! WHAT DUMMIES!

Bert .. Come on Man! You were SO easy on Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden pushes back harder than you do ‚ÄúREALLY BRET‚Äù
Senator Kamala Harris is a great choice by Vice President Biden for his running mate. She is an enthusiastic and inspiring public servant who fights for justice and equality. I am ready to work so that we can see this ticket succeed in November.
Just like how Biden isn't Senator Klobuchar, Senator Harris is also not Senator Klobuchar and that little bit of positivity might not seem like much to you, but it means a lot to me. Knowing she won't have power helps when times get hard.
I know!! I keep having to stop myself from (good) crying! I feel so proud of Biden‚Äôs choice; I was hoping he would choose Harris. She‚Äôs gonna make mincemeat of Pence! Can‚Äôt wait for debates!!!
So you're thinking Biden may accidentally fall off the platform at his possible inauguration?
Biden...that‚Äôs was a mistake üòï
kid‚Äôs were in cages under obama &amp; biden, joe biden literally said if you don‚Äôt vote for him you‚Äôre not black lmao (but also idk why ‚Äòovertly‚Äô matters cause racism &amp; sexism are still racism &amp; sexism).
Shortly after #JoeBiden announced Sen. #KamalaHarris would be his running mate in the 2020 presidential election, Twitter lit up with reactions from President Trump, former Pres. Obama, and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. &gt;&gt;&gt;
Black male leaders say Biden will lose election if he doesn't choose Black woman as VP  via
Oh I infinitely prefer her to Biden, which is even in leftist circles a hot take, but when it comes to voting &amp; policy I think she's better than a lot of people who ran.
why do you believe those things? cause biden said so? his track record &amp; words don‚Äôt ever seem to match up
Joe Biden prolly think he all that and a bag of chips...serving as the VP for the first black man, and if he wins...having the first black/female VP......yeah he prolly thinks he‚Äôs all that‚Äôs and a bag of chips.
I'm not excited about Biden but I rather have a boring guy who's competent who knows what he's doing than a failed reality host where everyday there's some bullshit happening in his administration
no different than if biden is elected. like nothing has changed &amp; like there is still a lot of work that needs to be done
Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to be his Vice President. She's a senator from California that I'm not a fan of. I also don't think she will help him win either.
Class act Biden.
This is gonna be a weird fucking election. I can easily vote for Biden &amp; Harris because we live in a system that forces us to make a shitty binary choice, but I get why people can't. That said Pence &amp; Trump actively encourage and reward police-brutality and they've got to go.
I honestly can't imagine what it must be like to be excited by a Biden/Harris ticket. That's not to say that there aren't neat aspects of such a ticket, such as representation (which is valid &amp; legitimately fucking matters), but Harris as the candidate... Yeesh, ya know?
joe biden can talk all he wants to now
am i not allowed to criticize joseph biden?
That's why we need progressives IN the Senate and the House. Because those policies are a lot harder to enact via fiat and because Progressives can watchdog the FUCK out of Harris &amp; Biden. But we need Republicans OUT. And there's only one way to do that in this fucked system.
I remember when I saw that Biden commercial that began by showing a bunch of footage of police brutality and the protests and then ended off by promising a bunch of shit that ain‚Äôt have nothing to do with any of that
You think?! I feel like it‚Äôs so ridiculous when they say ‚Äúthis will be Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù considering this is LITERALLY RIGHT NOW trumps America.
If Biden survives two years I would be amazed
my question is more so, why exactly? how is a biden presidency going to be any different than a trump presidency
Because Pence &amp; Trump ACTIVELY ENCOURAGE the murder of POC by cops. Harris &amp; Biden don't. They just don't. There is a culture in place, politically, that encourages police violence. To BEGIN to dismantle it we kick out Republicans.
So i will say this Kamala got 4 years to win niggas over cause Biden passing the sword to Mayor Pete
So apparently Biden picked Kamala as his VP  #Trump2020
That's actually very touching given Biden's own Job-like personal history.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate    I predicted this!!
Looks like Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP pick is far more important and interesting news than whatever  could possibly lie about today.  #TrumpPreempted
What sold my family on Kamala Harris?  Her proposal to enact one of the largest middle class tax cuts in history.  I hope Biden adopts this platform
why do y‚Äôall want biden to win? honestly, what do y‚Äôall think a biden presidency is going to change?
true, but their breed never goes away. by then they'll likely learn how to dress up their racism and bad policies (while likely becoming somewhat more progressive themselves). mind you, I would not complain about Biden, Harris x2, AOC. somewhere in there M4A should be a reality.
Biden/Harris 2020! So excited for this!
Sooo... how do y‚Äôall feel about Biden‚Äôs running mate?
By voting for Biden &amp; Harris I am in fact voting against change. I know that sucks, but Trump HAS changed shit by making everything WORSE and I am voting against that. If you poison &amp; break things you change them &amp; after 4 years of that shit I'm very decidedly against it.
Lmaoo the one time I manifest some shit it‚Äôs Kamala Harris being Joe Biden‚Äôs VP off a dumbass joke
We won‚Äôt be watching this but will watch Biden‚Äôs VP!!
biden and harris... thats a no for me
I think Biden looked for the one that aligned with his beliefs
If you ever feel bad about the state of the Biden/Harris ticket just go onto right-wing Twitter and pretend that their "attacks" on the ticket were actually true. I wish we had a ticket that was 1/10th as rad as right-wingers pretend it was.
Take over when Biden's dementia advances further.
Of course! You're absolutely right, Phil! I'll be supporting the Biden-Harris ticket but I do wish it were different.
Biden plays it safe
Look I HATE Biden far more than almost any of my friends do. It's the sort of hate that's hard to articulate. But if Trump wins, not only does nothing change, but he can keep attacking abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, &amp; education. Biden is inarguably less bad than Trump.
Round 2 for  (alongside Iron Biden?)
But way worse since Biden and Harris have literally all the same problems Clinton had but times ten
Why not?  Trump and Biden are working for the same people.  No one is more qualified.  It is time.  It doesn't matter who wins.  Populism is on the rise, which will include voters from both parties.
There were probably a dozen better people for Biden to pick tbh.
Stfuuuuu. Is that all you can say?  Biden chose a good woman. These two will make a strong pair.  Stop trying to bring racism and lies into something that will definitely better this upside down country. #BidenHarris2020 #Biden2020
This will be Trump's first time in front of reporters since Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate and the Big Ten and Pac-12 postponed fall football.
Although you were my CLEAR FAVORITE, I am excited for Kamala. I know Biden is smart enough to have you in a huge leadership position in his cabinet.
Trump been putting in OT man I‚Äôm shook he may get a second term. Every YouTube video I‚Äôve watched for 2 weeks got double ads of that Biden one

Also, there are legitimately worse choices Biden could have picked. Peeps like Buttigieg &amp; Bloomberg would have definitely been worse than Senator Harris. I'm as unhappy about it as I thought I'd be about it, but this was a long &amp; drawn-out primary with lots of bad candidates.
Kamala Harris "considers herself a Black Baptist" and more about her religious upbringing and perspective.

I don't like Kamala Harris. She was literally the only woman I was hoping Biden didn't pick. That being said, she is giant improvement from the wet noodle VP we have now.
So was Harris my first choice, no. Is she awesome and amazing and will she make a great VP, absolutely! Whomever you wanted as the Dems P or VP candidate, doesn‚Äôt matter. The past is the past. Now we buckle down and support the Biden/Harris ticket all the way!
I don't particularly like Senator Harris, but there are definitely worse choices than her. Like Biden. And I'm sure some of us were afraid Biden would tap Biden for VP so I mean this is definitely not the worst outcome possible.

Current chances Biden names his "Losing Mate" today 100% Chance its a woman 100% Chance she will be Black 100% Possibility he will lose 100% Moral is: "He who takes Black voters for granted gets hiss Ass served to him on a platter"
If the biggest story media is slobbering over is who will be Biden's losing mate, we are in serious trouble. Who gives a s...!
Joe Biden has pledged to select a woman and has conducted an expansive search, including Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
The thing that CNN correspondents are not mentioning is that Biden would be a one term President and because of that his running mate could be the first black female President elected in 2024.
A vote for Biden is a sign of stupidity.

Finally president joe Biden makes the announcement we've all waited for.
You all know deep in your hearts that neither Biden nor Trump could handle the grind of an SEC schedule.
Why does media think anyone even cares who Joe Biden picks as "The second loser" for his failing mate?
Uh, oh... Trump, referring to Biden's decision to consider only female candidates: ‚ÄúSome people would say that men are insulted by that. And some people would say it's fine. I don't know." He added that the VP pick ultimately won't matter because "people don't vote for the VP.‚Äù
The majority of the people who are voting for Joe Biden are not voting for Joe Biden. They are voting against President Trump. They are suffering from TDS.

Long week already. Every damn day feels that way to me. I‚Äôm ready for the election &amp; to be rid of this toxic POTUS &amp; Senate. I fear everyday until then is going to be exhausting! Of course, there are the 1st three months after Biden wins that we will have to contend with! Jeesh!
Yes Biden +8 is great news! For Trump! Somehow! Or something! (Ps we don‚Äôt look at single polls, we look at averages. Try again and harder.)
The panel that vetted the potential VP picks has essentially disbanded, so it's now in Biden's hands, according to one report.
Both your idiocy and TDS are showing. Only Biden is in a bunker, and has been for months.
Makes me sick to my stomach to see this. If Joe Biden becomes president it would be like this nationwide

How can we get you to understand what is at stake. Clinton started outsourcing, Bush added on, Obama tried to seal the deal. We are fighting for our survival. Free trade was never free to us. Biden already promised a 3 trillion dollars tax increase.
You are right, the thing about this election is global vs protectionists. If Democrats and Biden win American will be on the decline and at warp speed. That is why this on is so important. The only way to support the global agenda is to decrease America

Biden can't let Trump slide for the good of the country. If Trump gets away with his treasonous corruption, what's to stop the guy. If anything, this has taught us that the president has too much power.

That is everything about the whole Democrats body. They insist on judging everyone by race then act all sanctimonious about people being judged based on race. Biden just said all blacks are alike, so why did he even pick her as if we didn't know
Trump has secret police on the streets, I'll kill the roaches and take my chances with Biden.

Tokens we have seen but this level of tokenism, never. What about his sexual assault victim Kamala said she believes? What about Biden saying blacks aren't diverse or has no independent thoughts? This case of tokenism has never been tried before
I ask this bc in addition 2 directly deporting millions of immigrants back 2 areas w/high sex trafficking  There is this effect from what Pres Obama called "his biggest mistake"   So how can 1 vote 4 that legacy
Well that story must be fake because I remember hearing Biden saw out his own mouth he was smarter than most, at the top of his law class and basically a genius. Oh my bag, he was just a great liar.
No I think voting for Biden Harris is an not the son of a hood wearing klansmen
Maybe the POTUS (it sure as hell won‚Äôt be Biden) should eradicate these animals that perpetuate this kind of violence?!?
Another argument here is that non American citizens who will die under Biden will die under Trump too. I think this one mostly comes down to an ignorance about current, ongoing American imperialism. It also suggests not voting for Biden is actually, materially, a vote for Trump.
Sure isn't, Donald Trump is quick on his feet and has real world business experience. Biden is a braindead government leach who couldn't negotiate his way out a paper bag and Harris is suck a suck up, that she actually sucks up
Reminder that Joe Biden's campaign pushed people to vote at the polls during the primary, during a pandemic.
While in the same breath claiming a moral need to vote for Biden on behalf of non citizen immigrants!
People will say you must vote for him on behalf of people more marginalized than yourself. And if you bring up the many, many people who will die, directly, due to a Biden presidency, they will discount them entirely on the basis of them not being American citizens.
I didn't mean that Biden is worse than Trump. I mean the guy in 2024 who no one can possibly imagine now.
Tokens are back inüòÇüòÇüòÖ Did everyone forget that Biden just said blacks don't think for themselves?
A racist, sexual assaulting con man? Are we talking about Biden or Trump, because they both qualify for that statement.

Trump‚Äôs win of the black vote in 2020 will probably be higher than 2016.  I think the 8% will increase to 11-12%.  So that means Biden‚Äôs advantage of black vote is approximately 70%.

I'm honestly just like.... how tf did we come up with Biden and Trump as our two "best" presidential candidates. Like..... actually fucking how?!?!?!?!
Consider a vote for Biden is a vote against a perceived mandate on racism, xenophobia, sexism, and dismantling of necessary institutions. One need not like Biden to see the significant benefit of explicitly voting for him.
FiveThirtyEight runs some weird simulations sometimes.  They actually have one simulation where Biden wins Alabama by 9. Like... seriously?

I've never liked Biden. He wasn't my first, second, third, or tenth choice. Doesn't matter. There's no room for indifference when it comes to U.S. policy being crafted by the likes of Stephen Miller. Pretending there's no difference is as petulant and privileged as you can get.

We definitely won't be putting in the work for Biden/Harris ticket, if y'all have such work ethic it should be an easy W against the worst President in modern history.
Biden/Harris have an immigration policy, not just open borders, just not racist views and created hysteria as fodder for the uneducated Trumpers. Trump/Pence just sow division and fear with this packaged BS to stoke anger.
I didn‚Äôt know Biden had an abortion, wow. And Harris? So you‚Äôll protect an unborn fetus by telling a woman what to do with her body, while allowing access to assault weapons that kill dozens of innocent school children in seconds? Open borders to enhance trafficking? Try again.

The key word there is "try". Biden/Harris will absolutely try to do things we don't like, but anything big like that done without broad bipartisan support will either provoke an electoral backlash or be tied up in court for years. Probably both.
This has to be the last election like this. Our democracy can't take much more without splitting at the seams. The FIRST order of business for the Biden Administration should be the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.

Trump voters wouldn't see anything wrong with this, since they've been fed that Hillary did it in 2016. Is very likely that one month into election Trump will suggest that Biden, Gates, China and Yogi the bear are trying to rig the elections.
I disagree. The reason we've arrived at Trump is because this exact thing has been said before about, Obama, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Reagan, Ford, Carter, etc. This is part of a race to the bottom. Do you really like Biden?  It won't end until there's more choices.

If Pence, Biden and Trump aren't showing birth certificates then neither is Harris. In fact as long as you are questioning  about anything other than her policies then you are not to call her by her first name. She is not your friend.

I noticed comma,la didn't bother to mention how Obama/Biden totally blew the H1N1 which was a pandemic not an outbreak like Ebola. 60 million people got H1N1&amp; they stopped testing because the numbers were so high. Over 16,000 people died. They only tell half truths that help them
Lotta black ppl think this concept is so far fetched, but Latinos have BEEN doing this. Both parties know that the Latino vote could go either way so they actually attempt to EARN their vote EVERY election. But like Biden said black ppl ain‚Äôt ‚ÄúDIVERSE‚Äù in their way of thinking.
If black people withheld their votes this election instead of just giving it to Biden, we would essentially be free agents in 2024. Do y‚Äôall understand how much leverage we would have politically, both sides of the aisle would do everything they could to try an earn our vote.
No, it‚Äôs Harris and ? Because Biden will be thrown out before the election

Hey, Democrats. I have heard the new Biden ads, in which he says that everyone has a right to be treated with dignity. Considering what he and Harris plan for preborn children, someone should explain to him what dignity means.

Standard politics that is part of any primary‚ÄîClinton &amp; Obama got pretty nasty with each other in 2008 and yet they worked well together for four years. Part of what made Biden look bad in Dem debates was his relutance to really go on the attack like that.
What is most likely to happen on Election Day or maybe Election week at this rate.  Trump will have huge leads of 10+ points in all the swing states and even be leading or close in solid blue states.  Then as the night goes on and week goes on Biden will slowly come back.
Several reasons: 1. Trump is a fascist destroying our norms and seeking to rig the election in his favor by hobbling the USPS 2. Biden-Harris are two of the most compassionate people in politics 3. They are running on a great platform designed to help working folks succeed

I‚Äôm sure a small percentage of Bernie supporters being insensitive after the SC primary outweighs the racism of Joe Biden‚Äôs support for school segregation in the 70s, welfare cuts and mass incarceration in the 90s, and murdering a million Arabs in Iraq in the 00s.
Kamala went toe to toe with Joe, confronted him, stood her ground, and asked the tough questions. Biden didn‚Äôt take it as an insult or disrespect. Biden saw her for the strong woman she is and he picked her for that quality. It takes a real man to do that. #TrumpIsLosing

I'm not being racist. What I said is truth. Biden said he would choose his VP based on gender and race. He didn't say he chose Kamala for her policy. They don't even agree on policy. Why? To get the black vote. They count on your vote because it's the only way to win.

I can't think of a single good reason to vote for Trump.  But if the best reason you can find to vote for Biden is his VP pick, then you shouldn't be voting for him either.  This election more than any other I've seen yet would be a great opportunity to give rise to a 3rd party.

Tax cut isn't touching social security. Do remember how hard it was to get a good job under Obama? More taxes and regulations mean fewer good paying jobs. Plus Biden isn't going to protect people. He supports defunding the police and getting rid of the 2nd amendment.
Y‚Äôall want a debate hack that will win Biden the presidency. He just needs ONE line where he looks at Trump and says ‚ÄúMr. President, it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a fucking asshole‚Äù on live television.

Really it comes down to money. I will have more money if Trumps President. Democrats will take my money if they get into the White House. Biden already said he was going to raise taxes.
Here's your savior of single payer:
This is true... Many folks feared Kamala on the top of the ticket to be attacked by racist Trump. Joe that felt was a safer bet to lead as we have seen they were right Trump is struggling to hurt Biden, they did not want Kamala to take that direct fire. But want her on the ticket
Biden reads?
This is so wrong.  Nobody buys this crap anymore.  The Democrats are as corrupt as the GOP half of the duopoly.  Biden "I will veto M4A if it comes across my desk" is no progressive.  But you already know that, and this is just mindfukery from the duopoly.

You know how crackers handle injustice? We don't vote for race, we vote for policy. Just like blacks will vote for Biden/Harris but they helped mass incarcerate blacks. Instead of being used by politicians, why not try something different.
You know, your biggest problem is that it always has to be about you. ‚ÄúI did this, I did that.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sold on Biden, but at least he picked someone who calls out his weakness to make him stronger. All you want are ‚Äòyes (wo)men‚Äô. You fire someone the second they disagree w/ you.

This woman is beyond nuts......it‚Äôs time for you to retire, get some help, and enjoy your life   Why would you suggest that something is going to happen to Joe Biden. Was that a threat?
In the last of four proposals, Biden's "build back better" earmarks $775 billion to the "caring economy" over the next decade.   His plan also includes enhancing infrastructure and tackling climate change.
Maybe the first thing Biden should do if elected is tell everyone that comes forward, that any NDA signed with trump is void, presidential pardons all around. I wonder how many thousands would speak. Also I wish the extra debate Trump wanted could be against Harris.
University of Pennsylvania's  researchers estimate [Biden‚Äôs tax plan] would raise between $2.3 - $2.6 trillion. That‚Äôs $600 billion less than what Biden wanted.  The study also estimates it would decrease economic growth by 0.1 percent by 2030.
This is not a wash. Biden/Harris will not end healthcare. They will not ruin medicaid/ social security. They will not gut the post office. There will be better plans for saving the environment. A national response to coronavirus.   I think there are issues with the ticket.

In what may go down as one of the worst vice-presidential picks in US history, Joe #Biden announced that he has chosen #Kamala_Harris to be his #running_mate for the 2020 presidential election.  Harris is exactly the opposite of what Biden needs.
Unlike Trump who is an insecure baby bully, Biden can handle--even invites--being challenged on his opinions. Biden welcomes the perspective of a "Nasty Woman."
Right now, if I‚Äôm being honest, I do want Biden/Harris to win cuz, dang 45 is literally killing us.  I need normal again and sleep! But, I‚Äôm on the fence w donations and such. I‚Äôm a progressive. I‚Äôm also old.  Maybe 2024 - if it doesn‚Äôt happen then -I‚Äôm out.

Biden looks to be in AMAZING shape in that clip! How was the ramp to get into the train?
These are the kind of men y‚Äôall are mad at Kamala and Biden for though üôÑ
Cleary, the LONG delay in selecting Harris was caused by big changes in the political calculus after Biden and his Democrat race-bait tag team, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, spent the last 10 weeks fomenting race riots in their Demo-controlled urban centers nationwide.1/2

Joe Biden and the Democratic apparatus are jokes to our country.
not even close to Johnson. Also left leaning people or progressives have brain damage if they would vote for Jorgensen over Biden. They would literally be voting against what they believe in.
Biden calls the President travel restrictions xenophobic. It took a while for DAF Joe to catch up.
This is such a lie, the timings don't match up at all, also Biden doesn't support private prisons and wants to eliminate them..... and guess what, so does Harris
so thing is our age group usually voted heavily in favor of Democrats, that won't change this year.  Last time Gary Johnson and Jill Stein got a lot of votes, that won't happen this time.  There are very poor 3rd party candidates this time around so Biden will get more of that
Biden straight up poking Putin with a hot poker. With an extra dash of subtext just for Trump.  #maddow
So def not voting for Biden.

PERIODT this whole presidential race is a fucking joke. Kamala is trumps puppet and Biden is the Democrats.
I‚Äôve got v mixed feelings wrt polls showing VBM votes going for Biden while in-person votes go for Trump w/o context that in all prior years VBM had no partisan divide. Gotta add consideration that this is all Trump‚Äôs rhetoric! Otherwise we‚Äôre fuling Trump conspiracy. #Inners
If Joe Biden Speaks about anything, it is to build confidence in every American Child above the age of 5. That they are already intellectually developed beyond the level of a Democrat Presidential Candidate. And therefore they can accomplish anything if they so choose.
I will never understand not voting. I get if someone doesn‚Äôt want to vote for a Biden or Trump. But just not vote at all?  It‚Äôs much more fun bitching about politicians when you vote. Whether you voted for the topic of your bitching or not, hahahah.
It's kind of weird after Harris called Biden a racist AND said she believed the women who alleged sexual misconduct against him.
If you‚Äôre pissed because Biden didn‚Äôt choose Warren and now are voting green; you‚Äôre not progressive

Biden worked to cut Social Security through the addition of Chained CPI as recently as 2014.  I know you remember that Bernie because you were the one that lead the effort to stop him.  Biden is no savior of Social Security.
Definitely no lights on in Biden‚Äôs campaign, that‚Äôs for sure.
I‚Äôve been partially with you as I see Biden constantly being battered with  lies. But now I‚Äôve decided Joe should bring back Reagan‚Äôs refrain of ‚Äúthere you go again‚Äù in response to each and every lie. Over and over.

Who? I have never been so focused on voting. Time to put the drama to bed. I'm psyched about Biden-Harris.
Biden needs these votes in crucial swing states. For the left, the Biden/Harris combo is the worst possible combination of candidates. A moderate who worked with Obama and a "cop."  It's not that Harris is a bad politician. In fact, she's great, and that's why she is despised.
So anytime a white person says they are ok voting r Biden retweet that w/ a link to any1 of these stories from liberal to ultra-liberal publications. Ain't the internet great! Just take your pick
Tom Del Beccaro: Kamala Harris, Biden's VP pick, views politics as a game
Oh and Liam let's not forget that VERY UNIQUELY Biden / Obama action that resulted in Africans in chains being sold as slaves. So the Left supports book burning &amp; actions that create modern slavery just like Democrats made the KKK
Right now, the Dems are heavily split between those that supported a moderate candidate and those that support more radical change (2/3 to 1/3) while the Repubs are staunchly united behind Trump.   In places like MI, WI, and PA, this apathy amongst the far-left could hurt Biden

I am an Independent &amp; I cannot understand why they have Biden. &amp; Now Kamala!   Liz Warren would have rocked!   They missed it!!!
The biggest similarity between Joe and Trump is that they both say stupid things.  The difference is that Biden says he ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt mean it that way‚Äô, whereas Trump says ‚Äòand?‚Äô.  #OwnIt
A District Authority‚Äôs job is to put people in jail. Period!  What are we even arguing about? It‚Äôs only 2 choices. Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris.  We see where Trump has gotten us. Let‚Äôs move forward in Nov. and if you want to fix the political system focus on your local elections
Also Biden has hated on minorities throughout his entire political career that's why he wrote the 94 crime bill to make sure his kids wouldn't have to grow up in an urban jungle. He also agreed with hilary when she said black people are super predators. #votefreedom

Unfortunately as long as people think this way by voting for the ‚Äúlesser of 2 evils‚Äù or to ‚Äúget that person out of office‚Äù we will never end the duopoly. Vote on your principles. If Teump still wins then you voted Biden for nothing. Jo needs the support for now and the future.
Haha! Excellent campaign ad for Biden!üòÇ
And don‚Äôt you dare ask about his health and mental faculties. Those are out of bounds topics, just not for Reagan, McCain, &amp; Trump, all of whom were younger than Biden is now when they ran for office, including Reagan‚Äôs second term.
Yes. I thought it was pretty wierd she left early. But it was paving Biden path in retrospect. In fact the numbers of candidates made it easier to juke and jive to make sure Biden got the nomination. That's why so many. If you think about it the Dem voters were used.

Current chances Biden names his "Losing Mate" today 100% Chance its a woman 100% Chance she will be Black 100% Possibility he will lose 100% Moral is: "He who takes Black voters for granted gets hiss Ass served to him on a platter"
If the biggest story media is slobbering over is who will be Biden's losing mate, we are in serious trouble. Who gives a s...!
Why does media think anyone even cares who Joe Biden picks as "The second loser" for his failing mate?
Well that‚Äôs a lie, person who tweeted this that isn‚Äôt Joe BidenüòÇ
I am in an argument about how the USA will be taxed to death if Biden wins.  Well probably because you can‚Äôt  spend millions on a wall, billions on a vaccine and not put that money back with some kind of tax. The money Trump keeps spending is the money we give the government
Both your idiocy and TDS are showing. Only Biden is in a bunker, and has been for months.
More messages from J Biden today.

It pisses me off to no end, too,  Watching  on slight delay. We need to have her back whomever Joe Biden selects as a running mate and eliminate sexism in covering the VP candidate. Make media accountable on sexism as we are on racism. #HaveHerBack

If Biden chooses Whitmer for VP I would be happy. I like Kamala and her equally. If black folks will only vote for a black person, we deserve Trump. I voted for Obama, my favorite politician and someone I admire greatly, I‚Äôm white.   #vote #Biden2020
To all the black Twitter activists, I applaud your enthusiasm for the 2020 election. I do however wanna caution you against trashing Biden for things 30+ years ago. It is white folks like me who are out here speaking for you. Trump hurts you far more than he does me.   #Biden2020

At least she is 1/1025 Native American, so Biden could say he has a woman of color as his VP pick.
I guess that takes her out of Biden's list of VP candidates! Can't have a depressed VP along with an early dementia President.

Ok, I‚Äôll admit it. I‚Äôm a Trump supporter! I don‚Äôt always agree with him. The one I do not like is jokes about Biden‚Äôs mental state. He could be facing something that he has no control over...dementia. That‚Äôs no laughing matter. It is a praying matter though!

it matters not what you present to hurt  Biden. If you expect ANY BIDEN FOLLOWER to re-think their choice and get on board with Trump, then you need a better candidate. We see Trump with all his frailties and he just does not measure up. Not going to happen!!

Biden thought he was running for senate and said we should reelect Trump. Then mispronounced Kamalas name in their first outing just as the MSM was expressing outrage about tucker doing it.
not if trump is directing postal employees to throw the ballots in the trash as maddow stated last night on her show. no ballots. no vote for biden. trump wins
Dude Reggie! Biden is an exceptional racist lots of game tape on this one. And that‚Äôs not an all Presidents comment. You can find lots of reasons to not vote for Trump but to say one is because Biden is not racist means your not paying attention
Joe Louis' trainer, "Chappie" Blackburn, once told the up and coming Brown Bomber "When you get into the ring, let your fists be the referee," meaning don't let it be close, because white people will rig the rules. The same applies to Biden/Harris now. If it's close, they lost.
That was awesome! One of those great moments from Tucker. Nothing from MSM about Biden's pronunciation. The hypocrisy of the left on display yet again.
Four years of neglect, unilateralism, and failed diplomacy have left America‚Äôs alliances in tatters. It‚Äôs time to rebuild them.
so if it was the other way around you would then vote for biden? like you care about children cause if you did you would be screaming about this hollywood pedo ring that is being brought down cause the MSM isnt talking about it
Even more reason to vote for Biden
The #ShitholePresident did not build a great economy, he inherited a good economy from Obama/Biden and then the #GOPTaxScam goosed it further with massive debt and deficits. As usual, it will take a Democratic admin to correct the situation.

That is such total utter BS. Biden is probably the most devote church goer in politics. He has never tried to take guns or support any such legislation, limit them yes,put restrictions yes but never to take away. He supports the police.

In addition, Biden was responsible for a provision in the 1986 crack law which came to be viewed as one of the most racially slanted sentencing policies on record: a rule that treated crack cocaine as significantly worse than powder cocaine and ended...(1/2)
1994 crime law, which Biden helped author when he was a senator, incentivized local police departments to lock up as many black people as possible, creating¬†mass incarceration¬†of African Americans, along with more prison cells and more aggressive policing.
Word is Trump plans to drop Pence from the ticket and add both Diamond and Silk to be more competitive against the Biden/Harris ticket.  #LincolnProject

5 Takeaways On The New Biden-Harris Presidential Ticket
I will vote for Biden/Harris, but I can't support the ticket with my time or money. Harris has a terrible record, she's an unprincipled opportunist who doesn't care about the needs of the poor.
Ast night you said what if Biden is faking his dementia.  He is.  This way when he gets accused for Ukraine and indicted, he "wont be mentally fit to stand trial" and he cant throw people under the bus.
Although I have issues with the ticket itself I will absolutely still vote for Biden and Harris. But if you know anything about her being AG for California she put a lot of black and brown people in prison and the effects it had on the black family was devastating.

Biden's VP pick: Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots
She‚Äôs a great pick.   My issue was with how the Biden campaign seemed to have narrowed the search to only black women, and did it to try and raise them up like they needed any help.   It‚Äôs become clear however, that women were the only viable options to be the next VP.
She is. She would‚Äôve been my pick too.   My point was that it seemed the Biden Team narrowed the search to a black female only.   It has been brought to my attention that there were no viable candidates that didn‚Äôt fit that description.
At least he did something Biden proved he wouldn't have dont that with his false accusations. Now you act like he has a magic wand when he just said he'd keep Fauci and more of the same that Trump is doing.
I don‚Äôt think that. I think she is the best choice, and gives him the best chance to win (I‚Äôd like to hear who you would‚Äôve picked). I am happy to see that a women of color was picked. But I thought it was clear that the Biden campaign was only picking a VP that was a female.

This week's #CandidateSpotlight was going to feature only one candidate. BUT with the big news released today, we have decided to include two!  Introducing our candidate for President of the United States, Joe Biden, and his choice for Vice President, Kamala Harris!
Watch Trump dump Pence and name Nikki Haley as his running mate just so he‚Äôs not outdone by Biden!

So she believes Biden‚Äôs sexual accusers but that‚Äôs not important now.
Michelle #1. Kamala #2. Both are phenomenal women. Biden did the right thing at the best time for the best available black woman. Kamala bout to give them hell after they win.
I love her and Biden.  Let‚Äôs vote them both in!
They want to taste power so bad they dont care to destroy the people they are supposed to be working for.  More lies are coming out daily from the Biden obama campaign and where are you on that?
Voting for Biden/Harris not matter what.ü¶ã
Record homelessness is in the democrat ran cities and was increased more during Biden and Obama's eight years.  Covid death records also set in democrat cities. You have no tally of all of the president's lies and certainly dont care to remember Bidens because its 2020 right?
The recession didn't recover under Biden it came back with Trump before Covid hit we had the best numbers across the race spectrum of jobs. Covid killed those people and Biden called trump racist for banning travel for three months before admitting it was the right move.
I don‚Äôt care if you support Trump or Biden or whoever. Be mindful that not everything you see or read online is real.
Ok, I‚Äôm all in. 100%. Biden-Harris!!!
Just need this with her attacks against Biden playing on a loop. Tulsi was incredible.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said she believes and respects the women who have come forward alleging that former Vice President Joe Biden touched them without their consent.  via

Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs pathetic the Biden Team chose to select a VP based on the candidate‚Äôs race and gender, not by character or qualifications? If Kamala truly is the best choice, then choose her. Instead they chose to come out and say ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only choosing a black female for VP‚Äù.

At least Biden and Harris don't find it appropriate to vacation at the place Hitler "shared good times and laughs with his compatriots."  I live in NC. If your name shows up on my ballot, it's a definite NO!
What I don‚Äôt understand is if black people where that excited about her. We had the opportunity to vote her in at the top of the ticket. The reason why Biden is at the top of the ticket is Soley because of black people.
Just as afraid as black men and women were when she sentenced them to unfair sentences. Let me hold my nose and vote for Biden and Harris. But don‚Äôt act like we have overcome. When we still fighting the cops. And we just picked a cop for VP.
either vote for Biden or deal with trump for 4 more years. now stfu.

Trump, Biden and kamala Harris man we are fucked regardless
Interesting choice by Biden. Kamala Harris seems to be an elitist. "The California Democrat and her spouse, lawyer Douglas Emhoff, reported about $1.9 million in adjusted gross income for last year, according to tax returns released earlier this year."
Biden was a slimy oft pres candidate when Obamessiah picked him. Slumping for go pick is their thing apparently.
I‚Äôm convinced Joe Biden don‚Äôt even wanna be president for real
Not really as much here as the headline promises: Biden's VP running mate is Sen. Kamala Harris

Biden has selected a Running Mate! #BidenVP
It's looking more like it. Why do you think Biden would pick her over Kamala Harris?
so that's why the only black president in American history chose Joe Biden - give me a break!!
Trump said if Biden wins the Election we will have to learn Chinese.  But if he wins I know we will have to learn Russian and lose our democracy.
Getting mad that Eric Trump used a clip of Robin Williams making fun of Joe Biden? No editing just a clip of a man expressing what he thought of Joe Biden. Just because it doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative doesn‚Äôt make it wrong. If Biden used a dead comedian to bash Trump you‚Äôd be fine.
Pretty sure trump knows hes running for President and not Senate. Pretty sure Trump never said that they had to reelect Biden at his own conference.  Pretty sure Trump didn't say if you aren't voting for him you aren't black and that Latinos are diverse unlike black people.
Even at Trumps worst he's 10x better than Biden you can see past the mold you've been conformed to.
Uh, oh... Trump, referring to Biden's decision to consider only female candidates: ‚ÄúSome people would say that men are insulted by that. And some people would say it's fine. I don't know." He added that the VP pick ultimately won't matter because "people don't vote for the VP.‚Äù
People die every day, it‚Äôs part of life. Your party is the one destroying America but your TDS won‚Äôt let you see it. A vote for Biden is a vote for higher taxes, less jobs and no future.

I've been shouting this since befor Biden got the nomination, it would be awesome if Barack Obama was our VP.... Theres nothing saying it cant happen! Im ready for Nov. Though i hate to see the death toll then....

So your saying he hasn't changed his course of "action" from doing absolutely nothing for the many years hes been a politician, yet somehow if hes elected president he will magically transform? Lying Biden sold you a huge one.
I went on a two week road trip from NC to Washington July 19-August 1. Visited 19 states stayed in Washington 4 days.  Did not see ANY Biden bumper stickers, flags, billboards, or any other Biden campaign advertising the entire trip.  Polls are fake and so is Biden's support.

Then blame the source of the China virus! People should not die of the flu either or car accidents but what are you going to do? You think Biden would have done better when he blamed Trump of being racist when he implemented travel bans?
In case you didn't know,  said he would accuse Obama of meddling in the election if he released information about Russia meddling.

for someone who CLAIMS to be a "conservative".... you have a real funny way of proving it.  can you name ONE thing that biden truly supports that a ACTUAL conservative would ALSO support?  ... or did your "anti-trump" condition cloud your objectivity?

What‚Äôs the best part of having a Republican President.... It gives the Democrats something to do when the Republican is voted out.  With as much as Rump has fu*$ed up it will take Biden 8 years to get it straightened out.

Does the law matter? If there's a question, then it needs to be vetted. If she is disqualified, then she shouldn't be able to run for the office. If qualified, then she runs. What's the problem? Other than Biden's people should have vetted her ALREADY.

Every time I see Biden, he reminds me of what people look like in a casket and it makes me feel uneasy.
Biden moved from Pennsylvania to Delaware when we was 10 and in the third grade. Pretty likely this had something to do with it. Context matters.

Very disappointed in Joe Biden‚Äôs choice of running mate
It‚Äôs amazing that Biden\Trump\Pence\Harris are the best this country has to offer.  What a fucking joke.
I‚Äôm seriously wondering if that‚Äôs not why Biden is saying that. It‚Äôs been proven over and over that they have little to no affect on prevention of the virus.
We may be screwed this next election if this guy is that good
Nobody's expecting Biden (or Trump) to fix all the world's problems. But it sure would be nice to have a President that wasn't actively making more!
I hope this is incorrect! Professor who accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump
Dunno ... tell me  This scared the hell out of me ...
It‚Äôs hilarious that these people think Biden has any clue how to fast track an economic recovery. The first thing he will do is give away Nancy‚Äôs 3 Trillion dollars, then raise taxes by 4 Trillion while a ton of ppl are out of work. He‚Äôll spend the SS money in his first month.
None of them. It‚Äôs all about JoJo!! #JoJorgensen2020 !!!! Voting for Biden or Trump is a vote for old racist sex offending pedophiles!!
I'm watching VP Biden speak abt the virus. What a breath of fresh air! He makes sense, I CAN trust what he says &amp; he's not degrading his apponents by calling them names &amp; acting like a bully. He's acting like an adult &amp; leader. It's like someone we've known has finally come home.
That's great and all but please don't give the Biden administration a pass like you did for the Obama administration. If Trump taught us nothing else it's that when you ignore abuses from your side, they will be doubled down on by the other side.
Obama/Biden: "Listen to scientific experts. Constantly reevaluate options." Trump/Pence: "The FDA is wrong. Listen to the demon-sperm lady. There are only two options: take Hydroxychloroquine or inject yourself with bleach."
Obama/Biden: "Do this." Trump/Pence: "Do the opposite of this."
This country is a mess. As a Conservative, I want a guaranteed, accurate election. In person or absentee with Verified ID. There is too much division and distrust on both sides for any mail in nonsense. And if we LEGITIMATELY elect Biden, then so be it. I‚Äôll do what I have to.
LISTEN. Biden should‚Äôve picked Bernie as his running mate. But I see what they did. Having an African American woman on the ticket is MONUMENTAL, so I‚Äôm not taking anything from her. Trump is going to spend the next 80 days focusing on defining a woman.. &amp; what she should be.
The media really wants me to be excited about the Biden/Harris presidential ticket don't they.
The Catholic Church teaches that ‚Äúdirect abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law,‚Äù and ‚Äúformal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense.‚Äù (CCC 2271-2272)
With Biden &amp; Harris we should expect millions instead of thousands of illegal immigrants.
good interview with Jack Lew this morning.  If Biden wins you think he brings him back to Treasury to tackle this mess? Or consider keeping Mnuchin and allowing him to negotiate without the limitations he clearly has now.
It means Biden is a stooge who they put up because they see him as ‚Äúelectable‚Äù. Then, they slip an in unelected socialist (Heels up) to fast track the socialist agenda that Trump halted. I feel like the voters will see through this obvious trickery and do the right thing though.

Hats off to Biden for making political ads that are actually pro-biden instead of just anti-trump. I still don't like the guy, but I can at least respect that, especially since dissing Trump is so easy.
So funny to roast the only viable option to Trump. Love it. Keep it up. Motivate people to not vote for Biden and get Trump 4 more years
Judge on Fox called for Biden assassination. One time I know what he‚Äôs talking about.
Biden is quite unlikely to be winning Montana. It certainly has a penchant for electing Democratic Senators but hard to see Biden carrying it, unless he's really up 15 points nationally.

Good deal- there‚Äôs one educated voter that won‚Äôt be voting Biden ü§£

Biden must be pulling horribly behind Trump which is why The left is on this full court press about voter fraud all of the sudden.

I just wish Biden didn't look so fragile and senile sometimes.
As an independent I try to get diff. viewpoints. And usually I found u credible. But your article on Harris is nonsensical. No matter who Biden picked R‚Äôs would label her radical..Trump had no qualifications to be Pres. &amp; has proven to be a lying incompetent buffoon
I mean check out the opening paragraph from today's Washington Post story...
While some of y'all are bashing Biden and/or Harris, I just have one question:  What outcome are you trying to bring about? Like, what goal is putting the Dem ticket on blast going to achieve for you?  Because the effect it WILL have is to persuade some people not to vote at all.
Obama said Biden really nailed the pick
I was thinking the same: Biden has a trusted, dedicated staff. No leaking implies they are a team working toward the same goal. A novel concept after 3.5 years of chaos.
She's definitely blowing some energy into the Biden campaign

Biden must win
I see Green2020. Who do you think is more Environment Friendly, Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris?
At the end of the day, if she wanted the job, I want her to have it. And hopefully it will be helpful for whatever she strives for in the future. Hopefully Biden is still around to advocate for whatever that may be...
Your thoughts are always appreciated. I think she‚Äôll bring energy. My brothers were thrilled, 1 is in Utah, the other NM. We have very different politics. I think Biden trusts her judgment, &amp; since we have no idea what‚Äôs up w/him, she may have a large behind the scenes role?
What‚Äôs the bet Biden mistakes a different black woman for Kamala
That‚Äôs a Joe Biden quote.... come on man
Now Biden will have a legitimate stranglehold on SF...without Harris he never would have had that...this is the equivalent of JFK picking LBJ
What is the game here?  Why do they want Trump to win re-election? They never thought Biden was up to the job, and the VP pick only makes the loss more likely.  #WTF
Biden will step down sometime in 2022 immediately after Obama is sworn in as Supreme Court Justice.
üòÇ ‚ÄúCome on man‚Äù Joe Biden
T-rump just killed 150,000 people. Y‚Äôall gonna not vote for Biden and Harris off principle?? Because she was a prosecutor. Our current dictator was a reality star host. What is wrong with y‚Äôall?
How is #KamalaHarris going to walk back the points she made about Biden‚Äùs racist legislation and the fact she said she believed Biden accusers in her savvy debate points?  It strikes me as phony AF now!
Looking up and down my timeline... let me get into it with some of y‚Äôall...   I want it to be clear.   I am voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   I‚Äôm not debating and I‚Äôm not convincing y‚Äôall to switch.   Do you. Be respectful. And let‚Äôs not engage.
Yeah this is the only reason why I‚Äôm not feeling Biden &amp; Harris
Kamala knows about salty replies.   She gave one to Joe biden.  In the debate.
Agree she has so much to answer for. While we are at it Joe Biden I do not forget your years of racist legislation.  What is an Independent to do?
Biden will be 78 if he is inaugurated. Perhaps the VP will be VERY important.
I‚Äôm so sick of Bernie bros continuing to bash Biden and Kamala for not being progressive enough. I get that they aren‚Äôt what you wanted. But damn, they‚Äôre the best hope we have of getting rid of the LITERAL FASCIST in the White House. Get off your high horse and join the fight!
I‚Äôm so excited about this ticket. VP Biden and Senator Harris are fighters - exactly what American families need right now!
I'm excited!  Biden/Harris is a great ticket. üòäüòäüòäüòäüòä

Harris doesn‚Äôt help Biden.  Biden will be destroyed in the debates.
do you think Joe Biden will remember who he picked tomorrow? #Trump2020
I hope we will see you in the Biden Administration. Secretary of State perhaps.
If Biden were elected, and re elected by some God foresaken reason, he will be 85 at the end of his second term. I just realized that. There‚Äôs no way this is possible, so Harris is the real Presidential candidate. Biden is just more ‚Äúelectable‚Äù right now. Sans the dementia....
Right- same goes for Chicago, San Fran, LA, New York and Portland. These douche nozzles get elected over and over and over. I mean, how can a buffoon like Biden get re-elected so many times that he has 50 years in office???
You know I was alright with voting for Biden in November but KAMALA HARRIS FOR VP???? As if 2020 cannot get any worse
A failure in leadership.  Trump MUST GO!  Biden/Harris 2020! #TrumpEvictions #BidenHarris2020

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still do not like Biden. But he has Kamala and I‚Äôd pick Biden over Trump any day.
From now till November 3rd. As you well said, everything will be sexist and racist! And both will supposedly work on behalf of Biden‚Äôs pick! However, Trump is not a PC person. He will find one thousand ways to unmask their radical agenda! Trump 2020!!!
Biden Harris 2020, here we come! üá∫üá∏
I read a tweet the other day that said the moderates got Biden. The progressives should get a more progressive VP. That makes sense to me. I'd be voting for Biden regardless but I am glad he chose someone to FINALLY represent the most reliable voting bloc in the D Party
Congrats!! Can‚Äôt wait to vote for Biden/ Harris!! üíôü•Åüôå
You as usual, a HYPOCRITE &amp; LIAR!  It's Biden not a racist anymore? Lol
Is it bad that I am more excited about Harris as VP than Biden as Prez.  Conventional wisdom is that VP choice doesn‚Äôt change any vote, which is the case for me, But man that boosts voter enthusiasm!!!  I‚Äôm gonna go fantasize about what is gonna b their signature policy GN
Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!! Biden Kamala for the WIN!!!!
I need a Biden/Harris sign STAT!
Ironic the Trump campaign is blasting Kamala over her criticism of Biden. Mike Pence endorsed and voted for Ted Cruz in the Indiana primary.

I don't think Biden ever waivered. I think he always wanted Kamala.
Dont lump all buffons like me with that Biden dude. He is a whole new breed.
üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è - If Biden had handled this process better I think it would be easier for all of us to jump on board, he has put supporters &amp; those in consideration through the ringer. Which is why hopefully others also realize whoever it is isn‚Äôt the bad guy. We need to vote Trump out.
Even if it‚Äôs Charles Manson himself, I‚Äôll vote for Biden and blue all the way. üòÅ
Y'all are spending so much energy on who Biden's running mate will be... He could choose a damn sock and it would be a better president than this clown.
DNC mailed the VP pick to Biden. He didn't choose.  He wants to inform the other losers b4 announcing.
THEY WANT YOU TO KNEEL TO THE NATIONAL ANTHEM &amp; THE AMERICAN FLAG. BUT THEY ALLOW BURNING, LOOTING, &amp; MURDER. THIS IS THE FUTURE OF AMERICA IF BIDEN IS ELECTED
No.  That would only happen if Biden chose a gay man as his running mate.
We already have 8 years of observing Joe Biden in the WH supporting Obama with grace and dignity. And we already have almost 4 years of cringing at your abhorrent behavior in the WH. At this point, 4 debates or 40 debates is not going to change the opinion of any cognizant person
My guess is Susan Rice. Biden has a long personal relationship with her.

Who "loves" kids in cages? Obama and his vp Biden?
As an older moderate black voter, trump has made a mockery of the office.  He does not have my best interest at heart.  If President Obama vetted and trusted Biden for 8 years, that is fine by me !
#45 has said we defended airports during the Revolutionary War &amp; the Spanish Flu probably ended WWII, among other things. Its safe to say his mental acuity is far worse than Joe Biden's.
Isn‚Äôt he up in polls again. Like Biden leading only 6 points?
Keep that same energy on BLM and Biden funding.
Good question. Has to be rebrand as an explicitly anti-Biden network but don't know if it would generate the same interest as a pro-Trump network.Constitution says the President's term ends in January. If he refuses to leave, Biden gets sworn in, and orders the Secret Service to escort him out.
You know it funny. I.n the last several months I‚Äôve not seen hardly any Biden signs. This one way flying at the beach back in May. I drive around the county I live in and the same thing. 95% are Trump signs.

I like what I read about her so far, and I might be voting for her too.  I am so sick of the 2 political party fight that does nothing for this Country but produce mean nasty and disrespectful citizens against one another.  Biden with Kamala is already swinging to fight.
You have to be blind and deaf not to see that Biden who had the chance to bring some possible peace between the Political Parties in finding a better peaceful respectful Candidate who is neutral, instead chose a VP who will continue the Division with nasty fights out here.
Why didn't God tell Biden to pick a better peaceful Candidate to be his VP, somebody who would have helped to unite this Country that desperately needs it.  Kamala is already swinging in directions that will not unite us.  A Sad shame for America.  I am Praying.
This s what bothers me a lot, it's the big division in this Country, thus my disappointment in Biden picking You Mrs. Kamala, because you will not be able to unite this Country, as you are already coming out the gate swinging.  I'm an Independent who is fed up with both sides.

It‚Äôs shameful, to say the least. It is clear the Biden/Harris ticket is the wrong choice for our country and inches us closer to socialism. We must preserve life, liberty, and opportunity for all. -
Agreed...but realistically that‚Äôs what it is...give Biden a count by number puzzle to the side to look busy and keep from interrupting
The problem here, she keeps proclaiming herself as fully black for no good reason. Instead of just telling the truth, and then she could get them both Demographics she could need to building up her supporter base more.  And plus, she also criticized Biden in the primaries, so...
BIDEN gone be the PRESIDENT. Calm down. Y‚Äôall doing too much. üòÇ

Unfortunately populism in the United States is a campaign strategy and not an ideology. Something tells me (no, not the fact that Copola supports mass incarceration or that Biden's election winning strategy is hiding) that there will be change.
Oh, I thought this was about Biden picking Harris...
And he still moves quicker than Biden and in the right direction!
Karen Bass would have been perfect!  No matter what ‚ÄúI‚Äôm riden with Biden‚Äù!

How did Joe Biden discriminate? Women have been so underrepresented in politics, especially in the executive branch.
The majority of the people who are voting for Joe Biden are not voting for Joe Biden. They are voting against President Trump. They are suffering from TDS.
You have been totally disrespected by the Democratic Party both at the debates and now at the convention. If the Biden team had any real sense they would have contacted you for the VP slot.
That is what I say. I am voting for Biden. We need #45 out of there.

the bottom line is that NO politician is perfect (not kamala, not Warren, not Bernie, DEF not Biden). Of course some are better than others, but who would you rather hold accountable in the White House? Donald Trump/Mike Pence or Joe Biden/Kamala Harris? It‚Äôs a VERY easy choice.
yes 100%!! it is definitely fair to criticize kamala. however, biden/harris is without a doubt better than trump/pence!! I keep seeing people saying that they‚Äôre voting third party or not voting at all bc of her which is so disappointing.

By all means, vote for Biden and your worries will disappear!
Now that we ALL know who is running on BOTH sides. I want to the platform of each. I want the reveal of Trump's updated agenda AND the Biden (Harris) agenda.

This is not true. MSNBC &amp; CNN twisted his words. He never said the pandemic was a hoax &amp; created the best economy America has ever had. The #CCP brought a pandemic &amp; POTUS closed the borders on Jan 31st, Pelosi? Impeachment. Come 2 C-Town &amp; Biden said he was a racist xeno.

All it took to make you melt-down was showing you the truth.  You don't argue my points because you can't and you know it.  And Asheville is great, you should visit our lovely and exciting breweries. Physical threats really helping your case that Biden is not pro-Antifa, btw.
What Are They Afraid Of? Biden and Harris Take No Questions From Reporters After First Appearance Together  via
Biden is too supportive of Antifa to contrast obviously with Trump as a champion of legitimate democracy. Four years ago I would have agreed with this, but put it nicer.  Now it just doesn't hold up well.
You're getting feisty b/c you are threatened by the truth. And the truth is Biden failed to tell the truth about violence when it counted. And no one truly knows his real stance on defunding.
I bet they won‚Äôt pocket campaign funds like Trump though. Good job Biden/Harris. Maybe they can keep spending in Texas and Ohio? #BidenHarris2020Landslide
I don't think you have engaged with me in an honest and serious way.  I think Biden shows serious weakness as "return-to-normal" candidate and does a poor job contrasting with even Trump's poor example.
Also, Biden has not been consistent on police funding.  He said he is against defunding.  He also said he is for "redirecting" some police funding into mental health and other services. Kinda sounds like a euphemistic way to say "defunding".
Carrying water to this degree for Antifa when the MSM was covering up violence amounts to (effectively) supporting Antifa, as I said.  This doesn't count?  Fine, then Trump's bad statements don't either. It's about being clean enough to contrast with Trump, and Biden isn't.
Where do you get this garbage from? Trump is the guy who holds all the time not Mr Biden. Despite what you may have learned from Donny... making shit up doesn‚Äôt actually make it true.
Relax. This exchange was this afternoon for Pete's sake. I am looking for video/transcript, but I only find articles about it. Multiple lies/distortions here by Biden at a time when MSM was still lying about "peaceful protest".

An actual reason to vote for Biden: It would be nice to see Trump lose and eat shit.   An actual reason to not vote: Trump being re-elected will hasten the death of this country.
If Biden loses it‚Äôll be because people see two different clowns as P &amp; VP come November. Different clowns but nonetheless still clowns.
