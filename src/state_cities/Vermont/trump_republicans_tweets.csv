"Trump's Mismanagement of Virus Response Wipes out 5 Years of Economic Growth" #FixedItForYou
It really bothers the hell out of me.  Trump has identified himself as an asshole.  The military has a strong anti-asshole doctrine which comes from our deep anti-asshole culture.  I bet when he was a kid he threw tantrums like you've never seen.
This is factually incorrect. 5 days is average meaning there is a range. May also be a mild or atypical sx phase before testing. Doesn‚Äôt mean exposure was at rally. Doesn‚Äôt mean it was. What‚Äôs beyond question is trump was irresponsible to hold rally irrrespective of Mr Cain case.
Trump is gone in a few months. Eight more years of Bush would be far more damaging.
I'll be betting on more than 50%. People remember his bullshit when he had active brain cells. After Trump, we need something other than a puppet of goldman sachs.

Doing what the conservative state Utah has successfully done since 2014 is apparently trying to beat Trump "by any means necessary". Partisan hacks politicize everything. You went off on a rant about a bunch of stuff unrelated to voting by mail.
I don't see why the ruling class would be better off with Trump as opposed to Biden, seems like Biden would be better for capitalism. That's why I would be surprised if there is any election delay.
guess this electuon will never come, even if there is a vaccine available, because trump voter will never use it.
People in the article are proposing solutions to greatly reduce the number of ballots rejected. It's in Trump's interest to make it as difficult as possible to fix these problems with vote by mail. It's the only way he can lose the election with some dignity.

In our opinion: America must not let mistrust derail the 2020 election. Trump still baselessly claims mail-in ballots will be stolen from mailboxes or printed by foreign governments and shipped to the U.S. ‚ÄúIt will be the scandal of our times!‚Äù he tweeted.

President Trump postponed throwing the first pitch at the Yankees game so he could focus on vaccine development and economic recovery.  Are those two issues not important to this Biden VP wannabe?
99!  When it comes to the number of days til we can vote Trump out, we‚Äôre finally in double digits.  Soon, y‚Äôall.
It's this simple.  If Trump is re-elected, our country no longer has a future as we know it.
Oh ffs We can‚Äôt have another 4 yrs of trump. Can‚Äôt people understand this?!
Back in May, I predicted 300k dead by the end of August. In a year or two, if Trump doesn't leave office, we'll have 3 million dead for sure.
Yes. Millions will die of this because of Trump &amp; the GOP.
I got it from Trump's press conference. You're right, it's not accurate. The true rate is much higher.
Monument of division.  Sounds like a perfect description of trump.

The best part of this is the supporters actually expected better of trump. Better. As though the guy who has no values, is filled with hate, and hangs out with child molesters, should be expected to text Bible verses instead. ü§¶üèª
Americans have a right, even a duty, to challenge our government and its forces, enshrined in our founding documents. Anyone silent in the face of what Trump is doing in #PortlandProtest and his use of federal agents as his private militia is complicit

Trump supporters more enthusiastic than Biden's: poll
That's like saying If it hadn't been for raping children, Bill Clinton &amp; Donald Trump wouldn't agree on anything.  Vermont abolished slavery, which is why it wasn't one of the original Colonies.
It was blocked by the senate which is GOP Majority. The blame should be on GOP not the minority in senate. If dems were in control of the senate Trump would have been impeached and removed forcefully.
The "Last Week Tonight" host also offers a basic cognitive test for those who support Trump's crackdown.  via
Biden's lead over Trump in the national polls is three times as large as Clinton's, which puts him well outside the margin of error.
Yet GOP and Trump want to make it harder for Black voters, Asian voters, Hispanic voters, College students, Millennials, and Generation Z voters. Are GOP scared to face their firing from us employers? Politicians are our employees and us voters are the manager, they‚Äôre fired.
Well given that this political climate is two times worse for the GOP than in 2018, and Trump potentially having an effect on the GOP, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Dems hold SC01, NY11, OK05. OK05 is where the votes determined the OK health care expansion reform vote.

üö®FACT CHECK: Joe Biden‚Äôs deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield appeared on MSNBC and continued to push previously debunked false claims about President Trump‚Äôs response to the coronavirus.   Here are the facts --&gt;
He's sending a message to business leaders that he's all about law and order, and just like we did in Chile, nameless police will terrorize political dissidents.  Trump's losing this one.
There goes all respect for Brett Fabre. Trump looks in really good shape too. About as good of shape as his polling numbers.
Trump voted by mail in the last election, and at least 16 Trump admin officials did as well. But he doesn‚Äôt want US to vote by mail.

Going golfing with Trump, would be the last thing I ever do.
So people who voted for Brexit are the British equivalent of those who voted for Trump?
I guess it would be fitting for Trump to lose the election based on a child sex ring story since nutcase right wingers leveled those charges against Hillary Clinton in 2016.  And because we are living in an increasingly fictional world, that's what's going to happen.
Wish I could say Mikes wrong. We‚Äôll see, 100 days.  Tough to see how trump turns it around.

Nope. They're just trying to protect Reagan's image that, in their minds, is a good one &amp; can bolster other republicans since trump went even further round the bend. Neither Reagan, nor anyone who props his legacy up, should be appreciated.

I don‚Äôt see this as a good thing for Trump tbh
The Reagan Foundation has spoken. And they want tRump to stop using his image. MLK, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Lincoln, JFK, would never have stood behind a blatant racist like tRump. This is a delusional obscenity.
I am a member of the #ResistanceTaskForce because our lives depend on it! We need to take down Trump and neutralize his fascist base.
What utter delusional, obscene, insane, bullshit is this? Tubman? Douglass? JFK? Lincoln? Eisenhower? MLK? They all would‚Äôve hated tRump for his blatant racism. The founding fathers would‚Äôve hated him for his disdain &amp; disregard for their Constitution. Reagan‚Äôs fdn is suing him.
i wanna see joe biden call donald trump out on the debate stage for being on the epstein dossier and wishing ghislaine maxwell well and if he doesn‚Äôt that is legit all the confirmation we need that he/the people around him are equally guilty and attached
Genuine question, how can trump be up +1 in Ohio, but down -10 in the same national poll?  Ohio for sure has leaned right for years now, but the state is still very purple.

Reagan wasn‚Äôt a good man. But, next to tRump, he‚Äôs a choir boy. Nixon too. The inscription on the grave only proves that he never met anyone as utterly depraved as tRump-or didn‚Äôt realize he had.
I think he'll use the Pandemic to do that. He's cutting testing, healthcare workers are still low on PPE etc... He or one of his enablers will use any trick they can to do anything. I just really don't trust the Trump administration at all.
Mr. Trump, you need to wear a bra and a girdle!!
Biden has earned none of this. The whole country is gambling on Trump continuing to hurt himself because Biden is so weak.
I knew from 2016 he was an asswipe. I litterally will never ever vote GOP in office or Congress until they kick out Trumpism, and the Tea Party nutcases. Trump, Roy Moore, Steve King, Ted Cruz, McConnell, McSally, DeSantis, Ron Johnson, Abbott, Pence, Kempt, Allen West are cancer

Given how Trump has abused ‚Äúactings,‚Äù I‚Äòm sure the GOP will be totally fine with the four-year reign of Acting Treasury Secretary Elizabeth Warren....
After Trump is out of office, we need to have a nationwide vote by mail, it should be a mandatory option for everyone including the homeless or ones who are in poverty should also be allowed to vote. Election Day should also be a nationwide holiday too, and PTO day.
The most cringe worthy thing about the reactionary left that formed after trump, is that they believe history began in 2016.  Since 1931, there have only been 4 republican governors of Kentucky.   How are they this dumb?
Three million more people voted for Hillary than voted for Trump.
Like Trump, he needs to be put out to sea...
The only thing the GOP has to run on is Trump. They've sold everything else. No integrity, principles, morals, or success. It's all about the man, not the country.
A good share of Trump supporters depend on SS, SSI, SSDI, and medicare and really don't know what Republicans want to do, and some are so idiotic they would still support him.

As a voter who mostly unbiased, I ain‚Äôt just gonna forget what the GOP did to our country in 2020, civil unrest, 40 million unemployed, out of control pandemic, 144,000+ deaths, 28 million evicted, worst since the Great Depression, and defending Trump. Current GOP is toxic.
I fear of a 2010 repeat. Not letting Dems off the hook either as I am tired of how polarized our politics has become. 2 years of dem majority after Trump is not enough to fix economy pre pandemic. Tea party, and Trumpism are why I think they need to be punished for 10 to 20 yrs.

Hello... My name is Donald Trump And I would like to share with you the most amazing book  A book by Mary Trump
Trump has no morals. Never has, never will. Neither do you.
I bet Trump knelt to the Mob plenty of times during the 70s and 80s, as they controlled all NYC construction.
Just voting is not enough. I'm afraid if you don't run   as VP which would be a lay down win for us we will have Trump for 4 more years. But this is your decision.
I'd add that we were at maximum partisanship a couple of years ago. The progressive candidates support Biden and got him to bring the platform left, even as independents and some Rs flock to the Democratic ticket. Trump's support, meanwhile, is softening to the high 30s.
No. compared to what Trump and this corrupt administration has done? Doesn‚Äôt even register. If something is real and proven, I will condemn it. Something you would never do even when it is right in front of your face.
Even Putin himself pays attention to public opinion. Trump is sinking. We can all see it. He can barely remember five words at a time. Be strong. Stand up for your rights and the rights of your fellow citizens. We shall overcome.
Compared to someone like Orban, who took over 2/3 of Hungary's parliament and immediate rewrote the constitution, Trump is not in a great position right now. He used to have support from parts of the population that are rapidly deserting him right now.
There's a paradox right now, in that Trump is making huge  grabs as his other sources of power dwindle. It is a dangerous cocktail but we can absolutely win.
Yes unlike you, Trump will protect American citizens and their property. You know, like it tells him to do in the Constitution.
Correct on all counts.  We have to beat them.  We at least have to go through the process of an election, win, and then fight to get him to leave.  Unless we can first impeach Barr and then open the lid on Trump's crimes ‚Ä¶ We are together in this.
