Citations please for articles he likes? Dates of articles?  Trump has sabotaged our Post Office! #SupposedCovidBriefing
Dont think so.Trump you give a rat's ass to think of the people of U.S.families are out of jobs and savings has run out. $1200.00 is nothing compared to our Bills.  My rent is 1150.00 that leaves me 50.00 bucks just enough for little food,10.00 in gas. You want to be president.
That concerns me Will Trump find a excuse to start a war? Perhaps with  indirect help from Putin?
God I fucking hate trump so much but president pelosi sounds like a dystopian nightmare too
Trump is a liar!!! He has zero clue...
Your corrupt buddy PutinPuppet hasn't infiltrated state election officials across country enough to guarantee his reelection, but you/AZGOP, willfully undermining Arizonans, have been very generous to Trump w your valiant Vote Suppression efforts!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Meanwhile, Trump cultists will put on the tinfoil hats, and come up with any deranged reason to say ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs a conspiracy, Dear leader good‚Äù

Perhaps first attempt to educate yourself about voter fraud and the likelihood of it occurring through mail in ballots through proper outlets that are not bullshit trump propaganda.
I have heard the words "trump does not have the authority" from Congress before and somehow trump/Barr found a work around.
trump and his cronies are nothing but criminals, all of them! Just because he commutes a sentence doesn‚Äôt mean innocent. He only supports what he thinks will help re-election. Lies! Cover-ups! Demons that get you pregnant or vaccine to stop your religious tendencies. Uh huh!!

Had to wonder which sycophant trump would literally kill
Trump thinks he can enrage us Dems by threatening to delay elections. Ha!  We listen to factual news, like NPR, that say there's no way for him to do it. Either he's an idiot or an intentional liar.
Look at our current situation. Trump is the problem. Vote this clown out.

Trump and Navarro bought a shitload of the stuff and nobody wants it. They‚Äôre trying to create need so they can off load it. I think they‚Äôre asking they‚Äôre friends like Gomert to shill for them. Plus that cockamamie African ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù who‚Äôs pushing it too. I think it‚Äôs that simple.
If it's new for you, that means you haven't been paying attention. This shit was happening long before Trump, and it will probably continue to happen because this country is full of racist shit heads.
You cannot talk about integrity if you support Donald Trump. Any Trump supporter has got to admit the man has no integrity whatsoever.
Trump is pathetic. Vote that weasel out. #PutinOwnsTrump
I get what you're saying, but you are also reading a lot into Booker's words. He's not suggesting a 2nd impeachment, just pointing out that Trump AGAIN is taking actions that benefit Putin. At some point, reasonable people should start to realize it might be more than coincidence
So the outcome is, in fact, giving Putin what he wants. Either Trump is doing this to punish Germany, as he says, or it is done to please Putin and punishing Germany is just a means to that end. If you want to believe Trump is telling the truth about his intentions, good luck.

My opponent published an op-ed abt Trump signing the Great American Outdoors Act, a bill he cosponsored, into law.  Except the bill HAS NOT become a law bc Trump HASN'T signed it into law yet.  Why mislead the public &amp; give Trump credit for something that hasn't happened?  #AZ01

Trump divides our country every single day. It is terrible. I want him gone. Always tweeting overtly racist statements to his base. Disregarding human life. Fear mongering. Never taking responsibility for all of his failure. Blaming Obama. Trump is worthless as a President. üëéüèª
I truly believe Trump spews more hatred and racist comments than anyone. It‚Äôs sickening. He hates people of color.

No other President would have been able to produce what you have. Absolutely disgusting. Trump is the goat. Not GOAT. Just a goat. Screaming, feinting, and eating whatever he could find. You are the troll under the bridge. I can't wait for The Billy Goats Gruff to... You know.
You weren't invited! AND, excuse me perhaps you haven't heard? It's the Trump Virus now!

trump is right on this one.  Low doses of hydroxychloroquine (200mg) with zinc twice a week destroys COVID-19.   The democrats and the democrat party propaganda media do not want this information given to the American People.  #gokickrocksandpoundsand
The democrats:  hate trump  will do and say anything to destroy trump  are evil, mean, cruel, liars, and out of touch with the American people  are communist totalitarians and consider anyone else an enemy  are in cahoots with the propaganda media  #gokickrocksandpoundsand
Trump and his sycophants ranting delirious, insane conspiracy theories wasn't the official WH messaging. The message was flatten the curve, prepare for and deal with local spikes, and partially reopen in careful stages based on well planned criteria  to keep the curve flattened.
He cries, but not for the deaths he cd've prevented.  Trump policies are unAmerican, fascist, unlikable
Vote for what? A continuation of the policies that led to Trump in the first place? An administration that doesn't give a shit if we live or die? When are you going to realize that Dems are not the good guys and they don't care about you?
Trump tried to say he's already lowered drug prices.  Today I paid over $1,200 for 2 *generic* meds, that's with insurance Express-Scripts.  You're all serving the drug makers, not us pawns.
That is because Hydroxychloroquine, Zinc, Z-Pack will stop the COVID-19 virus and help people get better.  This does not fit the democrat party or the democrat party propaganda media's agenda to destroy trump.  So tired of the media's lies.  #gokickrocksandpoundsand

We need Trump to shut up and let  infectious disease experts do their job. He is causing the problems!!!   Fauci on Trump criticism: I'm not misleading public 'under any circumstances'
At the end of the day, trump is a coward. He will leave.
He wasn't aware of the Michigan capitol building being occupied by armed protestors because there were so many protests going on? No, there weren't. That was long before George Floyd, and Michigan and its governor were very much the center of attention due to Trump's bullying.
Is Trump that egotistical to think this is all about him?  Personally I would have him another 4 years if the three people in my life who died from it were alive and life was back to normal. So no it isn‚Äôt about his election.  Where do these people come from?!
There are 21 states with rising Covid counts and deaths, but Trump still is pushing for reopening when those states are trying to control the outbreaks. This is absolutely freaking madness. Someone shut that clown up! We will be in this current situation for another year! #enough

The word was intended for trump, not you.
Prove it. Show some proof. Let‚Äôs see it. Cause Trump:
Trump declares democracy illegal and sends in punk ass wannabe stormtroopers.  Costs taxpayers millions just to cause a mess.  But of course for some property rights trumps human rights.
This ‚Äòwait and see‚Äô BS should be disqualifying to coming on MSNBC. It‚Äôs like answering the question, ‚Äòshould you take foreign help RE: a political opponent.‚Äô Trump said sure. Everybody else says, ‚Äòcall the FBI.‚Äô Don‚Äôt be saps MSNBC.
I don't think the Floyd thing had anything to do with whats going on.... I think this was the opportune time for these lowlifes to "ef up" everything w/support from the Dems to blame Trump....and continue their march towards voter fraud!!!
trump is only a threat to the washington dc elite.  The courts and congress have effectively contained trump when trump was out of line.  Big government communists and the washington dc elite are the real threats to America.  #gokickrocksandpoundsand
Let‚Äôs be honest. Both candidates are awful. Trump‚Äôs mouth, tweets and ego are an embarrassment to our nation while Biden, when he can remember where he is, wants to turn America into a socialist European style country totally controlled by the elite class. We lose either way.

My life. THAT is not "trump's America". That is EVERY presidents' America since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA into law. Those ppl,dont vote,at all. They feel abandoned by both parties,and theyve got plenty of evidence to support that theory. Those ppl are ignorant. They are dumb.
Bingo. Not just "overweight". Morbidly obese,in poverty,w a Mississippi sign in the background. Shit like that is EXACTLY why the south is as red as blood. Do we want to beat trump,win back congress,or insult the skanks? Hate to break it to yall,but I lived among those ppl all
Except the entire thing is fake,and offensive. How in tf do we propose to be  ashamed of "trump's America",while we're doing the same exact shit?
trump has no idea what playing president looks like! Now, if you ask him to play a golfer...

I think that is a correct summation of the logically impossible position of the Trump administration.
As well they should.  ‚ÄúIn many interviews with female voters of all political persuasions over the past three years, one of the things many of them said they don't like about Trump is his coarse, sexist language and how he has changed the dialogue in America...‚Äù /1
Gov. DeSantis represents everything wrong with the neo-Republican mindset and illustrates just how dangerous it is in a crisis. Lives lost simply do not factor into his thinking whatsoever because GOP orthodoxy requires that action be divorced from facts.

I would vote by mail if Trump's new postmaster wasn't closing post offices  satellite post offices, and slowing down mail. Everyone needs to go to the voting booth with masks and sanitizer
With Trump's postmaster it's open for taxes and closed for ballots
Amazing that Trump would use this racist tatic. Doesn't he know that Biden was in office for 8 yrs. as VP and nothing that Trump is saying happened. Doesn't he know this is the yr. 2020 NOT 1955?#SuburbsForBiden
Trump needs to be very careful with inviting foreign interference in our election he just might get what he asks for only they won't be favorable to him! There are countries richer and more savvy than Russia.
The state you represent is shut down. The virus has spread like wildfire and you can't bother to wear a mask! Your loyalty to Trump is killing your constituents! WTF is wrong with you? Does being a Republican also make you stupid, irresponsible,
Well that‚Äôs not going to happen because I have a career and work. I‚Äôll get 2 jobs if I gave to, just like I did when I put myself through college. There will be more jobs when President Trump wins. He is an awesome president.
Trump HATES POOR PEOPLE! If you don't have as much money as his friends or millionaire donors or himself then he won't give you the time of day! NOT 1 of you supporters would ever be allowed to one of his rich fancy parties unless it was for a photo op!

Ah, it‚Äôs all Trumps fault. Everything was great before Trump. I thought blacks were being killed by police under Obama? But no one including Biden did anything.

And? Who gives a fuck. You act like there's 100% correlation with Trump voters and racism.
Of course somehow the liberals will blame this on President Trump. I just beat them to it.
They don‚Äôt care. They can‚Äôt win by turning against trump and trump thinks opening schools is key to his reelection. The GOP is completely under trump‚Äôs thumb and they‚Äôll all go down together.
The deep state was forced to surface when Donald Trump was elected to the presidency of the United States. Their plans and strategies have been very obvious for the last three years. The organizations that they control our equally obvious. Let the rebellion begin.
You haven't won! There's still people out there sabotaging your peaceful protests. Every one should be taking pics and videos of anyone starting fires and doing damage! Do anything to help police identify them. Trump didn't pull back cause he's wrong. He's planning on you failing

They call anyone who supports President Trump a racist while they lecture about being tolerant of each other.
They demand an congressional hearing and have AG Bill Barr to give his testimony and they don‚Äôt let him speak. They spent hours berating him for everything they hate about President Trump.
They praise Dr Fauci and blame President Trump. President Trump put Dr Fauci on the China Virus task force and takes advice from him.
Every chance we get we patriots need to call out the hypocrisy of the left. Blaming President Trump about his handling of the China Virus and yet Democratic run cities are allowing peaceful protesters and rioters to gather.

Meow. You‚Äôre feisty today. You‚Äôre also full of trump dung, but that‚Äôs not new.
You know it has been awhile since the Russia thing was more or less proven to be likely bs.   Plenty of other crap with substance to hit Trump with. Why do people still cling to the weak nonsense?   Seriously. The cheap arguments and assertions aren't required with Trump.
If President Trump says it‚Äôs black the liberals say it‚Äôs white. No matter what he says they will disagree. That shows the level of ignorance we are dealing with because an intelligent person can a acknowledge wisdom even in an enemy.

Tomorrow there is a congressional hearing about President Trump not caring about the environment because he uses too much toliet paper. Testifying will be: Charmin bears, Cottonelle puppy and Mr Whipple. This is a penalty punishable by public stoning.
There is no need for AG Barr to have to spend his time defending the federal response to the rioters (not protestors). One more way to waste time and money on the President Trump witch hunt. The witches are the ones doing the hunting!
Wow!! Another lynching by Democrats like they did during impeachment, Kavanaugh and everybody else who is in the Trump admin

And yet the Communist leaders at Twitter suspend Donald Trump Jr for posting about this because it doesn‚Äôt fit their socialist politics. Twitter is the one with the agenda, not the American people.
If Barr actually shows up for questioning, it will only be because he wants a political platform to spread his propaganda and strengthen Trump's agenda
By all means Joe stay in the basement. You‚Äôll find out on 3 November just how false those polls were that told you you were ahead of Trump.
They won‚Äôt. They‚Äôd rather see the country go to shit than admit President Trump was right!!!&amp;
And the only reason he's making it there (if he does) is because he wants a political platform to push his propaganda and agenda for Trump, cause he sure as hell won't be telling the truth

Not at all.  The internet nation is totally at war.  This includes the rioters with smartphones in one hand and bombs in the other.   Real people are decent af to each other.  Just like the past few 1000 years, don't bring up politics and religion in mixed company and u r fine

Sexist and racist as evidenced by him trying to talk over anybody of color or anybody with vagina. Trump and Barr suck!
I don't know where you got your Ph.D from but I would look at getting a refund if you are truly and honestly supporting Trump.

Agree... however just like the coronavirus Trump doesn't care about Americans. Neither do you and neither does the GOP. Y'all make it painfully obvious how much you don't care. #25thAmendmentNow  #RemoveTrumpNow
Do you really think you're the reason FOX made it big.   News Flash Trump: YOU are the reason America's suffering right now. You can't do anything right. My guess is you need instructions on how to use the bathroom properly.
Racist Trump is spreading hate everywhere he goes. #Biden2020Landslide  #TrumpLoses2020
Trump is playing you people like a fiddle.
I've heard some locals say if Trump gets 4 more years, they're moving to Mexico
Trump‚Äôs a delinquent - is that the same thing?!? And...
Trump why don't you try explaining why Kodak stock skyrocketed before you made the announcement. There is corruption in Everything You Touch.
Nobody cares about you trump.
American people are being evicted from their homes and not having enough money for food Trump is revamping the FBI building across from his hotel providing 2 billion dollars and giving money to airports and if companies. He does not care about American lives or America!
Trump is not needed in the US or any place for that matter.
More trump and GOP corruption.
Trump is psychotic. He enjoys inflicting pain &amp; suffering on others, it makes him feel powerful.
Trump has no conception about Reality!
As far as the media and the left is concerned, it seems like they will not even consider a differing opinion than their own preconceived - cult like belief. Much like climate change....Trump should come out against it and then they will proclaim it a wonder drug....
Good plan, too bad our President Never had one for our Nation.  if he would have followed through we Might have been safe, now we are in more trouble thanks to Donald J Trump!  Stay safe!!!!!
Isn't That interesting?  Such Nonsense from trump and his Lackeys!  Stay safe Glenda!
Trump says he never confronted Putin about Russia bounty reports - Axios  via    WHY NOT???????????????????????????????
You‚Äôre a very angry little person aren‚Äôt you. What would you possibly know about Trump that is factual???? I‚Äôll wait ... oh nothing ? That‚Äôs what I thought
No, Senator, it is on you who blamed President Trump for his early actions, now you are blaming President Trump for your parties inaction.   The Democrat policy on Trump is "Damned if he does, damned if he doesn't"
This is maybe the first time I'm glad I live at the heart of a racist-ass, Trump-loving, ruby-red county.
Rabid Trump cultist so concerned by Biden/Harris ticket he attempts to undermine it by tweeting things nobody actually voting for Biden cares about to other rabid Trump cultists.
Barr was not prepared for the questions that were asked by democrats! I pray he will go to jail for supporting Trump and his conspiracy theories.
It's important to understand what we are up against. People like Trump are so pathologically disordered, they are real monsters.
He's an arrogant jerk just like trump.
Lindsey, Are you seriously saying but everything Trump is doing he is doing for the American people? He has his gestapo out there inciting violence on the streets of America! Things to not ask late until Trump sent in his Gestapo. You have zero integrity and zero heart.
That's  funny , ya okay I'll be right there.  Trump  2020
Gov. Ducey opened Arizona too early to please his master, Trump.  Many have paid the price.

The President should think about the fact that Dr. Fauci tells the Truth, Trump doesn't!
This Isn't needed!  Nor do we need to pay for Trump's Wall.  The people who are Hurting financially because of job loss or lay offs need more money to help them live.  They need money for food, bills and the Gov. needs to stop Mortgage or rent payments to help them.
Trump has earmarked 2 billion dollars to redo the FBI building across from his hotel. Americans are losing their housing, Americans are going hungry, Americans are dying, Americans are being killed and attacked on the streets of America, and this is his concern. Trump. Must. Go.
The people need to stay safe to live.  Trump doesn't care about the little guy that works hard for his family and lives paycheck to paycheck.  He only cares about his finances and the Rich.  It's obvious with his Tax cuts for the Rich in the past.
152,320 Deaths in the United States!  4,498,343 Cases of Coronavirus.  Donald J Trump IS Responsible for all of this Crisis and so much more Corruption!  No one could Make this up unless they wrote a Novel about the Worst Leader in History!
Donald Trump, chicken pie; kissed the girls and made them cry; When the reporters came out to play; Donald Trump ran away.
Barr is as bad as Trump with continuing to Blame others for trump's inadequacies &amp; lack of action when needed.

I don't know what you consider "violent" but cops have killed black men for nothing more than standing the wrong way. This image depicts exactly what she was referring to. Different reactions to people pushing the trump's agenda.
What happened at Lafayette Park was Criminal and a Disgrace for our Nation!  Trump had these Peaceful Protesters abused and hurt badly!  Unconscionable!
Trump is directly responsible for the deaths of 150 Americans! He is incompetent and should not be in office! The GOP is babying him and letting this spoiled brat in the White House do whatever he wants.
The only enemy is a state that we have right now is you Trump!
is now allowing Barr to speak &amp; she is saying her constituents R scared. She says guns R being bought more rapidly now because of the Protests.  Asking why the Autonomous zones R more dangerous N democrat areas. She supports what Barr &amp; Trump R both doing, Of course!
I find them deplorable!  Hillary was right about everything!  Deplorable can be used for so many that side with Trump!
I'm sure he's trying to.  He bought up much of the supply and people who actually needed this drug for other illnesses were hurting because they couldn't get it.  Anything Trump does is for his own Financial benefit.
Tell it Like it is!  Some R Govs. are Pandering to Trump and are not doing what is necessary to stop their citizens from getting this Coronavirus and from Dying!
Trump continues to change his status on the Coronavirus each day.  One day He says we R winning with the Virus, the next it will get worse before better, than the next day he wants to reopen!  If that doesn't Prove we should use the 25th. Amendment, i don't know what would?
Trump is America's Village Idiot!
What about the 'Peaceful Protesters' that were Tear gassed, &amp; shot with Rubber Bullets for a Photo Shoot of Trump with a Bible he doesn't read?
Trump is Dumping Trillions of our Dollars into the Stock Market!
Oh Yes!  There R many in the Republican Party that have helped Trump in his endeavor to fool &amp; lie to all of us. It would be up to the courts to decide their Fate.  I also want justice for our country.  We waited and put up with so much in these 3 &amp;1/2 years.

$200.00 is a drop in the bucket.  Trump gives the Rich Tax cuts and Thinks $200.00 will solve their problems.  He really is Incompetent!  He's a Business Genius?  At what?
This is a question Trump supporters NEED 2 Think about!  I weary of Trying to think WHY they do!
Today the Death count on Americans is OVER 150,000.  Did Donald Trump make a statement to share his sympathy to families?  NO!  Did he make an effort to be at Jon Lewis Memorial?  NO!  This President has No Empathy for the people in our country or those who Served with Goodness!
Another one of Trump's people Tests Positive 4 the Coronavirus!  No Brains!

What a surprise. Trump uses every single one of those words
No not really like you said he never built anything and he don't have a magic wand so when President Trump was elected he showed him how to build stuff how to bring back industry and they hate him for that the Marxist socialist Democrats
They don't want to hear the truth when the Democrats Total Hearing CNN MSNBC they all cover it so the word will get out when President Trump hold a press conference CNN MSNBC don't show it so most people don't know what's going on
Following in Trump's footsteps most MAGA  don't read. Their only source of news is Fox aka Trump Propaganda TV  *Yes I know this is inflammatory. But true.
Thank you Trump &amp; GOP. Covid, economy, national security, cruelty, racism, military intervention against US citizens in Democrat states ~ all are worsening at an accelerated rate the closer we get to the election. Hold on tight &amp; remove every GOP up for election. #FlipItAllBlue
Has anyone else noticed that Russia (&amp; likely Trump) have mounted huge social media attacks? Replies, retweets &amp; tweets are overflowing w divisive rhetoric. Often trolls argue extreme GOP &amp; Democrat positions. It will get far worse before election #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Why are these radical socialist Marxist liberals Democrats so much against free speech if you wear a trump hat have an American flag where are religious symbol they want to destroy you run you out of business humiliate you what is wrong with these people that's what makes this
Exactly it's never been about the virus socialism and getting rid of President Trump because his economy was roaring and getting better every day they had to put a stop to it somewhere this was a perfect opportunity they hate America
The Marxist socialist liberal Democratic politicians talk about the unemployment rate what are the one keeping everybody out of work out of school yep they say they can fix it till they get in didn't President Obama said he didn't have a magic wand but Trump did for manufacturing
So perhaps Trump needs to fix the USPS. He‚Äôs claiming his failure at having a fully functioning postal service is the problem. So the theorized election problem is his fault. #tiredofallthewinning
Yes President Trump is putting I thought the right path away from socialism Anarchy and lead the world to a better world
You don't know what the hell you're talking about you think sleepy girl would be doing a better job speaker Pelosi went to Chinatown and helped spread the disease President Trump stopped air travel from China and was called a racist that was the right move to stop it
When Paul Ryan become Majority Leader I thought it was a good thing but he has to prove me wrong he allowed the socialist Democrat to run all over him that's why they lost the house they couldn't pass anything of President Trump's agenda he fought against it and he was wrong now
President Trump is the best thing that's happened to this country in a long time finally have a business man that loves America not playing politics
Hurt America if you cave in will remember that and you probably will not be re-elected you have to start standing with President Trump give you a backbone start using it
Yes I could see this one I don't know if mine are getting out either when you promote President Trump for some reason you get shadowbanned
There's one good reason for that President Trump mentioned it that it might work so they've been a gift it ever since then they have Trump derangement syndrome so bad if they had a cure that President Trump endorse they wouldn't use it they would ban it
It's like talking to a wall they will not change but they can't give you a reason why they do not like President Trump all they can say is he's racist you ask them why they can't give you an answer
Big Tech bands President Trump it Israel for political speech yet they allow the president of Iran to say death to the United States Death to Israel and other vile remarks like that and that is fine with them but the president cannot is political speech
You got that right they put that narrative out there every politician would be saying it and every fake news said she would be carrying it heavy braking in every 5 minutes to let you know that was Trump supporters What a Sad bunch of people
All this has nothing to do with science it's all about their hatred for President Trump to make him look bad they're willing to destroy America
Is it me or does Trump mirror the anxious and beguiled image of Nero‚Äôs? Ruler promoting power sharing and pursuant of his own passions? Trump WANTS ALL OF US TO DIE, that is why he refuses to listen to science, to give housing, pandemic relief.
They won't pay for that any more than Trump pays cities for security at his rallies or no lay his contractors.
Not enough especially for the unemployed. One gap is for those who were layed off before corona virus &amp; have even less of a chance to ever get a job again. Trump &amp; GOP are creating the greatest theft of American middle class wealth &amp; depression ever.
So Trump is the one who is to blame for this virus? Omg I guess it wasn‚Äôt the Chinese after all.
Anything President Trump like nobody else likes if he had a cure right now they would say it might hurt the environment for some excuse
R you blind our mail in voting is better than getting this virus just wait u trump believers wait till you or family member get this virus then you'll open your eyes it's sad and god I hope that on anybody even trumps people but it will then let's see how you think.
The only one rigging. Election is trump people what happen to the american people we use to stand together till trump took over and hes destroying everything even us Americans we where so proud I'm ashame of our president and that's sad
So it's not the low income people like Trump said that's lowering property value? Trump lied?! What???

Exactly when they are worried about President Trump leaving the White House but they're not worried about that they're more afraid of him staying in a white house cuz it getting voted in they tried to get him out weird every crooked thing they could and couldn't
One of the few truthful things he's said. Then again, with Trump, he'd say maybe it's my personality...nah, it couldn't be that.

Exactly that wasn't a hearing for the American public socialist Democrat only one that makes statements they try to bring down President Trump and attorney general Barr make them look bad it didn't work
President Trump haven't brought it up they would be loving it but because he talked about it now it's a worst thing ever that's Trump derangement syndrome
The hearing was nothing but a show to talk about President Trump and try to make attorney general Barr look bad there's nothing subsistence about it I got up and made speeches wouldn't let attorney general Barr answer them they would say that's not a question that a statement
It's always Obama or Clinton's fault. Trump has never taken responsibility for anything. GOP Senate has never forced Trump &amp; his WH accountability
An answer not as direct but with same meaning as Trump's - will only accept election results if he wins.
Yes I totally agree both Democrats did not want answers they were there to make speeches and belittle President Trump and attorney general Barr so sad all those Congress people should be censored
Trump likes 'em feisty.
Trump set up a task force to investigate voter fraud in '16. Abandoned it very quickly because they couldn't find any.
Nope. Nice try. These suits were by contractors that he didn't pay, women that he harassed, customers that he ripped off, partners that he cheated. Not talkin' business liability. But you'll make excuses for the trump crime family no matter what.
If you own 1000 businesses, you are bound to get 15 or 20 lawsuits. Not 3500. Ask contractors, bankers, co-investors, how much they enjoyed doing business with trump. If he did shoot someone in the middle of 5th Ave, you'd say "if you fire a gun, it's bound to hit someone."
Whether it should or shouldn't be, it isn't. And if that bothers you, how could you abide by the blatant nepotism in the trump administration?
She hired his firm. Not illegal. That firm represents dozens of candidates all over the country. It's an accusation that can't be adjudicated, because the FEC doesn't have a quorum. She met him through his firm. She didn't hire his firm because of him. False equivalency to trump
It's more likely that your 72 year old mother would go to jail than any of trump's cronies. This is insanity.
Did I thought you only had Trump derangement syndrome haha
The way they look at it anything that happens it's got to be President Trump's fault because after all he did take the presidency away from they're darling Hillary and they have never been able to accept it
About President Trump and our government she's a disgrace to the Congress she never allowed him to answer one question all she did was try to smear the president

I agree, dems and pubs alike, except Obama were racist My point, and I admit I might be putting too fine a point on it, is that all the others denied being racist. It was mostly dog whistles and ambiguous rhetoric Trump is openly racist. It may be a distinction with no difference
What other option is there? You can't think trump is better

Neither Trump or GOP accept responsibility for their self-serving corrupt actions.

Prince has been lobbying Trump to use his private mercenary goons (with no loyalty to US Constitution).to replace troops since at least Seychelles meeting. More likely, since before appt of DeVos.
All that stuff was taboo with regular politicians President Trump if not a politician he talks about what's wrong with our country and try to straighten it out is regular politicians cover it up and don't want to mess with it are afraid
Who is other protestor already on ground? Was he beaten or pushed? These goons need to be prosecuted. It's disgraceful District judge said state had no standing to force them out of the state. They're not protecting federal property. It's purely  political cruelty by Trump.
That's good news and you look great spread the word the President Trump doesn't win these riots will be all the time
He's alive to vote again for Trump.
At least Trump has competition in that category.
Everybody should be watching this this blows everything out of the water we shut down his country for no reason because snowflakes that scared and they try to slow down Trump's momentum that's all it was about
I agree 100% and we're just getting to the tip of what he was doing behind closed doors it'll all come out will President Trump get reelected that's why they want to stop him so bad
The fake news corrupt politicians and the doctors wouldn't believe the truth would President Trump let them in on what's going on there responsible for all the deaths a lot of people could have been saved they would have just tried it
Go get them Tom expose all of them expose all the dirty cops and the cover up in the doj Trump was absolutely right he would be inspired upon before he became president then they try to impeach him
I wonder why Trump supporters are out there burning down buildings for vandalizing small businesses maybe because they love America
Yes they should President Trump a Republican or a backbone they need to start using it start standing up for themselves quit hiding in the closet is only a few that's a anyting the rest are waiting to see the outcome so sad
Yes when President Trump wins it will be all over they will need to keep up their lying to try to get rid of President Trump

You're saying mowing down protestors with bikes and baton /gas  wielding Trump stormtroopers is justified to arrest 1 person is legal &amp; moral? These are fascist tactics meant to intimidate while purposely misrepresenting the 99% of peaceful protestors.
Fascist Trump &amp; his enabling GOP traitors seek to destroy our Republic. They'll stop at nothing for greed &amp; to retain power.
They're doing a disservice to the American public but they've been doing that for many years it didn't start 4 years ago with President Trump it just went into overload because of him
How many of those articles are from the first weeks of the protests? I‚Äôd imagine trump would be raging if ‚Äúcities were burning‚Äù looks like a few cop cars that deserved it. A firework being shot off. One building. You‚Äôre so moronic. I‚Äôd expect nothing less from an embellisher
Those people need to be held accountable if for some reason President Trump does not get reelected this will all be swept away will never see it again God help us
It was the height all the the illegal stuff the Obama justice department have been doing domestic and foreign policy that's why they had to get rid of General Flynn start with to disrupt President Trump slow him down it didn't work
We just liked Obama because of his policies that was against America we disagreed with they just hate Trump because he beat Hillary the torch did not get past the Hillary and they can't get over that they can't accept it
So I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre one of the ones not assuming trump is doing anything out of evil intent?
That is their model do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do they haven't accepted Hillary's loss Donald Trump's win yet and now they're complaining because they know he's going to win again and they know they can't stop it unless they stuff the ballot boxes that's why they want mail-in ballots
Creepy Joe will not take an interview Eve with Chris Wallace what you'll give him a a pass not all softball questions maybe a few difficult questions and they don't want to be exposed wait, tell the debate that will seal the deal for President Trump
Exactly they'd rather have Americans died in the streets that allow President Trump to take out a win for being on top of this from the beginning
You can tell when representative Adam Schiff lives his mouth moves he lied to the American people said he had proof but that Trump colluded with the Russians but he never produced it he needs to be in front of a grand jury for lying to the American people and the fake news
Yes Obama's justice department and the Deep state the crooked cops in the FBI and the doj tried to stop President Trump before he took office that's why they started investigating anybody that supported President Trump just try to stop him
This is what Trump does to dissidents. Not my America.
The NY Times misleads. Prince isn't just close to Trump. His sister is Betsy DeVos the Sec of Education destroying our public schools and ensuring crippling debt for college students who relies on loans with usurious interest like the ones she operated.
They're not.   But even if they were - the response isn't proportional. Firing into unarmed protestors is abhorrent. Trump's goons need to leave now.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN  He lies about #Portland. Peaceful protestors carrying only phones, homemade shields &amp; bike helmets for protection. No intimidating guns. Just leaf blowers to disburse gas while Trump goons shoot Moms
Just heard yet another republican on tv saying he's just not going to vote because he can't stand trump, but he doesn't like Biden. HEY REPUBLICANS, we're in this mess because of you. Not voting IS a vote for trump. Biden doesn't want to be a dictator. That should be enough #Vote
You so understand trump is not a practicing anything when it comes to religion right...? üôÑ nor does every person follow a Christian faith...?
Wake up!  Stop watching MSNBC or CNN. Where is the reports of Portland destruction and these ‚Äúpeaceful Protesters burning federal buildings with people inside? ü§îThese people want Anarchy and it‚Äôs not Trump‚Äôs fault!
Yeah. It‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs fault right ?  Why these people are acting like idiots and not listening to police orders?? Get out of that situation!!  These are not peaceful protesters !! Please!  #StopTheHate
Thanks for sharing video of the mostly peaceful protests. Mainstream media prefer to highlight violence instigated by Trump's private army.  Fox propaganda network broadcasts' play into Trump's law &amp; order campaign of lies, racial hate &amp; fear #Resistance
It's closer than you think...Trump is the closer...he's the snake in a parable he told where he bites the woman that took him in and she ask "why did you bite me"? He answers you knew I was a snake when you took me in Seeing it all play out...it's how they do it
And they were calling President Trump the liar and everything else because of that product everything President Trump says comes true he has great foresight and what's going on he researches everything not like fake news or the Democrats
Churches in general see Trump as their best chance to hold onto their tax shelters.  The Progressive movement is beginning to question the way they have abused, misused and even flaunted there wealth.
The vast majority of Evangelicals don't even know what they are witnessing Donald Trump is a servant of Satan and therefore the Synagogue of Satan Evangelicals have been trained to believe the black hats are Torah following Jews they are Talmudic/ those who violate children cont.
That but he never follows through when are we going to hold Trump accountable for the two-tiered justice system we have in this country now conservative go to jail liberals move on they never held accountable
President Trump was legally voted in in 2016 and they have it recognized that election yet they're worried about if Trump doesn't get reelected he will get reelected will they recognize that election or know they probably won't
Besides... Trump was only in office for a year and a half in July of '18. Give me something recent. He has done so much within the last 2 years.
It‚Äôs insanity. I watched how the Governor changed his entire stance the very day trump said he wants kids in class no matter what. How can any of these governors stand behind this.
It‚Äôs pathetic how fast the Governor changed his stance on kids going back to school. It made me sick seeing the about face he did. Now AZ is still bad with COVID but he pushed the devos and trump agenda verses looking at using caution. I couldn‚Äôt believe it.
Trump"You'd be in jail" me...believe it when I see it Haven't seen it yet and don't think I ever will...Trump's a snake and he will bite

So how did this happen that a failed businessman becomes the leader of our country? How did people not know the reality of his background? Or did they look past it? We are the pawns in a real reality show except it‚Äôs not a show. People are dying.
When President Trump tried to tell him what the doctors told him they called him a quack everything Donald Trump says comes around to bite all these reporters in the ass because they come true
Reporters and politicians keep bringing up and asking President Trump if he wants step aside if he doesn't get elected when are they going to ask the same politicians how come they haven't accepted the election in 2016 if they will accept the election in 2020 when President Trump

So I'm trying to understand - do you have a problem with how President Trump responds to rude, insolent women who try to play 'gotcha' with him? He's sick &amp; tired of the libtard lamestream media &amp; how they frame their questions &amp; comments...help me understand - thanks!
I've been saying since the '16 election that I didn't think he'd leave if he lost in '20. I've been pointing out since '15 that his campaign strategy was right out of Goebbels' playbook. I'm far from the only one that was told to stop comparing trump to nazis.
Wow. How do people actually believe division is called by the Dems? Do you not listen to Trump tearing the country apart with his corrupt and criminal ways?
Separation of church and state has been abandoned under trump.

No it's not. So. Korea, Japan, Germany. We have examples of countries that did it right, and they got back to work quickly. With much lower death rates. Trump turned common sense preventive measures into a political issue.

Trump's encouragement. In July 2020, privately funded wall associated with this organization was reported to be eroding. Trump distanced himself from the group, despite his administration having awarded it a $1.7 billion contract.  #TrumpTheDisaster
Wrong! I‚Äôm a former Trumpster.  No more. Just pointing out that Trump came into office with definite things he wanted to work on, and is doing it. (Refreshing!) But there‚Äôs too much division and trouble to vote for him again.
By May 2020, only 16 miles out of 194 miles of wall constructed under the Trump administration was not replacement fencing. A private organization called We Build the Wall has constructed 0.5 miles (0.80 km) of new wall on private property near El Paso, Texas,   2/?
Trump is killing us daily but stupid #NeverBiden Bernie Bros are more concerned about Biden mispronouncing a word. Idiots!
I guess people outside the GOP have to judge the Republican Party on those elected officials, who could step up, who could impeach. And they have been ALL in on Trump. Also, we keep hearing 90+% support for Trump. You don't hear massive GOP anti-Trump voices on big matters.
You hypocritical liar. What about the other 150,000 who have died because of trump's utterly incompetent handling of the pandemic?
I wonder what trump and Russia have on the GOP??? Hmmm
Another lie.  December 17, 2019, acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Mark Morgan stated that 93 miles of barriers had been built during the Trump administration; according to CBP, at least 90 miles of that replaced existing structures.  1/?

This started when the far right co-opted the Tea Party movement (which itself was unstable enough to let it happen) and actual conservatives were primaried out by far right nationalists. Trump is the culmination of that. And what got us here has to be burned to the ground.

How did Trump kill them?  People knew to wash their hands, socially distance, etc., since March. So Trump can control if 330 million people do that??
Yes, it is. So what? Trump's supporters don't care and there are enough of them to re-elect him IF there isn't a significant effort to elect someone else. No one cares if this administration does something criminal.
If RNC dumps Trump because he's a loser, its going to be harder for Biden.  IMHO.

Obama put preotectiins in place for Trans people. But since Trump wants to rollback everything Obama touches, that means to remove protections for Trans. So yes, Trump hates trans people.

People with TDS see it like he is already making excuses or whatever and are crying about it, people that support Trump see it as Trump being Troll Trump. I really don't care either way. All I know is if a Dem wins the WH we are fk'd and for a very long time.
So when Joe Biden debates Trump and wipes the floor with Trump, what does that mean?  If someone with Dementia out debates you, does that make one stupid, or just inept to lead?  Honest question.

Covid-19 does not exist thx to Trump. That's what Republicans keep telling us. They tell us that it's so safe that kids can go back to school and then they turn around and tell us that it's so dangerous that we should not go vote in person.  Sounds like voter suppression to me
Trump is actively trying to supress the vote because he knows he will lose with increased voter turnout. He freaking admitted it himself.... Try again....  #AlternateRealityMAGALand

Registration efforts have mostly stalled thanks to COVID. But turnout could still put the race beyond Trump and McSally in this CD. there are now more than 214K registered Dems, if they can hit 70% turnout in the Dems side (80% Dem turnout statewide in presedential is normal)
You would be wise to look objectively at what he has done in a short period of time to help POC. BLM is out there destroying things and not doing literally anything to help. Trump is signing executive orders to actually help POC. Dems promise to get votes, Trump delivers!

I know deeply Christian people, folks with genuine good values, who adore Trump. The worst is my Mormon friends who just don't seem to mind his lack of morals. Truly perplexing.
He was sharing the Dr who are using it in the front lines and saving people. You do not trust that dr because she is Nigerian, are you a racist? If so, the next day they had a white Dr lady say the same thing. The regime works and is a safe cure. Dnal Trump Jr just forwarded it.
It worries me, too. They will not take another loss to Trump. They will do anything to stop it. They proved that when they turned over their party to the Marxist radicals.
Ever wonder why they hate Trump so much? Follow their money.

Trump is responsible for 000,000 deaths.  His early lack of action and denial cost us time and lifes.  Fighting masks and saying its Kung Flu, Chinese Flu and then acting like its no big deal while encouraging Gop Gov to reopen...  Yes he is responsible.
Just another Trump lie. Hey Donny! Are those Ghislaine Maxwell papers coming out today? You sound really really scared. How is it to have so much evil stuff that you're scared all the time? Oh yeah - resign.
Such a huge contrast with Trump's blatant self-serving lies during the "coronavirus press conference". Trump is destroying our country. He must be stopped.
WH failure to clean out the deepstate, Trump should call in the head of the army and announce his firing.

This knowledge is not based on scientific fact. But the bottom line is that the rally was a perfect recipe for transmission. People not observing social distancing AND no masks. The rally served no purpose but feeding Trump‚Äôs fragile ego. It simply should never have happened.
How is trump crying? Explain
All those people crammed together without them was certainly a recipe for transmission. He was in at least one high risk group. Maybe he shook one too many hands. But everything about that rally sent the wrong message. Its only purpose was stroking Trump‚Äôs ego.

Has there been a greater step down than from Obama to Trump?? Almost criminal.
Surprised he didn't use the Sen. Cornyn sham excuse that Trump was"Just Joking" about changing the election date.
So in Trump 2nd term he will appoint 3 more SC and Roe vs. Wade will then be overturned shortly afterwards.  Praise the Lord for he is faithful and just!
Trump should be charged for the murder of Herman Cain

The absolute dunce cannot even do a condolence tweet without also doing something goofy that makes Twitter snicker for hours on end. This would almost certainly seem like an intentional bit if Trump were not literally the most unbelievably stupid man on Earth.
Ya know what fucking baffles me? I‚Äôve seen Trump get so much shit for the past 5 years. No one in my social circle likes him. But I still can‚Äôt fathom why so many people admire him?? If Trump is the worst human being alive, why did over 60 million Americans vote for him in 2016?
There is debate about who would be President. Some say it will not be Pelosi because she is also up for election. I don‚Äôt really know but I do understand Trump will not be President in Jan. If we do not have an election.
Over/under on combined IQ?
Is this, somehow, completely different than Pres. Trump's rose garden or Rushmore speeches?
Herman Cain, a former GOP presidential candidate and Trump campaign surrogate, has died after being hospitalized with COVID-19.  via
I think the thing that low key makes me most angry about trump in hindsight is that even if it‚Äôs just by 1% I hate George Bush Jr slightly less...it‚Äôs only 1% less but it still infuriates me how by comparison trump is literally the worst potus to ever serve this great nation.
ASK DONALD J TRUMP
For the record. I follow football. College and pro. I took a survey  that's why.  Ok back to stopping tRump.
Isn't it illegal for him to promote shit like this? Hatch Act violation? And guy prob just made a donation, doubt if Trump has ever eaten his pizza.
How about we delay Donald Trump instead. Fuck him.
tRump kind
Hey Trump, GDP still bad. You aren't distracting us from that!  #trumpsGDPnumbersarebad
Trump needs to setup detention camps for rioters and hold em till after election,
Me too, and that is why I am not voting for Trump
Where‚Äôs the story about how the blue state governors are intentionally keeping their states shut down in order to hurt Trump?
Only 30% of the public likes him.... of that 30% Trump holds a rally during a pandemic that may kill some of that % off.....
You won‚Äôt see an apology from an arrogant Republican who chooses Trump over his district
Trump will always have the mark of Cain on him!
#WeWillVote you out Trump in 96 days. Pass it on.
Trump youth group begins deleting tweets mocking COVID-19 after co-founder dies from the virus
Super lefties: I can't believe Trump isn't saying anything about John Lewis, how disrespectful.  Also super lefties: I can't believe President Lock 'em up, President War Crimes, and President Drone Strike are talking at John Lewis' funeral.
Trump partyed with those pedophiles! His photo ops are more important to him than the people he is supposed to be serving! He is not God &amp; doesn't represent God or the good part of our country.
The only way Trump loses is if we turn a blind eye to the cheating that will be done by democrats. You actually think Americans that love this country will willingly turn it over to Marxist democrats without a fight?  You lady are in for a big surprise.
This is going to disappear, like a miracle! The warmer temperatures will make the Trump virus go away! We're at 15 by the end of the week close to zero. Pine Sol syringes, UV light colonoscopy's. Dont believe the GOP, their enablers, or their mouthpieces like Bongino. All Liars.
I am trying out  to connect with my brother and sisters in Trump.  We must not wait ignorantly till the week before election so that they shut Trump down.  You heard it here first.
"MAKE NOISE"!! Don't let Trump alter and CONTROL OUR election!!!
When trump says something ‚Äúscandalous‚Äù (we must delay the election) one has to wonder what he‚Äôs trying to distract your attention from. The media takes the bait every time. What do you think today‚Äôs scandal is covering up?
Over 150k people have died in America. If you think ü§î trump has made America great in his first term...then his base is VERY DITZY. I believe my EYES üëÄ and I see what‚Äôs actually the TRUTH. what do y‚Äôall see?!? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What we need to do is make sure everyone votes to make sure Trump loses by big numbers. There are people who can remove him.
They took their oath seriously.  Trump only takes his mirror seriously.
Funny how mail in voting was never an issue until Trump, who votes by mail, told all you idiots that it was
MLB can't protect players with multiple testing and isolation techniques. Senators, House members, National Security Advisor, tested daily and still they are getting the Trump virus. Nut Jobs want to send kids back to school because they think its about the election. Pathetic!
Respect that Trump wants so badly.  Yet congenitally incapable of honor, altruism,  integrity and Fidelis.  He couldn't join the military he lost his chance. His family name is synonymous with lies, cheating,  mendacity and selfishness.
Ok, Alien DNA? If there are aliens here they wouldn't be talking to Trump. They would be talking to Angela Merkel or Macron. Someone that is highly intelligent. So the DNA mixed with demon sperm is what's causing the Covid-19 outbreak? Who thought this crazy shit up? Good Lord!
Donald j. Trump could care less.
I follow for many of the same reasons, Mr. Ambassador. Charlie‚Äôs not very bright, but I‚Äôll keep following because his tweets are indicators of how cruel and desperate Trump and his minions are at any given time.
I don't blame Trump.  Cain was a grown man and chose to ignore the experts.  He's got nobody to blame but himself.
Trump's silence is thunderous
lmfaooo trump suggest we postpone the election. this is his dictator move right here lol
Trump Tweet CENSORED By Twitter, Don Jr SUSPENDED For Retweeting  via
Vbm is not the problem and is a false narrative. Also true that there has been a lack of leadership on a lot of issues by Trump that he is trying to avoid by calling for a delay in the election. But indicating that he is personally responsible for the economy is a false narrative
‚ÄòThat‚Äôs my president‚Äô: Obama celebrated for passionate eulogy of John Lewis that smacked down Donald Trump
The fact #Trump "had no intention" to attend the funeral of a fellow Representative, nah bump that an ESSENTIAL part in the history of this country blows my mind...
Says a supporter of Donald J Trump. LMAO!
Trump is seething with jealousy right now. I'm amazed, frankly, that he hasn't had a stroke!
Whatever Trump says, but the sooner the election is over, the sooner the DS will stop its plandemics, riots, and lawlessness.
The arrest of arsonist who set Phoenix Democratic Headquarters on fire üî• I just knew Trump would come up somehow, shocked he claimed to be Ivankas secret husband Insanity defense started I guess. Sad people like this want to declare war on all non Trumpers
Regis Left $20 Million to Trump Campaign
I'm fully convinced that closures and hiding the treatments for Coronavirus is all about the election at this point. Democrats want Americans to be miserable and even die so they can defeat Trump.
Back then early in Trump's presidency I was in favor of eliminating the filibuster.  But once I read the rules of the Senate regarding it I changed my tune on it.  If it's nuked then the minority has no voice and it hurts all 100 Senators.  What a disaster if they get their way.
Trump wants us focused on this instead of the Q2 economic report that shows a 33% loss to the US GDP.
Ask Trump. We‚Äôre doing fantastic better than anytime in history!!! 150,000 dead folks!! And we‚Äôre not done yet!!!
Shame on any reporter who attended trump‚Äôs fake press event
herman listened to tRUMP  herman is dead don't be a herman WEAR THE DAMN MASK PEOPLE ! ! !
She said ‚ÄùAsside from he's not Trump‚Äù, try again.
House won‚Äôt pass any delay, 20th amendment says if election doesn‚Äôt happen Speaker becomes president on 1/20, so Trump is out on his ass anyway - yay for Civics classes!
won‚Äôt do Shit to help a failing economy. He will back Trump because he is as his name states #MoscowMitch. Americans a dying, are losing their jobs. DO SOMETHING
So typical of liberal democrats. Hijacking a funeral to take pot shots at the President. Keep it up. You're only cementing President Trump's re-election in November. Oh, Rest in Peace Mr. Lewis.
I agree.Personally I want Elizabeth Warren as VP but to be honest, at this point I‚Äôm voting for a rock over trump.Also, I will vote for Biden/Harris.But I also know, they are just stop gap for the next four years.I know they won‚Äôt get re-elected but getting trump out is the goal
Never. Trump is stewing all ALONE feeling self-pity that #NobodyLikesTrump!
President Obama says governor Wallace may be gone but President Trump‚Äôs in office right now!!!
Trump?.
Yes they do. People like Trump. There‚Äôs a reason he won‚Äôt talk about the bounties on American soldiers. Are you pro Russia? Or just anti America?
Trump* :  Safe to send your kids to school;  Not safe to hold an election!!!
Fuck #Trump lying about today !
Watching President Obama thinking THIS is what our country should remember on Nov. 3. Three former Presidents coming together to honor Re. John Lewis, who gave his life to make our country better.  And Trump, calling an impromptu presser to make the moment about him.
‚ÄúTop political editor at Fox News: Trump asking to delay election a ‚Äòflagrant expression of his weakness‚Äô‚Äù - Its about time!!
Yes, projection is exactly what Trump does every day he speaks. You can believe that the GOP will save you but you‚Äôre being proven wrong as I type this. Best of luck to you.
Note to followers for today.  is not allowing me to see most of your replies. I'm not ignoring you.  this is a political attack against the Trump campaign. I am working to get  re- elected.  is working to make sure I cant.
I hope they don't! Hearing  speak words of love, respect, and honor is more important than anything that could come out of Trump's mouth unless it is, "I resign...." amirite?
tRump world makes oaths in the way of making money for said self are to be ignored.
This is another example of the hypocrisy that‚Äôs spews from Trump on a daily basis.
Donald J. Trump will deny he was in Tulsa and deny responsibility.
Appointed (R) Az Sen. Martha McSally will support Donny  j. Trump when ‚Äútold‚Äù.
Ummm he‚Äôs trump
Az gov Doug Ducey will not orderAz  to mask up. He just spoke to the supreme leader Donny j. Trump who is supported by the great Dr. Stella Immanuel MD  (Medical Drunk). No Covid. no masks. They have alien science on their side.
Based off of today's tweet, Donald Trump is shitting his pants regarding reelection
And the insane John Cornyn attempts on Twitter to say ‚Äúoh it was just a joke‚Äù Trump is no joke sir what he‚Äôs done to this country is not a joke 150,000 dead Americans he‚Äôs killed -it‚Äôs no damn joke
Golfing with Trump
I now see Trump supporters complaining about not being allowed to travel to other countries because they're "free" We've done it. In 4 years we've come full circle. Incredible.
Two things:  1) Trump is not allowed? He doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúthe power‚Äù? Where the fuck have people been the past four years?  2) Feels like a trap, like when we all had to say ‚Äútrust the election results‚Äù because Trump said he wouldn‚Äôt, while he was aiding interference in the results.
It is NOT in trump's power to delay our election. The American people will not stand for it. We vote in November.
Pointless.
It's hard to care when it comes to Trump. November 3rd is my goal. To rid the grave national security risk in the White House and bring dignity and honesty and honor to our West Wing.
Too bad he followed trump‚Äôs advice
America should vote NOW! This country deserves better than Donny j. Trump and his Alien family .
Trump has no idea what it take to care for a sick child, he has no idea of the worry and misery.
He‚Äôs a hero / lived the way he wanted ! And went to a Trump rally
Speaket Pelosi WILL NEVER let trump get by with changing the date of the election.
The escalation of the violence perpetrated on the ‚òÆÔ∏è peaceful protestors who organized in Portland came directly from the White House, the violence can be directly attributed to the Dictator in Chief Donald J. Trump.
Trump should read the Constitution. Oh I forgot he does not read. Could it be reading is difficult for him
Well that's awful Constitutional of you. I wonder how much pressure Trump and Putin will put on you to change your tune this time Lindsey?  Once you start selling your honor there is no end to it you know.
Why is the Press indulging this story so much? At a minimum, point out the irony of sending kids back to school, but not voters to the polls. The REAL story is GDP/JOBs report!! Trump needs a distraction.  But good news, KODAK stock is up 1700%
you mean the tea party ?  yep, steve did his job. and he‚Äôs going to do the job now.  and yes, they‚Äôre allies in hating trump.  in policy, no, but they aren‚Äôt trump‚Äôs allies either... try to keep up...
It should be obvious at this point that Donald Trump (especially on Twitter) is erratic and will spout off whatever is on his mind. He doesn't put serious thought or assesses the implications of what he says.
Lets face it, the next six months will be hell on earth until Biden is sworn in.  trump and the  will do everything in their power to totally and thoroughly screw this country out of pure retribution!
Fox is carrying it so Trump has nothing to watch. Maybe he could read the PDB, convene the COVID task force, spend some time with Barron or just do SOMETHING!
So you agree that Trump should use our tax dollars to benefit his Hotel? His personal piggy bank. Read more ...less Fox.
All of u libs are banking on Biden?? That tells me everything I need to know. I will not be able to stop laughing on November 4 when Trump wins his second term
Congress wont. Trump is fucked
He‚Äôs a hard core never trumper and suffers from Trump derangement syndrome big time
Bob, it is unbelievably shocking to me that Trump is not ahead by 30 to 40 points! Your comment is so smug, thinking that the lying msm is giving you all of the news. Sorry to inform you but they are not! They only put out what suits their narrative, withhold the rest.
Yes beautiful remarks. But I can't help but hear subtle undertones of digs at President Trump even at a somber moment such as this.
Trump's repeatedly denies any responsibility for the virus and throws responsibility to the States, yet provides no federal assistance to help states deal with the Crisis and even says blue States are less deserving. Where does the federal government get it revenue from?
I grieve for Herman Cain, and I don‚Äôt appreciate lies being told about anyone‚Äôs death. He had Stage 4 colon cancer in 2006. He died from COVID-19 after attending the Tulsa Trump rally with no mask. #RIPhermanCain #WearAMask
It's always funny watching people who think they know Trump well defend him and say, "he would never do/say such a thing," and then Trump proceeds to do/say that thing. There's a significant gap between who Trump is and what his allies think he is.
That was spot on, it moved me ... so many sick people on twitter saying Trump killed him ! RIP you will be missed
‚Å¶ Is the biggest cry baby on the planet. He can dish it but can‚Äôt take it. He said that Twitter trolling the #TRUMPVIRUS tag is making him look bad and unfair. When was it fair for you to betray your country. #joebiden2020.
If Donald Trump has led us, Herman Caine would be alive today.

How the dim witted Trump mandate masks nationally.
Imagine how 2020 might look if Trump did the 1st thing most strongmen have done i.e. get support of the military and/or develop private 'defense forces'

So Trump has accomplished more in most 24 hour period than Biden in 47 years lol thanks for making my point
At least he died doing what he loved - lying for Trump about how dangerous this pandemic is. His choice. A weird hill to die on but there you have it. He chose to attach to a malignant Trump and he died for it. That‚Äôs not mean , that‚Äôs true.
OK, now do Trump.
History will shame their names for as long as we have this republic. Synonymous with treason. Trump's campaign has floundered on his lies and non leadership during the pandemic.
Trump is trying to demonize USPS to cause people to lose faith in the electoral process during a pandemic so he has an excuse to to delegitimize the results. MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ENRAGED BY THIS
Neither of this great men were anything like Trump. They actually cared about America and the rule of law.
Senate Republicans dismiss Trump proposal to delay election
If Donald Trump has led, if he wore a mask and encoiraged us to all wear masks, Herman Caine would be alive today.
Donald Trump is a racist psychopath,who didn't and doesn't give a shit about his own family, why would anyone think he cares about america? Really?  Read Mary Trumps book to be enlightened
We could really get a hold on virus if President Trump declared martial law until vaccine is found.  Suspend all elections, taxes until  this is over he should remain President until such a cure is found
I like how quickly the Dems attack. All he did was suggest the idea, but to them Trump has already circumvented all protocols and as the ‚Äúdictator‚Äù (they claim he is) already made it law.
My understanding is that even if he cancels the election, he still will not be President come Jan. 21. There is some debate about who that falls to but it will not be Trump or Pence.
Or we can be like Heman Cain, and let Trump kill us.  Don't wear a mask, attend a Trump rally and die. Trump doesn't care so long as he can fluff his ego and sell a few hats and t-shirts. Blame the right for the extention of the Trump virus.
no, you really haven‚Äôt... you aren‚Äôt even smart enough to know they‚Äôre targeting those elected gop trump supporters... again, go suvk off bernie.  the adults are working here...
How's it feel to want Mr. tRump. Orange jumpsuit will go with your face and hair.
Lol, Twitter shows the world who is who. Unless you are part of the one percent, anyone standing up for Trump has no scruples, is dumb and racist.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
TRUMP dosent have any friends he dosent have to pay in one way or another.
‚Äúwhat I‚Äôve seen firsthand is that the most violent behavior overwhelmingly comes from the federal agents, &amp; indeed the most serious injuries have been suffered by protesters. Your federal tax dollars paid to shoot a man in the face‚Äú - #Portland

Donald Trump‚Äôs Campaign Is Pretending There‚Äôs No Pandemic   The Trump‚Äôs campaign has aired 63,000 ads about crime and zero ads about coronavirus this month
Trump needs to be called out on his claims of voter fraud by mail in voting. He can never answer the What where when, because if he did the fact checks would show he is lying one more time to protect his interests
So Trump wants to push back the election because it‚Äôs ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù due to the pandemic, but schools are supposed to open? Are you freaking kidding me?
bet you were a bernie bro too, weren‚Äôt you ?  biting off your nose to spite your face.  these people have done more to defeat trump than you‚Äôll ever do.  THAT IS THE POINT. smfh
Bad ideas have been a commonality for the tRump administration

Mail-in voting is a total disaster.   This is üíØ the Democrats‚Äô plan; create chaos, get the courts involved, frustrate Trump, eventually get things to SCOTUS.
She's a perfect compliment to Trump.  Hypocrisy with no bounds.
Trump has had a lot of bad days this year, but this one has got to rank right up there. It really feels like the wheels are completely falling off right now
Trump is an existential threat the America and the US CONSTITUTION.  Vote like your life depended on it...because it does.

You have summed up their hypocrisy in perfect terms. It is not enough to vote Trump out. Every elected official who protected Trump or followed him knowing it was a disaster for the country has to go with him!
I take pride in the fact that I can have experience in 1 area and still seek to be educated in another. That aside, the Trump administration is getting blatantly desperate to rile up what's left of their loud, racist base. You have to see it to believe it.
Dangerous and despotic. I am less troubled by this predictable behavior from Trump than I am about the 90% of Republicans who have supported him from day one.
Worst economic quarter in US history Herman Cain died  Trump threatened to delay the election  One of these things is a distraction from the others
Isn‚Äôt this the very reason the our government has its own CDC? Our health should not be tied to someone‚Äôs business deals. Please can we get Trump out if destroying our lives- literally.

My only question though is why would a man who lived through poverty and such difficulty yet still rose to be so successful and a thoughtful being would defend and support such an evil and cruel individual like Trump?
Personally I don't want anybody to die from the Virus.  But today tens of thousands are dying because of Trump.   Millions are infected because "its a hoax" followed by not wearing masks.     Mr. Cain is just one example ....   Trump won't shed a tear ... Dont / Wont care..

So now Trump is saying it is not safe to hold an election but demanding you send your children back me to school. Does everyone understand now that Trump does not give a flip about you or your children?

What Trump has done today, saying he should delay the election has spurred the Nation to rise up more than ever. Trump has admitted that he is Losing. Let‚Äôs Go America. Don‚Äôt be distracted. Don‚Äôt be afraid. VOTE November 3rd! #TogetherWeWin #TogetherWeRise #AmericaOrTrump

Donald Trump murdered Herman Cain. And about 150,000 others. And you're an accessory.
Which part of this did Romney get wrong? Spooky how right he was
Herman Cain, a former GOP presidential candidate and Trump campaign surrogate, has died after being hospitalized with COVID-19.  via
Distraction;  "Trump's election delay threat is a purposefully-timed distraction to divert attention from the 32.9% reduction in Q2 GDP, the 1.43 million new unemployment claims and the 150,000 Americans who have died from coronavirus under his watch."
Do you honestly think anything Bolton could have said at the impeachment hearings would have flipped 18 Republican Senators to vote against Trump?  4 or 5 maybe but 18?
One less trump vote
Nope. And as  said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt delay an election you think you can win. Trump has just made an admission today.‚Äù #TrumpIsLosing  #TogetherWeWin
Ahhhhhh now I see why Trump is saying dumb shit. He doesn‚Äôt want to talk about our impending recession
No we accuse Trump we don‚Äôt care at all that you stand by this sex molester, bigot, American soldier bounty Traitor, Draft Dodger, snake oil bleach salesman, Tax cheat, American Pandemic Death Hoax orchestrator! No he has no chance but you stand by him! That‚Äôs your loss!
Please.... Trump has no self control or impulse control. He is willfully ignorant as to how our government works and he does not care. He doesn‚Äôt care about Covid or deaths caused by Covid. All he cares about is money and power. He does not deserve to be President. #voteblue
Resign, Donald J. Trump. Pass it on.
Exactly. Don‚Äôt let Trump distract or try instill fear by saying he wants to delay the election. #TrumpHasFailedAmerica 150,000 DEAD Americans from Covid-19 and over 4Million Sick with #TrumpVirus!

Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
Trump's stupid attacks are a national security issue
On March 3, 2020, after Xi Jinping was named President for life, Trump said "maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day."     On April 24, 2020, Biden said " ‚ÄúMark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow"  Today is someday.
The war of words will get going as we get closer to November 3rd   Good. Trump's alligator mouth is Biden's best supporter.

Contractor donated $$ to trump after he initially lost the fed contract, from my understanding. He was awarded the contracts afterwards.
This is the actual preview of the contractor's work who lost the fed bid to build the wall, but suddenly was awarded the bid after giving trump a donation (from my understanding). Pay for play. Built w no environmental regs?!
This is a fact. However, the contractor paid trump for his fed contracts that he lost his bid initially. The fed contract might have even been awarded to a different contractor with the initial winning bid.
This one was funded by crowd sourcing. From my understanding, this contractor lost his initial bid to build the wall. He was awarded a very large fed contract after paying trump to play.
I believe you're right. This contractor did get fed contracts after losing his bids. He donated $ to trump &amp; now has large fed contracts. I stand by my comment.
Actually, this contractor lost bids for the walls until he gave a generous donation to trump campaign. The contractor also wantonly violated environmental regulations years ago in pristine waters.

Not to legitimize Trump's claims, but he is obviously going to flood the election w/millions of counterfeit mail-in ballots, many of them containing talcum powder or, heaven forbid, the real deal, to contaminate, delay &amp; obfuscate the process.  How are we planning to combat this?

I STRONGLY Suspect, Trump was Kicking THEIR ASSES on Trade and Planning TO BRING BACK JOBS and STOP THEIR THEFT of Technology, AND they KNEW with HIS BOOMING ECONMOY he would BLOW the DEMORATS AWAY, THEY NEEDED to KILL OUR ECNOMY! And it JUST MIGHT WORK!
And he can't move the election. ‚¨áÔ∏è
And now it sounds like Trump might even be bumping up against his limits with them. He‚Äôs trying to single-handedly change the constitution, and McCanna won‚Äôt have it because he‚Äôs crossing over into Mitch‚Äòs jurisdiction.
blames Democrats for cutting jobless benefits. You mean Moscow Mitch won't bring the Democrats Bill to the floor, they asked for more money.The Republicans are the ones that's putting a monkey wrench in this stimulus.üòûüòû
Obama needs to say these things in the open. He‚Äôs our most powerful spokesman and he‚Äôs been publicly reticent too long. #MB
Absolutely not. And neither is Trump.

. isn't a Democrat. He's a Republican in disguise. We must vote him out. It is scary how far up Trump's ass he is.
Maybe focus on the virus first.  That should have been the only thing you focused on and not wearing masks didn't help that, did it.  Trump in TX which is worse than NY and no masks once again.  He wants to kill us!
Did The Onion get this from Trump‚Äôs new medical advisor? ü§£
Remember when Biden claimed Trump would look for a way to delay the election and the Whitehouse called him a conspiracy theorist...because I do.
COVID 19 is culling Trump's voting base.   Keep doing the big elbow to elbow events.  Ask Herman Cain how much he enjoyed them ... Oh wait... you can't because he died from COVID-19.   You all are IRRESPONSIBLE and COMPLICIT.
So Trump is whining about mail in voting. Afraid if fraud. Sure he knows enough about fraud to fill a book.
I can‚Äôt stand Trump. I am glad to place blame at his feet, but in the end, I believe Herman Cain is ultimately responsible for his own death. He had access to the same information we all did. He chose to not wear a mask.
How many states been doing it for decades, years, without an issue? Trump makes it one, puts one of his followers in the highest Postal position and we expect him to slow the mail down, its just like the testing. You're an idiot and a loser follower.  He can't move election!
Congressional Republicans don't want to include money for a new FBI building in the coronavirus aid package.  who may have a corrupt motivation, apparently doesn't care what they want.
Trump has never told a joke in his life. He has no sense of humor nor the brains to tell one.
You don't expect someone in Trump's adminstration to actually DO something for people not-Trump, do you?
claims he's signed executive orders that will lower the cost of prescription medications. It'd be great if that were true. It's not.
Trump can‚Äôt delay the election, experts say By Colby Itkowitz
Since Trump tweets are so often explained away as "jokes", maybe he should resign his current job and become a standup comic.
Will they ever learn? Why can‚Äôt we get it, these people aren‚Äôt very intelligent, if they were they would listen to the doctors, and scientist begging them, day after day to put on a mask.
Med prices are only lowered if you have medicare, all others too bad, keep paying exuberant costs, because trump dont care about you. Just likes saying he did something for you when that's not quite exactly true.  Be honest donnie, not everyone got lower Rx pricing.
There is no other way of saying it.  He will do anything to win The GOP will use the chaos resulting from mail in ballots  The only way to avoid this is Biden winning in a landslide in many states for this to work.
My husband takes hydroxychloroquine twice a day for his rheumatoid,  his doctor specifically says, he can still get covid and it will kill him because of his lung disease. Doesn't keep it away and doesnt make it go faster. Just taking meds to make trump feel right. Its idiotic!
There is a step when states send ‚Äòcertified‚Äô electoral results to Congress.Even if there are 2 delegations,Nancy can accept Biden electors if they won the state.Trump can sue in the courts while Biden wins. Trump can‚Äôt cheat to a win so he wants to cancel. #reversethedystopia
This is just another diversion and he is setting it up so when he loses he thinks he can contest the results.  We must vote blue by the millions so there are no questions. This pos has to go. Four more years Of trump and the US will have to file for bankruptcy.
really wants to be a dictator. Such a corrupt unqualified, clueless man. He was voted in by fraud, &amp; interference by a foreign country. And remember Republicans are enabling him. Blue Blowout. And remove his enablers with him
Then why has it been shown to be effective in Europe?  One reason.  They don‚Äôt have Trump.
This same dialogue is being spread and I've seen it over and over. I'm not voting Biden so if they felt like stopping Trump was so important, dems should have put in a candidate that people would vote for.
Trump The Disaster  ‚ÄúInstead of reducing the $19.9 trillion debt he inherited to zero within 8 years like he promised, Trump‚Äôs... sent the total debt soaring to $24 trillion in his first three years.‚Äù  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
An simple addition to a BS axiom I heard when in college.  "When you're young, if you don't vote Democrat you don't have a heart.  When you're old, if you don't vote Republican you don't have brain."  Well...  If you vote for trump a second time, you don't have a soul.
For example: I've been voting Green party for almost 18 years, now, but I just cant let Trump win. I'm biting the bullet and switching my vote  from Green to Biden. We cant let have Trump have 4 more years!
Republicans could make it worse by delaying more coronavirus relief.Does this surprise anyone?  If he stays around, there will be no return for our democracy. ‚¨áÔ∏è
Trump‚Äôs lack of knowledge about the Constitution STILL amazes me. I miss having a educated president.
While I‚Äôm neither agreeing nor disagreeing with you, I don‚Äôt see how that has anything to do with why or how we should expect our political leaders to do better and not lie to us. She lied and ‚ÄúTrump lies too,‚Äù or ‚ÄúTrump lies more‚Äù is simply not an excuse for her lies.
No they say they are switching their vote from the green party to Biden Biden with intent of stopping Trump.
Nonetheless, with Barr's ambiguous answer in the hearing, he set up Trump to issue an order delaying the election, the October surprise. It will end up in court. Trump doesn't care if he has no authority. When has that ever stopped him?
#NonHoax--BREAKING: Herman Cain, former Republican Presidential candidate has died from Coronavirus. Cain contracted COVID at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa Rally, along with several other Republican politicians.
Totally agree, Trump and &amp; Crew must be held accountable. Arrest warrants issued, passports rescinded, all of it. BUT  cannot be involved, except to immediately determine a new DOJ AG. We cannot have the optics of a banana republic. All prosecutions must go through #DOJ.
They are switching their vote from Green to Blue to vote trump out no matter how much they dont want to. But it's always the same dialogue. Like they're all given the same script and they follow it. Right now that script is: I've been green for years and years and now I'm blue.
Trump trying to move the election just because they want to secure the in person voting is the dumbest thing I've ever read
Freedom of the Press does not mean freedom from scrutiny. The media has been and is problematic on their reporting if Trump. When you normalize him we lose.
He made the mistake of trusting trump!
It continues to astound me that Americans do not give a fuck about killing millions of civilians halfway around the world. Bush started it, O-bomb-uh freaking EXPANDED the wars into 3 new countries &amp; out bombed Bush by more than 50,000 bombs, and Trump is continuing the carnage.
I don‚Äôt trust Trump. I believe black people when they say they experience racism.  My problem is that I also believe the black people who tell me they don‚Äôt. But they must be the ignorant crap spewers to whome you refer in another tweet. So, I digress.
You mean like Trump, who votes Absentee/early paper ballots, has done so for years, even prior to this disastrous presidential clusterfuck. It was ok for him, but not for us? üñïüèº
Since when does Trump give a crap about laws or the constitution?
No, Trump and his family cannot just go on their merry way. In spite of Trump, the Rule if Law still means something. No one, not even the President of the United States is above the law. #RightMattersHere

Trump is a Democrat now? Cause it was at his rally that Caine caught the virus. He had to sign a covid waiver to go to it.
Bush gave he‚Äôs eulogy. It‚Äôs sad that trump sees Democrats as the enemy.  Smh.
Watch for Trump to issue a last-minute executive order delaying the election. The real October surprise. Barr set this up for him in the hearing. It'll end up in court. Never mind he doesn't have the authority. When has that stopped him?
Does anyone think this tweet Trump did about waiting for election till its safe might be his restored republic move with the new elections? Just a thought. Charlie said it will be like nothing we have ever seen.
Donald Trump suggests delaying election because of mail-in voting  ‚ÄúNot a chance. I would swim through a river of virus infected diarrhea to vote this asshole out of office. No delays!‚Äù #MB  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
And when he says otherwise, and surrounds himself with federal troops.  Takes it to the supreme court and the whole of the GOP is behind him?  If you haven't noticed, Trump doesn't care about "legal".  Only about what he can get away with.  he doesn't give up or give in.
GOP loyalists in state and local positions can and will do everything in their power to limit voting.  Trump will then declare the election invalid.  He will not step down.  He will not go quietly.  98% of the GOP will support him.
New Polls Show Trump Gaining Ground On Biden In Battleground States -- LAND-FUCKING-SLIDE
Trump doesn't have the power.  But- GOP loyalists in state and local positions all across the country do... and they can pull back/make it difficult.  If enough people aren't permitted to vote, then Trump will "declare" the election invalid. There is no bottom.
if I have to crawl on my stomach thru an ocean of covid and idiot trump supporters I WILL VOTE! #WeWillVote

Friendly reminder: Herman Cain's death by covid-19 related illness is no more nor less important than the other 150,000 deaths that our government's ineptitude has killed. For a wartime president, Trump certainly is an abject failure.
#HermanCain dies from #Covid19
Nah. Joe is the reason for most of the shit happening. Trump is just being a child with an army. I'm not voting for someone I dont agree with any longer
So in addition to the racists who support Trump, there's a contingent of mentally incompetent charlatans. Or as more commonly known, crazies.
Time to point out, once again, Trump has voted by mail in the past...he knows he‚Äôs losing and will do anything to stay in power. He‚Äôs a scared, weak child who‚Äôs throwing a tantrum. We must remember to vote in November to get him out.

Donald Trump killed him.
I often wondered why you kept mentioning Cain's hospitalization since Trump's Tulsa rally as there was no information afaict one way or the other how Cain was doing (or so I thought). But You called it rightly, from the beginning.
You nearly made me rip my phone in half. The Virus killed him. Yes, he was more vulnerable to it due to his age but the Virus is what actually killed him. He received this virus from attending the rally Trump insisted on having during a pandemic.
Yeah, I can't get behind the idea that once someone dies they are suddenly to be seen only in a positive light. Especially in a situation like this. He attended Trump's Tulsa Plague fest maskless to show there was no risk, just like everyone else there.

I'm not trying to defeat trump. Biden will do fine on his own. The point is to create a new party and we only need 5% for that
"Being part of a riot" in Trump's America just means attending a protest &amp; being indiscriminately attacked by mercenaries. Most people hurt were doing absolutely nothing but holding signs 7 chanting. BTW, this is what was going on b4 #TrumpGestapo arrived.
Now that is makes every Trump vote that much sweeter.
But a side project of that strategy is starting the green party. We can do both at once, as well as vote Biden into office because the Green party only needs 5%. Biden should be fine without 5%. Trump literally called the army on his people.
Didn‚Äôt the Supreme Court condemn ‚Äòfaithless electors‚Äô to prevent this circumstance. What is to stop Nancy from certifying electors from party who won the state?Win 4 Biden. Trump loses.I think Trump‚Äôs guys considered this&amp;decided to postpone elections. #reversethedystopia

Additionally, there is no nationwide turn to universal mail-in voting, and as much as half of the electorate is still expected to cast ballots in person. And while Trump draws a distinction between mail-in and absentee voting, there is essentially no difference.
Even as a registered Republican, it's clear Trump is the real threat to American democracy.  His mere proposal of a delayed election erodes our democratic processes.  #Election2020 (November)
Trump can call on states w GOP majorities in 2 Houses &amp; GOP Governors to place Trump electors in states where Trump lost. However, New England plus states w Dem Governors get enough electors 4 Biden win.   Bottom line: Trump cancels election or loses power. #reversethedystopia

The question is ludicrous, if you don't mind me saying so, God. Pence may well pardon Trump if he resigns, which is looking like a distinct possibility. But if Trump is defeated as expected, he will be held accountable for his crimes in a court of law, along with his family.
What issues with mail-in voting?? I'm in Arizona and have voted by mail for years. Trump is afraid to lose the election so he is planning ways to fuck with it! He is a traitor to our country.

How did allowing tRump to hold his rally in Tulsa didn't work out too well, did it? I can't muster up any sadness or sympathy for the people who willingly &amp; gleefully attended that event if they get sick/die. tRump is responsible for this death.
You will remembered for dying from C-19 because you went to a Trump rally with thousands of people not wearing masks.
I supported Herman Cain when he ran for President back in 2012.  Shamefully taken out of running by the deep state. Now the same people who took him out will say Trump's rally in Tulsa "caused" his corona virus infection. RIP Herman Cain.
Or you could go to a Trump rally in Tulsa with thousand of people not wearing masks, then end up dying from coronavirus a month later...
RIP or whatever but see what happens when ur a stupid fuck not wearing masks and go to TRUMP RALLYS lmfao

Would Herman Cain be alive today if he did not attend the Trump rally in Oklahoma? You know the answer. this virus is not a hoax. May his family find comfort. #RIP #VoteForOurLives #WearAMask

Reporters should get every Republican, TODAY, on the record about Trump's idea to delay the election.
Thought it was a hoax? Guess he got it at the Tulsa rally. Never one to celebrate deaths of people who aren't TOTALLY abhorrent, but if this isn't karma at its finest for Trump then I don't know what is
If this doesn't get you right in the gut, nothing will. This is what ignorance has wrought. And ignorance is what got us Donald Trump.

Worst economic contraction in HISTORY! Now Trump will really try to rig the election!
It will be interesting to see how Trump spins this unfortunate and unnecessary death in light of his own irresponsible policies. Will he go overboard in honoring him or will he minimize it to avoid any culpability?
So now we got Trump literally killing a person of color with politics. It's not even 8am buds.
Seriously? People follow tRump to keep an eye on what he's up to. Not because they like him, agree with or support him. Please unfollow me. I don't need a stranger giving me ultimatums, threatening me or trying to bend me to her will. That's not the way of the Resister Movement.

Trump isn‚Äôt wrong here
Joy Reid asked you about putin. I think the Fred connection is there but I also feel putin was instrumental in deutsche bank saving the trump organization when no other bank would. If you haven‚Äôt, read Dark Towers-to me a lot of answers there.
"Being There" is going to need updating after Trump.

Here we go. Corruption never ends with Trump.
Remember it's a democratic hoax. Who didn't wear a mask? He did't wear a mask to go to Texas yesterday. Who held open rallies. Who stormed the capital with no masks? Trump is a fuck up who now has a woman spewing BS about aliens and demons. What a joke.
He tried to use trump-brand baby batter as a hair product?
I follow a dr. here who strongly believes tRump has frontotemporal dementia. It explains the way he stands, the mental decline, the weakness, and many other things.
Blah, Blah, Blah. Anyone who pays attention (so not trumps cult of morons) knows that if trump says it, it‚Äôs a lie. If vote by mail is so bad, why do you, your family and your staff all do it? Unless a foreign country can forge the voters signature, it can‚Äôt be falsified.
Your whoe twitter feed is you vemting with a lot of words?  Why ask for permission now.  We all get it, you hate Trump.
Collins you've never been to work for the American people or Maine it is time for you to go. You and Trump and the rest of the cronies
Marcey, Marcey, Marcey! You have been brainwashed. You have confused The Constitution, which Trump took an oath to protect and defend, and Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúmorning constitutional‚Äù are unrelated concepts. Democrats are upset with him because Trump, too, has gotten the two confused.

What on earth?  Did you ever see that worm that gets inside a praying mantis and then just uses it's skelton to move around?  That's what Trump is like, only it's like a Putin worm or something.  He has no sense of personal grooming.
I asked where the percentage came from and it was trump,that‚Äôs all I asked for lol I didn‚Äôt ask for that extra shit I could care less for it. Make sure you read the whole thing befo you try to hop on my shit cuz you sound like you‚Äôre sad and begging for recognition on my tweets
Are you better off now than you were before tRump? How's all that winning working out for you guys?
Me trying to seduce Trump to not run for a second term
Yup, I see it all the time. It is also not totally rare that they are Trump supporters. May sound mean, but it's true.
We are in Germany as guests and allies. We get to have bases on German soil rent free. Maybe they should send Trump a bill. One thing is sure that if the US pulls out they will never be allowed back.  China would love to fill the vacuum in our absence.
so next time i suggest not to sound racist as F you might say you think trump is racist  and leave the white part out

Trump has given in to Putin once again by removing 12, 000 troops from Germany. Whose side is Trump on? Certainly not Americas. Forget the damn election and pull Trump from the White House immediately. He is a right-wing communist nazi
2 vent about trump
With Trump handing Putin more early X-mas present. We must seriously consider disarming the Republican Party and dismantling the White House.

Donald Trump has killed 150,000 Americans, we are having arguably the worst COVID outbreak in the world, and for some reason the whole Republican party is fine with this.
The Republican Party has become a side show on the set of Ancient Aliens. Trump and his idiots are killing us, remove him now! Elevate science and get rid of alien DNA. Eliminate hydroxicholride, witches, sperm and aliens. Especially get rid of Trump!
Donald Trump is the Johnny Appleseed of racism, ignorance, disinformation and hatred.
Not at all. Worse thing is tRUMP and his goons could be in on it. Send seeds to China to a contact and they send it to randomly US addresses. After all, tRUMP's been trying to blame anything on China.
The carcass of America is being laid open by fools like Trump and Ghomert. Putin and his vultures are circling overhead. Trump has his head up his ass with alien DNA and all matter of insanity.  Drag him out of the White House and help make America strong again. Science is needed

Mr. President, Please investigate this crime! No one is talking about it.
Didn't you hear? tRump said it was going to go away soon, just like a miracle. ü§£ü§£
I think they make a special lube just for that. It's that orange shit tRump paints on his face every day.
It's grimly amusing to hear well-intentioned Trump critics complain about how he won't stand up to Putin. For some reason, mainstream political figures don't want to come right out and say that Trump is a Russian asset.
We have to remove Trump immediately. He is the single most dangerous threat to America.
Trump‚Äôs deficits are on his right side, so the stroke damaged the left side of his brain. A left-sided stroke is also consistent with his speech and language difficulties.

In Trump‚Äôs case, he‚Äôs been told the election will be decided in the American suburbs, it appears. Instead of finding out what suburban voters care about, and talking about that, he‚Äôs turning the campaign into one about the suburbs‚Äô survival. ‚ÄúMessage: I care about the suburbs.‚Äù

Tony, It allows more people to vote. That's a fact, and trump is very worried. It gives disadvantaged and disabled people the opportunity to vote. I think what you want is called voter suppression. Just so you know. MAGA! KAGA!
you are highlighting Democrat ‚ÄúWish Lists‚Äù, but not mentioning the FBI Building &amp; the Payroll Tax Resuction Trump has tried to slip into the GOP bill without Mitch McConnell even knowing about it
That is not Trumps voice saying those things.  I am not a fan of his but I am a fan of honesty and truth being told.  I would place a bet that it's dubbed or not Trump saying it.

We were stunned and skeptical when Trump made comments earlier this month eluding to an executive order to provide a pathway to citizenship for #DACA recipients. This is why.
To be clear here, the "U.S." he refers to here are predominantly the followers of Donald Trump, the Republican Party and evangelical conservatives. And they are the ones who should be held accountable for the health outcomes and loss of life that have resulted.

Early mail-in ballots also have the option to drop it in a ballot box at designated government building. There's also the drop off box at the polling place on election day.

Big News: Barr, Trump &amp; Wolf deploying unconstitutional #PraetorianGuard to Detroit, Milwaukee &amp; Cleveland even tho demos petered out weeks ago. Is the abject failure of Portland to be repeated? Welcome to targeted martial law. #reversethedystopia
I would get kicked off Twitter for telling you how I really feel. Let's just say for now that I am so offended by your political ads. Just like below you are playing the China card. Do you know what we really care about? The Trump Virus!Orrr recognize Trump is toast and want him off the ballot in November.
He is supposed to be the Attorney General.  It is crystal clear that he isn‚Äôt.  He is Donald Trump‚Äôs fixer.
How can one be so bereaved for an individual who attended a rally forebode wearing a mask. He was following trumps orders not to wear a mask just to make trump look good before his dwindling cult  Then after he was diagnosed still refused to accept his reckless act as the cause
John Lewis would have been proud. Obama illustrated what lewis work for all his life &amp; now they are trying to reverse it with voter suppression.  is an a-hole! History is so clearly not on the side of the ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù  Trump  republicans have totally destroyed it.
Apparently buying  new drapes will save Americans from being evicted.
Even a Federal Society co-founder is calling Trump a fascist!This is what the republicans get for going a long with  stupidity, incompetence and negligence!!!!!!
HAPPENING NOW: Pres.   holds a briefing at the White House after a bipartisan uproar followed his tweet this morning suggesting delaying the presidential election‚Äîsomething only Congress has the power to do.
On the president's claim that the Russia bounty plot is 'fake news,' Steve Schmidt says, ‚ÄúWe have a faithless commander in chief ... This is a despicable and cowardly betrayal of the ethos of the US military."
President Trump, you‚Äôre fired!
How do u feel about Trump enacting Prison Reform? How do u feel about Trump finally addressing Theq immigration can that has been kicked down the road the past 4 administrations.  The shit u whine about should have been taken care of a long time ago. WHO WAS PRESIDENT in 2016?
Whoa!!
Thank you "President"Obama!You're missedüíîJust hearing your voice is "calming and reassuring in these crazy times!!üåπ
How do u feel about prison reform under Trump? How do u feel about immigration reform. U know? It's been kicked down the road many years in the interest of votes. How do u feel that it is finally being addressed.  U knowAfter the past 4 administrations played kick the can with it
You Republicons are the Corrupted ones ..look at your dad..look at your #Socallpresident  corrupted and a murdered
That coronavirus briefing in which he touted masks, social distancing, etc? Supposed  to be his big political pivot and a change to his attitude on Covid. Less than 5 hrs later he was photographed at Trump Hotel mingling with Rep doners and lawmakers. No masks-next to each other.
Screw Cohen, but I‚Äôll devour this book... Bracing for another #IMPOTUS #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpTweetStorm  ‚Å¶ #TrumpIsACrybaby #NobodyLikesMe #WeWillVote           Michael Cohen Now Allowed to Publish His Trump Tell-All While at Home
Well that‚Äôs my 2 cents as you never see anyone wearing a mask when cameras are rolling. We also know Trump is a germaphobe. His ‚Äúnothing to see here‚Äù rhetoric is for the rest of us peasants, not for him.
Yeah and he was tested the day before as well as right before Airforce 1 was to leave for TX. First one negative, second positive. So definitely Trump is around asymptomatic folks. But we‚Äôre told they have to stay beyond 6 ft and wear a mask unless it‚Äôs a photo op. So ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Remember  and papa were racist back then and now A
FYI:  doesn‚Äôt have the power to unilaterally push back the date of the Nov. 3 election. Under the Constitution, only Congress holds that authority.
This could leave him braindead, but who would be able to tell the difference? And don't forget that light bulb up your rear.Maybe he drinks disinfectant and puts a light into his body, as trump recommends!
SUPPLIED BY? You really think THIS BS has ANYTHING to DO with RACE? Why isnt it ALL OVER the NEWS and TV about the 60 year old BLACK man SHOT in the HEAD for SUPPORTING TRUMP! His Black LIFE DIDNT MATTER! This BLM is TOTAL MAXCIST and TOTAL BS.
Donald trump and his whole generation!
I STRONGLY Suspect, Trump was Kicking THEIR ASSES on Trade and Planning TO BRING BACK JOBS and STOP THEIR THEFT of Technology, AND they KNEW with HIS BOOMING ECONMOY he would BLOW the DEMORATS AWAY, THEY NEEDED to KILL OUR ECNOMY! And it JUST MIGHT WORK!
And he can't move the election. ‚¨áÔ∏è
blames Democrats for cutting jobless benefits. You mean Moscow Mitch won't bring the Democrats Bill to the floor, they asked for more money.The Republicans are the ones that's putting a monkey wrench in this stimulus.üòûüòû
In addition to $1 billion for a new FBI building. ‚¨áÔ∏è
You know it's really bad when ‚¨áÔ∏è
Congressional Republicans don't want to include money for a new FBI building in the coronavirus aid package.  who may have a corrupt motivation, apparently doesn't care what they want.
claims he's signed executive orders that will lower the cost of prescription medications. It'd be great if that were true. It's not.
Will they ever learn? Why can‚Äôt we get it, these people aren‚Äôt very intelligent, if they were they would listen to the doctors, and scientist begging them, day after day to put on a mask.
There is no other way of saying it.  He will do anything to win The GOP will use the chaos resulting from mail in ballots  The only way to avoid this is Biden winning in a landslide in many states for this to work.
This is just another diversion and he is setting it up so when he loses he thinks he can contest the results.  We must vote blue by the millions so there are no questions. This pos has to go. Four more years Of trump and the US will have to file for bankruptcy.
really wants to be a dictator. Such a corrupt unqualified, clueless man. He was voted in by fraud, &amp; interference by a foreign country. And remember Republicans are enabling him. Blue Blowout. And remove his enablers with him
Republicans could make it worse by delaying more coronavirus relief.Does this surprise anyone?  If he stays around, there will be no return for our democracy. ‚¨áÔ∏è
Nonetheless, with Barr's ambiguous answer in the hearing, he set up Trump to issue an order delaying the election, the October surprise. It will end up in court. Trump doesn't care if he has no authority. When has that ever stopped him?
#NonHoax--BREAKING: Herman Cain, former Republican Presidential candidate has died from Coronavirus. Cain contracted COVID at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa Rally, along with several other Republican politicians.
Watch for Trump to issue a last-minute executive order delaying the election. The real October surprise. Barr set this up for him in the hearing. It'll end up in court. Never mind he doesn't have the authority. When has that stopped him?
So in addition to the racists who support Trump, there's a contingent of mentally incompetent charlatans. Or as more commonly known, crazies.
Does Trump understand that only Congress can change the election date? Already Republicans are saying this isn't going to happen. So good luck with that pipe dream.
Trump is trolling the liberals üòÇü§£
BASELESSLY When EVERYWHERE JUDICIAL WATCH has EXPLORED REGISTERED VOTER ROLLS they have FOUND THOUSANDS of DEAD REGISTERD VOTERS THAT HAVE VOTED IN PRIVIOUS ELECTIONS. BUT Trump's accusations ARE BASELESS? GD. PROPAGANDA.
TRUMP WAS kicking CHINA'S ASS, And GUESS what Happened! A Mysterious VIRUS WAS BORN in China, THEY LIED about it, They BANNED TRAVEL Internally BUT CONTIUNUED IT ITERNATIONALLY KNOWING it would SPRED IT! Oh did I mention THEY ARE COMMUNIST? and THEY HATE US! You THINK MAYBE??
PURE PROPAGANDA to PROMOTE Lies that IMPLY the economic DISASTER is the Administrations FAULT and The Virus is not the TOTAL REASON! IT IS! The economy was ROARING before the VIRUS AND EVERY SANE PERSON KNOWS IT. Trump had RECORD Results. AND WE KNOW IT!
I am in absolutely no way a Trump fan. But the troops that are moving are actually a small percentage of those there. They are relocating the F-16 flight to Italy and a refueling squadron to England from Spanghalem. Both are going to existing bases.
White supremacists control WH &amp; US Senate led by McConnell, Graham &amp; Grassley. Police  unions are controlled by White men married to white women.

Democrats are idiots. I voted for Warren but can‚Äôt wait to vote for Biden. Heaven forbid we can‚Äôt project an air of optimism about voting out Trump.
Two Senators.  Fifty-one Trump toadies.
You're great at throwing out statements about Biden, but you NEVER back them up. You have no clue that you're a big joke, or possibly a stupid Russian troll. You're failing to convince anyone to support Trump. Give it up.
McSally's trashing Kelly for his support of China, business with China and getting rich from of China. McSally isn't campaigning on issues. She brags about supporting all Trump does. Kelly is for health care, jobs, Soc Sec, Medicare &amp; Medicaid, military &amp; Covid aid.
When Trump bans Muslims, builds a wall to keep brown people out, makes fun of a disabled reporter, throws paper towels at Puerto Ricans devastated by a hurricane, yet pardons his whitey-white criminal friends, it's pretty obvious Trump is a full-blown racist.
'THEY'  Are Using this MAXCIST BLM Movement to Intimidate, scare, and create anxiety! ,they WILL right up until the election! Sell the IDEA that THEY WONT STOP if Trump is RE-Elected! Make no mistake A vote for Biden is SOCIALISM and TRUMP is Democracy TRUMP MUST WIN or we LOSE!!
Really?  You support Trump‚Äôs moronic racism?   I wouldn‚Äôt have thought that from your profile.
And why assume that Trump is even involved? Way too much inference-observation confusion going on these days.
Trump WAS KICKING THEIR ASSES! Roaring Economy, Fixing Immigration JOKE!, Kicking China's ASS on trade, Fixing TRADE LAWS EXPOSING the "SWAMP" THEY HAD to DEFEAT HIM or HE would DESTORY"THEM" CHINA CREATED the VIRUS, LIED, SPREAD IT! No the MEDIA is KILLING TRUMP! THEY ARE EVIL!
Yes it will be IF YOU AND YOUR CORRUPT COLLEAGUES SUCCEED in defeating TRUMP WE WILL DESTROY the ECONOMY, BANKRUPT WITH PRINETED MONEY SLIDE INTO SOCIALISM UNSUSTAIABLE, ULTIMITLY Communism! But You will be DEAD so YOU WONT KNOW OR CARE!
This is SO TRUE I am Embarrassed to LIVE in America AT THIS TIME!  THE RADICALS as I say the INMATES are Running the ASYLUM. They Hate Trump Because HE WILL DRAIN the SWAMP! The Corruption that CONTROLS DC. They MUST DEFEAT HIM!
across America!!  continues to disrespect another American icon. Racism and hateful behavior takes over . Trump claims to make America great? He cannot even pay his respects to a CIVIL RIGHTS GIANT!  Trump has shown to be nothing more than a very small COWARD!!
I don't know about all the reactionary "Marie Antoinette" references, though.  be congenitally tone-deaf and as unwittingly opportunistic, but she's no Marie Antoinette. Nobody will remember anything she did or didn't do 300 years from now.
They hate your guts..You are corrupted and you lets us down with the #TrumpVirus
You are the liar.the cheat. Traitor and the fraud..He loves to stir, out of envy, for a scientist, who tells the truth.
A handful of recent polls show Joe Biden leading  in a number of key states. Arizona: Biden 49, Trump 44 Texas: Biden 48, Trump 43 North Carolina: Biden 50, Trump 46 If we can hold on to these leads, we‚Äôll defeat Trump &amp; elect a wave of Democrats up &amp; down ballot.
The look on barr's face says it all Arrogance and disdain drips from him While he's shown the truth, he expressionlessly scribbles notes There is Never a glimpse of genuine emotion that can be discerned Truly predatory
It only applies to Roger Stone and others similarly situated with knowledge of facts that Trump can‚Äôt let come out.  WilliM Barr is one of the two most corrupt Attorneys General in the history of the United States.  John Mitchell was the other.  He deservedly went to prison.
I could tell you why nobody likes Trump but I have better ways to spend the next two hours.
Trump continues to support
If Trump sold his soul to the Devil, Satan got the short end of that deal.
Oh come on man! I mean Kelli.... quit drinking the GD koolaid that trump and the GOP is spewing out to you underlings! Have a mind of your own... please... because you are killing people of Arizona.
Up to now trump has been at times entertaining but mostly horrifying and deplorable. Now he‚Äôs just plain boring, recycling the same old BS.
hell yes ! he trash talked Trump since day 1!
This is who the republicans got running this country. trump and barr are the worst of the swamp. I want the republicans to take responsibility for what is happening in America.

Murderer Trump is still pushing hydroxychloroquine on Twitter because he has $$ ties to the medication. UN F-CKING BELIEVABLE!
Does Trump realize that a loud recording of taped boos can go over the speaker system even if there are no fans? Fan noise is being aired at most of the ballparks. Wouldn't it be fitting if he was booed by nonexistent fans if he showed up? #TrumpIsALaughingStock
Conversely does having sex with real demons cause nightmares? Asking for Trump administration wives, especially Melania and Ivanka.
The RADICALS WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE IN a DEPRESSED and DSICUTED MOOD! Keep the TRUMP BOOMING ECONOMY SHUT DOWN To FORCE FRAUDULENT MAIL IN VOTEING. ALL Experts agree it is LESS HARMFUL to Children to OPEN Schools THAN it is TO KEEP THEM CLOSED. THOSE ARE THE FACTS. PRESS WONT PRINT.
Trump never intended to throw out a pitch at a Yankees game. Probably just made it up because he's jealous of Fauci. #Trumpelthinskin is a laughingstock, a joke of a man. #TrumpIsALaughingStock
This is one of my favorite names for Trump. I've used it since he became president*. He's a laughingstock. A sad joke of a man. I pity him. #trumpethinskin

Really Martha?  You were all in for no mask for Trump‚Äôs visit.  You, Governor Ducey and Rep. Lesko set a very poor example.  Anything to suck up to Trump.  Now Arizona has 163,827 cases of COVID-19 and you are belatedly urging people to wear a mask.  This isn‚Äôt leadership.
Ted, you may have missed this. You are self-absorbed. Let me help. We are in the middle of an epidemic.  150,130 Americans have died of COVID-19 in less than 5 months. 30 million Americans are unemployed.  Many businesses that have re-opened have no customers.  Complain to Trump.

How many others will have second thoughts &amp; think, like they did in 2016, "The polls show Trump losing, so I don't need to vote."? Let's be honest, Biden doesn't exactly have the star power Obama had.  Enthusiasm will depend on how much voters hate Trump, rather than like Biden.

That. And I think of plausible deniability. They've been at the forefront of judicial nominations under Trump. REALLY BAD ONES in most cases. Can't quite figure out why this is the final final last straw.

It's pretty low that Trump could not even show up. But we all really know why.
To bad our governor is doing his part and playing his role as a leader. Arizona didn't have the right person for the job during this pandemic. History will tell the tail indeed of the Trump subordinate that was Arizona's governor during the pandemic.

Trump's encouragement. In July 2020, privately funded wall associated with this organization was reported to be eroding. Trump distanced himself from the group, despite his administration having awarded it a $1.7 billion contract.  #TrumpTheDisaster
Wrong! I‚Äôm a former Trumpster.  No more. Just pointing out that Trump came into office with definite things he wanted to work on, and is doing it. (Refreshing!) But there‚Äôs too much division and trouble to vote for him again.
By May 2020, only 16 miles out of 194 miles of wall constructed under the Trump administration was not replacement fencing. A private organization called We Build the Wall has constructed 0.5 miles (0.80 km) of new wall on private property near El Paso, Texas,   2/?
Trump is killing us daily but stupid #NeverBiden Bernie Bros are more concerned about Biden mispronouncing a word. Idiots!
I guess people outside the GOP have to judge the Republican Party on those elected officials, who could step up, who could impeach. And they have been ALL in on Trump. Also, we keep hearing 90+% support for Trump. You don't hear massive GOP anti-Trump voices on big matters.
You hypocritical liar. What about the other 150,000 who have died because of trump's utterly incompetent handling of the pandemic?
I wonder what trump and Russia have on the GOP??? Hmmm
Another lie.  December 17, 2019, acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Mark Morgan stated that 93 miles of barriers had been built during the Trump administration; according to CBP, at least 90 miles of that replaced existing structures.  1/?

This started when the far right co-opted the Tea Party movement (which itself was unstable enough to let it happen) and actual conservatives were primaried out by far right nationalists. Trump is the culmination of that. And what got us here has to be burned to the ground.

Trump supporters love to say that the world is laughing at democrats. I am in Europe and I can confirm that the US is being laughed at, but it's not because of democrats - it's because of Trump and his supporters.

That‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôve read it. Dems want to give us more money lol biweekly checks for those not working. Not a one or 2 time payment. You did see Trump give out relief to businesses that didn‚Äôt need it in the last stimulus bill right?

I simply cannot believe that Trump pulled us out of WHO in the middle of a pandemic!
No. Because a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for trump.
So I like this article. What is says is the popular vote election is not required by the constitution. What is required is the Electoral College meeting and voting.   Somebody needs to do the math and determine how many States would send tRump electors if there was no pop. Vote?
The failure of Trump's campaign is not just Trump.  Which is obvious.  It's his base. They are realizing they are complicit in killing us.

This is the least of our worries. He who holds the office holds the power. All trump has to do is declare the results invalid and then it's a scotus decision.
Not everyone in BLM have the same points of view. You can‚Äôt say the leader is bad so they all are. Trump is the leader of the most powerful country in the history of the world. He has done nothing beside dereg hemp and help lower drug prices. (Which just happened)

How did Trump kill them?  People knew to wash their hands, socially distance, etc., since March. So Trump can control if 330 million people do that??
Yes, it is. So what? Trump's supporters don't care and there are enough of them to re-elect him IF there isn't a significant effort to elect someone else. No one cares if this administration does something criminal.
If RNC dumps Trump because he's a loser, its going to be harder for Biden.  IMHO.

That‚Äôs not true. Trump downplayed the virus, but he also can‚Äôt control if 330 MILLION people choose to wash their hands often, or socially distance correctly. Everyone was told to do that since March. Lots have died since then.
It‚Äôs wild to think that even if Obama WAS a complete shit show it‚Äôd still wouldn‚Äôt hold a candle to Trump
Obama put preotectiins in place for Trans people. But since Trump wants to rollback everything Obama touches, that means to remove protections for Trans. So yes, Trump hates trans people.
He was sharing the Dr who are using it in the front lines and saving people. You do not trust that dr because she is Nigerian, are you a racist? If so, the next day they had a white Dr lady say the same thing. The regime works and is a safe cure. Dnal Trump Jr just forwarded it.
Remember when Trump banned trans people from serving their country in the military? Something he purposely avoided himself.

Oh, so you want Trump? Some of you might come back at me. Hell no! I am just stating the facts. Obama was TERRIBLE on immigration.   "Oh, but he gave you DACA." Others will say. He gave us what we fought for as an undocumented youth movement for years.
Trump probably likes skill based matchmaking smh
It‚Äôs funny that if there is election fraud, they assume it‚Äôs going to be ‚Äúthe Dems‚Äù when it‚Äôs trump who is dead set on supressing the vote to cheat (AGAIN)

That's so awesome. I can't imagine what it's like. Were you always conservative? Or vote for Trump first time? What made you like Trump? No judgement. I am just curious about what you experience.

Somebody should suggest to Trump that he should go out and campaign for the Republican Senate candidates in the swing states. We‚Äôll see how funny they think that one is.
Agree. Trump‚Äôs a terrible speaker. And he‚Äôs selfish &amp; obnoxious. But I like how he ran for office knowing what he wanted to work on. Immigration, Europe taking advantage of us $$, getting vets timely medical care, removing red tape/duplicate regs that hurt business,  trade, etc.
And if you‚Äôre a Trump supporter, pretty sure you could give a shit about Lewis. Gtfo.
All things considered I'm relieved that the reaction to Trump's election tweets today has been pretty reasonable. Don't see many people pushing his rhetoric other than the usual bad actors.
Then I guess trump shouldn‚Äôt be trying to delegitimize his win, if he‚Äôs so confident he can beat Biden.
Oh but Trump was over the line in the Rose Garden....can‚Äôt wait to see how great they all say this üí© was!
Yeah, well, if Trump wins and the Republicans keep the Senate Obama just handed them the justification they need to kill the filibuster...if McConnell kills the filibuster TOMORROW, for that matter, he can just point to Obama now. How about wait until you win next time...
Great call tRump. Because this is so important to you we know you‚Äôll do everything in your power to fully fund the USPS!! Awesome - ur brilliant!!!  (So easy to turn your words back on you)  #EveryoneHatesTrump
Not Yang. Yang has NO government experience and doesn't grasp how the government actually works. He still thinks it can be run like one of his start-up ventures, and one of the lessons we should have learned from Trump's disastrous turn is that it doesn't work that way.

The infamous democrat hoax that Trump talked about
I've been saying for the last year that Trump will try his hardest to retain his presidency, even attempt to serve a 3rd term (if he won in November). He sees how awfully he's doing in polls and he's trying to call on his devoted followers to campaign to delay the election.
Whilst everyone is focused on the trump disaster, neoliberals are actively seeking their own destruction. The people we used to depend on are silent and that's cowardice.
tRump is a joke. How disingenuous this bullshit used by his administration.  Oh he's joking.  Then asked later I'm never kidding . 4 more years of him  I swear I'll move.

Ya know what fucking baffles me? I‚Äôve seen Trump get so much shit for the past 5 years. No one in my social circle likes him. But I still can‚Äôt fathom why so many people admire him?? If Trump is the worst human being alive, why did over 60 million Americans vote for him in 2016?
You're all talk because you're facing a tough election otherwise you're in Trump's pocket.

I think the thing that low key makes me most angry about trump in hindsight is that even if it‚Äôs just by 1% I hate George Bush Jr slightly less...it‚Äôs only 1% less but it still infuriates me how by comparison trump is literally the worst potus to ever serve this great nation.

And worst of all, he was raving about how dangerous it would be to elect Trump in the first place, then voted no on impeachments because he was afraid he'd lose his own personal interests.
Trump clearly ascribes to fascist ideology. This is obvious. His entire platform is based around white nationalism.   I dont know how many ways I can explain that just because he isnt literally Hitler doesn't mean he isnt a fascist.
I don't usually agree with GOP leadership but John Thune gets this right. Referring to a Trump tweet about delaying the election.  "I think that's probably a statement that gets some press attention, but I doubt it gets any serious traction."
That's because the engine of our economy is consumer &amp; b2b demand. Everyone knows this.  Now that 10's of millions are jobless, or under-employed &amp; losing everything, Trump still has no COVID plan, &amp; the Senate thinks 200 bucks is enough, what other reaction was possible?

Such poor logic.   No, Trump is not Hitler. Trump having not done the things Hitler has does not make him not a fascist. Fascism is not an action, it's an ideology. By your logic then a low ranking Nazi janitor wasn't a fascist either because he wasn't Hitler.

The only person who can beat Donald Trump in November is Donald Trump
Racist is a no brainer. Rude, condescending behavior.  Being a trump supporter  for sure!
Trump said a  key word there didn‚Äôt he. But you lunatics don‚Äôt want to pay attention listen. Are they paying for these weapons? We had an actual terrorist Soleimani killing people like my son. And you cried about it you sympathized... So you are the lefy you lunatics STFU losers!
How could Donald Trump possibly destroy the post office? The post office has been pretty good at doing that itself hasn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs billions of dollars in debt. How do you destroy something that‚Äôs already destroyed Chris. The mind of a liberal is upside down and inside out ü§™
It's going to take Biden's administration a year or more just to undo all the shit Trump has done.
Ummmm, intelligence.  Why would anyone with half a brain vote for Trump?  Holding on to that "white privilege" tag, maybe?
Trump is attracted to idiots like himself. It is that simple
Voting Trump out is the key and most important thing at this point
I believe that we will be rescued from the hands of the wicked trump/GOP.
I did. trump surrounds himself with yes men, they don't have to be qualified or sane. Birds of a feather flock together.
We are behind you President Trump.   We know you know it and feel it. ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏
This MAY have some credibility if the virus was only in the United States; however, you may have noticed that every country in the world is effected and I‚Äôm pretty sure Trump isn‚Äôt on any ballot except here.
Remember when trump said ‚Äú He respect the Generals‚Äù but later on disrespected them? That is how he is going to treat the Police. A true Con-Man.

The thing that frightens Trump more than losing. . .it's Putin.  Trump has a life planned, in Russia, when he is done here, because if he stays here, he is going to jail.  Kiss up to Putin, for Trump, is preferable to life in prison.
If he says ANYTHING about "Bounty-gate", his handler will give him a spanking.  Putin has Trump on such a short leash.  He would, and did, sell out his own country to keep Putin happy.
Heaing you praise your golden idol trump is a bit rich.
Did your father start all of this Meghan? And you have the nerve to be angry that Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have kind words in turn for your father.  Did your father start all of this and put this country through this? Valerie Jarrett just said he did! I voted  your dad.
Yeah, thanks to your golden idol trump who you have fully supported.
trump can't stand anyone who is better than him, who people love &amp; adore, who is a hero &amp; an icon. He can't even gain respect from people. His jealousy is uncontrolled. The racist doesn't even deserve to stand on the ground that has been occupied by the great John Lewis.
Lmao..  100%  agree with Donald Trump.   is a complete idiot!
If we could only get a mask mandate. Maybe McCrazy you should talk to Ducey. Your puppet leader trump isn't smart enough to issue a mandate. You know this to be true. When fighting a war you need to use everything in your power to win. Or have you forgotten this McCrazy?
That‚Äôs an odd way to look at what‚Äôs happening. You know that innocent people have been getting killed hurt beaten up businesses destroyed. But you‚Äôre worried about Donald Trump and whether it helps him or not. The left is disgusting!
We will vote trump out. Enough is Enough
Trump gonna loose his mind this week. All that faked presidential behavior is all going to fly away like a birdü§£
I have a Trump wall joke, but to be honest it'll just fall flat.
Burning cities to the ground?  You are being a bit dramatic dear.  Trump storm troopers firing on American citizens is fascism at its worse.  He has destroyed our country in 3 years.  The American experiment has failed thanks to right wing, Christian agitators. Founders warned us
These storm troopers, or SS to identify them more accurately, are not wearing identification of any kind so this is a lie.  Protesters are only protecting themselves from heavily armed assault.  Arms should be utilized on both sides if this continues.  Trump destroyed our nation
They have on Trump Gear. Let‚Äôs not forget this. If you  your a racist
Legit. Don't dare question them either or you are transphobic, homophobic, a Nazi, and a trump supporter. XD
Crazy trump is the #LiarInChief

They weren‚Äôt left with that. That‚Äôs been their whole case this whole time. This is a vendetta against Donald Trump.
Trump is engaging China on foreign interference. How about you engage BLM their interference in our elections. That organization with ties to Venezuela if they have ties to Venezuela they have ties to Putin. George you propagandist how about your ties to Putin?

According to the Daily Callout (see below): ‚ÄúTrammell, 60, was gunned down on July 23 near the very spot where he gave a video interview a few hours before explaining why he supported Trump.
Nope it's 80% &amp; approval rating for the whole country is 36%. trump is the only prez in history who has never reached 50% approval.
Listen to yourselves.  You and I are the same age. We have seen phenomenal Presidents. Later on we found out they were crooked, made deals with foreigners not in America's best interest. Trump's not evil, just dealing with the evils of a previous bunch of sneaky  characters.
Maxwell and Putin BOTH know Trump is abhorrent disgusting pervert! They both have all kinds of video and pics. When Trump loses in November, the shit gates will open and we will ALL see what he really is! (Melania leaves him, too!)
I'd rather trump protect our real troops in Afghanistan, instead of outfitting God only knows who in military costumes to incite violence that was finally quietting down. Oregon has the national guard for this kind of thing. Feds. Weren't invited and should leave when asked to.
Citizens of Portland! Stay strong, stay united! The world is watching YOU, and they are judging TRUMP!!!!! You can help BRING HIM DOWN!!!!!
Let Trump get in for 4 more years and find out just how much black trans lives don't matter.
Trump will love it! It's the exact same color as his!!!
Mistakes are a part of life. Except for Donald Trump. Like I said you‚Äôre a strange person that‚Äôs a lot of acrobats in your head to get to that point!
How the hell you come up with defending Trump out of that? Who has Trump/we been listening to? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre going to vote for Joe Biden who doesn‚Äôt even know who he is. Somehow you want Donald Trump to be a president and a scientist. What a strange person you are...
I‚Äôve been smelling that same bullshit since trump took office.
Yamiche, When will one of you ask trump about Putin putting a bounty on our troops? When? Don‚Äôt tweet any nonsense until you do. Our children are out there and you press ( journalist) are asking dumb questions.
He is because we marked his name on the ballot.  For some reason he is the man God gave us for such a time as this and I would never challenge his judgement. And it should be noted that Trump never called a beautiful young lady a Dogface liar.
Hey Trump!,  What goes away quickly??? Huh? Liar. You can‚Äôt go an minute without lying your ass off
Trump wants to send our children back to school. Will you send your kids back to school to please Trump?
When you hear trump say:  So Badly means = it is a LIE.  BIGLY means = it is a LIE. Never Been Done Before = it is a LIE BIG THING means = it is a LIE. Tiny percentage = it Is a LIE. Great means = A Big LIE.   Every word out of his mouth is a lie.

I'm doing the same. I understand that federal agents are taking orders but surely not all of them can agree with what they are doing?  I'm frightened that trump has bigger plans beyond the protests (which is a COTUS right) &amp; I know other people think the same thing. ü§Ø

The Trump administration is trying there best to make this go away. It‚Äôs so sad, he‚Äôs the devil amongst us. We need testing and tracing.
Joe said President Trump is the first racist president we‚Äôve ever had. Yet we have brat children running around the country tearing down statues claiming our country is racist from its inception. Joe Biden giving the eulogy of Robert KKK Byrd and McGovern the Premier racist..

I have no idea what you're smoking but Trump and his minions called the virus a hoax for at least 2 months until the deaths started piling up. Everything was in place for him to succeed and get ahead of this virus and he squandered it all away. No we have rampant unemployment,
I'm not listening to the media I actually read and can look at more than one point of view. The Chinese were working to come up with a free vaccine that everyone could have and instead of helping them Trump is trying to look like all this was his doing.
trump is the prez, Biden is not.Get the difference?

Number one, what about the other 44% who aren't ready for schools to reopen, prob because they don't think its safe?   And how many of your 56% only want schools to open if they know it's safe?   Biden cares about our children, Trump does not. Trump only cares about the optics.
A conservative co-founder of the Federalist Society calls Trump‚Äôs tweet suggesting we delay the Nov election ‚Äúfascistic‚Äù and ‚Äúgrounds for the president‚Äôs immediate impeachment again by the House... and his removal from office by the Senate.‚Äù
That. And I think of plausible deniability. They've been at the forefront of judicial nominations under Trump. REALLY BAD ONES in most cases. Can't quite figure out why this is the final final last straw.
Called a trial ballon to see what happens then of course per Trump says he was kidding.  This is same story mew BS
Trump's response to everything..."You'll be hearing more about it in two weeks."
I guess people outside the GOP have to judge the Republican Party on those elected officials, who could step up, who could impeach. And they have been ALL in on Trump. Also, we keep hearing 90+% support for Trump. You don't hear massive GOP anti-Trump voices on big matters.
You hypocritical liar. What about the other 150,000 who have died because of trump's utterly incompetent handling of the pandemic?
Of course it wouldn‚Äôt be a trump rally for you because TDS is worse than the virus
Pleaseeeee don‚Äôt act like Bush was any better than Trump. He‚Äôs among the worst ever too!
Registration efforts have mostly stalled thanks to COVID. But turnout could still put the race beyond Trump and McSally in this CD. there are now more than 214K registered Dems, if they can hit 70% turnout in the Dems side (80% Dem turnout statewide in presedential is normal)
You would be wise to look objectively at what he has done in a short period of time to help POC. BLM is out there destroying things and not doing literally anything to help. Trump is signing executive orders to actually help POC. Dems promise to get votes, Trump delivers!
Trump said he‚Äôd reales his taxes 4 years ago during a debate.   He hasn‚Äôt.   Why debate someone with no issue lying?
It‚Äôs amazing (I guess not really when you think about it) that  would tweet a two page glowing tribute (obviously written by a staff member because Trump has no soul) about Herman Cain and could only send a short heartless tweet when John Lewis died.
Timcast IRL -  Trump Threatens To Deploy National Guard To Portland As C...  via
Agreed! They are not into facts though. Their hatred of Trump blinds them to their love of country, family,  or fairness to POC. It is sad. Only love cures. Hate destroys.
This CD for a change punched only slightly below weight with relatively good turnout for a midterm. With increase in voter registrations in CD7, and if the Mark Kelly campaign and Maricopa Dems are able to push turnout to 70%, this CD will do some damage to Trump and McSally

That is a damnable lie. We have friends that live in Greece (Katereini) and they wished they had a leader like Trump over there. They want someone who will be decisive to make the economy better for small business as well as large.
Trump and the cruel gutless GOP is what has happened.
I hate communism! Trump is for freedom, Biden is not.

Can I wear my welding goggles? I‚Äôve always wanted to walk around in public with that thing on.
Never heard it from Trump. Know it fails. We can be kinder in our own system. Socialism ALWAYS leads to Communism leads to failure. No thanks.
The second that bad economic report came out this morning, Trump tweeted about delaying the election. He does this every time something happens that makes him look bad. #DistractorInChief
No. Because a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for trump.
The failure of Trump's campaign is not just Trump.  Which is obvious.  It's his base. They are realizing they are complicit in killing us.
We all know there is no scenario, no circumstance in which Trump will accept losing the election or peacefully leave office, right  We all know what it‚Äôs going to come to, right

Trump and Pence say they have done a tremendous job containing Covid-19.   Over 10,000 Tyson Employees Reportedly Test Positive For Covid
Yes, it is. So what? Trump's supporters don't care and there are enough of them to re-elect him IF there isn't a significant effort to elect someone else. No one cares if this administration does something criminal.
I know deeply Christian people, folks with genuine good values, who adore Trump. The worst is my Mormon friends who just don't seem to mind his lack of morals. Truly perplexing.
He was sharing the Dr who are using it in the front lines and saving people. You do not trust that dr because she is Nigerian, are you a racist? If so, the next day they had a white Dr lady say the same thing. The regime works and is a safe cure. Dnal Trump Jr just forwarded it.
It worries me, too. They will not take another loss to Trump. They will do anything to stop it. They proved that when they turned over their party to the Marxist radicals.
Ever wonder why they hate Trump so much? Follow their money.
Can  Trump be charged with manslaughter or be sued in a class-action lawsuit for his blatant and dangerous disregard for human life during this pandemic?  #CrimesAgainstHumanity  #UNFIT  #ETTD
And the democrats want to see Trump‚Äôs tax returns. What a fu-king joke.
Because we were stupid enough to believe the Dems care about our welfare. LOL. They want the economy to fail until after the election. If they win and don‚Äôt bring back the economy they will still blame Trump. They are without morals or ethics. Wake up America!
Anyone else just scroll down when you see Russia Russia Russia in the news..... I feel like.... Maybe after the election.... But I don't think Republicans have the balls to do anything but talk big to TV cameras.... I await justice! Trump can't drain the swamp on his own!!!!!!!!
Everything Trump does is just a "joke" until he does it, but ask him and he'll say "I don't joke".
OK....now do trump &amp; his family!
Trump‚Äôs only hope is for the lefties to over-play their hand, which they seem to be dangerously on the verge of doing so!
MUST SEE: He says he reads all the time (BS) He literally says he comprehends "better than anyone  you've interviewed"  Dear God... It just gets crazier.   Watch "Trump Brags About His Reading Comprehension" on YouTube
Trump killed Hermain Cain with a thing called the Trump virus
Yes actually a lot of things can be assured by people who are knowledgeable.  Trump however, doesn't know anything about anything at all.
Maybe they should call it the Tulsa, Trump rally virus... killing his constituents one person at a time.
Now is this Crime a Day a daily suggestion for trump to put on his "To Do" list?
Trump's Republicans will never oust him from the WH.  Impeachment is a dream that Americans have that believe in the Constitution and the Rule of Law.  Republicans have wiped their asses on the Constitution. They are traitors.   We must take our country back.
Donald Trump is a Russian asset. Trump is destroying America. #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Trump is responsible for 000,000 deaths.  His early lack of action and denial cost us time and lifes.  Fighting masks and saying its Kung Flu, Chinese Flu and then acting like its no big deal while encouraging Gop Gov to reopen...  Yes he is responsible.
Just another Trump lie. Hey Donny! Are those Ghislaine Maxwell papers coming out today? You sound really really scared. How is it to have so much evil stuff that you're scared all the time? Oh yeah - resign.
Such a huge contrast with Trump's blatant self-serving lies during the "coronavirus press conference". Trump is destroying our country. He must be stopped.
WH failure to clean out the deepstate, Trump should call in the head of the army and announce his firing.
You are making the assumption that Trump would feel bad like a normal person.  Problem is that he is NOT mentally healthy and has ZERO empathy.  People are in his life to their to serve or make him look good.   He could careless if anybody dies.  DONT SEND YOUR KIDS TO SCHOOL...

Thousands packed the church for John Lewis's funeral, no worries about Covid 19, people not wearing masks; all listening to  Obama trash Trump.  All racist Hypocrites in attendance!
This knowledge is not based on scientific fact. But the bottom line is that the rally was a perfect recipe for transmission. People not observing social distancing AND no masks. The rally served no purpose but feeding Trump‚Äôs fragile ego. It simply should never have happened.
How is trump crying? Explain
All those people crammed together without them was certainly a recipe for transmission. He was in at least one high risk group. Maybe he shook one too many hands. But everything about that rally sent the wrong message. Its only purpose was stroking Trump‚Äôs ego.
In Trump‚Äôs bunker
Has there been a greater step down than from Obama to Trump?? Almost criminal.
Surprised he didn't use the Sen. Cornyn sham excuse that Trump was"Just Joking" about changing the election date.
So in Trump 2nd term he will appoint 3 more SC and Roe vs. Wade will then be overturned shortly afterwards.  Praise the Lord for he is faithful and just!
Trump should be charged for the murder of Herman Cain
Didn‚Äôt we say he would try this?! Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
See my avatar.  Harris is my prediction and my preference, although i wouldn't mind  as VP either.  She certainly could step into POTUS.  A million times more qualified than Trump.
Trump suffers from diarrhea of the mouth always has
Besides being racist, which it is, ‚ÄúChina Virus‚Äù is grammatically incorrect. It would be like calling the ‚ÄúSpanish Flu‚Äù the ‚ÄúSpain Flu.‚Äù So not only is Trump a racist, he is also an uneducated imbecile.

And if you‚Äôre a Trump supporter, pretty sure you could give a shit about Lewis. Gtfo.
All things considered I'm relieved that the reaction to Trump's election tweets today has been pretty reasonable. Don't see many people pushing his rhetoric other than the usual bad actors.
Yeah, well, if Trump wins and the Republicans keep the Senate Obama just handed them the justification they need to kill the filibuster...if McConnell kills the filibuster TOMORROW, for that matter, he can just point to Obama now. How about wait until you win next time...

tRump is a joke. How disingenuous this bullshit used by his administration.  Oh he's joking.  Then asked later I'm never kidding . 4 more years of him  I swear I'll move.
I think Trump is the spawn of Satan himself, but spreading fake BS like this only harms our cause.
President Trump the Republicans have got to feel like they got in the car with their drunk uncle and he's being belligerent and he soiled himself and they can't wait for an opportunity to jump out of the damn car where to get another driver.
Hey heard u are supporting trump lol

If Trump had worn one, he would have. It was all about following his lead, completely misguided as it was.
And trump hasnt said a thing about it.
So... when tRUMP dies... he DIES ALONE, with a pitiful turn out to his funeral. We'll ALL be CELEBRATING AT HOME.
Biggs. Your false statements about COVID, and support for Trump and his rallies are responsible for thousands of deaths. Mr Cain most likely was infected at a rally. I‚Äôve seen photos of him not wearing a mask. You are pushing a no mask agenda. It all adds up.   #TrumpDeathCult
The absolute dunce cannot even do a condolence tweet without also doing something goofy that makes Twitter snicker for hours on end. This would almost certainly seem like an intentional bit if Trump were not literally the most unbelievably stupid man on Earth.
Ya know what fucking baffles me? I‚Äôve seen Trump get so much shit for the past 5 years. No one in my social circle likes him. But I still can‚Äôt fathom why so many people admire him?? If Trump is the worst human being alive, why did over 60 million Americans vote for him in 2016?
There is debate about who would be President. Some say it will not be Pelosi because she is also up for election. I don‚Äôt really know but I do understand Trump will not be President in Jan. If we do not have an election.
Over/under on combined IQ?
Is this, somehow, completely different than Pres. Trump's rose garden or Rushmore speeches?
Herman Cain, a former GOP presidential candidate and Trump campaign surrogate, has died after being hospitalized with COVID-19.  via
I think the thing that low key makes me most angry about trump in hindsight is that even if it‚Äôs just by 1% I hate George Bush Jr slightly less...it‚Äôs only 1% less but it still infuriates me how by comparison trump is literally the worst potus to ever serve this great nation.
ASK DONALD J TRUMP
For the record. I follow football. College and pro. I took a survey  that's why.  Ok back to stopping tRump.
Isn't it illegal for him to promote shit like this? Hatch Act violation? And guy prob just made a donation, doubt if Trump has ever eaten his pizza.
How about we delay Donald Trump instead. Fuck him.
tRump kind
Hey Trump, GDP still bad. You aren't distracting us from that!  #trumpsGDPnumbersarebad
Trump needs to setup detention camps for rioters and hold em till after election,
Me too, and that is why I am not voting for Trump

Only 30% of the public likes him.... of that 30% Trump holds a rally during a pandemic that may kill some of that % off.....

Trump will always have the mark of Cain on him!

Trump youth group begins deleting tweets mocking COVID-19 after co-founder dies from the virus
Super lefties: I can't believe Trump isn't saying anything about John Lewis, how disrespectful.  Also super lefties: I can't believe President Lock 'em up, President War Crimes, and President Drone Strike are talking at John Lewis' funeral.
Trump partyed with those pedophiles! His photo ops are more important to him than the people he is supposed to be serving! He is not God &amp; doesn't represent God or the good part of our country.
The only way Trump loses is if we turn a blind eye to the cheating that will be done by democrats. You actually think Americans that love this country will willingly turn it over to Marxist democrats without a fight?  You lady are in for a big surprise.
This is going to disappear, like a miracle! The warmer temperatures will make the Trump virus go away! We're at 15 by the end of the week close to zero. Pine Sol syringes, UV light colonoscopy's. Dont believe the GOP, their enablers, or their mouthpieces like Bongino. All Liars.
I am trying out  to connect with my brother and sisters in Trump.  We must not wait ignorantly till the week before election so that they shut Trump down.  You heard it here first.
"MAKE NOISE"!! Don't let Trump alter and CONTROL OUR election!!!
When trump says something ‚Äúscandalous‚Äù (we must delay the election) one has to wonder what he‚Äôs trying to distract your attention from. The media takes the bait every time. What do you think today‚Äôs scandal is covering up?
Over 150k people have died in America. If you think ü§î trump has made America great in his first term...then his base is VERY DITZY. I believe my EYES üëÄ and I see what‚Äôs actually the TRUTH. what do y‚Äôall see?!? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What we need to do is make sure everyone votes to make sure Trump loses by big numbers. There are people who can remove him.
They took their oath seriously.  Trump only takes his mirror seriously.
Funny how mail in voting was never an issue until Trump, who votes by mail, told all you idiots that it was
MLB can't protect players with multiple testing and isolation techniques. Senators, House members, National Security Advisor, tested daily and still they are getting the Trump virus. Nut Jobs want to send kids back to school because they think its about the election. Pathetic!
Respect that Trump wants so badly.  Yet congenitally incapable of honor, altruism,  integrity and Fidelis.  He couldn't join the military he lost his chance. His family name is synonymous with lies, cheating,  mendacity and selfishness.
Ok, Alien DNA? If there are aliens here they wouldn't be talking to Trump. They would be talking to Angela Merkel or Macron. Someone that is highly intelligent. So the DNA mixed with demon sperm is what's causing the Covid-19 outbreak? Who thought this crazy shit up? Good Lord!
Donald j. Trump could care less.
I follow for many of the same reasons, Mr. Ambassador. Charlie‚Äôs not very bright, but I‚Äôll keep following because his tweets are indicators of how cruel and desperate Trump and his minions are at any given time.
I don't blame Trump.  Cain was a grown man and chose to ignore the experts.  He's got nobody to blame but himself.
Trump's silence is thunderous
lmfaooo trump suggest we postpone the election. this is his dictator move right here lol
Trump Tweet CENSORED By Twitter, Don Jr SUSPENDED For Retweeting  via
Vbm is not the problem and is a false narrative. Also true that there has been a lack of leadership on a lot of issues by Trump that he is trying to avoid by calling for a delay in the election. But indicating that he is personally responsible for the economy is a false narrative
The fact #Trump "had no intention" to attend the funeral of a fellow Representative, nah bump that an ESSENTIAL part in the history of this country blows my mind...
Says a supporter of Donald J Trump. LMAO!
Trump is seething with jealousy right now. I'm amazed, frankly, that he hasn't had a stroke!
Whatever Trump says, but the sooner the election is over, the sooner the DS will stop its plandemics, riots, and lawlessness.
The arrest of arsonist who set Phoenix Democratic Headquarters on fire üî• I just knew Trump would come up somehow, shocked he claimed to be Ivankas secret husband Insanity defense started I guess. Sad people like this want to declare war on all non Trumpers
Regis Left $20 Million to Trump Campaign
I'm fully convinced that closures and hiding the treatments for Coronavirus is all about the election at this point. Democrats want Americans to be miserable and even die so they can defeat Trump.
Back then early in Trump's presidency I was in favor of eliminating the filibuster.  But once I read the rules of the Senate regarding it I changed my tune on it.  If it's nuked then the minority has no voice and it hurts all 100 Senators.  What a disaster if they get their way.
Trump wants us focused on this instead of the Q2 economic report that shows a 33% loss to the US GDP.
Ask Trump. We‚Äôre doing fantastic better than anytime in history!!! 150,000 dead folks!! And we‚Äôre not done yet!!!
Shame on any reporter who attended trump‚Äôs fake press event
herman listened to tRUMP  herman is dead don't be a herman WEAR THE DAMN MASK PEOPLE ! ! !
She said ‚ÄùAsside from he's not Trump‚Äù, try again.
House won‚Äôt pass any delay, 20th amendment says if election doesn‚Äôt happen Speaker becomes president on 1/20, so Trump is out on his ass anyway - yay for Civics classes!
won‚Äôt do Shit to help a failing economy. He will back Trump because he is as his name states #MoscowMitch. Americans a dying, are losing their jobs. DO SOMETHING
So typical of liberal democrats. Hijacking a funeral to take pot shots at the President. Keep it up. You're only cementing President Trump's re-election in November. Oh, Rest in Peace Mr. Lewis.
I agree.Personally I want Elizabeth Warren as VP but to be honest, at this point I‚Äôm voting for a rock over trump.Also, I will vote for Biden/Harris.But I also know, they are just stop gap for the next four years.I know they won‚Äôt get re-elected but getting trump out is the goal
Never. Trump is stewing all ALONE feeling self-pity that #NobodyLikesTrump!
President Obama says governor Wallace may be gone but President Trump‚Äôs in office right now!!!
Trump?.
Yes they do. People like Trump. There‚Äôs a reason he won‚Äôt talk about the bounties on American soldiers. Are you pro Russia? Or just anti America?
Trump* :  Safe to send your kids to school;  Not safe to hold an election!!!
Fuck #Trump lying about today !
Watching President Obama thinking THIS is what our country should remember on Nov. 3. Three former Presidents coming together to honor Re. John Lewis, who gave his life to make our country better.  And Trump, calling an impromptu presser to make the moment about him.
‚ÄúTop political editor at Fox News: Trump asking to delay election a ‚Äòflagrant expression of his weakness‚Äô‚Äù - Its about time!!
Yes, projection is exactly what Trump does every day he speaks. You can believe that the GOP will save you but you‚Äôre being proven wrong as I type this. Best of luck to you.
Note to followers for today.  is not allowing me to see most of your replies. I'm not ignoring you.  this is a political attack against the Trump campaign. I am working to get  re- elected.  is working to make sure I cant.
I hope they don't! Hearing  speak words of love, respect, and honor is more important than anything that could come out of Trump's mouth unless it is, "I resign...." amirite?
tRump world makes oaths in the way of making money for said self are to be ignored.
This is another example of the hypocrisy that‚Äôs spews from Trump on a daily basis.
Donald J. Trump will deny he was in Tulsa and deny responsibility.
Appointed (R) Az Sen. Martha McSally will support Donny  j. Trump when ‚Äútold‚Äù.
Ummm he‚Äôs trump
Az gov Doug Ducey will not orderAz  to mask up. He just spoke to the supreme leader Donny j. Trump who is supported by the great Dr. Stella Immanuel MD  (Medical Drunk). No Covid. no masks. They have alien science on their side.
Based off of today's tweet, Donald Trump is shitting his pants regarding reelection
And the insane John Cornyn attempts on Twitter to say ‚Äúoh it was just a joke‚Äù Trump is no joke sir what he‚Äôs done to this country is not a joke 150,000 dead Americans he‚Äôs killed -it‚Äôs no damn joke
Golfing with Trump
I now see Trump supporters complaining about not being allowed to travel to other countries because they're "free" We've done it. In 4 years we've come full circle. Incredible.
Two things:  1) Trump is not allowed? He doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúthe power‚Äù? Where the fuck have people been the past four years?  2) Feels like a trap, like when we all had to say ‚Äútrust the election results‚Äù because Trump said he wouldn‚Äôt, while he was aiding interference in the results.
It is NOT in trump's power to delay our election. The American people will not stand for it. We vote in November.
Pointless.
It's hard to care when it comes to Trump. November 3rd is my goal. To rid the grave national security risk in the White House and bring dignity and honesty and honor to our West Wing.
Too bad he followed trump‚Äôs advice
America should vote NOW! This country deserves better than Donny j. Trump and his Alien family .
Trump has no idea what it take to care for a sick child, he has no idea of the worry and misery.
He‚Äôs a hero / lived the way he wanted ! And went to a Trump rally
Speaket Pelosi WILL NEVER let trump get by with changing the date of the election.
The escalation of the violence perpetrated on the ‚òÆÔ∏è peaceful protestors who organized in Portland came directly from the White House, the violence can be directly attributed to the Dictator in Chief Donald J. Trump.
Trump should read the Constitution. Oh I forgot he does not read. Could it be reading is difficult for him
Well that's awful Constitutional of you. I wonder how much pressure Trump and Putin will put on you to change your tune this time Lindsey?  Once you start selling your honor there is no end to it you know.
Why is the Press indulging this story so much? At a minimum, point out the irony of sending kids back to school, but not voters to the polls. The REAL story is GDP/JOBs report!! Trump needs a distraction.  But good news, KODAK stock is up 1700%
you mean the tea party ?  yep, steve did his job. and he‚Äôs going to do the job now.  and yes, they‚Äôre allies in hating trump.  in policy, no, but they aren‚Äôt trump‚Äôs allies either... try to keep up...
It should be obvious at this point that Donald Trump (especially on Twitter) is erratic and will spout off whatever is on his mind. He doesn't put serious thought or assesses the implications of what he says.
Lets face it, the next six months will be hell on earth until Biden is sworn in.  trump and the  will do everything in their power to totally and thoroughly screw this country out of pure retribution!
Fox is carrying it so Trump has nothing to watch. Maybe he could read the PDB, convene the COVID task force, spend some time with Barron or just do SOMETHING!
So you agree that Trump should use our tax dollars to benefit his Hotel? His personal piggy bank. Read more ...less Fox.
All of u libs are banking on Biden?? That tells me everything I need to know. I will not be able to stop laughing on November 4 when Trump wins his second term
Congress wont. Trump is fucked
He‚Äôs a hard core never trumper and suffers from Trump derangement syndrome big time
Bob, it is unbelievably shocking to me that Trump is not ahead by 30 to 40 points! Your comment is so smug, thinking that the lying msm is giving you all of the news. Sorry to inform you but they are not! They only put out what suits their narrative, withhold the rest.
Yes beautiful remarks. But I can't help but hear subtle undertones of digs at President Trump even at a somber moment such as this.
Trump's repeatedly denies any responsibility for the virus and throws responsibility to the States, yet provides no federal assistance to help states deal with the Crisis and even says blue States are less deserving. Where does the federal government get it revenue from?
I grieve for Herman Cain, and I don‚Äôt appreciate lies being told about anyone‚Äôs death. He had Stage 4 colon cancer in 2006. He died from COVID-19 after attending the Tulsa Trump rally with no mask. #RIPhermanCain #WearAMask
It's always funny watching people who think they know Trump well defend him and say, "he would never do/say such a thing," and then Trump proceeds to do/say that thing. There's a significant gap between who Trump is and what his allies think he is.
That was spot on, it moved me ... so many sick people on twitter saying Trump killed him ! RIP you will be missed
‚Å¶ Is the biggest cry baby on the planet. He can dish it but can‚Äôt take it. He said that Twitter trolling the #TRUMPVIRUS tag is making him look bad and unfair. When was it fair for you to betray your country. #joebiden2020.

So Trump has accomplished more in most 24 hour period than Biden in 47 years lol thanks for making my point
At least he died doing what he loved - lying for Trump about how dangerous this pandemic is. His choice. A weird hill to die on but there you have it. He chose to attach to a malignant Trump and he died for it. That‚Äôs not mean , that‚Äôs true.
OK, now do Trump.
History will shame their names for as long as we have this republic. Synonymous with treason. Trump's campaign has floundered on his lies and non leadership during the pandemic.
Trump is trying to demonize USPS to cause people to lose faith in the electoral process during a pandemic so he has an excuse to to delegitimize the results. MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ENRAGED BY THIS
Neither of this great men were anything like Trump. They actually cared about America and the rule of law.
Senate Republicans dismiss Trump proposal to delay election
If Donald Trump has led, if he wore a mask and encoiraged us to all wear masks, Herman Caine would be alive today.
Donald Trump is a racist psychopath,who didn't and doesn't give a shit about his own family, why would anyone think he cares about america? Really?  Read Mary Trumps book to be enlightened
We could really get a hold on virus if President Trump declared martial law until vaccine is found.  Suspend all elections, taxes until  this is over he should remain President until such a cure is found
I like how quickly the Dems attack. All he did was suggest the idea, but to them Trump has already circumvented all protocols and as the ‚Äúdictator‚Äù (they claim he is) already made it law.
My understanding is that even if he cancels the election, he still will not be President come Jan. 21. There is some debate about who that falls to but it will not be Trump or Pence.
Or we can be like Heman Cain, and let Trump kill us.  Don't wear a mask, attend a Trump rally and die. Trump doesn't care so long as he can fluff his ego and sell a few hats and t-shirts. Blame the right for the extention of the Trump virus.
no, you really haven‚Äôt... you aren‚Äôt even smart enough to know they‚Äôre targeting those elected gop trump supporters... again, go suvk off bernie.  the adults are working here...
How's it feel to want Mr. tRump. Orange jumpsuit will go with your face and hair.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
TRUMP dosent have any friends he dosent have to pay in one way or another.
‚Äúwhat I‚Äôve seen firsthand is that the most violent behavior overwhelmingly comes from the federal agents, &amp; indeed the most serious injuries have been suffered by protesters. Your federal tax dollars paid to shoot a man in the face‚Äú - #Portland

I take pride in the fact that I can have experience in 1 area and still seek to be educated in another. That aside, the Trump administration is getting blatantly desperate to rile up what's left of their loud, racist base. You have to see it to believe it.

We love you President Trump!   Be part of the solution , not the problem.   Don‚Äôt let the enemy have ammunition to shout that you are stalling    Find solutions to the voting fraud and show America how you are going to fix this with your team!   You are perfect for this job!
My only question though is why would a man who lived through poverty and such difficulty yet still rose to be so successful and a thoughtful being would defend and support such an evil and cruel individual like Trump?
Personally I don't want anybody to die from the Virus.  But today tens of thousands are dying because of Trump.   Millions are infected because "its a hoax" followed by not wearing masks.     Mr. Cain is just one example ....   Trump won't shed a tear ... Dont / Wont care..
Wake up to Trump trying to postpone the election? I‚Äôm going back to sleep.
I am excited to share I will be announcing this afternoon whether Herman Cain dying of corona virus after going to a trump rally is funny or not. Please bear with me while I run the computers to do the algorithm.
Cain dies of Covid-19: did he catch it attending Trump‚Äòs Tulsa rally while not wearing a mask?
So now Trump is saying it is not safe to hold an election but demanding you send your children back me to school. Does everyone understand now that Trump does not give a flip about you or your children?
This is sad, 100% on Donald Trump for hosting that rally
Yes - too many drs support using it, too many Libs are willing to sacrifice lives if it means Trump loses re-election.
Would also put Trump in jail for the rest of his life.
It‚Äôs a ‚ÄòMind Fuck‚Äô for all of you, that have ‚ÄòTrump Derange Syndrome.‚Äô Try to stay grounded today, maybe a Chile Dog for lunch! Not this dog though.

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
FDA says it will not cut corners on a Virus Vaccine,  however the FDA reports to Trump and so far any department run by Trump lies, cheats, misrepresents facts, hides information.    I DON'T TRUST AND NETHER SHOULD YOU! They inject you with poison to help Trump.  Wait for Europe!
What Trump has done today, saying he should delay the election has spurred the Nation to rise up more than ever. Trump has admitted that he is Losing. Let‚Äôs Go America. Don‚Äôt be distracted. Don‚Äôt be afraid. VOTE November 3rd! #TogetherWeWin #TogetherWeRise #AmericaOrTrump
Did I say the Democrats are perfect? Nope. But they‚Äôre sure as shit better than the corrupt GOP Republicans and especially Trump. He‚Äôs selling us out to Russia right now. Stop your bootlicking and open your eyes.
Trump killed Herman Cain. Full stop.
Trump is desperately trying to not lose his crime protection and fears dealing with Putin after not delivering on his promises ! Trump the Traitor! Doesn‚Äôt want to face the courts! Trump the envolved in sex trafficking doesn‚Äôt want to be emplicated in his criminal activities!
Donald Trump murdered Herman Cain. And about 150,000 others. And you're an accessory.
Which part of this did Romney get wrong? Spooky how right he was
Herman Cain, a former GOP presidential candidate and Trump campaign surrogate, has died after being hospitalized with COVID-19.  via
Distraction;  "Trump's election delay threat is a purposefully-timed distraction to divert attention from the 32.9% reduction in Q2 GDP, the 1.43 million new unemployment claims and the 150,000 Americans who have died from coronavirus under his watch."
Do you honestly think anything Bolton could have said at the impeachment hearings would have flipped 18 Republican Senators to vote against Trump?  4 or 5 maybe but 18?
One less trump vote
Nope. And as  said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt delay an election you think you can win. Trump has just made an admission today.‚Äù #TrumpIsLosing  #TogetherWeWin
Ahhhhhh now I see why Trump is saying dumb shit. He doesn‚Äôt want to talk about our impending recession
No we accuse Trump we don‚Äôt care at all that you stand by this sex molester, bigot, American soldier bounty Traitor, Draft Dodger, snake oil bleach salesman, Tax cheat, American Pandemic Death Hoax orchestrator! No he has no chance but you stand by him! That‚Äôs your loss!
Please.... Trump has no self control or impulse control. He is willfully ignorant as to how our government works and he does not care. He doesn‚Äôt care about Covid or deaths caused by Covid. All he cares about is money and power. He does not deserve to be President. #voteblue
Resign, Donald J. Trump. Pass it on.
Exactly. Don‚Äôt let Trump distract or try instill fear by saying he wants to delay the election. #TrumpHasFailedAmerica 150,000 DEAD Americans from Covid-19 and over 4Million Sick with #TrumpVirus!

Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election

On March 3, 2020, after Xi Jinping was named President for life, Trump said "maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day."     On April 24, 2020, Biden said " ‚ÄúMark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow"  Today is someday.
The war of words will get going as we get closer to November 3rd   Good. Trump's alligator mouth is Biden's best supporter.

Biden doesn't even know what time it is. Dude has dementia and you're complaining about Trump? That's rich.
She could be from Pluto I want to see proof of her claim sorry you got butt hurt from his false claim! I‚Äôm so sorry of you being angry that Trump put her up to say the things she has! I‚Äôm not having sex with Demons or Aliens so I can care less! Is this enough info on the matter?
And dies this surprise anyone coming from a Trump loyalist? I remind everyone that McSally lost the election and the was appointed by the governor. She was never elected by the people. Vote for  He will serve the people and not Trump!
When you are demented enough to consider Trump‚Äôs opponent to be more dangerous than the present clown in office.
The same people that call Trump a fascist are the same ones that are okay with the government dictating what doctors can and cannot prescribe to their patients.
She was reported to be a Doctor from Nigeria Ask Trump why he put that information out are you American from Nigeria or Nigerian? You Chose? What has Nigeria done for America that makes me want to care where anyone is from? Do I speak Nigerian? No! Am I taught it no! Who‚Äôs Lying?
A clearance is only given to people on a need to know basis? Why does Brennan still have it? Tell me the Deep State doesn‚Äôt exist in Washington. They‚Äôve been trying to destroy Trump for nearly 4 years. No President in history has had so many factions attack him at one time, Why?
So focused on Trump can't even see her own backyard... This is beyond sad
IT WONT WORK! A Nation of angry Americans are going to throw Trump OUT come hell or high water. Keep the pressure on. Don‚Äôt let up for one second. We got this! We are in the battle for the soul of our Nation! #TogetherWeStand #TogetherWeRise  #TogetherWeWin

That portion of the wall was not part on Trump's construction. It was privately funded &amp; built where there were known construction problems. So, this is just more unwarranted criticism reflecting Trump hatred, not facts.

No Biden is NOT against fracking. Lies won‚Äôt work b/c 21,000 Trump lies are already system overload! This former Republican says NO MORE TRUMP! BIDEN ALL THE WAY!
Typical Trump Move all about me.   Really these 5 words:  Trump,Racist, Narcissistic,Idiot,Failure.  Your a genius
TRUMP REFUSES TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OF HIS OFFICE, OF WHICH HE IS UNFIT, HE REFUSES TO ACCEPT SCIENCE FACTS, THE BUCK STOPS WITH EVERYONE BUT HIM, IS, A MENDACITY FILLED, INEPT, INCOMPETENT, IGNORANT, COWARDLY, DELUSIONAL, DISTRUSTFUL, VINDICTIVE, XENOPHOBIC, VENGEFUL, BULLY,
"TRAITOR TRUMP!!!!!  I WILL KEEP SAYING THIS UNTIL THIS GENETIC SUBHUMAN BASTARD, SCUM IS OUT OF OFFICE!!!!!  EVERY DAY, I DESPISE AND DETEST TRUMP, MORE AND MORE!!!!!  YOU ARE A MALIGNANT METASTASIZED CANCER ON SOCIETY!!!!!
There will be no campaign.  COVID-19 will decide the next POTUS.  If this is a COVID tsunami or  set of COVID waves Trump loses.
They are literally killing people because crazy liberals hate Trump
Read this and it will show you how demented Trump and his supporters are.
What about the other 300 bills that Mitch sits on.  Trump Hack
Thank you for your courage in standing for truth and President Trump.  Stay strong and we'll ALL win.üëè
Little Napoleon must be exiled 2 Elba immediately; Hillary lover out to obstruct all Trump does. Obvious he's forsaken his ethics&amp;oath to do so. See his history w/HIV treatments-how he made himself rich off that illness. Doing it again by denying efficacy of hydroxychloroquine?

Your daddy dumped up trump.
You mean it didn't start with Trump?  The Monroe Doctrine gave us  banana republics.   Not enough.  Ok, let's get the Philippines.  Not enough.  Ok, let's get Nam.    Not enough, we want it all.
I am an old white haired white guy that is so tired of a bunch of old white haired white guys keeping the left down. Trump, Mitch, Biden, Bernie, Hillary, Pelosi, Schumer, Hoyer.....should all be living in the basement of their grandkids.
Same. All of the weirdness of our world thanks to the lack of leadership and downright lunacy of Trump hit me today. No one‚Äôs doing anything, waiting for us to vote him out, and I‚Äôm scared shitless he‚Äôs planning something horrible.
Dems asked him to be there to answer questions. They lied. They wanted a whipping boy because they‚Äôve been ineffectual against Trump. They never let him answer questions. Dems are rotten to the core.
Democrat Cuomo is the cause of most of the deaths. Trump saved lives when he shut down flights. You can‚Äôt seriously believe he‚Äôs to blame for all the deaths. That‚Äôs ignorance talking.
No Putin is just as dangerous as Trump is!!!!!
I am by no means a fan of Ivanka Trump, but why was this man not on SOMEONE‚ÄôS radar due to his clear obsession with her.  His tweets and posts are very scary to read.
Trump ‚Äúsort of‚Äù hopes the housing market will crash again &amp; and he‚Äôs doing everything he can to make sure it will happen!
In trump world... low income = criminals. I'm willing to bet that a good amount of his supporters are low income.
You really need to stop listening to Trump man! He‚Äôs leading you down a rabbit hole you‚Äôll never get out of and tens of thousands of deaths will be on your head. Trump‚Äôs going to prison anyway.
As well he should not. Lewis refused to attend his inauguration and worked maliciously against him although Trump outshines any modern president in his work to benefit Black ppl.     You, Ms. Powell, are a partisan bigot and light brain.
Thank God trump is a bad ambray
Trump has always been inept, self-absorbed and dishonest ‚Äî now he‚Äôs also an accessory to mass murder -  In other words Trump is saying "We're Getting Ready To Get Ready."  VOTE NOVEMBER 3!  I WANT TO SAY ON THAT DATE "TRUMP, YOU'RE FIRED!"
A GOP staffer just sent a damning note about a Republican lawmaker who just tested positive for coronavirus   Louie Gohmert, Jim Jordan, and Trump may very well be the stupidest people in office in history.
A GOP staffer just sent a damning note about a Republican lawmaker who just tested positive for coronavirus   Louie Gohmert is to Congress what Trump is to POTUS.  The Dimmest Bulbs Of All Time.  And Very Dangerous To The American People.
Brahm once again spreads fake news....he didn't try to "contact" Ivanka Trump  Here is the twitter message he sent
I really wish you had been elected in 2016. Stand strong and take Christian confrontations against injustice! Fascism is being used by Trump to try to control USA.

Ask Ducey what is in his medicine cabinet. He shadows Trump as much as inhumanly possible.
Say they risk everything, and GET Barr, but lose the WH. Was the gamble worth it? Is having Barr worth keeping Trump?
Nancy Pelosi takes care of the American people. Trump is the one who has repeatedly demonstrated his interests are with corporations and the wealthy.
Roleplaying as a 65 year old Trump loving boomer in a Facebook group chat is the highlight of my life right now. I need to stop being so single.
Maybe the 2nd to allow himself to dominate Trump in the news throughout the week. I think he already made his decisionüòå maybe just in the process of getting her Secret Service etc!
"TRAITOR TRUMP"!!!!!  YOU MENDACIOUS, SUBHUMAN SCUM!!!!!  YOU NACISSITIC JEALOUS LOWLIFE, JEALOUS OF DR. FAUCI'S DESERVED POPULARITY WAY ABOVE YOU DUE TO HIS UNTEGRITY, HONESTY, AND EMPATHY!!!!!  TRAITS YOU ASSURIDLY DO NOT POSSESS!!!!!

Amazing how fast Trump can run down the ramp when when his lies and misinformation catch up to him. This boy is sick, so I‚Äôm not sure what you call his supporters, other than cult members.
Infuriates me that you all consider AG Barr Trump's protector. How about Eric Holder who proudly boasted that he was Obama's "wing man?" Didn't hear a peep from you insane Dems then.

Trump is working hard to preserve our country and save it from ppl like you.
Damn dude...u sound like President Body Bags(Trump)...‚Äùbut, whaddabout this and whaddabout that?
No one likes me.  over 150,000 Americans and their families may agree.   Trump continues to spread misinformation
Like i have been saying   There will be no justice in America against those who tried a CoupDe'tat against our elected POTUS TRUMP.  They committed crimes against standing laws in our country YET #DONOTHINGDOJ  COVERS UP, DELAYS,&amp; DOES NOTHING.   American justice
I would vote to replace Sen Graham with a tuna fish can;  sorry the Tomato can is reserved for Trump!
Agree!  But his base just loves this because it is disrespectful to a Black man who is a thousand times the American that Trump is or ever will be!
#TrumpKillsTexas.  Remember the mass shooting in El Paso? Now COVID19 deaths? Trump kills Texans!
Trump is involved so he's probably making money off of this and it is going to be a catastrophic failure.
Did you see Trump‚Äôs news conference today? You need to do something. We‚Äôre in the middle of a crisis and the POTUS is losing it! #25thAmendmentNow
You have come up with too little too late.  You have failed and now you are trying to redeem yourself. Your obedience to Trump has cost our state dearly. You need to repent and resign, the people know you as the no-mask-mandate cowardly Governor.
LMAO #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpleThinSkin #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsALoser #TrumpResignNow #Trump Is #MoronInChief  may be if you stop taking the concoction of pills you touted at your 5pm roasting u may remember if anyone wants u throwing a pitch!
Trump's never been good at anything. I expect that this will fully blow up in his face.
Trump is not a doctor.   Also, neither is Ducey
Please do not listen to Trump on covid19 misinformation.  It is your life protect it
You need to wash your face Debbie Do nothing Lesko!! You have some of Donald Trump‚Äôs face cream on your mustache
Trump blaming others for his behavior and actions!!!
I like to see Tom cotton tarred and feathered for his comments and his gaslighting and his behavior in letting Trump get away with what he‚Äôs doing
99%  Of Republicans are doing just this sticking their heads in the Ground!!!!! Wishing everyone doesn‚Äôt see their complicity into Trump‚Äôs Behavior and Actions!!!
It was cool for Joe Biden to "blackmail" the President of Ukraine, but it‚Äôs an impeachable offense if Donald Trump inquiries about it.  Biden has lying down to a science - thing is he's stupid so the lies are easy to catch.
is finally getting down to business  Why is Barr not investigating  for commuting Roger Stone's sentence in exchange for Roger Stone's silence?  Stone can incriminate Trump for lying under oath to the Mueller investigation
His children have jobs in trump‚Äôs Administration
Everything she claims is false  Just a Trump Hack.
Ps I don‚Äôt support trump.
An unemployed bitch might be pressed but if it wasn‚Äôt for daddy trump you wouldn‚Äôt even be dressed.
EVERYONE U support is despicable, immoral, corrupt reprehensible, those  who have no right to be leader of any kind. Trump=a patriot who will stand for our Constitution and the good of ALL Americans. He doesn't pander to identity groups divided by Obama &amp; his disgusting lackeys.
He is literally failing the state of Florida. FL is now the epicenter of a global pandemic.   Closed late and open early follow no guidelines.    Trump Hack   SWAT

I missed my nephew‚Äôs and my Godson‚Äôs HS graduation in Las Vegas; I missed my family reunion in Chicago; I miss my sister in Michigan and was unable to help nurse her through her bout with COVID. She survived thank God and no thanks to Trump. I miss my life.
The Fauci on naughty boy list, I‚Äôd be packing my office if I was him, Trump will make it his priority to fire him before November...Night if Halloween is my bet..
Is your career really worth whatever has you chained to Trump? Is your soul worth it? The people who voted for you trusted you and you‚Äôre killing them. You‚Äôre failing the character test.
Yes, trump‚Äôs that evil !!!!!
I am a supporter of my POTUS TRUMP.  But  IF THE DOJ WOULD START TO PROSICUTE THE DEEP STATE COUPDE'TAT INDIVIDUALS THEN YOU WOULD SEE THE SUPPORTERS OF ALL THIS VIOLENCE START TO LEAVE OUR COUNTRY OUT of fear that they will be the next FEDERAL PRISONER

So what was trump talking about when he said inject disinfectant?? Nothing is a coincidence
President Trump suggested that Twitter's trending topics are 'illegal' because they make him look bad, and he is a shit human being.
I left shortly after Trump was elected.  It was a $hit$how back then.  What is going on is nothing new...folks act like this just started.  I remember watching them lite a car in fire because they had a Trump bumper sticker sticker.  It was a war zone back then.
Trump's not quite the racist that you are and always have been, Joe w/ very long history of racism. As typical Democrat, U project ur sins on others:opposed school bussing, integration of schools, befriended KKKByrd,wrote 1994 Criminal Act that was hardest on Black people. cont'd
I read the book. It is well dicumented, and favorite book sof 10 I‚Äôve read on Trump. Everyone should read Unger‚Äôs book!
I‚Äôm in Arizona and am experiencing the same. Not one person that I know who voted for Trump in 2016 says they‚Äôre voting for him again. Not One. In a historically red state - Not One.
.....Donald Trump represents the absolute worst in our country.  He is morally bankrupt and a lying socialpath.  I call on all Americans, regardless of party, to standup for common decency and our Country and denonce this man!
Trump's gonna ask to speak to the manager of Twitter
Trump will never criticize Russia.  Someday we will find out why. Porn video? #TrumpleThinSkin

Also, Biden has the eyes of a dragon. He‚Äôs not scared to make the stand he needs to make. Trump will become the outsider who, hopefully will move to ‚ÄòSalem‚Äôs Lot  and work the night shift at the institute since he‚Äôll probably have insomnia üëçüèΩ

Let's see you at age 70!  Fauci is obviously not an athlete and never was.  Trump is active and athletic.

Pence earned his spot on ticket when he ‚Äòendorsed‚Äô Ted Cruz in Indy primary and then spent the next 15 minutes praising trump   Trump romped  and the rest of the primaries sealed it   Rewatch pence endorsement   Amazing
The only terrifying part is that people think this all started with trump... started a looooong time ago folks
I tried to find a video of POTUS TRUMP getting home from Tulsa OK.  Rally to post and show A PRESIDENT THAT IS TIRED BUT STILL FIGHTS FOR THE AMERICAN CITIZENS.  ALL the videos I found had NEGATIVE tag lines. So not posting that crap.   POTUS stay strong IGY6.
Someone will lose their temper while carrying a AK47, start firing killing many law enforcement officers, then all hell will breakout. Then Democrats leaders will try a blame President Trump, knowing full well they could‚Äôve stopped all rioting at its beginning.
No I honestly can say there are some I would not play with but Trump is one I would in a heartbeat
As you start getting election mailers in for senators, note which ‚Å¶ ones are missing any mention of ‚Å¶ Don‚Äôt worry, I have a reference for how Senators voted! #AmericaOrTrump

Trump is calling protesters who disagree with him terrorists. That puts him in the company of the world's autocrats.   #TrumpThreatensAmerica
If Biden can't do an interview with other than the bought and paid for Liberal media, will he be able to debate Donald Trump or use the virus as his excuse?  Will voters care?
The system worked, ballots in question were see aside and not counted.
Really dude? It‚Äôs a haboob that knocked down a couple panels of unfinished wall. I‚Äôm not a Trump supporter but this isn‚Äôt some big story or shot at Trump. Everything is so divisive in this country and you aren‚Äôt helping anything. Go back to posting hilarious videos please.
What a joke! Your only ‚ÄòStrong  Focus‚Äô is on how to stay out of prison and how many more rounds of golf you can play before you go to prison. You‚Äôre done Trump! Oh, and it‚Äôs the The Trump Virus üòâ
Trump's problem is no state stands for grifters racketeering in the
no crowd could boo Trump out of the stadium for a botched pandemic response like a Yankee crowd
Trump knows he would get booed out of Yankee Stadium
Trump knows he can not win a war with China be it hot or financial. It would send the world into a depression and Trump would be blamed. A proxy war (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Kashmir.....) yes very likely.
Pelosi dubs Trump 'Mr. Make Matters Worse' over his handling of coronavirus pandemic   Pelo si and the rest of the dems in government need to be taken out and shot!!!
I've never trusted u-sabotaging Republicans, the STRONG conservatives who've Trump's back &amp;should NOT separate themselves from him. If they do, they're sure to lose the Senate-Pres Trump will have to deal with a Democrat Senate working against him as House now does.

Please support  as he tries to unseat Trump mouthpiece
What was Trump doing calling it a hoax?  Refresh your memory.  But that is not the point, what has he done was here.  failure
COVID-19 will decide.  Biden is not beating Trump, COVID-19 is beating Trump.
Trump and our Governor Ducey are still hoping it will just magically go away.  Internal FEMA memo reveals Arizona coronavirus patients taken to New Mexico over staffing shortages: report
I have been saying that Trump sending his goons to cities is a dry run for D.C. in case he loses. If that happens the military will frog march him out of the White House wearing a straight jacket.
I get angrier and sadder by the minute.  There are SO MANY distractions happening all at once and so much death.  What is going on behind the scenes with trump that we are not even hearing about because of all of the chaos he has caused?
I am not a genius like Trump but here is my test.    Trump, Racist, Narcissist, Idiot, Failure.   I am sur to remember this until 3 Nov 20 #EveryonesLaughingAtYouDonald
That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre voting for Biden Trump has torn America apart
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Does anyone know how I can donate directly to Trump campaign?  No RNC, WINRED or any other organization just to POTUS
So you're doing this to help trump again?
Where is all the media coverage for the black man gunned down Thursday Oh I know he was a Trump supporter so he doesn‚Äôt get coverage.  No bias here
Trump‚Äôs going to screw up FEMA response to the hurricane‚Äôs
So what about DeSantis, Ducey, Abbott, all the other Trump ass kissin governors that r literally killing people by not doing their jobs?  I can tell u where they need to go!!!
It doesn't matter that the law wants local/state goats. to invite the Fed govt. in.  Ppl see this as Trump not doing anything to stop the anarchy as much as Biden won't/can't. Trump MUST take decisive steps now to put these anarchists down &amp; away if he wants votes, not chaos.
My fear, BIG one, is that ppl blame Trump for not acting, not stopping the violence. We look &amp; ask "Why isn't our govt. stopping this?" Voters will see Trump as not doing anything (just as Biden won't, can't, refuses) AND IT WILL COST PRES.TRUMP A LOT OF VOTES UNLESS HE ACTS NOW!
The Trump goon deployments are dry runs for D.C. in case he loses.
Ducey and his lap dog Dr. Christ are blatant liars.  He is totally inept as he kneels to Trump and spews his Tea Party diarrhea. Flattening at 3k cases is insane. He shut it down at 1k cases per week why not at 20k cases per week? He is a coward.
I agree with you, Trump‚Äôs taking a risky chance with people‚Äôs lives and a rush to find a cure jeopardize lives
Remember the FBI at this time did a bogus investigation on Trump. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more than what the FBI released.
I vote President Trump too. Remember MSM, cesspool Hollywood elites and democrats will try anything say anything to turn us against Trump.
I do not only blame Trump but also our cowardly Governor who kneels to Trump as he spews his Tea Party diarrhea and will not take responsibility for his failures. Koch bought him long ago.
Trump is a failure. Probably out playing golf could care less about Americans suffering
This is it folks. The boy has no money and is owned by others. Trump supporters were unable to connect the dots when he fought so hard to keep his taxes from the American public.
Trump: I am going to Build a Wall.... Every NonRacist: We got your Walls Right hereFearing Trump interference, FBI agents hid copies of Russia investigation docs By Jeffrey Toobin, CNN Chief Legal Analyst///And away we go
Was that dump truck or dump Trump?
I feel that definitely needs to be done. Is Trump attempting a coup, postpone the election.
We're going to have to work real hard to get America back together.  Trump is shredding it apart
Trump is a wanna be
Trump is attempting what Putin did in Russia. To be in office and control.  The founders were very particular in what they placed in the Constitution.
I say vote Trump off the island and deport him come November.
Get it together!  You are not doing your jobs. Focus in the nation and the people, uphold your oaths.  You're being to sound like Trump.
Let them get sick, their choice. It will be a mistake, like supporting Trump
Because people would rather believe lies than see reality. It's ingrained since childhood. They don't use common sense or reasoning. They, like Trump, blame others for their troubles
I see following Trump to the end. Trump said he took it, but that's not proven. We will see what happens.
Just waiting for the next Trump tactic.
GOP = dumber then a rock Pence = crazier then a look Trump = crazy like a Fox because he got all the GOP to follow his lead!
The buck stops here. - H. Truman  It never reached my desk. - D. Trump
I won't ever be a Trump supporter at all. I just want to vote for Biden and get it over with.
They are also interfering with the election by not giving Trump equal time. I see Biden ads all day long on Hulu, Netflix, even Fox. But Trump's ads are no where to be found.
We are losing our allies because of Trump. He has buddie up with the dictators
I think You meet win the week, but it's only Tuesday! But trump &amp; his advisor the Dr. That believes in Alien üëΩDemon Sperm is still hard to beat! Hope that this brings out more #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica &amp; üîΩüîΩüîΩ
Don't ignore the fact that the "poor little No body likes me" Prez has promoted &amp; taken the advise from a Dr. who believes in "demon sperm &amp; aliens" üëΩüë∫üëΩ This goes down as a "trump" "GOP" crazy week &amp; it's only Tuesday!üò¢  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
The family also serves with their members in the military! I so agree with you, trump has by his ignorance of gullibility, put our sons, daughters, nieces, nephews, moms &amp; dad's in harm's way! His actions show us how much he hates our warriors, their families &amp; the Veterans!
Barr lied, Barr Lies, Barr will continue to lie! Barr lied, Barr lies, Barr will always lie to enable the trump to gaslight American Citizens &amp; endanger more Americans with his grifts &amp; snake oil Barr Failed Americans &amp; is continuing destroy justice! That's why #NobodyLikesTrump

Trump is only the president to  1. People who voted for him, worship him, or Watch Fox News 2. The People that he wants something from or is willing to Quid Pro Quo for him  I want a President who actually is the American President for all of their citizens! #WhyIDontLikeTrump
I was actually depressed afterwards thinking that the buffoon was in charge of We the People justice department. He seemed more like he was the chubby Stone right from the 1st trump campaignüòï
Because Trump think he has the answer for everything.
That money is to protect the miserible  unthankful people who hate Trump and want to destroy the US They call them liberal Marxist Communists morons.
Nope! I get my Flu shots, My shingles vaccine, but I would not trust any vaccine that the trump or his unqualified Administration recommends. The #GrifterInChief has put his tweets &amp; his Quid Pro quo on the most insane conspiracy theories &amp; snake oil cures to make a buck!
That's a bit crazy. But maybe it explains Trump
Beating Trump in the election will get rid of Barr.
Trying to create havoc. Trump enabler
She would be a great choice ! Joe Biden would be a good president ; with whatever VP he chooses ! But you've got to admit , it's not like we could make a mistake choosing anything other than tRump !?
I want an inquiry into who suggested that tRump should take a test to prove that he does not have dementia ? I've never been asked to take one and neither has Joe Biden ! Just saying ! üò∑
Somebody told me ; well at least I've heard ; well many people actually have said ;  that tRump only listens to the voices in his head....
Yes there is.  Rule of law for everyone, but them and Trump
#BlackLivesMatter the hate for Trump has blinded the Cure for Covid19!
His job is to work with the President and serve the people .  Not to block if Trump is not re-elected.
Trump University PhD worthless

Another failed attempt by trump in China! All this failing should be enough to persuade voters #TrumpFailsAmerica &amp; #UnfitToBePresident  Forget his Twitter screw ups, or his lying, or his golfing! #ETTD including Diplomacy! Trump drops the ball every time he acts presidential!
Trump used NDAs as a weapon. Companies use it to avoid EEOC lawsuits &amp; to discriminate against their workers. Fox used it to cover up sexual harassment &amp; more!      it's time to end the use of NDAs in Corporations!
It's not pointed at her but in another direction, line of sight. But if these actions continue, it will get alot worse, especially if it's other cities. Trump wants to start trouble
You mean that thing that doesn't exist

Don't watch the news much. When did Trump wear a mask? He downplayed from the beginning. If there was a strategy, the virus wouldn't be out of control
We all want the same, just different views of how to maintain it. The threat is not each other, but a Trump group trying to control.
Trump is attempting to create a Civil War . We're already divided more than before. If there is an armed conflict, he'll use the military.
Trump is trying to send a message. "I'm in control, I can do whatever I want".
your argument is so flawed considering this is happening now in trump‚Äôs america. stick that in your juice box and suck it.
I'm finding it very hard to feel any kind of empathy toward #GOP leaders that Aren't brave enough to stand up to trump Administration! If they are so afraid, then how are we ever suppose to trust them to Do the Right thing? #TrumpFailsAmerica #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

Biden isn't President.  This is Trump's America
I don't think "truth" means what you think it means. It means "factual". You can't just make up your own reality and your own "facts". You're on the wrong side of history, and if you're truly a truth seeker, then you need to recalibrate your system.   Truth and Trump = opposites

Trump created this environment.  Pandemic, unemployment, racial tensions. People are at their limit. AND now Trump is sending DHS agents to cities to control protesters?  People are scared and frustrated, with DHS thrown in the mix, it's going to be a war. Gee THANKS
What Trump is telling the public is not the orders given to the agency?
LMFAO. More like, his corruption is making even the most hardcore conservatives scatter like rats. His days are numbered.   I'm so glad you're okay with the most corrupt, intellectually stunted public official of all time. Trump is morally bankrupt, just like those he conned.
Please get  on your show to review his book, #TheMakingOfDonaldTrump and what he thinks of Mary Trump‚Äôs book. Thank you, a  viewer!
Umm, Trump is the most intellectually stunted public official of all time. He has destroyed this country. He doesn't deserve to be called "president". He is mentally damaged to such a degree that every day he's in office, he's degrading this country. We may not recover.
They all have played a role in the massive spike in cases. For every instance I mentioned, people should have been wearing masks and physically distancing.   The rallies were full of blatant disregard for their fellow peers, and they never should have taken place. Trump's a moron
Well it helps trump, &amp; his buds, so that's all that matters! Nothing to see here! No Oversight needed Mitch! By the way, did you see where trump tried to get the British Open Golf tournament at his own course using our U.S. Ambassador as the quid Pro Quoer?!
Didn't expect that? That's trumpism at is best When others run away from "stranger danger" trump hears straight for itüòÅüò¢üòÅ Self Sabotage of Quid Pro Quo? You decideüò†

I think it would be helpful if mary trump did all the shows on a constant basis pounding into the heads of voters how much we must vote him out.
He would do anything to further his own personal power reputation support and what he sees as approval.  refer to mary trump's book.
Mmmmmmm.  Ask fox news
You sound more like David Lies
Better yet, why don't we give the American people every dollar that we fraudulently give to trump &amp; his family.
Of course they are, this is to fucking obvious.I literally hate Trump and his administration
Every day this goes on trump sinks in the polls.    Keep up the good work
Wonder who helped Trump spell "Anarchist"? Cause obviously he doesn't know what it means.

Mr. Cruz you are showing your intermittent lack of intelligence. That would not be a Joe Biden behavior and you know it. He doesn't have it in him. Unlike Mr. Trump does it have a decent bone in his body and any decent behavior would be a lapse on his part.
He didn't build shit. Obama built the strong economy out of the mess he inherited from the GOP. Up until recently, trump called the pandemic a hoax, and still hasn't done anything about it. As usual, all you do is lie to the American people.
Wow this doesn't seem true. Duhh.  America's life depends on getting rid of trump so how much more enthusiasm could Biden have. This tweet doesn't seem like a change for trump.  Divisive and untrue.

I don't agree with Trump on cutting Amtrak services or funding either, but I do agree with him on privatization of Amtrak.  It could be done in gradual steps but before that there needs to be some serious growth. And not through High-Speed Rail.
My biggest disagreement with Trump is on trucking. I think we have went in the wrong direction with the trucking industry. We actually need to be reversing and placing more weight restrictions on the trucking industry.

Donald Trump said that he would hire good people.  He hired some of the worst people and even that that if they weren't kissing his ring every minute he fired them. Biden will not do that.

At Lewis Funeral, Obama Lashes Trump and Calls Filibuster a ‚ÄòJim Crow Relic‚Äô   obama continues his low level political bashing at a American political legends funeral.  obama shows his true hatred instead of honoring a legend.  disgusting stunt.
I know it is hard but the two issues are mutal exclusive and aren't tied together.  Germany has not been paying their fair share into NATO, Trump is the only President that has tried to hold them accountable.  Look I could bring up all kind of Obama items like these but why?
Yes. Untrue. Hard to believe but I can have a open dialog without attacking you.  Do I think Trump does everything right, HELL NO!  Trump does stupid shit for sure.  I am appalled that Republicans have abandoned any sense of fiscal responsibility, they are acting like Democrats.

Actually there is a real difference. The guy behind him walks with his toes pointed outward. Trump throws his entire leg out to the side in order to propel it forward.

Wow, talk about a Trump level of stupid. IF HE CAUGHT IT AT THE RALLY HE WOULD HAVE TESTED NEGATIVE BEFORE THE RALLY. Also, I thought HCQ worked?
im sorry but trump wants to delay the election, ‚Äúto keep people safe‚Äù, but then also says he will start defunding schools if they don‚Äôt reopen. which puts millions of kids/teachers in unsafe circumstances. nah bunker boy.... you just know you‚Äôre losing the election
Jesus Christ this bitch is actually insane, I would make a funny ‚Äútrump derangement‚Äù joke but I feel she might actually need help holy fuck.
Basically, Hermann Caine  is responsible for his own death . But hey, we can't turn back time, if we could trump would still be a loser, scamming and jamming  in NY.  And we would not be looking at over 4 million cases of Covid.
Yeah he died today he got sick on the second he was at the Trump rally in Louisiana 12 days before those are the timeline facts everything else at this point is The Emperor's New Clothes followers insisting that he's dressed nice
Trump will go golfing, say he's busy and send Kayleigh, "he never met him but he thinks Herman was one of the good ones." #thoughtsandprayers #FuckingHoax
Anyone left supporting Trump after today is my sworn enemy.

I understand and respect that. I wish I could be the same.  Herman Cain was no Donald Trump. He did have major faults, and one of those was his enabling of that nightmare.  And now the world has one less advocate of evil with whom to deal.  To his family, my condolences.
Really Bill. President Trump knew exactly what all of the fools would say as soon as he hit the Tweet button. I'm shocked that you are one of those fools. You get the daily "Dumbest Smart Guy Award"
See that's where you're wrong  Up is up  Gop are science deniers  Herman died of being a cuck to Trump  SAD
He died of covid-19 he tested positive on July 2nd he was at the Trump rally 12 days before without a mask on the very last video of him alive is him dancing at the Trump rally in Louisiana with a mask on where the doctors believe he caught it
Suicidal Trump supporters. #NoSympathyForGOP
It's been obvious for months that masks are effective but the Governors of many states haven't been on board with or haven't mandated mask wearing. Same with Trump. His constant mixed messages and his eagerness to open up states while cases were rising really caused problems IMO.

Trump violates the law every day in a million ways. No one and nothing has stopped him. So why would he think there is any line he can't cross. He will at least try.

When Trump loses in November. America gets to evict Trump out of the White House. Think of the irony of that. Thousands of people have been evicted from Trump's Apartments, now America gets to evict him.

That is unamerican to build a freaking wall around our White House. It needs to come down. If trump is so scared he needs to resign and run away and hide. I really hate him and his lap dog Barr. Disgusting.

Uh no 2016 didn't prove polling is garbage, the reason polls were deemed inaccurate was bc a large number of disenfranchised voters voted for Trump, and obviously those people who never vote weren't polled. A similar thing happened in 2008.

This is what people like you will never get. The country and the government are 2 separate things. I LOVE my COUNTRY but am not a fan of our GOVERNMENT. Case in point I didnt burn the flag when Obama did nothing for 8 years. I didnt frame it when Trump drains the swamp. #LoveUSA
President Obama has been out of office for 3+ years. Focus on the present and future, not the past. So, instead of beefing about a President who is not relevant breaking the law focus on your own party. There are plenty there to choose from especially tRump and his lapdog Barr.
100 reported deaths does not mean that 100 people died in one day. You probably blame Trump too.  #GTFO

If you constantly feel the need to devils advocate on a post about something horrific Trump is doing by responding with ‚ÄúBUT OBAMA started it and was way worse than you think...‚Äù, you‚Äôre the problem. Why not focus on something happening now by the current corrupt president?

I‚Äôm actually kind of embarrassed for him.
JE hit on an underage girl  maralago &amp; Trump banned him for it. JE told Trump how much he was bidding on a certain properly and trump underbid him &amp; bought it. JE was pretty pissed off. Trump was invited to dinner at JEs in NY &amp; spent the whole time n the kitchen w the chef.
Been watching Trump campaign commercials? Has he got your fear and hate levels high enough to vote for him yet?
If there's proof he's a pedo, he goes down. Any and all of them. But with the exception of a few photos with Epstein and Maxwell, the evidence supports the fact that Trump's not involved in their ugly shit. His sole cooperation in JEs investigation and banning him are solid.
tRump called the Coronavirus a hoax. Racist says what?
Another thing to do when Trump is gone is pull Fox‚Äôs license.
It‚Äôs up to Swalwell and his colleagues in the Senate and in Congress to impeach the man.  Don‚Äôt see much action, mesnwhile Trump‚Äôs mercenaries are running amok in ther home states.  There are times I think we need to be rid of the whole lot.
So if I understand correctly the media narrative is the protests are indeed not peaceful but they are violent because 2 months into the violence riots trump sent in feds to protect federal property and thus the riots are trump‚Äôs fault? Did I get that right?
Dr Zelenko has been treating patients in NYC with hydroxy trio since March with like 98% success when used in First five days.  Not new discovery- just pooh poohed bc Trump  suggested it.  It‚Äôs CHEAP too - like $20!

Breaking rock on a chain gang. Trump will be the one holding the spike while someone else with a sledgehammer will be driving the stake into the rock. Karma is his name and being blind is his game.
Why would you possibly think they actually cared? Trump won't even say a word for our military being targeted by his mentor Putin.
I stand with Portland too. This Gestapo action is unamerican. This is trump at his worst. I expect to see the trump gestapo at voting places in November. Theses cities are test runs for November.
It's just a shit show, he'll take it off like Trump as soon as the camera is off him.
Right, don't give them a reason to do anything. Then they are the bad guys and trump is responsible.

Hey David, remember in 2016 they were accusing Donald Trump of this then. Who is it that could not accept the vote again? Any bets unless Biden is crushed the Democrats will do it again?

No, no, no. Anyone who really thinks that will happen is delusional. Dropping out would require self-awareness, and the slightest grip on reality. Not to mention understanding of, and reverence for the Constitution. Trump has none of these.
ANY REPUBLICAN THAT SUPPORTS THE DEMOCRATS MAIL IN BALLADS FOR THE 2020 ELECTION, IS PART OF THE SWAMP....   THE GLOBALIST COMMUNIST INFESTATION IN AMERICA, IS THE SWAMP, AND MUST BE REMOVED BY THE MILITARY FOR TREASON....   TRUMP, MUST REMAIN PRESIDENT FOR AMERICA'S SURVIVAL....

Our message to Donald J Trump:  This is OUR Constitution not yours.  You've had your time the votes will be cast. American's elect all our politicians... and you had know idea what we needed.  Putin is NOT our President.
Trump says to delay election because of mail-in fraud. Election occurs 11/3 anyhow. Trump loses and blames fraud, refuses to step down while ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù. Widespread protests erupt. Trump stamps down. Shots fired. Shit hits the fan by Christmas 2020.
Plus, the underlying cause in everything trump does, he makes money off it.
Ok hear me out.  If there's no election, Trump's term expires in January and line of succession means the Speaker of the House becomes President. Right now, that's Nancy Pelosi.  But there's no rule the Speaker has to be a member of the House.  This is how Bernie can still win.
Someone should tell Trump that Obama didn't delay elections over H1N1 just to get him to admit Covid is worse than Swine flu
Translation: he's losing big time
No sane person does. And Trump knows this, which is why he's trying to exclude people from voting.
Sounds like he was given his talking points.  We certainly can imagine the content of all those phone calls with Putin where Trump wasn‚Äôt demanding answers about bounties on our troops.
I know        will be interesting-    Trump loves to mop the floor with Lib Head Reporters-he always does.

How would Donald Trump answer this questions?  Who should the families who lost a son due to Putin's bounty? DJT's Reply, "God ordained me to leadership, a big job."   You know the wall  is very tall and deep?"  "Wearing a mask is very important, did you know that?"
We now know Trump does not apologize, and why after reading his nieces book. Fear of Donald is explained for future reporters questions.  Example: 'Donald, can you explain to soldiers families killed for Putin's bounty who they should sue?'
This should not be happening anywhere. This is Trump's America, not ours.
Obama bragged about more people being on food stamps than ever before. Why? Because people gave up because there were no jobs! He said Trump would have to have a magic wand to get jobs back in our Country. Then, when Trump proves him wrong he takes credit for what Trump has done.

Trump Breaks Lefties By Suggesting Election Delay Until WuFlu Cured!  via
Mueller's statement that Trump was not exonerated by this report was unethical, unprofessional, and a violation of DOJ policy; this was pure politics. Remember, if they can do it to him they can do it to you.
He said to Barr and Rosenstein (in front of other witnesses) the DOJ policy was not the reason he did not charge or consider charging Trump. He does not have the power to exonerate, he has the power to find violations of law and prosecute them.
To Trump, not finding a violation of the law, is exoneration. Mueller's statement on exoneration is unprofessional and highlights the corruption attached to the entire probe.
Here's one.
His office withdrew such statements later, as he had already told Barr and Rosenstein that he did not consider DOJ policy when determining to charge. Saying Trump was not exonerated violated basic DOJ principals as it's not his job to exonerate, only find violations; corrupt.
The Adults are under arrest, crossing the border at other than a port of entry is a felony. The minors have been separated since the 90s, Trump is simply the only one who got the blame and finally found a way around the mandated procedure.

Yes. The unemployment rate was the lowest in history until the virus hit which is not Trumps fault, the businesses that moved to China are coming back, the trade deals are more fair for Americans, and Trump just signed a deal that will lower pres drugs 50%

Trump is unwell? Have you noticed how they don‚Äôt let Biden talk to anyone freely anymore? Want to know why? Cause when he is left alone the crazy old man slips out and he rambles about nonsense until he forgets what he was talking about. Literally grandpa from the Simpsons
Hopefully investigations begin after the election.  Is there any hope these 4 years will have consequences on the Trump brands?
What was the initial question to Trump on Stormy Daniels, and what was his response?. The bounties issue was withheld initially from his briefing because it was not confirmed or actionable yet. It's important to distinguish between a lie and not having an intent to deceive.

Proven not to be true. Republicans know the make-up of the US is changing and without stacking the deck, Repub‚Äôs just can‚Äôt win. Even tRump acknowledges this fact.   Studies show a .00005% issue in voting all together including mail in. Statistically insignificant.
Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election
I don‚Äôt think it is a matter of you like him or not. The real question should be. Is Trump best man for the job? And right now I believe he best option we have at this moment and time. At the end of the day, the problem isn‚Äôt Trump. The real problem is the whole government.
Apparently, that's one version of what's going on. It's still just an accusation. If the Left had been more judicious over the last 4-years in their accusations, like not make-up some daily crisis about Trump, I might be concerned. As it is, it's just more noise.
This is huge in the face of Trump's Law and Order campaign.
Fuck Donald Trump:) and fuck you if you like him
Biden is not the President! This is Trump‚Äôs legacy!
Should've happen in 1991 but this is good too. Whether or not you like Trump this is a big win for the US.
People like Trump because of their #DaddyIssues, or because they had a coach, a teacher, a youth leader, a scout master, someone just like Trump that they saw as an authority figure as a kid, and they still see him as one now.

I googled some of her sermons.  Interesting stuff.  I'm not racist, Trump is.  So, besides pushing the drug is this support of her a tongue in cheek effort to reach into black culture?  I hope it's not an offensive question
Trump is off base calling Democratic cities mismanaged.  In Wisconsin where 95% of the black population lives in Milwaukee.  Where a higher majority of the population is low income.  Milwaukee is dealing with years of systematic racial divide. It's the lack of opportunity
A vote for West, is a vote for Trump.
My favorite thing on Twitter is watching the Communist &amp; Pedo trolls pretend like they can't see and don't care what's said, right after being concerned enough to insert themselves in a "Trump cult" tweet. But [codename Dorothy] wouldn't know about that, because they can't see.
Given where we are with 90 days to go, is there any one singular event that would swing you back to Trump?
You are a Communist &amp; pedophile supporter, and a very obedient Chinese/Communist asset. "but, but, but...I'm a capitalist.. I only incessantly tweet about Trump while mostly ignoring Leftist coups, agitprop &amp; violence, because those people on the Right are ruining this country."
The big difference here is that it was YOU who responded to an Ann "Definitely Not in a Trump Cult" Coulter tweet, talking about Trump Cults. So if you had any common sense and reading comprehension, you would have stopped yourself before you sunk lower in a pit of irony.
And you're such a servile stooge Communists that you can't even conceive of how someone could be against obvious Leftist, political propaganda and media censorship without being in a Trump Cult. That's how badly you've been indoctrinated.
Will you be discussing safeguards on relief funds through an Independent Watchdog review?  Arizona has reported fraud in unemployment benefits and SBA loans.  And Trump has weakened oversight reviews.
Must be true if you keep saying Trump Cult. Leftist Rule of 5, right? What Jacob(Communist codename Dorothy) can't wrap his head around is how someone likes tweets of Coulter more than Trump, when Ann is more likely to berate Trump than praise him, but still be in a Trump Cult.

Aren't they all conspiracies until someone investigates and proves it? Isn't that the basis behind your FAKE dossier used to spy on Trump?
Call me unsurprised. Some have suggested that trump has put these officers in an uncomfortable position. TBH, I think they totally enjoy the terror they are handing down. It's obvious that most have a chip on their shoulder and need to prove what tough guys they are. .

That the left considers violence an appropriate reaction to political disagreement represents a great threat to democracy than anything Trump could ever do.
So let me get this straight. You people actually believe the world is run by satan worshipful pedophiles who are also cannibals and that tRump has the goods to bring them down?  This is some real delusional BS.
TrumpsUrbanViolence  On top of the inherent racial tensions there is the lack of opportunity for low income families in Milwaukee.  So they get the rap of Welfare and general assistance recipients. There is a definite racial divide in Wisconsin.  And Trump is playing to it.

2.  My thoughts turned to tweets, and Wilileaks, and 600 lost emails.  Remember how big a deal that was? So I'm gonna go all Bourne...lol.  Let's assume Trump tweets 20 times a day for 5 years.  I'm including the pre-election year.  20x365 is roughly 7000 a year, times 5, 35,000

What is the purpose of the ranting? What actual steps do you want people to take?  People like you will share some of the blame if Trump loses.  You have a huge platform and use ridiculous arguments to make Joe Biden and Donald Trump seem like the same man.
I think I just got blocked! LMAO!! ‚ÄúAS WELL‚Äù! Admitting Trump is deplorable!
Steny.  You trying to follow what President Trump already did with success before the CV 19 from China came to US.   Another type of plagiarism Mr Hoyer.  President did in 3 yrs what Democrats haven‚Äôt done in past 50 yrs. you are now a Copycat of Pres Trump but with no experience

Trump will keep his forces in Democratic cities through the election at which point he will post them outside polling stations claiming he's protecting the election.  In reality he wants to limit your right to vote.  Wait and see.
When i was 18 my parents said the democrats are for the working man. Well, its not unheard of to see things change and change they did indeed. Not that the republicans are what I want but its all we have right now. I do believe Trump wants to what‚Äôs best but so did Kennedy
If Trump is so bad then how fucking bad was the Democrat candidate who ran against him? Trump was the lesser of two evils.
Like the bully he is Trump has drawn a line in the sand and is daring us to cross it for political gain.
So Buck, not sure if you are aware,  the  riots are so bad !!! Right.  When federal agents arrived, in  Portland the got to have a  little 3 day vacation,  why you ask because the had to wait for a camera crew and production company ,to arrive so Trump can make political theater.

If I recall there were a lot of protests before the 2016 election with pockets of violence.   Trump claimed they were paid protests to disrupt.  Who's paying to disrupt protests this time?  We are with his stormtroopers .  Plus he's probably behind the violent protesters.
I Just heard your suggestion  on Hannity about the education secretaries from the different countries meeting with President Trump. As a suburban mom I totally agree with you and the thought process behind it.

According to Trump it's safe enough to reopen schools despite a raging pandemic but not safe enough to have an election.
It's been obvious for months that masks are effective but the Governors of many states haven't been on board with or haven't mandated mask wearing. Same with Trump. His constant mixed messages and his eagerness to open up states while cases were rising really caused problems IMO.
Yep. And Donald Trump will win!  A delay would probably benefit the Biden campaign. He will become less and less cognizant and people will have more confidence his VP will take over quickly - that is the strategy on the left, isn‚Äôt it?

Let's get the ratings on that one shall we. After watching 3 former presidents articulate so beautifully their eulogies for John Lewis it is so apparent Trump is a cretin. It amazes me that he is still in office. Well, physically anyway.
Go ahead and postpone the election. If you think Trump is going to lose by a landslide you aint seen nothing yet. People will tar and feather Trump and anyone else who suggests this.
Politicians SUCK! A funeral is no place for a damn anti-Trump rally. Unfuckingbelievable!

Trump knows he's going to lose in November and he is preparing to challenge the results. Eventually I believe he'll be forcibly removed from the Whitehouse by Federal agents.
The falsehoods and lies that the gang of trump spin-the things they stuck in this bill let‚Äôs talk about that
FACT CHECK: The President of the United States was never meant to be a dictator. Only Congress holds the authority to delay a vote. Trump continues to lie about mail-in voting fraud. Deployed service members have voted by mail for decades.
So, it‚Äôs not safe to vote this November because of the pandemic - according to Trump.   But it‚Äôs totally safe to send your kids into the classroom right now despite the pandemic - according to Trump.
Another Trump Republican gets what he deserves. I'm now more convinced than ever it's "Bad Karma" or payback for their behavior.
By saying that Trump is forcing the Democrats to say it is safe to vote...easy to see that...

You keep tweeting all this stuff about Obama and what your going to do.  Trump you had almost 4 yrs to do all this but golfing tweeting and rallies were more important. You didn‚Äôt do it then why would anybody believe you will do it now
Yeah, but she‚Äôs a wealthy elitist with no discernible talents, just like Ivanka.  You can bet we‚Äôll be treated to interviews, news spots, television appearances, talks shows ad nauseum of Trump, his stooges, and his demon spawn
#hydroxychloriquineworks When Big Tech shuts you down your telling the truth! Isn‚Äôt this the drug President Trump was mocked for suggesting as a cure for Covid-19 back in March! Look America there‚Äôs no Sun! Lol
Demon semen.   The impeached president is publicly disagreeing with the foremost infectious disease expert in the country. A man who has worked under 6 presidents.  He is siding with a doctor who believes that tumors are caused by demon sperm.
All of these ppl blaming Trump for CV yet no one blames their state Govs. Last I checked our federal republic gives states the powers to make their own decisions‚Ä¶&amp; quite frankly IF this was all trump‚Äôs fault, we should be extremely concerned w/the power the presidency holds

Thank God for Trump. Are we in China? Why is useful medical info being suppressed? Please do something about this. These are frontline Drs. Treating and curing people. Dr Fauci is not treating anyone.
Thank God for Trump. Big Pharma, Dr Fauci and others want to push their drug. Dems don‚Äôt care if people die they just want to have power. If you get Covid DEMAND Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc. Front line Drs. Are curing people, Fauci isn‚Äôt.
Let‚Äôs say for the sake of argument that the FBI does need a new building, and they need funds for it.  Why would those funds come from a bill that‚Äôs meant to help citizens and small businesses that were financially impacted by a global pandemic?

Number one, what about the other 44% who aren't ready for schools to reopen, prob because they don't think its safe?   And how many of your 56% only want schools to open if they know it's safe?   Biden cares about our children, Trump does not. Trump only cares about the optics.
Trump has accomplished little to nothing, you have been conned.

It‚Äôs so much easier to keep your tongue in trumps ass than read a multitude of studies, opinions by the FDA and CDC because you want so badly to be liked by Trump.  Why don‚Äôt you take some,  you know, since it‚Äôs so great?
That. And I think of plausible deniability. They've been at the forefront of judicial nominations under Trump. REALLY BAD ONES in most cases. Can't quite figure out why this is the final final last straw.

It's pretty low that Trump could not even show up. But we all really know why.
To bad our governor is doing his part and playing his role as a leader. Arizona didn't have the right person for the job during this pandemic. History will tell the tail indeed of the Trump subordinate that was Arizona's governor during the pandemic.
Trump's response to everything..."You'll be hearing more about it in two weeks."
All things in front of him at the time of interview.  Good thing Person and man didn't move and confuse him.
Trump's encouragement. In July 2020, privately funded wall associated with this organization was reported to be eroding. Trump distanced himself from the group, despite his administration having awarded it a $1.7 billion contract.  #TrumpTheDisaster
Wrong! I‚Äôm a former Trumpster.  No more. Just pointing out that Trump came into office with definite things he wanted to work on, and is doing it. (Refreshing!) But there‚Äôs too much division and trouble to vote for him again.
By May 2020, only 16 miles out of 194 miles of wall constructed under the Trump administration was not replacement fencing. A private organization called We Build the Wall has constructed 0.5 miles (0.80 km) of new wall on private property near El Paso, Texas,   2/?
Trump is killing us daily but stupid #NeverBiden Bernie Bros are more concerned about Biden mispronouncing a word. Idiots!
I guess people outside the GOP have to judge the Republican Party on those elected officials, who could step up, who could impeach. And they have been ALL in on Trump. Also, we keep hearing 90+% support for Trump. You don't hear massive GOP anti-Trump voices on big matters.
You hypocritical liar. What about the other 150,000 who have died because of trump's utterly incompetent handling of the pandemic?
I wonder what trump and Russia have on the GOP??? Hmmm
Another lie.  December 17, 2019, acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Mark Morgan stated that 93 miles of barriers had been built during the Trump administration; according to CBP, at least 90 miles of that replaced existing structures.  1/?

Like how strong they are now, helping each other get through this pandemic, caring about each other and wearing masks in public to make sure that they don't infect each other, that kind of caring? Trump is toast in November.
Trump said he‚Äôd reales his taxes 4 years ago during a debate.   He hasn‚Äôt.   Why debate someone with no issue lying?

President Trump tweeted that he wants Election Day to be delayed until everyone can safely vote in person. An ASU constitutional law professor says delaying it indefinitely is unconstitutional.

Demand voter I.D.! Don't let trump cheat!
It‚Äôs amazing (I guess not really when you think about it) that  would tweet a two page glowing tribute (obviously written by a staff member because Trump has no soul) about Herman Cain and could only send a short heartless tweet when John Lewis died.
Just reflecting on the fact that Trump built a campaign around promising to build a wall - a physical blockade to keep things out - and now he and his proponents have spent the last 6 months saying that a physical blockade around your face can't possibly keep things out. Hmm.

That is a damnable lie. We have friends that live in Greece (Katereini) and they wished they had a leader like Trump over there. They want someone who will be decisive to make the economy better for small business as well as large.

Trump has done nothing different with our than the past prez. He closed the borders cause of COVID. Check out the economy under Obama. He was bringing it up and Trump came into office and it kept growing. What did he do? Nothing. It was on the coattails of Obama‚Äôs progress

Someone told Trump to show some empathy for 150,000 deaths &amp; to acknowledge that Covid is serious. Thus today's press conference: it's serious. Duh.  Tues. he endorsed a dr. who doesn't believe in masks. Wed. he was at a fundraiser in TX with almost no masks or social distancing.
That‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôve read it. Dems want to give us more money lol biweekly checks for those not working. Not a one or 2 time payment. You did see Trump give out relief to businesses that didn‚Äôt need it in the last stimulus bill right?
is making it look like the #Democrats are stalling on #unemployment #pandemic assistance for American Workers but it's actually #Republicans that want to give us the short end of the stick and they also stalled this! Trump has turned my family BLUE in November!

I was listening to an  podcast and I think I have an idea of why Trump is having such a hard time with #PDX. He told Xi to do whatever he felt was necessary to get and keep control of Hong Kong so if Trump "loses" #PDX, he looks weak in front of China.
Trump Jr?
You're not to off. The other reason we're getting traction is Trump's base is realizing they are complicit in killing us. Oops
Can I wear my welding goggles? I‚Äôve always wanted to walk around in public with that thing on.
The second that bad economic report came out this morning, Trump tweeted about delaying the election. He does this every time something happens that makes him look bad. #DistractorInChief
I simply cannot believe that Trump pulled us out of WHO in the middle of a pandemic!
No. Because a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for trump.
So I like this article. What is says is the popular vote election is not required by the constitution. What is required is the Electoral College meeting and voting.   Somebody needs to do the math and determine how many States would send tRump electors if there was no pop. Vote?
The failure of Trump's campaign is not just Trump.  Which is obvious.  It's his base. They are realizing they are complicit in killing us.
We all know there is no scenario, no circumstance in which Trump will accept losing the election or peacefully leave office, right  We all know what it‚Äôs going to come to, right

You have video of Trump executing 150k people?! Why are you sitting on this evidence?! Oh, in unrelated, have you ever looked into the Chinese government and WHO's responsibiliy for this Covid thing? Good to know you guys are sane.
Trump is a lost human that has never felt empathy or sympathy for anyone in his life and it shows everytime he talks. He grew up in a fantasy land that doesn‚Äôt exist for normal Americans.
trump, trump and trump
This is the least of our worries. He who holds the office holds the power. All trump has to do is declare the results invalid and then it's a scotus decision.
Not everyone in BLM have the same points of view. You can‚Äôt say the leader is bad so they all are. Trump is the leader of the most powerful country in the history of the world. He has done nothing beside dereg hemp and help lower drug prices. (Which just happened)

How did Trump kill them?  People knew to wash their hands, socially distance, etc., since March. So Trump can control if 330 million people do that??
Yes, it is. So what? Trump's supporters don't care and there are enough of them to re-elect him IF there isn't a significant effort to elect someone else. No one cares if this administration does something criminal.
If RNC dumps Trump because he's a loser, its going to be harder for Biden.  IMHO.
I know deeply Christian people, folks with genuine good values, who adore Trump. The worst is my Mormon friends who just don't seem to mind his lack of morals. Truly perplexing.
That‚Äôs not true. Trump downplayed the virus, but he also can‚Äôt control if 330 MILLION people choose to wash their hands often, or socially distance correctly. Everyone was told to do that since March. Lots have died since then.
It‚Äôs wild to think that even if Obama WAS a complete shit show it‚Äôd still wouldn‚Äôt hold a candle to Trump
Obama put preotectiins in place for Trans people. But since Trump wants to rollback everything Obama touches, that means to remove protections for Trans. So yes, Trump hates trans people.
Remember when Trump banned trans people from serving their country in the military? Something he purposely avoided himself.

Wasn't today's press conference a campaign message for Trump and an attack on Democrats? Isn't the Trump re-election campaign supposed to pay for that? We are numb to the corruption! Just another day in TrumpWorld - where you can never lower the bar too low!
Trump has done nothing different with our than the past prez. He closed the borders cause of COVID. Check out the economy under Obama. He was bringing it up and Trump came into office and it kept growing. What did he do? Nothing. It was on the coattails of Obama‚Äôs progress

That‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôve read it. Dems want to give us more money lol biweekly checks for those not working. Not a one or 2 time payment. You did see Trump give out relief to businesses that didn‚Äôt need it in the last stimulus bill right?
Yes. Untrue. Hard to believe but I can have a open dialog without attacking you.  Do I think Trump does everything right, HELL NO!  Trump does stupid shit for sure.  I am appalled that Republicans have abandoned any sense of fiscal responsibility, they are acting like Democrats.

How did Trump kill them?  People knew to wash their hands, socially distance, etc., since March. So Trump can control if 330 million people do that??
Yes, it is. So what? Trump's supporters don't care and there are enough of them to re-elect him IF there isn't a significant effort to elect someone else. No one cares if this administration does something criminal.
If RNC dumps Trump because he's a loser, its going to be harder for Biden.  IMHO.

It‚Äôs wild to think that even if Obama WAS a complete shit show it‚Äôd still wouldn‚Äôt hold a candle to Trump
Obama put preotectiins in place for Trans people. But since Trump wants to rollback everything Obama touches, that means to remove protections for Trans. So yes, Trump hates trans people.
If a dog dying due to Trump's negligence in handling the virus was the reason white people realized he shouldn't be president/is a bad person I'm going to throw myself down an escalator

Trump is a Liar!
Piss off with your lies about harvesting.  You should oppose Trump's attempts to close post offices and induce service delays.  Voting by mail has always been, and still is safe.  Please remind Republicans to not commit election fraud (like in NC).
We think Trump doesn't know what he's doing!!! Correction. We KNOW that Trump doesn't know what he's doing.

Who is sick of Trump praising himself? Especially when he has been such an abject failure!
Really? Trump said, "We mourn their loss." ?? Someone must have told him that he needs to recognize 154,000 deaths, more than 3 times the soldiers who died during years of the Vietnam war - and in less than 6 months! He can't sell empathy. Just doesn't have it.
Donald Trump citing a Washington Post article and then commenting how they are fake news but not in this case because the article allegedly supports his position says so very much.
Seriously? You are worried/stressing over Trumps tax returns? Don't you think he has qualified CPAs doing his books &amp; the IRS that audits him to check it all out? You iberals can't find jack about him so you snivel about the little stuff. Grow up! Trump doesn't take shit, period.

Is it me, or does Trump reading look like the cat eating ice cream?  Totally surprised at what is on the page as he is reading it, as if it's really the first time he has seen it!
Interesting how no one is allowed around trump without taking the test, isn't it??? I thought this was a Democrat hoax.
All you have to do is look at their curve. In those countries, the curve has flattened. We still going up. Trump, Pence, and Kayleigh are trying to use the word "embers," but embers are left after a fire. We are not in an embers stage in the South and Midwest. Cases are rising!
The funny thing is Trump is so bat shit crazy,he can't use that as a defense, that his normal personalty.
And the simp trump doesn‚Äôt even realize his point - elderly are at highest risk - simply underscores that  his head in the sand, keeping Americans in the dark in January, February and March needlessly endangered the most vulnerable among us. Absolutely unforgivable.
I appreciate all of the Republicans who are turning on Trump in this election, but how was him being this bad not obvious to people four years ago? Why did you need to touch the fire to know it was hot?

Such a load of crap! tRump has even stated that he has never visited a polling station, preferring to mail in his ballot, but I think it would be a safe bet to say that he‚Äôs probably never voted anyway, unless Mommy filled it all in for him.

The Unnecessary Stupid Handling of Covid Trump Super Depression
We all knew trump was trying to postpone the election all along
Herman Cain's death from the #TrumpVirus didn't have to happen. But he was mislead about wearing a mask by Trump and by Trump spreading misinformation that called it covid a hoax. His blood is on Trump's hands.
Trump can't say plasma. Keeps saying 'plaaasma.'
Wow, talk about a Trump level of stupid. IF HE CAUGHT IT AT THE RALLY HE WOULD HAVE TESTED NEGATIVE BEFORE THE RALLY. Also, I thought HCQ worked?
OK so Donald Trump doesn't know how to pronounce "plasma"
Did Donald Trump kill Herman Cain??
Fellow resisters,  I know we watch msnbc and cnn to stay informed. We may get mad at bias or under reporting but we keep watching. We are missing an important shift though.  Fox News is slowly baby step changing. It is very satisfying to watch them call trump out.   Witness it.
This is exactly why I start shit with every Trump supporter.
Dance. Cheer trump. Smile. Die.
Cain caught the Trump virus at a trump hate rally, surrounded by un-masked like-minded trump people who thought the trump virus was just a big fucking joke. I‚Äôm sorry Cain got it and died, but I‚Äôm sure his family knows that Trump is as responsible as anybody.
im sorry but trump wants to delay the election, ‚Äúto keep people safe‚Äù, but then also says he will start defunding schools if they don‚Äôt reopen. which puts millions of kids/teachers in unsafe circumstances. nah bunker boy.... you just know you‚Äôre losing the election

MR. PRESIDENT IF ONLY YOU WERE AS CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISKS OF THE " TRUMP-VIRUS " COVID-19 TO OUR CITIZENRY AS YOU ARE ABOUT BEING RE-SELECTED AS PRESIDENT THE PANDEMIC WOULD BE UNDER CONTROL BY NOW.
Hi  and  what are YOU doing to make sure  is properly funded in the stimulus bill? Why does the Pentagon need $30B *more* on top of the $700B they just got, while USPS gets $0? What are YOU doing to stop trump's stooge from sabotaging the USPS?

This is what karma looks like.  Hope his case is not serious but at the same time, given how the Minds if some Trump party members works, it could just further ingrain to him that covid isn‚Äôt dangerous.  Double edged sword.

The infamous democrat hoax that Trump talked about
I've been saying for the last year that Trump will try his hardest to retain his presidency, even attempt to serve a 3rd term (if he won in November). He sees how awfully he's doing in polls and he's trying to call on his devoted followers to campaign to delay the election.
Whilst everyone is focused on the trump disaster, neoliberals are actively seeking their own destruction. The people we used to depend on are silent and that's cowardice.
tRump is a joke. How disingenuous this bullshit used by his administration.  Oh he's joking.  Then asked later I'm never kidding . 4 more years of him  I swear I'll move.

Trump cannot donate plasma because he takes finasteride (likely for his hair and not prostate). That would nullify his blood/plasma.

The absolute dunce cannot even do a condolence tweet without also doing something goofy that makes Twitter snicker for hours on end. This would almost certainly seem like an intentional bit if Trump were not literally the most unbelievably stupid man on Earth.
Ya know what fucking baffles me? I‚Äôve seen Trump get so much shit for the past 5 years. No one in my social circle likes him. But I still can‚Äôt fathom why so many people admire him?? If Trump is the worst human being alive, why did over 60 million Americans vote for him in 2016?
You're all talk because you're facing a tough election otherwise you're in Trump's pocket.

And worst of all, he was raving about how dangerous it would be to elect Trump in the first place, then voted no on impeachments because he was afraid he'd lose his own personal interests.
Trump clearly ascribes to fascist ideology. This is obvious. His entire platform is based around white nationalism.   I dont know how many ways I can explain that just because he isnt literally Hitler doesn't mean he isnt a fascist.
I don't usually agree with GOP leadership but John Thune gets this right. Referring to a Trump tweet about delaying the election.  "I think that's probably a statement that gets some press attention, but I doubt it gets any serious traction."
That's because the engine of our economy is consumer &amp; b2b demand. Everyone knows this.  Now that 10's of millions are jobless, or under-employed &amp; losing everything, Trump still has no COVID plan, &amp; the Senate thinks 200 bucks is enough, what other reaction was possible?

All this to say, who would benefit most from a delayed election? The jury is out on Trump, and people want the chance to vote for someone new. Our country has been drifting towards authoritarian rule for sometime, and delayed elections are a hallmark of a sprouting dictatorship..

Such poor logic.   No, Trump is not Hitler. Trump having not done the things Hitler has does not make him not a fascist. Fascism is not an action, it's an ideology. By your logic then a low ranking Nazi janitor wasn't a fascist either because he wasn't Hitler.
I don't think I've seen both parties more united in a long time than they are on this: we are NOT moving the election.  There WILL be an election in November!  (Should we thank President Trump for uniting Democrats and Republicans?).

How did Trump kill them?  People knew to wash their hands, socially distance, etc., since March. So Trump can control if 330 million people do that??

It‚Äôs wild to think that even if Obama WAS a complete shit show it‚Äôd still wouldn‚Äôt hold a candle to Trump
Obama put preotectiins in place for Trans people. But since Trump wants to rollback everything Obama touches, that means to remove protections for Trans. So yes, Trump hates trans people.
If a dog dying due to Trump's negligence in handling the virus was the reason white people realized he shouldn't be president/is a bad person I'm going to throw myself down an escalator

Yeah he died today he got sick on the second he was at the Trump rally in Louisiana 12 days before those are the timeline facts everything else at this point is The Emperor's New Clothes followers insisting that he's dressed nice
Trump and his enablers have been plotting about how to interfere and/or delay the 2020 Election! America will not have to wait much longer to see how it manifests!! Be wise and intelligent and GO VOTE, VOTE, VOTE!!!!!
You obviously to listen to trump. Your post as confused. Can't even read yours. Makes no sense. Stop listening to trump/Fox or....stop drinking.
Lol. I thought u tweeted chubby. My bad
whose positions flip flop every time Trump tweets is calling someone else partisan and political?  I'd like to see what high ground she thinks she stands on.
If you don't think that Trump is sabotaging the USPS - see the saga of my contact lenses which were to be delivered in PHX on 7/28 (via FedEx/USPS).  Arrived in PHX on 7/25 and then went to Chandler, AZ, (10 miles away) and are coming back to PHX on July 30.

One thing Trump has done that I'm grateful for is teaching Americans they are no less barbaric, susceptible to fascism, and base than the citizens of the countries which they invade in the name of democracy.

This is a tweet from a righty (Trump‚Äôs stagnated base) who‚Äôs going to lose BIG.   Trump said so himself - increased voter turnout will lose him the election. Why else do you think he is trying to suppress the vote? Because Trump is well known for his ‚Äúhonesty‚Äù and ‚Äúethics‚Äù?

I think 2 of the 3 judges were Trump appointees, no?
I understand and respect that. I wish I could be the same.  Herman Cain was no Donald Trump. He did have major faults, and one of those was his enabling of that nightmare.  And now the world has one less advocate of evil with whom to deal.  To his family, my condolences.
Is that him when he was little he was adorable and of course Trump backs handed him what a jag off
Was it a Memorial or a Trump bashing event? Leftists don't seem to know how to honor the dead.
Really Bill. President Trump knew exactly what all of the fools would say as soon as he hit the Tweet button. I'm shocked that you are one of those fools. You get the daily "Dumbest Smart Guy Award"
Well theres 1 less trump vote.
Agree. Trump‚Äôs a terrible speaker. And he‚Äôs selfish &amp; obnoxious. But I like how he ran for office knowing what he wanted to work on. Immigration, Europe taking advantage of us $$, getting vets timely medical care, removing red tape/duplicate regs that hurt business,  trade, etc.
Then I guess trump shouldn‚Äôt be trying to delegitimize his win, if he‚Äôs so confident he can beat Biden.
Oh but Trump was over the line in the Rose Garden....can‚Äôt wait to see how great they all say this üí© was!

The infamous democrat hoax that Trump talked about
I've been saying for the last year that Trump will try his hardest to retain his presidency, even attempt to serve a 3rd term (if he won in November). He sees how awfully he's doing in polls and he's trying to call on his devoted followers to campaign to delay the election.
Whilst everyone is focused on the trump disaster, neoliberals are actively seeking their own destruction. The people we used to depend on are silent and that's cowardice.
"right now in a number of states the laws allow a baby to be born from his or her mother's womb in the 9th month. It is wrong, it has to change" - Donald J. Trump on Jan 20, 2018

Suicidal Trump supporters. #NoSympathyForGOP
But he also doesn‚Äôt want to actually vote for women and against Trump, so.....he‚Äôs exactly what he always appeared to be at his confirmation hearings. A whiny coward who refuses to accept responsibility for his own actions.
And what the President did in the Rose Garden was so offensive - give me a break!   This is a mans funeral....but I‚Äôm sure he wanted that or there could have been no better way to speak about a man blah blah blah - always right for for them but never right for Trump!
Trump cannot donate plasma because he takes finasteride (likely for his hair and not prostate). That would nullify his blood/plasma.
My guess, Kayleigh McEnany will have extreme difficulty getting an honorable job, even a fast food job is honorable, she isn't. No one will want to have someone associated with trump after he's booted out.

Give me one reason you're voting for Biden without using the word Trump
That's probably true. I find it incredibly funny that he thinks he is a serious candidate for president. In 2024. He is so abrasive with none of the cult of personality Trump seems to have.
It's been obvious for months that masks are effective but the Governors of many states haven't been on board with or haven't mandated mask wearing. Same with Trump. His constant mixed messages and his eagerness to open up states while cases were rising really caused problems IMO.
#Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan tells #Foxnews that his relationship with #Trump is a little frosty these days. President Trump doesn‚Äôt like hearing criticism.

And worst of all, he was raving about how dangerous it would be to elect Trump in the first place, then voted no on impeachments because he was afraid he'd lose his own personal interests.
Trump clearly ascribes to fascist ideology. This is obvious. His entire platform is based around white nationalism.   I dont know how many ways I can explain that just because he isnt literally Hitler doesn't mean he isnt a fascist.
I don't usually agree with GOP leadership but John Thune gets this right. Referring to a Trump tweet about delaying the election.  "I think that's probably a statement that gets some press attention, but I doubt it gets any serious traction."
That's because the engine of our economy is consumer &amp; b2b demand. Everyone knows this.  Now that 10's of millions are jobless, or under-employed &amp; losing everything, Trump still has no COVID plan, &amp; the Senate thinks 200 bucks is enough, what other reaction was possible?

Trump has always been inept, self-absorbed and dishonest ‚Äî now he‚Äôs also an accessory to mass murder -  In other words Trump is saying "We're Getting Ready To Get Ready."  VOTE NOVEMBER 3!  I WANT TO SAY ON THAT DATE "TRUMP, YOU'RE FIRED!"
A GOP staffer just sent a damning note about a Republican lawmaker who just tested positive for coronavirus   Louie Gohmert, Jim Jordan, and Trump may very well be the stupidest people in office in history.
A GOP staffer just sent a damning note about a Republican lawmaker who just tested positive for coronavirus   Louie Gohmert is to Congress what Trump is to POTUS.  The Dimmest Bulbs Of All Time.  And Very Dangerous To The American People.
Brahm once again spreads fake news....he didn't try to "contact" Ivanka Trump  Here is the twitter message he sent
I really wish you had been elected in 2016. Stand strong and take Christian confrontations against injustice! Fascism is being used by Trump to try to control USA.

"TRAITOR TRUMP"!!!!!  THE COMPLETE MENDACIOUS LOWLIFE!!!!!
"TRAITOR TRUMP"  YOU MENDACIOUS JEALOUS OF FAUCI SUBHUMAN SCUM!!!!!
Ask Ducey what is in his medicine cabinet. He shadows Trump as much as inhumanly possible.
Say they risk everything, and GET Barr, but lose the WH. Was the gamble worth it? Is having Barr worth keeping Trump?
Nancy Pelosi takes care of the American people. Trump is the one who has repeatedly demonstrated his interests are with corporations and the wealthy.
Roleplaying as a 65 year old Trump loving boomer in a Facebook group chat is the highlight of my life right now. I need to stop being so single.
Maybe the 2nd to allow himself to dominate Trump in the news throughout the week. I think he already made his decisionüòå maybe just in the process of getting her Secret Service etc!
"TRAITOR TRUMP"!!!!!  YOU MENDACIOUS, SUBHUMAN SCUM!!!!!  YOU NACISSITIC JEALOUS LOWLIFE, JEALOUS OF DR. FAUCI'S DESERVED POPULARITY WAY ABOVE YOU DUE TO HIS UNTEGRITY, HONESTY, AND EMPATHY!!!!!  TRAITS YOU ASSURIDLY DO NOT POSSESS!!!!!

Amazing how fast Trump can run down the ramp when when his lies and misinformation catch up to him. This boy is sick, so I‚Äôm not sure what you call his supporters, other than cult members.
Infuriates me that you all consider AG Barr Trump's protector. How about Eric Holder who proudly boasted that he was Obama's "wing man?" Didn't hear a peep from you insane Dems then.

Trump is working hard to preserve our country and save it from ppl like you.
Damn dude...u sound like President Body Bags(Trump)...‚Äùbut, whaddabout this and whaddabout that?
No one likes me.  over 150,000 Americans and their families may agree.   Trump continues to spread misinformation
Like i have been saying   There will be no justice in America against those who tried a CoupDe'tat against our elected POTUS TRUMP.  They committed crimes against standing laws in our country YET #DONOTHINGDOJ  COVERS UP, DELAYS,&amp; DOES NOTHING.   American justice
I would vote to replace Sen Graham with a tuna fish can;  sorry the Tomato can is reserved for Trump!
Agree!  But his base just loves this because it is disrespectful to a Black man who is a thousand times the American that Trump is or ever will be!
#TrumpKillsTexas.  Remember the mass shooting in El Paso? Now COVID19 deaths? Trump kills Texans!
Trump is involved so he's probably making money off of this and it is going to be a catastrophic failure.
Did you see Trump‚Äôs news conference today? You need to do something. We‚Äôre in the middle of a crisis and the POTUS is losing it! #25thAmendmentNow
You have come up with too little too late.  You have failed and now you are trying to redeem yourself. Your obedience to Trump has cost our state dearly. You need to repent and resign, the people know you as the no-mask-mandate cowardly Governor.
LMAO #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpleThinSkin #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsALoser #TrumpResignNow #Trump Is #MoronInChief  may be if you stop taking the concoction of pills you touted at your 5pm roasting u may remember if anyone wants u throwing a pitch!
Trump's never been good at anything. I expect that this will fully blow up in his face.
Trump is not a doctor.   Also, neither is Ducey
Please do not listen to Trump on covid19 misinformation.  It is your life protect it
You need to wash your face Debbie Do nothing Lesko!! You have some of Donald Trump‚Äôs face cream on your mustache
Trump blaming others for his behavior and actions!!!
I like to see Tom cotton tarred and feathered for his comments and his gaslighting and his behavior in letting Trump get away with what he‚Äôs doing
99%  Of Republicans are doing just this sticking their heads in the Ground!!!!! Wishing everyone doesn‚Äôt see their complicity into Trump‚Äôs Behavior and Actions!!!
It was cool for Joe Biden to "blackmail" the President of Ukraine, but it‚Äôs an impeachable offense if Donald Trump inquiries about it.  Biden has lying down to a science - thing is he's stupid so the lies are easy to catch.
is finally getting down to business  Why is Barr not investigating  for commuting Roger Stone's sentence in exchange for Roger Stone's silence?  Stone can incriminate Trump for lying under oath to the Mueller investigation
His children have jobs in trump‚Äôs Administration
Everything she claims is false  Just a Trump Hack.
Ps I don‚Äôt support trump.
An unemployed bitch might be pressed but if it wasn‚Äôt for daddy trump you wouldn‚Äôt even be dressed.
EVERYONE U support is despicable, immoral, corrupt reprehensible, those  who have no right to be leader of any kind. Trump=a patriot who will stand for our Constitution and the good of ALL Americans. He doesn't pander to identity groups divided by Obama &amp; his disgusting lackeys.
He is literally failing the state of Florida. FL is now the epicenter of a global pandemic.   Closed late and open early follow no guidelines.    Trump Hack   SWAT
Big Tech CENSORED Trump Video About Doctors And COVID, This Is The BIGGEST Censorship Scandal EVER  via
The pic is junk mail for Online Trading. Not addressed to me but everyone. I assume this is as valud as Trump University... maybe less of a scam?
Spineless  let Trump off the hook for extorting Ukraine  How funny if he eventually goes to prison for hawking Goya beans  We've got a #TrumpRacketeer in the
Don't have to look far to find COVID incompetence, subjugation to Putin, emoluments grifting (flight crews laying over at a Trump golf club!), and lies, lies, lies, all the time to talk about  We've got a #TrumpRacketeer and a #CryBabyTrump in the
I missed my nephew‚Äôs and my Godson‚Äôs HS graduation in Las Vegas; I missed my family reunion in Chicago; I miss my sister in Michigan and was unable to help nurse her through her bout with COVID. She survived thank God and no thanks to Trump. I miss my life.
The Fauci on naughty boy list, I‚Äôd be packing my office if I was him, Trump will make it his priority to fire him before November...Night if Halloween is my bet..
Is your career really worth whatever has you chained to Trump? Is your soul worth it? The people who voted for you trusted you and you‚Äôre killing them. You‚Äôre failing the character test.
Yes, trump‚Äôs that evil !!!!!
I am a supporter of my POTUS TRUMP.  But  IF THE DOJ WOULD START TO PROSICUTE THE DEEP STATE COUPDE'TAT INDIVIDUALS THEN YOU WOULD SEE THE SUPPORTERS OF ALL THIS VIOLENCE START TO LEAVE OUR COUNTRY OUT of fear that they will be the next FEDERAL PRISONER

So what was trump talking about when he said inject disinfectant?? Nothing is a coincidence
President Trump suggested that Twitter's trending topics are 'illegal' because they make him look bad, and he is a shit human being.
I left shortly after Trump was elected.  It was a $hit$how back then.  What is going on is nothing new...folks act like this just started.  I remember watching them lite a car in fire because they had a Trump bumper sticker sticker.  It was a war zone back then.
Trump's not quite the racist that you are and always have been, Joe w/ very long history of racism. As typical Democrat, U project ur sins on others:opposed school bussing, integration of schools, befriended KKKByrd,wrote 1994 Criminal Act that was hardest on Black people. cont'd
I read the book. It is well dicumented, and favorite book sof 10 I‚Äôve read on Trump. Everyone should read Unger‚Äôs book!
I‚Äôm in Arizona and am experiencing the same. Not one person that I know who voted for Trump in 2016 says they‚Äôre voting for him again. Not One. In a historically red state - Not One.
.....Donald Trump represents the absolute worst in our country.  He is morally bankrupt and a lying socialpath.  I call on all Americans, regardless of party, to standup for common decency and our Country and denonce this man!
Trump's gonna ask to speak to the manager of Twitter
Trump will never criticize Russia.  Someday we will find out why. Porn video? #TrumpleThinSkin
Trump the #popstar
You blubbering fool.  YOU can't handle the truth. Trump is the best president of the U.S. of modern times.

Also, Biden has the eyes of a dragon. He‚Äôs not scared to make the stand he needs to make. Trump will become the outsider who, hopefully will move to ‚ÄòSalem‚Äôs Lot  and work the night shift at the institute since he‚Äôll probably have insomnia üëçüèΩ

Trump was on his way back for a second term. Greatest economy in history would have sealed the deal. The Socialist People's Democrat Workers Party aka Democrats. Tried everything to shut him down. The Chinamancovid19 virus was the answer to their prayers. Don't let it work!!!

Where's the Fat Man's mask?  I guess it's a myth, too. And all the $billions of burning, looting, beatings, shootings, threats &amp; destruction are just a Right Wing Trump cartoon, correct?
trump‚Äôs America, where children are brutalized for being children.
Trump wouldn‚Äôt understand Steve because, unlike Trump, Steve speaks in complete sentences and uses polysyllabic words.
Should I really believe that Arizonas numbers have gone down 40 percent in 2 weeks since Trump took over handling them?  I don't think so.
Trump. Arizona
99 bottles of beers on the wall, 99 bottles of beer, take one down passed it around and elect President Trump again! 99 day folks!
Let's see you at age 70!  Fauci is obviously not an athlete and never was.  Trump is active and athletic.
If Trump has something to do in rushing this vaccine I am worried.  He should take it first to test.   He just lies too much
Arizona!  Trump 2020
Arizona Trump 2020
Pence earned his spot on ticket when he ‚Äòendorsed‚Äô Ted Cruz in Indy primary and then spent the next 15 minutes praising trump   Trump romped  and the rest of the primaries sealed it   Rewatch pence endorsement   Amazing
The only terrifying part is that people think this all started with trump... started a looooong time ago folks
I tried to find a video of POTUS TRUMP getting home from Tulsa OK.  Rally to post and show A PRESIDENT THAT IS TIRED BUT STILL FIGHTS FOR THE AMERICAN CITIZENS.  ALL the videos I found had NEGATIVE tag lines. So not posting that crap.   POTUS stay strong IGY6.
Someone will lose their temper while carrying a AK47, start firing killing many law enforcement officers, then all hell will breakout. Then Democrats leaders will try a blame President Trump, knowing full well they could‚Äôve stopped all rioting at its beginning.
No I honestly can say there are some I would not play with but Trump is one I would in a heartbeat
As you start getting election mailers in for senators, note which ‚Å¶ ones are missing any mention of ‚Å¶ Don‚Äôt worry, I have a reference for how Senators voted! #AmericaOrTrump
Guess Trump stays in office then! Sounds good to me
We love you keep telling the truth.  We need reporters like you.  Trump bullies anyone that does not worship him

More important than bounties on our soldiers?  Really?  If foreign assistance in a presidential campaign is acceptable to you, why are you upset about this?  Oh. Right. Because the Trump campaign got caught. Got it.   #100DaysToGo #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
Trump really has a fat hind end look at his pants
Brett Favre is goosing Trump !!
Trump doesn‚Äôt truly have a Chance!!!
Trump,Racist,Narcissist,Idiot,Failure.   Remember these 5 words. He spend the day on golf course.  #realDonaldTrump
Trump is calling protesters who disagree with him terrorists. That puts him in the company of the world's autocrats.   #TrumpThreatensAmerica
If Biden can't do an interview with other than the bought and paid for Liberal media, will he be able to debate Donald Trump or use the virus as his excuse?  Will voters care?
The system worked, ballots in question were see aside and not counted.
Really dude? It‚Äôs a haboob that knocked down a couple panels of unfinished wall. I‚Äôm not a Trump supporter but this isn‚Äôt some big story or shot at Trump. Everything is so divisive in this country and you aren‚Äôt helping anything. Go back to posting hilarious videos please.
What a joke! Your only ‚ÄòStrong  Focus‚Äô is on how to stay out of prison and how many more rounds of golf you can play before you go to prison. You‚Äôre done Trump! Oh, and it‚Äôs the The Trump Virus üòâ
Trump's problem is no state stands for grifters racketeering in the
no crowd could boo Trump out of the stadium for a botched pandemic response like a Yankee crowd
Trump knows he would get booed out of Yankee Stadium
Trump knows he can not win a war with China be it hot or financial. It would send the world into a depression and Trump would be blamed. A proxy war (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Kashmir.....) yes very likely.
Pelosi dubs Trump 'Mr. Make Matters Worse' over his handling of coronavirus pandemic   Pelo si and the rest of the dems in government need to be taken out and shot!!!
I've never trusted u-sabotaging Republicans, the STRONG conservatives who've Trump's back &amp;should NOT separate themselves from him. If they do, they're sure to lose the Senate-Pres Trump will have to deal with a Democrat Senate working against him as House now does.

Please support  as he tries to unseat Trump mouthpiece
What was Trump doing calling it a hoax?  Refresh your memory.  But that is not the point, what has he done was here.  failure
COVID-19 will decide.  Biden is not beating Trump, COVID-19 is beating Trump.
Trump and our Governor Ducey are still hoping it will just magically go away.  Internal FEMA memo reveals Arizona coronavirus patients taken to New Mexico over staffing shortages: report
I have been saying that Trump sending his goons to cities is a dry run for D.C. in case he loses. If that happens the military will frog march him out of the White House wearing a straight jacket.
I get angrier and sadder by the minute.  There are SO MANY distractions happening all at once and so much death.  What is going on behind the scenes with trump that we are not even hearing about because of all of the chaos he has caused?
I am not a genius like Trump but here is my test.    Trump, Racist, Narcissist, Idiot, Failure.   I am sur to remember this until 3 Nov 20 #EveryonesLaughingAtYouDonald
That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre voting for Biden Trump has torn America apart
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Does anyone know how I can donate directly to Trump campaign?  No RNC, WINRED or any other organization just to POTUS
So you're doing this to help trump again?
Where is all the media coverage for the black man gunned down Thursday Oh I know he was a Trump supporter so he doesn‚Äôt get coverage.  No bias here
Trump‚Äôs going to screw up FEMA response to the hurricane‚Äôs
So what about DeSantis, Ducey, Abbott, all the other Trump ass kissin governors that r literally killing people by not doing their jobs?  I can tell u where they need to go!!!
It doesn't matter that the law wants local/state goats. to invite the Fed govt. in.  Ppl see this as Trump not doing anything to stop the anarchy as much as Biden won't/can't. Trump MUST take decisive steps now to put these anarchists down &amp; away if he wants votes, not chaos.
My fear, BIG one, is that ppl blame Trump for not acting, not stopping the violence. We look &amp; ask "Why isn't our govt. stopping this?" Voters will see Trump as not doing anything (just as Biden won't, can't, refuses) AND IT WILL COST PRES.TRUMP A LOT OF VOTES UNLESS HE ACTS NOW!
