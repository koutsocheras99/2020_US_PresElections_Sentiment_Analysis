Do they really expect us to believe Biden is the one tweeting these tweets because I know this is how the PR team is moving rn
when is Biden going to announce his VP
Hilarious... Biden didn't write this apology!! He doesn't even remember giving the speech!!! 🤣🤣🤣
I am Joe Biden and I approve this message.
Yeah, so no. You have a choice between Trump or Biden period. Pathetic if you would even remotely consider to vote for Trump or 3rd party.
If opposed by someone who knows what they are doing (Trump) and not someone who is courting their vote (Biden), or any other sorry-ass Democrat.
Whine whine whine me me me, you all know the world circles around me so I never have to shut up with the crazy talk, never.  I have no idea how good a debater Joe Biden, he’s going to eat my lunch.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait....  Is Biden incompetent and feeble  OR  Is he powerful enough to hurt God  Which is it????
As person who prefers Republicans to democrats but likes Biden (the person) more than trump and sees both parties paying less attention to people with my views, I feel the only way I can make my voice heard is voting for someone else.
I'm waiting to order my  gear til he announced his VP so I can have both names on my bumper sticker, hat, and shirt.  Please Joe make it #BidenHarris2020 Biden/Harris!
Biden’s dad, a car salesman, traded in Joe’s old car and his wife’s car for the corvette as a wedding gift to them in 1966.
Can You Drive?   #Biden
Leftists want him to be president. If he debates trump it would be for entertainment purposes. It would be funny with what joe Biden says.
Biden leads Trump by nearly 40 points in California: poll   California must have the highest percentage of idiots of any state in the union!
Remember! If you voted for trump last time and now vote for Biden it’s like +2 for Biden! We need more Republicans to switch!
NO Biden was the vice prez.
Anyone who thinks Biden shouldn’t debate Trump should google up some earlier Biden debates, he might be best debater in my lifetime.
Biden will eat Trumps lunch in a debate, he is a great debater &amp; he’ll call Trumps lies out, while Trump still has the floor.  Biden is knowledgeable on history, military, trade agreements, he can talk details &amp; defuse untruths
Biden scraps plans to travel to Milwaukee for nomination acceptance, citing coronavirus concerns, the White House is not a Nursing home he needs to scrap the White House plan and move into a memory care unit.
Probally a biden fan
I would watch what you say about Biden being a demented buffoon... Cause we all know you are beating the world in covid - 19.  Best ever, never seen before, simply amazing... I have been saying it wrong my whole life.
And now, some good news:   Trump approval back to 51% and supporters 70% more enthusiastic than Biden’s
Cover for Biden
Lol You will have to support the VP because Joe Biden is not capable of running a country he’s barely capable of being a nursing home and when you’re talking about life or death if you’re talking about Covid then why what is there no social distancing At this funeral
Vote for Joe Biden so you too can sniff children together #VoteTrump2020
I’m sure working with two big time segregationists was merely a coincidence as well 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Biden is a racist and a sexual predator haha but you keep calling him decent. Please do your research before you call Biden decent. Ask the hundreds of thousands of people who were victims of his mass incarceration bill how decent he is...just stop man!!
I honestly have no preference in this election. Much like in 2016, it proves the two party system is the biggest flaw in our political system. Trump is terrible, and Biden is a joke as well so I will probably vote for the 3rd party candidate again 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Biden slams Trump, McConnell for 'political games' with further coronavirus aid  via
His grandchild that Hunter had out of wed-lock but denied could have possibly helped him, but I’ll bet he has never seen her once! Just some low-class trash that should have been aborted. Joe “Archie Bunker” Biden for President. As for me, I’ll vote to keep what I have.
One would think that being in office for 8 years would have given him the opportunity to do this.  I’m sure Biden widen will make it happen... oh wait he was a Senator for 37 years.
There is no world where Biden is ahead of/even with Cooper.
Liberal democrats! See what you get by with if Biden gets elected!
He was a Dem his whole carreer and was highest ranking senator prior to his death (Biden spoke at his funeral)...  He voted NAY on the 1964 civil rights act (vote roll pictured below)...
This is only because he thinks he may lose. Any time he's behind in the polls, he calls it fake news. Should Biden win, we all know he's going to claim the polls were rigged. It's like he can't accept fault in any way, shape, and/or form.
But see, Democrats can do that because they aren’t racist like Republicans. And he’s excused for everything else he has said and done that was racist in his past because he is Democrat. Yeah, that Barak is certainly a clean and well-spoken black. Joe “Archie Bunker” Biden.
I see. I think November will be a lose/lose for our country. Sleepy Joe is a joke. Trump thrives off this power which isn’t what you want. Narcissistic af. Starts shit. Atleast he’s mentally aware tho. Biden 4 prez is elder abuse at this point
And if Biden wins you get to live in a Communist Country and live in a city looking like Portland does now. You want be able to piss unless the government allows you.
All kanye tryna do is steal the black vote from Joe Biden 💯he ain't got me fooledHarris is a sellout. She chastised Biden in the debates for his segregationism and now supports him. Proof democrats don't care about America. They care about power and control... and #BidenIsARacist
Come on man. No one believes your malarkey. Long history of #JoeBidenIsRacist
Even lefty Snopes says it true #BidenIsARacist
I don't understand why people think Trump is going to walk away with the debates. Yes, Biden struggled to put two sentences together but so does Trump.
I saw the same thing yesterday but his name was Joe Biden!
Naw, you can't unsay racist comments. Any apology would be any empty attempt to save face. Biden's record and comments are decades long and further enlightens the fact that #BidenIsARacist.
I have a feeling they’re going to swap Biden out or put in a VP that can hold their salt. Watch for a celebrity or a strong minority leader. They always know how to tug on the heart strings to get votes.
nope.
has been and always will be #BidenIsARacist
When Vice President and Presidential Nominee Joe Biden says “Junkie” it further calls for why #LanguageMatters and why each of us should pick up a shovel and treat the soil and environment we live in.
This article is beeeeeeeee esssssssss. Biden could have a houseplant for a running mate and he would still get my vote.
Unscripted  shows his true colors.
Not Joe.
He fumbled it decades ago...
back peddle this #JimCrowJoe
Trump is definitely spiraling downward when has has to accuse Biden of doing something to hurt the almighty something that the orange Cheeto head does regularly.
There’s plenty of qualified, amazing female in this country; anyone would do an amazing job as VP.   And (mandatory joke) Biden has binders full of them (Badum, Tssssss! ducks for cover)
So Joe Biden is a level 20 dnd character!
Oh, come on man. Tell folks about this.
Military mom &amp; educator,  will give the keynote address at the  volunteer leadership conference, Gun Sense University this Sunday!   Sign up to get an email reminder to watch with me:  #GSU2020 #TeamJoe
You wanted me to say one thing about Biden that didn’t mention Trump so I mentioned the one thing Biden is that Trump isn’t: he’s a good person.
Trump is trash for a million other reasons. He’s an idiot, too, but I used his issues with the word Yosemite as an example. Just the most recent one. I want Biden as president for one reason only: he’s going to beat Trump in November
Joe Biden is a good, decent man. There.
Trump is a pathological liar. And an absolute moron. I’d be more confident in Joe Biden 100%. Was he my first choice in primaries? No. Is he the obvious choice for the soul of our Democracy in November? 1000% yes. Trump is an embarrassment. An all-time loser on a historical level
Wrong.
Biden standing up going into WH with 22 point lead.  With his woman of color VP pick he will have a 35 point lead....Joe is in the coasting mode.
Biden should have never committed himself to a women. Doing so boxed him into picking a women of color.
Guess you want a racist in the WH.
Kamala Harris, Karen Bass, Susan Rice, and Elizabeth Warren are all bad picks imo but if I was Biden and I would gamble with Susan Rice
I still think Keisha Bottoms and Amy Klobuchar were the two best VP picks for Biden
Okay man. Whatever. Read the article. Don’t read the article. Believe it. Don’t believe it. Muh Trump. Muh Biden. We get it.
You will see a broken country if Biden wins.
Biden knows more about roaches and kids jumping on his lap than he does about COVID-19. Keep the record player on at night there Joe.
Black America suffered from you failed leadership.
Yelp...and Joe Biden has been in Washington for 50 years, tell us what he's done for America.
Um, him and his boy Obama put kids in cages.
Nothing. He hasn't for 50 years.
The most common reason is that they want to vote for Biden because they believe that’s the most likely way to prevent Trump from having a second term. Secondary to that is they dislike elements of the libertarian platform. Their preferred candidate was typically Elizabeth Warren.
On Biden's short list.  #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
If the democrats floated out a mop in a bucket as Trump's opposition, I would vote for that combo. I don't think Biden is more than a one term president.   5. Last reason, Biden isn't a whiny bitch looking for adoration and validation.  #DumpTrump2020 /end
I can't give a definitive on what Biden is or is proposing to do while in office. I can tell you what he is not.  1. He is not Trump.  2. He is not an intentional racist. 3. He is not under investigation from multiple authorities for crimes committed. 1/?
No Matter What Happens, Joe Biden Can't Slither Out of Debating Trump
Wow, in the debates she blasts him for this. Now she wants him to win. This is typical of democrats. The don't believe in anything, definitely not America.
I have a dime on the person being VP pick who Biden secretly told he would make his VP in 2016 if he ran. She speaks to him regularly on policy. She polls as swaying the most undecideds. She has coathoured opeds w him and had the most $ raised for him.
So you're saying you want a known racist to be President, gotcha.
Biden Announces $775B Plan to Boost the Caregiver Economy, Support In-Home Care Providers

Maybe this where you should spend your energy instead of working against VP Biden and stating there is no difference in Trump and VP Biden.  Learn how to be a graceful loser maybe you learn how to win over more people for your candidate.
Is that your car or mine? - Joe Biden
Of course Biden plans to tax the crap out of  and  if he's elected.  also.
Biden is the systemic racist that has done ANYTHING good for race relations in 50. #WakeUpAmerica
then you don't want Biden.
I truly believe that. I can’t believe we are about to have such a crucial election without debates. All Biden is doing is showing his lying commercials and allowing the Democratic Party to fuel more lies and do everything they can to destroy our country.
Joe Biden is going to throttle you at the polls. Prepare for a good old fashioned thumping, loser!
Lemme start some thing.... Biden is a complete shit show, gov. Cooper Is a complete fuck tard. This whole pandemic could be fixed so easily. Black lives will always matter, NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK! Trump has done more for minorities them Obama did. The Media in the USA sucks!!!!

As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals.
I would love to see Dr. Rice who served Pres. Obama and Vice-Pres. Biden.
Bill Clinton is 4 years younger than Joe Biden.
The Mayor of Atlanta is still the best VP pick for Biden
I'm sure the Biden folks really like me. LOL
Sure thing....has soon as America prosecutes Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, McCabe, Peter Strzok, Clapper, Brennan, and James Comey.  John Durham's got facts and evidence against these Democrat crooks and all Democrats have against Trump is accusations.
No way Trump can win, Joe Biden has a 22 point lead and he's coasting to the WH...regardless of his VP pick.
Joe Biden is awesome. He can do more from a basement than fatass wandering aimlessly around photo-ops.
Suicide bombers, the use of human shields, gays thrown off buildings, women being stoned to death, little girls being disfigured by acid for wanting an education, women imprisoned for being gang raped, honor killings, soldiers set on fire in cages.
I’m definitely with Biden and he will make a good president. Can’t wait to see his VP pick!!
No he does not. In fact one can argue that Biden is more responsible than any other politician left or right for mass incarcerations. His crime bill that he pushed for was extremely draconian. Research it, even Reagan was against it and Biden pushed it
This is what happened in marxist America, in Biden’s America. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica

With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has announced he will choose his running mate next week.
Guys seriously where is Trumps version of Joe Biden? Can we please elect that version of Joe Biden? Like I will do some very questionable and unethical shit for that version of Joe Biden. Meanwhile in reality our two choices are an establishment Dem and Putin’s bottom bitchChip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
constantly lies about EVERYTHING and  stays silent.  Biden makes speaking "gaffe" and
You can't be a devout Catholic (Biden) &amp; be a liberal Democrat. It's HIPOCRISY if you believe in ABORTION.
Think its pretty obvious Biden looks down on the Black community
Whatever you say CW.  Should I assume that since you support Biden, you enjoy sniffing little girls hair?  If you don't agree with CW, you ain't black?  Keep painting with your broad brush.
This article is so irresponsible. Trump is dangerous and mentally unfit, and there is no one that Biden could pick as his VP that would in any way shape or form justify not voting for him over Trump.
Is it better? Biden’s age is the reason everyone is stressing his VP. Normally it’s to satisfy a large demographic, in this case, it’s really to step in and become President when the time arises. Who he chooses will decide the Presidency!
I see many voters sitting this 1 out. Biden’s whole campaign is “ I’m not Trump! “ Biden turns 78 in Nov. I wouldn’t want a 78 yr. old driving me in a car, much less running the country! There will be backlash, but Dems need to blame themselves! They had 4 years to groom a champ!
The left uses every trick in the book to keep Biden off that stage with Trump! They come up with every lie and excuse to keep him away from Trump!  Biden is mentally impaired...America isn't fooled! Biden smells of fear!
What are you complaining about Joe Biden things black Americans don't think but all the same
Yeah Joe Biden is nothing but a puppet
Imagine we pay for flying this creature everywhere,  hi auto, his advance team, his secret service team, the 2 other planes w nuclear codes and backup. All to hear him say Biden is hurting God. You racist MF that still support this evil abomination. God bless your hearts
Probably. But, few of us are fundamentally persuadeable, right? Regardless of which party/which candidate we prefer. Like the few % who may vote Biden but might have  voted Trump over Bernie. Which is why the Dems blocked Bernie, but are pushing Biden 2 run on Bernie's views.
Is he talking about Biden or John Lennon?  Either way count me in.
C'mon Eric... why drag  and  on this?  is getting sh-tcanned for 'Darling  (&lt;-- see what I did there?) once Biden announces his VP candidate. And Kayleigh will 3 or 4 Press Secretaries in the past and writing her memoir by then....
Biden: Blacks all think the same way
"I support BLM. I support the removal of the statue of liberty, it represents racism and oppression. If elected president on day 1 I will sign legislation for its immediate removal." Joe Biden     Think about that America, vets.
Not voting for Trump isn’t the same as supporting Biden. I think privately you do, but why not say it?! It doesn’t make you less of a conservative to say Joe is the best choice AND the Joe has been an enormous support to you &amp; your family.
Are you kidding me. This will be if Biden get elected.
Where’s Hiden Biden
While he has not yet endorsed many of the things listed above to avoid upsetting some moderate voters, Biden has promoted giving statehood to DC and banning most assault weapons, both of which had been confined to Bernie and Warren just six months ago.
Usually the challenger is the one asking for more debates.  Trump knows Biden won’t do a 4th but is just using it for a political hammer.  I think Biden should propose either 6 or 3 debates and watch Trump move in to something else.
That has got to be the most ridiculous statement ever! And creepy Biden for president?? You can not be serious??! He can’t even form a complete sentence, hows he going to run an entire nation???!!!
I have thought this from the beginning, they have someone waiting in the background. It will not be Biden.
Need to get her on record that she deny Biden propose Logan act to go after Flynn
Purely political. Biden wins and we will be back to normal
I cringe every time Biden speaks.
What did Biden do ? Did he proposed the Logan act to go after Flin?
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : Biden scraps plans to travel to Milwaukee for nomination acceptance, citing coronavirus concerns
Joe Biden is whatever Bernie Sanders tells him to be.
It was painful to watch. Ok, question. Totally off subject. What do you think of Biden not providing more interviews? I think it’s smart, especially when this dude can drive a news cycle with his incompetence.
Reminder that when Libs get Biden they will actively be working against any systemic change, in essence becoming mask off enemies to real progress, keep that in mind
Hey bro, Republican and Democrats are Persons their both a party. You may like trump but not the republicans. You may like democrats but not Biden.
President Biden should pardon Donald Trump, this way he is reduced to a memory, a distant reminder of when we hated, when we were scared, when we lacked hope and were sick.  When we were divided and were fearful, no more, now hopeful and now turning a new corner, together.
President Biden’s first course of action:  pardon Donald J Trump.   This way we can move on, relinquishing him and his awful being, his lies, his divisiveness to the footnotes of a bad memory, a miserable experience, hopefully to never be repeated.
President Biden’s first action should be to pardon Donald Trump.  This will allow our country to move on, forgetting him and his reign of incompetence and division.
President Biden’s first action should be to grant immunity to Donald Trump.  This will allow country to heal, move on and forget him and his reign of incompetence, division and terror.
gap in feelings toward Biden. Only 57 percent of black registered voters ages 18 to 29 say they have a favorable opinion of Biden. By contrast, 88 percent of black seniors say they view the former vice president favorably, including 72 percent who have a very favorable perception
I think the day after Biden wins the election we should start our general strike and demand all that we have earned and deserve. 🔥🔥🔥🌹
Chris Wallace is the worst. He is a democrat not a Republican. He asked harder questions to Trump that these 2 idiots running for VP with Biden
After Biden is sworn in he will go to the podium and announce he is stepping down and from the tunnel Hillary will take the stage

The Biden health care plan is nonsense! Middle class would pay that bill’ trust Me!!!
Biden's even ahead in Texas.
You’re nuts if you even remotely think that Biden could run this country....that’s a joke within itself!!!
But Biden has said almost nothing, as he didn't have to. Trump has been shooting himself in the foot.
Biden wants to raise taxes to 7 trillion$$$$$  How much more do YOU want to pay???
. something something Hunter Biden?
Biden just listened to a woman and a Black man, his best friend. This was amazing.
Weekend At Biden's!
Then who is she gonna vote for? Howie Hawkins? ‘Cause she definitely isn’t gonna vote for either Trump or Biden
Biden is a moderate, anf one that wasn't asleep at the wheel when COVID-19 arrived.
Laughing at the truth doesn't make it go away. Aggressive lies don't change reality. Biden is up in ALL polls, often by 15 points.
He knows Biden is taking the suburban Republican "Romney" vote.
The real polls show Biden up by vastly more than Hilary at this point.
That's why I'm voting for Biden.
Every VP has dreams of being President. Hell, Kamala just ran for POTUS! However, she would never undercut Biden once selected as VP.
Biden's going to stop Marxism with a little stutter and a calm demeanorExcept the conspiracy theory that you all expect the Durham report to color doesn’t make sense on its face. The obama admin spies on Trump’s campaign only to release none of the info before the election all the while re-opening the one into HRC? And Obama, Biden and Rice knew?
I know that the entire investigation is a political sham and that it will turn up the same obama-Biden killshot that all the other ones have: none.
Leo Terrell: Joe Biden is a racist but gets a free pass because he's a Democrat...never a truer word spoken Leo!  #walkaway
Kanye here to hurt Joe Biden and People of Color who vote for him.  What is wrong with this dude?
This absurd list of "reasons" Rice is the pick makes me more confident that it's Harris. 1) Biden also knows Harris well. 2) For VP, Senate experience matters far more than White House experience. 3) That debate moment was political theater. 4) A misdirect right now makes sense.
The DNC is truly a group of idiots.  1st Hillary, and now Biden?  Hillary being one of the most unlikeable people on the planet and Biden clearly showing Mental Illness.  I don't get it.
Ya, Trump’s tweet was allll about Kanye, hoping he’ll take votes away from Biden and split the ticket. Which isn’t racist at all, LOL. Doesn’t Kaye know he’s being used?
SE, if you don’t vote for Biden because of his VP pick after alllll the BS that Trump has done to this country, then you are voting for Trump. Period.  Suck it up and do the right thing. Unbelievable...
What Biden said was IGNORANT, but I’ve seen way too many bad takes. If you are willing to vote for Trump because of what Biden just said, then wait to I show you Trump has been doing for the past three decades 👀
1973- the year Joe Biden came to Washington.  47 years with zero accomplishments.   Who in their right mind would vote for a 78 year old who has been in politics for that long??  Not to mention his cognitive decline...
There is no amount of mental gymnastics the Biden campaign can do to explain away this racism. Wow.
I love the show, but your teaser talking about Biden gaffe and not adding Trump with his crazy remarks in OH was inappropriate.
Interesting that Cupp would vote for Biden with Harris but not with Rice. I wonder how many other anti-Trump Republicans agree.  Of course, it's foolish. If you're a Never Trump conservative, it must be because you recognize the existential threat he poses. Vote Biden either way.
I still maintain he didn't actually particularly want to be President and ran as an emergency Biden understudy.
Biden 49 Trump 49
Hypothetical: Rob Portman retires in 2022. President Joe Biden has a national approval rating of around 48 approve/50 disapprove. Republicans decide to nominate Jim Jordan for Senate and Democrats nominate Tim Ryan. Who wins the Senate election?
Thoughts about Biden: 1) I think he'll be a great president. 2) I'm confident he'll surround himself with highly qualified, capable people. 3) I wish he'd think a bit more before he speaks sometimes. 4) He definitely needs a Black woman as his running mate.
Apparently when Joe Biden becomes president a Bill of Rights amendment will be invalidated "immediately and without notice".  This nonsense could be refuted by any D student in a high school civics class.  All Republicans have is scare tactics. Unfortunately, they work.
No democrat is going to take away guns so stop lying to everyone.  And Biden is NOT going to take any guns
They were worried about Trump and the Nuclear Football.   Come on, man' you can't give the Football to Biden.  He might start the apocalypse!
The chryon says you’re talking about the economy, but all I hear is talk of how Biden is against God. Really? Against God? Ohhhkay, then. And I’m against Xenu.
God must not be as all powerful as all of the Bible verses say he is.  Or else Biden is really that damn powerful.  Either way, why would ANYONE listen to Donald f’ing Trump about anything that has to do with Christianity?  He’s the most morally bankrupt man to ever hold office.
💥💥 Moving on the Ukraine corruption quickly...Biden &amp; Hunter won’t be sleeping well 💥 💥
BULLSHIT. Don't listen to this crap.  VOTE BIDEN!
Hold up Biden is Lord Asriel???
All Biden had to do was drop out and admit he doesn’t give a shit about anything besides getting trump out of office.
Joe Biden with the Nuclear Football.    Bidens finger on the the button! I am truly afraid!!!   He could start a Nuclear War while looking for his tapioca pudding.
All I have to say is  and  were right on the mark
The debates with Biden are going to be painful to watch. The gaffes/minute will leave us all with heads in our hands.
Is it wrong of me if I say that Biden should talk less and smile more?
Biden is "against God", says the guy who is all in with Satan.
That is pathetic. Biden/Dead Horse would get my vote, 110%.
The over-70 crowd in my neighborhood is all in on Biden. Shirts, hats and bumper stickers everywhere.
Biden will lose for the following reasons:  1) Limited passion for Joe by his base.  Opposite on the Trump side 2) Civil unrest works against Biden and not for him given the Dem views on policing 3) The Debates: Trump should dominate 4) The cognitive issue  5) AA% inc for Trump
My favorite Trump campaign attack against Biden is still the one that said "we can't risk electing the oldest president ever elected" even though if Trump won he would also be the oldest president ever elected.   It really encapsulates the overall BS of Trumpism.
Biden, so strong he can hurt God!
Between the “Biden hurts God” and “Latinos are diverse, unlike blacks” riffs today, really makes you wonder if it’s time for faithless electors to do their duty.
Just wondering your thoughts on Biden’s VP pick ...also, tomorrow’s lottery numbers? #ClaireVoyant #psychichotline
Kamala will probably be spending a lot of time in the Senate, whether she is Biden’s pick or not
With every such utterance, he shows how much contempt he has for his constituents, not one of whom believes Biden or anyone else can "hurt God."
Biden rockets to victory after arriving to the debate conscious and standing upright
Relax bro, Biden is actually pretty moderate.
Joe Biden is asking for Chic-fil-A level grace
Twitter &amp; Facebook's action on removing Trump's misinformation about covid shows that they DO have the capacity to act swiftly and the appetite for removal.  NOW DO ELECTION MISINFORMATION - per your OWN policies
That’s actually the least of the things about Biden that bother me.
Shirtless Biden Washes Trans Am In White House Driveway
We already know the pre-determined results: aimed at Comey, McCabe, Strozk, Page, Orh, Brennan, Clapper, Obama, Biden and maybe Yates and Rice.
Trump Team's Dream Pick for Joe Biden's Running Mate: Susan Rice.  👉Trump will pick her apart like a vulture!! 👈
45's campaign will find something like this (or worse) to spin for each and every one of Biden's potential running mates with a misogynistic cherry on top.
Or diverting our attention from something.  Between the Booms and FBI raids, I think it’s all pointing to Biden.  I ha e a feeling they are going to nail him up.
If elected president, Joe Biden said he would not tear down the parts of the barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border built by Trump's administration. But he would end construction.  "There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration."
Another item for President Biden’s to-do list.
Good perspective on the upcoming presidential election.
Chuck Schumer’s boy  endorsed by Brady and Giffords, gun-grabbing organizations who are putting millions behind Biden’s candidacy. BUT, Brady and Giffords took COVID PPP funds at taxpayer expense. Oh I forgot Cal, your company did too #2A #VoteTillis
That... is not logical.
Senator Biden seems a bit shaky.
I'm not sure how much to credit this piece, but they say that the campaign's "case for Rice" is that she'll ensure the enthusiastic support of the Obamas. Like Barack and Michelle are gonna sit on their hands and let Trump win regardless of Biden's running mate. Much less Harris.
We will, by voting for Biden!!
I read this on Newsweek though.  I was just making a joke about it.
Biden Is Right. Pay for Home Health Workers Is Paltry. #ncpol   ttps://khn.org/MTE0MjYwOQ via
Here you go that Biden understands what going on in America (with women) much more than Trump. Biden announced in July platform, if elected a $775B Plan to boost the caregiver economy, support In-Home Care Providers
We’re working on that.  Donate to the Biden campaign, America, and keep organizing to vote Trump out of office.
Spoiler alert: he calls it for Biden! "He Predicted Trump’s Win in 2016. Now He’s Ready to Call 2020." Video with his 13 keys to predict presidential wins/losses. Go, Allan!
Biden is in some deep 💩 💩
The Ukraine has named Biden in their criminal case.  This could be our agents cooperating with their officials.
If Joe Biden won't debate can we watch Trump debate Kanye instead?
Democrat Party HQ doesn’t even have Biden’s name on display 🤣😂
I'm thinking there's a sizable group of dipshit libs and centrists that are only involved in the blm protests to the extent that it's a repudiation of trump. I won't be surprised if they start telling everyone to shut the fuck up after they get the keys to power when Biden wins.
people are still using March’s talking points of “well we’ll all vote Green, that’ll show them!!1!1!1!!!!!” while 92% of non-Twitter Bernie people are already voting Biden.  It’s like...nobody cares.  nobody knows you exist.  this is unhealthy.  organize locally
Well, Biden’s camp won’t have to spend any additional funds generating advertising content after that insane display. #AxiosOnHBO #ResignNowTrump
Actually frankly 20% of the remainder act exactly the same except about "ridin' with biden" and being anti-GMO, so...
I don't have an absolute nope. I'm voting for Biden even if his running mate is a balloon with a face drawn on it in Sharpie.  But of the names being mentioned, Warren is by far the worst pick.
I'll add, in my personal opinion, that I think Biden wants to be seen as more independent of Obama. Choosing an Obama administration official as his highest-profile pick would make it seem like he's not capable of choosing his own people.
reads more like 'any port in a storm' they look like crap, and have nothing substantive to attack Biden with, so they dreamed this up
Biden should definitely not debate. Why bother? He’d spend the whole time refuting the lying freak show that is Trump.
On Zoom with the church's stockbroker (who is very good). He says we can expect an inflationary bull market with significant volatility over the next 12-18 months. Oh, and Wall Street is betting on a win for Biden in the general election.
Secret Service released Hunter Biden’s trips he took with security detail while his daddy was VP...he was busy 🧐
i know March was a lifetime ago but the goldfish memory thing is still annoying. people said the same thing was going to happen with Biden's one-on-one debate with Sanders
Alright, just to be clear a lot of liberals who would never support positions AD holds were tweeting "What does Angela David know that you don't?" When she publicly endorsed Biden. Fine. This has nothing to do with what she thinks about Avakian or Maoism, it is ab the libs.
Just realized that Biden still has to do debates this fall, and suddenly I don't feel he can amass a polling lead large enough to make me comfortable
Meh. Save your money Trump. We are going to #TurnNCBlue. Biden is up in the polls, and will remain there. Say goodbye to #OneTermThom as  takes his senate seat. #ncpol #ncsen #NorthCarolina
Opinion | Biden’s Quietly Radical Care Plan  #caregivers    #dementia
What is up with Ed Rendell?  What a misogynist!  Biden would do well to rid himself of this man and Chris Dodd. They are fossils. Dems equivalence of GOP old white men and a bad look for the party.
Conservatives seem skeptical of another poll showing Biden leading in NC, but several major trends are driving the shift in the state.  #NCPOL
Good to know they exist. But I've started having this discussion with various friends around the country. Everybody has seen lots of Trump signs, but when asked, people struggle to recall seeing any Biden signs or materials.
I don’t understand the strategy behind painting Joe Biden - Joe. Biden. - as some kind of radical leftist. I don’t know if anyone other than the cultiest of the Trump cultists who will buy this. Joe has been a defined national figure for 40 years. This won’t work.
NPR just reported on an Ohio poll that shows Biden up only 46-42. We have the electoral college.
Yeah, funny how Biden supporters don’t stand in large gatherings on roads and highways. Must have something to do with IQ?
Well, at least there are Trump signs around. I live in a very blue part of a swing state, and I've yet to see a single Biden sign, bumper sticker, or any other campaign paraphernalia. We do get slick, substance-free TV ads about how Biden is nicer than Trump.
They already know that Obama knew about the surveillance, who was in that meeting and that Biden was the one that planted the idea of charges for Flynn.  All they are going to corroborate, to have it on record.  Yes, i think she will answer those questions.
Center for Marketing and Opinion Research has Biden +4 in Ohio. (Disclosure: I worked for CMOR as a high school/college student in the summers of 08/09.)
Biden is part of the Washington swamp.  He funneled billions of dollars from China into Rosemont Capital in 2012/14.  Rosemont Capital is owned by Hunter Biden and Christopher Heinz.  Christopher Heinz is John Kerry's stepson.
I'm not as worried as some people are. I think Biden is smart enough to make the right choice.
I said weeks ago. Biden will withdraw. An emergency candidate will be chosen. Guess who.
Hillary is up. Biden is not going to be the nominee.
Weird that Trump is giving such solid reasons to vote for Biden, but I’ll take it.
Oddly enough, Deshanko (Ukraine provided dossier) has to be tied to Soros as well, he worked with the Think Tank.  Which means, Biden is all over this too.  We may not have an election this year!!
Sally Yates goes before the Senate Judiciary Com. 8/5.  Biden appears to be the one that planted the idea of the Logan Act against Flynn.  Igor Deshanko (Ukrainian) worked at Brookings and has strong ties with Fiona Hill.  Mr. VP, you are in trouble...
Donald Trump, did it ever occur to you that a lot of people DON’T have money in the bank? How about if you tell us that Biden’s coming for our yachts?  #TrumpDestroysAmerica
TIL: there exists a “Republicans for Joe Biden”
If Barr or Republican Senators/Reps use the propaganda info they received from Ukraine/Russia to smear Biden, is that a violation of FEC rules.
If Barr or Republican Senators/Reps use the propaganda info they received from Ukraine/Russia to smear Biden, is that a violation of FEC rules.
If this wasn't a staged, wouldn't  the Biden supporters be wearing masks?
On FB I posted the meme of Biden and they declared it false...so I then posted the pic of Warren...it was NOT declared false  🤣😂🤣
I’ll bet you a flat $10.00 that Biden wins North Carolina. He will outperform them because the GOP base has dwindled to uneducated white voters in rural areas.
I don’t think anybody wins North Carolina by 17 points but I do believe Joe Biden would win handily if the election were today. The rapid GOP collapse in the suburbs is one of the more remarkable trends I’ve seen in politics.
The Durham-Barr Origin of Russia investigation has a pre-determined outcome. Barr travelled with Durham to Australia, UK, Ukraine, US states and other places to support the following: that Comey, McCabe, Strozk, Page, Brennan, Clapper, Biden, Obama and maybe Rice and Yates guilty
Yet Trumpers want to make you think it’s the DEMS who are the racists.  I’d bet my house this cat ain’t voting for Biden?  Any takers?
I’m still looking for Biden to swing it. But I expect Biden to win an old school landslide like we haven’t seen in this century. 🤞
Listen, Im going to vote for Biden. But it’s a real “fuck you” to everyone who’s passionate about a younger, more engergized candidate for this to be the primary narrative of the campaign. I’m worried that “trump bad, me good” won’t motivate enough turnout from my generation
If you don't vote for Biden, Trump will win. That's just a fact. #Election2020
This post brings up an excellent point: Zombie Joe Biden would be a MUCH cooler candidate
Exactly. A lot of them don't care if Biden wins. They have their sights set on 2024, and to hell with what happens to our country in the meantime.   But they want to be able to say they supported a Black woman so they can tell themselves they're not engaging in misogynoir.
Maybe the delay is because Biden’s trying to talk Kamala into being his first SCOTUS pick, and she’s weighing her options. 😂  And that’s why Clyburn’s suddenly all “SCOTUS is more important than VP...”  *Yes. I am bored. I do not think any of this is true.
Joe... You had 54 years.  All you did was get rich.  Let's see Hunter Biden's tax records.
Biden is the nominee.  He should choose his VP, not Sanders or Sanders’ adherents.
It doesn't, but it gives them a very distinct advantage, especially in this instance. If Biden has a successful term, it'll be very difficult to defeat his VP. Choosing someone who doesn't want to run would be sacrificing a key advantage in a critical election. Why would he?
We're not fooled by the leftist white supremacists who are naming as acceptable running mates Black women who, even if they were chosen and were able to help Biden win this year's election, wouldn't be likely to run for the presidency in 2024. We see you.
I can't wait until the conventions are over so we can finally be done with the following theories that never made sense to begin with: 1) Biden will be replaced as nominee 2) Biden will choose Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama as running mate 3) Pence will be replaced as VP
I like this shirt because it's a reminder that Harris is proven in the crucial "attack dog" role of the running mate. Most of the other names being mentioned are at best untested.  That role might be more important than ever with Biden leading the ticket.
There are exactly 2 running mate picks Biden could make that would make sense at all: Kamala Harris and Susan Rice.  Of the two, Harris is the better pick for VP.  Rice would be ideal for Secretary of State.  #KamalaHarrisForVP #SusanRiceForSecState  But no matter what happens...
Lots of good lookin’ stuff here!  And will look even better when and if it says Biden/Warren!
I'm not saying it's unprecedented. I'm saying Biden won't do it.
Hey Joe Biden that was a great commercial you did for Muslim Americans.  🙋‍♂️But...ummm....I have a question. Why didn't you ask about Christian views or say your administration will have a "voice" for Christians?  #Pandering #Hypocrisy
The running mate should be a person who helps Biden win. End/

THIS ARTICLE POSTED  BY SHALYS IS A MUST READ BY ALL PATRIOTS AND ALL OTHERS WHO WISH TO PRESERVE THE U.S., OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC, AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION!!!  BIDEN AND THE DEMS WILL WITTINGLY, OR IGNORANTLY UNWITTINGLY ALLOW THE ISLAMIC WAVE TO WASH THEM AWAY!
it feels like the same shit from last year like Biden, there's this recurring obvious theme that it's Harris and no one wants to accept it  like when reporters said Eric Swalwell was running, even though no one knows who that is, even people in his own district
You know what Joe Biden didn’t do?  He didn’t cause the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans theough sheer incompetence.  You can’t work if you’re dead.  He also didn’t preside over the largest contraction in GDP in the history of the country and golf through it all.  #GTFO
There's no perfect alternative but I'd rather not select an untested candidate who has past quotes/actions that may hurt in an important swing state (Florida). If Biden wants to pick a Black female House member who isn't a national name, go with Terri Sewell.
I just want to hurry up and order my Biden/Harris Tshirt.
Someone needs to play the Bruno Gianelli kelp speech for the Biden team.
Joe Biden should want to pick an ambitious VP to potentially set up 12 years of mainstream Democratic leadership in the White House. Any advisor who suggests that he shouldn't should be sacked.
When your claim to fame is that you’re the president’s son’s girlfriend, you’re insignificant. Real moms like Biden. #MomsForBiden
you are an idiot. To compare Trump to Biden?  Really? Voting for anyone other than Biden could re-elect Trump. That’s what happened in 2016. How’s that work out for you? Thanks Jill Stein and Bernie Sanders hold outs. You gave us Trump. Don’t do it again.
I think there’s so much 3D chess going on that Karen Bass being “short-listed” is part of a plan to make her Kamala’s Senate replacement. I mean, she’s a worthy VP candidate for sure, but Biden adding another CA option doesn’t make much sense otherwise.
Is it so hard for Biden to announce that he’d be in favor of a UBI study? That alone would go a long way with progressives... i.e. to vote for him, to fight for him. Upside - they learn, become more receptive; downside - really none, other than the cost of said study.
i’m sure they’ll just have Biden do another Medium post instead.  That’s more their speed
The crime bill talking point is so tired. Anyone that’s actually been following knows that Biden has learned since that racism is much further reaching than he had thought in 1994
I mean, Biden’s not opting for secret police kidnapping random civilians and won’t demonize the press for starters
I can assure you, the majority of Americans will vote for Joe Biden.
Guessing they imagine they’ll get through almost all they want in Biden’s first couple years, then like the ACA, be impossible to really unwind.
Hey  &amp; #SonOfaBunkerBitch  "what about Hunter Biden?"  "Did the Media forget already?"  I guess the biggest GDP drop in history is real news story.  Better start practicing your Prison Skills, daddy ain't going to be President forever #Grifter #VoteBlue
It's your time, President Biden!
If Hillary couldn't beat Trump. Why in the world do people think that Joe Biden will? This is his 3rd time running for president. 😬🤔
i mean yeah he could definitely win, Biden sucks.  looks like right now your boy will use force to remain in power illegally.  you must be so proud
Biden campaign with a new ad up today targeting Ohio with 7 figure ad buy per   #ncsen   via
“All of our scenarios ended in both street-level violence and political impasse,” said Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown law professor and former Defense Department official. "The law is ... almost helpless against a president who’s willing to ignore it.”
I’m looking for over 400.
On tomorrow’s episode of Biden’s picks: I undoubtedly get called a racist, sexist pig for thinking that Kamala is bad because she kept prisoners incarcerated for their value as cheap labor and threatened poor families with arrest over truancy issues.
Joe Biden has literally been running for president for over 30 years. Fine.  But let a woman move toward the presidency and all of a sudden she's "too ambitious".  Make that make sense.
Every time I hear someone like "What about how Harris attacked Biden in that debate? How will they ever get past that?", I have a sudden urge to give that person a Baby Shark coloring book and a box of crayons.
I'm just gonna put this here again.  Joe Biden is not stupid, and he cares about his legacy.
I live in Chapel Hill. When Biden takes over, please don't let America swing "left" too fast or too far. We need moderate bipartisan leadership.Aren't you all still waiting for hillary to die from your 2016 conspiracy theories? Stick with her before starting new conspiracy theories about biden..
Sure uhhh pervert camera worsen....uhh and another thing did you hear about what Biden did when they asked him to take a cognitive test because not a lot of people know this, and I told them, millions of Americans are talking about this but it's like nobody knows it
Oh and stone talking to Wikileaks and russian intelligence to discuss releasing emails..the list is long of the campaign trying to solicit help from russia..now name one time biden has asked Iran or China to help him win his election..
I'm really a tremendous person, probably the most tremendous since at least, when I took the cognitive test, and I took a cognitive test and of course Biden wouldn't do it but I did it and they said this is incredible nobody does this but i did it.
You may be pushing it with Sarah Palin, but I’d be good with any of the rest.
Let biden or his campaign ask any foreign government for help with his elections..the minute Biden says something like, China if you are listening,   we'll be onto him as well..most of the world wants normalcy out of USA..doesn't give them the right to meddle in our elections..
Maybe because Biden doesn’t use Twitter
U.S. Intelligence: China Opposes Trump Reelection; Russia Works Against Biden
Robin Williams' 'rambling' Joe Biden bit resurfaces 11 years later
NOT TRUE. Russia is WAY ahead of China/Iran in their influence of US (and other countries) elections.Everyone knows  Biden isnt WELCOMING help from China/Iran, while Trump has already welcomed Russia's help, even assisting them.
The big difference here is that neither China nor Iran have even a fraction of the influence campaign that Russia have developed: no where near  Biden isnt WELCOMING help from China/Iran.Trump already has and  the Mueller report!
Trump has been very confrontational with Russia for several years now. Why would Russia prefer Biden? China I get. They've already paid the family off. And, Iran would do almost anything to get rid of Trump. This report is pure bullshit.
You do realize that Ivanka Trump got MILLIONS in patents from China when she went on the Presidential visit there last year right, you hypocrite? Hunter Biden didn't work for the Administration........really not the same thing.
At least Joe Biden can clarify his comments!  You, on the other hand, distract and blame others for your failings and blatant bigotry.  #CENTRALPARK5 #FAIRHOUSING  #THEBLACKS
Biden could tell black jokes and the MSM would explain the punchline.
That was put up when Obama and Biden
Counterintelligence chief: Russia aiming to “denigrate” Biden ahead of election
Biden is done.  Wait for the first debate.  Trump will get under his skin and totally get him off the teleprompter.  It will be for great comedy
I need this sign to go with my eventual Biden/? sign.  Drive the Trumpers crazy on my block.
Bet Biden only tried to stop Russia.
Sweetie we settled for Joe Biden.... That should be enough.
If the Biden Justice Department won’t prosecute, he should speak up now so another candidate can be nominated.
Everyone should vote NOW.  Biden has already agreed to the debate schedule and Trump has not. Biden released his tax returns. Do you think Trump will release his tax returns before this debate?  Lots of people are saying Trump and Deutche Bank are under criminal investigation.
Please don’t vote green in 2020. I love their platform but we need every vote we can get to go to Biden so we can prevent Trump from being re-elected. At this point, as much as I hate to say it, it really is the lesser of two evils. #SettleForBiden
and any Democratic idea of a black bailout should never and never have been tolerated.   worth repeating James' words on the day, as predicted, Biden issues an apology. #Biden2020
Sounds kinda like how many people don't like Biden or Trump but they just settle for one of those two anyway.... also terrifying.
"Unlike the #AfricanAmerican community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things,” #JoeBiden #hidenfrombiden #BidenIsARacist #Biden
oh don't get me started on the surveys....I was getting the same ones over and over again from Biden.
Biden: “unlike African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community w/incredibly different attitudes about different things.” Biden=Racist&amp;early onset dementia.
Folks are really out here ripping Biden for this. All the while, Kanye is OPENLY conspiring with the Trump campaign in an attempt to "split the black vote" because they actually believe "black people will vote for the black guy..."
I am so tired of the text and email begging for money.  It's not just the Biden campaign it's everyone running plus the DNC.  I get emails from Nancy Pelosi saying Maria I beg you.......lol JFC I'm ready to delete my email
Joe Biden was absolutely correct. Hispanic and Latino people come from many countries, including the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. A majority of African Americans descend from a few countries on the West Coast of Africa. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.
Maybe not but it could mean that we get someone like Come on Man Biden !! Hey guess what Meg , we can’t go for that , NO!!
The big story here is that Biden can't keep his messaging straight between the image of America his team gets from polls, and the image of America he's supposed to present as a candidate. Imagine if Obama said "as you know, 78% of Latinos support X policy"
Stop it , there is no comparing the two. Trump can get up in front of a crowd and give a two hour speech with no notes. Biden can't even get a sentence out with notes.
Biden supports legalizing abortions for women that want them. Trump bans women fleeing forced abortions from entering the United States.  I understand many Catholics are upset with the former, but why are you ok with the later.
Let me guess, one of the notable exceptions is Barack Obama. The man who Biden describes as “The first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,"
Yes, compared to, say, the Pope Biden isn't very religious.  He's not running against the Pope. He's running against someone who fucked a porn star while his wife was at home with a baby and who brags how he can get away with sexual assault.
At least you're honest. ;-)  The choice is between Trump and Biden. I'll take Biden and see where we are in 4 years instead of Trump continuing to burn down the nation and wipe his arse with the Constitution.
They don't have work very hard for Team Pete.  We made it extremely easy for the Biden campaign from the day Pete dropped out.  That's why it better to expect nothing from them.  The only thing they should expect from me is my vote.
Y’all just want voters to die if it means putting Biden in who is the same as trump lol
I bet you believed Hillary was sick and going to die in 2016..well we have been through all of trump's playbooks..we are not gullible like the Trump University students or helpless like the cancer kids he stole money from..get to biden once you're out of conspiracies on Hillary.
Well, let me embarrassingly admit I'm holding near max NO on Rice and "over-paid" by an average of 8 cents, so if Biden's crew is doing this I know someone high up in the campaign and will submit a reimbursement claim.
Thing is Biden totally could have talked about the diversity of the latinx community, without adding the insulting remark about the black community. C’mon man...
I'm voting Libertarian, because apparently only Libertarians get three votes this year: a vote for Jorgensen, a vote for Trump, AND a vote for Biden all as t once.
Imagine if Biden is president 😲 a lot of LEGAL immigrants who don't speak Spanish would be screwed by thousands of recently arrived economic migrants.
That’s why I hate those people. “Not voting for Biden is voting for Trump.” No it’s not, both are extremely corrupt: Biden is owned by the oligarchs that run this country and Trump is a wannabe fascist dictator. I want no part of it.
Correct. Anyone on the right would’ve had their career destroyed by this.  However, this is a distraction:   Biden is so fuddled that he can’t recognize softball questions from friendlies. His reaction was to get angry and attack.  Imagine him doing this with Xi or Putin.
Too late. #Portland Mayor says continued rioting will help re-elect #Trump in November. Damage is already done...people of all ages and races have seen the destruction and attach it to #Biden and #Democrats lack of concern for public safety. Hard to run away from now

"when such a plan is described in terms of the trade-offs (higher taxes but lower out-of-pocket costs), the public is almost equally split in their support. " This quote from your article is exactly my point and why there is support for Biden's plan and not Bernie's plan..
Biden is honestly further right than trump, Trump is just more authoritarian.

Too bad it might be true. However, Biden would not remember committing the crimes. 😊  #StopTwitterCensorship
The only thing Biden has going for him is that he’s not Trump 💀  Buckle up y’all.
That’s fine. Not at the convention. They get no benefit from it and in fact doing a joint event with Biden after the convention would have more impact. No convention time for someone to launch their 2024 Presidential Campaign.
Kanye West indicates presidential run is designed to spoil Joe Biden's White House chances - Kanye West has been accused of being a "spoiler" candidate. …
AMERICANS SHOULD BOYCOTT KIMYE IF THEY WANT BIDEN TO WIN.  KANYE WOULD DROP OUT IF IT MEANT IT WAS DESTROYING THEIR LIVELIHOOD.
Who voted for Biden? Was he not voted as the nominee defeating Bernie in state after state with his wide support base among suburban populations and overwhelming black support for his record as VP under obama..
You can complain that Biden isn't the most religious person, but compared to Donald Trump...
2016 you wrote someone in and Trump won. You're "100%" against Trump yet are considering a write-in again depending on Biden's VP pick? Nonsense! Liberals respect the Constitution, the rule of law, fiscal responsibility, national security interests, free speech and a free press
Accept that Bernie didn't have popular support and move on..biden won with his suburban base and his popularity with the black communities based on his record as VP under Obama..there's no reason to blame anyone..bernie's message did not resonate with people..i wish it had..
Has Biden said he will take away people's guns? I remember the same thing said about Obama and nobody took anyone's guns
BTW they have all thrown each other under the bus to save Biden and Obama.  But ur right the GOP have zero balls to actually do something about it.
If Biden were to pick #SarahPalin for #VP, would you vote for #Trump??  🤣
He is a racist. He is telling you who he is.....
It's more likely than not Biden picked a VP weeks ago &amp; the timing of an announcement is to maximize its' effect.  This is politics performance art. VP announcements since late 80's are with 1 exception announced 2-3 days prior to convention. Ya think all prez just can't decide?
That and just calling it a hoax. Biden says he will accept nomination in his home state, so Trump comes back and says  He might use the WH. How appropriate. Looking for any advantage even if by association
Earlier this week,   launched his Agenda for the Latino Community. The Latino community is a core part of the American community &amp; our contributions are evident in every part of society. I was delighted to join other NC Leaders &amp; praise Biden's bold agenda. #ncpol
Obama got all the other centrist contenders to drop out and endorse Biden. That's not a conspiracy.
Yo, America can have Biden problems or Trump problems. Your choice. But if that fraudulent pig gets re-elected Biden problems will fit into a teacup compared to the monstrosities Trump has in store “for” America over the next four years.
Truer words probably have never been spoken in the history of American presidential elections: "I am going to beat #JoeBIden!' -- said by none other than Joe Biden! himself. #CNBC
Due to Biden's mental decline, the VP pick is critical. The VP will likely be running the show from early on. That's one reason Dubya kept Cheney around. The other reason was that he and his neocon buddies had him by the balls. I'd hope for better this time.

Love you, Kanye. Maybe he actually dislikes Biden and the Democrats that much that he would do this, to me that warrants some attention and skepticism from the crowd that wants Joe in no matter what. Consider the evidence in front of you.
Are you slow? Biden said all black people are the same.
Wake up AMERICA, you cannot take this man seriously. God help us all if you do. Vote, BIDEN in November.
I don't give two shits if Biden or Trump are religious. This is not an argument I care about. Show me which one believes in science.
Fuck You...!!!...I’m still Ridin with Biden...!!!
they won't after they saw what you did to Trump.  Biden is in worse shape when it's non scripted questions.
Biden's gonna get at least 90% of the Black vote, folks. These "gaffes" don't change anything. Any Dem nominee for President is guaranteed to win at least 90% of the Black vote these days.
I think she was a perfect spokesperson for Bernie. Did you see her on "The Breakfast Club"? I disagree with her about Joe Biden, but ONLY because Trump is killing us by the thousands. ANYONE would be lucky to have her on their team.
Vote Biden and this will be the norm. And you won’t have guns to protect yourself. #Trump2020NowMoreThenEver
Love it. Now if we could get Biden to keep his mouth shut and quit giving Trump ammo...
It’s a virus. Unless he has a magic wand, there’s nothing more our President could have done. Hillary, Obama, or Biden’s actions would’ve been similar, if not identical. You deranged, TDS infected libs are so far gone, you’ve lost all sense of reality.
Bollier is winning 18% of Republicans and has a 45-29 advantage with independents.  Trump leads Biden only 50-43. That would be the largest share of the vote for a Democratic candidate in Kansas since 1976:
Joe Biden, the gif that keeps on giffing
Trump says Biden will "hurt God." If anything hurts God, it's a leader who has allowed 160,000 to die without a shred of compassion. It's children taken from the arms of their parents and put into dog kennels. It's someone trying to take away healthcare in a pandemic.  #JesusWept
Trump attacks faith of Catholic Biden: 'He is against the bible' | The Independent 😂😂😂 there goes the Catholic vote.
I am voting for Joe Biden no matter who he picks for VP. I do think some of the contenders would be AWESOME in other roles like SEC of Treasury  AG  and others, but voting for Joe Biden no matter who his running mate is.
Nobody liked Tim Kaine. At the time, it was widely regarded as a bad and confusing choice. Biden will almost certainly pick a bad VP as well. It is what it is. Democrats are idiots
Ah yes, the primaries, where Biden’s support was clearly driven by his policy stances and not by an elite/media narrative around “electability”
-You, a hater, in 2011: “Christian, why are taking multiple undergrad classes on philosophy of religion? When will those topics ever be relevant?”  -Trump, 2020, probably: “Joe Biden is mailing glitter bombs to God’s house. It’s getting in God’s eyes and it hurts God real bad.”
I guess Biden’s one of those people who think that all blacks look alike.
While this may be correct, I feel quite sure this criticism of Trump is in response to his recent rantings about Biden. You know the old saying - pot calling the kettle black. Biden has made word errors and has stuttered thru speeches, however doesn't dis Trump on his gafs.
Why did Trump make attack ad of Biden praying ???
At a debate, Biden should just lob quotes and verses from the Bible at every chance and challenge Trump to do the same.  The emperor has no clothes.
If Biden looses the election, it will be because of his own big mouth.  What a disaster.
Russian troll farms are actively working to convince progressive Dems not to vote for Biden and some are actually falling for it. HELLO? Did you see what happened in 2016? Getting played once might be excusable, but twice? This would be your OWN damn fault. Don't be dumb! #ncpol
You Ain’t Black didn’t hurt Biden and this won’t either... Taking the side of police over black lives does matter however... When you call black protesters anarchists that matters Trump
Trump picked the wrong subject here. I have met VP Biden many times and worked with his son Beau on a charity project.  He is as decent, kind and sincere as they come. And his faith is an integral part of him. Trump is no match for this man. #Biden2020
Who's the Bully...a reporter challenges Biden about his mental state and Biden accuses him of being on cocaine...anytime Biden gets a tough question which is rare... he bullys the reporter

Biden faces backlash over comparing diversity in Black, Latino communities
Trump was wealthy before he became President. How about Obama and Clinton and Biden and Pelosi and Feinstein. And don’t get me started on Sharpton and Jackson.
The DNC is a spectacle, not a policy conference. She's one of the three most visible and culturally relevant politicians in the country and she's particularly popular among young &amp; left-leaning people, two blocs Biden needs even more in states like WI where the margin is narrow.
True (he’s been at like 1%), but GOP help is cynical &amp; even 1% could alter history if it came mostly out of Biden’s pocket (I don’t think it will).
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?
It’s so adorable to see my republican friends call people idiots for considering a Biden vote because “he can’t even put together a coherent sentence” as if Trump is poet laureate of 2020.
Although you also have Bernie and Warren speaking, which makes me think this is as much about not giving AOC a leg up on some of the other future party leaders as not wanting Biden to be outdone (nearly everyone will “outdo” Biden)
Again...it’s a plan to take away votes from Biden. Don’t fall for it.
Waiting for Joe Biden's VP pick is like waiting for a toddler to put on their shoes. It's like... I can just do it for you, please let me. We have places to be.
The reason theyre banning tiktok is because this guy found out Joe Biden is a clone because his earlobes look different
A political cartel secretly, but in plain sight, undermines our representative government by protecting the political elites’ control of the White House while silencing all others.  But yeah just keep it a Trump-Biden thing. Will anyone do THE story on
Only if you’re black enough, otherwise will put you back in chains. Quoted by Joe Biden, just saying.
Republicans are still trying to frame Joe Biden with Ukraine ⁦
Pelosi, Schumer, Feinstein, Biden. Tell us how they all got rich. Hypocrite. Trump has lost net worth while in office.
Black Americans, if you're even thinking about voting for Kanye West in Nov., remember, he supports the white racists in the White House!! Don't be fooled - Kanye has been bought &amp; he's so-called run for president is too pull votes away from Biden! #DoNotBeFooled #VoteBlue2020
I watched her PBS interview. She sounds just like Biden. Fumble, bumble, stumble......she’s just as bad as he is.
Lol that's exactly what I'm going to do. Not vote for Biden. Good luck in November!
First off I said more than likely. 2nd off, Trump has shown me he’s detrimental to the country. At the very least, Biden is someone new.
Y’all already tried this one early on...Biden is reading the words of someone else. It’s called a quote. But thanks for playing.
Nobody pays attention to the amazing things he does.  DID YOU KNOW???  The average cost of prescription drugs more than doubled during the Obama/Biden administration?  Of course not, that would require the mainstream media = ijoke

Really ? More than “ what have you got to lose ...” to black voters , The man who was sued for discrimination practices  in the 70’s ...the wall guy ...the Mexican are rapists guy ....the Shit hole country guy ? .....nah i’ll stick with Biden ...
There is zero chance that Biden wrote these tweets
Not good
Ah bud...are you okay?? Did Biden hurt you that bad that you’re just saying random stuff now??
Thom .... your guy trump.... talking  about Biden... he will "Hurt God"..."Hurt the Bible ".. hes a "wacko"..  In the worlds of  .. trump is a "Kook"!!  Because you support him.. North Carolina will be voting you out!!  NC needs       ☆Cal Cunningham☆
And how has Biden and his family become wealthy?  Oh yeah, stealing from taxpayers and taking handouts from China.
Donald Trump's greatest accomplishment in office is somehow convincing me to vote for Joe fucking Biden.  Fuck.
I can only assume that Trump believes Biden to be another god.
Less than 0% chance this came from  Biden's keyboard. The man can't complete a coherent thought, and suddenly he's some scholastic warrior? Are people actually buying this?
Can you tell us what Biden has done in the private sector?  How many jobs has he created.
How is Biden going to lead the world from his basement if he wins ??!!
settle for Biden 2020
Eric, great sharing of Robin Williams on Joe Biden!!  Thanks!
I finally figured it out.  The only reason Trump has not been assassinated yet is that God wants him to be alive to see himself get this decimated by Biden in the election.   #GodWorksInMysteriousWays
Robin Williams rant on Joe Biden!
Joe Biden is at his absolute best when he’s in the middle of a sentence, stops, waves his hands, and goes, “I’ve said too much, probably.”
We gotta choose between Donald Trump and Joe Biden 😂😂😂
Also, I think it's more likely that my elderly beagle will chase down the squirrel that sits on the trellis and critters at him than it is that Biden tweets anything. So technically the Twitterer didn't say the other thing.
I’m a Trump supporter!! It’s a very strong case that Biden is a Racist!!
Nope- and these idiot lefties pan Trump for how he pronounces Thailand and Yosemite.... Biden couldn’t find them on the map....
This thread is about Biden's racism.  Do try to stay focused.  If you want to start a thread on Trump, do so, at your leisure (do pronounce the word correctly), elsewhere.

Sir - you are going down.  America can not wait until Biden is President.
Joe Biden is Racist AF. He’s been like that his whole life, he only gets away with it Because he’s a Democrat. I’m sick of it.
The problem is will the Dems and the non-Caucasian community still be enough to vote him into office.  If so, Biden really knew what he was saying.
JFC, do you not watch Pelosi and Biden? Those two buffoons can’t pronounce cat. GTFOH, can you people possibly be more petty??
Biden should insist that Trump debate Kanye first
Just saying universal health care, especially given vulnerabilities exposed by a global pandemic is wildly popular and Biden's continued opposition to it is suicidally stubborn. If he took a stand for something 69% of America and 88% of Democrats want, it would help.
Who are you VOTING FOR silly woman? Biden? The abortionists?
Somebody tell Biden we are only voting for him because he is the better option, Trump is trash.
Never has a liberal won a election and you can vote Biden but you get what you paid for lol

"THEN JOE BIDEN EITHER IS GOD OR CAN HURT GOD, AND I DO NOT CARE IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE"  -  2020
When asked if he could "hurt God" as his opponent alleged, Joe Biden shoved back one sleeve and said, "You're darn skippy. I'd give him the ol' one-two, straight in the pucker, just like on the corner back in my shoeshine days. We didn't take no guff or malarkey, deity or not."
Experts held 'war games' on the Trump vs. Biden election. Their finding? Brace for a mess #SmartNews
Isn’t it great the system produced a Biden for us all?
Cant even listen to that Joe Biden interview through
Biden believes in a woman's right to kill her children...and he's a Marxist ...thats not someone who is with God...but you better wear a mask!
Biden could pick my compost pile &amp; I’d vote for him
Split the ballot...their mindset is to take votes away from Biden if at all possible..he better check his MAGA pose’ as they lookin weak...everything with trump is “the appearance of”..he doesn’t care about succeeding like with Covid he cares about the appearance of succeeding ..
Is there anyone Biden could pick that would make you reconsider? Like I don't even particularly like Biden but he could pick Ted Cruz as his running mate and I'd still be like, "Well, shit, still gotta do this because it's not literally the worst option possible."
I’m not voting for Biden. That’s all I know for now.
The Biden Administration will be arriving in Washington with boats &amp; large nets in  just hold on Donald, the Liberals who actually give a shit about even YOUR life will be there to drain you out of the swamp soon.
Me when I see Joe Biden say ignorant/racist things knowing that I more than likely still have to vote for him:

TO ALL MY FRIENDS OF COLOR: Do NOT allow Kanye West to manipulate you. He has now publicly admitted his supposed "Presidential campaign" is in fact, NOT REAL &amp; that he only did it to pull some, primarily black voters, AWAY FROM BIDEN. Despictable.
Donald Trump just claimed in Ohio that Joe Biden, who is a PRACTICING Catholic, will "hurt the Bible, hurt God" if elected and that he is "against God".
Trump Ad Features Edited, Out-of-Context Biden Photos  via
Trump campaign was caught this week DOCTORING PHOTOS OF BIDEN to make him appear in places he wasnt &amp; doing things he wasnt doing. BUSTED!!! Here is the truth about the three pictures the ads used:
The accountability lies on China’s shoulders, not the US and not this president. He could have ignored it like Biden and Obama did when it was H1N1 and then you’d have a valid point.
What Joe Biden said or Jim Crow Joe said was just nasty... This is not how you get black vote. This how you stop blacks from voting or voting potentially for Trump cause he low-key he really hasn’t done much harm to African American community the Dems the focus on black criminals

She'll kiss the asses of those left-wing loons! K. Harris most likely to be Biden's running mate. Abrams wanted to be. Meryl Streep, the looniest!
You misunderstood, understandably, but you'll get it if you take a minute. He's talking about a "landslide" election in which Biden is flipping states (red-to-blue). Those states are ranked by probability of a win (even if &lt;50%). Big drop in prob after TX. AK next most prob flip.
One of the most annoying parts about this whole Biden will “hurt g-d” speech is that trump shouldn’t even be bringing religion or g-d into this. It has nothing to do with politics at all. We’ve strayed way too far from separation of church and state
Joe Biden has “polices”?  🤷🏾‍♂️
You kind of need to talk publicly to land the gig right? Roll em out and let it all hang out for the world to see. Not that Trump is better, but cmon...you can limit Biden but he can’t not talk publicly.
Biden must be one hellva powerful guy! Lightning ⚡️🔥☄️💫✨
Agreed.  Biden should work Biden's campaign, however he sees fit.  Trump's base is already out to win.  Biden's bigger concern should mobilizing Biden's base.

So trump said that in a fight between Biden and God, Biden would win? Interesting! I might vote for Biden then, if he is stronger than God maybe he can do a lot more good than that baboon in office we have now throwing shit everywhere
If Joe Biden is capable of hurting your god, you don't have much of a god.

“It is what it is” to borrow a phrase about why Biden will win
If Biden can hurt God, I don't think there's much we can do to stop him, anyway.
Joe Biden’s comments are a disgrace!  Imagine the outrage if Donald Trump said that (and rightfully so).  Where’s the outrage from Democrats and the mainstream media?  I’m not an ‘R’, ‘D’, or for either candidate, but I do want an equal standard for all!  Why does he get a pass?
Boy are you reaching. Biden supporters know he makes gaffes. It’s baked in already. Kind of like Trump supporters knowing he’s a racist, actually sued as such by the UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT for racial housing discrimination and calling Mexicans rapists still on the Trump train
Nooo..Biden doesn’t own guns lol
Don't get the Republican desire to get Biden on the debate stage. It's not like Trump is a great debater or doesn't have a habit of saying controversial things.
imagine joe biden being like "i am anti energy, fuck energy, who needs it!"
Biden just gonna show his dick in the next video. We’ve seen him sprint. We’ve seen him peel out. Now show us that sack, Joey!

Joe Biden’s gonna suplex God, y’all. Ya heard it here first.

Biden attends church more than Trump, unless Trump needs a photo-op.
Biden has probably spent more time attending church in a single year than Trump has in his life.    Though I would concede that Trump has spent more time standing on church steps holding a Bible upside down than Biden ever has.  So maybe they are equal in the eyes of God. 🙄
Another racist Biden comment, I wonder why the mainstream media is so silent on it?

It’s just so bizarre to me that the onion spent the entire Obama administration building up a fake frat boy Biden persona, and now seeing that video in my timeline just gives me very specific and uncomfortable vibes. 😬
If you don’t vote for Biden, you’re voting for Trump, sweetie
I can only assume that Biden car video is him endorsing The Onion as his speech writers/election strategists.
It's a considerable stretch from "Joe Biden will be a puppet controlled entirely by AOC" to "Joe Biden is powerful enough to physically harm the Lord."
"Yeah, I was going to vote for Biden because Trump is a narcissistic insane person who is wholly unfit to govern, but then I found out he was going to nominate Val Demings as VP and I'm just not so sure anymore..."
Even then, at least the Trump would be VP instead of President. I would still vote for Biden, but also be his personal bodyguard and ensure he survives the term so the VP can't take over. 😂
This reminds me of that Wonder Showzen bit where the kids meet god and eat him. Now I'm laughing picturing Joe Biden with bbq sauce all over his face with that stupid grin
Joe Biden needs to start punting on first down. Just say nothing man. No more Interviews.
He's set the bar so low for Biden that during the debates Biden just has to show up. If I was advising Trump I'd tell him to drop the cognitive decline attacks. It just calls attention to his tenuous grasp of things.
I think we can explore the differences. The goal of exploring those differences should be to find common ground though. We already agree fuck Biden. So let's use it as a starting point to bring together African Americans and latines who agree with that
Idk where these people get off with their "Trump is the worst president ever but if Biden doesn't satisfy my very arbitrary desires I guess it's a wash" bullshit.
Clinton was out reminding people why they hate her for months by this time. Biden's hidin'. That's not going to help his numbers.    1st week of 11/16 you were saying Hispanic support for Clinton was up. Trump outperformed  McCain and has higher support with minorities NOW.
Joe Biden wants to hurt God?  How is it possible Trump has one single supporter. HOW!!!!
You're either voting for Biden and change or you're FOS. Please stop with all the clickbait.
"Less homogeneous" is very different from "not homogeneous" which is basically what Biden said. Why try and defend that statement?
In the primaries there was a huge split with older African Americans supporting Biden and young African Americans supporting Bernie. Latin Americans supported Bernie regardless of age. Are you going to use that to say we're all the same?
Anyone claiming they still might vote for Trump unless Biden VP picks suits them...is a Trump voter.
Why can't you people grasp that there are very many of us who absolutely don't want Trump as POTUS *and* absolutely don't want Biden as POTUS?
I don't want Trump to be POTUS.  I don't want Biden to be POTUS.  Therefore, I will not vote for either of them.  This is not a difficult concept to comprehend.
If you’re voting for Joe Biden you might actually be a racist 👀 Unlike the Trump supporters you tried to peg that on in 2016
Biden is going to take all your rights away but Trump can't even get Hillary locked up. 😂
That finally explains whisper campaigns around Harris's veep campaign, multiple sources claiming she won't "get in the eva" to Biden's liking.
Like there are truly so many valid things to criticise Biden for, including his mental stamina, but Trump is so obviously far more unstable why even bother calling attention to mental fitness? Proposal: No one over 70 eligible for the office of POTUS.
Wow, Biden is going to repeal a constitutional amendment on his first day in office. That's impressive.
I know who &amp; what Trump and Biden are. If you don't at this point you won't be capable of evaluating a debate. I think Biden will mop the floor w/ Trump, but even if Biden comes out &amp; curls up in a fetal ball on stage I'll vote for him. Trump is a plague upon us, literally.
It is mind boggling that the right can't come up with any better criticism of Biden than to say he is mentally unfit and "against God" when Trump, who has trouble reading and can't say anything remotely informed about Christianity or the Bible, is their man...
Where’s the lie? Biden is talking about a true but unfortunate reality. BA’s are much more monolithic in voting habits than the Latinx community.
I don't think God's got much to fear from J.Biden, tbh.
You’re reaching.  BA’s are the most loyal democratic voting bloc without fail. We are not monolithic when it comes to political views and values but we are when it comes to voting. Biden is correct on this one.
You and I obviously have different memories of Obama/Biden. They faced 2 pandemics and a severe recession and left the country in better shape than they got it in. I voted for McCain and Romney but thinking Biden is the end of America is just ridiculous
“He’s against God, he’s against guns” Trump says of Biden.   In an attack ad earlier this week, Trump’s campaign used a photo of Biden praying.

That much everyone seems to agree on. Trump is definitely down from 2016 but nothing shows Biden leading. I know Democrats are polling the general election for the House race. I simply don't buy that Republicans aren't. It doesn't make sense.
My source further elaborates that he has not seen anything from Republicans showing a Biden lead. Possible this is an unweighted poll though (before they weight it to match the electorate). Outside groups have done polling here and they match campaign. Trump down from 16.

As people age, they lose inhibition and speak their thoughts rather bluntly. These racist thoughts are flowing out of Biden due to age-related cognitive decline.
Biden, Pelosi and the rest of them have absolutely no problem saying that “voter ID requirements suppresses the Black vote” They have absolutely no clue how racist and condescending that is. How anyone of any race could vote such vile people is beyond my understanding.
I don’t like playing the deflection game, and I do think. Biden was extremely out of pocket, I’m just saying let’s not use this opportunity to magically forget how much worse the other guy has been.
Mr. Biden the VPOTUS Poo.
Fascinating to see so many people on Twitter try to call Biden racist for his comments about black people (which I’m not saying weren’t messed up) when Trump has said much worse things like 10,000 times over the last four years. Fascinating.
It’s very simple. Joe Biden expects to get 99% of the Black vote and about 75% of the Latino vote.

No, the guy is a hardcore far-left communist like Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, Biden, Bernie, AOC, etc. They all want to hold the country, our economy, and political discourse hostage until the election because they have no other option to hide Joe Biden's horrific record.
He says we don't need a Biden program that includes a jobs program. Also likes the tax cuts Trump has provided.   He talks in a reasonable tone, but his views are just as tone-deaf as Trumps. In other words, he likes the boat loads of money Trump has provided for people like him.

Yes the hussein obama-biden-rice-hillary Administration was the most corrupt in history while biden and son hunter getting (RICH) !! They are laughing at AMERICANS all the way to the bank 🏦, while they’re kicked back in their MANSIONS!! Liberals love ❤️ AMERICA for MONEY 💰!SAD!
President Joe Biden.
Yes she really thinks she’s smart saying she was a little angel 😇 that they took advantage of? LOL 😆!!! She should go to jail like the rest of her pals in the COUP PROtECT that backfired on hussein obama , biden , hillary-ADMINISTRATION!!! SAD it took so long ! 3 &amp; half years!!
Anyone else getting a Weekend at Bernie’s vibe with Biden as the president?
Neoliberal politicians excel at reading the room and taking captive the energy and convenience of whatever movement they find.   Apparently, Joe Biden can't even do that????
Joe Biden's mental ability is a campaign issue that can't be ignored: Devine  via
Nothing you or Biden could say that will change my  mind
Trump used this photo of Joe Biden praying in church in an attack ad.... Trump attacks prayer
With 88 days to go until Trump's reelection, Biden's handlers have still not been able to select a running mate for him.   They have, however picked a campaign theme song: "Nowhere Man" by the Beatles.
The Biden campaign announced today that the former V.P. won't be travelling to Milwaukee for the Democratic convention, presumably to reassure foreign donors that there will not be any live mic moments or creepy sniffing of his as yet unnanounced running mate at the convention.
You know as well as I know. If Biden wins it’s not going to be ncbof the boogie man of the far left
Joe Biden or  should make an ad about Trump's 2016 broken promises. Here he is promising 4+% GDP growth (never got above 3%) and that with Hillary we'd have less than zero (which we now have with Trump).
So many lies to unpack in your comment..Biden is not a progressive nor crowd funded..BLM donations don't go to Biden..we have never seen a more corrupt admin in our history in trump..those are the facts..
Biden has been wrong about every major foreign policy issue for the past 40 years.  Bob Gates the former Sec Def said this not too long ago also.  He opposed Reagan in cold war, he opposed 1st Iraq war, supported the 2nd, opposed killing Bin Laden...just to name a few.
Biden won't go to Milwaukee for DNC acceptance speech: Sources
You should know all about impotence..I mean incompetence. Birds of a feather.  I bet you and Biden would get along great in rambling babbling convo.
Fauci he is playing politics. Anything to make trump look bad. Tell that to the ppl of Brazil &amp;India.We just have way more tests. Fauci getting paid by Obama/Biden and probably China. He changes his mind every week. If Obama was still prez the media coverage would b way different
Wrong. Health issues go to the states largely. Trump did all he possibly could. Biden said 150 million ppl died haha. Blind hatred without knowing the facts makes you stupid. Trump paid for ppls treatment who didn't have insurance for free. But you wouldn't know that watching cnn
We should have debates like we have always had in this country..this request by trump campaign is just because they know they are losing and the debate committee will probably not fall of this..and if they do, I think Biden will show up for the extra debates as well..
Why does Biden think he can make low paid people go to work at grocery stores, Home Depot, WalMart, liquor stores and such, yet it is too dangerous for him to appear at the convention? The other dim delegates and convention attendees must go and conduct business and Biden hides
Don't you love Sally Yates?  Biden should make her his AG.
new claim w/ a good chance of being true: GOP is successfully getting Kanye on ballots in whatever states are left in order to siphon votes from Biden. A 2020 Jill Stein-esque type of deal but way less prepared and  more cynical. *hitting restart button now*
My concern would be for younger voters, regardless of race. Might vote for Kanye as a joke when they would have voted for Biden out of hatred for Trump. I’m just speculating though. I hope young voters would be serious about 2020 elections though. 🤞🏻
I’ve noticed that something is happening to Biden. I think it’s more of a mental and physical exhaustion from the campaign. At least that’s what I hope is happening.
It’s truly disgusting. Why not retire &amp; spend the rest of their days being cozy?? &amp; I can’t believe we don’t have a nonpartisan something in place 2 make sure candidates are mentally healthy. Trump, Kanye and Biden may all be mentally compromised. We know they’re not totally well
President Joe Biden
I see what you did there. Can President Biden name his Cabinet now? It will lower the Nation’s blood pressure.
And the first Black Woman to get the job on top of that? This is the same woman who said it’s time to “let the Anita Hill thing go.” But Kamala is supposed to apologize for DEBATING Biden? It’s all fishy to me. Jill doesn’t want 2 take a backseat 2 a black woman.
What I’ve been thinking the entire time. Joe Biden never should have run, I’m willing to bet she was all for it. She wants the same amount of attention as Michelle, not possible. And no chance if it’s Harris, no matter what project she takes on. VP has never been more important.
"Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report"
A reporter that is assigned to Joe Biden says that isn't true.  There's still more being considered.
Biden not going to convention? Can’t he social distance on a stage!    I’ll bet his acceptance is taped.  Oh brother. #COVID19  excuses.
Thanks to you, I’m aware that Republicans trying to get Kanye on the ballot to take votes from Biden is nowhere close to the dirtiest trick ever pulled in a presidential race. Still... ewwww!
The anti Biden ads from Trump are about the dumbest videos I've ever seen. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

Biden responds to a BLACK reporter on live TV in past 24 hours “Come on, man. That’s like saying to you, ‘Before you got on this program, did you take a test where you’re taking cocaine or not?’ What do you think, huh? Are you a junkie?” WHO IS THE BIGOT &amp; RACIST
Wrong target, pal. You should be questioning this to DNC and China collusion to spread this virus worldwide. Don't blame Trump - it was Biden who acused him os xenophobia because Trump wanted to ban travel to the country, Pelosi was partying in China town and also accusing Trump.
I want to nominate my boss’s dog Pepper for President for the following reasons: 1) He's way smarter than Donald Trump  2) He sniffs people less than Joe Biden

Professor with history of correctly predicting elections forecasts that Biden will defeat Trump
Repub losers are trying to get Kanye West on several states' ballots, hoping he'll be able to siphon votes from Vice President Joe Biden, thereby giving trump an edge...and a "win." But poetic justice may prevail here. Maybe folks will trade their trump vote for Kanye, instead!😡
Unscathed, maybe. But definitely rattled. Nice to see someone finally able to make him that jumpy and nervous. And yes, no way Biden puts even one sentence together in that interview.
Is she using Biden as a model?
Joe Biden's VP announcement. It's Tish.
As she said, people were dumb enough to vote for Reagan and W twice. Hopefully America votes for Biden instead. 👍🏻
Black folks who might vote for Kanye were Not going to vote for Biden anyway.  If anything, it might pull those few black voters away from trump.
There a lot of good reasons to question Trump’s mental acuity. There are no good reasons for Biden not to take this extremely simple test before he is potentially elected President.
This is so true !  Black folks who might vote for Kanye were Not going to vote for Biden anyway !
It's really sad and pathetic that the Bernie Bros are still attacking Biden and spewing Russian talking talking points to help Trump.
Joe Biden won't go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
So you still think NOTHING will change when Biden is president? This was the subject of the comment. Life will, in fact, change for the kids in cages and people dying from the Trump plague.
As a supposed man of faith why would you use a picture of Biden praying in attack ad???
Absolutely! Steve! At the Age of 70 those Late Night Presidential Debates! Biden will walk of the STAGE! PISSED and Confused!

He wants to strip votes from Biden.
#HidinBiden is too much of a liability. The Dems calling the shots won’t take the chance of Biden being in a debate. Did you see Biden’s response to the black journalist this morning?
#HidinBiden is out of control. He blasted back on a black journalist this morning and made what seemed like a racist comment, asking if the journalist was a crack addict. The Dems can’t keep making excuses for him, and not all of his questioners will be Biden supporters
saw it...you were wonderful.  Saw the Yates testimony. She should be Biden's AG
Wait if your going to prosecute the FBI agents what about Obama and Biden and the higher ups???
Why isn't Joe Biden being criticized for his white privilege?
Clearly, you don't Know the Truth or you Reject the Truth for your Own reasons.  Prove it or STFU.  Biden Gang would NOT have stopped Travel to and from there for a month later if that. Truth requires FACTS, which you don't have.
As long as Donald Trump loses and Biden wins, I don’t care how it is predicted. I just hope he’s correct and you Rachel. I admire you very much!
I’m not convinced that Biden will be the nominee. Biden is obviously not calling the shots, who is?  I think whoever is calling the shots will replace him at the convention
Biden will not be debating Trump
..i watched those Senate confirmation ceremonies that Biden presided over , he unquestionably had some sort of problem inappropriately putting his hands on women and children , he systematically molested every incoming Senator's family one after another .Right in front of them
Thanks Diane I hadn't thought of voting for Biden!
Candidate Joe Biden is clear evidence of a broken political system .

Real GenX vibes.   I hung out with Motorhead, so now I’m a Biden supporter type analysis.
Don’t even. Biden was the first elected official to publicly support gay marriage.

Jill is new voice of Biden. No hint of cognitive decline when she speaks!
It wasn't Trump who told Hunter's adventures in Burisma - it was his own father, who bragged to have told the foreign President to fire the prosecutor who was investigating the Biden family corruption acts in Ukraine. Who lies, lies, lies is Biden/Obama/Killary and the media.
A source tells me this is Indiana's 5th District and there are suburban seats with similar swings towards Biden.
You are aware that HRC was the previous administration's attempt to stay in power? So let's turn the tables if it didn't work in 2016, why would it work now? Biden and his boss got us, Trump... Let's not eat the same shitty process.
I've been saying this all along Unfortunately we have to wait six months for Biden to lead us out of the morass or accept another four years under the current administration

They want more debates because they think Biden has more to lose from debating. If Biden went out there in Debate 2 and made what they thought was a world-ending gaffe, they'd probably cancel the last two.

Most likely nothing to gain for Biden. Trump already has too much free press.
Is Biden a racist? Idk, according to his past record in congress, you could make that conclusion. However, I think he used drug test and cocaine b/c he’s most familiar w/those types if tests &amp; is suffering from dementia.
No, that is not true.   Biden can’t complete a thought; he’s a known racist; he is really creepy; he hasn’t done anything in 47 years; and he’ll be a puppet for the “squad.”  Anything is better than that.
He won’t travel to any in-person debate.  They will push for a split screen virtual debate so Biden can stay in his basement and his people off-camera will tell him what to say. Don’t want to risk him being on stage alone with no one to help him complete a thought...
Trump's campaign knocks on a million doors a week. Biden's knocks on zero.
Amen anyone with half a brain has to know that Joe Biden is just a puppet!
Mrs Biden should be ashamed allowing this.  This is when family steps in.  Clearly his mind is impaired.
And I doubt Biden will debate Trump in person alone. He has agreed to three debates—but what format will it take? Trump and Biden on split screen with Biden in his basement where his people off camera can tell him what to say? That’s my guess.
Top story:  'BIDEN: "No, I haven't taken a test. Why the hell would I take a test? C'mon man. That's like saying you, before you got in this program, if you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not, …  see more

Seriously! Your boyfriend opted out of the NFL season for safety purposes and you are criticizing Biden. Hypocrite
I grew up in a Rep home also. Started changing in college then became solidly Dem as I started my teaching career. I clash with my Rep dad a lot (mom leans D now), but I’m glad he at least hates Trump. I was shocked when he voted Hillary bc he hates her. He’ll vote Biden this yr.
Why is he having his daily briefings they're just his daily rallies Biden needs equal time
I think it speaks volumes that they know the party can't broaden its appeal with Black voters and is therefore just focused on taking votes away from Biden.

if Biden wants to bring America together and have a guaranteed win he names  as VP
We already know Biden can 👄🦣🍆. You don't have to admonish us further... Those who would cave to him knowing his history, are just people who don't know his history.
Yes, I would. I have no affinity for Clinton and good policy is good policy no matter where it comes from. I've never voted for a Democrat for president, always voted R until 2016 when I voted for Johnson. I will vote Biden this year because Trump has led us into disaster.
Republican criminality means we are always far behind.  Voter suppression, gerrymandering, pushback against mail-in voting, the elimination of polling sites, and Russian cyber-tampering—all remove any possibility of a level playing field.
Lol, yep  I also bet Jonathan Swan wouldn't have the same facial expressions when interviewing Biden.🤣

“Cultists” is a bid of an egregious statement. I’d pick Biden over Trump for the pure fact that, ofc yeah he’s not the one I would’ve picked for Democrats but at most he’s a figure head that will end up letting a democracy actually live up to its definition; beats an insane child
This not to siphon from Biden but is a way for foreign actors to move vote just like they did with Stein. Johnson was a non zero sum gain.  They moved HRC votes to Stein in just the right numbers because they had the totals.  Last minute moves with 67,000 votes won the day.
Aren't we a critical one? Nearly 20 yrs ago, Biden eulogized Strom Thurmond, a staunch bigot. You bagged on Beto &amp; pled he's tone-deaf when he called Netanyahu a racist- though the US doesn't negotiate with terrorists. Re-evaluate. Who gave U the deed to the corner on criticism?
Politically Trump can attack Biden on lots of things, but after that interview cognitive decline shouldn’t be one of them. It’s like me saying a guy has a big head; it could be true, but I’m not the one to make that point.

I’m sure the replies are full of ‘but they were wrong in 2016’. Remember, he was up against Hillary, who was despised by anyone that didn’t support her. Biden doesn’t carry the baggage that the Clinton name does.
If Biden won’t debate he should become known as “Chicken Little”.             If Biden wins the election, he will become a puppet.  He claims to be moderate.  The reality is that he is already a puppet to the far left Dems.

As usual he had to clean up after a failure Republican. Biden’s gonna have to do the same because American conservatives are some of the worst people on earth. And the past four years have revealed them as the degenerates that they are
I have this thought which makes me smile. Biden has the US rejoin the Human Right's Council of the UN and they go after him for Human Right's violations. He needs to be held accountable.

I wouldn't be surprised if Trump takes issue with something about the debates, refuses to debate, and blames it on Biden.
Not hardly. Putin knows damn well he can't trample on America while Trump is president. Biden on the other hand would be a weak puppet to Putin, and he knows it.
Democrats won’t even vote for biden because all the CON GAMES, one sided fake impeachment, FBI , Obama’s eara COUP, to be fair most of them caught and will probably go to PRISON!! Durham report soon, the LIARS 🤥 and the COUP will have to answer for this AMERICAN embarrassment!!!
Yes I know!! AOC and three STOOGES are the worst SOCIALIST and LIARS 🤥 any AMERICAN has ever seen, babies drinking out of toilets?? They can do better than that , at a photo shoot!! LOL 😆!! Illegals in cages?? Finding out it was hussein obama , biden , hillary administrationSAD
Bret: "The moment we read the tweet, “Just ‘congratulated’ ‘president-elect’ Joe Biden (total loser). You’ll miss me VERY SOON!!!” is the moment our long national nightmare will finally be over."
I love how he tries to project his own decline onto Biden too. Sure, Biden's had some gaffes, but yeesh, 45 is textbook dementia. Reading aloud isn't that hard.
And he tries to say Biden with is occasional gaffe is losing it? Jeeez.
Biden leads Trump, Kelly tops McSally in Arizona: poll
But you see Biden will take us back to the days where America was better at clandestine efforts to destabilize South American governments. See it'll all be fixed and better and good and not like now when it's bad and we just look like dorks...
Before election. I will go with September 29th. They will try too indict Biden.
Joe Biden, Jr, is that truth or fact??
For voters who decide to vote-by-mail, this election isn’t in 3 months -- it starts in 30 days:
Bret: Trump laying groundwork for...a mythology to explain defeat...&amp; keep Trump family relevant in the GOP. ..that he’d pull a stunt like this...it’s so important that he lose in a landslide. Gail: Get your act together, GA. And I’m looking at you, AZ.
I agree, and this is why I think Biden's strategy of not agreeing to more debates is correct. As my late father used to say, don't get into a pissing match with a skunk
Again.: I am not disagreeing. Biden has a proven record of racism, he is against gay marriage (or was, now he says differently). I am hoping that people pay attention during primaries and we don’t have to have these convos.
Plot twist! Biden picks Alyssa Milano for VP!😮 Dear lord, could you imagine? I mean it is a 2020 afterall.😐
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Biden's incoherent???  Please, please, please go watch trumps videos.  Please!!!!!
Trump definitely extreme. Biden ...moderate. I worry less about socialism with Biden. Worry more about a confederency with Trump!😁😉
Bernie is ignoring our massive suffering &amp; urgent needs to prop up his creepy senile pal, Joe Biden, the monstrous architect of mass incarceration &amp; Patriot Act
Please tell me more about how Biden can't speak..... I bet Ulyssesius S Grant loved the Yo-semite geysers....
Is Biden going to be any better? Almost certainly. The people around him are going to be far better, smarter people who believe in the role of government. Is Biden some political genius? No. But the people who fill his cabinet will be. Unlike today.
Why? Biden clearly is the one for the job. We need a leader who cares, can handle a crisis, and believes in science. Your guy is a moron.
Joe Biden is forgetting how to even tie his shoes.
I want to make myself clear, I think Trump is a pompous ass. I just do not think that Joe Biden is any better or different.
Absolutely not. But I have also seen examples of where Biden did the same. At the end of the day I think we need to get rid of both parties and start over
By policy I mean platform. I do not agree with a lot. But I don’t see anything in Biden’s economics that sound practical.
Seeing a lot of reporters who should know better, opining something is wrong with Biden's search for a VP.  Since 1960, virtually every VP was picked within 1 week of the party convention, or at the convention. But convention picks are outdated. Last times? Dems in 84/GOP in 88
Yep. Even the video of Biden putting on a Phillies hat broke my brain a little with how much red hats have become an at-a-glance identifier of people to avoid.
Go back to mommy #HelterStelter LowIQ loser. CNN has had MULTIPLE folks ONAIR 4 Biden to skip debates. BIDEN=WEAK.  #Trump2020Landslide Nolte: Brian Stelter Is Gaslighting You About CNN‘s Push for Biden to Skip Debates  via
His campaign co-chair is another matter.  He's had a few issues with campaign staff hasn't he?
Sanders has been earlier and more emphatic in his insistence that people vote for his former primary opponent over Trump this time around, right?
How disassociated from reality are YOU thinking Biden would be any better?????? Lmfao!! Laughable
Joe Biden stumbles over his words from time to time. This motherfucker can’t READ. In fact, he knows better than anyone that he can’t read, and yet he doesn’t even bother to proofread a speech before stepping to the podium. #CognitiveFlatline
Now I get a text message from the Biden HQ asking if I'm wondering who Joe is going to pick for VP.  Nope I'm really not...At this point just pick one.   I need a lawn sign.
Biden would’ve said yo-mamma
If the USPS slowdown doesn't depress the count, people are not fully recognizing how Biden will run up the popular vote totals with VBM being added in states he already does well in.  Will not change states from red to blue, per se, but the raw vote count, yes.
I think one of Biden’s strengths is his willingness to bring in folks to his circle of advisors, listen to them, and defer to their expertise on a given matter. He’ll be the deciding voice in the room, but he’ll lean on his cabinet more than Trump. No more “I know everything” BS.
And they say Biden is senile... &lt;eyeroll&gt;
I can't wait to watch. Every time Trump lies he needs to be called a liar. That way,the only thing that Biden has to keep saying is - that's a lie, that's a lie, that's a lie!  #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

Where does that come from? I'm curious..  He wasn't my favorite personality but I didn't necessarily find him objectionable.. especially compared to #Trump or #Biden  Granted they're hard to compete with..
The Trump interview is full batshit. This man is not sound of mind and never has been in his political career. I cannot believe people want to watch that interview and then complain about Biden's mind.
Seriously, Dude??? B-B-B!!!  President Biden with Compassion over a Cold, Ignorant, Self Entitled Dictator Anyday! Everyday! You really are the special son, arent you?
If Joey Biden really wants my vote, he should pick me as his Vice President
I’m not doing this for Biden. I’m voting for him to give some hope to the poor, the oppressed races, the refugees, the minority religious faiths, the uninsured, and my brothers and sisters of the LGBT.
Biden isn’t perfect, but I can guarantee you he is nowhere in the vicinity of “just as bad” as Trump. That was Trump’s play in 2016…”all politicians are crooks; might as well take me”…but trying to draw that false equivalency simply isn’t true.
I might not be working on a presidential campaign this year but TRUST I’m about to organize and do whatever I can to get Biden elected.
Y’all don’t even want vote for Biden. Whew! Couldn’t be me.
Barely   Although Biden *might* have some cognitive problems, he will at least listen to the health advisors about covid, and hopefully not go against them.  It's not even "we want Biden" it's more of "we don't want Trump" haha
First, you gotta love the Brits and how they interview. Second, Trump is petty. Vote for Joe Biden for President on Nov. 3. Trump can’t be president ever again. Ever.
“The base is high 30s and that won Trump the primary but he largely won the general election because Hillary was so unpopular. And Biden’s negatives are not as high as Hillary’s so there’s a big problem.”
If Joe Biden is fortunate enough to win on Election Day (I’m done counting chickens), we need to all have a clear understanding on Day One the type of mess he’ll be inheriting, because there’s a good chance his entire four years will be spent digging us out of it.
Maybe have school children read a bunch of Trump tweets and a bunch of Biden tweets verbatim and see which ones seems vile.
These swing state polls are getting dicey for Biden. 🙄
Yeppp anybody who doesn’t believe what YOU believe is “uneducated”. I’m sure all of the “educated” people will be voting for Joe Biden this November! The man can barely speak and hasn’t done shit in 40 years of public service. we’re uneducated though!
May not be(or never was) Biden... Bait &amp; Switch!
I think he's more focused on his successful efforts to roll back Biden's 1994 crime bill, which incarcerated a generation of black males, and minority unemployment, which he helped reduce to the lowest level since tracking began.

Has the Biden campaign even sent you a boat yet?
Our politicians like Joe Biden have repeatedly pissed on and shit on the constitution and locked up millions of our neighbors. It’s not new, people are desensitized to the Democratic party’s evil.
Meanwhile Joe Biden is the one who wants to delay the election as long as possible so they can rig the outcome with fake mail in ballots
Biden’s political attack ads should just be clips from Trump’s embarrassing interviews. “I’m Joe Biden, and I approve this message. *presses play*”

Refusing to delay the primaries in the middle of a pandemic just to help Joe Biden.
Theyre covering Joe Biden because he's going to be the next President of the US, you moron. He's following the advice of scientists &amp; not running around the country causing ppl to gather &amp; die, like Herman Cain.
Well Well well.... Would you Lookie here... Joe brother owns a island TOO just like Naomi Campbell... Coincidence or Satanic Pedophilia ??

Amazing how liberal media get a pass for saying a Republican “wandered of mentally,” but if you say that about Biden (who wanders off mentally most of the time), the liberal media says, “How dare you?”

“In the first 1984 debate, Reagan, seeking re-election and at 73, the oldest person to be nominated for the presidency, seemed tired and tended to wander off mentally at times.” Sounds more like Biden but the biased NYT writer would never criticize a Democrat.

We were in western North Carolina last week. Saw half dozen trump signs, about the same bumper stickers, one Biden bumper sticker no signs and about 30 Madison Cawthorn signs. That should tell you something.
B is for Biden
Why? I think that the too much is being made of the Modi Trump Hugplomacy. Mr. Modi will make friends with whoever is next.   Dems are pragmatic too.  For example, see Shri Preston in Houston or Amit Jani in Biden’s campaign.
Nonsense? You think joe Biden forgot to pick a Vice President.
All of them apply to Biden
No vote for Biden is vote for Trump..so I call them a Trump supporter
No it was probably more! But then again Biden doesn't want people to get sick like you do! If 1500 people is a larger crowd you really are delusional!
The “edgey” people I know reposting Biden campaign ads is absolutely hilarious to me.

Well in my opinion is they need someone as in a puppet!! That liberals, Socialist, Independent, communist party can have biden do their bidding!! Even liberals know what a complete mess AMERICA would be in! wouldn’t put it past biden to get 4 for 1, AOC &amp; the 3 STOOGES VICE PRES.
he resonated with a lot of people - I don’t see that as the same as ego. People kept him where he was. I liked him a lot but saw it has his first attempt to get his name out there. I mean hey Joe Biden has been running for President since the 1988 election. It takes time.
Nobody hates Joe Biden. Lots of people don't like him for one reason or another, but hate is what drives lots of voting based on pure negative partisanship. And Trump's not going to get that from running against Biden.
I am a Republican voting for Biden come this November.

Marie Harf also claims Biden can’t wait to Debate Trump.. 🤣🤣
Yes it would be. The democrats have every incentive to defraud the election because otherwise Biden can’t win. The Democrats have taken the American political economic system hostage until November, and it is not right. They will try to blame everything on the other side.
I stand with Biden
Biden also is a lifelong stutterer. Much of his verbal gaffs are *very* much the kind of avoidance behaviors you see in stutterers trying NOT to stutter. Such issues are not uncommon to be worse under stress.
Biden is to the anti-war community.
LMAO! So Biden is better?
Biden isn't part of a lying administration at all...
Including the Central American who are here illegally &amp; don't even connect the dots if Biden wins. I read them on comments in YouTube.
After Duckworth (who lost both her legs in combat) made Biden's list for VP, Tucker Carlson began regularly attacking her, claiming she IS NOT A PATRIOT.This coming from a man who has never served in the military.
Of COURSE all these people are. Biden sucks. Whoever he picks for VP is gonna suck. This whole thing sucks.  And with ALL of that, it's still a million times better than what's there now.
The best Joe Biden endorsement so far. #ByeDon2020

Biden won't debate. duh
Old news.... anyone other than a Trump supporter doesn't care... let them waste their time..the important question is... who is the most qualified to be president... because in the end Biden is 77 and will probably be a 1 term president or less....Rice is ready day one.
Biden should only debate Trump if T’s tax returns are released.  Biden gains nothing by debating this BS artist.
"Massive amounts of generalizable data consistently show Biden leading in almost every battleground state. Highly visible yet unrepresentative signs will instead in all likelihood dictate strategy."  The wrong lesson was learned from 2016.
Biden campaign says it has agreed to debates already, but Trump camp has not  #FoxNews   BAA HAA HAA , they are going to have to remind him who he is debating and why he is debating. Dementia Joe .Aren't you all still waiting for hillary to die from your 2016 conspiracy theories? Stick with her before starting new conspiracy theories about biden..
Sure uhhh pervert camera worsen....uhh and another thing did you hear about what Biden did when they asked him to take a cognitive test because not a lot of people know this, and I told them, millions of Americans are talking about this but it's like nobody knows it
Oh and stone talking to Wikileaks and russian intelligence to discuss releasing emails..the list is long of the campaign trying to solicit help from russia..now name one time biden has asked Iran or China to help him win his election..
I'm really a tremendous person, probably the most tremendous since at least, when I took the cognitive test, and I took a cognitive test and of course Biden wouldn't do it but I did it and they said this is incredible nobody does this but i did it.
You may be pushing it with Sarah Palin, but I’d be good with any of the rest.
Let biden or his campaign ask any foreign government for help with his elections..the minute Biden says something like, China if you are listening,   we'll be onto him as well..most of the world wants normalcy out of USA..doesn't give them the right to meddle in our elections..
Maybe because Biden doesn’t use Twitter
U.S. Intelligence: China Opposes Trump Reelection; Russia Works Against Biden
Robin Williams' 'rambling' Joe Biden bit resurfaces 11 years later
NOT TRUE. Russia is WAY ahead of China/Iran in their influence of US (and other countries) elections.Everyone knows  Biden isnt WELCOMING help from China/Iran, while Trump has already welcomed Russia's help, even assisting them.
The big difference here is that neither China nor Iran have even a fraction of the influence campaign that Russia have developed: no where near  Biden isnt WELCOMING help from China/Iran.Trump already has and  the Mueller report!
Trump has been very confrontational with Russia for several years now. Why would Russia prefer Biden? China I get. They've already paid the family off. And, Iran would do almost anything to get rid of Trump. This report is pure bullshit.
You do realize that Ivanka Trump got MILLIONS in patents from China when she went on the Presidential visit there last year right, you hypocrite? Hunter Biden didn't work for the Administration........really not the same thing.
At least Joe Biden can clarify his comments!  You, on the other hand, distract and blame others for your failings and blatant bigotry.  #CENTRALPARK5 #FAIRHOUSING  #THEBLACKS

Sweetie we settled for Joe Biden.... That should be enough.
If the Biden Justice Department won’t prosecute, he should speak up now so another candidate can be nominated.
Everyone should vote NOW.  Biden has already agreed to the debate schedule and Trump has not. Biden released his tax returns. Do you think Trump will release his tax returns before this debate?  Lots of people are saying Trump and Deutche Bank are under criminal investigation.
Please don’t vote green in 2020. I love their platform but we need every vote we can get to go to Biden so we can prevent Trump from being re-elected. At this point, as much as I hate to say it, it really is the lesser of two evils. #SettleForBiden

I am so tired of the text and email begging for money.  It's not just the Biden campaign it's everyone running plus the DNC.  I get emails from Nancy Pelosi saying Maria I beg you.......lol JFC I'm ready to delete my email
Joe Biden was absolutely correct. Hispanic and Latino people come from many countries, including the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. A majority of African Americans descend from a few countries on the West Coast of Africa. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.
The big story here is that Biden can't keep his messaging straight between the image of America his team gets from polls, and the image of America he's supposed to present as a candidate. Imagine if Obama said "as you know, 78% of Latinos support X policy"
Stop it , there is no comparing the two. Trump can get up in front of a crowd and give a two hour speech with no notes. Biden can't even get a sentence out with notes.
Biden supports legalizing abortions for women that want them. Trump bans women fleeing forced abortions from entering the United States.  I understand many Catholics are upset with the former, but why are you ok with the later.
Let me guess, one of the notable exceptions is Barack Obama. The man who Biden describes as “The first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,"
Yes, compared to, say, the Pope Biden isn't very religious.  He's not running against the Pope. He's running against someone who fucked a porn star while his wife was at home with a baby and who brags how he can get away with sexual assault.
At least you're honest. ;-)  The choice is between Trump and Biden. I'll take Biden and see where we are in 4 years instead of Trump continuing to burn down the nation and wipe his arse with the Constitution.
They don't have work very hard for Team Pete.  We made it extremely easy for the Biden campaign from the day Pete dropped out.  That's why it better to expect nothing from them.  The only thing they should expect from me is my vote.

I bet you believed Hillary was sick and going to die in 2016..well we have been through all of trump's playbooks..we are not gullible like the Trump University students or helpless like the cancer kids he stole money from..get to biden once you're out of conspiracies on Hillary.
Well, let me embarrassingly admit I'm holding near max NO on Rice and "over-paid" by an average of 8 cents, so if Biden's crew is doing this I know someone high up in the campaign and will submit a reimbursement claim.
Thing is Biden totally could have talked about the diversity of the latinx community, without adding the insulting remark about the black community. C’mon man...

That’s why I hate those people. “Not voting for Biden is voting for Trump.” No it’s not, both are extremely corrupt: Biden is owned by the oligarchs that run this country and Trump is a wannabe fascist dictator. I want no part of it.
Correct. Anyone on the right would’ve had their career destroyed by this.  However, this is a distraction:   Biden is so fuddled that he can’t recognize softball questions from friendlies. His reaction was to get angry and attack.  Imagine him doing this with Xi or Putin.

That’s fine. Not at the convention. They get no benefit from it and in fact doing a joint event with Biden after the convention would have more impact. No convention time for someone to launch their 2024 Presidential Campaign.
AMERICANS SHOULD BOYCOTT KIMYE IF THEY WANT BIDEN TO WIN.  KANYE WOULD DROP OUT IF IT MEANT IT WAS DESTROYING THEIR LIVELIHOOD.
Who voted for Biden? Was he not voted as the nominee defeating Bernie in state after state with his wide support base among suburban populations and overwhelming black support for his record as VP under obama..
You can complain that Biden isn't the most religious person, but compared to Donald Trump...
Accept that Bernie didn't have popular support and move on..biden won with his suburban base and his popularity with the black communities based on his record as VP under Obama..there's no reason to blame anyone..bernie's message did not resonate with people..i wish it had..
Has Biden said he will take away people's guns? I remember the same thing said about Obama and nobody took anyone's guns
BTW they have all thrown each other under the bus to save Biden and Obama.  But ur right the GOP have zero balls to actually do something about it.
If Biden were to pick #SarahPalin for #VP, would you vote for #Trump??  🤣
He is a racist. He is telling you who he is.....
It's more likely than not Biden picked a VP weeks ago &amp; the timing of an announcement is to maximize its' effect.  This is politics performance art. VP announcements since late 80's are with 1 exception announced 2-3 days prior to convention. Ya think all prez just can't decide?
That and just calling it a hoax. Biden says he will accept nomination in his home state, so Trump comes back and says  He might use the WH. How appropriate. Looking for any advantage even if by association

Yo, America can have Biden problems or Trump problems. Your choice. But if that fraudulent pig gets re-elected Biden problems will fit into a teacup compared to the monstrosities Trump has in store “for” America over the next four years.
Truer words probably have never been spoken in the history of American presidential elections: "I am going to beat #JoeBIden!' -- said by none other than Joe Biden! himself. #CNBC
Due to Biden's mental decline, the VP pick is critical. The VP will likely be running the show from early on. That's one reason Dubya kept Cheney around. The other reason was that he and his neocon buddies had him by the balls. I'd hope for better this time.

they won't after they saw what you did to Trump.  Biden is in worse shape when it's non scripted questions.
Biden's gonna get at least 90% of the Black vote, folks. These "gaffes" don't change anything. Any Dem nominee for President is guaranteed to win at least 90% of the Black vote these days.
I think she was a perfect spokesperson for Bernie. Did you see her on "The Breakfast Club"? I disagree with her about Joe Biden, but ONLY because Trump is killing us by the thousands. ANYONE would be lucky to have her on their team.

Love it. Now if we could get Biden to keep his mouth shut and quit giving Trump ammo...
It’s a virus. Unless he has a magic wand, there’s nothing more our President could have done. Hillary, Obama, or Biden’s actions would’ve been similar, if not identical. You deranged, TDS infected libs are so far gone, you’ve lost all sense of reality.
Bollier is winning 18% of Republicans and has a 45-29 advantage with independents.  Trump leads Biden only 50-43. That would be the largest share of the vote for a Democratic candidate in Kansas since 1976:

Nobody liked Tim Kaine. At the time, it was widely regarded as a bad and confusing choice. Biden will almost certainly pick a bad VP as well. It is what it is. Democrats are idiots
Ah yes, the primaries, where Biden’s support was clearly driven by his policy stances and not by an elite/media narrative around “electability”
-You, a hater, in 2011: “Christian, why are taking multiple undergrad classes on philosophy of religion? When will those topics ever be relevant?”  -Trump, 2020, probably: “Joe Biden is mailing glitter bombs to God’s house. It’s getting in God’s eyes and it hurts God real bad.”
I guess Biden’s one of those people who think that all blacks look alike.
While this may be correct, I feel quite sure this criticism of Trump is in response to his recent rantings about Biden. You know the old saying - pot calling the kettle black. Biden has made word errors and has stuttered thru speeches, however doesn't dis Trump on his gafs.
Why did Trump make attack ad of Biden praying ???
At a debate, Biden should just lob quotes and verses from the Bible at every chance and challenge Trump to do the same.  The emperor has no clothes.
If Biden looses the election, it will be because of his own big mouth.  What a disaster.
Russian troll farms are actively working to convince progressive Dems not to vote for Biden and some are actually falling for it. HELLO? Did you see what happened in 2016? Getting played once might be excusable, but twice? This would be your OWN damn fault. Don't be dumb! #ncpol
You Ain’t Black didn’t hurt Biden and this won’t either... Taking the side of police over black lives does matter however... When you call black protesters anarchists that matters Trump
Trump picked the wrong subject here. I have met VP Biden many times and worked with his son Beau on a charity project.  He is as decent, kind and sincere as they come. And his faith is an integral part of him. Trump is no match for this man. #Biden2020
Who's the Bully...a reporter challenges Biden about his mental state and Biden accuses him of being on cocaine...anytime Biden gets a tough question which is rare... he bullys the reporter
Biden must pardon this man on Inauguration Day.
Remember when Trump ran from debates with Hillary.   He is desperate. We know him and we know Biden. Debates are a waste of time at this point.

Biden faces backlash over comparing diversity in Black, Latino communities
The DNC is a spectacle, not a policy conference. She's one of the three most visible and culturally relevant politicians in the country and she's particularly popular among young &amp; left-leaning people, two blocs Biden needs even more in states like WI where the margin is narrow.
True (he’s been at like 1%), but GOP help is cynical &amp; even 1% could alter history if it came mostly out of Biden’s pocket (I don’t think it will).
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?
It’s so adorable to see my republican friends call people idiots for considering a Biden vote because “he can’t even put together a coherent sentence” as if Trump is poet laureate of 2020.
Although you also have Bernie and Warren speaking, which makes me think this is as much about not giving AOC a leg up on some of the other future party leaders as not wanting Biden to be outdone (nearly everyone will “outdo” Biden)
Waiting for Joe Biden's VP pick is like waiting for a toddler to put on their shoes. It's like... I can just do it for you, please let me. We have places to be.
The reason theyre banning tiktok is because this guy found out Joe Biden is a clone because his earlobes look different

I watched her PBS interview. She sounds just like Biden. Fumble, bumble, stumble......she’s just as bad as he is.
Lol that's exactly what I'm going to do. Not vote for Biden. Good luck in November!
First off I said more than likely. 2nd off, Trump has shown me he’s detrimental to the country. At the very least, Biden is someone new.
Y’all already tried this one early on...Biden is reading the words of someone else. It’s called a quote. But thanks for playing.
Nobody pays attention to the amazing things he does.  DID YOU KNOW???  The average cost of prescription drugs more than doubled during the Obama/Biden administration?  Of course not, that would require the mainstream media = ijoke

Donald Trump's greatest accomplishment in office is somehow convincing me to vote for Joe fucking Biden.  Fuck.
Less than 0% chance this came from  Biden's keyboard. The man can't complete a coherent thought, and suddenly he's some scholastic warrior? Are people actually buying this?
How is Biden going to lead the world from his basement if he wins ??!!
I finally figured it out.  The only reason Trump has not been assassinated yet is that God wants him to be alive to see himself get this decimated by Biden in the election.   #GodWorksInMysteriousWays
Joe Biden is at his absolute best when he’s in the middle of a sentence, stops, waves his hands, and goes, “I’ve said too much, probably.”
We gotta choose between Donald Trump and Joe Biden 😂😂😂
Also, I think it's more likely that my elderly beagle will chase down the squirrel that sits on the trellis and critters at him than it is that Biden tweets anything. So technically the Twitterer didn't say the other thing.

Joe Biden is Racist AF. He’s been like that his whole life, he only gets away with it Because he’s a Democrat. I’m sick of it.
The problem is will the Dems and the non-Caucasian community still be enough to vote him into office.  If so, Biden really knew what he was saying.
JFC, do you not watch Pelosi and Biden? Those two buffoons can’t pronounce cat. GTFOH, can you people possibly be more petty??
Biden should insist that Trump debate Kanye first
Just saying universal health care, especially given vulnerabilities exposed by a global pandemic is wildly popular and Biden's continued opposition to it is suicidally stubborn. If he took a stand for something 69% of America and 88% of Democrats want, it would help.
Who are you VOTING FOR silly woman? Biden? The abortionists?

"THEN JOE BIDEN EITHER IS GOD OR CAN HURT GOD, AND I DO NOT CARE IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE"  -  2020
When asked if he could "hurt God" as his opponent alleged, Joe Biden shoved back one sleeve and said, "You're darn skippy. I'd give him the ol' one-two, straight in the pucker, just like on the corner back in my shoeshine days. We didn't take no guff or malarkey, deity or not."
Experts held 'war games' on the Trump vs. Biden election. Their finding? Brace for a mess #SmartNews

Split the ballot...their mindset is to take votes away from Biden if at all possible..he better check his MAGA pose’ as they lookin weak...everything with trump is “the appearance of”..he doesn’t care about succeeding like with Covid he cares about the appearance of succeeding ..
Is there anyone Biden could pick that would make you reconsider? Like I don't even particularly like Biden but he could pick Ted Cruz as his running mate and I'd still be like, "Well, shit, still gotta do this because it's not literally the worst option possible."
I’m not voting for Biden. That’s all I know for now.
The Biden Administration will be arriving in Washington with boats &amp; large nets in  just hold on Donald, the Liberals who actually give a shit about even YOUR life will be there to drain you out of the swamp soon.

You misunderstood, understandably, but you'll get it if you take a minute. He's talking about a "landslide" election in which Biden is flipping states (red-to-blue). Those states are ranked by probability of a win (even if &lt;50%). Big drop in prob after TX. AK next most prob flip.
One of the most annoying parts about this whole Biden will “hurt g-d” speech is that trump shouldn’t even be bringing religion or g-d into this. It has nothing to do with politics at all. We’ve strayed way too far from separation of church and state
Joe Biden has “polices”?  🤷🏾‍♂️
You kind of need to talk publicly to land the gig right? Roll em out and let it all hang out for the world to see. Not that Trump is better, but cmon...you can limit Biden but he can’t not talk publicly.

Boy are you reaching. Biden supporters know he makes gaffes. It’s baked in already. Kind of like Trump supporters knowing he’s a racist, actually sued as such by the UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT for racial housing discrimination and calling Mexicans rapists still on the Trump train
Nooo..Biden doesn’t own guns lol
Don't get the Republican desire to get Biden on the debate stage. It's not like Trump is a great debater or doesn't have a habit of saying controversial things.

Biden attends church more than Trump, unless Trump needs a photo-op.
Biden has probably spent more time attending church in a single year than Trump has in his life.    Though I would concede that Trump has spent more time standing on church steps holding a Bible upside down than Biden ever has.  So maybe they are equal in the eyes of God. 🙄

It’s just so bizarre to me that the onion spent the entire Obama administration building up a fake frat boy Biden persona, and now seeing that video in my timeline just gives me very specific and uncomfortable vibes. 😬
If you don’t vote for Biden, you’re voting for Trump, sweetie
I can only assume that Biden car video is him endorsing The Onion as his speech writers/election strategists.
It's a considerable stretch from "Joe Biden will be a puppet controlled entirely by AOC" to "Joe Biden is powerful enough to physically harm the Lord."
"Yeah, I was going to vote for Biden because Trump is a narcissistic insane person who is wholly unfit to govern, but then I found out he was going to nominate Val Demings as VP and I'm just not so sure anymore..."
Even then, at least the Trump would be VP instead of President. I would still vote for Biden, but also be his personal bodyguard and ensure he survives the term so the VP can't take over. 😂
This reminds me of that Wonder Showzen bit where the kids meet god and eat him. Now I'm laughing picturing Joe Biden with bbq sauce all over his face with that stupid grin
Joe Biden needs to start punting on first down. Just say nothing man. No more Interviews.
He's set the bar so low for Biden that during the debates Biden just has to show up. If I was advising Trump I'd tell him to drop the cognitive decline attacks. It just calls attention to his tenuous grasp of things.
I think we can explore the differences. The goal of exploring those differences should be to find common ground though. We already agree fuck Biden. So let's use it as a starting point to bring together African Americans and latines who agree with that
Idk where these people get off with their "Trump is the worst president ever but if Biden doesn't satisfy my very arbitrary desires I guess it's a wash" bullshit.
Clinton was out reminding people why they hate her for months by this time. Biden's hidin'. That's not going to help his numbers.    1st week of 11/16 you were saying Hispanic support for Clinton was up. Trump outperformed  McCain and has higher support with minorities NOW.
Joe Biden wants to hurt God?  How is it possible Trump has one single supporter. HOW!!!!
You're either voting for Biden and change or you're FOS. Please stop with all the clickbait.
"Less homogeneous" is very different from "not homogeneous" which is basically what Biden said. Why try and defend that statement?
In the primaries there was a huge split with older African Americans supporting Biden and young African Americans supporting Bernie. Latin Americans supported Bernie regardless of age. Are you going to use that to say we're all the same?
Anyone claiming they still might vote for Trump unless Biden VP picks suits them...is a Trump voter.
If you’re voting for Joe Biden you might actually be a racist 👀 Unlike the Trump supporters you tried to peg that on in 2016
Biden is going to take all your rights away but Trump can't even get Hillary locked up. 😂
That finally explains whisper campaigns around Harris's veep campaign, multiple sources claiming she won't "get in the eva" to Biden's liking.
Like there are truly so many valid things to criticise Biden for, including his mental stamina, but Trump is so obviously far more unstable why even bother calling attention to mental fitness? Proposal: No one over 70 eligible for the office of POTUS.
Wow, Biden is going to repeal a constitutional amendment on his first day in office. That's impressive.
I know who &amp; what Trump and Biden are. If you don't at this point you won't be capable of evaluating a debate. I think Biden will mop the floor w/ Trump, but even if Biden comes out &amp; curls up in a fetal ball on stage I'll vote for him. Trump is a plague upon us, literally.
It is mind boggling that the right can't come up with any better criticism of Biden than to say he is mentally unfit and "against God" when Trump, who has trouble reading and can't say anything remotely informed about Christianity or the Bible, is their man...
Where’s the lie? Biden is talking about a true but unfortunate reality. BA’s are much more monolithic in voting habits than the Latinx community.
I don't think God's got much to fear from J.Biden, tbh.
You’re reaching.  BA’s are the most loyal democratic voting bloc without fail. We are not monolithic when it comes to political views and values but we are when it comes to voting. Biden is correct on this one.
You and I obviously have different memories of Obama/Biden. They faced 2 pandemics and a severe recession and left the country in better shape than they got it in. I voted for McCain and Romney but thinking Biden is the end of America is just ridiculous
“He’s against God, he’s against guns” Trump says of Biden.   In an attack ad earlier this week, Trump’s campaign used a photo of Biden praying.

That much everyone seems to agree on. Trump is definitely down from 2016 but nothing shows Biden leading. I know Democrats are polling the general election for the House race. I simply don't buy that Republicans aren't. It doesn't make sense.
My source further elaborates that he has not seen anything from Republicans showing a Biden lead. Possible this is an unweighted poll though (before they weight it to match the electorate). Outside groups have done polling here and they match campaign. Trump down from 16.

Mr. Biden the VPOTUS Poo.
Fascinating to see so many people on Twitter try to call Biden racist for his comments about black people (which I’m not saying weren’t messed up) when Trump has said much worse things like 10,000 times over the last four years. Fascinating.
It’s very simple. Joe Biden expects to get 99% of the Black vote and about 75% of the Latino vote.

Watching Joe biden make a mockery of the democratic party. This is a dead party when this is the best they can do 😂😂
As a lifelong dem living in the south I think Biden is making a mistake making this an issue -  he will not win anyone over with this.

President Trump is succeeding where Joe Biden failed: Steve Cortes
"Joe Biden said Wednesday that he wants to 'get police more money' to handle the 'god-awful problems' they face in the line of duty."  Reform just means giving police more money for "increased training and oversight" — it doesn't work  Defund police and invest in something useful

It would be an interesting poll. Speaking only for myself, a Warren pick would make me reconsider not voting for Trump. None of the other candidates would do that, and Biden isn't going to pick someone who makes me want to vote D so I guess it's LP or write-in.

US election 2020: Trump says opponent Biden will 'hurt God'. Sorry ⁦ but God can not be hurt by any man and your pandering to Christians is laughable.
...and the Dems know Biden is not mentally or physically competent to compete, so they’ll do a switcheroo (is that possible?), and put Obama in there! I don’t worry at all about this as God will make sure Trump stays President! God has got this!!!
Don’t put that sh.t on me,I am working for Joe Biden for President and I am WHITE. Ok you are forgiven.
Ya got me there. It’s more of my prayer that Biden picks competent people to be in other positions, like Cabinet.
They're already/been formulating a deja vu campaign of Bernie blame again, not a good sign for Biden...
Biden is the lesser of two evils. Makes me punch the air. I have to vote for him.
But he gets blamed for Biden's loss, I'm going into bestial psychic attack-mode for the first and last time...
Deciding who to #VOTE for! Consider this.Biden acts like he cares about US.Had 40 yrs to prove it. And?President Trump proves he cares about US.Politics for 4 yrs,he's done too much to list.Congress went home w/out solution for US needed today.He's working to fix what can by EO!
For Joe Biden.
tRump with all this God, Bible and Gun talk is just orange with jealousy over all the power and influence Biden possesses.
The media is sure fans of decrying literally everything Trump does, but loves when Biden says (or when Obama said) he’ll use executive power to accomplish stuff. The people low key like authoritarianism- when it is on their side. This is true for D and R.
Of course crime comes down when you jail everyone. I’m sure Democrats areglad that blacks must vote for Biden regardless of how this impacted their community, since they give up on their race if they stray from the Democrat party line.
Biden is a poltician and is about as empathetic as any. Suffering tragedy does not make you a better person by default. Attacking decent men like Romney as sexist and “going to put blacks back in chains” shows a lot about his character.
Good for you. I’m sure you believe Trump is a man of faith because he is endorsed by many faith leaders who coincidentally have political aims that align with his. It’s not like Biden authored the bill that led to the higher mass incarceration of minorities in modern history.
Yeah, I’m sure that saying that people are attractive means you fuck them. Biden has far creepier interactions with children than Trump.
I don’t believe Biden hates God, but neither of them are good Christians.  Biden does use minorities as political pieces- as most politicians do. That meets the threshold for racism if you are a R, obv not if you’re D.
All the articles implying Trump has sex with his daughter or Republicans want poor people dead, while otoh all rioters are peaceful, Dems are trying to save the US, etc. but  how dare the fact Biden can’t string together prewritten speeches be pointed out. Or his racist comments
Sad to watch...😔 It makes me even angrier at the Democrats for using Biden as a pawn! He will not be their candidate. He’s clearly incapable of speaking coherently. Look for the switcheroo soon...

Loved the quiet and clear air. It’s still not back too prelevels. Maybe Biden should shut it down for two weeks as a national holiday for a National sleep in February
If it weren't so cruel, it would be laughable.   "Kanye West is a famous Black person. Of course ALL Black people will vote for him instead of Joe Biden. Because he's Black. And he's famous. He's one of their own, right?"  They are wrong on so many levels.
As far as we know, Joe Biden has been happily married twice. Which is two more times than Trump.
While the headliner today at FHQ was Ohio shifting back into Toss Up Biden territory where it began, it remains one of those states on the cusp of a change, hovering around the partisan line separating Biden and Trump states.

Straight up gonna vomit. But we knew Biden was going to exploit the Obama era. Mans is crazy...
People voted for Biden because he was NOT part of the Radical Left.   Biden has been in the public eye longer than Trump has. It's going to be hard to make this stuff stick.  In 2016, the Hillary haters put hum over the top. He can't count on them this time.
And that Biden would be better served by telling America what he will do to restore our country.
Kinda sad all the normal people i know can see this but for some reason biden campaign is to dumb to do it lol
Additionally, the average swing across all states from 2016 to now is just under 8 points in the Democrats' direction. AK's shift has been a bit above that a 10.5 points toward Biden. But PA's swing has been more modest and below that overall average. Biden +5. 7/
Given that methodological choice, the extant calendar 2020 polling in AK &amp; PA (with that adjustment for timing) gives us the following: AK: Trump +3.53 PA: Biden + 5.07 3/

Isn’t it interesting how he only changed his tune when he began to trail Biden in the polls by double digits?  Obviously $600/month would be a good thing, but not only is it the bare minimum, it’s already several months too late for millions of Americans
John Lewis, George Floyd, Colin Kaepernic, Joe Biden, RBG, Nicholle Wallace, Joy Ried, Kamala Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Col. Vindman? Every month a hero steps up.
Biden's talking about in-bred hillbillys, right? Your version has been cut&amp;pasted. In summary regarding violent criminals (rape&amp;murder) Biden said "We have obligation to cordon them off from rest of society, try to help them, try to change behavior.That's what we do in this bill"
I mean Biden would get embarrassed. I can’t knock the strategy when Trump is out here killing his own campaign daily
Trump is more of the general political rah rah to the highest levels. People love yas qweening their pols to own the other side….idk if we will ever see truly civil politics at the top again. Biden surely isn’t, and obv not Trump.

At FHQ the current tipping point state is PA (always in yellow on the Spectrum).  Biden is +5.19 there as of now.
With only 2 on a stage and only a couple of moderators, distance, therefore debates (in person) should not be an issue. For God’s sake, Biden’s mind is so far away, no virus could ever find it.
Wait what! Joe Biden can't wait find out who he picked?🤔
Oh please. Biden hasn’t done anything in his 40+ years in government and you think he’s going to start now? The poor old Joe is already starting.

Georgia and Ohio remain the most competitive states on the board at FHQ, but they switched spots in the order yesterday. The Buckeye state is now the closest state. Just 0.07 points separate Trump and Biden there right now.

Because anyone whos watched Biden in front of a camera for more than 3 minutes can see that his age is getting too him rapidly.
After at least a week of not spending money on TV ads, the president's campaign is going to come out with a new set of them next week supposedly attacking an America under Biden.    Um, that is "new?"
You're lying to associate Biden with the Green New Deal.  But thanks for playing.
I mean Biden is a hundred years old and failing so it may matter somewhat
Wow. Really bad poll numbers for Trump. Biden is doing great, leading Trump by far!   not a factor!!!
I fucking hate Biden and I detest Buttar and his workplace discrimination against women should those accusations be true. But they are better than the alternative. Someone on the ballot is gonna win regardless of if you do or don't vote.  Lets make sure the better one wins, yea?
Biden has assembled a foreign policy team that can undo a lot of wrong that Trump has done. He has shown that he more than likely won't try touching the medical care and workplace rights of transfolk that Trump has tried (and sometimes succeeded) tampering with
"No we vote for Biden, he's the same as Trump and he sucks"  "No we can't vote for Shahid Buttar, he's been accused of workplace discrimination"  Biden &gt; Trump and Buttar &gt; Pelosi means we vote that way, that's the end of the discussion imo

#DearMichigan Joe Biden would STILL have the US border open to all travelers from China! I fail to see how he would've gotten private companies to offer  producing PPE, especially when he has people in his ear that think many of those companies shouldn't even exist as they do.

Agreed.   I think the only way Trump gets Biden on stage is if he provokes him with some grade-A schoolyard taunting.
It will be interesting seeing Trump fight the stacked deck. With Biden being less than functional, you know the moderators will do all they can to tilt the playing field.

My thoughts are it’s going to be like two drunken uncles fighting for the last piece of chicken. Still voting for Biden though
Like at least with Biden vs Trump the GARBAGE electoral system means that people not in swing states don't have to worry about their vote mattering but GOD what a shitty deflection from the actual point at hand for folks who use that excuse
Really...he should be out there holding underwhelming rallies, full of people who are too patriotic to protect themselves (and others) from a contagious disease.          Also: “bsaement” Biden? Not nearly as catchy as #BunkerBoyTrump 😂
He has also seemed to assemble one of the best foreign policy teams available that could undo a lot of the harm Trump has done for relations over the past 4 years but nah Biden is a shitty person so I guess we shouldn't care
I genuinely do not give half of a fuck if you sleep better at night not voting for Biden over Trump because you tricked yourself into thinking checking a box on a ballot degrades your humanity or whatever but my safety is partially dependant on Biden winning

Because of the assumption that Biden wants to serve just one term, it's likely that his VP choice would have the top line on the next president. I do not want another celebrity as president.
I hope and pray that Biden wins and I believe he will. However when it comes to which party works for corporations, they both do.
I agree   Biden would rip DT into small shreds.  So the premise of "If Joe Biden refuses to debate..." does not make sense.
I will ONLY vote for Biden if he says “Let’s Pokémon Go to the polls”
Im yanggang but ill be voting libertarian this election would get more of what i want from  than from biden or trump
Only way to make America great again is by getting you out of the White House so Joe Biden can demonstrate real leadership unifying our great country and leading the charm to contain COVID-19, re-engaging our allies and strengthen our economy.
I heard on MSNBC that Biden is afraid to debate you. He needs to be disqualified is he does not want to debate!
Um, I think a Biden win would remove Trump from office. Just saying.
Honestly liberals would get more of what they want from libertarians than democrats or gop at this point end war on drugs end forever wars demilitarize police end corporate welfare all shit neither biden or trump will ever do.
What crimes you ass? Best President Ever. Someday you'll realize what a Danger the DNC is to US! If Biden's elected, there won't be a Country left in 4 yrs. But some of you decide to remain blind.
Just want to watch Biden to blow 45's little mind off the stage.
Biden is expected to begin one-on-one interviews in the coming days.
I’m voting for Biden if he debates a Yorkshire terrier and loses. Badly.  And I’d crawl over glass to do so.
Burning Bibles. Burning American flags. Burning American cities. This is the Biden campaign.
As August opens with just 94 days until election day on November 3, Biden starts it with the tipping point state -- PA now -- tilted a but more than 5 points in his direction.
I like to think that all Biden needs to do in January is walk into the Oval Office with Major, his (quite large) German Shepherd, and Trump will run like the coward he is.
TikTok has 800M active users worldwide.  41 percent of TikTok users are aged between 16 and 24.   TikTok has the Highest Social Media Engagement Rates Per Post.  Should tRump ban TikTok in the U.S., he best be prepared to hand Biden a shitload of free ads. #WrathOfTikTok
Now I'm definitely voting Biden 😡
Always vote for who you think should win ive voted libertarian every election and been told i let other person win everytime lol but you know what when biden starts next war or trump does more terrible shit it wont be my fault lol itll be on their voters heads
That would get me to vote biden but as of not im voting for
I supported Yang and his platform of universal basic income. I still see a good soul with Biden. I do not with Trump. And I see a threat to our democracy with trump and especially now with Barr. It’s not personal...exactly.
Yeah shes not yang but compared to biden or trump its not even close lol
All the polls this week shifted some states around at FHQ, but the work week ended the same as it began: with Biden projected to clear 270 electoral votes on his Strong and Lean states alone.
You have work to do in N.C. We need more support for Biden here and more anti-Trump ads. Get busy! #Biden2020 #EndTheNightmare
If it suppressed Trump's votes- it would also suppress Biden's... PEOPLE ARE STUPID!!!

WATCH CREEPY JOE BIDEN:
Man I wish Joe Biden was this cool
I think he needs to pick someone with further political aspirations. I honestly don’t think Biden will last 4 years as president. Not that that is going to stop me from voting for him...
Yup. They went to Jared.
No rumor Clinton was a regular to pedophile island. They were to old for Biden he likes them about 6-12 years old.
I thought Biden said he was going to pick a woman for VP.💥   via
you &amp; all your friends never asks other democrats are they paid by Biden campaign? Vernon Jones is right you are paid to shape the narrative of this country. Finally another person has had enough of y'alls bullshit
the best part about my handle is that it's impossible to find me. like are you looking for joe biden? joe jonas? just another joe? it's really a pretty funny joke
The more we see Biden and the more we see social unrest, the better Trump will look.
There was finally a polling update out of NH yesterday (along with a couple of backdated releases from UNH). That was enough to shift the Granite state into Lean Biden territory.   PA moved back there too.
This is a rather biased trope. Obama and Biden reduced unemployment left over from 43's housing meltdown and generated economy 45 loves to brag about. So let's look at NOW, shall we? GNP down 33% b/c 45 utterly failed at controlling pandemic.
That will be 9PM Eastern after FL, NC and PA score big Wins for Biden. At that point, the rest will be Karmic icing on the cake!

Biden 2020 to put an end to this horror.
Please vote for Biden
**DAILY UPDATE** The Electoral College Map (7/30/20)  Added polls from Arizona, Florida, Michigan, New Hampshire(!), North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. [PA moves back to Lean Biden; NH to Lean Biden] #2020election #ElectoralCollege
sounds familiar. Many libs said similar stuff when Clinton was “100% gonna win” then turned around and cried manipulation for years- to the point of impeachment. In the slim chance Trump wins, watch Biden supporters cry voter suppression / ballot manipulation.
You’re right. RBG should have retired when the Dems controlled the WH+Senate. My point is that anybody who cares about getting a new liberal justice should be doing everything they can to elect Dems. As bad as they are, Biden+the Dems won’t confirm an anti-Roe judge
We replaced two SCOTUS judges in those two years. If you care about RBG &amp; Breyer &amp; possibly Thomas being replaced by people who won’t gut Roe v. Wade, then vote for Biden and help to win back the Senate. I don’t see how voting third party will help to accomplish this
I can if the Dems win the White House+Senate   Unless you think a Democratic majority would vote against Biden’s SCOTUS pick?
And the RCV proposal fails 154-13 with 4 abstentions. The Biden rep argued that with RCV someone would technically win with an initial plurality of support (which would require rules changes to how the convention in particular chooses a presidential/VP nominee). #DNCRulesMeeting
A Biden rep was against the ranked choice voting amendment, and as a result, we'll likely see a split on this one.  #DNCRulesMeeting
So Biden has Obama holding  a rally during what's supposed to be his funeral. What a POS  the Democratic party is.
Here's a fun one. Proposal to institutionalize the delegate deal hatched between the Biden and Sanders camps. This would get rid of the automatic reallocation of statewide delegates (unless released by the candidate) that has been a part of the rules forever. #DNCRulesMeeting
With all of that out of the way -- and an hour in -- it is onto the rules resolution proposals. Up first is the proposal described here (an agreement between the Biden and Sanders camps). #DNCRulesMeeting
that is because Trumpism is a cult. Joe Biden people don't need to be so overtly obnoxious
If your people don’t show up on Election Day and your opponents are able to coalesce around and actually for vote for one candidate, that’s not rigging: that’s just the nature of elections  I say this as a Bernie supporter in a state that Biden won overwhelmingly
This is the only reason Biden has a chance. The masters of the universe don’t fear him
When is the first debate? I can’t wait!
If enough people do it a hell of a lot more than voting for biden
Conversely, now the Democrats will insist on a timely election because Trump opposes it.   Biden officially is nominated.  Trump shows Biden to being incapable of running the country.  The Democrats can not postpone the election to get a lucid candidate.  Trump wins.
debate Biden from computers have them put it on national TV both of you side-by-side screenshots no predetermined. questions ask what you want a debate is necessary for you Mr. President
He would be a HUGE upgrade to someone who had to ask a doctor on NATIONAL TV if ok to inject disinfectant into our bodies!!  You cannot compare the mental capacity of the two. Trump is just plain dumb &amp; has no excuse. Biden was born with a speech impairment &amp; had his entire life.
For the time being, get used to states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin constantly changing categories at FHQ. It isn't so much a function of wild fluctuations as it is their positions in the averages. Each is around that Lean/Toss Up Biden line.
Remember when Biden said something to the effect that Obama was "clean" he suffered for that inappropriate remark for 8 years.
Biden slams Trump for promoting false COVID-19 claims from 'crazy woman'
And until earlier this week, Ohio has been a Biden Toss Up at FHQ. It is just barely a Trump Toss Up in our averages at the moment, only marginally closer than Georgia as of today. Those are the clearest targets if Biden is to go on offense. 2/2
Ohio is next in line in the order for Biden after the six consensus battlegrounds (AZ, FL, MI, NC, PA &amp; WI). 1/
I agree with you mostly, and don't want to vote for Biden, but I fear we will all be dead in 4 years to make a point.
Woo hoo! I’m voting      Anyone know how Cooper is doing in polls against NO PLAN DAN?
So while Pennsylvania shifted back into Biden Toss Up territory at FHQ just recall that the Keystone state is among a group that is tightly knit around the Lean/Toss Up Biden line. Around 5 points in Biden's direction.
Amen. America 1st. Best President Ever! Reelect  4 more yrs. If Biden is elected we won't recognize US in 4 yrs. The violence he is ignoring now will become the Norm. Marshall law will be necessary. America won't be 1st. He'll finish selling US out to China.
I mean Biden is like a hundred so it might
He's not going to  we're not going to have this under control until we have a President Biden. Flipping the Senate will make it easier as well. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Who should Biden select as has running mate? Harris, Warren or Duckworth? Let us know what you think!
I hate it,but you’re right.Trump will lose his shit when he loses the election.He’ll scream bloody murder about the election being rigged,corrupt,deep state fix.He’s already laying the groundwork for his cult members.I doubt there will be a peaceful transition to Biden.biden is pro-abortion so his “devout catholic” title should automatically be removed
Every time Joe Biden speaks it becomes more obvious that something is not right. It’s sad that the left hates Trump so much they are willing to put him through all of this it’s cruel.
Remember when Obama bashed your father because his arms couldn’t reach the computer to type and other things Obama called your father like Biden as well. All I can say is to you remember lack of disgrace those two showed to your dad
Lol No but I would wait in an 8hr line to watch Trump debate Biden

Biden's crime legislation led not only to a doubling of the prison population, but a tripling of federal funding for local law enforcement as well, directly leading to the militarized police force we see today.
I know that the entire investigation is a political sham and that it will turn up the same obama-Biden killshot that all the other ones have: none.
You must be lying. Because Biden is far from left
Biden kicked the hive.
How did Joe Biden win the democratic vote again? It wasn’t on the basis of ideas, a majority just said “we don’t trust America, a centrist white male is our only hope” and here we are.
"God is dead. And I have killed him."  -Joe Biden
Absolutely not. At the same time, I'm not at all OK with what Biden stands for either. Segregation, mass incarceration, the police state and endless war are all parts of his legislative record. How can I be OK with that?

By Kate Nicholson: Brexit row: Joe Biden ‘poised to favour Ireland over UK after election’
Nonsense. Biden is so middle of the road, he’s boring. You and trump however, are woefully incompetent.
The less you talk the better, Mr  Biden!
Please don’t DM me telling me that voting for Biden makes me not a Christian and then unfollow me. Thanks 😇
The ban was part of the infamous 1994 crime bill, authored by Biden in conjunction with pro-police lobbyists, which exacerbated mass incarceration.  Biden has (rightfully) expressed regret regarding much of the bill. The assault weapons ban is an inextricable part of its legacy.
Get this one:
I don't know why we have vice presidents. If a president becomes incapacitated or dies, go straight to the speaker of the House. But I do know that as soon as Biden got the nod, he should have picked a VP right then and there.
This absurd list of "reasons" Rice is the pick makes me more confident that it's Harris. 1) Biden also knows Harris well. 2) For VP, Senate experience matters far more than White House experience. 3) That debate moment was political theater. 4) A misdirect right now makes sense.
And yet one of the most qualified candidates to ever run for president lost to him, just like Biden is apparently trying to.   If they aren't going to campaign for a compelling progressive vision for this country, Democrats should just be quiet and let Trump lose this himself.
Well look at that, looks like Trump enjoys bombing Iraq and Syria just as much as Obama did. But go on about Biden.
The Trump campaign has decided to attack Joe Biden as an enemy of religion &amp; the Bible. It’s a mean-spirited attack, for sure. But it also seems unwise. I’ve rarely heard a politician speak as authenticity as Biden does about the role of his Christian faith in his life.
They're already saying "Why won't Biden lead?!?!?" even though he isn't president.
And I say “Christian imagery” because faith outreach and Christian outreach aren’t interchangeable. Biden is pitching a large tent by using moral calls for shared interfaith dignity (see linked statement), but specific Christian themes in his narratives.
is running ads to piss off the President, their strategy is not about making big ad buys to support races in competitive districts or Biden in battleground states, though it happens sometimes.  Way more efficient to donate directly to candidates or their PACs.
The DNC is truly a group of idiots.  1st Hillary, and now Biden?  Hillary being one of the most unlikeable people on the planet and Biden clearly showing Mental Illness.  I don't get it.
Ya, Trump’s tweet was allll about Kanye, hoping he’ll take votes away from Biden and split the ticket. Which isn’t racist at all, LOL. Doesn’t Kaye know he’s being used?
SE, if you don’t vote for Biden because of his VP pick after alllll the BS that Trump has done to this country, then you are voting for Trump. Period.  Suck it up and do the right thing. Unbelievable...
What Biden said was IGNORANT, but I’ve seen way too many bad takes. If you are willing to vote for Trump because of what Biden just said, then wait to I show you Trump has been doing for the past three decades 👀
How Joe Biden is constantly fucking up the Black vote being handed to him on a silver platter is absolutely beyond me.  Mr. Magoo looking ass boy.
1973- the year Joe Biden came to Washington.  47 years with zero accomplishments.   Who in their right mind would vote for a 78 year old who has been in politics for that long??  Not to mention his cognitive decline...
Nope. He didn't.
There is no amount of mental gymnastics the Biden campaign can do to explain away this racism. Wow.
The only way Joe Biden can hurt God is if he doesn't choose her as VP.
Not saying there isn’t room for improvement by Biden in how he talks about race, but we have a President who says “Kung Flu.”
#GSDSforJoe! More pics to come when our Biden bandanas arrive!
The “against God” swipe at Biden was egregious and absolutely shameful. Trump has no sense of decency. At all.
If you “want to vote for Biden” then vote for Biden. If you want to grandstand and spew bullshit...well, seems like you’ve got that covered.
Biden can say as much as he wants.  Unfortunately he has an extensive record of doing the opposite and supporting/passing legislation that harms people and increases profits.  I dont trust him or anyone around him, simple as that.
I love the show, but your teaser talking about Biden gaffe and not adding Trump with his crazy remarks in OH was inappropriate.
Interesting that Cupp would vote for Biden with Harris but not with Rice. I wonder how many other anti-Trump Republicans agree.  Of course, it's foolish. If you're a Never Trump conservative, it must be because you recognize the existential threat he poses. Vote Biden either way.
when discussing polls, I've heard there's low democratic enthusiasm for voting for Biden. Has anyone asked the enthusiasm level for voting out trump? I'm low-moderate on the former, high on the latter.
“After nearly four years of Trump’s chaos, incompetence, corruption, narcissism, nepotism, racism, authoritarianism and nihilism, I’m very seriously considering voting for Biden” She lists all the horrible things about Trump, then equivocates. “But he’s OUR lying racist pigdog.”
And young black voters skepticism about Biden is fully justified based upon the record thus far:
Saw Mulatto trending. First thought: what has Biden or Trump said now? 😂😂
Is this from the Onion? Or the NY Times pitchbot twitter? FFS, the writer may as well refer to himself in the 3rd person - "What would Joe Biden need to tell a Matt Lewis to earn his vote? More importantly, Matt Lewis would want to tell Joe Biden some things"
Biden is much more popular among older people than Hillary was, and Florida has a lot of those. Makes sense when you add that demographic advantage over Hillary + (hopefully) a wider national margin and you have blue Florida.
Biden camp taps Republican Trump foe  to rev up #Latinovoters  via
Maybe the polls are more accurate this time at the state level, maybe Biden maintains a big national lead that allows for these clear but not overwhelming wins.    I’m def more cautious than that model.
At the height of Biden’s numbers so far, he’s led in these 2 states by no more than 4, currently less than that in AZ.    State polls less frequent and reliable than state polls, Hillary posted similar state-level polling leads in several states that didn’t materialize.
Half of my Twitter feed is going to have a meltdown whichever way the Biden VP pick goes and I'm really not looking forward to it. I got bad news for y'all: it's not your choice, and it never was. (Your person is gonna keep on regardless and you should too).

Biden 49 Trump 49
You can, and I love your tweets, just dont agree with this one. Trump has his bad moments, but he also has some wins. I dont like polarization in the country, but again I dont think it will get better with biden in the office.
I don’t think you can claim Joe Biden isn’t a racist, then look at his record with a straight face.
Hypothetical: Rob Portman retires in 2022. President Joe Biden has a national approval rating of around 48 approve/50 disapprove. Republicans decide to nominate Jim Jordan for Senate and Democrats nominate Tim Ryan. Who wins the Senate election?
I'm voting for Biden.     I saw the "not going to take a cocaine test" "are you a junkie" comments. They made me cringe. I wish he'd stop trying to be "cool" ("...then you ain't black") and just answer yes or no questions with yes or no.
Thoughts about Biden: 1) I think he'll be a great president. 2) I'm confident he'll surround himself with highly qualified, capable people. 3) I wish he'd think a bit more before he speaks sometimes. 4) He definitely needs a Black woman as his running mate.
That's more likely with Biden than it is for Trump, without a doubt.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
If you take this at face value, you are just asserting a Biden blowout. There isn't really a battleground. Don't take this at face value.  I'll take an example: I'll believe Biden win's NC on election day and not a day sooner.

Fucking fuck fuck. And fuck you if you are wavering on voting for Biden. Yet another reason I’m trying to get citizenship in another country. Too many selfish fucks in this stupid country. I’m tired of seeing it and reading it on Twitter. My tweets next yr? Ciao Mofos.
I think that's called a Biden presidency.
Apparently when Joe Biden becomes president a Bill of Rights amendment will be invalidated "immediately and without notice".  This nonsense could be refuted by any D student in a high school civics class.  All Republicans have is scare tactics. Unfortunately, they work.
I ordered my mail-in/absentee ballot yesterday. I will be voting for Mr. Biden. You, Mr. Trump, have been a total waste of 4 years as US President and of 74 years as a human being -- I'm guessing, "human being."
No democrat is going to take away guns so stop lying to everyone.  And Biden is NOT going to take any guns

Not surprised a bit that ⁦ photoshopped these images. It’s in the same vein of those “Biden’s America” ads that that try to terrify viewers using actual footage from Trump’s America.
Re: POTUS’ Biden will “hurt God” comment.  Biden has been running more Christian imagery (praying, mostly) in his ads than any Democratic general election candidate I can remember. Kerry didn’t at all, Obama did to a decent extent, Clinton not so much.

Kanye West openly admits here that he has not abandoned Trump, has no intention to win and wants only to hurt Joe Biden. A shocking and, given he said one month ago he was actually abandoning Trump, dishonest turn to the right. I have to ask: who paid Kanye’s debt?
God must not be as all powerful as all of the Bible verses say he is.  Or else Biden is really that damn powerful.  Either way, why would ANYONE listen to Donald f’ing Trump about anything that has to do with Christianity?  He’s the most morally bankrupt man to ever hold office.
Of course it is. Democrat who has repeatedly said she is going to take out the NRA targets the most powerful gun lobby right as Biden announces he plan to attack gun rights?

The over-70 crowd in my neighborhood is all in on Biden. Shirts, hats and bumper stickers everywhere.
By applying that to NC, which has Biden +2, we set our expectations at Tr*mp +3 instead.
I have invented a statistic to keep my election expectations in check. Basically, I look at the 538 number for Florida, then subtract it from all their other calculations. The Florida Adjusted Information Level.   Right now Biden is +5.1 there according to 538, so the FAIL is 5.1

The poll doesn't work. It leaves out important candidates. I will vote for neither Biden nor Trump, but I'm not undecided. I'm voting for
Biden will lose for the following reasons:  1) Limited passion for Joe by his base.  Opposite on the Trump side 2) Civil unrest works against Biden and not for him given the Dem views on policing 3) The Debates: Trump should dominate 4) The cognitive issue  5) AA% inc for Trump
My favorite Trump campaign attack against Biden is still the one that said "we can't risk electing the oldest president ever elected" even though if Trump won he would also be the oldest president ever elected.   It really encapsulates the overall BS of Trumpism.
Biden is not progressive. In fact, the Democratic Party is soft on every progressive issue that truly matters. Not just soft, truly squishy.
Biden, so strong he can hurt God!
Idk where these people get off with their "Trump is the worst president ever but if Biden doesn't satisfy my very arbitrary desires I guess it's a wash" bullshit.
Between the “Biden hurts God” and “Latinos are diverse, unlike blacks” riffs today, really makes you wonder if it’s time for faithless electors to do their duty.
Clinton was out reminding people why they hate her for months by this time. Biden's hidin'. That's not going to help his numbers.    1st week of 11/16 you were saying Hispanic support for Clinton was up. Trump outperformed  McCain and has higher support with minorities NOW.
Just wondering your thoughts on Biden’s VP pick ...also, tomorrow’s lottery numbers? #ClaireVoyant #psychichotline
Kamala will probably be spending a lot of time in the Senate, whether she is Biden’s pick or not

If the cross, death, and the grave couldn't hurt God what makes you believe Joe Biden can???
Biden will hurt God? Powerful guy I guess.
Follow up to this. Early days ppl said Trump was archie bunker racist. kinda held onto stereotypes but really didn't think anything of them or have malicious intent. I don't think that framework quite holds anymore.  Is it a better framework for Biden. I'm thinking it might be
If he could not be him, Biden's gaffe's would actually have runway. But you're seriously gonna counter with this foolishness. Come on man
If Biden wins, I'm going to have to spend a lot of time considering whether than amount of grace I give Biden's verbal flubs makes sense in light of the amount or lack of grace I gave Trump's flubs.  There is a difference, but it's a worthy thought experiment to do continually
Hahahah exactly. They would put the KKK hat on him and post this video everywhere. When its biden, let it slip, he cool.

Biden is a politician so obviously stuck in the 70s and 80s.  His solutions now are to double down on the "solutions" and policies that got us I to iur current predicament in many ways.  21st century issues require 21st century solutions, not a dinosaur.
Trump’s position is incredibly weak and his recent interviews show that he utterly incapable of defending his actions or the current state of the country. He might believe that he can beat Biden, or that he’s got some trick up his sleave, but he’s wrong.
I honestly don’t understand this thinking. Biden most definitely should debate Trump. Rile him up, step back and let him self-immolate. The only reason Biden shouldn’t is if he can’t handle it for some reason, but that’s a different problem entirely.
Lyin' Joe Biden, scrambling to cover his arse.
I don’t fuck with Biden Or Trump. Biden getting my vote though, dat boy trump gotta get the fuck up outta there.
Zooming out a little bit though, doesn’t this argument extend to Medicaid as a whole program, not just the Biden plan stuff?
You are ignoring what I said ! Can you tell me anything Biden has accomplished and that he is not a racist or is either of these two things not important to you?
Twitter &amp; Facebook's action on removing Trump's misinformation about covid shows that they DO have the capacity to act swiftly and the appetite for removal.  NOW DO ELECTION MISINFORMATION - per your OWN policies
Sherrell it’s been proven to you by many of Biden’s videos that not only is he incompetent he is a proven racist!   Now if you can tell me anything Biden has accomplished other than being Obama’s side kick in his 47 years of public service I am listening!
If you can listen to Biden with his continued incoherent ramblings and still entertain voting for him then you have more issues than can be corrected.
The only piece I've seen on this thus far: he took more votes from trump than Biden
This pathetically desperate and also laughable. Joe Biden is a radical?! The party’s nominee illustrates the CURRENT direction of the party. Lumping him in with the committed left is going to require quite the con job.
But I am assured by well meaning liberals that "it cant happen here" and Biden will save us all.
Who’s getting excited to hear Biden’s VP pick? Any guesses? 🤔 #2020Election #Biden #VicePresident #dukeblue #anydaynow
Honest question. Does Biden have a realistic plan to fix the eviciton and homeless crisis?  That is, does he have a plan to house people who have no reaoruces and no jobs?  And if its "give more money to police to round up the 'criminals'" Thats not a good plan.
That’s actually the least of the things about Biden that bother me.
This progressive isnt convinced Biden is a worthwhile candidate. I was told Bernie was too old, I am selfish for supporting M4A, i dont vote anyways so I dont matter among hundreds of insults and now this. That bridge was burned in the primaries.
With 88 days to go until Trump's reelection, Biden's handlers have still not been able to select a running mate for him.   They have, however picked a campaign theme song: "Nowhere Man" by the Beatles.
The round about argument from “Vote for Biden please” to “you dont even vote we dont need you” is hilarious to watch
The Biden campaign announced today that the former V.P. won't be travelling to Milwaukee for the Democratic convention, presumably to reassure foreign donors that there will not be any live mic moments or creepy sniffing of his as yet unnanounced running mate at the convention.
What if Biden gave $280 million to charities helping feed and home people?  Our politics are absolutely asinine.  Worthless.  At least Roman senators built public works and temples.  And dont "its against campaign law"  Yea I know, law doesnt matter now.
Biden Leading Trump Among Voters Who Favor Being Alive  via
Here’s the rest of the story from the outlet whose photo was altered without permission.
indeed - he's being used as a willing spoiler to draw votes from Biden
Biden has been known as a gaffe machine for a long time.
Trump makes at least 20 false claims in Fox interview, and of course the incompetents at  don’t correct him. They run the clip again later. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
You know why Biden won the primary in NC?  And Bernie didn't?  Because the Bernie's voters didn't show up to vote.  Sure there was a lot of shit talking about how the Democrats "hate the left...". But the reality is the Bernie voters didn't go vote, and not just here in NC.
I think Biden didn’t give a full context in his comment and I think that neither did poltifact. I didn’t say anyone lied except Tulsi Gabbard. Are you a bot? Often bots struggle with nuance and aim for these attack lines without substantative prose. That’s how the algo works.
This is absolutely horrifying to consider the implications of, even if Biden is elected as President. This could end up destroying the Internet as-is.
Shirtless Biden Washes Trans Am In White House Driveway
Biden's been getting a lot of campaign mileage out of hanging back and not really drawing attention to himself. He should probably stick to that approach.
Um...yall were just yelling that Kanye was gonna steal votes from Biden just because he was black.
I'd rather have a Biden/Beavis &amp; Butthead Ticket that Harris.  I'll repeat ya, GOD NO  #BidenWarren2020
It’s not. I’m pointing out that Biden’s campaign didn’t have $ until he basically swept the race for delegates. Sorry if I didn’t elaborate I just get bored telling the story of reality to people who should know how to google.
Uh Biden campaign was broke by Super Tuesday. This is just more vague “institution” talk when you don’t even know what the word “institution” means. This is why you’re dudes to me. Go ahead and just rant about “The Man.”
🙄 Rose twitter has been holding their votes for Biden hostage, ignoring the shifts in policy already made via working w/Sanders. I brought up Bernie’s lost bc your “we want structural change” is just starting to sound like a tantrum.
We already know the pre-determined results: aimed at Comey, McCabe, Strozk, Page, Orh, Brennan, Clapper, Obama, Biden and maybe Yates and Rice.
Of course you don’t actually know what’s going on. You stull believe Tulsi Gabbard circa 2019

Looks like Joe Biden’s rediscovering his “mojo”—Great  ad (finally)
The Onion was right all along!   Diamond Joe Biden 2020!!!!
Yes but I also believe that there are obvious reasons why ALL of the open white supremacist groups are behind trump. If there’s no difference between biden/trump then the white supremacists wouldn’t have a favorite. Trump is their guy for a reason despite biden being racist too
Do you think that Biden would be able to get away with using the military against protestors?  Do you think that Biden would be in with these white supremacist militia groups?   Do you think that Biden could get away with openly trying to suppress the black vote?
Joe Biden: *drives a corvette with a brooks brothers polo, hint of nearby grill*  Fox News: “cultural Marxist Joe Biden wants to outlaw white people”
Biden for sure. Trump's been fattening up...
I'd like Biden to keep his promise about the VP slot, but yes I'll vote for him whatever.
Saw your Biden tax ad. Let's see higher taxes with Biden or death with Trump? Trump has killed 160000 Americans and completely fucked President Obama's economy and you're okay with that?
It doesn't matter who he picks. Lots of things he has done should be illegal. Trump must not be allowed the see the inside of the Oval Office for another four years, and Biden shouldn't be allowed to see it either.
Grow a soul Ms Frizzle.  It’s not like Biden is somehow unaware Americans need healthcare.  It’s a central pillar of his campaign.
This is an edited photo of Biden sitting on the floor during a campaign event in a voter's home in Iowa. Report this tweet.
Just wait till Biden stsrts comforting them that he wont let "antifa" come to the suburbs either.
45's campaign will find something like this (or worse) to spin for each and every one of Biden's potential running mates with a misogynistic cherry on top.
I'm not a Biden supporter. I'm an Anti-Trump supporter. I'm not against Biden. I just know that his VP pick better be what's best for the NEXT generation. Then that VP better be good enough to check Biden for the next four years to set things in place for 2024.
Could there honestly be a worse candidate for this moment than a racist, old white guy who eulogizes segregationists, goes to bat for credit card companies, would VETO #M4A and wouldnt ban fracking?  Am I taking crazy pills or what?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Or diverting our attention from something.  Between the Booms and FBI raids, I think it’s all pointing to Biden.  I ha e a feeling they are going to nail him up.
They want Biden to say no just so they can say he said no
Is that a quote from the Biden interview earlier?
If elected president, Joe Biden said he would not tear down the parts of the barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border built by Trump's administration. But he would end construction.  "There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration."
They are both working harder to elect Biden than Biden
Lmfao and then they downgraded him to Potsie. 💀
I hate that America picked two folks, that we wouldn’t let drive cars if they were regular folks, to possibly control the country. Y’all know y’all took the keys from granny at 70. Biden 77! Slip and fall would take him out.
it’s really sad how impressed I am every time joe biden speaks a full sentence
And Harris is -10 compared to Elizabeth Warren! XD  Yet ANOTHER perfect example Warren is the Best One to be Joe Biden's VP!  #WarrenForVP #BidenWarren2020
Another item for President Biden’s to-do list.
he's a spoiler - chosen to help draw votes from Biden
And Joe Biden says:
Hey all, def a progressive Dem here, def voting for Biden/whichever amazing woman is the VP pick, AND wanted to just ask for some empathy for those of us that had relatives gassed and cremated by the Nazis (Irma Behlow, 1940, my great-great-aunt). Thanks y'all.
Are... you calling a Black woman racist!
I didn’t vote for Biden. If you wanted a progressive president you should have chosen a more effective figurehead. Don’t blame me you chose a losing horse.
Good perspective on the upcoming presidential election.
Biden and his coronation did more to harm the progressive movement than arguing on Twitter.  Biden ideologcially is a neoconservative in all but name.
Sorry that you've been sold on a lie, but there is no "Radical Left" in the US. That is a myth.  Not even commenting on the rest of your reply because I don't understand how people continue to criticize Biden for flaws Trump also has, except way worse.
The DNC and their donors are using the same game plan and same strategy as 2016 and will lose.  Biden cant even embrace meaningful climate mitigation strategies like ban frackingor , decriminalize weed, or raise taxes on the wealthy, or medicare for all.  He doesnt represent me.
The dnc picked the worst candidate with the worst policies and are relying on marginal "never trumpers" instead of building an enthusiastic coalition.   Biden isnt even campaigning. Hes advertising.   There gonna lose against Trump and its 100% the DNC and their puppeteers fault.
I'm gonna be blunt.  Biden, his team, and the DNC are a joke.  They are running Biden cause the "donors" can control Biden.  Biden is visibly unfit to lead people through this crisis and an ineffective poltician constantly on the wrong side of history. Apalling and embarrassing.
that joe biden sucks
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
I was just reading the Shaun king thread and the tv interview...  Its embarrassing... Trying to convince/gaslight reasonable people that Biden is our only choice.  Biden is a joke. And no ones laughing.
The dnc picked the worst candidate with the worst policies and are relying on marginal "never trumpers" instead of building an enthusiastic coalition.   Biden isnt even campaigning. Hes advertising.   There gonna lose against Trump and its 100% the DNC and their puppeteers fault.
The only reason Biden won’t debate Trump is because Trump does nothing but lie and distort the truth and it would be a painful exercise in fact checking to do so.  Besides, he’s already way up in the polls. Why should he waste his time on someone who’s already lost the election?
Someone needs to make this a Biden Commercial.
So if Biden wins, will he stay in his basement too?
Chuck Schumer’s boy  endorsed by Brady and Giffords, gun-grabbing organizations who are putting millions behind Biden’s candidacy. BUT, Brady and Giffords took COVID PPP funds at taxpayer expense. Oh I forgot Cal, your company did too #2A #VoteTillis
That's why Graham keeps interrupting her. They're double teaming her.
That... is not logical.
Senator Biden seems a bit shaky.
And Joe Biden says:
And Joe Biden says:
I'm not sure how much to credit this piece, but they say that the campaign's "case for Rice" is that she'll ensure the enthusiastic support of the Obamas. Like Barack and Michelle are gonna sit on their hands and let Trump win regardless of Biden's running mate. Much less Harris.
this man is a spoiler being used to draw votes from Biden
On cable it’s even  for me, maybe slightly more trump. But if I’m using watching something on a streaming channel it’s 100% Biden.
I don’t even really watch cable, I use streaming services, and EVERY SINGLE ad break is three Biden ads in a row.
Anyone else play Four Tops, “I’ll be there” and imagine Joe Biden singing it to them?
We will, by voting for Biden!!
I read this on Newsweek though.  I was just making a joke about it.
He absolutely should apologize for it and do better. I think he'll apologize. He probably won't do better...   It's not ideal but Trump won't even apologize so Biden wins on points. Wanna win on points, get Trump to apologize for anything.
Yeah, we're seeing the part of Biden that is a bad candidate here. Let's not sugarcoat that. He has plenty of upside. This is a bad side.  But also, if Trump had said this to a journalist the right would be gleeful that he owned the media. This isn't a serious critique from them
The definition of false equivlance is comparing Biden's answer on mental fitness question to Trump interview with Swan.  Not arguing it was ideal. But they are only the same if you have an added variable for disdain for Biden/Democrats.
Biden Is Right. Pay for Home Health Workers Is Paltry. #ncpol   ttps://khn.org/MTE0MjYwOQ via
Here you go that Biden understands what going on in America (with women) much more than Trump. Biden announced in July platform, if elected a $775B Plan to boost the caregiver economy, support In-Home Care Providers
Run this in NC. It seems like  and  are on the air 1/3 or 1/4 as much as the Republicans. Maybe that's just digital and streaming but it's a wide variance. And Biden and Cal are being smeared in the meantime.
We’re working on that.  Donate to the Biden campaign, America, and keep organizing to vote Trump out of office.
This is why we need a literacy test for POTUS candidates. The Biden campaign should just play this on a loop until November 3
I mean, the Axios interview is like a preview. All Biden has to do is state the facts, and Donnie is toast.
Spoiler alert: he calls it for Biden! "He Predicted Trump’s Win in 2016. Now He’s Ready to Call 2020." Video with his 13 keys to predict presidential wins/losses. Go, Allan!
Biden's political instincts are so bad or just so finely tuned to what oligarchy wants.  I wouldnt vote for him to represent me in the best of times, let alone worst of times.
Trump surrogates keep talking about Biden's basement but it's clearly projection about the White House Hurt Feelings Wuss Bunker that the Tangerine Libertine hid in during the gentlest protests in US history
Biden is in some deep 💩 💩
The Ukraine has named Biden in their criminal case.  This could be our agents cooperating with their officials.
If Joe Biden won't debate can we watch Trump debate Kanye instead?
You know that Hunter Biden isn’t running for anything, right?
Wow #Biden jumped in this. Fabulous ad!!!
Girl, Joe Biden is running 8-13 points ahead of the Pussy Grabber in Thief. That's where he is. Got it?
If Biden wins in November, they stop immediately as he begins “the healing process” 😆. If Trump wins, they’ll be ratcheted up continuously for the next 4 years.
Serious question: are there actually people who would decide to vote for Kanye who currently plan to vote for Biden? I just don’t see that. Seems like he’d be more likely to siphon votes from Trump.
Democrat Party HQ doesn’t even have Biden’s name on display 🤣😂
Biden was one of the Dems I stated I'd vote for he were the nominee. His cognitive abilities seem to have declined significantly and his platform has been hijacked. I may take a chance that he's still a centrist (&amp; just lying to keep the socialist wing of the D party engaged).
Ugh she said “so conservative.” 🙄 I like her. She’s a great representative, works hard, and I think I’m progressive. But progressives need to appreciate pragmatic progress. Biden’s agenda is one a progressive should look forward to, as was HRC’s. It’s def not “conservative” wth

Pure political Kabuki... Meanwhile, Kashoggi and the Saudis, Erdogan and the Kurds, and Putin's bounties all go uninvestigated. Republican traitor scum.  Tensions flare as GOP's Biden probe ramps up
Trump's campaign ads are "THE RADICAL LEFT HAS TAKEN OVER JOE BIDEN AND AMERICA!!!1". The sort of hyperbolic projection we've come to be used to while he deploys troops to "declare victory" over his own constituents. This political polarization will end badly.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
I'm thinking there's a sizable group of dipshit libs and centrists that are only involved in the blm protests to the extent that it's a repudiation of trump. I won't be surprised if they start telling everyone to shut the fuck up after they get the keys to power when Biden wins.
If Joe Biden is elected, I have no doubt Christians will still be able to sing in our churches when it's safe to gather. But more of us will have access to healthcare, living wages, public education &amp; clean water. Which will be another reason to sing our praises to God.
I do know most of my twitter friends are dealing with loved ones who are Trump supporters. I am trying not to sit here crying about all my YAY BIDEN WEAR A PANTSUIT AND TAKE A DRONE PHOTO family members.
Biden accepted the debates over a month ago. Stop lying. Also, eat less, exercise more.
Joe Biden? Former VP Joe Biden?  Is he really different on whatever planet you're tweeting from?
Who’s #KarenBass? (not one of those Karens.)  Potential VP pick. I like ⁦ but if I had to settle, someone with a #healthcare background who’s known for working across the aisle would be OK.
Agreed. Although given the number of debates in Democratic primaries not sure Biden and exposure to live debates is an unknown. His debate performance ahead of South Carolina was one reason for momentum there.
ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST JILL BIDEN, WHY DID DANA PERINO OF FOX&amp;FRIENDS, HAVE BIDENS WIFE ON. SHE KNOWS SHE WILL LIE ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S MIND. HE WILL BE 4YRS OLDER THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP. BIDEN HAS MEDICAL PROBLEMS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT. THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM FOR BIDEN.
people are still using March’s talking points of “well we’ll all vote Green, that’ll show them!!1!1!1!!!!!” while 92% of non-Twitter Bernie people are already voting Biden.  It’s like...nobody cares.  nobody knows you exist.  this is unhealthy.  organize locally
Now do Biden Oh wait...Joe doesn’t do interviews without answers written down for him by his handlers
I see a Warren person right now claiming independent and soft Biden supporters preferring Warren is what matters most. 😑
Do you realize that Harris is at the top of polling on VP picks? And that most Dems want Biden to pick a Black woman?
Biden is kicking his ass right now. It just keeps getting better. You really have nothing do you? Not a single important issue to talk about.

Trump now encourages only citizens of Florida to vote by mail, hours after Politico published polls showing Trump’s attacks on mail-in voting are making only his voters, not Biden’s, more skeptical. Trump voters skew older and more vulnerable to Covid-19 fears on Election Day.
Opinion | Biden’s running mate matters. So does his Cabinet.
I'll step aside while you tilt and windmills on twitter, my man. I'm trying to dig it up, but somewhere in this thread I said I would vote for Biden.  But it's not something I do lightly, and it's even harder when people like you are out for a fight with anyone you disagree with
Well, Biden’s camp won’t have to spend any additional funds generating advertising content after that insane display. #AxiosOnHBO #ResignNowTrump
Facebook is stacked with ads from "Republican Voters Against Trump" featuring people explaining that they voted for him, but now they don't like him and they're voting for Biden. They're all white, mostly claim Christianity, and it's mostly his attitude/demeanor they object to.
Sanders acknowledged Sanders lost  Sanders endorsed Biden  Sanders encouraged his supporters to do the same  If you trust Sanders's judgment, then re-litigating the primary at this stage is a bit pointless
So what you are saying is that everyone in the country who won't vote for Biden for any reason is an idiot?
So if Biden wins, but I didn't vote, then I helped Biden win?
I generally do not support Gileadean policy, but maybe after Biden's inauguration, we can have one little particicution, as a treat.
I mean, literally this isn't the case.  Are people who would have voted Trump and are sitting out, or voting libertarian, defacto voting for Biden?  You have to assume that Biden gets everyones vote by default for that logic to work.
They won't pick Trump over Biden.  I know it's hip these days to say you support Trump if you don't vote for Biden, but that's never how elections have worked.  And yes, they would have voted for a progressive and not a moderate republican.  Not that weird
0%. The only ones who won't vote for Biden were never going to vote for any Dem who wasn't Bernie   Everyone else will crawl across crushed glass and hot coals to vote against Trump
It wasn't fully clear even after Super Tuesday, although it was a long shot. By then we had the Biden camp actively encouraging people to go to the polls during the pandemic. Sanders isn't perfect.  I will never forgive Biden for sending his voters out to die so he could win.
Well for starters, if he gets prosecuted under state law (which the state of NY was already doing), Biden can't do shit even if he wants to.  Second, he's gotten FDR delusions recently. I hope he's reading up on FDR's "Blame absolutely everything on Hoover" strategy.
He could say American died at all in his time as president and the moderators would go "Mr. Biden, your thoughts?"
Listened this morning and bought 14/1 on the VP announcement happening after the 17th. I like the theory that Biden’s going to announce it on the anniversary of the 19th Amendment...

Why Has Explicit Anti-Semitism At A UNC/Duke Conference About Gaza Been Ignored By The Media? ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ NC Jews are outraged Joe Biden would listen to Linda Sarsour’s lies. We have extended video.
I think he's more focused on his successful efforts to roll back Biden's 1994 crime bill, which incarcerated a generation of black males, and minority unemployment, which he helped reduce to the lowest level since tracking began.
Actually frankly 20% of the remainder act exactly the same except about "ridin' with biden" and being anti-GMO, so...
I don't have an absolute nope. I'm voting for Biden even if his running mate is a balloon with a face drawn on it in Sharpie.  But of the names being mentioned, Warren is by far the worst pick.
Trump outflanks Biden on left.  DHS/goons are sent in to guard polls.  Normal everyday voter suppression is turned up to 11.  USPS breaks early October.  White suburbs can vote easily, and scared of "antifa", they reelect Trump.  Trump pulls a Buttiegieg election night.
You think Democrats could have any humility and say the things they did during Obamas time were pretty bad and a lot of those policies lead us here.  Even having Biden apologize for being on the wrong side of history would go a long way.  But nope, vote shame is name of the game.
Like especially when they are very clewrly spitting in our faces.  The DNC/Biden campaign has a clear strategy to court neoconservative never trumpers, corporate lobbyists, lawyers, Wall St... And not a bit of good faith outreach to the left.
Wizard of oz circus shit going on.  Biden has told numerous people of you dont like Bidens policies to not vote for him.  So im not voting for him or Trump.
Tell Joe Biden: Make Abortion Access for All* A Top Priority
I'll add, in my personal opinion, that I think Biden wants to be seen as more independent of Obama. Choosing an Obama administration official as his highest-profile pick would make it seem like he's not capable of choosing his own people.
Oh no, it’s a planned scenario to get the vp in they really want as president. Biden said it would be a woman of color!
If I was Joe Biden...I wouldn't say a word... Four years of persistent incompetence has said enough

"If Biden wins he'll be dead before his term is up."
Oh they do have a trick up their sleeve. They hired 600 lawyers to gum up the elections results until Jan 20, 2021 at which time Pelosi becomes President if neither Trump or Biden have the advantage. Therefore Biden is merely a placeholder.
Biden is kicking your ASS right now. Why change? YOU'RE the one that need more debates, not Joe. You are truly desperate. You have nothing.
Biden should definitely not debate. Why bother? He’d spend the whole time refuting the lying freak show that is Trump.
On Zoom with the church's stockbroker (who is very good). He says we can expect an inflationary bull market with significant volatility over the next 12-18 months. Oh, and Wall Street is betting on a win for Biden in the general election.
Secret Service released Hunter Biden’s trips he took with security detail while his daddy was VP...he was busy 🧐
I mean they are gonna put her in as vp to brainless biden
I know that could be different this year. There's a much greater than normal chance that Biden goes 4 years and drops, meaning whomever is in the VP seat has a line to succeed him.  But it's not a given.
A record high for the Nasdaq ‘would all come crashing down,’ says Trump in a tweet, ‘including your jobs, stocks, and 401(k)s,’ if Biden wins presidency
The cheek caressing &amp; the touchy hugging of kids in that video make me so sick. I remember that feeling of wanting to scream but not knowing I could. It’s horrifying to watch.   I’ll crawl over broken glass to vote for Biden but I wish I didn’t have to.
Really? It’s already abundantly clear that Trump is completely unqualified, while Biden is a proven leader with a sound mind &amp; a good heart.
Biden won't debate. duh
i know March was a lifetime ago but the goldfish memory thing is still annoying. people said the same thing was going to happen with Biden's one-on-one debate with Sanders
uh yeah the ENTIRE WORLD knows Biden can't speak. LOL

Alright, just to be clear a lot of liberals who would never support positions AD holds were tweeting "What does Angela David know that you don't?" When she publicly endorsed Biden. Fine. This has nothing to do with what she thinks about Avakian or Maoism, it is ab the libs.

Just realized that Biden still has to do debates this fall, and suddenly I don't feel he can amass a polling lead large enough to make me comfortable
Well, I think you might be giving the other side too much credit here. The issue with Biden is not simply that he is not a "perfect" candidate.
Just about everything I've seen for Biden has been 'Not Trump'.  It's enough to get my one vote, but not much else.  Here's a look at Biden's current proposals and...this is actually not a bad look for him.

Good to know they exist. But I've started having this discussion with various friends around the country. Everybody has seen lots of Trump signs, but when asked, people struggle to recall seeing any Biden signs or materials.
Biden needs to renew the call for disclosure of Trump's taxes  now that Rudy has advised us the audit is over. No debates until he produces taxes.
say what you will, the democratic primary did a great job of making sure that no one could possibly believe the attack line that joe biden is a tool of the radical left. this line of attack is doa.
I don’t understand the strategy behind painting Joe Biden - Joe. Biden. - as some kind of radical leftist. I don’t know if anyone other than the cultiest of the Trump cultists who will buy this. Joe has been a defined national figure for 40 years. This won’t work.
NPR just reported on an Ohio poll that shows Biden up only 46-42. We have the electoral college.
they would say Biden is up in the polls, as intended
Yeah, funny how Biden supporters don’t stand in large gatherings on roads and highways. Must have something to do with IQ?
Well, at least there are Trump signs around. I live in a very blue part of a swing state, and I've yet to see a single Biden sign, bumper sticker, or any other campaign paraphernalia. We do get slick, substance-free TV ads about how Biden is nicer than Trump.
Apparently to some Biden voters, wanting M4A during a global pandemic is selfish.   Wanting a livable planet for future generstions and plants and animals is selfish.   Wanting UBI so that people can be sheltered and eat is selfish.  Good voter outreach.
"I'm going to vote Biden-Harris, but if he picks Bass, I'm voting Trump"?  Obama announced Biden on August *23*.  FOCUS, PEOPLE.
If Id get arrested under a Biden regime whats the difference?  American electoral politics dont work.  We live in an oligarchy, what the elite need gets first, second, third priorities.
They already know that Obama knew about the surveillance, who was in that meeting and that Biden was the one that planted the idea of charges for Flynn.  All they are going to corroborate, to have it on record.  Yes, i think she will answer those questions.
It's flat dumb.  I know we are all locked down, but for gods sake, write about Trump's crimes.  Obama announced Biden as VP on AUGUST *23*.  Which is 3 weeks from now.
If monthly premiums are $1200 for a family and there is no work and housing is $1000 and food is $500 and I only got a $1200 check one time...  It doesnt matter who I vote for if I am dead next month.  Reality...  Neither Trump or Biden will act quickly and decisevely enough.
Alot of people will have the privielge and lotto luck of their birth, to go right back to sleep in a Biden presidency.  I hope to never be blind to the injustices all around me; by my country and those that rule it against, all peoples.  "While there is a lower class, I am in it"
For me the outcomes of a Biden or Trump presidency are minimal.  Children will still be in cages. The climate crisis will get worse. Close to 25% of the pop cant afford decent housing Affordable care act is and was forever a joke. Fascists have been in police forever.
We dont live in a binary world and saying, repeatedly, our choise is between Biden or Trump, negates centuries of international revolutionary liberation politics authored by black, brown, and poor people.  We dont have to accept elite control.  Biden offers nothing but status quo
No its not. Trying to force people to accept the binary status quo, Biden or Trump, is statist propaganda.  Its not a choice if the elite chose who we get the "privilege" of electing.  Biden is not the savior of the Republic. The people, organized, will determine our fates.
Center for Marketing and Opinion Research has Biden +4 in Ohio. (Disclosure: I worked for CMOR as a high school/college student in the summers of 08/09.)
Biden is part of the Washington swamp.  He funneled billions of dollars from China into Rosemont Capital in 2012/14.  Rosemont Capital is owned by Hunter Biden and Christopher Heinz.  Christopher Heinz is John Kerry's stepson.
All lawful Americans should own guns and have one available in every room of the house. One in every car. Do not allow yourself, grandparents, parents, children and grandchildren to be victimized in Biden’s America under more false narratives.
I can barely wait for Biden's inauguration. POTUS is a job for a grownup and you, sir, are the oldest 5-year-old ever.
Bernie is now imploring people to vote for Biden.  And Bernie makes a very important point in this video: he will at least have a chance to cooperate with the Biden administration.  But if Trump wins, any chance for progressive policy vanishes.
I'm not as worried as some people are. I think Biden is smart enough to make the right choice.
Isn’t Biden at least a step in the right direction, though? Won’t four years of Biden do more to accomplish the goals of progressives than four more years of Trump?
I said weeks ago. Biden will withdraw. An emergency candidate will be chosen. Guess who.
It will be at least a month after Biden gets the national mask and social distance campaign established.
Hillary is up. Biden is not going to be the nominee.
I agree w/ President Obama, statehood is the right answer IMO. I know some prominent advocates for PR statehood are supporting Biden FWIW. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Looks like this op-ed from last year is the best encapsulation of his publicly-started position (key quote on the future status of PR screenshotted below):

Weird that Trump is giving such solid reasons to vote for Biden, but I’ll take it.
Oddly enough, Deshanko (Ukraine provided dossier) has to be tied to Soros as well, he worked with the Think Tank.  Which means, Biden is all over this too.  We may not have an election this year!!
Sally Yates goes before the Senate Judiciary Com. 8/5.  Biden appears to be the one that planted the idea of the Logan Act against Flynn.  Igor Deshanko (Ukrainian) worked at Brookings and has strong ties with Fiona Hill.  Mr. VP, you are in trouble...
Debating 45 would be useless. He lies and projects his own defiencies on others. Trump is mentally deranged. I hope Biden declines a debate. It would be a waste of all our time.
Andrew, do you not see the obvious cognitive issues with Joe Biden? The man cannot formulate a sentence; he can no longer reason and think on the fly. We all know he is a pawn in the hands of the Democratic Party system. The last place Joe Biden wants to be is on a debate stage.
I liked this because I like Warren, not because I like the prospect of Biden dying. That would be a terrible thing to happen, not only for him, but also for the Democratic party.

I’m not sure what you’re getting at. Just defending Biden? He put out a plan to achieve racial equity that will not. That’s my only point. I didn’t argue that his proposals will do damage apart from producing an illusion of “progress.” Very Obama-like.
If this wasn't a staged, wouldn't  the Biden supporters be wearing masks?
You people are hilarious. Too many people show up, it's egregious and irresponsible. Too few show up, he's losing supporters. Where's the pics of Biden supporters? Oh wait, he's not allowing cameras in his basement, is he?
So afraid there's a good possibility Trump will actually lose. You're also angry seeing all those posts about Biden winning you're lashing back with nonsense like this one.  Good job at deluding yourself so HARD. 👌
. looks at how #NorthCarolina is a toss up state this  #2020Election. Frustration with #COVID19 &amp; college grads in metro areas trending toward a dem vote are 2 factors that show Biden has the edge as 48% of NC voters support Biden in the poll and 44% support Trump
Better Biden deal with the attacks when he did than have to do it now. I'm not even going to try to suggest to him what he should do--- he was a VP with an excellent example of a president to work with, so he should have ideas of who he wants. I'm happy with 4-5 of the candidates
It really says a lot about the two-party system when Republicans want us to vote for Joe Biden. The truth is Republicans and Democrats are really much more similar than they ever wanted us to believe. #NoMoreTrump #NeverBiden #VoteGreen #RideTheGreenWave
We both will vote for Biden
"The 2017 tax reform law dropped the corporate income rate from 35% to 21%. Biden wants to raise the rate to 28%. He has also called for a 15% minimum tax on large corporations."
Thanks--never seen that. She is so extreme, look what the stodgy tax folks say about Biden's tax plans.
I discuss the impracticality of Biden's claim that the Fed's traditional monetary policy instruments can have an effect on the black-white unemployment ratio in this  article by Danielle Kurtzleben
I think it’s more that he hated Hillary and is, in his heart, a misogynist. He wouldn’t be so moved to be a team player were this Hillary again in Biden’s place.
On FB I posted the meme of Biden and they declared it false...so I then posted the pic of Warren...it was NOT declared false  🤣😂🤣
I mean Biden himself, mainly. Some potential VPs could counteract that, some could reinforce it. I'm not thinking that much about particular candidates because I find it hard to care about Democrats after being told my ideas and issues don't matter for the last 30 years.
Given her finish behind Biden, Sanders, and arguably Mayor Pete and Klobuchar, too, what makes you conclude that Warren is "the best campaigner"?
SHAME  Mr Biden You Are Telling Outright Falsehoods On TV Never In History Have I Seen Such Bigotry Hatred Lies Come From Democrats Dailey for 3 years your party has Attacked millions YOU HAVE LOST HISPANIC. VOTE TRUMP 202O
I’ll bet you a flat $10.00 that Biden wins North Carolina. He will outperform them because the GOP base has dwindled to uneducated white voters in rural areas.
if electoral politics worked we would have fixed or mitigated climate crisis over the last few decades  the fact that we have accelerated CO2 emissions, and Biden cant stand by 3 of the most popular policy positions, #M4A, #GreenNewDeal and legalization is a huge problem
I’m really doing a spoken word AND miming for The Joe Biden Campaign’s Gospel Concert tonight and man I’m still in disbelief🤧  God went crazy on this one!   People like Common and John Legend will be watching tonight 🤯  Your gift will literally—— man‼️
I don’t think anybody wins North Carolina by 17 points but I do believe Joe Biden would win handily if the election were today. The rapid GOP collapse in the suburbs is one of the more remarkable trends I’ve seen in politics.
This isn’t the slightest shred of truth in this statement. It’s just plain silly. As if Biden were some unknown character.
What's the point of debates? We're all just going to vote for the dude we think is the least senile right? Unless these debates are formatted as head-to-head "Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV" dungeon fights to the death, let's skip them.
That's what I was gonna say, it looks like if you include the Biden + Richardson numbers it would add up. I bet that's a first ballot or something.
Also there are Biden stickers everywhere on the east coast.
That’s exactly what we plan to do by replacing you with Joe Biden.  You are the worst president ever.  Even the republicans don’t want you any more.

The Durham-Barr Origin of Russia investigation has a pre-determined outcome. Barr travelled with Durham to Australia, UK, Ukraine, US states and other places to support the following: that Comey, McCabe, Strozk, Page, Brennan, Clapper, Biden, Obama and maybe Rice and Yates guilty
Susan Rice... absolutely not. Elizabeth Warren would honestly raise the most money for Biden, but yea. Karen Bass doesn't have the name recognition. You all and the Russians already dragged Kamala so there's no additional dirt to bring to hurt her. Demings and Bottoms 🤷🏿‍♂️.
Yes Donnie, if someone hadn't given all his rich buddies and himself a tax cut then Biden wouldn't have to raise taxes. You sound like a 3 year old.  Please get out of the way and let the adults govern.
Yet Trumpers want to make you think it’s the DEMS who are the racists.  I’d bet my house this cat ain’t voting for Biden?  Any takers?
Repeat after me: Biden is a Tool
I’m still looking for Biden to swing it. But I expect Biden to win an old school landslide like we haven’t seen in this century. 🤞
Listen, Im going to vote for Biden. But it’s a real “fuck you” to everyone who’s passionate about a younger, more engergized candidate for this to be the primary narrative of the campaign. I’m worried that “trump bad, me good” won’t motivate enough turnout from my generation
If you don't vote for Biden, Trump will win. That's just a fact. #Election2020
Way less than now if Biden gets elected.
This post brings up an excellent point: Zombie Joe Biden would be a MUCH cooler candidate
I detest the two-party system and Biden as much as most, but the GOP is irredeemable. It's unhinged patriarchy.
Compared to what Biden has proposed, trump’s policies do defund the police.
Exactly. A lot of them don't care if Biden wins. They have their sights set on 2024, and to hell with what happens to our country in the meantime.   But they want to be able to say they supported a Black woman so they can tell themselves they're not engaging in misogynoir.
It really is like he's trying to hypnotize the country into believing that the past 4 years were some kind of extended Obama/Biden administration. (Of course, the gains in the economy before the pandemic basically were)
Maybe the delay is because Biden’s trying to talk Kamala into being his first SCOTUS pick, and she’s weighing her options. 😂  And that’s why Clyburn’s suddenly all “SCOTUS is more important than VP...”  *Yes. I am bored. I do not think any of this is true.
Joe... You had 54 years.  All you did was get rich.  Let's see Hunter Biden's tax records.
Biden is the nominee.  He should choose his VP, not Sanders or Sanders’ adherents.
As a 10yo boy, Shirley Chisholm spoke to my public school district  about racism. Me: Ms Chisholm, do you think racism will end in my lifetime? SC: Honey, I hope so... Its time to do the hard work to make this happen.
It's just not as much fun campaigning against Biden as it was against Hillary. He hasn't had fun since election night November 2016, except maybe when he was behind the steering wheel in that big truck
It doesn't, but it gives them a very distinct advantage, especially in this instance. If Biden has a successful term, it'll be very difficult to defeat his VP. Choosing someone who doesn't want to run would be sacrificing a key advantage in a critical election. Why would he?
True conservatives will vote for Biden. I look forward to real political election in 2024🇺🇸
Biden is the “Anyone but Trump” candidate.
We're not fooled by the leftist white supremacists who are naming as acceptable running mates Black women who, even if they were chosen and were able to help Biden win this year's election, wouldn't be likely to run for the presidency in 2024. We see you.
There are plenty of reasons to oppose Kamala, but shading her for being ambitious is ... y’all realize Biden’s been running for President since the Reagan administration?
And in order to do this easily, just imagine YOU are Biden's pick and that write a tweet with that sensitivity.
I can't wait until the conventions are over so we can finally be done with the following theories that never made sense to begin with: 1) Biden will be replaced as nominee 2) Biden will choose Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama as running mate 3) Pence will be replaced as VP
Oh blimey. Hope it’s a Biden landslide, might discourage a challenge!
I like this shirt because it's a reminder that Harris is proven in the crucial "attack dog" role of the running mate. Most of the other names being mentioned are at best untested.  That role might be more important than ever with Biden leading the ticket.
Nah, I'll vote for the fascist if Biden doesn't debate 🙄
There are exactly 2 running mate picks Biden could make that would make sense at all: Kamala Harris and Susan Rice.  Of the two, Harris is the better pick for VP.  Rice would be ideal for Secretary of State.  #KamalaHarrisForVP #SusanRiceForSecState  But no matter what happens...
Greetings VP Biden!  I, together with countless millions believe in you; trust you to put the White House train wreck back on track..."We are with you Joe!"  HINT: Senator Kamala Harris would make an excellent running mate.  Like you, she speaks for all of us.

Lots of other older people chiming in, saying they love Biden because he lost his wife and his “beautiful son.” Something about Biden resonates with older Americans more than it did with Hillary or other candidates. I think maybe because they observed his grief so many times.
I'm not saying it's unprecedented. I'm saying Biden won't do it.
Hey Joe Biden that was a great commercial you did for Muslim Americans.  🙋‍♂️But...ummm....I have a question. Why didn't you ask about Christian views or say your administration will have a "voice" for Christians?  #Pandering #Hypocrisy
Saturday morning politics take: Whoever leaked the story about the old guys on the Biden VP team criticizing Kamala Harris for being good at politics might have guaranteed her selection as VP.
Biden should sit this one out. You can’t debate a name calling, adolescent, narcissist.
Any official that will decide a mail in vote is needed should be charged with malfeasance in office. Too may people, directions and hands between your vote and the ballot box. It will be compromised. An Auto Vote  for Biden is a sure thing.  Damn, You voted democrat. This Sucks!
True, vote Biden
No, they're fine with old white guys like Biden. But yes, fear of blacks and women in the nation's highest office was a big part of why insecure white men love Trump.
Why Biden’s VP pick will matter so much -  -
... oh, but Hunter Biden!!!!
She may be our next President after Biden!  Love her!
Biden is never going to debate, be interviewed or allow questions at press conferences. He is running on the “I’m not Trump” platform.

Either way, at the end I did enjoy, "After hearing all of this information about Joe Biden, how likely are you to vote for President Trump?"  Me: Extremely not likely at all.
The survey was administrated by Dynata (who could be collecting data for GOP for marketing purposes?) It was just odd to have questions be like, "Joe Biden has been in Washington for 47 yrs and has done nothing. Do you think he would be a good leader?" Lots of leading questions.

Sometimes the right choice is the hardest choice: Joe Biden should drop out of the election. What comes next? No clue but we should have figured this out in February. And yes, same sentiments to 45.

There is basically a whole subgenre on both Twitter and YouTube of former MAGA people who got royally fucked by Trump and have since vowed to vote for Biden, but I'm happy to let Trumpers believe this and then watch them cry in November.
Lots of Biden signs in my neighborhood. 🤷🏻‍♀️
He'll announce on November 1st that the vaccine is complete and ready to go but won't be released if Biden becomes president. Yes, he will pull that stunt.
Ah yes, well-known devout Catholic Joe Biden wants to hurt God, that tracks
BIDEN RACIST CONFIRMED
Joe Biden is the gift that keeps on giving.  He wants ur vote, but visualizes African Americans as the bottom of working class. He makes November simple.
In my entire life, there has not been a single moment in which the best candidate for Latinos and Black people wasn't a Democrat. Even Clinton. Even Biden. I don't disagree with the message here, but if non-Democrats want those votes they should run good candidates. They don't.
He’s only on the ballot to take votes from Biden
Does anyone actually believe this? I know most of us have resigned to the reality that we're probably gonna vote for Biden, but come on, we can be honest here. Does anyone actually believe that literally any important Democrat knows Latin America?
I say this as an extremely unhappy Biden voter: Biden does not know Latin America. Neither did Obama. No one whose analysis is worth taking seriously would look at Obama's administration and say that he knew Latin America. And Obama is infinitely smarter than Biden.
They’ll have to muzzle Biden soon!! No way he debates Trump!!
Many politicians, like Joe Biden, make statements like this because they only come around during election time. For those who are concerned about making an difference and are continuously involved, we know Biden’s statement are simply not true. #ncpol
A Gaff A Day Keeps The Biden Away! Wow.
OH SNAP! ‘Why the hell would I take a test?’: Biden pushes back on cognitive test question
There must always be some sort of cosmic balance. Joe Biden says something incredibly offensive &amp; utterly inane, even by his own comically low standards, and the NY AG moves to dissolve the NRA. A horrific yet beautiful balance.
I saw someone ask yesterday “idk how people can say voting for Biden is just as bad as voting for Trump”   Me: I mean well...  Biden:
Trump:  "We Caught Obama and Biden Spying, It's Breathtaking What They Found!"
Latinos and African Americans not only share a history in this country, but are also both remarkably complex groups, and they have another important unifier: Biden has never, ever, in his entire, pathetic life, given a single fuck about either group. I am filled with rage.
Fake News the Hatch act prevents the Postal Service from endorsing a political candidate. Postal unions can &amp; most did endorse Biden. Funny thing is somehow the new PMG is a big Trump supporter and contributer? PMG appointment's aren't chosen by the POTUS? Hmm
It is rare for me to legitimately feel angry on Twitter but I can FEEL this seeping into my soul. I actually think I need to log off of this site to recover from the anger I feel right now. Jesus fucking Christ, fuck Biden.

Imagine if Biden was actually this cool. Leftists can only dream, tragically.
Trump said Wednesday he's considering giving his Aug. 27 acceptance speech on the grounds of the White House instead of in North Carolina, a move that could violate ethics law.

Why did the Democrats and Biden call Trump a racist and xenophobe for stopping travel to and from China? Then said he didn't act soon enough after they realized he was right.
For one it flies in the face of the promised tax hikes by democrats and the Biden campaign, and because of that you won't see the Democrat controlled House bring anything like that forward for a vote before the election.
This is so 2016 rhetoric; "the best of two evils". Please. Biden is fine and a good candidate for this moment we are in now.

Definitely not okay what Biden said, but I do scratch my head when I see a person of color supporting Trump. Same for a woman. Or any minority. Or anyone in the LGBTQ community. Or anyone with a college diploma.
Same old story.#FDR after Hoover, Clinton after Reagan After Bush #1, Obama after W, and Biden after Trump! Just to name a few.
Biden just lost
The vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that's more attuned to gender and racial biases.

Chicken shit brainless Biden.
I will be surprised if any debates take place.  The democrats are already floating lots of reasons to eliminate them.  Biden is unable to answer questions unless the answers are written down for him to read.

If by some miracle Biden should win, his handlers will have to show him where to report to work. The poor man can’t complete a sentence, it’s embarrassing he’s in the race for the presidency. The guy is a tool for left-wing socialist.
I am not sure Joe Biden knows where he is!
Joe wants to be a transitional figure, but only in terms of party leadership. A Biden presidency will not address the systemic issues that facilitated Trump's rise to power. My bigger concern is that a more competent fascist will represent the GOP in 2024 and will probably win.
Last point: if Biden loses, which at present is incredibly unlikely, Obama should be blamed. During his tenure in office he hemorrhaged almost 1000 state legislature seats which gave Republicans the tools needed to manipulate election results for the foreseeable future.

Joe Biden is not smart enough to conduct a campaign. He is operating as a mouthpiece for the liberal left. I doubt even he thinks he could finish four years in office if there was a miracle in his favor and he won.The Biden campaign is the lefts move towards socialism
I think he’s talking about taking it back from incompetent liberal mayors,governors and members of Congress.We are trying to make America great again after the Obamas and Biden’s almost destroyed our culture and our country. The president can get it all done.

One of the things about the #Biden2020 campaign that I actually find healthy is that it seems so few people “worship” Biden as someone who will save us. Our past political figures (R &amp; D) have become such obsessions. People want him to win, but it’s not necessarily about HIM.

Adam you can’t legitimately think Biden is a viable candidate.  The Dems had a great chance to win and they fumbled the ball big time.

Hells yes Biden is a fool if he debates Trump. It would just give the idiot more free TV time.
According 2 your focus groups about 1/3 of Obama-Trump Voters plan 2 vote 4 Biden. If this is correct Biden wins in a landslide. If this # is actually 20%, Biden wins in a landslide. Even 5% same landslide. #2020Election #Biden #Trump
I would vote for Joe Biden even if he picked Elon as VP.
A friend said she's voting for Joe Biden, but it's funny that he's ducking the spotlight  I told her, no ma'am. Biden recently gave 3 major speeches on his economic plan, including:  1. Infrastructure 2. Climate Change 3. Healthcare / childcare

Best Argument for Biden? Sure.
Tim Kaine was named  VP July 22nd the convention was July 27th  Biden was announced VP August 22nd, the DNC was Aug 27th  Gore was announced VP July 9th. The 1992 convention was July 13th.  Liberman announced Aug 7th and the DNC was Aug. 14th  Why are people complaining?
Even if Trump doesn't accept the results of the Election he won't be President on January 21st 2021! The Military FBI and other Government Agencies won't take any orders from him as he will no longer be Commander and Chief when Biden takes Office! 20th Amendment!
Vice President Joe Bidens Donors are trying to torpedo Senator Karma Harris because she stood up to Biden on the Debate! Hell that's what We want! Not a Yes Vice President! Harris will make Trump and McConnell Nervous! Susan Rices son is going to vote for Trump! Never heard Bass!

This tweet is about Joe Biden. Who'd a guessed?!
Biden team has backed themselves in a corner by saying he would pick a woman and now all expectations are a black woman.  His list comes with a ton of baggage.  Can't wait!
Nope. You lost to HRC by 3M. Biden will beat you by 6M and will get 350+ Electoral College votes. #PutinsGOP

Joe Biden doesn't strike me as a man who lets external forces like these sway him easily
He doesn’t have to nor should he support an organization and movement that hates heterosexual black men! You must be kin to Joe Biden trying to question a black man about his blackness.
Bass and Rice are non starters for Vice President Joe Biden VP Pick! If Senator Karma Harris goes after Trump and Pence like she did to Vice President Joe Biden in debating they have a Winning Team! Dodd and other Biden Supporters and Donors are trying to torpedo Harris!
I can't wait either,  they will need to check Biden for an ear piece

Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Then I conclude you either 1) Don't know what a "hawk" is, or 2) Don't want to publicly list the countries that need intervention. This isn't a trick question. You said Biden "hopefully" picks a hawk. Peak neolib. Maybe the mask slipped.
Nothing they say surprise me they own Joe Biden they own the DNC!
You said you hope he gets a hawk, someone who is pro-intervention. My question is not stupid. By hoping for a hawk, you are hoping for intervention. So you do or don't have a few countries that need some of Biden's freedom? Or is this my 8th question you refuse to answer?
Biden's gotta git gud but it's not off the table. If he gets Tulsi for VP it's a done deal.
More examples. What am I wrong about? All the kids he grabs are the children of Republicans. Is this behavior normal to you? How would you feel if it was Trump doing this instead of Biden?
montage from Media Matters of on-air personalities taking Biden to task for (now rightfully) suggesting Trump would try and find a way to delay the election.
Yea I'm ignoring "Never Biden" Democrats really not worth taking seriously right now
They probably believe in harm reduction (which I disagree with) but I'm not going to shame them for it. While I won't vote for Biden since he's effectively a 90s Republican, I'm not going to shame the anyone but Trump crowd.
So Biden isn't picking Kamala as VP¿? Bad.

CNN keep showing your “polls” that show Biden leading, and Trump falling. Didn’t work in 2016 but keep trying!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Trump 2020
No! It must sting to be still defending racist Joe Biden
He's a Devil he called Obama a racial slur , his wife called Blackman Superpredators and her and Joe Biden said Blackmen should be rid from society , 1994 Crime Bill destroyed so many lives I felt that fire, Bill Clinton said no to Farrakhan get money from Khadifi
With Valerie Jarrett helming the Zoom call, it really does feel like Biden is running for Obama's third term.  #Election2020 #Biden
That’s strange. Just got a fundraising email from Biden that says he and *Elizabeth Warren* will win back the White House this fall. I must be reading this wrong...

Pence &gt; Trump &gt; Biden
REPUNLICANS MUST RE-ELECT DJT.   WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE AFFH OR BIDEN OR PELOSI OR ANY SCUMBORAT

I’m ready for Biden/Duckworth 2020. She’s the perfect VP choice. We will see when he announces. #ElectionTwitter
Poll: Biden leads Trump by 4 points in Florida
Harris and Warren were my top two. Harris dropped out early so I voted Warren even though I knew Biden would win NC pretty easily. But yea Biden 100%
The Election will be held on time and if Vice President Joe Biden Defeats Trump won't have any Power and Federal Agents will Remove Him from Office if Trump fails to Comply! Mail in Ballots are very Safe! Trump and some of his Administration voted by mail! Ivanka Trump!

go watch the videos of Joe Biden touching on children IN THE WHITE HOUSE..the democratic party has committed fraud against the Negro people
you sound just like Biden “you’re not black if you don’t vote for me”, the democratic party literally created the KKK, Joe played a huge role in the 90s crime bill that led to more mass incarceration, you haven’t looked at Trump’s policies that have benefited the Negro..REsearch
That’s because no matter what we are voting JOE BIDEN 2020
You know if Joe Biden Defeats Trump and Trump refuses to leave Office he has no Power and Federal Agents will escort him from the White House! Or maybe Trump will get a Majic Bullet like JFK.
Only Congress can change an Election Date! Not Barr! Not Trump! Even if Trump tried to stay on January 21st 2021 he wouldn't have any Power as the new incoming President Joe Biden!
Fact!!!  He and Biden should get adjoining rooms at the Nursing Home !!!
actually look at the things trump has done w his policies compared to obama’s administration for the Negro people. If anything Joe Biden is more “racist” he played a huge role in the 90s crime bill...this is America you know how many “racist” presidents there has been?😂
Straight, white men are a trip sometimes y’all. Imagine being so privileged that your American experience allows you to view Biden’s election is the end of the nightmare and not just a transition to a new, slightly less shitty phase of the nightmare.
The 20th Amendment! If Joe Biden Defeats Trump whether he tries to stay as President he won't have any Power! Your Times Up! You better go on your own!
Even if Trump could Cancel the Election if Vice President Joe Biden Defeats Trump and Pence would not have any Power! Only Congress can change an Election which Nancy Polosi won't do! Trump should leave Office Politiy like Obama or be escorted out by Federal Agents!
every state elects their own personal imbecile,here in Ohio we have several with Jim Jordan at the top!All the real Republicans that wouldn't accept a lying racist sexual predator who is clearly in debt to Russia need to win as many votes as possible for Biden
Trump can't Cancel the Election! Because of the Corona Virus, a War or any other reason! If Vice President Joe Biden Defeats Trump will have to leave Office January 21st 2021!
You mean what is happening NOW under the current president who is actually not Biden?  What are you smoking?
What are the odds that he loses, refuses to concede, the incoming Biden Admin negotiates a deal in which he is not prosecuted by DOJ if he agrees to leave.   I think that's all he cares about. On the upside he'd probably sell everyone out, up to &amp; including his kids, to do it.

Trump is trying to Distract from the 150 Thousand Corona Virus Deaths by saying Joe Biden wants to Defund Police! When Biden just wants to Ban Choke Holds! Trump's trying to scare Seniors! Do Not be Fooled!!!!
He was one senator.  You people pretending that biden was some kind of god who could pass laws is stupid.
Senator Karma Harris will beat Trump and Pence like a Red Headed Step Child the way she debated Vice President Joe Biden just shows how Tough she is! Warren and Others are good Candidates, but Our African American Friends won't support a White Woman!!!
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, have very different plans for the next four years.
Quote from Biden yesterday “We’ll take truth over facts!”😂😂😂😂 He must have flunked every English class he took. I actually feel sorry for him and all of you ought to charge of elderly abuse
Ms. Hill; Harris is NOT the pick. Biden selects her.....black folk gonna be in trouble. Research Harris' background and history; read what your responders and followers are saying. Harris is bad news
Ask Biden how to spell it..😝🙃
That’s a lame argument. Nice attempt at laying all the ‘COVID deaths’ at Trumps feet. Typical lefty deflection. Rice is a proven hack and Pence will mop the floor with anyone that Biden..errr the DNC picks as VP, just as Trump will demolish Sloe Biden in the debates.
BLM Gives Their Donations To White Men - Joe Biden  via  WHITE BLM/ANTIFA!
I think you need to get your facts straight,Obama/Biden set race relations back 100 years . Joe Biden is not capable of completing a sentence without his handler’s . The thugs in the streets of major cities looting burning and destroying private property is the Obama legacy.
Biden should find new allies.
Considering Biden himself has said he’ll be a one-term President, shouldn’t he *want* a veep who’s ready to take the reins in 2024?
I choose Trump over Biden!
Any of them have their positives and negatives. Biden needs someone who is comfortable working with and can trust to push back on him when needed. I will be okay with any of them but hope it isn't Warren. She needs a bigger economic role.
If the man would quit tweeting he would be fine...... Don't worry in Nov you will be relected just said people hate Trump so much they willing to vote for Joe biden. I want to see the debate between them Joe Biden can't make a sentence oh dumbass....
Joe Biden is a KKK member &amp; is responsible for mass incarceration AND student debt being the way it is😤

Election 2020 live updates: Trump, Biden spar over coronavirus, religion, race  - WaPo
Yeah, Trump the great religious leader &amp; worshipper of only himself, can't name one Bible verse, uses tear gas on Episcople Priests so he can get a film op holding the BIble upside down says Biden is against God?? This from someone who thinks there are 2 Corinthians. #TrumpVirus
Also, the same reason why he was humbled by the President by awarding the highest civilian award. The presidential medal of freedom  Watch to ur hearts content! It is very easy to find many reasons for y Biden is qualified to be President!
I'm still, and probably always will be, annoyed  everyone who chose Biden as our nominee
Biden just called back ppl the N word and told black ppl they all think alike....nice try though
Trump, Biden, and Obama are terrible. But, Obama kept those kids in there for 72 hours before they were taken out. Trump has kept them in there for days, weeks, months, possibly years. But you don’t care abt them at all. Like I said, you’re using them to prove a point.
I’m not trying to prove my point. I’m trying to make you understand that cops killing one’s bad too, but you bring up strawman arguements that I had to debunk. I know Obama and Biden put kids in cages, but you shouldn’t be saying “They did it first!! 😧☝🏽”. That’s hella childish.
Wow. Biden couldn't have made a better choice. He's been a bit behind on Latino outreach, but this shows he's upping his game.
If you think you might not vote for Biden because you don't *love* his running mate, I suggest you think for a moment about how HORRIBLE pence is
Dont get it twisted. I fckn hate Trump and I will be voting for Biden. I'm not especially happy about it but I'd rather jump from the burning skyscraper than stay and burn to death.

Biden is nuts🐿

For those who have forgtten.....#donald already declared himself to be God so maybe there is truth to his statement.  #Biden will hurt him.
I think we all know which ballots weren't counted.  Biden had less than $1mil in his campaign coffers, had not campaigned or even opened an office in any of the Super Tuesday States.  Do I believe SC was the spark that created an immediate monumental shift in the Dem race?  NFW.
Because you could say you were going to give me $1 million dollars and I’d still vote for Biden. There is literally nothing you could say ever that would make me vote for you.
Choosing to not take an action (voting for Biden) is actually taking an action so......
I'm also not a believer in the Great Man model of leadership. I don't think one person can 'save' a country.   I'm not supporting Biden because I think he's awesome.   I'm supporting him because I think he'll bring professionals and experts back to do the work we need done.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee  attempted late Thursday to walk back remarks he made favorably comparing the diversity of the Latino community to that of the Black community.
Not that I was expecting you to understand this, but he’s talking about taking away our 1A &amp; 2A rights. And if you don’t think that’s happening, go check out Seattle and Portland. That’s what we’ll get if Biden is elected. Plus, Biden will give all his pedo friends a pass.
If Joe Biden doesn’t choose Kamala Harris as his running mate, I’m gonna be so upset that I’ll cast my vote for him anyway.
Jesus is risen from the dead. Joe Biden can’t hurt Him.

A devout Catholic, Joe Biden's very open about his faith. The President is less open about his. Luckily, in America, we don't have a litmus test requiring candidates be of a certain faith. But it's odd Trump would pick this fight. #WakeUpCLT

There is a big difference between a Gaffe and outright racism. What Biden is famous for apart from other good stuff is his gaffe. What Trump is famous for other than his lies and corruption is his racism &amp; his 100 word vocabulary! Huge difference!

I agree 💯 But #kayleighmcenany refers to the repeated oft derogatory off-script remarks Biden keeps saying about blacks &amp; the utter hypocrisy when he advocates intensely for Obama’s #BLM, &amp; other blacks , in no way disparaging the Latino community. Disgusting is Biden’s racism.
Fool! He won’t be acting as president! Obama &amp; Hillary will, with Biden sound asleep on their futton!
NO! Black people do not think alike. Many younger blacks (under30) think Biden’s racist &amp; many of the unfortunate whose lives &amp; businesses utterly destroyed  will never support him also!  Plus many affluent blacks (those that see Biden as he is) know they are hated also by Obama.
Are you agreeing with Biden black people can’t think for themselves then?
How do you explain joe biden saying he was against desegregation because it would turn schools into jungles if blanks were allowedin white schools?
My vote for Biden was set on November 4th 2016! We had enuf evidence of what to come from a Trump WH even before the casting of the first mail-in ballot in 2016!  Really a VP pick is make or break for voting for BIDEN?
Idioto! U &amp; many others have been spreading this half truth for far too long. The whole truth is that he was showing support to a senator who gave up &amp; denounced KKK for 53 years before that photo was taken with Biden! There r many such KKK converts who gave up old ways!!

I see many voters sitting this 1 out. Biden’s whole campaign is “ I’m not Trump! “ Biden turns 78 in Nov. I wouldn’t want a 78 yr. old driving me in a car, much less running the country! There will be backlash, but Dems need to blame themselves! They had 4 years to groom a champ!
DONY  WORRY, she won’t be VP. ITLL BE SUSAN RICE! Obama, who will be running country again (Biden napping) needs her extensive past experience to coalesces FBI CIA NSA JUSTICE &amp; HOMELAND with one agenda. Spy, terrorize &amp; persecute even more as he seeks REVENGE.

I don’t think that’s what’s happening but your entitled to your stance. I’m just not a fan of white nationalist heroes as senior White House advisors. Regardless of what I think of Biden, he’s not allowing people are worshipped by white nationalist into his administration.

What has Biden accomplished in 44 years?
No in 2022 we make our move to takeover the party by uniting the lost tribes of black America to keep the house and move to 60 senators. Then Biden replacement pass reparations
It would be an interesting poll. Speaking only for myself, a Warren pick would make me reconsider not voting for Trump. None of the other candidates would do that, and Biden isn't going to pick someone who makes me want to vote D so I guess it's LP or write-in.
Did anybody else have older black people say “Bill Clinton, was our first black president?” I’m gonna take a guess and say y’all heard that too.. these same people tell us to vote for scoundrels like Biden. 🥴

So, Dementia Joe, can film an ad driving a fancy car, paid for by the taxpayers, without a mask, but he cant debate  Did anyone get a big whiff of the chicken sh*t as it drove by?  SEE IT: Joe Biden
If Biden could hurt God we have a lot more to worry about than him winning an election
Biden's a lifelong Catholic.  Trump publicly, almost proudly confessed in 2015 that he's never felt the need to ask God for forgiveness.  Who seems more "against God" to you?
...wow. Shady GOP politics trying to lessen the black voter support for Biden. Taking advantage of a guy with bipolar, registering him in states that account for like 100 electoral votes. Zero chance of statistically winning. via
Joe Biden, the very definition of an empty suit
Good grief. Joe Biden is a devout Catholic. Donald Trump went to church once to hold a Bible upside down. #twocorinthians
Guess what, honey....You DON’T know what racist is. What you’re describing is preference. Maybe even prejudice (but, not). Racism is believing one race superior to others. Biden electing a Black VP is not him believing any race superior.
Hey, Ange - looks like this happened AFTER Obama was president and BEFORE Biden was president.  Ask Trump why this is and what he's doing about it other than to threaten Chicago with an armed federal response.
Forrest Trump is sounding like a deranged psychopath, accusing Biden of hating everything, including God. You left out apple pie. Trump seems to have some serious mental issues.

Probably. But, few of us are fundamentally persuadeable, right? Regardless of which party/which candidate we prefer. Like the few % who may vote Biden but might have  voted Trump over Bernie. Which is why the Dems blocked Bernie, but are pushing Biden 2 run on Bernie's views.
If Biden did this, Rush would be scheduling an hour on the topic.
Joe Biden is going to destroy God 👀
At this point in the election, if your only reaction to the mention of Biden is to attack him relentlessly and unsolicited, I'm going to assume that you WANT to live in a fascist dictatorship and block you.
Biden just needs to stop talking
You said on "The Beat" today that choosing between candidates 80 plus days out is like choosing what you're going to eat that far out. (Paraphrasing). If the choice is only between Baked Chicken(Biden) and a Bowl of Shit(Trump) I think folks can make the call now.
With all the hoops that Joe Biden is making these woman jump threw during the Veepstakes, I’m suprised the last challenge isn’t a Dance contest! WHO NEXT!!
At least we hear intelligence with empathy from Biden unlike trump.
One of Biden's favorites?
only if I could also vote Biden away as well
Saying Biden doesn’t love GOD? Can Trump go any lower???
In physics, it is impossible to reduce anything to absolute zero temperature, but Joe Biden can do it with an icy stare.
Biden went out of the yard again today without his shock collar.  He killed off his Black votes, though I would have left after hairy legs and roaches.  And poor kids just as smart.
Senate Republicans advance Ukraine probe aimed at Biden despite foreign interference concerns
Man said Biden gonna hurt God.
Biden is such a pandering piece of sh*t.  Kissing Black voters ass but insulting them constantly.
Ima say it yet AGAIN... the Biden team needs to hire you!!!
Whine whine whine me me me, you all know the world circles around me so I never have to shut up with the crazy talk, never.  I have no idea how good a debater Joe Biden, he’s going to eat my lunch.
Biden lol......
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait....  Is Biden incompetent and feeble  OR  Is he powerful enough to hurt God  Which is it????
And they claim Biden is impaired.
I don’t think Trump grasps the concept of an omnipotent God. Biden, a practicing Catholic, most certainly understands. And yet, millions of Trump’s sheep will cheer on this kind of BS. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Are people actually going to vote for Biden? Joe Biden the pedophile that’s who y’all want running the country??
this mf will use anything he can get his authoritarian hands on to make himself look better. research, and you will understand what biden is talking about and where he his coming from. CONTEXT IS KEY!
Biden really just say this!! 😳   “Unlike the African-American community... the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community."
Biden = This guy I am new to Twitter
You mean like this? Last week Trumps campaign ran an attack ad, included a pic of Biden praying (as any good Christian party would do). Now he is anti-Bible and religion? His followers truly are moronic sheep who only respond to his dog whistle.
Biden needs to quit saying what he really thinks about minorities
How could a black Male or female vote for a man like   Joe Biden???  This makes no sense.
This nigga biden must want to lose
Of course. Joe Biden, the Catholic. Who supports abortion.  And had NADA to say when the Dem Antifa were burning Bibles and churches.  I call BULL SHIT on the "Joe's a devout Catholic" malarkey.
Juan Williams and Donna Brazille are property of Master Biden.  They are plantation dwellers for life.

Biden the Plagiarizer Strikes Again — and This Time It’s Even Worse
If Trump was “The first racist president” then if Joe Biden wins he’ll be the 2nd
Biden's gonna be labeled a radical by Trump &amp; his goons anyway, just go full progressive bro
So, you're trying to convince us that Biden has some kind of magic wand, and will somehow bypass all protocols to and branches of the government, to blink these things into existence? In less than four years?   Hmmm, nah.
But whatabout Biden’s gaffes, amirite? 🙄
tbh I think Biden is going to be a one term president. His age will be a major factor and Biden knows this.   Sources say that he’s looking for a VP who can be the face of the Democratic Party and become President ASAP if anything was to happen to him.
Joe Biden is going to ... hurt the bible?
Biden, by refusing to take a cognitive test, proves he needs one
if Joe Biden tried to shoot up the school that God was in Trump would go running in their bonespurs-a-blazin' just like he said. #PromisesMadePromisesSomething
Joe Biden once won a pushup contest against entropy.
I think he's got the same problem George W. Bush has - he's not stupid, he's just not a good public speaker. When Dems used to go on and on about how stupid Bush was, I kept saying, 'he just needs to join Toastmasters'. Biden needs Toastmasters as well.
If Biden is so horrible, why do these pro-Trump PACs and super PACs constantly have to lie to scare voters away from him?
So sad.  Biden can't get out a legible sentence and Trump won't shut up.  #americasfinest
That being said, even tho they brought it on themselves dissolving the #NRA NOW is a TERRIBLE move for the Democrats. They should wait til after the election to make a move on that.  Some Indeps who are mostly pro-2A still connect NRA with #2A policies, and this could hurt Biden.
Donald Trump, whose only god is the almighty dollar, who epitomizes sloth, who lusts after women, who will take everlasting revenge for the most meager wrong against him, who cheated on all 3 of his wives, believes Biden is against God.
My latest at  --&gt;&gt; Joe Biden: Latino Community Has Diverse Attitudes “Unlike the African-American Community”

Ahh come on man those aren’t even comparable to Biden’s you know that.
He has gone bat-shit crazy...he is blaming Biden for everything that has happened or will ever happen...next is the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby
What hasn’t Donald Trump attacked Joe Biden on at this point?
The NRA is a terrorist organization and I’ll be happy to see it gone. Also no one’s buying your “Biden will take all your guns” crap!
I like sassy Biden.
Trump’s a mess, Joe Biden’s a mess, let’s just throw the whole presidency thing away and run this country ourselves!
This election is gonna kill us either way...from having to get through another 4 years of this doof trying to become a dictator or the stress of trying to get Biden over the finish line without constantly shooting himself in the foot.
This just happen. Bizarre.  It’s very, very hard to care about Joe Biden’s gaffes.
Finally revealed, Presidential candidates will typically have a national staff, which is overseen by a campaign manager and assisted by political consultants, senior advisors to Joe Biden!!!
Ryan gets it. If you follow me, you need to follow him. He understands who and what Joe Biden is and he’s not afraid to call it out. Thank you Ryan.
I don't honestly think Biden's administration will be any kinder to minority than Obama's was. I voted for him twice and feel foolish.
ALL Americans would be well off IF the media never quotes Trump,never shows 2 seconds of video. now equal time should be given to Biden!
Nobody give a chit about Trump’s schoolyard taunts anymore, and he finds that frustrating. He is predictablely so awful that Biden’s little stutters mean nothing. Trump said “it is what it is” when questioned about the massive Covid deaths. How do you top that “gaffe”?
Joe Biden must have a Hattroi Hanzo Sword.
Between  "pubic accommodations" and  "Biden's polices" I've got the feeling  didn't leave a single brain cell behind for the Trump regime.
MORE BIDEN FAMILY PROFFITING !
His name is Joe Biden and he's running for the U.S. Senate. And that was back in February.  By November, he's going to need one of those name tags that says "My name is Joe. If found return to.."
Look how many candidates dems had. They knew Biden couldn't serve but by making him the frontrunner, they could place whoever they wanted as POTUS and not worry they couldn't be elected. Just place them by making them VP.
The #NRA and the #2ndAmendment are completely different things. Plus, Biden never said he wanted to strip Americans of their constitutional rights. #TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks
Biden as some sort of ultrastrong Marvel character is not something I saw coming.
Remember how many dems they ran in the beginning or President? They always knew Biden has had dementia and could not serve as President much past being sworn in.Dems would place one of their choosing that they know could NEVER win the election.A choice of the DS. Not voter choice
She’s not going to vote for Joe Biden. Neither are the fringe-Sanders people. Just put them in the “not persuadable” column and move one. We shouldn’t let these people hold us hostage. They are not on the team. They don’t get a vote. Easy.
A Biden Presidency would be a Disaster!!! Our County would take years to recover from!! We can not let that Happen!!!
Says the man who claims Biden will “hurt God”.
As person who prefers Republicans to democrats but likes Biden (the person) more than trump and sees both parties paying less attention to people with my views, I feel the only way I can make my voice heard is voting for someone else.
They are intertwined together. That's Biden's plan..
well I'm not saying don't vote for Biden. But I am saying that the way we choose these people is weird.
Prison reform that Obama and Biden could have done during their 8 years shows how racist Trump is.
Maybe  meant was “Biden will hurt golf”.
Just me here but the “Biden will hurt God” campaign line doesn’t seem ideal coming from a lying, cheating, adulterous grifter  - just sayin. #TrumpIsALaughingStock
WEIGH IN: Historian Allan Lichtman has correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election since 1984 –- so will it be Trump or Biden in 2020? #Election2020
I’m voting for Biden unless he picks Trump as his VP
Writing in a candidate serves no purpose other than to protest the 2 viable options. You’ve consistently expressed the need to vote out DJT. If that’s truly your view, I’d think you’d be more accepting of Biden’s pick regardless...
The Trump ads that say Biden is with the far left are so rude because it just reminds me he isn't.
Since Chuck Norris is a dick, this seems like a good time to replace the old Chuck Norris jokes with Joe Biden jokes.
I did not see or even hear of Joe Biden going out and gassing people so he could hold the Bible up-side down for the whole world to see! 🙄
LMFAO at this point I don’t even wanna vote 🤣 between this and what Biden said last night y’all making Kanye look good
You are defending Biden? Put hatred for Trump aside as it is irrelevant in this convo. Biden seriously just put both feet in his bumbling mouth.
There’s no point to even make fun of Biden and his awkward gaffes anymore. It’s honestly so sad to me and really makes me think about my grandpa who has been struggling with dementia for over 4 years now. I hope he gets the help he deserves.
In other words you're looking for an excuse not to vote for Biden.
Yep, Dems are foolishly acting like Biden already won.
NO.... not only Obama, but Biden, Brennan, Clapper, Rice, Holder, Yates, Comey, Hillary....  Fake News and Deep State would pummel anyone trying such a thing... hence Conservatives are too timid to try 😖😖😖
Uhhh.... yeah. Hmm.  I've got nothing here.    Does he even know who Biden is?  Far left extremist? Bible Hater?  I think not.
I’d rather Biden’s corrupt over Trump/Kanye’s corrupt
Why Joe Biden gets 'belligerent' when challenged: Michael Goodwin |
I do believe I’d check the skies before venturing out.  Trump calling out Biden in the name of religion might not be wise.  Altar boy vs rent collector?  Not good.
Clearly Biden himself, as Trump has declared that he is powerful enough to “hurt God.”
Joe Biden is making it VERY hard to vote for him lmao like bruh....just shutup, you have our vote rn but don’t fuck that up
He really doesn’t have anything to hit Biden with. Maybe on Sunday they’ll show a pic of Biden at church and Trump playing golf!  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Joe Biden does not have to prove he reads his Bible, or how to hold it. 😉
I honestly dont think neither Trump or Biden wants to win this november. They are just going through the motions. Literally every day they either say or do shit thats says “what can i do not to get elected”.
This demon actually said Biden would hurt God .... if white folks don’t wake up  i don’t know what will happen to them
Trump on Biden:  "He's against breathing air, he kicks puppies. Once he punched my granny. He likes to take candy from babies. He's pro bubonic plague"
There is, for example, a massive difference between Kamala Harris and Susan Rice. For me, it’s likely the difference between Biden getting my vote and writing someone else in. Harris would have my vote. Rice would not.     Well damn SE didn’t see that coming
That's all Biden is care about is Latinos and other immigrants! He ain't thinking about us ( the black community). #FBA #B1
DID Biden announce his VP? I just got a text saying “here’s your chance to meet HER.” Who’s her?
Biden and Hilary have virtually the same politics. If anything, Biden has been pushed to be a lil more progressive. But he’s polling so much better with white men than she ever did. The misogyny inside of this bus!!
Calling Biden a practicing Catholic is a joke. He is against protecting the unborn....very basic Catholic belief. Same with  Nancy P....I'm sure she is still praying for our President.
HOW CAN ANY SELF RESPECTING BLACK PERSON VOTE FOR BIDEN? WOW?
At this point, Donald Trump is saying anything just see if it will stick to the wall on Biden
Whoever is tweeting for Biden is vying for my vote. HARD.
I'm waiting to order my  gear til he announced his VP so I can have both names on my bumper sticker, hat, and shirt.  Please Joe make it #BidenHarris2020 Biden/Harris!
Biden doesn’t articulate his thoughts well but I don’t know a lot of black people who trace their roots like the latin community does and that’s all he was trying to say..
Joe Biden looks like an important piece of paper that got left in the rain and then dried out and everyone keeps insisting it's "just as good as before."
Literally all Biden needs to do to win is follow Aaron Burr’s advice “Talk less, smile more”  And yet
My mother is a tiny bit older than Joe Biden, and I wouldn't hire her for anything more strenuous than a sleep study. This is a woman who raised five children and moves 75 pound rocks around her yard obsessively all day every day.
Biden is a practicing Roman Catholic; there'd be no Bible unless for the Catholic Church!
Neither Biden nor Trump never offer me and the rest of the black community tangibles and reparations! So, here's my final answer! #FBA #B1
Dude just said the “Great State of Ohio”.... Biden here I come
Wait until Biden finds out some Latinos ARE Black 🤯🙃
Exactly. It’s bigger than Biden and Trump. These idiots don’t know how to look at the bigger picture.
Nothing will happen to Trump under a Biden admin. Corporate Democrats are fucking useless. So much for an “opposition” party.
Any day now right-wing nut jobs will come up with the conspiracy theory that Hunter Biden worked with China to release the virus just to undercut Trump's reelection. Who cares how many lives get sacrificed for the glory of Trump?
I’m surprised Biden even makes it to work each day. If you call what he does work
all I’m saying is if they make Biden take a cognitive test, Trump should too
Couldn’t have said it better myself, Joe Biden like a lot of people, like I even thought a long time ago, think blacks people have to be democrats. We don’t have a hive mind and a lot of liberals think we do.
I though I had signed up to try to help Joe Biden but all I get is a text everyday to donate money.
You know she's voting Biden. That was her Dad's friend. There should be no confusion or doubt on this point. Trump is not an option.

BREAKING: Joe Biden’s Worst NIGHTMARE Comes True – It’s Happening  via  News Network
talked with a deep red state dude the other day claiming biden is not up to the mental challenge. wonder where he gets his news?
Joe Biden used US money, we'll, the threat of withholding it, and e
I agree. It’s not about liking Donald Trump. I find him entertaining but I also think if he said “I’m sorry” or “ I was wrong” every now &amp; then he could win over a huge chunk of the middle. It’s only a race between he &amp; Biden because Trump is making it one.
If you vote for a man who doesn't even know what state he's in or if he's running for senate instead of President you have no right to question a Christians decision to vote for  Trump. Biden is a sick man &amp; needs a mental acuity test. Trump is greatest President of all time!🇺🇸🇺🇸
It's not the news...It's the Snark Report with  Strange obsessions and  bad behavior with a fiancé, a possible new campaign slogan for Joe Biden, and Napoleon's sister is now minus a few toes thanks to a tourist. MORE:  #WCCB #rising #news
I think Biden should make his campaign slogan “my time is up” it would be a nice wink and a nod to the #metoo movement that really failed to call him out on countless creepy things he’s done... and it is something he says all the time to cheat the clock in debates.
Jill biden is the creepo
Why can’t you say you are voting for Biden? Are you not casting a vote for President period?
Can’t Believe Trump &amp; Biden are our only options ...
Atleast with trump I’m learning how to deal wit da pecawood shit &amp; I can see everything for what it is. Joe Biden gon y’all his self right into not coming out the room like Hilary did when trump won last time.  Y’all better tell y’all man to stfu or find a way 2 get us some money
Again, it doesn’t matter what Biden says. If he said “ when elected I will send all African Americans to the gas chamber” he would still get 85% of the black vote. Kinda reinforcing the point he just made wouldn’t you say?
Yo fat guy Go back and watch Biden v Ryan in the VP debate and rethink this tweet
What are the odds Biden is on the ticket, but doesn’t realize it?
From the 70s through the 90s. Joe Biden is responsible for 2.5 million blacks being locked up in that time. I saw it with my own eyes. I did what I did. But others got amplified time and life for bs. He is the worst.
The Democrats knows that Joe can't compete on a level playing field. Joe Biden has early symptoms of Dementia or Alzheimers, and the Dems know it. They're using Joe to get a younger Socialist in power. Joe has been dragged hard LEFT, until he doesn't recognize himself.
Yo if Kanye really trolling just to divert the black vote from Biden.  Trump team gave him 80 million MINIMUM.   So in that case he still a OPP &amp; that would be nasty work !
As i do ... Biden’s tone and laughter at the question didn’t set well with them. What part of freedom of speech do you think you control behind a keyboard   Debate is healthy  maybe you need to develop thicker skin   Their was nothing toxic about their comments #goodtrouble maybe
Biden supporters won’t be drawn away, but there could be some young voters that aren’t too enthusiastic about Uncle Joe. The Trump supporters won’t be swayed regardless.
BLM needs to pick up the pace for Biden.
Understood - totally, those issues need to be addressed. So how are these things being solved by the current health care system, or what Biden will implement? As opposed to what M4A would do.
Joe Biden is not the Dems candidate

Good question. Well it backfired with me. I voted for Bernie in 2016 but because of nuts like this guy I didn’t vote for him this campaign. This guy doesn’t understand what he is doing to their movement. Every time he texts I remind somebody to vote for Biden.

How? Because the difference between you and Biden is so vast that there is no need for additional decision making. Besides...all you are going to do in the debates is lie continuously like you did in 2016 and have continued ever since.

You don't have to check Polifact to know this is true.  Throw every other thought out. This is a referendum on Trump and Biden has little to do with it other than being an avatar for the DNC. Joe can only lose what should be a slam dunk.
While he has not yet endorsed many of the things listed above to avoid upsetting some moderate voters, Biden has promoted giving statehood to DC and banning most assault weapons, both of which had been confined to Bernie and Warren just six months ago.
It’s the hypocrisy for me, she is 100 percent correct. They only care about decorum. Biden could do some of the same things Trump is doing and liberals won’t care because “He’s nice”, it’s sick.

Biden, the bar is so low... so incredibly low. Please don’t blow this thing with your constant gaffes. Maybe before answering any questions think “how would Obama respond to this question?”

Does anyone else have a problem with his temperament? Every single time Biden is asked a question he lashes back at the person asking. “Dog faced pony soldier” “Why the Hell...” “You wanna go outside?” “Go vote for someone else!” And countless more.

Folks, a lot of you have been asking Biden's position on China is dangerous and not based in reality. For years the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been sending Chinese students to America's top doctorate programs in order to gain access to university research labs. 1/2
THE funniest thing I have seen so far involving Joe Biden.  Dementia is real
The Biden campaign should thank the Trump team for these interviews.
Fascinating. It’s like Biden has been reading Friedman instead of Karl Marx. Biden is taking a conservative free market capitalist position on trade with China. He is right. We should cancel tariffs. They only hurt America. Trump’s trade war failed.
Blew past 500, on the way to 600. Also don’t let anyone bully u into picking the lesser of two evils this election. If Biden doesn’t want to make concessions for the left don’t feel bad about not giving him your vote, he’s not entitled to it.
Oh wouldn't it be something if Biden camp chooses Susan Rice the same day her indictment for corruption is unsealed!
Team black is voting Biden, now are you joining the team so we can win or are you trying to be a free agent.

I'm with Brian Cates, Biden is nearly 80 years old and has lived the life of a billionaire while riding on the backs of corruption.   Biden deserves nothing more than the slow and public decline of a corrupt politician.
Wow. Trump is flailing. And bigly.
This is the whole game, y’all. I don’t care if you don’t like Joe Biden. Vote for him because of the courts.
No, they are members of a political party that believes blacks are so stupid they'll only vote for a black candidate. They voted for Obama, so logically, they'll vote for Kanye instead of Biden. They also believe the world is flat, the sun orbits the earth and water flows uphill.
I am. Biden's got dementia.
LeoTerrell on Hannity...Donald Trump has done more in 3 short yrs for blacks, minorities&amp; for America than Obama/Biden in8yrs! That’s painful to DEMS BC REPS aren’t suppose to care for minorities, but Trump is COLOR BLIND &amp; does what is in the best interest of America! Thanks LT!
Keep Trump on the interview circuit. It’s working. For Biden
He cut deals with Biden because Biden gave away the store! So much so that Harry Reid banned him from further negotiations!
There has been so much expertise tossed out the door in this admin! I have no idea how we’ll ever get them back. Especially if Biden actually passes healthcare reform (since we don’t pay public servants shit vs private sector so the only draw is healthcare &amp; passion) #Maddow
And Biden said if you vote for Trump you ain’t black.....I think both sides know very little about black people lol
I’m not trying to be mean or political here but Biden can’t string a few coherent sentences together.  He would get chewed up and spit out by every foreign leader in the world. I keep watching Biden and his mental capability has dramatically declined.   Just watch his interviews.
Laugh now, don’t get too complacent! If Biden wins, you won’t be exempt  from increasing crime, mob rage, nor cyber-bullies. I doubt your smugness will remain if protestors  rob your house &amp; threaten to kill you!
I am voting for what I always vote for.   Supreme Court Low taxes. Strong natl defense.  Why do you vote. Biden has been in DC since 1972. He has never accomplished anything. He has never managed anything. Doesn’t know one thing about job creation. Or the economy. Same for Rice
They think black people are stupid and they think we will vote for West rather than Biden! Trust me... we are not stupid and we will vote for BIDEN!

Complete and utter disaster. This whole Biden catastrophe has got to be some sort of conspiracy. There is just no way that the DNC wants to actually win if they’re keeping this dumpster fire candidate. No way. They could have replaced him by now and haven’t. Question is...why.
Just in time for Biden!

This is something important for people to understand. It’s not about party affiliation for many Americans at this point. It is specifically about getting Trump out. I am independent but I’m voting for Biden.
He doesn't impress me at all but he's listening. He's adopting policies from Warren &amp; Bernie. But aside from that, if Dump wins we ain't getting another shot at ousting him. He's setting up a dictatorship &amp; that can't happen. I'll hold Biden to the flame after he wins

Biden is actually running on the most progressive platform by a major party candidate ever. Plus, it's about the courts &amp; a blue Congress passing shit more than it is about him as a person
Biden cannot do it. He will have an earpiece telling him what to say. That should be enough to drive him to whatwhatwhat
A) North Carolina has registered more republican voters in 2020 than any other year in its history. That’s a huge swing state  B) The overwhelming support for Trump in the primaries, setting records for votes in almost every state.  Biden is toast
Biden never did a thing  You know the thing For anyone but himself or his family. Hey just like most politicians.
The illegitimate barry soetoro and many in his administration are guilty of HIGH TREASON including biden.  Wait until the details about the 65k of hotdogs flown into the WHITEHOUSE for a "party" comes out (Wikileaks). Justice is coming!
So you’re for Trump or someone else? Biden has legislative and executive experience that makes him well-qualified. If people would stop trying to catch him in a “gaffe” you’d hear his platform. I’m for Joe - period!
And a ton of other things. I’m not worried that Biden is going to get on Twitter or TV and piss off another world power because his french fries from McDonald’s were cold.

You guys keep talking about Joe Biden this and that... it’s not just the president, it’s his team. The people who sit down and help him craft the policy. I’ll take Joe and his team over what we’ve got any day. Ffs...
And he died in office...I'm an Independent and no big fan of Harry Truman but at least he was competent to run the country.  God help us if Biden wins.  It's bad when Kamala is the lesser of all evils when considering who the DNC might tell him to choose as VP.
Even if that’s true, whoever Biden’s running mate is, will be light years beyond trumple thinskin

More accurately, I think, his handlers are smart. I actually don't think Biden would mind debating. His team knows it would be a disaster.
Jill Biden did an interview for Joe with FOX news yesterday, and Senator Coons did an interview for Joe with FOX news today. Is Joe Biden ever going to do an interview for Joe Biden, or are his baby sitters going to do all of the interviews for him?
From anywhere,  Biden is toast.
Joe Biden isn't even going to the DNC??????  Dems, please.  Just stop. Give up. Retire your party.  Start over.  Form a new party or two, or change your party name.  Make Kermit the Frog the defacto leader.  Do ANYTHING ELSE except what you are doing right now.
What Biden is peddling too little, too late.  Besides I don't trust him to keep any progressive promises because the very first thing he did as a candidate was to promise the donor class that nothing would change for them.  I REALLY want change, so I will change my voting.

All part of the plan.  Choose a "progressive" female VP candidate, then closer to the election Biden is "unfit", then she swoops in and claims the DNC bid.  If I were one of the other Dem Presidential candidates, I'd be pissed.  The whole debates was s farce.  Just watch.

You are aware that the VP has absolutely no power right unless there is a tie in the Senate or the president dies, right?  Of course, the President can give the VP power but that doesn't happen too often.   Most likely, Biden's cabinet will be running the country.

Really???  The VP decision would determine if you vote for Biden?  So you say if he chose Harris that Biden would have your vote.   So this is the VP you would vote for?
Maybe Biden sniffed it out of her🤔🤓🧐
So with NC, AZ, and FL going red, it is 279-180...so still Biden
Biden says Harris is 'very much in contention' to be his running mate  The California Democrat is among the names on
The only pending doom is Biden possibly getting elected.
Nah.. Trump is not playing Kanye! Kanye is a willing participant. His goal is to take votes from Biden because he wants Trump back in.
Joe Biden is the same as Donald Trump, but without corona.

I agree, it was a disaster. He wasn’t my first choice. But the moron that’s there right now needs to go!  I’m just hoping Biden makes the right VP choice🤞🏼
my bad..... i thought we were talking about the OTHER recent exposure of mr biden's ability to give his "handlers" 5-alarm indigestion.  those guys deserve hazard pay  (and need to be on suicide watch)
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
Biden is just trump without Corona.
...easy to lose focus. All these bias poles that are heavily weighted polling Democratic voters, and they have Biden ahead by 6 to 10 points, They are a friggin joke! They're trying to demoralize and discourage us right up till November 3rd. Guess what assholes? We're voting...
Does anyone with an objective point of view, think that this looks like Joe Biden has a snowball's chance in hell of winning the presidency?? With the pandemic going on and all the negativity the liberals social media censoring the mainstream media pounding us every day it's...
Doing to Biden what was done to HRC? Shame. The current occupant of the White House says alarming things EVERY DAY.

I didn’t see Biden and Barry passing the First Step Reform Act for our babies... They did a lot of talking.  They caused a brand new racial divide.  And they helped no one.
Ask questions about Kanye &amp; Trump's connection?Kanye's  running to take votes away from Biden.
I saw this move coming when he made the announcement. Especially given the fact that he has said nothing about Trump and Trump has said nothing about him.  They're in this together. Trump is calling in the favor for helping
The only reason I care about Biden's pick is because it may influence how others vote, not me.
Check out Joe Biden’s platform. There is something here for everyone!  #BuildBackBetter
He’s thinks we’re so stupid. Biden got problems, especially past deeds maybe, but compared to DJT, he’s a saint. We have no chance of respect with Newt and DJT.  Whatca laugh. 💙
I hope it means never Biden!
Kind of like the Biden situation.
Did I hear an apology? Nah. THAT’S not gonna happen. The leftist media love her assertion, albeit it false. But what does that matter. At least she’s consistent, even if she’s wrong and temperamental. Biden’s choice? OMG!!!!!
How many racial gaffes does Biden get before the Black community becomes aware that he’s only their “ally” and friend during election years?   Another insult today. “The blacks aren’t as diverse as the Latinos”. How can you possibly vote for this career politician?
Biden’s gaffe that African Americans lack diversity was an error and and I hope he thinks twice before he makes such ridiculous statements.
This country was respected when Obama and Biden were heading it. Have you not noticed the way people make fun of you; laugh at you; think we are not the same country as we used to be? If you don’t know that, then I question your ability to understand what is going on.
Biden has more God in him than you have in your smallest toe. In fact, you would not know God in anybody.

By admitting to the 2010 Census that you resided in DC, you effectively voted with your feet for Obama in 2012, Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020. Actually voting for anyone is a farce.
Biden said something dumb &amp; you dont have to defend it
i swear if biden becomes pres in nov imma start scamming bcuz we all clowns then
But yeah, let's see who Biden picks as his VP because if I don't like them, 4 more years of unabated death!
You are reaching and stretching so far to give Biden the benefit of the doubt here- something that you would never do for someone with an (R) at the end of their name, you partisan hack.
So why do you keep making the distinction about "latinos" instead of Latino Americans?African Americans come from lot of different countries too. We all know damn well Joe Biden wasnt talking about Latinos as a whole diaspora. He shouldve just said what he really meant

I got mine at Biden merchandise. I think it was $20.
I agree. And Biden believes in the importance of Climate change, healthcare, and foreign policies. Right now, we change Trump's policies and begin truly working on progressive changes for 2022 and 1024. Let's find the candidates were KNOW want true changed and will fight 4 them.
I will criticize Biden. He's not progressive enough. But he can at least stop the damage going on from Trump. We should've been helping progressivev candidates long before now and must start for 2022,2024. 3 months is just enough time but an end to the current madness.

You should substitute Biden for Trump. Problem was that Trump doesn’t listen - it’s all fake intelligence, fake news, etc. what a warped, Putin created world you live in.
Have you listened to the Democratic nominee speak, have you listened to real news and what the Democrats are proposing for our country? The major clowns right now are Biden and Pelosi 🤡
Yikes - Biden is up by just 3 points over Trump in a new national poll..
Guess Biden and dnc using antifa and blm donations for tv ads.   One I see the most is where he is touting Trumps MAGA plan for buying American, building small business, working for jobs and stop reliance on China...hmmm guess he is coming over to the side of the deplorables MAGA

My interpretation of his words. Trump supporters always try to explain what Trump meant.   It's a shame that whatever you heard Biden say is exactly what it is but when Trump says something, he didn't mean it that way.  How do YOU interpret "My father was born in Germany?"
I want someone who is presidential.   I want Joe Biden.

There's some truth to that I think. As a fellow Warren supporter who did some volunteer work in the election, I interacted with plenty of Warren supporters who completely felt alienated by Sanders supporters. Many so turned off they preferred Biden over Sanders as a result.
Joe Biden was not chosen until the last week of August. He shouldn’t be forced to hurry a decision. And, if African Americans do not see the danger in #45 and ready to vote, that’s not Biden’s fault.
The debate's are meaningful, and revealing! If Joe Biden is not able to verbally spar with an American President, how can hold office, and interact with foreign president's, and other leaders? What's he going to do, send Jill with a note??
Trump supporters don't care that he fawns over dictators, but opponents care very much. This is one reason among many why some of us who don't agree with Biden on much, are inclined to vote for him anyway. A running mate who also fawns over dictators would neutralize that issue.

GOP must do something to prevent the cheating. Otherwise, the election will certainly go to Biden.
Disagree. First "no," and the one Luntz cited, was a clear answer to the question: do you flatly rule this out, yes or no." The later promise to beat Biden "fair and square" leaves weasel room for "yes we'll accept foreign interference again, and it will be fair and square."

Well it is named voice if america so why shouldn’t it be bent towards Biden? If it were Voice of Putin or Russia Today it should favor the incumbent
I think Trump will win, but I can't exactly rationalize it?  It makes no sense but it just seems like Biden is being sold so poorly, like there's no energy there, no enthusiasm. Biden is the 'well him I guess' candidate there's no passion for him. Make any sense?
The standard that I held Biden to was the mere FACT that Trump cannot cancel the election period! Not unless, as I stated in the piece he wants to make Nancy Pelosi President! Read the column in it’s entirety before leveling baseless charges!

Biden will take over from President Pence. They won't let Trump pardon himself. So, Mikey will always have that week to remember.
Hell I'm hoping it's so bad it can be called for Biden by 9 pm
Obama and Biden are doing no such thing. This president is dishonest. People around him were actually found guilty of crimes. Evidently you had no problem with Trump saying Obama was not a citizen FOR YEARS, trying to unseat an elected prez. Go sit down.♥️
The best thing is that trump’s anti mask stand infected his followers, and now they can’t back down. They are causing the very situation that is tanking trumps re-election chances! It’s so ironic, it’s freakin poetic justice. You anti maskers might as well be working for Biden 😂
I feel as tho your tweet is harmful because you falling in line is allowing the oppression to continue. We can speak about issues and we can seek action now without being harassed by "Biden Bros."

That’s a lame argument. Nice attempt at laying all the ‘COVID deaths’ at Trumps feet. Typical lefty deflection. Rice is a proven hack and Pence will mop the floor with anyone that Biden..errr the DNC picks as VP, just as Trump will demolish Sloe Biden in the debates.

Biden supports legalizing abortions for women that want them. Trump bans women fleeing forced abortions from entering the United States.  I understand many Catholics are upset with the former, but why are you ok with the later.
Yes, compared to, say, the Pope Biden isn't very religious.  He's not running against the Pope. He's running against someone who fucked a porn star while his wife was at home with a baby and who brags how he can get away with sexual assault.
Thing is Biden totally could have talked about the diversity of the latinx community, without adding the insulting remark about the black community. C’mon man...
I'm voting Libertarian, because apparently only Libertarians get three votes this year: a vote for Jorgensen, a vote for Trump, AND a vote for Biden all as t once.
Imagine if Biden is president 😲 a lot of LEGAL immigrants who don't speak Spanish would be screwed by thousands of recently arrived economic migrants.
That’s why I hate those people. “Not voting for Biden is voting for Trump.” No it’s not, both are extremely corrupt: Biden is owned by the oligarchs that run this country and Trump is a wannabe fascist dictator. I want no part of it.
Biden's 22 yo aide is fixing what his old boss screwed.
Mumbles Pelosi is just as bad as Biden. They all need to GO!
You can complain that Biden isn't the most religious person, but compared to Donald Trump...
That and just calling it a hoax. Biden says he will accept nomination in his home state, so Trump comes back and says  He might use the WH. How appropriate. Looking for any advantage even if by association

Biden's gonna get at least 90% of the Black vote, folks. These "gaffes" don't change anything. Any Dem nominee for President is guaranteed to win at least 90% of the Black vote these days.
It’s a virus. Unless he has a magic wand, there’s nothing more our President could have done. Hillary, Obama, or Biden’s actions would’ve been similar, if not identical. You deranged, TDS infected libs are so far gone, you’ve lost all sense of reality.
While this may be correct, I feel quite sure this criticism of Trump is in response to his recent rantings about Biden. You know the old saying - pot calling the kettle black. Biden has made word errors and has stuttered thru speeches, however doesn't dis Trump on his gafs.

A lot of people are very bullish on Garcia but if anything, Trump's political fortunes have sunk further since May. Based on the trends and polling elsewhere, Biden is going to carry CA-25 by double digits and it's gonna be a tough race for Garcia.

Also, I think it's more likely that my elderly beagle will chase down the squirrel that sits on the trellis and critters at him than it is that Biden tweets anything. So technically the Twitterer didn't say the other thing.

When asked if he could "hurt God" as his opponent alleged, Joe Biden shoved back one sleeve and said, "You're darn skippy. I'd give him the ol' one-two, straight in the pucker, just like on the corner back in my shoeshine days. We didn't take no guff or malarkey, deity or not."
Biden believes in a woman's right to kill her children...and he's a Marxist ...thats not someone who is with God...but you better wear a mask!
I’m not voting for Biden. That’s all I know for now.
Let’s get a calendar and put a red X on every Sunday that Trump went to church in the last four years and a blue X for Biden. Want to place bets on what that calendar looks like?
Biden's message is very clear and focused.  Yo Semite and Thigh-land are trump's words.
You misunderstood, understandably, but you'll get it if you take a minute. He's talking about a "landslide" election in which Biden is flipping states (red-to-blue). Those states are ranked by probability of a win (even if &lt;50%). Big drop in prob after TX. AK next most prob flip.
Joe Biden has “polices”?  🤷🏾‍♂️
If Joe Biden is capable of hurting your god, you don't have much of a god.
Don't get the Republican desire to get Biden on the debate stage. It's not like Trump is a great debater or doesn't have a habit of saying controversial things.
Lol lol lol black people voting for Biden are really brainless. Biden is pondering to us the Hispanics because the democrats know they lost the black vote. #Biden2020 #BidenIsARacist
I JUST CAN'T HANDLE THIS  He knows exactly who he's talking to. They'll eat it up.  Nevermind that Biden is a Catholic. The almighty Trump says he's anti-God, then it must be true
I mean, you have a choice between Biden and the current moron, whose negligence and ego have cost tens of thousands of lives.  But sure, let it come down to the VP pick.
If you don’t vote for Biden, you’re voting for Trump, sweetie
If you’re voting for Joe Biden you might actually be a racist 👀 Unlike the Trump supporters you tried to peg that on in 2016
I know who &amp; what Trump and Biden are. If you don't at this point you won't be capable of evaluating a debate. I think Biden will mop the floor w/ Trump, but even if Biden comes out &amp; curls up in a fetal ball on stage I'll vote for him. Trump is a plague upon us, literally.
You didn't put the record player on at night like Uncle Joe Biden told you to do?
The people who are pro NRA weren't going to be voting for Joe Biden....
That much everyone seems to agree on. Trump is definitely down from 2016 but nothing shows Biden leading. I know Democrats are polling the general election for the House race. I simply don't buy that Republicans aren't. It doesn't make sense.
My source further elaborates that he has not seen anything from Republicans showing a Biden lead. Possible this is an unweighted poll though (before they weight it to match the electorate). Outside groups have done polling here and they match campaign. Trump down from 16.
youtube is desperately trying to dissuade me away from voting for biden but every ad they show me just convinces me more... like ohh no hes gonna defund the police and raise taxes! exactly the things i want to happen!
It is a Binary Choice..... A vote for Biden is a vote for Liberal Facsism 100% and a Vote for a minor candidate is a non-vote.
You think your debate skills are going to change anyone’s mind?  You were horrible in the debates with Hilary- lumbered around the stage like an oaf shouting random words.  You’re pathetic.  There is nothing more we need to see- mailing in my vote for Biden ASAP!

Will this turn out gun owners to vote against Biden?
As people age, they lose inhibition and speak their thoughts rather bluntly. These racist thoughts are flowing out of Biden due to age-related cognitive decline.
It’s very simple. Joe Biden expects to get 99% of the Black vote and about 75% of the Latino vote.

If we’re going to say Biden isn’t calling the shots. Then you’ve got to say trump isn’t calling the shots. Just look at how he has Kushner doing his bidding
Because that's what Trump is doing.  He's hiding in the bunker on the floor.   Everything Trump says is wrong with Biden is really wrong with him.
Beautifully putted, Mr. President! Big media and new media, don’t want the debate! They don’t want America to know what it is obvious, Biden, is not up to the task!  Trump 2020!!! 🇺🇸

My concern would be for younger voters, regardless of race. Might vote for Kanye as a joke when they would have voted for Biden out of hatred for Trump. I’m just speculating though. I hope young voters would be serious about 2020 elections though. 🤞🏻
It’s truly disgusting. Why not retire &amp; spend the rest of their days being cozy?? &amp; I can’t believe we don’t have a nonpartisan something in place 2 make sure candidates are mentally healthy. Trump, Kanye and Biden may all be mentally compromised. We know they’re not totally well
President Joe Biden
I see what you did there. Can President Biden name his Cabinet now? It will lower the Nation’s blood pressure.
And the first Black Woman to get the job on top of that? This is the same woman who said it’s time to “let the Anita Hill thing go.” But Kamala is supposed to apologize for DEBATING Biden? It’s all fishy to me. Jill doesn’t want 2 take a backseat 2 a black woman.
What I’ve been thinking the entire time. Joe Biden never should have run, I’m willing to bet she was all for it. She wants the same amount of attention as Michelle, not possible. And no chance if it’s Harris, no matter what project she takes on. VP has never been more important.
"Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report"
Thanks to you, I’m aware that Republicans trying to get Kanye on the ballot to take votes from Biden is nowhere close to the dirtiest trick ever pulled in a presidential race. Still... ewwww!
Lol !  Those folks were not going to vote for Biden.
Repub losers are trying to get Kanye West on several states' ballots, hoping he'll be able to siphon votes from Vice President Joe Biden, thereby giving trump an edge...and a "win." But poetic justice may prevail here. Maybe folks will trade their trump vote for Kanye, instead!😡
Black folks who might vote for Kanye were Not going to vote for Biden anyway.  If anything, it might pull those few black voters away from trump.
This is so true !  Black folks who might vote for Kanye were Not going to vote for Biden anyway !
Kamala Harris would be a good pick. If he picks someone else, I'm good with that too. If he picks a can of tomato soup, I'm still voting for Biden.
As long as Donald Trump loses and Biden wins, I don’t care how it is predicted. I just hope he’s correct and you Rachel. I admire you very much!
Don’t even. Biden was the first elected official to publicly support gay marriage.

If Kamala Harris is selected as VP, does that mean you won't vote for Biden?
Trump's campaign knocks on a million doors a week. Biden's knocks on zero.
I grew up in a Rep home also. Started changing in college then became solidly Dem as I started my teaching career. I clash with my Rep dad a lot (mom leans D now), but I’m glad he at least hates Trump. I was shocked when he voted Hillary bc he hates her. He’ll vote Biden this yr.
I think it speaks volumes that they know the party can't broaden its appeal with Black voters and is therefore just focused on taking votes away from Biden.
It shouldn't make any difference to you who former VP Biden chooses as his VP since you're not voting for him anyway !

Those of us who have parents exhibiting speech and memory issues from forms of dimentia recognize it in Biden. People who have it Do Not know they have it and often argue with those who take care of them. They can’t operate a remote much less a nation.

Politically Trump can attack Biden on lots of things, but after that interview cognitive decline shouldn’t be one of them. It’s like me saying a guy has a big head; it could be true, but I’m not the one to make that point.
He is bot! But if GOP makes him get on the ballot some stupid idiots will vote for him...b/c Biden is “not very exciting”. Happened in 2000, 2010 when idiots voted for third party.

Joe Biden is running for president... he's not the president yet.  Like,  he doesn't have the job, he's still in the interview process. He's been through debates where he laid out some policy proposals, but there haven't been any debates since the plague year began.
Not hardly. Putin knows damn well he can't trample on America while Trump is president. Biden on the other hand would be a weak puppet to Putin, and he knows it.
Is Biden going to be any better? Almost certainly. The people around him are going to be far better, smarter people who believe in the role of government. Is Biden some political genius? No. But the people who fill his cabinet will be. Unlike today.
I can't wait to watch. Every time Trump lies he needs to be called a liar. That way,the only thing that Biden has to keep saying is - that's a lie, that's a lie, that's a lie!  #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

Barely   Although Biden *might* have some cognitive problems, he will at least listen to the health advisors about covid, and hopefully not go against them.  It's not even "we want Biden" it's more of "we don't want Trump" haha
“The base is high 30s and that won Trump the primary but he largely won the general election because Hillary was so unpopular. And Biden’s negatives are not as high as Hillary’s so there’s a big problem.”

Biden should only debate Trump if T’s tax returns are released.  Biden gains nothing by debating this BS artist.
I agree that it should be Biden's decision, however we are free to advocate for the candidate of our choice.  That's how we do it here in America!  And I do hope he doesn't choose Daffy Duck, Hun.

Great article. I'm tired of hearing, "Are we ready for a woman VP/President?" Nothing dispels that like a win. Also, we can't overlook the need to get out the vote; the VP pick is key to that. Many will vote for Biden regardless, but a good VP pick can fire up uninspired voters.
Biden won’t implement any of those things. Biden won’t even be elected.

Somebody tell Joe Biden to just please stop talking about Black people in general. Stop pandering for our vote. We don’t like you. We’re just voting for you to beat trump
Hold on, I’ve talked to a shit ton of people in my neighbor that will vote for Biden but don’t support it publicly because of fear of retaliation. Meanwhile, I see a lot of Trump 2020 yard signs. Those who support Trump aren’t quiet.
So how will biden hurt god..🤔 perhaps throw bleach on him or maybe spay him with lysol?????
A poem:   Obamagate Biden’s mate? Somewhat nice
I agree. I don't find it funny at all. I'm not a fan of Biden in any way but it makes me sad. Shame on his family.
For all of you who got their panties in a bind when Tulsi dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden.  I have not heard her say anymore about it.  Not pushing us to vote a specific person.  My kind of candidate.
Turns out Biden won’t be able to dethrone God
Uhh sir, Latinos are people from Latino America, which is a sub-region that encompasses Central America and the majority of South America. Us latinos are extremely diverse, both culturally and politically. Biden is right.
And they think Biden will make a good President. Lol.
According to Biden his arms are to tired to fly that far.

I don't think you could get Biden out of his basement.
Never trust an arrogant idiot.  Biden needs to  hammer him all the way to election day
I don’t think you get it. No matter how much you try to convince us that Biden is old or has dementia, we are fed up with Trump, and know Biden can’t be worse. At this point I would have voted for Ted Cruz if he was the Democratic Nominee.
Same old story.#FDR after Hoover, Clinton after Reagan After Bush #1, Obama after W, and Biden after Trump! Just to name a few.
Biden is referred to as the presumptive nominee.  Will Democrats really nominate him at their convention? If they do, then he should debate. Otherwise it is fair to conclude that he is incapable of doing so.
Biden afraid to debate trump, ha!
So, because Trump is not “all there” it makes it ok to vote for Biden?
Voting 3rd party only takes votes away from both Biden and Trump, which of course I am voting 🗳 for Biden!
Once again,  my post clearly wasn't read correctly.  That was a response to a person complaining about biden being in office for 40 years not doing anything about current issues. If you look at my page,  im NO trump supporter.
You're an idiot , Biden couldn't debate my 11 yr old grandson
There is one he's called joe biden.
I will be surprised if any debates take place.  The democrats are already floating lots of reasons to eliminate them.  Biden is unable to answer questions unless the answers are written down for him to read.
THE MEDIA IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING US, SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING, FAKE NEWS, BULLSHIT, THERE POLLS SHOW JOE BIDEN AHEAD OF YOU, THOSE ARE FAKE PHONEY FALSE NUMBERS, YOU WILL BEAT JOE BIDEN'S ASS, OR WHOM EVER ELSE THEY PUT IN THERE, LANDSLIDE NOMINATION, MR PRESIDENT
Why? Why would you vote for Biden? What policies does he focus on that interest you the most? What has Biden done throughout his career that will benefit US? What does he bring to the table?
The media wants us to believe that Biden is ahead in all the polls and they want mail-in voting so they can cheat then if Biden wins they can say, "He won because the polls showed he was ahead."
I'm still disgusted by the John Lewis funeral. That was nothing more than a campaign speech for Biden. You were their to honor a fallen civil rights activist/congressman and failed miserably. #Trump2020 #KAG2020
Biden never met one he didn't sniff. Oh and looks like ol Clinton definitely likes em young.

Same goes with trump, you are clearly not proving a point. And I can tell you for sure that trump has been in Epstein’s island. And I definitely agree with you ab Joe biden. Both of them are pedos.!
Biden team has backed themselves in a corner by saying he would pick a woman and now all expectations are a black woman.  His list comes with a ton of baggage.  Can't wait!
Ma’am, Trump has been sued for allegedly raping minors and women, but sure, Trump is not a pedophile but Biden is.
Imagine 2024. Biden is prez and the situation has deteriorated. Rs sweep back into power. How happy will you be if they enact their entire agenda. The filibuster is frustrating when you're in power but because Dems couldn't think ahead you now have record numbers of R judges.
why am I seeing a Joe Biden political ad before almost every You Tube video I watch and none are from your ad campaign?  I think Biden will further ruin this country, please start running some ads to get your message out.  Donald Trump 2020!!!
Exactly that is why they are saying Biden is ahead in the polls.  So when they cheat with mail in voting they can claim it was legitimate because of the polls.
I can’t believe Biden isn’t asking you to be his VP choice
I think you are confusing my statement.  I was replying to the woman who said biden is washed up...he had his chance.
He was one senator.  You people pretending that biden was some kind of god who could pass laws is stupid.
Quote from Biden yesterday “We’ll take truth over facts!”😂😂😂😂 He must have flunked every English class he took. I actually feel sorry for him and all of you ought to charge of elderly abuse
Ask Biden how to spell it..😝🙃
don't forget traitor, you have to get out of the country before u can get protection from Russia! Every educated American knows what ur doing u traitor! Soon we'll get those taxes! I'm sure Biden will pull all the gifts u have given to ur real boss Putin! Day 1
I choose Trump over Biden!Biden will get beat big time
They said Biden would destroy religion. Dude hasn't even been elected yet!
This crap is funny says Biden should get a Pass for being a Racist because he was Obamas VP. You can't make this Crap up

as a NC resident this my exact sentiment. Tuesdays primary results and other progressive wins this year have given me hope. Also Brooks would have wanted me to vote for Biden so I'm reluctantly voting Biden like Michael would have wanted IMO. Love and solidarity Beth!
But they say Biden isn't hiding...if this is his idea of fighting for the presidency and soul of America he clearly doesn't fight very hard
Not so much fear, more like realization that Biden is an idiot. Dude said if u don’t vote for him u ain’t black. Like cmon bruh. U prolly don’t even know why u hate trump. Give me a reason

About the VP  Susan rice is most competent and we'll rounded in experience to give.broader support to Biden.  She's been vetted nationally and internationally and raked over the coals and persevered.  She also brings a power structure of people from that expe
The ticket is already energized.  Biden needs someone competent and with well rounded experience to get this train wreck straighted out.  Domestically and internationally.  Only Rice is that qualified....
Exactly. If Obama didn't take any guns away after 20 toddlers we slaughtered then Biden won't take any away now.

Biden does have a number of unbiblical positions that he takes on issues.
Yeah Biden's real eager

A vote for Biden &amp; you will get a China, Cuba, Russia &amp; Mexico  run USA.  Think twice cause Joe is OTF - Out There Flapping. He sells the US foreign policies for $$ vs protecting the USA!
They were Praying over Trump you Hypocrite. Unlike GODLESS BIDEN who's Democrat Booed God 3 Times in 2012

So trump just said that joe Biden will kick your gods ass he just call god a little bitch

This is why the NRA was formed because of people like this! Guns are for protection and if the state or city isn't going to provide it then your on your own! Just think how It would be if Biden was elected! Since all the looting guns &amp; ammo are hard to find, stores are sold out!
Didn't she compare voting for him to eating excrement? That might be a tough sale for Biden.
Do you think Biden could be putting on a show to avoid prosecution for extortion in Ukraine and conspiring with Obama/ Clinton's FBI Russia coupe?
Who gives as a crap if it's edited every ad against trump is heavily edited to make him look bad. Biden is hiding in his basement Scared of Trump scared of debating Trump

The reason democrats are allowing rioting in their cities over police is to avoid the riots of US citizens talking about Clinton, Obama- Biden  using the whole DNC and FBI friends to try and steal an election they needed to win in order to hide their crimes
Clarifies? You are a joke,  He said on June 29 or 30 that he was being tested all the time.  So, your headline should read:  Regarding cognitive testing, Biden lied
I think if the DNC had a better candidate than Biden and Trump would be toast. If Obama could run again, Trump would never had won in 2016.
I find it funny how people look for any little thing they didn’t like hearing out of a trump interview just to slander him bc that’s “the thing” to do these days seems like. Yet these same people think joe Biden is fit to be president talking about kids touching his leg hairs 🤔

Is someone actually coming after Liberty's ability to have its students receive Pell grants? Or is that just a Ralph Reed talking point that Biden needs to address?

Its Biden not Bidden...and apparently you haven't watched any interviews where Trump maintains that "we are doing good"? Do you think our country is doing ok? Do you think other countries are laughing at us? Do you think he handled this virus the best he could? Are you ok?
biden is the worse choice that the dnc could have ever chose. This election is like choosing between the dollar tree and family dollar. Im not voting

Like reporters who don't follow up and let Biden Weasel out answering Questions
The truth being seen. Biden is a sick man and his family should be ashamed for not protecting him.
Very true. Trump would chew him up. Not his fault. Dementia is a sad disease. For his family to allow this to be done to him is down right sad. Biden is being used in the worst way...by his family.
The (D) Party knows how to fix everything, but they never do.  8 years of Obama-Biden - the US should be a perfect Utopia.

Somewhere, they have found a loop hole to allow the VP to take office due to Biden’s mental state. I’m surprised it’s not Michelle 😳🤦‍♂️even the dems are not stupid enough to allow Biden. But he makes a good puppet along with the dem sheep
Only way Biden wins is if he cheats
It was Florida you visited not Frorida and was Joe Biden with you? Why would his supporters be there to greet you? Here are some numbers for you....157,000 deaths and counting.
If Michelle Obama agrees to run as VP, that’s confirmation that the plan is to remove Biden for his VP to take over. There’s no other way she would do it.
I know nothing, and I don't know people who know things at this level, but I suspect there was some ferocious pushback internally at the quotes trashing Harris. Props to the Biden team for corralling Rendell.
He has a good chance to win reelection. That is how bad Biden is as your 'guy'.
Vote for Biden 💙💙
There is no way Biden is head in NC
Okay my Canadian peeps who do you all want Biden's VP to be? Whom ever he chooses the media will be ready to shred their record apart. I will just be glad when he chooses one.
You’ve got it backwards. Biden stands up for America. Trump caves in to China then claims he’s tough on them. Nope, Ivanka didn’t get all those China patents for nothing.
Biden won't let that std factory any where near him.
If Biden gets elected &amp; they control all 3 phases I really hate to think not only the military but the whole country would be like. I remember Clinton cutting the military &amp; every year the budget was used up by June therefore no training for 6 months every yr &amp; Base closings!

(5/x) That’s FORTY SEVEN YEARS with nothing to show.  And Biden is known for his racist comments (There was the famous “I don’t want my children growing up in a racial jungle” ... or, his commentary on candidate Obama, “I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American ...

What is your arguement Biden has a chance?  Let me answer for you.  Pure hate of   lol good luck.  Trump camp is silent and voring.  Bottom line. You have no chance.  Keep sending that money to the racist pervert  lol
Biden is horrible in my opinion... he is just like trump as well. The thing that makes trump more appealing is that he know what he’s doing most of the time... we don’t need a president who has stage 4 dementia.
I’m tired of you blind Biden supporters not listen to facts. How can anyone support a guy like Trump but liberal. Fact don’t care about you feelings bitch. We don’t need Trump or Biden. What makes you think Biden will do the things he’s been trying to do for 40+ years. (he won’t)
The DNC had 4+  years to come up with a candidate and came up with Joe Biden...
Mail in voting is the biggest fraud of all time! Trump no trump. Biden no Biden. There is no way this can be fair to either.
Joe Biden will announce his running mate soon. Here’s who’s on the list.
#UseTheWrongPicture Here is Trump, Biden and the moderator Alex Jones before the first presidential debate.
Something notable about the ad: it includes the character critique of Trump within an economy-focused argument. Interesting to see the way Biden turns the populism against Trump &amp; his cabinet.

No proof that he’s a white supremacist but ok... also you picture defines Biden to🤯🤯 people just rather protect him like people protect trump.
They gotta start getting that debt talk in early incase Biden wins so they can claim they've always been worried about the deficit.
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
Biden only gives a damn about his family and wealth nothing else do your research! His the biggest phony ever!
Biden says he always supported black folks for the past 30-40 years but his States black population is 20% try living in a  city where it's 50:50 then talk to me!
That's getting toward slur territory.  Since when did a VP candidate wanting to eventually be P become a bad thing? It's what Biden did. Joe better wrap this process up before it backfires on him. People are leaking trying to poison the process with their own agendas (Dodd etc).Can we feel confident that all of this became clear to the Biden team during the vetting process for VP? Not hearing her name come up lately.
Joe Biden gets in the 200 MPH electric Corvette and tries to do the Buckaroo Banzai thing where he phased through a mountain

So political pundit are saying Russia wants Trump to be president (of course...he’s doing all their dirty work) and China is pulling for Biden.  I’ve always thought Putin was a white nationalist...as is DJT...so it’s an easy decision 4 me.
Love Bernie but if the rest of the demd don't settle for biden then we're just gonna get trump again, not voting is also a vote for the person you dont want to win
Biden needs a VP who can take tough questions on the spot about race &amp; social issues. He,or we,need a VP who has a eloquent yet determined disposition that isn’t easily offended by reporters. We need someone who keeps their cool in the line of fire, but articlates with strength.
“My Statement on  Faith” by Joe Biden Anyone can research Trumps faith/ church history. I did about a yr ago. You will find in NY;  Before elected  "joined the church but never attended", statement by the pastor.
We’re with you. I hope you get VP! Biden / Harris!
She opened my eyes to a new way to consider Joe Biden. And as a leader, he will be imperfect, but he’s a good, decent man who will try to do everything he can to help all Americans. That’s 180 from what we’ve seen with Trump.
LOL, every time Trump interrupts with "wrong" or straight up insults someone without making a point, drink. Every time Biden forgets what his point was mid sentence, or puts his foot in his mouth, drink.
Trying! But know too many white family/friends who’s heels are so dug in, they don’t see the idiotic things Trump does. They only hear Fox News telling them to be mad at the media for reporting on these big blunders. And they compare them to any insignificant misstep by Biden.
Isn't it interesting how the media jumps on DJT so quickly, yet Biden has repeatedly made a fool out of himself lately, and nothing is said by the same press?
I totally agree with that. I wish you were running for president. You can fix this nation. I am unsure about Biden. You won New Hampshire.
It doesn’t appear that things have been locked down yet. Older well known and loved voices are as important as new voices. I expect them to include both. Wouldn’t be surprised to see those critical of Biden to not be included and some of those are younger “progressives”.
He definitely trips over his words constantly, but that's pretty much all right-leaning publications say about him.. hell even the New York Times has an article about it..  it's not like it's not mentioned lol
Wow. I stopped reading at “Biden knows...” 🤣
Those behaviors don’t make him a racist? COM! If W had made the same series of statements, the left would be screaming racist. For Trump, if he clears his throat they yell racist. So why does Biden, with his lousy record, get a pass?
True or false: Biden primary supporters owe the rest of us a Goddamn apology

President Biden’s first action should be to pardon Donald Trump.  This will allow our country to move on, forgetting him and his reign of incompetence and division.

Imagine that. Guess she is using the same speech writers as Joe Biden
"Just go" is right. Because in what universe does Joe Biden and Kamala Harris embrace the far left? They're about as moderate as democrats get.
Sorry bitch Kamala, obama Biden era was NOT the greatest recovery. When I apply for ANY job employers bite at the bit, during that time I COULDNT GET A JOB SHOVELING SHIT ..  your a L I A R !

This isnt Joe Biden he is on TV live and he is not on his phone
I knew Joe Biden didn't do his own tweets. This one was sent while he was on TV introducing his VP pick.  Look at the time from my twitter page and TV.
LOL if you guys wanted her so bad why didn’t you guys vote for her? Just remember she believes Joe Biden‘s accuser’s and indirectly called him a racist personally I thought the last three in the debates would’ve been Biden Sanders and Harris

Everyone keeps calling Harris a progressive when in reality she is probably more of an establishment Democrat like Biden. And just because she is running against Trump/Pence does not mean that she’s closed off from criticism
Biden is in the same demographic as the other men you mentioned...old white wealthy privileged male. No narrative you try and spin changes what demographic he belongs to.

Yes, China would prefer Joe Biden.  But why?  Because they know Joe Biden is weak and through harsh negotiations Joe will give the Communist Chinese every thing they want.  Where Trump will stand up to them for better   negotiations that work better for the American people.
It’s amazing with all his benefits, plus the lies, that Trump trails Biden in most polls.  Perhaps it’s just Trump overload, people are third of his whining, dishonesty, complete failure on handling virus, juvenile name calling &amp; lack of responsibly on everything.
Why is it with celebrities and Democrats the sky is always falling? She is right this is an important election because if you’re scared more about the coronavirus then a Joe Biden presidency you are the problem

As person who prefers Republicans to democrats but likes Biden (the person) more than trump and sees both parties paying less attention to people with my views, I feel the only way I can make my voice heard is voting for someone else.Cops want strong leadership not a feckless buffoon.

Wrong, your boy has been trying for 40 years.
Though Biden has previously supported nationwide mask-wearing, he specified his call in remarks earlier Thursday, saying that every American should wear a mask when they're in public for the next three months "at a minimum" and every governor should make it a mandate immediately.
Nothing will stop me from voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
But the choice is one or the other.  A reasonable centrist vs an inept lying science rejecting person who is ruining our country.  BTW- the Biden suggestion for a mask mandate was for in public outdoor settings.

TIL (on Facebook) that the Biden Harris official platform is to destroy America, and the post was also #factchecked so it’s definitely true.
So is everybody just gonna forget how Harris spent the past year continuously harshing Biden? She has called him racist and has made it known that didn’t think he was mentally capable of handling the job. But I guess kissing up to the winner is what you do when you lose.
Thank god #Biden is out of the basement and spinning some shit against trump. #BidenHarris2020
Your og tweet certainly didn't sound like a "this is good strategy" tweet. It sounded like a "this is why Biden is good" tweet.
Qui pro Quo Joe Biden caved to pressure to pick a black female VP candidate...now that he had caved in from the far left liberals what else will he have in to.  They will kill American businesses with government regulations &amp; taxes, and will tax the working middle class.

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden picked U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, and the reaction is pouring in for the historic announcement.
I fucking hate Neo-liberals like Biden and Harris
Trump is not a racist, he has implemented laws to help blacks.  Unlike Joe Biden &amp; Democrats who grandstand for black votes, Trump walks the walk, not talk.
Amazing. Biden picks someone who challenged him. Look forward to a Cabinet meeting that doesn't look North Korean with all the slobbery praise. Trump is fucked and you know it.
I bet you would, then you’ll have someone, or in this case the same person to blame if Biden follows Hillary’s establishment campaign playbook and loses as well
Still voting Biden, I was unhappy to before, but I'm fucking depressed about it now. So many exceptional women, several of colour, and Biden goes with the cop who has an awful record in sentencing reforms, unjust penalties, and prison labor. Also iffy on LGBT.

Kamala Harris is the feds I cant rock with trump or Biden but this America always choosing between 2 bad candidates
I will be voting for Biden/Harris ONLY to get him out of office. However, I still think it’s critical to discuss the problems with them, and the DNC/democratic establishment. Them &amp; republicans are two sides of the same coin. They are all to the right. They are not progressive.
That's not his laptop either. That is a left handed persons laptop. Biden is right handed.

I'd love to hear what part of the federal response would have been clearly better under Biden.
I'm pretty skeptical of the idea that the COVID response would have been much better-- or even any better-- under Biden
Bernie, love you, but Biden has said multiple times he’d veto M4A if it crossed his desk. Having Kamala as his VP will not change that.

I do.  This will be a financial disaster for a lot of people if they don’t play football and I’m not buying that’s it’s our fault for not wearing masks like we should have.  That’s the next Joe Biden TV ad.
Liberals want to shut down the season so they can blame conservatives for the poor handling of the virus.  Look now we can’t have football because Trump didn’t handle this right.  These idiots wouldn’t wear masks and look now. It’s an ad for Biden.

Chip in to elect Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris!!!
Is there any racial or ethnic group that Joe Biden hasn't insulted yet?
🤣🤣dude your hilarious if you can see that please tell me why you agree with your president Admitting to grabbing girls crotch, Adding to putting children in cages, reping white powder and treason on so many levels. Gosh if I continue you might start liking Biden heck Obama 🤣
But Biden hates God  (I almost can’t type that out)
I am from NC and I will crawl over hot coals in a snow storm with Aliens threatening me to vote for Joe Biden!
Hmmm well considering I'm already under the influence of leadership that already feels that way about me, I should be able to just get comfortable huh. I should be use to it. I mean heck do I really have a choice. Same song different singer✌ But Biden stays in tune
Search it again.  If you can vote for Joe Biden for President, your conscience needs some work.
THE POINT IS BIDEN RIGHT FROM THE BEGINING IS THE WRONG GUY FOR AMERICA!
O M G This idiot just lies non-stop. Again with the 'fact' that the country has made billions from China bc of the tariffs. Outright lies about the Democrat (Joe Biden) Platform. For starters it is far less progressive than the majority of citizens want. #M4A, #legalizeit
WHERE IS OBAMA, BIDEN, FARAKAN AS THE KILLING IN CHICAGO ESCALATES. THEY ARE HYPOCRITES!!! AT WHAT POINT DOES THE RIGHTS OF THE LAW ABIDING TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER THE  VIOLENT THUGS, ANTIFA???
Maybe President Biden can exile Trump to South Dakota as condition of pardon, and while there he can effectively disappear from our present and past memories as he nears obscurity.
Still statue worthy - better that dog than Trump (or Biden)
Of course China would prefer Joe Biden so they could manipulate him and go back to the old corrupted way, quid pro quo, my friends.
😂😂😂 nice try Biden. Democrats are the ones that want it. You truly do have dementia don't you?
I'm waiting for Biden to reenact this. #Biden #Trump2020 #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
I'd rather have Biden than a friend of a Falwell
I'm Joe Biden and I approve of PPP as a word when I use the potty
I'm Joe Biden and I approve of Viagra
My name is Joe Biden and I'll cut your nuts off Joe Rogan
My name's Joe Biden and I have approve of this Chitterlings were great when I was a boy growing up in England with Corn Pop on Sundays and momma said Joe you go beat up that neighbor boy who took my panties off the internet
Whatever your ridiculous answer is he’s had 3 1/2 years to be prepared for what he said Obama and Biden weren’t prepared for. No excuses in the American people know it thank God
Biden’s make up score
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU YOU STILL HAVE IDIOTS THAT FOLLOW YOUR IDIOCY AND LIES, PEOPKE WAKE UP, YOU ARE NOT VOTING FOR OLD BIDEN, YOY ARE VOTING FOR A LEFT AGENDA!
True but at the same time Biden and his past policies and his present bumbles say what I said to begin with
Joe Biden=Reconstruction President
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
constantly lies about EVERYTHING and  stays silent.  Biden makes speaking "gaffe" and
You can't be a devout Catholic (Biden) &amp; be a liberal Democrat. It's HIPOCRISY if you believe in ABORTION.
Think its pretty obvious Biden looks down on the Black community
Whatever you say CW.  Should I assume that since you support Biden, you enjoy sniffing little girls hair?  If you don't agree with CW, you ain't black?  Keep painting with your broad brush.
This article is so irresponsible. Trump is dangerous and mentally unfit, and there is no one that Biden could pick as his VP that would in any way shape or form justify not voting for him over Trump.
Is it better? Biden’s age is the reason everyone is stressing his VP. Normally it’s to satisfy a large demographic, in this case, it’s really to step in and become President when the time arises. Who he chooses will decide the Presidency!
I see many voters sitting this 1 out. Biden’s whole campaign is “ I’m not Trump! “ Biden turns 78 in Nov. I wouldn’t want a 78 yr. old driving me in a car, much less running the country! There will be backlash, but Dems need to blame themselves! They had 4 years to groom a champ!
The left uses every trick in the book to keep Biden off that stage with Trump! They come up with every lie and excuse to keep him away from Trump!  Biden is mentally impaired...America isn't fooled! Biden smells of fear!
What are you complaining about Joe Biden things black Americans don't think but all the same
Yeah Joe Biden is nothing but a puppet
Imagine we pay for flying this creature everywhere,  hi auto, his advance team, his secret service team, the 2 other planes w nuclear codes and backup. All to hear him say Biden is hurting God. You racist MF that still support this evil abomination. God bless your hearts
Probably. But, few of us are fundamentally persuadeable, right? Regardless of which party/which candidate we prefer. Like the few % who may vote Biden but might have  voted Trump over Bernie. Which is why the Dems blocked Bernie, but are pushing Biden 2 run on Bernie's views.
Is he talking about Biden or John Lennon?  Either way count me in.
C'mon Eric... why drag  and  on this?  is getting sh-tcanned for 'Darling  (&lt;-- see what I did there?) once Biden announces his VP candidate. And Kayleigh will 3 or 4 Press Secretaries in the past and writing her memoir by then....
Biden: Blacks all think the same way
"I support BLM. I support the removal of the statue of liberty, it represents racism and oppression. If elected president on day 1 I will sign legislation for its immediate removal." Joe Biden     Think about that America, vets.But you still weren’t sure you’d vote for Biden unless you liked the VP pick? OK, then.
Mass has supermajorities in both houses and they could have made Baker pick a Dem.  I wish Warren would have won and would have been picked but I don't think the moment gave Biden the room to pick her. I would bet he wanted to.
My patience with the Obama/Jarrett/Clinton/Pod Save America wing of the democratic party has worn paper thin in the last few years and this is a good summary of why.
I don’t care how you feel about Biden/Harris. You should be helping to scrub the orange stains off the white walls
I would never suggest that, nor did I imply it.  I loathe Trump.  I am voting Biden and I will put my body in the line of fire when the coup comes.  But I am talking to you about our leaders, who are failing us.  Don’t defend them.
Electoralism can no longer save us.  Biden will not protect us.  Only direct mass action and a #GeneralStrike will stop fascism
In the wake of Sen. Harris’s nomination as Biden’s VP, what is the Trump campaign doing to reach out to Black voters?  talks w/ NPR White House reporter  on the latest “Tested":  (📷 by Madeline Gray)
How much you want to bet?  The only ones caught have been REPUBLICANS.  Projecting again, you Trumpers are good at it.  Should have known what was coming when started the whole Biden sniffing hair thing.  NOW WE KNOW TRUMP HAS CHILD RAPE CHARGES.
Biden has been in DC since 1973.   Just think about that- it's the only "job" he's ever had.

The DNC and Jill Biden are horrible people putting Joe Biden in this position.  He is clearly mentally deteriorating ever week.
I'm more concerned by her limited qualifications and "on the record" opposition with Biden.   In addition, Biden excluded 93% of the population by using race &amp; gender as a prerequisite for the job.  How is this acceptable??
3 new national polls of registered voters were released today, with Biden leading by 10, 11 &amp; 13 points, all taken before the Harris VP announcement. Now you know why Trump is illegally destroying the USPS &amp; attacking voting by mail.
This is a really good piece by  about the Obama-Biden relationship, which was always a lot more complicated and tense than the fantasy version of it.
Ideally this won't be resolved this year, and with no leadership and voiding all the horrible things done, we can have a humane approach in the Biden/Harris administration.
The latest poll from NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist finds that:  📈 Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by 11 points. 📊 71% of Americans see the coronavirus as a real threat. 📉 35% of Americans say they won't get vaccinated.  More analysis here:
these articles are probably very useful for biden and kamala herself, who probably never thought to check into her eligibility
Harris is an empty suit, along with Biden. She's a pathological liar.
Harris is an empty suit, along with Biden. She's a pathological liar. Amazing that the people running for the highest office in the land, do not know how the position even works? God helps us all!!
Trump has been in office 3 years.  Biden has been in office 48 years.  What make you think Biden will do something now?   Albert Einstein : “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” ...  Say no to Joe!
Good point. I think conclusions about not having a policy mandate are difficult to make in polls that demand only one response. This one simply shows that getting Trump out of office is the highest priority for Biden voters.
Not sure you can reach this conclusion from a poll that requires you to select only one response. Getting Trump out of office is the highest priority for those voting for Biden. Full stop.
Trump, Biden tied in NC heading into this month’s nominating conventions #ncpol
Kamala supports forced gun confiscation. Choosing her has moved the Biden campaign further to the left on gun control – more radical than any other major party campaign in recent history. Kamala’s baggage has damaged the perception that Biden is a more moderate Democrat. #2A
As a survivor of CSA and rape, I am FAR more offended by this adult woman’s interactions WITH A CHILD than I am by anything Joe Biden has ever been proven to have done with anyone. She *deliberately* and continually crossed lines with this kid. That’s appalling.
TBC - "GO VOTE" means any way that doesn't rely on the mail delivering stuff. Biden better fix the USPS - one of our great institutions.
I think if we frame it as an anti-Republican thing that would help Biden we could fool them into supporting it
But it doesn’t matter if Biden loses 10% because of voter suppression. Trump can win this if nothing is done about him blocking voting from every direction.  With what I see, I think Trump will “win” and this is all so depressing.
Girl, from your lips to Gods ears! So exhausted for all of us. Biden/Harris makes me believe again that good will triumph over evil. Let’s right this ship!

All of a sudden this week I've had an overwhelming urge to donate money to Joe Biden.
Tell Biden &amp; Kamala I said good luck with that.  They will need more people.  A lot more people.
Hahahaha I do not, and I truly hate that🤢🤢. But I suppose it’s not good to generalize the millennials either. Just upset about the Biden situation
I didn't address "It's always politics with Donnie."  Look at Joe Biden. Harris.. really?? Always politics with you Democrats, anything to win.  Burn the Country down to win.  We love Trump because Trump loves America. Trump is a Patriot. He puts America 1st. So FO you communist.
Perhaps but I feel like the ones that I personally know are very excited about this Biden situation and tend to lean more center. But again I cannot speak for every millennial. Will read though
I have my 2008 Obama one still on the car! But the very minute I learned that Biden had chosen Kamala Harris, I sent off for a Biden Harris sticker! I was so demoralized after Hillary lost, then I took that sticker off pretty quickly.
Besides Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, whose convention speech are you most excited to hear?
Trump should debate Biden 3 times and the fourth debate against Kamala since she’ll be governing
Right.  Trumps been in public office for 3 years.  Joe Biden has been in public office for 48 years.  Do nothing Joe.  Except make his family rich.
yeah me too, don’t get me wrong.  I am voting Biden.  But I do believe we need to push them to be better when we can
Biden-Harris merch PSA!  A cap has been added.  Thank you.
I’m a religious voter and I got NO problem with either Biden or Harris.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks...power hungry fools
Glasses fogging up. Was he also moved by the announcement that Kamala would join Biden on the ticket?
Question:  Kamala Harris ran in the primary all last year, and she's been the frontrunner for Biden's running mate ever since he got the nomination.  How are the Republicans SO unprepared for her?  Did they convince themselves that Biden would pick Warren?
Biden is a racist. I concur.
This should be enough to push NC to Biden in the 538 model, no?
New  poll has Biden +1 in NC, Cal +3, Cooper +10.
Nuclear reactor accident followed by leaked letter showing Biden pushed to get it up and running back in the 70s.
Let’s be clear, if you don’t vote because you don’t agree with Biden’s pick. YOU ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP.
Since we are comparing circumstances, Bernie wasn’t a realistic alternative after Super Tuesday. The momentum shifted and Biden clearly claimed victory. Polling and votes were against him.
I'm less concerned by her temperament than her qualifications.  In addition, Biden excluded 93% of the population by using race &amp; gender as a prerequisite for the job.  How is this acceptable?
Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's newly minted running mate, told The  Politics Podcast last year that the next DOJ would have "no choice" but to act.  Biden has said that pursuing criminal charges against Trump would be "a very, very unusual thing."
"Americans are accustomed, still, to discussing the notion of a woman in power in terms of toleration and palatability."
Are they threatening Biden? Are they asking others to do their dirty work? The network should reprimand them. This is not news nor opinion.
Ironic that you meanly label Biden in this Tweet calling out meanness and condescension. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
You can't possibly believe this- right?   Who is "excited" about a 78 year old career politician who has been in DC for 47 years!  This is the best the Dems have to offer?   Close race for sure but Trumps base is strong and Biden/Harris doesn't energize anyone.  4 more yrs..
via  A reckoning for the meritocracy is coming.
Kamala Harris prosecuted trump/pence yesterday in stark, definitive terms.  She laid out the failures of trump point by point. Her statements were precise, accurate and by trump/pence reactions afterwards devastating. Congratulations Senator Harris.  Biden/Harris 2020
Joe Biden is utterly pathetic. Can’t even operate an iPhone correctly...AND he *needs a script* to offer his running mate the second most important job in the world!   #BidenHarris2020 #SleepyJoeAndTheHoe2020 #dementia
Yes, dead guy, Biden has been inconsistent, as opposed to  who has consistently been a racist and bigot his entire life.  Thank you, dead man...

What difference does it make if she is black or white.  She is well qualified for the job and I'm excited Biden picked her.
Yeah I think you’re probably right, sadly.  I’ll vote for her and Biden, just wish she hadn’t taken money from all the worst people in our society
We got a new stainless fridge in January and I haven’t re-magged it yet. I’m torn between maintaining the aesthetic of having new, matching appliances for the first time in my life, and restoring the awesome chaos of my crap. I think a Biden/Harris magnet could break the tie.
Would love to see him assigned to dismantle DHS, and eliminate ICE, in a Biden-Harris administration.  That’s a real wish.
Most recent polls in NC have Trump edging out Biden.  No.  Where are my #NC voters at? We need to organize and strategize.  Because I'll be damned if Trump is winning my state.  And his lapdog Tillis has to go also.  #DudeGottaGo

Joe Biden Commercial: He didn't tweet about it. He just did it.   Me: CAN'T RELATE
I’m going all in this year, and saying yes, the national spread will be 15+ and yes, Biden/Harris will carry Montana. And Alaska.  They raised $20 million in the 24 hours since the VP announcement and crashed the merch site multiple times.  All in.
No, it wasn’t dangerous in the least hahahahaha   Nothing Obama did weighs on Biden. Biden is his own person.
47 years of zero and I mean zero accomplishments. He's had 1 job his entire life.  What new and fresh ideas will Biden bring to the table??   Stock market will hit an all time high this week.  TRUMP
He is an absolute sellout; and Biden has zero dignity
Biden is absolutely screwed
No, 3+ years apart.  However, Biden has been milking America for 47 years! Numb nuts...
Trump shouldn’t even be allowed to run. He’s. Heated the entire time staring w/Giuliani digging up dirt on Biden in Ukraine, to Kushner colluding with Kanye for a bogus ballot run and Trump slowing down the postal service. He’s a dirt bag and a cheat!
I have a bunch of examples of what Biden has done and said—none of them positive. I remember, even though he probably doesn’t. 😉
Exactly! Someone (political blue check) said a desperate candidate asks for more debates. Hoping Biden denies and he can attack him for it? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Biden has nothing to gain by debating Trump. Nothing at all. He's already in the lead. When someone asks for an additional debate (the Trump camp just did) it means they know their candidate is tanking. That said, Trump won't do any, let alone four.
"He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground." -  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I was sad for about 10 days after Warren dropped out of the race.   Then I dusted myself off and put on my big boy boots, because Trump is that bad.   If you need to be spoon fed reasons to vote for Biden-Harris, you're less reasonable than my toddler.
But Sanders endorses Biden. By that logic, he also isn’t a progresssive.
Yeah the OP wasn’t disputing that.  The point is that Biden was handsy with women and that made Reade more plausible.  Morse has no comparable, visible record of misconduct.  There is a really obvious difference there
While stricter gun control measures have at times been a major part of Harris’ campaign platforms, the issue was barely raised at Wednesday's press conference.
I was genuinely impressed by Biden and Harris modeling social distancing at this event. I know it’s a formality, but that’s the point. Leaders *should* model proper public health behavior. It matters!  I also love that they’re selling Biden/Harris masks.
How do you top the words of Biden and Harris which sounded like a beautiful symphony in contrast.
Milli Vanilli would be an appropriate analogy for Biden and Harris. 100% fake and full of poo.
Just in case you forgot Joe Biden will be 78 in November.
that would be great, i hope they do.  Biden’s current plan doesn’t even restore the tax rate to the (low) level it was at under Obama
Sure that could happen...but why doesn't Biden win MS then, not to mention NC.  (Or OH for that matter.)
What a delight to think of all the highly competent people who could be part of the Biden administration
Okay, sure Trump could win NH...but how does Biden win LA at the same time...while not winning MS...but winning GA...and not winning NC???
Biden doing a great job of singing Kamala’s praises as he introduces her now on CNN...

Any minute now, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will appear in Wilmington, Delaware, at their first event together. Don't miss their show-stopping opening duet on "Ain't No Mountain High Enough." It's sure to be amazeballs.
I like the way you think. But I also think Biden can win Montana and Alaska, so I may be a touch too exuberant.
gahhhh... i want to watch this Biden Harris unity rally  with people who are fired up!   Stinks to have to socially distance

Biden &amp; Harris are not progressive enough. They have both done awful things. I’m disappointed that Biden is the Democratic Party candidate and that Harris is his chosen VP.   But I am still voting for them. And I think you should too.
So what? The dispute is not that the prosecutor was corrupt; the point is that Biden was on the take, so he pushed the firing for his own personal ulterior motives

Today's rule: every person who yaps about how Joe Biden is "building a bridge" should go watch "The Bridge on the River Kwai" to see how well the bridge building thing worked out for Alec Guinness. "Madness! Madness!" (Actually, just call quits on today &amp; watch a great film.)
Trump’s failure to contain COVID has absolutely cratered the economy. Not talking about numbers on Wall Street. Talking about people’s lives, and jobs!  Voting for Biden, and Harris.
I mean is he supposed to openly disparage the nominee and vp pick because he lost? Or is he smart and understands that it will be far easier to get movement on his agenda under Biden/Harris than Trump/Pence? Idk what this tweet changes?
Biden could have picked Donald trump jr as his running mate and I’d still have to vote for him, why does anyone care who it is
It goes so far out of bounds. He is supposed to be apolitical. Talk about bias. He needs to resign. He needs to be held accountable even after Biden wins.
Biden struggles with green or red jello.  He didn't pick Harris.
Well best of luck in the election then. I hope Biden and his disaster of a pick will make you proud 🤣🤣🤣  You don’t look long for this world, however. So perhaps whether Trump wins or not (he’s going to win in a landslide), you won’t have to endure him.
Well, why don’t you ask the President of Ukraine? He just named Biden as an accused party in a crime yesterday. 😃
Crucial thread. Look we have to vote Biden/Harris- but we also have to know exactly who we’re electing. Harris is pro-police, pro-war, pro-corporation &amp; has voted to further oppression of BIPOC Americans COUNTLESS times. Ethnicity &amp; gender do not a hero make.
I love how excited Kamala Harris’s colleagues are about her selection as Joe Biden’s running mate. People who worked with her back in the day and people who work with her now have all said how great she is.   It’s nice to have candidates who just know how to work as a team.
I much rather prefer #HeelsUpHarris, with no mention of Biden. He’s as lost from this ticket as are his marbles. 🤣🤣
I willlllllll...NOT be voting for the Biden/#HeelsUpHarris ticket!   #Trump2020 #KAG2020 #TrumpTrain

That 17 year old who hacked Joe Biden’s account for a Bitcoin scam should have announced his Vice President instead. Huge missed opportunity
why couldn't we have this race instead of the lame one we're stuck with?  Also we should run Hunter Biden on the Green Party so it's a 3 way brawl
This reads like a Biden interview
I’m backing Biden and Harris 2020.
And more good news for Biden and women voters today. Biden has an amazing 31% lead over Trump among women nationally in Monmouth poll (pre-Harris announcement).
Was I confident that Biden could win Texas? Not really.  Am I confident that #BidenHarris2020 can win Texas? Hell, yes.
Derp!  Here’s where you can donate to the Biden-Harris campaign, everybody.
Could you imagine what 45 would say about and do to a person (i.e. a black woman) who harshly challenged him on the debate stage? I’ll tell y’all one thing - he sure as hell isnt picking that person as his VP. Say what you will, but this says a lot about Biden’s character.
Joe Biden ran two campaigns before even winning a primary.
Ready to vote now for Biden/Harris. Hurry up November 3rd!
I guess you have this because Biden’s info is available while Trump’s is secret. Shame on you.
lmao if they think Biden and Harris are far-left
Biden already has one more person than trump does that'll call him on his bullshit and he's only filled one position.
Kamala got the Republicans out here accidentally campaigning for Biden.
I guess he should've cared what Biden said.
The Biden campaign equates socialists and plutocrats fo gods sake
This strategy is gonna backfire. Painting Biden and Harris as "radical left" is just gonna help turn out the far-left Democrats.
Biden-Harris👍for me. + AG Adam Schiff to BRING THE PAIN after 3+ years to 45 and  who are tied sloppy close with a “cord of steel”. The real Super Bowl is probs not happening. THIS is the righteous Super Bowl of our era. See ya in court, then prison,
Absolutely...there’s no way out for him, Biden, Wray, Comey, etc...
My daughter (21) has said she doesn't want a Biden sticker on our car. 🙄 Little does she know, I was just waiting for the #BidenHarris stickers to become available. Ordered one today. 🤣🤣🤣 (Yes, she's voting for them.)
Third, she’s qualified and competent for the position, and will be a good leader if Biden has to step down for something like a medical issue. Finally, it’s depressing that people continue to try and divide us, on the left and the right. What we need is unity, not division.
It pisses me off that people are saying “Kamala’s bad bc she’s a cop!” First of all, she was a prosecutor, and prosecuted people according to the laws in place. Secondly, nominating her damaged the Trump argument that Biden’s soft on crime and will let antifa destroy cities. 1/2
Biden is obviously anti-yo-semitic, too.
Biden Harris zoom background? 🤣
Watch, like and Retweet!  Biden in 2008...
Why are people so mad that Biden picked Kamala bc she was a former prosecutor. She did her job and convicted people of crimes. Crime is bad. I don’t see why this is so controversial
Is it too soon to make the “Kamala Harris is to Biden what Cheney was to Bush” take????
We have an actual lunatic as president and y’all want to say you’re not voting because he didn’t pick your favorite?   4 more years of Trump is a hell of a lot worse than 4 of Biden/Harris
President Trump just broke it down... #HeelsUpHarris 👠👠 was the meanest, most disrespectful person towards Justice Kavanaugh and then VP Biden during the primaries.
. just said with certainty that Biden-Harris will face Trump-Pence in the general election.  WE DON'T KNOW THAT UNTIL TRUMP CONFIRMS HIS VP PICK for upcoming election.  Which he has not.
We will vote for Biden/Harris BECAUSE she “was nasty to Brett Kavanaugh” in your words.
Harris is such the right pick. I was worried honestly that Biden would feel outclassed next to her and run away. Cudos to him for making the choice.
Great, historic choice! I’m so thrilled that Kamala Harris is Biden’s pick for VP! (And yes, for pete’s sake, I know that’s Maya Rudolph below. Did you see the movie CHiPs? Harris was in that. Rudolph took over as attorney general of California during filming. Facts matter!)
Could’ve had Bernie and we ended up with biden and kamala aint that some shit
Again, it’s politics. You eill a candidate that will add to the ticket and bring more voters. It’s a game of numbers not a correctness. Plus she is the best to run with Biden based on the climate.
How would Lester feel if Biden asked him if he took a cocaine test?
Democrats will capture the White House and Congress too. Just watch now, Excellent choice of VP by Joe Biden
Don't make Biden snap his fingers in a Z formation
That didn’t take long.  Trump and the GOP will spend every one of the next 84 days lying and distorting the records of both Biden and Harris.  Let’s get to work.
Great pick Joe Biden. We have a winner now. Great news.
If everything goes well, Joe Biden/Kamala Harris will be President for the next twelve years.
I am pretty sure the DNC and Biden violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  Not only did he discriminate about race but also sex.    I wonder if he asked her about her sexial orination?   The trifecta of discrimination!
Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his running mate.. I’m just excited for her to never let him get away with any type of backwards ish again 😤 (anything she deems backwards anyway, but that’s another conversation) #JoeBiden #KamalaHarrisForVP #FirstBlackVP
I know the thought of burning it all down seems glamorous, but if you burn it while Trump is in charge, the left is going to be caught in the fire and we set ourselves back and we put so many vulnerable people at risk. Vote Biden/Harris and then hold them accountable.
For people who talk a lot about privilege and self-reflection, there’s a lot of tantrum-throwing among the left. TRUMP IS A FUCKING FASCIST. Don’t be dumb. Vote for Biden/Harris. We aren’t going to achieve our leftist utopia this decade.
SAME! I'm not really interested in watching the Biden vs Trump debates, but am so stoked to watch Kamala eviscerate Mike Pence
So, Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris, it seems. I think this is a good choice and glad he picked a Black woman. Let's do this thing!!
I think the Biden campaign store has crashed. Too many of us trying to buy #BidenHarris2020 merch!
An emphasized big reason for swing/free-thinking Repub voters to vote for Biden &amp; ex-AG/Sen Harris over Trump is to "restore the rule of law". It's an amazing day in America when this is a big reason to vote Dem over the Repub #ncpol
Vote! You know other favorites like Elizabeth Warren and Susan Rice will have prominent positions in the Biden administration. But you need to vote!!!
I dunno, Trump has been posing about how much he wants to debate Biden. But you may be right that they'll come up with some excuse to avoid it. Trump may not want to have it made clear by contrast that Biden is not as feeble as he makes out.
Kamala ❤️ Harris ❤️ Biden-Harris ❤️ We will win this!
Kamala isn’t my favorite at all but I knew Biden wasn’t going to pick anyone whose policies align with mine. I have given up on the idea that I will be excited to vote this year lol the only goal in November is to vote out Trump... that is it lol
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate - CNNPolitics
We are ready! We stand with Biden/Harris! So proud to have a strong woman on the ballot.
Imagine. A world where our president recognizes their weaknesses, doesn’t let personal disagreements get to him, and picks the best person for the job even if they disagree at times.  The fact that Trumpites just see this as Biden getting ownd says so much about their politics.MORE LIES: Joe Biden Praises Israel-UAE Peace Deal and Takes Credit for the Deal He Had Nothing to Do with and Can't Remember  via

Vote for Biden. Look at it as (at least) a step forward and not more steps backward. Think: humanity over politics.
President Bush needs to endorse Joe Biden.  #HumanityOverPolitics
Did we forget that Biden wrote the 1994 Crime Bill that led to the MASS incarceration of black people and he DEFENDED this bill last in 2016 saying it "restored american cities"
Did we forget thar Biden has been coined a long time supporter of law enforcement, who advocated for increased police funding for "reform" in response to the Ferguson protests?
Did we all forget? Did we forget that there were tanks in Ferguson, MO while Biden was VP? Did we forget that rubber bullets were being shot at protestors while Biden was VP? Did we forget that the department of justice ruled Michael Brown not a victim, while Biden was VP?
Yes you’re right, excuse the pun but hussein obama golfed more than tiger woods!! LOL 😆!! Trump takes care of business unlike the failures of the hussein obama and biden administration!! LOL 😆!!
Ima vote for Biden
Their idea of “leadership” is a socialist dictator style leadership. Biden said “It’s not about your rights.” That pretty much sums up the Democrat Party.
“Sacrificing humanity and morality to get a conservative judge is not moral,” she says. ‘Gerrymandering a district so you get a conservative elected is not moral.’  ‘I was really beaten up,’ adds Lemel. ‘Because I didn’t want to wear red and cheer for an idiot.’”  #ncpol #Biden

Hussein Obama played more golf then tiger woods his self!! With 8 years of failures and corruption as in a coup!! First guilty admission!! Yes more coming to all the criminals in the hussein obama administration, Biden , spoiled little hunter!! Liberals are all living n MANSIONS
Promises made, Promises kept!! I knew you would be Great In business, that’s why I voted for you the first time ! You wasn’t a politician that lied for 50 years of failures like biden, komila and the rest of liberals! You’ve broken records that no one believed you would!GREAT JOB
I think Romney would be well suited to be Secretary of State in a Biden administration.
Oh, Biden is still embarrassing. Absolutely. But on a much more amateur level than Trump.
I think even a lot of the GOP legislators silently would prefer him to 4 more years of Trump. Biden is someone they can work with, and knows everybody has to walk away from the table with something they need for their constituents.
Won’t be long before all the woke ppl will be reposting anti Biden/Kamala propaganda from fake Russian social media accounts.  will be a former Grand Wizard of the KKK and  will be Uncle Toms granddaughter by November just like they did to
HRC is dreaming.  If she gets a cabinet position under Biden, look for another “Vince Foster move”.   The battle between HRC &amp; KH while Biden is President would be epic. The kibitzing between Bill Clinton &amp; Obama will also be epic.

So by that flawed logic, we should be equally concerned, disappointed, disgusted... by the endorsement of Biden/Harris by the US Postal Workers union.
I have an option not to cast a vote.  If you feel Biden doesn’t have  years of racism in his 40 years in office then check his record.   II don’t vote based on anyone else”s beliefs Live your truth and don’t judge others ❤️
Every single Joe Biden commercial on my fucking TV is about the pandemic. These Democrat governors are 100% sandbagging opening and making it seem worse than it is. This is their platform.
Why is Biden on there!?!?
My thoughts exactly!
Get over it and vote for Biden!
Nothing you or Biden have proposed would improve the situation. Trump has advocated reopening the schools and the economy precisely to help those who are out of work and allow kids to get an education. Lockdown and wear masks until we have a vaccine is not a strategy.
She's staying in the Senate and watching you Biden and Harris 🧐.
Pretty sure NBA folks in the bubble had done much worse in regards to Trump
Same here, even if I have to camp out.  I’m going to witness my vote for Joe Biden enter that machine!
It drives him nuts that nothing sticks against Biden. Joe Biden has been in public life for an eternity. People just don't buy the attacks on him. People don't associate those things with Biden.
This is a pretty revealing tweet. He just can't accept that Biden can't be pinned down so easily like Clinton.
I'm planning to vote for Biden but I don't think the last 20 years would have been much different if Gore had won. Doubt this argument will convince anyone who actually thinks Biden and Trump are equivalent.

Masks narrative is about 1 thing - protecting #Biden from campaigning. If they work we should be able to go to sporting events, keep prisoners behind bars, send all kids to school. But he needs to hide in his #basement &amp; let his handlers tweet for him because we know he can’t
Biden campaign had better be working a strategy as well!
The top two candidates in the primary elections should be on the Presidential and Vice Presidential ticket- since those two candidates represent the majority of the voters. Therefore it should’ve been Biden and Sanders.
Please don't post Biden Gifs on my timeline... 🤣🤣🤣
And still KKK endorses Trump and all racists rally behind him..strange that your Biden is the secret racist attacks don't work when he was the running mate of first black man to be president and his running mate is going to be the first black woman to be vice president..hmm..

Vote for Biden then, is that the option?
This is the exact thing I called out today.
Don’t worry, just pull up Biden’s eulogizing Robert Byrd, a former Grand Master in the KKK.  Biden said a lot of nice things about Byrd....
If that's all it took to nullify your vote for Biden then maybe you weren't all that rogue to begin with and just another phony Republican acting as if they don't like Trump.

Gee I wish there was nuance on this site to be able to voice a legit criticism of Biden without getting screamed at about how Trump is worse. As if that fact makes the criticism invalid.

Great  blog here. You shouldn't listen to anyone who says they're going to push Biden to the left during his presidency if they're telling you to keep your mouth shut now

Literally everyone on here has stated ON HERE we are voting for Biden.  Maybe you are used to stealing other people's ideas at work and not giving them credit???? Who cares as long as you land the big account, right?
It's funny how Biden and Harris have flip-flopped on everything they once believed in, including each other. You don't think they'd trade people like they've traded values? They hold nothing dear, except power.

Absolutely! However! Biden has no Memory! Dementia or Selective Memory?

You should do what is best for the country and vote for Joe Biden. You should also vote BLUE for your Senator and your Congressman - without all three, it will be more of the same. You want to keep voting GOP, do it for your state offices - but please, vote Dem for federal. TY
Biden lost that vote during the duration of his whole career. I can’t believe lesser evilists are so entitled about this. Biden never had my vote during 2020 or the last 4 years.
When you &amp; George Bush came out and endorsed Biden recently, did you not think that we’d put two and two together to come to the conclusion that you both, somewhere along the way, became part of the deep state Democrat corruption?  Do you that poorly of law abiding Americans?
A lot of what is on your list us what Biden is now supporting, tRUMP is a Koch puppet which is a hell of a lot worse than Bloomberg!
You are the reason #IMPOTUS may win because you are so hung up on Bernie not getting the nomination that you are willing to bite off your own nose to spite your face. Bernie is supporting Biden so get over it!

She’s certainly capable of answering questions.  Seems they are both being quiet so Biden doesn’t look bad by giving bizarre answers or leaving all answers up to Harris.  So strange he’s the nominee.

Thanks for the shoutout! 🌊💃🏻
The lefts position for as many elections as I can remember has been that if the GOP wins, life as the left knows it is over.  Harken back to 2012, Biden commenting on Mitt Romney "They're going to put you all back in chains."    So get out with your "partisanship" BS.
npr feeling saucy today.  let's see how they do on calling out the lies of biden of harris.
Does the law matter? If there's a question, then it needs to be vetted. If she is disqualified, then she shouldn't be able to run for the office. If qualified, then she runs. What's the problem? Other than Biden's people should have vetted her ALREADY.

I wish I could do Biden's debate prep.
I mean there’s no denying that he’s incompetent. You could argue Joe Biden isn’t the best candidate, but at least he’ll put the right people in charge.
Every time I see Biden, he reminds me of what people look like in a casket and it makes me feel uneasy.

So I guess you won’t be voting for Biden either?  Why can’t the Democrats have a better candidate? What is an Independent to do?
Here is a not insane response.   Dems are already wearing a mask, so we are perfectly comfortable with the 3 MONTH period Biden called for and hope the rest of the country will join in.   Liberals didn't close schools/football, it was educators who understand the health risk.
Biden handlers will no longer let Joe dress himself
Are people that short sighted? Voting in THIS election is simply about preserving the republic.  Biden/Harris are not perfect, but if/when they are elected, we will live to fight another day. Trump is RIGHT now moving to steal the election. He needs to be stopped.

Kamala “phony” Harris might just be the worst pick Biden could’ve made.  She’s pissed off so many people &amp; thats why she dropped out of the Presidential race before the 1st primary vote even occurred.  And she’ll be President. Democrats wake the F up.  You’re being played.

Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
Clearly an over sample of blue states and if unskewed turns out 97% of Americans prefer to starve and lose their homes than let Biden and Harris give them health care and an Obama phone
So the  poll (CPD used in 2016) released today asks about Biden and Trump and does NOT mention any other candidate. So when  hides behind their arbitrary requirement of 15% to participate in a debate, just remember, THEY AREN’T EVEN ASKING ABOUT OTHER CANDIDATES!
Biden, Harris Want To Force Schools To Let Biological Males into Girls' Sports
Trying to figure out who’s more mentally deranged ... you ... or  U.S PRESIDENT TRUMP: “AT EVERY TURN, BIDEN HAS BEEN WRONG ABOUT THE VIRUS - IGNORING THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE”
Thinking of starting a PAC - NC Republicans for Biden. Need to get rid of this monster and his enablers (which includes you Senator Tillis).
Do that at the debate Mr President.  So the works can see.  Go on.  Avoid.  And then watch Vice President Biden answer every question in complete sentences and in complete honesty.  He was so flustered because he doesn’t know truth.
Joe Biden is also a bad representative of my values, but that’s another discussion. What about when trump restricts in person voting and congressional democrats do nothing but tweet and send letters on their way to yet another recess?
We need numbers great enough to transcend their creative and prolific malfeasance.     #PostalService  #USPSsabotage
Free infomercials?     Our local TV stations showed 4 interviews after Harris’s selection as the Democrat’s VP candidate.  They were nothing but non stop praise about her and Biden.
So Biden wants all Americans to wear masks for at least 3 months.....what is in 3 months? The election. #tinfoilhatthoughts
I saw a Trump commercial with a woman saying we can't rebuild if Biden is elected because he's too weak.  Biden should create, like a rap battle commercial response asking, "Now how did we get into this mess in the first place? Why exactly do we need to rebuild? Just asking?"
It’s very clear Biden said wear the masks for the next three months so that as soon as the election gets here they can say take the mask off and say it was their leadership that cured the country if they win. Just another ploy because one way or another Covid ends on November 3rd
Exactly. Their corruption is In Your Face, So What Are You Going To Do About It? It shakes your faith in people to know that so many voters will still vote for them in November. Biden's election is not a given.
Turn-out for Democrats exceeded 2016 and is on course to reach 2008 numbers.  Biden and Trump both got 18 million votes this year, but Democrats had 36 million total votes cast with a contested primary.  Biden wound up winning 51% of the vote.
Nobody's expecting Biden (or Trump) to fix all the world's problems. But it sure would be nice to have a President that wasn't actively making more!
Well for one nick cannon is a definite racist lol  but i mean obama picked joe biden as VP cause he was white so im pretty sure thats the only reason biden is picking kamala..and shes a women so even mor evotes
Very easily. Biden/Trump will focus on the NY/Calif voters, while not caring about the middle of the country. Why go to Nashville to get 500k votes when I can go to LA to get 5 million? Not getting into a political discussion but don't rewrite the constitution to benefit yourself
“And right after Reagan’s ‘wall’ speech, Biden again took the line that Reagan shouldn’t dare to provoke the Soviet bear.”  Sheesh...has Biden been right about ANY foreign policy decision?
No one even said they weren't voting for Biden in the thread so......????
We asked the public about a number of key federal and state races, but also surveyed their opinion on several political statements/slogans, such as: - Law and Order - Black Lives Matter - Defund the Police You can take a look at these results here.
If there is a fair election and the votes are all counted cleanly (big if), then Biden will win.  If Biden wins and Trump refuses to leave, then the US military is constitutionally bound, more than able, and will likely be very willing, to escort him out of the White House.
Biden &amp; Harris  Campaign 2020!
I hope this is incorrect! Professor who accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump
Dunno ... tell me  This scared the hell out of me ...
Yeah, even if Biden wins and Trump leaves (willingly or not), 2022 is going to be very challenging.
#ncpol On the same day   completes a poll showing Biden with a one percentage point lead.....
It’s hilarious that these people think Biden has any clue how to fast track an economic recovery. The first thing he will do is give away Nancy’s 3 Trillion dollars, then raise taxes by 4 Trillion while a ton of ppl are out of work. He’ll spend the SS money in his first month.
Biden can suck my balls
Historic, especially because so much ground had to be made because Obama &amp; Biden totally sold Israel up the river. Stabbed them in back
Joe Biden has never helped anyone other than his family. If you don't do anything it is virtually impossible to do anything wrong.
Honestly &amp; selecting Kamala for VP, completely solidified their stance with progressive politics/voters, Hispanic/Latino peeps, &amp; young voters. It’s honestly a shame. I can’t say I hope Biden loses but I do hope they find out how dumb it is to alienate such a large voting bloc.
Wow, just wow. Such a lie. Reagan had the longest peacetime recovery EVER. Obama and Biden destroyed the economy.  History revisionism will not work this time lady.  #reclaimingmytime
Republican voters, PLEASE force your representatives to have actual ideas and policies! Attacking the left is *not* a policy. "Biden wants to raise your taxes " Bleh - too easy. Why does he want to raise taxes? How much? Where will the $$ go? Make Haley prove it. Dig deeper.
I literally have been wondering who, if anyone, had been doing any leg work within the Biden camp to gain the Hispanic/Latino vote since Bernie dropped out and I’m pretty sure it’s no one.
I just hope if Biden becomes president ( and God I sure hope so) Kamala remembers she is vice president not the president.😉
Melania would just repeat Dr Jill Biden's answers
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate amid coronavirus pandemic
My 70 year old father is one of them.   Just like Joe Biden, he may have made some mistakes along the way, but he’s learned and is a good man.   I’m proud he is my father. 💕
When people say we can move Biden on policy, I always ask why do they expect Biden to move if you’re going to vote for him no matter what? It makes no sense.
The mass incarceration ticket of 2020 pledges unconditional support to Israel "unlike some Democrats." Interesting.  Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's VP pick - here's what Jewish voters should know - Jewish Telegraphic Agency  via
She's a hypocrite for calling Biden a racist and saying she believed the accusations against him SMH. She prosecuted over 1500 marijuana cases, but laughed when she was asked is she smoked. It's pathetic! Biden and her will be the incarcerating dream team.
Obama/Biden.  Hands down THE MOST CORRUPT administration in the history of our nation.  I don’t care what your politics are, open your eyes to what the Democrats have become past 20 years.  I used to be one of them.  Time for others to wake the hell up...they do nothing but lie.
Uhhhh..#Biden and #Obama already had 8 years to try to get this done but did not. #Fail
Did Biden say it would not help democracy to prosecute tRump? Oh yes hell it will sir. Along with each and every one of his criminal co-conspirators.
It should not be that close!!! Biden and Harris should be ahead by a landslide!!
🤣🤣🤣 they all puppets.. ima vote for Biden though
None of them. It’s all about JoJo!! #JoJorgensen2020 !!!! Voting for Biden or Trump is a vote for old racist sex offending pedophiles!!
People can ACTUALLY SUPPORT AND VOTE FOR KAMALA because she's QUALIFIED.. not just cause she's BLACK! BIDEN-HARRIS 2020
I'm watching VP Biden speak abt the virus. What a breath of fresh air! He makes sense, I CAN trust what he says &amp; he's not degrading his apponents by calling them names &amp; acting like a bully. He's acting like an adult &amp; leader. It's like someone we've known has finally come home.
I bet Biden's happy it's only 56%!
If you don't vote for Biden, and could otherwise vote and are not disabled/afflicted in some similar way, it helps Trump win. You are, therefore, a Trump supporter. Vote for Biden and bug the hell out of him if he wins.
I think you mean “Kamala Harris news conference”....because Joe Biden is just an empty vessel....
Obama had bipartisan cabinet. If Mitt Romney would just get some courage and come out for Biden I would have no objection to his being SecOfState--and it would also be a slap in face to Trump 😊
i dont think you cab be making fun of biden when your own idiot cant do the same
”If he wins, you’re going to end up with a disaster,” he claimed of Democratic rival Joe Biden."  No sense of the self-own.  Aren't we're in a disaster *right now* thanks in no small part  to your ineptitude?  Can we just skip ahead to Nov 3?
The  campaign appears to believe that Republicans can be trusted to vote by mail.  It's just Biden supporters that can't be trusted, I guess.
I'm pretty sure helping Black people wasn't in the job description packet Biden handed her.
Going to make calls for Biden to spite her now.
I'm going to go make calls for Biden to spite you, Naomi.
Anyone that believes Joe Biden writes his own tweets hasnt been paying attention.
Most of the U.S. government’s 200 immigration detention centers are run by private contractors holding asylum seekers and other immigrants accused of administrative violations or awaiting deportation.
You're forgetting how racist this version of the GOP has become. They could not conceive that Biden would actually choose someone who wasn't lily white to run with him, particularly someone as strong as Harris.
We all know thatTucker/Hannity have a huge draw nightly, and I've never contested that.  I'm saying lets look at the data on a day that Biden doesn't pick his VP in the 18-49 segment. We already know the NBA heavily outdraws all news in 18-49 demo by a landslide on a normal day.
I’m sure mlk would love Biden who is a bigot then and I’m sure he died so he could be voted for
That's great and all but please don't give the Biden administration a pass like you did for the Obama administration. If Trump taught us nothing else it's that when you ignore abuses from your side, they will be doubled down on by the other side.
There might not be any partisan differences in states that already use VBM, but if bluer states increase its use while reddish states do not, vote margins for Biden will increase.  He could win nationally by 7 million votes and yet lose in the EC.
Biden and Harris are the same as trump and Biden is a klansman who brought slave markets to Libya but these ppl against confederates got no issue with slavery we brought there
Trump will do far worse (and less) for this country than Biden but....they both suck. Politics is always choosing between the lesser of two evils. We need an ACTUAL change to the system. I’m sick of choosing between two shitty options.
And Mark responded that the data here is skewed to the topical news of Biden picking his VP. It's literally the first line in the summary of data on the link Clay provided.  But alas, its still apples and oranges, per my earlier point.
Kinda reminds me how Biden is strong enough to ride a bike, in a mask, in the summer.  Trump, on the other hand, is so unhealthy that he can barely walk down a ramp.   I would make sense that Biden might choose to get some exercise that would likely kill Trump.
vote for biden because you will be able to hold him accountable also please donot hold biden accountable because that is a vote for trump
I am afraid there is no more time to settle for these bullshit artists. Ecologically, sociologically, and financially Biden is the worst choice imaginable. It is time to quell this.
Joe Biden has welcomed progressive input in his campaign. Lefty activists are hoping Kamala Harris, his vice-presidential nominee, will be just as flexible,  reports:
Watch Joe Biden and Kamala Harris First Joint Campaign Event Here
It would help to get a commitment to a policy platform so we can hold them accountable.  So far in the last 48 hours Biden has backtracked on M4A by saying people will get free coronavirus treatment.  Dude what about after that?!?!
Obama/Biden: "Listen to scientific experts. Constantly reevaluate options." Trump/Pence: "The FDA is wrong. Listen to the demon-sperm lady. There are only two options: take Hydroxychloroquine or inject yourself with bleach."
Your tweets alone can cheer me up. I’m trying to find the collection of montages from the 25th Ammendment now. I’m sick of the orange clown saying Biden is not mentally fit. 4 some reason I think it was u who put them 2gether. I want 2 post them so bad on FB where the asses are!
Dear Nate, We are not joined at the hip. Biden hasn't done anything to earn a vote. He believes he is entitled. Most Bernie Bros were Independents, and lean towards 'green' policies and aid the working class. Biden ain't that.
Biden and Kamala..tough on crime but also on board with police reforms..that's what the country needs right now..but we need to push for more reforms and more crime prevention than prison filling..
Obama/Biden: "Do this." Trump/Pence: "Do the opposite of this."
Yes, yes, yes.This, to me, is job one for the Biden-Harris administration.
Biden owns a gun
The August #CivitasPoll is out! Some important numbers that reveal a couple of very tight races.   Trump/Biden: 44%/45%  Tillis/Cunningham: 38%/41%  Cooper/Forest: 49%/39%  #ncpol
Clearly you’re not interested, I just don’t really care. “Lol Dr. Jill Biden had no ‘porn pics’” jokes are sex shaming and obnoxious. Comments about people being less-than because they don’t have a college degree are elitist.
This country is a mess. As a Conservative, I want a guaranteed, accurate election. In person or absentee with Verified ID. There is too much division and distrust on both sides for any mail in nonsense. And if we LEGITIMATELY elect Biden, then so be it. I’ll do what I have to.
Joe Biden is an idiot! 😡😡
Another reason to vote for Biden

Biden and trump are the same to me so I’m not about to waste energy arguing over a rigged system, this is why ppl don’t vote
Still having trouble in #NorthCarolina getting anyone on the left to bet the farm on #Biden winning 15 electoral votes this fall out of NC. #TheyMustKnowSomething
Wait. Is your argument that Trump is a fascist but Biden is better because he'll just *think* about bring us more fascism and THAT'S what makes Biden better? You do realize how stupid that sounds, right?  Our country is not a democracy: It's an oligarchy with the guise of
Biden never had a chance against  😂🤣. Gonna love seeing yall cry for another 4 years.
In Biden's defense, I suggest that Trump is insulting men everywhere by claiming to be one.
See this is a true American, Biden and his campaign actually believe made in America is best. Whereas the tRUMP only gives lip service to the idea.  #VoteBlueIn2020 #DumpTrumpNow #BidenHarris
Its interesting watching Democrats who complained about Biden/Harris now defending them and voting for them and not realizing that they’re doing the exact same thing Republicans have done with Trump.   “If they win, our team wins, so I’ll overlook everything I don’t like to win.”
"...only the 2nd Black woman ever to serve in the US Senate, and the first South Asian-American woman. No Black woman has ever served as the governor of a state...no Black woman had ever been on a major party’s presidential ticket."   The power she has!
I keep tryna say that only way Trump loses is if he fumbles hard, but instead Biden's the one continually fumbling. It's gotta be game over right?
LISTEN. Biden should’ve picked Bernie as his running mate. But I see what they did. Having an African American woman on the ticket is MONUMENTAL, so I’m not taking anything from her. Trump is going to spend the next 80 days focusing on defining a woman.. &amp; what she should be.
WOW 😳!! That’s joey biden , the one that gets lost all the time and mumbling all the time!!!!
Ads here in NC by the admin take Biden’s “Not gonna be happy about raised taxes” (referring to the rich and himself, actually) and making it seem like he meant the middle and lower classes.  Still yet to see an ad about their successful COVID management though. Weird.
What jobs? We're tired of all the lies. That's why the Biden&amp; Harris ticket is the honest WINNER!
Remember all the hiring signs we saw in the past 3 years;  displayed in stores, on back of vehicles, billboards and everywhere we looked? Now think back to the 8 years of Biden and Obama.
Top story: WATCH: New Trump ad hammers Biden/Harris over Joe's endless array of racial gaffes  see more
This is exactly the tactics Putin uses and this will happen in every Republican state Trump needs. FL, TX, GA, PA, OHIO, etc..  Biden and Harris should file complaints now.
We have been hearing no defense for Biden since the reports surfaced... Unilaterally, the Democratic party has chosen to completely ignore or disavow outright the claims. I understand innocent until proven guilty, but people should at least investigate and have an inquiry.
WOW ! THAT IS DISTURBING TO SAY THE LEAST.
Hillary lost because of Michigan, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Ohio, Florida, and Wisconsin’s going for Trump. Biden will win VA. Whomever wins won’t be decided by VA voters. Volunteer with the campaign if you want to make an impact.
Voter suppression, gerrymandering, pushback against mail-in voting, the elimination of polling sites, and Russian interference—all remove any possibility of a level playing field.  We have to overcome their criminality with numbers.    #BidenHarris2020
I’m good as long as trump isn’t president. We’ve had racist presidents before and the country was ran way better than this. If Trump wins because we keep slandering Biden and Harris which will split the votes or cause us to not vote at all... ima have a mental break down 😓
“Never forget peasants black people are a monolithic culture and will always fall in line when we ask.”        —Joe Biden (probably)

I.. yall.. did trump say that kamala harris was nastier to joe biden than.. Pocahontas? Trump supporters, this yall guy? 😂😂😂😂😂
Its only going to get worse when the unemployment checks stop next year and the real depression begins. And when Biden- Harris win or when the Left to contests a Trump victory.
You better take the social out of your name if you're going to vote for Biden and Harris. They're both tough-on-crime Republicans with a D next to their name.
Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election | Fox Business: Harris is a Sanders socialist , already rejected by the voters.
Don't forget Biden also wrote the 1983 Comprehensive Forfeiture Act that allows cops to steal people's property without charging them with a crime!
I cannot believe that I’m actually seeing posts from people about them not voting in September. You really want another 4 years of Trump?! Biden/Harris is not a perfect ticket but they are a HELL of a lot better than Trump. Check yourselves, people. #BidenHarris2020
A phrase you are beginning to hear pop up in private conversations about #presidential race is: '#JoeBiden has a lead..but his support is a mile wide and an inch deep". One operative characterized Biden support in #NorthCarolina as "1/4 mile wide 1/4 inch deep" Keep that in mind
PS...  Had he picked Klobuchar I suspect that would have been the knockout punch.  She would have delivered the midwest.  Harris?  Outside of California she's not well liked and never polled more than 1%.  California already voted for Biden so it doesn't matter.
Look what I ended up in Facebook jail for. Yup posting a positive comment on an article about Biden Harris speech🤦🏽‍♀️

Are you trying to show how much harder Biden will work tan you?
With Biden &amp; Harris we should expect millions instead of thousands of illegal immigrants.
good interview with Jack Lew this morning.  If Biden wins you think he brings him back to Treasury to tackle this mess? Or consider keeping Mnuchin and allowing him to negotiate without the limitations he clearly has now.
The entire world has a "dog in this fight."  Or...have you not been paying attention?  I do tend to agree with Gundlach, however.  She was poor choice for Biden.
That’s really gracious of Carlson to campaign so hard for Biden.
It means Biden is a stooge who they put up because they see him as “electable”. Then, they slip an in unelected socialist (Heels up) to fast track the socialist agenda that Trump halted. I feel like the voters will see through this obvious trickery and do the right thing though.

Hats off to Biden for making political ads that are actually pro-biden instead of just anti-trump. I still don't like the guy, but I can at least respect that, especially since dissing Trump is so easy.
Bring up Biden and Harris records was it relates to prison and arrest and then bring up Trump and Pences.

I have family members who think our current situation (i mean all of it) is great and Biden is a far left socialist. And I’ve concluded that it stems from this attitude “I got mine and I don’t care about anyone else”. American exceptionalism is quite the drug.
Rudi’s daughter Begs to differ and is voting for Biden
Biden being a conservative, pandering, racist who will escalate military tensions—like LBJ—was my original point. I think you missed it.
LBJ was a racist who did most things out of political expediency. He's also largely responsible for the escalation in Vietnam.  Biden would be the most conservative Democrat President in 50+ years.
Come on now Matt. It's almost September. Go ahead and tweet your half-hearted last-minute gotta-get-Trump-out-of-there endorsement of Biden now and don't keep us waiting.
Biden is LBJ being sold as FDR and that should piss you off.
Biden has been in politics for half a century.
Fuck Joe Biden

I love how Carl blames Trump for 165k Covid deaths. Liberal delusion alive &amp; well. You do realize Nasty Nancy and Basement Biden screamed “overreaction” &amp; Xenophobia” at band.  Considering 2+MM U.S. deaths was projection. U should stay away from this topic thank YOUR President.
Judge on Fox called for Biden assassination. One time I know what he’s talking about.
I don’t care who Joe Biden would have picked, I’m not happy voting for JOE BIDEN. Also, I can kinda understand why people would choose not to vote but Trump has done so much damage in the past four years how could you not vote against him?
If Keisha has been the VP pick it would have been a “Biden Bottoms 2020” ticket.
That's weird because a few months ago you said you believed Biden's accuser.
Biden is quite unlikely to be winning Montana. It certainly has a penchant for electing Democratic Senators but hard to see Biden carrying it, unless he's really up 15 points nationally.

Yes when you try to compare two different things you get different numbers. It’s amazing. Now get that quote where the Biden accusers said it wasn’t sexual.
I thought Biden looks like he’s in great shape. I’d like to see Trump trying to move that hand powered car.
Biden will kick your ass, Trump!
Here comes the Republican attack against Biden/Harris. When did The Republican Party become so toxic? How can they bring our country together when all they do is spew vile propaganda at other Americans. Reprehensible. Repulsive. Dispicable.
big titty joe biden gf plz
Biden says campaign raised $26 million in one day since Harris joined the ticket
Apparently, Handsy  forgot about Obama ignoring the rise of ISIS, doing nothing about Syria, and how how Joe didn't want to take out Osama
Biden Harris 2020. The Choice is Clear.
I finally understand why experienced SA members went to such pains the last 4 years to clarify that we're not in a fascist moment yet and Trump is not actually a fascist leader: libs saying that fascism means we have to vote for Biden.
Has anyone floated this idea? Biden Wins, sworn in, resigns due to health.  Wala! The DNC is right where they always wanted to be. Don't sell them short.
This Biden and his granddaughter. You might wanna leave out family flavored metaphors with this guy.
"He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground," she said of Trump.
😂😂😂 Right?!!!  Me: Eh, he wasn’t my first pick. Tucker Carlson, trying to scare people out of voting Biden: HE’LL UNDO EVERYTHING MY IDOL DID?! Me: Thinking about a Biden Harris 2020 tattoo now, tbh.
If Biden/Harris is part of your long game you aren't making progress as anything but a neolib.
Didn't you campaign for #RobertByrd ?  #KKKBiden
Sometimes I forget that I surround myself with such progressive people that when I get around the rest of society I don’t know how to act lmfao.   Like huh??? You like Kamala and Biden???
Kamala Harris was born to highly educated middle class parents.  She was able to get scholarships to excellent universities.  She is not black.  She may be a wonderful role model, but as Joe Biden has said, “you ain’t black”.
Not even close. Listen to what these people are actively fighting for and you will understand why they are angry the Biden and Harris are the nominees. Progressives have legitimate concerns about Biden and Harris. Offer them the respect of paying attention to their needs.
Or purchase of Biden family support by the Chicoms to the tune of $1.5 billion. Bought and paid for by the CCP
Victory for Biden is not any type of victory for a progressive platform. Not now, not ever.
Funny that people think Biden/Harris will be literally any different than Trump
I think if the election were held today, Biden would win NC but not Georgia.
Man Biden picked Kamala Harris so he can persuade the blacks to vote in his favor...
Biden the Bigot...🤢🤮👎
Don’t know who Joe Biden is? His heart is pure.
And Liz and Katie were running a fundraiser at the exact time he announced Kamala... Coincidence?  You gotta give it to Joe Biden's team, they know how to use women and progressives and throw them aside.
I don’t share their political beliefs at all (I’m not ‘settling’ for Biden, he was my choice in the primary) but the Instagram account “Settle for Biden” is hilarious.
It should surprise no one that the “wing” this piece refers to is like 4 really disappointed people, one of which is a “never anyone but Bernie”, and even some of those recognize that there will be aspects of the Biden/Harris administration that will be positives ie climate.
Got this text from my mother a few minutes ago   “I am signing up to make calls for Biden/KamalaHarris Here’s the link if you want to do some yourselves.” 💪 #Kamala #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
The Biden media machine is more excited than those of us who actually vote
Good point, but:  Worst case scenario w/ Biden is returning to pre-Trump status quo. Which is bad, I know. That is WORST case.  4 more yrs w/ GOP will give us a full dictatorship, supported by a federal secret police, the DOJ, and the Supreme Court.   No contest. None. IMHO.
Good thing Biden isn’t exactly running against a Mensa Candidate.
I'm just one person planning to shrugvote Biden/Harris but I absolutely think your vote is your own, nobody is entitled to it. Vote your conscience.
Someone at Fox News who is not a Biden fan—maybe it was Tammy Bruce—said recently that one advantage Biden has over other political liars is that his lies are entertaining. His made-up-stories are at least interesting to listen to. Maybe he should’ve been a fiction author.
DNC: “Biden’s platform is the furthest left the party’s had in decades.”  The Left: We know. That’s the problem.
All of the “I’d vote for Biden but could never vote for an extreme candidate” all of a sudden finding a whole bunch of reasons to not for Biden. It’s almost like we shouldn’t let Republicans control who Democrats nominate.
what if at the first debate biden just walked out and smashed an orange with his fist before saying a single word, i feel like that’d really set the tone
I think that’s a cop out you know deep in your heart why ..nobody wants to talk to Biden or Obama either they are just blowing smoke up our ass if your not going to talk to everyone involved your wasting time

No, I support Biden. I disagree with Sara but she's still a friend.
Look what happen to me on  for saying something positive about Biden and Harris... wonder whose side Facebook is on... #VoteBidenHarris2020 #momala #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
Radical or moderate? Trump paints Joe Biden-Kamala Harris ticket as both
Lyin’ hidin’ Biden.
Like Trump was? Funny you're questioning Biden &amp; Harris's credentials.
I’m not thrilled about a Biden-Harris  presidency, but at least I actually trust Biden to appoint cabinet members who are highly educated in their fields and know wtf they’re talking about. It’s like would you rather be shot in the foot or the head? I’m going foot. You should too
I think Biden would be asking Who is Hunter?
Kamala tryna pull off a Insurgency on Biden. Infiltration step complete
Where is Hunter ? Did Biden forget about his other son
Biden Harris 2020. The Choice is Clear.
Joe Biden should do a press conference.
Seeing videos of Harris and Biden together doesn't even feel real
Hey Margaret Biden mispronounced kamala's name too. Was he disrespectful or only Tucker?
I don't know why I cried through almost all of this speech, but I did. LFG, you guys.
Historic! Joe Biden Picks ‘Fearless’ Kamala Harris as His VP Running Mate
Is she calling for someone to assasinates Biden? Where is secret service, FFS!!
Yes vote for trump... after Biden after 50 years in Congress has 0, nothing, nada, zilch to show for helping African Americans ... WHILE Trump has done prison reform, opportunity zones ( do you even understand what they are and how the benefit the black community?), etc.
Joe Biden's VP choice of Kamala Harris signals return to American values and competence
Joe Biden is a compassionate human being.   Donald Trump is a sociopath.  Professed Christians should vote for Biden for this fact alone.  #BidenHarris2020
This person was presumably born the last time Joseph Biden was on a presidential ticket???
Why would you even post this with out including Biden's January Op-ed where he laid out exactly what  POTUS should have done?
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make first joint appearance as running mates
has taken North Carolina out of Biden's column and given it to Trump, so YOU SEE??? we must really  get serious in order to ensure a victory for America
I’ve been saying all along  no big names will be arrested they will say some low level person acting on his own  hell Biden  and Obama where off limits I will be surprised if any thing else happens hell look at the  case deep state all around
Amazing what our Crooked Fake Racist President  came up with after hearing about Kamala Harris:  “Take my word for it, if Biden-Harris gets elected, more blacks will move to the suburbs.”
I think she'll stay in the Senate.  A cabinet pick would pigeonhole her which is why she wanted President.  I'm happy for her to stay and fuck around with Biden/Harris as they've got little to no power.
Yes it is the two white women's fault because Biden scheduled their fundraiser from 4 to 6, and then announced his VP pick around that time (receipt attached 😉).
Same here. As the next President of the US, Joe Biden, and his badass VP, Kamala Harris, said today, Possibilities. Say it again, possibilities. A good day, for sure.
Joe Biden is just a vessel.
Biden buried him like a hungry top in the spring harvest.
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event
KOngratulations to Kamala Harris in her historic selection as the Vice President Running Mate for Presumptive Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden! She is the FIRST Black woman on a major US ticket; it is officially a serious matter! 💖💚 #aka1908 #kamalaharris
A public option will be way more difficult to pass and implement assuming Biden and Pelosi would even try. See you in 2024!
Yes famous authoritarians joe biden and kamala Harris!
how in the FUCK can y’all sit here and say “free black men and women locked up on marijuana related crimes” then THEN TURN AROUND AND FUCKING VOTE FOR BIDEN AND HARRIS?????
Kamala &amp; Biden won't cut it 🤷🏻‍♀️  Both are bitter, negative, ugly personality.
Funny, so the law and order guy is the guy in office when crime and murders surge? Get Biden in there to make America's streets safe again.
I don’t think I’m going to be able to get excited about a Biden/Harris candidacy. However, I am very much looking forward to Harris saying more stuff like “just like everythingp else he’s inherited, he ran it into the ground”.
Hey Twitter boy. Nothing inappropriate to say about the Biden-Harris press conference? Matter of time I’m sure. You are incapable of behaving like a leader.
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make first joint appearance as running mates
Can’t wait for my ballot to start the journey afresh with BIDEN/HARRIS ticket!
But if something does happen to Biden, we know who to investigate. Question 1: How did you know something was going to happen to him?
3. Jeff Grundlach is an Economist, Global Macro Strategist, and Bond Manager. Without additional context, I don't see a problem with him saying a VP pick would be too dominant next to Biden. People said the same thing about LBJ next to Kennedy.
And winning is what Biden does best. #BidenHarris2020
OMG - The GOP compared to Biden - Harris looks like corrupt old white men from the Deep South, grasping at power that they know is slipping from their hands.  Goodbye and good riddance. Goodbye to the  hatered / bigotory/ and vial maliciousness of the Trump GOP.
Biden literally was friends with a KKK member and went to his funeral
Don't bother.  We knew she was first pick.  So, let's make her proud and get these progressives elected.  She will drag Biden and Harris in the Senate - the more of her we have, the more we can drag their asses.
Hoping there will be a spot in the Biden administration for you!
OMG - The GOP compared to Biden - Harris looks like corrupt old white men from the Deep South, grasping at power that they know is slipping from their hands.  Goodbye and good riddance. Goodbye to the  hatered / bigotory/ and vial maliciousness of the Trump GOP.
It's not about Trump or Biden. It's about becoming a dictatorship or keeping a democracy where we live to fight another day. The GOP will turn us into an autocracy if they get another term. They might have already, if they succeed in stealing this election.

. And this statement of mine remained true as well. It was Clyburn’s endorsement that cinched it for Biden. Obama didn’t endorse until it was “safe” for him to do so—after it was a foregone conclusion so Obama coudn’t be appear to be wrong.
What would the percentages for Biden look like in this situation. 80% of the vote in CA?
Biden and Kamala knocked it out of the park!!!
“And like everything else he’s inherited, he’s run ot in the ground.” (the economy from Obama/Biden) the NEXT VP of the United States,
“ inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden and then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground.” —  #BidenHarris2020
me and  are literally the BLUEPRINT for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris....truly the NC State SBP and SBVP ticket that y’all never knew you wanted
Beau Biden died at age 46 from glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer.  For over a decade I have been fighting for Burn Pit legislation to help veterans like myself and Beau.  I'm proud to stand with  as he fights for us.
I love your perfect purity.  Sorry for using shorthand (on twitter) to describe the overwhelming electoral turnout and validation among MANY, but not ALL, black voters that we all watched push Biden to the front.
God bless Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and god bless America. We at last have hope again💫 #JoeBidenForPresident2020 #JoeBidenKamalaHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020
While I don’t believe there will be any debates in which Biden is on a stage alone with Trump with no teleprompter to read or handlers to whisper in his ear—if there are, will the liberal MSM carry it on a delay so Biden’s losses of thought can be hidden from the viewers?
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make first joint appearance as running mates: WATCH LIVE
Amazing how black voters LOVE Joe Biden...I am going to trust them on this one.
I am surprised the liberal networks are running the Biden/Harris annoucement live. If Biden forgets his place, everyone will see it.
Funny how #Kamala forgot Biden is a #racist who bussed her. 🤣😂 So freaking #fake  Oh kamala not even California love you. 😂🤣😁 Did you realize #DementiaJoe didn't express any optimistic plan? Nope just bashing POTUS. #SystemicRacism my butt
If you don’t vote for Biden I will make you eat my hot dogs ... that’s where this all ends.
Looks like Biden had a nice shot of #adrenochome  for this speach
Biden looks like he is being born again

Biden sucking her finger at some point?

Win one for the entire 🌏 everyone.   All people who are or want to be free need you to vote for President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.  And bring some friends. Get them registered.  💪👊🏾
She is not my choice for President or Vice President, just my own opinion, so sadly she can become President if Biden can longer perform his Presidential duties, although I dont feel he will get elected anyway.  So im not too worried about it.
Why when you type  in your browser does the Joe Biden website come up????? WTF?
The weather evidently has thrown the Biden schedule off per
Is what you are doing to Biden and Obama daily.
Biden on women, 2020: Sniff as many as you can 🤮  Kamala on politics for decades: who ya gotta sleep with to get anywhere’s here...
Unfortunately it’s a lesser of two evils. Not voting  all just gives it to him, and I don’t think Joe Biden could possibly do much more worse
I need Biden and Harris to hurry up though. They’ve been “speaking at any moment” for an hour and a half now
Liberals and Socialist love ❤️ fining People that vote for them , like guy’s that own the fitness center in NEW YORK! Well they have already said they will definitely vote for PRESIDENT TRUMP!! And you’re not black unless you vote for master biden!! He will take the chains off 🧐
Rob, don’t get suckered in by this far-right conspiracy drivel, the domain owner likely transferred traffic toward the Biden website, which to me is actually clever if a bit sneaky.  My guess is this link will be down before the end of the day....
The next 100 days will be way more bearable if everyone admits that we all know exactly what will happen: liberals will check out the second trump is gone and Biden will sit in the chair and do nothing like they want.
Stick with the “he’s better than trump” argument, stop insulting our intelligence re: the “most progressive platform ever” full of things Biden didn’t support until this year and in most cases actively opposed for decades.
Despite Kamala Harris’s history, she probably looks better to the electoral college unfortunately.we all want Trump out so suck it up and vote Biden for 2020
In Joe Biden's case he said if a woman says she was sexually assaulted you believe her except of course for the woman accusing him of sexual assault.  You just ignore her.  Believe all women unless they accuse a democrat is usually how it goes.
“But not Joe Biden, he’s not that smart”🤣
no you mean the super delegates decided biden.  don't worry i'm sure that trump won't bring up kamala's attacks on biden at all during the next three months.
This is what boils my piss, people saying "but Biden is x, Kamala is y, and I voted for z"  Don't care.  There's an actual monster in charge now and do you really want an 4 more years of absolute misery??? Is the moral high ground worth all the COVID dead and kids in cages???
you understand that she said she believed what they said right?  you realize that what they said is accusing joe biden of inappropriate touching right?
No i've never had the position of believe all women.  that's a dumb position to take because then you end up in situations like harris and biden are in now.  You should investigate but to say believe all of anyone off the jump is just stupid.
Joe Biden: You ain’t black!🤬  Kamala Harris: I know.😪
This is the Biden War Room's best one yet.  👍
Good deal- there’s one educated voter that won’t be voting Biden 🤣
Yes biden=FAILURES and AMERICA going to HELL !! SAD 😢!! REAL AMERICANS can’t let this HAPPEN!!
Four more years of Trump will definitely get those libs on our side.  They just wanna go back sleep under Biden
If you're looking to justify voting for Trump, look elsewhere. You know good and well Biden is the only viable alternative.
Seems odd that you dont want Joe Biden to do this.
Yeaaaaaaaaah if biden and kamala get elected I’m snitching
How y’all feel about Biden picking Harris?
This is too accurate. My view is at least Biden is less likely to be a national embarrassment.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
So what? Both Trump and Biden are creeps I thought this was already established
That’s a pretty gross way to describe a supporter. Are you in the Colon of Biden or any of the other corrupt scum you support?
Absolutely! Between Biden and Kamala! What is the Number of Black Lives Destroyed, Jailed or Inprisoned! If you have a Number! Let's Roll!
Followed and retweeted! 🌊💃🏻 blue wave coming through!
All you ppl complaining about biden/harris. Do you realize what the other option is, i mean come on, I cant take 4 more years of that cheeto puff bitch. #BidenHarris2020
There is no one solution my guy, you do what you can step by step to make progress and Biden is a step away from Trump, it might not be an end all solution, but it’s a step in the right direction to have our voices heard. I wanted Bernie, but you gotta do what you gotta do
I'm sure you were trying to look like Biden...right?
omg thought it was Biden lol
I'm not giving to the Lincoln project, but literally, it isn't Trump or Biden on ballot, but our Constitutional Republic. Will we keep moving towards a more perfect union based on the values we have espoused or slide into the abyss of a white nationalist totalitarian oligarchy.
Just ordered 2 Biden/Harris yard signs. One for the front and one for the back since our yard is up against the greenway.
They will spend the next 5 mo trashing everything they can just to make it that much harder for Biden to make actual progress.
Followed! Thank you! 🌊💃🏻
Wouldn't want people to see that Biden and Trump agree on everything.
again semantics aren't helping you here.  four women plus tara reade have accused biden of sexual assault.  unwanted touching is sexual assault.  the voters may not care at all but still doesn't change harris statement's
Biden has been criticized for telling a black jounalist that “you’re not black” or “you’re not black enough”.  If Joe applied those accusations to Kamala Harris, he would be right.
#GOP Trying to find bad things to say about Biden and a Harris is hilarious!  Your DEFENDING TRUMP!  PRES CLUELESS! We Win!   165000 DEAD!  Solution ‘IT WILL MAGICALLY GO AWAY’
Meanwhile, radical liberals are crying like babies and saying they won’t vote for Biden/Harris.
I’m white and live in the suburbs.  I didn’t misinterpret anything from this statement.  Nor did I get hysterical. Nor did I think that his statement showed any intelligence.  Just more of the divisive rhetoric that defines this man.  I’ll be voting Biden/Harris 2020.
One thing that is already odd (as if 2020 is not already "odd" enough) is that most presidential tickets tack to the center after primaries are over. #Biden keeps lurching farther and farther left with every decision including #Veep choice. Will center unaffiliated voters follow?
Meet President Biden
it's not a lie if it's true.  she did say she believed biden's accusers.  you just loop that over and over and there is nothing she can do especially after her grandstanding during the kavanaugh hearings.  again it will be glorious.
for biden/kamala who are both extremely pro policing pro cop and pro jail
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “National Women for Biden Bimonthly Training” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
It is the political equivalent of #FourCorners before shot clock. The only problem is #JoeBiden is no #PhilFord...in order to win, you have to at least make your free throws when fouled and Biden keeps clanking even the easy softball interviews he has online
I heard her Family owned a lot of slaves, is that is the quality Joe Biden found most appealing in her. 😳not to  mention she’s black in color as well.
I assume anybody that really wants Biden to win will do whatever is necessary to vote for Biden. If you want Trump to win you will vote for Trump.  I don’t think Trump will want people who want Trump to win to vote for Kanye. I don’t see how this can help trump
Every time I here little girls I think of Joe Biden, hopefully those aren’t the same little girls he molested right in front of their parents. WTF😳
It's not excitement - it's the rage aimed at all those who were willing to risk our democracy by voting for a two-bit traitor reality TV personality. Vote for Biden, but the 2016 misogyny will not be forgotten.
Absolutely! The Perfect! Candidate for Biden! Maybe he can keep track of Kamala by her SMELL!
He is trying to replicate early days of  Republic where guys like Washington and Jefferson didn"t campaign for office...crass politicking was below them. They 'stood' for election and stayed home at Mount Vernon or Monticello. #Biden is trying new spin: Hiding Out with Biden
Biden knows what he’s doing  #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris #Election2020
Might be the first, and only time, you will see anyone in the public polling arena brag about how wrong they were in 2016 and also brag about how their model gives #Trump "MUCH higher" chance than other polls do...although still saying he will probably lose to a weak #Biden
In a Biden/Harris World! #Trump2020
Biden could’ve picked a Kit Kat to be his VP and I would still vote for him foh
So she's going to do all the work and Biden gets to lead and get credit?  No thanks.   stay in the Senate and give them hell.
Good for Democrats maybe, but bad 4 the people of North Carolina.  Joe Biden threw progressives to the curb with his pick, while shamelessly using African-American voters to advance neoliberalism.  Harris inspires nobody but party elites seeking power for their donors.  #ncpol
Moments After Biden Announced Harris, Trump Absolutely Flattened Her
Trump leads Biden by only 2 points in NC-11?
Number 35.
Congratulations to Senator Kamala Harris on being selected as the Vice Presidential running mate with VP Joe Biden. A Voteless People Is A Hopeless People.
And still Biden is 10 points ahead. AMAZING
Prob a long-shot for a D pick-up (former Meadow's seat), but redrawing of it will shorten the odds. That Trump is treading water vs. Biden is a good sign for the D. He prob lags behind Biden due to name recognition not preference. The R will likely make blunders, too.
Why isn't Biden (Or, really, his campaign folks) Segmenting emails?
Which will only happen with a D administration?  Work to get them elected and to move Congress to the left.  Biden/Harris will back it if the Congress passes it.
He actually admitted to most of the stuff you called obscure. You just pick and choose when to politicize your religion. Today you care about whatever is anti Biden.
No way Biden should debate Trump. Every word out of Trump's mouth is a lie.
Despite what happened to Ms. Clinton, I think the odds are in Biden-Harris’ favor.
What did I miss? #LincolnVoter  Lindsey Graham praises Joe Biden and calls Donald Trump a 'race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot' in new ad
We are ready to go to work to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  This is a winning ticket.  And we are ready to #FlipTheSenate      Goodbye Thom, Susan, and of course, #MoscowMitch
if y’all keep gatekeeping biden by expecting everybody to kiss the ground he walks on and not have any critique ur gonna lose the progressive votes which u desperately need!😸
all my feed is rn is “StOp CoMpLaiNiNg AbOuT bIdEn/KaMaLa” like damn i thought we all believed in freedom of speech/having an opinion on issues, do y’all want my vote or not
Biden’s leadership has already been compromised.  This wasn’t his choice, nor was it his second choice.
I keep seeing people talk about how shitty the Kamala pick is for Biden but I have to ask, would any of Biden's VP picks NOT been shitty?
Biden seizes on Trump's attack on Social Security and Medicare, while team Trump panics
Biden must be pulling horribly behind Trump which is why The left is on this full court press about voter fraud all of the sudden.
If most people had suspected Biden was going to pick Harris for weeks, why is it taking the Rs so much time to come up with a strategy to attack her? Ahhhh, that’s right, we stole  , their best marketing team. 😂
“Good job siphoning those votes away from Biden!” - Jared
You keep acting like Tara Reade is the only woman to accuse Joe Biden of inappropriate behavior.  I just gave you a link with four other women.  That is why she said accusers.  Not accuser.
What happened to WSJ who uncovered Watergate? Exposed TRUTHFUL news? You r a mouthpiece for radical left. Expose that Biden can't string a sentence or remember where he is; that the flip-flop radical woman he's chosen for VP will be Pres within a year.
Biden's climate plan "drew from policies that Harris herself has pushed, specifically including accountability for fossil fuel companies in Department of Justice investigations."   via
MR. PRESIDENT, please don't talk or worry yourself about Biden's pick for VP, WE. Already know she can get CALIFORNIA , Dem. Already had that state anyways, THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING .JUST BE THE BETTER PERSON AND KEEP DOING YOUR JOB, THE REST WILL FOLLOW 💪
Dear Biden campaign - I would like to see individual debates between Kamala Harris and Bill Barr, Mike Pence, The Impeached One, Ben Shapiro, and the owner of Hobby Lobby. Thank for considering this request.
Anyone know if Biden gonna choose 8 treasury secretaries, make them battle it out for months, knowing the whole time he will cave to peer pressure, bullying and threats?  Or does he only do that with women?
Already tired of reading “well Biden/Harris wasn’t my IDEAL choice BUT”   Just vote in November plz
I got opinions too but bitch I’m voting for Biden. Get that gahdamn Cheeto outta there!
Agreed.  She just needs to stay in the Senate so she can hold Biden Harris accountable.  The Dems don't need her apparently, they've got their ticket let them live with the consequences.
Yep.  I called it five weeks ago.  Biden is a coward who caves to peer pressure.  Should be a fun four years of *checks notes* zero things changing.
Either way I'm voting for Biden. I just want trump out of there.
love that people are celebrating a cop being biden's VP pic, very cool
And I’m not voting for no joe biden foh
Keen observers point out unusual elements of Biden’s Instagram post with Harris — Puppet Joe Biden
I feel like there needs to be more room to be critical of the Biden/Kamala ticekt and also excited about the potential of having a black woman VP. Ostracizing anybody who feels differently than you about the Kamala pick is just generally unhelpful.
That makes sense, but the counterpoint is that on the few occasions Biden says something it seems like he fucks up and has to do damage control pretty regularly!
If Biden really wanted to win in November he would have gone with Elizabeth Warren as his VP - but he coddled up to the mob and went Kamala to check off the box - he must be scared Trump was making big inroads with black voters (which he is! #blexit)
Facts. Trump was accused of using Kanye to steal Black votes from Biden in an interview. Stay woke y’all. Don’t be fooled.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
Yes he is. Whatever we are talking about here in terms of the VPs influence electorally is on the extreme margins. It’s Biden v Trump is the bottom line
Here's more proof.  This lady seems to think it was something:   She literally said she believed all of biden's accusers.  So are all of them liars or just admit she's power hungry who will do anything.  She's a hypocrite.
I just wish Biden didn't look so fragile and senile sometimes.
You should build one in Joe Biden‘s basement. He won’t know the difference and for the next four years he’ll think he’s president after he loses
So by NOT voting for Biden, means you approve of Trump?  Ok, well that sums up all I need to know.  It's either one or the other there is no middle ground on this one.
I'd like Biden to debate BUT think he should add a condition. Don't debate unless Trump releases his tax returns and medical records.
There is no lack of quality candidates for AG for Biden to pick from - include Preet Bharara on that list too.
With Harris you're either talking about things that aren't controversial to most people (she's a cop who now believes in police reform?) or you go down the Biden-esque rabbit hole. "Well, her dad was this guy who said this thing, and her family did this, and and and."
The Harris outrage machine is so similar to the Biden outrage machine it's unreal. Both are weak b/c neither has anything to go off of. With the other VP choices, there was an easily packaged and digestible scandal (Warren, Bass, and Rice especially).
The country is calling for police and justice reform. The VP pick for Joe Biden is the complete opposite.
Great she also said she believed all of Biden's accusers.  You know more than one.  Here let me help you.
Lolol, someone doesn't want Biden speaking off script
Biden took 0.5 hits. Harris delivered the .5.
I 100% understand that if Biden flops, "leftists didn't support him hard enough" will be the excuse.  The damage is going to be equally insurmountable if we have Trump II in 2-4 years.
The VP pick is an example of how Joe Biden has been so quiet during the current campaign. My newest  is on why this is good and should continue:
It is! It can also be ominous that again - hard not to think of 2016, ever!!! - we're doing a ticket where we have some reason to believe that we've talked ourselves into it and maybe voters don't actually like them that much.  The odds are heavily in Biden's favor, granted.
As an independent I try to get diff. viewpoints. And usually I found u credible. But your article on Harris is nonsensical. No matter who Biden picked R’s would label her radical..Trump had no qualifications to be Pres. &amp; has proven to be a lying incompetent buffoon
All the folks highlighting GOP talking points about Kamala and then saying, "but I'm still going to begrudgingly vote for Biden" or "I'm just going to vote 3rd party" can enjoy smugly sniffing their own farts when Trump wins due to a divided Dem party.
So. Many. Emails. From. The. Biden. Campaign.
I mean check out the opening paragraph from today's Washington Post story...
I can’t support anyone’s decision not to vote for Joe Biden right now is not the time for some nihilistic purity test
Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris as his running mate, was celebrated by many Democrats. Here's what President Donald Trump had to say about it,
#Magic8BallTweet   All you guys can say is either Biden is forgetful or Harris is liberal. How about articulating a meaningful argument of why trump should remain president versus a change?  I know it's not a winning argument, but try.
While some of y'all are bashing Biden and/or Harris, I just have one question:  What outcome are you trying to bring about? Like, what goal is putting the Dem ticket on blast going to achieve for you?  Because the effect it WILL have is to persuade some people not to vote at all.
We will take things not said by NPR in 2011 when Obama/Biden dropped the payroll tax.
Joe Biden can’t get through a sentence but go ahead and vote for him
Corrupt corporate warmongers like Clinton, Obama &amp; Biden are not lesser evil They’re better at institutional evil like the Crime Bill &amp; permanent war
Good for Biden see what happens
LOL she's a self-declared "Top Cop" of California. How will THAT play out? She also said she believed Joe's accuser! OK so the Top Cop believes Biden is guilty of sexual harassment!! but now you pander to the left, hilarious
This is the weakest field of 3rd party candidates in many  cycles. They really hurt Clinton in those key states in 16. Trump will not be as fortunate this go-around.
NYTimes White House "journalist" spews spin and opinions for Biden/Dems and against Trump/Republicans.  In next breath whines she is NOT biased and is straight news person.  Can not figure out why nobody believes her...
NYTimes hack "reporter" admitting she is a stenographer for the Biden campaign!
You did not sound honored when you were with Biden at the debates. You will be soundly defeated.
Like watching forecasters trying to plug in -50000% GDP and 2000% unemployment and voila Biden wins 538-0.  Nothing matters.  Whatever, I'll take their money and it will require less working capital to do so.
This is a pretty accurate description. But that's why she was picked. She's a response to Trump's argument that with Biden in office every city will be Chicago or Portland. She's also got the identity politics bona fides and, unlike a Stacey Abrams etc, is a leader not a victim.
can’t wait to vote Biden/Harris to own the libs
You should say that you do remember, and will still work for Biden/Harris. Otherwise you're just as bad as any Trump supporter who denies any bad shit he did and shouts TRUMO 2020!  Or do you already have your blue MAGA hat?
A vote for a radically pro abortion ticket is not worth teaching the Republicans a lesson. I vote out of principle, not pragmatism. Just as I think Trump is horrible for the country and unfit, so do I maintain that bc of the abortion issue primarily Biden/Harris is also unfit.
Vote for the most pro-abortion ticket in history? No thanks. I won't sell out my principles and values just because I can't stand Trump. And I'm so tired of this faulty logic. Staying home is as much a vote for Biden as it is Trump. I still care about my local elections also.
Obama said Biden really nailed the pick
No candidate, especially in this 2 party system should be able to move an inch w/out critique. My biggest fear is the history of Biden &amp; Harris will show up in the presidency. I can support and vote their ticket while also side eyeing their political resumes.
Kinda the same way the republicans feel for Biden when he debates Trump.
Biden’s campaign is a pro run machine that has ignored every cable pundit and twitter know it all and steamrolled. Harris should come in, follow the blocking the campaign sets out and prep her ass off for oct 7. Bring energy and gut Pence in the debate. That’s it.
So Nate  releases his election prediction confirming Biden's advantage in both the popular vote and electoral map.  The reaction? The prediction market moves the other way. Huh.
If CNN can read Biden's mind, why didn't they tell us all this before the pick was made?
yeah.. I mean trump's policies haven't been bad. just hard to vote for someone with lack of character. But no way am I voting for Biden/Harris.. I guess I will be writing in or Kanye. haha.
I was thinking the same: Biden has a trusted, dedicated staff. No leaking implies they are a team working toward the same goal. A novel concept after 3.5 years of chaos.
Just vote for Biden and shut up. LITERALLY anyone is better than trump
She's definitely blowing some energy into the Biden campaign
BIDEN IS A STRATEGIST BIDEN HAS A PLAN #BidenHarris2020 TRUMP IS A CRIMINAL TRUMPS ONLY PLAN IS AVOIDING PRISON.
I'm not RTing this to make people think you shouldn't vote for Biden/Harris and that you should vote for Trump/Pence. But its good to know what the people you are voting for did so youre not surprised if/when they do that shit again.

Ok for anyone judging Kamala Harris and saying she isn’t qualified or they don’t trust her... May I please remind you that MIKE PENCE is our current VP. If you don’t cast your vote for Biden/Harris, you are casting one for Dipshit/Dipshit
Biden went from everyone’s 6th choice to the consensus nominee in 48hrs, and Harris went from primary candidate who couldn’t crack 2% in polls to the presumptive heir apparent in 6mo.  Harris was also the only dem primary candidate with net unfavorable.  You people are weird.
Wait, Joe Biden Picked That Kamala Harris?
“Trump is also much better at negotiating than Biden.”
Soooooooooooo they admit Biden is just a placeholder and Kamala is the real candidate. This is all sorts of wrong.
No it ain’t.  1.) Y’all not black so y’all don’t have anything to say about a black card. 2.) Her record is trash but look who she’s up against. Pence believes in shocking gay people until they turn straight. Biden could run with Jeffrey Dahmer and he still getting all the votes
They really aren’t they? I mean Biden could have chosen Adam Smith as his running mate
This is the last thing law enforcement in the US needs!  Vote for our safety in November!  The Biden administration would be a disaster in many ways!
"During her presidential run, Harris also frequently advocated for the federal government to take legal action against fossil fuel companies for their legacy of climate pollution."
Trump claims he got prison reform done, yet he kept private prisons open after Obama/Biden signed order to close them.... You want prison reform but you want to build more prisons.
John Kasich says 'conscience' compelled him to speak at DNC, GOP is 'my vehicle but never my master'  #FoxNews   This fake  joke of a man is a Trump hater , Trump destroyed Kasich and made Kasich look like a fool.
Damn... He just had to say 1 Name😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 He needed a script?? Come on this is Bazaro World.... This guy pose to be riding around looking for a retirement home with his kids😂😂😂😂
Interviews with people briefed on the VP selection effort described a process that was extensive and laborious, with no certainty of outcome, even though Biden eventually landed on the former primary rival many had predicted from the start.

B/S/H With his VP pick of Kamala Harris Tweet, Joe Biden has simultaneously performed his first, last &amp; only Presidential duty. (Assuming he manages his own Twitter account.) [sigh] never mind.
It’s funny that Harris and Biden reconciling to team up for the good of America is like outside the realm of the trump campaigns understanding
If Biden gets elected and does well enough to get elected for a 2nd term, he’ll be 86 by the time he leaves office
Oh don't mind me, I'm just making a list of people to drag to hell and back come November 4th when our current incumbent monster in chief gets another 4 years to destroy this country further because people seem to think Biden/Harris would somehow be worse...

Joe Biden chose PHONY KAMALA HARRIS AS VP  via
I am a Joe Biden supporter and I want to see Trump out of the White House but I wonder if having Kamala Harris on the ticket is a liability. Regardless I shall cast a vote for him anyway.
Can we please get more progressive victories like this over the next 4 years, it'll make the Biden/Harris situation more palatable
I will crawl over broken glass to vote 🗳 for Biden/ Harris in November.
Biden could’ve chosen peppa pig and guess what? I’m still voting. Get 45 out of there, period.
Good point also we should consider the fact that pelosi is in play here. Biden gets declared unfit Kamala cannot become president and bam Nancy got her dream that she has been warning us about.
Trump: Some men insulted that Biden vowed to name female vice president
It’s incredibly ignorant to consider not voting because of Biden’s pick.
Harris endorsed Biden after Super Tuesday
Last night I went to bed with a glimmer of political hope and healing. As a professional woman who has been caIled “hard” instead of having business ethics, and “difficult” instead of having an opinion, I am so thrilled with Kamala Harris as Biden’s VP pick! #teamBidenharris2020
Biden must win
Fucking Kamala Harris and Joe Biden on a ticket Introducing: Slightly more Blue than you, TrumpPence Edition
Kamala Harris met the most important qualification for Biden’s running mate
Nice try Donnie but Biden never took out a full page ad in the NY Times calling for the execution on 5 innocent black teenage boys.  Trump's COVID response has resulted in the death of 50,000+ black Americans. More dead bkacks than the Jim Crow era.  #RESIGN while you can.
Biden Has More Than enough ammunition to fire back at Trumps track record...
No,  Biden brought history where it should’ve been. He gave Kamala Harris a chance. But it was her struggle to ignore social bias, she battled American oppression. From the time she went to school to be AG of Ca., she chose what’s her right to become, Vice President of America
I believe they’re just talking about the DNC’s anticipation that Biden will only serve 1 term. That makes his VP choice the nominee in 2024
It would help if progressives actually voted. If they did, we would have seen a Bernie ticket. But hey, progs can rant on all they like about Biden/Harris but without getting out there and voting - their voice is going to be a whisper.
John Legend and Cher applaud Joe Biden's vice president pick -  …
I wasn’t competing with  could? My prediction was different—it was about the composition of the Democrat ticket. And I got it exactly right, at a time when most people thought Biden and Harris would never be on the ticket together after their debate exchange.
It’s incredibly frustrating to watch well meaning folks on Twitter, including many of which who will tell you they’re voting a Biden/Harris ticket in November, do the opposition research for Republicans. The people you’re being retweeted by are Ben Shapiro.
I think Biden's medicare as a public option will also eventually lead to medicare for all..people will eventually realize medicare is better and cheaper and switch to it..or private insurance companies will have to keep up with government negotiated prices..keep up the pressure..
I see Green2020. Who do you think is more Environment Friendly, Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris?
But yeah ugh this election. Still voting for Biden + Kamala but not happy about it
Yeah, she was definitely a choice and I can’t say she wasn’t an obvious choice. But her record with policing and her role in SESTA/FOSTA prevents me from feeling good about her. But I also don’t like Biden and would I have really felt good about any pick? Honestly, prob not
At the end of the day, if she wanted the job, I want her to have it. And hopefully it will be helpful for whatever she strives for in the future. Hopefully Biden is still around to advocate for whatever that may be...
Your thoughts are always appreciated. I think she’ll bring energy. My brothers were thrilled, 1 is in Utah, the other NM. We have very different politics. I think Biden trusts her judgment, &amp; since we have no idea what’s up w/him, she may have a large behind the scenes role?
What’s the bet Biden mistakes a different black woman for Kamala
I’d love debate w/ Dems right now...but anyone ignoring &amp; defending Joe Biden’s mental deterioration is dangerous in my book. Politics aside, the fact no one on the left (inner circle or voters) seems to even care that something is severely wrong is scary as hell for our country.
Thanks, I was feeling let down by Biden. If this is true I’m ecstatic! Dems want to raise the taxes of the RICH, not middle class and poor.

Vote for Biden. Look at it as (at least) a step forward and not more steps backward. Think: humanity over politics.
President Bush needs to endorse Joe Biden.  #HumanityOverPolitics
Did we forget that Biden wrote the 1994 Crime Bill that led to the MASS incarceration of black people and he DEFENDED this bill last in 2016 saying it "restored american cities"
Did we forget thar Biden has been coined a long time supporter of law enforcement, who advocated for increased police funding for "reform" in response to the Ferguson protests?
Did we all forget? Did we forget that there were tanks in Ferguson, MO while Biden was VP? Did we forget that rubber bullets were being shot at protestors while Biden was VP? Did we forget that the department of justice ruled Michael Brown not a victim, while Biden was VP?
Ima vote for Biden
Their idea of “leadership” is a socialist dictator style leadership. Biden said “It’s not about your rights.” That pretty much sums up the Democrat Party.
“Sacrificing humanity and morality to get a conservative judge is not moral,” she says. ‘Gerrymandering a district so you get a conservative elected is not moral.’  ‘I was really beaten up,’ adds Lemel. ‘Because I didn’t want to wear red and cheer for an idiot.’”  #ncpol #Biden

I think Romney would be well suited to be Secretary of State in a Biden administration.
Oh, Biden is still embarrassing. Absolutely. But on a much more amateur level than Trump.
I think even a lot of the GOP legislators silently would prefer him to 4 more years of Trump. Biden is someone they can work with, and knows everybody has to walk away from the table with something they need for their constituents.
Won’t be long before all the woke ppl will be reposting anti Biden/Kamala propaganda from fake Russian social media accounts.  will be a former Grand Wizard of the KKK and  will be Uncle Toms granddaughter by November just like they did to
HRC is dreaming.  If she gets a cabinet position under Biden, look for another “Vince Foster move”.   The battle between HRC &amp; KH while Biden is President would be epic. The kibitzing between Bill Clinton &amp; Obama will also be epic.

Every single Joe Biden commercial on my fucking TV is about the pandemic. These Democrat governors are 100% sandbagging opening and making it seem worse than it is. This is their platform.
Why is Biden on there!?!?
My thoughts exactly!
Get over it and vote for Biden!
Nothing you or Biden have proposed would improve the situation. Trump has advocated reopening the schools and the economy precisely to help those who are out of work and allow kids to get an education. Lockdown and wear masks until we have a vaccine is not a strategy.
She's staying in the Senate and watching you Biden and Harris 🧐.
Pretty sure NBA folks in the bubble had done much worse in regards to Trump
Same here, even if I have to camp out.  I’m going to witness my vote for Joe Biden enter that machine!
It drives him nuts that nothing sticks against Biden. Joe Biden has been in public life for an eternity. People just don't buy the attacks on him. People don't associate those things with Biden.
This is a pretty revealing tweet. He just can't accept that Biden can't be pinned down so easily like Clinton.
I'm planning to vote for Biden but I don't think the last 20 years would have been much different if Gore had won. Doubt this argument will convince anyone who actually thinks Biden and Trump are equivalent.

Masks narrative is about 1 thing - protecting #Biden from campaigning. If they work we should be able to go to sporting events, keep prisoners behind bars, send all kids to school. But he needs to hide in his #basement &amp; let his handlers tweet for him because we know he can’t
Biden campaign had better be working a strategy as well!
The top two candidates in the primary elections should be on the Presidential and Vice Presidential ticket- since those two candidates represent the majority of the voters. Therefore it should’ve been Biden and Sanders.
Please don't post Biden Gifs on my timeline... 🤣🤣🤣
And still KKK endorses Trump and all racists rally behind him..strange that your Biden is the secret racist attacks don't work when he was the running mate of first black man to be president and his running mate is going to be the first black woman to be vice president..hmm..
I am for the Biden/Harris ticket for President &amp; Vice President.  Please join me.
This is the exact thing I called out today.
If that's all it took to nullify your vote for Biden then maybe you weren't all that rogue to begin with and just another phony Republican acting as if they don't like Trump.
Y’all Jaye really just complimented a record with Drake on it. I thought I’d never live to see the day.   Biden definitely winning in November

Gee I wish there was nuance on this site to be able to voice a legit criticism of Biden without getting screamed at about how Trump is worse. As if that fact makes the criticism invalid.

MN-8? Biden's not gonna win it
Calls people trolls and argues with other resisters. Then tells other people to give them the axe. Kind of rude.
Great  blog here. You shouldn't listen to anyone who says they're going to push Biden to the left during his presidency if they're telling you to keep your mouth shut now

It's funny how Biden and Harris have flip-flopped on everything they once believed in, including each other. You don't think they'd trade people like they've traded values? They hold nothing dear, except power.
I'm supporting Biden/Harris.  You do you !  Be productive in whatever it is you do, young man !
What about this tweet nullified or would dissuade a Republican voting for Biden?
The national news of Biden's VP pick of Kamala Harris was affirming to North Carolina HBCU grads, who we interviewed here:

Absolutely! However! Biden has no Memory! Dementia or Selective Memory?
The phrase “going postal” will now mean voting for Biden.
You should do what is best for the country and vote for Joe Biden. You should also vote BLUE for your Senator and your Congressman - without all three, it will be more of the same. You want to keep voting GOP, do it for your state offices - but please, vote Dem for federal. TY
Biden lost that vote during the duration of his whole career. I can’t believe lesser evilists are so entitled about this. Biden never had my vote during 2020 or the last 4 years.
When you &amp; George Bush came out and endorsed Biden recently, did you not think that we’d put two and two together to come to the conclusion that you both, somewhere along the way, became part of the deep state Democrat corruption?  Do you that poorly of law abiding Americans?
A lot of what is on your list us what Biden is now supporting, tRUMP is a Koch puppet which is a hell of a lot worse than Bloomberg!
You are the reason #IMPOTUS may win because you are so hung up on Bernie not getting the nomination that you are willing to bite off your own nose to spite your face. Bernie is supporting Biden so get over it!
Agreed. The most corrupt administration in American history will be held accountable when Biden is President.

Thanks for the shoutout! 🌊💃🏻
The lefts position for as many elections as I can remember has been that if the GOP wins, life as the left knows it is over.  Harken back to 2012, Biden commenting on Mitt Romney "They're going to put you all back in chains."    So get out with your "partisanship" BS.
npr feeling saucy today.  let's see how they do on calling out the lies of biden of harris.
Does the law matter? If there's a question, then it needs to be vetted. If she is disqualified, then she shouldn't be able to run for the office. If qualified, then she runs. What's the problem? Other than Biden's people should have vetted her ALREADY.

I'd be careful about drawing too close of correlations between phrases and politicians' polling numbers, however here's where it stands:  Biden–who has used the phrase "black lives matter" (58% favorable) and opposes defunding the police (70% unfavorable)–is slightly up.
Oops. Wrong link above. Here are the poll results, which include public sentiment on "Defund the police," as well as the statements "law and order" and "black lives matter."

I wish I could do Biden's debate prep.
I mean there’s no denying that he’s incompetent. You could argue Joe Biden isn’t the best candidate, but at least he’ll put the right people in charge.
Every time I see Biden, he reminds me of what people look like in a casket and it makes me feel uneasy.

So I guess you won’t be voting for Biden either?  Why can’t the Democrats have a better candidate? What is an Independent to do?
Here is a not insane response.   Dems are already wearing a mask, so we are perfectly comfortable with the 3 MONTH period Biden called for and hope the rest of the country will join in.   Liberals didn't close schools/football, it was educators who understand the health risk.
Biden handlers will no longer let Joe dress himself
Are people that short sighted? Voting in THIS election is simply about preserving the republic.  Biden/Harris are not perfect, but if/when they are elected, we will live to fight another day. Trump is RIGHT now moving to steal the election. He needs to be stopped.

"For those whom God to ruin has design'd, He fits for fate, and first destroys their mind."  You are officially out of your minds!
You.  I am on the fence, but scolding by liberals makes me want to not vote for Biden  aka vote for Trump as you would put it.
#Biden can’t form an impromptu sentence...and they are afraid of what #KamalaHarris might say.  Too risky.
😂😂😂 I don't know about PR team, but Dem Leadership have sure turned into a bunch little warriors.  So in your estimation of scariness? 1. Harris 2. Pense 3. ¿Biden or Trump? 😂😂😂
No one actually cares who you vote for !! We don’t need your vote !!! If you vote for Biden you are a socialist !! You are admitting that you are OK with the government making decisions for you
Very disappointed in Joe Biden’s choice of running mate
They don’t want to vote “FOR” Joe Biden but they want to vote “AGAINST” Donald Trump
It’s amazing that Biden\Trump\Pence\Harris are the best this country has to offer.  What a fucking joke.

It should not be that close!!!  It Should be  Biden 90% trump 10%
“It appears that (President Trump has) lost some party loyalty, and he’s lost some of the voters that define themselves as very conservative. And, so he’s going to have to make up some of the ground.” #CivitasPoll #ncpol
I would argue your hostility to the left is counterproductive to your presumed goal of getting some of them to vote for Biden.
I’m seriously wondering if that’s not why Biden is saying that. It’s been proven over and over that they have little to no affect on prevention of the virus.
Trump is suing TV stations who run (truthful) campaign ads against him Trump's lawyers are working overtime to get a 3rd party candidate on the ballot to pull votes away from Biden in swing states
You are not just voting for Biden in November. If he was to claim presidency, there are serveral other appointed positions to be filled that can serve as change to our country.  These positions include the Attorney General, Supreme Court Seats, Secretary of Education etc.
Remember the long, long parade of Biden-alternatives from Democratic leadership? How the hell do you think Deval Patrick would be doing right now???
Vote for Biden. It's the only way to end this. No Marshal of the Supreme Court, no impeachment, no 25th amendment, and no handshake with a Brazilian minister who has COVID. There's just one thing we can do. I hope enough of us do it.
And you are holding millions of Americans hostage with this phony shut down of the economy. Your zeal to destroy Trump is dragging down the livelihoods of millions of Americans over what is no more than a bad flu season. I wager the masks come off November 4th if Biden wins.
Trump Lies, lies , lies.  Dems only want to help Dem run cities. Lie Dem cities are poorly run. Lie Dems want to close schools so they can’t be used 4 polling. Stupid Lie Mail in voting is fraudulent. Lie Biden asked him to mandate masks. LIE!  Aaaaaaah!

Clearly an over sample of blue states and if unskewed turns out 97% of Americans prefer to starve and lose their homes than let Biden and Harris give them health care and an Obama phone
So the  poll (CPD used in 2016) released today asks about Biden and Trump and does NOT mention any other candidate. So when  hides behind their arbitrary requirement of 15% to participate in a debate, just remember, THEY AREN’T EVEN ASKING ABOUT OTHER CANDIDATES!
Biden, Harris Want To Force Schools To Let Biological Males into Girls' Sports
Trying to figure out who’s more mentally deranged ... you ... or  U.S PRESIDENT TRUMP: “AT EVERY TURN, BIDEN HAS BEEN WRONG ABOUT THE VIRUS - IGNORING THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE”
Thinking of starting a PAC - NC Republicans for Biden. Need to get rid of this monster and his enablers (which includes you Senator Tillis).
Do that at the debate Mr President.  So the works can see.  Go on.  Avoid.  And then watch Vice President Biden answer every question in complete sentences and in complete honesty.  He was so flustered because he doesn’t know truth.
Joe Biden is also a bad representative of my values, but that’s another discussion. What about when trump restricts in person voting and congressional democrats do nothing but tweet and send letters on their way to yet another recess?
Free infomercials?     Our local TV stations showed 4 interviews after Harris’s selection as the Democrat’s VP candidate.  They were nothing but non stop praise about her and Biden.
So Biden wants all Americans to wear masks for at least 3 months.....what is in 3 months? The election. #tinfoilhatthoughts
I saw a Trump commercial with a woman saying we can't rebuild if Biden is elected because he's too weak.  Biden should create, like a rap battle commercial response asking, "Now how did we get into this mess in the first place? Why exactly do we need to rebuild? Just asking?"
It’s very clear Biden said wear the masks for the next three months so that as soon as the election gets here they can say take the mask off and say it was their leadership that cured the country if they win. Just another ploy because one way or another Covid ends on November 3rd
Exactly. Their corruption is In Your Face, So What Are You Going To Do About It? It shakes your faith in people to know that so many voters will still vote for them in November. Biden's election is not a given.
Turn-out for Democrats exceeded 2016 and is on course to reach 2008 numbers.  Biden and Trump both got 18 million votes this year, but Democrats had 36 million total votes cast with a contested primary.  Biden wound up winning 51% of the vote.
Nobody's expecting Biden (or Trump) to fix all the world's problems. But it sure would be nice to have a President that wasn't actively making more!
Well for one nick cannon is a definite racist lol  but i mean obama picked joe biden as VP cause he was white so im pretty sure thats the only reason biden is picking kamala..and shes a women so even mor evotes
Very easily. Biden/Trump will focus on the NY/Calif voters, while not caring about the middle of the country. Why go to Nashville to get 500k votes when I can go to LA to get 5 million? Not getting into a political discussion but don't rewrite the constitution to benefit yourself
“And right after Reagan’s ‘wall’ speech, Biden again took the line that Reagan shouldn’t dare to provoke the Soviet bear.”  Sheesh...has Biden been right about ANY foreign policy decision?
No one even said they weren't voting for Biden in the thread so......????
We asked the public about a number of key federal and state races, but also surveyed their opinion on several political statements/slogans, such as: - Law and Order - Black Lives Matter - Defund the Police You can take a look at these results here.
If there is a fair election and the votes are all counted cleanly (big if), then Biden will win.  If Biden wins and Trump refuses to leave, then the US military is constitutionally bound, more than able, and will likely be very willing, to escort him out of the White House.
Biden &amp; Harris  Campaign 2020!
#ncpol On the same day   completes a poll showing Biden with a one percentage point lead.....
It’s hilarious that these people think Biden has any clue how to fast track an economic recovery. The first thing he will do is give away Nancy’s 3 Trillion dollars, then raise taxes by 4 Trillion while a ton of ppl are out of work. He’ll spend the SS money in his first month.
Biden can suck my balls
Historic, especially because so much ground had to be made because Obama &amp; Biden totally sold Israel up the river. Stabbed them in back
Honestly &amp; selecting Kamala for VP, completely solidified their stance with progressive politics/voters, Hispanic/Latino peeps, &amp; young voters. It’s honestly a shame. I can’t say I hope Biden loses but I do hope they find out how dumb it is to alienate such a large voting bloc.
Wow, just wow. Such a lie. Reagan had the longest peacetime recovery EVER. Obama and Biden destroyed the economy.  History revisionism will not work this time lady.  #reclaimingmytime
Republican voters, PLEASE force your representatives to have actual ideas and policies! Attacking the left is *not* a policy. "Biden wants to raise your taxes " Bleh - too easy. Why does he want to raise taxes? How much? Where will the $$ go? Make Haley prove it. Dig deeper.
I literally have been wondering who, if anyone, had been doing any leg work within the Biden camp to gain the Hispanic/Latino vote since Bernie dropped out and I’m pretty sure it’s no one.
I just hope if Biden becomes president ( and God I sure hope so) Kamala remembers she is vice president not the president.😉
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate amid coronavirus pandemic
My 70 year old father is one of them.   Just like Joe Biden, he may have made some mistakes along the way, but he’s learned and is a good man.   I’m proud he is my father. 💕
When people say we can move Biden on policy, I always ask why do they expect Biden to move if you’re going to vote for him no matter what? It makes no sense.
The mass incarceration ticket of 2020 pledges unconditional support to Israel "unlike some Democrats." Interesting.  Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's VP pick - here's what Jewish voters should know - Jewish Telegraphic Agency  via
She's a hypocrite for calling Biden a racist and saying she believed the accusations against him SMH. She prosecuted over 1500 marijuana cases, but laughed when she was asked is she smoked. It's pathetic! Biden and her will be the incarcerating dream team.
Obama/Biden.  Hands down THE MOST CORRUPT administration in the history of our nation.  I don’t care what your politics are, open your eyes to what the Democrats have become past 20 years.  I used to be one of them.  Time for others to wake the hell up...they do nothing but lie.
Uhhhh..#Biden and #Obama already had 8 years to try to get this done but did not. #Fail
Did Biden say it would not help democracy to prosecute tRump? Oh yes hell it will sir. Along with each and every one of his criminal co-conspirators.
It should not be that close!!! Biden and Harris should be ahead by a landslide!!
🤣🤣🤣 they all puppets.. ima vote for Biden though
None of them. It’s all about JoJo!! #JoJorgensen2020 !!!! Voting for Biden or Trump is a vote for old racist sex offending pedophiles!!
People can ACTUALLY SUPPORT AND VOTE FOR KAMALA because she's QUALIFIED.. not just cause she's BLACK! BIDEN-HARRIS 2020
I'm watching VP Biden speak abt the virus. What a breath of fresh air! He makes sense, I CAN trust what he says &amp; he's not degrading his apponents by calling them names &amp; acting like a bully. He's acting like an adult &amp; leader. It's like someone we've known has finally come home.
I bet Biden's happy it's only 56%!
If you don't vote for Biden, and could otherwise vote and are not disabled/afflicted in some similar way, it helps Trump win. You are, therefore, a Trump supporter. Vote for Biden and bug the hell out of him if he wins.
I think you mean “Kamala Harris news conference”....because Joe Biden is just an empty vessel....
Obama had bipartisan cabinet. If Mitt Romney would just get some courage and come out for Biden I would have no objection to his being SecOfState--and it would also be a slap in face to Trump 😊
i dont think you cab be making fun of biden when your own idiot cant do the same
”If he wins, you’re going to end up with a disaster,” he claimed of Democratic rival Joe Biden."  No sense of the self-own.  Aren't we're in a disaster *right now* thanks in no small part  to your ineptitude?  Can we just skip ahead to Nov 3?
I'm pretty sure helping Black people wasn't in the job description packet Biden handed her.
Going to make calls for Biden to spite her now.
I'm going to go make calls for Biden to spite you, Naomi.
Anyone that believes Joe Biden writes his own tweets hasnt been paying attention.
Most of the U.S. government’s 200 immigration detention centers are run by private contractors holding asylum seekers and other immigrants accused of administrative violations or awaiting deportation.
You're forgetting how racist this version of the GOP has become. They could not conceive that Biden would actually choose someone who wasn't lily white to run with him, particularly someone as strong as Harris.
We all know thatTucker/Hannity have a huge draw nightly, and I've never contested that.  I'm saying lets look at the data on a day that Biden doesn't pick his VP in the 18-49 segment. We already know the NBA heavily outdraws all news in 18-49 demo by a landslide on a normal day.
I’m sure mlk would love Biden who is a bigot then and I’m sure he died so he could be voted for
That's great and all but please don't give the Biden administration a pass like you did for the Obama administration. If Trump taught us nothing else it's that when you ignore abuses from your side, they will be doubled down on by the other side.
There might not be any partisan differences in states that already use VBM, but if bluer states increase its use while reddish states do not, vote margins for Biden will increase.  He could win nationally by 7 million votes and yet lose in the EC.
Biden and Harris are the same as trump and Biden is a klansman who brought slave markets to Libya but these ppl against confederates got no issue with slavery we brought there
Trump will do far worse (and less) for this country than Biden but....they both suck. Politics is always choosing between the lesser of two evils. We need an ACTUAL change to the system. I’m sick of choosing between two shitty options.
And Mark responded that the data here is skewed to the topical news of Biden picking his VP. It's literally the first line in the summary of data on the link Clay provided.  But alas, its still apples and oranges, per my earlier point.
vote for biden because you will be able to hold him accountable also please donot hold biden accountable because that is a vote for trump
I am afraid there is no more time to settle for these bullshit artists. Ecologically, sociologically, and financially Biden is the worst choice imaginable. It is time to quell this.
Joe Biden has welcomed progressive input in his campaign. Lefty activists are hoping Kamala Harris, his vice-presidential nominee, will be just as flexible,  reports:
Watch Joe Biden and Kamala Harris First Joint Campaign Event Here
It would help to get a commitment to a policy platform so we can hold them accountable.  So far in the last 48 hours Biden has backtracked on M4A by saying people will get free coronavirus treatment.  Dude what about after that?!?!
Obama/Biden: "Listen to scientific experts. Constantly reevaluate options." Trump/Pence: "The FDA is wrong. Listen to the demon-sperm lady. There are only two options: take Hydroxychloroquine or inject yourself with bleach."
Your tweets alone can cheer me up. I’m trying to find the collection of montages from the 25th Ammendment now. I’m sick of the orange clown saying Biden is not mentally fit. 4 some reason I think it was u who put them 2gether. I want 2 post them so bad on FB where the asses are!
Dear Nate, We are not joined at the hip. Biden hasn't done anything to earn a vote. He believes he is entitled. Most Bernie Bros were Independents, and lean towards 'green' policies and aid the working class. Biden ain't that.
Biden and Kamala..tough on crime but also on board with police reforms..that's what the country needs right now..but we need to push for more reforms and more crime prevention than prison filling..
Obama/Biden: "Do this." Trump/Pence: "Do the opposite of this."
Yes, yes, yes.This, to me, is job one for the Biden-Harris administration.
Biden owns a gun
The August #CivitasPoll is out! Some important numbers that reveal a couple of very tight races.   Trump/Biden: 44%/45%  Tillis/Cunningham: 38%/41%  Cooper/Forest: 49%/39%  #ncpol
Clearly you’re not interested, I just don’t really care. “Lol Dr. Jill Biden had no ‘porn pics’” jokes are sex shaming and obnoxious. Comments about people being less-than because they don’t have a college degree are elitist.
This country is a mess. As a Conservative, I want a guaranteed, accurate election. In person or absentee with Verified ID. There is too much division and distrust on both sides for any mail in nonsense. And if we LEGITIMATELY elect Biden, then so be it. I’ll do what I have to.
Joe Biden is an idiot! 😡😡
When you are running against the most hated man in America.....
Biden and trump are the same to me so I’m not about to waste energy arguing over a rigged system, this is why ppl don’t vote
Still having trouble in #NorthCarolina getting anyone on the left to bet the farm on #Biden winning 15 electoral votes this fall out of NC. #TheyMustKnowSomething
Wait. Is your argument that Trump is a fascist but Biden is better because he'll just *think* about bring us more fascism and THAT'S what makes Biden better? You do realize how stupid that sounds, right?  Our country is not a democracy: It's an oligarchy with the guise of
Biden never had a chance against  😂🤣. Gonna love seeing yall cry for another 4 years.
In Biden's defense, I suggest that Trump is insulting men everywhere by claiming to be one.
See this is a true American, Biden and his campaign actually believe made in America is best. Whereas the tRUMP only gives lip service to the idea.  #VoteBlueIn2020 #DumpTrumpNow #BidenHarris
"...only the 2nd Black woman ever to serve in the US Senate, and the first South Asian-American woman. No Black woman has ever served as the governor of a state...no Black woman had ever been on a major party’s presidential ticket."   The power she has!
I keep tryna say that only way Trump loses is if he fumbles hard, but instead Biden's the one continually fumbling. It's gotta be game over right?
LISTEN. Biden should’ve picked Bernie as his running mate. But I see what they did. Having an African American woman on the ticket is MONUMENTAL, so I’m not taking anything from her. Trump is going to spend the next 80 days focusing on defining a woman.. &amp; what she should be.
Ads here in NC by the admin take Biden’s “Not gonna be happy about raised taxes” (referring to the rich and himself, actually) and making it seem like he meant the middle and lower classes.  Still yet to see an ad about their successful COVID management though. Weird.
What jobs? We're tired of all the lies. That's why the Biden&amp; Harris ticket is the honest WINNER!
Remember all the hiring signs we saw in the past 3 years;  displayed in stores, on back of vehicles, billboards and everywhere we looked? Now think back to the 8 years of Biden and Obama.
Top story: WATCH: New Trump ad hammers Biden/Harris over Joe's endless array of racial gaffes  see more
This is exactly the tactics Putin uses and this will happen in every Republican state Trump needs. FL, TX, GA, PA, OHIO, etc..  Biden and Harris should file complaints now.
We have been hearing no defense for Biden since the reports surfaced... Unilaterally, the Democratic party has chosen to completely ignore or disavow outright the claims. I understand innocent until proven guilty, but people should at least investigate and have an inquiry.
WOW ! THAT IS DISTURBING TO SAY THE LEAST.
Hillary lost because of Michigan, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Ohio, Florida, and Wisconsin’s going for Trump. Biden will win VA. Whomever wins won’t be decided by VA voters. Volunteer with the campaign if you want to make an impact.
I’m good as long as trump isn’t president. We’ve had racist presidents before and the country was ran way better than this. If Trump wins because we keep slandering Biden and Harris which will split the votes or cause us to not vote at all... ima have a mental break down 😓
“Never forget peasants black people are a monolithic culture and will always fall in line when we ask.”        —Joe Biden (probably)
The media really wants me to be excited about the Biden/Harris presidential ticket don't they.
Got a loooot of white people on my feed saying that a Biden presidency would be just as bad as another Trump term. Um, hello?

I.. yall.. did trump say that kamala harris was nastier to joe biden than.. Pocahontas? Trump supporters, this yall guy? 😂😂😂😂😂
Its only going to get worse when the unemployment checks stop next year and the real depression begins. And when Biden- Harris win or when the Left to contests a Trump victory.
You better take the social out of your name if you're going to vote for Biden and Harris. They're both tough-on-crime Republicans with a D next to their name.
Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election | Fox Business: Harris is a Sanders socialist , already rejected by the voters.
Don't forget Biden also wrote the 1983 Comprehensive Forfeiture Act that allows cops to steal people's property without charging them with a crime!
A phrase you are beginning to hear pop up in private conversations about #presidential race is: '#JoeBiden has a lead..but his support is a mile wide and an inch deep". One operative characterized Biden support in #NorthCarolina as "1/4 mile wide 1/4 inch deep" Keep that in mind
PS...  Had he picked Klobuchar I suspect that would have been the knockout punch.  She would have delivered the midwest.  Harris?  Outside of California she's not well liked and never polled more than 1%.  California already voted for Biden so it doesn't matter.
Look what I ended up in Facebook jail for. Yup posting a positive comment on an article about Biden Harris speech🤦🏽‍♀️
The Catholic Church teaches that “direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law,” and “formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense.” (CCC 2271-2272)
Biden couldn't beat a bowl of eggbeaters
Are you trying to show how much harder Biden will work tan you?
With Biden &amp; Harris we should expect millions instead of thousands of illegal immigrants.
good interview with Jack Lew this morning.  If Biden wins you think he brings him back to Treasury to tackle this mess? Or consider keeping Mnuchin and allowing him to negotiate without the limitations he clearly has now.
The entire world has a "dog in this fight."  Or...have you not been paying attention?  I do tend to agree with Gundlach, however.  She was poor choice for Biden.
That’s really gracious of Carlson to campaign so hard for Biden.
It means Biden is a stooge who they put up because they see him as “electable”. Then, they slip an in unelected socialist (Heels up) to fast track the socialist agenda that Trump halted. I feel like the voters will see through this obvious trickery and do the right thing though.

Is that to win the vote? Or to hypnotize Biden?
A 3T relief bill does more than a 1T relief bill and a lot more than Ted Cruz and Rand Paul's 0 dollar spending.Don't tell me GOP cares about deficit as if we haven't added historical national debt in the last 4 years.Pass the relief bill and vote biden to end the mess..
Hats off to Biden for making political ads that are actually pro-biden instead of just anti-trump. I still don't like the guy, but I can at least respect that, especially since dissing Trump is so easy.
Bring up Biden and Harris records was it relates to prison and arrest and then bring up Trump and Pences.

Ik Ik but I’m voting for Biden bc it’s not Trump, supporting a Black women, and bc it’s not Trump, supporting HBCU culture, and most importantly bc it’s not Trump.

So funny to roast the only viable option to Trump. Love it. Keep it up. Motivate people to not vote for Biden and get Trump 4 more years
I doubt if Biden ever left the basement. That’s not how elections are won.
I’m doing absentee ballots or early voting for Biden then. 8 hour waits ain’t worth it.

I have family members who think our current situation (i mean all of it) is great and Biden is a far left socialist. And I’ve concluded that it stems from this attitude “I got mine and I don’t care about anyone else”. American exceptionalism is quite the drug.

Come on now Matt. It's almost September. Go ahead and tweet your half-hearted last-minute gotta-get-Trump-out-of-there endorsement of Biden now and don't keep us waiting.

Fuck Joe Biden
Niggas are like “bIdeN aNd kAmaLa aRenT aN imProVemenT” when there’s a whole ass racist floundering as the US is in the middle a pandemic induced recessionThe key word there is "try". Biden/Harris will absolutely try to do things we don't like, but anything big like that done without broad bipartisan support will either provoke an electoral backlash or be tied up in court for years. Probably both.
China Is the Key to Hollywood—and Joe Biden - Crisis Magazine
Now that we all saw how Trump tried to quid pro quo fake dirt on Biden from Ukraine, it would be a November surprise if a single person believed any report from  Barr or trump.
Biden will never get to choose!
In this Nation! Political differences are supposed to be based in ideology. Not criminal Activity from the Highest office down. Joe Biden belongs in Prison! Along with Hillary, Rice   Comey, Brennan, and every other person who has betrayed their oath of office for personal gain.
I would say that Biden is Catholic*** or quality it somehow.   Many priests won’t perform communion or other rites while he had a left leaning abortion agenda.  Seems like a fake religion like trump standing with a bible photo.
I feel you. If you just think logically, the dems were very divided in 2016.. and are pretty united right now. There is a female POC on the ticket, and several prominent republicans have abandoned Trump. Biden is the perfect centrist to peel away his support.
Did anybody tell Biden?
Hey, Democrats. I have heard the new Biden ads, in which he says that everyone has a right to be treated with dignity. Considering what he and Harris plan for preborn children, someone should explain to him what dignity means.
Biden and Harris receive favorability bounces, says a new Politico/Morning Consult poll.  Biden Favorable: 51% (+4 since Aug 10) Unfavorable: 44% (-4)  Harris Favorable: 45% (+12 since late July) Unfavorable: 37% (+3)

Not sure what I was expecting from Biden's VP pick, but it definitely wasn't this:
The more they’re doing this, the more people would shift to Trump. Vote for Biden is a vote for this chaos to continue.
Well, Patrick...I’ve seen a mentally-challenged kid goes on with his daily life; so if that kid can do it, so can Biden! I believe in you, Biden! Bless your heart! 🤡  Who knows, might be fun to have the first demented person as president. 😝
Only if Biden steals the election
When pointing out a blatant lie from Biden, why is it necessary to state you’re not a fan of Trump? Just point out the damn lie!
If Joe Biden Speaks about anything, it is to build confidence in every American Child above the age of 5. That they are already intellectually developed beyond the level of a Democrat Presidential Candidate. And therefore they can accomplish anything if they so choose.
So are you writing a column about Joe Biden, since he just mispronounced her name????
I’d like to see side by side videos of Trump and Biden speaking. Somebody make one.
People must understand that the Democrats are NOT the party that "cares." They are that, you are voting foe party of genocide. if you vote Democrat, you are voting for killing the helpless.
Joe Biden's Awful Vice Presidential Pick
Hahaha, I completely agree. The Kamala Harris pick makes a lot of sense to me because she will immediately demonstrate an organizational competence the Biden and Trump both lack. It may not be impactful now, but when she has to speak I expect her to dominate the weak competition.
Thanks for sharing the good news! I’m even happier I get to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket now.
Trump's handling of COVID is the issue of the election, but there seems to be more at play here. Only 38 percent of Americans approve of his response. 58 disapprove. Biden's pathetic campaign is making this WAY closer than it should be.
Biden didn't pick anybody. The party picked #HeelsUpHarris. #SniffAndBlow2020

Now I posted this on FB, some got their panties in a twist. 🤔 Biden and Harris is applying for a Job! Last time I check when you apply for a job, don’t the do a background check, look at your previous job history? 🚶🏽‍♂️🚶🏽‍♂️🚶🏽‍♂️🚶🏽‍♂️
Trump is stealing campain funds to pay Mar-a_Lago expenses. The FBI cares that he’s a criminal. PS- 4 bankruptcies, no he really didnt get rich running his private business. Plus Moscow Mitch is wealthier than Biden.  Nice job at misinformation,  typical MAGA fuck Shit!
The official tally is Biden in a landslide and Putins VP is off to Russia!
Maybe Biden should tweet a pic of the 165,000 dead souls due to the TrumpVirus?
Why is JILL Biden speaking at the MSDNC convention and not Quid Pro Joe??!

. who recently said the VP pick would determine whether or not she could cast a ballot for Biden, appears to be on board with    Article also details why it's going to be tough for Trump to brand Harris as an extremist, cuz she isn't.
Let’s Go! #vote   Repost  ・・・ Joe Biden is a leader who can unify the American people, because he's spent his life fighting for the American people. And as president, he will build an America that lives…
We're damned if we vote for Trump and we're damned if we vote for Biden   But y'all even more upset that people are deciding to not vote
BREAKING📢   Joe Biden just announced the next Vice President of the United States will still be Mike Pence.
Really? Did you watch the primary debates? Harris had one big moment (when she went after Biden) and then got taken down hard by Gabbard the next debate. Wasn't a factor after that. I doubt Pence is all that worried.

To me, it was more her total ignorance that was so appalling. I feel like i voted for biden, rather than obama, just to be sure she never got to the white house. I was really angry at mccain for his choice.

Joe Biden is more Racist than every member of the Republican party Combined.
Yeah they are. Khameni thought he could terrorize the world with impunity. Trump taught him the hard way. His pronunciation of words is irrelevant. You probably think Biden will be some kind of diplomatic genius ay?
Take heart, he is a one termer so he can make the hard choices to get this nightmare behind us. I like Biden, that wasn't meant to dismiss him in any way.

Joe Biden didn't go to a private school where his father was on the Board of Governors. Considering how poorly Donald Trump reads, I'm sure it was suggested that he repeat first grade, but who wants to tell the boss his son can't read?

It's kinda hilarious that they actually slapped a tweet on an absentee ballot request form. It's also a flat out lie that Joe Biden wants to defund the police (he said he wants to increase police funding). They're grasping at straws here.
Biden shouldn't even be on there, Kamala Harris is a black woman but she's also the worst. I wanted a break I think and so when it was announced people around me (yts)..
I'm guilty of being one of those "WeLl wHat'S tHE AlterNatIve" ass people when it comes to Biden/Harris. I've realized it is because I want a snippet of sunshine. And then going down that rabbit hole, I realize I've been conditioned to accept crumbs...

Trump and Barr are CRIMINALS! Both MUST go to FEDERAL PRISON! Trump suggests Barr could be ‘greatest of all time’ if he finds Obama administration spied on him.

Every time Joe Biden speaks it becomes more obvious that something is not right. It’s sad that the left hates Trump so much they are willing to put him through all of this it’s cruel.But there is no coherent reading where Biden in 08/12 counts as Catholic, Tim Kaine and John Kerry count, but Biden in 20 doesn’t.
But you still weren’t sure you’d vote for Biden unless you liked the VP pick? OK, then.
I’m sure Joe Biden will make a speech very much like this. We just have to VOTE and try to live to see it.
Mass has supermajorities in both houses and they could have made Baker pick a Dem.  I wish Warren would have won and would have been picked but I don't think the moment gave Biden the room to pick her. I would bet he wanted to.

Did that trigger you 😂😂 Biden is losing his mind Trump never had one. Neither should be president but I trust Democrats more than Republicans that’s for sure
Someone earlier whos screen name and picture was John Brown was saying vote for Biden.  Not in a million years would John Brown vote for segregationist Biden.  The gaslighting is nearing war crime levels.
I’m sorry, I can’t support this ticket, Joe Biden literally picked the worst woman, out of every woman that was in the running for the VP Slot.  The woman takes money from Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump, Steve Mnuchin, and came from a family that were slave owners.  Voting 3rd Party.

Short answer—vote for Biden anyway!
No. Biden is too inept and delusional to be the devil. He's more one of these clowns

I'm more concerned by her limited qualifications and "on the record" opposition with Biden.   In addition, Biden excluded 93% of the population by using race &amp; gender as a prerequisite for the job.  How is this acceptable??
I am 100% positive John Brown would not vote for segregationist Joe Biden.  JFC
Wake me up when we get to call crime bill "super predator" nothing will substantially change Biden racist.
Why?  At every opportunity the DNC has told the youth to get lost.  Why vote for people that do not care one bit what we want?  And yea Trump is bad. Thats not a good enough reason when Biden and Kamala have just as bad policies and will be more competent in their execution.
Nobody else thinks it's suspicious that Kamala the wrestler died ON THE SAME DAY that Kamala Harris was announced as Biden's running mate?
You may say, “Biden’s not left enough” or “Look at Harris’ record.” Guess what? Don’t care. Anything other than a vote for a candidate that can win and removes trump from office is complicit in allowing trump to continue his destruction of this democracy. 3/
Its fucked no matter what BUT at least with Biden/Harris we will get normalcy back in government. Basically we get Obama back. I see it as live to fight another day. Its not what we want but it'll do for now until someone better can come around for real change.
Yep. Biden/Harris ticket is not ideal at all. It will be centrism at its best with some maybe good bills that can get pushed through with no real progressive change but what are our alternatives? Nothing. I am voting for no reason other than a sense of normalcy in the WH again.
Weve been hearing this since the beginning.  This is fantasy. No one is coming to save us. Worthless Congress is on vacation.  Biden/Kamala srent the answer either.  We protect us. #GeneralStrike and revolution.
I’m sure she feels totally “destroyed“ after getting picked as Biden‘s running mate. 😉
'Deeply flawed': Catholics react to Harris VP selection  via
Do Biden or Kamala have a plan to decarcerste people or is it business as usual?  Harm reduction is false.
Yea it is. It would be absolutely understandable if under Obama/Biden poverty decreased, cops were held accountable for murdering innocent black folks, imperialist drone strikes stopped, and green house gas emissions decreased.  None of those things happened.
I am 100 percent on board with this. Biden and Harris need to be held to a high standard once elected, but the alternative to getting them elected is more Trump.
Ask Anita Hill about Biden's Supreme Court credentials
I mean, the majority of this list is either wishful thinking or just BS... but the few concrete points here are more than enough reason to vote for Biden, as shitty as he is
3 new national polls of registered voters were released today, with Biden leading by 10, 11 &amp; 13 points, all taken before the Harris VP announcement. Now you know why Trump is illegally destroying the USPS &amp; attacking voting by mail.
You have only 2 choices. trump or Biden. Depends on how much you regret it. If you vote for anyone other than Biden,  you ARE voting for trump. That unsure vote is the ONLY reason trump won last time!
This is a really good piece by  about the Obama-Biden relationship, which was always a lot more complicated and tense than the fantasy version of it.
Vote for Biden.
The democrats signaled that they don’t mind if Trump wins when they nominated Biden
Super classy, but makes the point: you won't need RM House in Biden's world. Govt-run medical system assures all sick kids will just be left to die.
After almost 4 years of everything we've seen Trump tweet, say, and have books and court cases about, having supporters ask us "how you can support Biden, he's so inappropriate" seems, I dunno, self-evident...

And there's no particular reason to be confident that partisan State Supreme Courts or even SCOTUS will be especially interested in resolving the Biden campaign's emergency petitions the way they are interested in hearing emergency Trump petitions
Response: I will answer when you ask hidin Biden about his half century of racism.
On one hand yes it SEEMS like the dozens of bad faith legal actions would eventually be resolved in the favor of Biden, on the other hand an 11th hour order granted by a random partisan state judge in a critical swing state could be terrible
Ideally this won't be resolved this year, and with no leadership and voiding all the horrible things done, we can have a humane approach in the Biden/Harris administration.
She lost the election. Not saying to wait, saying to fight them *now* which people won't do if they assume Biden will win.   I always have faith in Democrats to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, especially when they act like they are in a fair fight when they are so not.

Harris is an empty suit, along with Biden. She's a pathological liar. Amazing that the people running for the highest office in the land, do not know how the position even works? God helps us all!!
Both Biden’s are hidden.
Hillary Clinton suggests she's willing to serve in Biden administration: 'I'm ready to help any way I can'  #FoxNews. Help?  When has she helped anyone/anything except the Clinton bank account.
One under discussed difference between the Clinton and Biden campaigns is that Biden’s team have made early and consistent investments in the states that shocked us on election night ‘16 by voting for Trump.   Clinton effectively ran no campaign in several of these states.
Trump has been in office 3 years.  Biden has been in office 48 years.  What make you think Biden will do something now?   Albert Einstein : “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” ...  Say no to Joe!
Good point. I think conclusions about not having a policy mandate are difficult to make in polls that demand only one response. This one simply shows that getting Trump out of office is the highest priority for Biden voters.
Not sure you can reach this conclusion from a poll that requires you to select only one response. Getting Trump out of office is the highest priority for those voting for Biden. Full stop.

Kamala supports forced gun confiscation. Choosing her has moved the Biden campaign further to the left on gun control – more radical than any other major party campaign in recent history. Kamala’s baggage has damaged the perception that Biden is a more moderate Democrat. #2A
Sounds good - I'll be making the case (and Christian case) to vote Biden/Harris as much as I can
As a survivor of CSA and rape, I am FAR more offended by this adult woman’s interactions WITH A CHILD than I am by anything Joe Biden has ever been proven to have done with anyone. She *deliberately* and continually crossed lines with this kid. That’s appalling.
TBC - "GO VOTE" means any way that doesn't rely on the mail delivering stuff. Biden better fix the USPS - one of our great institutions.
i really don't bother to embroil myself in p*litics related stuff but what exactly did joe biden mean with the whole "corn pop" story and his hairy legs? i feel like i'm having a TBI b/c i've been listening to this fucking video for 14 minutes and still don't understand context
I think if we frame it as an anti-Republican thing that would help Biden we could fool them into supporting it
I called him Rudy Colludy earlier today. He's asking ignorant questions about Hunter Biden and other people/things of no relevance to the election.
But it doesn’t matter if Biden loses 10% because of voter suppression. Trump can win this if nothing is done about him blocking voting from every direction.  With what I see, I think Trump will “win” and this is all so depressing.
Translation:  Trump: 50-57 Biden: 34-41  (Based on polls historically weighted 8-15% in favor of Democrats)
Between the last three minutes of that game and watching Biden try to keep this thing between the lines through November, I don't even need booze to be completely on edge and feel like shit anymore!
Well, the difference between these two is Biden will concede victory to Trump if the election result is proven to be fair whereas, as for Trump, he will refuse to concede no matter the result. That's the difference between an adult and a toddler.

If Democrats - especially Joe Biden - don't show some bold and outraged leadership about the Republicans literally stealing our government right in front of our eyes, then I can only conclude that they aren't fit to govern us either.
A few months back I signed up for Trump's campaign mailing list out of curiosity. Not kidding...they sent me 7 emails the day Biden picked Harris as his VP. They all say exactly the same thing. Apparently those two are the farthest left candidates that the democrats could find.🤷🏽‍♂️
Right.  Trumps been in public office for 3 years.  Joe Biden has been in public office for 48 years.  Do nothing Joe.  Except make his family rich.

Was Harris or Biden my first choice? Hell no. Not even close.   Do they both embody a far more centrist ideology than that which represents mine? Absolutely.   #BidenHarris2020
Glasses fogging up. Was he also moved by the announcement that Kamala would join Biden on the ticket?
Biden and Harris: We Will Deliver

if biden/harris lose, we (progressives &amp; leftists) will be blamed no matter what we do or don't do
So, are Biden and Harris going to pod up, or nah?

Question:  Kamala Harris ran in the primary all last year, and she's been the frontrunner for Biden's running mate ever since he got the nomination.  How are the Republicans SO unprepared for her?  Did they convince themselves that Biden would pick Warren?
Biden is a racist. I concur.
I pitched a story to a major national pub asking to go to SC simply to report out the narrative playing out in churches and other key spaces w some other Biden themes I had discovered. A editor kept asking “but what poll will you be basing this story on?”
Today's morning readings from an armchair in the middle of nowhere-
It's interfaith all the way with the Biden-Harris ticket next week in Milwaukee, as  reports:
This should be enough to push NC to Biden in the 538 model, no?
New  poll has Biden +1 in NC, Cal +3, Cooper +10.
Nuclear reactor accident followed by leaked letter showing Biden pushed to get it up and running back in the 70s.
YAY! I truly hope Biden finds a place for you in the Administration!
They may try to charge Obama or Biden to affect the election. Now that Trump's crony controls the USPS, I worry about Democrat absentee/mail-in ballots being systematically thrown away based on some Saudi or Israeli algorithm Jared's buddies cooked up for him as a favor.
But but but how come Biden’s not up more in the swing states of Texas and Georgia?!?!?
YES. Biden and Harris need to always be this forceful and straightforward when talking about what Trump and his cronies are doing to the USPS. They need to regularly tell every American to drop off their absentee/mail ballots at their county elections board IN PERSON if they can.
Let’s be clear, if you don’t vote because you don’t agree with Biden’s pick. YOU ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Re: vets ending their lives due to lack of sufficient mental health svcs thru the VA, “that’s what failure looks like” says Sgt Major Sean Baker on Pete’s call w/NC Vets &amp; Military Families for Biden. Thank you for addressing our need as a country to step up for our veterans.
Trump morons and Joe Biden are opposed to MJ legalization .   That’s not a good look Joe.
Again I understand, and it’s an unfortunate situation we are in of not having a candidate that truly inspires us and speaks to us. However there are lives that are at stake. As shitty as it is fewer lives will be lost under a Biden/Harris administration.
Since we are comparing circumstances, Bernie wasn’t a realistic alternative after Super Tuesday. The momentum shifted and Biden clearly claimed victory. Polling and votes were against him.
I'm less concerned by her temperament than her qualifications.  In addition, Biden excluded 93% of the population by using race &amp; gender as a prerequisite for the job.  How is this acceptable?
As an Indian-American who was pulling for ⁦ as VP pick, this piece by ⁦ has me (more) sold on the Biden-Harris ticket
Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's newly minted running mate, told The  Politics Podcast last year that the next DOJ would have "no choice" but to act.  Biden has said that pursuing criminal charges against Trump would be "a very, very unusual thing."
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala might not in the past fuck with black people.  .... But Trumps administration REALLY doesn't fuck with Black people today 😳  Examine this cabinet of white power holding idiots --&gt;   #votekamala #fuckTrump
And y’all wanted Biden smh
Yep, this. Everyone (who’s politically aware) knows Biden/Harris ticket is not the most ideal. It’s going to be centrism with no real progressive change but what are your alternatives? Nothing.. literally nothing. I’m voting for nothing else but more normalcy back in the WH.
Ah... well If it makes you feel any better he said it would mean world war if Biden won but I’m not really sure why 🤷🏻‍♀️ we all get to take part 👏
"Americans are accustomed, still, to discussing the notion of a woman in power in terms of toleration and palatability."
It takes a president 3 years to even get shit rolling. If we get trap outta here, he going straight to jail. Give Biden a term then get him out 2024. He spend the first 3 years or covid 19 relief and war.
Speak Out After Joe Biden Outed SEAL Team 6 - Billy and Karen Vaughn  via  Dumb Ass
Proof that they are miserable people. Watching Biden/Harris yesterday is the first time in 4 years I felt joy and calm. It was like the eye of a hurricane.
All biden can do is COPY what Pres. Trump has ALREADY put in place. biden never heard of American made until Pres. Trump implemented it when he came into office.
Regardless of your party the dem vp candidate has NO right to outright LIE about our current state of affairs - This is an example of what our government will be like IF you put biden and harris in office.
Are they threatening Biden? Are they asking others to do their dirty work? The network should reprimand them. This is not news nor opinion.
Can't wait until she asks him to his face to explain the racism behind him saying, "You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America."
Still voting for Biden 🤷
Ironic that you meanly label Biden in this Tweet calling out meanness and condescension. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
You can't possibly believe this- right?   Who is "excited" about a 78 year old career politician who has been in DC for 47 years!  This is the best the Dems have to offer?   Close race for sure but Trumps base is strong and Biden/Harris doesn't energize anyone.  4 more yrs..
via  A reckoning for the meritocracy is coming.
Kamala Harris prosecuted trump/pence yesterday in stark, definitive terms.  She laid out the failures of trump point by point. Her statements were precise, accurate and by trump/pence reactions afterwards devastating. Congratulations Senator Harris.  Biden/Harris 2020
Joe Biden is utterly pathetic. Can’t even operate an iPhone correctly...AND he *needs a script* to offer his running mate the second most important job in the world!   #BidenHarris2020 #SleepyJoeAndTheHoe2020 #dementia
Yes, dead guy, Biden has been inconsistent, as opposed to  who has consistently been a racist and bigot his entire life.  Thank you, dead man...
How is this acceptable language from a US President? It’s not. Biden-Harris 2020
#youaintblackbiden ‘s best pal was  #WhiteSupremacist Sen. Robert Byrd,   Then there was  “I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate, bright &amp; clean and a nice-looking guy” yet Trump is the #racist?
Biden Pick His VP -- KAMALA Is A Cop!  via
“Black women have been the stalwarts of the Democratic Party. They’ve been the most consistent voting block, and they have been for decades.” —  Adriane Lentz-Smith comments on the selection of Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate
BREAKING:  A new poll from ABC news ranks Joe Biden's VP pick, Kamala Harris, as favorable:
We don’t spend enough time talking about how the Biden campaign is run by women. 👏
What difference does it make if she is black or white.  She is well qualified for the job and I'm excited Biden picked her.
Why doesn't Biden?
ok i’m sorry but now the kamala biden mess is kinda funny like ... i have to chuckle anytime i see the pics of them together on the timeline sksksks like bro 😭😭😭like cmon bro ..😭😭😭😭😭😭omg 😭😭 i have to laugh like this shit is literally a reality TV show 😭😭 from hell
Yeah I think you’re probably right, sadly.  I’ll vote for her and Biden, just wish she hadn’t taken money from all the worst people in our society
Adriane Lentz-Smith on Kamala Harris as Biden's running mate
We got a new stainless fridge in January and I haven’t re-magged it yet. I’m torn between maintaining the aesthetic of having new, matching appliances for the first time in my life, and restoring the awesome chaos of my crap. I think a Biden/Harris magnet could break the tie.
Would love to see him assigned to dismantle DHS, and eliminate ICE, in a Biden-Harris administration.  That’s a real wish.
“You (old) niggas in trouble.”
Most recent polls in NC have Trump edging out Biden.  No.  Where are my #NC voters at? We need to organize and strategize.  Because I'll be damned if Trump is winning my state.  And his lapdog Tillis has to go also.  #DudeGottaGo
Have you contacted  ? They keep asking for Republicans voting for Biden. They have a thread for it.  BTW, glad you joined us!
If this isn’t the most true statement I’ve read all day. I’m excited to see how the Biden-Harris ticket will help America get back on its feet. You have my vote #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Joe Biden Commercial: He didn't tweet about it. He just did it.   Me: CAN'T RELATE
I’m going all in this year, and saying yes, the national spread will be 15+ and yes, Biden/Harris will carry Montana. And Alaska.  They raised $20 million in the 24 hours since the VP announcement and crashed the merch site multiple times.  All in.
No, it wasn’t dangerous in the least hahahahaha   Nothing Obama did weighs on Biden. Biden is his own person.
Wonderful speeches from both  &amp;  ❤️  Joe Biden Introduces Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) As Running Mate  via  #BidenHarris2020
and DM (was NOT allowed to send photos). This absolutely is CENSORSHIP based on being a Biden supporter. As I had to remove my Tweet I do not have access to the conversation any more but somewhere in this my defending Biden came down to I support pedophiles! Leading to last post.
Now do Joe Biden.
47 years of zero and I mean zero accomplishments. He's had 1 job his entire life.  What new and fresh ideas will Biden bring to the table??   Stock market will hit an all time high this week.  TRUMP
He is an absolute sellout; and Biden has zero dignity
So actively cutting social programs is better?   I’m not unfamiliar with Biden’s shortcomings dude   The problem is that you, and other Twitter-only leftists have yet to provide a viable alternative that results in something other than a Biden or Trump presidency.
Biden is absolutely screwed
He’d have to go on record as a D president, opposing a bill passed by the D house and senate.   And M4A won’t get passed until it’s viable   Does voting for Biden change my ability to oppose him 4 the next 4 years? If neither candidate supports M4A, I’m considering other factors
No, 3+ years apart.  However, Biden has been milking America for 47 years! Numb nuts...
Trump shouldn’t even be allowed to run. He’s. Heated the entire time staring w/Giuliani digging up dirt on Biden in Ukraine, to Kushner colluding with Kanye for a bogus ballot run and Trump slowing down the postal service. He’s a dirt bag and a cheat!
I have a bunch of examples of what Biden has done and said—none of them positive. I remember, even though he probably doesn’t. 😉
Exactly! Someone (political blue check) said a desperate candidate asks for more debates. Hoping Biden denies and he can attack him for it? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Remind me how many states Joe Biden carried in his first two presidential runs before becoming Vice President of the United States of America?
Biden has nothing to gain by debating Trump. Nothing at all. He's already in the lead. When someone asks for an additional debate (the Trump camp just did) it means they know their candidate is tanking. That said, Trump won't do any, let alone four.
"He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground." -  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I was sad for about 10 days after Warren dropped out of the race.   Then I dusted myself off and put on my big boy boots, because Trump is that bad.   If you need to be spoon fed reasons to vote for Biden-Harris, you're less reasonable than my toddler.
But Sanders endorses Biden. By that logic, he also isn’t a progresssive.
I wonder if this is like the World Cup where they print swag for all the top VP contenders? Or like the iPhone where Biden actually make his choice a while back and the printers were under NDA?
Yeah the OP wasn’t disputing that.  The point is that Biden was handsy with women and that made Reade more plausible.  Morse has no comparable, visible record of misconduct.  There is a really obvious difference there
While stricter gun control measures have at times been a major part of Harris’ campaign platforms, the issue was barely raised at Wednesday's press conference.
I was genuinely impressed by Biden and Harris modeling social distancing at this event. I know it’s a formality, but that’s the point. Leaders *should* model proper public health behavior. It matters!  I also love that they’re selling Biden/Harris masks.
Exactly. I plan to vote for Biden and bitch about him for the next 4 years, ideally he gets primaried but idk if it’s likely   Politicians listen to the people that vote for them, above all else (except money but that’s a different convo)
Anyone watching Biden/Harris must be able contrast the divisiveness of Trump. For the first time in 4 years I watched LEADERS who were kind, strong, positive- oh man, what a joy!!!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
How do you top the words of Biden and Harris which sounded like a beautiful symphony in contrast.
Milli Vanilli would be an appropriate analogy for Biden and Harris. 100% fake and full of poo.
Everybody but Ben Carson will vote for Biden/Harris.
The fact that Biden chose KH is still not enough to persuade this perennial republican to vote for someone who says the spawn of Hitler are "some good people" or that he wishes well to the pimp of a pedophile.  For the record, no, the spawn of Hitler have NO good people!
Hawkins/Walker. Only real choice. We must talk both past and present. Neither Trump/Pence nor Biden/Harris will address the pressing issues this nation faces. We must vote our values. #VoteGreen2020 #RideTheGreenWave
Biden and Harris make debut as running mates, vowing to defeat Trump  Try to keep your pants on Joe, your chance is coming.
Not sure who Biden is talking to. Certainly no one with an attention span longer than that of a gnat.
Democrats never do things straight forward or above board.  My belief is that they plan to get Biden elected and then, within 6 months remove him as incompetent, thus elevating Harris to POTUS.  Barring election fraud, it would all be done Constitutionally.  But it would be done.
$30 million in a single day from individual donors is an incredible feat for Biden and Harris.
But did not mention H1N1 which arguably killed more people than Covid.  Probably because the Obama/Biden response to that epidemic was nonexistent.
But avoided altogether a comparison to H1N1. Probably because doing so would show how Obama/Biden did precisely NOTHING to counter that epidemic.
Wouldn't surprise me if they try and charge Biden or Obama with some bullshit. Trump is a wannabe autocrat.
But they will scrupulously avoid mention of the Obama/Biden response to H1N1.  Which, BTW, was precisely NOTHING.
Just watched Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak as a ticket. This is the first time I’ve been excited and energized by a VP pick! #KamalaHarris #BidenHarris2020
Just in case you forgot Joe Biden will be 78 in November.
This is the one positive. If Biden makes Harris head of his pandemic task force, it will be in the hands of someone that is extremely competent. Though the jury is still out on the states with Republican leaders ... I doubt they will be on board w any Dem plan
And notice, Harris mentioned Ebola, but NOT the H1N1 epidemic. That, of course, is because H1N1 arguably killed more people (under Obama/Biden) than Covid has.  I'm in no way minimizing or dismissing the seriousness of Covid. I'm simply trying to inject some reality into things.
“And like everything else he’s inherited, he’s run ot in the ground.” (the economy from Obama/Biden) the NEXT VP of the United States,
that would be great, i hope they do.  Biden’s current plan doesn’t even restore the tax rate to the (low) level it was at under Obama
Love this Beau Biden connection. And Joe and Kamala Harris bringing it up. And the specifics of their relationship. Makes me teary. It's SO good for parents to hear other people talk about their kids, no matter what age. Love that she did that. #BidenHarris2020
Sure that could happen...but why doesn't Biden win MS then, not to mention NC.  (Or OH for that matter.)
I mean that's fair but it's a bit of a strawman in Tucker's case. He went on an irrational rant about how it means she can't be criticized. It's not a big deal he mispronounced it. It is a big deal he didn't respect her enough to look it up or care he did. Biden clearly did.
What a delight to think of all the highly competent people who could be part of the Biden administration
Okay, sure Trump could win NH...but how does Biden win LA at the same time...while not winning MS...but winning GA...and not winning NC???
Biden doing a great job of singing Kamala’s praises as he introduces her now on CNN...
Biden says Kamala has our back, now it’s time to have hers...such a loaded statement.  I’m trying to be good today...I promise 😇
STARTING NOW: Biden and Harris give their first joint remarks as running mates. Watch live:
Remember when Biden introduced Obama as "Barack America" in 2008 when Biden was selected as VP?
Even  discredited this idea that Biden is pro-defunding when Chris Wallace interviewed Trump. Come on, NCGOP. Your arguments are in bad faith at this point.
Any minute now, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will appear in Wilmington, Delaware, at their first event together. Don't miss their show-stopping opening duet on "Ain't No Mountain High Enough." It's sure to be amazeballs.
I like the way you think. But I also think Biden can win Montana and Alaska, so I may be a touch too exuberant.
I agree 100% with your point, but I don't get how it's related to Republicans trying to get Kanye to pull votes away from Biden.
His lead in North Carolina is probably about 2-4 points. And Biden got 50% in this poll, which is noteworthy in itself.
gahhhh... i want to watch this Biden Harris unity rally  with people who are fired up!   Stinks to have to socially distance
Joe Biden could not pick his own NOSE
May vote biden/harris to epically troll internet leftists and alt right at the same time
Wow Biden, you hit 3 with one stone. Great advertising, this will fool them. No, really.
It’s a surprisingly appealing pitch, and I think the Biden team knows it.
Update: Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris will speak at 4:30 p.m. ET.
Yep, I’m either doing that or just a write in.  I’m not voting for someone who has Dementia and is in bed with the Wall Street Executives &amp; CEO’s (Joe Biden) &amp; a Fake black woman who came from a Jamaican family that were Slave Owners &amp; takes money from the Trump Family (Harris).
WATCH: Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that California Sen. Kamala Harris would be his vice presidential running mate. They are giving remarks together at 3:50 p.m. ET.   📺 Watch live here:
(fwiw, I think if we play this election right Biden and Harris, to say nothing of Pelosi and Schumer, will have a caucus of Dems in Congress that is markedly to the left of the administration and will push them aggressively on policy. But that's my last shred of optimism talking)
C'mon man... Biden is still trying to decide, green or red jello.
I love this take.  Get Trump out of office but push Biden/Harris to get on board with policies you care about !!!
Biden/Harris still well ahead of you, Corona baby.
Lol 😂 joe Biden and Harris love locking up black folk... but they are the more logical pick for me
We need YOUR help getting the word out! Let's get everyone in NC *United For Biden/Harris* to win in November!  #NCForJoe #TeamRespectNoMalarkey 6/6
Biden &amp; Harris are not progressive enough. They have both done awful things. I’m disappointed that Biden is the Democratic Party candidate and that Harris is his chosen VP.   But I am still voting for them. And I think you should too.
I'm sure you were trying to look like Biden...right?
omg thought it was Biden lol
My point is that she has multiple allegiances and her loyalties aren’t necessarily to blacks especially black Americans. She &amp; those behind her play up the “black woman” thing when it’s convenient. She adds nothing to the Biden ticket imo. Her presidential campaign was a failure
Any % of voters voting for Kanye is detrimental to Biden and helpful for Trump. If you don’t get that, idk what to tell you.
So what? The dispute is not that the prosecutor was corrupt; the point is that Biden was on the take, so he pushed the firing for his own personal ulterior motives
I need news stories about woke police unions backing Biden/Harris
Biden Harris 2020 let's get it done!
Voting for Joe Biden only feels like the only option if the arc of your political participation begins and ends with the electoral process
So what I'm seeing is this: Socialists hate Biden because they think he's a Republican, and Republicans hate him because they think he's a socialist.
Republican attack ads here are doing all they can to associate Biden with AOC and other progressives in an attempt to scare voters, because they know it has a chance.
I think Biden and Harris have a chance to get as much done as a more progressive team, due to having a lower fear level than a truly progressive team.
And the supposed extent to which a candidate is Jewish is no way the determinative factor for me in this election. "Trump or Biden? Hard to say so I'll just go with the one the Jewish establishment can convince me is most Jewish!"
I do get asked about candidates' faith. Here's something I found.  5 faith facts about Biden’s veep pick, Kamala Harris — a Baptist with Hindu family, via
Meanwhile the GOP has moved further into total unreality and gaslighting at the behest of a buffoonish would-be fascist. Maybe the mainstream democratic part has moved very far left (doubtful given that Biden won the primary), but the GOP has shown that they believe in nothing.
I mean, yeah I’ll vote for Biden but I’m gonna angry cry while I do it
Just call them female Biden supporters. 😌
Who am I kidding? All the people mad at me for not being excited about a Biden/Harris ticket will likely cease all political engagement until around this time in 2024
If you hate the system, GOOD.  We can’t change the system without a voice in the system.  Unless you’re happy with Trump as your voice, you have to vote and you have to vote for Biden.   Do I like it? No! But is it what we’re faced with? Yes.
There’s no statement to be made with a protest vote if the person in office won’t even acknowledge the protest.  If he wins Trump will set us back YEARS.   If you vote for anyone but Biden Trump will win.   Period.  It is the harsh truth of our broken system.
Righties saying Kamala called Biden a racist when she explicitly said he isn’t when asked, pointedly, after the relevant primary debate by a reporter last year is relevant.    They’re going to use “woke” as a proxy for exoticizing her and sadly it will work with some anti-wokies.
Seeing a lot of Biden/Harris hate on my TL.  And I get it, I do.  But there is no world in which they are comparable to another 4 years of Trump/Pence.  In order to progress in any way Trump has to be voted out this election cycle.  Period. End of discussion.
I can't wait to see y'all try to push Biden left
I should donate to get a chance to speak to both Biden and Harris, so that way, if I am picked, I can just tell them to “Fuck Off” and “Fuck You Both for using us and being in bed with the Wall Street Corporatists.“  And also thank Harris for taking money from the Trump Family.😉
Joe Biden just did.
Trying to say  should be in Biden's cabinet, now that she didn't get the VP nod, where you can't push progressive policies like she can in the senate is honestly kind of a slap in the face. She deserves better and her expertise cannot be confined to one area.
I’m mostly just looking forward to her making those lefties’ heads explode tbh. Lol  kAmAlA iS a CoP   Between that and “Biden is Antifa” the opposition to the ticket is running very thin and is poorly thought out.
Maybe vote Green &amp; just say you rode the Biden bus.
I'm going to be on edge the probability of Biden being elected is 100%, which will not occur until the votes are tallied and the election results certified.  Until then, we need to encourage people to vote like their lives depend on it.
White people saying Hillary lost because we talked shit about her &amp; that we shouldn't be critical of Biden and Harris while voting for them. Politicians need to be held accountable. Even when campaigning they have to serve us, because we are giving time &amp; money to help them win.
A lot of justifiable anger out there as well, especially around prison/police abolition and Kamala's history with it. But I would argue there's more room for holding the Biden/Harris admin accountable on progressive demands than a Trump admin with an even worse track record
rich celebrities are so quick to support biden and kamala because they will always be protected by society, regardless of what's going on in the world.   they won’t have to deal with our struggles in the same way.
Its just tiring "we have to vote Biden in so we can get real change later"  No one sees we are actually going backward, nothings getting fixed, but the rich are getting richer, black and brown people are imprisoned more, climate is deteriorating.  What is it gonna take?
Cool imma vote for Biden
The person you replied to didn't say all boomers like him though. Anyway, moving on. Need to focus our efforts on electing Biden. 👍
What was going on in the head of the consultants that thought Kamala would get Biden even one more vote in a swing state than he already had.  Is there something I'm missing?
But I’m sure this won’t be the end of that right wing ad about how Biden’s America will be scary and cop-less showing up on my tv bc Joe Biden is so ~radical~
Biden +2 and DePasquale +2 in #PA10
Also true. The public wanted something done about crack. The original CBC bill accomplished that without centering incarceration. That’s not what Joe Biden and the Clintons sold to the people
Bernie is all in for Biden/Harris.  Let's take a page from his book and unite to take our country back and govern with compassion and humanity.
👆👆👆 And allies that Biden and Kamala would consider "anarchists"  They would just do it "legally" and eith the backing of neoliberals
We've lived for four years under a man who can never be criticized. If the only people who can serve in Biden's White House are people who have nothing negative to say about it, we're in for four more.
The other thing I'm super sick of is the hot take that Harris has recently criticized Biden on the debate stage and therefore she should have rejected the VP pick. Why? Criticism is good. I hope she keeps criticizing him all the way to the Oval and in it.
Imagine telling politically engaged, complex, sophisticated, intelligent people who are struggling with a myriad of problems that Biden/Kampala are the "most progressive" ticket in US history.  Its shameful and embarrasing.  We have cspan and records. Its a bold faced lie.
I be seeing y’all tweets and be like:  Yeah there’s no way they have read up anything on Biden fr lol guys when I do ya research, ian telling you to hack the NSA. Im telling you to go the man campaign website😂 its allll there🤯 crazy right.
If you email me or message me and your "climate focused strategy" is to canvas and vote for Biden/Kamala.  Please dont talk to me and leave me alone. Thanks.
The CBC knew the Biden bill was bad, and offered their own version of the bill that focused on drug treatment, mental health, community interventions, demilitarization of the local police, and racial justice. White Congresspeople and bitch ass Lacy Clay stripped it of everything.

This is where we diverge. I do not believe I owe the Democratic Party my loyalty. I will vote, bc voting is important to me; but I am not sure I will vote for a major party candidate. And if I do not vote for Joe Biden and he loses, I will not be convinced that it is my fault.
I can’t wait for y’all to say “c’mon man, there was crack everywhere” in defense of Biden bankruptcy bill.
Joe Biden's Awful Vice Presidential Pick
Biden is a practicing catholic. Why do you spew lies to stoke hatred and divisiveness?
Apropos of future Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Cory Booker, I was interviewing Barney Frank for something recently and he said that, if Biden wins, Biden should put Mike Bloomberg in charge of HUD.
Telling Progressives that they should be happy while voting for Biden and Kamala is like telling women they would look prettier if they smiled more.
Same. Exactly. I was excited to vote trump out but now I’m also excited to vote for Biden and Harris. I can’t wait.
Electrifying!
I like this too. Biden is actually tilting his head down. Body language tells me SO much about someone.
#Fact Check:  🗳While #Biden and #Harris may not have been your first choices, at least they know the “1917” pandemic didn’t end WWII  🗳The 1918 pandemic caused tens of millions of deaths worldwide in 1918 and 1919, not 1945  🗳It did sicken soldiers during the final year of WWI
Biden and Kalama are bad for Black people when it comes to crime.  But Tony The Tiger has been bad for Black folk economically
LOL she's a self-declared "Top Cop" of California. How will THAT play out? She also said she believed Joe's accuser! OK so the Top Cop believes Biden is guilty of sexual harassment!! but now you pander to the left, hilarious
i just had a class of 3rd graders shit on Trump so hard lmao they dont fw biden either tho
“Harris might also be a good policy influence on Biden if he treats her as a real governing partner, as he hopefully will. Here are three reasons why.” #progressives #KamalaHarris
Y'all are really ready to fall for the jig.  Black people are still suffering. Having a black VP won't change that. We celebrated Obama like Jesus was here and did he save us?  Is there doubt in ANYBODY'S mind we will continue to suffer under Biden/Harris?  Wolf in sheepskin.
Glad I didn't have to see Biden at the dentist, tho.
"Make no mistake: Putting a qualified person of color like Harris — whose parents are Jamaican and Indian immigrants — on the ticket is a statement against President Trump."  Takeaways from Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris from
I dont wanna sound flippant but yea.  Community is your best defense. And cant fight if your hungry. So priorities.  "Under no pretext"  Its why Biden/Kamala scare me. They are perfect for instituting a disarmament of the working class while upgrading the militarization of cops.
a voter rights org put together by basketballer  may have an important impact in this crucial election. We need this. All hands on deck! #Vote2020 #Biden #KamalaHarris2020
We’ve heard your racist misogynistic attacks before. BORING. Biden/Harris. We have your backs.
🌊 twitter:   "In this essay I will show how Biden and Kamala will take the exact opposite policy position they have historically taken and are actually more progressive than MLK, Stalin, Bush Jr. Climate change will be so afraid it will stop on its own. Vote and donate!"
Neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris were inevitable selections. They were chosen, and different choices could have been made.
No question about it, As a suburban housewife I would climb mountains to vote for Biden and Harris!  #BidenHarris2020
GOPmay not be willing to do anything about trumps racism, misogyny dog whistles, but women of color, white women, suburban women, will do something about it on Nov. 3rd.  We have Biden/Harris ticket backs that’s for sure.
Kamala Harris is a f**king warrior, and that’s what Joe Biden needs right now. She will also make an excellent POTUS, whenever that time comes.   All the rest is noise.   #BidenHarris2020
Way too close for comfort.  We still have plenty of work to do.  Let’s get on it.  I just donated to the Biden-Harris campaign.
do Postal workers vote for Biden given  intentional actions to harm USPS and the wonderful people that work so hard for our country?
I think the pro is she energizes some of the DNC progressives that were disappointed in Biden.   I think the con is she doesn’t inspire independents or nevertrumpers.
How is Biden trying to manipulate you? This just seems like catastrophising.
If this was your original tweet (which doesn’t include using Warren statements as an excuse to not vote for Biden) I wouldn’t have taken any issue with it.  You don’t owe anyone your vote.
I’m talking about Biden and Warren.
Saying Biden is saying something when he isn’t and getting frustrated about it is silly.   The SJW part is about how you mentioned his statement as if he didn’t publically apologize for it.
you fool. vote for Biden/Harris or you're voting for cheeto.
You can run through the same hypocrisy on the new right. Nothing about Trump’s spending says “fiscal responsibility.”   But I digress. My point is this prediction and Dems who had a primary choice other than Biden prophesying that X candidate would have crushed Trump is...wild.
Warren isn’t on the ticket, and Biden isn’t saying that.
What kills me about this is: 1) He either doesn’t remember that Biden was the “Catholic on the ticket” in 08 and 12, or is asserting that he’s not a catholic because of his abortion stance.  2)I wonder if he counts Pence as a Catholic because he grew up catholic before converting
Congratulations on being selected as Joe Biden’s VP.  #Bigsupporter #excitment #infectioussmile #ruleoflaw #beconofhope
Endorsement of Biden-Harris from Governor Roy Cooper of the great state of North Carolina. 🙏 🇺🇸
Let me just say to all the people that are hating the idea of Biden/Harris. The alternative will destroy America. The SC is going to lose RBG and I hope she can hang on until Nov. Do your protest voting or nonvoting in 2024 after we get rid of the sociopath in the WH.
This isn’t even “Chomsky on Biden,” it’s Chomsky on the difference between voting and doing the work, and how people gotta be prepared to do both.
You said “choosing not to vote for a candidate that doesn’t align with ideals”  Your options are literally Biden, Trump, or not voting
It is unreal to me how people are talking about not voting for Biden because of Harris. Unclench your privileged ass.
In answer 2 latest Trump stupidity (he said Americans will have 2 learn Chinese if Biden is elected) I am ready 4 that, Donald, I have taken 2 years of #Mandarin
“Biden may also face an outgoing administration that hinders his efforts, whether because of incompetence or malign intent. Planning, coordination, and information-sharing across government agencies and functions is vital to a successful transition.”
If you’re on this app referring to Biden and Harris as “flawed candidates,” you should refrain from ever talking about politics ever again. Vote for your cops, and leave the rest of us alone.
You mean the base that got wiped out by Joe Biden? Not much of a base.
I voted for her, but if Biden/Harris win, Warren could become Secretary of Education or part of their cabinet in another way. It may not be over for her just yet.
Today's rule: every person who yaps about how Joe Biden is "building a bridge" should go watch "The Bridge on the River Kwai" to see how well the bridge building thing worked out for Alec Guinness. "Madness! Madness!" (Actually, just call quits on today &amp; watch a great film.)
#Bunkerboy is just predicting his biglee loss to the Biden Harris ticket
I hope I'm wrong. I hope the election happens relatively unimpeded and violence free. I hope Trump loses. I hope people snap out of the brainwashing. I hope biden/harris is the most "progressive" admin and takes real meaningful physical actions on racial, social, climate justice.
Trump’s failure to contain COVID has absolutely cratered the economy. Not talking about numbers on Wall Street. Talking about people’s lives, and jobs!  Voting for Biden, and Harris.
I mean is he supposed to openly disparage the nominee and vp pick because he lost? Or is he smart and understands that it will be far easier to get movement on his agenda under Biden/Harris than Trump/Pence? Idk what this tweet changes?
Biden could have picked Donald trump jr as his running mate and I’d still have to vote for him, why does anyone care who it is
Biden/Harris voters in swing states without much experience with mail-in voting - Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina &amp; Florida - should shun mail-in voting &amp; vote early, in person.  I’m in.  I’ll take the risk. Others risked far more to make sure their vote counts.
I know people who post pics of their ( rightfully) jailed cousins who can't stand Kamala. Biden ain't getting that vote 😂😂😂😂
It goes so far out of bounds. He is supposed to be apolitical. Talk about bias. He needs to resign. He needs to be held accountable even after Biden wins.
Biden struggles with green or red jello.  He didn't pick Harris.
Well best of luck in the election then. I hope Biden and his disaster of a pick will make you proud 🤣🤣🤣  You don’t look long for this world, however. So perhaps whether Trump wins or not (he’s going to win in a landslide), you won’t have to endure him.
If Biden is elected, they'll take credit for anything in the pipeline that will stem it.  If Trump is re-elected, they'll pillory him for having those same things in the pipeline and not on the market.
Well, why don’t you ask the President of Ukraine? He just named Biden as an accused party in a crime yesterday. 😃
Crucial thread. Look we have to vote Biden/Harris- but we also have to know exactly who we’re electing. Harris is pro-police, pro-war, pro-corporation &amp; has voted to further oppression of BIPOC Americans COUNTLESS times. Ethnicity &amp; gender do not a hero make.
Many “Christians” don’t think we Catholics are Christian.  Not all Catholics are Christians, but not all Christians are Christians either.  Living your faith is a choice-they shall know him by his fruits-Biden is a Catholic in name only.
So, to translate it out of CNN-speak...  Kammy will assume the office of president as soon as the DNC declares Biden unfit and  removes him. I conservatively estimate within 5-6 months.  Assuming, of course, that the American electorate is stump dumb stupid enough to elect them.
Legally, I don't know of a stipulation absolutely requiring a VP.  If I am correct, it would have been tactically better for Pelosi had Biden run without a VP.  Because in that case, should anything happen to Biden, Pelosi would, as Speaker, succeed to the Oval Office.
Me, now until Nov. 3: Biden/Harris 2020! Get on the bus! Me, for the entire ensuing four years: we elected you, now do your job, according to your electorate, who elected you. Imagine the damage the Trumpists could've done if they demanded real work out of their president
In the abstract, Biden and Harris are uncomfortably close to the center for my taste. But, pragmatically, my next president said "holy fucking shit don't drink bleach what is wrong with you people", and the next VP made little poop pellets come out of Barr and Kavanaugh
So, Biden was part of an administration that passed on prosecuting the previous administration for very clear crimes that could've stuck, at least for some. Heal and move on, I get it. But can a Biden/Harris ticket ignore the clear mandate that justice must be served?
So, what do you think is next For Elizabeth Warren?  You think she will have a Prominent Position in the Biden Administration like, Secretary Of State, Secretary Of Treasury?  Or do you think she will stay in the Senate and then make a run for President in 2024?  #Warren2024
I love how excited Kamala Harris’s colleagues are about her selection as Joe Biden’s running mate. People who worked with her back in the day and people who work with her now have all said how great she is.   It’s nice to have candidates who just know how to work as a team.
Furthermore, Kamala Harris took money from Steve Mnuchin in 2016!  Kamala Harris for the people???? Riiiiiight, for the people My Ass. She only looks out for herself &amp; nobody else.  Fuck Kamala Harris, Screw Joe Biden, I'm Voting 3rd Party.  #Warren2024
Kamala Harris Accepted Donations From Donald Trump And Ivanka Trump, you honestly think she will do anything to him? No, she will let Donald Trump &amp; his Criminal Enterprise Walk!  As far as I'm concerned, Both Harris &amp; Biden can go to hell.  #Warren2024
If you do get a cabinet spot, do you think Biden will support any of your policies? I fear that it will be like Robert Reich in the Clinton administration. You would be better off running for mayor of NYC. Don't get burried by this establishment administration.
You said on your podcast that you expected to have a spot in Biden's cabinet. Do you still believe that after this? I fear they're just using you for your supporters and you'll never hear from them again after the election. They're engrained in the institution you are fighting.
Independent voters who don’t like Joe Biden’s VP choice in Kamala Harris and are threatening not to vote for him now are essentially guaranteeing another 4 more years of the worst president in US history! C’mon! We have to stick together and see this through! #BidenHarris2020
I much rather prefer #HeelsUpHarris, with no mention of Biden. He’s as lost from this ticket as are his marbles. 🤣🤣
At the end of the day, it’s whether you want Trump back or not. I hate to over simplify it but🤷🏽‍♂️ ur options:   Vote for Trump.....  No vote (which) = Trump vote  Kanye vote (which) = Trump vote   Vote for Biden
I willlllllll...NOT be voting for the Biden/#HeelsUpHarris ticket!   #Trump2020 #KAG2020 #TrumpTrain
you really are terrified right now aren't you ? yeah all the progressives in the Dem party are not happy with the pick right now but most will suck it up and vote for the Biden\Harris ticket. But you say she is radical and too far left. Sure that makes sense. Go with that. LOL
🐷 FUCK KAMALA 🐷   IF BIDEN DIES, BERNIE IS THE PRESIDENT
Biden is a sellout. Kamala is a phony
Keep this in mind before your rush off to vote for the Segregationist/Cop (Biden/Harris)  ticket, folks! 😃👍🏼 #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
It really does say that Biden has great BRAINS !!!
Did Biden ever say, "grab em by their p...y?" And excuse it as "locker room talk?". Did Biden ever have to pay off a porn star?  How many of Biden's cronies are in jail?
Waiting for his “Biden/Harris” fundraising email
That 17 year old who hacked Joe Biden’s account for a Bitcoin scam should have announced his Vice President instead. Huge missed opportunity
Val Demings would have been a Tim Kaine like choice for Biden, imo.   VPs gotta compliment the Pres.  Pence was the straight man and got religious cons.  Biden added experience and foreign policy.  Don't see what Demings would add b/c she is so similar to Biden in many ways.
why couldn't we have this race instead of the lame one we're stuck with?  Also we should run Hunter Biden on the Green Party so it's a 3 way brawl
The party ideologically is closer to Bernie (single payer gets 60% in primary exit polls) but loves the Obama years and they really want to beat Trump.   I expect the Sanders wing to go all out in '24, assuming Biden does not run again.
This reads like a Biden interview
Right? Biden was pro-choice on his previous two Dem tix/wins. Tim Kaine's pro-choice. Same with John Kerry. By this pedo-protecting bishop's standards, the numbnutz should be pouting that there's never been a single Roman Catholic candidate on either party's ticket.
Predicable: WaPo was going to say this about whatever running mate Biden chose.
i don’t wanna see any of y’all not showing up to the polls because you don’t like biden or harris because you know damn well trump supporters will be showing up and voting for his stupid ass
The LOL of the day today comes from a  fundraising email about the Biden/Harris ticket. "These two liberals are as far-left as they come." 😂🤣😂🤣😂
I’m backing Biden and Harris 2020.
Biden leads Trump in Georgia, a state that Democrats haven't won in a presidential race since 1992
Ppl who think we gotta support biden/kamala because there is a white supremacist in the white house have a fundamental misunderstanding of what white supremacy is lol Trump is just loud. Biden's version and Kamala's adjacency have been/are/will be awful for millions of ppl.
And more good news for Biden and women voters today. Biden has an amazing 31% lead over Trump among women nationally in Monmouth poll (pre-Harris announcement).
I don’t think anyone in the market will vote for Biden if today was any indication of what his presidency will look like. 😂😂 $spy $qqq
Was I confident that Biden could win Texas? Not really.  Am I confident that #BidenHarris2020 can win Texas? Hell, yes.
Joe Biden being president likely won’t enact sweeping changes.  The thing is, it’s either him or Trump at this point. And no matter how little Biden may or may not do, Trump is going to be worse. Guaranteed.
Derp!  Here’s where you can donate to the Biden-Harris campaign, everybody.
Could you imagine what 45 would say about and do to a person (i.e. a black woman) who harshly challenged him on the debate stage? I’ll tell y’all one thing - he sure as hell isnt picking that person as his VP. Say what you will, but this says a lot about Biden’s character.
Joe Biden ran two campaigns before even winning a primary.
Ready to vote now for Biden/Harris. Hurry up November 3rd!
Ah yes, something well within his purview. Biden is truly a different political animal than.... John Kerry?
I guess you have this because Biden’s info is available while Trump’s is secret. Shame on you.
The Biden-Harris ticket &amp; new Congress (with a record number of progressive BIPOC/women as Democratic candidates) can together enact a progressive agenda. Progressives need to hold the Biden administration accountable but there's a lot to be optimistic about! #BidenHarris2020
Where you alive during the Obama Administration? Which Biden was VP of? When do you think the BLM movent started.
lmao if they think Biden and Harris are far-left
I think it’s great that Biden picked a woman, and intentionally so.  Kamala Harris is one of several woman qualified to be President.  It’s good to have more women at the decision-making table.
I have very little hope that a Biden/Harris administration will do much to help the poor or move us forward in ways we desperately need. But I feel reasonably sure they won't actively kill people, so....🤷‍♀️
I’m glad it’s a black woman. I don’t agree with much Kamala and Biden have to say. I will still do everything to get them elected. I’ve spent hours trying to decide what my reaction is and I think it’s just numbness, but there’s work to be done.
Biden already has one more person than trump does that'll call him on his bullshit and he's only filled one position.
Radical left Radical left Radical left Does this crap resonate with rubes?  Joe Biden...radical😂😂😂
Trump is a literal white supremacist so yeah I’m far from enthused but will vote for Biden and Harris
Is Biden not Catholic? Am I making this up?
Kamala got the Republicans out here accidentally campaigning for Biden.
When this game started, Joe Biden had not yet announced Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate. #CBJVsTB
I mean, black women. That’s it! That’s who will step up &amp; Biden knows it.   The immature left still has to learn to do the hard work of politics. Compromising. Coalition-building. Service.   Not sure they’ll ever get there.
I guess he should've cared what Biden said.
biden is really trolling the ACAB crowd with this one, real king shit
Black Women Have Been Waiting for Kamala Harris Far Too Long
If Trump had shown just a little bit of restraint and a little more support for moderate reforms in May and June, he could easily outflank Biden on criminal justice  But because he went so hardline you can be tough on crime and still look like the progressive next to him
Radical left!😂😂😂 You tried it with Obama You tried it with Hillary You even tried it with Biden! Your playbook is as old and moldy as your constituents!
Especially since Biden is Antifa and wants to defund the police. 😂  They clearly don’t think more than one step ahead.
My thought was “I’ll probably grit my teeth and vote Biden as long as it isn’t Kamala.”  Now I don’t know (but definitely won’t be Trump)
Also Tim Kaine has more or less the same views as Biden on the obvious hot-button issues Tobin is thinking of, why does he count?
The Biden campaign equates socialists and plutocrats fo gods sake
If you think voting for a cop, old white segregationist who has been on the wrong side of history at every opportunity, and a Wall St approved cabinet is "fighting" American fascism...  Will you be surprised when the protests continue and Biden/Kampala clamp down harder than T?
This strategy is gonna backfire. Painting Biden and Harris as "radical left" is just gonna help turn out the far-left Democrats.
Great headline.
Biden-Harris👍for me. + AG Adam Schiff to BRING THE PAIN after 3+ years to 45 and  who are tied sloppy close with a “cord of steel”. The real Super Bowl is probs not happening. THIS is the righteous Super Bowl of our era. See ya in court, then prison,
#Biden well past his #sellbydate  The guy is decepid
I have read it. Biden has been bad on mass incarceration.  But your contention above? It's just opportunistic inanity, the recency bias in full effect.
Imagine: it’s March 2021. The Biden Justice Department has been *actually* investigating foreign bribery issues: the Trump Campaign, the Trump Org, government officials who blatantly defied the law for the last four years. Indictments are rumored.   Who gets indicted first?
PBS did a great synopsis of #KamalaHarris’s career. Biden and Harris are already leading by example.  ♥️✌🏽
Biden did! 😁
y’all really think Biden gonna win? 🌚
Joe Biden only picked Kamala so he can get all the black votes... we were gonna vote for him anyways cause we don’t have a choice
The nicest thing I can say about today’s news?  Biden/Harris 2020 At Least It Isn’t Klobuchar or Buttigieg
Boy, he got that right! Biden-Harris: the clear choice!
Just know I see you. Getting your Biden &amp; Kamala jokes off while Trump racks up 150k+ Covid deaths. When mass homelessness is around the corner, corporations racking up benefits while families starve.   And this is just the past 4 months.   But please, get your jokes off.
Absolutely...there’s no way out for him, Biden, Wray, Comey, etc...
So the author of the crime bill will be running for President with a cop as his running mate...  You can’t make this shit up.   The Democrats will never learn.   #BidenHarris #Biden #KamalaHarrisForVP
My daughter (21) has said she doesn't want a Biden sticker on our car. 🙄 Little does she know, I was just waiting for the #BidenHarris stickers to become available. Ordered one today. 🤣🤣🤣 (Yes, she's voting for them.)
Third, she’s qualified and competent for the position, and will be a good leader if Biden has to step down for something like a medical issue. Finally, it’s depressing that people continue to try and divide us, on the left and the right. What we need is unity, not division.
It pisses me off that people are saying “Kamala’s bad bc she’s a cop!” First of all, she was a prosecutor, and prosecuted people according to the laws in place. Secondly, nominating her damaged the Trump argument that Biden’s soft on crime and will let antifa destroy cities. 1/2
It’d be pretty sweet if Biden took office, appointed Anita Hill to the Supreme Court, and then resigned. I can dream
Bernie has decided that beating Trump is the priority despite Biden &amp; now cop Kamala Harris being the alternative. And because of this, so many of his supporters are understandably angree with him, as if he's abandoned the movement.
Dem establishment even threw the me too movement under the bus by picking someone that can rival Trump's misogyny. Joe Biden is such a terrible candidate, worse than Hilary Clinton.   All of this because they'd rather cater to their wealthy donors than actually change the world.
Biden is obviously anti-yo-semitic, too.
Biden/Harris 2020: Extraordinarily Nasty to Assholes  That might make for a pretty good t-shirtTell me exactly what you think Pelosi has the power to do? Everything humanly possible has already been done. It's time to stop whining and get out the vote and  contribute to the Biden campaign.
Apparently Biden Harris campaign only cares about the black vote! According to the ads they have done everything for the black people nothing for any other race
Did Biden type this?
Jews across America &amp; the world will be far less safe in a 2nd Trump term. I’ll take Biden-Harris &amp; the Constitution over your corrupt, criminal conduct &amp; shameless support for racism &amp; discrimination.
Joe Biden Asshole song  via
He is currently relevant in several countries for his employment at Burisma. Investigations are ongoing.  Former President Joe quid pro quoed is charged w/ high treason. Ukraine prosecutors played audio tapes that included convos between President of Ukraine and VP Biden.
From an Americanized Canadian in the middle of it all:  what you may not understand is the Pelosi, Biden, Harris all want the exact same thing Trump wants. They’re all in the same club and are acting out the same “plan”. It’s a lose-lose situation down here.
Is Biden also pledging his presidential salary? He's been in office 40 years.

You should learn to meaningfully follow up with tough questions for Trump before telling Biden /Harris what they should or should not do.

Now it’s time for you to finally do your current job and question Trump with sufficient toughness before you start telling Biden/Harris what time you think it is.

Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Ah yes, #Biden breaks down because he's old,  And #Kamala breaks down because she's craven.
Idk. The goal for me isn’t to get Trump out. It’s for progress. I don’t see Biden making progress. More like keeping the status quo
Biden’s biggest win in the black community is becoming VP of the first black president. Biden’s track record is terrible, I don’t see why I “have to” vote for somebody who doesn’t align with my values.

Biden knew 'damn well' about spying on Trump campaign: Rep Nunes  via
Biden and MSM didn't coordinate well on their reaction to this historic agreement.   They are going to have to work on their messaging if they are going to be the DEM/MSM team we expect from them   Social Media to Unite the Right
RE: Peace Deal  Establishment Dems are silent other than Biden who praised it and said he would continue with it if he wins.  Progressives are just screaming about Palestine, not realizing this deal will eventually give them what they want, which is statehood.  Really sad to see.
Most of the U.S. government’s 200 immigration detention centers are run by private contractors holding asylum seekers and other immigrants accused of administrative violations or awaiting deportation.
If that's the case, which it isn't. Why did Biden and the Democrats call Trump a racist and xenophobe when he stopped travel to and from China right after America got it's first case of Covid-19. But then said he didn't do it soon enough when they realized he was right.
Biden is vehemently against Medicare for All as well. We are in the exact same position.
I want to see someone in the press pool just go ham. Like  finally just loses it, walks up to the podium, rips out his mic &amp; clobbers him with it lol.   It could be the best #BidenHarris ad ever. "Biden/Harris 2020: Because we'll literally BEAT him at his own game." 🤣
Threats?
I still can’t believe people rather see the country go to hell than vote for Biden because you don’t get what you want this election what happen text time you don’t get what you want I guess you will still punish the country with your vote over and over again ..praying for unity
Good point , Biden has always demonstrated for 50 years he can be swayed and cave to pressure. #usefulidiotBiden
Dude Reggie! Biden is an exceptional racist lots of game tape on this one. And that’s not an all Presidents comment. You can find lots of reasons to not vote for Trump but to say one is because Biden is not racist means your not paying attention
We have 82 days to do everything we can to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, to restore integrity and leadership to our government, and to flip North Carolina and our country blue. Let's get to work!
For the love of GOD  don't put that idea into Biden's head. AOC is a talented orator, and the future of the party, but like if Biden or the heads of the DNC think they can give her less time, they WILL.
Timing seems Strange On the Peace Treaty between Israel &amp; UAE , right after Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris. We all know how much the UAE and Israel love Trump . Is this another way to have foreign powers interfere in our election? #ElectionFraud #cheattowin
China, Russia and all our enemies stand to gain "bigly" if Biden wins.    Hunter stands to gain the most, though
So I have another question, what if we vote for Biden, get him elected and then he start doing things similar to Trump? What we gone do then?
I'm not angry I just cuss a lot. This article sums it up better than I could.
Former Muslim: I Heard Joe Biden Promote Sharia Law, Quote Muhammad On Zoom Call
Joe Biden is either plagiarizing or lying
you have a Russian traitor running the DOJ! Straight racist just like Donald duck traitor Trump! I don't know if this country can survive until election day! I know 1 thing, if so Biden better INVESTIGATE every single move Trump made! Even bathroom visits!
If Biden is elected, Fracking is the least of our worries  Remaining a Nation will be the first hurdle
If Biden wins she is one Brain Cell away from the Presidency
They say Obrador took $ 4 million in Bribes,  Shoot!  Biden wouldn't even get out of bed for that

The person who called Biden a racist was always the right choice...
Sen. Harris Ticked Off Racial Unrest, Economic Collapse &amp; Pandemic:
Kinda a cool commercial for how funny and personable Biden is. Utilizing natural resources.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
Oh yeah, there's real enthusiasm for Biden/Harris. There's like 50 people there. Lmao 😆 😆 😆
IMO, they owe Biden the same airtime given the other candidate.
And you’re right, we can be more responsible. Elect Biden and Harris because the current racist and liar in chief ain’t working.
Biden don’t hold anything back,  he just hires his monika lawinkski as first in charge..  Biden learned a lot from the Clinton years .  What a creep
Biden/Harris for a sane government.
Yo  ... Hunter Biden is living rent-free in your poor, distraught brain! #BidenHarris2020
Not Biden's strength?? You mean he will look like a total fool because he has dementia!  All of you know this is true, you can't mask it buy saying it is not his "strength"!  What a freakin joke!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Joe Biden is not afraid of a team of rivals.
And yet this is from one of Brexits biggest masturbatory fanboys
We are going to realize very quickly during debate season how much more qualified Sen. Harris is to be the president than VP Biden.  It’s the presidential nomination version of “This could be us but you wanted another old rich white dude.”
So my question would be this. If somebody who intended on voting for trump didn’t vote, would that be a vote for Biden?
😂😂😂 It’s hilarious that you think Joe Biden can accomplish anything....
I’ve resigned myself that I will have to vote in person even though I’m immune compromised. I plan to mask up, use face shield, and gloves. I will look ridiculous, but I’ll be damned if I’m letting Turd Trump and dastard DeJoy keep me from voting Biden/Harris!!
Ya heard of Ebola...that didn’t stop Obama/Biden from keeping the UE down and pushing the economy up
Talk about what you've done! YOU still sit quietly on YOUR thumb, thus UR complacent, in trump's green-lighting Putin's offering &amp; payment of bounties for killing US military sons/daughters! There will be hell to pay once Biden &amp; Harris r in office...the thought has Putin scared!
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.....  Donald Trump and Mike Pence....  At this point I’d be comfortable voting for the White House head custodian 🥴
I see a lot of people say things like “Joe Biden crime bill worked”.....ummm no it didn’t. Let’s talk facts in this thread.
Joe Biden the zombie. Lol
Rose Twitter really isn't for anyone anymore they hate Biden and the Democratic party and any chance for chaos is what they root for.

It's now the Harris Biden ticket!!
I asked God tonight, prior to Biden Harris' first joint event, to make this country whole again...we were not the best in 2016, but we were better than this!  Lord please help us to find our better selves and embrace all Americans, regardless of colors, creed, or gender!...

Me, too! You’re not alone. Hope will do that to you. Biden/Harris 2020
I think her comments show lack of understanding America and our economy.I think she spends to much time supporting domestic terrorism.The Obama Biden team, worst in the history of the republic. If the liberal left hadn’t Weaponized the Chinese flu our economy would be great today
Biden is incompetent, can’t speak a clear thought, has gotten filthy rich as a politician, has been caught on camera groping women and children, has a son that is incompetent yet also getting rich because of his political connection to his dad
I think we saw it in action today when Dementia Joe Beijing Biden picked a running mate based on genitalia and race!! Affirmative Action is still alive and well, DemonRats are evil and immoral!!
I’m gonna be skipping up in that mf to cast my vote. People so caught up on Biden and Harris that they don’t realize it’s not just about getting Trump out, it’s also about getting all his terrible hires and appointed positions out as well.
Factually incorrect. Biden has been behind racist policies his entire 40 yrs in politics (zero accomplishments from him) Kamala literally prosecuted millions of black men. Do your research
The answer for the majority of people is to ignore the same stuff happening but make #GirlBoss edits of Kamala and Biden as they lock up protesters for 20 years
Either way I predict Biden will be the president tRump is losing bad
Yea because voting for Biden is going to change everything lmfao

It is interesting you state you "don't get high on hate".  So if I disagree with you I am getting high on hate?  This is simply delusional beyond all reason.  You expose who you are.  You are for Socialism/Communism as you support the Biden agenda. You embody hate.
I have to wonder how much of Biden's choice of running mate is because of her abilities  and not because of the pressure to choose a woman of color. Doesn't matter in this household though. We are all Trump all the time. #voteTrump2020
And we are ready to support the Biden Harris ticket! So excited to have a White House where compassion and dedication to the American people is of upmost importance #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
Biden gets this vote for me for now...but I am riding with whoever Yang and AOC likes
This is what is going to happen if Biden wins...AOC..Nina Turner Cori Bush ..all those progressive candidates that fuck with Bernie Sanders are going to press the fuck outta Biden...and if Biden dont play ball they tearing the Dems down in 2024
I can’t wait for Biden and Kamala to lose so y’all can get on here and blame black men for it   I ain’t even gonna be mad, imma just laugh lmao
That speech by Dementia Joe Beijing Biden was just shameful and most bullshit lies!! I can't believe he stood there and said the things he said!! He didn't act very presidential in my view! And then HeelsUp Harris did the same thing, even worse! Supporting BLM and street rioting!
Biden been in Washington for 50 years.  Name one thing he’s done except extorting money for the Ukraine and China?

Good job on  first appearance as Biden’s VP running mate. 👍
Tuned in at the end of Biden. Watched all of Kamala. I have, for the first time in 4 years, some joy. I loved she said “Trump”.  Not President.
I think if Biden and what's her name get elected we are.
It's time to put pressure on the polticans not just her , true I don't like her record but I don't like people ganging up on a Blackwoman, point blank she needs to make things right her and Biden, I'm going to hold them personally responsible
That's a good one , but one thing I'm do is I'm hold her and Biden accountable
I love Joe Biden, but I'm gagging to trim the back of his hair, lol.

Mann anything to get trump out of office we know both are racist I rather vote for Biden at least the mf know what he is talking about when it comes to being a president trump is a businessman that’s all for himself only rather have Biden then trump tbh

Joe Biden probably does support antifa though...to be fair
Well thank goodness Biden, who you endorsed, is a M4A warrior. Right?
That is a good plan not to let Biden talk
That is such total utter BS. Biden is probably the most devote church goer in politics. He has never tried to take guns or support any such legislation, limit them yes,put restrictions yes but never to take away. He supports the police.
Biden is sickening
Biden might’ve been racist 30 years ago but he isn’t today. Trump is racist TODAY with racist polices. The choice is so obvious. Biden/Harris or this👇
Seriously, did Biden even have a good pick option? Biden is a mindless idiot, what sort of pick was he? The Democrat party is a sad joke.
The worst decision ever!!!! And unfortunately it’s doing what they want it to do.... pull Votes away from Biden/ Harris !!!
All smoke and mirrors with Biden/Harris. Educate yourself American public. Really listen to their promises. Nothing is free. Our country will be in big trouble with Biden. He can’t even complete a thought  And he’s going to protect us?  I could go on and on.
But Biden can't do it. LMFAO!
My current election prediction as of Aug. 12th, 2020. Biden with 319 electoral votes, and Trump with 219 electoral votes. My prediction is based on the FiveThirtyEight election model.
Honestly bruh at this point he is not looking like a bad canidate, Biden doing way to much for me

Chris Wallace hit the nail on the head!
if you don't vote for Biden, he said you're not black. Also, according to him the black community isn't as diverse as the latino community.
lets vote for biden!

Joe Biden choosing Kamala Harris is better than Christmas #BidenHarris2020 #trumpisdumbasfuck
Y’all sucking dick if you think ima vote for Biden
Biden is who we deserve, but not who we need right now
I was wondering the same thing. Black women were going to vote for Biden regardless.
So you would rather have Biden/Harris and the rest of the Democrat (Socialist/Communist) party destroy our Republic as they have been planning for the past 60 years?
First of all, your vocabulary needs work Mike. Second, Harris is no role model. She put hundreds of thousands of black Americans in prison for very minor crimes or no crimes at all. She is the ancestor of slave owners. She accused Biden of rape, now she loves him. Surely you jest
If we are firing the liar the only people we will be firing is Biden and Harris.  Get used to it Princess,  we WILL re-elect POTUS and we WILL change congress to all RED.  We will NOT allow this country to go Socialist!
Biden said he will legalize weed , I say take that money and pay Reparations they have done something similar in Illinois,but as  a whole ,there fighting giving cash and it's about cash and I want land , so I can be left alone
This dickhead created a photo with my wife’s pic and Joe Biden. My wife is a Trump Patriot! Litter his page with Trump pics and memes!!😡
Comes from a family that owned slaves  Said Biden is responsible for raping women, but now supports him  Is that enough for you?
You think people are illerate or stupid? Thank you for googling something for everyone. There was more googling of MONOTHEISM after Biden’s practiced comment trying to backtrack his offensive description of black ppl.
She wont be able to save him. Its a smoke screen to get the votes that he wouldnt get. Looks good on paper, but Biden has to defend himself and thats the nail in the coffin.
We're back! New episode dropping between 2:30 and 3:00 this afternoon 😁 #KamalaHarris #BidenHarris2020 #JoeBiden #Biden #RidinWithBiden
Regardless of Kamala turning back on her takeaways from Biden... it’s still necessary. I don’t even care about all the rah rah because Trump has to leave. He must.
Southern voters reward people who pay they’re dues. Obama being the only exception. And he won SC by a smaller margin then Biden and H. Clinton.
TFW Trump has done more about prison reform and marijuana legalization (First Step Act, Farm Bill) than Kamala and Biden.
Yea, really feeling the friendship blossom, especially after the DNC Convention snub.   Can't tell me Biden doesn't have any leverage over who gets to speak there.
Of course Trump doesn’t understand why Biden picked Harris! Trump surrounds himself only with people who kiss his ass. He would never understand the selection of a powerful, competent woman who will have different experiences and opinions, and from whom he could sometimes LEARN!

She is not eligible to be President. She is an anchor baby. She cannot replace  Biden.
Even few of my social media friends who are conservative are so mad about her... it’s strange because they didn’t say anything about Biden to my face. Honestly, if they got mad then it’s absolutely total nightmare for them.   Not my problem.   We go forward together.
I’m not gonna lie. I’m definitely one of those people who are questioning Biden/Harris 😭😭😭😭 but I refuse to vote for trump so it’s really no choice, we fucked either way. Might as well be fucked w/ Biden. It’s still just bullshit to think about 🤣
Can't even think about a Biden Cabinet. Booker to Bernie. Wake up America.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris: The Most Pro-Abortion Ticket in American History
No, I wouldn’t expect him to have the decency to congratulate the new president.  He would feel belittled, embarrassed and humiliated standing behind Biden at inauguration.  More likely to have a Twitter kniption fit from Florida on Inauguration Day.
Biden reportedly mocked for using script to tap Kamala Harris as his running mate. Ohh the scandal. A piece of paper near the laptop. Where is the FBI? Where is the investigation?
And you said Biden has a racism problem ??
Biden/Harris is the anti-black male ticket!
Don’t know , I do know that the Dem voters didn’t like her and she was forced out of the race. I do know she was picked primarily cause she is black. I do know Biden is running, so nothing has changed.
Thank you for your voice of reason. Most people don't know that Biden and Harris have done more harm for Black Americans than many in recent history. They are directly responsible for putting hundreds of thousands of them in prison, many for very long sentences
"Running to replace a president who has celebrated incompetence and elevated incompetents, Mr. Biden needed to choose a running mate who respects public service and has served well. In Sen. Kamala Harris, he has found such a partner.  - Washington Post Editorial Board
Incorrect.  Biden will be her puppet. Therefore, yes she can. But it’s not like it’s just her decision, but she would have major influence especially if Dems win Congress.

Trump literally has nothing on Biden anymore as long as shit don’t improve lol
CNN reporter calls Biden's Harris pick 'big risk,' says American culture 'primed' to be racist and sexist    So let me get this straight- if you don’t vote for Biden then your a racist and/or a sexist...it’s so played out and old and tiring.
No Princess, but the truth hurts, dosnt it?   I suggest you go watch “Agenda”. It’s on Amazon Prime right now.  It will give you a whole new perspective on the Obama/Biden WH.
At pretty much every key political juncture in the last five years, Warren has made the wrong decision, and she has paid dearly for these mistakes. (For that reason alone, I'm glad she's not on the ticket with Biden – I've seen enough of her political skills.)   4/6

Wasn’t kamela Harris callin Biden a closet racist now they running mates the dems got this puppet runnin all different directions
This sums up Democratic voters who are “happy” about Kamala or just confident Biden can win in general   “WHAT!? He chose a literal pretzel? Oh my god! The progressiveness. The pure genius. We got this boys and girls! Trump is going down! REVOLUTION”
Biden picked a running mate That’s a gift to you.
America is extremely racist + sexist. That’s why I’m worried for this Biden campaign. 😓
Agreed...but realistically that’s what it is...give Biden a count by number puzzle to the side to look busy and keep from interrupting
Here's an inside look at the vetting process that led to Joe Biden picking Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Just remember, not voting Biden/Harris is a vote for Trump
Biden is the gift that keeps  She is a good debater, but nobody will be able to save old Joe.
Biden had no choice.  He knew his background and track record on burying black folks is documented.
Just threw $25 into the Biden/Harris ring. Felt good.
FTR : I was hoping that Biden would pick Susan Rice over Kamala Harris as his VP candidate due to Kamala's record as a prosecutor; HOWEVER, Kamala is his pick. That makes her my pick! I will rally around this sista and embrace her. LFG! #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
“Biden’s been in office for over four decades, so what’s the point of having him on the ballot anyway?”
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden’s history-making pick for vice president
I understand Biden and Harris might not be everyone’s favorite choice but Trump has to go.
Discipline and having the right number of political vets leading the way. Biden's team actually seems like a well oiled machine all with a common goal. Compared to Bernie's campaign where the major players all had their own agendas and Bernie winning wasn't on the top of the list
Biden and Harris huh? Sigh...i guess...
In 2011  kicked me out of a conversation for asking their guest, someone running for US Congress, if they would change their stance on nuclear energy. Literally, that’s all I did. Anyways, that’s how I feel about the Biden Kamala ticket.
To see all these white dudes shitting on #KamalaHarris...you are really disrespecting women of color and EVERYONE sees it #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris #Biden #JoeBiden #RidinWithBiden
If not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump, then by not voting for Trump I'm actually voting for Biden. Or is it that I'm voting twice by not voting for either?

When Biden picked Kamala, Trump pissed his Pence. #BidenHarris
Voting for Biden is going to hurt me to the core but it’s what we gotta do 😭💔 #JesusFixIt
President Trump wasted no time attacking Sen. Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate. But in 2014, he was donating to her political campaign.
my hope is that Biden picked Harris to balance out as there are a fair number of Sander's policies being adapted
Reasons why Kamala Harris is a shit VP pick:  1. California is a safe state for the dems.This was a lost opportunity at gaining an electoral advantage in a battle ground state.  2. While the black community is not a monolith, they already showed in the primary they backed Biden.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the same ticket? What’s the plan? To see how many black men that they can put in jail for non violent crimes over the course of 4 years?
I don’t care if you support Trump or Biden or whoever. Be mindful that not everything you see or read online is real.
Oh, I thought this was about Biden picking Harris...
Great News! She will be able to do very ,very well!      Go Biden &amp; Harris ,
November can’t come soon enough. Biden/Harris
And he still moves quicker than Biden and in the right direction!
honestly, i’m not sure. which is why i asked my initial question.  at the end of the day, i want niggas to vote for whoever is going to help then sleep at night. but i genuinely don’t know if i can vote for biden in good faith.
if joseph biden criticism triggers you, you should probably just hit unfollow. we don’t stan any politicians this way.
The more likely scenario is that Biden will step away from the ticket.

Senator Kamala Harris is a great choice by Vice President Biden for his running mate. She is an enthusiastic and inspiring public servant who fights for justice and equality. I am ready to work so that we can see this ticket succeed in November.
Just like how Biden isn't Senator Klobuchar, Senator Harris is also not Senator Klobuchar and that little bit of positivity might not seem like much to you, but it means a lot to me. Knowing she won't have power helps when times get hard.
I know!! I keep having to stop myself from (good) crying! I feel so proud of Biden’s choice; I was hoping he would choose Harris. She’s gonna make mincemeat of Pence! Can’t wait for debates!!!
So you're thinking Biden may accidentally fall off the platform at his possible inauguration?
Biden...that’s was a mistake 😕
kid’s were in cages under obama &amp; biden, joe biden literally said if you don’t vote for him you’re not black lmao (but also idk why ‘overtly’ matters cause racism &amp; sexism are still racism &amp; sexism).
Shortly after #JoeBiden announced Sen. #KamalaHarris would be his running mate in the 2020 presidential election, Twitter lit up with reactions from President Trump, former Pres. Obama, and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. &gt;&gt;&gt;
Black male leaders say Biden will lose election if he doesn't choose Black woman as VP  via
Oh I infinitely prefer her to Biden, which is even in leftist circles a hot take, but when it comes to voting &amp; policy I think she's better than a lot of people who ran.
why do you believe those things? cause biden said so? his track record &amp; words don’t ever seem to match up
Joe Biden prolly think he all that and a bag of chips...serving as the VP for the first black man, and if he wins...having the first black/female VP......yeah he prolly thinks he’s all that’s and a bag of chips.
I'm not excited about Biden but I rather have a boring guy who's competent who knows what he's doing than a failed reality host where everyday there's some bullshit happening in his administration
no different than if biden is elected. like nothing has changed &amp; like there is still a lot of work that needs to be done
Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to be his Vice President. She's a senator from California that I'm not a fan of. I also don't think she will help him win either.
Class act Biden.
This is gonna be a weird fucking election. I can easily vote for Biden &amp; Harris because we live in a system that forces us to make a shitty binary choice, but I get why people can't. That said Pence &amp; Trump actively encourage and reward police-brutality and they've got to go.
I honestly can't imagine what it must be like to be excited by a Biden/Harris ticket. That's not to say that there aren't neat aspects of such a ticket, such as representation (which is valid &amp; legitimately fucking matters), but Harris as the candidate... Yeesh, ya know?
joe biden can talk all he wants to now
am i not allowed to criticize joseph biden?
That's why we need progressives IN the Senate and the House. Because those policies are a lot harder to enact via fiat and because Progressives can watchdog the FUCK out of Harris &amp; Biden. But we need Republicans OUT. And there's only one way to do that in this fucked system.
I remember when I saw that Biden commercial that began by showing a bunch of footage of police brutality and the protests and then ended off by promising a bunch of shit that ain’t have nothing to do with any of that
You think?! I feel like it’s so ridiculous when they say “this will be Biden’s America” considering this is LITERALLY RIGHT NOW trumps America.
If Biden survives two years I would be amazed
my question is more so, why exactly? how is a biden presidency going to be any different than a trump presidency
Because Pence &amp; Trump ACTIVELY ENCOURAGE the murder of POC by cops. Harris &amp; Biden don't. They just don't. There is a culture in place, politically, that encourages police violence. To BEGIN to dismantle it we kick out Republicans.
So i will say this Kamala got 4 years to win niggas over cause Biden passing the sword to Mayor Pete
So apparently Biden picked Kamala as his VP  #Trump2020
That's actually very touching given Biden's own Job-like personal history.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden’s running mate    I predicted this!!
Looks like Kamala Harris as Biden’s VP pick is far more important and interesting news than whatever  could possibly lie about today.  #TrumpPreempted
What sold my family on Kamala Harris?  Her proposal to enact one of the largest middle class tax cuts in history.  I hope Biden adopts this platform
why do y’all want biden to win? honestly, what do y’all think a biden presidency is going to change?
true, but their breed never goes away. by then they'll likely learn how to dress up their racism and bad policies (while likely becoming somewhat more progressive themselves). mind you, I would not complain about Biden, Harris x2, AOC. somewhere in there M4A should be a reality.
Biden/Harris 2020! So excited for this!
Sooo... how do y’all feel about Biden’s running mate?
By voting for Biden &amp; Harris I am in fact voting against change. I know that sucks, but Trump HAS changed shit by making everything WORSE and I am voting against that. If you poison &amp; break things you change them &amp; after 4 years of that shit I'm very decidedly against it.
Lmaoo the one time I manifest some shit it’s Kamala Harris being Joe Biden’s VP off a dumbass joke
We won’t be watching this but will watch Biden’s VP!!
biden and harris... thats a no for me
I think Biden looked for the one that aligned with his beliefs
If you ever feel bad about the state of the Biden/Harris ticket just go onto right-wing Twitter and pretend that their "attacks" on the ticket were actually true. I wish we had a ticket that was 1/10th as rad as right-wingers pretend it was.
Take over when Biden's dementia advances further.
Of course! You're absolutely right, Phil! I'll be supporting the Biden-Harris ticket but I do wish it were different.
Biden plays it safe
Look I HATE Biden far more than almost any of my friends do. It's the sort of hate that's hard to articulate. But if Trump wins, not only does nothing change, but he can keep attacking abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, &amp; education. Biden is inarguably less bad than Trump.
Round 2 for  (alongside Iron Biden?)
But way worse since Biden and Harris have literally all the same problems Clinton had but times ten
Why not?  Trump and Biden are working for the same people.  No one is more qualified.  It is time.  It doesn't matter who wins.  Populism is on the rise, which will include voters from both parties.
There were probably a dozen better people for Biden to pick tbh.
Stfuuuuu. Is that all you can say?  Biden chose a good woman. These two will make a strong pair.  Stop trying to bring racism and lies into something that will definitely better this upside down country. #BidenHarris2020 #Biden2020
This will be Trump's first time in front of reporters since Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate and the Big Ten and Pac-12 postponed fall football.
Although you were my CLEAR FAVORITE, I am excited for Kamala. I know Biden is smart enough to have you in a huge leadership position in his cabinet.
Trump been putting in OT man I’m shook he may get a second term. Every YouTube video I’ve watched for 2 weeks got double ads of that Biden one
I'm not a political strategist, but I hope #Biden campaign puts #Kamala in Georgia ALL👏THE👏TIME👏
Support #BidenHarris2020 because DUDE GOTTA GO  #Biden #JoeBiden
RIGHT WITH YOU!  BIDEN/HARRIS!!!!
I don’t care that Kamala is the VP honeslty....Biden needs to find a position for Warren tho
Kamala Harris &amp; Joe Biden got something in common, they responsible for the imprisonment of hella aboriginals
We’re thrilled - Biden/Harris 2020! #swingleft #BidenForPresident #KamalaHarrisForVP #electionday #gotv
Biden Harris 2020.  Leggooooo!
This is soooooo awesome!!  I haven’t been this happy, Or had this much hope for our future, in a long time!! She is phenomenal and Biden picking her shows his wisdom! 💜💜💜

The #BreakingNews we all needed to see today!  ⁦ picks ⁦ as his running mate - CNNPolitics #BlackGirlMagic #BlackLivesMatter #BLM
I just wanna say Joe Biden picking this woman is extremely tone deaf to police brutality and #BLM considering her track record. But...... i fucking digress. He really is bout to risk it all lmao
Also, there are legitimately worse choices Biden could have picked. Peeps like Buttigieg &amp; Bloomberg would have definitely been worse than Senator Harris. I'm as unhappy about it as I thought I'd be about it, but this was a long &amp; drawn-out primary with lots of bad candidates.
Kamala Harris "considers herself a Black Baptist" and more about her religious upbringing and perspective.
#BREAKINGNEWS Former Vice President Joe Biden has officially chosen his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris.
Face down Biden and Heels Up Harris 🤪
I like it!!
Picking Kamala was a pretty good idea for Biden. James "Kamala" Harris may not have much political experience, but he will be bringing a much needed populist edge to the Democratic party.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden picked his running mate.
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
I don't like Kamala Harris. She was literally the only woman I was hoping Biden didn't pick. That being said, she is giant improvement from the wet noodle VP we have now.
So was Harris my first choice, no. Is she awesome and amazing and will she make a great VP, absolutely! Whomever you wanted as the Dems P or VP candidate, doesn’t matter. The past is the past. Now we buckle down and support the Biden/Harris ticket all the way!
I don't particularly like Senator Harris, but there are definitely worse choices than her. Like Biden. And I'm sure some of us were afraid Biden would tap Biden for VP so I mean this is definitely not the worst outcome possible.

Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate - CNNPolitics
Biden / Harris 2020  Let’s do this 😎
You’re very welcome miss Marisol!  🥰
You’re welcome 🤗
Lmao Joe Biden finna pick Kamala Harris
Current chances Biden names his "Losing Mate" today 100% Chance its a woman 100% Chance she will be Black 100% Possibility he will lose 100% Moral is: "He who takes Black voters for granted gets hiss Ass served to him on a platter"
If the biggest story media is slobbering over is who will be Biden's losing mate, we are in serious trouble. Who gives a s...!
Joe Biden has pledged to select a woman and has conducted an expansive search, including Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
The thing that CNN correspondents are not mentioning is that Biden would be a one term President and because of that his running mate could be the first black female President elected in 2024.
A vote for Biden is a sign of stupidity.
I saw 1 yards with 4 Biden signs, and it looked like a really dumb house.
Joe Biden finally bout to make the announcement we've all waited for.
I want to let y’all know if #Biden picks Kamala Harris #Howard and all #HBCU graduates are going to show OWT!   Y’all think HBCU graduates annoying now let Kamala get in there ! ✍🏾
Finally president joe Biden makes the announcement we've all waited for.
You all know deep in your hearts that neither Biden nor Trump could handle the grind of an SEC schedule.
Why does media think anyone even cares who Joe Biden picks as "The second loser" for his failing mate?
Uh, oh... Trump, referring to Biden's decision to consider only female candidates: “Some people would say that men are insulted by that. And some people would say it's fine. I don't know." He added that the VP pick ultimately won't matter because "people don't vote for the VP.”
The majority of the people who are voting for Joe Biden are not voting for Joe Biden. They are voting against President Trump. They are suffering from TDS.
The Democratic National Convention also will feature many of Biden's 2020 primary rivals, congressional leaders close to Biden and even everyday Americans.
If God existed, SHE WOULD’VE FRIED trumps ASS During This Bull💩 RANT.  Trump claims Joe Biden will 'hurt God' if elected president  via
People die every day, it’s part of life. Your party is the one destroying America but your TDS won’t let you see it. A vote for Biden is a vote for higher taxes, less jobs and no future.
Trump hasn’t mentioned the Zombie Apocalypse in his scare tactic ads. Boogie man coming disguised as Biden
That is what should happen, yes, but I promise you, you magnificent idiot that it's not what Biden wants.
Joe Biden pressed again to name a Black woman as his running mate
Well that’s a lie, person who tweeted this that isn’t Joe Biden😂
I am in an argument about how the USA will be taxed to death if Biden wins.  Well probably because you can’t  spend millions on a wall, billions on a vaccine and not put that money back with some kind of tax. The money Trump keeps spending is the money we give the government
'Are you freaking kidding me?' Tomi Lahren shreds CNN’s Brian Stelter over criticism of Biden media coverage

That is what I say. I am voting for Biden. We need #45 out of there.
Long week already. Every damn day feels that way to me. I’m ready for the election &amp; to be rid of this toxic POTUS &amp; Senate. I fear everyday until then is going to be exhausting! Of course, there are the 1st three months after Biden wins that we will have to contend with! Jeesh!
Yes Biden +8 is great news! For Trump! Somehow! Or something! (Ps we don’t look at single polls, we look at averages. Try again and harder.)
The panel that vetted the potential VP picks has essentially disbanded, so it's now in Biden's hands, according to one report.
Both your idiocy and TDS are showing. Only Biden is in a bunker, and has been for months.
Makes me sick to my stomach to see this. If Joe Biden becomes president it would be like this nationwide
They Can’t Hide Biden Forever
I bet Biden (the senile one) wouldn’t have made that mistake.
And Jr always has some shit to say about Biden’s mental health? It’s asinine and ridiculous.
Why are you giving Trump so much Screen time so he can ramble on and on and make up lies about Biden and prevent Fauci from talking. Doesn’t he have more important business to take care of?

At least Biden didn't try to get Putin - the guy who is interfering in our democratic elections... AGAIN! ... back into the G8 with the civilized countries. Trumps loyalty is not to the USA.

The choice offers Joe Biden an unusual opportunity to unify a party still reeling from Trump's 2016 win and solidify its future.
Now that's a campaign ad! Biden camp, TAKE NOTES!
Also people can vote for whoever tf they want and if joe Biden doesn’t hold their enough of their beliefs they shouldn’t have to vote for him.

A racist, Dementia Joe Biden, has chosen a Black woman, in Kneepads Harris as his VP, to not only kiss the ass and pander to the Black voter but to also cover up his own racism, which is only one reason he won't take questions.
Biden can't let Trump slide for the good of the country. If Trump gets away with his treasonous corruption, what's to stop the guy. If anything, this has taught us that the president has too much power.
You can’t be so dumb to believe that Biden is the one ignoring the science. Trump literally fought wearing a friggin mask til last month.

Listen Biden wasn't my choice but he won, until we have 60 senators not much is getting done anyway. We have 2022 and 2024 to get those 60 senators we could have reparations in 5yrs if Biden wins, he's the beginning not the end.
So Trump created Covid with his policy you say?  Yalls lack of logic is asinine. Lowest unemployment numbers in decades, and the lowest unemployment for black Americans to before Covid. Now he’s the man to get us back there. Biden has never run a business in his life!

Pure evil. These are the facts that will give black America pause about Harris. Pairing her and Biden's record on crime is a train wreck waiting to happen. We are in deep trouble and we need to get the word out
Yaaaaassss! Biden made the right decision by choosing Kamala Harris to be his VP. #TheReidOut
That is everything about the whole Democrats body. They insist on judging everyone by race then act all sanctimonious about people being judged based on race. Biden just said all blacks are alike, so why did he even pick her as if we didn't know
Trump has secret police on the streets, I'll kill the roaches and take my chances with Biden.
Kamala has a strong back and she isn't afraid to use it. She is a perfect Democrat. She will sacrifice us and rub Biden's back while doing it. It takes a low person to send  innocent people to death roll. Think about that.

I could careless about Kamala banging a married man. I care more about her saying publicly that she supports Biden's victim then taking a nomination from him. I care more about all his racist comments she seems to ignore.
As the father of 2 daughters, this right here is enough reason not to vote for him.  Joe Biden is a creepy ass old man who likes touching young girls WAAAAAAY too much.  This kind of petting is beyond inappropriate.  How is the #MeToo party okay with this BS??? #BidenGroping
Hold your nose and vote for America - that’s Biden/Harris. You will be glad you did!
Oh please no...
Fun fact: Obama/Biden proposed cutting Social Security benefits to Seniors through Chained CPI and Bernie stopped them. With Democrats like that who needs Republicans?
Another “flood the zone with sh#t” strategy? Suppress mail-in (harder to corrupt), make in-person vote harder for the Blue, and narrow Biden’s polling lead, and they’re in a position for a believable e-hack of the totals. Clearly, if these knuckleheads *can* do it, they’ll try.
Tokens we have seen but this level of tokenism, never. What about his sexual assault victim Kamala said she believes? What about Biden saying blacks aren't diverse or has no independent thoughts? This case of tokenism has never been tried before
I ask this bc in addition 2 directly deporting millions of immigrants back 2 areas w/high sex trafficking  There is this effect from what Pres Obama called "his biggest mistake"   So how can 1 vote 4 that legacy
Well that story must be fake because I remember hearing Biden saw out his own mouth he was smarter than most, at the top of his law class and basically a genius. Oh my bag, he was just a great liar.
No I think voting for Biden Harris is an not the son of a hood wearing klansmen
Maybe the POTUS (it sure as hell won’t be Biden) should eradicate these animals that perpetuate this kind of violence?!?
Another argument here is that non American citizens who will die under Biden will die under Trump too. I think this one mostly comes down to an ignorance about current, ongoing American imperialism. It also suggests not voting for Biden is actually, materially, a vote for Trump.
Sure isn't, Donald Trump is quick on his feet and has real world business experience. Biden is a braindead government leach who couldn't negotiate his way out a paper bag and Harris is suck a suck up, that she actually sucks up
Reminder that Joe Biden's campaign pushed people to vote at the polls during the primary, during a pandemic.
While in the same breath claiming a moral need to vote for Biden on behalf of non citizen immigrants!
People will say you must vote for him on behalf of people more marginalized than yourself. And if you bring up the many, many people who will die, directly, due to a Biden presidency, they will discount them entirely on the basis of them not being American citizens.
I didn't mean that Biden is worse than Trump. I mean the guy in 2024 who no one can possibly imagine now.
Tokens are back in😂😂😅 Did everyone forget that Biden just said blacks don't think for themselves?
A racist, sexual assaulting con man? Are we talking about Biden or Trump, because they both qualify for that statement.
Yeah, because the Bible is all for killing babies, taking prayer out of schools and other public institutions and God can't wait to not be praised in his house because people are afraid of diseases. Y'all are following Biden to hell in a hand basket

Trump’s win of the black vote in 2020 will probably be higher than 2016.  I think the 8% will increase to 11-12%.  So that means Biden’s advantage of black vote is approximately 70%.

I took simulations from FiveThirtyEight just outside of 2 standard deviations of confidence (which is roughly the 3rd most biased in their party's direction of each election) to come up with these maps.  These are the 95% confidence maps. Trump/Biden can't do better than these.

I'm honestly just like.... how tf did we come up with Biden and Trump as our two "best" presidential candidates. Like..... actually fucking how?!?!?!?!
Consider a vote for Biden is a vote against a perceived mandate on racism, xenophobia, sexism, and dismantling of necessary institutions. One need not like Biden to see the significant benefit of explicitly voting for him.

The key word there is "try". Biden/Harris will absolutely try to do things we don't like, but anything big like that done without broad bipartisan support will either provoke an electoral backlash or be tied up in court for years. Probably both.
This has to be the last election like this. Our democracy can't take much more without splitting at the seams. The FIRST order of business for the Biden Administration should be the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.

Yang, Kasich, AOC but no Davis, Julian, or Lawrence. I’ll give him Kasich because that seems like a request Biden would make. 🧢twitter made him add Yang. And AOC barely congratulated Kamala.
Biden has proven to me he makes, if not an ally for AsAms, at least a net positive. If anything, racial relations is one positive on his end I can back him on.
If they were in Iowa, Biden/Harris would be stealing corn, if it’s Idaho they’re stealing your potatoes. They know their base believes any lie. The uneducated are always afraid of the boogey man. Trumps always been this way, Pence now just adopted it. He’s just spineless.

Nothing wrong at all. We love this country. We are AMERICAN PATRIOTS. Joe Biden is the biggest joke to run for POTUS since Walter Mondale. When you're right, you're right. When you're left, you're wrong!
You are 1/2 wrong. Biden appeals to neither party, it’s hatred for Trump daring to stand against their vision of Totalitarianism even a monkey would be appealing. Besides Trumps evilness NYT only prints stories aiding my sleep,as they feel nothing more worthy needs to be covered.
Harris doesn’t even believe in Biden! Democrat are be falling for another HOAX!
IMO Barr is going to try to investigate Biden on corruption charges right before the election.
Joe Biden’s tweet about Trump.
Hillary Clinton suggests she's willing to serve in Biden administration: 'I'm ready to help any way I can' | Fox News - Hillary Clinton in office again? ⁦ you’ve got to be kidding me! Put that COMMUNIST in office. Again?!!
1. Has this man had his credentials stripped yer? 2. Has he been named Biden's press secretary yet? 3. Will 1 reporter ask this question at the start of each presser until Trump is out?
She wants the black vote; earlier electoral percentages; she got less than 5%; Joe Biden has absolutely nothing to offer either; almost 50 years in Washington, no record of accomplishments; he and son Hunter got 1.5 billion dollars off of China/corruption/Ukraine dream job.
Biden wants us to wear masks for 3 months minimum. So, right up to the election. Coincidence?
In case there’s the slightest chance Kamala becomes the Vice President, let me be the first to say: Biden didn’t kill himself
Exactly. But Biden and Kamala are too problematic to vote for..
Most republicans don’t even like trump and most democrats don’t like Biden or Kamala how did we choose them as our main characters

Joe Biden says America needs a national face mask mandate "starting immediately."  via
The Biden/Harris campaign need to address the attack on our law enforcement. Explain that “defunding” police departments is not gonna happen. There may be some restructuring measures recommended but not defunding.
Biden needs to be in a senior nursing home; but that is not their plan; democrats do not plan wisely; they plot mysteriously; still kinda believe they/China/WHO/Soro's/Gates conceived a plan to end POTUS's term; they all had something to gain by doing so; China the most part[$$$]
I never said Biden was a hero of the black community. But you, my dude, are very selective with your points there. Record funding for HBCU? That's false. First Step? He just signed it into law, it wasn't even a priority. Jared Kushner and Van Jones did most of the work lol
If Pence, Biden and Trump aren't showing birth certificates then neither is Harris. In fact as long as you are questioning  about anything other than her policies then you are not to call her by her first name. She is not your friend.
Now that we all saw how Trump tried to quid pro quo fake dirt on Biden from Ukraine, it would be a November surprise if a single person believed any report from  Barr or trump.
Biden looks like a walking corpse.
Guess who else won't be voting for (Biden or Trump) in 2020. You should listen to more Baldwin. He warned us of the lesser evil. It's amazing that these people can't do simple math. Adding a zero to both sides of an equation renders that same equation. SMH #NeverBidenNeverTrump
No, he would not vote for Biden. But my question was do you think he'd vote for Trump.  I'm gonna go ahead and assume you never read is his book, huh?

Umm she’s not black . She’s Indian and her family owned slaves. Isn’t that what we are protesting now? Slavery ... and didn’t she call Biden a racist and rapist ? 🤦🏽‍♀️ this was not the best choice .. she’s going to get chewed up and spit out .
Just making sure everyone pronounces her name correctly Last night on Tucker Carlson he was told how to pronounce her name he said comma as in the punctuation la so blame him he was the one who started it being a jerk No adjustment needed for hidin biden &amp; hateful harris By Karen
Oh, that is so good
Biden continues his track record
Biden wants mask mandate but not for his friends.
there is an endless supply of this divisive issue...ALL ppl are racist regardless of their race All one had to do was use this to pit them against each other Brilliant! Thank God Hidin Biden can "heal the soul of our country" What effin bullsh!t
Earlier today, a socialist Facebook friend of mine was mocking leftists for saying they would hold their nose to vote for Biden/Harris, and I just keep finding more articles to put in that thread.
Today joe Biden not only told us we should wear masks but then also demonstrated that you MUST cover your eyes while putting it on🥴😂 #sleepyjoe
Did any one tell him that he is currently the president, so the crime and taxes kinda fall on his record not Joe Biden's...
So inspirational. I have so much hope knowing Bloomberg and Republicans are going to coax Biden to help people on the brink of homelessness and helplessness in this country. Woohoo!

Again this has nothing to do with Biden winning the election
You're so cute. But clearly dumber than a pile of bricks. It's ok, though, when Biden is president, you'll get they college education you so desperately need and so clearly lack lol. Night, sweetie 😘😘
Biden advises Trump to invoke the DPA very early, but Trump’s pride wouldn’t let him take the advice. So...165,000+
You are literally helping Biden get elected by not wearing a mask.  Nice job!
Ok? And?  Nothing you have posted from Epstein to Clinton has anything to do with this election, trumps failures, trumps lies, or the fact he is losing. If you hate Biden and love trump so much maybe a better use of your time is actually doing positive campaign work for trump?

Oh please. Leftists, Never Trumpers and Atheists have been trying to use religious arguments and the pope for 4 years.  What they don’t talk about though is the alternative.  President Trump is better for Christians of all denominations over Biden/Obama/Harris and the rest.
And it's not all that crazy, because Biden AND Harris have at least shown an ability to be pushed to the left if pressure is applied.
Thank you for helping Joe Biden get elected.  The Democratic Party thanks you for keeping the virus going.

Wait wait wait...guessing you’re a Fox News fan???
Joe Biden is a windbag!  He didn’t do anything for small business while he was in office and he definitely won’t do it if he becomes President. He is moving us toward socialism/communism. Is that really what America stands for?  I think not!
So bet it's crowded in there! In trump's brain. It seems that Obama and Clinton has been there for over 5 years, and now move over here comes Biden and Harris!!..

I feel you. If you just think logically, the dems were very divided in 2016.. and are pretty united right now. There is a female POC on the ticket, and several prominent republicans have abandoned Trump. Biden is the perfect centrist to peel away his support.

Lotta black ppl think this concept is so far fetched, but Latinos have BEEN doing this. Both parties know that the Latino vote could go either way so they actually attempt to EARN their vote EVERY election. But like Biden said black ppl ain’t “DIVERSE” in their way of thinking.
If black people withheld their votes this election instead of just giving it to Biden, we would essentially be free agents in 2024. Do y’all understand how much leverage we would have politically, both sides of the aisle would do everything they could to try an earn our vote.

Standard politics that is part of any primary—Clinton &amp; Obama got pretty nasty with each other in 2008 and yet they worked well together for four years. Part of what made Biden look bad in Dem debates was his relutance to really go on the attack like that.
What is most likely to happen on Election Day or maybe Election week at this rate.  Trump will have huge leads of 10+ points in all the swing states and even be leading or close in solid blue states.  Then as the night goes on and week goes on Biden will slowly come back.
Several reasons: 1. Trump is a fascist destroying our norms and seeking to rig the election in his favor by hobbling the USPS 2. Biden-Harris are two of the most compassionate people in politics 3. They are running on a great platform designed to help working folks succeed

I’m sure a small percentage of Bernie supporters being insensitive after the SC primary outweighs the racism of Joe Biden’s support for school segregation in the 70s, welfare cuts and mass incarceration in the 90s, and murdering a million Arabs in Iraq in the 00s.
Kamala went toe to toe with Joe, confronted him, stood her ground, and asked the tough questions. Biden didn’t take it as an insult or disrespect. Biden saw her for the strong woman she is and he picked her for that quality. It takes a real man to do that. #TrumpIsLosing

Tax cut isn't touching social security. Do remember how hard it was to get a good job under Obama? More taxes and regulations mean fewer good paying jobs. Plus Biden isn't going to protect people. He supports defunding the police and getting rid of the 2nd amendment.

Really it comes down to money. I will have more money if Trumps President. Democrats will take my money if they get into the White House. Biden already said he was going to raise taxes.
Here's your savior of single payer:
This is true... Many folks feared Kamala on the top of the ticket to be attacked by racist Trump. Joe that felt was a safer bet to lead as we have seen they were right Trump is struggling to hurt Biden, they did not want Kamala to take that direct fire. But want her on the ticket

This is so wrong.  Nobody buys this crap anymore.  The Democrats are as corrupt as the GOP half of the duopoly.  Biden "I will veto M4A if it comes across my desk" is no progressive.  But you already know that, and this is just mindfukery from the duopoly.

He is absolutely the greatest conman to ever live. I recently had a Trump supporter tell me that if I voted for Biden we would have to worry about Sharia law becoming more common in this country. SHARIA LAW in a country 70%+ Christian 🙄🙄🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤣🤣
And you have no evidence that Trump is a racist. But yet look throughout Biden's history many many many questionable comments. And Trump was a Democrat star until he decided to run for the Republican party in 2016
If I could get a penny for every lie that Harris and Biden will say during this campaign I would be a billionaire. Super thin 48 hours I've already got a thousand bucks. Of course she doesn't feel Biden is a racist her parents owned slaves. #Trump2020
If Bernie has picked her and primed her like Biden did - I would still see an old privileged white man tokenizing a woman of color to the benefit of is white station. My tweet is a response to how Biden showcased Kamala. Look, think before you write to me!

So segregation isn't racism? He said, "blacks are not as diverse as Hispanic people". Who are you trying to convince me or yourself, Biden isn't racist.
You know how crackers handle injustice? We don't vote for race, we vote for policy. Just like blacks will vote for Biden/Harris but they helped mass incarcerate blacks. Instead of being used by politicians, why not try something different.
You know, your biggest problem is that it always has to be about you. “I did this, I did that.” I’m not sold on Biden, but at least he picked someone who calls out his weakness to make him stronger. All you want are ‘yes (wo)men’. You fire someone the second they disagree w/ you.
I think all politicians are liars &amp; will say whatever is good to get a vote. It all comes down to voting for the lesser of evils, however many choices we have at that time. I’m voting for Biden/Harris because they have experience and HOPEFULLY do what’s best for the American ppl
I'm a Biden/Harris Republican.
I know our friends on the right always try to dismiss these polls unless they’re winning of course. I think 🤔 the thing that’s alarming to me is Biden has 2 point lead in Georgia and a virtual dead heat in Texas....Folks Democrats don’t usually win those state lets be for real.

I am energized more than ever by the Biden/Harris ticket to get Trashy tRUMP out of office!!
This woman is beyond nuts......it’s time for you to retire, get some help, and enjoy your life   Why would you suggest that something is going to happen to Joe Biden. Was that a threat?
In the last of four proposals, Biden's "build back better" earmarks $775 billion to the "caring economy" over the next decade.   His plan also includes enhancing infrastructure and tackling climate change.
Maybe the first thing Biden should do if elected is tell everyone that comes forward, that any NDA signed with trump is void, presidential pardons all around. I wonder how many thousands would speak. Also I wish the extra debate Trump wanted could be against Harris.
University of Pennsylvania's  researchers estimate [Biden’s tax plan] would raise between $2.3 - $2.6 trillion. That’s $600 billion less than what Biden wanted.  The study also estimates it would decrease economic growth by 0.1 percent by 2030.
This is not a wash. Biden/Harris will not end healthcare. They will not ruin medicaid/ social security. They will not gut the post office. There will be better plans for saving the environment. A national response to coronavirus.   I think there are issues with the ticket.
The Secret Service needs to make sure she doesn't attend any Joe Biden events for the next four to eight years.
It's Thurssday August 13, 2020 and Joe Biden is still in his basement. #NoJoe2020

Of course that is if Biden is the candidate. If not.... some of this begins to make some sort of sense.
Yeah, I agree that of Biden's final 3-4 choices, Kamala Harris was the best to have to debate against Mike Pence.  The big question though is she can probably outdebate Pence, but you have to coexist with her for 4 years. Can he after what happened in the first primary debate?
Y’all can miss me with all this nitpicking about #KamalaHarrisVP. We have a job to do, remember? Biden/Harris 2020!!
That’s correct. Independents like me &amp; my NC friends voted for Bernie bc M4All, but Biden won’t support it. He’s just another Wall St. puppet. And yes we don’t reside in the center (Libertarians, Green leaning).

Weirdos in my office that watch conservative media like  honestly believe the DNC is going to replace Biden with Hillary bc they think Biden has dementia.  I wish I was making this up.
It feels like Trump and Pence are running in a different century from Biden and Harris.  You'd have to go back to the first half of the the 20th Century for their language and tropes to make sense.  The voters they're after are mostly dead now, but alas, racism is timeless

Biden needs these votes in crucial swing states. For the left, the Biden/Harris combo is the worst possible combination of candidates. A moderate who worked with Obama and a "cop."  It's not that Harris is a bad politician. In fact, she's great, and that's why she is despised.

Right now, the Dems are heavily split between those that supported a moderate candidate and those that support more radical change (2/3 to 1/3) while the Repubs are staunchly united behind Trump.   In places like MI, WI, and PA, this apathy amongst the far-left could hurt Biden

The biggest similarity between Joe and Trump is that they both say stupid things.  The difference is that Biden says he ‘didn’t mean it that way’, whereas Trump says ‘and?’.  #OwnIt
A District Authority’s job is to put people in jail. Period!  What are we even arguing about? It’s only 2 choices. Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris.  We see where Trump has gotten us. Let’s move forward in Nov. and if you want to fix the political system focus on your local elections
Also Biden has hated on minorities throughout his entire political career that's why he wrote the 94 crime bill to make sure his kids wouldn't have to grow up in an urban jungle. He also agreed with hilary when she said black people are super predators. #votefreedom
Hunter Biden Could Cause More Trouble For Joe - New Investigation Shows "No Income Hunter" Paid Off $450,000 Tax Lien In 6 Days  Hmmmm.....how did this happen?
criticism of Biden/Harris is necessary, but if leftists are so concerned about the potential failure of their administration, shouldn’t there be a much bigger conversation about the formation of a third party?
I'm already completely bored with Biden/Harris and the fawning media. TV news will be muted until Thanksgiving.
Was watching Biden/Harris on MSNBC.  Todd appeared - switched to CNN.  Will wait until he is gone and will flip back.
They don’t most are still saying we need Biden because he was with Obama
This is a Soros audition.None of these law masters have regard for that thing. Oh like joe,the constitution and citizens rights. Dirty dirty dogs!!There needs to be the real criminals Comey and Brennen McCabe Barack and the Biden’s just too start that need this special treatment
I just heard the Biden/Harris ticket speak and I’m PUMPED!
Gonna be a long campaign. Judging from the past few days, any time I show the slightest excitement or praise for actions of the Biden-Harris ticket I will have randos descending into my mentions whining about how they're both Hitler, or something.
Biden ain’t shyt either if you really look at what he stands for
Unfortunately as long as people think this way by voting for the “lesser of 2 evils” or to “get that person out of office” we will never end the duopoly. Vote on your principles. If Teump still wins then you voted Biden for nothing. Jo needs the support for now and the future.
Haha! Excellent campaign ad for Biden!😂
And don’t you dare ask about his health and mental faculties. Those are out of bounds topics, just not for Reagan, McCain, &amp; Trump, all of whom were younger than Biden is now when they ran for office, including Reagan’s second term.
Yes. I thought it was pretty wierd she left early. But it was paving Biden path in retrospect. In fact the numbers of candidates made it easier to juke and jive to make sure Biden got the nomination. That's why so many. If you think about it the Dem voters were used.
This Biden presser is a joke!!  It's nothing but trash Trump!  It's ALL they have 🤣  Dementia Joe and knee pads Ho 😜
I liked the ep but it really seemed strange how little President Obama came up in relation to Biden or in the past history of Black turnout.

I would say it’s odd you are talking about little girls but then again you are joe biden!
This is like saying that the bottom of the Mariana Trench is a lesser evil than the summit of Mt Everest. That's how big the void is between that orange walrus &amp; Biden as far as evil goes. I would love for it to be Bernie, but anyone is better than that evil mongrel Trump.

Lol!, I think we all know the real reason Bill.  Don't worry Biden will not be allowed near any debate stage.
not holding my breath that this "groove" will make any real moves.  all show...we deserved so much better.  #Biden wanted to play it safe? ugggg...usually that means status quo
Kamala Harris gone save Biden ass had he chose someone else Trump would’ve had shit locked in again Fa sho
This is the anti black male ticket, she can help Biden speak to black people since his racism keeps slipping through
Joe Biden being our only option was PREVENTABLE.
Where did the Covid19 go today? Joe Biden sure had a major turn around on his belief of the virus at the VP announcement. They were hugging, kissing, shaking hands and nobody was social distancing.  This is just the beginning of things to come.
absurdly bad choice...points out Biden isn't really devoted to #blacklivesmatter or the worker or young people or progressives or...  This represents status quo in the worst way.
You need to rewite your tweet.  Start with  "Anti-Christian publication and fringe Biden-world blogger the Dailybeast..."
From the candidates Biden is considering, there will plenty of material to work with.  Their race and gender will be irrelevant.
Joe Biden needs to divorce his wife and marry Michelle Obama....this is the only way for him to recover.  It also should be known that Michelle Obama and Joe Biden had an affair during Baracks presidency. They were told to keep there love under wraps....

Except one of the images they are using in their latest ad to attack Biden, a Catholic who says his faith helped him with the loss of his son, is of him with his head bowed praying in Church. Even as an Atheist, I don't see how Trump's people are going to get past that.
At what point does Occam's Razor suggest that Trump and Biden must have some kind of bet about who can say the dumbest things and get away with them?Where is Biden in that list?

For Biden’s age and the type of work he is applying for, a cognitive test should be expected and welcomed. Remember the #Presidency is an institution that supersedes everything! The person taking that institution no longer gets to choose because they have brain fog.

What the hell?!  This is just stupid, but I suppose there are some who will believe that Biden/Harris are gonna steal their burgers right out of their hands. 🙄
What? Hillary won the popular vote dude. A huge majority of “Bernie Bros” voted for Hillary based on exit polls. Biden Bots just trying to make an excuse if they lose I guess.
Fox puts out solid polls but we all know trump will end up around 45%. Biden needs to be at least at 49 and maybe 50 for this to be comfortable. I don’t care about landslides or any of that. I’m on al Davis mood, just win baby.   #BidenHarris
Unbelievably there are people who are not Trump supporters but would not vote for Biden if you put a gun to their head. Get it??
And you’re right, we can be more responsible. Elect Biden and Harris because the current racist and liar in chief ain’t working.
I’ve resigned myself that I will have to vote in person even though I’m immune compromised. I plan to mask up, use face shield, and gloves. I will look ridiculous, but I’ll be damned if I’m letting Turd Trump and dastard DeJoy keep me from voting Biden/Harris!!

Is he drunk and/or drugged? Did his staffers slip valium into his McDonald's burger because they knew he'd flip out watching Biden-Harris? He seems unusually incoherent this afternoon. Bless his heart. #trumpPressBriefing
I have to wonder how much of Biden's choice of running mate is because of her abilities  and not because of the pressure to choose a woman of color. Doesn't matter in this household though. We are all Trump all the time. #voteTrump2020

At that time there wasn't a chance in hell Biden would be the nominee. If only Tulsi would've been allowed to keep on debating.
Senator Kamala Harris is a great choice by Vice President Biden for his running mate. She is an enthusiastic and inspiring public servant who fights for justice and equality. I am ready to work so that we can see this ticket succeed in November.
I hope no one was pinning their hopes on a Progressive. That's like hoping Biden will suddenly endorse M4A.  #DemExit  #NeverBiden  #NeverKamala

I just wanna say Joe Biden picking this woman is extremely tone deaf to police brutality and #BLM considering her track record. But...... i fucking digress. He really is bout to risk it all lmao
So was Harris my first choice, no. Is she awesome and amazing and will she make a great VP, absolutely! Whomever you wanted as the Dems P or VP candidate, doesn’t matter. The past is the past. Now we buckle down and support the Biden/Harris ticket all the way!

Current chances Biden names his "Losing Mate" today 100% Chance its a woman 100% Chance she will be Black 100% Possibility he will lose 100% Moral is: "He who takes Black voters for granted gets hiss Ass served to him on a platter"
If the biggest story media is slobbering over is who will be Biden's losing mate, we are in serious trouble. Who gives a s...!
Why does media think anyone even cares who Joe Biden picks as "The second loser" for his failing mate?
Well that’s a lie, person who tweeted this that isn’t Joe Biden😂
I am in an argument about how the USA will be taxed to death if Biden wins.  Well probably because you can’t  spend millions on a wall, billions on a vaccine and not put that money back with some kind of tax. The money Trump keeps spending is the money we give the government
Both your idiocy and TDS are showing. Only Biden is in a bunker, and has been for months.

Russia Continues Interfering in Election to Try to Help Trump, U.S. Intelligence Says
Current odds for Biden's chances of carrying the Black vote &amp; winning this election: Well, Let's just say: You have a better chance of winning the lottery without buying a ticket.
At least she is 1/1025 Native American, so Biden could say he has a woman of color as his VP pick.
I guess that takes her out of Biden's list of VP candidates! Can't have a depressed VP along with an early dementia President.
Yes why not now? We sure as hell won't get it with Biden. Trump said many years ago that we need Universal healthcare,  that we need to take care of our people.

Ok, I’ll admit it. I’m a Trump supporter! I don’t always agree with him. The one I do not like is jokes about Biden’s mental state. He could be facing something that he has no control over...dementia. That’s no laughing matter. It is a praying matter though!
He'll announce on November 1st that the vaccine is complete and ready to go but won't be released if Biden becomes president. Yes, he will pull that stunt.

it matters not what you present to hurt  Biden. If you expect ANY BIDEN FOLLOWER to re-think their choice and get on board with Trump, then you need a better candidate. We see Trump with all his frailties and he just does not measure up. Not going to happen!!

Biden thought he was running for senate and said we should reelect Trump. Then mispronounced Kamalas name in their first outing just as the MSM was expressing outrage about tucker doing it.
not if trump is directing postal employees to throw the ballots in the trash as maddow stated last night on her show. no ballots. no vote for biden. trump wins
Dude Reggie! Biden is an exceptional racist lots of game tape on this one. And that’s not an all Presidents comment. You can find lots of reasons to not vote for Trump but to say one is because Biden is not racist means your not paying attention
Joe Louis' trainer, "Chappie" Blackburn, once told the up and coming Brown Bomber "When you get into the ring, let your fists be the referee," meaning don't let it be close, because white people will rig the rules. The same applies to Biden/Harris now. If it's close, they lost.
That was awesome! One of those great moments from Tucker. Nothing from MSM about Biden's pronunciation. The hypocrisy of the left on display yet again.
Four years of neglect, unilateralism, and failed diplomacy have left America’s alliances in tatters. It’s time to rebuild them.
so if it was the other way around you would then vote for biden? like you care about children cause if you did you would be screaming about this hollywood pedo ring that is being brought down cause the MSM isnt talking about it
Even more reason to vote for Biden
The #ShitholePresident did not build a great economy, he inherited a good economy from Obama/Biden and then the #GOPTaxScam goosed it further with massive debt and deficits. As usual, it will take a Democratic admin to correct the situation.

Biden/Harris for a sane government.

Is this a threat on Joe Biden's life?from   on
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
Gym I wouldn’t throw the word prosecute around much if I were you. Some people in the Biden administration might get ideas.
If that's true then every sin Bidens ever committed you allowed and champion because you support him.  Kamala sins too and she is a prostitute just ask Willie brown. Biden gropes children past the point of their uncomfortableness often. Your doing that too.

Well, tell that to Joe Biden
your spinning on Biden and Harris is LAUGHABLE!!   is truly shit and the anchors have no problems exposing their empty souls . How do your wives, husbands and kids NOT look at you with disdain
Good job on  first appearance as Biden’s VP running mate. 👍
Tuned in at the end of Biden. Watched all of Kamala. I have, for the first time in 4 years, some joy. I loved she said “Trump”.  Not President.
In response to the Biden/Harris announcement, both my parents said to me – separately – that Harris "laughs too much, it's annoying," and I just....   uuuuugggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh *insert feminist rage*

I've been watching a lot of sports without fans, which has been weird, but the weird handoff between Biden and Harris without any applause to cover it has been one of the more obvious instances where it just feels empty and strange.
Are there people out there that actually believe the dribble Joe Biden is spewing?
Maybe not, but Biden thinks he's running for Senate and said we must reelect Trump. Then he wields the power of who's black as well.  Step back down.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
Do you think Biden could handle the way Trumps been treated as President in the last 3 1/2 years? I dont know anyone who could remain as calm as he has while taking fire from a sides.
That is such total utter BS. Biden is probably the most devote church goer in politics. He has never tried to take guns or support any such legislation, limit them yes,put restrictions yes but never to take away. He supports the police.
I wouldn’t want this criminal Joe Biden as anything except maybe sitting in his jail cell at GITMO until... He’s a traitor.
You have awful grammar.  He has been invited to the White House and sat with POTUS what have you done lately?  Vote Biden and be black instead of fighting for America.  Fall into the Democrat trap.  Don't research what they have done to cities and the black population.

Inside Biden’s unusual VP pick process: Tough questions, 11 finalists and many lawyers
In addition, Biden was responsible for a provision in the 1986 crack law which came to be viewed as one of the most racially slanted sentencing policies on record: a rule that treated crack cocaine as significantly worse than powder cocaine and ended...(1/2)
1994 crime law, which Biden helped author when he was a senator, incentivized local police departments to lock up as many black people as possible, creating mass incarceration of African Americans, along with more prison cells and more aggressive policing.
Word is Trump plans to drop Pence from the ticket and add both Diamond and Silk to be more competitive against the Biden/Harris ticket.  #LincolnProject
The quotes from Biden are facts. Showing a legacy of racism still strong inside him he cant stop himself from sying them. His own VP called him racist and believes his accusers as well.
Everyone has an opinion about Biden/Kamala and that’s kool.....but.......Trump gota go so all that don’t matter!

People gotta chill with the Biden slander... I knows he's not who everyone would've wanted but that's not what matters
Who tf r u helping man. Better than pence better than trump and better than Biden she is

Biden may have lost YOUR vote, but he didn't lose any critical centrist votes in any state any Democrat could win.
Last I checked Joe Biden doesn’t want health-care-for-all because of the high price tag
No, I wouldn’t expect him to have the decency to congratulate the new president.  He would feel belittled, embarrassed and humiliated standing behind Biden at inauguration.  More likely to have a Twitter kniption fit from Florida on Inauguration Day.
5 Takeaways On The New Biden-Harris Presidential Ticket
I will vote for Biden/Harris, but I can't support the ticket with my time or money. Harris has a terrible record, she's an unprincipled opportunist who doesn't care about the needs of the poor.
Ast night you said what if Biden is faking his dementia.  He is.  This way when he gets accused for Ukraine and indicted, he "wont be mentally fit to stand trial" and he cant throw people under the bus.
Although I have issues with the ticket itself I will absolutely still vote for Biden and Harris. But if you know anything about her being AG for California she put a lot of black and brown people in prison and the effects it had on the black family was devastating.
Kamala Harris, who Democrat Joe Biden announced Tuesday as his running mate, said last year that she believes the women who accused Biden of sexual assault. “I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it,” Harris said in 2019.

TRUTH! Friday or Saturday I heard a Biden ad on YT which advised his supporters that they would get "advance notice of his VP pick" if they would click down below to sign up so their voices could be heard. I didn't click since I don't care about him or his VP. #ADOS
It’s not like I’m gonna stop supporting Biden, but I think this really hurts him more than it helps...
So Biden does a political stop for the first black pres, is “friends” with someone (who changed since he was your age), and you’ve proven that Rs aren’t racist.  The logic of Trump supporters. Maybe ull change! If you are ever capable of debate, I won’t even know. What a shame.
What we shouldn’t do is act like my girl Kamala was not dragging tf out of Biden during the primaries.
Okay we don’t have to like Kamala but I’m hoping everyone has enough common sense to know we still voting for her and Biden 🥴

Biden's VP pick: Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots
She’s a great pick.   My issue was with how the Biden campaign seemed to have narrowed the search to only black women, and did it to try and raise them up like they needed any help.   It’s become clear however, that women were the only viable options to be the next VP.
She is. She would’ve been my pick too.   My point was that it seemed the Biden Team narrowed the search to a black female only.   It has been brought to my attention that there were no viable candidates that didn’t fit that description.
At least he did something Biden proved he wouldn't have dont that with his false accusations. Now you act like he has a magic wand when he just said he'd keep Fauci and more of the same that Trump is doing.
I don’t think that. I think she is the best choice, and gives him the best chance to win (I’d like to hear who you would’ve picked). I am happy to see that a women of color was picked. But I thought it was clear that the Biden campaign was only picking a VP that was a female.

Voting for Biden/Harris not matter what.🦋
Record homelessness is in the democrat ran cities and was increased more during Biden and Obama's eight years.  Covid death records also set in democrat cities. You have no tally of all of the president's lies and certainly dont care to remember Bidens because its 2020 right?
The recession didn't recover under Biden it came back with Trump before Covid hit we had the best numbers across the race spectrum of jobs. Covid killed those people and Biden called trump racist for banning travel for three months before admitting it was the right move.
I don’t care if you support Trump or Biden or whoever. Be mindful that not everything you see or read online is real.
Ok, I’m all in. 100%. Biden-Harris!!!

Don’t you think it’s pathetic the Biden Team chose to select a VP based on the candidate’s race and gender, not by character or qualifications? If Kamala truly is the best choice, then choose her. Instead they chose to come out and say “We’re only choosing a black female for VP”.

What I don’t understand is if black people where that excited about her. We had the opportunity to vote her in at the top of the ticket. The reason why Biden is at the top of the ticket is Soley because of black people.
Just as afraid as black men and women were when she sentenced them to unfair sentences. Let me hold my nose and vote for Biden and Harris. But don’t act like we have overcome. When we still fighting the cops. And we just picked a cop for VP.

Interesting choice by Biden. Kamala Harris seems to be an elitist. "The California Democrat and her spouse, lawyer Douglas Emhoff, reported about $1.9 million in adjusted gross income for last year, according to tax returns released earlier this year."
Biden was a slimy oft pres candidate when Obamessiah picked him. Slumping for go pick is their thing apparently.

It's looking more like it. Why do you think Biden would pick her over Kamala Harris?
so that's why the only black president in American history chose Joe Biden - give me a break!!
Trump said if Biden wins the Election we will have to learn Chinese.  But if he wins I know we will have to learn Russian and lose our democracy.
Getting mad that Eric Trump used a clip of Robin Williams making fun of Joe Biden? No editing just a clip of a man expressing what he thought of Joe Biden. Just because it doesn’t fit your narrative doesn’t make it wrong. If Biden used a dead comedian to bash Trump you’d be fine.
Pretty sure trump knows hes running for President and not Senate. Pretty sure Trump never said that they had to reelect Biden at his own conference.  Pretty sure Trump didn't say if you aren't voting for him you aren't black and that Latinos are diverse unlike black people.
Even at Trumps worst he's 10x better than Biden you can see past the mold you've been conformed to.
Uh, oh... Trump, referring to Biden's decision to consider only female candidates: “Some people would say that men are insulted by that. And some people would say it's fine. I don't know." He added that the VP pick ultimately won't matter because "people don't vote for the VP.”
People die every day, it’s part of life. Your party is the one destroying America but your TDS won’t let you see it. A vote for Biden is a vote for higher taxes, less jobs and no future.

So your saying he hasn't changed his course of "action" from doing absolutely nothing for the many years hes been a politician, yet somehow if hes elected president he will magically transform? Lying Biden sold you a huge one.
I went on a two week road trip from NC to Washington July 19-August 1. Visited 19 states stayed in Washington 4 days.  Did not see ANY Biden bumper stickers, flags, billboards, or any other Biden campaign advertising the entire trip.  Polls are fake and so is Biden's support.

It matters to me because as much as I like Biden I am preparing for what the future holds. And #TheFutureisFemale

You know, with the lack of Biden signs around (are they even printing them?) and lackluster ad buys, are they leading him to the convention and then going to knock him out?
They better Votep they ass on somewhere .... Joe Biden don’t even know what day it is half the time ....lol ... we really voting for his VP ... hope he don’t fuck that up lol smh
You can’t be seriously trying to make the case that Joe Biden is mentally equipt to be the president
if you don’t like Trump...there’s no way you can like Biden 😂
If Biden opposes it, it’s good for the country.
I’ll explain it for you...centrist establishment dems using the argument “Kanye is going to steal base voters, so if you vote third party or don’t vote for Biden, you’re essentially voting for trump” - that’s “punching left”.

I agree with everything that sign says but I really hate to break it to you, ladies, but voting for Biden isn't going to accomplish any of that. In fact, he might make it worse. The two-party system is broken and doesn't work. The (R's) and the (D's) don't work for us.

Kind of like the Biden situation.
Did I hear an apology? Nah. THAT’S not gonna happen. The leftist media love her assertion, albeit it false. But what does that matter. At least she’s consistent, even if she’s wrong and temperamental. Biden’s choice? OMG!!!!!
How many racial gaffes does Biden get before the Black community becomes aware that he’s only their “ally” and friend during election years?   Another insult today. “The blacks aren’t as diverse as the Latinos”. How can you possibly vote for this career politician?
Biden’s gaffe that African Americans lack diversity was an error and and I hope he thinks twice before he makes such ridiculous statements.

I agree. And Biden believes in the importance of Climate change, healthcare, and foreign policies. Right now, we change Trump's policies and begin truly working on progressive changes for 2022 and 1024. Let's find the candidates were KNOW want true changed and will fight 4 them.
I will criticize Biden. He's not progressive enough. But he can at least stop the damage going on from Trump. We should've been helping progressivev candidates long before now and must start for 2022,2024. 3 months is just enough time but an end to the current madness.

It drives him nuts that nothing sticks against Biden. Joe Biden has been in public life for an eternity. People just don't buy the attacks on him. People don't associate those things with Biden.
This is a pretty revealing tweet. He just can't accept that Biden can't be pinned down so easily like Clinton.

I’m seriously wondering if that’s not why Biden is saying that. It’s been proven over and over that they have little to no affect on prevention of the virus.
We may be screwed this next election if this guy is that good
Nobody's expecting Biden (or Trump) to fix all the world's problems. But it sure would be nice to have a President that wasn't actively making more!
I hope this is incorrect! Professor who accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump
Dunno ... tell me  This scared the hell out of me ...
It’s hilarious that these people think Biden has any clue how to fast track an economic recovery. The first thing he will do is give away Nancy’s 3 Trillion dollars, then raise taxes by 4 Trillion while a ton of ppl are out of work. He’ll spend the SS money in his first month.
None of them. It’s all about JoJo!! #JoJorgensen2020 !!!! Voting for Biden or Trump is a vote for old racist sex offending pedophiles!!
I'm watching VP Biden speak abt the virus. What a breath of fresh air! He makes sense, I CAN trust what he says &amp; he's not degrading his apponents by calling them names &amp; acting like a bully. He's acting like an adult &amp; leader. It's like someone we've known has finally come home.
That's great and all but please don't give the Biden administration a pass like you did for the Obama administration. If Trump taught us nothing else it's that when you ignore abuses from your side, they will be doubled down on by the other side.
Obama/Biden: "Listen to scientific experts. Constantly reevaluate options." Trump/Pence: "The FDA is wrong. Listen to the demon-sperm lady. There are only two options: take Hydroxychloroquine or inject yourself with bleach."

This country is a mess. As a Conservative, I want a guaranteed, accurate election. In person or absentee with Verified ID. There is too much division and distrust on both sides for any mail in nonsense. And if we LEGITIMATELY elect Biden, then so be it. I’ll do what I have to.
LISTEN. Biden should’ve picked Bernie as his running mate. But I see what they did. Having an African American woman on the ticket is MONUMENTAL, so I’m not taking anything from her. Trump is going to spend the next 80 days focusing on defining a woman.. &amp; what she should be.
The media really wants me to be excited about the Biden/Harris presidential ticket don't they.

good interview with Jack Lew this morning.  If Biden wins you think he brings him back to Treasury to tackle this mess? Or consider keeping Mnuchin and allowing him to negotiate without the limitations he clearly has now.
It means Biden is a stooge who they put up because they see him as “electable”. Then, they slip an in unelected socialist (Heels up) to fast track the socialist agenda that Trump halted. I feel like the voters will see through this obvious trickery and do the right thing though.

While some of y'all are bashing Biden and/or Harris, I just have one question:  What outcome are you trying to bring about? Like, what goal is putting the Dem ticket on blast going to achieve for you?  Because the effect it WILL have is to persuade some people not to vote at all.

I was thinking the same: Biden has a trusted, dedicated staff. No leaking implies they are a team working toward the same goal. A novel concept after 3.5 years of chaos.

Your thoughts are always appreciated. I think she’ll bring energy. My brothers were thrilled, 1 is in Utah, the other NM. We have very different politics. I think Biden trusts her judgment, &amp; since we have no idea what’s up w/him, she may have a large behind the scenes role?
What’s the bet Biden mistakes a different black woman for Kamala
That’s a Joe Biden quote.... come on man
Now Biden will have a legitimate stranglehold on SF...without Harris he never would have had that...this is the equivalent of JFK picking LBJ
What is the game here?  Why do they want Trump to win re-election? They never thought Biden was up to the job, and the VP pick only makes the loss more likely.  #WTF
Biden will step down sometime in 2022 immediately after Obama is sworn in as Supreme Court Justice.

Looking up and down my timeline... let me get into it with some of y’all...   I want it to be clear.   I am voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   I’m not debating and I’m not convincing y’all to switch.   Do you. Be respectful. And let’s not engage.
Yeah this is the only reason why I’m not feeling Biden &amp; Harris
Kamala knows about salty replies.   She gave one to Joe biden.  In the debate.
Agree she has so much to answer for. While we are at it Joe Biden I do not forget your years of racist legislation.  What is an Independent to do?
Biden will be 78 if he is inaugurated. Perhaps the VP will be VERY important.

I hope we will see you in the Biden Administration. Secretary of State perhaps.
If Biden were elected, and re elected by some God foresaken reason, he will be 85 at the end of his second term. I just realized that. There’s no way this is possible, so Harris is the real Presidential candidate. Biden is just more “electable” right now. Sans the dementia....
Right- same goes for Chicago, San Fran, LA, New York and Portland. These douche nozzles get elected over and over and over. I mean, how can a buffoon like Biden get re-elected so many times that he has 50 years in office???
You know I was alright with voting for Biden in November but KAMALA HARRIS FOR VP???? As if 2020 cannot get any worse

Don’t get me wrong, I still do not like Biden. But he has Kamala and I’d pick Biden over Trump any day.
From now till November 3rd. As you well said, everything will be sexist and racist! And both will supposedly work on behalf of Biden’s pick! However, Trump is not a PC person. He will find one thousand ways to unmask their radical agenda! Trump 2020!!!
Biden Harris 2020, here we come! 🇺🇸
I read a tweet the other day that said the moderates got Biden. The progressives should get a more progressive VP. That makes sense to me. I'd be voting for Biden regardless but I am glad he chose someone to FINALLY represent the most reliable voting bloc in the D Party
Congrats!! Can’t wait to vote for Biden/ Harris!! 💙🥁🙌
You as usual, a HYPOCRITE &amp; LIAR!  It's Biden not a racist anymore? Lol
Is it bad that I am more excited about Harris as VP than Biden as Prez.  Conventional wisdom is that VP choice doesn’t change any vote, which is the case for me, But man that boosts voter enthusiasm!!!  I’m gonna go fantasize about what is gonna b their signature policy GN
Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!! Biden Kamala for the WIN!!!!

Even if it’s Charles Manson himself, I’ll vote for Biden and blue all the way. 😁
Y'all are spending so much energy on who Biden's running mate will be... He could choose a damn sock and it would be a better president than this clown.
DNC mailed the VP pick to Biden. He didn't choose.  He wants to inform the other losers b4 announcing.
THEY WANT YOU TO KNEEL TO THE NATIONAL ANTHEM &amp; THE AMERICAN FLAG. BUT THEY ALLOW BURNING, LOOTING, &amp; MURDER. THIS IS THE FUTURE OF AMERICA IF BIDEN IS ELECTED
No.  That would only happen if Biden chose a gay man as his running mate.
We already have 8 years of observing Joe Biden in the WH supporting Obama with grace and dignity. And we already have almost 4 years of cringing at your abhorrent behavior in the WH. At this point, 4 debates or 40 debates is not going to change the opinion of any cognizant person
My guess is Susan Rice. Biden has a long personal relationship with her.

Isn’t he up in polls again. Like Biden leading only 6 points?
Keep that same energy on BLM and Biden funding.
Good question. Has to be rebrand as an explicitly anti-Biden network but don't know if it would generate the same interest as a pro-Trump network.Constitution says the President's term ends in January. If he refuses to leave, Biden gets sworn in, and orders the Secret Service to escort him out.
You know it funny. I.n the last several months I’ve not seen hardly any Biden signs. This one way flying at the beach back in May. I drive around the county I live in and the same thing. 95% are Trump signs.
You talking about Biden?
The notion that voting for Biden is the only or preferred option to prevent Fascism is laughable.  "This society won't accept us. We form our own. The humans have played their hand. Now we get ready to play ours. Who's with me?"  -Magneto
Hey Biden, knock knock, who's there? Argo. Argo who? Argo fuck yourself we ain't wearing no mask!
Keeping telling us leftist to vote for Biden we will give Trump landslide just to shut you up.
You need to compromise and vote for Biden or else you are letting fascist Trump win so vote for the neoliberal hack.   "America's time has come. This country has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice. It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die."
They are Socialist Radical Liberal Dem’s now. 5 year old video’s &amp; both parties tear each other up on a campaign 2 lead their party. Wake up! They reunite. Look how Kamala ripped Biden up until he picked her as VP. Dog eat dog. I’d rather live in a Free country than a Commie!

I would say the clown who had to call out trump in a dog video is the snowflake.   You keep on being mad at the world!   Good luck with Biden ( the racist ) and Harris ( the person who called Biden a racist)
You want to lose money? Biden and Harris are for raising taxes through the roof... and the middle class will be paying them. Trump cut taxes for us.
Vote Marquita Bradshaw tho! Please surprise them thery know Biden numbers wont be high but the GOP would be stunned with even a competitive race. In atleast 5 points and now they have to split the purse in a solid RED state.

I think it's a massively huge mistake to have this election by mail!Trump is gonna drive his loyalist to violence when he doesn't win!If he doesn't find a way to cheat!We already know Russia is helping the criminal! When we get Biden elected U BETTER PROSECUTE TRUMP
I like what I read about her so far, and I might be voting for her too.  I am so sick of the 2 political party fight that does nothing for this Country but produce mean nasty and disrespectful citizens against one another.  Biden with Kamala is already swinging to fight.
You have to be blind and deaf not to see that Biden who had the chance to bring some possible peace between the Political Parties in finding a better peaceful respectful Candidate who is neutral, instead chose a VP who will continue the Division with nasty fights out here.
Why didn't God tell Biden to pick a better peaceful Candidate to be his VP, somebody who would have helped to unite this Country that desperately needs it.  Kamala is already swinging in directions that will not unite us.  A Sad shame for America.  I am Praying.
This s what bothers me a lot, it's the big division in this Country, thus my disappointment in Biden picking You Mrs. Kamala, because you will not be able to unite this Country, as you are already coming out the gate swinging.  I'm an Independent who is fed up with both sides.

Agreed...but realistically that’s what it is...give Biden a count by number puzzle to the side to look busy and keep from interrupting
The problem here, she keeps proclaiming herself as fully black for no good reason. Instead of just telling the truth, and then she could get them both Demographics she could need to building up her supporter base more.  And plus, she also criticized Biden in the primaries, so...

How did Joe Biden discriminate? Women have been so underrepresented in politics, especially in the executive branch.
The majority of the people who are voting for Joe Biden are not voting for Joe Biden. They are voting against President Trump. They are suffering from TDS.
You have been totally disrespected by the Democratic Party both at the debates and now at the convention. If the Biden team had any real sense they would have contacted you for the VP slot.
That is what I say. I am voting for Biden. We need #45 out of there.

Will DEM Biden-Harris gun confiscation start before mandatory mask rule?
your coverage of Biden's mask mandate misses the mark.  There is no Constitutional authority for a President to order such a thing.  None.  Nor for Congress to legislate it (unless it's a tax).
Let me guess, he wasn’t concerned about where she was born while serving in the US Congress. But now that she’s been named Biden running mate, you’re concerned about where she was born.🤦🏾‍♀️
That's a stupid statement. What makes you think it was The President that got us here? Did he created the virus? Trump has done more for this country in less than 4 years. What have you done, what has Joe done in so many years. God help us from having you or Biden in presidency.

If only that were true. Biden’s handlers chose Harris precisely because of her sexuality &amp; skin color. Doesn’t get more racist than that. They are both place holders.

I like the vibrant Biden, pumping away at a pretty good clip. Noble upstart, taking on the corporate behemoth.
of course there are many valid criticisms of Biden/Harris. I’m not THRILLED to vote for them either. But the indisputable fact remains that they would be the most progressive administration since at least FDR. suggesting there is any equivalence w Trump is absolutely mind numbing
Like...I LIKE BERNIE! I donated to his campaign!! I would much prefer him to Biden. I just don’t understand the segment of his base that refuses to even follow HIS LEAD. Like...y’all are “so progressive” you want trump to be re-elected?? Make it make sense y’all 😪

We have a criminal named Biden Trying to become President
She's clean and looks black will be Biden's description
It’s clear that with the DNC nomination of Biden and his choice of Harris that the Democratic party does not hear the cries of Americans against injustice. There is only one candidate advocating for and proposing real solutions to police and judicial issues in america. #VoteGold
Mr. Vice President Biden candidate for presidency please send him packing our of our glorious White House
How does Comrade Biden inappropriately touch Comrade Harris if zhe isn't in his dacha's basement?  And is the new Party dialectic that zhe now doesn't believe zis accusers?  Will CNN, MSNBC and the other Party agitprop organs announce that?
I imagine the Biden/Harris admintration would be more like a gaming pc upgrade. The same high-powered corruption but with a quieter fan.

Biden-Harris, Perseids, UEFA Champions League quarterfinals: 5 things to know Wednesday  via  #news
But do you need to know enough information on Biden’s platform to vote against Trump? At this point it’s making sure that Trump and his supporters who are in office don’t make it again because you can see how much hatred they’ve created alone.
y’all gon be pissed when biden come and ain’t shit changed except the racists ain’t as proud to be racist no more
Idc if Kamala is a Black woman. She’s not for the ppl. Joe Biden isn’t for the ppl. 45 &amp; his VP isn’t for the ppl. It’s 2016 all over again.....
Voting 🗳 Biden/Harris2020!!!
The only decision #Biden is qualified to make is the choice of applesauce or mashed peas for lunch.  He belongs in a nursing home, not the #WhiteHouse. #Trump2020
Tucker Carlson calls Biden-Harris the 'first entirely hollow presidential ticket in American history'
It's like the DNC/Biden wants Trump to win reelection.
I like Harris but this will not shore up the progressive wing of the party. Biden needed some one from the Mid-West and progressive. That way he shores up the far left and the swing states Hillary lost in 2016.
Who cares if Kamala thinks Biden is a racist? 1) She’s a liar so she’ll say anything, 2) We all already know that Joe is a racist because of his record, his words, and his actions.
Joe Biden loves praising racist even though he lied and said he never praised a racist before. He praised racist KKK Byrd
I actually like her. I am not a fan of Biden.
President Biden and VP Harris Reach for the stars And as mr.lewis say KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE PRIZE AND LET'S GO GET IN SOME GOOD TROUBLE NECESSARY TROUBLE
Biden is looking to change his ways. Trump is sticking to his guns and is about to drag us down with him
There’s nothing safe about Joe Biden and liberal policies. That’s what dems ran on in 2016 and lost. The policies are unpopular, while Bernie Sander’s message was about popular politics that could transcend party. But that would cost establishment dems their power
I will not vote for Biden/Harris Sam I Am I will not vote for them at a school  I will not vote for them at a pool I will not vote for them here or there  I will not vote for them anywhere. Don't tell me to vote blue no matter who Or I will beat you until you are black and blue.
We definitely need more independent thinkers like you and me! Biden will start visiting black churches; so that the black ministers can get their people in line! It’s like leading the lambs to slaughter! It is so unfortunate that people can’t see through this ruse and charade!😤
Lol we didn’t forget, waiting for the moment.  Now exposed!  Well done   your VP   family owned slaves.  Biden did not make this decision.  Shows the idiots working for him.   2020 🇺🇸1st!
Which is why I’m more interested in what the candidates’ platform/positions are NOW rather than what they were when Biden was in the senate in 1995 and Kamala was San Francisco DA in 2005. People change.  TL,DR there is an extremely obvious choice in 2020 and it’s Biden/Harris
nah i tweeted like people are rejoicing for kamala harris and joe biden being the presidential candidates lmao
the bottom line is that NO politician is perfect (not kamala, not Warren, not Bernie, DEF not Biden). Of course some are better than others, but who would you rather hold accountable in the White House? Donald Trump/Mike Pence or Joe Biden/Kamala Harris? It’s a VERY easy choice.
yes 100%!! it is definitely fair to criticize kamala. however, biden/harris is without a doubt better than trump/pence!! I keep seeing people saying that they’re voting third party or not voting at all bc of her which is so disappointing.
Yeah, but wall street funds the biden campaign no way they let warren close to any position inside the white house.
niggas was in the streets sayin we need less police and then say to vote for biden and harris like damn make up yo mind
PREACH!!! Biden Is trying to get the black vote; that is why he chose Kamala Harris! Biden and Harris have incarcerated more African-Americans than anyone else in this country!!! People need to wake up!!!😤😤😤
Y’all can’t convince me that Joe Biden didn’t fuck hisself. He fucked hisself with no Vaseline.
Y'all: Fuck the police. All cops are bad.   Also y'all: Yasss!  Joe Biden pick Kamala Harris. #BlackGirlMagic
Joe Biden just fucked hisself. We’re about to get another 4 years of Trump
Biden is a true puppet.

Biden, by picking Kamala is out to destroy America.
Two losers Biden/Harris 2020
Biden can't even pick his nose without the teleprompter telling him to
You're forgetting "nothing will fundamentally change"-Joe Biden
Nobody really wins in this election. Sure, Biden and Kamala Harris might be the sane option compared to Trump, but I don't expect much to change for the better. The status quo isn't going to change.  We wanted Bernie Sanders. We wanted a complete reconstruction of the system.
Warren had the highest percentage of supporters who were "blue no matter who.": 90 percent.

Harris isn't a very good actress. When she was blasting Biden in the debates, you could see the disdain in her eyes for that man. She didn't have that in her eyes for anybody else she was blasting.
joe biden sound like a communist sometimes lmfao
literally would only care if tulsi gabbard was biden’s vp which won’t happen so

Probably making a law where Biden can't have a VP.
Absolutely, Biden will make a great president.

Wow, and I won’t have to take classes. That’s amazing. I assume this means Trump is voting for Biden.
Unlike the current president, Joe Biden has defended the LDS faith multiple times, particularly in response to the same anti-LDS talking points we often hear from, oops, conservative Evangelicals.
Trump likes her as Biden's VP.
She legit hates Biden. Biden feels the same way after she nearly sank his bid in the debates. It's poetic that she will probably be Biden's VP. Trump will just run what she said about Biden in his ads.
To bad, Biden will not be president.
And the Biden campaign has been doing consistent, ongoing outreach to Latter-day Saints in the grassroots. The earliest &amp; most robust ever from a recent Democratic presidential campaign.
Exactly, that's what needs to be done, ask him for names, and corroborate his lies. I strongly believe that Trump has been holding the stupid/non-sense/ no-message-at-all press conferences to try to steal the thunder from Biden’s announcement of his VP... he’s desperate!!

Get the scales off your eyes. Both of these candidates are a pure shit show and u know it. To say biden is better than trump shows u have fallen victim to the propaganda

I don't think Biden wants that. He will get destroyed in a debate.

Just like Obama if Biden wins he will cut the military and military service members will be let go.
Biden Criticized Trump’s Order Cutting Payroll Tax. During The Recession, Obama Said It Would Be ‘Inexcusable’ To Block A Similar Tax Cut
Race or color should not be a factor or consideration in making employment decisions except in appropriate circumstances as set forth at Section 15-VI-C of the Compliance Manual section on Race and Color Discrimination. Black male leaders warn Biden.

But the headline writers make it seem like Joe Biden—a man who has defended the faith of Latter-day Saints numerous times—is doing the polarizing, rather than the reactionaries.

Biden is too supportive of Antifa to contrast obviously with Trump as a champion of legitimate democracy. Four years ago I would have agreed with this, but put it nicer.  Now it just doesn't hold up well.
You're getting feisty b/c you are threatened by the truth. And the truth is Biden failed to tell the truth about violence when it counted. And no one truly knows his real stance on defunding.
I bet they won’t pocket campaign funds like Trump though. Good job Biden/Harris. Maybe they can keep spending in Texas and Ohio? #BidenHarris2020Landslide
I don't think you have engaged with me in an honest and serious way.  I think Biden shows serious weakness as "return-to-normal" candidate and does a poor job contrasting with even Trump's poor example.
Also, Biden has not been consistent on police funding.  He said he is against defunding.  He also said he is for "redirecting" some police funding into mental health and other services. Kinda sounds like a euphemistic way to say "defunding".
Carrying water to this degree for Antifa when the MSM was covering up violence amounts to (effectively) supporting Antifa, as I said.  This doesn't count?  Fine, then Trump's bad statements don't either. It's about being clean enough to contrast with Trump, and Biden isn't.
Where do you get this garbage from? Trump is the guy who holds all the time not Mr Biden. Despite what you may have learned from Donny... making shit up doesn’t actually make it true.
Relax. This exchange was this afternoon for Pete's sake. I am looking for video/transcript, but I only find articles about it. Multiple lies/distortions here by Biden at a time when MSM was still lying about "peaceful protest".

I believed this before Biden supported Antifa (effectively). Now I’m not sure this reason flies. I’m not saying you NEED a reason to vote Biden beyond liking him. But if he doesn’t get his way, he’ll sic his violent mob again, which I THOUGHT was the whole issue with Trump.

If Biden loses it’ll be because people see two different clowns as P &amp; VP come November. Different clowns but nonetheless still clowns.

Whatever you say CW.  Should I assume that since you support Biden, you enjoy sniffing little girls hair?  If you don't agree with CW, you ain't black?  Keep painting with your broad brush.
This article is so irresponsible. Trump is dangerous and mentally unfit, and there is no one that Biden could pick as his VP that would in any way shape or form justify not voting for him over Trump.
The left uses every trick in the book to keep Biden off that stage with Trump! They come up with every lie and excuse to keep him away from Trump!  Biden is mentally impaired...America isn't fooled! Biden smells of fear!
Just wait until after the first debate when he must face Trump. Biden's poll numbers will sink like the Titanic.
Imagine we pay for flying this creature everywhere,  hi auto, his advance team, his secret service team, the 2 other planes w nuclear codes and backup. All to hear him say Biden is hurting God. You racist MF that still support this evil abomination. God bless your hearts
Trump will absolutely destroy Biden in debates prior to elections and that will significantly change the forecast.
Is he talking about Biden or John Lennon?  Either way count me in.
C'mon Eric... why drag  and  on this?  is getting sh-tcanned for 'Darling  (&lt;-- see what I did there?) once Biden announces his VP candidate. And Kayleigh will 3 or 4 Press Secretaries in the past and writing her memoir by then....
Biden: Blacks all think the same way
"I support BLM. I support the removal of the statue of liberty, it represents racism and oppression. If elected president on day 1 I will sign legislation for its immediate removal." Joe Biden     Think about that America, vets.Did I miss a meeting?  Democrats, Socialists, and Communists are all different things still, right?  Seriously folks, if you can't spot the difference between Joe Biden and Joe Stalin, I don't think I'm obligated to take ANY of your opinions seriously

How can Hillary help Biden and America? Buy Biden a condo in Arizona
DNC secretly  schedules Joe Biden Cognition test in his basement
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Two months ago, Joe Biden told thousands of African Americans the “you ain’t Black if you vote for Trump”
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Appropriately called the Harris-Biden ticket! 🤔🙄
I guess Biden isn’t a racist or part of the problem all of a sudden anymore.

Biden and Harris stance on PROABORTION needs to be exposed,  since this is a great evil.
How could I have missed the endorsement of Joe Biden by the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP)? I heard David Duke’s ringing endorsement of Trump in 2020. He even wants Tucker Carlson to be his running mate.
I’ve noticed everyone jabbing at Obama on where he was born and from and throwing some heymakers at Biden’s VP . But as soon and you throw that combo at them and ask them about Trump past and who he’s married to the so call Patriotic people be like “ well that’s the past”
If Biden doesn't Debate Soon I will sit this election out. Bernie was ready before he was cheated again.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
Biden Linked DOD Official Calls for Alex Jones' Death!
BIDEN WAS THREATENED INTO PICKING HARRIS: “HE BETTER PICK A BLACK WOMAN”
Jim Clyburn just said it well- “the road to the left or right always goes through the center.” If Biden/Harris is too “centrist” for you, think of it as a bridge to more progressive policy. There is no comparison between candidates in this election.
Why? I doubt it will influence any policy positions the Biden administration will take.
Is this because you know Biden is not competent enough to get through a debate and therefore cannot be President???
Notice how none of the democrats are trying to disprove that Biden is racist 🧐 crazy huh?
Had to re-read that. Thought you said Kamala would blow Biden.
In other words, there's no chance Biden wins.
I also saw that Biden will perform his own music........
Biden picked a cop....in the middle of the war on cops.
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Racism - Does it bother you that Biden's VP pick will be chosen by "skin color &amp; gender" instead of character!?!
Joe Biden is a pushover which is why Ping and Putin want him to win. Obiden is afraid to debate Trump..Retweet
Tell us how you really feel Joe Biden!  via
You’re so full of shit and this country would be better off if you had nothing to do with it. You should be ashamed and I bet you’re family is ashamed of you every time you open your mouth ,  You sound like Joe Biden when you talk and you Democrats are idiots.

Advice to Joe Biden. Act just like Jesus did when the Roman authorities questioned his faith and who he was. He didn’t utter a word! He knew the truth! The greatest speech in the Bible. #iwillvote
2 things that probably will not happen this year: Antifa invading Sturgis Rally, and Biden showing up to debate Trump. Why? Because they have yellow paint on their backs
Russia, if anything, like China, supports the new Communist left Democrat party, NOT, the Republicans. You have to be very naive to believe Russia supports Trump, no they support Biden. Just more Democrat party propaganda
Not only does Joe Biden have a. Very sordid past. Ethics and sexual misconduct, but he does not have the wherewithal to  comprehend what is happening globally, much less in our own country. He is unable to effectively communicate any relevant facts. Retire Joe
whats Biden gonna say when Trump asks him a question? C'mon man?  Haha lol
joe biden said Islam should be taught in public schools....been to great  britain?
Joe biden said Islam should be taught in public schools
Joe Biden said Islam should be taught in public scheels.... this proves he is not a Christian
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
Ok. They would probably vote for those who helped them gain freedoms. Sen Joe Biden/Pres Clinton’s 1994 Crime Bill that probably got them to prison, or  First Step Act 🤔
OFFS. Biden could pick a paper bag for VP and his administration would still be INFINITELY better than Trump nation. Don’t look for excuses. It’s inexcusable.
The Definition of Racism..  Picking someone for a job Base on Skin Color.    Biden wants a Black Woman as VP??
Idk what Biden or the democrats have done for Blacks in general but I do know that they havent done anything for me 🤣 I don't plan on voting ever again. Politicians dont give a dayum about people like me.
Watching User Clip: Joe Biden says he wrote the PATRIOT Act
How many Racist are in the Democrat Party?? Look twice at everyone who defends (Old Jim Crow) Joe Biden.
The man committed the crime in 1997. What happened in 1994? Wasnt there a crime bill written by Sen Joe Biden and signed Pres Bill Clinton? Didn’t that bill have provisions for longer and tougher sentences for repeat offenders rather than rehabilitation?

Oh just ridiculous. Can’t wait to see Biden own Trump reciting Bible verses.
