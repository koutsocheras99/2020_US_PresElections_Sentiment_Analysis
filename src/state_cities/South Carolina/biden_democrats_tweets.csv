I'm voting for Biden no matter who he picks. I trust him to make the right choice.
No Biden signs in my heavily Democrat part of Columbia, SC. But, no Republican dare put a Trump sign out, either.
Why Presidential candidate Joe Biden is not denouncing this type of attacks on the police, rioters, shooting, burning, looting, etc! WHY??? And he‚Äôs running for president! I‚Äôll be voting four more years! TRUMP LANDSLIDE 2020
But practically speaking Biden is going to need a Dem Senate to get judges appointed in this environment, I think. We‚Äôll see. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Maybe Mitch would show some moderation.
One problem with this is the court. If Biden wins, and Senate remains R, McConnell can just refuse to bring any candidates to the Senate floor. And I sure as hell am not voting for Lindsey Graham. If it were a GOP House and Dem senate/Pres then maybe I‚Äôd be ok with that.
You go Joe this Republicans Ridin with Biden

Biden becoming President
According to this story, Ed Rendell's dream ticket this year was a Biden-Klobuchar ticket because they would appeal to white voters.
Blacks overwhelming back Biden. As they should.
My guess is they need someone on the record because they can't write an article with just anonymous quotes. And this guy, who is obviously very far from Biden's inner orbit, is someone they know they can get a quote from.
WHO are these idiots running about creating public division about Karen Bass and Kamala Harris? Keep that shyte silent. We don't have to know how Biden is picking his VP.
Tbf though Clyburn is clearly much more loyal and did way more to help Biden win the primary. Kamala is acting like she's just owed this shit.
Would be hilarious if Biden appoints him head of the CIA
Oh honey. Keep beating the Hunter Biden angle. Precisely NO voters even care.
And impeaching Trump now is the best hope the GOP has of winning in November, since Biden has no response to an opponent who is also "anyone but Trump".
If so, people know a fake Biden.
Biden struggled to find the right words to say his whole career. He stutters. Trump has always been well spoken. His decline verbally is dramatic, just over the last couple of years.
The Democrats aren't going to impeach because their whole election campaign is based on Biden not being Trump. They've got nothing if he's running against Pence and a GOP claiming it's returning to normal.

Okay, u NEED to publicly apologize to Biden.
There's 0 chances of Trump winning 2020, even if Joe Biden runs out of his basement Naked!
For those that need to hear this: rich old white men should NEVER stand up and tell anyone how Black men should do (or have done) their fighting for civil rights. If Bill could shut up and sit down next to Biden, that would be great.
So the Biden campaign expects there will be a Democratic primary in 2024? Even Biden's own campaign thinks he will lose the election in 2020 or the country before 2024?!
I'm with you! Just call me and I'll be there!! If you want bells on my toes I'll put them bells on my toes! I'll do anything to get him the hell out of there! I'll even help disinfect the White House for Joe Biden! You know there will be some bugs left behind! The electronic kind
Love the idea that even if Biden wins 50 states and Trump concedes we'll still have like 3 months of lame duck where he'll absolutely just shoot RBG in the face and name Eric to the supreme court.
Either of the first 2 are fine. Harris went hard at Biden over bussing not sure if he will hold it against her.

FLASHBACK: Conservatives attacked Joe Biden for predicting Trump would try to delay the 2020 election
Biden can‚Äôt remember who he is, where he is, what‚Äôs he doing, or who the folks are around him.
He wants us to delay until it is safe 2 vote in person! That could be three years from now, I guess he figures he could get his second term that way! He's trying his best to figure away to be a two-term president! He knows he can't defeat Biden!! So he has to find a way!
Hindsight, maybe this has been the democrat‚Äôs strategy to get rid of trump by scaring people of a virus with 99% survival, force mail in ballots, cheat and remove trump. I‚Äôm not a trump or biden fan and not voting, but it‚Äôs a thought.
Last night watching Hulu I saw the same anti-Biden add probably 30 times.

Curious how the male/female cross tabs look compared for Biden compared to Clinton, particularly for whites.
I never said Biden wasn‚Äôt also a pedo. The truth of the matter is both choices from the two party system. So rather than vote for one of them remove your support and vote third party. #votinggold
The Biden campaign's going up with ads on the airwaves in two Ohio cities: Toledo and Youngstown. In addition to advertising in Ohio, the Toledo media market bleeds over into Michigan. I think Youngstown may into Pennsylvania?
Frankly, anyone in the running to be Biden's Veep is thinking they'll be President by Christmas of next year.
If Trump has to step down suddenly for, let's say, health reasons and Biden's up against  Pence + Nikki Haley campaigning on a post-Trump reset of traditional Republican values like family, faith and opportunity for all, what is the Democrat's message?  Seriously. What then?

Yeah. Kinda like spinning lies that Biden will cause unrest that is already happening when you're president.
Hey Shannon! Just curious if you have seen the violent riots? Even Joe Biden is claiming it is a peaceful protest, but it is far from it. Not one MSM is calling him out on it either. You seem like someone who wants to know the truth but there are millions that just listen to Joe.

What happens if, or when, Trump and Barr don't agree with the Election? Trump brings his Stormtroopers to the White House, and elsewhere, with Barr sanctioning it's legality.  Is Biden willing to call in the military to take back our country? I know people don't believe this!

Not supporting Trump is a good look but your endorsement for Biden just cost you your seat here in SC. You should really learn to keep your mouth shut.

Every single one of those prescriptions are half-measures. If they're good ideas, they should be much, much bolder. (Remember how Obama and Biden always started off meeting the GOP more than half way and negotiated from there? That went well.) And no Medicare for All, so GTFO

Biden has a long career as senator and vice president. He spent eight years as the next in line to run the country I think most reasonable observers feel far safer with him then a guy who is shown he can‚Äôt even read an intelligence report nor does he care to.
15th straight week with  at #1 in these rankings.
My advice to Biden has been the same all along - say nothing, do nothing. Let the voting public focus 100% on Trump and decide if they real want four more years of this shit show
If that's the case, then Biden can't do any harm  It sounds like something you can blame Trump for. He IS the president right now.

So a term ends on Jan 20, and with no result, House picks POTUS, Senate picks VPOTUS. Wouldn't it be the disfunction that our system has become to have Biden as POTUS and Trump as VPOTUS? I mean, 2021 might tell 2020 to hold its beer!
The GOP in Washington is a disgrace. Not a fan but where do I turn to? The DEMS are so far left now. Biden is losing his mind - literally (sad to see actually). Republicans are cowards. WTF dude. As of right now, the GOP will lose the Senate and WH. #SOS
EVERYTHING that you have done will be ERASED as soon as Biden gets in office. Your memory will just be an orange greasy stain on America.
Delaying the election is a stupid idea. You're roughly 90 days from election and your focus is this? Come on. Focus on recovery, preserving the Constitution, Biden's policies and the impact of those policies, defending civil liberties. If not, DEMS will control.

Executive summary: "Biden is in good shape."
Better lawyer up. If you thought Bush v. Gore was ugly, Supreme Court ruling in Biden v. Trump is going to make that look like child's play. Having said that, Constitution firmly ends one term by Jan 20. If no clear winner, House picks POTUS, Senate picks VPOTUS. #Election2020

We may see a depressed vote vs a suppressed vote. No matter what we are voting but our children think Biden is ‚Äúbasically a republican‚Äù. I‚Äôm hoping the spirit of John Lewis will inspire people to vote
The progressive side of the Dem base.  We also talk  to friends and family in other states and we understand the dilemma seems to be Biden appealing to moderates or progressives, if he doesn‚Äôt pick a progressive the vote may be about voter enthusiasm.
We‚Äôre in S Carolina, more than likely an electoral vote for red.  Voting is still very important to us, but I hear so many people say if it‚Äôs Harris they won‚Äôt vote.  All we can say is (Do you want 4 more years), but that doesn‚Äôt work every time.   Biden/Harris

In a perfect would it would be neither Trump or Biden but this is where we‚Äôre at. Faults aside, at least Biden has been in office for years and knows the ins and outs of politics and wouldn‚Äôt completely embarass us (hopefully) on the world stage.
I am, Joe Biden does not have my support in any way haha
I don‚Äôt regret a thing I‚Äôve said about Joe Biden or Big Tech today. I meant all of it and won‚Äôt back down from it.
Biden is by no means perfect. Far far from it. They‚Äôre BOTH mentally unwell. It‚Äôs sad that our two choices are senile old men with histories of sexual assault. But I would take Biden over Trump. Purely because I want somebody back in office that actually knows what they‚Äôre doing.
Stable genius this one. He has the balls to say Biden has trouble? Wow.

Susan Rice, Biden, Harris, etc.. care nothing about any of us as veterans. Don't fall for this bullshit.  They didn't care when the last administration did it. They killed american citizens without due process as young as 16 with drones.  Nobody cared.  Now they suddenly do?
I'm saying Dems do nothing but use victims, veterans, black people, brown people, etc. but exploit them for power  You all suddenly care about the troops over Pentagon uncorroborated Russia stories? Dems voted to extend the war.  You did nothing when Obama and Biden allowed this.
Susan Rice was part of the Obama/Biden administration while Iran had bounties on US troops in Afghanistan.  I was one of them.   They rewarded Iran with a nuclear program instead.

I gotta say if Joe Biden is picking a female vice president his main vettors should be women! Leaning on Chris Dodd keeps and protects the old pattern of male gatekeepers. Women would understand and see strength where Dodd sees trouble.

Zuckerburg working with Trump in collusion to ban Biden ads ! A good president would have said "I welcome the competition", see who wins, but frighteningly you should be AFRAID, trump said he won't concede if he loses! That's terrifying as he's deranged enough to start WWWIII!
Biden has already said he's looking at one term. I wouldn't be surprised if towards the end of the term he flips it to the VP. That's also probably a big reason why it's taking so long: Harris flamed out pretty early during the primaries.
He must have forgotten he has DEMENTIA!!
Biden's big thing apparently is finding someone he agrees with on most issues. Not sure if Duckworth is like that, but I agree with you.

Please   Stop Blame &amp; The lies about  &amp;  are not Helping Unemployed US Citizens &amp; US People,#1 Biden is not The POTUS &amp;  &amp; Trump can't get it together, can't pass their own COVID19 Stimulus Bill!
Larry Elder: Joe Biden's repeated lies on race should serve as a warning to voters.    #Biden2020
You won‚Äôt become president. This is all a Dream sleepy Biden. Go back to sleepy sleepüò¥üò¥üò¥
Five months into this pandemic and it‚Äôs not safe to send children back to school. I am having to homeschool my child this year due to Trump‚Äôs catastrophic handling of Coronavirus. Moms for Biden sounds pretty damn good to me!
why do we pretend that trump and biden are writing their own tweets
Biden is a George Wallace Democrat. That was my thought of the day.
you are an evil person! Hell you want the truth the DNC probably released the virus on these GOP members after Biden got some samples from his Chinese buddies!
Scientists said April was most likely when Jesus was born but I‚Äôd prefer January 25th because of the stolen Election Kathrine Harris, Jeb Bush did on Al Gore. Biden‚Äôs people will try via mail in ballots sent to peoples pets.   BEST reason, better chance to have a White Christmas!
You absolutely failed us.. you did absolutely nothing for black folks.. It was a lot of killings on your watch and you could've set the precedent by actually punishing cops.. You just as bad as Biden and Trump.. And to think I actually voted for you
There are witness statements saying that the call memo released was accurate and provided a full recounting of the conversation. And nothing about it was incriminating. Trump didn't ask for something to smear Biden with and he didn't condition aid on anything.
Given Biden's racist past, why did Obama pick him as VP?   Was it he knew he was a worthless politician whose silence could be bought for pennies on the bigger deals?
And while citizens have varying levels of critical thought, the conservative pundits can and will use this as leverage against Biden and co if they can make it look like they‚Äôre winning him votes. The director of the ‚ÄúRepublicans Against Trump‚Äù PAC admitted to this on interview.
Where was Biden and Trump. Shameful
Go back to sleep Biden. Go back to sleepüò¥üò¥üò¥
I'm thinking the whole Kamala Harris thing is a head fake and then he nominates Hillary Clinton who would never accept VP accept she knows he won't be in office long. Whoever Biden nominates will likely become president and fairly soon.
Then don‚Äôt try to do anything illegal and keep Russia out of it. Can‚Äôt wait to celebrate Biden‚Äôs huge victory. #NoMoreTrump
Whoever Biden picks as his VP, that VP pick should also have a VP pick of their own for when Biden dies, resigns or the 25th Amendment is applied because one of those 3 will happen
U believe cuz the Left leadership has controlled media since the printing press.Dems, such as Obama and Biden supported  KKKs -- both eulogized a prominent KKK. Right wings actually supported desegregation. Check out Antoine Tucker.
Good piece on that subject by  in The  today-
#WeWillVote to get the racist in chief out of office. #WeWillVote to save America #WeWillVote to stop trump's corruption #WeWillVote to elect Biden #WeWillVote to oust #PutinsPuppet  #WeWillVote to take back the Senate
Usually instead of wanting ‚Äútruth‚Äù as joe Biden has said we follow the facts.
Yes, that lady married her brother. Did some other strange stuff. Makes perfect sense she has a crush on Biden.
Dont quote me, but Joe Biden might have said today we had 400 million Americans die of COVID.  Good news? No more covid concerns in the USA. Bad news...the US population would now be (-) 40million people.
....Getting at the root of the problems that have been simmering and building up for decades. For example, Biden actually went there, he said he condemned the kidnappings by the feds, because he wanted the local police to do that job, as I understand his position....
When‚Äôs Joe Biden gonna announce Beyonc√© as his running mate
Biden Harris Ticket should be interesting ü§î
Kamala Harris VP...10000%. Biden needs someone like her. 2nd choice has to be E Warren.
Lol. Yeah. Watching all of these Biden people try to call the manager on Trump is going to be well, it‚Äôs not funny, but it kind of is, but it‚Äôs not.
I love all these great ‚Äúlist to follow‚Äù posts. Except when two on the list have you blocked. #WheresTheLove
if lliberals say all trump votes are racist does that make all biden voters a pedophile???? or segregationist?
Don't see the debates being much of a decision factor. People who like to see Trump's baseless attacks will have already been in his camp. People who already excuse Biden's incoherent rambling won't be deterred by more of it.
If Biden raped my family member and we file a police report, would he be presented as a womans rights defender by the Main Stream media?
Demings is exactly who Biden should pick. Would be strategically smart. Harris would be a poor choice IMO.
Are you on drugs or something. You don't have the power to delay the election. You know that Biden is kicking your sorry ass in the polling. I will be voting on election day no matter what. I will not let you destroy our country anymore.
You probably thought Obama was a great president. Well, he was in power during the WORST economy since the depression. Trump has overseen the greatest economic recovery in our history. Our economy will recover stronger than ever if he is re-elected. IF Biden wins, it‚Äôs the dumps!
Yes! NOTHING will stop me from casting my vote for Biden.  #RidinWithBiden
I‚Äôd rather Biden spend today talking to families about the economy failing. That‚Äôs the story today that will actually move votes‚Äînot Trump‚Äôs tantrum.
Just out of curiosity, what exactly do you feel President Trump isn‚Äôt doing? And what do you think Biden would be doing differently? Biden surely isn‚Äôt doing anything now except criticize. ‚ÄúLeadership‚Äù is a very broad term.
Biden walking.  Scandalous ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Maybe he can go the way of John Mitchell? If we make it out of this mess through the election of Biden; he can AND WILL be the target of someone's investigation. I must believe thousands of civil servants are still at DOJ who despise him and would love to do their jobs again.
Gee, I wonder whether a President like Biden, not believing in the free market, would try such a thing. You betcha!
As long as its done by ‚Äúlocal cops‚Äù (and not the Feds), Biden condones it, per my understanding. He only condemned Federal action. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.
Trump will drop out so Biden can lose to Mitt Romney.
for #POTUS. Just let Biden stay in his basement, and parachute Anand in to do the real job.
If Biden is elected, you won't have a job anymore!
That is the Truth!
Half of the states never got the chance to vote, and any possible contenders dropped before the race had really started just to give Biden a boost. Joe had nothing in the first few states, then he won South Carolina and everybody started acting like he was a shoe-in.
Stay there and resign. Biden has got this. #Biden2020
Well....yeah. Whoever is VP will become President. Biden isn't finishing as POTUS. No way.
Haha I can do you one better...Jumping Joe Biden in charge of the worlds biggest nuclear arsenal üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Bonus: Biden will give us Law, Order, AND Justice.
IF (and that's a HUGE IF) Biden were to get elected, YOU KNOW the deal is going to be cut from tbe start that he will step down as POTUS within a year, and elevate whomever the DNC chooses as his running mate.  Including Kamala (flat on my back) Harris.
And if Biden gets elected they'll make us even more miserable.
So your take is that Trump will be better than actively working to keep Biden moving on progressive policies. Ok. It's certainly less work that participating.
The OP is a political reporter. He's not the boss of the Democratic Party.   Again, every single person Biden is looking at is ambitious and ready to be President. This in no way implies that the primaries are canceled and we have to just accept whoever that is.
Is this why folks are so over-excited?   No, Joe Biden doesn't get to pick who gets the Democratic nomination next. That is not a power he has and I suspect that it's not a power he wants.
Every single woman on Biden's shortlist is ambitious! Is this their way of saying only a man can be VP, because while laudatory in a man, ambition is disqualifying in a woman?
That's always been the case, though. Suddenly finding it offensive when the potential VP is a woman is just gross.  Every single person on the VP shortlist is ambitious and a woman. Guess Biden's going to have to pick a man, since ambition in a woman is disqualifying.
But I do agree with you that the way the story is being molded into a fight between two fan bases is gross. It's not like Biden is going to be pouring over tweets and the right slur against Warren or Harris will get him to pick the other.
Biden certainly has crashed and burned when he ran. That you think this is only disqualifying for a woman is interesting.
If Biden's VP pick is your excuse to sit home on election day, you were never going to vote for him.
Really? So Biden's previous unsuccessful attempts to win the nomination don't stop you from supporting him, but it's inexcusable in a woman candidate? Ok.
Warren is just as ambitious so if you're looking to dismiss Harris with this misogynistic nonsense, you're dismissing every single woman Biden is considering for VP.
Let‚Äôs not forget that Joe Biden was very serious about selecting Amy Klobuchar as vice president. If George Floyd had not happened, I‚Äôm pretty sure he would have. And the only reason he changed his mind, was because of optics. It‚Äôs not like he had some kind of change of heart...
I still vote for  if he pick a Rock for VP!
Yes, there‚Äôs no chance of SC going to Biden but I‚Äôll vote for him anyway!
They must keep Biden hidden lest someone take a picture of the outline of his diaper underneath his pants.
amen. they dont even think biden is a good candidate, they just hate trump so much that they dont give a shit.
I‚Äôve been all over South Carolina and Georgia and have seen 1 Biden sign and it was in Helen, GA.
I fail to see how Biden is a too far left candidate?
Biden photographed with Kamala Harris talking points as running mate speculation grows
Why not just support #UBI ? Because Biden comes from a paternalistic tradition of HIM being the one who decides (very narrowly defined) who ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù a benefit and for what it can be used....  he doesn‚Äôt actually trust the people to make those decisions for themselves.
You‚Äôll  NEVER see/hear this reported on MSM!! Why, because they, the MSM &amp; willing partners in the Democratic Party, want to stifle the truth until after the election. If Biden wins, this pandemic will magically disappear from the MSM! Misinformation IS INDOCTRINATION!!!!
Biden's notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris
"I'm Joe "aim for their legs" Biden and I promise that under my administration protesters will only ever be disappeared into marked vans and that's a fact, jack"
i just dont  understand how people from the left dont see the hypocrisy, they dont see this destruction of americsas a riot, dont see anything wrong with biden but call trump incompetent. the time where wrong is right and truth and facts are covered for lies, is among us.
330 million people...the best we can do is Trump and Biden?
Hey   can keep attacking Democrats &amp; Biden with your lies &amp; Kiss Your Liar Corrupt Racist Criminal US Traitor &amp; Putin's Puppet  A$$ with more lies everyday and they still lies &amp; He still can't be re-elect POTUS on Nov 2020 with Your lies!

I really hope Biden picks Karen Bass  for VP.
There is no way that Biden would‚Äôve made it through the question and answer session without his Teleprompter. He looks like a doofus, and he whines like one too.
I also noticed Biden looking at notes he had down in front of him.
So there is no violence and destruction in any city threatening any federal facilities, joe Biden actually never said he was running for a senate seat when he visited SC and we should use feathers to defend public buildings against thugs. Humm you blind?
Joe Biden has an excellent list for a VP choice and I'll vote for him whoever he chooses. It's not rocket science. #RidinWithBiden  #Biden2020 #TeamJoe #WeWantJoe
Biden rarely takes questions and when he does he has a list he pulls out and calls in order.  Something is very seriously wrong with him.
Biden if elected will go down as the whiniest president ever. His voice is weak and whiney.
Please put Joe Biden in Sunnyside Acres.
Please put Joe Biden back in his basement, he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening.
Yes Joe Biden, President Trump cancelled Tallahassee üòÇ
Which is why the VP is going to be the deciding factor in Biden becoming President
Joe Biden you have done nothing, ever

At that time, the Voting Rights Act required the state to pre-clear any redistricting plan, a provision that was struck down by conservatives on the Supreme Court in 2013. And so it was that on June 5, 1985, Biden found himself pressing the nominee about that case.

This is pissing me off.  is using  ‚Äòs ideas. Biden regularly seeks advice from Warren. Warren will guide our country to recovery. Name Warren VP already!!
Yeah but with the on-going population decline in rural MN vs. increase in Minneapolis/St. Paul, George Floyd/BLM Movement &amp; general Biden gains across the country this feels off.  Anecdotally, I was up there this past week &amp; it didn't feel like Trump had a presence comparatively.

BULLCRAP, JOE. I do a number #1 in its demo talk radio show in the middle of a red state with a mostly male audience. Men don't have to listen, but they do. It's not 1972 anymore, Joe. Perhaps getting out of the basement more would help?
South Carolina for Biden!
This is showing signs of election interference. How could you repeat obsessively that Trump is loosing? Where does the data come from? Very questionable polls?   And why the topic of either winning?  Why is Biden still running? He is almost comatose. Can my turtle run?
There is passion and excitement for President Trump.  I‚Äôm not seeing that for Biden

If you want to debate who Biden should pick based on policy reasons, fine.  Otherwise, bye.  (P.S. I'm still probably gonna side with Kamala.)
I am so tired of this one debate moment serving as every Democratic donor's (with a reporter's number) idiotic justification for not picking Kamala for VP.
any level of intellectual honesty on this subject will condem Clinton, Biden, Obama, and will celebrate Trump &amp; Rand Paul. Not sure LBJ has what it takes?
We must come together to support whoever Biden selects. Stay focused on voting Trump out.
No really...... THIS is the leader of the free world you want? Tax me at god damn 99.9999% of my wages and I‚Äôd still vote for Biden.
This isn't what the article is about. It's about whether execs who donate to Trump or Biden should keep their jobs.   Why do we get outraged about articles we don't even bother to read? It's not like there isn't plenty to get excited about happening, we don't need to invent stuff
The article states that this is about donating to Trump or Biden, not voting. I don't understand why we insist on disingenuous framing when the truth is worth discussing.
The Biden reference was merely ancillary to illustrate a larger. Not sure if you have basic comprehension, but Biden isn't the subject, he's merely a reference to illustrate my point. Put a dunce cap on already.

Nope. Not this year. The establishment is what I'm pushing back against. The Biden slugs &amp; radicals and Never Trumper pro-big government pro-Biden Rinos who think furthering establishment politics is more important than stomping commie pinkos. That's who I'm dissing with my vote.

That's assuming there is a debate.  We are 100 days out of pushing the button for the re-election of our President. Or, the election that is the beginning of the end of America as we know it, and want it.  Biden will NOT debate Trump. Look for an "October surprise" nominee.
Did anyone else hear Susan Rice say on TV in an interview that Biden had not approached her for VP &amp; she has not been vetted? Maybe Face the Nation....I keep seeing tweets about her being in the running???

20,000 lies on Twitter. I can't believe Biden is getting away with it.  Oh wait, that was Crazy lil donny trump
There is an abundance of wealth to pick from. Susan Rice would be great, Elizabeth Warren would be fantastic, etc. I like Harris on that ticket. She is less progressive than Warren but more progressive than Biden and can be a bridge between the two.

You seem worried. All you have to do when VP Biden kicks your sorry ass in November, is to run to Putin.
Get real people. Both asses are no good for America. Don‚Äôt act like removing Trump is the answer. Biden and Dems want to be Marxist and Socialist. That‚Äôs not good for us either. There MUST be a better way!
We don't exist to them outside of pawns in their money/power games. We are disposable to both side. Human Capital Stock.  I see so many people acting like Biden is going to be the Savior of the USA, when really, what he is, is the only other choice that isn't a psychopath,
I know that we need to get rid of the toxic monsters that are there now, but I am absolutely sure we're being herded in to this choice that isn't a choice at all.  Biden's slogan might as well be Vote for me or we'll leave this insane narcissist and his family in charge to

Don't lose faith! The alternative is BIDEN!! You really want that confused old man with his socialist policies in the whitehouse?? He will give a ton of jobs back to China!
And let me remind you when Trump Closed the Borders Biden said it was Rasist and if he haven't done it more people would have cought the virus and died

Hi Sarah. I am voting for Biden but I feel that Kamala Harris SHOULD NOT be the VP pick. As AG of California, she allowed Steven Mnuchin to get a free pass after committing atrocious financial crimes in CA. Mnuchin had given Kamala a lot of financial support in her campaign. üò°

I would argue the Trump-Biden horse race line isn‚Äôt even the worst nugget in that poll. Check out the full poll and see how DeSantis is doing in it‚Äîmuch worse.
Especially because to get there, Biden will have already taken a couple other Trump 2016 states.

Joe Biden needs a VP that‚Äôs ready and capable day one of being president.

Is it just coincidence that Biden tells his staff not to trade right before Trump strikes this huge Kodak deal? Is there the possibility that Trump or his people profited greatly from this and Joe plans to use it against him?
Great.  I was in Dallas two weeks ago and saw 2 Biden yard signs in my mother‚Äôs neighborhood.  I saw 2 Trump signs, as well, but Dallas County has become blue since I left in 1994.  Need to turn it red this fall.   I also saw Hillary signs in the ultra wealthy Park Cities in 1996

That's the dumbest thing that I have ever heard. Everytime Biden speaks out of script he makes an ass out of himself.
This is Trump's America, not Biden's. Biden believes of the people, by the people, and for the people. The people are supposed to be in charge of the government, not the government in charge of the people. That's called democracy, Dumpling Donny.They haven't listened to a word he's said since April. E, cept, maybe, to make sure he's staying on the pro-Biden message. They'll still lie and say Biden got less votes and it was Bernie's fault though.
I think there is this fear of being put in the history books as an enabler for Trump's fascism if Biden loses. He has seen the news for the last four years that has blamed him, and if it happens again, whether deserved or not, he's internalized it.

That is a brilliant objective piece in POLITICO about Biden‚Äôs search for VP  candidate. Senator Harris is by far the most logical choice.   Democrats don‚Äôt snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by picking someone else   #2020Election
Biden is afraid...
Joe Biden is a Statesman.
Please don‚Äôt beat Biden off...that would be...strange.
No if you want Biden to win, the enthusiasm should be the select an Arican American woman.  This is the group that is most responsible for him being the Democratic nominee. This would generate excitement in the electorate
For those of us who want Biden to win, the choice can only be Harris or Abrams. Remember the voters who stayed home in 2016, most were black people who were turned off by Clinton being the ‚Äú same old same old‚ÄùI‚Äôm voting for Joe. It‚Äôs either Biden or Trump. That‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt understand folk that acting so pressed.
Ed Rendell is not part of the search and Biden himself was not announced until 8/23 two weeks before the convention. This is about mysogyny period and that‚Äôs what should be attacked!

Oh no! How shocking that Biden isn't radical enough for this BDS spewing thing. Hopefully, her opponent David Dudenhoefer, will take advantage of her ambivalence.  is the representative that MI13 needs to restore sanity and integrity to Congress.
It would only be a question of how long before she declared Biden incompetent under Amendment 25.
The extremely obvious difference between Biden and Trump's mental acuity is impossible to deny. Keep in mind that due to Donald Trump's brother dying from alcoholism he vowed to never drink or smoke. Looks to me like clean living pays off later in life.

Hilarious: BLM not happy, Sanders people not happy. Meanwhile Joe Biden has no idea where he is or what is going on. Right on track, apparently, to win in November.
You sound as idiotic and untruthful as the House Dems who "questioned" him. I hope Joe Biden picks you to assure that you will both lose in November.

There needs to be an answer to this grandma ad where Sean Hannity lies that Joe Biden is ‚Äúabsolutely ‚Äú for defunding the police. This was shown on  and there was no fact check and no pointing out these lies. These lies take hold.
so you‚Äôre not going to focus on the fact that the increase in crime in under Trump or that it‚Äôs a lie that Jor Biden is for defunding the police? Seriously ? Thought you were a ‚Äújournalist!‚Äù
Drop the pretense and just vote for Trump. If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, you are voting for Trump, period!
#DurhamComethStill albeit at a snail's pace, unfortunately. Only reason I can think of to not indict sooner, rather than after the election, is idiotic belief that doing so might "influence" the election. Of course it would, and SHOULD influence the Biden candidacy.
The election is about being suckered thru Joe Biden unsus. Or president Trump.
These polls are not true. Florida is extremely Trump supporters! Follow the source for the truth. Biden opens up 13-point lead over Trump in Florida: poll

Was this his recovery from his aneurysm's?
Correct. Biden represents Sanders/AOC's socialist government. This is an absurd argument to choose Joe. Trump is the only choice to preserve our constitutional republic and restore our economy from the COVID manipulation by Dems. #DementiaBiden's VP "pick" will make this clearer.
Democrats using Antifa/BLM as their political STORMTROOPER army to terrorize citizens, destroy their businesses and ruin their lives, while  ordering police to stand down. Democrites, Biden's Lying Minions (BLM) and Antifamals (Antifa Animals) are all the same at this point.
Biden only wants to continue what Obama signed into action. Ben Carson has delayed implementing the 2015 changes.
Not the least little bit! Fox has changed significantly since the younger Murdochs have taken over. Maybe this is indicative:Biden NEEDS to get his VP name out NOW; he needs to have her Skirt to hide behind; he cannot carry this campaign  another minute

Kamala, if you are VP, you will be running the US. Joe Biden, as you and any human alive knows, is not capable of running anything. He is old and sick- very sick. And you in charge as Commander in Chief is a joke.

Dems believe that VP/biden will walk out of the Destruction of our Country and transform it into the Marxist State they have wanted for 50 yrs!!

I think that is what it meant. Biden‚Äôs last press convo said that all areas (zip codes?) must have low income housing now.
Supports Biden, Cuomo, and de Blasio
Pretty racist of you to assume poor=black.  You sound like Joe Biden saying poor kids can do just as good in school as white kids. You a leftist though. You‚Äôve been telling black people they need you and the govt to care for them for years. Racist.
This rings of Biden‚Äôs quote about poor kids being just as good as white kids. Your assumption poor=black shows you‚Äôre a racist and horrible person. You think so little of minorities that them being middle class is foreign to you.
Imagine if Biden was in charge and didn‚Äôt impose the travel ban. What would the death count be now. Much greater for sure.
Who is going to ask that question?  These Dems won't do anything but softball interviews. Biden refused to do an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday.  Had Trump refused Dems would say he is hiding from the press.
That‚Äôs an understatement. That‚Äôs like saying Joe Biden is underwhelming

Joe Biden is far left like you are a feminist.
Biden loves this, he's been playing typical liberal game.  Blame Trump for this unrest &amp; riots.  But all riots &amp; looting, destruction. Are with Liberal leaders of Governor's &amp; Mayor's. Nothing is going to happen until Trumps intervention.
You mean his wife, Joe Biden?
I still can‚Äôt believe this one black girl I know had the nerve to say she was voting for Tr*mp bc he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlock up a bunch of black people like Biden‚Äù.... whew I can‚Äôt even begin to voice my thoughts like WHEW
Biden will never agree to an interview or a debate. He is simply too cognitively challenged to get through either.
Joe Biden RULES, Donald Trump DROOLS.
Donald Trump is a serious threat to our country and democracy. Joe Biden will save us when he wins the presidential election in November.
Yah, but I mean.. Its not like Biden is as bad as Trump, who's suppressing the Black vote. Its completely different....... /s
Joe is an old man with obvious cognitive issues. Trump is so much stronger mentally. Biden's handlers will never let him debate Trump. They don't even let him take questions from reporters. He's an empty vessel being used by the far left.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN
Just sayin‚Äô.....  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Your probably right. BIDEN hasn't done anything for years.
It's almost as funny as when they say Biden's ahead in the polls üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Why would you beat biden off?
This is what Jor Biden can bring to us.
Biden is pathetic and a joke! He has been in Washington over 40 years and done nothing! He lies and pretends to be whatever the Dems want at that moment! Trump is not even close to perfect, but he is no puppet to the party!
I won't be voting for Biden or Trump, only voting Down Ballot. I don't vote for racist, rapist, warcriminals, &amp; are helbent against #MedicareForAll! And I'm definitely anti interventionist &amp; against US Imperialism. #ProgressiveStrong #BernDownTheEstablishment
Rudy those numbers are nothing compared to what Biden will do if he‚Äôs elected! We‚Äôll be depentant on China for everything!
There's no such thing as Joe's husband Joe Biden either üòÇ
He's so full of shit. How's the flu vaccine done in the last 20 years. The fear mongering will stop in November and America will begin to live again. If Joe Biden wins then America has allot bigger problems than the virus.
Obama and Biden inappropriately used the FBI to spy on their political opponent.  #SpyGate
What does everyone think should happen in Portland?  I say let the city go and use images for commercials of what our country will look like with Biden voted in.  Sorry Portland, but YOU voted these people in that hate cops and love antifa.
I'm starting to believe California isn't a lock for Biden.
Trump is lying about NATO &amp; he told Fauci not to tell people to wear masks. Trump cares more about his middle school test.Joe Biden is a good decent, law abiding, server for the people and a true American.Trump needs to hang up the phone. Not fit for this high office
You are much smarter than Biden. You should run for president of the democratic party.
Maybe it's the relationship he had with a Grand Wizard of the KKK? Maybe it's the racist crap that comes out when he opens his mouth? Maybe they don't like Pedo's? Maybe they don't like corrupt politicians? There's plenty not to like about Pedo Joe Biden.
Only Illegal Aliens will be getting free health care in Biden's America. And YOU will be paying for it.

Both trump and biden are pedophiles. Just bc i talk abt one doesnt mean i support the other. üôÑ
Joe Biden?  Trump is actively, ACTIVELY destroying constitutional norms. He is so stupid it hurts watching him try to put a simple sentence together. All the while you and your dead party whistle Dixie.  The end of this charade is nigh.
Joe Biden wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance against me!
181 days until Biden is sworn in as our PRESIDENT! 181 more days!!
Guns and ammo were still legal yes but Government almost stoped ammo production and business that sold guns and made them were illegally forced (via banks) not being granted loans, Thanks To Biden and OBAMA! Wake up Dems want to take other rights away too!
Trumpy Bear is smarter than you think! I think he is doing it to egg Biden in to doing one? Trump does have some screws missing but touchy feely Joe is missing them completely‚Äô
That's the dumbest thing that I have ever heard. Everytime Biden speaks out of script he makes an ass out of himself.
VP Biden is a joke to think other Preaidents were not racist.You misspelled Citibank  They picked Biden and cabinet for Obama. Indoctrinated the guy into how politics in DC works because he had fuck all experience   Molded by the machine
It's not an unpopular opinion. I care who the VP is, but I'm ready to cast my ballot for Biden regardless. Wish I could vote tomorrow.
Republicans unanimously opposed any stimulus payments after the 2008 economic collapse. Democrats have been begging Republicans to help people now.   Jobs are teetering precariously while Trump refuses to lead. If Biden wins I fear GOP obstruction on 1/21.
As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals.
Biden Opens the Door for School Choice   I wonder how many times he'll change his stance on this? What about the teachers union?
I‚Äôm very concerned about mail-in ballots. If they do this, you know Biden would win. That would suck! Lol I might even move!
Jim Clyburn said today that Joe Biden has compassion, but needs a running mate with "passion". Who do you think would bring "passion" to the Biden campaign?
A pandemic is not the problem.  Blaming is.  Be quiet Mr. Biden.  You are full of malarkey.

MIKE HUCKABEE: Joe Biden Is The Last Person Who Should Be Talking About Empathy
why didn‚Äôt u call out Hogan Gidley when he told creepy lies abt Biden? Or when he insinuated that HHS Secy Azar was a med doc justifying his early pushback on masks? Trump touted Azar‚Äôs ‚Äúmedical‚Äù advice. Azar is a lawyer &amp; a pharma exec 4 Eli Lilly. HE‚ÄôS NOT A DOCTOR!

Biden picks Harris, that a rap. Pence going to tear her record apart. Also a second term for Trump if he does not drop out.
BLM donations are strictly to political campaigns. Bernie Sanders net worth $2 million , Joe Biden Presidential Campaign! Not a penny goes towards helping black lives, community, education, health. Since that video of 2015 they changed the website so it‚Äôs hard if not impossible
Neither Trump or Biden are great speakers. The problem with Trump is that he says wild sh$t AND he believes it &amp; acts on it. He's dangerous &amp; he's made dangerous mistakes that we're suffering from now. I'm not a huge Biden fan, but at least he listens to advisors &amp; experts ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Bringing up George Wallace seems counter productive considering Joe Biden's history with the man.  Not sure that is some dunk that you think it is.

How do you know this? You're aware Duke is planning on voting for Biden right?

VP Biden with a spicy zinger. The political season is really heating up.
You probably already know this, but HRC,BIden mentors...1 imperial grand wiz KKK ( Robert Byrd) 2  Black genocide supporter (Margeret Sanger)  That's all I'm saying on this. Have a good day. Don't believe the lies.
Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick could very well become the President of the United States if he wins and is unable to finish his term.  This pick actually has a lot of meaning. I hope he doesn‚Äôt pick someone dangerous to democracy like Kamala Harris.
I'm kinda already laughing at this logic though, because contextually we all know what Trump meant.  Meanwhile the MSM turns a blind eye to Biden doing nearly the same thing.   Its just going to get worse when the debates start.
Is he talking about Biden?  Sounds like it!
1. I worked as a server. I'm very aware there are a-holes that don't tip.   2. Joe "you ain't black", is going to have to try and win that vote back. Dems used these people and took their vote granted for years.  Accomplishments of both:

Don‚Äôt they support Biden, the CCP and globalism?

So a term ends on Jan 20, and with no result, House picks POTUS, Senate picks VPOTUS. Wouldn't it be the disfunction that our system has become to have Biden as POTUS and Trump as VPOTUS? I mean, 2021 might tell 2020 to hold its beer!
The GOP in Washington is a disgrace. Not a fan but where do I turn to? The DEMS are so far left now. Biden is losing his mind - literally (sad to see actually). Republicans are cowards. WTF dude. As of right now, the GOP will lose the Senate and WH. #SOS
EVERYTHING that you have done will be ERASED as soon as Biden gets in office. Your memory will just be an orange greasy stain on America.
Delaying the election is a stupid idea. You're roughly 90 days from election and your focus is this? Come on. Focus on recovery, preserving the Constitution, Biden's policies and the impact of those policies, defending civil liberties. If not, DEMS will control.

Executive summary: "Biden is in good shape."
Better lawyer up. If you thought Bush v. Gore was ugly, Supreme Court ruling in Biden v. Trump is going to make that look like child's play. Having said that, Constitution firmly ends one term by Jan 20. If no clear winner, House picks POTUS, Senate picks VPOTUS. #Election2020

We may see a depressed vote vs a suppressed vote. No matter what we are voting but our children think Biden is ‚Äúbasically a republican‚Äù. I‚Äôm hoping the spirit of John Lewis will inspire people to vote
The progressive side of the Dem base.  We also talk  to friends and family in other states and we understand the dilemma seems to be Biden appealing to moderates or progressives, if he doesn‚Äôt pick a progressive the vote may be about voter enthusiasm.
We‚Äôre in S Carolina, more than likely an electoral vote for red.  Voting is still very important to us, but I hear so many people say if it‚Äôs Harris they won‚Äôt vote.  All we can say is (Do you want 4 more years), but that doesn‚Äôt work every time.   Biden/Harris

In a perfect would it would be neither Trump or Biden but this is where we‚Äôre at. Faults aside, at least Biden has been in office for years and knows the ins and outs of politics and wouldn‚Äôt completely embarass us (hopefully) on the world stage.
I am, Joe Biden does not have my support in any way haha
I don‚Äôt regret a thing I‚Äôve said about Joe Biden or Big Tech today. I meant all of it and won‚Äôt back down from it.
Biden is by no means perfect. Far far from it. They‚Äôre BOTH mentally unwell. It‚Äôs sad that our two choices are senile old men with histories of sexual assault. But I would take Biden over Trump. Purely because I want somebody back in office that actually knows what they‚Äôre doing.
As Biden has said he‚Äôd be one term, what does it matter if she wants to be president then?
Stable genius this one. He has the balls to say Biden has trouble? Wow.

Susan Rice, Biden, Harris, etc.. care nothing about any of us as veterans. Don't fall for this bullshit.  They didn't care when the last administration did it. They killed american citizens without due process as young as 16 with drones.  Nobody cared.  Now they suddenly do?
I'm saying Dems do nothing but use victims, veterans, black people, brown people, etc. but exploit them for power  You all suddenly care about the troops over Pentagon uncorroborated Russia stories? Dems voted to extend the war.  You did nothing when Obama and Biden allowed this.
Susan Rice was part of the Obama/Biden administration while Iran had bounties on US troops in Afghanistan.  I was one of them.   They rewarded Iran with a nuclear program instead.

I gotta say if Joe Biden is picking a female vice president his main vettors should be women! Leaning on Chris Dodd keeps and protects the old pattern of male gatekeepers. Women would understand and see strength where Dodd sees trouble.

You do realize that's been debunked?  The reason BLM even exists today is because if legislation Biden pushed
If that was a factor I doubt that Biden's team would reject her based off of that. They'd reject her because her views have skewed more towards Bernie than Biden on several issues.
Zuckerburg working with Trump in collusion to ban Biden ads ! A good president would have said "I welcome the competition", see who wins, but frighteningly you should be AFRAID, trump said he won't concede if he loses! That's terrifying as he's deranged enough to start WWWIII!
Biden has already said he's looking at one term. I wouldn't be surprised if towards the end of the term he flips it to the VP. That's also probably a big reason why it's taking so long: Harris flamed out pretty early during the primaries.
He must have forgotten he has DEMENTIA!!
Biden's big thing apparently is finding someone he agrees with on most issues. Not sure if Duckworth is like that, but I agree with you.

Using your brain &amp; not putting Your pedophile candidate who has been in gov for over 40yrs back in office. Great economy, low unemployment across the board before virus. Voting for Trump is using your brains. After 40 yrs you still want to give Biden just one more chance?
I supported Kasich 4 years ago, and I was pleasantly surprised he will speak at the convention. As far as who I support this year, its Biden. Buttigieg was my 1st choice. I'm not thrilled about it, but Donald Trump is a cancer in the heart of this country.

can't think of anything the Trump team could do with Biden choosing one of the most prominent figures in their Obama-Clinton expanded conspiracy universe
No one, absolutely no one, who was already going to vote for Biden will change their minds because of Harris. Or Rice, or Bass, or Warren for that matter. The only fence sitters are those who never had any intention of voting, Biden or not.
I just want to finish my half of bowl so Biden's supporters can finally fuck off out of my life.
Don't worry NBC if Biden wins Antifa will be coming for you too

No the Dems are trying to discredit the election. If they thought Biden would win they wouldn't be doing this.  When you win you want the results to be "true and certified"
I want to see the debate between Trump and Biden Trump will chew him up
You bet your ass.  Regardless of party, regardless of wealth, regardless of celebrity, pedophiles have no place in society.  If Trump is a pedophile he deserves no mercy.  Same applies to Biden or Clinton or Graham.
I can hardly wait!   Another Biden plan!
I used to be a Democrat, and now I don't see why even Joe Biden hasn't left the Party! I  didn't leave the party, they left me!  AND I  DO MEAN THEIR LEFTWARD MOVEMENT.
I fucking cant. Can we all just agree Biden sucks but he‚Äôs better than trump and just vote for the man????
I can‚Äôt believe that Biden just realized he shouldn‚Äôt have TikTok on his phone...God help us if he gets elected; China absolutely has access to Sleepy Joe‚Äôs iPhone.

Can we please do away with this "Bombshell" bs? Nothing will ever happen to stop any of this. Never does. Next "Bombshell" could be "Joe Biden found having an affair his is basement with the housekeeper" and nothing would happen. Stop it.
The Republican governor in Texas has death panels in his state that decide which covid19 patients go home to die.  But Trump says Biden will kill the suburbs.   Meanwhile, counties in Republican Texas are w/o ICU beds. Worried about the burbs? Test results are 3-10 days behind.
The ones we see in the Carolinas repeatedly state that Biden supports defunding the police. Features old people dialing 911 during a break-in, being told there‚Äôs a 5-day wait. Not subtle.

None on the attempted coup of Trump  by Obama and Biden using Comey and FBI?
As well as every other minority.  Left always talks about "old white men"   Well? Biden has a list of women to pick from for VP?  WTF  shouldn't he be choosing by qualifications? This victim mentality is really  Screwing us up as a country.
It's gonna take Joe Biden and the rest of America years to undo what you have done. We WILL make America great again.

I live in Charleston, SC and remember when  was VP. Senator Hollings wife died and Biden came to Charleston to go to the visitation at the funeral home out of respect for his friends.   Trump won‚Äôt pay respects to John Lewis.

Biden‚Äôs debate prep was a disaster.
What a dumb shit comparison. Joe Biden in 2009 vs Trump today. Joe would now try to suck on that ball today. Joe hasn't been out of his basement for more than 24 hrs in over 3 months? Can't even answer press questions. He is mentally done. 40 yrs in DC=Cause of the problem!
FWIW I'm referring politics and the calculus of picking POTUS running-mates, although it applies more broadly. Anyway, I'd rather see Warren in a Cabinet position (or SEC) where she can get a TON accomplished... unless Biden's guaranteed to step down.
Very true! Just don‚Äôt please don‚Äôt get complacent by polls! Even if Biden is leading by 99%, VOTE

Why didn't Biden take this action decades ago when he was first elected? Define a "fair shot." Elaborate on "never had a fair shot." Never?
I‚Äôve always thought he‚Äôd drop pence. Right after Biden announces his pick and gets all the attention. Trump will try and announce a new vp to try and take away biden‚Äôs attention. Make it gaetz. Ha ha. Get ready pencie.

Wow the media lies,lies, lies and more lies! I love polls they also predicted Hillary would win oh that was a lie as well!!!
All of these polls are misleading. Many people are embarrassed to say that they will vote for trump. I dont trust any poll that doesn't show Biden leading by at least 8%. Racism will decide this election and there's a lot of racists who won't admit that they are racist.

I'm stating this as democrat voting for Biden. There is no way to get an accurate poll on this because many aren't going to give an honest response about who they plan to vote for.  I think people are living in a fools paradise if they really think Biden is ahead.
Both Pres. Donald Trump and challenger Joe Biden have criticized Twitter and Facebook, but they're still giving both plenty of money, despite shooting the messenger.

This is the msg to carry forward, not that stupid "Biden's up by 15%" bullshit. I think that at some point the Republicans are going to push that point to keep. Dems at home( it's a sure thing) and get their base out (we are losing).

Better lawyer up. If you thought Bush v. Gore was ugly, Supreme Court ruling in Biden v. Trump is going to make that look like child's play. Having said that, Constitution firmly ends one term by Jan 20. If no clear winner, House picks POTUS, Senate picks VPOTUS. #Election2020

In a perfect would it would be neither Trump or Biden but this is where we‚Äôre at. Faults aside, at least Biden has been in office for years and knows the ins and outs of politics and wouldn‚Äôt completely embarass us (hopefully) on the world stage.
I am, Joe Biden does not have my support in any way haha
I don‚Äôt regret a thing I‚Äôve said about Joe Biden or Big Tech today. I meant all of it and won‚Äôt back down from it.
Biden is by no means perfect. Far far from it. They‚Äôre BOTH mentally unwell. It‚Äôs sad that our two choices are senile old men with histories of sexual assault. But I would take Biden over Trump. Purely because I want somebody back in office that actually knows what they‚Äôre doing.
Stable genius this one. He has the balls to say Biden has trouble? Wow.
Thank you! At least with Trump, there are attempts to stop it.  A Biden win will never just encourage them and America will slip into another civil war.
Doesn't surprise ME! Biden has been a plagiarist for DECADES! His ONLY original thought was his hairy legs! üòÇ
I agree this is ridiculous and seems like it comes from a place of sexism. However, I also don't want Harris to be the VP. To balance Biden we need more of a progressive. Otherwise we are libel to end up with another moderate ticket that won't generate enough enthusiasm.
I wonder if Biden knows he has a Twitter account.
Easy ! Go for Biden. You can buy him off !!
Joe Biden wants to make the world a better and more just place. That‚Äôs a fact, and it‚Äôs progressive enough for me.
How I feel knowing we will either have Trump or Biden as our president for the next 4 years.
Oh, please. Not on your life would Dr. Biden be so petty
Looks like Ronnie Milsap. Has biden gone blind?
but... biden was a VP... and now he's running for president... MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. JUST SAY YOU'RE SEXIST /AND/ RACIST AND GO!
Okay, shouldn‚Äôt a VP always be ready to step in just in case. That‚Äôs called ambition? That‚Äôs a bad thing, if Biden wins, he‚Äôll only do one term and we all know that.
Is that biden with KKK member? Birds of a feather I guess right? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Then Biden should pick a man. "Too ambitious" won't be an issue...
Biden would not be able to function without handlers.
Remind me what Biden did in the 8 years he was VP?
Leslie should get together with the rest of the people in her Florida suburb, who all apparently love Biden‚Äôs ideas, and demand their town build lots of low income housing projects around the neighborhood.
anyway joe biden bad and thank u for coming to my ted talk now back to regularly scheduled programming
Susan Rice, Biden, Harris, etc.. care nothing about any of us as veterans. Don't fall for this bullshit.  They didn't care when the last administration did it. They killed american citizens without due process as young as 16 with drones.  Nobody cared.  Now they suddenly do?
I'm saying Dems do nothing but use victims, veterans, black people, brown people, etc. but exploit them for power  You all suddenly care about the troops over Pentagon uncorroborated Russia stories? Dems voted to extend the war.  You did nothing when Obama and Biden allowed this.
Susan Rice was part of the Obama/Biden administration while Iran had bounties on US troops in Afghanistan.  I was one of them.   They rewarded Iran with a nuclear program instead.

You can thank 40 years of globalist trade deals that both R &amp; D establishment pushed for with China that made this all possible.  Trump has been talking about this threat since the 70s.  You all did nothing about it, and Biden wants to give them more.   Quit fucking around
Obama &amp; Biden knew Iran put bounties on US troops in Afghanistan when I was there, and did nothing but reward the country's nuclear program
I am a yellow dog Democrat but I‚Äôm all for Biden reaching out to more people even if it risks people like these tweeters.
Don, Biden has become a  12-year-old mind, stuck in a 77year old body.
VEEP LEAK? Joe Biden Photographed with Talking Points About Senator Kama...
Furthermore, none of you did a goddamn thing when we were getting targets on our backs by Iran under Obama/Biden  You don't give a shit about veterans. We aren't your puppets
Riot endorsement equals votes for independents or trump. It‚Äôs that simple. Biden is not doing well. This refusal to condemn the use of explosives and assault of officers (guilty of nothing) is going to cause him to lose. Swing voters WILL NOT support the party that supports riots

I hate politicians. I think from top to bottom 80% of them are in office to enrich themselves  Joe Biden has spent a lifetime in govt. His net worth is only $9 mil  Considering he probably spent the last 4 years doing speaking engagements that is peanuts  I trust him #Biden2020
I gotta say if Joe Biden is picking a female vice president his main vettors should be women! Leaning on Chris Dodd keeps and protects the old pattern of male gatekeepers. Women would understand and see strength where Dodd sees trouble.
oh it will be.. what do you expect from Biden the pervert.. LOL
Biden doesn‚Äôt even know where he‚Äôs athalf the time, what are you talking about President Biden??? He needs to be in a nursing home he has obvious mental issues!
The Democrats voters and Trump haters aren't smart enough to understand what went on today, in Nadler's Romper Room. If they were, Biden wouldn't be on the DNC ticket for PRES.
ask Pres. Trump about police pulling out of DNC, and Biden's security detail.   is this story or will you bury the event?
Good, one less for Biden and some of Sanders people will not vote for him.
Tell that to the millions of black people impacted by his legislation and who's cities are burning.  Biden's Crimes Bill contributed to George Floyd's death.  You can't be against "systemic oppression", not understand that it takes time to develop, and then reward who did it

Yeah, let's not get it twisted. I am not voting FOR Joe Biden. I am voting AGAINST Donald Trump. Biden was not my choice, but I'm damn sure taking him over the alternative.
You do realize that's been debunked?  The reason BLM even exists today is because if legislation Biden pushed
If that was a factor I doubt that Biden's team would reject her based off of that. They'd reject her because her views have skewed more towards Bernie than Biden on several issues.
Zuckerburg working with Trump in collusion to ban Biden ads ! A good president would have said "I welcome the competition", see who wins, but frighteningly you should be AFRAID, trump said he won't concede if he loses! That's terrifying as he's deranged enough to start WWWIII!
Biden has already said he's looking at one term. I wouldn't be surprised if towards the end of the term he flips it to the VP. That's also probably a big reason why it's taking so long: Harris flamed out pretty early during the primaries.
He must have forgotten he has DEMENTIA!!
Biden's big thing apparently is finding someone he agrees with on most issues. Not sure if Duckworth is like that, but I agree with you.
You are blessed with a beast viking name that automatically gets people's attention and you have a genuine smile. When people go to your page and discover someone with an uncommon talent for satire, dare I say: hilarious. I deem anyone who makes fun of Joe Biden as awesome.

I'm surprised that locking up black people wasn't on the card
I'm surprised it doesn't have lock up or kill black people for being predators and endangering white children with living in a jungle.
Biden-Harris, y'all! That's the tweet.
I heard excerpts of Joe Biden‚Äôs economic stimulation plan. It was exactly what the USA should have been doing several decades to promote African-American businesses so black entrepreneurs can expand and hire staff including circulating funds within African-American communities!!!
This is what I keep saying. Specific date. Biden quote. The quote even addresses the Dodd kerfuffle yesterday!
Biden has already made a choice. His wranglers just want him to wait until next week to announce. NO CNN scoop here.
Get this reminder out to the DEMS.  Other than a brief spurt of Polling rise after the DEM's Convention in August,  Biden will only dream of a Dbl. Digit lead 2 weeks before Nov. 3rd.
The deaths aren‚Äôt a lie. Imagine how many people would have to be sworn to secrecy and be extremely competent to fake 150k deaths. Democrats can‚Äôt even find someone better than joe Biden. They couldn‚Äôt pull off such a hoax.
Enthusiasm for Biden is -1 on a scale of 1-10, B. Sanders supporters have said pulling the lever for Biden will be akin to eating a bowl of sh__, and... he won't get enough sympathy votes to win. It's all but over,  except for the counting.

overwhelmingly voted not to include Marijuana Legalization as a point of their respective issues.  Strike 1:  Hillary, Strike 2:  Biden, Strike 3:  Bye bye.
Yeah, I saw the Biden quote. What do you think?
Because unmasking without a good reason is a violation of the 4th Amendment that‚Äôs why. It violates a persons expectation of privacy. For 38 people to do it to Gen Flynn and some with no apparent basis..... like Biden and Powers. That‚Äôs why.
Because the DoD says the evidence and the investigation is inconclusive.  You did nothing when Iran did this to US troops under Obama/Biden  Stop pretending like you care about veterans.
"You will be happy to vote for whomever is chosen"  Should be the motto of the Democratic Party.  Biden is going to pick the cop.
I know numerous people who voted 3rd party who say they will vote for Biden
Reporters clap for Biden when he finishes his teleprompter ‚Äòpress conference‚Äô.
Biden is not choosing a VP by himself.
Who can seriously listen to Joe Biden?!? This has got 2 b a cruel joke!! Pls! Wake me up! He is despicable. Cannot honestly take his candidacy seriously. Joke!
Using your brain &amp; not putting Your pedophile candidate who has been in gov for over 40yrs back in office. Great economy, low unemployment across the board before virus. Voting for Trump is using your brains. After 40 yrs you still want to give Biden just one more chance?
I supported Kasich 4 years ago, and I was pleasantly surprised he will speak at the convention. As far as who I support this year, its Biden. Buttigieg was my 1st choice. I'm not thrilled about it, but Donald Trump is a cancer in the heart of this country.

can't think of anything the Trump team could do with Biden choosing one of the most prominent figures in their Obama-Clinton expanded conspiracy universe
No one, absolutely no one, who was already going to vote for Biden will change their minds because of Harris. Or Rice, or Bass, or Warren for that matter. The only fence sitters are those who never had any intention of voting, Biden or not.
I just want to finish my half of bowl so Biden's supporters can finally fuck off out of my life.
Don't worry NBC if Biden wins Antifa will be coming for you too
Kick your feet... scream at the top of your lungs... throw shit.... it doesn't matter, we have 2 options in Nov they are Trump or Biden... once you come to grips with that it will make the choice more clear.
7/28/2020 Suggested tweet for Biden social team:  ‚ÄúWhen President, unlike Trump I will arrive at work before 10 am. Please vote!‚Äù
No the Dems are trying to discredit the election. If they thought Biden would win they wouldn't be doing this.  When you win you want the results to be "true and certified"
I want to see the debate between Trump and Biden Trump will chew him up
You bet your ass.  Regardless of party, regardless of wealth, regardless of celebrity, pedophiles have no place in society.  If Trump is a pedophile he deserves no mercy.  Same applies to Biden or Clinton or Graham.
I can hardly wait!   Another Biden plan!
I used to be a Democrat, and now I don't see why even Joe Biden hasn't left the Party! I  didn't leave the party, they left me!  AND I  DO MEAN THEIR LEFTWARD MOVEMENT.
I fucking cant. Can we all just agree Biden sucks but he‚Äôs better than trump and just vote for the man????
I can‚Äôt believe that Biden just realized he shouldn‚Äôt have TikTok on his phone...God help us if he gets elected; China absolutely has access to Sleepy Joe‚Äôs iPhone.
Ending wars 100 billion to black economic zones 360 million to historic black colleges and universities Hispanic prosperity act Healthcare reform First Step Act - Prison reform Section 230 of CDA  I also don't see Biden standing up to events like in Portland  etc..
Repeat offenses, involving Comey, Yates, Rice, Biden, etc.. they tolerated it and contributed to it  Its one thing if its at the bottom but if its enforced at the highest levels then that is a bit problematic
Can we please do away with this "Bombshell" bs? Nothing will ever happen to stop any of this. Never does. Next "Bombshell" could be "Joe Biden found having an affair his is basement with the housekeeper" and nothing would happen. Stop it.
The Republican governor in Texas has death panels in his state that decide which covid19 patients go home to die.  But Trump says Biden will kill the suburbs.   Meanwhile, counties in Republican Texas are w/o ICU beds. Worried about the burbs? Test results are 3-10 days behind.
The ones we see in the Carolinas repeatedly state that Biden supports defunding the police. Features old people dialing 911 during a break-in, being told there‚Äôs a 5-day wait. Not subtle.

Straight facts from a grandmother who is changing her vote to Biden.
None on the attempted coup of Trump  by Obama and Biden using Comey and FBI?
As well as every other minority.  Left always talks about "old white men"   Well? Biden has a list of women to pick from for VP?  WTF  shouldn't he be choosing by qualifications? This victim mentality is really  Screwing us up as a country.
It's gonna take Joe Biden and the rest of America years to undo what you have done. We WILL make America great again.

I live in Charleston, SC and remember when  was VP. Senator Hollings wife died and Biden came to Charleston to go to the visitation at the funeral home out of respect for his friends.   Trump won‚Äôt pay respects to John Lewis.

FWIW I'm referring politics and the calculus of picking POTUS running-mates, although it applies more broadly. Anyway, I'd rather see Warren in a Cabinet position (or SEC) where she can get a TON accomplished... unless Biden's guaranteed to step down.
Very true! Just don‚Äôt please don‚Äôt get complacent by polls! Even if Biden is leading by 99%, VOTE
