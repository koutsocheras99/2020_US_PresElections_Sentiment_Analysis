Have you ever caught yourself in the middle of an argument with a Trump supporter, and you realize what the fuck am I doing here?
How do you figure that he is racist or senile? What proof do you have, except for Trump's need to find some way to insult him, nickname him, turn him into a monster like Trump is? He could never compete with Obama, could never even begin, so he tried to erase Obama's legacy. 1/
Trump isn‚Äôt just running against Joe Biden. He‚Äôs running against a virus that doesn‚Äôt belong to a political party, doesn‚Äôt watch Fox News, &amp; doesn‚Äôt care how many times the president of the US tries to wish it away. The virus has a big vote this year,
Just as you think you have him cornered. He didn't just know Epstein. They were in business together. Trump was behind it all. That is why Trump had to make sure that Epstein never got the chance to talk... And why he wishes Maxwell "well" so much... Just a... Reminder.  3/

We will lose some Trump voters so there is that
You people think Americans are idiots. Everyone except Trump cultists can see through this bullshit. It has been the law of the land for 10 years. Maybe get your criminal president to drop his lawsuits against ACA
I merged my accounts and saw this on here it is still relevant today. I wonder how many others have lost previously okay relationships to Trump and his madness?
Could either be a Bernie Bro (and I was a Bernie supporter) or a troll / disinformation source.  By his policies Biden actually has the most progressive platform of any Democratic pres candidate ever.  Progressives should be ok with that.  Esp compared to Trump, good lord.
Okay. You don‚Äôt get to insult people &amp; then act like a whiny little brat when someone tells you to stop. Trump is toxic. He doesn‚Äôt give a shit about you.
That are already covered under the ACA that he wants to gut.   Not the first time lying Trump had used this carrot close to election time. He only wants the votes then will give Americans theüñïas usual.   #PreExistingConditions #Heathcare

The stimulus thing makes me wonder whether certain Republican senators are using the pretty heavy cover of their incumbency and fiscal responsibility to hurt Trump here. I think there are at least some that would trade four years of Biden for a more traditional GOP again.
Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare
In regard to #3, maybe that's why I'm less certain. Even if things only get marginally better, instead of marginally worse, Trump could sell a steady hand and people may be stupid enough to buy it. But you're probably correct that things will get worse. No stimulus is killer.

Criminal. Trump and the GOP have no bottom. Doing everything they can to steal another election. Putin continues to have his way. This is pathetic.
Did...Trump write this tweet...?
Wrong. It‚Äôs right there on the HHS page. The ACA (aka Obamacare) says you can‚Äôt be denied due to pre existing conditions under the plan you get from your employer, which is what most Americans have. Trump Republicans are being conned by a charlatan.

Thanks for proving my point. Trump was referring to the killing thousands of protesters in Tiannamen Square. So you are saying that the way to deal w/ protesters who want democracy is by attacking them viciously and horribly. Congrats, you just aligned yourself with the CCP.
I question this. Why would China want Biden to win. With Trump, they continue to see America, diminished as a world power. Plus they know to just wave money in front of him and he will follow.

That is too abstract. You must look in detail, what vote moves you toward, or less far away, from your goal. Trump has moved further away from Progressive goals than Clinton would have. I.e. $2,000,000,000,000 less revenue for m4a. $26 trill. Debt harms future m4a support.
You really think so? Dude isn‚Äôt okay in the head. Neither is Trump of course... I don‚Äôt think competence is what Biden will bring personally... maybe his cabinet will at least be okay?

This is why I am votimg trump 2020. The left will let this happen to people and animals. But if a cop pepper sprays 1 of there dogs they want to sue??? They killed 3 horses in this peaceful riot. God bless WWG1WGA
Everytime I think Biden said something to hurt himself, Trump matches him and so on   This is incredibly depressing lol
‚ÄúI love Trump‚Äù was the  platform for all the GOP contenders, so yeah ...
Trump, Biden trade jabs on faith, Cardinal Dolan says religion should unite not divide us.  This is just wrong.  Religion does not unite us. Relationship unites us.
#TikTok might be headed out in 45 days, according to a recent EO signed by Trump. #instagramreels just launched. But will #activists use this feature the same way they‚Äôve used TikTok until now? Only time will tell. Either way, this is bs. #TikToktrump #tiktokdown #TikTokleak
Conservatives are out in full force over female rappers using (clutches pearls) adult language.   Somehow they remain silent as Trump continues to lie from the book of 2nd Yo-Semites. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yeah. The governors fired the pandemic team and wasted weeks calling it a non threat. But Trump put H1N1 all on Obama as president. Hypocrisy much?
Before his rally in OH yesterday, the Trump campaign played ‚ÄúLive and Let Die.‚Äù Just let that sink in for a bit.
When you put it that way, it sounds like Trump is the elitist, not working people with college educations.  ü§î
‚ÄúThe World‚Äôs Most Dangerous Man‚Äù: Mary Trump on Her Uncle, President Trump, &amp; Why He Must Be Ousted  via
I'm leaving my options open, but it will fundamentally come down to strategy for me. Will my vote do more good inching a 3rd party candidate to 5% or making sure my state doesn't go Trump. I'll make my final decision on gameday based upon state polls.
Gonna be extra hard to blame this on Trump. They will try, however.

I hope you're right.  Bright moment -- one Trump/Pence sign in our small town as disappeared.  It was there a week ago, but gone now.
That's not true at all. Most of the intellectual people and people with advanced education are the ones criticizing him. The less-educated support him which is why Donald Trump said he likes the uneducated.
Someone on here remarked they expected Trump to call Thailand Siam. I on the other hand am QUITE sure he does not know it was once called Siam.
Would Trump be talking about how mentally fit he was if he felt he didn't need to?   But hey, whatever... it's just Trump being Trump. Let that slide. Or, because he's just worn you down so much, it's boring and not worthy of coverage.  Again, pure laziness.
Trump got "black vote" trending knowing that liberals would say some racist shit in response to turn off black voters  Great play. If he actually was smart like that instead of pretending Biden is some sort of secret grandpa antifa agent he wouldnt be getting destroyed üòÇ
Donald Trump and I are very different in many ways - like I didn't have to cheat to get into college - but one way we are alike, neither of us is a billionaire.
So Trump thinks strength is being "vicious and horrible." All we need to know, as if we didn't already.
Liberals will tell everybody they might as well be voting for Trump if they don't fall in line, same as they are now anyway.
AND....theres a reason he will not release his transcripts. Let us clarify some things: Donald Trump is NOT an intellectual. Dinesh D'Souza however IS a condescending pig.

...the Trump admin eliminated the NSC Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense in 2018...declined to renew funding for a fed pandemic detection prog in 2019...proposed budget cuts to the CDC...ignored a guide the Obama admin created on how to prevent a pandemic.

Saw your tweet but not the preceding ones. Had to look to see if you meant Kanye or Trump.
That darwin was onto something with his theory of natural selection. Trump supporters not wearing masks or social distancing in a crowded room will solve the problem itself. This is why only a moron would follow a moron president.

"Trump is thin-skinned, self-obsessed, small-minded, intellectually lazy, and ill-disciplined. These never seemed to be great qualities in a chief executive, but they have caught up with Trump over the last six months in particular."
I love that Trump is banning Tiktok and making the entire millenial generation and older gen z's mad so when they go to vote, they vote him out. Thanks T-dog! #ImpeachTrump #VoteHimOut #TikToktrump
Dear President Biden. Do not under any circumstance, pardon Donald Trump. Signed Karma
What needs to be done to reverse our course and set the nation right again... Trump has no interest whatsoever in writing our course because he has convinced himselfthat we are good and that he's done the best job he possibly can. And that's not good enough for this country.
replacing red trump with a blue trump seriously risks ensuring we end up with something *worse* than trump in 2024.  Four years of no meaningful progress and president biden insulting people the way he does will erase the memory of Trump enough for R's to refurbish themselves.
Trump is the laughingstock of the world .
The issue at hand is, who is better for the country to get us out of the crises we're in. At this point, Trump has proven himself incapable of taking control or even seeing that there are crises. Biden is the obvious choice because at least he has a plan and he acknowledges 2/
I think people are looking too much into the fact that Marshall isn‚Äôt Kobach but overlooking that fact that Bollier isn‚Äôt Kelly. B is a former JoCo GOP. Kelly is a Topeka Dem forever. Some of those Trump-Kelly voters may see similar choice with different dynamics.
Is there anyone is the GOP that actually knows what socialism is? Why didn't they scream when Trump bailed out the farmers after his tariff debacle? The ignorance &amp; hypocrisy is exhausting.  He doesn't have friends on the left &amp; they didn't kill Herman Cain &amp; 157,000 +Americans
Is too chicken to debate Jo Jorgensen. After all, she can drink water with one hand, and that hand is bigger than Trump's.
But Trump was never racist before....Seriously?

No, Biden did not say that. He actually said if Trump is prosecuted for anything he won‚Äôt interfere. Tweet reported for posting bald-face lie about a presidential candidate.
Its day
Anything other than a reluctant vote for Biden is a vote for Trump unfortunately
This might work...unless we can elect Trump, again, via write in:):):)
It is difficult to debate silly putty. The man can‚Äôt answer a question or stay on topic. tRump‚Äôs responses are nothing but nonsense &amp; attacks. That‚Äôs not a debate. I would also suggest that debates are not going to change anybody‚Äôs mind. I don‚Äôt know why we plan to have them.

üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª thank you! We need more checks in place to stop the ancient corruptions our founding fathers feared. If Trump has done one thing good for this country it‚Äôs all the worm holes he has pointed out in our democracy that we will see sewn shut.
160,000+ people are dead because of the incompetence of this WH and tRump betrayed our troops. He colluded with Russia and goes golfing every weekend. If jobs have been added it‚Äôs in spite of him not because of him.
Figures.  Trump country.
Trump will never take action to control the virus.  In the first place, he is incompetent and doesn‚Äôt know what to do. In the second place, taking action now would be an admission that he was wrong to ignore it and call it a hoax six months ago.
TikTok threatens legal action against Trump‚Äôs executive order, saying it sets a ‚Äòdangerous precedent‚Äô.  Trump‚Äôs executive order would ban the Chinese social media app from doing business with U.S. firms in 45 days.
Its not to sell music it is to take votes from Biden for Trump
Oh good!  Body count rising and Trump is playing golf and fund raising this weekend.  Congress is deadlocked on help for our pandemic ravaged nation.  #DelouseWashington #TedSpeaksTheTruth

Trump still AFTER 6 weeks has not addressed Russian bounties on American soldiers! We military are DISGUSTED by this president!!!  Trumps lack of action is NOT acceptable!
Uneducated trump base trying to rewrite history.
Not sure whether you are joking but I think it's actually a good point. Trump depends largely on low-intellect people who believe that what they see on TV is real.

I could see John Lennon being a Trump supporter  "you know, I don't like the racist stuff but he doesn't take any lip service"  "we're both from New York, we attended parties together"  "I'd like to give him the rights to 'All You Need is Love' for rallies but Paul won't let me"

Kerry, my thoughts...there were many, many God Fearing Christians who set out 2016. They couldn't support Hillary, and weren't comfortable with Trump.    But they fear the Godless ruin the DNC/ANTIFA/BLM synthesis has brought. They aren't sitting out 2020 &amp; are voting Trump

D.C. Circuit rejects McGahn immunity claim opposing House committee subpoena. This has been settled law since George W. Bush administration. Trump is simply running the clock and playing the courts. Courts need impose Rule 11 sanctions.

It would be better for you to clarify that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. It is highly amusing to see you flail and try to defend Trump's faux pas, by vehemently sticking to a completely false and ridiculous narrative. He can barely speak English... 1/
It does when a vast majority of the current republicans have done NOTHING but allow him to get away with the crimes he has perpetrate for the last four years. It also does when your only republican choice is trump..... you shouldn‚Äôt have to have this explained.
Gonna be more critical of a somewhat bad headline than you were of Trump referring to 150,000 deaths as "it is what it is?"  You're not a serious person.
Please see my above tweets. Regardless of whether it is Trump or Biden in the White House, eventually the Tax Acts that are active will expire. Eventually, new relief acts will have to be written just as they were by Obama, George W, and somewhat by Trump.
Trump campaign has nothing real on Biden so they have to make it up:
Donald J. Trump: We veterans &amp; active military are still demanding answers about Russian bounties on our troops. We want to know why you withdrew troops from Germany, and why you want Russia in the G-7. Why do you communicate in secret with Putin? Treason? Or stupidity? Or both?
How high does the body count have to go?   How many lives must be ruined? Trump continues to do nothing!  He needs to disappear now!!! #TedSpeaksTheTruth
Why? Marshall is in that spot where he was trump skeptical before run (2016 Kasich guy) so couldn‚Äôt get the endorsement so had to be Trumpy during primary in a state wear growing area is more moderate (JoCo). He‚Äôs favorite but not surprising (see McSally 2018)
The tax reform signed by Trump enriches the rich, gives huge tax breaks to the corporations, and increases the tax rates on families and individuals.
Don't forget energy. Trump: Biden is against energy  Fact Check: Biden lives in a house with electricity.
With all that money why is he so scared of Trump
Maybe but trying to see what kind of hoops he can get Biden or Obama to jump through is classic Donald Trump behavior.
It has really gotten to the point where you have to pick and choose who to watch on  . If not pro Trump, many are anti Dems

And thats a fact, not Trump Administration spin.
Not ignoring Trump just pointing out hypocrisy. Obama says 58 states and media says slip of the tongue. Biden says black crack, you ain't black, etc and media ignores. Trump says Thigh land and the world is supposed to end. Pols can't admit mistakes, including your Biden.
It‚Äôs bizarre and disheartening that what Trump believes the GOP and its voters want to be is the caricature of the Right the Left has insisted is reality for decades.
And you think Trump's mentality is better??

Donald Trump is also a nightmare horror. It's incredible that not only is the only thing demd can offer against him now as bad as biden, but that bill clinton enticed him into running in the first place thinking he'd be an easy opponent
Not one ad have I seen of any Democrat backed group against Biden. Now to the other side. Countless backed Republican ads against the Coward. Why is this? THEY WANT AMERICA BACK. TRUMP HAS DESTROYED OUR COUNTRY.
Just remember how much democrats use victimhood. No different here, with Michelle's claim. A bunch of BS as they ignore the crimes committed that led to the Trump/Russia collusion lie that was fed to America for 3 years.

Trump praises the July job report. Stupid.

There is quite a difference In leveling accusations of racism, which Dems do to Trump constantly and pointing out real racist comments. I hate to break it to you but your monoculture comment is a racist one just like Biden‚Äôs comments were.
On please let Trump be the first and last.
And just to be clear, most whites who voted Trump are not racists, sexists, homophobic, or in any way, shape or form anything other than decent Americans who voted their conscience. Had you in the media said this fact just once in 3 1/2 years, we don‚Äôt have the divide we do now.

trump's party has a lot more to worry about than Kanye West.  They have an incompetent, racist, corrupt, traitor leading us and their party; and the people will speak in November no matter the cost of the corruption and vote this man out of power and all of his enablers!!!

So America is basically a Trump hotel, in the eyes of the rest of the world
Yeah it does, because Trump is the Republican party. These others are RINO's! Like your dad.
How do they actually go about banning it though. Tiktok isn‚Äôt just going to shut down because Trump says so. And millions of people already have it on there phones. So how does that work?
Scratching my head here. It is like you didn't read either Biden's tweet or mine. You know damn well you'd never give Trump a pass, let alone the praise you're giving Biden.
And yet... go far enough right, and this is just political, like how NY shut down Trump U and the Trump Foundation.  I guess they want to be scammed?
When I‚Äôve made comments to certain family members of my disproval of Trump and how he‚Äôs handled situations, it was as if I blasphemed against God. üòî It‚Äôs become apparent that Trump is God to some.
So, Trump pronounced Thailand as #Thighland . Will he struggle w Phuket, which is one of Thailand's popular tourist spots? #Thailand #Phuket #Dynang River
His defense of trump is nonsensical since trump immediately corrected his mispronunciation, thus acknowledging he had mispronounced it the first time.
Evidence that  is the one actually suffering from a form of dementia. (Explaining why he was taken to do a cognitive test.) Trump is suffering from Frontotemporal dementia, PSP form. Biden really CAN use that knowledge in the campaign!
Trump hasn't fallen; he's always lived in the sewer.
They could take trump to jail when he's dead..it won't be near as satisfying tho.   Wait....nvm
Seriously? You would rather the left take control of government, abolish the filibuster, raise taxes, defund the police, and realign to guarantee a one-party system for decades just because you don‚Äôt like Trump‚Äôs behavior? Have you become that liberal or just that stupid?
I almost liked your tweet and then I saw you support Trump.  What kind of delusional bitch insults one these guys intelligence but likes the other?
You are blinded by white lies where in a time where there world is shifting backwards in time where the people of color had no rights. I don‚Äôt believe for 1 sec. Trump is a Christian man, more like a slave trader in my view.
Hey Donald Trump! Holding up a Bible doesn't make you a Christian any more than holding up a stethoscope makes you a doctor.
What if we all just agreed to write in a third party and nominate  for president?? I cannot handle Biden being out only other option to beat trump üò©
Trump is a p*ssy. He doesn‚Äôt give a crap about anyone‚Äôs safety. He is doing this becaysw its a platform where he has no control. He got trolled at the Tulsa rally &amp; people like  expose his dumbassery.
Its disheartening and disgusting. In the time of trump...i should know better by now
Enlist George W. Bush and Al Gore to help us prevent a Trump-Biden nightmare in 2020
CNBC just keep sucking up to all these guys all the rich people who get everything get all the money from Trump Becky quick still in her basement collecting her full salary while the rest of the people out here dying and starving and they say nothing against Trump
Good to know how fast the Senate can act during a national emergency. When people are dying, out of work, broke, food prices are rising, the Senate was able to unanimously pass a bill that assures . . .  TikToc won‚Äôt be on U.S. government devices b/c Trump hates
How ridiculous. Trump has improved the Republican Party. Made it effective. Restored the constitutional values of our country.
Next time he calls something a hoax they should ask him about Trump University.
If Donald Trump is correct and Joe Biden can hurt God, maybe I should start saying "Bidendamnit."
Facebook removes troll farm posing as African-American support for Donald Trump
Now we just need to mark  and  ‚ÄúTrump Administration Affiliated Media‚Äù to really get it right
Trump makes no effort to do anything that would appeal to anyone outside his hardcore 40% base. They're his club members, and they're the only people in his world.
You are asking  to resign, right?   Our President Has Always Degraded Women ‚Äî And We‚Äôve Always Let Him
Trump is a Great PRESIDENT and keeps his promises. .  It just sounds this way to you.
The white liberal class is usually always ok regardless of who wins an election   This is why its easy for them to rehabilitate right wing monsters  Trump is their first true L  So they want everyone to stand with them to defeat Trump while standing for nothing. Its insulting
The ‚ÄúBiden is against God‚Äù strategy will be the thing that does trump in, because NOBODY believes that and EVERYBODY can see the desperation.
Where there is smoke there will be fire.  #45 just digging a deeper hole for himself.   So pathetic.  Trump Signs Executive Order That Will Effectively Ban Use Of TikTok In the U.S.
And once Trump is out - no one gets a pass who helped paved his way.
We need to be ready to march in numbers never seen before if Dirty Don Trump continues to try to rig the election.
160,000 dead Americans on the Trump regimes watch. #TrumpVirus
Debates don't scare Biden... Trump has a much more serious issue than he's let on. "Frontotemporal Dementia" is a cognitive dysfunction disorder that has some very unique and interesting side effects, behaviors and physical issues
I call the pandemic the Trumpvirus because no one has done more to spread it in America, and seniors like me need to be particularly incensed by the incompetence and moral corruption of Dirty Don Trump.
Well, Trump Global is doing fantastic. Eric and Jr have made over $100 million as of 2019 selling real estate, using taxpayers dollars to finance the trips around the world for the sales, a total of $167,273.61 for 3 trips just in Jan and Feb of 2017 alone.
Donald Trump is a #RadicalChristian.
An impasse in negotiations is putting at risk more than $100 billion to help reopen schools, a fresh round of $1,200 direct payments to most people and more.
I am starting to call Evangelicals who support Trump - "Radical Christians*.

There is no way in hell that Hilary is anywhere close to this ticket. People's disdain for her is what got Trump elected. Had the dems gotten rid of their super delegates retarded rules, Bernie is our current president. They gave Trump the victory because she is despised by all.
#OperationLeGend  We Thank Trump for Operation LeGend!!     Say his name say his name: LeGend  Operation LeGend.    Thank U President Trump for caring and DOING SOMETHINGI'm looking at the AXIOS interview w/ impeached Trump..OMG it's as if Jonathon is talking to a 5 year old..this is dude 45 is ridiculous. See it on You Tube for yourself..WOW!!
It‚Äôs already the law but in Trump world, who cares?
If I remember correctly, Trump takes no responsibility for anything.
Unless it‚Äôs Trump.
It‚Äôs called The Affordable Care Act aka Obamacare. So screw Trump and his executive order. Government via executive order is not a democracy. It‚Äôs a dictatorship.
E. Jean Carroll, Who Accused Trump of Rape, Can Go Forward With Suit - The New York Times
We've known since the last election &amp; nothing has been done except Trump crying about how he believed Putin.
Trump is so stupid that he doesn‚Äôt understand that airing his impromptu speech at a ritzy golf resort while his wealthy admirers sip wine is a really bad idea when Americans are starving.  Even Trump supporters can see this, ‚ÄúLet them eat cake‚Äù image doesn‚Äôt engender good will.
Which way are we going to go? Is it going to go the way that deposits $ in your #trump empire and all you fellow 1%ers.?! Take care of the working men &amp; women out here. This bill should have been negotiated months ago  with no lapse do the hard working mofos
What the actual fuck? Are you saying Russia is team Trump while China and Iran are team Biden? What top secret cold war bullshit is this?
Even Fox can‚Äôt hide Trump‚Äôs stupidity, corruption and incompetence forever. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much they alter their images or edit their audio, it is apparent in every word uttered from his lying mouth, and all America sees it. We‚Äôve had enough. Vote Biden and save America.
Aww, the snowflake trump supporter blocked me!
If tRUMP and most of GOP had their way we would have lost pre-existing long ago, Thank You John Mc Cain, may you rest in peace.
Even Fox can‚Äôt hide stupidity corruption and incompetence forever.  No matter how they alter images or edit their audio, the glaring facts of Trump‚Äôs failures are evident to all Americans. You can‚Äôt doctor your programming enough to make him look good, or even acceptable.
Trump and Biden will be campaigning at Ram Ranch little do they know their assholes are about to be fucked by 18 naked cowboys #RamRanch
I wouldn‚Äôt stop because by supporting Trump they‚Äôve shown that they aren‚Äôt capable of thinking clearly, are illogical and lack rationality.  Therefore, they could be dangerous, as people who exhibit those traits often can be.
Your family is to be commended for recognizing the damage and destruction done by Trump and standing up for America.
Trump and Biden can go get fucked in the ass at Ram Ranch by 18 naked cowboys for all I care #EndThe2PartySystem #RamRanch
Is anyone watching this crap on CNN about Trump's blood pressure. Who gives a shit. NEWS people. BTW, Does Sanja ever sleep??
Dumbbells! Just like Trump.
Oh this must be the Russian Bots trying to discredit anyone for Biden.  Too bad, sucker, it won't work this time. We will crawl on our hands &amp; knees thru broken glass, stand in the baking sun, pouring rain, sleet &amp; snow to vote for Biden. Trump will be carried out!
No one will ever unseat Sean Hannity as the primary trump ass kisser
Trump will always care about Trump.  No one or nothing else will ever matter.
When Trump loses, Kellyanne will have to crawl back under the rock from which she emerged three &amp; a half years ago. Maybe, as she goes home, she can take honesty lessons from her daughter. Dad has done a great job raising her.Apparently, she has had little input imparting values.
His tweets read like a carbon copy of Trump‚Äôs.  All he needs is some random Capitalization and he‚Äôll be all set to carry the Trumpism banner. Sad!
Trump wasn't distracted. As now, he was just plain stupid. He was briefed by the experts and decided it was a hoax instead. And because you failed convict him, you too have the blood ofxd160 k deaths from covid-19.
Trump is despicable. The invasion of our cities is a glimpse of what he would do if he could get away with it. Thankfully some brave moms and other brave people stood up to his ugliness and the thugs finally withdrew. Presidential abuse in plain sight. #dumptrump #votebiden
I find it interesting that people are saying Trump doesn't have a vision for his reelection. I can't remember the vision he had for 2016. All he did bad mouth everything and everybody. MAGA and drain the swamp was his best work. Look what that got him. #votebiden #voteblue
Given #Trump‚Äôs limited vocabulary and propensity for name calling, I don‚Äôt doubt that he will soon call #Biden Biden a poopenhead;  after all,  a man who hates God, communities, clean air, voting, the military, and people in general would clearly be a poopenhead.  #incompetent
Even if there is no election, Trump still has to leave the White House on January 20th &amp; Nancy Pelosi will become President.
If either Trump or Biden see my face I hope it gives them Hell and if either of them see this tweet I hope it gives them Hell
Truth be told I‚Äôm voting Trump and truth be told I‚Äôm lying If He sees my face hope it gives Him Hell
Your all on the same side, it‚Äôs all a big lie. 5G towers going up at record pace to destroy us at record pace. Q puts out scriptures but never claims Christ is Lord. Follow Christ not Trump, see the bills he has passed under your noses. The plan will not save you!
By this logic, I am Mrs Chris Hemsworth. Why don‚Äôt Trump supporters understand that saying something won‚Äôt make it true?
Trump could deliver a dump truck full of cash to my house tomorrow and I still wouldn't vote for him.
If he admits he has no intention of seeking the office and he's just cheating for Trump that sounds like an election crime just waiting to be prosecuted
Watching you flail around pathetically trying to defend Trump‚Äôs incorrect pronunciation is hilarious. Was the pardon worth it?
Trump must be the vice principal! Lol
Pence: Complaining that Supreme Court decisions &amp; justifices don‚Äôt favor Republicans after their appointments were made by Republican administrations. After pushing the reopening of Thale Academy, they‚Äôre quarantined.  His rediculous  doe eyed Trump adoration just isn‚Äôt working.
McConnell deserves the nick name Moscow Mitch and this is just one example. He taken donations from Russian operatives recently. It may have been happening for years. He's as silent on Russian bounties for our troops as traitor Trump. He can't be trusted. #ditchmitch #votebiden
So Meghan, who are you voting for?  tRump or Kanye?
I can't contribute money, but am doing my best exposing his corruption and poor leadership on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The urgency to have him voted out of office is on par with Trump. They are both disgusting and plenty of evidence around to prove it.
It doesn‚Äôt get much worse to take someone home.    There needs to be government protection from them lossing there ass , ohhhhh wait there‚Äôs is and Trump sitting on his hands.   Assholes
I always either change the channel or turn of the sound when she comes on tv. She either gives non-answers, or makes up stuff. She is every bit as disgusting as Trump.
SO WERE ALL GONNA JUST IGNORE TRUMP SAYIN BIDEN IS STRONGER THAN GOD? ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø REMEMBER WHEN THE PRESIDENT WASNT A JACKASS? ü¶¨ü•í I DONT
, y‚Äôall don‚Äôt think Kanye tryna steak votes for Trump? I mean, he could‚Äôve def ran before he went crazy.....  is a Clown.
Trump is a lunatic &amp; has spread his lunacy into the Rep Party, which wasn't much of a reach. Remember the Tea Party? We are still dealing with them. They have drug this party into a craziness that is killing &amp; destroying 250 years of building a democracy into 4 short years.
Heavenly Father, as you were with David, be with President Trump. Lead him, guide him, protect him from all of his enemies, strengthen him and give him some rest and peace so he can continue to lead the fight, in Jesus name.
Offended? Susan Collins left Americans unprotected, dying because she said Trump ‚Äúhas learned his lesson‚Äú. She gave him a pass on his criminal behavior. The only lesson taught was one for Susan. We don‚Äôt want a weak, coward, Trump ass kisser. We deserve better, and it‚Äôs not you.
Mr. Trump, we will not forget you turned back on the pandemic nor will we forget the republican governors and senators who followed your lead. The families and friends of the 160 k deaths and 5 m sicknesses have a vested interest in getting rid of you. You will pay for it Nov 3.
New covid-19 milestone   The USA exceeds 5,000,000 cases tomorrow  Trump's miserable Presidency at work  #dumptrump #votebiden #voteblue
I wish I could vote for his opponent. He needs to go down with Trump, in flames.
And so called Christians still tie their name to Trump... all those Christians by default are transparent in their godless greed and they are unmasked in their ignorance and or greed for money and use of the phrase trickle down
TALK about a WARRIOR FOR President Trump,   is a CHAMPION for ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS INCLUSIVE, because I BELIEVE the HOLY SPIRIT OPENED his EYES, Mr Terrell NOW SEES TRUTH &amp; THIS is GOD WORKING IN YOU, GOD IS BLESSING YOU  ... GOD is LOVE, &amp; LOVES YOU.
WOOHOO, Senator Haeley, I VOTED for YOU in 2016 &amp; YOU are a TRUE TRUMP SUPPORTER,  STANDING WITH MY PATRIOT PRESIDENT &amp; VOCAL. I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED in our other MISSOURI SENATOR, seems to me HE IS DISTANCING Himself from MY PATRIOT PRESIDENT,  VERY SAD FOR HIM.
So, just to be clear- Trump and his supporters can dish out insults like there‚Äôs no tomorrow, but criticism of Trump and his supporters can‚Äôt be tolerated? That‚Äôs a very hypocritical system you have there!
Ok so I started following you to see just what yall are trying to accomplish. But I am confused. You don't want Trump, you dont want Biden. So what is it? What's the end goal?
So Trump didn‚Äôt respond with ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù in regards to COVID deaths? Because there is video footage that proves otherwise. So try again, little Trumper. You‚Äôre out of your league
I am friends on FB with a student from my first year of teaching 25 years ago. Rural school in Central MO. One of the few Black kids there. She is beyond pissed. She is a gung ho Trump supporter and could care less what others think.
What's with the eyebrows on Trump?
Once upon a time you used to be a great investigative reporter that had hard hitting interviews.Jonathon Swan's interview was excellent. That should have been you. Is Trump your bud?Does he have something on you?Is it all your money, or just the fact you are old? So disappointing
TRUMP 2020!!!!!
Except Trump never pays his debts.
All of a sudden the tRump is all worried and compassionate. It‚Äôs sad and pathetic and so phony. Even says there will be a vaccine by Election Day....NOT !!!
But it's really him. Save 40% guy!!  I mute commercials or I pause it for a bit so I can fast forward thru all of them. If it's a Trump commercial, I yell oh f*ck no everytime
Great example of Trump administration incompetence. Is the State Department even aware that we are not welcome in most of the world?  Thanks to Trump the U.S. is the pariah of the world.
That's because you already support him. Some of the people who voted for Trump might vote for Biden if he refutes effectively the lies Trump tells. You and I know it's BS but not everyone does and they need to hear it and see it.
I don‚Äôt subscribe to the theory that Kanye is running to help Trump get re-elected because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in his nature to use an opportunity to glorify himself to help someone else
You spelled Donald Trump wrong
Trump is the Antichrist. He‚Äôs an evil,evil man. Will do anything and use everyone for power. He has become unhinged.
Please continue talking and giving interviews.  You are your own worst enemy.  Every word you utter means Trump is closer to reelection.
Neither does trump or the GOP!  #Biden2020 #VoteBidenToEndThisNightmare
instagram heard trump wants to ban Tik Tok and instagram wasted no timeüò≠
Is Barron Trump going to school? How can you guarantee teacher‚Äôs and student‚Äôs safety? What happens when teachers have to quarantine multiple times and they run out of sick days? Will they be compensated for lost wages?
Trump is loyal to no one, and he only cares about himself.  You have hitched your wagon to a career destroying loser.  What‚Äôs more, you know that he is crazy and stupid.  What does that make you for supporting him?
Judging by Trump‚Äôs idea of good taste, he would install fake naked statues, gold leaf every surface and hang pornographic pictures in place of our statesmen‚Äôs portraits. If you have ever seen his idea of ‚Äúclass‚Äù, you would shriek in horror.
I was alarmed about this happening when the stormtroopers were in Portland, but some thought I was over-reacting. Here is the first article I‚Äôve seen that addresses my concerns:  Election lawyers worry Trump could send federal law enforcement to polls
So this person would rather have four more years of Hell on Earth with Trump if they don‚Äôt like Biden‚Äôs VP pick? WTF? How short sighted can you be? We are trying to save America.
Don't say that.  It will put a hex on Paul McCartney's famous song. Everything associated with Trump dies
...if it wasn't legit life or death re: Trump, I would never in my life vote for this man.
Ah, you have already gone with ‚Äúliberal propaganda.‚Äù So you won‚Äôt believe anything negative about Trump, then.
I too can take screenshots. See the articles that pop up? Read them and learn more about Trump‚Äôs baseless claims.
Its not that fucking hard. It is trump and pence or biden. That's the choice.
I‚Äôm not really sure Trump would know what God is for or against. And likely, God would say, I‚Äôm not on either‚Äôs side, I‚Äôm God...
Go to google, type in Trump baseless claims, and see what populates
And people freak out over one stupid comment Biden makes...  Seriously, do they never listen to Trump speak? I'll take the occasional verbal stumble over this any day.
You said you don‚Äôt support people making baseless claims. Trump makes baseless claims nonstop, so I‚Äôm not sure why you are supporting him. That was my question. Sorry you didn‚Äôt get it
Its all about the stock market in t-rumps world. If people are jobless and literally starving he couldn't care less. A dwindling group of americans look at their 401k and the market and agree with trump. Thankfully the vast majority of Americans do not.
Well Biden is Catholic and Trump is a Klansman. They hate Catholics too.
This is funny bc in all that time. Trump will be dead the next 4 signs
Then why do you support Trump?
Trump's bungling of the pandemic is titanic. His blame shifting and unwillingness to take an active leadership role in containing the virus will show him to be the worst president in history. Republicans will regret not convicting him after his impeachment. #votebiden #voteblue
No one:  Trump: God, when you vote for Biden.
Trump is a stupid sick fuck
Remember, Trump is bad and Biden and the Democrats will win everything! How dare you disagree with us!
Yeah Trump‚Äôs totally only up 9 in KY and up 5 in SC. Sure....
After what Kellyanne Conway put on Twitter about Joe Biden, I suggest she take a look at this compilation of only a sparse amount of the gaffs tRump makes.  tRump cannot talk clearly AND he can almost never finish a sentence!
As soon as Trump stops acting like a petulant child he‚Äôll be treated as an adult.
She‚Äôs a former ‚Äúmodel‚Äù, ( hooker?).I‚Äôve seen her pictures, and this ‚Äúmodel‚Äùlooks as though she is would do anything for the American dollar.  It seems she‚Äôs still practicing for our pervert in chief. She has the goods on Trump, but has him over the barrel, negotiating more cash.
No shit. Don‚Äôt want to see a debate, fucking press lobs Trump softballs and will dig into Biden.
Donald Putin-Trump requested to be buried at the Arlington National Cemetery. DIGUSTING.  Do not let this happen. #dumptrump #votebiden
I agree the Republican party needs to reinvent itself.  But Trump is far and away the biggest threat
Growing up on the south side of Chicago doesn‚Äôt qualify Michelle as privileged.  She worked earning everything. Trump was coddled, given hundreds of millions of dollars, squandering it again and again. Daddy bought him an undeserved Ivy League education bailing him out as failed.
It seems to me that military leaders told Trump they will not attack civilians for him or anyone else. It explains why he is using contract thugs and DHS agents. It clear that AG Barr is the director of operations.
Obama was intelligent, capable, classy and respectable.  That‚Äôs why Trump supporters hate him.  Trump is someone so stupid that it makes his supporters feel good about the losers that they are.
Michelle used the word, ‚Äúdispirited ‚Äú because she has a better grasp of our language and it‚Äôs subtle nuances.  Whether Obama addressed Russian interference is inconsequential to the present situation with Trump, who actively seeks it out.  Trump‚Äôs treason should be your concern.
It's clear that Lindsey Graham goes with the wind. If Trump and McConnell go and Graham survives, he'll go with those with the most power. Most likely won't be republicans. My focus will be Trump and McConnell. #dumptrump #ditchmitch #votebiden
Those who cherish our country and want to see true equality for all are sickened by the events transpiring each day.  Your depression is understandable.  All of us who truly care fight to keep our spirit from sinking, hoping that we can remove Trump and his ilk, righting America.
That's what Trump said...
Just so the Reps could cheat to win. Trump is the biggest cheater of all but he‚Äôs their man. All a bunch of grifters.
No matter how Republicans alter Biden‚Äôs image or how many lies they spread, it doesn‚Äôt make Trump any more electable, more capable or any smarter.Trump shows us who he is every time he speaks, stumbling over simple words, refusing to answer questions, ducking and running. Coward.
Many voted for Trump thinking they had "nothing to lose".     I believe most of those types of votes will not happen next election.
Probably isn't Biden but a double. The mask makes it easier to hide his true identity. Bet a double debates with Trump.
President Trump's news briefing was 33 minutes long yesterday. He knows. üá∫üá∏
Only the incredibly ill informed or unbelievably stubborn, or stupid voters will hang on and vote for Trump. They, in refusing to acknowledge that have been conned, allow themselves to be preyed upon again &amp; again. The more informed voter no longer can be taken advantage of.
Kanye what a joke. Trump‚Äôs as crazy as he is. Reps have all become grifters. Learning from the feet of the master. vote people vote. In massive numbers, so massive Trump can‚Äôt do enough crooked deals fast enough to question his loss.
This is the truth.  Trump can only con you for so long.  Vote for a man of integrity. Vote for Biden to rid America of the Trump plague.
Your teenage daughter has more integrity than you will possess. You daily lie about things that can kill Americans. You know that Trump is a terrible person, destroying America, &amp; yet you remain complicit in his treasonous Putin  alliance. You better hope that there is no Hell.
And he‚Äôs gonna debate Trump?  He is gonna get spanked worse the Hillary did.
I don‚Äôt think it will be directly related to Trump. DA is too smart to announce that this far in advance of the actual announcement.
Trump is an idiot.   Common knowledge.   Same with stupid.   But his latest comment beats all.  Regarding the death toll, Trump said, "We're better than the world."   DAH! WOW!
Donald Trump's GOP
Trump is number one. Moscow Mitch is number two. Both must go if democracy is to survive. There's more rot in the ranks then these 2, but none more effective at destroying our moral fiber. Neither has a heart and only care about themselves. #wakeupkentucky #votebiden #voteblue
Trump this time has backed the truck up to the front door of the WH. Why bother using the back door? He is cleaning us out as fast as he can In case he can‚Äôt cheat his way to another 4 yrs. Kodak? Really? I mean really? Republicans, REPUBLICANS STEP UP!
Some points are worth repeating. Trump is sinking so far into his swamp of corruption that his most dastardly deeds, the worst of them need to be brought out into the light of day occasionally. Caging kids is one of them. #votebiden #voteblue
It's a wonderful thing. Humiliation for Trump first, then jail.
Mr Biden SHOULD TAKE a COGNITIVE TEST EXACTLY LIKE President Trump has,  Mr Biden's RESPONSES  are VERY DISASSOCIATING,  SOMETIMES MAKE NO SENSE, his POSSIBLE PRESIDENCY SCARES ME.
At least 3 of the 4 kids pictured are wearing masks. Their collective IQ is about 150 x higher than the adults in this pic.  The Trump administration just doesn't care about any of us. They value their comfort more than they value human lives.
Cadet Bone Spurs has declared bankruptcy 4 times. Also, he's the failed businessman of Trump University, Trump Casinos, Trump Mortgage, Airlines, Trump Ice, Trump Vodka, Trump The Game, etc. And how do you fail at selling steaks in the fattest country in the world?
Kids in cages is the hay bale that did it. #ImmigrationNation   The rest of the scandals just keep proving how dangerous/criminal/corrupt/treasonous trump &amp;  are.  #LincolnVoter
ANYONE has more experience than Ronald McDonald Trump...No offence to Ronald McDonald...he has zero experience and lies better than any rug I've ever seen. I'd vote for ANYONE other than him...my VERY sincere apology if that wasn't clear! Yikes! üò¨
At this point, I'm in the camp of "anyone but Trump," but that attitude can backfire for society. After all, Trump got elected mostly because he was running against Hillary Clinton. A lot of people either grudgingly voted for Trump or stayed home altogether.
The Senators who allowed this traitor to remain in office will be known as accomplices who refused to save our country from this treasonous man. They will be known throughout history as the cowards in fear of Trump,&amp; their names will be reviled as individuals who abetted treason.
Save America from total destruction by Trump. Neither Bernie nor anyone else should get your vote if you really care about the fate of our democracy.  Failure to cast a vote for Biden is tantamount to casting one in favor of Trump,the fascistpiece of shit destroying our country.
Only Fox who will lie for Trump will be allowed.  God forbid that the truth would be reported.
Coconut-emphasis on the ‚Äúnut‚Äù!  It amazes me the nut jobs and fruitcakes that continue to be all in with tRump. What in all honesty is wrong with you people???
My sentiments exactly!!!  Everyone complains and says every thing tRump does is unprecedented and yet nothing happens!  No consequences-ever!!!
As soon as you switch over to the live trump rally I‚Äôll be switching the channel. Stop broadcasting his bullshit. You fucks are gullible. He knows that your viewers tune out when he comes on and starts spewing shit.
You have to wonder who on Trump's staff will he blame for his disasterous interview with Johathon Swan. I don't understand how Trump managed to defeat a field of presidential republican candidates and then collect the electoral college votes needed to win. He's stupid!
You should listen to more than what Trump or Hannity tells you.
Could you kindly cast a spell on Trump, causing a fatal accident?  Asking for a friend.üôè
We need to ensure that Trump can‚Äôt steal the election through massive voter fraud with help from foreign dictators with whom he identifies and through his manipulation of the voter system.  It has already begun and it will only get worse. How do we save our Democracy?
62M people voted in the 2016 election, there are 16M people who work in healthcare to pull off the kind of hoax you're claiming almost all of them would have to be involved.    If that many employeed decently paid people are against Trump they'd win the election anyway
Trump is not going toward sanity. This is what dementia looks like. Unfortunately, he happens to be the leader of our country for whom many laugh
You have to dig deep to find decency in these two families. I wonder what Jared will face when Trump is driven out of office in shame and disgrace. #dumptrump #votebiden #voteblue
I despise Trump and I will happily tell him exactly why if he has an hour or two
While the virus was spreading Democrats were trying to impeach Trump and ignoring the problem. Then when the government informed the citizens the Republicans downplayed the virus. A complete and total failure from our entire government.
I talked with 2 yesterday. Another problem is many aren't hearing anything from Biden. If it was 2016 you would see clips from his rallies on the news at least. Trump is on TV every day
Trump would sadly not be the first President to be a Saudi puppet We have been their bitch since at least Ronald Reagan maybe even longer
Trump is a Saudi puppet
I think Trump is a puppet but not for Russia
Wish he would sue Trump. Just the Discovery phase would be fun Could you imagine Trump in a deposition? He would rival Stone.
This is amazing but I will never vote for Trump unless He changes his views and policies on immigration
I DEFINITELY WILL BE, I'm NOT AFRAID, I'm STANDING UP with My ALMIGHTY HOLY FATHER, the GOD of LOVE,MERCY,JUSTICE, LAW,ORDER, who gave the USA,GOD'S NATION, President Trump because He is also STANDS WITH/FOR GOD'S AGENDA. #VOTEALLRED
Americans hope that when Trump makes a middle of the night secret visit to Walter Reed that he doesn‚Äôt recover.  Whether a heart problem or drug overdose, the ER may be too overwhelmed by Covid patients to bring him back. Meanwhile, Satan stokes his fires, just waiting for him.
we know the point you are trying to make. Your point is that you don‚Äôt want Trump to lose the election and you don‚Äôt want him to reveal his dirt on you. BTW we don‚Äôt care that you are gay we care that you‚Äôre a bad person.
is such a Trump sycophant. This questioning of Yates is a blatant attempt to smear Biden and it‚Äôs disgusting!
Some people are saying John Barron was the one of the 'great generals' that told Trump Beirut was an attack.
If, as Trump says, I might take years to count the election results, Nancy Pelosi will be President on January 21st.
Leftists and Dems on here are whining about a possible Hatch Act violation by Trump with his acceptance speech. They wrote the book on Hatch Act violations.
American's are seeing the sabotage of our elections and at least some that are actively doing it whenever tRump speaks!!! What does it take for elected politicians to do something other than whine? The whining is just like crying wolf. Basically just lips flapping in the wind!
He finishes sentences which tRump cannot do.  He is humble which tRump is not.  He has compassion which is an anathema to tRump.  Biden is a human.  tRump was spawned.  Just the facts Kellyanne, not your "I am going to make tRump happy" BS!
If they weren't related to Trump, they wouldn't been allowed in. His hypocrisy marches on. His corruption is unending until we vote his evilness out. #votebiden #voteblue
The thing called tRump won't go away!!!
It's nice to learn some believers see just how evil Trump is.
I doubt there was never a point in Trump's life when he wasn't scheming, cheating or working out a way to screw his friends and anyone close to him. His presidency has simply gave him an opportunity to defraud in a much larger scale. #DumpTrump #votebiden #voteblue
Trump has quietly stripped 28 environment regulations including clean air, safe drinking water and clean water. His destruction will reach deep into future generations. What's ironic it will effect his own progeny. I guess since they don't benefit him, he doesn't care. #voteblue
Not new news. Just worth repeating. Trump the despicable. Do him a favor and he'll help you. That maybe a useful tactic in business but in a relationship with states it is disgusting and just plain wrong. #dumptrump #voteBiden #voteblue
BAHAHAHA!!! AMEN!!! WHATEVER IT TAKES!! ‚ô•Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üíôTRUMPüíôüá∫üá∏‚ô•Ô∏è
This looks like something Kim Jong Un would make also no fucking way would be Trump live to run in that many elections
Who does Trump think He is? Kim Jong Un? In North Korea You can vote but You only get one choice
Wow really!!! The only response is to attack the Former Black President!! Reality Check!! Trump has Failed the USA. His response.. It is what it is!! Sad as all get out!! My prayers go out to all those that have lost a loved one to Covid! üôèüèΩ
When someone still supports Trump
‚ÄúTrump is not a fascist‚Äù Hitler: 12 years ‚Äúelected‚Äù Stalin: 31 years  Hussein: 24 years Mussolini: 20 years  ü§®
DeVos and her hubby gave Trump a shitload of money.   Money will buy anything in the Trump administration.  Anything except competence, intelligence or integrity.
Please help the USA. Trump is going to steal our election.
One person can infect a dozen, who will infect others. It may not be bad today, but exponential Covid infections could easily reach hundreds, then thousands. Remember in January when Trump said only one person had it? Now 156,000 lay dead and over 4,500,000 have tested positive.
If you‚Äôre a news anchor and start your hour with a rant about #Trump or #Biden, the coronavirus, or the #2020election, then you‚Äôre not a real journalist and you‚Äôre part of the problem. The rest of the world is talking about and watching #Beirut, and so should the United States.
The point is Trump‚Äôs an idiot. Sad you need an explanation.
If his mouth is moving, Trump‚Äôs lying.
These are legal immigrants and look who they support, President Trump.   That‚Äôs because these are the people that work hard and suffer the most for illegal immigrants.
I have a seething hatred for Trump &amp;his henchmen. They collect fat salaries while Americans are suffering, wondering when their eviction notice will come, where food will come from to feed their children, who have lost loved ones to Covid.His answer, ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù. Horrible.
Honestly I don‚Äôt know that trump loves anyone.  I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs capable.
How anyone who ever finds Trump believable is well beyond me.
via    Trump criticizes everyone but Putin. Do you want this man as your president?
Trump revealed the kind of person he is during his campaign. In addition to mocking this handicapped reporter, he shamed women, and exposed his racism. Why did we elect him? #dumptrump #votebiden #voteblue
Trump banned Jeffrey Epstein from Mar-a-Lago after sex criminal hit on member's daughter, book claims   #JeffreyEpstein #creep
So while trump is threatening to sue the state of Nevada to prevent mail-in voting, in Florida he‚Äôs now promoting it.
Between 5-8 I think. It is difficult to pick a few when tRump opening his mouth can cause all 12 reactions multiple times a day!
Wondering what trump thinks he did to help the Black community?
They're silly letters written by a Communist apparatchik Teenage girly men that Trump as a crush on.
Thank you for a more reasonable response. I'm don't believe my views are as dark yours. However, I do agree that our legislators don't do what people want. The system sucks. I do what I can. Bash Trump &amp; hope #votebiden improves things. Can't get worse. IMHO????
Jason you have that backwards. Trump can't just get away with saying he's really really done a fabulous job. He will have to have facts and figures in his head. He can't even comprehend what he's reading &amp; pronounce Yosemite for God's sake  You are hopelessly deluded. I'm not
Trump‚Äôs level of comprehension is on par with a toddler. I truly can‚Äôt wait for the day he fails to continue breathing.
Trump on Covid death toll: 'It is what it is'
I do believe that Rep. Jordan is a bigger asshole than Trump. I watched him grill Fauci over the most inane things and asked him to weigh in on things like should the government limit protesting. Policy decisions are not for Fauci to make and he said so. Jordan is a jerk.
Thank you, Thank YOU, THANK YOU,  ! That is journalism! Dare to challenge with facts. Be respectful to whoever you interview including the prez Of USA. What a poor leadership in crises-- Prez Trump... RIP 157K+ This is simply not making #MAGA!
I‚Äôve wondered why that follow up question wasn‚Äôt being asked when Trump continued to throw this bogus response out to try to justify his lies and stupid ideas. ‚ÄúWho is saying that?‚Äùactually requires something other than imaginary generalities pulled from out of his anus.
Trump has absolutely no analytical skills whatsoever.
The great embarrassment is Prez Trump... we are suppose to do what he says and NOT  what he does.... err, he did vote by mail... so were some of his family, administration staff, campaign officials,.... #VOTE2020 early where possible. even vote by mail!!!
Now we see the depth of his corruption. He is trying to extort üí∞ from Microsoft. And take a guess who is the head of the US Treasury Steve the Mooch Mnuchin. The Trump Family thief. BBC News - Donald Trump: US Treasury should get cut of TikTok deal
Yep, old Betsy DeVos will keep kissing Trump ass while our schools are over run by disease.  She has no business being in charge of anything, least of all schools. Money bought her the position, but it can‚Äôt buy intelligence or integrity, also which she also knows nothing of.
My next door neighbors convert to Trump and Qanon full on in February. They're a LGBTQ couple. They posted how to make their own hydroxychloroquine. Blows my mind. One of them has already lost 2 jobs due to social media postings
By U.S. getting a cut, what Trump really means is that HE gets a cut. Screwing everyone who isn‚Äôt his family or himself, then grabbing as much money as  possible (often by by illegal methods) is Trump‚Äôs business motto by which he has conducted his entire life.
Absolutely fantastic!  He reflects my facial expressions every time I watch tRump speak!!!
I support the idea the Biden should not debate Trump. Trump will lie, make up fake facts, call names and in general make a mockery of the process. The aren't enough fact checkers to keep up with his lies.He was objective worse than Trump. He destabilized an entire region of the world with an illegal war, bankrupted the country, let his cronies rob from the government blind, and watched an American city drown without doing anything.
Yes &amp; the ACA is Obamacare for those who didn't know.....trump. üòÇ
Not manage it properly meaning not  knowing how to commit white collar crimes &amp; get away w/ them or know legal loopholes to avoid prison. Right? You wanna attempt to üí©on ppl by generalizations but I'm sure you feel crooks like Trump know how to properly manage money right?
if he can't get his tax money, blame donald trump.
I'm looking at the AXIOS interview w/ impeached Trump..OMG it's as if Jonathon is talking to a 5 year old..this is dude 45 is ridiculous. See it on You Tube for yourself..WOW!!
Trump has accomplished more in 3 years with constant daily attacks on him than biden has in 40 years but hey joe means business now
You can dislike Trump its your right but the constant, nonstop lies and cutting out parts of a story to deliberatly deceive people is fuking shameful.
Do you have a 401k ...thank Trump for all the money you made! Trump is now going after big pharma,  you dont hear that on cnn so you"re oblivious to facts
And hillary was innocent of all the crimes even comey had to admit she did right ???? And biden is a genious right lol???? Admit it you hate america !!!! Trump lowered your taxes fool. Trump stopped the tax of $1600 per year on people that didnt have insurance which was illegal
You people are really amusing lol.......2 years and countless millions spent on the witch hunt with liberal media cumming all over themselves daily and what happened in the end? Illegal fisa warrants and a failed coupe attempt lol. Hating Trump doesnt make him guilty.
two more weeks and trump will be urging people to vote by mail. no thanks, i will risk it in person.
The fact that so called white people don't even mess with Trump. Should tell you mask wearers something
This is classic Trump üòÇ
Trump vowed to use executive order to make insurers cover pre-existing conditions‚Ä¶you mean like the ACA/Obamacare?  Girl sit down üôÑ

my crunchyroll account just got yoinked by some nigga in mexico.  now...i ain't saying im voting for Trump.  but i am saying this nigga will rue the day.
Paved the way for Trump and all of his lunacy...apparently we have been in deep doo-doo a lot longer than I realized. üò•
Yep. Hopefully most people will realize it's a stunt and still vote blue. The GOP is once more going to screw us over to try to keep themselves and Trump in power.
Lol dafck going on bruh ü•¥  Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working against Biden
I disagree.....give Trump the stage so he can have a total meltdown for all the world to see.
lmao....both would probably fail. But I would still vote for Biden. At least he would still listen to those around him...unlike Trump's demented ass! üò°
Trump could roll around on the debate stage foaming at the mouth and the MAGAts would STILL VOTE FOR HIS DEMENTED ASS! üò°
Hopefully, the Moderators would stop Trump from interrupting and babbling on.
Trump wouldn't take a swing at a MAN...only his ex-wives and other women.  Let him try it....Biden would kick Trump's ass!! üò°
Lol "Trump is rich and you are poor, therefore, he is pronoucing #Thighland correctly! I bet you never left your home state you uncultured swine."
Well, to be honest, Trump is on record of saying that latinos entering our country are all rapists, drug dealers, and murderers....this statement from Biden is not that.
We can‚Äôt wait for November 3 when the greatest anti-democracy ploy by Trump and Republicans creates a doomsday effect. We need to find Senate Republicans who predict the same catastrophe to support invoking the 25th. Trump WILL DO ANYTHING to stay in power. We know it‚Äôs true.
I hope Trump signing an executive order to ban tiktok makes everyone realize how easy it is for him to bring about change, and how poorly he's utilizing that power when there are so many major issues that could actually benefit from it
Trump won‚Äôt pay it. He‚Äôs good at not paying his bills!
also I think it's hilarious that Trump keeps doing the whole song and dance of "niggas LOVE me cause I get em jobs instead of welfare" while still polling like absolute garbage with us. guess we're just ungrateful!
Absolutely. Trump is more of a national security threat than TikTok. He‚Äôs all about revenge.
I won‚Äôt be impressed with WAP until they get the real Trump on the remix.
Something something about not being black if they voted for trump.
the tik tok of dorian gray he trades his private data for eternal youth book ends when trump bans tik tok in like a month
Considering Biden isn‚Äôt with it enough the VP is going to be a target, the media will spin it as Trump is attacking her because she‚Äôs a woman...and a woman of color at that. It‚Äôs a built in defense mechanism.
damn...here i am thinking it was the majority of white women voting for trump   anywho, this tweet reeks of ‚ÄúDAP‚Äù energy  happy friday everybody   üíõ‚ö°Ô∏è
, y‚Äôall don‚Äôt think Kanye tryna steak votes for Trump? I mean, he could‚Äôve def ran before he went crazy.....  is a Clown.
For Trump humpers, nepotism, fidelity to your wife and the national debt are issues to be addressed only when a Democrat is in power.
Logged back into Facebook today.  Glad to see the racists are still racist and the dumbass Trump supporters I know still love and adore him.  Logged back out and staying away from there for the time being.
Curbside &amp; drop off voting should be an option in ALL states. I'm not trusting those machines this year. Russia &amp; Trump are in pain mode. I pray that they come up with a better plan by November.
Imagine if ‚ÄòBlue Lives Matter Mama‚Äô is a troll who is intentionally trying to get Trump to retweet her with that very specific picture. He would look like even more of a ignorant, callous imbecile than he normally does. Just a thought.
You support and enable Trump, that‚Äôs how.
Trump can‚Äôt control his behavior. It‚Äôs ingrained in his personality disorder. The Republican Party has no excuse. They know who and what he is and have made a choice to continue to follow and enable him. That‚Äôs unforgivable. The GOP belongs in the dust bin of history.
hello!! alec baldwin is an abusive douche but everybody forgave him for his snl trump impersonation. you think back to how he was bafore that.
Trump went almost his whole term without producing his taxes why should anyone else have to but then again the rules only apply to certain ppl.
All the fine yt boys be trump supporters
Trump is more pressed about the kids on tik tok than he is about the pandemic ü•¥
Well, Trump had finally succeeded at something...he checks off every single point on this list.
If Biden loses any state by the number of votes that Kanye West gets in that state, then they deserve 4 more years of Trump. If that is the master plan, then we should be good, right?
Hanley is a Racist, just as Parson is a Racist.  All those that support trump are Racist.!
Every kid from 8 years old to 16/17 would Be Democrat forever if you told them trump/republicans ruined fortnite.
aka the trump campaign stop went exactly as planned
And then only sleep with guys that hate trump.  God I‚Äôm getting so laid, so much :)
Vote anyway, you never how many may be dicussted with Dems, no one thought Trump would win, I didn't but voted anyway. So vote.
&amp; they should take Trump with them. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I tell you about egotiscal, sociopaths.  He really thinks ppl are stupid enough to vote for him. But then again ppl voted for Trump.
THE GREAT RESET: Davos &amp; the Plot to Cancel Trump
You can't TikTok your way to a second term because you can't deal with the corona challenge. Just stop it.   Trump issues executive order banning TikTok from operating in 45 days if it's not sold by Chinese parent company
is Lady Trump
That's why I always vote &amp; I will be voting for Biden because I just can't see Myself voting for Trump.
The Spirit can be "grieved" but philosophically, God cannot be diminished by the actions of humans. Yes, Jesus was hurt during his life on earth, but he cannot be hurt now except in the sense of grieving our choices. I believe he does grieve the Trump administration.
...if it wasn't legit life or death re: Trump, I would never in my life vote for this man.
Trump takes all voters who won‚Äôt vote for him for granted. It‚Äôs unconstitutional. I can‚Äôt believe anyone would vote for such an unpatriotic anti-American to be president of the USA.
Its not that fucking hard. It is trump and pence or biden. That's the choice.
Trump is going to get nailed in a Biden-Democrat Landslide on November 3.
Trump is trying to block the election for anyone not voting for him.
Has Trump ever actually answered a debate question?
Good one!üòÇyou must be a Trump U graduate w/your deflecting &amp; bringing up Obama. If Pres.O did 1/4 all the illegal üí© Trump has done he'd be in prison rn. How about he quit being a criminal &amp; just keep the salary, but he's too greedy to do that. He won't be president 4ever..TG!!
Now do #Trump imoluments and self dealing! üò≥ do it do it!
he‚Äôs also a Tr*mp supporter
Trump is the Republican party. They tried to hide their racism and homophobia and misogyny (not very well) but with Trump it was impossible. What he says out loud in public is what Republicans have been saying behind closed doors for years.
i‚Äôm well aware we need to get rid of trump. but this shit is so fucking gross and racist. why is this ok?? don‚Äôt fucking  me
Please send Trump and Barr to prison!!  Also Ivanka...Jared...DT Jr and Idiotic Eric
Can I turn Trump in and collect my $10 million?
I STILL think Trump is going to use outside interference to cheat (Russia) and voter suppression!
WE MUST GET TRUMP OUT OF THE WHITEHOUSE...HE IS DESTROYING THE UNITED STATES!!! üò°üò°üò°üò°
That still does not mean people will vote for his ass...actually, it may make more people pissed off at him   Trump is DESPARATE ...like a cornered rat. üê≠
God is already hurt that so many of his followers support Trump.
Bidens best move was letting trump dig himself deeper. But everytime this sundowning idiot speaks he says some stupid shit. His advisors need to get canned.
Donald Trump and Marty Jannetty have quite a rivalry going for most disturbing social media person of 2020.
Unfortunately, there are A LOT of these types of folks in my mentions who think being pro-Biden or anti-trump gives them some type of pass.  has been such a troll whose use of dog whistles against a BW who defends themself from such ilk is typical of these types.
Trump got in because of the electoral college. Once they do away with them, there would actually be hope.
Donald Trump‚Äôs shadow ladies and gentlemen.
Get your paper and pencil out and write out all the pros that Trump has done so far.  If by chance you are blinded by your bias, I will help you. Now tell what Biden has done in 40 years of politics besides filling the pockets of his family with $$...greed...power...
Do you want our economy to collapse? Trump is fighting an all out battle. Words slur‚Äîso. Are you so perfect that you don‚Äôt make a mistake. There is a difference of occasionally slurring a word and out and out insanity coming from Biden‚Äîbeing closeted for what reason‚Äîgaffs...hmm
I agree the Republican party needs to reinvent itself.  But Trump is far and away the biggest threat
Up Trump's bum.
Give me the other reasons why Trump would be so dangerous. Are you willing to have Biden who is afraid or rather mentally incapacitated lead the world against China/Russia .  Give me a legitimate reason why you hate Trump so bad.
How discussing Mia. Get the news straight. You are taking clips about Biden and inserting your bias towards Trump. Why don‚Äôt you sit down and write all the things Trump has done so far and then put a list along side of Biden‚Äî8 yrs VP=0!
But not a bad roadmap for what will likely happen after the election, assuming Biden wins.  Wouldn't be surprised if they even started calling Trump a closet democrat again, because it makes the narrative a little easier.
We all knew Trump was behind this. I REALLY dislike Trump! üò°
If I asked for Trump's to be blessed, followers would know something's wrong.
Many voted for Trump thinking they had "nothing to lose".     I believe most of those types of votes will not happen next election.
I don‚Äôt care how you feel about Trump...China lies about damn near everything no fact check.  Twitter can‚Äôt be doing shit like this.
China says bullshit they are not deleted...but everything Trump says is misinformation...ü§îü§îü§îü§î
Why are we waiting for a corrupt election to try and stop Trump? Can‚Äôt Americans convince a handful of Republicans to support invoking the 25th? Day by day he will continue to assault democracy and the rule of law. What k ow what he and the Republicans are planning.
LeBron James on Trump Refusing to Watch NBA Games: ‚ÄòWe Could Care Less‚Äô The genius speaks.  Mark Cuban likely concurs...
Yeh Trump has not done anything. Who woulda thought?
They also kidnap children from their parents and put them in cages and make them disappear. Tell me it is not so all you deranged Trump supporters.
Y‚Äôall forget the majority of America Voted for Hillary. But the electoral College voted for trump... #abolishtheelectoralcollege
I propose an alternative to home depot lesbians because the company supports Trump  lowesbians
I will not be voting by mail because I don‚Äôt trust it. Trump has his claws in the process. I will vote using a paper ballot and will crawl over glass to cast my vote for Biden.
That's very trump-like, hate to say.
Yes, It would be wonderful if the New York State AG is going to announce indictments of the Trump Crime Family. But yeah, ya gotta think it‚Äôs going to be some kind of challenge to the early termination of the census.
This definitively needs to be investigated. But I highly doubt anyone will be held accountable just like all the other crimes done by Trump &amp; others out in open for us all to see.  Must be nice.
ooh wee Joy the trump files wasHilarious
Josh, Trump is the current rapist president, that's who we are talking about now.
sad that we have to front to ACT like we like your celebs and president. these are not my leaders.. trump doing you a favor tho.. but you cant see passed theatricals. TRUMPET blowing for you CAIN (kanye) children to be ABEL

I can't imagine Trump knowing anything about a car or doing anything normal üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Yes, I've heard this one too.. amazing the degree to which people voting for Trump are trying to invalidate anything and everything which highlights his raging incompetence.  But when it's all said and done, science will still be science

Perhaps I'm wrong, but I haven't seen anyone on the left denying the pandemic or the need to wear masks.  I've got a good number of friends on the right (voting for Trump) that are skeptics.
I wonder how many times  has stuck his tongue up trump‚Äôs orange crusty asshole
Trump is melting down. He will be locked in a padded room very soon.
This is all about claiming COVID isn‚Äôt as bad as people think. Mainly to improve perception of Trump‚Äôs handling. That‚Äôs all.
go trump
Goodness, Blaine. This is where you‚Äôre going now in your desperation to defend Trump‚Äôs failings? Saying people aren‚Äôt really dying of COVID? So pathetic.
This is hilarious!!!!  &amp; Dangerous? &amp; I'm sure you feel Trump ain't?
You just described trump
Because Trump lives and votes from there lol
Yes! God bless Trump. #MAGAJesus
Someone please explain to me why any Bosnian is voting for Trump. I‚Äôm being so for real. Just because we pass in the US due to our skin tone doesn‚Äôt mean for a second that you wouldn‚Äôt be put on the chopping block for being MUSLIM. GTFOOO
Trump has a daily meltdown on Twitter. Like he is literally having one right now.
This is what trump Trash does all of them will be judged every rotten hearted varment had they been white none of this would happen this was done to embarrass even if a car was stolen they are trash !!
Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù anointed him 2 years ago
The source could be Trump‚Äôs own mouth. Have you heard that idiot talk about the virus?
Remarkable how you do nothing but complain about trump all day. Are those Ponzi schemes finally paying off?
Don‚Äôt tell this cat about russiagate and 3 years of trying to pin it to trump.
You speak as if BLM is one group with one agenda. So are all White churches unabashed Trump supporters and Zionists? Of course not.
It isn't even 6am STL time and Trump is already tweeting out bullshit.  Is it November yet? I can't take much more of this shit.
gucci pays trump rent in trump tower. think twice.
So, none of these Trump supporters want to be able to vote by mail? You‚Äôre a fool for promoting this.
Probably need to talk to Trump as the Postmaster General is one of his donors he appointed. I don‚Äôt think Pelosi or Schumer have any ability to stop this. Even if the postmaster were called to Congress he could just refuse like most other officials
Impeachment is a political process.  Most Americans believe collaborating w/ a foreign gov. to harm your political opponent rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.  It was true in 2016 and its true now.  I may have voted for you if not for your allegiance to Trump.
White bitches can honestly fuck themselves  FUCK YOU TRUMP

The Trump campaign displays a stunning level of ignorance when it uses the intellectual property of others without permission. We have seen this repeatedly in their use of Mrs. Obama‚Äôs speech and a great variety of songs. The folks running this campaign need to follow the law.

That's the way it's working.. everybody has a slightly different "straw that broke the camels' back".  But luckily Trump JUST CAN'T STOP TALKING, so people have a smorgasbord of inane, unsettling statements from which to choose.

I knew Trump was an anti-Yo-Semite.
I understand better why Donald Trump doesn't usually attempt to back anything he says up with facts.  He seems so uncomfortable referring to charts and graphs that are meant to depict reality, and seems to have no clue how to actually interpret them.
You‚Äôre worse than a Trump stooge. You‚Äôre completely ineffective.
The bottom right-hand corner. I know that look well. I too die a little inside every time I have to listen to Trump‚Äôs ignorant, incoherent bloviating.
the interview is gonna get a ton of views, literally the only thing trump cares about. its a win for him.
Growth. Trump and his crew exposed the evils of not voting lol
Honestly.  I'm at a point where i somewhat feel bad for Trump (not really).  In his heart he feels he's right.  why?  because his disgusting, sycophants keep feeding him this "data" to convince him he's doing a good job.
Undo everything Trump did, reestablish everything Obama did
I'm not standing EITHER.. Mr. Trump I'm dissopointed in you, not about politics,  just about being a human being. I never want that much money or power.    ,  can't even morn my mom's..
Trump is such a lying ü§¨ü§Æ
This is typical trump
I can't listen to Trump talk for longer than 2 minutes. Do I have to? Please don't make me.
I can‚Äôt believe that clip is real. Trump is being eviscerated in that clip and it is so obvious that he is out of his depth
Cops have been treating Black people like this for decades.   I had guns drawn on me and my friends in high school during a pick up basketball game because they thought we were trespassing at our school.   Blaming Trump deflects from institutional racism.
This Axios Trump interview is absolutely bonkers
Cool story. Now tell us why Trump‚Äôs son isn‚Äôt going back to school. I‚Äôll wait.
Oh, well that's okay, how do you feel about a possible civil war, all this rioting was all about Trump and making him look bad so they maybe really pissed when he wins.
Trump trash this is what they believe we have to be the bigger person God will judge these people by the heart they need a moment of aggression in their life
Trump is basically a LARPer in chief. He‚Äôs acting like this is the a really Huuge season of the apprentice.
I honestly thought this was built by conservatives when I first hear about a big gold trump statue of him laying down the law
WTF? Thanks Trump for making America nuts!
might want to listen to this exchange in a hearing with Dr. Fauci
When is Joe gonna debate Trump?
Pro trump democrat who bombed brown people. Nah.
Amazing how much ownership Trump supports take in Trump's incompetence. It's so personal for them. Like he's their daddy!
Hmmm.... I'm indifferent on them to be honest, but I do think Lars is worse at his job than Trump. üòÇüòÇ
I have not seen that, do you have a specific instant you want to post, please do, I'm the same age as Trump , sure we get a bit forgetful ,no doubt, but Joe is way beyond that, Trump I couldn't keep up with,  his energy is far beyond mine at the same age.
Trump never promised to release his taxes
The clearest sign they think Trump is going to lose in November
Russia and Saudi Arabia will have no used for Trump once he is no longer President.  They will toss him away like a used Kleenex.  No honor among corrupt thieves and SWAMP creatures.
you know? I wish antifa WAS an underground terrorist organization like the righties think cause they definitely would've assassinated Trump by nowThis isn‚Äôt about dogs dividing ‚Äúbad‚Äù states v. ‚ÄúGood‚Äù states.  It‚Äôs about all of us.  It‚Äôs the trump virus that‚Äôs bringing devastation to families.  You‚Äôre a bot.
Hard falls do damage. If only there was some way to quickly disassemble Trump after we yell "timber!" but before he hits the ground.
The Charlottesville thing is crazy because Trump said the exact opposite of what the media says he said.
It just so happens that the campaign lawyer for Trump is also Kanye‚Äôs.
This is like Charlottesville.  Trump never told anybody to ingest or drink bleach.  I get sick of the lying. Make an argument based on policy!  Defend unfettered free trade. Defend endless wars. Defend defunding the police. Defend third trimester abortion.  That would be honest.
With talks between Congress and the White House stalled, Trump is pledging executive orders to extend COVID-19 relief. #COVID19
He was objective worse than Trump. He destabilized an entire region of the world with an illegal war, bankrupted the country, let his cronies rob from the government blind, and watched an American city drown without doing anything.
He also promised an EO on requiring health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions, something that was already in Obamacare (which he wants to dismantle completely in a lawsuit). #COVID19
...such as extending federal unemployment benefits (amount uncertain), payroll tax cut, deferral of student loan payments, and eviction moratorium until at least the end of 2020. #COVID19

#ObamaWasBetterAtEverything He already did this. Where have you been? Is this why you support Trump, because you literally have no fucking clue what is happening?
Well, since preexisting conditions are already covered by Obamacare, then when Trump signs an EO protecting preexisting conditions again, then all of our preexisting conditions disappear....if I have my math right. üòâ
Yes &amp; the ACA is Obamacare for those who didn't know.....trump. üòÇ

Americans cannot be denied insurance because of preexisting conditions, per the ACA. Yet Trump wants to get credit for giving us something we ALREADY HAVE, WHILE low-key attempting to take it away. That‚Äôs how stupid he believes we are.
Mass incarceration of the corrupt trump administration. You got it right, Dave.

#VoteOutRacism  Trump needs to go. Now!!!
When Trump loses the election in 11/2020, we will have a reckoning with all the Trump/GOP shills.   Watch out for 'based' rebrands. Never allow them to pull the same trick again.
NPR reports facts that make Trump look bad, they demand that funding be cut. Except NPR gets NO federal funding. "Why doesnt Twitter ban these liars?" Bc they're not lying. Those are facts, even if you don't like them! 1st amendment only applies to Republicans now? F*CK THAT!!
The constitution means nothing to Trump, &amp; he'll prove that if he wins. It only matters when it serves his agenda. Presidential harrassment? Someone slamming or criticizing him? He yells "illegal!" Or whatever. So much for freedom of speech right? His base does it ALL the time!
Nobody's getting rid of the 2nd amendment.  He just has his base convinced that dems want to do that, so they hate dems and vote for Trump.
Voter fraud, election interference, treason, obstruction of justice, tax evasion, etc, etc, etc. Also of something happens to Fauci. Trump slammed him publicly! How is it possible that ANYONE still supports him?? They're either completely blind, or incredibly stupid!!!
All part of Trump's plan and why he appointed Dejoy to begin with.
Dejoy actually has a lot of stock in USPS competitors. GO FIGURE! It's all part of the plan. Trump can smear the USPS, and still make Dejoy richer in the process!
Reputation is these animal‚Äôs stock &amp; trade.  HOPEFULLY...the outrage of the American Public leads to legal reforms and accountability for abuse, but..  ...if you hold your breath on that, you‚Äôll die. We‚Äôll always be too polarized in the age of Trump.
if he can't get his tax money, blame donald trump.
Welcome to Trump's USPS. He appointed this guy for a specific task. It should NOT have been allowed since Dejoy has donated millions to the Trump campaign. But he appoints who he wants, where he wants. No knowledge or experience necessary. Its ridiculous!
Death, illness, hospitalization, hunger, unemployment, foreclosure, businesses permanently closing, a spiraling economy. This is Trump's America.  According to Trump, "It is what it is." #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020

Trump, Trump's voters, and the pandemic have shown the world what America is now--a selfish nation of angry people who only care about themselves, a hollowed-out every-man-for-himself failed state, a staggering pitiful international joke.

This was big news when Obama did it. Trump can't claim to do something that is already done. Also, why is he saying he's going to protect preexisting conditions while he's fighting to exclude them in the Supreme Court at the same fucking time? Oh right, he's an evil fucking liar.
So Trump is going to try to take credit for protecting people with pre-existing conditions, while at the same time fighting in court to remove those protections. Schizo.

Nope. The ACA already covered this.   As usual, Trump's full of shit and his lackeys are lapping it up.
U R DONE MORE THAN ANY POTUS ! ESPECIALLY D IGNORANT  OBAMA WHO WAS ELECTED DUE  2 HIS SKIN COLOR NOT FOR HIS CHARACTER! HE IS A CRIMINAL HE USED‚ÄùFISA‚Äù WHILE BEING PRESIDENT, TO SPY TRUMP‚ÄôS HOUSE / AND PRESIDENTIAL QUARTERS DURING ELECTION! THAT‚ÄôS  A CRIME! FISA IS NOT 4 THAT!

Trump didn't attack Biden's faith.  He merely said what Biden plans to do as president.
#GOP voted 80x (?) to repeal mandated coverage of pre-existing conditions? Trump filed law suits to stop pre-existing conditions mandated in Obamacare (passed as law by Congress).  But NOW  is cheering an EXECUTIVE ORDER for pre-existing coverage?

Each one is terrible, but Russia is first and foremost behind Trump, and he's openly awarded them every chance he gets. They'd be in the G8 now if Trump hadn't disrupted the G8, &amp; those bounties on our soldiers. I'd rather not be ruled by a Russian Oligarch in orange makeup.
I believe he's making the same error many liberals made in 2016, when they found Trump so preposterous and obviously unfit that they simply could not believe Trump could win even if the polls were like Clinton +3. Now they refuse to believe Biden is actually super popular

I think that Trump thinks people getting Coronavirus is it good job. Like people winning the lottery or something. there's just no other explanation for statements like this.
But this is where we will fundamentally disagree with Trump and Reagan, and the Republican Party. He's not helping, he doesn't deserve the office, and his response to the pandemic has been at the expense of lives, nothing short of manslaughter. Kind of like your pro life beliefs.
I guess we'll find out in "two weeks" when the EO is released! Also, very interesting to hear that we didn't need a federal law to protect pre-existing conditions in the first place.
I hope they don't let him back in.
Well, tRump wanted interference, so who‚Äôs laughing?

Today, Americans with pre-existing conditions are already protected by the Affordable Care Act, which the Trump Administration is asking the Supreme Court to strike down. The ACA changed federal statutes to require pre-existing condition protections. An EO alone cannot do this.

Why do some people love Trump? Because only with Trump is there a rational case for Biden.
After today's intelligence report it's clearer than ever why Trump doesn't want mail in voting. Paper ballots can't be hacked &amp; he knows the Russians are planning to hack voting machines on his behalf.  I guarantee there will be hacked voting machines in large liberal cities.
But Trump is suing to kill Obamacare, and has no plan to replace it with.  So he claims, falsely, that he can protect pre-existing with an EO. I guarantee there's no lawyer in the White House who believes that will fly, but they don't care, if they can get people to believe it.

There is a man not in a mask passing out mask at the Trump country club rally. Just for show. I'm sure that's what they are telling the sheep as pass them out. Smh
He only appointed Dejoy (who spent millions on Trump) bc he thought slowing down the mail would help him win. Then he realized it would also discourage his supporters from mail in voting. Which is why he said Florida has a GREAT infrastructure in place. Anything to win.
If Trump can wave his magic executive order and do what Congress can't/won't we might as well send everyone else home and bow to the dictator Trump.
None of us do.  He was appointed bc Trump expected him to help him win the election. Till he realized trashing mail in voting would cost HIM a ton of votes too! That's why he backtracked on Florida. He needs the retirees votes! Any dirty work to win. It's still cheating.
I don‚Äôt think even the anti-Christ will say his opponent ‚Äúis against God‚Äù.  Too obvious who he is. But #Trump says that.
Thank you. I appreciate it and hope to hear a lot from you. Vote Red and support Trump.
Ok. I've had my fill. Going to pour a large gin and tonic. Maybe follow with Mogadons to calm down.   This man is so unwell.

Priority costs more. Time sensitive stuff shouldnt cost more bc the receiver will have to pay for it regardless. Dejoy has many interests in the USPS competitors. IE; investments. And he has donated MILLIONS to trump. Imagine that! üôÑ

President Trump imploring people who have had Covid and recovered to donate plasma.  This is used as a therapeutic for those currently battling Covid.  Please if you or someone you know can donate you can save a life.
My analysis of the trump executive order on student loans: til further notice might mean he wants to suspend payments and interest til the election, and if he loses then he wants to restart payments so Democrats can't extend the freeze until September 2021.
Trump put this guy in place, hoping that these cuts would help Trump win. In saying that mail in voting was too easy to hack, he planted the seed so he could scream if dems win. He forgot he needs his fans to trust mail in and absentee too. Which is why he backtracked on Florida.
The Trump administration wants the country to fall apart. So they can try to throw martial law on the people in November to keep them from the polls. We dont get this yet? Ok.

My ‚Äúideology?‚Äù Best exemplified by Liberation theology is what led to Donald Trump? Well that‚Äôs a laugh. A nice try but more accurately it‚Äôs the consistent voting for the lesser of 2 evils, as you promote, that has led to this absence of an adequate, let alone good, choice.
I've noticed that many people age 65-85 or so are trump supporters, but the majority of the people I've met who are 90-105 years old are extremely democratic. Doesn't mean anything I'm sure, but just an observation.
Masks are #ThingsMorePopularThanTrump.   Unfortunately there are still idiots. Apparently... There's a global conspiracy to get red hat wearing neckbeards to wear a mask but no one seems to be able to explain what the gov's strategy is.
Trump even said he was open to supporting the $600 UI benefit. All Republicans had to do was say yes. They did not. Congress must work harder for us. If I‚Äôm still paying their salary off of my unemployment checks, they deserve to show up for me.

Trump and the criminal GOP.
Trump and the GOP are literally traitors and should be tried in a court of law.
I've thought this for weeks. Trump should issue EOs that help the working class whether legal or not. Force the Dems to take him to court, to stop what the country needs.  Also, how many lockdown orders would stand up in court? That's not stopping the Left. Play by their rules.
Trump can only win by cheating, and he knows it.
Trump and the GOP are traitors in the literal sense.
I look forward to your statement encouraging   to immediately turn over DNA evidence in this case.
I can only hope the truth is revealed by  AG Barr before the election with a boatload of indictments coming out of the Durham investigations and his upcoming report to right so many wrongs that we have all seen since Trump was elected!!
Don‚Äôt be sucked into the disgusting Dem web! This is all planned by the Dems! So many Dems need to be held accountable that started before Trump was elected with spying on his campaign by the Obama Administration.

Joe Biden is clearly racist. He just knows how to cover it up way better than Trump. And that‚Äôs what white Democrats do.
I get that Gizmodo hates Trump, but why are we still involved in these countries?  Why can't we move on?  How many people have been assassinated under Trump vs. Obama?  Why did Obama claim the right to assassinate US citizens when they are abroad?
Sure is a lot of white privilege in that photo of AG Bill Barr campaigning for tRump's police state. Did Putin turn down their invitation? #CorruptGOP

So all this money Trump was in charge of distributing to help businesses and unemployed...with no oversight....is being passed to his political allies for their action....
Correct. And Donald Trump does not define Facts in the United States of America.
My emphasis nowadays is more on building a coalition in Congress, and what I've settled on is that Trump would definitely veto good legislation that needs done like M4A and Green New Deal, but I don't think Biden would
I'm honest and don't have any  hesitation of admitting I was wrong. In over 3.5 years has Trump took any actions that every American has benefited from his acts? Stimulus aide doesn't count because it was congressional approved. Trump only acts.
Are we finally to the point where people start pointing out that Trump actually is one of ‚Äúthe elite?‚Äù
Does Trump have something on you? Like a pee tape? A tape of your dad shooting Kennedy? A picture of your wife before plastic surgery?

And you know what they wanted to do how? Bc of what Trump told you they wanted to do? It was already here. He just needed to feed Americans some crap to keep his ratings up. He clearly doesn't care at all. Or he'd something meaningful instead of "it'll go away"
While you think trump is one of the best? That's a crock of shit. When a reporter asked Trump what he would say to Americans scared of covid he said "you're a terrible reporter. That's what I say, what a nasty question". Seriously?!?
Trump is the biggest scandal and most corrupt person ever
The Republicans don‚Äôt seem to wannna tell Daddy Trump that.
Biden‚Äôs message was clear to me.   The white community is very divided over Trump.  The Latino community is less so but somewhat divided.  The black community is united in opposition of Trump.  Good for them. They‚Äôre the smartest among us and are most affected by Trump‚Äôs racism.

Imagine Texas and Georgia being toss ups.  Imagine Florida leaning blue.  Trump has ruined the GOP.
(But seeing as Trump is going to paint that picture regardless, and Sanders is already speaking and AOC has already endorsed, probably might as well have her speak since they‚Äôre not going to avoid Trump‚Äôs attacks either way.)
Will be very interesting to see how they decide on AOC. On one hand, no doubt it could be an effective endorsement that would fire up young progressives. On the other, it‚Äôs a ready-made Trump ad at a time when Trump is already trying to paint Biden as a puppet of AOC and Sanders.
My hope is a stabalization of US politics.  Polarization leads to conflict and eventual collapse.  Trump used conflict on the right to inject polarization, get elected, then dismantle the structures that protects people like us from people like him. No idea what biden did wrong..

Absolutely. Trump is more of a national security threat than TikTok. He‚Äôs all about revenge.
I can only go on by what I see. I felt Trump would win in 2016 because of all of the Democrats I knew who were voting for him. Those voters were inclined to stay with him until Covid. It has been so poorly handled that those voters are staying away from the R‚Äôs.

The thing that makes the USA special, but in this case hurt us, is that we are really 50 different countries under an umbrella.  Technically, Trump's job was to keep the virus from crossing the border (impossible). In that case, every world leader would be shitty at their job.

I believe Trump is afraid he is going to lose the election. That is why he tweeted that, and said that.  Also, he thought that if given more time, he can swing more votes his way.  But who knows when it comes to this president lol
1/1 Dear President Trump, why is it that the Democratic Party can get away with any crime? Are they above the law of which the rest of Americans must abide in? People who have had information against the Clintons keep mysteriously being murdered, including Biden.
Biden is a corrupt disaster; Even his sentences are corrupt to the point that they make no sense.  President Trump had a good run and I supported him for quite awhile, but he just can't get it done...just too much arguing between him and the false media and others alike.
The commentators just called Anthony Davis, Javale McGee, and Dwight Howard The Trump Towers

Remember, Trump is bad and Biden and the Democrats will win everything! How dare you disagree with us!
Yeah Trump‚Äôs totally only up 9 in KY and up 5 in SC. Sure....
It‚Äôll go one of two ways. Either Biden wins and steps down after inauguration or trump wins by a landslide. Personally i think it‚Äôll go the first way. Fact is trump wouldn‚Äôt even have that chance if Bernie was nominated
As soon as Trump stops acting like a petulant child he‚Äôll be treated as an adult.
She‚Äôs a former ‚Äúmodel‚Äù, ( hooker?).I‚Äôve seen her pictures, and this ‚Äúmodel‚Äùlooks as though she is would do anything for the American dollar.  It seems she‚Äôs still practicing for our pervert in chief. She has the goods on Trump, but has him over the barrel, negotiating more cash.
Growing up on the south side of Chicago doesn‚Äôt qualify Michelle as privileged.  She worked earning everything. Trump was coddled, given hundreds of millions of dollars, squandering it again and again. Daddy bought him an undeserved Ivy League education bailing him out as failed.
Obama was intelligent, capable, classy and respectable.  That‚Äôs why Trump supporters hate him.  Trump is someone so stupid that it makes his supporters feel good about the losers that they are.
Michelle used the word, ‚Äúdispirited ‚Äú because she has a better grasp of our language and it‚Äôs subtle nuances.  Whether Obama addressed Russian interference is inconsequential to the present situation with Trump, who actively seeks it out.  Trump‚Äôs treason should be your concern.
Those who cherish our country and want to see true equality for all are sickened by the events transpiring each day.  Your depression is understandable.  All of us who truly care fight to keep our spirit from sinking, hoping that we can remove Trump and his ilk, righting America.
That's what Trump said...

Only the incredibly ill informed or unbelievably stubborn, or stupid voters will hang on and vote for Trump. They, in refusing to acknowledge that have been conned, allow themselves to be preyed upon again &amp; again. The more informed voter no longer can be taken advantage of.
Kanye what a joke. Trump‚Äôs as crazy as he is. Reps have all become grifters. Learning from the feet of the master. vote people vote. In massive numbers, so massive Trump can‚Äôt do enough crooked deals fast enough to question his loss.
This is the truth.  Trump can only con you for so long.  Vote for a man of integrity. Vote for Biden to rid America of the Trump plague.
Your teenage daughter has more integrity than you will possess. You daily lie about things that can kill Americans. You know that Trump is a terrible person, destroying America, &amp; yet you remain complicit in his treasonous Putin  alliance. You better hope that there is no Hell.

Trump this time has backed the truck up to the front door of the WH. Why bother using the back door? He is cleaning us out as fast as he can In case he can‚Äôt cheat his way to another 4 yrs. Kodak? Really? I mean really? Republicans, REPUBLICANS STEP UP!

DO BETTER  I get that about 60% of the Dem Party (which only represents about 30% of Reg. voters) was able to temporarily quell a #PoliticalRevolution, but YOU DO NOT HAVE A MANDATE, and you are the only option to stop Trump‚Äôs re-election. Please don‚Äôt blow this!
At this point, I'm in the camp of "anyone but Trump," but that attitude can backfire for society. After all, Trump got elected mostly because he was running against Hillary Clinton. A lot of people either grudgingly voted for Trump or stayed home altogether.
The Senators who allowed this traitor to remain in office will be known as accomplices who refused to save our country from this treasonous man. They will be known throughout history as the cowards in fear of Trump,&amp; their names will be reviled as individuals who abetted treason.
Save America from total destruction by Trump. Neither Bernie nor anyone else should get your vote if you really care about the fate of our democracy.  Failure to cast a vote for Biden is tantamount to casting one in favor of Trump,the fascistpiece of shit destroying our country.
Only Fox who will lie for Trump will be allowed.  God forbid that the truth would be reported.

Sorry, cant tell who you are talking about. Trump or Biden? Only one has wished maxwell well. Only one is being investigated for fraud. Only one one cant run a charity....bc of fraud. And only one was elected BECAUSE he is an asshole.
Grotesque and Disgusting is only part of it. Its disturbing, unethical, ridiculous, unacceptable,  and hideous. Plump Trump is the epitamy of narcissism, and sociopathic behavior. He is incapable of remorse. IT IS WHAT IT IS!!!

We need to ensure that Trump can‚Äôt steal the election through massive voter fraud with help from foreign dictators with whom he identifies and through his manipulation of the voter system.  It has already begun and it will only get worse. How do we save our Democracy?
Set Trump up to create low unemployment numbers and took credit for it
I despise Trump and I will happily tell him exactly why if he has an hour or two
I talked with 2 yesterday. Another problem is many aren't hearing anything from Biden. If it was 2016 you would see clips from his rallies on the news at least. Trump is on TV every day
Wow. The last sentence says it all. This is a joke and SNL should have a field day with all the Democrat insanity. Instead, they waste every episode trying to belittle Trump. So many people are tired of it.

One person can infect a dozen, who will infect others. It may not be bad today, but exponential Covid infections could easily reach hundreds, then thousands. Remember in January when Trump said only one person had it? Now 156,000 lay dead and over 4,500,000 have tested positive.
The point is Trump‚Äôs an idiot. Sad you need an explanation.
If his mouth is moving, Trump‚Äôs lying.
I have a seething hatred for Trump &amp;his henchmen. They collect fat salaries while Americans are suffering, wondering when their eviction notice will come, where food will come from to feed their children, who have lost loved ones to Covid.His answer, ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù. Horrible.

Keeps on getting more embarrassing! I didn‚Äôt think it could keep getting worse about 3 years ago.  Trump just keeps heaping on stupidity.

By U.S. getting a cut, what Trump really means is that HE gets a cut. Screwing everyone who isn‚Äôt his family or himself, then grabbing as much money as  possible (often by by illegal methods) is Trump‚Äôs business motto by which he has conducted his entire life.

Donald Trump killed this man with his ignorance and stupidity.  Multiply this by 156,000+ Americans.  He is a guilty of negligent homicide.
People won‚Äôt forgive or forget that they failed all Americans by not removing Trump from office when they could have saved us.  Because of their failure, thousands of Americans are dead, we march for justice, our economy is destroyed &amp; people are thrown,starving into our streets.
Wait for Trump to decide what's most politically expedient. React accordingly.
Oh Kayleigh, poor dear. Just because people are watching doesn't mean they approve of Trump. How pathetic
My Sis lives in TN &amp; I love her very much. She is a part of religious right.. The Reps have made it about abortion &amp; it‚Äôs the end of time. The 2nd coming. Trump is the Antichrist &amp; we can‚Äôt stop him. &amp; then the racist mindset. Scary times.

What anyone who refuses to vote for biden is saying is they have no long term goals. If trump remains in office he will stack the supreme court. They will remove anyone who could fight his policies. Americans who go against trump will be labeled as terrorists. The war on science
I say Trump was just like the Greg Stillson character before he took office on Twitter.
Does anyone else have that one family member who‚Äôs a trump supporter and wonder how they turned out that way?
I notice are Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has nothing to say as Trump attacks his office.  I wonder if Trump is giving him back the 2 million, he bribed Trump with to be appointed to the office.   For doing Trump's bidding.

I wish the Pope would weigh in on this one.
No, that's not correct.  A pardon can be given even before any criminal charges are filed.  Richard Nixon was pardoned by Gerald Ford with no criminal charges ever filed.  Donald Trump is considering whether he can pardon himself before he leaves office in January 2021.

Donald Trump is the WORST racist ever. (Worst in the sense that he just can't pull this racism stuff off.)
And other pardoned-by-Trump folks, including QAnon supporters. Right on.
He is appealing to those in his base who believe he was ordained by God.  So in Trump's mind, if you hurt him, you are hurting God. If you hurt him you'll lose your guns. He's pandering to his base's fear. None of it is true.
I expect debates will not happen. If they do, Kanye would make it fun. Without him, Trump will be in a battle of wits with an unarmed man.

Trump attacked the incompetence and inefficiency of the USPS for the entire time he‚Äôs been President. To say it‚Äôs simply because of mail in voting is bullüí© anyone with a brain knows that.
Trump's mad because Putin can't hack votes by mail.
Trump has taken every opportunity to mislead, distract and disinform the public if it‚Äôs from the official White House news conference, his RTs, 24 hours on FOX News or Facebook buzzing in your hand there‚Äôs lies and fantasy mixed with news. That‚Äôs Putin‚Äôs influence.
I will wait to see if #1 It's effective, #2 It's safe. I do not trust the government to roll out the first thing they have. Fox News and Trump will hail it as a miracle cure and then months later we have zombies roaming the streets. (I read too much zombie fiction)
He likely feels the same emotion that everyone in Putin‚Äôs orbit, fear, but also they share white supremacist, uber-ego, hyper misogynistic and narcissistic mindsets. Trump, blackmail or not, aspires to be as unapologetic as Putin, his criticisms and critics silenced.
Trump does not need defending. He has done quite well in the face of all the bull manure his critics have splashed around. Regardless of the 'purity' of Trump's conservatism, he is a pragmatist whose instincts lead him in the direction of a better America.
If Trump works really hard on this I think he could get 5% of the vote in DC.
Well, to keep the traitor in the White House you will need every bit of voter fraud that Putin and the Republicans can manage because without fraud Trump and the National shame he caused are over.
I still try to understand the story about repealing &amp; replacing ObamaCare? During the 2026 debate is when Trump said it will be worse under the Obama Adminnistration. Look 4- years later

The Trump campaign has weaponized that lonely fascination with celebrity - the desire to be noticed by someone important to claim some importance for oneself - which would be undone if this arm ever mentioned any political ideas the recipient might realize they disagree with.
I get a lot of emails from politicians and the difference in rhetoric between the Trump campaign and the rest to be pretty shocking. There is almost never any political content at all - it‚Äôs almost entirely like this, just claims that he has a personal stake in the recipient.

Trump has hastened the insanity of media coverage. It looks for the sensational and will report anything to try for a headline.  Where are the details in policy and the destructive deregulations and messed up trade and foreign relations that should be reported on?
If Trump was guilty of anything the media wouldn‚Äôt have to make up Russian collusion and impeachment. Think about that for a minute. They‚Äôd attack him 24/7
Think about how the media treats Trump. If they had any proof he did anything wrong you‚Äôd hear about it 24/7 for the entire 4 years of his presidency. They know he didn‚Äôt do anything, so they can‚Äôt. Instead we got fake Russia stories and fake impeachment instead

A Trump trap? He's the one who could get a boost from mail voting glitches.
Obama didn‚Äôt shake hands with anyone.  Obama only fist bumped people, because he was a germafob.  If Trump is such a germafob, then why did he fight wearing a mask so much?  Not much of a germafob in my eyes!
Trump needs to be committed!  Especially asking doctors if an injection of a disinfectant could kill the virus and with bright lights on them!  That was down right CRAZY for him even to suggest such a thing.  And some of his stupid followers tried drinking bleach and went to ERs.
Ivanka Trump butted into a conversation she was not ask her opinion about anything during this world leaders meeting and no one respects her or her father around the world or in the USA.  Republicans are even turning against him even Mitch McConnell, amazing enough.
Absolutely!  Trump sounds ignorant every time he opens his mouth about anything he knows nothing about, not just COVID-19.  He is a laughing stock all around the world for stupid things he has said to other world leaders!  Trump doesn‚Äôt need any help sounding ignorant!

There is no point to this because hypocrites like  who call Trump a liar, will never hold Biden accountable for his wrong doings and the constant lies he has told for 40 years. It‚Äôs only Orange man bad for them.
I didn‚Äôt say Trump lies, you did. I said Biden lies and you don‚Äôt care. And I can prove Biden lies becasue he has been caught plagiarizing, lied about his entire college career. He lies constantly yet you say the whole problem with Trump in a debate that he lies your a hypocrite.
That statement comes from a sh≈çnen jump scan that describes Vegito and Gogeta as equally-matched trump cards. However, that statement is contradicted many times over in the source material, so it cannot be reliably used.
I hope everyone sees this a thing between McConnell and a Trump, letting Trump look like he‚Äôs coming to the rescue. Sooooooo transparent!
Good question. I voted for a 3rd party candidate in last election as I did not trust Trump or HRC.  With Biden I trust him but worry about his mental health. I am hopeful he picks strong vp candidate.

I feel like Trump is going to let the cat out of the bag before the election.
Black lives do matter. So do all lives. Socialism and its free healthcare, which is what you are advocating for, has killed millions. Not a single instance of success in history.  Trump is fighting to make sure people like Rocky can afford and access the care they need.
If you care about Rocky you will research the plan you are supporting better. Trump‚Äôs plan will make certain your husband can always get the care. The Democrat plan will ration care and will be of no value. Free to die for lack of care. Those are your choices.
Trump has been clear at every step that preexisting conditions are protected by his plan. To say otherwise says you aren‚Äôt paying attention to his statements. So get your facts straight. My previous comment is accurate the plan you are supporting is a proven failure worldwide.
You mean the provision where everyone gets the healthcare services they need regardless of who they are or their prior history at a cost they can afford?  That is Trump‚Äôs plan. The plan you want is free sometime in the undefined future if you live long enough time get it.

Unbelievable, a mask would have protected him, so sad the disinformation Trump has spread.
as a voter I agree with Donald Trump if we cannot safely have in-person voting where IDs can be checked prior to voting due to COVID then I say postpone the elections until we are past this Global Pandemic.
I‚Äôm glad he is protected. Everyone will be protected by Trump‚Äôs plan. Today everyone is not. Biden‚Äôs Medicare for all, and that is the plan to keep Bernie supporters on board, will not protect Rocky. Ask anyone in a country who has it.Trump 2020
I hope my dad finally realizes that he has TDS and moves past his hate for Trump. This country need him and the actual Republican Party To stand up to Dems at every single point of attack. We need a fighter.  We need DJT!!!

That‚Äôs the money Trump stole from his niece ,Mary Trump, by deflating the assets awarded to her in his father‚Äôs estate. It‚Äôs also just a small down payment on the fraudulent underpayment of federal and state tax by under reporting estate/gift tax from his father‚Äôs estate.

Not voting is a vote for the worst of the two and that is Trump.

Growing up on the south side of Chicago doesn‚Äôt qualify Michelle as privileged.  She worked earning everything. Trump was coddled, given hundreds of millions of dollars, squandering it again and again. Daddy bought him an undeserved Ivy League education bailing him out as failed.
Obama was intelligent, capable, classy and respectable.  That‚Äôs why Trump supporters hate him.  Trump is someone so stupid that it makes his supporters feel good about the losers that they are.
Michelle used the word, ‚Äúdispirited ‚Äú because she has a better grasp of our language and it‚Äôs subtle nuances.  Whether Obama addressed Russian interference is inconsequential to the present situation with Trump, who actively seeks it out.  Trump‚Äôs treason should be your concern.
Those who cherish our country and want to see true equality for all are sickened by the events transpiring each day.  Your depression is understandable.  All of us who truly care fight to keep our spirit from sinking, hoping that we can remove Trump and his ilk, righting America.

At this point, I'm in the camp of "anyone but Trump," but that attitude can backfire for society. After all, Trump got elected mostly because he was running against Hillary Clinton. A lot of people either grudgingly voted for Trump or stayed home altogether.
The Senators who allowed this traitor to remain in office will be known as accomplices who refused to save our country from this treasonous man. They will be known throughout history as the cowards in fear of Trump,&amp; their names will be reviled as individuals who abetted treason.
Save America from total destruction by Trump. Neither Bernie nor anyone else should get your vote if you really care about the fate of our democracy.  Failure to cast a vote for Biden is tantamount to casting one in favor of Trump,the fascistpiece of shit destroying our country.
Only Fox who will lie for Trump will be allowed.  God forbid that the truth would be reported.

One person can infect a dozen, who will infect others. It may not be bad today, but exponential Covid infections could easily reach hundreds, then thousands. Remember in January when Trump said only one person had it? Now 156,000 lay dead and over 4,500,000 have tested positive.
The point is Trump‚Äôs an idiot. Sad you need an explanation.
If his mouth is moving, Trump‚Äôs lying.

By U.S. getting a cut, what Trump really means is that HE gets a cut. Screwing everyone who isn‚Äôt his family or himself, then grabbing as much money as  possible (often by by illegal methods) is Trump‚Äôs business motto by which he has conducted his entire life.

What anyone who refuses to vote for biden is saying is they have no long term goals. If trump remains in office he will stack the supreme court. They will remove anyone who could fight his policies. Americans who go against trump will be labeled as terrorists. The war on science

Wonder if Trump will just give up and vote for Biden.
I notice are Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has nothing to say as Trump attacks his office.  I wonder if Trump is giving him back the 2 million, he bribed Trump with to be appointed to the office.   For doing Trump's bidding.

Trump   To ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù something up.   Used in place of the word f***.
Yep, He owns XPO Logistics, a company similar to Fed X and DHL. Which should have been a conflict of interest. But Trump made him the Postmaster General. He would love to see USPS go under. And Trump put him there to sabotage the USPS. So Trump can Seal the Election in November.
I think his choices are all great. Toss the names in a hat &amp; draw. Stop all the fuss. Does the media want a cat fight? I‚Äôm sure Trump does.
So if it‚Äôs so safe to open schools, why hasn‚Äôt Trump withdrawn his kid from his private school and enrolled him in a public school that he expects to be open? If it‚Äôs safe enough for your kid, it‚Äôs safe enough for his kid. Can‚Äôt have it both ways, buddy.

Well, considering Trump's attitude toward Americans dying due to the virus, this makes sense.
Stupid question, but how can Trump possibly take unilateral action on a tax, when that is the sole purvue of Congress?
So, we now know that both Trump and DeSantis are super spreaders.
This pretty much describes everything Trump says.
Just a coincidence that Trump votes by mail in Florida, right?
Lewis never trafficked underage girls (aka "rape victims") for Trump and his like-minded friends, unlike Ghislaine. His bad.
Trump supporters are angry because Swan abused him so badly.
Here's another theory: The GOP has a closed-door nomination to put Pence on the ticket, citing Trump's mental decline. Trump goes along b/c he can maybe use it to avoid prosecution (unfit to stand trial). Thus the rise of a true dominionist regime under President Pence.
Probably a coincidence, but doesn't Trump vote by mail in Florida?

Oh, you get me sister. You really do. I've never thought Corden was funny. Not even before the Trump virus spread across America and wiped out the buffalo.
True. The one thing a government should never do is give the religious faction too much power. They don't really care much about others, just their own self interest. The Senate learned it was easy to control Trump so they've been going right without restriction. That has to end.
I read it. Here's my thought process. Trump is evil as fuk. He has to be voted out. If there was a better option that Biden, I'd choose it. If Bernie was still running, I'd vote for him over Biden no problem. But right now, I'm voting for the one person that can beat Trump.

Trump: It's safe to go back to school. DeVos: Kids are immune DeSantis: They'll go to school. Maybe they'll get it. They'll get it, but then they'll go home and get over it. McEnany: The President wants kids in school because somehow living at home with their parents is worse?
Challenge Trump to take that cognition test live on TV.  Biden can take it right alongside him.  Trump likes gameshows, let's have one.
Me? haha. Funny. Right now there are two republican parties, Trump Republicans and real Traditional Republicans. Trumps people only know how to attack. There is no substance to them. They're shallow and beyond self introspection.
You played a doctor in Fever Pitch so I would trust your word over any expert who's stayed in Trump's good graces long enough to still be on any task force.
True that. Right now, Trump is swinging an invisible ghost. With no one to tear down or no one for the public see react to Trump's attacks, Trump is left with no choice but to promote himself through his achievements of which he has none.
After Trump is voted out of office, we should make sure to edit our history books &amp; refer to him as 45 instead of by name since hearing his name brings him some measure of joy. We can't afford to forget the evil he's perpetrated, but let's not use his name to reference him.
History should remember him as 45 not President Trump. Don't gift him the joy of having his name entered in our history books. Refer to him as 45 and tell future generations about the evil 45 inflicted on our Democracy and Republic.
What Trump deserves is Hitler level historic infamy. Like how the Nazi symbol in Germany is illegal, so to should Trump's likeness. No statues. No libraries. No memorial coins. He should be stricken from history because being remembered is all he cares about. Deny him that.
Probably. It's best Biden doesn't participate in Trump's game show.
The most frustrating thing a bully can face is a victim that never reacts. There's not satisfaction in it. Without Biden standing there reacting to Trump, all America sees is all the different ways Trump is trying to beat up an opponent that has risen above the mud slinging.

If lying or making misleading statements is a grounds to not debate someone well, there will never be another political debate if those are the Rules of Joe.  But isn't Biden the guy who lies and doesn't even KNOW it?
I would blame the media who said Trump had no chance to beat Hillary. The failure of polling probably had the most outsized impact. Also, more people voted for neither Trump nor Hillary. 46% of registered voters stayed home.

Right so who is she voting for? Because the republican option is trump? So I‚Äôd like to know how you figure she is going anywhere else. Is she going to write someone in? Please expand on her broken and toe-brained logic
It does when a vast majority of the current republicans have done NOTHING but allow him to get away with the crimes he has perpetrate for the last four years. It also does when your only republican choice is trump..... you shouldn‚Äôt have to have this explained.
How high does the body count have to go?   How many lives must be ruined? Trump continues to do nothing!  He needs to disappear now!!! #TedSpeaksTheTruth
Don't forget energy. Trump: Biden is against energy  Fact Check: Biden lives in a house with electricity.
Not ignoring Trump just pointing out hypocrisy. Obama says 58 states and media says slip of the tongue. Biden says black crack, you ain't black, etc and media ignores. Trump says Thigh land and the world is supposed to end. Pols can't admit mistakes, including your Biden.
And you think Trump's mentality is better??
At traitor John Lewis funeral he turned it into Trump bashing and Biden campaigning.
Stay with me... Trump. He is galvanizing people to act. I hope it is enough to cause a real change.
There is quite a difference In leveling accusations of racism, which Dems do to Trump constantly and pointing out real racist comments. I hate to break it to you but your monoculture comment is a racist one just like Biden‚Äôs comments were.
On please let Trump be the first and last.
And just to be clear, most whites who voted Trump are not racists, sexists, homophobic, or in any way, shape or form anything other than decent Americans who voted their conscience. Had you in the media said this fact just once in 3 1/2 years, we don‚Äôt have the divide we do now.
When did Biden? What is different between when Trump says "that's not what I said" and Biden saying  "in no way did I mean to imply"?
Great summary: ¬†In the Russiagate narrative, as a candidate and then as the president, Trump was the perp, not the victim. They weren‚Äôt looking to warn him. They were looking to nail him ‚Äî or, at least, to persuade the country that he just might be a Russian mole.
Name 10 things Obama did that were good for America and name ten things trump did that was bad? I bet you would get them confused
So America is basically a Trump hotel, in the eyes of the rest of the world
Scratching my head here. It is like you didn't read either Biden's tweet or mine. You know damn well you'd never give Trump a pass, let alone the praise you're giving Biden.
Trump hasn't fallen; he's always lived in the sewer.
I almost liked your tweet and then I saw you support Trump.  What kind of delusional bitch insults one these guys intelligence but likes the other?
Trump is a p*ssy. He doesn‚Äôt give a crap about anyone‚Äôs safety. He is doing this becaysw its a platform where he has no control. He got trolled at the Tulsa rally &amp; people like  expose his dumbassery.
üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇüòÇ You know little children are immune to the Rona!  They only get sick and die because they don‚Äôt like trump
I would inject myself with SARS-CoV-2 to vote Trump out.
Because, rather than acknowledging that COVID-19 was here to stay Trump decided that one day it would ‚Äújust go away.‚Äù Therefore, instead of making education a priority &amp; concentrating on ramping up access to technology &amp; instruction he just blew it off.
How about some questions about the Constitution in the debates? ‚ÄúMr Trump please discuss your thoughts on the checks and balances of the 3 branches of the Federal Government‚Äù.
Biden didn't say he made a mistake or that he was wrong. He said that's not what he meant. Had Trump said the same thing media would be attacking him right now, not praising like they are with Biden.
I will wait in a box, I will wait with a fox.  I will wait in my car, I will wait in a bar.  I will wait in a line, I will wait because my vote is mine. I want Trump gone on November 3, I want Trump gone to set us all free.
As far as Trump knows there could have been ‚Äúthree Corinthians or four Corinthians, maybe five‚Äù.  He speaks of the word Corinthians as if it meant 2 Corinthians walking down the street.  What a sham he is.
Trump signs executive orders banning transactions with #TikTok and #WeChat  via
Trump banning Tiktok is the greatest thing he's done as president
Ok. Let‚Äôs start from the top down. Let‚Äôs have all the maga and trump wear be manufactured here in the United States.
Yes, but only if they take a test for cocaine first.
Does Donald Trump pull out his centurion card and make a copay every time he gets tested?
I will... by voting for Joe Biden! Btw everyone watch the axios hbo interview. I think everyone should watch it before November.btw, I think you did great on it Donald Trump, and yes.. that‚Äôs sarcasm
We are good and I admire you for stating it out front.  Marxist BLM doesn't care about racial inequality or police brutality.  It's the left continued efforts to down Trump.
Pointing out things Biden is doing wrong isn't us helping Trump,  it is Biden helping Trump
Team trump 2020
You go Texas.  No no Trump
DUMB move. Instead of picking somebody like Barbara Lee, a progressive US House member without a ‚Äúscandal‚Äù, would‚Äôve been far better. Instead Joe is trying to resurrect the Obama Administration, the same one that Americans were disappointed with and idiotically voted for Trump.
I will never vote Trump.  Not because of party but because he, as a person, is morally corrupt and a sociopath.
He doesn‚Äôt care about Missourians, just licking Trump‚Äôs boots.
Is #Bloomberg supporting the #DemocraticParty to defeat trump, as he said he would?
We need to oust Trump &amp; over time work with allies to economically &amp; financially isolate Russia, China &amp; other authoritarian countries from community of nations.

Actually, McCain did next to nothing against Trump. It makes me sad how people ignore what all McCain let happen.
you have said you‚Äôre not voting for ‚Äúsmall man‚Äù Trump. But why won‚Äôt you say you‚Äôre voting for the man you know to be a good and decent man? You know in your heart  will do a great job leading this nation.
Trump drove 50 million people out of their jobs
After Trump was elected but before entering the WH, Democrats were busy forming a resistance, boycotting the inauguration, forming ‚Äúnot my president‚Äù street protests &amp; planning his impeachment. #shameful
Trump hasn't made up any lies about them criminals. He just spent 3 1/2 years building an economy that was moving great lowest unemployment ever. All while the criminals made up fake impeachment. A fake Mueller report! And now they're blowing up covid like it's the plague
I‚Äôm confident people would give up their life to get trump out of office lmao 8 hours is nothing
What positive is there to say? They aren't Trump?
I just had a customer ask me if I was voting Biden or Trump in November. First of all, sir, this is a recorded line. Secondly, you couldn‚Äôt pay me vote for Trump.
It isn't to HURT Biden, it's to HELP Trump! That is the mindset we must use...  #KayneWest
There's no way they'll come down from the anti-Trump high until at least a few months after the election.
Wow!! Not only is Biden an atheist, but some type of god himself that can hurt god and hurt the Bible. How can trump beat such a foe?
Of course it‚Äôs all about Trump and his buddies making millions!
Cannot stress this enough, Trump can still win this election.

Trump Donors: Don't Be Don's Next Con  via
Oh boy. I was prepared for her to go after the tRump crime syndicate. Instead she went off on the   criminal so why the hell couldn't she wait until November 4? This is the kind of shit that can get out of hand really fast and it can also swing elections.
Trump is even more independent of the left. Why don‚Äôt you vote for him???
Have you looked into how taxpayer money trump has stolen or how much in campaign donations he's siphoned off into his own pocket. Trump is in debt to china, russia, iraq and MBS to the tune of Billions which is why he rolls over like a dog for them.
NY Attorney General trying to dissolve NRA better not screw up the election to get Trump out of office. I can already see him spinning this the Democrats want to get rid of your guns
Wasn't even about Trump and it's still ripe with politics. Come on AG James, you can do better. #IstandwiththeNRA
If this "Major Announcement" from NY AG Ms. James has anything to do with Trump, it better not be partisan or political.

Another example of trump constantly misleading the public  #DonsNextCon #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpTheDisaster
Someone please explain to me how the trump/pence ticket has ANY supporters? They don't eventry to hide their blatant disregard for public health  #TrumpKillsUS
trump continues to lie about things so easily verifiable he can only be either incredibly stupid or believe YOU are so incredibly stupid you won't fact check him.  Either one is a terrible quality for a president. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpTheDisaster
This should surprise no one but trump is wrong. Hannity's book is NOT number 1.  That spot still belongs to Dr. Mary Trump! #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Yeah no. Trump is just one money laundering errand boy among many. He‚Äôs another mid level gangster to squeeze as we go after his masters. You bet they‚Äôll take him down. But only as a necessary domino. We‚Äôre after the big fish.
Dear  : This is an international health crisis you‚Äôre failed miserably to manage. Trump/GOP did demonstrate why it is time to restructure America. We call it saving America #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Quite possibly the first time the words "public service" have ever been uttered by the president - could this signal the long-anticipated "change in tone" for Mr. Trump?
Bizarre.  won the election and has held the office of President of the United States for almost 4 years! None of this is relevant to the issues today and tomorrow. Trump's SWAMP stole from the Treasury. That's relevant!

What's your point? #Trump supporters get death threats every single second of every single day. We get harassed by people like you who spread lies constantly. You are the enemy of the people. You made your bed and you will lie in it.
C'mon, Paul. Ted Cruz is not very smart. If Trump takes a sharp turn, Cruz gets his nose broken.  That just is not smart.
The US has 4,828,660 confirmed cases of the virus, in the last week 1 person died of #COVID19 every 80 seconds. The University of Washington computer model, the one used most often by Trump, indicates that by November 1, 230,822 Americans will die of the coronavirus. #failure
#TrumpsNextCon we knew Kanye couldn't be a serious candidate but seeing the direct link to trump shows that none of them think Americans are smart enough to not be so easily fooled!
Trump deserves an extra term to replace this first the Dems and liberal media shit on and destroyed...every hour of every day.
I have a serious question...would Zuckerberg have risked pissing tRump off if he thought the Russian fix was going to work for him this time? I think this is a solid sign he's toast.
Wouldnt he first have to have the support of the black community in order to take votes from Biden? I mean he had crowdfund his last album, how much support from the black community do you think he actually has, if anything he's taking votes from trump.
Missouri. And almost everyone I know. ALL ages, ALL Trump:)
Told a man that he needed to pull his mask up, his response? "you fucking liberal."  Not surprisingly he was wearing a Trump 2020 mask.

Deal with WHO the right way by NOT giving them funding and that‚Äôs what Trump did!
Trump you have not done shit for LGBTQ rights!
When multiple "competitors" back up  at what point will trump &amp; his cronies that there is no loyalty in his inner circle so he can't run from the truth any longer!
Unfortunately that‚Äôs one of the most deadly democratic spun lies is that Trump is sold out in anyway to Putin! He is not now and never has been! That was proven completely false when all the documents were released after the Democrats attempt at impeachment.
I believe that Bill Kristol asked about 150 thousand Americans that have died on Trump‚Äôs watch. Neither Biden or Hunter have gone into hiding. By the way, have you been in his basement? Were you spying? I do believe someone should check you out.  Becky
Except what you're calling "narrative" is fact and has been around thousands of years. You're dumb enough to believe what trump and Fox tell ypu to believe and they know it and have been using it against you. Next time try better grammar, you might make more sense.
Let US not forget that republicans in office hold responsibility for everything that is going on right now. They had the chance to stop trump and or remove trump several times and sat on their hands and they as well as trump own all of this
With all due respect, save for 1 days spike in July this is a positive graph any credible journalist should be praising.  Steady and declining.  You will use anything to criticize the Trump and Parson governments, even if it means lying about the stats anyone can see.
The stock market crash was during the Bush arministration.  It is absolutely shocking how much a trump supporters lie.  Not sure is you can read a chart, but it would be easy for you to look up the Djia trends.

Fixed it for you, you are welcome.  According to sources close to Trump, he is spending his day increasingly isolated, in a rage, lashing out, and seizing repeatedly over this tweet.  Those around him worry he is suffering a complete breakdown and the walls are closing in.
Funny how everyone thinks Trump is to blame, no acknowledgement for taking this unprecedented road unlike Obama and Biden /w H1M1 stopped testing and gave up when Americans needed help!
you are so biased in your hate of Trump  you are not  legitimate  resign Hatefilled woman.
No, and I refuse to speak of him or refer to him in that way.  He‚Äôs just Trump.
I would preferred to live at least until January that way we can see Trump defeated in November and kicked out of office
Somewhere, a Biden staffer:  "Joe! You will not die! Trump is President! You are not Trump, Joe!"
Twice the tRump four times the confusion and lies.
And Trump is a soon-to-be felon.
Lmao it‚Äôs always funny when liberals make excuses when the reality is Trump will wipe the floor with Biden. It‚Äôs also funny that Biden lies constantly, even had to drop out of a presidential bid in 80s for lying, yet they don‚Äôt care that he lies. Ok kid
should NOT debate Trump. It would only encourage him.
I have often wished that Trump would spontaneously combust, but alas, my wish always goes as well as Trump's wishes do.

It's China's virus and thank God that President Trump cut off travel from China despite you libs disagreeing with him.
Who's going to pay for these illegals (not undocumented -- call it what it is).  How about a debate with President Trump.  Why are you hiding?  Go ask your puppeteer if you can play.
I'm not sure a group of at most what? 40 house members constitute a ruling party. And if those who lick Trump's boots as he sends invasion forces into American cities seem like libertarians, maybe look into your definition. The Soviet Union called itself a republic.
But you're right we gove up easily which is why we can now get married. You want talk aboout giving up easily, look to your lord and savior trump. He rolled over to coronavirus, china, russia. Iraq, MBS and any other dictator that would allow him to cozy on up..

You can't reason with Trump supporters. Finally had to block the delusional nut.
Trump likes Kobach. All but one of the R candidates claimed to love Trump. But Kobach the most. Wonder what that says about his loss. Marshall is weak. Bollier is much stronger. The PACs will try to slam her but will look bad trying.
He further stated that he (Trump) had done more for African Americans than anyone in  American history.
Donald Trump recently completed an interview with Jonathan Swann of Axios News. During the interview, he was asked a question related to honoring John Lewis. He said he did not know John Lewis, and did not honor him, because he (John Lewis) refused to attend his inauguration
He is an incompetent interviewer and those questions were ridiculously bad. It is funny that you all think this will hurt Trump. When will you all learn that you make Trump look better by acting like this journalist?

re Biden fact check so  is lying?
I dunno....i tend to expect better from a bot since they are programed and have access to all the info at once and have algorithms writen that basically tell them what to say. We should expect more from the bots trump buys with our tax money.
Probably not. Seriously. He's that awful. He actually called one of his opponents a "squish" in one of his commercials and brags that he's more Trumpy than trump.
You are aware they were handed a recession when they took office and handed trump one of the economies ever. Not to mention the ACA. What more do you need to hear that you oviously cant go check the white house records for? What more can i spoonfeed you child?

Talk to trump about when his payments to China Bank are due on his loan. We may have already paid those loans off for him though.
It's basically those Daily Show interviews at Trump Rallies where the reporter constantly trips up the attendees, taken at face value, it's fucking incredible.
Watching  interview of idiot Trump and   First thought- Why does Trump ALWAYS wear high water pants? Is it because he is in that swamp he can't seem to drain?
Tell that to Trump.  He excels at fomenting violence.  He sent his version of Hitler's Brown shirts uninvited to cities where they acted like gestapo.  He urged violent treatment by the police! #TedSpeaksTheTruth

Trump is a fucking idiot.  He has done nothing for anyone but himself.
Why is this lost of things trump has already done being labeled as Bidens tax plan? I had my suspicions the GOP couldnt read and this confirms it.
Its you who's holding everything up for unrelated shit like 377million for a west wing reno and money for a new FBI building to protect trump tower from neighboring competition. Try telling your constituents the truth for once before you are thrown from the Senate for good.
Unfortunately the Democrats will back them up...anything to beat President Trump

I see all these people trying to rebut Trump and (rightfully) defend the safety of voting by mail, but I don't think that's the point of his accusations. All he needs to do is plant doubt in his followers' minds and they run with it.

I always watched, but I just can't stand anymore Trump spin. You're doing Fox's work. I get that. But please stop with the "just calling balls and strikes" bs. You're not and you're smart enough to know it. Join Chris Wallace and Shep Smith and stand up to the Murdochs.

So you fear pick-up trucks and Trump.  Anything else you want to admit to?
I believe many of those so called anarchists were sent in from the right.  Look up the real reasons Trump wants a new building.  It may not sit too well with you.
So you want Trump‚Äôs help?
And Trump‚Äôs new FBI building in the Republicans suggested package?  Guess that‚Äôs Coronavirus related, right?
So Trump said.  I‚Äôd believe the talking chicken in my neighbor‚Äôs yard befor I believed Trump.
There's a small army of KCPD, Jackson County Sheriff Department and Trump's secret police at the end of my block. No idea what's going on.

Its almost like the give trump graphs and papers that say what he wants them to in order to distract him while the adults talk but he keeps interrupting so the adults cant get anything done. Though we all know he's really just stupid
She owns and runs a novelty shop in Chicago. She sells Trump toilet paper
If the tRump administration doesn't count black and brown people,  then they won't exist for ten years.
Trump looks like He's about to lose his ever loving mind because the interviewer wont just shut up and take his word for it.
That should be the number 1 reason in itself. Because he isn‚Äôt Trump!
They are the least paid and easy targets for trump folks. Trump folks want to start a war of rich and poor. Not white and white. The poorest of the poor work at burger king. They want to establish domination over the weak to turn them to trump.  SS tactics
Schools will reopen in person in areas where Districts can‚Äôt withstand the financial hit that results from Trump &amp; Gov‚Äôs threatening to withhold funding. Within 3-4 weeks they will close because hospitals will be at capacity &amp; there won‚Äôt be enough teachers alive to staff them.

Granted the Queen would most likely knight Biden thats not the point. He waa talking to a child and got down on thier level to speak with that child. Unlike trump he just rapes them and throws money at them and makes threats on thier families before leaving afterwards.
Big news... not so much. Just another day in the administration of Trump.
Trump, do you even like yourself?  You shouldn‚Äôt. Becky
Trump has been an empty vessel for the past 3 years. He is surrounded by empty headed yes men. Voters will vote for Biden because he will be a strong leader. A leader that won‚Äôt blame everyone else for his lack of knowledge in everything. Becky
I will not relent until you answer for the enormously hypocritical stance you are taking, ‚Äúhating‚Äù trump; yet proudly and boldly spreading his ignorant hate and rhetoric. You are directly endangering the lives of innocent Americans. STOP!

He never closed travel from china or europe. He "restricted" it and even those restrictions were full of hole. Even Fox news reported on it so im suprised you didnt hear about this.

I can‚Äôt wait to spend my trump bucks on this
While trump hides behind 12foot walls in the white house and tweets lies and conspiracy theories from the bunker because he's afraid of the American people.  Why would Biden waste money on huge events when trump is winning Bidens campaign for him anyways?
I dont think we have anything to worry about. Trump will be lucky of he last till November.
She does hate Trump but even scarier is that she cares nothing about the American people.

Good they all see Trump getting away with shit so they are doing it
There‚Äôs a special kind of arrogant ignorance that Trump supporters have. I won‚Äôt argue with somebody who chooses to be stupid.
Trump is Tampering with the Election. Illegal. And Immoral in a democracy. Deserves prosecution.
Boy, this Dr. on  -- I  believe his name is Bernard Ashby -- has had e-fucking-nuff of tRump acting like a snake oil salesman and undermining science. If I ever have the opportunity, Ima buy him a beer.  -- tell him. I'm good for it.

That is why you will lose. , we don't want a Fascist government! Trump was a criminal way before the GOP allowed Putin to install him!

How do Trump supporters not die from embarrassment?
I love your feed. I hate pressing like because I hate all the lies you report from Trump. There has to be a way to say "I am sad with you" and want you to keep shining a light on his incompetence without me feeling like I'm "liking" it.  Keep up the good work,

Well fox polling sucks. There‚Äôs only a couple polls that got it right in 2016 and they have trump winning. Hold on I‚Äôll find a link
Even FOX is doubted by him, if it's something unfavorable about Trump. Basically if it's not a glossed-over, vague article kissing Trump's ass, he doesn't trust it. Even refuses to believe the Trumps stole from a kid's cancer charity--- even though NY court logs have records!!
President Trump Reinstates 10% Aluminum Tariffs On Canada After They Renege On Promise &amp; Flood U.S. Market, Effectively Killing American¬†Jobs
Basically, ‚Äúwhy would you expect me to support your confidante when you are the kind of smug, condescending person who hates me?‚Äù If you think of Trump as a giant middle finger it makes more sense.
Polls are wrong. The accurate polls have trump winning. Also trump is coming back in polls the last couple weeks. He‚Äôll win slight more points then in 2016
Still the best explanation for Trump.
I also thought it was a photo of Trump with a SS logo on his head for a second.
‚ÄúThe NeverTrump movement has never been about philosophical or ideological differences; it‚Äôs always been about pursuing personal revenge against Donald Trump beating the D.C. establishment at its own game‚Äù
You have yet to give me evidence of trump sitting back and doing nothing! If you‚Äôre going to argue give factual reasons!
If trump shut things down you guys would say he‚Äôs a tyrant. Trump can‚Äôt win because he‚Äôll get criticized no matter what. When he said it is what it is he meant that there will be deaths no matter what, we can‚Äôt do anything about that. It‚Äôs a freakin pandemic.
It‚Äôs not Trumps job to lock anyone down, that‚Äôs the job of the individual states. Trump did everything he could and more, he closed our borders early, he supplied all hospitals with more then enough supplies, and he put in the stimulus bill to keep our economy afloat.
Trump isn‚Äôt a Nazi.
It speaks for itself, really.
So like, Trump, then. #CriminalCelebrities
Electoral fluke?? He won the states that mattered. Hillary racking up votes in NY and CA just to be slightly ahead in the popular vote means nothing. I would say the enthusiasm for trump is just a strong as it was in 2016.

Fake polls just like 2016. Trump will pull through and win big

Trump has more support then he did 4 years ago. It‚Äôs possible but I‚Äôd say North Carolina for sure going red, AZ could be a toss up
2).. It's maddening. Not only does he have 3 daughters &amp; a granddaughter whose rights he wants erased, he makes excuses for Trump like it's his personal buddy. Gross. And he used to be someone I admired in terms of a moral compass. He has broken my heart, and lost my respect. üíî

Yes , dems had a plan 3 months ago while you were pushing unqualified judges through.The need for all the judges are these Trump Republicans are looking at prison time , so you tried to fix the outcome
The Dems have 4 voting segments that make up their base. Thus their attacks:  1. Blacks, so Trump is a racist. 2. Jews, so Trump is anti-Semitic.  3. LGBTQ, so Trump is homophobic. 4. Illegal immigrants, so Trump is anti-immigrant. MSM support the Dems and push these lies.
For every Biden gaffe you can find 10 of Trump‚Äôs. The man has always had a stuttering problem since a very early age.

Trump just described himself! What a loser!
You Q believers are all the same. It‚Äôs no different than any other conspiracy. You don‚Äôt think trump would be pounding away at this thing and yelling from rooftops instead of using code words (and numbers) that everyone already knows about to do it secretly?

Yeah, and we can‚Äôt say Trump didn‚Äôt pick Pence for the exact same reason, to sway the right wing evangelicals? Otherwise, his morally bankrupt self could never have gained the favor of conservative Christians. What a stupid claim.
I‚Äôm hoping that the Biden team realizes that listening to the left scream ‚ÄúKamala is a cop‚Äù is WAY better than letting team Trump scream ‚ÄúBenghazi‚Äù for the next 90 days.
Trump 2020!
Williams also states that conservatism is the definition of insanity, repeating the same actions and expecting different outcomes.  Oh, and he thought Donald Trump was a rapist.

President Donald Trump signed legislation that will devote nearly $3 billion a year to conservation projects, outdoor recreation and maintenance of national parks and other public lands following its overwhelming approval by both parties in Congress.
Some of the horror can be fixed....some cannot because of trump, Moscow Mitch and the butt kissing repubs!  Now the courts are filled with very unqualified judges everywhere who will wreak havoc for years!
I am amazed that not one republican has the courage to do the right thing and suggest the 25th amendment.  Trump is so unfit for office and has lowered our standing in the world making other countries afraid and horrified at the buffoon in office!
Trump‚Äôs band of thieves!
Re-electing trump would doom this country!  Trump is totally nuts!

Establishment Republicans sought Tuesday to thwart polarizing conservative Kris Kobach's bid for Kansas' open Senate seat, a task complicated by President Donald Trump's refusal to endorse their favored candidate in the primary.
Jonathan Swan failed to point out that Trump whines about how we're doing so much testing compared to everyone else, but then wants credit for having a low number of deaths per case. He's trying to have it both ways!
The amount of bullshit people have to make themselves believe in order to support trump is UNBELIEVABLE

I think as crazy as it sounds , Trump is getting revenge on tictoc for ordering tickets to the Tulsa Rally never intending to go
If Trump was able to somehow postpone the election, he would have until 1/21 before getting the boot. POTUS will fall into the hands of... Patrick Leahy (D-VT). 23 Rep and 12 Dem senators are up for re-election so Leahy would become the new senior majority leader. Crazy, huh?
Lol geez I hope your god isnrbthe same one that Trump's expert witch Doctor prays to

postmaster general is shutting down automated sorting machines and banning overtime for usps workers. He‚Äôs managed to set the postal service back days in less than a week. We don‚Äôt think trump is trying to rig this thing? Ivanka‚Äôs new voting machines should get a lot of use. ü§î
The biggest fear of fraud through the mail-in voting process would be the new Postmaster General that trump just appointed. He‚Äôll make sure to do what he can to try to rig this thing. The right has nothing to worry about with mail-in fraud, they‚Äôre the ones doing it.
Explain a trump tweet? He‚Äôs good at lying to folks. You know Biden‚Äôs base predicted trump was going to try to postpone the election back in April. He has nothing to run on, poor economy, poor management of Covid, just fear and slander toward the left.

Supreme Court Gives Trump 5-4 Win on Construction of the Border Wall with MexicoDonald Trump in the morning hours all alone must be crushed by the truth pressing in from all sides.

The future will become brighter and  the endless  tweets of trash will end when Donald Trump fades into History.  The end of the dark days and the rebuilding of our nation torn apart when Trump is gone!  He will fight but he is no match for the truth.  The GOP will shout with joy
The truth about Donald Trump is being exposed slowly but consistently.  The information and documentation will paint a picture of a totally corrupted individual not fit to be President of United States.  The truth will be bitter and humbling for a man driven by ego and greed!
The Trump regime takes another hit this weekend when Jean Carroll moves ahead with her accusations of rape by Donald Trump.  His corruption, lusts, dealing with adversaries, tampering with the mail system, banking irregularities and no plan in a crisis will help sink his ship!
No more than your Intelligence, skills, or experience. If age was a factor then why did someone else win the Dem candidate. Trump is 74 looks/talks like 88. Reagan was 77.
Failed to fight when his country called - guys kneel they are not patriotic. Trump dodges the draft 5 times &amp; he is a patriot. Go figure.That is how fucked up this country has become.
Obama rebuild the economy after You and Repugs destroyed it. Trump inherited a thriving and growing economy. Now Trump and Repugs have put it in the ditch again. Biden and the Dems will rebuild it again. Repugs destroy - Dems build. Been that way since 1900.

Someone once said ‚Äúyou can run but you can‚Äôt hide‚Äù.  Sadly Donald Trump has been running and trying to hide for four years. Using lawyers, intimidation, obstruction, picked loyalists, and abuse of power to hide the fact he is totally corrupt. The relentless truth will set us free

They might have to cross that line too with Trump.
Donald Trump has turned the pandemic into a weapon for his own gain.  He knows that people of color are infected at higher rates.  This is why he wants schools to open to infect black and brown children and their families.  That‚Äôs why he soft on support.  Totally cruel and evil!
In the dark chambers of the Trump regime a sinister truth is known! Why should Trump actively engage a pandemic when it statistically infecting and killing Blacks and Hispanic citizens at higher rates!  The horrible truth of the depths of racism. Trump has weaponized the pandemic
Donald Trump has worked to destroy the soul of our nation. He has systematically dismantled the safe guards that make America civilized. He has turned our nation against itself. As we suffer and die by the thousands Trump pushes on like puppet/puppy weak easily lead and directed

Donald Trump is always on the attack as he follows CNN as he knows they and other news outlets are exposing his incompetence, corruption, obstruction, insensitivity,  and desperation.  He calls them out as fake but he knows they bring truth to the masses. Trump is the enemy!
Donald Trump in an interview recently clearly demonstrated his lack of knowledge and concern about the pandemic which is killing our citizens.  His tweets are focused on division and has moved to the level of meaningless gossip.  He continues to vomit foolishness as his own facts

Trump could have one with a Biden Quoting Stand In
Donald Trump is the man of opposites. If he says go right run left.  If he says social distancing he means come together.  Again if he says open our schools don‚Äôt do it protect our children and families
Thank God for Donald Trump he was being prepared for all of his life to serve as the President of America for a time such as this! He will do even greater things in his second term than were possible in the first, God is with him, and with us to fuel a strong accord to #KAG2020!
Biden assails Trump for 'bald-faced lies' about voting by mail   No vote by mail, no vote in person. So vote by email.
Those who seek peace &amp; quiet live in such areas, we have some violent, noisy people purposely move in behave badly &amp; they wait around all day to provoke, then if we do react they fire somebody on the Republican team, usually Trump gets attacked. So these blacks must be Democrats
Biden is also against LGBTQ, as is Trump.Candidates from both parties are against LGBTQ now. Both believe marriage should only be between two people of opposite sex otherwise its not recognized as a marriage. I think we need to split every country into two, liberal &amp; conservative

An interesting perspective into Trump supporters.
Biden all the way. Debate really doesn't matter at this point. Trump a disgrace to America &amp; every American who has ever lived.
Ninety eight percent of normal people don't go for mob control.Trump should win every state.
Here‚Äôs an idea: let‚Äôs all the billionaires vote Trump and everyone else vote Biden. We good?
I always wonder, if Trump is such a racist, why would pardon a African American women and have her released from prison? I mean Angela Stanton King should proof enough yet liberals will try to say he is racist.
I guess Trump will now move him to an opened public school.
Literally anyone who believes Trump over Fauci is a freaking fool.
Avoid Kamala Harris at all costs &amp; Trump as they are the most evil people on the planet. They want to harm me &amp; help themselves look good when they are the worst people on the planet.
We are also compassionate &amp; kind &amp; decent &amp; Kamala hates us very much. She is trying to get with Biden by cheating me. She is also using Trump to abuse me. She is trying make herself look good &amp; me bad. That is her life's goal, always has been that way, only she always cheats.
Unlike jealous lying gossiping cheating venomous idiots like those in my father's extended family &amp; my step siblings including Kamala &amp; Biden &amp; Trump. They feel they are supremacists white but they are not white, they are dirty greedy with hate, vice, jealousy, anger, stupidity
Jealousy - step sibling &amp; cousin rivalry is so poisonous it can poison the world. Kamala Harris represents this poison as does Trump. Trump has stopped all schooling but is sending me emails to invite me for dinner with him. They are so evil &amp; want to smear my character ruin me.
If Trump bans Tik Tok he can eat another bowl of dicks... which according to my calculations brings his bowl of dicks he can eat count to at least 139.
Police know Trump has to use real force to shut down riots.
Next Trump will pardon him.
Obama, will always be celebrated as one of the top 5 Presidents. Trump as the worst.
Is it rude to throw this quote from Trump's 2015 campaign launch back in his face? .... OF COURSE!!
Thought trump had power of executive order for voter ID?
They provoke then urge encourage the girls to go complain on us so they can replace &amp; take over what is ours. They have been doing this continuously since I was born. Muslims, servants, bad christians are all behind it as is Trump &amp; his ICE police who are frauds who ruin my life.
ICE is helping them do that. Trump is helping in this, he is using some bad lawyers &amp; bad judges who are bribed by religious organizations to favor bad people so they can cheat us out of our legal rights. We study, work hard all our lives, we are cheated by these prostitutes.
That used to bother me but trump will open a can of worms about everything, from total made-up lies to situations with a slight amount of concern so I decided what will be will be. We can‚Äôt worry about how they‚Äôre going to react because they‚Äôre going to go berserk anyway.
Donald Trump you should have put aside his differences and ego.  You should have risen above the demands and expectations of white supremacy groups. You should have been with the other living presidents and paid respect. What you did won‚Äôt be forgotten and adds to the disgrace!

I‚Äôm a trump hater but they can be different. You request an absentee ballot when you‚Äôre not able to vote in person (travel, illness, etc.) Mail-in ballots are usually determined by a state and sent out to all registered voters to use instead of in-person voting.
Michelle Obama describes Barack as ‚Äòformer president who reads and knows history‚Äô, in apparent swipe at Trump   A business man who raises the economy is as important as a history or geography student. Business folks are great in Math &amp; calculations.
I am going to volunteer for somebody who is not part of swamp, just like Trump, like Herman Cain, outsiders. I feel its wrong for all those who have long been in politics from the start to kick out those who come in new from outside call us deplorables, just cos we are not toilet
Got you. So all this about racism is a lie as Herman Cain supported President Trump he is obviously black, but he was not involved in politics but has been a businessman, like Trump. What is wrong with that? So they can't enter politics directly? I want to enter politics now.
Trump and Herman Cain are business people, outsiders, did not go through the formal route of congressman, senator, governor or born to a politician in power, they came from outside, without being soaked up in the swamp of politics before becoming president, or a supporter. Ha ha.
I wonder if she is from planet earth?

On your first point.. NO CHANCE, I can send you artical after artical of biased and unfair characterizations of something Trump said or did.  I agree more discussion between the sides are needed, but it‚Äôs not 1 sided.

I agree, but that‚Äôs not being pushed.  See above;  the narrative is what‚Äôs being pushed.  They had to mention he was at a ‚ÄúTrump rally‚Äù, do they can tie the two together.
Media trying to tie Trump rally with infection.  Media is a joke these days!!!  I wonder how many ppl got covid at a protest and died?  Do you think they would use a photo of that to push a narrative of where the contracted it?  NO!!

Sorry, the St. Louis suburbs hate Donald Trump. Saying this as someone who actually lives there. They‚Äôre tired of far-right republicans
The GOP presidential candidate field in 2016 was enormous. Did not one of them do opo on tRump? One could say they got what they deserved, but the rest of America deserves far better. Whether people want to believe/accept it or not. We are in this together.
If this guy even knows the God I worship ‚Äî like, if he seriously has any concept of a divine Other at all ‚Äî I‚Äôd be sincerely astonished.  I only observe Trump worshipping himself.

Trump has no cronies, hell he barely has any allies. Many of his staff has flipped on him thanks to the crooked FBI. The liberals are the ones w/ all the cronies. HRC said she take down half of DC if she goes down. Sounds like she has a bunch.
If you actually feel that way why didn‚Äôt  speak out against our President  who opposes your stance?
Oh, hey just know that if he could say no he would. There's your answer. He is working with a foreign government to help Trump win. He is the worst kind of unpatriotic, unAmerican, human that also participated in insider trading. Wisconsin, what have you done to us?
All it takes is a crate or five of ballots being left behind in a swing state by a Trump loving postal worker.

This time whole world is suffering for the whim of this Kamala woman who is Biden's pet &amp; the pet of all those who hate Trump &amp; those like myself who supported him.
My step sister also called Kamala but is 70 years old really has always been about me &amp; women like her having an old man with a younger woman but it can't be anyone who protects me or likes me it has to be Biden some old man of her choice where she gets perks &amp; I am killed off
It will never happen. Even more so now that Biden nor you will answer questions of the reporters. And double more so if Biden doesn't Debate Trump himself. We are beginning to realize that Biden is hiding because he can't answer questions nor Debate. Time to change parties
Biden &amp; Kamala rising is very bad omen for me &amp; it seems for Trump too so we have to work on getting them off our backs. Someone changed the color of my pc background to pink &amp; I hate it. I did not do that, so someone else is controlling my pc which I bought with my money. Bad.
I also got this runny nose &amp; nose block going on for almost a month now started since January, they are not letting us breathe - mostly on the right nose. It has gotten worse after June 2020 when Biden polls rose &amp; Trump is getting lower rating. Everything is worst this week.
When Biden‚Äôs AG indicts Trump &amp; any of his appointees, it won‚Äôt be a political stunt/move. They have been repeatedly breaking the law, in plain view of the world, documented in countless tweets, phone interviews, and ‚Äúpress conferences.‚Äù 2/2

Lol, so much Russian Collusion, let‚Äôs impeach him on a Ukraine phone call! And Not one person was charged with the Russian Collusion hoax. But again, if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black!‚Äù
Trump is playing chess. It is not the position, but the threat. Threaten the postal service. Democrats must position them selves to counter act. Play the game. Reverse the roll. Take charge and attack Trump. He is beatable. Biden knows this.
I think Biden/Harris will win Georgia.
Believe in the Biden team. We came this far. Trump is pulling his bull shit. So what? His strategy does not bother me. It motivates me to beat him more. Vote early. Tell your friends. Problem solved.
And do does Biden.
What‚Äôs sweet sweet Jill Biden‚Äôs payoff
Probably.  But the irony of black women being Biden‚Äôs firewall when he has done more to decimate black families than any other living politician is galling.
The only question remaining in this election cycle is, what are the Republicans going to do when they are the minority in DC? It's over. Trump will not win. I am that confidant. Biden's team has got all Trump's plays covered. Trump knows he is done.
Thank you  #BidenHarris2020 let's do this
Biden's team is very aware of Trump's treasonous actions with the post office. Don't you think there will be lawsuits before the election? I am not worried. This will be an ass kicking on Trump.
It is not my problem that you cannot walk and chew gum at the same time.  [It is within the realm of possibility for one person to loathe both Trump and Biden.]
Think about this. Biden is from Delaware. Democrat win. Harris from California. Democrat win. Pence from Indiana. Repub. Win. Trump from Florida. Democrat win. Trump is the odd man out. Biden-Harris 2020.
Relax Democrats. Biden will win. Breath. Trump late night election steal will not happen again. One reason, people are tired of the lies and treasonous acts against America. DC will be dominated by the Democrats.
Only number Joe Biden needs is 270. The electoral college has myriad options for Biden. Biden is neck and neck with Trump in red states. This speaks volumes. Trump's road is so narrow. Biden 2020.
Truth üé¨ domino Biden almost down!
If Trump is really for America, he wouldn't cut Postal funding. This is near treasonous behavior. Go for it Trump. Add to the unemployment line. In the end, you still lose to Biden.
BIDEN IS NOT GOING TO GO, YOU KNOW, SILENTLY INTO THE NIGHT IF HE LOSES.  TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN LANDSLIDE.
Still waiting on someone to explain to me how the Biden vote is a vote against fascism considering he wrote the Patriot Act and supports it wholeheartedly

From  I make no apologies for Biden's untenable position on abortion, but the reduction of the Catholic faith to this one issue has been a pastoral as well as a political dead-end, a distortion of Catholic moral teaching that must stop.

So Joe Biden is really not President? So I am assuming their are about 20 Co-Presidents?
Ebola killed 2 people here.  Obama and Biden stopped it before it got here.  And you KNOW this.  You look very smart.
That does not address the question at hand? How is it that you can blame those problems on a Biden election if it‚Äôs currently happening under a Trump presidency?
This comes from knowing no one wants her. Biden &amp; Harris don't even want her she embarrasses Obama every chance she gets .

Sadly, our lives do depend on it. Biden / Harris 2020
The ONLY President to do this. And the only candidate for President who didn‚Äôt become a multi-millionaire as a career politician and crony foreign deals like Joe Biden did.  Biden has been in government for nearly 50 years. FIFTY.
Lowest black unemployment, investment in impoverished communities, highest rate of black owned businesses, historic investment in traditional black colleges, justice reform, most new black business loans.    I antied up.   Now you do Biden/Harris.
Polls last election had Hillary up by 3 or 4 points which is what she won the popular vote by. Trump is deeply unpopular even compared to then and Biden is liked much more than Hillary and is winning in states like Texas.Things can change as Biden is awful but Trump knows its bad
Fairly encouraging numbers for Trump.  If Biden is so low now, after successfully hiding for months, what is he going to be in another two months?
OK....Can we get past the "woman" thing. We all know she is a woman. But she is a person and the most qualified person Pres. Biden could have picked. AND she can reach more people because they can relate to her.

You really believe that? Biden mentioned gender and skin color months ago as his criteria for the veep selection. That‚Äôs the main reason pundits had the insufferable nincompoop Abrams high on the list of choices.
The blacks will still vote for the racist Biden and brownie hound Harris, after all blacks kill more blacks than any other race yet they started BLM.  Why wouldn‚Äôt they vote for the two people that care the least about their race.  Harris = slimiest in office.

I‚Äôm a white person without a collage degree and I would walk barefoot through broken glass to cast my vote for Biden. It doesn‚Äôt take a collage degree to despise a lying, cheating evil man and his grifter family.
We didn't vote for Trump because he's a really nice guy, we voted for him because he can get the job done.  Search 'Biden accomplishments' vs 'Trump accomplishments.'  Trump is the best by far.
How would Biden handle a civil war?
Poll: Voters approve Harris VP pick, Biden gets image bounce Democrats and Black voters broadly approve of Harris' elevation, as do a plurality of independents.
We‚Äôll need four years of introspection and healing after this election, and Biden‚Äôs done nothing if not offer that service to Americans his entire adult life. He‚Äôll use his personal tragedies to empathize with all of us. We could all use a Grandpa Joe in our lives right now.

Joe Biden isn't a sensitive little bitch like Trump so he was able to put his big boy pants on and move on.
He said it at a campaign rally in February, dumbass! The entire month he did nothing to prepare our country for the worst pandemic in 100 years. Called it a hoax by the Democrats. And for the record, again I am not a Democrat, not a Biden supporter, but Trump has got to go.

Their original plan announced in Feb was to vote for the underdog and prolong the primaries, which was expected to be sanders. Then sanders won the first three, so they changed track to biden. Then dems latched on to biden's one win to consolidate with unprecedented intensity.
Among those voters who plan to use mail-in ballots, Biden leads by an astounding 50 points, 72% to 22%.  Among those who plan to vote in-person on Election Day, Trump leads by 35 pts, 55% to 31%.  Among those who plan to vote in-person early, Trump leads by 4 pts, 49% to 45%.

The disappointing thing was Craig Melvyns indignant question as to when Biden/Harris were going to start "answering questions." They know they are co-conspirators but feel entitled to do Trumps dirty work for him
Alot of people call themselves anti imperialist but they are telling people to vote for Biden  Very confusing
If Joe Biden were president we would have a united plan against the pandemic. There would be a mandated mask order. If we really want this pandemic to end wear an effing mask! The GOP needs to step aside and let the smart people lead.
Why do they think will have leverage over Biden when Biden already said he will be a one term president?  Obama did all the shit he did while worrying about reelection  Biden is to his RIGHT and doesnt have to worry about it plus you pledged your vote. Makes no sense
But a biden presidency congeals the unification of democrats with Bush Republicans, and results in liberals then defending all those hideous trump policies when biden just continues them.
and it's all traceable back to Obama and Biden!
Biden, you couldn't build, even with a child's block set! You and Obama destroyed more of the USA goodness than any other group of crooks in history!
Essentially what I just heard on  is: Trump moves the news cycle Biden/Harris have not followed that tactic , and remained laser focused on their agenda because they are not answering reporters questions That leads to the inescapable conclusion, the news media enables Trump
That's funny. Buy me a Punch Presidente Maduro when Biden wins.
Do you really not remember biden and Obama championing pipelines and incentivizing the massive expansion of fracking wells for natural gas?  Wells which are currently vomiting super-greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere, totally uncontrolled, as they are abandoned?
A NEW POLL FINDS THAT BIDEN'S SUPPORTERS ARE LESS ENTHUSIASTIC OF HIM.  RASMUSSEN REPORT SURVEY POLL: 59% THINK BIDEN IS UNLIKELY TO FINISH HIS FIRST TERM.  HIS VP IS NOT BLACK, SHE IS JAMAICAN INDIAN.   NOBODY WANTS THE JOB OF SELLING BIDEN DOOR TO DOOR.
Overconfident. Biden is neck and neck in 3 traditional red states. Kicking ass in all other blue states.
You know Biden wins Florida. Trump has zero chance at reelection. Bet you a good cigar.
I want him to explain how we push Biden to the left after pledging out vote to him when he's going to be a one term president anyway and dont have to worry about reelection  Very interested in hearing it
I have issues with the woman that basically called Biden a racist and said she believed his accusers jumping at the chance to run with him.
Dude. Trump can't win. End of story. Biden is so prepared. 600 lawyers ready at his response. Done deal.
As we all knew, SHE‚ÄôS the one running and doing all the talking for Hidin‚Äô Biden!  Sorry, but I‚Äôm totally sick of her, already!!!
punching left accomplishes what exactly?  He is a fucking grifter  He is pissing more people off than convincing to vote Biden
If biden wants to actually oppose trump policies and push for good things instead, I'm all ears. But he's very clearly not interested in that.
That, ultimately, is the problem. Biden doesn't actually represent stopping trump policies at all. He represents getting liberals to support trump policies at 60% power. I'd rather then keep opposing fascism instead of being partially invested in it.
Trouble is, biden has made it clear that not only will he not punish any of those trump people if he gets in office, he's likely to generally sustain all of trump's policies. He literally said he's going to make most of the trump tax cuts permanent!
Biden will save the Post Office. Republicans are dead meat. This party is so fucked up. I hope they all rot in hell. Especially Pedophile Gym Jordan I am really pissed off. Hate that party.
If Joe Biden were president, we‚Äôd already be past the worst of this. Instead we have record-setting unemployment and 200,000 deaths projected through next month. Please look at reality. Or just keep quiet.

To put it bluntly: biden and the democrats explicitly aren't even offering bread and circuses and have rejected doing so for costs. They're at best just promising that the prison guard kicking you in the stomach might not be a white man, perhaps, someday.
Can we get Biden to take some questions for Christsakes

I mean... Biden is going to sustain all of the brutal trump policies about protest responses. This federal escalation was literally out of a playbook biden and Obama wrote! None of the tear gas and beatings and punitive arrests will stop or even slow down.
We can‚Äôt get Biden even to take ANY questions. He forgets where he is.  Creepy Joe
We need to add 10 points to Trump and take away 10 points from Biden with every one of these polls we see. That‚Äôs the advantage Trump gets from the cheating, the suppression, the screwing with the postal service, and Russia.

There are so many "progressives" with Stockholm Syndrome over the two party system to the point where they repeat their political fanfiction as if its fact   We couldn't push Obama to the left, and Joe Biden is to his RIGHT
Those people aren't Biden voters anyway.
Vote for Biden
Adding to a long list of exs in which he manipulates faith for pol gain the¬†pres‚Äôs rant in Ohio¬†last Thurs also undermined yet another sec of the Constitution ‚Äî¬†Article 6, Section 3¬†‚Äî which quite specifically states that there is no relig test for office.
This is in contrast to the Obama's and Clintons" and Biden's who all saw their net worth sky rocket.  One works for you and the rest for themselves and their cronies.
Biden, Harris blasted by mainstream media for not taking questions from reporters
Vox says Biden is 'moving left' with Harris on ticket despite media calling her 'moderate'
Biden lies about what Trump says, makes it the centerpiece of his campaign, and you can‚Äôt see who is creating racial division in pursuit of power? Instead, you suggest someone you don‚Äôt know is racist. Cognitive dissonance. More important, Biden hurts America.
We Catholics should be able to explain how our faith informs all of our decisions, including our political ones. Biden's decision to lean in to the discussion, and not to avoid it, will be good for Catholicism, whether or not it is good for the Democrats.
WTF is Pence talking about??? Biden &amp; Harris r now going to ''cut America's meat?" How and where do they come up with this nonsense anyway???üò≥üëá
He won't. Perhaps we should focus our imagination on Biden and Harris taking office in January 2021.üëç
POST OFFICE IS NOT GOING ANY WHERE. TRUMP IS. LET THAT SINK IN. TRUMP IS DONE. TIMING IS EVERYTHING. BIDEN WILL STILL KICK HIS ASS. TRUMP IS GOING BYE BYE.
If and/or when Biden/Harris win in a landslide victory, the Senate will naturally flip.  Then we can finally get things done and Mitch will lose all his power, even if he wins re-election, which I don't feel he will...not even close. The Turtle's time is up too.
Yes, this IS our last stand, James. And WE THE PEOPLE are drawing a line in sand and we chose Biden and Harris on November 3.   Why u ask?üò≥ Bc we've fucking HAD it with this sociopathic LUNATIC.üëá  So, ya know, you've LOST. ‚ö°Ô∏è
Biden looks so ready to take our country back.
America, tell my friend John Fox to vote Biden.
The American people are seeing how frail the Orange ass is. Biden looks vibrant and ready to roll.
"We're not gonna let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America's meat". Mike Pence..
That would require senile old Joe to speak without a cue card or teleprompter &amp; we all know that is no longer part of Biden‚Äôs skill set.
Whether we are lying or not I don't feel a cringe when I look at our faces in the mirror or at the faces of those like Trump but I cringe when I look at Biden or Kamala - its some radar that makes me stop looking at them. They must be very evil as I have an intuition - built in.
Try to build Biden as clone of clinton is disgusting.
You see what the Democrats do? They dirty every beautiful clean valuable thing on the planet to waste it away, they do it to people too, they destroy good folks - the prostitutes and liberal demoncrazies like Biden &amp; Kamala &amp; the rest of the trash.
Looks like the Democrat‚Äôs get-out-of-Biden-nominee card was to allow him to appoint an ineligible running mate par for the course after all BO was never eligible to serve as POTUS either
I had some steaks in the freezer last night but Joe Biden and Kamala Harris snuck in and stole all my meat.
BREAKING: New FOX poll says that Biden is leading Trump 50 to 36% on who Americans think who would do a better job handling coronavirus.  That's a 14 point lead...which is astounding, considering our ''divisiveness."   Doesn't look like we're that divided any longer.üò≥

If Biden is elected, ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt seen nothin yet!!!!‚Äù
That being sad if the Democrats are playing chess no other candidate could have jump right in and win over so many votes so Biden had to get the position but Harris is the next actual candidate they are backing
Hey King Biden wanna be. .how about NO! #BidenIsARacist
‚Äúclassic #GenX straddle:  She‚Äôd navigated... a system controlled by older, whiter, more-conservative politicians, and then proposed to wield... that power in the service of... the enormous, diverse, and progressive... generations coming of age behind her.

The awful Israel-UAE deal that Trump oversaw would have been overseen by Biden too, and Hillary - absolutely. But we have leaders in Congress now who are finally speaking up about Israeli apartheid. They are better positioned to grow influence without Republicans in charge.
God it would be cool if the people who made up 82% of america‚Äôs wealth saw a higher Rex percentage cut under Joe Biden tax plan but unfortunately he won‚Äôt do anything üòî
For those that are interested here's the source of this
Bernie had money from actual passionate voters. Biden gets corporate pac money.  Biden didn't even campaign in some states but won off of name recognition because half the country sadly doesn't pay attention.
You keep shifting to your hatred of Trump.  I'm trying to focus on Biden and D's lying about what he said and thereby creating further racial division in their pursuit of power. I don't think people should be okay with it. I assume, you would not be, if you did not hate Trump.
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim Democrats will rig this election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
You can hate Trump (as you obviously do) and still criticize Biden and D's for lying about what he said.
My main question is that if Biden wins and he raises taxes on the top 1% and Fortune 500 companies who will provide jobs for Americans when they take their factories to other countries? Please explain. I‚Äôve never ever got a definitive answer on this.
To state the obvious, Biden and D's are lying about what Trump said that day.  To create racial division to achieve political power. And you are okay with it.
will not win!!  And somehow if the Democrats pull off a criminal win, we the people will take it back.  So either way Biden will lose!
Biden got like 5% of the under 40 vote. AOC could reach them.  But keep licking those boots
I‚Äôm sorry, but no. Neither Biden nor Harris are socialists, &amp; they haven‚Äôt called for abolishing police.  However, Trump is actively hollowing out the government, profiting from it, is a white supremacist, and has let Covid completely overrun the country while calling it a hoax.
And this.
Wow... don't even where to begin here.  According to you,  Joe Manchin and AOC are the same since they are both Dems. So I guess Kasich and Trump are both the same since they are both Republicans.  Biden got like 5% of the under 40 vote.  AOC can reach them more than anyone.
If you are honest and open minded, read this and let me know your thoughts.  Put Trump's flaws to one side for a moment.
Tom, any concern about Biden and D's doing this -- smart liberal honest former law school professor sees Biden creating racial division in the pursuit of power.
Biden struggles with young voters. AOC excels with them. Kasich and Clinton will just be preaching to the choir.  AOC could actually reach New voters.  These are facts.
The thing is, the kind of people who will vote for Biden don't care about tax increases. None of them pay taxes. They're either here illegally or living in their mom's basement.
How will usps get them to and from with Trump slowing the mail system, purposefully.  I bet she votes Biden.
Biden is a pedo Harris got her job on her knees great choice!
Trump was dumb, not racist, to say anything other than Harris eligibility not an issue. But which is worse, a dumb "I have no idea" statement by Trump or a calculated false racial division political strategy by Biden and D's?
Again violating my vow to stay away on political stuff. Other day you  questioned if D's falsely created racial division to pursue power. See below by smart liberal honest former law school professor. You seem interested in truth.
The 2nd amendment was not about owning guns it's about the right to over throw a government that no longer had the best interest of the people. That's what will get with biden/ Harris #takemycountryback
Because it has attacked the great booming economy &amp; is now calling Trump a liar and Biden a catholic is winning &amp; they are citing sex abuse etc. I see a repeat of the same broken record player &amp; I know they are defrauding &amp; cheating &amp; pretending their religion is great &amp; its not.
Stick to sports. The dude got owned by Trump. Not one single reporter asked that question recently. Shannon, if you really are as smart as you are, name five things Biden has done for our country.
I loved the words that Biden had: "you could set your watches to it'' bc Trump is actually the most PREDICTABLE person on the planet if you've been paying attention.  And once u figure out the psyche of a sociopath, they're really not that complicated and therefore predictable.
There's go that theory that they will hold Biden accountable LMAO
Liberals are fighting and pushing back against a #GeneralStrike when fucking Trump is president   And y'all think they will have our back trying to force Biden to the left?   Clown shit
Me being old is not a big issue. As that Kamala - my step sister is 8 years older than me really and Biden is 77 years old - Nancy Pelosi has no teeth &amp; she is swaying her hips sitting in her chair like a dancing girl. They are the ones pretending to be universal but are they?
Hell yes... I'm loving that he says he's going to hold Biden accountable for the Green New Deal... you don't see that often!
These Biden commercials are eh just saying
Joe Biden is really in ‚Äú Dire Straits ‚Äú now!!
If and/or when Biden and Harris win on November 3 in a landslide victory...  it'll be the imminent END of the Republican Party as we know it.  Why? Bc the American people are simply TRAUMATIZED from the last 3.5 years and will vote blue for at LEAST the next 12.  Just sayin'.üò≥
On August 20th, Joe Biden will accept the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. Don‚Äôt miss it.  #DemConvention
People think Biden and Harris are just politicians with a few flaws when in fact they're very awful people who have caused some of the very same problems some people think they will solve for some reason
It is you who lied &amp; still lie. You are pitiful. Trump did not lie. You will suffer terrible consequences for attacking so many decent good honest people because of one woman's hatred for her step sister. Kamala's hatred. Poor woman. I forgive her &amp; hope God forgives her &amp; Biden.
You cannot be serious? If this Trump Virus wasn‚Äôt as truly serious as it continues to be, your idiotic comment would be laughable. 160,000 + Americans DEAD and counting. If the Biden/Harris Administration was in charge, we all would be better off.   #BidenHarris2020 üíô
They hate us so much &amp; we never hurt them in anyway except we are not prostitutes they all are. The worst prostitutes &amp; whores attacking decent folks using dirty reporters dirty Biden dirty Kamala &amp; dirty liberal democrats who throw dirt on everyone they can get trapped some way

A DNC spokesperson told The Hill that Yang was among a list of former 2020 candidates who would be speaking during two segments about the status of America and how they will work with former Vice President Joe Biden.
Trump's Response When Asked If He Regrets All The Lies He's Told America: None  via   That reporter and those prostitutes &amp; Democrats &amp; Biden &amp; Kamala are the only ones lying. Trump is not lying. I am not lying. We are all the ones who are victimized.
C‚Äômon. I answered your question honestly. Man up. The chaos in Seattle okay with you?  Defunding the police sound like a good idea?  Do you support Chicago BLM leaders defending looting calling it reparations? Biden saying we all need to wear masks outside, even in rural Kansas?
I swear some of these people are proletariats straight out of 1984. Most of these people probably don't vote anyway, but criticizing and telling people they shouldn't vote for Biden
Make America Sleep Restfully Again is a legit potential Biden-Harris slogan
Biden is the 'presumptive' democrat nominee not even the real one. Everything is so presumptuous &amp; presumed not real. Whole thing is a fraud.
Never succumb to Biden hit the rascal directly on his face &amp; break the nasty arrogant nose of Kamala. Beat them up &amp; make them eat dirt &amp; become rag dolls stomp on them throw their broken bodies in the rubbish heap where they belong with their fake evil gods they try to protect

I will never support Biden no matter what he does. As he is the real liar not me or Trump.
I am sick of the Democrats, sick of Biden, sick of Kamala, sick of these type of reporters S.V. Date - like having a Date going on a Date &amp; so on that is what they are saying - that I am looking for a Date with some man or woman as they change my gender &amp; say any lies to push it
I'll believe that when Biden starts screeching about conspiracies on Twitter for five hours a day.
They have nothing else other than to tweet disinformation as nothing positive ever has happened from the  administration. Trump &amp; minions  are frantically editing photos of Biden to rile up the uneducated base. They have no other amnitition. üòÇ
I told my mother about this by phone right after which Nancy Pelosi got very angry with all the Democrats joining to put the impeachment trial that Trump had asked Ukraine for proof about Biden doing some cover up there for his son Hunter. So it is still the same issue going on
They are pushing the same deal over again now - Biden and Kamala - that I am immoral &amp; that I had amorous relationships with younger men, that I had baby with a CIO of Citibank Shankar Iyer. She put a baby carriage in my basement &amp; said it was proof of my adultery &amp; immorality
Jilly? Dougie? Aww, how folksy. C'mon man. Give me a break. Joe Biden and Kamala going to eat Trumps lunch? Nope. Not even close
Joe Biden can‚Äôt even spell UAE.
I cannot wait to see  tell Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to keep their mitts off his meat.

If Biden and Harris Have Their Way, 19 Million Jobs Would Be Eliminated

The longer AOC talks, the greater the risk she‚Äôll point out that Biden is a racist with dementia and that KamAllah is descended from slave owners, and that AOC is the best candidate to lead a fascist global new world order.
Maybe if you handed voted to give Trump a pass for TRYING TO LEVERAGE UKRAINE FOR DIRT ON BIDEN, we wouldn't be suffering from all these crises.  THIS IS ON GOP!  #COVID19  #USPSsabotage  #deficit
Biden picked Harris to pander to woman and people of color.  That seems like trying to rig something to me.  Look up all the states where voting by mail has left ballots uncounted.  Left or right, right or wrong it doesn‚Äôt work. NJ, NM, MO, WV, IN.
BIDEN &amp; DEMOCRATS WANTING CRIME AND EVEN MURDER IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THE REPUBLICAN IN NOVEMBER.  DEMOCRATS SEEM TO WANT TO TURN CITIES INTO WARZONE.  THEY WANT CRIME AND MURDER.     BIDEN DONATES MONEY TO RIOTERS TO GET THEM OUT OF JAIL, THEY HAVE A FUND.
I don't think Claire has many open minded followers, but for any who are here, look at how liberal former law professor Ann Althouse views Biden's and D's intentional creation of racial division to pursue political power.
I would have loved Joe Biden to have picked Tulsi Gabbard or Nina Turner over any "Third Way" Corporate Zionist DINO like Harris!
If you consider yourself on the left and you are busy pushing and holding water for Joe Biden instead of helping with a #GeneralStrike, you are a fraud  Sorry, not sorry
If you are annoyed that Biden isn‚Äôt exactly who you want to vote for, so are unexcited about participating in this election: I have good news!    If you vote some random third party or sit out the election, you won‚Äôt have to worry about voting ever again.
If Trump wins but Democrats retake the Senate and the House  What exactly could Trump get accomplished that Joe Biden wouldn't already do?
And you think Biden will be better?  I get you stated it twice.  My issue was never about the story I‚Äôm particular.  It‚Äôs with the constant pandering to the liberal agenda.

The number one priority for progressives should be organizing a #GeneralStrike, not holding water for fucking Joe Biden and the Democratic Party who are complicit with this shit
The reason why I know you are a deeply unserious grifter is because if you really believed Trump was this existential threat, instead of punching down at people with no money or no power, you would have hit the phones to actually help Biden win  Who's chasing clout now?
In a perfect world,  Bernie Sanders.  In a realistic world,  none of the current republican goons would be a good start.  I hate Biden too, but sadly it's the only alternative.
BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP DOESN'T THINK IT IS FAIR THAT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA DON'T COVER BIDEN'S HEALTH &amp; FITNESS.  VOTERS NEED TO KNOW IF A CANDIDATE CAN DO THE JOB.  TRUMP SUCCESSES ARE TAX CUTS, ECONOMY, UNLEASHING DOMESTIC ENERGY PRODUCTION, &amp; THE COURTS.
Very concerning ticket... I just don't see how progressive Democrats will be able to vote for Biden/Harris... Though I also though Christian conservatives wouldn't vote Trump. So wtf do I know.

Except Biden doesnt let himself into the dressing rooms of nude underage pagent constestants or install camera's in the rooms of women on game shows.
Oh ask Joe Biden what he thinks?? He gives credit to the Obama administration almost 4 years ago for Trump's hard work
Because of his opponent. Did you notice how Biden never accepts extemporaneous questions? Why do you think that is?
I have 2 daughters...I don't want them living in Biden's America! I'll die for them. Trust!
Biden / Harris 2020~ !!! Let's bring honesty, CLASS, respect, and intelligence back to the White House.  America misses those qualities in a President.
"I was one of the people who publicly expressed concern about Harris during her presidential campaign. A few key things have changed since then ... my politics have changed."  Translation: I went from critic to bootlicker within 2 changing seasons.
Libs: Trump wants to be a dictator! An autocrat!! Trump: The governors should make decisions. They know what works for them. Libs: He is not a good leader!  Biden: All governors should require people to wear a mask. Kamala: That's what leadership looks like. Libs: Yay!!
Then maybe, if nothing can be done now, Biden's DOJ will indict Trump. He would be out of office, could be charged, could be impeached. That way he doesn't get to run for president again.
Don the con is going to raise taxes to the middle class to pay for his failed reaction to Covid. Biden will tax billionaires which means trump will pay more. Trump is going to spread any lies to get reelected to pay less in taxes and to stay out of jail for tax evasion.
Biden has his downside being an old white man and an establishment Dem. Kamala being selected shows the progress. This ticket is the best Dems have to beat the current GOP. But u don't beat GOP voter suppression without the black vote. After that women will lead the country.
So Biden‚Äôs not winning then?
I love the convo. But the Dem party has been making strides since 2018 w/ black women and other minority women (AOC, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley&amp;Rashida Talib) beating out old establishment Dems. While introducing new ideas and bills. Biden is to appease old Dems. Party unity.
Biden picks Harris for running¬†mate
Seems like all of the Biden press is positive and the Trump press is negative.  Who would have thought that?
The fact Biden is trying to take credit for this is exactly why he shouldn‚Äôt be president. He tries to take credit for what others have done.
I agree! She threatened Biden.
Biden mumbled and was zoned out today- ü•±üò¥ü§§.  Would you explain to Marie the importance that I know WHY JOE HAS NEVER had a covid test? Marie, hasn‚Äôt he gotten the COVID test ‚Äúout of the goodness of his heart?‚Äù
Best President ever. Biden/Harris cannot even come close
Wrecking the post office to interfere w/ mail-in voting &amp; set it up for privatization is 1000x more terrible than refusing to help Ukraine w/ its proxy war w/ Russia if they don't investigate Biden (or whatever the impeachment was supposed to be about)
No, we're not. It's coming back up because folks who haven't paid attention during the primary are now looking to get caught up for the general.  These folks that haven't any clue about Biden or Harris beyond the headlines of articles they've been scrolling past in the last year.
Quick now do a Biden is senior story.  Or Kamala will sell anyone out to gain power.  No?  Only anti-Trump.  Wow.  I‚Äôm ashamed this is my KC radio station.    You don‚Äôt even try to hide it anymore.
I would trust Biden to do a better job than Trump with the virus anytime
Bernie‚Äôs volunteers [as opposed to paid staff, a/k/a Jeff Weaver] and donors deserved better.  I know unpaid volunteers who gave up at least two years of their lives because they believed in the urgency of M4A.  And then immediately endorsing Biden?  WTFF?
I hope she and Biden don‚Äôt give it the time of day. Sadly, I think one of Obama‚Äôs biggest mistakes was releasing his birth certificate rather than dismissing the accusations as nonsense

I cannot believe the anti-mask idiocy. Biden takes a stand to call for a nationwide mask mandate, and the MAGAts come crawling out of the muck exclaiming, "But my freedom!" Please. It's not about freedom. It's about saving American lives! If you're a "patriot" then act like it.
KAMALA HARRIS BRINGS NOTHING TO THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN, SHE ISN'T BLACK, SHE IS JAMAICAN INDIAN.  MALES BLACK,  WHITES, &amp; LATINOS ARE UPSET WITH BIDEN FOR NOT BEING CONSIDERED.  IT IS ASTONISHING HOW BIDEN WAS ABLE TO PICK A RUNNING MATE HAS DONE MORE DAMAGE.
The onion is right! Biden really did need more centrist to even out all the centrism on the ticket
Neither one really like each other. Waiting for a Biden‚Äôs dementia breakdown, Referring Harris to the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word.  Dementia patients revert back to early years in life.
Biden has already said that he wants Bloomberg in his cabinet.  And Jamie Dimon.
Who would you like to see as Attorney General, once Biden-Harris win??
It didn't spread cause Obama and Biden took care of it for the country.
Joe Biden is so toxic that his "you ain't black" comments have white liberals believing they can talk to black people this way  Fuck the Democratic Party
Antifa  website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to ‚Äî wait for it ‚Äî Russia  via
Remember how Joe Biden's team deleted all their Brett Kavanaugh #MeToo tweets in response to the Tara Reade bombshell?  Joe Biden is so toxic he turned liberal feminists into rape apologists
first of all no one said they LIKED biden/kamala but i 100 percent would rather vote them in and bully them to the left than have 4 more years of an entire administration of evil ass people
Biden has no idea what he is talking about. But one thing is for certain: he wants to control every aspect of your life.
Joe Biden said that he's a bridge to Pete Buttigieg yet charlatans still selling the idea that we can push him to the left üòí
than donald trump and his cabinet of racist/sexist/transphobic goons. the goal is to get biden in office and then push them further left. i don‚Äôt get why marginalized groups wouldn‚Äôt vote for him.
Biden/Harris2020 - We won't kill your kids*.  *certain restrictions may apply, see political platform and voting record for details
At least President Biden has faith. tRump's faith is the church of "People are Sheep" and I am ready to shear them all.
Joe Biden just provided us the leadership we need, by overtly politicizing masks ‚Äî something the Republicans have sneaked around while using it as a tool.
CNN carrying Biden live doesn't mean anyone is seeing it. Kind of a tree falling in an empty forest sort of thing.
Agreed - and nevertheless Biden/Harris have my vote....she is a great speaker.  I wonder who Axl was hoping for...ü§î
What do people think of Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP pick? Here‚Äôs what initial polls say
I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden will have a dog in the White House. Although I agree he probably won‚Äôt want a cow.
Would love to hear your opinion on this. But my hope is that Kamala has changed her mind on CJ considering what has happened this year. We the people need to keep speaking up and put pressure on making change. I think Biden and Kamala are intelligent enough to ‚Äúchange their mind‚Äù
Biden‚Äôs 1994 Crime Act has decimated black families for a quarter of a century.
self-awareness level...zero.  right now... a) the world is currently laughing at us b) putin is taking full advantage of the US c) the country IS IN COLLAPSE  and guess what?  Joe Biden is not the president #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
trump vs biden, trumps winning by a landslide üìà
Really!? What Obama and Biden had was not prosperity. Remember Obama what was he going to wave his magic wand. Said it was the new normal and it wouldn't ever be like it was again.
You meant Biden. Right?
Biden won‚Äôt be leaving his basement so he doesn‚Äôt need a mask. Kamala wouldn‚Äôt be leaving the Lincoln bedroom as she ‚Äòentertains‚Äô guests so I guess she won‚Äôt need one, either.
Biden just said he will issue a NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATE as soon as he and Harris take office...and then Kamala added, "This is what TRUE LEADERSHIP looks like."  Now THAT'S what I'm talking about people.ü§£üëç  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
We've seen Biden for over four decades with zero positive results. He needs to stand on the stage with Trump and make his case as to why and how after all of those decades he will finally do something positive for America.
Joe is on his last limb I know he has dementia I can tell by his actions. The Obama/Biden administration did nothing for Americans in the eight years if they were in office. Media radio and television lie to the people. I‚Äôm tired of the left radical destroying cities.
NUNES: Obama and Biden Knew About Spying on the Trump Campaign
BREAKING: When Biden/Harris take office they'll create a nationwide TESTING BOARD, will hire 100K to lead us thru contact tracing, will chart a ''clear path forward'' for a vaccine and spend $25B in manuf. and distrib. for it, and will issue a NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATE.  SHAZAM‚ö°Ô∏è
I have been pounded by insults, threats and hatred all day.  Many of them have pointed out that Biden was accused of assault by Tara Reade but make no mention of Trump‚Äôs 25 sexual assault complaints. I can‚Äôt fathom how they reconcile any of this??? Sigh... #nohope
There's really only one response to anyone asking you to vote biden.  "sorry dude. I don't vote for Republicans"
When someone doesn't know the definition of a pedophile...  You can criticize someone without using false and defamatory things, that make you look uneducated and uninformed. Biden might be creepy, but there's only been one credible allegation of assault. Trump has dozens.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
Took me 15 seconds to find, copy, and paste.
Biden Harris show authoritarian side. Demand nationwide mandate for mask. This is just the very beginning of dictating what they believe is right more than you. I not saying mask are bad or good. What I‚Äôm saying is Washington should not dictate anything like that to us. #pathetic
What the fuck is he even saying
"Presumptive Democratic candidate Joe Biden has called for a mandate requiring all Americans to wear a mask when going outdoors for "at least" the next 3 months."  Go to hell, Maggot!
With the election just four months away and polls suggesting a Democratic Party sweep, Bill Greiner, chief economist, dives into what a Biden win would mean for the #economy.
How the hell can Joe Biden sniff Kids with a mask on?
Surely, the big story is not what Biden said but the fact that Trump himself openly proclaimed that he is doing it. Otherwise, we should have stories like, "Biden claims big blast went off in Beirut," etc.
No questions  for Harris or Biden. Guess figure press will carry their water. Make their spin for them. üëÄ
Funny how Biden and Harris are demanding a Covid vaccine. If they‚Äôre so up on how vaccines are developed they should just pull it from their ass. This does nothing but show just how f‚Äôing stupid they are. #patheticdemocrats
Trump is going to lay down the FNF stolen card along with spying on him.  Anything to discredit Biden.  We are the Ace.
Biden/Harris call for a nationwide mask mandate
It will all be done and over before Biden has a chance to screw with them.

Joe Biden is calling for a mask mandate nationwide. He just said if Trump would've acted one week sooner we would've saved countless lives. That would be one week before Joe called him xenophobic and racist for taking action! Democrats make up their own history

Nope President Trump working overtime.  Regardless to you hating the Republican party.  Trump has done more for our nation than any other president in history.  Biden is in the basement receiving pharmaceutical medications Monitored with exercise and cognitive testing. ‚ÄúDementia‚Äù
I've only referred to Schumer and Biden as phony...never a lady
LOLOLOL  biden/Obama have *anything* to do with this peace deal.   You two American hating sellouts were too busy shipping Iran pallets  of cash!
All those who will lose their livelihoods when Biden wins? You must mean Americans who work for a living. Silly git.
Absolutely &amp;  if Biden is elected he will allow it to be taught in school he told us that. Even though we have our Laws in the U.S That is the Only Law we go by &amp; That has to be protected if you want your Laws you go back to the Country that has your Laws.
But a Biden/Harris win will send him over the nastiest cliff he can find.

I'm not excited that AOC is speaking.  I'm not excited that Bernie is speaking  Why the fuck would anyone be excited about a fucking speech when Biden won't give us the policy that we are advocating for?  Biden is not adopting an UBI for fucks sake    #YangIsSpeaking
Never kind taking over after 8 years  of Republicans fucking up. Nevermind riding the wave of what Obama and Biden  rebuilt. Nevermind you mufukas destroying us once again. Fuck you and this message Mike

I'm waiting for Q to tell us all about how the third nipple is an adrenochrome injection port and how the cat is used as a familiar in Biden's Satanist rituals...
Vote for Biden and get this parasite out of the WH.
his argument is biden is a fascist too. reccomend a reread
I'm a supervoter and consistent democrat, in battleground Missouri, that has voted in every election, including off year municipal and county, since I turned 18 just in time to vote for Kerry in the general in 2004.  Will not be voting for biden

This suburban woman is voting Biden/Harris.

Trump is working to create peace in the Middle East, while Biden is working not to pee his pants.
Just because I‚Äôm voting for Biden doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm soft.
Biden hasn't said the Pandemic will magically vanish when he's elected, only that we'd allow science to lead our response. Meanwhile, how about this magical thinking:
"This should be a great concern to all Christians," Graham, the president and CEO of Samaritan's Purse, tweeted. "As a follower of Jesus Christ, I am pro-life [and] believe every life is precious to God."

Decisions are made by those who show up. The fact that black voters in SC were able to show up in huge numbers for Biden, but people under 30 couldn't show up for Bernie, means that Biden won and Bernie lost.  That's not a conspiracy, that's democracy.

I don't like Biden, and I don't like Trump. I don't like Jorgensen, and I don't like Hawkins. But even more insidious than any of these, and I think you'll all agree, are people who don't put their PowerPoint presentations in presentation mode.
So they get rid of honest folks and those with good intelligence &amp; worth - so everyone is either stupid or corrupt - Biden and Kamala - types. That is their goal to form what they call the Mafia mob team that will then allocate jobs study monies everything according to favoritism
Drumming up support for Biden so he can win she can collect her money from trump and then divorce him.
They reduce our ability to breathe they reduce supply of oxygen - they use viruses - anything to make those who usually excel in anything they do to lose that ability so that  incompetents  like Biden and corruption criminal actions of dishonest women like Kamala can win
The tragically dim Joe Scarborough asked in 2016 why Democrats have voting booths.

Mr Biden, YOU'VE had 40+ YEARS to FIX SOCIAL SECURITY &amp; did NOTHING. NOW, "IF" YOU'RE PRESIDENT YOU SAY YOUR'E GOING to REALLY FIX IT after 40+YEARS, YOU'LL SAY ANYTHING to GET ELECTED. It will then BE 44+ YEARS &amp; NOTHING AGAIN.

Vote for Biden
im afraid if we don't vote for biden we won't be able to vote next election
At this point, I think both top party choices suck and would be bad for the country. So I don‚Äôt feel swayed by the charge that I‚Äôd be helping Trump or Biden, for that matter. I weary of the binary and banal choices given. I‚Äôm considering using my voice in a different way.
Don't take our foot off the gas: Biden expands lead over Trump to double digits: poll
First of all I HATE Biden but I have not heard Him take any credit for this Second of all look closely at my profile pic dumbass it‚Äôs not just The Republican or Democrat logo in a no sign but BOTH cause both parties suck hard #EndThe2ParySystem
Great article showcasing how the ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù stuff between Obama/Biden wasn‚Äôt always real and how much they differ on style.   Paints Biden as an opponent of the ‚Äúelitist‚Äù attitude Obama became known for during his tenure, and more about personal relationships.
We are destroying this country over a virus with a 99.96 survival rate.   Kids need to go back to school and the country needs to open.   All Biden can talk about is mask mandates(tyranny)   Hydroxychlorquine is the cure multiple doctors and epidemiologists agree.

You are quite welcome!! TEAM BIDEN!!!
Biden is not the President until 2021.. Then I‚Äôm sure he will take questions üòÑ
Quite serious actually. I will be voting for Biden. 165k of my fellow Americans have perished under the current President, as well as millions without work. I believe it is Time for a change.  Have a great day.
I can already SEE the BIDEN/HARRIS TICKET will be a CAMPAIGN of LIES, HATE, AGAINST President Trump with OCCASIONAL SOCIALIST POLICIES INTERJECTED. By the way BLUE VOTERS, Kamala Harris is NOT a MODERATE, will TRY to APPEAR ONE, do NOT LET Kamala FOOL YOU,  check DEMOCRAT DEBATES
The fact that my mother had to push me out in december instead of november genuinely makes me upset   i would do anything to give my vote to biden
I would NEVER vote for Donald Trump or Joe Biden but Donald Trump and Joe Biden are more than welcome to vote for Me
WTF  There‚Äôs making it so easy to sit this one out!   Don‚Äôt you dare come blame me if Biden Loses this shit!!   He‚Äôs doing everything he can to tell progressive we don‚Äôt care about you!!   Harris is awful &amp; completely for sale$   #DNCisCorrupt #Clueless #help

So what do u call what Biden does?
Biden is actually right about one thing Trump has not done jack shit about Coronavirus He could have done something much earlier but He did not and We still have to deal with this shit because He will not get off his lazy ass and order more testing
I love that you named it the "Harris-Biden" Ticket...
Obviously need some corrective legislation from President Biden and oversight of postmaster
Trump's favorite tactics against his political opponents are to lie, fabricate, deceive, cheat and bully. Biden simply has to point out all of Trump's corruption, lies, abuses, racism, hate speech and failures. A mountain to work with. #dumptrump #bidenharris
Love it! An ambitious smart fine lady will have strong drive... it will strengthen #BidenHarris2020 to help us out of this chaotic created by Prez Trump. Thank you late AG Beau Biden for connecting both.
VP Pence FORGOT: Prez Obama took over a recession economy and built it up (including saving Chevy &amp; Chrysler)!!! It was broken but Obama-Biden Admin got it FIXED... then Prez Trump took over this FIXED economy and MESSED it mainly due to MISmanagement in fighting COVID-19!
Trying to pin Biden/Harris to Iranian connections is ironic considering the Trump Saudi/Russia connections. Biden was Vice MF President. I‚Äôd be worried if he DIDNT have connections with our biggest adversaries. How do you communicate without rapport?
Kamala Harris Is The Best At What She Does!!  So Very happy To See Her As Biden's Running Mate!!  Time To Get To Work!!

Trump said a very messed up thing about His daughter and was good friends with Jeffrey Epstein and Joe Biden has touched many females of all ages without consent Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure both of them are Pedophiles #EndThe2PartySystem #VoteThirdParty
Would it really surprise anyone if either Trump or Biden turned out to be pedophiles? Many people in the entertainment industry as well as business and politics have turned out to be Pedophiles so it‚Äôs possible Trump and Biden could be too and there‚Äôs clues to suggest both are
Retweet it If You are not voting for Donald Trump Like if You are not voting for Joe Biden Do BOTH  if You are not voting for either of those douchebags &lt;3
Nothing Trump can say to try to scare Americans, claiming that Biden and Harris are extremists, could be half as scary as the Hell that we have experienced for the past three and a half years and is getting worse by the day.  Nothing begins to compare. Nothing.

Timing is everything. It wasn‚Äôt his moment. It‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs moment, finally. Hopefully  Booker won‚Äôt have to wait that long.

Trust VP Biden ! Trust him to #BuildBackBetter ! We must stop the free fall of OUR people dying from COVID-19 and seriously look into Economy Recovery  2.0 (Obama-Biden was Economy Recovery 1.0)!
I‚Äôd drag my balls over a mile of broken glass to vote for Biden-Harris.
I'd vote for any of the Simpsons over Trump and Biden anyday
I remembered people pleading for Prez Obama to do something w recession after he won in 2008  even before his inauguration! People forgot it was Obama-Biden lead the recovery to a flourish economy! I strongly believe #BidenHarris2020 is the best ticket to repeat this!
Pence-ive about the future? Just Biden your time until November 4?     big announcement, tomorrow, 8/13/2020, and give your future something amazing!
Kanye will take votes away from Biden... educate yourselves my people!
They have the same mentality when Biden makes the occasional gaffe. Trump can barely string a coherent sentence together most of the time, but they fixate on a few stupid things Biden has said.
trump: I'm from missouri. If we were to move the polls and get your lead over Biden down to a point or two(within the margin of error) could we get some shiny new buses? We are working on it. VOTE ALL BLUE !!
I missed the big event with Biden &amp; Harris. Was at the Dr. finding out I might have throat cancer. yes, #afraid
I think one term is a good idea for Biden. I didn‚Äôt realize he would be so old in 4 years.

You say that but then Biden says if you don‚Äôt vote for him your not black. Like I don‚Äôt agree with both but both say dumb stuff.
That‚Äôs exactly what we want.  Tucker just made a case to elect Biden/Harris.
What should the Biden/Harris campaign song be?
if you actually listen to what gen z is saying you‚Äôd care that we‚Äôre still voting for biden in november. we‚Äôre not going to suck his dick though. we‚Äôre going to be just as critical of him as trump

Biden is life long Catholic and you know it. You're trying to deceive or just being petty This is so beneath you. Stay out of politics and take care of your flock
Yep! No way Biden has spent any resources there including get out the vote efforts
He would've cheered for whoever Biden picked lmao he has no idea what he's talking about
The upcoming election feels like 2016 all over again. I‚Äôm not a fan of Biden, but I‚Äôm sure the fuck not voting for Trump‚Äôs racist ass. üòë
that bitch K. Harris did call Joe "Dimwit" Biden a racist.  Your a stupid "Never Trumper" you azz.  No wonder I never watch your shows on Fox Business. Your A Damn idiot.
trump: Joe does smart things he is not like you and does not do things based on childish emotion. Return the country to adult leadership! BIDEN HARRIS 2020
I suppose you want four more years of hate, name calling, lying?  Biden/Harris will bring a level of decency that is now nonexistent.  They will reach across the aisle to form workable solutions to our economy, job formation, education and healthcare.  They will not obstruct.
Perhaps because she identifies as an African American.  Perhaps because her views on Biden were he was a racist pervert. #PhonyKamala #PhonyKamalaHarris
I am terrified that the constant request for money from supporters will hurt Biden and Yourself. Alot of us are about to lose our homes because of covid-19 and sudden unemloyment. My middle class community is rife with pre foreclosures. We are out here tredding water.
Have you not yet figured out trump that, in our opinion, if it comes out of your mouth it is absolutely guaranteed to be untrue. You might want to take that into account when you craft your next lie!  No! That would be clever, you are not clever.  BIDEN HARRIS 2020
The IDIOCY of the Democrats, Progressives, Liberals, Left, Radical Left, for MOST IMPORTANT JOBS in the USA, Biden &amp; Harris PORTRAY a LIE in PUBLIC to GET VOTES, &amp; in TRUTH, HATE EACH OTHER, won't SPEND MUCH TIME TALKING TOGETHER, eventually, President Harris will TAKE OVER=GOAL.
For the first time in a long while, I'm beginning to see a ray of light. Trump was already headed for the trash heap, but Biden just made a decision that will surely provide a rallying point and build unstoppable voter enthusiasm to cast their ballot for him. #VoteBidenHarris

Trump looks punch drunk. Of course he always does but I Love that he doing more to get Biden elected than perhaps anyone else. His 'handlers' can't seem to keep him under control I say let's put this mutt to sleep.
I think it was going to be Amy Klobuchar since she helped so much on the night Biden clenched the nomination; however, Biden did well to go with Kamala. Trump knows for whom the bell tolls she is that last nail in his casket.
8 years of Joe Biden &amp; 8 years of Kamala Harris
It's a debate... even VP Biden didn't hold grudges... the opponents will lose ground if go after that.
Welcome. She's an experienced politician having been the L VP nom in 96 and a candidate for Congress. Would be interesting to see her on the debate stage with Biden and Trump
That was a long time ago. Things change. Harris called Biden a racist and is now his running late. Who cares?
TY   for the friendly note to remind others that  VP Biden is NOT favor for ABOLISHING the police!!! The last headline on this matter was an interview between Prez Trump and Fox's Chris W!!!  Bet it will be repeated till election day!
No one knew Tim. Everyone knows Kamala. This is Obama/Biden take 2 not Clinton/Kaine
I'm a 60 something white man who is over the top excited to vote for Biden/Harris. I love who they are and what they stand for.
Biden was maybe my 5th choice, but this ticket is the choice. Im all in. For the first time in 4 years I feel hopeful.
Kyle all jokes aside, We have to admit we don‚Äôt respect most of his chooses anyway.   It‚Äôs Biden, he‚Äôs gonna suck regardless!! #RealityCheck
That‚Äôs Biden.     What‚Äôs the worst pick he could make?!    That‚Äôs who‚Äôs he‚Äôs going with.      #Biden is gonna beg us to blame dementia soon!!!  #Clueless

It was lost the day Biden announced his candidacy.
#Happy: Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate
how do I obtain a Biden Harris yard sign please??
Biden himself grabs the swing off his "blue collar" persona(yes i know its fake). Kamala rallies the usual base.
Harris also has a good amount of star power, and that runs the risk of her outshining Biden, particularly if they win.
That said, Harris has significant liabilities. She has one of the most Liberal voting records in the Senate, there's plenty of issues with her time as AG (which Progressives will have issues with), but I think Harris injects energy into Biden's campaign.
Looking at this objectively, I think Harris is an alright pick. Biden severely limited his options by only going for a woman pick (and it reeks of pandering too), but Harris would be a good way to reach out to sections of the Progressive base and is a good public speaker.
There's nothing pragmatic or moderate about Kamala Harris. She's one of the country's most liberal Senators and would be just as bad as a VP as Biden would be President. We can't afford their socialist agenda.
Just realized with Kamala named Biden‚Äôs VP that Maya Rudolph will make more appearances on SNL
Are we seeing white smoke coming from Biden‚Äôs home in Delaware?
Maybe this will finally wake him up.  He sold out to the establishment by endorsing Biden and they fuck him in return and don't care one bit.  He'd still have his dignity at least for endorsing Sanders.
My guess is Rice.   Harris is a lighting rod.   And he‚Äôs big on a bond.   Him and Rice are close already.     #Rice   Total guess cause Biden‚Äôs a moron and has no political Instinct!!
Don‚Äôt ever take the blame.   It belongs with the people the shoved Biden Down our throats!   They didn‚Äôt even want him.   They just got stuck with him when the other besides Bernie sucked so bad.   This is the bed the made they have to not be able to sleep in it! üòÇüòÇ
It‚Äôs also possible they just did a red herring with the list and Biden still picked Harris.
You should realize that there are voters out there who don‚Äôt flip out over every little thing like a 10 minute speech at a convention.  Biden needs those voters not just ones who tweet about Trump in jail 24/7
Me for one possibly.  I would never vote for Trump. Supported Kasich in 16. Thought I would never vote for Biden. Then I read your responses to this post and I see a lunatic just like Trump screaming over a convention speaker.
dt: Does the more testing lead to more deaths. We lead in that category too. How does that work? The person says dt's gonna test me and i don't want that thing shoved up my nose so I'm just gonna die. Are you that dumb are do you think we are? BIDEN CAN DO BETTER IN HIS SLEEP.
Trump is busy raking the forest, or drinking bleach.., oh wait that‚Äôs right he‚Äôs golfing!!! Meanwhile over 160k are gone!!! Failed President !!! Vote Biden!!!!
How much did Obama and Biden unfreeze for the Iranians?  50 billion!
We get your point. Attack China because they would prefer Joe Biden, a stable and respected person. Ignore Russia's bounties on US soldiers because Russia is interfering again to help 45 be reelected. I pray you find your soul. You need a lot more Jesus.
A Trump legacy. He's destroyed virtually all of our European allies. Fortunately, if Biden gets into the presidency, he and Obama established excellent relationships with them. My guess is that they're anxiously waiting for him to win as I am.
Poor ol‚Äô Biden can‚Äôt remember where he left off in the middle of a sentence.
When your chosen line of attack is that Biden is a frail old man who is in decline, it matters when there is video evidence showing that he is neither of those things. Let‚Äôs see Trump ride a bike. Or walk down a small hill.
Damn... you and Joe Biden must have taken the same math
The crackhead on Hollywood and Vine wit two teeth and dragging one leg thru a pool of Covid could be his pick and I‚Äôm still rolling with President elect Biden! üíô
Another stupid tweet by one of Joe Biden‚Äôs staffers.
Which tells you it‚Äôs overweighted towards Biden
Biden's campaign is dead. It will not matter who he picks.
Other than the two Joe Biden signs and one Jo Jorgensen sign that I've seen in my blue Illinois town, I've seen a lot more Trump flags, signs, and stickers than any of those!  The fake news doesn't want to admit it, but we're going to go in person and re-elect the MF'er!
He has a lot of information on his website about his platform.  To be fair to Biden, he may not be saying much about his platform, but neither is Trump. Fox News keeps giving him the biggest of softball questions, and he can't say anything specific about his goals.
I read the poll numbers constantly. I know they don‚Äôt mean much but I can fool myself into thinking Mr. Biden will surely win
He should ride a bike so he can lose some of that weight. He is obese, you know. Pro tip- maybe don‚Äôt attack Biden for being frail and locked in the basement when there is video proof that neither claim is true.
I‚Äôll see you next January after Biden‚Äôs inauguration.
I agree with every podcast/radio clip you played.  Biden has the mental acuity of a doorknob.  The best chance the Dems have of winning is to lock him in his basement until November 4.
Biden will surround himself with the best and brightest. He will have a laundry list of wrongs to right in his first days, then he and his team will have to rebuild America from the ground up. He will need a Democratic Senate and House of Reps. to accomplish this.  Vote blue.
It‚Äôs really not for Biden, but whoever he picks
As Dr Biden said on CBS Sunday morning, she is not going to call him names. It's beneath her
If Trump‚Äôs voted out of office, so is Mnuchin.  Even if he tries to say that loans must repaid, Biden will invalidate this when he takes office.  He‚Äôs just making empty threats. He‚Äôs desperate, just like the Trump. They know they‚Äôre losing and they‚Äôre resorting to fear mongering.
Prediction: trump will end up with a vaccine that Biden will be stuck with and that will not work well for black peeps because it was not well tested on them.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you like or dislike Joe Biden, that is very sad.
ABSOLUTELY, DEFINITELY, POSITIVELY OUTSTANDINGLY WONDERFUL FOR ALL HARD-WORKING AMERICAN CITIZENS, THANK YOU,  Mr President for LOVING ALL WE AMERICAN CITIZENS. If Joe Biden as a President would NEVER EVER MAKE SUCH a MOVE ... Joe Biden would RAISE OUR TAXES INSTEAD.
Mr Biden's pick is down to  or Susan Rice, BOTH with SOCIALIST IDEOLOGY.  Joe Biden's CHARACTER is HORRIBLE, picking a VP with SAME does NOT SURPRISE ME, THEY BOTH SUPPORT the SAME POLICIES.
Only way Biden wins is if his handlers lock him in the basement til November 3.  Every minute he spends in front of a mic is another minute closer to a Trump 2020 win.
If you believe this you don‚Äôt know how to read either! IT IS DEFFERED NOT DEFUND! I can‚Äôt believe how many people are purposely spreading misinformation. Biden is on record gutting Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, Welfare 3 times since 1984.
It looks like you can‚Äôt read or hear either. It‚Äôs DEFERRED NOT DEFUND! STOP SPREADING YOUR LIES! You are the same Joe Biden that has been advocating gutting SOCIAL SECURITY SINCE 1984! Don‚Äôt you remember? I do!
Joe Biden will not win the 2020 election.   Like if you agree.
Then why did Joe call Trump a xenophobe when he stopped flights from China? Why were there no supplies left for the American people? Why didn‚Äôt Obama-Biden do anything during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009?   #TrumpsCovidCoverup
I just telling myself Biden will win in November and anything Trump broke (everything) Joe will fix it.
President Trump ‚Å¶ isn‚Äôt the one advocating for abortions up until the moment of birth. I would say Trump is more a man of faith then you   Thoughts ?
Honestly, does anyone believe Biden would share such an important announcement with Fox entertainment?  I love the way the Fox entertainer tried to take a joke and make it a real story-just like they do with tRump!
Robin Williams refers to Joe Biden as rambling Joe Biden.   Must watch !
I think Biden will pick Harris
Love the mass attendance not optional reference. Reminds me of growing up in a home of faith. If you were too sick to go to mass on Sunday morning then you were too sick to do anything for the rest of the day. That knowledge usually perked me right up! Biden home sounds like mine
Can you imagine Biden talking to world leaders? If he can‚Äôt even read from a TelePrompTer, he can‚Äôt read. Being his VP WILL take over the country will not be represented. HARRIS did not win the Primary, so the people will not be represented.
What the actual fuck? Are you saying Russia is team Trump while China and Iran are team Biden? What top secret cold war bullshit is this?
Even Fox can‚Äôt hide Trump‚Äôs stupidity, corruption and incompetence forever. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much they alter their images or edit their audio, it is apparent in every word uttered from his lying mouth, and all America sees it. We‚Äôve had enough. Vote Biden and save America.
Trump and Biden will be campaigning at Ram Ranch little do they know their assholes are about to be fucked by 18 naked cowboys #RamRanch
Trump and Biden can go get fucked in the ass at Ram Ranch by 18 naked cowboys for all I care #EndThe2PartySystem #RamRanch
Joe Biden will probably choose Dick Cheney as His running mate to pander to Warmonger Rebloodlicans
Joe Biden says   #YouAintBlack
That‚Äôs not true. I vote based off who is better suited. I have concerns for both... far fewer concerns with Biden.
Oh this must be the Russian Bots trying to discredit anyone for Biden.  Too bad, sucker, it won't work this time. We will crawl on our hands &amp; knees thru broken glass, stand in the baking sun, pouring rain, sleet &amp; snow to vote for Biden. Trump will be carried out!
China versus Russia! If only someone had stood up and said stay the hell out of our elections or else: Russia Working to Damage Biden's White House Bid, Spy Agencies Say
The DNC fucked Bernie again for the worst dem candidate ever in Biden.  They'd rather lose the election with him than win with Bernie.  Its not about us, it's always been about the donors.if Biden doesn't win decisively, you aren't going to be able to vote for the better candidate you're hoping for in the future
Oh, I thought this was a joke. Well, Biden is a poor man suffering from Cognitive Decline and should not be running.
Dont assume I haven't, or that you are privy to information that I am not.  My vote is for Biden.  Have a nice day, y'all.
Biden has NO link to Epstein.  You are literally confusing him with trump. If you dont know that, you are ill-informed.
lol I can't believe what I just read. Imagine thinking a public utility is a monopoly and wanting to give responsibility of mail in ballots to a private company. No way that can go wrong.
....and I'm part of that one-third. Voted for Biden in the primaries, not going to vote for president come Nov unless Harris is replaced. There's a reason we didn't back her candidacy.
When Biden tries to claim responsibility for the Israel deal, but the people he really made a deal with come out and condemn it. Poor guy probably can't even spell Emirates.
Ralph Nader caused the Iraq War! anyway wish we had Bush back because he's better than Trump! also please vote for Biden, who supported war along with most democrats. but we all know the real iraq war culprit was the guy worried democrats were becoming too right wing
I‚Äôm voting Biden/Harris as a matter of harm reduction not harm elimination and because I‚Äôll already be there voting down ticket dem/progressive because Congress and my state politics are a mess.
Start packing your bag don and spectators ITS TIME FOR            BIDEN/HARRIS
joe biden's ability to laugh at the absurdity of trump's claims is a stupendous strategy.
He is in cognitive decline. My Father is going through the same thing. Can not keep a train of thought. This makes Biden with the Football a scary proposition.
Biden: I want to put more African American women on the federal and Supreme Court bench  Yall: Kamala isn't black enough
Hey talking loud and saying nothing Jimmie boy I see you are running scared also of Biden/Harris.üòÉüòÉ
Biden‚Äôs running mate gets announced, prison stocks go up.
Hey is ther a Joe Biden doppelganger . . . . . .or is he truly, hopefully one of a kind?
Once Biden-Harris win in November, people in positions of authority will cease their complicit acquiescence to #ThatFucker. They‚Äôll do it to save their hides. They‚Äôve already started distancing themselves from him. He will be taken OUT.
Biden/Harris ‚Äîwhat a winning combination!!
I donated to the Biden/Harris campaign last night and it sure feels good.   Please baby Jesus, don't let Trump win again. My mental health seriously can't take it. I swear the Trump administration is a HUGE reason why my depression is so bad and why my anxiety is SO HIGH.
Oh jees! She ain't the best, true. But fuck it! U can't hav ya cake n eat it 2. Dump HAS GOT 2 GO!!!! Current administration has NOT n WILL not FIX ANY of THEIR Fuck-ups! And dude will probably send us into a real life PURGE!! Fuck tht BIDEN/HARRIS 2020 (Can't be worse then this)
Who gives a Fuck!! Biden/Harris 2020. It ain't hard!!
. Joe Biden is going to win, his dementia gone fuck up and Kamala going to be the first female prez
Thankfully we didn‚Äôt have to find out how comparable it truly was because we had true leadership that took action and protected us! Had Obama/Biden been in office during COVID-19, you probably would have said the same because it too would have been contained.
Thought this was in reference to the Biden/Kamala ticket...but the Stl Blues are great too!
LOL, this is just sad üòÇ Biden/Harris has Team Trump RATTLED, y‚Äôall!
Exactly.  And did he think people should not like Biden coming through town on a hand car blasting Eddie grant? Regardless of his policies, Or how I would vote, I‚Äôm hopping on that hand car with Joe.
Doesn‚Äôt this show how hard Biden is willing to work to get where he‚Äôs going, even though he may have forgotten where that was.
I guess Biden?? Either way we still lose.
Um....i voted for Hillary and then Biden in the primary. But I'm not voting for him or trump come nov bc trump is a racist &amp; biden picked kamala. So ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Some of y‚Äôall dead ass think JOE MF BIDEN aka (creepy joe)(joe who is truly senile)(joe who said if you don‚Äôt vote for me you ain‚Äôt black)(joe who doesn‚Äôt even know where he is at most of the time) is some savior and great man who will turn this country around y‚Äôall kill me ü§£üòÇ
They‚Äôre equally bad. Biden is just a republican disguised as a Democrat.
This shld be spread and investigated ASAP  as a threat on the biden presidential nominee
Learning your candidates terrible history is not tearing down, it‚Äôs informing oneself. Why do you think young black/brown folk are not pleased? Kamala has sent so many black and brown people to their imprisonment. Regardless, Biden/Kamala have my vote. It‚Äôs the best choice.
Lol I‚Äôm not trying to tear down a black woman. In the middle of mass protests for black lives themselves and against police brutality... Biden elects a cop and prosecutor as his running mate. I would have voted for whoever Biden and his running mate would be regardless
Biden campaigning like look niggas gone vote for me regardless cause they don‚Äôt have a diverse mindset and as long as I get a nigga on the ballot I‚Äôm good . And it‚Äôs working . Y‚Äôall are eating this shit up .
Ok I can get behind that and see that but I can't pretend that Kamala Harris hasn't incessantly imprisoned people her entire career and that Biden helped deport thousands. We can't celebrate because we have to hold them accountable.
Although, if biden wins and then we had 8 years of Kamala, the natural order of things would suggest we‚Äôd have 8 years of a republican after Kamala. It pretty much always goes back and forth. I hate it here. I feel like we‚Äôre doomed.
. "The fact that Biden recognized Harris' debate performances as a sign of strength, even when she targeted him for a withering attack, is a tribute to Biden‚Äôs judgment and character ‚Äî in sharp contrast to Trump‚Äôs petty vindictiveness."
This has been Biden's theme song since at least South Carolina.
What are you holding in your hand while you watch Biden/Harris drag you for filth, a big mac or vodka on the rocks?
Biden &amp; Harris, this is what we need. Bringing our country together, not tearing us apart
Is it ‚Äú please go vote‚Äù or is it ‚Äú go vote for the democrat ‚Äú cause I‚Äôm telling you now if I go vote it won‚Äôt be for Biden
That's been Biden's theme song going back at least to South Carolina.
You say that but then Biden says if you don‚Äôt vote for him your not black. Like I don‚Äôt agree with both but both say dumb stuff.
Look, no matter how you feel about Trump, you can't actually rationalize a vote for Biden/Harris sheerly because voting for them undermines the non Trump Republican ideals you'd have to claim to  still stand for.
Do y'all not understand how awful Trump is??? Like pls just stfu and Vote Biden
We will see when the debates start. Gabbert who should be the dnc nominee destroyed Harris. Trump will destroy Biden no questions asked. How ever these should NOT be our choices. The fact they are our choices shows A. Americans are brain dead. And the government doesn‚Äôt care.
maybe you can't appreciate how ridiculous it is that the only other person they can put up to channel the anti-biden vote is KANYE WEST.
This whole post is sarcastic, I'm obviously gonna vote biden, I'm satirizing the people who actually bitch and say they won't vote for him because bernie or warren or whoever isn't the candidate. I think it wooshed you
Right. To ‚ÄúNot All‚Äù people: this will require more than voting. We have to actively defend this ticket. Anytime you hear negativity about Harris/Biden or ‚Äúthe parties are basically the same‚Äù you have to shut that shit down. No more going along to get along
Totally! He has no grip on reality. I‚Äôm a suburban ‚Äúhousewife‚Äù that works and so are most of my friends. We‚Äôre all voting for Biden!
LOL üòÇ These Republicans are turning out to be pretty great hype men for Biden/Harris 2020, tbh.   Bless their dumb little hearts üòÇ
People....LISTEN!!! Don't waste your time and energy on these naysayers and distractions. We have work to do!! Vote for Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris!! üëçüñ§üëç‚ù§üëçüíôüëçüíúüëçüíñ
And she is why we have. Trump. Biden will be why we have him again. I don‚Äôt see how dems do not see this. To be honest if they went with gabbert or yang they had my vote. But i could never think of voting Biden.
Biden cannot be President!! USMC
It's not small. Do not under estimate them or their support. I have a feeling their numbers are about to balloon bc of this Biden decision.
Do y‚Äôall really think Biden will win???
If anything Harris is back walking some of her primary talking points in order to fall in line with Biden.
my normie friend called me an 'extremist' cos i said i would've preferred bernie than biden as the candidate omg
I didn't put trump there. It's not my job to remove him. &amp; you're right, she's not the right kind of blk bc blkness is not flat. Seems like yt ppl are about to learn a valuable lesson about blk ethnicities. I voted for Biden in the primary. I will not be voting for him in Nov.
Getting his formaldehyde booster shots from Biden‚Äôs dr
Biden and Harris ain't looking at us, they're looking past us because they know they have black folks in their pocket. Are they the lesser of two evils? - Yeah, but how long are we going to be OK with evil?
Now do Biden
anybody who thinks biden and trump are "equal evils" hasn't been effected by trumps active anti-lgbt legislature/rhetoric. as a queer person, i implore every single one of you to pull your heads out your ass and do the right thing for fucking once and vote blue, even if it's hard
At this rate I‚Äôm just not voting this year. I hate Biden and I refuse to have a cop (former or otherwise) in the White House. Lmao
I love you both! I can‚Äôt wait to vote Biden/Harris in November!
Biden also has no selling points....
Biden isn‚Äôt much better than Mr. Cheeto but the circumstances may be different if he‚Äôs elected ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
ü§£ü§£ü§£ you wish! In my suburban neighborhood, I see LOTS of Black Lives Matter and Biden signs. Only ONE home with your name, on a lady's home who is well known to be crazy. This suburban woman is ALL IN for #BidenHarris2020
I vote every election. I will not be voting for biden bc of his VP pick. Down ballot for me. Never thought I'd say that but here we are. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è No more cosplay symbolism. I want African-Americans in real positions of power, making real ADOS moves &amp; I want it now.
For the first time in a while? I guess he forgot that Biden was VP
I‚Äôll still vote for Biden, but let‚Äôs not celebrate kamala Harris as some progressive savior.
Ever since Kamala got picked as Biden‚Äôs running mate it‚Äôs just been one big divide amongst that decision.
Yes I am. She's not African-American AND she's married to a yt man. It's a HELL no. Biden should have read the room. He had a list of qualified African-American women to choose from &amp; he instead opted for the biracial Indian Jamaican raised in Canada &amp; married to a yt man.
He‚Äôs even ready for Biden to take over.
Trump is the phony one and is going to lose to Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris. That is why Trump is trying to CHEAT and wants help from Putin!
Kamala Harris as a running mate is a power move by Biden!!
i cant believe joe biden is our best option why
Biden only chose Kamala as VP for the pass
Liberals say ACAB and defund the police and then tell people to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the solution to that with no irony whatsoever
But yea imma still vote for Biden. Sucky option but shit anybody but Trump
I do mam.   Aint nobody said they aren't voting. We're not happy about it. Joe Biden is literally racist as hell and Kamala put people in jail like a human terrarium.
"Descendant of Jamaican slave owner who was a ruthless prosecutor of petty misdemeanors becomes 1994 crime bill writer, Joe Biden's, VP."  Why would anyone question this combination, right?
Every day Biden is doing everything in his power to get people to not vote for him
A little disappointed that Biden didn‚Äôt choose Seven as his runningmate, but whaddya gonna do?
Many people know that Biden has mentally slowed and the VP will be president...arguing about Kamala record won‚Äôt work...it‚Äôs not happening
Y‚Äôall shit talked Hilary so bad and look where it got us. Don‚Äôt let history repeat itself. We need Kamala just as much as Biden right now. We gotta get Trump out of office .... it‚Äôs been a shitty 4 years. I‚Äôm good on 4 more lol
Ready For Progressü•∞ Team Biden, Harris and WE The  PEOPLE Winning the 2020 Election war. GOD'S Blessings and Favor every Second of every day.   and
In comparison to the segregationist Joe Biden, she looks far-left.
That's not hard considering that Biden is senile.  Doesn't matter matter though because people don't like her. That's why she dropped out of the primary 3 months before Iowa.
These people are just like Biden. They think that all Black people are exactly the same.
My prediction for Biden‚Äôs cabinet picks: Attorney general Val Demings Treasury sec: Elizabeth Warren  Chief of staff: Cory Booker HUD secretary: Bernie Sanders Foreign policy: Valerie Jarrett
Perfect! One more reason to vote Biden/Harris!
Who is, do you have a list, everyone I know still on board with TRUMP 2020, who in their right mind would vote for Biden.
Y'all think its jokes but that show Veep was real shot. Nobody's actually a true liberal and everything is driven by money. You know damn well Kamala and Biden kissed and made up for the power.
Yo this wasn‚Äôt even to your tweet üòÇüòÇ I clicked the wrong one. I‚Äôm hella impressed with Melo. This was to somebody Joe Biden tweet right above or below yours üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump‚Äôs line about Kamala being Biden‚Äôs living will was pretty good
Biden should have picked Al Jolson as his Vice President
In a STUNNING historic moment for the US, Biden's selection of Kamala Harris shows all POC women that they too can make it in America, provided that they spend three decades making life worse for their peers.
Biden is so weak that I'm guessing he will be under her....  Wait, you meant betting?
She and Biden are going to kick you and Aryan Pence's ass!  I can't wait for the debates.
"In selecting Harris, Biden demolished the misogynistic memes and condescending statements circulating about her 'ambition.' Yes, an ambitious, powerful woman is just the sort of person Biden wants to associate with."
Great choice Mr. Biden!!!!
to say there is absolutely no qualitative difference between a trump presidency + a biden presidency is wrong  flat out  debate nuances all you want but, if you‚Äôre not actively organizing for a legitimate/viable third party option...it‚Äôs quiet for that  üíõ‚ö°Ô∏è
Biden was maybe my 5th choice, but this ticket is the choice. Im all in. For the first time in 4 years I feel hopeful.
Does she still believe Biden's accusers?
the biden/harris administration has promised that under their watch there will be no more "kids in cages". all the kids they deport will be free range and certified organic
I‚Äôm so happy about this! Can‚Äôt wait to vote Biden/Harris in November!
and jill biden is no slouch. it's such a remedy for melania.
just the optics of the biden/harris ticket are stupendous. smiling, happy vibes. and sorry but she is SO damn good-looking.
Definitely not a fan of Harris being Biden‚Äôs running mate
That awkward moment when y‚Äôall thought a Biden/Harris ticket was gonna do much better
Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris as VP
Biden Harris 2020. Thats the tweet. #BidenHarris2020 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Kamala Harris: Joe Biden is a racist  Joe Biden: I'm looking for a woc to be my running mate  Kamala Harris:

So does Biden‚Äôs pick of  as VP speed up Trump dumping Pence for Nikki Haley? #BidenVP
Biden /Harris... I love this VP pick!! #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #KamalaHarrisForVP
Both the Democratic and Republican Party are jokes. Now how the hell Kamala gone sit up here a few months ago during the debates and say Biden is racist &amp; all this other shit &amp; then turn around and be his Vice President??? Man where Dr. Umar at when you need him.
Boy Biden desperate for them black votes ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mateüá¨üáßüáØüá≤üíï
He‚Äôs not going to recommend we inject bleach into people to cure COVID, so I‚Äôm much more confident in him than the current POTUS. Imagine making fun of Biden when the alternative can‚Äôt even answer a question without losing his train of thought.
Biden‚Äôs VP is Ben Shapario‚Äôs wife‚Äôs DAP ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
I mean the two are interchangeable right?! They're both pedophiles. No a "big deal" to swap one pedophile with mouth diarrhea for another pedophile with.... mouth diarrhea?  But that one was about Joe Biden üòï
You KNOW Biden is a pedophile right? And (if) he is "elected" as he rambles on with late stage dementia, his pedophile friends will then have the power to make his choices for him. Stop being so willfully ignorant‚úå‚ô° üñï
What about what he said about Joe Biden?! ‚ô°
Susan rice is about as close as Biden could get to Hillary. Take the L
This is 100% a meme making fun of Biden, but gotcha...
Y'all be so quick to diss biden on his low cognitive functions as if trump isn't doing the same ass thing
Biden saying he would choose a woman for VP so early in the election cycle was 100% pandering but it was a promise he made. If he chooses Pete lmao man, my dude. You're gonna make people so mad.
I have also stopped following Joe Biden
This is ridiculous.  He is just basically getting free ads against Biden.   Thats all this is.
Why does Trump want to Debate Biden at all?  He gets to lie, unchecked, at his basic "rally" , what used to be a press counference.
I thought, and still think, that Biden made a huge mistake when he committed to selecting a woman. This demand is another very poor idea. There are many highly qualified candidates. Biden should choose one who (1) will be a good VP and (2) wants the job.
I‚Äôd like to propose a live pay per view event: Joe Biden attempting to sing ‚ÄúThe Itsy Bitsy Spider‚Äù all the way through from memory. Think of how much money the betting industry would make.
Yes i do. Because just like with Hillary be trump I‚Äôd rather see what happens with him than Biden. Again if if we‚Äôre tulsi gabbert I‚Äôd be voting for her 100%
I‚Äôve also stated if it was yang or gabbert over trump I‚Äôm going with yang or gabbert. Biden has been in politics for 50 years and has done nothing good for the American ppl.
I‚Äôve said that in almost all of my reply‚Äôs....the current outspoken dems have made me turn more towards rep and that unfortunately means trump. The bullshit system should not be giving us this 2 party bs. We should not be voting between trump/Hillary or trump/Biden. All shit.
A. I do not watch the news.  B. I‚Äôm not on a side. Well the American ppl side. C. I do not have a team. I do not have a stake in the game. I don‚Äôt treat politics like a religion like the rest of the ppl commenting.  D. If you think Biden will do any good look into what he‚Äôs done
Not condoning the riots. Not letting ag Barr talk at the hearing. Using joe Biden as a puppet. Saying to defund the police. Calling trump a nazi. Calling anyone who disagrees a nazi. Cancel culture. Trying to remove guns. Using covid to sway the election. The list goes on.
First off only idiots and old ppl watch the news. Secondly I‚Äôm not on a side. Well atm I am more on the trump side due to how crazy dems are being and their silly ass choice in Biden. But like I‚Äôve said I would of voted dem if it was gabbert or yang. Fuck even Bernie.
Lol. First of all sure bud. Second of all idc. Biden is a shit human. Just like trump. Neither should be president. Biden has done nothing good for this country in the 50 years he‚Äôs been a politician. Dems should of went with yang or gabbert and you would have so many more ppl.
Joe Biden can‚Äôt even handle a debate due to his cognitive decline. Either he‚Äôs a robot or he‚Äôs really in a fast, downward spiral. How would he focus on climate when the coronavirus has everyone‚Äôs attention? What about the kids being rescued? #SaveTheChildren
this is the hollywood version of "they are dating," if biden even talks to a woman. every conversation puts her on the 'short list'. this ain't the one,
Democrats should have been on TOP OF THIS STORY FROM DAY 1.  I am sure the machines are programmed to "switch" Biden votes to TRUMP votes.   We are doomed! ü§¨
I would STILL vote for Biden!!
No Democrat/Biden supporter should vote by mail or use anything but a paper ballot. It‚Äôs insane we are waiting around for Trump to completely corrupt our election. He should be removed now.
Then phone bank for biden getting mad on here isnt helping your cause
Just make calls for joe biden
Trump has accomplished more in 3 years with constant daily attacks on him than biden has in 40 years but hey joe means business now
And hillary was innocent of all the crimes even comey had to admit she did right ???? And biden is a genious right lol???? Admit it you hate america !!!! Trump lowered your taxes fool. Trump stopped the tax of $1600 per year on people that didnt have insurance which was illegal
As of the day you announced that you were running you NEVER had my vote. Biden is not perfect. But he‚Äôs not you. And I would vote for that guy who makes a asinine statement over someone who is a complete ass any day.  How many more people died today because of YOU
Yeah Biden hates that passage where Jesus slipped in the extra commandment "Thou shall not leave the house without packin"
I mean the whole talking point(maybe not with you) is that he‚Äôll pull votes away from Biden. Like maybe that‚Äôs the mistake of the dnc for putting Biden on the podium. And while,I‚Äôll likely vote Biden- I do think the dnc deserves to burn.You're not the only one!
I guess fb is saying biden is committing sexual activity on children because they blocked me for this.
I guess fb is even saying biden is committing sexual activity on children because they blocked me
I guess Facebook is even saying biden is committing sexual activity on children
So I guess you are a biden did sexually assaulted these children
Consider it done! üòä
I'll add you too Tony, if that's okay with you üòâ
Thanks. I checked the link. Looks like you have her pegged.  Contriving outrage for that crowd is pretty standard. I'm sure at a certain point Biden will issue a courtesy statement of condolence. I don't think norms define what that time frame needs to be.
I gotcha! üòä
Oh shit they got CELEBRITIES?? I'm voting Joe Biden for sure ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
You're making me hungry! üòÇ
Well there is no way on gods earth biden would be potus for 8 years, but he‚Äôs definitely a neo-liberal even though I don‚Äôt think he has the mental capacity to know what he is right now!
bsolutely right, but if you wanna win let‚Äôs play smart ppl come on ü§£ nobody here likes Biden either dam calm down
You want Joe Biden for years 47,48,49&amp;50 in DC?
Wtf fb I guess you are saying biden did something wrong if your blocking it.
Oh please, please, I love paying for healthcare. I need that boot in me, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Keep it up folks!!
Thanks  You're the best! üòä‚ù§üôè
üòÇ  ...so much identity. That‚Äôs why you people lose.  The American public decided. We‚Äôd rather have a cretin that gets stuff done, than a congenial failure.  Biden is going to get crushed in November.
Do you REALLY believe Joe Biden is coherent enough to be President?
Now that the Democrats have chosen the descendent of a slave owner,   ‚Äî&gt;who jailed thousands of blacks for minor marijuana violations &lt;‚Äî  for their VP nominee we can stop canceling people for things they or their ancestors did in the past? üëÄ   #Biden
Yes ! I believe that‚Äôs why there off until Labor Day so they can make mass copies of mail in fraud and also I believe that #kamalaHarrass will be eventually claiming #biden of sexual harassment to take over for the far left
So Biden said if you don‚Äôt vote for him #YouAintBlack, majority of the Black community don‚Äôt even vote so it‚Äôs gone be a lot of melanin being taken after the electionüò≠
Biden/Harris going up tomorrow!!
Calling Biden senile is slander.
My favorite new conspiracy theory, which I'm making up right now, is that Donald had him killed because he found out Robert was going to vote for Biden.

If you get into a debate with someone regarding Biden's stance on policy, you must have this website ready. Put in your phone and just click on it and you'll be armed with facts. Facts that will drive the Dem/Socialists crazy!! #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #Trump2020LandslideVictory
I'll answer: in the short term, no Trump is likely worse. But in the long term...well, the environment brought on by the Obama admin paved the way for Trump. If Biden enacts a status quo policy, the next "Trump" to come along will likely be far worse.
Agree. Speaking of... where is Mike Bloomberg  and Tom Steyer  with help for Biden/Harris.
Because Bernie and leftist activists pushed him and the whole entire Democratic Party to the left. Really simple, keep pushing and we get results like Biden‚Äôs policies
Translation:  Vote early so the public is as misinformed as possible hoping that the media can carry Joe Biden and his dangerous past to the promised land.    Biden supporters can't even name a single one of his policies.  47 years in office and nothing to show for it.
So glad I missed it but heard you endorsed Biden. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt elect stupid people...‚Äù
if Biden doesn't win decisively, you aren't going to be able to vote for the better candidate you're hoping for in the future
Totally agree. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm voting for the Biden Harris ticket. Need to get the stupid people out of office now.
Count me in.
The new Biden signs are a fuckin trip
Similar to how Kamala Harris‚Äôs opinions on Joe Biden changed as soon as the circumstances became convenient.
How's the tapioca, Joe Biden?

Oh, I thought this was a joke. Well, Biden is a poor man suffering from Cognitive Decline and should not be running.
Dont assume I haven't, or that you are privy to information that I am not.  My vote is for Biden.  Have a nice day, y'all.
Hell no! He's gotta be held accountable but we gotta get him in first. Pointing out how shitty biden is is only hurting the cause and making people want to vote 3rd party. That shit will get trump reelected.
So, actively campaigning for Biden now
See, that's the thing - defeating trump IS what is best for the country. Biden isn't not the best candidate, but he is far from the worst. Any state he would leave the country in is infinitely better off than what trump would do and has already done.

That's cute, this post is about Biden, not an idiot named Trump. We can discuss both. As I said, vote for who you want but don't play like Biden's all there still.
Biden has NO link to Epstein.  You are literally confusing him with trump. If you dont know that, you are ill-informed.
I want to see this interview so bad.  Anything we can do to put pressure on the Biden campaign?
I wouldn‚Äôt call Biden unhinged I would call him demented.
Is that what I said? He has policies and I'm sure i disagree with most of them. I don't like biden but we have 2 fucking choices, its either going to be biden or trump. Anyone who can't see how much worse it'll be with trump is an idiot
For the record Biden‚Äôs not running against Clinton or Obama. He‚Äôs running against Trump, a man who not only doesn‚Äôt read, but can‚Äôt read, and who has the vocabulary of a poorly educated 10 yr old. Trump spends all day watching TV, he‚Äôs Chance the Gardner with a bad attitude
You might not, but most of America without a voice is rooting for him. I guess you want high taxes, no defense against criminals and lawlessness, because that is what you'll get with Biden.
Imma tell all the seniors what they told me about Bernie Sanders.  ‚Äú I like Joe Biden, but he‚Äôs too old. I can‚Äôt vote for him‚Äù.   It‚Äôs my turn. üôÉ
Yes, they are right in saying Trunp is a shit sandwich, but Biden is closer to a plate of used tampons than chicken.
Have you watched any videos of Biden? I genuinely believe that you should go watch a video of him from 2008 - or even 2016 &amp; then watch one from now. Then come back &amp; tell me if you think he's as mentally coherent now as he was. Vote for who you want but at least know what's up.
About the time of Biden‚Äôs inauguration?
No one other than Joe Biden thinks Joe Biden is going to be President.

Biden only stands a chance of winning because Trump is handling this pandemic so poorly. But, with the Senate on break till mid September, a new relief bill will come by October and Trump will take full credit for it, giving him a boost in the polls.
Of course, Obama wanted one of his former administration officials!  A deep state employee who Obama can control from the outside in.  But Biden chose a Neoliberal and not the Deep State.  Ha!

lol I can't believe what I just read. Imagine thinking a public utility is a monopoly and wanting to give responsibility of mail in ballots to a private company. No way that can go wrong.
Trump is getting free campaign coverage from the media just like he did in 2016.  The media made Trump.  Biden should do it too. #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
But that's my point - Biden does better with those groups, but Obama did too!  Tammy Baldwin does too in WI, Gary Peters in MI, there are obviously more examples.  To me the takeaway might be that HRC was UNIQUELY bad with those groups, but other D's are less bad.
This is the plan all along. To completely "overwhelm" certain people to the point where they think Biden is the only way to stop it. Overlooking the fact that Trump is doing all the right things for Americans, which is why the global elites created the mess in the first place.
This speaks volumes on how the Dems view Biden. This is why Obama picked him for VP
Again, has it?  I'm totally willing to be convinced by data here, but Biden is as normal of a D as it gets and it certainly seems right now like his EC disadvantage will be smaller than HRC's in 2016.
....well with 50+ percent of the vote in Biden won the connectucut primary.
That dumbass IQ4.5 has just made the stupidest political mistake that, I'm sure when  adds this swell tide to that election probability algorithm, Biden jumps from 71% to 95%...
And if Biden &amp; Kamala do win we need to be at inauguration with #MedicareForAll signs and chant so loud we drown out his speech.  A million chanters would be a good start.

Smart. Skilled.  Approachable. Good match for Biden because she has strong skills that will compliment his.
And by conservative I mean from Biden's perspective - the bar being winning the PV by 3.5 feels like a bit (only a bit) of overkill.
Biden in bed with China? you choose?  In 2013, Hunter Biden signed a multibillion-dollar deal with the state-owned Bank of China only 12 days after visiting China with his father. The deal created a private equity fund called BHR to invest Chinese money overseas.   Well Well yes.
Bad logic. The world is not as binary as it is in your head. Exit polling told another story. People voted Biden because they ate the media narrative on electability and the constant tearing down of Sanders.
Good question. +Canada and Mexico doesn‚Äôt want us.

Biden has complete coherent sentences. Unlike trump who rambles and makes absolutely no sense, unless of course you have a 5th grade reading and comprehension ability like most of his supporters.
"Trump/Pence will keep your mouth full of American meat!" No, that's not it. "Vote Biden/Harris if you don't like a hot beef injection"  That's not it. "Everyone in this room loves a big piece of meat in their mouth" Not quite right.

I think I was blown away by how much of the executive branch was run by norms, and not laws. That will be our undoing. If Biden wins, he's got to work with Congress to actually put laws in place.
I believe the American people  deserve a full medical report on Biden's cognitive abilities. It wouldn't surprise me that Biden's faking? Democrats are ruthless scrums and would give up their Grand children for their agendas.

I know!  I was attacked today by fellow Biden/Harris supporters because I was calling for Democratic unity to win this thing! They attack folks who supported other primary candidates.  Jesus, it was the primary, now it is over.  How do they expect to win general elections!

But according to The Cheeto, the 1917 Spanish Flu is what ended that War. Lol. People have the nerve to talk about Biden tho
Far enough left for you that you fail to see they have been moving hard left of where they were years back, or in Biden's case, before the candidates left of him pushed his platform left over the last year. Take the W's &amp; keep pushing. Cynicism won't move anyone
Glad to know that you speak for "ALL" Black Americans. After-all you ain't black if you don't vote for Biden, right?
It was literally in her platform during her presidential campaign and Biden's platform now also calls to end the death penalty, and end federal use of private prisons. He supports decriminalizing weed. She says legalize it like CA did. Ur so caught up in being mad they aren't...
Curious how could you go from calling Biden a racist, to being the ‚Äúblack face‚Äù for his campaign. Just plain disgraceful.
If Biden becomes President, and God forbid, Biden is forced to step down, we would have President Harris! I could accept a President Pence if Trump would step down, but not President Harris!

This is spot on (thread)..üëáüèΩ  Biden is badly miscalculating by playing up panic porn. America has had enough. It wants:  -Schools open -Restaurants open -People back to work -College football -Minimal, reasonable social distancing -Individuals empowered to manage their own risk
Voter Fraud has ALWAYS been a more real problem and a more credible threat than voter suppression. Voter suppression requires you know how someone plans to vote. And there's only one candidate who claims to be entitled to votes: Joe "if you don't vote me you ain't black" Biden
Every Berner I know would happily support AOC for president including myself. I don't think you've got the read you think you do on his previous supporters. There are a variety of women Berners have suggested since Bernie stabbed us in the back to endorse Biden.
But trying to make this an issue just guarantees people will cry fowl on election night. If Trump wins, the dems will bitch about "voter suppression" and if Biden win Trump will bitch about voter fraud. But only one of those two has a leg to stand on.

Holy cow. Ok. Nowhere did I say that Trump was good, or even better than Biden. The question was: You're assuming that Biden will make a good pick for SC. Why would you assume that? And what will your response be when it's a bad pick just like the ones he's made in the past?

I'm shocked at my own inclination to vote for Biden not necessarily because it says anything about me, but because the last 6 months of Trump, Qanon, and Covid19 have been so abysmal that I just have to do my part to make sure Trump loses. And I absolutely despise Kamala.
Ah so when you support Joe Biden who‚Äôs says ‚Äúyour ain‚Äôt black‚Äù if you‚Äôre black and don‚Äôt support him, or who says all black people are the same or who did the eulogy for this man he‚Äôs holding hands with, you‚Äôre not a racist?

Ok Jared! Stop this silliness. Congratulations, no one believes you were ever going to vote for Biden anyway.
Imagine if Biden tried to get rid of idk, say the US Postal Service, in order to help himself win re-election. I bet the media would lose their minds over that.

Trusting Kamala Harris to do right by Black people is like trusting Joe Biden around your children.
I am honestly curious on why you are so angry with me? We both want Biden/Harris to win and defeat Trump, move our country forward with progressive policies. BTW, I live in a lower middle class neighborhood of a large city, no HOA for me.

Casting a vote for Joe Biden will not defeat US fascism, it will not start a revolution. Little, if anything at all, will change under Biden. It will give people a false sense of hope. Again, fascism did not start in the US with Donald Trump, and will not end with Donald Trump
The only thing that can stop fascism is REAL CHANGE for the working class, and Biden does not bring that to the table.
Fascism requires control of the government to be in the hands of a few. Biden has repeatedly catered to the wealthy elites, said nothing will fundamentally change for them, and that they would keep their standard of living.
The Democratic Party will not compromise with the people for basic necessities, but they WILL, however, sit down and willingly compromise with fascists. That is just as bad. Maybe Joe Biden‚Äôs not a fascist to your definition, but he‚Äôs a racist, neoliberal, war criminal.
I feel like it‚Äôs really important for people to understand that fascism didn‚Äôt start with trump and it won‚Äôt end with trump and if we want to actually get rid of fascism in the US, we‚Äôre gonna need to do a hell of a lot more than vote for Joe freaking Biden

Be an adult and vote for Biden like the rest of us. Enough of this childish bullshit.
How is that clear, when all we had was him losing the first 3 states, then a total DNC reshuffle with everyone dropping out except a spoiler for sanders and everyone else rallies behind biden to prop up a single establishment candidate.
so do you think a Biden presidency would not clearly be a reduction of harm, policy-wise, as compared to a second Trump term?
Because if you were going to hold the microphone up to your face, the phone would naturally be upside down in your hands, you dolt.
We definitely don't want him to honestly on-paper win the election though. If only because it forces him to falsify or ignore results. Like yeah its naive to act like voting Biden is "enough" but the value of voting is still greater than zero.
No I was trying figure out what was outrageous, what has happened now that Biden needs to call out. I can‚Äôt watch/to politics where I am at today. trump supporters.
Hey what's Missouri's COVID numbers looking like with Parson and a Republican Assembly?

4 of trump, but you wont' get 8 of Biden. You get 2 Biden, 2 harris, and 8 of Tom Cotton
If Biden were ever to become President, we would get five for one or 4.5 for one. There is Doper valley girl Buppie Kamala, Self hating Israel hating Bernie, the Squad, Al Sharpton and at least half of Biden's half brain. So 1/2 x 1/2 plus 4 equals 4 and a half for one Joe.

There is a lot of truth in this statement. Remember, more than once Rashida Tlaib has said she does not favor a 2 state solution. Just one state. She said it again recently on an interview on why she won't endorse Biden.
Yes they have been doing that for 50 plus years. They also said Iran and China are working to help Joe Biden. Unfortunately there's not a way to prevent all the foreign influence. People need to be smarter than to look at something on Facebook or Twitter when they vote.

Trump is also terrible and incompetent. Biden is colonialist. Trump is a white supremacist. Biden is also racist, but not a xenophibic nationalist.   We need a left party, but that isn't happening this time.   Let Dems lose to show 'em? That's what we did in 2016. It didn't work.
I truly believe most Trump voters and Biden voters are good people but in the end, everyone thinks the vengeance baked into their own party's platform is born from pure righteousness. There's nothing particularly magnanimous coming from the Democrat side of the aisle either.
It's so difficult. I did not vote for Hillary, and I do not believe I was responsible for Trump. However, this time I feel like if I would be. I have been voting third party in the GE for over 30 yrs. For the same reasons you just changed. Biden is terrible and incompetent.
I look at it this way- even if you aren't super excited about either candidate- Do you want to have the opportunity to ever vote for a candidate you really like? Then vote for Biden, because I seriously question the survival of democracy w/ 4 more years of Trump.   Not hyperbole.

The Biden DOJ is going to be very busy.
Nothing would help me vote for tyrannical and unconstitutional policies perpetrated and glorified by  won‚Äôt go for them I don‚Äôt think and if Biden doesn‚Äôt debate Trump, it‚Äôs definitely FOUR more years of Trump.
I hope everyone left of center who's attacking Biden and Harris right now will keep doing that after they win, and during their next primary, when it's actually helpful to any ideology left of center to do so

You know the masks only work if it covers the mouth AND NOSE. Judging by these tweets, Jefferson City has a massive #maskhole problem and the COVID has ravaged your lungs bad enough that it has diminished the oxygen supply to your brain.

I‚Äôm only the Assistant Manager of Antifa and I ain‚Äôt ridin with Biden.
But liberals don‚Äôt care that Governor Blackface is still in office. Smh
Bullshit. My left nut would do a better job than trump. Biden sucks but anyone is better than trump.
If I‚Äôm Trump I would have had secret service escort this smug asshole out of the building and revoke his press pass. Why does he tolerate this level of disrespect? It‚Äôs not a serious question, it‚Äôs sound bite to try and make the President look like a liar to help Biden campaign.
There isnt anything Trump or anyone else could do that hasnt already been done. Maybe if Cuomo didn't cram those sick people into retirement homes we could shave about 60,000 off that number.   You can't even make a case for Biden without mentioning Trump. Pathetic.
Missouri is in play for Joe Biden. That's all I needed to hear today to makeup for  terrible service.
I guess you are right. All of the left, Pelosi, dem Senators, candidates including Biden called his shutdown to China racist. Then Europe. Now they say he did nothing. What did any of them do? They didn‚Äôt say anything because they wanted COVID to hurt Americans &amp; stop his winning
I didn‚Äôt realize you were encouraging your constituents to vote for Biden/Harris, Senator. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll appreciate your endorsement.
Off topic Don - you were right about Biden needing to pick Cuomo. Bravo!
riden with biden? sounds like a take off of the trumptrain
It's pharisaical to look at Biden's legislative career of supporting abortion, his vow to rescind HHS exception &amp; his joining 2 men in a civil union &amp; say he's in a state of mortal sin?  Try it's common sense. Or else the Church would allow abortion, birth control &amp; gay marriage.
I totally agree. We have a shortage of everything because dumb and dumber have failed to lead. I‚Äôm tired and ready for this to be over. With dumb and dumber in office, it will never end. Give me Biden/Harris. He could have picked Scooby Doo and I would still vote for him.

Marine Todd for Biden-Harris
I was waiting until he picked his VP to get a sign. It‚Äôs still early for that. Lawrence O‚ÄôDonnell just showed the latest Fox News poll - Biden 49%, Trump 42%. He‚Äôll lose if we crawl thru broken glass to vote.
Biden has the experience &amp; people to execute a strategy to contain Covid-19. You have consistently DENIED science -the death of 166k is on YOU! Everything you claim abt Biden is just a projection of your incompetence. Mary is spot on abt u. #Tre45on
Reality is Biden believes he's buried the progressive left.  Only question that remains is whether the progressive left chooses to be left for dead.  Personally, I think not.
Does the Biden campaign have approval from the Vatican to use the images of the Pope? Did they approve the spot before Biden started running it?  If so, that's yuge.
I'm now Officially Over my "vote for the candidate with whom I truly agree" phase. Go Biden/Harris 2020, and I do hope that the screaming entertainers of Faux News learn to pronounce Senator Harris's first name.
He had their spouses on the phone. He was holding the speakers facing the computer‚Äôs microphone so everyone could hear. More importantly, why does a phone picture take  attention at all?

There is always this built-in assumption that Biden will nominate someone even slightly progressive to the SC. Where does that come from? And what happens when he puts a centrist or conservative forth instead?
Not to mention doesn‚Äôt it undermine the woman getting picked if you tell her she‚Äôs signing on to the kind of campaign described here, which Biden‚Äôs is not? ‚ÄúLook lady I‚Äôm here to tell you chose poorly in accepting the 2nd most powerful position in American government.‚Äù
While biden and kamala are, in the grand scheme of things, a center right ticket, if they are elected (and deliver on campaign promises) they will be the most progressive POTUS and VP im history

Exactly!  You'd think this would be alarming, yet...same ol tweets of outrage and no one stops him.  How is Biden planning on getting elected without a fair voting process?  It's so absurd that it's almost unbelievable.
So today...  ... Trump advanced world peace while...  ... Biden PO'd even Left Media by not taking questions + declared he'd make everyone wear a mask outdoors.  Team Trump wins today's round.
I really feel like it‚Äôs 2016 all over again for some. Some Progressive Dems won‚Äôt vote for Biden. Is it a Bernie or Bust thing? To me it seems any excuse is used to validate their choice. We need to ramp up our support and participation. #BidenHarris2020Landslide

Of course the job of campaigning is very different from the job of holding office; Obama may have selected Biden for the latter rather than the former, and being considered fairly competent as a VP may have compensated for his lack of skill as a primary campaigner.

It is impeachable, but Senate will not remove.  It will be a distraction from Biden and Harris and other Democrats running for election and reelection right now.  Since the results are a foregone conclusion, imo, it would be better to use our resources on the election.

A sincere question here: with you obviously being against both of the top 2 Presidential candidates, are you saying that 4 years of Biden will be just as bad(if not worse) than 4 more years of Trump?
You either wanna argue or debate. I can't tell. My argument is that if we want to get to M4A, which I do, that's a goal, where we are NOW IN THE PRESENT, looks like a massive uprising in the streets by extension of what already has started with BLM protests. esp w biden in

had a nightmare that joe biden slapped my ass and said ‚Äútell Twitter you got a groovy shitter‚Äù
So Joe Biden just put someone on the ticket with him who implied that he was a racist and said that his sexual harassment allegations should be heard. I thought he was running AGAINST Trump?! ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but ‚Äúhistory‚Äù and whatnot.
Yeah... the binary decision is seriously crazy and ridiculous. But, for right now, it‚Äôs what we have. Biden could have selected Bing Bong from ‚ÄúInside Out‚Äù and I would still be voting for Dems. ü§£
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
The real winner of the Biden VP sweepstakes: Elizabeth Warren.
Joe Biden in email to supporters:
Biden selected California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
I don‚Äôt think she was even the safest choice, but I do think she was the most politically expedient choice. Biden probably views those two as the same thing, though.
God please spare me from the inevitable fancams of Biden-Harris that will come out in the next few days
Biden and Harris, the ultimate buddy cop duo
It‚Äôs just the third time in history a woman has been chosen as a running mate on a major party presidential ticket
Bill Kristol acting like Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline is alllllllll apart of the plan lol
Now honestly ask yourself to name 10 people voting for Biden, and 5 ppl who have his sign in their yard...... they honestly think we‚Äôre all this dumb......
I think the VP is gonna be told, 'Don't think -- even if you become president -- that you're running this show. You're gonna be a figurehead just like Biden is.' That's part of the deal.
The FBI said in a statement that it had received the subpoena and that the bureau had already been producing documents and information for Johnson's committee.
The choice offers Biden an unusual opportunity to unify a party still reeling from Trump's 2016 win and solidify its future.
I would love to know what their Plan B is if Biden can‚Äôt get to the election. They gotta be worried about that themselves.
That only shows how stupid Biden &amp; the DNC are!!!!

Neal (atneal_katyal), Biden and Harris should sue the insane Russian asset for injunctive relief re the Post Office dismantle, and you should represent them. Also, request appt. of a master to take over the USPS. File it Monday.  Thanks!
Don't know for sure whether Biden &amp; Harris have standing. One way to find out, file the suit. About appointment of a master, maybe, given Trump's statements &amp; PG's actions and conflicts of interest.
Wondering whether Biden and Harris would have standing to sue for injunctive relief.  Also wondering whether a court could be persuaded to appoint a master to take over the USPS, given Trump's admissions.
Or it‚Äôs a holiday based on this topic and they both reported a fact. Do you want Biden to change the statistics for originality points.
Vice President Biden is lying to Americans in order to advance his agenda. We‚Äôve seen countless examples of cheat-by-mail over the past few months, but he would like you to believe those were made up. Another lying Liberal.
#Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate. This is what all our leaders should be pushing to save lives.

Strange to think that the best ticket for the alt-right is Biden/Harris. Racist white supremacists looking for government to crack down on minorities have a stronger argument for supporting the Democrat ticket this year.
These new conservatives really love cops. If so Kamala is a stronger law and order candidate than Trump. Trump's been much better on criminal justice reform. The best vote to crack down on minorities is Biden/Harris.
They're lucky Biden didn't call her, you know the thing.

TBH, "I have a huge stick" is something you'd expect to hear coming out of Biden's mouth...
Biden is a hypocrite and a liar! You two have a lot in common. BUT Americans are not voting for Socialism/ Communism.
Did you know that there are people in this country who believe Kamala Harris wouldn't be able to step in as president (if Biden is elected &amp; can't fulfill his term) bc her parents are immigrants? I know December feels like a decade ago, but, also just in general, you guys...

Suburban housewives exist and in no way did he associate low income housing with black people. White people live in the projects too. Sorry dude, but I think you‚Äôre grasping at straws with this one. Especially considering some of the shit Biden has said and Harris has done.

Love this.   It also reminds me of the constant push by the Right to describe Biden as "senile" are they really so unaware of their guy's faded mental health that they think it's a good idea to bring mental fitness into the forefront of the conversation?
RIDIN with Biden and Harris            BIDEN/HARRIS                    2020
Kamala Harris Is The Best At What She Does!!  So Very happy To See Her As Biden's Running Mate!!  Time To Get To Work!!
I rather elect Barack Obama to a third non-consecutive term than have either Trump or Biden get elected
Trump said a very messed up thing about His daughter and was good friends with Jeffrey Epstein and Joe Biden has touched many females of all ages without consent Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure both of them are Pedophiles #EndThe2PartySystem #VoteThirdParty
Would it really surprise anyone if either Trump or Biden turned out to be pedophiles? Many people in the entertainment industry as well as business and politics have turned out to be Pedophiles so it‚Äôs possible Trump and Biden could be too and there‚Äôs clues to suggest both are
Retweet it If You are not voting for Donald Trump Like if You are not voting for Joe Biden Do BOTH  if You are not voting for either of those douchebags &lt;3
Nothing Trump can say to try to scare Americans, claiming that Biden and Harris are extremists, could be half as scary as the Hell that we have experienced for the past three and a half years and is getting worse by the day.  Nothing begins to compare. Nothing.
Happy Thursday!!! Cool profile pic!! Are you a pirate in this one? Have a great day!! I know I am!!! Biden 2020.
If people don‚Äôt want Trump or Biden then they should vote third party TBH
Fuck Trump and Fuck Biden both of them can go get fucked in the ass at ram ranch by 18 naked cowboys

Skeezy just like your Presidency! Go BIDEN!
Where are the Twitter fact checkers.  This is an outright Lie.  Why has this man been allowed to continue tweeting, well actually his campaign staff?  Suspend Joe Biden's Twitter account
They have the same mentality when Biden makes the occasional gaffe. Trump can barely string a coherent sentence together most of the time, but they fixate on a few stupid things Biden has said.

Agreed but it is funny that Biden picked someone who identified as an Indian-American when they got sworn into congress to try and win the African-American vote.
Joe Biden was hit with one ultimatum that could cost him the election
that bitch K. Harris did call Joe "Dimwit" Biden a racist.  Your a stupid "Never Trumper" you azz.  No wonder I never watch your shows on Fox Business. Your A Damn idiot.
This suburban housewife is riding with Biden!  And Kamala Harris!
I suppose you want four more years of hate, name calling, lying?  Biden/Harris will bring a level of decency that is now nonexistent.  They will reach across the aisle to form workable solutions to our economy, job formation, education and healthcare.  They will not obstruct.
Perhaps because she identifies as an African American.  Perhaps because her views on Biden were he was a racist pervert. #PhonyKamala #PhonyKamalaHarris

I dont often venture into politics, but here goes... anyone else remeber 1984? Biden/Harris = Mondale/Ferraro. That is my political rant for the day.
Biden and Harris. Strange bedfellows indeed.

Pick the Biden - Harris 2020 slogan:
iTrump and Republicans will not be re-elected Joe Biden/ kamala Harris will win in November and we have the Vote for the new Senate and gain more seats in the House of Representatives Vote Blue 2020
Trump looks punch drunk. Of course he always does but I Love that he doing more to get Biden elected than perhaps anyone else. His 'handlers' can't seem to keep him under control I say let's put this mutt to sleep.
I think it was going to be Amy Klobuchar since she helped so much on the night Biden clenched the nomination; however, Biden did well to go with Kamala. Trump knows for whom the bell tolls she is that last nail in his casket.
You can be excited about Biden/Harris. But if you care about criminal justice reform you have to be honest and admit that Trump did more for that cause than Biden and Harris, simply by undoing policy put in place and enforced by Biden and Harris.
That was a long time ago. Things change. Harris called Biden a racist and is now his running late. Who cares?
Congratulations to future Vice President Kamala Harris!!! A true former prosecutor who believes in right and wrong. Our Racist Divisive President Plump Trump and his Trumpetts will see how Biden and Harris will truly fulfill AND JUSTIS FOR ALL

BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
Harris also has a good amount of star power, and that runs the risk of her outshining Biden, particularly if they win.
That said, Harris has significant liabilities. She has one of the most Liberal voting records in the Senate, there's plenty of issues with her time as AG (which Progressives will have issues with), but I think Harris injects energy into Biden's campaign.
Looking at this objectively, I think Harris is an alright pick. Biden severely limited his options by only going for a woman pick (and it reeks of pandering too), but Harris would be a good way to reach out to sections of the Progressive base and is a good public speaker.
There's nothing pragmatic or moderate about Kamala Harris. She's one of the country's most liberal Senators and would be just as bad as a VP as Biden would be President. We can't afford their socialist agenda.
Same with Trump and Pence. I would take Biden/Harris over Trump/Pence mayday.
Just realized with Kamala named Biden‚Äôs VP that Maya Rudolph will make more appearances on SNL
Are we seeing white smoke coming from Biden‚Äôs home in Delaware?

When your chosen line of attack is that Biden is a frail old man who is in decline, it matters when there is video evidence showing that he is neither of those things. Let‚Äôs see Trump ride a bike. Or walk down a small hill.
Galloway is Whitmer .  She backs everything Biden and AOC.  She must be beaten and hear me out, BADLY.

Biden's campaign is dead. It will not matter who he picks.
Thank you for the mention.    Ready for Election Day.        "RIDEN' WITH BIDEN"
He has a lot of information on his website about his platform.  To be fair to Biden, he may not be saying much about his platform, but neither is Trump. Fox News keeps giving him the biggest of softball questions, and he can't say anything specific about his goals.
I read the poll numbers constantly. I know they don‚Äôt mean much but I can fool myself into thinking Mr. Biden will surely win
You vote for Biden and you are anything but Conservatives! #MAGA
Wearing a mask on a bike ride. So flip‚Äôn staged.  Regardless, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Left loons are not voting for Biden anyway, we all know that. They just are not voting for Trump And Biden just happens to be the puppet they have in place. His family should be ashamed of themselves

He should ride a bike so he can lose some of that weight. He is obese, you know. Pro tip- maybe don‚Äôt attack Biden for being frail and locked in the basement when there is video proof that neither claim is true.
I‚Äôll see you next January after Biden‚Äôs inauguration.
Biden will surround himself with the best and brightest. He will have a laundry list of wrongs to right in his first days, then he and his team will have to rebuild America from the ground up. He will need a Democratic Senate and House of Reps. to accomplish this.  Vote blue.

Trump GDP before covid; 2.5% and added millions of manufacturing jobs. Obama\Biden; 1.5% GDP, added $10 Trillion to our debt, and sent millions of manufacturing jobs out of the US
That‚Äôs not true. I vote based off who is better suited. I have concerns for both... far fewer concerns with Biden.
Oh this must be the Russian Bots trying to discredit anyone for Biden.  Too bad, sucker, it won't work this time. We will crawl on our hands &amp; knees thru broken glass, stand in the baking sun, pouring rain, sleet &amp; snow to vote for Biden. Trump will be carried out!
The DNC fucked Bernie again for the worst dem candidate ever in Biden.  They'd rather lose the election with him than win with Bernie.  Its not about us, it's always been about the donors.For the record, I do not believe Joe Biden is a sexual predator.
I can read just fine. Pushing Biden to the left is good.   But we have to win the election first.
You arent Fooling Americans. Usps just endorsed Biden. We will NOT BE CHEATED BY YOUR DOUBLE TALKING BULLSHIT.. The solution is simple... NO MAIL IN VOTING EXCEPT ABSENTEE BALLOTS
But Biden raped Tara Read (hypothetically) and his own VP choice said she believes Tara Reid. Actually raping someone is definitely worse than bragging about past sexual exploits.

So they're pointing out that, 50+ years ago, Joe Biden had some trouble academically but has since found a calling, rallied around his family after tragedies, and succeeded anyway.  I don't think that's really going to hurt him in the general election.
The Blue Wave stands for water over the Dam, 40 years of BIDEN as a public servant with 0 to show for it. TRUMP has done more for all Americans in 4 years than Democrats have done during their history. Blue Wave is a sinking ship with Biden and Harris going down with it. So
So a 44 follower liberal troll that follows 25 times as many people as follow her......which is proof virtually nobody gives a üí©what she thinks....... Actually is under the delusion Biden is sure 40,000 lives would be saved by wearing masks playing golf for the next 3 months. ü§£
Your ‚Äòresponsibility‚Äô, according to Biden, is to waive your ‚Äòrights‚Äô because of the scientists HE believes.
To liberals, Trump shows disrespect to NATO members for insisting they honor their 2% defense commitments. Biden has insinuated that if he wins, they can go back to welching.
That‚Äôs more people than Biden will save by mandating wearing masks playing golf!!!!!
I just think that in the end......the economy is going to be the biggest factor when someone votes. They saw what Biden did for 8 years.....then what Trump did before Covid. When they see during the debates Biden really has no plan beyond platitudes....it flips.
The debate over masks has moved to the presidential race:
Biden/Harris will ‚Äòcreate‚Äô millions of good paying govt union jobs making solar panels and wind turbines. So let‚Äôs see.....millions of oil and natural gas workers will be thrilled with the ‚Äòforced‚Äô career changes. Righhhhhhhht.
Biden/Harris national mask mandate, even outside, is specifically targeted at pressure for mail in voting. Fear. Convincing weak people that there‚Äôs a difference between going to Walmart and a polling station.
Biden‚Äôs ‚Äòexperts‚Äô.......40,000 lives saved by wearing masks playing golf......... Righhhhhhhht.
Why does the GOP fellate Trump?
nah he will lose but biden will die &amp; kamala hates poors so
3500 miles a week EVERY week.......have yet to see a single Biden sign.
I travel 3500 miles a week all over America........ I have YET to see a Biden sign anywhere.

Alternately Biden/Harris played out by Curtis Mayfield. Strong choice.
You apparently aren‚Äôt on Biden‚Äôs panel of ‚Äòexperts‚Äô....
I hope she plays a pivotal role in the Biden administration. There is still so much good she can do and I'm sure he will have a consequential role for her.
Start telling your Bernie Bros about the importance of VOTING FOR BIDEN/HARRIS! Your Followers are planning to vote you or Hawkins/Wallace This isnt how we're going to fix anything! DO SOMETHING FOR THE COUNTRY!
So let me get this straight....... Biden and Harris criticize using Federal officers to protect taxpayer Federal property from being burned...... But...... They‚Äôre both okay with Federal officers enforcing wearing a fucking mask OUTSIDE!!!
I‚Äôll see Biden‚Äôs ‚Äòexperts‚Äô...... and raise him MY ‚Äòexperts‚Äô......
That‚Äôs it...... Proof Biden has lost it.
I'll admit it, I am not entirely pleased with the Biden/Harris nomination. Does that mean I won't vote for them? Hell no! Anything other than Trump, please! #VoteBlue2020
Next week  is speaking at the  Read his message about why  was the right person to join  on the ticket.

exactly. plus the only reason there are so many high profile never trumpers is because biden is just as soft on wall street and is a bigger hawk than trump. i doubt more than 2 or 3% of the true republican base actually votes for biden
The ones that REALLY amuse me are the trolls that say they have an MBA.....then support Biden‚Äôs rolling back Trump‚Äôs tax cuts and imposing regulations. The growth of the last 3 years were 100% the results of the tax cuts.......and they want them back? ü§£ü§£ü§£

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris attacked the character and performance of Pres. Trump in their first appearance as running mates:

You say that like he won‚Äôt just yell ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse‚Äù and talk over or mock Biden
I‚Äôm usually with you Kim, but if there is one thing we know about Trump, he will say what he means. If these are dog whistles, what do we call what Biden said when ‚Äúpoor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids‚Äù? Or ‚Äúunlike the black community...incredibly diverse...‚Äù?
Tucker played a clip of Biden pronouncing it the exact same way he did yesterday......ü§£

im not arguing that its not better than the trump/pence plan (or lack thereof), im saying its not a good plan, and it doesnt solve any of the problems that an actual left-wing policy would solve. ill vote biden but it shouldve been bernie or even warren in the primary instead

I am used to calling you Vice President Biden now let see the hero.
he is the most anti corporate. biden supports citizens united. and the pharmaceutical co‚Äôs. and he consistently does the bidding for predatory credit card companies. i‚Äôm gonna end up voting for biden. i‚Äôm gonna hold my nose when i do it. bernie was by far the best candidate
biden was anti bussing. before bernie was in politics he was marching in the civil rights movement. both voted for the crime bill, bernie was the only one to apologize. the 93% rating from the ACLU speaks for itself. his rating is a perfect 100% in the current congress (116th)
Joe Biden has no say over who he picks. He doesn‚Äôt even know where he is or what year it is.
extremely popular in VT, and saying he is not a champion for civil rights is downright idiotic, especially for someone who seems to be fairly fond of biden. also, do you think the second amendment should just be abolished cause i mean it‚Äôs their for a reason anyway 3/

BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
Harris also has a good amount of star power, and that runs the risk of her outshining Biden, particularly if they win.
That said, Harris has significant liabilities. She has one of the most Liberal voting records in the Senate, there's plenty of issues with her time as AG (which Progressives will have issues with), but I think Harris injects energy into Biden's campaign.
Looking at this objectively, I think Harris is an alright pick. Biden severely limited his options by only going for a woman pick (and it reeks of pandering too), but Harris would be a good way to reach out to sections of the Progressive base and is a good public speaker.
There's nothing pragmatic or moderate about Kamala Harris. She's one of the country's most liberal Senators and would be just as bad as a VP as Biden would be President. We can't afford their socialist agenda.
Really?!? Did Biden change his mind on Harris?
Biden just tried to get the African-American, Native American, &amp; the female vote in one pick. Harris father was Jamaican so may even get that vote. Not sure of her policy but I'm sure its strong left.
Same with Trump and Pence. I would take Biden/Harris over Trump/Pence mayday.

Trump GDP before covid; 2.5% and added millions of manufacturing jobs. Obama\Biden; 1.5% GDP, added $10 Trillion to our debt, and sent millions of manufacturing jobs out of the US
That‚Äôs not true. I vote based off who is better suited. I have concerns for both... far fewer concerns with Biden.
Oh this must be the Russian Bots trying to discredit anyone for Biden.  Too bad, sucker, it won't work this time. We will crawl on our hands &amp; knees thru broken glass, stand in the baking sun, pouring rain, sleet &amp; snow to vote for Biden. Trump will be carried out!
The DNC fucked Bernie again for the worst dem candidate ever in Biden.  They'd rather lose the election with him than win with Bernie.  Its not about us, it's always been about the donors.honestly you can do a lot better with yourself, like idk, go watch a tv show you like or something. i've proved my point though. you liberals would rather argue with someone who will 100% not vote for Biden than try to convince people who are on the fence. have a good night
i don't care if you trust me. I've read the essay and you haven't. That's fine that you think Trump is an existential threat to the US but if you really think that, you should be trying to get other people to support Biden. I'm not gonna do it unless he concedes more.
Joe Biden said the government should crackdown on anarchists and wants to fund the police more. Also while fascism and imperialism have different meanings, Joe Biden is a fascist as well. he has a history of racism and empowered the state through the crime bill
they do text banking or like i said, you can get friends to do it for you or just donate money to him if you're able. the point i'm making here is telling people who already have reasons not to vote for biden to vote for him is a waste of time.
Joe Biden supported the School of Americas which literally funded right wing death squads in south america. that's literally fascism dude.
if you're physically unable to volunteer for Biden's campaign, then you should be spending your time trying to get Biden supporters to go do it.
i literally was out protesting all day from noon until about 6pm but i had to go to work. you're proving my point though. your concern isn't actually about biden getting elected, it's you wanting leftists to do your work for you.

Biden is not a compromise. He literally opposes every position I care about.  but like I said, are you gonna volunteer for Biden or are you just gonna whine at leftists online?
Nope, sorry. Y'all don't get to exploit our labor anymore. Go volunteer for Biden's campaign bc i already canvassed for the only democratic candidate who cares about working class people.

I think you've prolly gathered by now that *I* hope Trump wins.  That being said, I'd rather see Biden win legitimately than to see Pelosi win (without running) on a technicality used as a loophope (by design). That's just slimy.
I know we lean opposite directions on this... But I'd recommend actually going to the polls if you can, regardless of how you vote.  I'd rather see Biden win legitimately than to see Pelosi become President in January because of a designed technicality.

Yep, strategy that many of us employed in this and the last primary. Bernie dragged Hillary left. EWarren and Bernie dragged the entire blue circus left. It a good thing and I support it. However, not supporting the prima donnas who r taking their vote and going home cuz Biden.
Guarantee that the Dems paid for it. This was their plan all along. Have her drop Out, Biden runs chooses her as a VP then if he gets POTUS he will step down she becomes president and Pelosi becomes vice president that‚Äôs been their plan all along. They know he is competent.

Next session, it'll be about reelection and supporting Biden. They'll still be convinced that bravery is a liability and shirk again.
If I were Biden, I would not be happy about this. All Trump needs to do is act marginally acceptable. It is amazing that he stubbornly refuses to do so.

Nope, congress should be talking about how to fix it.  Biden should be telling people what is happening and using it to color Cons for sitting by idly while the Orange-menace runs roughshod over our Constitution.  Then Biden should pivot to positive messages.
correct, biden should also change his vp choice to aoc!
2) I want Biden/Harris to win, obviously. But I reject the notion that criticism and nuanced discussion of policy as it applies specifically to one's own life and the lives of people one cares about shouldn't be allowed if it reflects poorly on the candidates I want to win.

So much racism. Let me translate:   The [white women] will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I [protect them from black and brown people who] invade their neighborhood. Biden would [let the bad dark people invade] with [black man] Corey Booker in charge!
Was Biden my first choice? No. Will I absolutely vote for Biden/Harris so that we stand a chance at removing Trump from office? Yes. We owe it to all the marginalized groups and women who have been oppressed this entire presidency to stand on a united front against injustice.
News-Leader: Election 2020: Here's how to vote by mail in Missouri this fall
If only your dad experienced the same pain that Joe Biden has experienced.  Maybe he‚Äôd be more relatable.
Three things you should think about: 1-It's odd that you're obsessed with Morning Joe 2-Biden knows the 1918 Pandemic didn't happen in 1917, but it seems that you don't. 3-Calling women names won't make you less afraid of them
will you be scrutinizing biden/harris at ALL? or will you just keep hanging around in trump's nutsack?
If you think that Trump's open fascism and kleptocracy isn't worse than a Biden/Harris administration then there is something wrong with you.  These things don't even belong on the same scale, much less are they remotely equivalent.
#ConspiracyTheories  has been kept in basement cause of mental issues, they wanted to keep his image intact to pick a progressive VP that wouldn't win the general. Biden gets elected, 6 months later, he resigns due to health reasons. And ta-da! President Kamala.
A line from a donor speech from last year does not demonstrate any equivalency between the risks and potentials of a Biden presidency compared to the prospect of Trump round 2.
last summer Joe Biden told a private meeting of rich donors that "nothing will dramatically change" if he got elected president so yeah, there's totally equivalency.
How the F do any of you think Biden is approaching even a tenth as bad a choice for president as a re-elected Trump? Yeah the system is fucked but there‚Äôs no equivalency.

Don‚Äôt forget when you vote for Biden you support a pedo AND a cop. Go fuck youself
I don't think he's left of FDR.  Sanders and his supporters have at least made Biden and the DNC give lip service to some progressive causes, which isn't enough, but is slightly better than nothing.

Anyone who thinks Biden wants to take your guns, obviously doesn't realize how far right Biden leans lmao
If you're calling a Biden a racist and democrats, then how the hell are you defending Trump who isn't even trying to hide his racism? That man is blatantly racist as is most of his cabinet, aides, advisors, and that right wing news media he uses as an intelligence agency.
It‚Äôs just a dumb strategy. Never lower expectations going into a debate. Trump should be saying things like ‚ÄúI heard Biden once won a debate with Jesus.‚Äù

Why would Biden and the DNC invite an organization that did nothing but attack our last nominee and our current nominee while peddling conspiracy theories about the DNC screwing their preferred candidate.
Polling is all over the place. I‚Äôm glad Biden is in the lead but 6 points is a little too close for me.  Would much rather see him up by 8 points or so as I think voter suppression efforts by the GOP could easily negate 3-4 points of Biden‚Äôs advantage.
Tell me, if Biden‚Äôs elected (pls god), will you immediately begin criticizing him, pushing to end social security, spending trillions on defense and not the people as the GOP has been doing for 40+ years?

Polls last election had Hillary up by 3 or 4 points which is what she won the popular vote by. Trump is deeply unpopular even compared to then and Biden is liked much more than Hillary and is winning in states like Texas.Things can change as Biden is awful but Trump knows its bad
If Joe Biden were president we would have a united plan against the pandemic. There would be a mandated mask order. If we really want this pandemic to end wear an effing mask! The GOP needs to step aside and let the smart people lead.

Bernie had money from actual passionate voters. Biden gets corporate pac money.  Biden didn't even campaign in some states but won off of name recognition because half the country sadly doesn't pay attention.
Biden got like 5% of the under 40 vote. AOC could reach them.  But keep licking those boots
Wow... don't even where to begin here.  According to you,  Joe Manchin and AOC are the same since they are both Dems. So I guess Kasich and Trump are both the same since they are both Republicans.  Biden got like 5% of the under 40 vote.  AOC can reach them more than anyone.
Biden struggles with young voters. AOC excels with them. Kasich and Clinton will just be preaching to the choir.  AOC could actually reach New voters.  These are facts.
I'll believe that when Biden starts screeching about conspiracies on Twitter for five hours a day.
They have nothing else other than to tweet disinformation as nothing positive ever has happened from the  administration. Trump &amp; minions  are frantically editing photos of Biden to rile up the uneducated base. They have no other amnitition. üòÇ

I would have loved Joe Biden to have picked Tulsi Gabbard or Nina Turner over any "Third Way" Corporate Zionist DINO like Harris!
And you think Biden will be better?  I get you stated it twice.  My issue was never about the story I‚Äôm particular.  It‚Äôs with the constant pandering to the liberal agenda.

I'm not so sure of that. I don't believe their will be a "Beat Biden at all costs mentality" in 2024, I think ideology will still be a major player like it was in 2016.

Isn‚Äôt Haris Alic is a peach but truth alludes Breitbart.  Biden is right. Trump does coddle terrorists &amp; thugs. Maybe someone at the Breitbart fake factory should read real news on occasion.

3) The problem isn't just that Trump needs even more undecideds to go his way this time, but when asked they lean towards Biden this time. Which is why I've been so confident that the Democrat would win for a while now.
2) 87% of RV today have already decided, compared to 76% this time in 2016 and 83% of LV right before election day. It's not just that Biden has bigger leads than Clinton, but Trump doesn't have the same number of undecideds to pull from to come back. But there's more!

So i woke up this afternoon looked at Twitter and saw Biden has Officially picked Kamala Harris and i turned to my husband and told him, he said "so what does that mean?" I said that means we get watch them completely destroy trump and pence until November! HELL YEAH!

I doubt it Commander Tang already said Biden is disrespecting men everywhere by picking a woman running mate. But we all know how much of a hypocrite trump is so i suppose its still possible
I'm really surprised by how many people are surprised by Biden's VP pick. The minute it was clear he was going to be THE guy, it was obvious she was going to be the VP choice. And, yes, I saw ALLLLLLL of the debates. But it was still so obvious. Well, at least to me anyway. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Donald Trump had to write notes on his hands to remind himself to show sympathy towards the Parkland victims. No matter what you throw at Biden, Trump has always done worse.

Biden has also tried to cut social security many more times than Trump.
Bringing us to climate change, which Biden is slightly better than Trump in terms of mitigating. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs pass/fail, and 43% isn‚Äôt better than 16%, so the result is we all die horrifically as a result of either candidate winning. Lol, awesome!
Yeah, I‚Äôm not a Bernie stan. You can fuck off as well. Not voting for Biden. Patronizing people is a great campaign strategy. Btw, Wall St is ‚Äòthrilled‚Äô with Kamala
Yeah, Biden‚Äôs criticisms of Trump in all those examples is that he didn‚Äôt do ENOUGH. A Biden presidency would do even MORE, and since he‚Äôs a Democrat, everybody will be out to brunch by then.
I wanted  as Secretary of State but I can't wait to see her destroy  the way she destroyed Biden in debate.
Kamala Harris is the most obvious goddamn choice Biden could have made.
Half of Biden‚Äôs ads right now are about Trump being weak on China or weak on Russia. If that doesn‚Äôt terrify you then I don‚Äôt know what planet you live on.
Trump/Pence pulled off one single coup, in Bolivia, the rest has been incompetent bungling in every direction. Obama/Biden took out multiple governments, and a president Biden will take out multiple more. They‚Äôre both evil monsters but Biden can actually get these atrocities done
Yes. We are "Dreaming". Go Biden/Harris!
I am thrilled and so ready to see the healing, and restoration of competence, dignity, compassion and true leadership that they will bring to this country!  Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
Not to mention Biden‚Äôs belligerent language toward Russia and China is about a hundred times more aggressive than Trump‚Äôs and is a hundred times more likely to kick off WWIII.
The difference is that Biden has a much warmer relationship w/ the CIA and Pentagon, and when he tries a coup in Venezuela and Iran, not only will it be successful, the public will overwhelmingly support it because he‚Äôs not Trump.
Biden basically built the mass incarceration system and militarized police apparatus that Trump is now taking advantage of. He‚Äôll keep doing all that stuff, just with a Democratic sheen so all the liberals will shut up about it.
Biden wants to push for war in like ten other countries and accuses Trump of being weak. He would increase deadly sanctions on poor people around the world.
True, but there‚Äôs a possibility that Biden would get even more people killed than Trump. He‚Äôs mostly attacking the president for not being hawkish enough on foreign policy. These equations are not all cut-and-dry.
Hey look, an actual policy pitch! Maybe if Biden supporters would come at us like this rather than implying we‚Äôre fascist sympathizers you could win some votes!
I noticed that the national evening New was giddy that Kamala Harris was picked to be Biden‚Äôs vp. #VPHarris

We should acknowledge that, the fact that Biden is contemplating a running mate who is a woman of color isn‚Äôt just about this moment in time, or energizing the base, it‚Äôs about the fact that women of color have acquired the level of experience to be a credible Vice President.
BIDEN/POKEY 2020: FOR GREATER FUN!!!
We have two, and only two, possibilities: four years of a Trump unbound, not limited by the need for approval via reelection, or Biden.  I get being disappointed, I get being unhappy. I don't get sitting this out or acting like they're the same.
Yeah, I voted Clinton last time but to see the party spit in our face again is a little beyond the pale. It‚Äôd be one thing if Biden came left on any meaning policy position but he hasn‚Äôt.
The reason why I say this is that the VP nominee usually speaks the day before or during the day of the nomination acceptance speech. Warren speaks day before and Harris speaks the day Biden does.
I‚Äôve noticed a lot of fear mongering coming from supposedly Biden voters! Several have blocked me because I question their motive! I don‚Äôt mean to affend but don‚Äôt like people trying to scare with BS!
If he's not voting for Trump,  then he can complain.  Remember,  not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden
Eh, I don't think the president should have dementia. I do think anyone with dementia should have access to free healthcare though,  which is something Biden said he would veto. You should redirect your anger to the people that got us here.

I will vote for Biden if he picks Satan.  I don‚Äôt care.  I‚Äôll vote for a rock before I vote for Trump.
He reads the prompters well &amp; frequently ad libs, keeping his train of thought. He has demonstrated insight, wisdom, discernment, &amp; integrity. Biden has dementia &amp; is being abused by Democrats who are trying to deceive Americans for power.  Riding a bike means nothing in regards
Doctors still can lie &amp; are only humans practicingin the medical field. If that surgeon were honest, he would admit that although nothing showed up then, it can be now. Every time the brain has to have surgical action, brain cells die. Dementia happens. Biden‚Äôs dementia is real.
Simple explanation. Plus he daily proves his mind is sharp. He eAny other belief is a lie.  Biden‚Äôs dementia is real. Any laymen can see it every time he gets behind a microphone. He is being abused, when he should be enjoying life &amp; making memories with his family while he can.
I noticed that Brian never denied Biden‚Äôs dementia. He tried to slam FN, as if they were lying.  A bike ride proves nothing about his cognitive abilities. He is being abused. He should be making good memories with his family, while he can.  Brian needs to learn about dementia.

Biden needs to give up his house to BLM and his salary if elected should go to BLM. Isn't that how this communism shit works?
All the old men 77 years of age like Biden like watching me shower as they did when I was 10 years old. They call themselves as superior doing that to me since I was little. Sex abuse is a routine &amp; they will give some excuse of helping some poor children do online learning etc
I honestly do not care about Democrats anymore at all. Want nothing to do with them now I know they are my deadliest enemies always have been and the only ones who hate me so much for whatever reason &amp; this time they have attacked whole world to win the election for Biden, Kamala
This time whole world is suffering for the whim of this Kamala woman who is Biden's pet &amp; the pet of all those who hate Trump &amp; those like myself who supported him.

I also got this runny nose &amp; nose block going on for almost a month now started since January, they are not letting us breathe - mostly on the right nose. It has gotten worse after June 2020 when Biden polls rose &amp; Trump is getting lower rating. Everything is worst this week.

Try to build Biden as clone of clinton is disgusting.

Me being old is not a big issue. As that Kamala - my step sister is 8 years older than me really and Biden is 77 years old - Nancy Pelosi has no teeth &amp; she is swaying her hips sitting in her chair like a dancing girl. They are the ones pretending to be universal but are they?
It is you who lied &amp; still lie. You are pitiful. Trump did not lie. You will suffer terrible consequences for attacking so many decent good honest people because of one woman's hatred for her step sister. Kamala's hatred. Poor woman. I forgive her &amp; hope God forgives her &amp; Biden.
They hate us so much &amp; we never hurt them in anyway except we are not prostitutes they all are. The worst prostitutes &amp; whores attacking decent folks using dirty reporters dirty Biden dirty Kamala &amp; dirty liberal democrats who throw dirt on everyone they can get trapped some way
Trump's Response When Asked If He Regrets All The Lies He's Told America: None  via   That reporter and those prostitutes &amp; Democrats &amp; Biden &amp; Kamala are the only ones lying. Trump is not lying. I am not lying. We are all the ones who are victimized.
Biden is the 'presumptive' democrat nominee not even the real one. Everything is so presumptuous &amp; presumed not real. Whole thing is a fraud.
Never succumb to Biden hit the rascal directly on his face &amp; break the nasty arrogant nose of Kamala. Beat them up &amp; make them eat dirt &amp; become rag dolls stomp on them throw their broken bodies in the rubbish heap where they belong with their fake evil gods they try to protect
I will never support Biden no matter what he does. As he is the real liar not me or Trump.
I am sick of the Democrats, sick of Biden, sick of Kamala, sick of these type of reporters S.V. Date - like having a Date going on a Date &amp; so on that is what they are saying - that I am looking for a Date with some man or woman as they change my gender &amp; say any lies to push it
I told my mother about this by phone right after which Nancy Pelosi got very angry with all the Democrats joining to put the impeachment trial that Trump had asked Ukraine for proof about Biden doing some cover up there for his son Hunter. So it is still the same issue going on
They are pushing the same deal over again now - Biden and Kamala - that I am immoral &amp; that I had amorous relationships with younger men, that I had baby with a CIO of Citibank Shankar Iyer. She put a baby carriage in my basement &amp; said it was proof of my adultery &amp; immorality
Jilly? Dougie? Aww, how folksy. C'mon man. Give me a break. Joe Biden and Kamala going to eat Trumps lunch? Nope. Not even close

If this was a Biden flag, could you imagine the uproar? As civil servants, you should be doing something about this instead of allowing is to continue. It‚Äôs disgusting, but somehow not surprising,  Are there no adults left in this state?
So they get rid of honest folks and those with good intelligence &amp; worth - so everyone is either stupid or corrupt - Biden and Kamala - types. That is their goal to form what they call the Mafia mob team that will then allocate jobs study monies everything according to favoritism
They reduce our ability to breathe they reduce supply of oxygen - they use viruses - anything to make those who usually excel in anything they do to lose that ability so that  incompetents  like Biden and corruption criminal actions of dishonest women like Kamala can win
Terrorism, bio terrorism, dark web crimes - list goes on for money making deals by defrauding good folks like me. Lying cheating making us look stupid, doing bad customer service by taking our money delivering bad products - this is Kamala's signature &amp; Biden's policy. Bastards
5 Takeaways From Kamala Harris‚Äôs First Full Day on the Biden Ticket   I want this woman to do her best to prosecute POTUS. I really want to see her do it as I know its all hocus pocus lies fraud. I have just seen my  account hacked

If you don't want dark web stealing all that is yours &amp; selling  deadly illegal drugs, stolen fraudulent identification documents access devices, counterfeit goods, malware   computer hacking tools, firearms, toxic chemicals throughout the world, do not vote for Biden &amp; Kamala.
So you see why technology industry &amp; so many rich folk are supporting Biden &amp; Democrats &amp; Kamala Harris &amp; why everyone is against those like Trump &amp; they make up all these excuses - about attacking some women or calling somebody names or being racist or stupid not smart on virus

Democrats have killed off a lot of people using coronavirus and shut off so many so people like Kamala and Biden can be leaders - the last dregs of society from the shacks &amp; the filthy bad corrupt rich vs honest folks &amp; we need to be protected from their evil effects in our lives
Democrats &amp; Anfifa &amp; Biden and Kamala and those supporting them are sending them after me. I don't want these people near me or around me or associating with me. I am not a democrat so I am not obliged to have to be accompanied by blacks who I consider dangerous &amp; corrupt.
How can we stay safe from their manipulations from wicked Democrats like Biden and Kamala and Obama?
How can we republicans stay away from the blacks like Kamala &amp; Democrats like Biden stalking us &amp; ruining our lives?
I hate filthy rich dirty shack women who got rich by smearing themselves or others ruining good families honest police folks or throwing dirt on good ladies like myself. I want nothing to do with shack women or blacks or Biden or Democrats. They must stop following me around.

Hey all you Biden Harris donors: Thank you. I pledge to crawl naked over broken glass, dodging sniper fire, with a ventilator strapped to my back. I will stand for twenty hours wearing depends in the rain to pull that lever for the Biden Harris ticket!
I was just thinking this today. You‚Äôre either with Biden or you‚Äôre for the orange buffoon, no in between ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It‚Äôs probably already done.  Unless Biden wants to grow some balls and fight back, he will lose.
How long Biden is going to get a free pass by running his campaign from the confines of his basement?  When is he going to actually do some TV interviews where he can get questions about how he would run the country and respond in kind? Aren't we as Americans entitled to know?

#BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN                                                            BIDEN/HARRIS WILL SAVE THE AMERICANS                                         THANK YOU GOD FOR LISTENING
All due to you DJT and the TRUMP VIRUS!  He will outlast you the Impeached President aka ‚ÄúOne &amp; Done‚Äù                #Biden/Harris2020
Both Biden and Harris are throw away candidates. Kinda like Dukakis and whoever his VP pick was.
Not watching. Sure he's just phoning it in to try to steal Biden's thunder.
Great selection!! Biden/Harris Finally hope for our country!!!!!!!
I took it as a signal to US- that she is going to be a true partner, a respected partner, a valued partner and what she has to say really matters to him. Frankly, I am ecstatic to hear it from Biden.
What time is the biden kamala event
Democrats are so radical they will use a Dementia riddled Joe Biden as a RUSE to get Kamala Harris as Presiddnt!  Another ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù person with far leftist values and no Business experience!  It will be an Obama Criminal Administration on STEROIDS! TRUMP 2020!
Biden‚Äôs lead expanded in Florida, Michigan, and PA from their last poll.
Going from a 10 to 6 point lead, while swing states expand leads makes no sense.  Biden wasn‚Äôt up 2 in PA up 10 nationally, now up 4 after being up 6 nationally. Numbers don‚Äôt work like that üòÇ
Biden‚Äôs lead shrunk in their national poll and expanded in states lol. This poll is all over the place.
Come on man!
How do they sell her as a crazed liberal while highlighing how unhappy the crazed liberals are with a Biden-Harris ticket? Is there something I am just not getting?
Illhan Omar looks set to win her primary. Now progressives shift their eyes over to Delaware and Florida. Delaware carries a significant symbolism. Since getting a M4A advocate into Biden‚Äôs old seat given his opposition to it sends a message.
I‚Äôm sorry who gives a shit about Biden and that donkey Harris.  I‚Äôm pissed beyond words the coward liberals that run Athletics in the Big Ten and PAC 12   You gutless worms don‚Äôt tell me the danger when these men bang together with such force they destroy their bodies.  Cowards
Tell me your opinion on Biden‚Äôs VP pick.
Now watch the polls.  Biden made the right choice but the independents afraid of a black woman President will run back to Trump.
Yes, this!  Biden is strong enough to have someone disagree with him.
She also does not fully support many progressive policies or is only partly for them. This means that even though she is a great pick there is so much more work to be done in the campaign as well as if/when Biden/Harris is in office. Don‚Äôt act like this is over...
Get on board, dude. It's Biden/Harris or four more years of Trump.
No. But Biden yes. He trusts science and is not on Putin‚Äôs payroll.
Yay! Biden/Harris all the way.
for today's momentous news of biden picking kamala as VP nominee
Way to go VP Bidenüòä. You and Kamala are a winning teamüíô.#BidenVP
Tomorrow Biden will probably give an interview promising that his VP pick announcement is ‚Äúright around the corner.‚Äù
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate #SmartNews ..... Another Skank Democrat that slept her way to the top and she is NOT BLACK!
It‚Äôs weird to think that the Democratic Party has chosen such a clearly presumptative one-term candidate for POTUS.  Even should Biden win, 2024 will be more analogous to 2016 than 2020.
Biden's hideous plan to make family life in suburbs unbearably miserable
Do you see who is burning our cities?  Biden is a man of faith?  He has funneled money to every member of his family.  His priest denies him communion.  You hate Trump because he did what you could never do.  Your career is over, like Romney, Bush, Clinton.  Congrats!
But Biden is falling apart??
Average male life expectancy in the US is like 77. It‚Äôs not unreasonable to think something could happen to Trump or Biden at their age.
Biden needs to respond to Trump attacking his faith.  Lincoln Project, I‚Äôm sure there are clips.  Do your thing!
The Truth about Biden and his mix/matched dissolving Party!
I will vote for Biden if he picks Whitmer or Warren. I prefer other candidates. But that's okay. It's not my pick to make
Trump has been consistent at 45-46% across every poll recently in the state. Only one showing Biden below 48% since YouGov.
Het,   Biden OWNS that house. Americans OWN the White House. What a grifter you turned out to be.
Oh, and Biden went to church yesterday. The same church he always attends when he is in town.
Joe Biden Says You Need More Than The 2nd Amendment To Fight A Tyrannica...  via    thank you for sharing your vast knowledge with us the American people!
All you can do is make sure you vote, educate those in your in your sphere of influence about the dangers of this president as well as the positive impacts on our country of a Biden presidency, and encourage those people to vote as well.
Those of us supporting Biden will be grabbing the Tums during the debates.  It‚Äôs not like he speaks with clarity.
Wall Street Journal New York Post Fox News all owned by 1 family constant feed back loop support Trump/denigrate Biden. Limbaugh. NYTimes always frames stories as if Biden a devil. The media, CNN too gives  free airtime to Trump. Remember they all said Clinton was near death too
I‚Äôm just not buying it.  How is Biden reaching out to Trump supporters who are wavering.  How is their ground game mobilizing people.  There just isn‚Äôt any enthusiasm for Joe.  That‚Äôs a major concern.
Couldn‚Äôt hope for anything more.  But everything in me feels that Trump will steal it along with Biden blowing it.    The polls are already too close for comfort.
Well, I missed this whole damn thing....I wonder if they saw Biden out riding a bike today, trolling the Fox reporter? Looked fit and trim and healthy.
Anyone else think these comparisons between the physical capabilities of Biden and Trump are super gross? I‚Äôm voting for Biden bc he will be a competent leader, not bc he can walk a ramp or ride a bike. Just stop with the pissing contests.
Biden rides a bike while tRump rides a golf cart with his caddy riding the bumper.
HA! America is LAUGHING At Biden After One Look At How Many People Tuned in to Hear His Master Plan | Red State of Mind Daily
Exactly....beating trump is about Biden‚Äôs views and he‚Äôs smart enough not to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna take your guns!!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna abolish all police!!‚Äù or ‚ÄúTime for a huge tax hike!!‚Äù
Can you please explain ‚Äúthis‚Äù leftist take on America?   What are the top 2 or 3 that you feel will get Trump re-elected and how is Biden‚Äôs position on it too extreme to vote against Trump?
He was asked if his campaign could damage Biden‚Äôs chances. Which is how all campaigns function, you lower your opponents chances by getting votes till you win. They literally picked the bottom of the barrel of criticisms to lodge at Kayne
Trump will defend God from Biden?
