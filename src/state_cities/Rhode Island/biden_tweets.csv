Listen to Biden‚Äôs climate plan: tactic to win Sanders supporters or something more? by Liberation Audio on #SoundCloud
Trump and Biden have an identical draft record. So what does that make Biden?
China working against Trump in reelection campaign, US intelligence report says
Does ANY of Biden's 40-year history of issues with blacks and how HE  refers to them bother YOU? Racial jungle? Illiterate parents? Poor kids just as smart as white kids? His seeking out segregationist against busing? His remarks about Obama? Many others?
Geraldo interviewing Trump is like Gollum interviewing Sauron. Geraldo interviewing Biden would be like Gollum interviewing Gandalf.
Agreed but China needs Biden back.
This is the type of article that tells you Biden's billionaire corporate donors are opposed. Biden, a 50yr corporate employee will not choose her. After all he has maybe 1 more year before his decline becomes impossible to cover up (just compare the past 10 months it's downhill).
I'm voting Biden and am a proud American. üá∫üá≤  Patriots, our enemies want Trump.
Susan Rice has sold her Netflix shares.  Kamala Harris‚Äô merch store has been shutdown.  The Biden campaign really fucking with us now.
Andrew yang was the one and we let him slip. Limited media coverage, less speaking time, and because of that he wasn‚Äôt a household name. Truly a shame we have to pick between Donald, Biden, and I guess yeezus
Next he's going to tell us Biden's had a bunch of failed marriages and bribed a porn star.
Stupid is littering out your car. Stupid is voting for Biden. Throwing a flaming liquid in private property is criminal.
You're not so innocent and you're in no position to demand anything. Run for office if you think your ideas are valid instead of slandering Biden and other Democrats.  There's a positive way to create change and what you've evolved into is not it. You're mean spirited and bitter.
If trump said he was pro oxygen, Biden would be pro suffocation.
Well, they have internal polling, and her ethnicity and gender could win over a lot of progressives, and the record on crime some centrists. They have internal polling. But they won't pull Biden unless he literally can't debate even with Adderal or whatever he takes.
HUGE LIE. OBAMA &amp; BIDEN TOOK THE ECONOMY OUT OF FREEFALL.
Your husband is trash  please come collect him.    via
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a devout catholic save the bullshit
Kamala will be VP pick before Biden drops out end of October. Trump wins was considerable margin, but not landslide. Left blames it in misogyny and bigotry. I hope that I am wrong
Trump can‚Äôt answer simple questions. He slurs, and rambles constantly.  Say they do debate, if Trump‚Äôs not too scared. Let‚Äôs have live fact checkers.  Trump lies CONSTANTLY, and won‚Äôt like being called on it.  He‚Äôd walk away; later he‚Äôd whine, saying he won, and Biden cheated. ü§î
Can‚Äôt wait for the God/Biden fight on Worldstar.
Hasn‚Äôt she said she wasn‚Äôt asked to be vetted by the Biden camp? Why is there such an effort to push her into the VP slot when the Biden campaign doesn‚Äôt seem to be considering her? She still has quite a lot of work to do with FairFight.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden. At this point I have no option. But this was why I was pulling for a younger candidate like Kamala Harris or Cory Booker. We need fresh ideas.
You know you have no shot at that, when you say that it means to disrupt Joe Biden's chances and for your corrupt traitorous friend in Donald Trump to win. You should instead take your meds. #kanyewestisoverparty #KanyeNeedsToTakehisMeds
Regardless of who you want it to be, who will Joe Biden pick as his running mate? #ElectionTwitter
Anybody who understands the true value of democracy knows that bringing criticisms to the feet of political candidates is central to how it all works. To vote for Biden (or anybody) without making critiques is to be complicit in fascism disguised as democratic politics.
And, to all of the people on here who think criticizing Biden and supporting Trump are the same thing, YOU are the problem with our political discourse. Biden will get our votes, but he will also get our critiques. The latter is to help make sure the former is taken seriously.
Killing the filibuster would be shortsighted &amp; counterproductive &amp; would only exacerbate extreme political polarization. GOP must do its part too by abandoning all-out obstructionism.
Joe Biden worked for a bi-racial black identifying man whose father was a Kenyan immigrant - a man who‚Äôs married to the descendant of South Carolina slaves. Biden doesn‚Äôt have to look far to see our diversity; he just chooses not to.
Biden voted for NAFTA and for 50 years let our MFG go to Asia and Mexico.   And you are blaming Trump.   That‚Äôs rich
Confirmed DNC speakers:  - Bernie Sanders - Elizabeth Warren - John Kasich - Kamala Harris  - Hillary Clinton  - Bill Clinton  - Barack Obama - Michelle Obama - Jill Biden
So Another Smoke Screen? Anything To Get The Publics Mind Off How Much Dementia Is Affecting Joe Biden!! Someone Needs To Remove Him From Running For Office!! It Makes America Look Stupid. Is He The Best We Have For President, For God's Sake!!!
I guess we al gotta stan Biden to defeat god now huh
definitely not the thing Biden is about, whatever he might be trying to say!
House, I don't know, but Chip Roy looks like he's the most at-risk right now. I don't buy the bearishness on Kendra Horn, mostly because Biden is *up* in OK-05 and the on-the-ground reports don't match the skepticism.
Ok but look at the charts you posted, Biden‚Äôs lead has been way more consistent. Clinton was riding a post convention bounce. Not saying he can‚Äôt lose this thing but he‚Äôs in a much better position than Hilary was
Fr this is some of the stupidest analysis I've ever seen and is clearly an excuse to not vote for Biden based on whoever he picks.   Stop standing on top of the fence, and grow a spine. Just say you're voting for Trump.
How come you never quite rhe absurdity that comes out of joe Biden‚Äôs  mouth? Asking for a friend!
two have a trump flag and one a biden flag, so yeah
Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden
When Cori Bush won I had hope. If Biden doesn‚Äôt choose Kamala I might have hope again.
Now explain Joe Biden
Biden vs. Trump... pretty big one you're missing there bud
As if Biden was even involved in this Tweet. The whole thing is like a poorly executed CGI
I like how because the reporter was black he asked if he would like a coke test. Oh Biden you idiot. What a candidate on the "left" we have
Biden keeps saying he wants to debate  his bluff and knock on his door with a camera..I‚Äôm here let‚Äôs go?
Hurt God? Impossible  Very clear what Trump meant is that Biden, &amp; more importantly, the extreme-Left for which Biden is a tool, are not good news for people of faith &amp; lawful policies that are in-line with G-D's moral law.  Hard to argue against. Meanwhile Seattle burns Bibles.
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è we can't win with Biden either ya dummy
Definitely possible to hurt the Bible, hurt people's faith, hurt people. Hurting G-D is not possible however.  Will Joe Biden be good for faith, or the faithful? No, because he's a tool of the godless Left.
Sorry, NOPE!  DONALD TRUMP'S DAY SO FAR:  - Thinks Thailand is "Thighland" - Thinks clothes dryers use water - Trump claims Joe Biden will "Hurt God" - That sound you hear is desperation - New York dismantling NRA - Trump Organization is next - Trump is going to prison
No it doesnt BECAUSE ID LITERALLY RATHER VOTE TRUMP THAN BIDEN. Fucking take the W when I decided to vote third party, YOURE WELCOME.
This made me so mad. Whatever your politics are, the fact that the other option is a legitimate psychopath should be enough for people. I‚Äôm so sick of pandering to the mildly sane republicans who *might* vote for Biden.
Can someone clarify something for me, is Joe Biden the Antichrist or not because trump said that Biden will destroy Godü§∑üèΩü§∑üèΩü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
While Biden's eager to leverage a woman to benefit him, neither he nor his team has given any rigorous thought to issues of gender and race in advance of having nominated that woman. Does this come as a surprise from racist sexist Joe Biden? #AnitaHill
Yeah but dude Joe Biden said it...you can‚Äôt make fun of Joe Biden. What are you...a MAGAt?????
TIL driving stick is an incredible, amazing, edgy skill and Joe Biden is actually cool. Thanks guys.
Imagine thinking Joe Biden is a radical leftist and keeping a straight face while you say it.
I regret to inform you that Joe Biden‚Äôs father is not the drift king.
supports Trump, who's in OH talking about "Thighland" &amp; how Biden's going to hurt the Bible, hurt God &amp; that there will be NO MORE WINDOWS! Oh! And a vaccine available on ELECTION DAY!  GOP HAS AGAIN RUINED OUR ECONOMY &amp; DO NOTHING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC  VOTE THEM OUT!
That's not it at all. It's crasser than that. They're banking that Kanye will peel off some black votes and some younger votes from Biden. Progressive protest votes will go to Green Party or other 3rd party
Could Biden be the Anti-Christ?
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a devout catholic
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a devout catholic
Exactly. A moderate. Biden can add Harris to his cabinet if he wants but as VP? Uhhh....
I really hope Biden doesn‚Äôt hurt the Bible. I need that for my job.
Biden needs to pick Val Demings. Single, police officer, rose to Chief of Police of Orlando PD, Congresswoman. That‚Äôs neuter the angle of Biden hates cops and wants your guns. She‚Äôd be a great VP.
joining Peter on today's panel are two paid operatives of the Trump campaign, famous General Michael Flynn's son, and, as always, our dear friend and iconoclast Van Jones.  Today's topic:  why is Joe Biden so unlikeable?
Here is what Obama and Biden did with UNEMPLOYMENT! Now he's going to have to DO IT AGAIN.
THIS is what Obama and Biden did with the stock market! Took the economy out of FREEFALL. Now he has to fix it AGAIN!
Apparently Biden can hurt God, which is a really weird endorsement from  who isn't nearly strong enough to hurt God, because he's a little bitch.
This is what Obama and Biden did. TRUMP HAS RUINED OUR ECONOMY.
TRUMP HAS WRECKED A THRIVING ECONOMY THAT OBAMA AND BIDEN HANDED HIM.  In 240 years the U.S. has NEVER had a 33% DROP IN GDP.  #TrumpVirus  #TrumpDepression
Not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump but you know that Meggie. You‚Äôve always known that. NO ONE IS SURPRISED BY YOU EVER.
Okay so don‚Äôt vote for Biden and somehow someway everyone gonna come together and find a new qualified candidate shits not even realistic
Nbs I‚Äôm tired of hearing that Biden is a pedophile shit cus y‚Äôall wasn‚Äôt backing Bernie at all now pick the lesser of the two evils
Trump has overseen the worst stock drops in US history and the biggest GDP drop in 240 YEARS!   Barack Obama and Joe Biden took the economy out of freefall from GWB Admin and handed you a THRIVING economy which YOU WRECKED!
There are so few differences between Trump and Biden that I literally covered them ALL in that thread so I've summed it up. I'm not voting for Trump, that's ALL YOU GET FROM ME. Dont think you have ANY flexibility to persuade me.
I'm not confirming ANYTHING, because I'm not supporting either so it doesnt even matter, but if you think my vote for Green Party is a vote for trump, you are sorely mistaken in thinking that I'm deciding between green party and biden, rather than green party biden and trump.
If that's an insult I dont care ugggh üôÑ do you think if I wasnt voting for green party I'd vote for Biden? I'm still kinda split on that.
One week without  or  on The Argument and the  is out there letting right wingers‚Äô claims that Antifa are terrorist who would dominate Biden‚Äôs America go unchallenged. Fucking WILD.
If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden regardless of his vp pick you‚Äôre voting for trump
I think the problem might be that you find it incomprehensible that someone would find it pretty amusing that Joe Biden said ‚Äúgod, could my dad drive a car...oof‚Äù.   Sorry I upset you promise ü•∫üëâüëà
Kamala Harris as VP pick, the #SettleForBiden  crowd will vote for her when Biden steps out of the race at the last minute despite all of her glaring issues. When Trump wins, the Left will blame it on racism and sexism. I hope I'm wrong.
I mean all I did was find Joe Biden‚Äôs quote about his dad funny. Is there problem with that?
Wow, Biden has a lot more mojo than I thought. God must be worried.
You know I‚Äôm not sure...could you possibly write a few more sentences explaining a rhetorical device because some people found a Joe Biden quote funny?
Oh no I don‚Äôt believe they need to have faith. I‚Äôm more pissed that he had the audacity to say Biden is not a man of god. Of those 2 I‚Äôm pretty sure I can guess who practices faith
And her father would have endorsed Biden as well.
Excited here for Biden. Excited to not slip into total fascism.
Wow biden is more powerful the god, he will get this virus taken care of in no time! Has my vote
I doubt he'd hold office for more than a year, and that's probably only to minimize the effect of claims his mental health invalidated the election. Maybe Oval Office lunches with foreign dignitaries? I wouldn't want to see 2 am war-room Biden, but suspect that's not the plan.
We‚Äôve seen Joe in church.  I‚Äôve seen Donny tear gas people to hold a bible upside down, in front of a church.  File this under *Things that just come out of my ass*  #Trump #Biden
Please understand that information is all so public at this point that we all have the opportunity to make informed decisions, and many of us still choose to support Biden, because of privilege or propaganda or any number of things.
had a great bit comparing their dementia, likening Trump's narcissism to Bob Dole's pen-- stabilizing him. Meanwhile Biden's consciousness is totally unmoored
Why are you even Remotely worried about KANYE when you have a guy in Biden who‚Äôs not sure if he‚Äôs running for President or Senate
Wait......is Joe Biden the son of Keiichi Tsuchiya?? ??
Biden looks like he is in a lot better shape than the current President. Normalcy vs Chaos is the difference
I dismiss the entire notion of "Obama-era target" as mattering. But she really doesn't offer much except for one thing--being Biden's Biden, which is exactly why I think he is going to pick her. Don't see why he doesn't just name her Secretary of State instead.
I‚Äôm agreeing with every Joe Biden gaffe until November 3rd.  I. Do. Not. Care.
A more legitimate debate than Orange Man Bad Vs Creepy Hiden Biden.
As much as I hate Trump, please don‚Äôt say Biden
There's nothing wrong with Joe Biden.
Everytime he opens his mouth his cognitive ability is severely tested. Not flip-flopping just flopping. #JoesWheelchairExpress #Biden
Awesome article by  üòçHere‚Äôs What Tammy Duckworth, Joe Biden‚Äôs Potential VP Pick, Can Teach the Fashion Industry | Vogue
Biden: because flawed Democracy is better than Fascist Kleptocratic Ideocracy
A sad example of what a Biden presidency will actually look like. An advertisement in nostalgia that hides the changing same.
I also suspect that if Biden had a chance to replace RBG or Thomas, that McConnell would find a new ‚Äúprecedent‚Äù for why that couldn‚Äôt happen.
So not going to the convention hurts biden but not going to the convention helps trump?
Why are they continuously lowering the bar for biden in the debates? At this point if he shows up and doesnt pee himself that will be viewed as a win. Wtf r the trump people thinking. I remember in 00 the gore team was talking about how w out debated ann Richards
Biden has been proactive from the beginning while you and the administration downplayed everything. It wasn‚Äôt until 100k died that you got serious
can we fouces the Dems to have a debt we have the tech to do it like zoom and other platforms. Their has to be a presidential debet we can not vote for president without a debt. Trump will kill Biden in that debt .  #weneedpresidentaildebate
let's make America Great again and get back to a good President.  Vote for Biden and get Trump out.
Sanders over Biden, Warren in 3rd with enough for delegates. So it's not abundantly clear that the Sanders win automatically helps Omar (since Warren's votes have split or leaned Biden since).  But I don't think it'll matter.
Oh yeah, totally. And it's one of the things that has most frustrated me about, say, Biden. He used to be vocal on human rights abroad but has said very, very little since 2016 on the matter. (And yes, I know this just happened so he may still say something but...)
This Biden Economy is horrible!
America is just Biden it‚Äôs time.
Yeah Warren really let me down - thought she could‚Äôve been something special. I definitely get where you‚Äôre coming from, just personally think Trump is a significant danger in ways Biden or anyone else isn‚Äôt. Understand the futility of converting in this environment though lol
What if the Kanye candidacy is meant to introduce enough ambiguity into the race that the Russians can plausibly shift some votes, say, from Biden to Kanye in enough places to re-elect Trump? Because that seems like the play, to me, and all it requires is that he be on ballots.
I tried to watch the Joe Biden car video and puked in my mouth within the first 15 seconds. I could not relate less to his target demographic
That‚Äôs an interesting response, especially because so many people were convinced Bernie would have tanked. I personally think Warren could‚Äôve done very well, but I‚Äôve come around to Biden especially after talking to people I know who are on the fence.
Apply pressure on Biden to force the dichotomy on HIM: either you embrace progressive policies or you get Trump. Flip the script that the center wields.
Serious question: who do you think could have fared better than Biden electorally (that the Democrats would‚Äôve reasonably nominated)?
White House officials: ‚ÄúDonald, with all this chaos in the country, you should get out there and stand with fellow black Americans.  People will love you, and you‚Äôll gain their trust.  And votes!!!‚Äù  Trump: ‚ÄúFuck that shit, where‚Äôs Kanye at?‚Äù  #Trump #Kanye #Biden #USA #America
2006 Joe Biden was against same sex marriage and admantely defending the Defense of Marriage act
Not sure how reading it.  The ‚Äúthat‚Äù which can‚Äôt be let to happen isn‚Äôt Biden winning, but the deportation of refugees. (He‚Äôs more anti-Trump than he is anti-Biden, I believe.)
Majority that I know generally don‚Äôt like Biden - most I‚Äôve seen as far as liking him is thinking he‚Äôs a nice, well intentioned but flawed politician. No one I know has even considered Jorgensen, and would likely be unwilling to, unfortunately.

Trump has path to victory that is 100% constitutional. If Biden wins Az Fl Mi Pa Wi state legislatures can select Trump electors anyway. Check constitution and Gore v Bush.
Massive Biden screw up  He should demand tax returns 4 weeks prior to any debate  And a drug test
I been chilling with my dad's liberal gang for a few weeks. They like my Bernie sign, they were leaning towards warren, they think Biden is much better than Trump and Pete would make great chief of staff, they believe in abolishing police and prisons and that Pelosi is a badass
Biden should release a list of tax auditors and drug testers
Ds have 22 delegations now with 2 tied delegations.  I don‚Äôt see them getting to 25 or 26.. without the kind of electoral shellacking that would carry Biden over the line as well.
"Every race I've run I assume I'm losing. I never assume I'm winning," Biden told donors.  "We're going to keep campaigning as aggressively as possible. We're going to need as many pathways to victory as we're going to get."-

Way off base and all lies.  I am Catholic, former member of a religious community, and I support Biden.  He, unlike you, is a good, honest and caring man.  I do NOT support abortion unless for medical reasons, etc.  Each candidate has a menu of issues.  We have to select the best

I feel like if the pandemic hit two months sooner Bernie would be the nominee and nine months later and Biden would have lost the general. I wonder if Biden appreciates how lucky he is.
Looks like Joe Biden has someone yelling at him and telling him what to say by earpiece.
Biden confidants see final 2  #axiosam
"If Biden wanted to choose an experienced and effective executive as his No. 2, the short list would be filled with capable governors." Guess who the first name is.
One of the many factors destroying the GOP is their utter contempt for black voters. They really think this stunt will pull enough support away from Biden to let Trump ooze back into office. Not to mention the cruelty of egging on a mentally ill Kanye. Horrible.
Why? It‚Äôs almost 2 months before debates have happened in like every election in modern history.  Biden can easily just play the ‚Äúas soon as you release your tax returns, we can debate‚Äù card. He‚Äôs got enough of a cushion and Trump needs debates more than him.
I think Biden is trying, and has mentioned, he would stand, and deal with the unequal,  Criminal Justice Reform.  I think he knows that he needs to step up, with a strong VP, and move a little left, if he wants/respects Bernie Sanders's advice.
NY Times? The same paper that is begging Joe Biden not to debate trump?
Here is Joe Biden condemning violent protests. He also wants to increase police funding. So clearly he is your candidate.
Why don't you see any Biden signs or stickers ? Because he won't be the nominee. You will see an all out blitz after his VP pick takes over.
Had Biden never given himself an Aug 1 or first week of Aug deadline, this literally would be a nonstory (which it still is, media and people are just bored) bc this is on track for a VP announcement right in line with prior ones, 2-4 days before convention kick off.
Excited to share that Joe Biden‚Äôs 2020 VP announcement will be announced during the 2024 primary. ü§£

The greatest propaganda for Biden, as we get closer to November elections, is letting Trump speak for himself. His carelessness, ineptitude and arrogance makes him think that he did a great job while hundreds of thousands of Americans are dying. And the same applies to Bolsonaro.
Wow. Were you finally told that telling people that mail in ballots are bad means that YOUR supporters believe it is, but the ones voting for Biden know that it works?  Your supporters are gullible, and you‚Äôre their cult leader.  I hope they learn the truth before it‚Äôs too late!
Fact checker? Like when Joe Biden said that he graduated college with 3 degrees? Top of his class? Oh and he said that marriage is between a man and a woman only? Or when he said he doesn‚Äôt want his kids growing up in a racial jungle? Yeah, you vote for that guy.
Since you like percentages and tout the death rate of #COVID19 because it‚Äôs just over 1%......  Can we talk about mail in fraud happening in less than 0.5% percent of cases?  Or you just gonna be a stupid little bitch?  #Trump #Biden #coronavirus #Vote #Voting

"I don't plan on voting for either Trump or Biden. But if they are going to wreck the country, it would be good to know that they at least knew what they were doing."
Biden rambled on for 1 minute mentioning elephants and lions. Trump actually puts together coherent thoughts.
BTW she has said she would be willing to travel to third countries because she has more faith in the Cuban government than Trump or Biden taking care of her.

Killing the filibuster would be shortsighted &amp; counterproductive &amp; would only exacerbate extreme political polarization. GOP must do its part too by abandoning all-out obstructionism.
Joe Biden worked for a bi-racial black identifying man whose father was a Kenyan immigrant - a man who‚Äôs married to the descendant of South Carolina slaves. Biden doesn‚Äôt have to look far to see our diversity; he just chooses not to.
Biden voted for NAFTA and for 50 years let our MFG go to Asia and Mexico.   And you are blaming Trump.   That‚Äôs rich
BIDEN ALWAYS A DRUNKEN FOOL CLINTON CARTEL CRIMINALü§°üëøü§°
Confirmed DNC speakers:  - Bernie Sanders - Elizabeth Warren - John Kasich - Kamala Harris  - Hillary Clinton  - Bill Clinton  - Barack Obama - Michelle Obama - Jill Biden
So Another Smoke Screen? Anything To Get The Publics Mind Off How Much Dementia Is Affecting Joe Biden!! Someone Needs To Remove Him From Running For Office!! It Makes America Look Stupid. Is He The Best We Have For President, For God's Sake!!!
WON'T WORK!  Why? Biden will have a black woman for VP.  And the ones NOT chosen WILL BE IN HIS cabinet!!
No chance in hell am I voting for Biden you people that are are blind.
I guess we al gotta stan Biden to defeat god now huh
definitely not the thing Biden is about, whatever he might be trying to say!
House, I don't know, but Chip Roy looks like he's the most at-risk right now. I don't buy the bearishness on Kendra Horn, mostly because Biden is *up* in OK-05 and the on-the-ground reports don't match the skepticism.
Ok but look at the charts you posted, Biden‚Äôs lead has been way more consistent. Clinton was riding a post convention bounce. Not saying he can‚Äôt lose this thing but he‚Äôs in a much better position than Hilary was
Fr this is some of the stupidest analysis I've ever seen and is clearly an excuse to not vote for Biden based on whoever he picks.   Stop standing on top of the fence, and grow a spine. Just say you're voting for Trump.
How come you never quite rhe absurdity that comes out of joe Biden‚Äôs  mouth? Asking for a friend!
two have a trump flag and one a biden flag, so yeah
Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden
When Cori Bush won I had hope. If Biden doesn‚Äôt choose Kamala I might have hope again.
Now explain Joe Biden
Biden vs. Trump... pretty big one you're missing there bud
As if Biden was even involved in this Tweet. The whole thing is like a poorly executed CGI
I like how because the reporter was black he asked if he would like a coke test. Oh Biden you idiot. What a candidate on the "left" we have
Biden keeps saying he wants to debate  his bluff and knock on his door with a camera..I‚Äôm here let‚Äôs go?
Hurt God? Impossible  Very clear what Trump meant is that Biden, &amp; more importantly, the extreme-Left for which Biden is a tool, are not good news for people of faith &amp; lawful policies that are in-line with G-D's moral law.  Hard to argue against. Meanwhile Seattle burns Bibles.
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è we can't win with Biden either ya dummy
Definitely possible to hurt the Bible, hurt people's faith, hurt people. Hurting G-D is not possible however.  Will Joe Biden be good for faith, or the faithful? No, because he's a tool of the godless Left.
Sorry, NOPE!  DONALD TRUMP'S DAY SO FAR:  - Thinks Thailand is "Thighland" - Thinks clothes dryers use water - Trump claims Joe Biden will "Hurt God" - That sound you hear is desperation - New York dismantling NRA - Trump Organization is next - Trump is going to prison
No it doesnt BECAUSE ID LITERALLY RATHER VOTE TRUMP THAN BIDEN. Fucking take the W when I decided to vote third party, YOURE WELCOME.
This made me so mad. Whatever your politics are, the fact that the other option is a legitimate psychopath should be enough for people. I‚Äôm so sick of pandering to the mildly sane republicans who *might* vote for Biden.
Can someone clarify something for me, is Joe Biden the Antichrist or not because trump said that Biden will destroy Godü§∑üèΩü§∑üèΩü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
While Biden's eager to leverage a woman to benefit him, neither he nor his team has given any rigorous thought to issues of gender and race in advance of having nominated that woman. Does this come as a surprise from racist sexist Joe Biden? #AnitaHill
Yeah but dude Joe Biden said it...you can‚Äôt make fun of Joe Biden. What are you...a MAGAt?????
TIL driving stick is an incredible, amazing, edgy skill and Joe Biden is actually cool. Thanks guys.
Imagine thinking Joe Biden is a radical leftist and keeping a straight face while you say it.
I regret to inform you that Joe Biden‚Äôs father is not the drift king.
supports Trump, who's in OH talking about "Thighland" &amp; how Biden's going to hurt the Bible, hurt God &amp; that there will be NO MORE WINDOWS! Oh! And a vaccine available on ELECTION DAY!  GOP HAS AGAIN RUINED OUR ECONOMY &amp; DO NOTHING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC  VOTE THEM OUT!
That's not it at all. It's crasser than that. They're banking that Kanye will peel off some black votes and some younger votes from Biden. Progressive protest votes will go to Green Party or other 3rd party
Could Biden be the Anti-Christ?
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a devout catholic
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a devout catholic
Someone should tall DJT that he's too late with his latest Biden take: Falwell has already killed God. And buried him under a pile of...
Exactly. A moderate. Biden can add Harris to his cabinet if he wants but as VP? Uhhh....
I really hope Biden doesn‚Äôt hurt the Bible. I need that for my job.
Biden needs to pick Val Demings. Single, police officer, rose to Chief of Police of Orlando PD, Congresswoman. That‚Äôs neuter the angle of Biden hates cops and wants your guns. She‚Äôd be a great VP.
Trump has us On Our Knees and grieving for our country‚Äôs current state of chaos and deaths. We need Biden who knows how to grieve and knows personally the ways out of grieves depressions...  Biden a decent man to ‚Äúget us thru‚Äù.
joining Peter on today's panel are two paid operatives of the Trump campaign, famous General Michael Flynn's son, and, as always, our dear friend and iconoclast Van Jones.  Today's topic:  why is Joe Biden so unlikeable?
Here is what Obama and Biden did with UNEMPLOYMENT! Now he's going to have to DO IT AGAIN.
THIS is what Obama and Biden did with the stock market! Took the economy out of FREEFALL. Now he has to fix it AGAIN!
Apparently Biden can hurt God, which is a really weird endorsement from  who isn't nearly strong enough to hurt God, because he's a little bitch.
This is what Obama and Biden did. TRUMP HAS RUINED OUR ECONOMY.
TRUMP HAS WRECKED A THRIVING ECONOMY THAT OBAMA AND BIDEN HANDED HIM.  In 240 years the U.S. has NEVER had a 33% DROP IN GDP.  #TrumpVirus  #TrumpDepression
Not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump but you know that Meggie. You‚Äôve always known that. NO ONE IS SURPRISED BY YOU EVER.
Okay so don‚Äôt vote for Biden and somehow someway everyone gonna come together and find a new qualified candidate shits not even realistic
Nbs I‚Äôm tired of hearing that Biden is a pedophile shit cus y‚Äôall wasn‚Äôt backing Bernie at all now pick the lesser of the two evils
Trump has overseen the worst stock drops in US history and the biggest GDP drop in 240 YEARS!   Barack Obama and Joe Biden took the economy out of freefall from GWB Admin and handed you a THRIVING economy which YOU WRECKED!
There are so few differences between Trump and Biden that I literally covered them ALL in that thread so I've summed it up. I'm not voting for Trump, that's ALL YOU GET FROM ME. Dont think you have ANY flexibility to persuade me.
I'm not confirming ANYTHING, because I'm not supporting either so it doesnt even matter, but if you think my vote for Green Party is a vote for trump, you are sorely mistaken in thinking that I'm deciding between green party and biden, rather than green party biden and trump.
If that's an insult I dont care ugggh üôÑ do you think if I wasnt voting for green party I'd vote for Biden? I'm still kinda split on that.
If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden regardless of his vp pick you‚Äôre voting for trump
I think the problem might be that you find it incomprehensible that someone would find it pretty amusing that Joe Biden said ‚Äúgod, could my dad drive a car...oof‚Äù.   Sorry I upset you promise ü•∫üëâüëà
Kamala Harris as VP pick, the #SettleForBiden  crowd will vote for her when Biden steps out of the race at the last minute despite all of her glaring issues. When Trump wins, the Left will blame it on racism and sexism. I hope I'm wrong.
I mean all I did was find Joe Biden‚Äôs quote about his dad funny. Is there problem with that?
Wow, Biden has a lot more mojo than I thought. God must be worried.
You know I‚Äôm not sure...could you possibly write a few more sentences explaining a rhetorical device because some people found a Joe Biden quote funny?
Oh no I don‚Äôt believe they need to have faith. I‚Äôm more pissed that he had the audacity to say Biden is not a man of god. Of those 2 I‚Äôm pretty sure I can guess who practices faith
And her father would have endorsed Biden as well.
Excited here for Biden. Excited to not slip into total fascism.
I can‚Äôt believe that Biden‚Äôs choice for VP will truly change anyone‚Äôs mind about who they will vote for. Maga people aren‚Äôt going to switch over because of it and Biden people are already locked in
Wow biden is more powerful the god, he will get this virus taken care of in no time! Has my vote
I doubt he'd hold office for more than a year, and that's probably only to minimize the effect of claims his mental health invalidated the election. Maybe Oval Office lunches with foreign dignitaries? I wouldn't want to see 2 am war-room Biden, but suspect that's not the plan.
We‚Äôve seen Joe in church.  I‚Äôve seen Donny tear gas people to hold a bible upside down, in front of a church.  File this under *Things that just come out of my ass*  #Trump #Biden
Please understand that information is all so public at this point that we all have the opportunity to make informed decisions, and many of us still choose to support Biden, because of privilege or propaganda or any number of things.
had a great bit comparing their dementia, likening Trump's narcissism to Bob Dole's pen-- stabilizing him. Meanwhile Biden's consciousness is totally unmoored
Why are you even Remotely worried about KANYE when you have a guy in Biden who‚Äôs not sure if he‚Äôs running for President or Senate
Wait......is Joe Biden the son of Keiichi Tsuchiya?? ??
Biden looks like he is in a lot better shape than the current President. Normalcy vs Chaos is the difference
I dismiss the entire notion of "Obama-era target" as mattering. But she really doesn't offer much except for one thing--being Biden's Biden, which is exactly why I think he is going to pick her. Don't see why he doesn't just name her Secretary of State instead.
I‚Äôm agreeing with every Joe Biden gaffe until November 3rd.  I. Do. Not. Care.
A more legitimate debate than Orange Man Bad Vs Creepy Hiden Biden.
As much as I hate Trump, please don‚Äôt say Biden
Trump ahead of biden fundraising? Makes you ask where it is cominv from. I'm going with RUSSIA.(funneled in of course) NRA. Who else?
There's nothing wrong with Joe Biden.
Everytime he opens his mouth his cognitive ability is severely tested. Not flip-flopping just flopping. #JoesWheelchairExpress #Biden

Biden: because flawed Democracy is better than Fascist Kleptocratic Ideocracy
A sad example of what a Biden presidency will actually look like. An advertisement in nostalgia that hides the changing same.
Biden should withhold debates until you produce your tax returns.  a Quid pro quo, if you will.
this is a pathetic.  Biden is a vile being who should not be running for President.  Biden is the racist.   #BidenIsARacist #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica  #Democrats the far left are the problem, not the solution. #Trump2020
I also suspect that if Biden had a chance to replace RBG or Thomas, that McConnell would find a new ‚Äúprecedent‚Äù for why that couldn‚Äôt happen.
Democrats will clearly do whatever it takes to seize power. On Wednesday Grassley accused Democrats of resorting to dirty tricks in order to derail investigations into Joe and Hunter Biden‚Äôs dealings with Ukraine.¬†"This is the behavior of cowards. And it has to stop,"
We BOTH agree that Biden will WIN! Possitive thinking my friend!üá∫üá∏üíï
I think youth will still vote for Biden no matter who he picks! Harris is sort of like Hillary. Lots of adult DON'T like her. Still thinks better as ATTORNEY GENERAL!:)
Please dont use Joe Biden's name in any of your ridiculous  and nonsensical morning shitshow tweets
Why when I wamt to tweet Joe Biden, Joe Scarborough comes up as 1st?  Just asking!
So not going to the convention hurts biden but not going to the convention helps trump?
Why are they continuously lowering the bar for biden in the debates? At this point if he shows up and doesnt pee himself that will be viewed as a win. Wtf r the trump people thinking. I remember in 00 the gore team was talking about how w out debated ann Richards
Awe, somebody is afraid trump will show how STUPID he is! BIDEN will walk all over him! Trump will make a fool of himself. AGAIN!
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED? I WAS SO UPSET THAT BIDEN STUTTERED ETC.   BETTER FIX THIS AND DISCLOSE WHAT HAPPENED!   Unacceptable!
Biden has been proactive from the beginning while you and the administration downplayed everything. It wasn‚Äôt until 100k died that you got serious
can we fouces the Dems to have a debt we have the tech to do it like zoom and other platforms. Their has to be a presidential debet we can not vote for president without a debt. Trump will kill Biden in that debt .  #weneedpresidentaildebate
let's make America Great again and get back to a good President.  Vote for Biden and get Trump out.
Sanders over Biden, Warren in 3rd with enough for delegates. So it's not abundantly clear that the Sanders win automatically helps Omar (since Warren's votes have split or leaned Biden since).  But I don't think it'll matter.
Oh yeah, totally. And it's one of the things that has most frustrated me about, say, Biden. He used to be vocal on human rights abroad but has said very, very little since 2016 on the matter. (And yes, I know this just happened so he may still say something but...)
This Biden Economy is horrible!
America is just Biden it‚Äôs time.
Yeah Warren really let me down - thought she could‚Äôve been something special. I definitely get where you‚Äôre coming from, just personally think Trump is a significant danger in ways Biden or anyone else isn‚Äôt. Understand the futility of converting in this environment though lol
What if the Kanye candidacy is meant to introduce enough ambiguity into the race that the Russians can plausibly shift some votes, say, from Biden to Kanye in enough places to re-elect Trump? Because that seems like the play, to me, and all it requires is that he be on ballots.
I tried to watch the Joe Biden car video and puked in my mouth within the first 15 seconds. I could not relate less to his target demographic
That‚Äôs an interesting response, especially because so many people were convinced Bernie would have tanked. I personally think Warren could‚Äôve done very well, but I‚Äôve come around to Biden especially after talking to people I know who are on the fence.
Apply pressure on Biden to force the dichotomy on HIM: either you embrace progressive policies or you get Trump. Flip the script that the center wields.
Serious question: who do you think could have fared better than Biden electorally (that the Democrats would‚Äôve reasonably nominated)?
White House officials: ‚ÄúDonald, with all this chaos in the country, you should get out there and stand with fellow black Americans.  People will love you, and you‚Äôll gain their trust.  And votes!!!‚Äù  Trump: ‚ÄúFuck that shit, where‚Äôs Kanye at?‚Äù  #Trump #Kanye #Biden #USA #America
2006 Joe Biden was against same sex marriage and admantely defending the Defense of Marriage act
Not sure how reading it.  The ‚Äúthat‚Äù which can‚Äôt be let to happen isn‚Äôt Biden winning, but the deportation of refugees. (He‚Äôs more anti-Trump than he is anti-Biden, I believe.)
Majority that I know generally don‚Äôt like Biden - most I‚Äôve seen as far as liking him is thinking he‚Äôs a nice, well intentioned but flawed politician. No one I know has even considered Jorgensen, and would likely be unwilling to, unfortunately.

Trump has path to victory that is 100% constitutional. If Biden wins Az Fl Mi Pa Wi state legislatures can select Trump electors anyway. Check constitution and Gore v Bush.
I been chilling with my dad's liberal gang for a few weeks. They like my Bernie sign, they were leaning towards warren, they think Biden is much better than Trump and Pete would make great chief of staff, they believe in abolishing police and prisons and that Pelosi is a badass
Ds have 22 delegations now with 2 tied delegations.  I don‚Äôt see them getting to 25 or 26.. without the kind of electoral shellacking that would carry Biden over the line as well.
"Every race I've run I assume I'm losing. I never assume I'm winning," Biden told donors.  "We're going to keep campaigning as aggressively as possible. We're going to need as many pathways to victory as we're going to get."-

Because your not demanding things like national health care from Biden‚Äôs campaign. You have to movement behind you Bernie! Use it.
Way off base and all lies.  I am Catholic, former member of a religious community, and I support Biden.  He, unlike you, is a good, honest and caring man.  I do NOT support abortion unless for medical reasons, etc.  Each candidate has a menu of issues.  We have to select the best

I feel like if the pandemic hit two months sooner Bernie would be the nominee and nine months later and Biden would have lost the general. I wonder if Biden appreciates how lucky he is.
Looks like Joe Biden has someone yelling at him and telling him what to say by earpiece.
Your fixation on Trump‚Äôs family while turning a blind eye to Biden‚Äôs is amusing but sad.
Biden confidants see final 2  #axiosam
... meanwhile your buddy Biden has his dope addict son working no show jobs in Ukraine and China but that‚Äôs okay too? How about the Iran nuke deal? How about the Ibama DOJ spying on Trump? How about the CCP virus?
I think Biden is possibly the worst choice for potus since Obama.
Unlike President Trump, Joe Biden has spent his career backing trade deals that have killed U.S. jobs and hollowed out American manufacturing.
Given the Burisma-Ukraine-China influence-peddling scandals, Hunter Biden‚Äôs extensive international travel during the Obama-Biden presidency, including at least 5 trips to China, raises serious questions about where else he traveled in the final 2  1/2 years of the Obama admin
"If Biden wanted to choose an experienced and effective executive as his No. 2, the short list would be filled with capable governors." Guess who the first name is.
One of the many factors destroying the GOP is their utter contempt for black voters. They really think this stunt will pull enough support away from Biden to let Trump ooze back into office. Not to mention the cruelty of egging on a mentally ill Kanye. Horrible.
Hope YOU'RE biden's choice for VP! Experience matters! Especially fixing the mess trump has done to our country! üëç
Why? It‚Äôs almost 2 months before debates have happened in like every election in modern history.  Biden can easily just play the ‚Äúas soon as you release your tax returns, we can debate‚Äù card. He‚Äôs got enough of a cushion and Trump needs debates more than him.
I think Biden is trying, and has mentioned, he would stand, and deal with the unequal,  Criminal Justice Reform.  I think he knows that he needs to step up, with a strong VP, and move a little left, if he wants/respects Bernie Sanders's advice.
NY Times? The same paper that is begging Joe Biden not to debate trump?
Here is Joe Biden condemning violent protests. He also wants to increase police funding. So clearly he is your candidate.
Why don't you see any Biden signs or stickers ? Because he won't be the nominee. You will see an all out blitz after his VP pick takes over.
Had Biden never given himself an Aug 1 or first week of Aug deadline, this literally would be a nonstory (which it still is, media and people are just bored) bc this is on track for a VP announcement right in line with prior ones, 2-4 days before convention kick off.
Excited to share that Joe Biden‚Äôs 2020 VP announcement will be announced during the 2024 primary. ü§£
Working hard, most effective at helping downticket Dems, raising money for Biden,   sponsoring significant legislation, connecting with people of all ages. Stop messing around. Kamala Harris best VP candidate.  ,

I will vote for Biden if he picks her but I‚Äôm not sure how people will take a Scientology person
The greatest propaganda for Biden, as we get closer to November elections, is letting Trump speak for himself. His carelessness, ineptitude and arrogance makes him think that he did a great job while hundreds of thousands of Americans are dying. And the same applies to Bolsonaro.
Wow. Were you finally told that telling people that mail in ballots are bad means that YOUR supporters believe it is, but the ones voting for Biden know that it works?  Your supporters are gullible, and you‚Äôre their cult leader.  I hope they learn the truth before it‚Äôs too late!
Biden would have kept the doors open to China early on. Pelosi was inviting people to Chinatown.  and Dr. Fauci said no big deal, masks weren‚Äôt needed and a host of other bullshit statements. Meanwhile the inner cities burn with ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù protests.
Fact checker? Like when Joe Biden said that he graduated college with 3 degrees? Top of his class? Oh and he said that marriage is between a man and a woman only? Or when he said he doesn‚Äôt want his kids growing up in a racial jungle? Yeah, you vote for that guy.
I could put up the same nonsense from Biden, Polosi and others. What‚Äôs your point?
Since you like percentages and tout the death rate of #COVID19 because it‚Äôs just over 1%......  Can we talk about mail in fraud happening in less than 0.5% percent of cases?  Or you just gonna be a stupid little bitch?  #Trump #Biden #coronavirus #Vote #Voting
That should be the test... just a one-second video from the Biden Campaign where Joe comes on, and say the word Yosemite correctly.
why doesn't biden get equal time? Oh forgot msnbc and  helped get him elected
Biden is brain dead.
Let's talk about who is the best pick for running mate for Joe Biden who checks off all the boxes and why it's Kamala Harris.
He stutters.  Says we have less deaths than the world.  Then says he has a great relationship with South Korea, while questioning whether or not they‚Äôre lying about death numbers.  He is a senile old man for fucks sake.  #Trump #Biden #COVID19 #coronavirus

Sounds good to me. Lets get Biden in there
Of course it's fun to see Biden lead Texas and within 5 in South Carolina, but remember:  Ignore the polls. Do the work. Get out the vote. Win.   91 days to go.
Who said Biden wasn‚Äôt doing the debates?! He has agreed to do 3.
Biden is letting Trump sink his own campaign. I think it's a great strategy.  Trump's moronic and tone deaf answers are better than any Biden ad. üòÜ
Yep. SC is on the bubble during a blowout but it's not a state where Biden's gonna put resources.
thanks for making biden sound based, ms romney
It‚Äôs sad to Keep Bashing someone in Biden‚Äôs sate if mind.....he doesn‚Äôt know where he is most of the time ....tough to keep piling on someone like that
Agreed. Biden's strategy of staying out of the way will continue to work. This election is a referendum on Trump--it doesn't matter much who is running against him.
Cmon Jon.. why is the press giving Biden a pass for saying the election should be held on schedule???
What is the "it" in "it never gets better"? America's covid response? It's relationship with its allies? Extreme partisanship and divisiveness?  All of these things (and more) get better under Biden, not Trump.
Yikes! Once again Donnie Dunce you have it wrong. The story is Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate Daddy Dunce, not that he couldn‚Äôt. It argues for a strategy, one I disagree with. Frankly Biden SHOULD debate Daddy Dunce, he‚Äôll kick your daddy‚Äôs ass. Think govt mule...
On November 3, I hope Kamala Harris‚Äô name is followed by Joe Biden‚Äôs on the ballot.

Does ANY of Biden's 40-year history of issues with blacks and how HE  refers to them bother YOU? Racial jungle? Illiterate parents? Poor kids just as smart as white kids? His seeking out segregationist against busing? His remarks about Obama? Many others?
Geraldo interviewing Trump is like Gollum interviewing Sauron. Geraldo interviewing Biden would be like Gollum interviewing Gandalf.
Agreed but China needs Biden back.
This is the type of article that tells you Biden's billionaire corporate donors are opposed. Biden, a 50yr corporate employee will not choose her. After all he has maybe 1 more year before his decline becomes impossible to cover up (just compare the past 10 months it's downhill).
I'm voting Biden and am a proud American. üá∫üá≤  Patriots, our enemies want Trump.
Susan Rice has sold her Netflix shares.  Kamala Harris‚Äô merch store has been shutdown.  The Biden campaign really fucking with us now.
Andrew yang was the one and we let him slip. Limited media coverage, less speaking time, and because of that he wasn‚Äôt a household name. Truly a shame we have to pick between Donald, Biden, and I guess yeezus
Next he's going to tell us Biden's had a bunch of failed marriages and bribed a porn star.
Stupid is littering out your car. Stupid is voting for Biden. Throwing a flaming liquid in private property is criminal.
You're not so innocent and you're in no position to demand anything. Run for office if you think your ideas are valid instead of slandering Biden and other Democrats.  There's a positive way to create change and what you've evolved into is not it. You're mean spirited and bitter.
If trump said he was pro oxygen, Biden would be pro suffocation.
Well, they have internal polling, and her ethnicity and gender could win over a lot of progressives, and the record on crime some centrists. They have internal polling. But they won't pull Biden unless he literally can't debate even with Adderal or whatever he takes.
HUGE LIE. OBAMA &amp; BIDEN TOOK THE ECONOMY OUT OF FREEFALL.

Kamala will be VP pick before Biden drops out end of October. Trump wins was considerable margin, but not landslide. Left blames it in misogyny and bigotry. I hope that I am wrong
Trump can‚Äôt answer simple questions. He slurs, and rambles constantly.  Say they do debate, if Trump‚Äôs not too scared. Let‚Äôs have live fact checkers.  Trump lies CONSTANTLY, and won‚Äôt like being called on it.  He‚Äôd walk away; later he‚Äôd whine, saying he won, and Biden cheated. ü§î
Can‚Äôt wait for the God/Biden fight on Worldstar.
Hasn‚Äôt she said she wasn‚Äôt asked to be vetted by the Biden camp? Why is there such an effort to push her into the VP slot when the Biden campaign doesn‚Äôt seem to be considering her? She still has quite a lot of work to do with FairFight.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden. At this point I have no option. But this was why I was pulling for a younger candidate like Kamala Harris or Cory Booker. We need fresh ideas.
You know you have no shot at that, when you say that it means to disrupt Joe Biden's chances and for your corrupt traitorous friend in Donald Trump to win. You should instead take your meds. #kanyewestisoverparty #KanyeNeedsToTakehisMeds

Anybody who understands the true value of democracy knows that bringing criticisms to the feet of political candidates is central to how it all works. To vote for Biden (or anybody) without making critiques is to be complicit in fascism disguised as democratic politics.
And, to all of the people on here who think criticizing Biden and supporting Trump are the same thing, YOU are the problem with our political discourse. Biden will get our votes, but he will also get our critiques. The latter is to help make sure the former is taken seriously.
Killing the filibuster would be shortsighted &amp; counterproductive &amp; would only exacerbate extreme political polarization. GOP must do its part too by abandoning all-out obstructionism.
Joe Biden worked for a bi-racial black identifying man whose father was a Kenyan immigrant - a man who‚Äôs married to the descendant of South Carolina slaves. Biden doesn‚Äôt have to look far to see our diversity; he just chooses not to.
Biden voted for NAFTA and for 50 years let our MFG go to Asia and Mexico.   And you are blaming Trump.   That‚Äôs rich
Confirmed DNC speakers:  - Bernie Sanders - Elizabeth Warren - John Kasich - Kamala Harris  - Hillary Clinton  - Bill Clinton  - Barack Obama - Michelle Obama - Jill Biden
So Another Smoke Screen? Anything To Get The Publics Mind Off How Much Dementia Is Affecting Joe Biden!! Someone Needs To Remove Him From Running For Office!! It Makes America Look Stupid. Is He The Best We Have For President, For God's Sake!!!
I guess we al gotta stan Biden to defeat god now huh
definitely not the thing Biden is about, whatever he might be trying to say!
House, I don't know, but Chip Roy looks like he's the most at-risk right now. I don't buy the bearishness on Kendra Horn, mostly because Biden is *up* in OK-05 and the on-the-ground reports don't match the skepticism.
Ok but look at the charts you posted, Biden‚Äôs lead has been way more consistent. Clinton was riding a post convention bounce. Not saying he can‚Äôt lose this thing but he‚Äôs in a much better position than Hilary was
Fr this is some of the stupidest analysis I've ever seen and is clearly an excuse to not vote for Biden based on whoever he picks.   Stop standing on top of the fence, and grow a spine. Just say you're voting for Trump.
How come you never quite rhe absurdity that comes out of joe Biden‚Äôs  mouth? Asking for a friend!
two have a trump flag and one a biden flag, so yeah
Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden
When Cori Bush won I had hope. If Biden doesn‚Äôt choose Kamala I might have hope again.
Now explain Joe Biden
Biden vs. Trump... pretty big one you're missing there bud
As if Biden was even involved in this Tweet. The whole thing is like a poorly executed CGI
I like how because the reporter was black he asked if he would like a coke test. Oh Biden you idiot. What a candidate on the "left" we have
Biden keeps saying he wants to debate  his bluff and knock on his door with a camera..I‚Äôm here let‚Äôs go?
Hurt God? Impossible  Very clear what Trump meant is that Biden, &amp; more importantly, the extreme-Left for which Biden is a tool, are not good news for people of faith &amp; lawful policies that are in-line with G-D's moral law.  Hard to argue against. Meanwhile Seattle burns Bibles.
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è we can't win with Biden either ya dummy
Definitely possible to hurt the Bible, hurt people's faith, hurt people. Hurting G-D is not possible however.  Will Joe Biden be good for faith, or the faithful? No, because he's a tool of the godless Left.
Sorry, NOPE!  DONALD TRUMP'S DAY SO FAR:  - Thinks Thailand is "Thighland" - Thinks clothes dryers use water - Trump claims Joe Biden will "Hurt God" - That sound you hear is desperation - New York dismantling NRA - Trump Organization is next - Trump is going to prison
No it doesnt BECAUSE ID LITERALLY RATHER VOTE TRUMP THAN BIDEN. Fucking take the W when I decided to vote third party, YOURE WELCOME.
This made me so mad. Whatever your politics are, the fact that the other option is a legitimate psychopath should be enough for people. I‚Äôm so sick of pandering to the mildly sane republicans who *might* vote for Biden.
Can someone clarify something for me, is Joe Biden the Antichrist or not because trump said that Biden will destroy Godü§∑üèΩü§∑üèΩü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
While Biden's eager to leverage a woman to benefit him, neither he nor his team has given any rigorous thought to issues of gender and race in advance of having nominated that woman. Does this come as a surprise from racist sexist Joe Biden? #AnitaHill
Imagine thinking Joe Biden is a radical leftist and keeping a straight face while you say it.
supports Trump, who's in OH talking about "Thighland" &amp; how Biden's going to hurt the Bible, hurt God &amp; that there will be NO MORE WINDOWS! Oh! And a vaccine available on ELECTION DAY!  GOP HAS AGAIN RUINED OUR ECONOMY &amp; DO NOTHING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC  VOTE THEM OUT!
That's not it at all. It's crasser than that. They're banking that Kanye will peel off some black votes and some younger votes from Biden. Progressive protest votes will go to Green Party or other 3rd party
Could Biden be the Anti-Christ?
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a devout catholic
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a devout catholic
Exactly. A moderate. Biden can add Harris to his cabinet if he wants but as VP? Uhhh....
I really hope Biden doesn‚Äôt hurt the Bible. I need that for my job.
Biden needs to pick Val Demings. Single, police officer, rose to Chief of Police of Orlando PD, Congresswoman. That‚Äôs neuter the angle of Biden hates cops and wants your guns. She‚Äôd be a great VP.
joining Peter on today's panel are two paid operatives of the Trump campaign, famous General Michael Flynn's son, and, as always, our dear friend and iconoclast Van Jones.  Today's topic:  why is Joe Biden so unlikeable?
Here is what Obama and Biden did with UNEMPLOYMENT! Now he's going to have to DO IT AGAIN.
THIS is what Obama and Biden did with the stock market! Took the economy out of FREEFALL. Now he has to fix it AGAIN!
This is what Obama and Biden did. TRUMP HAS RUINED OUR ECONOMY.
TRUMP HAS WRECKED A THRIVING ECONOMY THAT OBAMA AND BIDEN HANDED HIM.  In 240 years the U.S. has NEVER had a 33% DROP IN GDP.  #TrumpVirus  #TrumpDepression
Not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump but you know that Meggie. You‚Äôve always known that. NO ONE IS SURPRISED BY YOU EVER.
Okay so don‚Äôt vote for Biden and somehow someway everyone gonna come together and find a new qualified candidate shits not even realistic
Nbs I‚Äôm tired of hearing that Biden is a pedophile shit cus y‚Äôall wasn‚Äôt backing Bernie at all now pick the lesser of the two evils
Trump has overseen the worst stock drops in US history and the biggest GDP drop in 240 YEARS!   Barack Obama and Joe Biden took the economy out of freefall from GWB Admin and handed you a THRIVING economy which YOU WRECKED!
There are so few differences between Trump and Biden that I literally covered them ALL in that thread so I've summed it up. I'm not voting for Trump, that's ALL YOU GET FROM ME. Dont think you have ANY flexibility to persuade me.
I'm not confirming ANYTHING, because I'm not supporting either so it doesnt even matter, but if you think my vote for Green Party is a vote for trump, you are sorely mistaken in thinking that I'm deciding between green party and biden, rather than green party biden and trump.
If that's an insult I dont care ugggh üôÑ do you think if I wasnt voting for green party I'd vote for Biden? I'm still kinda split on that.
One week without  or  on The Argument and the  is out there letting right wingers‚Äô claims that Antifa are terrorist who would dominate Biden‚Äôs America go unchallenged. Fucking WILD.
If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden regardless of his vp pick you‚Äôre voting for trump
Kamala Harris as VP pick, the #SettleForBiden  crowd will vote for her when Biden steps out of the race at the last minute despite all of her glaring issues. When Trump wins, the Left will blame it on racism and sexism. I hope I'm wrong.
Wow, Biden has a lot more mojo than I thought. God must be worried.
Oh no I don‚Äôt believe they need to have faith. I‚Äôm more pissed that he had the audacity to say Biden is not a man of god. Of those 2 I‚Äôm pretty sure I can guess who practices faith
And her father would have endorsed Biden as well.
Excited here for Biden. Excited to not slip into total fascism.
Wow biden is more powerful the god, he will get this virus taken care of in no time! Has my vote
I doubt he'd hold office for more than a year, and that's probably only to minimize the effect of claims his mental health invalidated the election. Maybe Oval Office lunches with foreign dignitaries? I wouldn't want to see 2 am war-room Biden, but suspect that's not the plan.
We‚Äôve seen Joe in church.  I‚Äôve seen Donny tear gas people to hold a bible upside down, in front of a church.  File this under *Things that just come out of my ass*  #Trump #Biden
Please understand that information is all so public at this point that we all have the opportunity to make informed decisions, and many of us still choose to support Biden, because of privilege or propaganda or any number of things.
Why are you even Remotely worried about KANYE when you have a guy in Biden who‚Äôs not sure if he‚Äôs running for President or Senate
I dismiss the entire notion of "Obama-era target" as mattering. But she really doesn't offer much except for one thing--being Biden's Biden, which is exactly why I think he is going to pick her. Don't see why he doesn't just name her Secretary of State instead.
I‚Äôm agreeing with every Joe Biden gaffe until November 3rd.  I. Do. Not. Care.
A more legitimate debate than Orange Man Bad Vs Creepy Hiden Biden.
As much as I hate Trump, please don‚Äôt say Biden
There's nothing wrong with Joe Biden.
Everytime he opens his mouth his cognitive ability is severely tested. Not flip-flopping just flopping. #JoesWheelchairExpress #Biden

Biden: because flawed Democracy is better than Fascist Kleptocratic Ideocracy
A sad example of what a Biden presidency will actually look like. An advertisement in nostalgia that hides the changing same.
I also suspect that if Biden had a chance to replace RBG or Thomas, that McConnell would find a new ‚Äúprecedent‚Äù for why that couldn‚Äôt happen.
So not going to the convention hurts biden but not going to the convention helps trump?
Why are they continuously lowering the bar for biden in the debates? At this point if he shows up and doesnt pee himself that will be viewed as a win. Wtf r the trump people thinking. I remember in 00 the gore team was talking about how w out debated ann Richards
Biden has been proactive from the beginning while you and the administration downplayed everything. It wasn‚Äôt until 100k died that you got serious
can we fouces the Dems to have a debt we have the tech to do it like zoom and other platforms. Their has to be a presidential debet we can not vote for president without a debt. Trump will kill Biden in that debt .  #weneedpresidentaildebate
let's make America Great again and get back to a good President.  Vote for Biden and get Trump out.
Sanders over Biden, Warren in 3rd with enough for delegates. So it's not abundantly clear that the Sanders win automatically helps Omar (since Warren's votes have split or leaned Biden since).  But I don't think it'll matter.
Oh yeah, totally. And it's one of the things that has most frustrated me about, say, Biden. He used to be vocal on human rights abroad but has said very, very little since 2016 on the matter. (And yes, I know this just happened so he may still say something but...)
This Biden Economy is horrible!
America is just Biden it‚Äôs time.
Yeah Warren really let me down - thought she could‚Äôve been something special. I definitely get where you‚Äôre coming from, just personally think Trump is a significant danger in ways Biden or anyone else isn‚Äôt. Understand the futility of converting in this environment though lol
What if the Kanye candidacy is meant to introduce enough ambiguity into the race that the Russians can plausibly shift some votes, say, from Biden to Kanye in enough places to re-elect Trump? Because that seems like the play, to me, and all it requires is that he be on ballots.
I tried to watch the Joe Biden car video and puked in my mouth within the first 15 seconds. I could not relate less to his target demographic
That‚Äôs an interesting response, especially because so many people were convinced Bernie would have tanked. I personally think Warren could‚Äôve done very well, but I‚Äôve come around to Biden especially after talking to people I know who are on the fence.
Apply pressure on Biden to force the dichotomy on HIM: either you embrace progressive policies or you get Trump. Flip the script that the center wields.
Serious question: who do you think could have fared better than Biden electorally (that the Democrats would‚Äôve reasonably nominated)?
White House officials: ‚ÄúDonald, with all this chaos in the country, you should get out there and stand with fellow black Americans.  People will love you, and you‚Äôll gain their trust.  And votes!!!‚Äù  Trump: ‚ÄúFuck that shit, where‚Äôs Kanye at?‚Äù  #Trump #Kanye #Biden #USA #America
2006 Joe Biden was against same sex marriage and admantely defending the Defense of Marriage act
Majority that I know generally don‚Äôt like Biden - most I‚Äôve seen as far as liking him is thinking he‚Äôs a nice, well intentioned but flawed politician. No one I know has even considered Jorgensen, and would likely be unwilling to, unfortunately.

I mean, Biden wanted to be president, and he was a VP
Trump has path to victory that is 100% constitutional. If Biden wins Az Fl Mi Pa Wi state legislatures can select Trump electors anyway. Check constitution and Gore v Bush.
Massive Biden screw up  He should demand tax returns 4 weeks prior to any debate  And a drug test
I been chilling with my dad's liberal gang for a few weeks. They like my Bernie sign, they were leaning towards warren, they think Biden is much better than Trump and Pete would make great chief of staff, they believe in abolishing police and prisons and that Pelosi is a badass
Biden should release a list of tax auditors and drug testers
Ds have 22 delegations now with 2 tied delegations.  I don‚Äôt see them getting to 25 or 26.. without the kind of electoral shellacking that would carry Biden over the line as well.
"Every race I've run I assume I'm losing. I never assume I'm winning," Biden told donors.  "We're going to keep campaigning as aggressively as possible. We're going to need as many pathways to victory as we're going to get."-
Come one now, it‚Äôs East to pony at least one thing!!!  Here‚Äôs one for ya....  It ends on November 3rd.  #Trump #Biden
Joe Biden‚Äôs actual response: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to sit down, or stand up and debate Donald Trump.‚Äù  This was solid    Well, solid for you because you‚Äôre a lying piece of shit.

Joe Biden Will Accept The Democratic Nomination In Delaware
Feels like this goes without saying, but maybe the non-sociopath party should not talk like this
Joe Biden will no longer travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination - CNNPolitics
On November 3rd  will go away ‚Äúlike things go away‚Äù  #Trump #Biden #USA #America
Because your not demanding things like national health care from Biden‚Äôs campaign. You have to movement behind you Bernie! Use it.

"Why the Hell Would I Take a Test?... Are You a Junkie?" - Joe Biden Lashes Out Black Reporter, Asks if He's a Junkie After He Is Asked if He'll Take Cognitive Test (VIDEO). This is pathetic ‚Å¶
I feel like if the pandemic hit two months sooner Bernie would be the nominee and nine months later and Biden would have lost the general. I wonder if Biden appreciates how lucky he is.
Looks like Joe Biden has someone yelling at him and telling him what to say by earpiece.
"If Biden wanted to choose an experienced and effective executive as his No. 2, the short list would be filled with capable governors." Guess who the first name is.
One of the many factors destroying the GOP is their utter contempt for black voters. They really think this stunt will pull enough support away from Biden to let Trump ooze back into office. Not to mention the cruelty of egging on a mentally ill Kanye. Horrible.
Why? It‚Äôs almost 2 months before debates have happened in like every election in modern history.  Biden can easily just play the ‚Äúas soon as you release your tax returns, we can debate‚Äù card. He‚Äôs got enough of a cushion and Trump needs debates more than him.
I think Biden is trying, and has mentioned, he would stand, and deal with the unequal,  Criminal Justice Reform.  I think he knows that he needs to step up, with a strong VP, and move a little left, if he wants/respects Bernie Sanders's advice.
NY Times? The same paper that is begging Joe Biden not to debate trump?
Here is Joe Biden condemning violent protests. He also wants to increase police funding. So clearly he is your candidate.
Why don't you see any Biden signs or stickers ? Because he won't be the nominee. You will see an all out blitz after his VP pick takes over.
Had Biden never given himself an Aug 1 or first week of Aug deadline, this literally would be a nonstory (which it still is, media and people are just bored) bc this is on track for a VP announcement right in line with prior ones, 2-4 days before convention kick off.
Excited to share that Joe Biden‚Äôs 2020 VP announcement will be announced during the 2024 primary. ü§£
Working hard, most effective at helping downticket Dems, raising money for Biden,   sponsoring significant legislation, connecting with people of all ages. Stop messing around. Kamala Harris best VP candidate.  ,
'Never Trump' Republicans team with progressives to convert the president's religious base
I will vote for Biden if he picks her but I‚Äôm not sure how people will take a Scientology person
The greatest propaganda for Biden, as we get closer to November elections, is letting Trump speak for himself. His carelessness, ineptitude and arrogance makes him think that he did a great job while hundreds of thousands of Americans are dying. And the same applies to Bolsonaro.
Wow. Were you finally told that telling people that mail in ballots are bad means that YOUR supporters believe it is, but the ones voting for Biden know that it works?  Your supporters are gullible, and you‚Äôre their cult leader.  I hope they learn the truth before it‚Äôs too late!
Fact checker? Like when Joe Biden said that he graduated college with 3 degrees? Top of his class? Oh and he said that marriage is between a man and a woman only? Or when he said he doesn‚Äôt want his kids growing up in a racial jungle? Yeah, you vote for that guy.
Since you like percentages and tout the death rate of #COVID19 because it‚Äôs just over 1%......  Can we talk about mail in fraud happening in less than 0.5% percent of cases?  Or you just gonna be a stupid little bitch?  #Trump #Biden #coronavirus #Vote #Voting
Biden is brain dead.
Let's talk about who is the best pick for running mate for Joe Biden who checks off all the boxes and why it's Kamala Harris.
He stutters.  Says we have less deaths than the world.  Then says he has a great relationship with South Korea, while questioning whether or not they‚Äôre lying about death numbers.  He is a senile old man for fucks sake.  #Trump #Biden #COVID19 #coronavirus
The shows only want Republicans or AOC style revolutionaries to represent Democrats  They blacklist anyone rational and then cynically complain that they dont come on  The only time they invited Biden on was to discuss Tara Reede
Biden 2020: My Tweets Will Bore You
Funny thing is I figured Trump wouldn‚Äôt debate. But now Biden is refusing? Smart move. Politically anyway.
Sounds good to me. Lets get Biden in there
Of course it's fun to see Biden lead Texas and within 5 in South Carolina, but remember:  Ignore the polls. Do the work. Get out the vote. Win.   91 days to go.
Who said Biden wasn‚Äôt doing the debates?! He has agreed to do 3.
Biden is letting Trump sink his own campaign. I think it's a great strategy.  Trump's moronic and tone deaf answers are better than any Biden ad. üòÜ
Yep. SC is on the bubble during a blowout but it's not a state where Biden's gonna put resources.
thanks for making biden sound based, ms romney
It‚Äôs sad to Keep Bashing someone in Biden‚Äôs sate if mind.....he doesn‚Äôt know where he is most of the time ....tough to keep piling on someone like that
Agreed. Biden's strategy of staying out of the way will continue to work. This election is a referendum on Trump--it doesn't matter much who is running against him.
Cmon Jon.. why is the press giving Biden a pass for saying the election should be held on schedule???
Why would he allow this interview ?  Must be a scam where he's fooling people into trusting Axios and Swan, who in turn will ruin Biden with some fakery  Just watch
What is the "it" in "it never gets better"? America's covid response? It's relationship with its allies? Extreme partisanship and divisiveness?  All of these things (and more) get better under Biden, not Trump.
On November 3, I hope Kamala Harris‚Äô name is followed by Joe Biden‚Äôs on the ballot.
Kanye would expose Biden much like Charlemagne did.
Karen Bass is my pick for Joe Biden‚Äôs VP WHY? She can cross the aisle, she‚Äôs an organizer, progressive, did not run for Presidency, KB‚Äôs personality traits fits extremely well with Joe Biden she‚Äôs from California! Ms. Bass will solidify the black &amp; brown vote and white women vote
I don't remotely believe Biden  46%. Bullshit.
Just heard she's Biden's running mate.  Watching CBS but nothing....
Today is the one year remembrance of the El Paso shooting.   We lost 23 people that day.  All that these innocent people did was go to shop at a WalMart.  We can do something about this and following the election of Joe Biden  we will!!! #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Yeah, definitely not gung-ho for Biden
Covid is a Code Word for ‚Äú Biden doesn‚Äôt know where he is ‚Äú
I‚Äôm really excited that I‚Äôm going to know who Biden‚Äôs VP pick is before the rest of you because he‚Äôs going to email me directly. I‚Äôll keep you all posted.
sure, and he's not nearly the orator that Obama is, but then Trump can barely complete a sentence without interrupting himself to brag or lie or both.  Biden is perfectly capable of holding his own in a debate.  This is silly.
do they really think that Joe Biden is unable to speak or is this just more of their standard bullshit firehose?  Because we've all seen Joe Biden debating in 2020.  He was fine - not a legend, but totally competent to stand there, parry attacks, and repeat his talking points.
But this is an asinine game.   The game should be: name any public policy goal of the left and tell me how Joe Biden would be worse as President than Donald Trump.
It never ceases to amaze me how career politicians are richer after being in office forever.  St Germain, Biden, Mattiello and your dad.  All richer.  Looks like you are following in a long line of Dems who think the taxpayer owes you wealth.
Quick. Someone make the VP Reveal app, where it just uses your front facing camera to reveal ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs VP Pick- YOU!‚Äù
So is Hillary.  This is how Germany was taken over by Nazis in 1933.  This division works only for Trump. Biden sucks...I'm voting Biden. Get with the program or shush, so the rest of us can deal with the problem.
Yes, I agree. Biden definitely is.

Everyone knows that Joe Biden would be destroyed in any debate with Donald Trump.
Yeah.. a bunch of people who aren‚Äôt going  to vote for him anyway.. will still not vote for Biden.  Paul‚Äôs got it figured out.
Totally agree. Tho could see that happening, or more likely, under Biden admin given the ‚Äúmade in America‚Äù slant of his climate and infrastructure policies (tho ofc a fully ‚Äúamerican‚Äù supply chain is not feasible, and industrial capacity is low even for manufacturing nodes)
When Biden and Trump square off in debate and Trump start touting his intelligence, Joe should immediately ask to share college transcripts at the next showdown.  Just a thought.  The man has questioned Doctors and Scientists.  Let‚Äôs put it on the table.   #Trump #Biden
Check my show today as I discuss the MLB and NBA ratings drop the Democrat strategy of hiding Biden and the chaos in Chi-town and Minneapolis #Chicago #mlb #NBA
I do not expect Joe Biden to have any more of an impact on rampant inequality, Republican criminality, GHG emissions, or bloated national security spending than his D predecessor.   I care who wins but corporate-backed Biden will not tackle structural issues crippling our future.
Oh for fuck sake.. there was no policy explicitly enumerated by Joe Biden.  He said in the summer of 1992, ‚Äúthe President should consider not naming a nominee‚Äù.. and the senate ‚Äúshould consider‚Äù not taking it up.  That‚Äôs not a policy and it‚Äôs not explicit.
Then get your boy Biden to debate then. He‚Äôs hiding in the basement ha ha ha
I agree with  here but have one additional question. What about the Senate? What does picking Harris do to Dems hopes of capturing the Senate and ridding us of the festering boil that is McConnell.

China working against Trump in reelection campaign, US intelligence report says
Does ANY of Biden's 40-year history of issues with blacks and how HE  refers to them bother YOU? Racial jungle? Illiterate parents? Poor kids just as smart as white kids? His seeking out segregationist against busing? His remarks about Obama? Many others?
Hold on and fasten your seat belt! We are in for the most horrific months prior to Nov election with Foreign interference Trump welcomes. Attacking our postal system during a pandemic requiring the safety of mail-in ballots. GOP senators investigating Biden and son using Russia.
Geraldo interviewing Trump is like Gollum interviewing Sauron. Geraldo interviewing Biden would be like Gollum interviewing Gandalf.
Agreed but China needs Biden back.
This is the type of article that tells you Biden's billionaire corporate donors are opposed. Biden, a 50yr corporate employee will not choose her. After all he has maybe 1 more year before his decline becomes impossible to cover up (just compare the past 10 months it's downhill).
I'm voting Biden and am a proud American. üá∫üá≤  Patriots, our enemies want Trump.
Susan Rice has sold her Netflix shares.  Kamala Harris‚Äô merch store has been shutdown.  The Biden campaign really fucking with us now.
Andrew yang was the one and we let him slip. Limited media coverage, less speaking time, and because of that he wasn‚Äôt a household name. Truly a shame we have to pick between Donald, Biden, and I guess yeezus
Dan, Joe Biden was never worthy of the black vote.
Next he's going to tell us Biden's had a bunch of failed marriages and bribed a porn star.
Stupid is littering out your car. Stupid is voting for Biden. Throwing a flaming liquid in private property is criminal.
You're not so innocent and you're in no position to demand anything. Run for office if you think your ideas are valid instead of slandering Biden and other Democrats.  There's a positive way to create change and what you've evolved into is not it. You're mean spirited and bitter.

Only a #Biblicalidiot could project his hate for religion onto Joe Biden  like  does!
Well, they have internal polling, and her ethnicity and gender could win over a lot of progressives, and the record on crime some centrists. They have internal polling. But they won't pull Biden unless he literally can't debate even with Adderal or whatever he takes.

Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a devout catholic save the bullshit
Kamala will be VP pick before Biden drops out end of October. Trump wins was considerable margin, but not landslide. Left blames it in misogyny and bigotry. I hope that I am wrong
Trump can‚Äôt answer simple questions. He slurs, and rambles constantly.  Say they do debate, if Trump‚Äôs not too scared. Let‚Äôs have live fact checkers.  Trump lies CONSTANTLY, and won‚Äôt like being called on it.  He‚Äôd walk away; later he‚Äôd whine, saying he won, and Biden cheated. ü§î
Can‚Äôt wait for the God/Biden fight on Worldstar.
Hasn‚Äôt she said she wasn‚Äôt asked to be vetted by the Biden camp? Why is there such an effort to push her into the VP slot when the Biden campaign doesn‚Äôt seem to be considering her? She still has quite a lot of work to do with FairFight.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden. At this point I have no option. But this was why I was pulling for a younger candidate like Kamala Harris or Cory Booker. We need fresh ideas.
You know you have no shot at that, when you say that it means to disrupt Joe Biden's chances and for your corrupt traitorous friend in Donald Trump to win. You should instead take your meds. #kanyewestisoverparty #KanyeNeedsToTakehisMeds

Joe,  thank you for sending out ridiculous Tweets....the entertainment factor is very highüòÇüòÇüòÇ we all need the comic relief...keep them coming  !!! #Biden is entertaining üòÇ #FridayFunDay  #Trump2020Landslide
Fox News For Biden.
Absolutely no argument. Especially for this election. They will grasp at ANYTHING to make Biden and his running mate seem illegitimate.
Regardless of who you want it to be, who will Joe Biden pick as his running mate? #ElectionTwitter
It‚Äôs funny when Trump‚Äôs base calls Biden a racist. ü§£
Anybody who understands the true value of democracy knows that bringing criticisms to the feet of political candidates is central to how it all works. To vote for Biden (or anybody) without making critiques is to be complicit in fascism disguised as democratic politics.
And, to all of the people on here who think criticizing Biden and supporting Trump are the same thing, YOU are the problem with our political discourse. Biden will get our votes, but he will also get our critiques. The latter is to help make sure the former is taken seriously.
Killing the filibuster would be shortsighted &amp; counterproductive &amp; would only exacerbate extreme political polarization. GOP must do its part too by abandoning all-out obstructionism.
Joe Biden worked for a bi-racial black identifying man whose father was a Kenyan immigrant - a man who‚Äôs married to the descendant of South Carolina slaves. Biden doesn‚Äôt have to look far to see our diversity; he just chooses not to.
Biden voted for NAFTA and for 50 years let our MFG go to Asia and Mexico.   And you are blaming Trump.   That‚Äôs rich
BIDEN ALWAYS A DRUNKEN FOOL CLINTON CARTEL CRIMINALü§°üëøü§°
When it comes to hoaxes, Donald Trump has a perfect losing record.   The hoaxes he perpetrated have been exposed, while those he said were aimed against him turned out not to be hoaxes at all.
Confirmed DNC speakers:  - Bernie Sanders - Elizabeth Warren - John Kasich - Kamala Harris  - Hillary Clinton  - Bill Clinton  - Barack Obama - Michelle Obama - Jill Biden
So Another Smoke Screen? Anything To Get The Publics Mind Off How Much Dementia Is Affecting Joe Biden!! Someone Needs To Remove Him From Running For Office!! It Makes America Look Stupid. Is He The Best We Have For President, For God's Sake!!!
WON'T WORK!  Why? Biden will have a black woman for VP.  And the ones NOT chosen WILL BE IN HIS cabinet!!
No chance in hell am I voting for Biden you people that are are blind.
I guess we al gotta stan Biden to defeat god now huh
definitely not the thing Biden is about, whatever he might be trying to say!
House, I don't know, but Chip Roy looks like he's the most at-risk right now. I don't buy the bearishness on Kendra Horn, mostly because Biden is *up* in OK-05 and the on-the-ground reports don't match the skepticism.
Ok but look at the charts you posted, Biden‚Äôs lead has been way more consistent. Clinton was riding a post convention bounce. Not saying he can‚Äôt lose this thing but he‚Äôs in a much better position than Hilary was
Fr this is some of the stupidest analysis I've ever seen and is clearly an excuse to not vote for Biden based on whoever he picks.   Stop standing on top of the fence, and grow a spine. Just say you're voting for Trump.
The word monolith isn't in Joe's vocabulary...will the real Joe Biden please write your own tweets
How come you never quite rhe absurdity that comes out of joe Biden‚Äôs  mouth? Asking for a friend!
two have a trump flag and one a biden flag, so yeah
Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden
When Cori Bush won I had hope. If Biden doesn‚Äôt choose Kamala I might have hope again.
Now explain Joe Biden
Biden vs. Trump... pretty big one you're missing there bud
As if Biden was even involved in this Tweet. The whole thing is like a poorly executed CGI
I like how because the reporter was black he asked if he would like a coke test. Oh Biden you idiot. What a candidate on the "left" we have
Biden keeps saying he wants to debate  his bluff and knock on his door with a camera..I‚Äôm here let‚Äôs go?
Hurt God? Impossible  Very clear what Trump meant is that Biden, &amp; more importantly, the extreme-Left for which Biden is a tool, are not good news for people of faith &amp; lawful policies that are in-line with G-D's moral law.  Hard to argue against. Meanwhile Seattle burns Bibles.
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è we can't win with Biden either ya dummy
Definitely possible to hurt the Bible, hurt people's faith, hurt people. Hurting G-D is not possible however.  Will Joe Biden be good for faith, or the faithful? No, because he's a tool of the godless Left.
Sorry, NOPE!  DONALD TRUMP'S DAY SO FAR:  - Thinks Thailand is "Thighland" - Thinks clothes dryers use water - Trump claims Joe Biden will "Hurt God" - That sound you hear is desperation - New York dismantling NRA - Trump Organization is next - Trump is going to prison
No it doesnt BECAUSE ID LITERALLY RATHER VOTE TRUMP THAN BIDEN. Fucking take the W when I decided to vote third party, YOURE WELCOME.
This made me so mad. Whatever your politics are, the fact that the other option is a legitimate psychopath should be enough for people. I‚Äôm so sick of pandering to the mildly sane republicans who *might* vote for Biden.
Can someone clarify something for me, is Joe Biden the Antichrist or not because trump said that Biden will destroy Godü§∑üèΩü§∑üèΩü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
While Biden's eager to leverage a woman to benefit him, neither he nor his team has given any rigorous thought to issues of gender and race in advance of having nominated that woman. Does this come as a surprise from racist sexist Joe Biden? #AnitaHill
you are missing the point. You say you don‚Äôt want 4 more years of Trump so the choice is obvious. A write in vote gets trump a vote closer to fulfilling your fear. Biden promised his cabinet will ‚Äòlook like America‚Äô I trust that. VP pick is important he has many great choices.
The only reason it would matter is if Biden picked Trump as his VP.
Yeah but dude Joe Biden said it...you can‚Äôt make fun of Joe Biden. What are you...a MAGAt?????
TIL driving stick is an incredible, amazing, edgy skill and Joe Biden is actually cool. Thanks guys.
Imagine thinking Joe Biden is a radical leftist and keeping a straight face while you say it.
I‚Äôm just saying, we need to have a Trump vs. Biden Thunderdome match for the Presidency in November. I‚Äôll even sing, ‚ÄúWe Don‚Äôt Need Another Hero,‚Äù to sweeten the deal.
I regret to inform you that Joe Biden‚Äôs father is not the drift king.
Biden won‚Äôt hurt God but Trump might hurt Jesus‚Äôs fist.
supports Trump, who's in OH talking about "Thighland" &amp; how Biden's going to hurt the Bible, hurt God &amp; that there will be NO MORE WINDOWS! Oh! And a vaccine available on ELECTION DAY!  GOP HAS AGAIN RUINED OUR ECONOMY &amp; DO NOTHING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC  VOTE THEM OUT!
That's not it at all. It's crasser than that. They're banking that Kanye will peel off some black votes and some younger votes from Biden. Progressive protest votes will go to Green Party or other 3rd party
Could Biden be the Anti-Christ?
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a devout catholic
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a devout catholic
Someone should tall DJT that he's too late with his latest Biden take: Falwell has already killed God. And buried him under a pile of...
Exactly. A moderate. Biden can add Harris to his cabinet if he wants but as VP? Uhhh....
I really hope Biden doesn‚Äôt hurt the Bible. I need that for my job.
Biden needs to pick Val Demings. Single, police officer, rose to Chief of Police of Orlando PD, Congresswoman. That‚Äôs neuter the angle of Biden hates cops and wants your guns. She‚Äôd be a great VP.
Trump has us On Our Knees and grieving for our country‚Äôs current state of chaos and deaths. We need Biden who knows how to grieve and knows personally the ways out of grieves depressions...  Biden a decent man to ‚Äúget us thru‚Äù.
joining Peter on today's panel are two paid operatives of the Trump campaign, famous General Michael Flynn's son, and, as always, our dear friend and iconoclast Van Jones.  Today's topic:  why is Joe Biden so unlikeable?
Here is what Obama and Biden did with UNEMPLOYMENT! Now he's going to have to DO IT AGAIN.
THIS is what Obama and Biden did with the stock market! Took the economy out of FREEFALL. Now he has to fix it AGAIN!
Apparently Biden can hurt God, which is a really weird endorsement from  who isn't nearly strong enough to hurt God, because he's a little bitch.
This is what Obama and Biden did. TRUMP HAS RUINED OUR ECONOMY.
TRUMP HAS WRECKED A THRIVING ECONOMY THAT OBAMA AND BIDEN HANDED HIM.  In 240 years the U.S. has NEVER had a 33% DROP IN GDP.  #TrumpVirus  #TrumpDepression
Not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump but you know that Meggie. You‚Äôve always known that. NO ONE IS SURPRISED BY YOU EVER.
Okay so don‚Äôt vote for Biden and somehow someway everyone gonna come together and find a new qualified candidate shits not even realistic
Nbs I‚Äôm tired of hearing that Biden is a pedophile shit cus y‚Äôall wasn‚Äôt backing Bernie at all now pick the lesser of the two evils
Trump has overseen the worst stock drops in US history and the biggest GDP drop in 240 YEARS!   Barack Obama and Joe Biden took the economy out of freefall from GWB Admin and handed you a THRIVING economy which YOU WRECKED!
This coming from a lifelong lib. A conservative could possibly not vote for Trump...but would never vote for what Biden and the rest of the socialists are promising.
There are so few differences between Trump and Biden that I literally covered them ALL in that thread so I've summed it up. I'm not voting for Trump, that's ALL YOU GET FROM ME. Dont think you have ANY flexibility to persuade me.
I'm not confirming ANYTHING, because I'm not supporting either so it doesnt even matter, but if you think my vote for Green Party is a vote for trump, you are sorely mistaken in thinking that I'm deciding between green party and biden, rather than green party biden and trump.
If that's an insult I dont care ugggh üôÑ do you think if I wasnt voting for green party I'd vote for Biden? I'm still kinda split on that.
One week without  or  on The Argument and the  is out there letting right wingers‚Äô claims that Antifa are terrorist who would dominate Biden‚Äôs America go unchallenged. Fucking WILD.
If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden regardless of his vp pick you‚Äôre voting for trump
I think the problem might be that you find it incomprehensible that someone would find it pretty amusing that Joe Biden said ‚Äúgod, could my dad drive a car...oof‚Äù.   Sorry I upset you promise ü•∫üëâüëà
Kamala Harris as VP pick, the #SettleForBiden  crowd will vote for her when Biden steps out of the race at the last minute despite all of her glaring issues. When Trump wins, the Left will blame it on racism and sexism. I hope I'm wrong.
I mean all I did was find Joe Biden‚Äôs quote about his dad funny. Is there problem with that?
Wow, Biden has a lot more mojo than I thought. God must be worried.
You know I‚Äôm not sure...could you possibly write a few more sentences explaining a rhetorical device because some people found a Joe Biden quote funny?
Oh no I don‚Äôt believe they need to have faith. I‚Äôm more pissed that he had the audacity to say Biden is not a man of god. Of those 2 I‚Äôm pretty sure I can guess who practices faith
And her father would have endorsed Biden as well.
Excited here for Biden. Excited to not slip into total fascism.
I can‚Äôt believe that Biden‚Äôs choice for VP will truly change anyone‚Äôs mind about who they will vote for. Maga people aren‚Äôt going to switch over because of it and Biden people are already locked in
Wow biden is more powerful the god, he will get this virus taken care of in no time! Has my vote
I doubt he'd hold office for more than a year, and that's probably only to minimize the effect of claims his mental health invalidated the election. Maybe Oval Office lunches with foreign dignitaries? I wouldn't want to see 2 am war-room Biden, but suspect that's not the plan.
We‚Äôve seen Joe in church.  I‚Äôve seen Donny tear gas people to hold a bible upside down, in front of a church.  File this under *Things that just come out of my ass*  #Trump #Biden
Please understand that information is all so public at this point that we all have the opportunity to make informed decisions, and many of us still choose to support Biden, because of privilege or propaganda or any number of things.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
had a great bit comparing their dementia, likening Trump's narcissism to Bob Dole's pen-- stabilizing him. Meanwhile Biden's consciousness is totally unmoored
Why are you even Remotely worried about KANYE when you have a guy in Biden who‚Äôs not sure if he‚Äôs running for President or Senate
I don't love Biden, FYI, for many of the reasons you enumerated. He was near the bottom of my list of preferred candidates. But politics is NOT just about the goddamn presidency and it's not a zero-sum game.
OK, red rose dude. Assuming Biden doesn't drop out &amp; you eventually join the rest of us in reality, could you PLEASE stop doing this shit and just focus on places where your energy and enthusiasm won't harm the chances of liberal policies being enacted.
Wait......is Joe Biden the son of Keiichi Tsuchiya?? ??
Biden looks like he is in a lot better shape than the current President. Normalcy vs Chaos is the difference
I dismiss the entire notion of "Obama-era target" as mattering. But she really doesn't offer much except for one thing--being Biden's Biden, which is exactly why I think he is going to pick her. Don't see why he doesn't just name her Secretary of State instead.
I‚Äôm agreeing with every Joe Biden gaffe until November 3rd.  I. Do. Not. Care.
A more legitimate debate than Orange Man Bad Vs Creepy Hiden Biden.
As much as I hate Trump, please don‚Äôt say Biden
Trump ahead of biden fundraising? Makes you ask where it is cominv from. I'm going with RUSSIA.(funneled in of course) NRA. Who else?
There's nothing wrong with Joe Biden.

Biden: because flawed Democracy is better than Fascist Kleptocratic Ideocracy
A sad example of what a Biden presidency will actually look like. An advertisement in nostalgia that hides the changing same.
Biden should withhold debates until you produce your tax returns.  a Quid pro quo, if you will.
this is a pathetic.  Biden is a vile being who should not be running for President.  Biden is the racist.   #BidenIsARacist #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica  #Democrats the far left are the problem, not the solution. #Trump2020
I also suspect that if Biden had a chance to replace RBG or Thomas, that McConnell would find a new ‚Äúprecedent‚Äù for why that couldn‚Äôt happen.
We BOTH agree that Biden will WIN! Possitive thinking my friend!üá∫üá∏üíï
I think youth will still vote for Biden no matter who he picks! Harris is sort of like Hillary. Lots of adult DON'T like her. Still thinks better as ATTORNEY GENERAL!:)
I'd vote for a rotten turnip before Trump. Joe Biden &gt; rotten turnip. Imma shut my mouth and vote and do what I can to flip the goddamn Senate.
Please dont use Joe Biden's name in any of your ridiculous  and nonsensical morning shitshow tweets
Why when I wamt to tweet Joe Biden, Joe Scarborough comes up as 1st?  Just asking!
So not going to the convention hurts biden but not going to the convention helps trump?
Why are they continuously lowering the bar for biden in the debates? At this point if he shows up and doesnt pee himself that will be viewed as a win. Wtf r the trump people thinking. I remember in 00 the gore team was talking about how w out debated ann Richards
Awe, somebody is afraid trump will show how STUPID he is! BIDEN will walk all over him! Trump will make a fool of himself. AGAIN!
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED? I WAS SO UPSET THAT BIDEN STUTTERED ETC.   BETTER FIX THIS AND DISCLOSE WHAT HAPPENED!   Unacceptable!
Biden has been proactive from the beginning while you and the administration downplayed everything. It wasn‚Äôt until 100k died that you got serious
can we fouces the Dems to have a debt we have the tech to do it like zoom and other platforms. Their has to be a presidential debet we can not vote for president without a debt. Trump will kill Biden in that debt .  #weneedpresidentaildebate
let's make America Great again and get back to a good President.  Vote for Biden and get Trump out.
Sanders over Biden, Warren in 3rd with enough for delegates. So it's not abundantly clear that the Sanders win automatically helps Omar (since Warren's votes have split or leaned Biden since).  But I don't think it'll matter.
Oh yeah, totally. And it's one of the things that has most frustrated me about, say, Biden. He used to be vocal on human rights abroad but has said very, very little since 2016 on the matter. (And yes, I know this just happened so he may still say something but...)
This Biden Economy is horrible!
America is just Biden it‚Äôs time.
Yeah Warren really let me down - thought she could‚Äôve been something special. I definitely get where you‚Äôre coming from, just personally think Trump is a significant danger in ways Biden or anyone else isn‚Äôt. Understand the futility of converting in this environment though lol
What if the Kanye candidacy is meant to introduce enough ambiguity into the race that the Russians can plausibly shift some votes, say, from Biden to Kanye in enough places to re-elect Trump? Because that seems like the play, to me, and all it requires is that he be on ballots.
I don‚Äôt care if Joe Biden stays in a bunker until the election; I‚Äôll vote for him.
I tried to watch the Joe Biden car video and puked in my mouth within the first 15 seconds. I could not relate less to his target demographic
That‚Äôs an interesting response, especially because so many people were convinced Bernie would have tanked. I personally think Warren could‚Äôve done very well, but I‚Äôve come around to Biden especially after talking to people I know who are on the fence.
Apply pressure on Biden to force the dichotomy on HIM: either you embrace progressive policies or you get Trump. Flip the script that the center wields.
Serious question: who do you think could have fared better than Biden electorally (that the Democrats would‚Äôve reasonably nominated)?
White House officials: ‚ÄúDonald, with all this chaos in the country, you should get out there and stand with fellow black Americans.  People will love you, and you‚Äôll gain their trust.  And votes!!!‚Äù  Trump: ‚ÄúFuck that shit, where‚Äôs Kanye at?‚Äù  #Trump #Kanye #Biden #USA #America
2006 Joe Biden was against same sex marriage and admantely defending the Defense of Marriage act
Not sure how reading it.  The ‚Äúthat‚Äù which can‚Äôt be let to happen isn‚Äôt Biden winning, but the deportation of refugees. (He‚Äôs more anti-Trump than he is anti-Biden, I believe.)
Majority that I know generally don‚Äôt like Biden - most I‚Äôve seen as far as liking him is thinking he‚Äôs a nice, well intentioned but flawed politician. No one I know has even considered Jorgensen, and would likely be unwilling to, unfortunately.

No one wants to watch 4 and a half hours of pretty much "Biden 2020" signs in their face all day.  If they say its anything other than that they're full of crap.
I mean, Biden wanted to be president, and he was a VP
Trump has path to victory that is 100% constitutional. If Biden wins Az Fl Mi Pa Wi state legislatures can select Trump electors anyway. Check constitution and Gore v Bush.
Massive Biden screw up  He should demand tax returns 4 weeks prior to any debate  And a drug test
I been chilling with my dad's liberal gang for a few weeks. They like my Bernie sign, they were leaning towards warren, they think Biden is much better than Trump and Pete would make great chief of staff, they believe in abolishing police and prisons and that Pelosi is a badass
Biden should release a list of tax auditors and drug testers
Ds have 22 delegations now with 2 tied delegations.  I don‚Äôt see them getting to 25 or 26.. without the kind of electoral shellacking that would carry Biden over the line as well.
"Every race I've run I assume I'm losing. I never assume I'm winning," Biden told donors.  "We're going to keep campaigning as aggressively as possible. We're going to need as many pathways to victory as we're going to get."-

Way off base and all lies.  I am Catholic, former member of a religious community, and I support Biden.  He, unlike you, is a good, honest and caring man.  I do NOT support abortion unless for medical reasons, etc.  Each candidate has a menu of issues.  We have to select the best

I feel like if the pandemic hit two months sooner Bernie would be the nominee and nine months later and Biden would have lost the general. I wonder if Biden appreciates how lucky he is.
Looks like Joe Biden has someone yelling at him and telling him what to say by earpiece.
Your fixation on Trump‚Äôs family while turning a blind eye to Biden‚Äôs is amusing but sad.

... meanwhile your buddy Biden has his dope addict son working no show jobs in Ukraine and China but that‚Äôs okay too? How about the Iran nuke deal? How about the Ibama DOJ spying on Trump? How about the CCP virus?
I think Biden is possibly the worst choice for potus since Obama.
"If Biden wanted to choose an experienced and effective executive as his No. 2, the short list would be filled with capable governors." Guess who the first name is.
One of the many factors destroying the GOP is their utter contempt for black voters. They really think this stunt will pull enough support away from Biden to let Trump ooze back into office. Not to mention the cruelty of egging on a mentally ill Kanye. Horrible.
Hope YOU'RE biden's choice for VP! Experience matters! Especially fixing the mess trump has done to our country! üëç
Why? It‚Äôs almost 2 months before debates have happened in like every election in modern history.  Biden can easily just play the ‚Äúas soon as you release your tax returns, we can debate‚Äù card. He‚Äôs got enough of a cushion and Trump needs debates more than him.
I think Biden is trying, and has mentioned, he would stand, and deal with the unequal,  Criminal Justice Reform.  I think he knows that he needs to step up, with a strong VP, and move a little left, if he wants/respects Bernie Sanders's advice.
NY Times? The same paper that is begging Joe Biden not to debate trump?
Here is Joe Biden condemning violent protests. He also wants to increase police funding. So clearly he is your candidate.
Why don't you see any Biden signs or stickers ? Because he won't be the nominee. You will see an all out blitz after his VP pick takes over.
Had Biden never given himself an Aug 1 or first week of Aug deadline, this literally would be a nonstory (which it still is, media and people are just bored) bc this is on track for a VP announcement right in line with prior ones, 2-4 days before convention kick off.
Excited to share that Joe Biden‚Äôs 2020 VP announcement will be announced during the 2024 primary. ü§£
Working hard, most effective at helping downticket Dems, raising money for Biden,   sponsoring significant legislation, connecting with people of all ages. Stop messing around. Kamala Harris best VP candidate.  ,

I will vote for Biden if he picks her but I‚Äôm not sure how people will take a Scientology person
The greatest propaganda for Biden, as we get closer to November elections, is letting Trump speak for himself. His carelessness, ineptitude and arrogance makes him think that he did a great job while hundreds of thousands of Americans are dying. And the same applies to Bolsonaro.
Wow. Were you finally told that telling people that mail in ballots are bad means that YOUR supporters believe it is, but the ones voting for Biden know that it works?  Your supporters are gullible, and you‚Äôre their cult leader.  I hope they learn the truth before it‚Äôs too late!
Biden would have kept the doors open to China early on. Pelosi was inviting people to Chinatown.  and Dr. Fauci said no big deal, masks weren‚Äôt needed and a host of other bullshit statements. Meanwhile the inner cities burn with ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù protests.
Fact checker? Like when Joe Biden said that he graduated college with 3 degrees? Top of his class? Oh and he said that marriage is between a man and a woman only? Or when he said he doesn‚Äôt want his kids growing up in a racial jungle? Yeah, you vote for that guy.
I could put up the same nonsense from Biden, Polosi and others. What‚Äôs your point?
Since you like percentages and tout the death rate of #COVID19 because it‚Äôs just over 1%......  Can we talk about mail in fraud happening in less than 0.5% percent of cases?  Or you just gonna be a stupid little bitch?  #Trump #Biden #coronavirus #Vote #Voting
That should be the test... just a one-second video from the Biden Campaign where Joe comes on, and say the word Yosemite correctly.
why doesn't biden get equal time? Oh forgot msnbc and  helped get him elected
Biden is brain dead.
Let's talk about who is the best pick for running mate for Joe Biden who checks off all the boxes and why it's Kamala Harris.
He stutters.  Says we have less deaths than the world.  Then says he has a great relationship with South Korea, while questioning whether or not they‚Äôre lying about death numbers.  He is a senile old man for fucks sake.  #Trump #Biden #COVID19 #coronavirus
The shows only want Republicans or AOC style revolutionaries to represent Democrats  They blacklist anyone rational and then cynically complain that they dont come on  The only time they invited Biden on was to discuss Tara Reede

Sounds good to me. Lets get Biden in there
Of course it's fun to see Biden lead Texas and within 5 in South Carolina, but remember:  Ignore the polls. Do the work. Get out the vote. Win.   91 days to go.
Who said Biden wasn‚Äôt doing the debates?! He has agreed to do 3.
Biden is letting Trump sink his own campaign. I think it's a great strategy.  Trump's moronic and tone deaf answers are better than any Biden ad. üòÜ
Yep. SC is on the bubble during a blowout but it's not a state where Biden's gonna put resources.
thanks for making biden sound based, ms romney
It‚Äôs sad to Keep Bashing someone in Biden‚Äôs sate if mind.....he doesn‚Äôt know where he is most of the time ....tough to keep piling on someone like that
Agreed. Biden's strategy of staying out of the way will continue to work. This election is a referendum on Trump--it doesn't matter much who is running against him.
Cmon Jon.. why is the press giving Biden a pass for saying the election should be held on schedule???
Why would he allow this interview ?  Must be a scam where he's fooling people into trusting Axios and Swan, who in turn will ruin Biden with some fakery  Just watch
What is the "it" in "it never gets better"? America's covid response? It's relationship with its allies? Extreme partisanship and divisiveness?  All of these things (and more) get better under Biden, not Trump.
Yikes! Once again Donnie Dunce you have it wrong. The story is Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate Daddy Dunce, not that he couldn‚Äôt. It argues for a strategy, one I disagree with. Frankly Biden SHOULD debate Daddy Dunce, he‚Äôll kick your daddy‚Äôs ass. Think govt mule...
On November 3, I hope Kamala Harris‚Äô name is followed by Joe Biden‚Äôs on the ballot.

I‚Äôm really excited that I‚Äôm going to know who Biden‚Äôs VP pick is before the rest of you because he‚Äôs going to email me directly. I‚Äôll keep you all posted.
sure, and he's not nearly the orator that Obama is, but then Trump can barely complete a sentence without interrupting himself to brag or lie or both.  Biden is perfectly capable of holding his own in a debate.  This is silly.
do they really think that Joe Biden is unable to speak or is this just more of their standard bullshit firehose?  Because we've all seen Joe Biden debating in 2020.  He was fine - not a legend, but totally competent to stand there, parry attacks, and repeat his talking points.
But this is an asinine game.   The game should be: name any public policy goal of the left and tell me how Joe Biden would be worse as President than Donald Trump.
It never ceases to amaze me how career politicians are richer after being in office forever.  St Germain, Biden, Mattiello and your dad.  All richer.  Looks like you are following in a long line of Dems who think the taxpayer owes you wealth.
Quick. Someone make the VP Reveal app, where it just uses your front facing camera to reveal ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs VP Pick- YOU!‚Äù
So is Hillary.  This is how Germany was taken over by Nazis in 1933.  This division works only for Trump. Biden sucks...I'm voting Biden. Get with the program or shush, so the rest of us can deal with the problem.
Yes, I agree. Biden definitely is.
Wow! Really bad ratings for Trump! Very Strong Disapproval of Trump! Biden leading in approval by far!

Everyone knows that Joe Biden would be destroyed in any debate with Donald Trump.
Yeah.. a bunch of people who aren‚Äôt going  to vote for him anyway.. will still not vote for Biden.  Paul‚Äôs got it figured out.
Totally agree. Tho could see that happening, or more likely, under Biden admin given the ‚Äúmade in America‚Äù slant of his climate and infrastructure policies (tho ofc a fully ‚Äúamerican‚Äù supply chain is not feasible, and industrial capacity is low even for manufacturing nodes)
Biden Increases Edge Over Trump In NPR Battleground Map #TrumpIsAmericasRockBottom
When Biden and Trump square off in debate and Trump start touting his intelligence, Joe should immediately ask to share college transcripts at the next showdown.  Just a thought.  The man has questioned Doctors and Scientists.  Let‚Äôs put it on the table.   #Trump #Biden
And he'll probably win again.  Joe Biden is going to need to speak publicly again eventually
Check my show today as I discuss the MLB and NBA ratings drop the Democrat strategy of hiding Biden and the chaos in Chi-town and Minneapolis #Chicago #mlb #NBA
I do not expect Joe Biden to have any more of an impact on rampant inequality, Republican criminality, GHG emissions, or bloated national security spending than his D predecessor.   I care who wins but corporate-backed Biden will not tackle structural issues crippling our future.
Oh for fuck sake.. there was no policy explicitly enumerated by Joe Biden.  He said in the summer of 1992, ‚Äúthe President should consider not naming a nominee‚Äù.. and the senate ‚Äúshould consider‚Äù not taking it up.  That‚Äôs not a policy and it‚Äôs not explicit.
Then get your boy Biden to debate then. He‚Äôs hiding in the basement ha ha ha
I agree with  here but have one additional question. What about the Senate? What does picking Harris do to Dems hopes of capturing the Senate and ridding us of the festering boil that is McConnell.

I already AM following Cathy graphics.  And I am very proud to do so.  She's a really Wonderful Lady ,. Just like you are.  I'm going to be glad to vote for Mr. Biden in November.  Let's send Damnable Donald straight to Hell... where he Belongs.
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for increased minimum affordable ends.
Not really.  That's joe Biden's thing.  And Hunter. #YouAreProjectingAgain
Biden. Warren had already dropped out, and I was glad to vote for the presumptive nominee and thumb my nose at the Twitter smear merchants.
Vote for Joe Biden! America needs Joe!
This is the dumbest thing ive ever read. Someone quote this when Joe Biden wins and the hand sanitizer doesn't disappear.
So why all this defending the swamp? Do you like the CCP? Do you think our politicians should be in the pockets of the CCP? Do you choose Biden because he publicly kisses their asses? How about Feinstein defending the CCP publicly after having a CCP spy on her staff for years?
so we‚Äôre all supposed to what, forget that joe Biden has been a known quantity for 3 decades and spent most of the last decade as VP?    people already know joe Biden.  but bad plans poorly executed are what these fascist stooges are all about.
Nope until we prove it by selecting Biden
I'm disgusted with both parties.  I might go independent.  I've only decided that it won't by Biden and certainly not Trump.
Good evening Angela.  I hope you had a very good weekend... and... I hope that Joe Biden will Win on November 3rd. That's only three months away ,. Now.  Let's send the Trump Crime Family packing their baggage as they move OUT of the White House. Good Riddance
I mean to be fair that might be because your friends are all Biden supporters and also Republicans recognize that your vote wouldn't easily go to Trump if it was strictly a 2 party decision  Like I'm a GP supporter too but I'm betting Republicans also think they deserve your vote
When you say things like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt criticize Biden until after the election‚Äù- you sound very much like a tr*mp supporterüò¨ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
‚ÄúPlease Vote for me for Senate‚Äù....Joe Biden
I totally agree. The cheerleading for Joe Biden feels like people pretending this is the same kind of Presidential election as ever. I do think, though, that the louder Trump supporters get the more desperate they show themselves to be.
Do you really think that by calling him every name Trump is known by it will change anything, or somehow people will mistake Trump's chaos and feeble state for Joe Biden? The People know who our National Emergency is.
Killer bees with alien DNA could be his running mate.. I'm voting for Biden !
My mother, who was a Benghazi truther at one time, just said she wants Rice as Biden's VP. Voters aren't always consistent yall.
I‚Äôm confident that Joe Biden and everyone around him are preparing for every possible outcome on election night, including not knowing the outcome for several days / weeks. This hellsite can really raise anxiety several levels.
Like I can play off some funny jokes about haha I'm sad that tiktok is lost now I'll vote for Biden, but with total honesty I am saying the death of #TikTok is about taking away my generations ability to connect with and influence each other because that usually leads to BLM shit
I was a teen in ATL when Ferraro was named VP pick. I thought every girl was as excited as I was, until a classmate said she‚Äôd never vote for a woman for President because a woman would cry when declaring war.  I assume she‚Äôs also a 49 year old voter now.
Wow Joe Biden is going to release the secondary WNBA jerseys and on-court merch line?
So why are you backing Biden if you want that .....he still thinks he‚Äôs running for the Senate
Biden's best bet is to avoid the debates.

What Joe Biden Wants
Okay I definitely thought Biden's running mate would be announced by this morning
The only thing we have seen on the Biden Dem "chopping block" are progressive policy and progressive voices. He is aiming at Obama 3.0 a neo liberal clam bake with all the usual crustaceans.
Haven't yet meth mouth!
Young man? I'm 51 &amp; it's not my boyfriend I'd be worried about, it's my 22 y/o daughter.  But like my gay and lesbian friends say when a hick comes at you, they usually want you. Stick to your farm animals meth mouth.
Bass Demings Duckworth Harris Rice Warren  My head says Harris, my heart says Warren, and ‚Äúinsiders‚Äù say it‚Äôs Bass, Harris, or Rice.   But given the PsyOps that surround the #Veep pick, I think it could all be a smokescreen.   Therefore, my prediction: #biden picks
What is it with these women and their ambition? Why can't they be more like Biden? He's been running for President since 1997, and nobody ever accuses him of being ambitious. Be more like Joe.
Trump can even make debates creepy. Because he is a misogynistic sociopath.  He won't be able to do that again Biden.
Rep. Karen Bass fought for Blacks and Latinos in South Los Angeles. Now, she‚Äôs on Biden‚Äôs VP shortlist.
That‚Äôs hilarious, No I have never seen a Biden sticker
Biden has no determination to challenge the system of big-money donors, revolving-door appointments, and back-channel influence that has shapes the Democratic Party‚Äôs decision-making. Transformative policies do not to emerge from an untransformed process.
Harris is a safe choice, and has a high enough profile with average voters to be seen as presidential material if she had to step in for Biden.  Bass, Demings, and Rice might look good on paper to politicos, but would have to build national profiles quickly.
Was it much of a concern for the Obama campaign that Biden‚Äôs 2008 campaign fizzled out, the second time that had happened?
Do you do her with your stump?  From what you say, you could drive a truck through her. I'm sure your wittle toy wouldn't do the trick.

And they are walking around proclaiming it is in Biden‚Äôs name? No it is in the name of Equality, it is the name of Civil Rights. This man just proclaimed white supremacy and the name of Trump and whacked that woman in his vile name.
Please I hope Biden don‚Äôt win
AND VOTE FOR BIDEN
EVERYBODY VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN!
They're too busy gawking at Nike's super inspiring new commercial while wearing Nikes made using slave labor. Only the leaders understand, arguably why they would let a shell of a man like Biden become a candidate in hopes to get Trump 4 more years so they can pad their wallets
The strategy now is to proactively pressure voters to unquestionably support the unilateral decision yet-to-be made by Joe Biden for his VP based on the fact that he promises it will be a woman.  Promising to hire women as a preemptive shield against anyone who disagrees with me.
If only Biden could have done something about it since the 70s
Biden Faces Pressure To Pick A Black Running Mate. But Warren Remains A Top Contender.
Why a Biden admin will be the usual corporate suspects: "We can‚Äôt all go to think tanks, or into academia", you don't want to "fill government entirely with people from [universities] detached from the mechanics of Washington.‚Äù Ah, the "mechanics"!
Joe Biden select Sarah Palin as unity ticket VP challenge
And I'm actually not saying I would vote for Trump because.. obviously I'm not doing that. I'm just saying your bad insults about how a vote for Green Party is a vote for Trump, and I'm too privileged to know why people are voting for Biden... they're provably false.
Like there's genuinely no difference. There's nothing you could say that would persuade me to vote for someone I believe to be a rapist. I was Blue No Matter Who till Bloomberg joined, I'm maintaining that rule for Biden.
Talking about the Supreme Court means nothing because I know Biden pushed Clarence Thomas in, who was both a sexual predator (wow just like Biden!) and a bad judge.
And on issues? Biden claims to care about trans people about as much as Trump did in 2016. Both versions of "reforming the police" involve a support of the "job training" (prison slavery) that motivates capitalist arrests and further segregation of neighborhoods.
I'm also more inclined to believe in accelerationism when the opponents are very nearly the same but the repulsed reaction of the public is heavier towards one candidate. And Biden is as good as Trump was in 2016, we just think he's better because a frog that slowly boils dies.
Also Trump is a 4 year term but either Biden will be an 8 year term or the next president will be Republican. The dissatisfaction with the democratic party will lead to a Republican that will blame all our problems on the democrats and minorities concentrated within them- fascism
They're also both going after China, which is a huge issue for me. Biden is going after them harder, for non issues, tryna do a medical industrial complex to colonize the continent. I don't want to watch the last noneuropean continental stronghold be colonized and terrorized.
I'm not saying Trump is good. I've seen both of them speak in publicly. They're both horrendous. When I saw Biden speak, I tried to keep my laughing down (as did most of the crowd) because we saw him as an impossible candidate and didn't want to make him feel senile.
Biden supporters really love to cling onto anything I say as an excuse to canvass me  I promise you I can persuade more people to vote 3rd party than your entire campaign has to vote Biden, I will reverse canvass yall so hard. Come at me.
Biden is running on the most progressive platform in history, following Clinton, who previously had the most progressive platform in history.
Abolishing the filibuster under Biden, for instance, means centrists like Sinema, Manchin, and Murkowski have influence, rather than needing to go cap-in-hand to relatively conservative Senators for their cloture votes and usually coming away empty-handed.
In fairness, the chattering classes are incessantly yakking away about Biden's Veep pick instead of the hundreds of other significant weaknesses and failings he has as a candidate, much less as a potential President.  Perhaps someone on his campaign knows what they're doing!
Ken Salazar is advising Biden on energy issues, Joe's Green New Deal begins and ends here, with a man who represents fossil fuel production at its most devious.
Steve Ricchetti spent years as a registered lobbyist, and through¬†Ricchetti Consulting Group¬†is being paid by both¬†the Biden campaign¬†&amp; AT&amp;T. Anita Dunn, Mr. Biden‚Äôs chief campaign strategist, was also still doing work for AT&amp;T last month.
Mr. Biden has pledged to, ‚Äúexpand on and codify‚Äù the Obama administration¬†lobbying executive order¬†‚Äî the same policy he had privately complained about‚Äî bar lobbyists from working for agencies they tried to influence within the previous 2 years. How cute.
... and if you think Joe Biden is going to do anything about it, other than getting more $$$ out of it you are being very foolish.
üòÇüòÇ joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi said the same thing you clown.
Lol that‚Äôs a bc education for you. Trump tried to shut down travel from China but clowns like you joe Biden, and Nancy Pelosi said he was racist and told everyone not to worry about coronavirus and go into Chinatown
Actually I would definitely do it because I think Biden might drop out quick.
I am one of these people   I hate masks and just want my liberty  Biden has fought for us my entire life, and that an ivy league liberal elitist like yourself can't see it only confirms it  Keep talking, Biden now over 54%
Of course. Why would refusing to participate in what Trump will seek to turn into his usual offensive circus cause me not to vote for Joe Biden?
Biden commander in chief and Tulsi stuck by his side sounds gross.
Taken from a person who obviously needs to "get pussy".  It has a habit of just finding me.  Glad to know you're no competition.
How anybody could support the democratic party is beyond me. Joe Biden? Hillary? Pelosi? Schiff? Dear god people, look your leaders. One good person and President Trump will be back at The Apprentice. But no, you would rather play politics. Crazy.
Considering how little Dems pushed Trump I highly doubt we‚Äôll see Biden ousted. However, he has said he‚Äôs thinking of only going one term, so I imagine his VP pick will be the chosen one in 2024. But Biden isn‚Äôt gonna pick a non-corporatist so the conversation just feels shallow.
Between a Scientology apologist, black woman profiting off prison labor industry, and a Sith that stabbed Bernie in the back (decades of hands in the MIC cookie jar)  Not taking into account Joe Biden this is already the worst election in the history of US
Biden will never debate. If he does, he will have someone do it for him. Or you will see him virtually just Incase there needs to be a technical malfunction.
What experience does a real estate manager/slumlord and a shoe designer have to work in a governmental position?  Perhaps you should stop listening to what the Trumps, etc., are telling you about Hunter Biden, and start looking at what they *aren‚Äôt* telling you about themselves.
Biden‚Äôs Big-Tent Strategy Seems to Be Working  via

Honestly banning tiktok is the one thing that could get me to vote biden. I'm 19 this is obviously my issue
Oh I totally agree we need more representation but identity politics allows candidates to get off the hook bc Biden can pick a corporatist WoC &amp; that‚Äôs considered progress even though she will push for the exact same agenda any other corporatist white man would.

Hilary and Biden both ran on "the most progressive platform in American history" so I'm going to open an abattoir with "the most vegan platform in slaughterhouse history".
You sound like you voted for Joe Biden in the primary
Biden won the black vote under 45 in SC. It‚Äôs and age thing. You know, those of us who have a future we want to protect for our kids.
A fair assessment of a very bad choice. Biden is already a terrible candidate. His team is already shaping up as Obama 3.0 which is really Clinton 4.0. Rice is just what he doesn't need.Hold on and fasten your seat belt! We are in for the most horrific months prior to Nov election with Foreign interference Trump welcomes. Attacking our postal system during a pandemic requiring the safety of mail-in ballots. GOP senators investigating Biden and son using Russia.
Dan, Joe Biden was never worthy of the black vote.

When it comes to hoaxes, Donald Trump has a perfect losing record.   The hoaxes he perpetrated have been exposed, while those he said were aimed against him turned out not to be hoaxes at all.
WON'T WORK!  Why? Biden will have a black woman for VP.  And the ones NOT chosen WILL BE IN HIS cabinet!!
No chance in hell am I voting for Biden you people that are are blind.
Yeah but dude Joe Biden said it...you can‚Äôt make fun of Joe Biden. What are you...a MAGAt?????
TIL driving stick is an incredible, amazing, edgy skill and Joe Biden is actually cool. Thanks guys.
I‚Äôm just saying, we need to have a Trump vs. Biden Thunderdome match for the Presidency in November. I‚Äôll even sing, ‚ÄúWe Don‚Äôt Need Another Hero,‚Äù to sweeten the deal.
I regret to inform you that Joe Biden‚Äôs father is not the drift king.
Biden won‚Äôt hurt God but Trump might hurt Jesus‚Äôs fist.
Someone should tall DJT that he's too late with his latest Biden take: Falwell has already killed God. And buried him under a pile of...
Trump has us On Our Knees and grieving for our country‚Äôs current state of chaos and deaths. We need Biden who knows how to grieve and knows personally the ways out of grieves depressions...  Biden a decent man to ‚Äúget us thru‚Äù.
Apparently Biden can hurt God, which is a really weird endorsement from  who isn't nearly strong enough to hurt God, because he's a little bitch.
This coming from a lifelong lib. A conservative could possibly not vote for Trump...but would never vote for what Biden and the rest of the socialists are promising.
I think the problem might be that you find it incomprehensible that someone would find it pretty amusing that Joe Biden said ‚Äúgod, could my dad drive a car...oof‚Äù.   Sorry I upset you promise ü•∫üëâüëà
I mean all I did was find Joe Biden‚Äôs quote about his dad funny. Is there problem with that?
You know I‚Äôm not sure...could you possibly write a few more sentences explaining a rhetorical device because some people found a Joe Biden quote funny?
I can‚Äôt believe that Biden‚Äôs choice for VP will truly change anyone‚Äôs mind about who they will vote for. Maga people aren‚Äôt going to switch over because of it and Biden people are already locked in
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
had a great bit comparing their dementia, likening Trump's narcissism to Bob Dole's pen-- stabilizing him. Meanwhile Biden's consciousness is totally unmoored
Wait......is Joe Biden the son of Keiichi Tsuchiya?? ??
Biden looks like he is in a lot better shape than the current President. Normalcy vs Chaos is the difference
Trump ahead of biden fundraising? Makes you ask where it is cominv from. I'm going with RUSSIA.(funneled in of course) NRA. Who else?
Biden should withhold debates until you produce your tax returns.  a Quid pro quo, if you will.
this is a pathetic.  Biden is a vile being who should not be running for President.  Biden is the racist.   #BidenIsARacist #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica  #Democrats the far left are the problem, not the solution. #Trump2020
Democrats will clearly do whatever it takes to seize power. On Wednesday Grassley accused Democrats of resorting to dirty tricks in order to derail investigations into Joe and Hunter Biden‚Äôs dealings with Ukraine.¬†"This is the behavior of cowards. And it has to stop,"
We BOTH agree that Biden will WIN! Possitive thinking my friend!üá∫üá∏üíï

Please dont use Joe Biden's name in any of your ridiculous  and nonsensical morning shitshow tweets
Why when I wamt to tweet Joe Biden, Joe Scarborough comes up as 1st?  Just asking!

I don‚Äôt care if Joe Biden stays in a bunker until the election; I‚Äôll vote for him.

Just because this steroid-addled tool doesn't follow Biden's appearances and interviews doesn't men they don't exist.
It is important for the media to put Biden on the spot about what Trump era horrors he will overturn. The scope of unlegislated damage is vast, deep and a Biden presidency needs to be specific as to what they will get rid of and what they will quietly keep.
Way off base and all lies.  I am Catholic, former member of a religious community, and I support Biden.  He, unlike you, is a good, honest and caring man.  I do NOT support abortion unless for medical reasons, etc.  Each candidate has a menu of issues.  We have to select the best
Do you think there's a single person- who would otherwise vote for Biden - that would switch to Trump because of the Benghazi boogeymanning that Rice will be subjected to?  Nah - that's strictly right wing meat.
Your fixation on Trump‚Äôs family while turning a blind eye to Biden‚Äôs is amusing but sad.
Biden confidants see final 2  #axiosam

I think Biden is possibly the worst choice for potus since Obama.
Unlike President Trump, Joe Biden has spent his career backing trade deals that have killed U.S. jobs and hollowed out American manufacturing.
Given the Burisma-Ukraine-China influence-peddling scandals, Hunter Biden‚Äôs extensive international travel during the Obama-Biden presidency, including at least 5 trips to China, raises serious questions about where else he traveled in the final 2  1/2 years of the Obama admin

Biden would have kept the doors open to China early on. Pelosi was inviting people to Chinatown.  and Dr. Fauci said no big deal, masks weren‚Äôt needed and a host of other bullshit statements. Meanwhile the inner cities burn with ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù protests.

Biden‚Äôs plan to move away from domestic energy and towards wind and solar would result in lower pay for blue-collar workers in the energy sector. The average pay for oil/gas workers is $96,600, which is 2X solar panel installers, and 60% more than a wind turbine technician.

Biden‚Äôs people have spent MONTHS vetting vice-presidential candidates, evaluating their past political and personal dealings, public statements and social media interactions, voting records, friends, family, and much more.   Every one of those things would disqualify Trump.
Yes but why. Follow the money and you will have you answer. Biden, Fauci, Gates. That‚Äôs where you should start

You support Biden and he committed to having ‚ÄúBeto‚Äù his anti 2nd amendment czar.

Yes am all in on Sen. Harris because she is qualified  and of the many women Biden considered she is the only one I could imagine as President of in 4 years or 8.  She makes me feel optimistic.  It is a fleeting thought but she is the only one that prompts. All in for B/H
They have asked for those funds... 2 months ago when they passed the HEROS BILL YOU MORON! YOU ARE THE PROBLEM NOT THE SOLUTION.... BIDEN AND HARRIS ARE GOING TO STEP UP AND SHUT YOU DOWN... VOTE BLUE!

Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
maybe you missed the entire point of what you‚Äôre responding to, so i‚Äôll try again. it‚Äôs not that i ‚Äúlike‚Äù biden or think he‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than trump or the ‚Äúlesser evil‚Äù  this is it. the only way to save our democracy is to defeat trump. biden‚Äôs the opponent. that‚Äôs it.
Weird how they endorse Biden when they have no other choice. Who did they endorse in the primary? Oh, apparently the guy you think ruined their jobs
And I just gave the Biden/Harris campaign $50. All in.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
4 years of Biden doing absolutely nothing to slow or reverse the continuing rightward slide of America followed by an even more dimwitted populist ideologue, rinse, repeat, until we have moved so far right that Reagan and Thatcher's graves can be pissed on simultaneously
lol at these lunatics acting like Joe Biden is anything other than the most boring uninspiring centrist.
right now reporting on Trump pushing Barr to be the best AG ever if he does his bidding with Sen Johnson‚Äôs disinformation about Biden. Can you imagine that they are normalizing this? Done with them, the media really needs to step it up or we will end up like Belarus.
WTF thousands and thousands of countries,there is only 195 countries in the world. And Trump has the audacity to say Joe Biden is slow in his fake ads. lol
I would argue that genocidal dictators are not actually leftists because authoritarianism is a fascist ideology. That being said, for context, the person writing that tweet above was comparing being rude to a Biden canvasser to being an asshole in the alt-right lol
Biden should have paid another kid to repeat it for him.
One of my neighbors has a LGBTQ+ flag sandwiched by two Biden flags. Seeing less and less political signs, too obvious that it's a waste of resources and just adding to the trash heap.
I hope the answer is obvious.  You may not like Joe Biden.  But he won‚Äôt destroy this country.  It really is that simple.  A vote for Biden is a vote to save America.
Had anyone in the administration had it.. It could have saved America.     We'll just wait for Biden and Harris.   I read a new hashtag today.. #cousinfucker.
what are you even talking about?  I'm voting to get a fascist out of office before American democracy is extinguished.  the end.  this is an existential crisis for our country, and you're babbling about brunch.  so, yes, some of us didn't want Biden, but we're adults about it.
Biden‚Äôs been in office 50 years how is that new leadership
you can't just waive at multiple people and say "they're all the same, all bad" and then when someone points out the very idea of degrees, say it's ridiculous.  on every issue you care about, Biden is better than Trump, but "they're all the same, all bad"

Now that Wokeness has become profitable, they can ride economy surge under Trump while blaming him for the misogyny and bigotry of the Americans voting for Kamala who will likely step in for Biden. More of the same if she gets in. For the record, I'm not a Trumper by any measure
says the guy who won't cast a meaningful vote against Trump.  listen to yourself!  it's on Biden if you choose to vote for Mickey Mouse?
The kind gentle questioning of Harris and Biden, compare that to the Trump scrum that he does on a daily basis? Notice not screaming??
can you try for a minute looking at the situation a different way?    your vote belongs to no one but you.    but there is one candidate who is a significant danger to all of us, especially those already in need.  a vote for anyone but Biden does not help get rid of Trump.
I know...You're not gonna let Joe Biden cut America's meat!
"Biden voters mostly say they plan to cast their vote by mail, 62% to 36%.  Trump supporters, though, plan to physically go to the polls ‚Äî 72% to 24%."  Any surprise why Republicans want to kill USPS in a pandemic?   Fucking cowards.

Or I guess the correct thing to say would be from pat the berner "If sharing Biden &amp; Kamala's records helps Trump, then Biden &amp; Kamala's records help Trump."
lol Biden has done nothing in his 40 plus years... he won‚Äôt start now if he wins!
I'll stop now, but the idea that labor is "meh" on Biden is absurd.  You don't speak for the labor movement, it speaks for itself and enthusiastically endorses Joe Biden.
labor does support biden.  he has endorsements from the AFL‚ÄìCIO, Amalgamated Transit Union, American Federation of Government Employees, American Federation of Musicians, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, American Federation of Teachers  /1
I called it, hard to believe I was right. Only person we've seen try to lose this hard in our country was Trump 2016. Biden's not in this to win it, I'm pretty sure he's hoping this final spit on POC will get him safely back in his basement the next four years
I'm saying don't try to make *me* or *all democrats* responsible for some guy blocking you.  that's his decision, not mine, not Biden's, and not the Democratic party's.

He's going to ask moderate Republicans and Republican leaning ind to vote for biden instead a 3rd party or staying home. Good enough for me. I also believe aoc should be given just as much if not more time as kasich
He's not the impeached, treasonous, utter moron who's squatting in the White House right now.  In reality, Mr. Biden has a laundry list of qualifications for this job, but at the end of the day he's the anti-Trump, and THAT is what is going to win him this election.
The world has been laughing, excluding, and moving on without the US with Treasonous Trump, the impeached idiot, squatting in the White House.   President Biden will restore dignity and respect to the US, and to his office.
you can't assume the "leading candidate" would otherwise get the votes the "spoiler" candidate gets. I for one would never vote for an imperialist hawk like Biden. you're wasting time berating people for their convictions that you don't even seem interested in understanding.
naomi lachance was texted by a Biden volunteer who said they were 12 when asked, and at 9am the next morning texted the kid "baby did i say something wrong" which is the most grooming-ass creepy shit to pull on a 12 year old, after asking them to explain rape the night before.
lmao they de-checkmarked the "journalist" who was creeping on the 12 year old Biden text volunteer
WATCH: Here's what  told  two weeks ago about being vetted by the Biden campaign.
Electing them at all is the opposite of holding them accountable. Biden opposes busing and writes the crime bill and his reward is he gets to be president? Kamala uses her power to keep prisoners because they‚Äôre valuable labor and she gets to be VP?

If they were an adult then I legitimately don‚Äôt see what would be inappropriate about responding the way she did. If I was a victim of sexual assault I‚Äôd be pretty snappy too if someone tried to get me to make calls for Joe Biden.
I agree it‚Äôs their fault! I‚Äôm not trying to trap you into saying anything, as someone who wants trump out so badly that I‚Äôd settle for Biden even though I don‚Äôt agree with him on alot, and as a fellow progressive, I‚Äôm curious to understand your point of view.
According to the   had a "standout" interview with Biden's search team and left the team "dazzled."
It‚Äôs not bad faith! Like I supported Warren but when she dropped out,I supported Bernie bc he champions many of the same progressive causes that are important to me. I didn‚Äôt want Biden or any moderate, and I‚Äôm not thrilled about it but I sure as hell will vote for him over trump
Ok yay! I think you answered my question. Bernie is the only candidate you would support. It‚Äôs not just Biden, you wouldn‚Äôt have voted for anyone but Bernie, regardless of how closely policy aligns. Thank you!

Great read. The final four in serious contention for the job were Harris, Rice, Warren and Whitmer.
It's either Carte Goodwin or Joe Biden, and I think it might be the latter.
If I had to show people two clips to sum up the 2020 primary, it would be this (ending the Bloomberg run), and the always awesome clip of  meeting Joe Biden in the NYT elevator.
Is that how you going to answer Biden during the debates ?  " Ahhhh...".   Lol
This does of course depend entirely on Biden diverging from the Obama Doctrine of "looking forward not backward"   i.e. overlooking the crimes of powerful people because they happened in the past, while overseeing the world's largest ever prison state for nonviolent offenders.
I guess at least if Biden is president he probably won't attempt to block  from delivering ballots in an effort to steal an election
And the sad thing is that you would hesitate to vote for Biden.

Some of these are certainly compelling arguments but I‚Äôm not fully convinced on all the points. Regardless this is a far more convincing argument than ‚Äúget over it‚Äù or ‚Äúanything other than a vote Biden is a vote for Trump‚Äù.
Then why are you demanding loyalty and a vote rather than fighting for better policies. Biden‚Äôs still hasn‚Äôt been named as the nominee till the convention. Why would you stop making demands? Especially now? It‚Äôs a pandemic depression. Millions are losing their healthcare
I‚Äôm not voting for trump. I hear that‚Äôs a vote for Biden

Extremely fucked up that Joe Biden has plagiarized all of his speeches from Molloy. We should‚Äôve known after his 15 minute bit at the Iowa State Fair about sucking on pebbles.
I‚Äôm garbage because?... I said yelling at people and name calling doesn‚Äôt recruit voters. Ok.   How many calls have you made phone banking for Biden today?
All I hear all day long is how great Biden is at this or how wonderful Biden did that. Biden, Biden, Biden!
Guys some people are constantly bullying me over Biden choice they say I am progressive deep state agent
I'm getting a kick out of everyone that lambasted Ted Cruz for backing Trump after he got eviscerated by him during the debates only to go "YAAAASSS" at Biden picking the woman who called him a racist and said she believed the women that accused him of misconduct.
Not when Joe Biden is president The world is already laughing at us because of you because of your ignorance and stupidity world leaders laughing at us you‚Äôre worried about UAE  we have lines of Americans trying to get a box of food you are the worst president ever
Another way that the DEMS can try to cast the   ticket as one that reflects 21st century America.  Going forwards, not backwards. Biden's age may get in the way of that messaging, but this is why Harris' background helps.  #Election2020
Honestly, if I am the Biden campaign, I am putting Kamala on television every day. Trump will lose his mind. (If there's anymore of it left to go.)
The world is currently laughing at Trump because of his botched handling of COVID-19 amongst other things including his fanning the flames of racial tensions. A Biden and Harris will restore honor and respectability to the U.S. #BidenandHarris2020
To anyone who may have purchased a baseball cap from the Biden online store, how is the fit?

Nobody is sweating like Judgey Jeanine today after her death "premonition" about Joe Biden last night. She'll be getting a visit from the FBI. Perhaps another suspension from Fox Spews.
Its funny bc I read the investment strat reports on Biden‚Äôs admin and its like nobody bothers to read the policies he has up on his website. Its pretty amazing
If Trump wins, then it‚Äôs four years of the liberal blame game.   If Biden wins, I can guarantee it‚Äôs four years of liberal complacency.
But that means not voting for Trump IS a vote for Biden. Man what a paradox...
Only 82 days left for the ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote/if you don‚Äôt vote Biden, you‚Äôre voting for trump‚Äù folks
Yup. If it‚Äôs close he‚Äôs gonna demand six recounts, if Biden thwomps him, he‚Äôs gonna cry fraud.
160,000 dead Americans didn‚Äôt change Trump‚Äôs popularity. Remember that as you read coverage about the election and whether Biden‚Äôs message is working or whatever armchair campaign quarterbacking narrative gets a lot of play. Most votes are just not up for grabs.

I believe this is overthinking it. Cooking and family are often part of her public persona. But calculation is part of every politician's public speech, male or female. Biden talks about family all the time - genuine or calculated? On the other hand, Trump never does.

While President Biden may decide on a pardon, Cyrus Vance is not bound by it.  A NY state prison might become Trump‚Äôs new home.  With the benefit of years, I think Ford was right to pardon Nixon.  Not as simple this time.

I actually liked Biden‚Äôs speech yesterday for a change
Biden realllly just wants to spend more time with his grandkids holding them underwater making th suck his toes or whatever weird shit he's into. He's trying to lose.
Fuck Joe Biden!!
I like how Biden supporters are straight up telling me that these days. That's what it means when you say "it's not as bad as it could have been"
#KamalaHarris was a bad choice for VP but a worse choice was #Biden for president is pretty much the vibe I'm getting
They got me with Bass because that suggestion came out of the left of the party. But Rice only makes sense if you think like a DC insider (imo): technocratic liberal with no domestic policy chops who will never overshadow Biden. In a way, it seems perfect for his low-key strat.
Rice made no sense to us in the electorate, but she made sense to people who think Biden only wants to replicate 2009-2017. And the GOP thinks Dems are arrogant enough to just ignore Benghazi (which while stupid was in fact a big-ish deal).
For the first time in history, I think a headfake worked. I am utterly convinced Rice was a fake-out designed to get the GOP ready to re-litigate Benghazi, and the media bought into the fake for precisely the amount of time Biden needed them to for it to penetrate GOP circles.
apparently each hateful idiot in America is going to require an immediate family member to go on a ventilator ... and then they‚Äôll potentially be open to denying this is a different way, perhaps something involving Biden or maybe child abduction.
I'm not one to defend pundits, but they may mean safe as far as ideology. She is far less radical than some of the other contenders. Like Biden, she is an establishment Democrat.
Funny how folks like you never said that about the even flimsier allegations The Intercept (and Intercept alone by the end) pushed about Biden.  How did Bernie Sanders, a good man, end up surrounding himself with the utter dregs of political organizing?
Fuck Joe Biden.
Biden is pro-life. He wears a mask.
When VP Harris said "open and... shut," Trump and Pence exhailed and buckled like they'd been kicked in the croch.  Biden/Harris 2020.
I don't trust mail in ballots with what's going on. I'm going to wear my mask, social distance, and proudly go vote for Biden /Harris. If rather risk going than to not have my vote count. I fucking hate this Administration. Pure corruption.
It's not about Kamala or Biden.ü§î It's about weeding out the people who are pretending to be on a certain agenda while literally on the other side. I would prefer facts rather than interpretations and whether any of her new work has progressed in a new direction.
Biden picks a San Francisco Dem loved by big tech.  And Cicilline wants to blow smoke?   And Nesi is rolling them apparently

Ambassador Rice makes a very cool point about people in Biden's camp: Fidelity. It is important They can be trusted.  This is an AWESOME clip.  Goes to respect for the candidate - and reflects the value of high quality people in management.  So cool....So Susan Rice.
If Joe Biden is inaugurated and the Senate flips I‚Äôll have the emotional bandwidth to contemplate the whole Virtual Youtuber thing. Until then I‚Äôm going for pure Patrick O‚ÄôBrian mode where I don‚Äôt know whether computers exist and only know about frigates, sloops, staysails etc
Is Biden my first choice? No of course not. But am I gonna vote for someone who literally said they would date their own daughter? ABSOLUTELY THE FUCK NOT.
why did you give Joe Biden better music than you? Also Trains are socialism.
Susan Rice is truly just a class act right now on Maddow. Speaking glowingly about Kamala and the thoroughness of the vetting process. 100% in a Biden / Harris administration if they win. My guess would be Secretary of State.
Do you consider "supporting Biden over Trump" involves calling everyone to Biden's left the equivalent of a Trump Nazi? Because insulting people for disagreeing with your candidate isnt providing support to your candidate
(Before anyone misinterprets me I‚Äôm not encouraging you to not vote for Biden. What I am saying is that in this case the lesser evil will still lead to the literal end of the world unless we all start acting like climate change is the colossal and immediate threat that it is.)

If Trump underwent a health evaluation, Biden must, too! He looks unhealthy and shows many signs of cognitive decline. His refusal proves he's hiding something!
Biden's pick was racist and sexist. Blindly caving to subjugated persons isn't the same as being free from prejudice, it's just reverse-prejudice.
By the way Chris Dodd (criminal who received kickbacks from Countrywide) is now a Sr. Advisor to Joe Biden...
He's too dumb to hurt Biden.
I‚Äôd glad backtrack if his entire speech is pro-life propaganda but I have a funny feeling that the topic won‚Äôt come up beyond maybe some vague allusion to ‚Äúnot agreeing with Biden on everything but Trump needs to be removed‚Äù type point.

Biden can't manage his own sentence structure or thought processes and she thinks he can manage the virus recovery. I'd love to hear his answer to why the virus suddenly spiked in the south and west and what he would have done to stop it?

This is absurd and offensive.  You are actively shaming people into not using their God given agency to express opinions and critique a presidential ticket.  Are parents upset about the Biden/Harris K12 agenda "doing the work of Trump" if they say so out loud?  Good grief.

Is there Trump campaign rally/shit show on today?? Wouldn't be great if Biden announced his pick for VP during it!
Why is Biden announcing now and not waiting for the virtual conversation?  What‚Äôs the upside of doing this?
I have a Majic 8 Ball that is more predictable than what is being said in the news about Biden‚Äôs Choice, but enough already make the choice and announce it, stop dragging it on, it‚Äôs actually starting to aggravate me
Followed all that I was not already and RTüôÇ
I'm 46 years old this year!  And we are going to get Biden as 46th President!! #VoteForBiden  #BidenLandslide2020
People are dying, losing their homes, waiting in line for food and have lost their jobs and this motherfucker is up there taking jabs at Biden and making racist remarks.
Biden will have a lot of cleaning up to do after Trump.

Tbh logged onto this website MAD today bc the first things I saw were people praising the Lincoln Project (literally stop) &amp; some idiotic Daily Beast op-ed authored by a man who can't bring himself to vote for Biden bc abortion. Then, this headline sparked some joy -
If you think Joe Biden will do better than trump you don‚Äôt understand how little Joe has done in 40+ years in politics. And don‚Äôt see or care about the racist things he says every time he speaks #YouAintBlackShows the priorities of the Dems. He rails on Joe Biden for clear corruption, blackmailing Ukraine millions to fire the prosecutor who was investigating his son. They lose their minds, call for impeachment, go into Russiagate hysterics.
Biden's finally got a WAP -- Woman and Prosecutor
Apparently Biden wants to make student loans part of bankruptcy and I‚Äôm high key interested if that‚Äôs the best we‚Äôll get
Yes am all in on Sen. Harris because she is qualified  and of the many women Biden considered she is the only one I could imagine as President of in 4 years or 8.  She makes me feel optimistic.  It is a fleeting thought but she is the only one that prompts. All in for B/H
They have asked for those funds... 2 months ago when they passed the HEROS BILL YOU MORON! YOU ARE THE PROBLEM NOT THE SOLUTION.... BIDEN AND HARRIS ARE GOING TO STEP UP AND SHUT YOU DOWN... VOTE BLUE!
Who told this cheesedick Biden Bro that he's a leftist, I wanna whap them on the face with a newspaper
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
maybe you missed the entire point of what you‚Äôre responding to, so i‚Äôll try again. it‚Äôs not that i ‚Äúlike‚Äù biden or think he‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than trump or the ‚Äúlesser evil‚Äù  this is it. the only way to save our democracy is to defeat trump. biden‚Äôs the opponent. that‚Äôs it.
Weird how they endorse Biden when they have no other choice. Who did they endorse in the primary? Oh, apparently the guy you think ruined their jobs
And I just gave the Biden/Harris campaign $50. All in.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
4 years of Biden doing absolutely nothing to slow or reverse the continuing rightward slide of America followed by an even more dimwitted populist ideologue, rinse, repeat, until we have moved so far right that Reagan and Thatcher's graves can be pissed on simultaneously
lol at these lunatics acting like Joe Biden is anything other than the most boring uninspiring centrist.
right now reporting on Trump pushing Barr to be the best AG ever if he does his bidding with Sen Johnson‚Äôs disinformation about Biden. Can you imagine that they are normalizing this? Done with them, the media really needs to step it up or we will end up like Belarus.
I would argue that genocidal dictators are not actually leftists because authoritarianism is a fascist ideology. That being said, for context, the person writing that tweet above was comparing being rude to a Biden canvasser to being an asshole in the alt-right lol
Why am I sad? Let me tell you!  NO excitement on Twitter for our AWESOME CANDIDATES: JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS!  NO EXCITEMENT from the  for our AWESOME CANDIDATES! Perez should resign!  NO EXCITEMENT from our DEMOCRATIC Congress!  LETS GET GOING. VOTE.
Biden should have paid another kid to repeat it for him.
One of my neighbors has a LGBTQ+ flag sandwiched by two Biden flags. Seeing less and less political signs, too obvious that it's a waste of resources and just adding to the trash heap.
I hope the answer is obvious.  You may not like Joe Biden.  But he won‚Äôt destroy this country.  It really is that simple.  A vote for Biden is a vote to save America.
Had anyone in the administration had it.. It could have saved America.     We'll just wait for Biden and Harris.   I read a new hashtag today.. #cousinfucker.
what are you even talking about?  I'm voting to get a fascist out of office before American democracy is extinguished.  the end.  this is an existential crisis for our country, and you're babbling about brunch.  so, yes, some of us didn't want Biden, but we're adults about it.
Biden‚Äôs been in office 50 years how is that new leadership
It took a worldwide pandemic, hundreds of thousands of deaths and massive unemployment to bring the economy back to the Obama /Biden HIGH mark üòÇ
you can't just waive at multiple people and say "they're all the same, all bad" and then when someone points out the very idea of degrees, say it's ridiculous.  on every issue you care about, Biden is better than Trump, but "they're all the same, all bad"

Amen on that James Woods this country is hard to recognize now imagine what would happen with Biden and Harris God help us all they‚Äôll be no more United States of America it will cease to exist nice going Democrats
a vote for a 3P candidate is a vote the 3P candidate.  why is this hard to understand?    they aren't "Clinton's votes" unless they vote for Clinton.  full stop.  but i want to GET TRUMP OUT, not "elect Biden."  and the only vote that GETS TRUMP OUT is Biden.
Now that Wokeness has become profitable, they can ride economy surge under Trump while blaming him for the misogyny and bigotry of the Americans voting for Kamala who will likely step in for Biden. More of the same if she gets in. For the record, I'm not a Trumper by any measure
says the guy who won't cast a meaningful vote against Trump.  listen to yourself!  it's on Biden if you choose to vote for Mickey Mouse?
The kind gentle questioning of Harris and Biden, compare that to the Trump scrum that he does on a daily basis? Notice not screaming??
can you try for a minute looking at the situation a different way?    your vote belongs to no one but you.    but there is one candidate who is a significant danger to all of us, especially those already in need.  a vote for anyone but Biden does not help get rid of Trump.
I know...You're not gonna let Joe Biden cut America's meat!
"Biden voters mostly say they plan to cast their vote by mail, 62% to 36%.  Trump supporters, though, plan to physically go to the polls ‚Äî 72% to 24%."  Any surprise why Republicans want to kill USPS in a pandemic?   Fucking cowards.

It‚Äôs actually a gift for Biden, as more women insults from the morally bankrupt one are on the way!
Don Pesci: The old, tired and reclusive Joe Biden
Gov. Raimondo impressed Joe Biden's team when interviewing for VP pick but had some drawbacks, per
another great example of the differences between R and D votes.  do you think Biden/Harris are going to dismantle the post office?
Or I guess the correct thing to say would be from pat the berner "If sharing Biden &amp; Kamala's records helps Trump, then Biden &amp; Kamala's records help Trump."
lol Biden has done nothing in his 40 plus years... he won‚Äôt start now if he wins!
I'll stop now, but the idea that labor is "meh" on Biden is absurd.  You don't speak for the labor movement, it speaks for itself and enthusiastically endorses Joe Biden.
labor does support biden.  he has endorsements from the AFL‚ÄìCIO, Amalgamated Transit Union, American Federation of Government Employees, American Federation of Musicians, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, American Federation of Teachers  /1
I called it, hard to believe I was right. Only person we've seen try to lose this hard in our country was Trump 2016. Biden's not in this to win it, I'm pretty sure he's hoping this final spit on POC will get him safely back in his basement the next four years
I'm saying don't try to make *me* or *all democrats* responsible for some guy blocking you.  that's his decision, not mine, not Biden's, and not the Democratic party's.

My favorite thing about the Biden/Harris ticket is Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Why he said it would take months, if ever, to count votes!  He is DETERMINED not to leave the Whitehouse. We need a landslide for BIDEN!   VOTE!  ENOUGH votes WILL be counted to WIN! DON'T STAY HOME!
is selling Biden masks for $20.00 each.... no wonder he wants them to be mandatory. üò∑
He's going to ask moderate Republicans and Republican leaning ind to vote for biden instead a 3rd party or staying home. Good enough for me. I also believe aoc should be given just as much if not more time as kasich
He's not the impeached, treasonous, utter moron who's squatting in the White House right now.  In reality, Mr. Biden has a laundry list of qualifications for this job, but at the end of the day he's the anti-Trump, and THAT is what is going to win him this election.
The world has been laughing, excluding, and moving on without the US with Treasonous Trump, the impeached idiot, squatting in the White House.   President Biden will restore dignity and respect to the US, and to his office.
you can't assume the "leading candidate" would otherwise get the votes the "spoiler" candidate gets. I for one would never vote for an imperialist hawk like Biden. you're wasting time berating people for their convictions that you don't even seem interested in understanding.
naomi lachance was texted by a Biden volunteer who said they were 12 when asked, and at 9am the next morning texted the kid "baby did i say something wrong" which is the most grooming-ass creepy shit to pull on a 12 year old, after asking them to explain rape the night before.
lmao they de-checkmarked the "journalist" who was creeping on the 12 year old Biden text volunteer
WATCH: Here's what  told  two weeks ago about being vetted by the Biden campaign.
Would it be best if those of us willing to vote for Biden stay out of this? I don't mean fail to strike--I'm asking if the voices leading this need to be a subset (people like you) or a coalition (people like me, center-right people like most of the Dem party, etc.)?
Electing them at all is the opposite of holding them accountable. Biden opposes busing and writes the crime bill and his reward is he gets to be president? Kamala uses her power to keep prisoners because they‚Äôre valuable labor and she gets to be VP?

If they were an adult then I legitimately don‚Äôt see what would be inappropriate about responding the way she did. If I was a victim of sexual assault I‚Äôd be pretty snappy too if someone tried to get me to make calls for Joe Biden.
Between Biden and Harris - will raise taxes, police are like the KKK, cops are the enemy, take away guns, open boarders and BOTH said Trumps economic policies would cripple America
I agree it‚Äôs their fault! I‚Äôm not trying to trap you into saying anything, as someone who wants trump out so badly that I‚Äôd settle for Biden even though I don‚Äôt agree with him on alot, and as a fellow progressive, I‚Äôm curious to understand your point of view.
According to the   had a "standout" interview with Biden's search team and left the team "dazzled."
It‚Äôs not bad faith! Like I supported Warren but when she dropped out,I supported Bernie bc he champions many of the same progressive causes that are important to me. I didn‚Äôt want Biden or any moderate, and I‚Äôm not thrilled about it but I sure as hell will vote for him over trump
Ok yay! I think you answered my question. Bernie is the only candidate you would support. It‚Äôs not just Biden, you wouldn‚Äôt have voted for anyone but Bernie, regardless of how closely policy aligns. Thank you!
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to ‚Äî wait for it ‚Äî Russia

Biden is racist Harris is fake the two of them are puppets of Pelosi I‚Äôm voting red in November
You mean the mfg jobs that Obama said were never coming back?  The ones that we lost due to NAFTA. Which Biden promoted
Great read. The final four in serious contention for the job were Harris, Rice, Warren and Whitmer.
It's either Carte Goodwin or Joe Biden, and I think it might be the latter.
If I had to show people two clips to sum up the 2020 primary, it would be this (ending the Bloomberg run), and the always awesome clip of  meeting Joe Biden in the NYT elevator.
Is that how you going to answer Biden during the debates ?  " Ahhhh...".   Lol
This does of course depend entirely on Biden diverging from the Obama Doctrine of "looking forward not backward"   i.e. overlooking the crimes of powerful people because they happened in the past, while overseeing the world's largest ever prison state for nonviolent offenders.
I guess at least if Biden is president he probably won't attempt to block  from delivering ballots in an effort to steal an election
And the sad thing is that you would hesitate to vote for Biden.

Some of these are certainly compelling arguments but I‚Äôm not fully convinced on all the points. Regardless this is a far more convincing argument than ‚Äúget over it‚Äù or ‚Äúanything other than a vote Biden is a vote for Trump‚Äù.
Then why are you demanding loyalty and a vote rather than fighting for better policies. Biden‚Äôs still hasn‚Äôt been named as the nominee till the convention. Why would you stop making demands? Especially now? It‚Äôs a pandemic depression. Millions are losing their healthcare
I‚Äôm not voting for trump. I hear that‚Äôs a vote for Biden
Biden and Harris are fascists too bro
Mozilla is like Biden for me. I‚Äôm not always crazy about it/him, but in comparison to the alternative it‚Äôs no contest and I must support 100%
I get that entirely and I usually agree. Let's talk about the Presidential race, though. America needs Trump to lose. Trump is fascist, Biden isn't. I mean, at this level, that's all that matters to me right now. I should have worded the original tweet better.
He's too busy doing Putin's bidding to smear Biden to undertake necessary work.
Biden/CNN and Trump/FOX NEWS. What else is new.
Extremely fucked up that Joe Biden has plagiarized all of his speeches from Molloy. We should‚Äôve known after his 15 minute bit at the Iowa State Fair about sucking on pebbles.
I‚Äôm garbage because?... I said yelling at people and name calling doesn‚Äôt recruit voters. Ok.   How many calls have you made phone banking for Biden today?
Guys some people are constantly bullying me over Biden choice they say I am progressive deep state agent
I'm getting a kick out of everyone that lambasted Ted Cruz for backing Trump after he got eviscerated by him during the debates only to go "YAAAASSS" at Biden picking the woman who called him a racist and said she believed the women that accused him of misconduct.
Not when Joe Biden is president The world is already laughing at us because of you because of your ignorance and stupidity world leaders laughing at us you‚Äôre worried about UAE  we have lines of Americans trying to get a box of food you are the worst president ever

Another way that the DEMS can try to cast the   ticket as one that reflects 21st century America.  Going forwards, not backwards. Biden's age may get in the way of that messaging, but this is why Harris' background helps.  #Election2020
Honestly, if I am the Biden campaign, I am putting Kamala on television every day. Trump will lose his mind. (If there's anymore of it left to go.)
BIDEN IS A CLINTON CARTEL CRIMINAL. ALL DEMORATS ALWAYS ABOVE ALL USA LAW'S.
Maybe Biden should get behind the People.

To anyone who may have purchased a baseball cap from the Biden online store, how is the fit?
Yeah, Right.  I mean Obama/Biden brokered a peace agreement with them too...  Oh no, that's right, they destabilized Libya &amp; Syria instead, causing 600,000-1,000,000 dead.
I‚Äôm quite jealous of the folks excited for the Biden/Harris ticket. Like wouldn‚Äôt that be nice?
Biden ought to make this an issue, particularly with seniors and veterans. This president is taking away your mail delivery because he's afraid he might lose an election. Seriously.

Jill Biden should be charged with elderly abuse for allowing this to happen.
If Trump wins, then it‚Äôs four years of the liberal blame game.   If Biden wins, I can guarantee it‚Äôs four years of liberal complacency.
But that means not voting for Trump IS a vote for Biden. Man what a paradox...
Only 82 days left for the ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote/if you don‚Äôt vote Biden, you‚Äôre voting for trump‚Äù folks
Yup. If it‚Äôs close he‚Äôs gonna demand six recounts, if Biden thwomps him, he‚Äôs gonna cry fraud.
160,000 dead Americans didn‚Äôt change Trump‚Äôs popularity. Remember that as you read coverage about the election and whether Biden‚Äôs message is working or whatever armchair campaign quarterbacking narrative gets a lot of play. Most votes are just not up for grabs.

I believe this is overthinking it. Cooking and family are often part of her public persona. But calculation is part of every politician's public speech, male or female. Biden talks about family all the time - genuine or calculated? On the other hand, Trump never does.

While President Biden may decide on a pardon, Cyrus Vance is not bound by it.  A NY state prison might become Trump‚Äôs new home.  With the benefit of years, I think Ford was right to pardon Nixon.  Not as simple this time.

I like how Biden supporters are straight up telling me that these days. That's what it means when you say "it's not as bad as it could have been"
#KamalaHarris was a bad choice for VP but a worse choice was #Biden for president is pretty much the vibe I'm getting
They got me with Bass because that suggestion came out of the left of the party. But Rice only makes sense if you think like a DC insider (imo): technocratic liberal with no domestic policy chops who will never overshadow Biden. In a way, it seems perfect for his low-key strat.
Rice made no sense to us in the electorate, but she made sense to people who think Biden only wants to replicate 2009-2017. And the GOP thinks Dems are arrogant enough to just ignore Benghazi (which while stupid was in fact a big-ish deal).
For the first time in history, I think a headfake worked. I am utterly convinced Rice was a fake-out designed to get the GOP ready to re-litigate Benghazi, and the media bought into the fake for precisely the amount of time Biden needed them to for it to penetrate GOP circles.
apparently each hateful idiot in America is going to require an immediate family member to go on a ventilator ... and then they‚Äôll potentially be open to denying this is a different way, perhaps something involving Biden or maybe child abduction.
I'm not one to defend pundits, but they may mean safe as far as ideology. She is far less radical than some of the other contenders. Like Biden, she is an establishment Democrat.
Funny how folks like you never said that about the even flimsier allegations The Intercept (and Intercept alone by the end) pushed about Biden.  How did Bernie Sanders, a good man, end up surrounding himself with the utter dregs of political organizing?
Fuck Joe Biden.
Biden is pro-life. He wears a mask.
When VP Harris said "open and... shut," Trump and Pence exhailed and buckled like they'd been kicked in the croch.  Biden/Harris 2020.
I don't trust mail in ballots with what's going on. I'm going to wear my mask, social distance, and proudly go vote for Biden /Harris. If rather risk going than to not have my vote count. I fucking hate this Administration. Pure corruption.
It's not about Kamala or Biden.ü§î It's about weeding out the people who are pretending to be on a certain agenda while literally on the other side. I would prefer facts rather than interpretations and whether any of her new work has progressed in a new direction.

Ambassador Rice makes a very cool point about people in Biden's camp: Fidelity. It is important They can be trusted.  This is an AWESOME clip.  Goes to respect for the candidate - and reflects the value of high quality people in management.  So cool....So Susan Rice.
If Joe Biden is inaugurated and the Senate flips I‚Äôll have the emotional bandwidth to contemplate the whole Virtual Youtuber thing. Until then I‚Äôm going for pure Patrick O‚ÄôBrian mode where I don‚Äôt know whether computers exist and only know about frigates, sloops, staysails etc
Is Biden my first choice? No of course not. But am I gonna vote for someone who literally said they would date their own daughter? ABSOLUTELY THE FUCK NOT.
why did you give Joe Biden better music than you? Also Trains are socialism.
Susan Rice is truly just a class act right now on Maddow. Speaking glowingly about Kamala and the thoroughness of the vetting process. 100% in a Biden / Harris administration if they win. My guess would be Secretary of State.
Do you consider "supporting Biden over Trump" involves calling everyone to Biden's left the equivalent of a Trump Nazi? Because insulting people for disagreeing with your candidate isnt providing support to your candidate
(Before anyone misinterprets me I‚Äôm not encouraging you to not vote for Biden. What I am saying is that in this case the lesser evil will still lead to the literal end of the world unless we all start acting like climate change is the colossal and immediate threat that it is.)

If Trump underwent a health evaluation, Biden must, too! He looks unhealthy and shows many signs of cognitive decline. His refusal proves he's hiding something!
Biden's pick was racist and sexist. Blindly caving to subjugated persons isn't the same as being free from prejudice, it's just reverse-prejudice.
By the way Chris Dodd (criminal who received kickbacks from Countrywide) is now a Sr. Advisor to Joe Biden...
He's too dumb to hurt Biden.
I‚Äôd glad backtrack if his entire speech is pro-life propaganda but I have a funny feeling that the topic won‚Äôt come up beyond maybe some vague allusion to ‚Äúnot agreeing with Biden on everything but Trump needs to be removed‚Äù type point.

My first book was on the politics of the Social Security Trust Fund. I may need to write a new edition that discusses President Trump's pledge to terminate the payroll tax--and how he gave an unexpected political gift to Joe Biden. 1/2
Biden didn't singlehandedly bring Healthcare to a generation of Black children in the South the way Clinton did (CHIP). So I very much buy this.
Trump is accused of 26 rapes and sexual assaults. And trump is still a legit racist. Biden was misguided by the tough on crime bullshit but he's capable of change and growth. Learned from his mistakes. Trump was is and will always be racist.
I‚Äôm willing to defend Kamala against any and all sexist, racist, mysogonist bullshit. She should be ambitious. She should show no remorse for calling out Biden‚Äôs racist political history  But I‚Äôll also call out her disgusting prosecurorial record. Her hypocrisy and opportunism...
What evidence do you have of Trump that you don‚Äôt have of Biden?
Except a communist would advocate for the end of the state and communal living. Biden is literally a corpratist and centrist. Y'all just call anyone left of center a communist
The entire Biden Campaign would be burning to the ground right now if he made the wrong choice, omg.
Joe Biden announces since the announcement of Kamala Harris as VP, the campaign raised $26 million including 150,000 first time donors.
Seriously this is one of the things I respect most about  Trump's narcissism demands absolute loyalty - Biden decided that someone who challenged him was best suited for the job. #BidenHarris
It‚Äôs hard for me to watch Biden. I‚Äôm holding my breath the entire time.
It's more like you don't get to rally around Defund / Abolish Police only to support Biden and Harris considering who the fuck they are.
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event
You seem to have entirely different criticisms for the left than Joe Biden when we call for wildly popular and *practical* policies, but Joe claims hes gonna cure a collection of loosely connected diseases that have eluded scientists for centuries.
Biden gives me hope bc no one is under the delusion that Biden is going to do anything substantial of his own volition but can be forced into things. His base is malleable. Trump's base is a death cult. Th solution is to work on multiple fronts at once; th streets &amp; th ballot box
Yeah, longtime centrist Joe Biden just screams "Sharia Law"
advice to Biden: "Pick someone who will help you win". Biden listened and did just that.

Biden and Harris make 1st appearance as historic Democratic ticket
Right, abortion is 1 issue of thousands . He‚Äôs dead wrong on it. A lot of people are.  It sucks.  You can pretty much guarantee it won‚Äôt be a part of his speech and it certainly has no bearing on Biden‚Äôs platform.
do you still believe Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers and still think he‚Äôs a racist??? Just wondering
Is the current gov terrible? Yes Will a Biden/Harris win make it less terrible? Eh, possibly. Politicians are human and I'm not putting all my "progressive" eggs in this election basket.
Neither. But no choice is a choice, I guess. Biden 2020.
I dont even like Kamala and Biden like that but to hear politicans get up onstage and speak in complwte sentences and not attack reporters and minorities is striking
Should we try to imagine what is going on in Biden‚Äôs head?
when they screech that known-quantity, staid, moderate Joe Biden, who's been a public figure for 4 decades, is part of a radical socialist plot to do ... anything, they sound ridiculous to most Americans.  Joe Biden is many things, but a socialist is not one of them.

4 years of Biden doing absolutely nothing to slow or reverse the continuing rightward slide of America followed by an even more dimwitted populist ideologue, rinse, repeat, until we have moved so far right that Reagan and Thatcher's graves can be pissed on simultaneously
lol at these lunatics acting like Joe Biden is anything other than the most boring uninspiring centrist.
right now reporting on Trump pushing Barr to be the best AG ever if he does his bidding with Sen Johnson‚Äôs disinformation about Biden. Can you imagine that they are normalizing this? Done with them, the media really needs to step it up or we will end up like Belarus.
WTF thousands and thousands of countries,there is only 195 countries in the world. And Trump has the audacity to say Joe Biden is slow in his fake ads. lol
I would argue that genocidal dictators are not actually leftists because authoritarianism is a fascist ideology. That being said, for context, the person writing that tweet above was comparing being rude to a Biden canvasser to being an asshole in the alt-right lol
Biden should have paid another kid to repeat it for him.
One of my neighbors has a LGBTQ+ flag sandwiched by two Biden flags. Seeing less and less political signs, too obvious that it's a waste of resources and just adding to the trash heap.
I hope the answer is obvious.  You may not like Joe Biden.  But he won‚Äôt destroy this country.  It really is that simple.  A vote for Biden is a vote to save America.
Had anyone in the administration had it.. It could have saved America.     We'll just wait for Biden and Harris.   I read a new hashtag today.. #cousinfucker.
what are you even talking about?  I'm voting to get a fascist out of office before American democracy is extinguished.  the end.  this is an existential crisis for our country, and you're babbling about brunch.  so, yes, some of us didn't want Biden, but we're adults about it.
Biden‚Äôs been in office 50 years how is that new leadership
you can't just waive at multiple people and say "they're all the same, all bad" and then when someone points out the very idea of degrees, say it's ridiculous.  on every issue you care about, Biden is better than Trump, but "they're all the same, all bad"

Now that Wokeness has become profitable, they can ride economy surge under Trump while blaming him for the misogyny and bigotry of the Americans voting for Kamala who will likely step in for Biden. More of the same if she gets in. For the record, I'm not a Trumper by any measure
says the guy who won't cast a meaningful vote against Trump.  listen to yourself!  it's on Biden if you choose to vote for Mickey Mouse?
The kind gentle questioning of Harris and Biden, compare that to the Trump scrum that he does on a daily basis? Notice not screaming??
can you try for a minute looking at the situation a different way?    your vote belongs to no one but you.    but there is one candidate who is a significant danger to all of us, especially those already in need.  a vote for anyone but Biden does not help get rid of Trump.
I know...You're not gonna let Joe Biden cut America's meat!
"Biden voters mostly say they plan to cast their vote by mail, 62% to 36%.  Trump supporters, though, plan to physically go to the polls ‚Äî 72% to 24%."  Any surprise why Republicans want to kill USPS in a pandemic?   Fucking cowards.

I'll stop now, but the idea that labor is "meh" on Biden is absurd.  You don't speak for the labor movement, it speaks for itself and enthusiastically endorses Joe Biden.

I called it, hard to believe I was right. Only person we've seen try to lose this hard in our country was Trump 2016. Biden's not in this to win it, I'm pretty sure he's hoping this final spit on POC will get him safely back in his basement the next four years

He's not the impeached, treasonous, utter moron who's squatting in the White House right now.  In reality, Mr. Biden has a laundry list of qualifications for this job, but at the end of the day he's the anti-Trump, and THAT is what is going to win him this election.
The world has been laughing, excluding, and moving on without the US with Treasonous Trump, the impeached idiot, squatting in the White House.   President Biden will restore dignity and respect to the US, and to his office.
you can't assume the "leading candidate" would otherwise get the votes the "spoiler" candidate gets. I for one would never vote for an imperialist hawk like Biden. you're wasting time berating people for their convictions that you don't even seem interested in understanding.
naomi lachance was texted by a Biden volunteer who said they were 12 when asked, and at 9am the next morning texted the kid "baby did i say something wrong" which is the most grooming-ass creepy shit to pull on a 12 year old, after asking them to explain rape the night before.

If they were an adult then I legitimately don‚Äôt see what would be inappropriate about responding the way she did. If I was a victim of sexual assault I‚Äôd be pretty snappy too if someone tried to get me to make calls for Joe Biden.
I agree it‚Äôs their fault! I‚Äôm not trying to trap you into saying anything, as someone who wants trump out so badly that I‚Äôd settle for Biden even though I don‚Äôt agree with him on alot, and as a fellow progressive, I‚Äôm curious to understand your point of view.
According to the   had a "standout" interview with Biden's search team and left the team "dazzled."
It‚Äôs not bad faith! Like I supported Warren but when she dropped out,I supported Bernie bc he champions many of the same progressive causes that are important to me. I didn‚Äôt want Biden or any moderate, and I‚Äôm not thrilled about it but I sure as hell will vote for him over trump
Ok yay! I think you answered my question. Bernie is the only candidate you would support. It‚Äôs not just Biden, you wouldn‚Äôt have voted for anyone but Bernie, regardless of how closely policy aligns. Thank you!

It's either Carte Goodwin or Joe Biden, and I think it might be the latter.

Is that how you going to answer Biden during the debates ?  " Ahhhh...".   Lol
This does of course depend entirely on Biden diverging from the Obama Doctrine of "looking forward not backward"   i.e. overlooking the crimes of powerful people because they happened in the past, while overseeing the world's largest ever prison state for nonviolent offenders.
I guess at least if Biden is president he probably won't attempt to block  from delivering ballots in an effort to steal an election
And the sad thing is that you would hesitate to vote for Biden.

Then why are you demanding loyalty and a vote rather than fighting for better policies. Biden‚Äôs still hasn‚Äôt been named as the nominee till the convention. Why would you stop making demands? Especially now? It‚Äôs a pandemic depression. Millions are losing their healthcare

Another way that the DEMS can try to cast the   ticket as one that reflects 21st century America.  Going forwards, not backwards. Biden's age may get in the way of that messaging, but this is why Harris' background helps.  #Election2020
Honestly, if I am the Biden campaign, I am putting Kamala on television every day. Trump will lose his mind. (If there's anymore of it left to go.)

But that means not voting for Trump IS a vote for Biden. Man what a paradox...
160,000 dead Americans didn‚Äôt change Trump‚Äôs popularity. Remember that as you read coverage about the election and whether Biden‚Äôs message is working or whatever armchair campaign quarterbacking narrative gets a lot of play. Most votes are just not up for grabs.

I like how Biden supporters are straight up telling me that these days. That's what it means when you say "it's not as bad as it could have been"
#KamalaHarris was a bad choice for VP but a worse choice was #Biden for president is pretty much the vibe I'm getting
They got me with Bass because that suggestion came out of the left of the party. But Rice only makes sense if you think like a DC insider (imo): technocratic liberal with no domestic policy chops who will never overshadow Biden. In a way, it seems perfect for his low-key strat.
Rice made no sense to us in the electorate, but she made sense to people who think Biden only wants to replicate 2009-2017. And the GOP thinks Dems are arrogant enough to just ignore Benghazi (which while stupid was in fact a big-ish deal).
For the first time in history, I think a headfake worked. I am utterly convinced Rice was a fake-out designed to get the GOP ready to re-litigate Benghazi, and the media bought into the fake for precisely the amount of time Biden needed them to for it to penetrate GOP circles.
apparently each hateful idiot in America is going to require an immediate family member to go on a ventilator ... and then they‚Äôll potentially be open to denying this is a different way, perhaps something involving Biden or maybe child abduction.
I'm not one to defend pundits, but they may mean safe as far as ideology. She is far less radical than some of the other contenders. Like Biden, she is an establishment Democrat.
Funny how folks like you never said that about the even flimsier allegations The Intercept (and Intercept alone by the end) pushed about Biden.  How did Bernie Sanders, a good man, end up surrounding himself with the utter dregs of political organizing?
Fuck Joe Biden.
Biden is pro-life. He wears a mask.
When VP Harris said "open and... shut," Trump and Pence exhailed and buckled like they'd been kicked in the croch.  Biden/Harris 2020.
It's not about Kamala or Biden.ü§î It's about weeding out the people who are pretending to be on a certain agenda while literally on the other side. I would prefer facts rather than interpretations and whether any of her new work has progressed in a new direction.

Ambassador Rice makes a very cool point about people in Biden's camp: Fidelity. It is important They can be trusted.  This is an AWESOME clip.  Goes to respect for the candidate - and reflects the value of high quality people in management.  So cool....So Susan Rice.

why did you give Joe Biden better music than you? Also Trains are socialism.
Susan Rice is truly just a class act right now on Maddow. Speaking glowingly about Kamala and the thoroughness of the vetting process. 100% in a Biden / Harris administration if they win. My guess would be Secretary of State.
Do you consider "supporting Biden over Trump" involves calling everyone to Biden's left the equivalent of a Trump Nazi? Because insulting people for disagreeing with your candidate isnt providing support to your candidate

If Trump underwent a health evaluation, Biden must, too! He looks unhealthy and shows many signs of cognitive decline. His refusal proves he's hiding something!
Biden's pick was racist and sexist. Blindly caving to subjugated persons isn't the same as being free from prejudice, it's just reverse-prejudice.
By the way Chris Dodd (criminal who received kickbacks from Countrywide) is now a Sr. Advisor to Joe Biden...

Biden gives me hope bc no one is under the delusion that Biden is going to do anything substantial of his own volition but can be forced into things. His base is malleable. Trump's base is a death cult. Th solution is to work on multiple fronts at once; th streets &amp; th ballot box
Yeah, longtime centrist Joe Biden just screams "Sharia Law"
advice to Biden: "Pick someone who will help you win". Biden listened and did just that.
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event
Biden and Harris make 1st appearance as historic Democratic ticket
Right, abortion is 1 issue of thousands . He‚Äôs dead wrong on it. A lot of people are.  It sucks.  You can pretty much guarantee it won‚Äôt be a part of his speech and it certainly has no bearing on Biden‚Äôs platform.
Is the current gov terrible? Yes Will a Biden/Harris win make it less terrible? Eh, possibly. Politicians are human and I'm not putting all my "progressive" eggs in this election basket.
Neither. But no choice is a choice, I guess. Biden 2020.
Should we try to imagine what is going on in Biden‚Äôs head?
when they screech that known-quantity, staid, moderate Joe Biden, who's been a public figure for 4 decades, is part of a radical socialist plot to do ... anything, they sound ridiculous to most Americans.  Joe Biden is many things, but a socialist is not one of them.
Anyone besides me notice the huge difference between Biden/Harris and tRUMPs crowds? MASKS!! Really, we‚Äôre the smart party, it‚Äôs clear!!!üò∑
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
RIGHT NOW: Joe Biden and his VP pick Kamala Harris in their first joint appearance
SICK OF SCANDALS YET??!!!!!!!
Y‚Äôall steady dunkin on Shaun King for his Kamala flip flop (fuck Shaun King btw), instead of what Biden‚Äôs agenda is.  Here you go fyi -&gt;
Wait, Kamela Harris as VP AND 007? Kind of like Jack Ryan, only really cool? Would Biden be like hanging back in his shades saying, no, just wait a minute, Kam's got this. I am so up for this show.
Trump doesn't need me to attack Biden, Biden makes it perfectly easy for Trump all on his own.  Maybe you should give Biden more credit
Trump apparently knocked a million doors last week. Wouldn't put faith in polls too much cuz polls don't turnout voters and Biden being in the basement and inspiring no one makes him the default pick until Trump does something to actually help people (like unemployment benefits)
Streaming now: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris make their first joint appearance.
Watch #Live: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris set to make campaign debut in Delaware:
Select Biden and get his ass out
So many people I used to know and like, they‚Äôve all been saying they‚Äôre going to vote for Biden. And if that was not disappointing enough, they‚Äôre now shouting to the heavens with full throated rejoicing over the Kamala Harris pick. Seriously, I need to get new friends.
Would you like to speculate more about my emotions or continue accusing me of doing a fascism?  Every minute you spend talking to me instead of phonebanking for Joe Biden is a minute phonebanking for Donald Trump. I dont make the rules.
Obama and Biden took this economy out of FREEFALL and handed Trump &amp; GOPigs a THRIVING economy which Trump TRASHED out of sheer incompetence.  10 YEARS OF RECOVERY UNDER OBAMA &amp; BIDEN GONE!
Biden's worked on ALL of this before!  THE LAST GOPig that was in office crashed the economy too!
Biden's an old dealmaker with no convictions who could be convinced to delegate power to lefties to gain their support (similar to a parliamentary coalition system).   Harris will probably try to pack the team with loyalists and outmaneuver any actual leftists
the main takeaway for the Left from Biden's announcement is that any chance of pushing the ticket left is gone now that Harris is on board
So Kamala Harris And Joe Biden are more dangerous to black folks than Trump and Pence .   That‚Äôs what y‚Äôall tryna tell me . Okay cool .
if you're considering not voting, or voting for anyone other than Biden, read this response the President gave to a softball question from a friendly interviewer.  The man is NOT well.  If someone in your family spoke like this, you'd have hushed conversations about "what to do"
This is Biden‚Äôs VP, asking people to bail out those who looted, burned, and rioted in Minnesota! Great pick, Joe!
And the thing is - Biden already has. He has consistently been pivoting left throughout his career to remain the center of the Democratic Party itself. And will likely continue to do so. Also, historically, candidates who campaigned as moderates have had a higher success rate.Shows the priorities of the Dems. He rails on Joe Biden for clear corruption, blackmailing Ukraine millions to fire the prosecutor who was investigating his son. They lose their minds, call for impeachment, go into Russiagate hysterics.

Yes am all in on Sen. Harris because she is qualified  and of the many women Biden considered she is the only one I could imagine as President of in 4 years or 8.  She makes me feel optimistic.  It is a fleeting thought but she is the only one that prompts. All in for B/H
They have asked for those funds... 2 months ago when they passed the HEROS BILL YOU MORON! YOU ARE THE PROBLEM NOT THE SOLUTION.... BIDEN AND HARRIS ARE GOING TO STEP UP AND SHUT YOU DOWN... VOTE BLUE!

Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
maybe you missed the entire point of what you‚Äôre responding to, so i‚Äôll try again. it‚Äôs not that i ‚Äúlike‚Äù biden or think he‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than trump or the ‚Äúlesser evil‚Äù  this is it. the only way to save our democracy is to defeat trump. biden‚Äôs the opponent. that‚Äôs it.
Weird how they endorse Biden when they have no other choice. Who did they endorse in the primary? Oh, apparently the guy you think ruined their jobs
And I just gave the Biden/Harris campaign $50. All in.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
4 years of Biden doing absolutely nothing to slow or reverse the continuing rightward slide of America followed by an even more dimwitted populist ideologue, rinse, repeat, until we have moved so far right that Reagan and Thatcher's graves can be pissed on simultaneously
lol at these lunatics acting like Joe Biden is anything other than the most boring uninspiring centrist.
right now reporting on Trump pushing Barr to be the best AG ever if he does his bidding with Sen Johnson‚Äôs disinformation about Biden. Can you imagine that they are normalizing this? Done with them, the media really needs to step it up or we will end up like Belarus.
WTF thousands and thousands of countries,there is only 195 countries in the world. And Trump has the audacity to say Joe Biden is slow in his fake ads. lol
I would argue that genocidal dictators are not actually leftists because authoritarianism is a fascist ideology. That being said, for context, the person writing that tweet above was comparing being rude to a Biden canvasser to being an asshole in the alt-right lol
Why am I sad? Let me tell you!  NO excitement on Twitter for our AWESOME CANDIDATES: JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS!  NO EXCITEMENT from the  for our AWESOME CANDIDATES! Perez should resign!  NO EXCITEMENT from our DEMOCRATIC Congress!  LETS GET GOING. VOTE.
Biden should have paid another kid to repeat it for him.
One of my neighbors has a LGBTQ+ flag sandwiched by two Biden flags. Seeing less and less political signs, too obvious that it's a waste of resources and just adding to the trash heap.
I hope the answer is obvious.  You may not like Joe Biden.  But he won‚Äôt destroy this country.  It really is that simple.  A vote for Biden is a vote to save America.
Had anyone in the administration had it.. It could have saved America.     We'll just wait for Biden and Harris.   I read a new hashtag today.. #cousinfucker.
what are you even talking about?  I'm voting to get a fascist out of office before American democracy is extinguished.  the end.  this is an existential crisis for our country, and you're babbling about brunch.  so, yes, some of us didn't want Biden, but we're adults about it.
Biden‚Äôs been in office 50 years how is that new leadership
It took a worldwide pandemic, hundreds of thousands of deaths and massive unemployment to bring the economy back to the Obama /Biden HIGH mark üòÇ
you can't just waive at multiple people and say "they're all the same, all bad" and then when someone points out the very idea of degrees, say it's ridiculous.  on every issue you care about, Biden is better than Trump, but "they're all the same, all bad"

a vote for a 3P candidate is a vote the 3P candidate.  why is this hard to understand?    they aren't "Clinton's votes" unless they vote for Clinton.  full stop.  but i want to GET TRUMP OUT, not "elect Biden."  and the only vote that GETS TRUMP OUT is Biden.
Now that Wokeness has become profitable, they can ride economy surge under Trump while blaming him for the misogyny and bigotry of the Americans voting for Kamala who will likely step in for Biden. More of the same if she gets in. For the record, I'm not a Trumper by any measure
says the guy who won't cast a meaningful vote against Trump.  listen to yourself!  it's on Biden if you choose to vote for Mickey Mouse?
The kind gentle questioning of Harris and Biden, compare that to the Trump scrum that he does on a daily basis? Notice not screaming??
can you try for a minute looking at the situation a different way?    your vote belongs to no one but you.    but there is one candidate who is a significant danger to all of us, especially those already in need.  a vote for anyone but Biden does not help get rid of Trump.
I know...You're not gonna let Joe Biden cut America's meat!
"Biden voters mostly say they plan to cast their vote by mail, 62% to 36%.  Trump supporters, though, plan to physically go to the polls ‚Äî 72% to 24%."  Any surprise why Republicans want to kill USPS in a pandemic?   Fucking cowards.

Or I guess the correct thing to say would be from pat the berner "If sharing Biden &amp; Kamala's records helps Trump, then Biden &amp; Kamala's records help Trump."
lol Biden has done nothing in his 40 plus years... he won‚Äôt start now if he wins!
I'll stop now, but the idea that labor is "meh" on Biden is absurd.  You don't speak for the labor movement, it speaks for itself and enthusiastically endorses Joe Biden.
labor does support biden.  he has endorsements from the AFL‚ÄìCIO, Amalgamated Transit Union, American Federation of Government Employees, American Federation of Musicians, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, American Federation of Teachers  /1
I called it, hard to believe I was right. Only person we've seen try to lose this hard in our country was Trump 2016. Biden's not in this to win it, I'm pretty sure he's hoping this final spit on POC will get him safely back in his basement the next four years
I'm saying don't try to make *me* or *all democrats* responsible for some guy blocking you.  that's his decision, not mine, not Biden's, and not the Democratic party's.

is selling Biden masks for $20.00 each.... no wonder he wants them to be mandatory. üò∑
He's going to ask moderate Republicans and Republican leaning ind to vote for biden instead a 3rd party or staying home. Good enough for me. I also believe aoc should be given just as much if not more time as kasich
He's not the impeached, treasonous, utter moron who's squatting in the White House right now.  In reality, Mr. Biden has a laundry list of qualifications for this job, but at the end of the day he's the anti-Trump, and THAT is what is going to win him this election.
The world has been laughing, excluding, and moving on without the US with Treasonous Trump, the impeached idiot, squatting in the White House.   President Biden will restore dignity and respect to the US, and to his office.
you can't assume the "leading candidate" would otherwise get the votes the "spoiler" candidate gets. I for one would never vote for an imperialist hawk like Biden. you're wasting time berating people for their convictions that you don't even seem interested in understanding.
naomi lachance was texted by a Biden volunteer who said they were 12 when asked, and at 9am the next morning texted the kid "baby did i say something wrong" which is the most grooming-ass creepy shit to pull on a 12 year old, after asking them to explain rape the night before.
lmao they de-checkmarked the "journalist" who was creeping on the 12 year old Biden text volunteer
WATCH: Here's what  told  two weeks ago about being vetted by the Biden campaign.
Would it be best if those of us willing to vote for Biden stay out of this? I don't mean fail to strike--I'm asking if the voices leading this need to be a subset (people like you) or a coalition (people like me, center-right people like most of the Dem party, etc.)?
Electing them at all is the opposite of holding them accountable. Biden opposes busing and writes the crime bill and his reward is he gets to be president? Kamala uses her power to keep prisoners because they‚Äôre valuable labor and she gets to be VP?

If they were an adult then I legitimately don‚Äôt see what would be inappropriate about responding the way she did. If I was a victim of sexual assault I‚Äôd be pretty snappy too if someone tried to get me to make calls for Joe Biden.
Between Biden and Harris - will raise taxes, police are like the KKK, cops are the enemy, take away guns, open boarders and BOTH said Trumps economic policies would cripple America
I agree it‚Äôs their fault! I‚Äôm not trying to trap you into saying anything, as someone who wants trump out so badly that I‚Äôd settle for Biden even though I don‚Äôt agree with him on alot, and as a fellow progressive, I‚Äôm curious to understand your point of view.
According to the   had a "standout" interview with Biden's search team and left the team "dazzled."
It‚Äôs not bad faith! Like I supported Warren but when she dropped out,I supported Bernie bc he champions many of the same progressive causes that are important to me. I didn‚Äôt want Biden or any moderate, and I‚Äôm not thrilled about it but I sure as hell will vote for him over trump
Ok yay! I think you answered my question. Bernie is the only candidate you would support. It‚Äôs not just Biden, you wouldn‚Äôt have voted for anyone but Bernie, regardless of how closely policy aligns. Thank you!

The game plan is Biden steps down, Republicans make a stink about kamala not being constitutionally acceptable as president, she steps aside and the drunk Pelosi becomes president
Biden is racist Harris is fake the two of them are puppets of Pelosi I‚Äôm voting red in November
You mean the mfg jobs that Obama said were never coming back?  The ones that we lost due to NAFTA. Which Biden promoted
Someone needs to put out a challenge to post any Biden flags if they see them.
Great read. The final four in serious contention for the job were Harris, Rice, Warren and Whitmer.
It's either Carte Goodwin or Joe Biden, and I think it might be the latter.
If I had to show people two clips to sum up the 2020 primary, it would be this (ending the Bloomberg run), and the always awesome clip of  meeting Joe Biden in the NYT elevator.
Is that how you going to answer Biden during the debates ?  " Ahhhh...".   Lol
This does of course depend entirely on Biden diverging from the Obama Doctrine of "looking forward not backward"   i.e. overlooking the crimes of powerful people because they happened in the past, while overseeing the world's largest ever prison state for nonviolent offenders.
I guess at least if Biden is president he probably won't attempt to block  from delivering ballots in an effort to steal an election
And the sad thing is that you would hesitate to vote for Biden.

It‚Äôs very close, on financial issues and domestic health, Biden is further right, but Boris worse on immigration. They are about the same on energy and foreign policy I feel.
Then why are you demanding loyalty and a vote rather than fighting for better policies. Biden‚Äôs still hasn‚Äôt been named as the nominee till the convention. Why would you stop making demands? Especially now? It‚Äôs a pandemic depression. Millions are losing their healthcare

One might think that political reporters for the  *might* be interested in questions like whether or not Harris still thinks Joe Biden is a serial sexual harasser, or an old school busing bigot, or even ask about her recent, awkward looking plastic surgery.  Nope.
If Trump wins, then it‚Äôs four years of the liberal blame game.   If Biden wins, I can guarantee it‚Äôs four years of liberal complacency.
But that means not voting for Trump IS a vote for Biden. Man what a paradox...

160,000 dead Americans didn‚Äôt change Trump‚Äôs popularity. Remember that as you read coverage about the election and whether Biden‚Äôs message is working or whatever armchair campaign quarterbacking narrative gets a lot of play. Most votes are just not up for grabs.

#KamalaHarris was a bad choice for VP but a worse choice was #Biden for president is pretty much the vibe I'm getting
They got me with Bass because that suggestion came out of the left of the party. But Rice only makes sense if you think like a DC insider (imo): technocratic liberal with no domestic policy chops who will never overshadow Biden. In a way, it seems perfect for his low-key strat.
Rice made no sense to us in the electorate, but she made sense to people who think Biden only wants to replicate 2009-2017. And the GOP thinks Dems are arrogant enough to just ignore Benghazi (which while stupid was in fact a big-ish deal).
For the first time in history, I think a headfake worked. I am utterly convinced Rice was a fake-out designed to get the GOP ready to re-litigate Benghazi, and the media bought into the fake for precisely the amount of time Biden needed them to for it to penetrate GOP circles.
apparently each hateful idiot in America is going to require an immediate family member to go on a ventilator ... and then they‚Äôll potentially be open to denying this is a different way, perhaps something involving Biden or maybe child abduction.
I'm not one to defend pundits, but they may mean safe as far as ideology. She is far less radical than some of the other contenders. Like Biden, she is an establishment Democrat.
Funny how folks like you never said that about the even flimsier allegations The Intercept (and Intercept alone by the end) pushed about Biden.  How did Bernie Sanders, a good man, end up surrounding himself with the utter dregs of political organizing?
Fuck Joe Biden.
Biden is pro-life. He wears a mask.
When VP Harris said "open and... shut," Trump and Pence exhailed and buckled like they'd been kicked in the croch.  Biden/Harris 2020.
I don't trust mail in ballots with what's going on. I'm going to wear my mask, social distance, and proudly go vote for Biden /Harris. If rather risk going than to not have my vote count. I fucking hate this Administration. Pure corruption.
It's not about Kamala or Biden.ü§î It's about weeding out the people who are pretending to be on a certain agenda while literally on the other side. I would prefer facts rather than interpretations and whether any of her new work has progressed in a new direction.
Biden picks a San Francisco Dem loved by big tech.  And Cicilline wants to blow smoke?   And Nesi is rolling them apparently
What‚Äôs the over/under of Biden doing an interview with Chris Wallace?  I‚Äôll take the over
When will Biden sit for an interview?
It brings you to Joe
Ambassador Rice makes a very cool point about people in Biden's camp: Fidelity. It is important They can be trusted.  This is an AWESOME clip.  Goes to respect for the candidate - and reflects the value of high quality people in management.  So cool....So Susan Rice.
If Joe Biden is inaugurated and the Senate flips I‚Äôll have the emotional bandwidth to contemplate the whole Virtual Youtuber thing. Until then I‚Äôm going for pure Patrick O‚ÄôBrian mode where I don‚Äôt know whether computers exist and only know about frigates, sloops, staysails etc
Is Biden my first choice? No of course not. But am I gonna vote for someone who literally said they would date their own daughter? ABSOLUTELY THE FUCK NOT.
why did you give Joe Biden better music than you? Also Trains are socialism.
Susan Rice is truly just a class act right now on Maddow. Speaking glowingly about Kamala and the thoroughness of the vetting process. 100% in a Biden / Harris administration if they win. My guess would be Secretary of State.
Do you consider "supporting Biden over Trump" involves calling everyone to Biden's left the equivalent of a Trump Nazi? Because insulting people for disagreeing with your candidate isnt providing support to your candidate
(Before anyone misinterprets me I‚Äôm not encouraging you to not vote for Biden. What I am saying is that in this case the lesser evil will still lead to the literal end of the world unless we all start acting like climate change is the colossal and immediate threat that it is.)
Joe Biden make your campaign song "Is This Thing On?" by the Promise Ring challenge
If y‚Äôall really think Biden worse than trump y‚Äôall got another thing coming lol, they both trash but for sure one if worse than the other
If Trump underwent a health evaluation, Biden must, too! He looks unhealthy and shows many signs of cognitive decline. His refusal proves he's hiding something!
Biden's pick was racist and sexist. Blindly caving to subjugated persons isn't the same as being free from prejudice, it's just reverse-prejudice.
By the way Chris Dodd (criminal who received kickbacks from Countrywide) is now a Sr. Advisor to Joe Biden...
He's too dumb to hurt Biden.
The condescension when she talks about crime, as if criminal reform activists want to stop violent criminals from going to jail. This is the vp I have to vote for, on top of Biden for president. This is my nightmare ticket.
I‚Äôd glad backtrack if his entire speech is pro-life propaganda but I have a funny feeling that the topic won‚Äôt come up beyond maybe some vague allusion to ‚Äúnot agreeing with Biden on everything but Trump needs to be removed‚Äù type point.
Biden might have that inclination because isn‚Äôt he basically asking that of us, too? I‚Äôm still working on letting go of how he treated Anita Hill.
Biden might have that inclination because isn‚Äôt he asking that of us, too? I‚Äôm still working on letting go of how he treated Anita Hill.
They've been telling us that since the most recent primary rigging. I mean, Biden himself has explicitly told me on several occasions not to vote for him.
I cant believe ya let Biden beat my boy Bernie sanders. Bernie could beat trump. Smh. Fuck this election ü§£ü§£ü§£ #BernieSanders2020 üëåüôèüèºüôèüèº
What is up with that? Tyt is supporting Biden! They are rats thoughüôâüôâüôâ
My first book was on the politics of the Social Security Trust Fund. I may need to write a new edition that discusses President Trump's pledge to terminate the payroll tax--and how he gave an unexpected political gift to Joe Biden. 1/2
I live on Massachusetts and in the last week, I have witnessed 2 Trump rallies on street corners...I haven't even seen a Biden yard sign...that has to say something(not that Mass will go republican, but there is a deep groundswell of Trump support)
Joe Biden didn't screw up his words and to me that says all of his video flubs have been faked because he intended to claim Dementia as a defense when he is prosecuted. His Dementia is fake. As far as Harris, she's trash.
Biden didn't singlehandedly bring Healthcare to a generation of Black children in the South the way Clinton did (CHIP). So I very much buy this.
Trump is accused of 26 rapes and sexual assaults. And trump is still a legit racist. Biden was misguided by the tough on crime bullshit but he's capable of change and growth. Learned from his mistakes. Trump was is and will always be racist.
I‚Äôm willing to defend Kamala against any and all sexist, racist, mysogonist bullshit. She should be ambitious. She should show no remorse for calling out Biden‚Äôs racist political history  But I‚Äôll also call out her disgusting prosecurorial record. Her hypocrisy and opportunism...
What evidence do you have of Trump that you don‚Äôt have of Biden?
Except a communist would advocate for the end of the state and communal living. Biden is literally a corpratist and centrist. Y'all just call anyone left of center a communist
The entire Biden Campaign would be burning to the ground right now if he made the wrong choice, omg.
Joe Biden announces since the announcement of Kamala Harris as VP, the campaign raised $26 million including 150,000 first time donors.
Seriously this is one of the things I respect most about  Trump's narcissism demands absolute loyalty - Biden decided that someone who challenged him was best suited for the job. #BidenHarris
It‚Äôs hard for me to watch Biden. I‚Äôm holding my breath the entire time.
It's more like you don't get to rally around Defund / Abolish Police only to support Biden and Harris considering who the fuck they are.
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event
You seem to have entirely different criticisms for the left than Joe Biden when we call for wildly popular and *practical* policies, but Joe claims hes gonna cure a collection of loosely connected diseases that have eluded scientists for centuries.
Biden gives me hope bc no one is under the delusion that Biden is going to do anything substantial of his own volition but can be forced into things. His base is malleable. Trump's base is a death cult. Th solution is to work on multiple fronts at once; th streets &amp; th ballot box
Yeah, longtime centrist Joe Biden just screams "Sharia Law"
advice to Biden: "Pick someone who will help you win". Biden listened and did just that.
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event
Biden and Harris make 1st appearance as historic Democratic ticket
Right, abortion is 1 issue of thousands . He‚Äôs dead wrong on it. A lot of people are.  It sucks.  You can pretty much guarantee it won‚Äôt be a part of his speech and it certainly has no bearing on Biden‚Äôs platform.
Where do liars go bishop? Biden is a devout catholic.
do you still believe Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers and still think he‚Äôs a racist??? Just wondering
Is the current gov terrible? Yes Will a Biden/Harris win make it less terrible? Eh, possibly. Politicians are human and I'm not putting all my "progressive" eggs in this election basket.
Neither. But no choice is a choice, I guess. Biden 2020.
Should we try to imagine what is going on in Biden‚Äôs head?
when they screech that known-quantity, staid, moderate Joe Biden, who's been a public figure for 4 decades, is part of a radical socialist plot to do ... anything, they sound ridiculous to most Americans.  Joe Biden is many things, but a socialist is not one of them.
Anyone besides me notice the huge difference between Biden/Harris and tRUMPs crowds? MASKS!! Really, we‚Äôre the smart party, it‚Äôs clear!!!üò∑
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
RIGHT NOW: Joe Biden and his VP pick Kamala Harris in their first joint appearance
SICK OF SCANDALS YET??!!!!!!!
Y‚Äôall steady dunkin on Shaun King for his Kamala flip flop (fuck Shaun King btw), instead of what Biden‚Äôs agenda is.  Here you go fyi -&gt;
Wait, Kamela Harris as VP AND 007? Kind of like Jack Ryan, only really cool? Would Biden be like hanging back in his shades saying, no, just wait a minute, Kam's got this. I am so up for this show.
Trump doesn't need me to attack Biden, Biden makes it perfectly easy for Trump all on his own.  Maybe you should give Biden more credit
Biden's choice was not about choosing to make the right candidate, but is about  making history by having a female VP. the dnc are repeating the same mistakes like they did trying to make Hillary  president...it backfired.
Trump apparently knocked a million doors last week. Wouldn't put faith in polls too much cuz polls don't turnout voters and Biden being in the basement and inspiring no one makes him the default pick until Trump does something to actually help people (like unemployment benefits)
Streaming now: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris make their first joint appearance.
Watch #Live: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris set to make campaign debut in Delaware:
Select Biden and get his ass out
So many people I used to know and like, they‚Äôve all been saying they‚Äôre going to vote for Biden. And if that was not disappointing enough, they‚Äôre now shouting to the heavens with full throated rejoicing over the Kamala Harris pick. Seriously, I need to get new friends.
Would you like to speculate more about my emotions or continue accusing me of doing a fascism?  Every minute you spend talking to me instead of phonebanking for Joe Biden is a minute phonebanking for Donald Trump. I dont make the rules.
Obama and Biden took this economy out of FREEFALL and handed Trump &amp; GOPigs a THRIVING economy which Trump TRASHED out of sheer incompetence.  10 YEARS OF RECOVERY UNDER OBAMA &amp; BIDEN GONE!
Biden's worked on ALL of this before!  THE LAST GOPig that was in office crashed the economy too!
Biden's an old dealmaker with no convictions who could be convinced to delegate power to lefties to gain their support (similar to a parliamentary coalition system).   Harris will probably try to pack the team with loyalists and outmaneuver any actual leftists
the main takeaway for the Left from Biden's announcement is that any chance of pushing the ticket left is gone now that Harris is on board
So Kamala Harris And Joe Biden are more dangerous to black folks than Trump and Pence .   That‚Äôs what y‚Äôall tryna tell me . Okay cool .
if you're considering not voting, or voting for anyone other than Biden, read this response the President gave to a softball question from a friendly interviewer.  The man is NOT well.  If someone in your family spoke like this, you'd have hushed conversations about "what to do"
This is Biden‚Äôs VP, asking people to bail out those who looted, burned, and rioted in Minnesota! Great pick, Joe!
And the thing is - Biden already has. He has consistently been pivoting left throughout his career to remain the center of the Democratic Party itself. And will likely continue to do so. Also, historically, candidates who campaigned as moderates have had a higher success rate.
That Biden-Bass alliteration would‚Äôve really hit
Free ponies for all!!! Screw Trump! Smell kids hair Biden!
Joe Biden is so slow and confused, if he‚Äôd been alive in 1917, he would‚Äôve delayed the pandemic to 1918, and world war 2 never would‚Äôve ended.
I believe Biden is a catholic. I‚Äôm not sure where he got his facts from.  is a sad horrible human being with no regard for humans.
They're not going to be like the Benghazi committee. I think Biden w/b best to appoint a special commission like after 9/11.
Mindy Kaling is 'filled with hope' over Kamala Harris becoming Joe Biden's running mate  via
How do you feel about all the black peoples that have been locked up due to the 1994 crime bill that Joe Biden drafted?
Mr. Biden We want Bernie and Yang also by your side!
As for progressives, I think most will get on board and vote for Biden and against Trump, but there will be an energy/ enthusiasm gap particularly among young people who are currently so energized in the policing/ race social movement and who are way to the left of Biden/Harris.
I would think that many voters will see through Trump's attempt to smear Biden/ Harris as socialist anarchist radicals, but on the other hand for many on the right Dems in general represent these things. Nevertheless, its an odd choice of messaging for these specific individuals.
Biden Really "has his finger on the pulse of the nation" right? Lol clown vs clown in 2020. I can't believe I used to respect him
The way I‚Äôve been feeling lately Kamala could stand in the middle of 5th Ave, shoot somebody and I‚Äôd still be happy to vote Team Biden/Harris.
Dude you got your Biden/Harris ticket, they're literally conservative carceral Democrats
It fits both republican and democrat narrative because if Biden/Harris find a way to fuck this up then democrats can blame it on a radical left platform and pull even harder right next time
Keen observers point out unusual elements of Biden‚Äôs Instagram post with Harris
Biden and Harris are complicit. That will always matter, and will not always simplistically answer every choice.
There are ways in which voting for someone like Biden is mutually exclusive with progressive causes. A completely black-and-white, facile application of that fact to everything in all cases doesn't make sense. It's not right.
Personally, I'm not a "change from within" person. I have voted for non-establishment and third party candidates many times, including in presidential primaries and elections. I'm going to vote for Biden AND continue to advocate for the creation of a truly progressive party.
When I was supporting Elizabeth Warren, a lot of Kamala Harris supporters blocked me for refuting bad faith arguments against her. Now I'm supporting the Biden/Harris ticket and expect the same from Warren supporters.  We can support women without pitting them against each other.
Biden and Harris aren't the only ones who win. They don't get appointed to the Supreme Court, where they can defend marginalized people. A judge does. Obama wasn't all that progressive, and we still made him help with the supreme Court and trans issues.
It absolutely is a literal threat. I'm voting for Biden because I'm threatened. More importantly I'm voting for Biden because of who else is threatened. A lot more Black and Brown people are going to die in 2021 if a federally coordinated response is not put in place.
Biden gives Trump a gift: All of Kamala's baggage
trust me I know biden and trump both are terrible candidates too, but shit i‚Äôd rather have a qualified mf in the office then ye, all respect to ye but homie just ain‚Äôt it
They want him to siphon votes from Biden and he's going to siphon votes from Trump!ü§£
Read this re: Biden/Harris - It‚Äôs not exactly how I feel but it‚Äôs pretty close:
Can‚Äôt wait let‚Äôs go Biden Harris 2020
Dear Bishop Tobin: I have been a professor at a Catholic college in your diocese for 25 years. I am not Catholic (I'm Episcopalian), but have dozens of close Catholic friends who also are not Catholic if Joe Biden isn't. You are litmus-testing your flock into non-existence.
Is there some mistake? Joe Biden is a baptized Roman Catholic.
You all call Donald Trump a fascist (he is!) but I just saw someone tweet that anyone who criticizes the Biden/Harris ticket is responsible for Trump getting elected again and folks, that‚Äôs fascism too. This is a democracy. Hold them all accountable.
Such a head spinner to get an email from the Trump campaign referring to Biden and Harris as "two of our nation's most RADICAL democrats who LOVE anarchy" while progressives on Twitter lament that once again Dems have left behind the left base of the party.
i‚Äôll say this once. if you vote for biden/kamala and your reaction is anything but this, you need to reevaluate yourself, ESPECIALLY if you‚Äôre a white liberal.  if you vote for them as a ‚Äúneccesary evil,‚Äù i get it. but the same ACAB libs somehow ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù this combo... man.
(3/3) vote.‚Äù We need to get rid of the electoral college, we need ranked voting, we need valid third party candidates but right now we‚Äôre stuck working within this shit institution. I‚Äôll vote for Biden and Copmala but I can‚Äôt fault anyone who decides they can‚Äôt.
I'd put my money on Pompeo  Biden won't win, the polls are very clear on this
BIDEN ALWAYS RUN BY CLINTON CARTEL CRIMINALS
If it looks like a windmill and sounds like a windmill ... it‚Äôs a WIND TURBINE... hey Trump just grab ‚Äòem by the windmills...
It's amazing to me how the MSM has given Kushner and Ivanka a giant pass from all vetting and criticism. Guess it only counts if your name is Clinton or Biden or you have a (D)  after your name.
First Was Gerradine Ferraro Than Sarah Palin Now Kamala Harris &amp; Unlike The First Two This Time I Was Born I Can Vote &amp; I Will Vote for Joe Biden &amp; Jamaal Harris In November 3rd 2020 For Everybody Including Me Needs A Return To Normalcy!!! #WeWillVote

There is no way Biden is going to win with this level of fear and stupidity from Republican voters.

I've seen a few Right Wing Authoritarian-minded so-called Catholic talking heads make despairing remarks RE Biden's Catholicism. Biden must have poll tested well with center &amp; right-leaning Catholics, so the puppets are out &amp; about trying to neutralize that. So gross.
Providence Bishop Tobin disparages Biden‚Äôs Catholic faith in tweet  via
She wasn‚Äôt VP pick, but Elizabeth Warren could be a key player in a Biden administration  via
wait... but i thought you said Joe Biden was the racist?? ü§îü§îü§îü§î
It's more than mere disparagement: Biden is a devout Catholic, was married twice in Catholic ceremonies, and regularly attends Mass. He was banned from Communion in some dioceses because of his pro-choice and pro-LGBTQ politics.
Iran‚Äôs government has attacked  Saudi Arabia on their soil... shot rockets at us soldiers... funds PIJ, Hezbollah and many Iraqi militant groups.   And Biden is okay with that?  That is nuts.
Biden doesn‚Äôt want to invade Iran, which is great cause we don‚Äôt need it.  But he also opposes regime change, which is catastrophic for the population of Iran, who have killed thousands of protestors. Not that Americans care about the Iranian people though. üôÑü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
How many did KAMALA HARRIS get in her Failed Prezidential run....lolol....but Biden still pocked her
The real issue is that Biden is a devout Catholic, was married twice in Catholic ceremonies, and attends Mass regularly, but has been barred in some dioceses from Communion because of his pro-choice politics.

Suburban housewife here ‚úäüèª - will be voting for Biden/Harris. Thanks!
Did you see Biden riding a bike the other day and cracking jokes while doing so? Seems pretty sharp to me! Thoughts?
First thing I saw this morning, Trump calling NBA players very stupid. Then I saw he posted about Biden freeing black prisoners. Now this. But he‚Äôs the least racist. Ignorant and hateful.
Trump was gonna do this no matter who he picked. That said, I feel like the biggest issue with Harris is that the left sees her as a moderate and the center sees her as a leftist. Biden's bet is that she'll appeal to the non-ideological/non-"very online" people
There was no one Biden could pick to satisfy the left. Even if he'd picked Warren Progressives would have just called her a sellout.
why do ppl think this is true. so many liberal talking points are about "kids in cages." the biden admin would do something about that for optics, probably, but then they'd keep ice, keep family separation, keep juvenile detention.
This choice shows Biden is not listening. There were other options, Barbara Lee, Ayanna Pressley, Nina Turner to name a few. It is a tone def choice.
"THOU SHALT NOT LIE"  Joe Biden is a Catholic.
Bishop falsely claims Joe Biden is not a Catholic ‚Äî and it doesn‚Äôt go well for him
Biden is a Catholic.  What PLANET are you on, man?  You disgrace Rhode Island and the Church. It is not the first time.
This is a talking point from obscure right wing authoritarian (RWA) minded so-called Catholics: to deny Biden's affiliation to his avowed spiritual practice. Biden must've poll tested well w/ moderate &amp; right-leaning Catholics so RWA talking heads are trying to neutralize that
I agree Kamala is better than Kaine, but Biden is worse than Hillary.  In combination the excitement or lack there of for Hillary/Kaine and Biden/Kamala are about the same.   You‚Äôre in swing state, let me know in a few weeks what it feels like there for Biden/Kamala.
I‚Äôm glad someone said it Lmfaoo were going to ignore the fact that Biden‚Äôs mental health is non-existent??
Horrible pick. Probably the worst choice Biden could have made. He could have chosen Tulsi.
I'm not a fan of either Biden or Kamala... but we CANNOT see another FOUR YEARS in trump America ... there is not third party. Please please pleaseeeeeee vote come November
Corey Booker... is he one of the missing Coreys? Like Corey Feldman, or Corey Haim?   BTW: My wife is a suburban housewife now. She's voting for Biden and Harris, and totally excited. Sorry Donnie!
Joe Biden is a Roman Catholic. Tim Kaine is Catholic, and was on the last D ticket. Is he thinking Anglican Catholic? That's a pretty specific requirement.
Obvi is a joke, but to say Biden is some kind of champion of black folks is also a joke.
Which one? Biden or Trump? I think both will do that just fine lol.
I hope you don‚Äôt think that the liberals are going to achieve that for you.....You have know clue what you are in for if Biden gets in
I‚Äôm a suburban woman, I live in Bucks County, PA and guess what I‚Äôm voting for Biden! The homes here have Biden signs on their lawns. We are going blue!
You all know Joe Biden DID NOT PICK his running mate. When is anyone going to put this out in the conservative media???????
I believe the term that fits here is fake news.  Joe Biden is Catholic, and a better Christian than you.  What‚Äôs that phrase about he who is without sin?
It‚Äôs going to be fun to watch  kick  ‚Äòs ass in the debates. In fact, here‚Äôs a fun thought: why doesn‚Äôt Trump/Pence debate Biden/Harris in a Fourth Presidential Debate? Nah, it won‚Äôt happen, you‚Äôre all talk/no walk.
I was wondering when the next time you would gain traction for something so blatantly ignorant would be. I‚Äôm not sure about Kamala Harris, but Joe Biden is Catholic (not that this should impact who you vote for in any significant way).
He pretty much has. This "suburban housewife" will be voting for Biden.
My block button is getting swole today.  It's simple: at this point you're either Biden/Harris or QAnon-Covid/Fascist. We don't have any time for the latter.  If you don't like the ticket, shut your fucking cake hole and find a downticket candidate to promote.
I know LinkedIn is referencing two different things here. But come on they must know they‚Äôre taking shots at biden
And here I was figuring the same racist and sexist strategy with the Biden pick of the Indian Jamaican.
Just wondering if you're gonna be more upset that Biden is prochoice now or that Tobin enabled child rape?
Very excited that  is Biden‚Äôs running mate. I was a little upset she had to drop out due to financial reasons as that should never be the cause to end a promising campaign. Glad to see her back #BidenHarris

I don't think the church supports late term abortions these days Fr. Biden is an empty vessel I also don't think the church decides anything by the color of someone's skin, content of character is much more in line.
Good morning!  83 days until we elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris!  And what a great day today would be to arrest Jonathan Mattingly, Brett Hankison, Myles Cosgrove; the cops who murdered Breonna Taylor.  #BidenHarris2020  #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor
Y'all psychotic. How is having a military budget twice as large as he went in decreasing the size of the gov? Y'all afraid they're actually gonna reduce the size of it like when Obama and Biden slowly cut the military budget.
5 Takeaways On The New Biden-Harris Presidential Ticket
she is sharpening her bullet points right now..ooh its gonna be brutal...she takes no prisoners. look what she did to biden....former prosecuter vs church mouse. Trump cant keep him now.
The degree by which Tobin admited to letting abuse happen versus this is extremely nuanced and different. Apples to oranges. Joe Biden has a personal space problem regardless of a person's age or gender. He also touches men weirdly. He needs an HR class. Tobin needs prison
As a white male septuagenarian, I ENTHUSIASTICALLY endorse the Biden/Harris ticket. Awesome choice for running mate,   you will be a tremendous VP. We must defeat #notmypresident trump. We must save our democracy, save Social Security, Medicare, Obamacare.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden and Harris obviously but it‚Äôs crazy for me to look at all these blue check marks who absolutely Shat on Biden and Harris both suddenly talking about them like the greatest thing ever. Tons of instances of this, that‚Äôs politics for you though
Trump, Biden when Connecticut primaries
She wasn't my first choice but she'll be fine. I hope Biden sets her the immediate task of organizing the #TrumpFamilyCrimesCommission, it's going to be a huge job.
Lmao if they excommunicated Catholics who are pro choice they'd lose half the followers they still have. Biden goes to church. But he doesn't bring his faith into law. That's the whole point of sep of church and state.
Biden goes to church? I think you're talking about trump.
Ever notice that Trump's campaign ads always feature Biden and now Harris?  Yet, Biden talks only about solutions and bringing the country together. Never mentions the Clown in the White House.... CLASS ACT #BidenHarris2020
MORE votes for Biden. Harris! Trump keeps hitting,his own voter groups!
Aww, I guess the wall between Church and State will be built back up when Biden &amp; Harris are in office.  The Roman Catholic Church had lost all credibility, and the ability to condemn others.  You should all be painted as child molesters &amp; rapists.  Even if that ‚Äúisn‚Äôt your job‚Äù.
Good.  FAR better than a bought &amp; paid-for ‚ÄúPresident*‚Äù, and his smarmy fake religious sidekick.  Biden and Harris will clean up the mess we‚Äôre in, and get us back on track.  Hopefully, no Republican will EVER be President again.  The GOP will NEVER remove the stench of Trump.
CELEBRATING MY OWN-SEH GEH...  DEMOCRATIC VP CANDIDATE SELECT...  KAMALA HARRIS!  I HAD YOUR BACK FOR VP WHEN OTHERS WERE STILL CONFUSED ABOUT JOE BIDEN BEING....  "DAH REAL MAN FOR DA JOB!"
1. Most voters and a majority of Americans are further left than the Dem establishment.  2. If abstaining is a vote for trump it‚Äôs also a vote for Biden.  3. The long game is no longer voting for the lesser of two evils. Let the two Wall Street parties go extinct
Don‚Äôt worry he‚Äôs not voting for Trump. So he‚Äôs literally giving votes away to Biden.   See how that works?
Under Joe Biden‚Äôs bold new Molloycare for All plan, citizens will be able to get comprehensive medical care simply by tapping on their mothers‚Äô head four times.
Hunter Biden got $450,00 DC tax lien 'resolved' within days: report

"She ain't black" said Joe Biden.
Joe Biden is Catholic. But hey, what are facts now a days anyways?
Biden is in a state of grave public sin and he‚Äôs unrepentant. I encourage you to ask him to repent as well. We want to be consistent don‚Äôt we?
I'm actually not mad about Kamala cuz after Biden it didn't matter to me
Biden/Harris - let‚Äôs make this happen- please Jesus.They have asked for those funds... 2 months ago when they passed the HEROS BILL YOU MORON! YOU ARE THE PROBLEM NOT THE SOLUTION.... BIDEN AND HARRIS ARE GOING TO STEP UP AND SHUT YOU DOWN... VOTE BLUE!
81 days and we can say goodbye to the national nightmare we call Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris. #Trump2020
I‚Äôm sure Obama/Biden had no knowledge of this????
Why am I sad? Let me tell you!  NO excitement on Twitter for our AWESOME CANDIDATES: JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS!  NO EXCITEMENT from the  for our AWESOME CANDIDATES! Perez should resign!  NO EXCITEMENT from our DEMOCRATIC Congress!  LETS GET GOING. VOTE.

It‚Äôs actually a gift for Biden, as more women insults from the morally bankrupt one are on the way!
It scares me to death that Biden/Harris could be put into the office of the highest office in the land. IF it happens, prepare for the worse...........
If Biden is elected I bet Hydracloraquin will be acceptable for use.

Why he said it would take months, if ever, to count votes!  He is DETERMINED not to leave the Whitehouse. We need a landslide for BIDEN!   VOTE!  ENOUGH votes WILL be counted to WIN! DON'T STAY HOME!
Would it be best if those of us willing to vote for Biden stay out of this? I don't mean fail to strike--I'm asking if the voices leading this need to be a subset (people like you) or a coalition (people like me, center-right people like most of the Dem party, etc.)?
Between Biden and Harris - will raise taxes, police are like the KKK, cops are the enemy, take away guns, open boarders and BOTH said Trumps economic policies would cripple America
Let‚Äôs recap the desperate lies we‚Äôve heard from Trump/Pence so far. They‚Äôve claimed a Biden/Harris administration will mean: ‚ÄîNo more cows ‚ÄîNo more meat ‚ÄîNo more hamburgers ‚ÄîNo more 2nd Amendment ‚ÄîNo more guns ‚ÄîTrillions in taxes on the middle class
Biden is racist Harris is fake the two of them are puppets of Pelosi I‚Äôm voting red in November
. had a ‚Äústandout interview‚Äù and ‚Äúleft the search committee dazzled‚Äù but had a ‚Äúlimited national profile and adversarial relationship with influential labor unions.‚Äù ‚Äî Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries
But Biden said today that "Trump Coddled Terrorist" lol.
He's too busy doing Putin's bidding to smear Biden to undertake necessary work.
Biden/CNN and Trump/FOX NEWS. What else is new.
I'm getting a kick out of everyone that lambasted Ted Cruz for backing Trump after he got eviscerated by him during the debates only to go "YAAAASSS" at Biden picking the woman who called him a racist and said she believed the women that accused him of misconduct.
Not when Joe Biden is president The world is already laughing at us because of you because of your ignorance and stupidity world leaders laughing at us you‚Äôre worried about UAE  we have lines of Americans trying to get a box of food you are the worst president ever
BIDEN BEEN TAKING CASH DONATIONS FROM SEX AND DRUG TRAFFICKING CRIMINALS SINCE PABLO ESCOBAR
BIDEN BEEN TAKING CASH DONATIONS FROM SEX AND DRUG TRAFFICKING CRIMINALS SINCE PABLO ESCOBAR WAS THE CARTEL LEADERüëøüëøüëø
So I can assume you are voting for Biden/Harris then  since you are apparently so against nepotism?  Or is nepotism ok only if rich white people do it?
BIDEN IS A CLINTON CARTEL CRIMINAL. ALL DEMORATS ALWAYS ABOVE ALL USA LAW'S.
Maybe Biden should get behind the People.
He‚Äôd run circles around Trump or Biden
Yeah, Right.  I mean Obama/Biden brokered a peace agreement with them too...  Oh no, that's right, they destabilized Libya &amp; Syria instead, causing 600,000-1,000,000 dead.
Adding the extra ‚Äúa‚Äù made me give Biden a Super Mario voice in my head. ‚ÄúWe are not a dictators‚Äù
Jill Biden should be charged with elderly abuse for allowing this to happen.
If Trump wins, then it‚Äôs four years of the liberal blame game.   If Biden wins, I can guarantee it‚Äôs four years of liberal complacency.
Only 82 days left for the ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote/if you don‚Äôt vote Biden, you‚Äôre voting for trump‚Äù folks
Yup. If it‚Äôs close he‚Äôs gonna demand six recounts, if Biden thwomps him, he‚Äôs gonna cry fraud.
Pelosi Schumer Schiff Nadler Biden probably hold the world record for the longest time on public assistance. The have been living high on the hog at the taxpayers expense for far too long. It‚Äôs time we found genuine people that love America to represent us.
46 days ago,  nearly choked up on the debate stage, attacking  for his racist policies ‚Äî noting the personal impact they had on her childhood.  But the door to power swung open, and Biden‚Äôs racist actions were thrown out the window...  WAKE UP AMERICA‚ÄºÔ∏è
I actually liked Biden‚Äôs speech yesterday for a change
Biden/Harris 2020: Let's Get to Work  Trump/Pence 2020: My Hair's Shiny
They MUST debate! Biden can show just how STUPID donald is!
Mark your calendar!   You going? Your home state is hosting. Lots of republicans there serving in congress. You all screwed up. Biden and Harris are who WE AREüá∫üá∏
I think many, if not all of the women, will be in Biden's cabinet
I don't trust mail in ballots with what's going on. I'm going to wear my mask, social distance, and proudly go vote for Biden /Harris. If rather risk going than to not have my vote count. I fucking hate this Administration. Pure corruption.
Is Biden my first choice? No of course not. But am I gonna vote for someone who literally said they would date their own daughter? ABSOLUTELY THE FUCK NOT.
I did my best to defend Joe Biden‚Äôs Catholic faith today. But the real proof is Joe Biden himself and his life.
I love  he is a wonderful man.... I still remember watching President Obama award him the metal of freedom with tear running down my face ..... Biden/Harris = Hope that we will remember who we are #VOTE
What is up with that? Tyt is supporting Biden! They are rats thoughüôâüôâüôâ
Kamala and Biden: we ain‚Äôt hidin‚Äô!  Biden and Kamala: make you wanna holla!  Pence and Trump: for when you can‚Äôt take a dump.  Trump and Pence: like getting your dick hurt climbing over a barbwire fence.
It's more like you don't get to rally around Defund / Abolish Police only to support Biden and Harris considering who the fuck they are.
do you still believe Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers and still think he‚Äôs a racist??? Just wondering
I dont even like Kamala and Biden like that but to hear politicans get up onstage and speak in complwte sentences and not attack reporters and minorities is striking
Biden's choice was not about choosing to make the right candidate, but is about  making history by having a female VP. the dnc are repeating the same mistakes like they did trying to make Hillary  president...it backfired.
I live in New England - the whole region is navy blue and voting for Biden - I guess I‚Äôm insulated.
Back to the start - my husband worked for (Sen.) Biden for a few years before med school - found Joe Biden to be one of the most sincere and thoughtful persons to grace the chambers - loved by both Reps and Dems to this day. His faith is strong and evident. Say what u will.
Joe Biden is so slow and confused, if he‚Äôd been alive in 1917, he would‚Äôve delayed the pandemic to 1918, and world war 2 never would‚Äôve ended.
I believe Biden is a catholic. I‚Äôm not sure where he got his facts from.  is a sad horrible human being with no regard for humans.
Mr. Biden We want Bernie and Yang also by your side!
It fits both republican and democrat narrative because if Biden/Harris find a way to fuck this up then democrats can blame it on a radical left platform and pull even harder right next time
Biden and Harris are complicit. That will always matter, and will not always simplistically answer every choice.
There are ways in which voting for someone like Biden is mutually exclusive with progressive causes. A completely black-and-white, facile application of that fact to everything in all cases doesn't make sense. It's not right.
Personally, I'm not a "change from within" person. I have voted for non-establishment and third party candidates many times, including in presidential primaries and elections. I'm going to vote for Biden AND continue to advocate for the creation of a truly progressive party.
Biden and Harris aren't the only ones who win. They don't get appointed to the Supreme Court, where they can defend marginalized people. A judge does. Obama wasn't all that progressive, and we still made him help with the supreme Court and trans issues.
It absolutely is a literal threat. I'm voting for Biden because I'm threatened. More importantly I'm voting for Biden because of who else is threatened. A lot more Black and Brown people are going to die in 2021 if a federally coordinated response is not put in place.
Biden gives Trump a gift: All of Kamala's baggage
Can‚Äôt wait let‚Äôs go Biden Harris 2020
Sweetie, as a typical burbmom, I have a absurdly large FB friend/relative posse - and THOSE burbmoms, from FL, RI, TX, CA, AZ, GA, MD, PA, NY, SC r ALL voting Biden/Harris too :)! But that‚Äôs cute how u thought I was only talking about my neighborhood ;).
BIDEN ALWAYS RUN BY CLINTON CARTEL CRIMINALS
If it looks like a windmill and sounds like a windmill ... it‚Äôs a WIND TURBINE... hey Trump just grab ‚Äòem by the windmills...
First thing I saw this morning, Trump calling NBA players very stupid. Then I saw he posted about Biden freeing black prisoners. Now this. But he‚Äôs the least racist. Ignorant and hateful.
Suburban , white, married,mid-50‚Äôs, mom of 3 ya‚Äôs, Catholic, CCD teacher who doesn‚Äôt know a single woman of her friends/neighbors who‚Äôs voting for DJT - the ‚Äòburbs r ridin‚Äô with Biden!
Horrible pick. Probably the worst choice Biden could have made. He could have chosen Tulsi.
Corey Booker... is he one of the missing Coreys? Like Corey Feldman, or Corey Haim?   BTW: My wife is a suburban housewife now. She's voting for Biden and Harris, and totally excited. Sorry Donnie!
I‚Äôm a suburban woman, I live in Bucks County, PA and guess what I‚Äôm voting for Biden! The homes here have Biden signs on their lawns. We are going blue!
It‚Äôs going to be fun to watch  kick  ‚Äòs ass in the debates. In fact, here‚Äôs a fun thought: why doesn‚Äôt Trump/Pence debate Biden/Harris in a Fourth Presidential Debate? Nah, it won‚Äôt happen, you‚Äôre all talk/no walk.
I was wondering when the next time you would gain traction for something so blatantly ignorant would be. I‚Äôm not sure about Kamala Harris, but Joe Biden is Catholic (not that this should impact who you vote for in any significant way).
And here I was figuring the same racist and sexist strategy with the Biden pick of the Indian Jamaican.
No, we are voting for Joe Biden. Every ‚Äúsuburban housewife‚ÄùI know is voting  Biden/Harris. Take this ‚Äúhousewife‚Äôs‚Äù advice and start collecting boxes for your move-out in January. Because it‚Äôs coming.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden and Harris obviously but it‚Äôs crazy for me to look at all these blue check marks who absolutely Shat on Biden and Harris both suddenly talking about them like the greatest thing ever. Tons of instances of this, that‚Äôs politics for you though
His statement digs deeper than just Catholicism. Tobin and Biden are both  Irish Catholics (as am I). To infer Biden is not Catholic is a slur - an insult.  It is rooted in the subjugation, suffering and death of Irish Catholic ancestry because of their religion.
Ever notice that Trump's campaign ads always feature Biden and now Harris?  Yet, Biden talks only about solutions and bringing the country together. Never mentions the Clown in the White House.... CLASS ACT #BidenHarris2020
MORE votes for Biden. Harris! Trump keeps hitting,his own voter groups!
was sn  patsy.  Biden VP pick: Susan Rice, the diplomat and lightning rod
Biden is in a state of grave public sin and he‚Äôs unrepentant. I encourage you to ask him to repent as well. We want to be consistent don‚Äôt we?
I have done and will continue to do quite a lot to forward my radical leftist agenda, and voting for Biden/Harris won‚Äôt be one of them. But I‚Äôm still gonna vote for ‚Äòem.
Because Biden may not make it four years and then she‚Äôs President? Seems like a good decision by her.
Omg the desperation of MAGA with their nonsense. If you really cared or had any issue with abuses of power, you‚Äôd be actively working to elect Biden/Harris and get this traitorous mass murdering lunatic out of office:
Y‚Äôalllllllll Taylor is excited about Kamala as the running mate because guess what, it‚Äôs better than Trump. Is Biden/Kamala are NOT the ideal candidates but let me tell you, it has to be better than what we‚Äôre dealing with. Plus, the first WOMAN VP, and a POC, this is exciting.
This statement digs deeper than just Catholicism. Tobin and Biden are both  Irish Catholics (as am I). To infer Biden is not Catholic is a slur - an insult.  It is rooted in the subjugation, suffering and death of Irish Catholic ancestry because of their religion.
If they did, I definitely wouldn't be voting for Biden, I'd be voting for Howie, or Jesse (though he would definitely need to apologize to the LGBT+ community for Predator)
The best part of Biden‚Äôs VP pick is that we get the brilliant  back on  this fall. I‚Äôll vote for that!
Joe Biden is Catholic. What even is this tweet?
Quite frankly it‚Äôs the most racist thing he‚Äôs done.....oh wait ....no him telling people they are black if they don‚Äôt vote for him was .... he‚Äôs a disgrace.....did anyone tell Biden who his VP running mate is.... he will forget by the morning üôÑ
There's something hilarious about Biden's VP pick saying she believes the women that say he sexually assaulted them.
Totally understand that. No one's perfect. I hope I have to reconcile my picks for a Biden administration but we're not there yet.
Yes thank you I would like to order a Biden/Harris baby please?   #BidenHarris2020
Yeah he pretty much had that demo locked up...  Back up though, Democrats picked BIDEN for the black vote.  Sanders or Warren are too progressive and don't connect with black voters.
James ‚ÄúKamala‚Äù Harris formerly of the WWE recently past...Kamala Harris is now running as VP with Joe Biden days later....2020....can‚Äôt make this up ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£ #KamalaHarris #kamala #wwe
Joe Biden/Kamala Harris President/Vice President ticket is formidable. Let's hope and work for a free and fair election. Election cheating is un-American and anti-Democratic. We have an opportunity to clean up the American virus that is the Trump presidency...with Clorox Bleach
Is it racist and sexist to choose a VP based on race and sex?
I want one with Biden Harris on it
Congrats to the Biden campaign for absolutely cleaning up with the "I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't limply and apathetically wait in line to vote for your uninspiring ass because there is just too much despair and death" demographic
Won't be surprised if DJT drops Pence for Haley. Won't make any difference. Biden-Harris for the win!
It took 20 minutes for Trump to respond to the announcement of  as Biden‚Äôs VP with a racist propaganda video of complete lies. Obviously they had this ready to go. They are going to lose and they know it. #BidenHarris2020
I'll have my claws out for the k-hive and biden normies on january 21 but just get there imo
You can already feel the excitement building for the Biden-Harris ticket. Finally hope arrives!
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as President!!
So it‚Äôs Biden/Harris against Trump/Pence  So nothing‚Äôs changing. Got it.
Joe Biden sandbagging the election
YES JOE YES DAMMIT YESSSS #RidinWithBiden
i knew Joe Biden would pick Kamala Harris. üåö
Kamala Harris? Biden really didn‚Äôt have much of a choice. Is he going to get the Progressive vote with this pick? #2020Election #Trump2020Landslide
Boy biden thinks because he picks a black woman that now he will get all of the black people to vote for him well he is going to be very disappointed trump in a landslide.
Oh I see biden is thinking because Harris is black he will get all the black peoples votes wrong!!! Haha trump is going to demolish them.
So proud of u Kamala Harris Is Biden‚Äôs Choice for Vice President
Biden/ Harris to the finish line
Honestly, I realize the media need drama, and the campaign itself tried to inject mystery into the process, but I DON'T CARE. Any of them. Harris, Rice, Demings, etc. All good. The important thing is: vote for Biden and get that miscreant out of there. ASAP.
I have a feeling Biden's VP will be Warren ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I'm so not joking that I don't see how it could be meant to be funny. Biden, Harris, and HRC are right-of-center.
Jillian the new idiot on fox outnumbered I think her two parents were astronauts maybe she‚Äôs from Mars because she‚Äôs absolutely clueless Bernie said that Biden was the most progressive which means left-wing nominee whoever run for president Jillian the new idiot on fox outnumbere
Joe Biden is no more senile than Trump(age 74).   Trump already slurs his words. Physically is very bad shape, diet is Wendy‚Äôs. Father had Alz.
And how can Mr. Biden claim to protect Medicare and ObamaCare when he avoided more than $500,000 in taxes that fund the two programs?
As long as   CONTINUE to show his fucking "new" rallies every day, there will be believers!  WHEN DO THEY PUT A BIDEN CLIP ON?  I GET  BUT NOT  !  Shut him OFF!
Yes. Biden is fit to be President in every way. Trump is unfit to be President in every way. And mass murdering your constituents for your own misconceived political gain is just about the most disqualifying thing in the fucking universe. We will not mourn the loss of the
Hot seat: Joe Biden
Well, future President Biden: Let‚Äôs give some serious consideration to eliminating the WEP provision to help a retired teacher like myself live with dignity.  Governor Raimondo of RI dropped our cost of living increases 11 years ago and we are hurting.  We earned SS but get 30% .
The only purpose of  and  is to have Trump push his debunked conspiracy theories about Obama and Biden. He can say they were ‚Äúcaught red handed spying on his campaign‚Äù a million times and it will never be true. This is Russian propaganda
Trump continues to accuse Biden of staying in his basement.  Lies about health care which he has never introduced.  Bypasses Congress on unemployment checks, lies about virus getting less invasive, lies about the polls going down for him with his typical glib tongue.
Did you really ask ON TV if there is a media outlet dedicated to attacking Trump the way media outfits are attacking Biden?  what are you on, cause I need some of that! Media has been attacking Trump for the past 4years relentlessly including YOUR CNN.
Listened to some clips that make  look like a simple minded critter w/ a pea sized brain today.  has some great one liners. Did you know Joe Biden is now mentally fit because he rode a bycicle this weekend, doesn‚Äôt make sense?  any reply?
He‚Äôs too smart of a business person to invest in Biden.
DEMORAT POLITICIANS NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. OBAMA CLINTON AND BIDEN SHOULD ALL BE IN PRISONüëøüëøüëøüëøüëø
JOE BIDEN BEEN IN GOVERNMENT FOR 40 YEAR'S NANCY PELOSI BEEN TAKING CASH DONATIONS FROM DRUG CARTELS SINCE PABLO ESCOBARüëøüëøüëøüëø
JOE BIDEN SHOULD BE IN PRISON WITH HIS SON.  HUNTER IS A DRUG ADDICT
JOE BIDEN YOU HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS FOR 44 YEAR'S WHY HAVE YOU NEVER GONE TO PRISON?  BIDEN OBAMA CLINTON AND BUSH ARE ALL CRIMINALSüëøüëøüëø
OBAMA AND BIDEN ARE BOTH CLINTON CARTEL CRIMINALS THEY BELIEVE THEMSELVES ABOVE ALL USA LAW'S
BIDEN WHY DO YOU HATE USA CITIZENS THAT WORK AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES???
JOE BIDEN DO YOU BELIEVE USA TAX DOLLARS SHOULD PAY FOR LINCOLN CENTER?  IS IT BECAUSE NANCY PELOSI'S NEICE HAS A BIG SALARY FROM LINCOLN CENTER?
Mr BIDEN YOU have been in government for 40 year's. To me you and OBAMA sold USA to DRUG AND SEX TRAFFICKING CRIMINALS from China.
100% projection.  ‚ÄúMany of Hunter Biden's loudest critics owe their own careers to their own familial connections.‚Äù
I hope Biden picks Susan Rice. She left the boys in Benghazi for dead and then lied about it on every major network. She‚Äôs up to her neck in the unmasking scandal. It would be too good to be true. Even Joe isn‚Äôt foolish enough to pick her.
Biden should channel this guy.   Who was he again?
Got a great nickname for Biden, Mr Magoo. Only problem is it might be endearing
During Biden's time in office, he allowed China to steal America's intellectual property, our innovations, and our manufacturing jobs. And now he and the left are excusing China's worldwide spread of the coronavirus. Of course, they want him: they liked a sleeping America.
I have to agree with you we spend our entire camping season in Connecticut and do drive around a lot and I have only seen 2 Biden yard signs and only 1 flag everything else I have see are trump flags they are everywhere in the upper part of the state
Took. Three courses, at Syracuse Law graduated Rutgers Law. Totally pissed off with way Biden played Senator Harris. Will be voting for Trump.
Yes they want Biden because they know they can get away with more. Trump makes them pay equally for the things they want the US to provide them
It only took a worldwide pandemic, hundreds of thousands of deaths and massive unemployment to bring the economy back to the Obama Biden high mark. üòÇ
At least give Biden equal time.
It all a the Democratic Party playing they endorsed Biden knowing he can‚Äôt do the job but they are pushing for his VP they intern will become president if they win all so they can continue to control us
Here‚Äôs a promise: whatever programs are destroyed by the current president on his way out the door, Biden won‚Äôt do a thing to build back up or repair
Question: ImPOTUS 45 claims Obama/Biden admin so bad at handling Ebola. Can we compare US death counts?
Cold warriors Nixon and Reagan would be stunned that their party has, in just a few short decades, become an ally to the Russian intelligence apparatus.
I am not a Biden fan in the slightest. I voted for Warren with Sanders as my second choice. Other Democrats voted differently.
So u r gonna support Biden the Racist????
Joe Biden needs to denounce this behavior ASAP before he accepts the democratic nomination for president. Protect the constitution of the United States from all foreign and domestic forces.
‚ÄúNeither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night -NOR ASSHOLE APPOINTEES-stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds". VOTE BIG, VOTE BLUE

Nah. Trump- a fringe actor by any reasonable metric - is the leader and standard bearer of the right. Biden on protests: "there is no place for violence and destruction of property. Peaceful protestors should be protected and arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted" 7/30/20
Small correction.  WHEN Biden winsüòÑ
I DON'T think it will work!! People of color see right thru this shit! Give them CREDIT! They WILL VOTE BIDEN!
Hold on and fasten your seat belt! We are in for the most horrific months prior to Nov election with Foreign interference Trump welcomes. Attacking our postal system during a pandemic requiring the safety of mail-in ballots. GOP senators investigating Biden and son using Russia.
Dan, Joe Biden was never worthy of the black vote.
BIDEN ALWAYS THE LOWEST ON THE CLINTON CARTEL LISTüëøü§°üëøü§°üëøü§°
With all due respect Mr. President, Joe Biden was never worthy of the African American vote.
Joe,  thank you for sending out ridiculous Tweets....the entertainment factor is very highüòÇüòÇüòÇ we all need the comic relief...keep them coming  !!! #Biden is entertaining üòÇ #FridayFunDay  #Trump2020Landslide
Fox News For Biden.
Absolutely no argument. Especially for this election. They will grasp at ANYTHING to make Biden and his running mate seem illegitimate.
It‚Äôs funny when Trump‚Äôs base calls Biden a racist. ü§£
BIDEN ALWAYS A DRUNKEN FOOL CLINTON CARTEL CRIMINALü§°üëøü§°
When it comes to hoaxes, Donald Trump has a perfect losing record.   The hoaxes he perpetrated have been exposed, while those he said were aimed against him turned out not to be hoaxes at all.
WON'T WORK!  Why? Biden will have a black woman for VP.  And the ones NOT chosen WILL BE IN HIS cabinet!!
No chance in hell am I voting for Biden you people that are are blind.
Yeah but dude Joe Biden said it...you can‚Äôt make fun of Joe Biden. What are you...a MAGAt?????
TIL driving stick is an incredible, amazing, edgy skill and Joe Biden is actually cool. Thanks guys.
I‚Äôm just saying, we need to have a Trump vs. Biden Thunderdome match for the Presidency in November. I‚Äôll even sing, ‚ÄúWe Don‚Äôt Need Another Hero,‚Äù to sweeten the deal.
I regret to inform you that Joe Biden‚Äôs father is not the drift king.
Biden won‚Äôt hurt God but Trump might hurt Jesus‚Äôs fist.
Someone should tall DJT that he's too late with his latest Biden take: Falwell has already killed God. And buried him under a pile of...
Trump has us On Our Knees and grieving for our country‚Äôs current state of chaos and deaths. We need Biden who knows how to grieve and knows personally the ways out of grieves depressions...  Biden a decent man to ‚Äúget us thru‚Äù.
Apparently Biden can hurt God, which is a really weird endorsement from  who isn't nearly strong enough to hurt God, because he's a little bitch.
This coming from a lifelong lib. A conservative could possibly not vote for Trump...but would never vote for what Biden and the rest of the socialists are promising.
I think the problem might be that you find it incomprehensible that someone would find it pretty amusing that Joe Biden said ‚Äúgod, could my dad drive a car...oof‚Äù.   Sorry I upset you promise ü•∫üëâüëà
I mean all I did was find Joe Biden‚Äôs quote about his dad funny. Is there problem with that?
You know I‚Äôm not sure...could you possibly write a few more sentences explaining a rhetorical device because some people found a Joe Biden quote funny?
I can‚Äôt believe that Biden‚Äôs choice for VP will truly change anyone‚Äôs mind about who they will vote for. Maga people aren‚Äôt going to switch over because of it and Biden people are already locked in
