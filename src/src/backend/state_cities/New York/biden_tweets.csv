The funny thing is you are just like Biden. Blacks don‚Äôt have diversity because they aren‚Äôt black if they don‚Äôt vote democrat. You treat them like pets. They must obey. Then you call everyone racist that doesn‚Äôt. Kinda funny. If it wasn‚Äôt so sad.

Biden‚Äôs running mate
I, a liberal, enjoyed this. Your guests avoidance of the question that If this was happening under an Obama presidency, Republicans would be in the warpath, was disheartening. Also, Biden is the most conservative Democrat possible. Last, their ‚Äúmedia is against us‚Äù is boring.
Very true Mr Biden.
I totally agree. We have to promote Biden as much as possible and drain the Trump swamp.

Of course they are lol!! You are desperate for vote! Which is evident by trumps church bullshit about Biden. Trump does even know what a church is?

Trump has done nothing but help blacks with prison and crime reform helping black colleges. These are things that will help blacks like opportunity zones. What has biden done in the 30 years he has been in office. Nothing nothing nothing. Now again he is telling u he hates u
BIDEN HATES BLACK PEOPLE. He is telling u this. This is now the second time he is apologizing for it. Don‚Äôt apologize Joe YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE. Don‚Äôt be misled by this Devil cause u know he is. If he gets elected right he won‚Äôt do nothing for u until 4 years later when he comes
Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden
God, I hope so. My son-in-law keeps showing me videos of Biden making verbal gaffes when being interviewed, all extemporaneous comments. I want him to win, but are these videos legit??
Remember the infamous Hollywood Access Tape in which Donald Trump said: "And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy."  During campaign, that same DJT "star," paid hush money to 2 women &amp; now alleges Biden will "hurt God" Really?
So Trump claimed Biden is against God? Biden is a devout Catholic. If you think Trump is the least bit religious himself, you need to crack open a bible, because I doubt you've been in the same room as one #trump #biden #biden2020 #Trump #god #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Of course not one mention of Joe Biden racist comments yesterday ü§îü§îü§î this is why the American public does not trust the main stream media

I‚Äôm all for that line of reasoning. Just not two months before there‚Äôs an election where one of the two candidates is a sociopath. I don‚Äôt buy the ‚ÄúJoe Biden is a pedo‚Äù argument. He‚Äôs a creepy old guy who likes to touch people when he speaks to them. I know 1,000 guys like this.
Oh, really? You recognize Trump as a permanent threat to our democratic institutions and as a result you're "very seriously considering voting for Biden"? Then by all means, he should tailor every decision to your individual preferences and also explain them in the ways you like.
Oh, and by the way, it isn't sufficient for Biden to just make decisions that S.E. Cupp agrees with. He also needs to explain those decisions in ways that precisely align with her individual preferences.
But don't worry! She's "very seriously considering" a vote for Biden. A second Trump term may damage our democratic institutions beyond compare, so the alternative is vaguely on the table for S.E. Cupp. By all means, then, Biden should make every decision with her in mind.

Sounds like a perfect day for Biden to announce.
Libertarians love pointing out that Biden also sucks. Congrats on being so smart, but next time how about you add something constructive and useful to the conversation instead of playing devils advocate.
1.2% is not a large gap and enthusiasm in 2020 is tied bc Democrats are VERY enthusiastic about voting Trump out of office. In every Presidential election since 2004 FL has been 3-3.5% more R leaning than the nation. If Biden wins the popular vote by 4+ he wins Florida
We are talking about Biden's views in abortion. Why do you say he is pro-abortion?
Florida is significantly more likely to go for Biden than AZ or NC. FL is a R+3 state and Biden is up by more than 3 nationwide. Unless Trump closes the national popular vote to 3 points or less Biden is the favorite in FL
This is their new hoax. And, it‚Äôll just go away.  #LiarInChief #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #vote #Biden #gop #trump #COVID19 #coronavirus
Biden is winning in every single state you mentioned plus AZ
What makes you say Biden is pro-abortion? And I don't mean pro-choice. You are implying he is pro-abortion, why?
Also, with all of the policy decisions that this administration has made, focusing on a vocabulary test is missing the point. (Tho, you know, imagine being excited about Biden.)
Biden/Rice is possibly the most boring option we could have possibly gotten for 2020.
Trump: "When the looting starts..."  Biden: "Under the laws of Chickasaw County, Broomhilda here is my property..."
I am totally amazed how the news media nitpicks any little word yet ignores Biden and his massive brain farts
You are using your religion to determine what should or shouldn't happen politically. You are using Biden's political party membership as a means to nullify his faith.  Separation of church and state.
Biden is really going to blow this by picking Susan Rice.
I really don't know what you are talking about with 'abortion after birth.' You keep bringing that up as an issue, but I don't know any politician who is asking for whatever that is. Definitely not Biden.
Mental illness may forgive or excuse his behavior (i.e. mania), but this does not excuse his beliefs. Kanye West believes he should harm Biden's chances and keep Trump in office. Kanye West is a flaming asshole.
Biden‚Äôs gonna tell her to go back to Africa

The Obama and Biden administration was a disgrace
I'd vote for Biden even if he chose a steaming turd as his running mate. The W.O.A.T in the WH must go. January 2021 is not soon enough
How about Killery,Obama and Biden, that let out men die in  Bengazi?
You think Trump is an embarrassment...have look at Biden???
Biden is Catholic. Trump's money Christians think Catholics are evil. No Catholic person should vote for Trump.
I knew I'd get this response, but Biden's faculties aren't even the point here. Trump's voters look at him as their avatar, a representation of themselves. Insulting his intelligence is insulting theirs, and it's terrible praxis.
Oh, look... Joe Biden crumbled under a false accusation by Trump and rushed to have a response written in defense of his ‚Äúfaith‚Äù. None of this shit should fucking matter in 2020. We shouldn‚Äôt even have religion anymore, but rubes keep it around. It should NEVER be in politics!

Just. Wow. OMG.  üòê  Biden is wayyyyy out there. Whilst DT may be lacking any shred of ‚Äòcooth‚Äô (due to him being a native of Queens NY), Biden is lost in space. I‚Äôll take an a**hole president that knows how to get sh*t done. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
It's bad from a death perspective because of a specific governor who put covid patients into nursing homes. But that's Drumpf's fault too right??  And yea, Biden will change course for a global pandemic. That dude can't even change his own diaper. Good luck with that.
Also, separation of church and state. Your religions beliefs should stay out of government. Biden, a Catholic, probably agrees with you spiritually, but knows that he can't impose that belief on the rest of us.
Biden doesn‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs Friday üòê Trump2020
I agree with  as usual. Biden is not my first choice, and it‚Äôs NOT a lesser of two evils choice either. It is the need to defeat this destructive GOP administration and Senate that have damaged this country and beyond.
Great, and then Trump can turn around and ask Biden if he can define them.   This Democratic intellectual elitism has GOT. TO. STOP.
I would like to see Jonathan Swan use the same approach with Biden as he did with Trump. A handful, you can‚Äôt be serious. He has decades of saying racist statements.

What makes you think that? Biden has voted against abortion many times.
Save your pathetic charges. The President isn‚Äôt screwing anyjne except the deep state. The President likes adult women, we all know he isn‚Äôt perfect. Biden seems to like to rub &amp; inappropriately touch little girls in broad daylight. Imagine what he does behind closed doors.
Biden‚Äôs bus drops me closer to my ideals  I don‚Äôt understand the hypocrisy in being against public funding of contraceptives? And assistance for hunger and assistance for childcare And then just cast a side note to the horror of locking children away ?

What is Biden‚Äôs stance on post 24 week abortion?
Voting consistently for a party is not what Joe Biden is saying here. And if you're not aware, there's ideological differences on the left as well. I don't vote for Republicans but I also don't agree with Clintononian governance. I'm African American.
It's been a shell game since he took office, the market hasn't moved correctly since he took office, I feel bad for Biden once he wins, and trump money men stop playing and manipulating the market... it's going to bottom out bad
Yes and Joe Biden didn't say all black people vote for the same people in this clip so why are you pretending your statement has anything to do with the clip? But again, voting Democrat doesn't mean they all believe the same thing "politically," there's differences on the left.
They are manouvering to keep him out of any debates. I watched his wife with obvious pain on her face. Can you imagine the fights to come between her and the VP if Biden wins
Really cause this loser makes funny of Biden I mean really he needs daddy to buy him a girlfriend
Yes support a racist who wants to segregate Minorties out of the suburbs. He hopes to have your healthcare cut and he and his family have been stealing from taxpayers! And he has done nothing for the community the biggest declines came under Obama/Biden!

So if it's going to be one of them then I'd prefer Biden. If there was another option is be happy to support it. But it's going to be one of them. Unfortunately we have a two party system. I wish we didn't but we do.
Wow, I mentioned this when kanye first babbled that he was running. He's running to attempt to fuck over Biden, which will help Trumpty Dumpty. I wonder if God approves of his vindictive plan? #hypocrite, thy name is Kanye West.

True. My choice right now is Biden or Trump. If they pick someone else I'd prefer that choice.
Well I choose not Trump. I certainly didn't vote for Biden. But in the end, I'll vote for not Trump.

That makes sense. I agree that you can't claim you're voting for Biden it helps Black people, given his history. That's also why I always find it so perplexing how much support Biden gets from the Black community during the primaries when there better candidates to pick from.
He will do way more damage than that.  I'm confident that Trump will win.  Why would anyone trust Biden?  This election is ridiculous.

Maybe he intends on being openly anti-Catholic. Add that to his bigotries. Biden being a practicing Catholic equates to "no religion" in trump's twisted mind.
I think that crazy covid doctor who believes in demon sex convinced Trump that a demon had its way with Biden and he now carries around demon sperm which he is using to destroy all religion and kill God.
Why not? are you afraid of what he has to say? Did you report on Joe Biden and the racist remarks he made? Just wondering. I don't watch CNN so I don't know.
What‚Äôs your point? That the NYAG should have held off the case to help Biden? Should she have conferred with the campaign? Of course not. That‚Äôs the whole thing Dems should be fighting against.

that's malarkey town.  We need crazy Biden tweets. everyone knows that, c'mon fats. That's a big fat malarky Jack!!
So The Donald says Biden wants to hurt God ? Ok who wants to tell him üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Biden is a devout Catholic and Trump takes photo ops in front of churches during a global pandemic. Stop gaslighting
Find me a Presidential candidate that says his rival is ‚Äúagainst God‚Äù.  It‚Äôs a terrible thing to say.  Especially about Joe Biden who is not a bad man.  (Bad candidate? Well sure haha)
Unreal, I feel great today. Great sleep, Major championship golf, Tiger Woods -2 through 14, Joe Biden puking all over himself and exposing the mentality of the left, fantasy football draft, beautiful weather, what else ya got for me world?
Biden owns guns, do you?  He has already said there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs taking guns away
Biden the almighty
Somebody please tell Joe #Biden to say "Person woman man camera TV" at the top of his opening debate remarks
Hilarious. Biden is against God and religion...really? He goes to church to pray. You go to church to get photo ops. You are an asshole
#truth Biden doesn't think African American community isn't diverse. #JoeBidenIsARacist
Biden misspoke. He meant to say Republicans don't know. You see, Democrats think that all blacks are the same and sleepy Joe let the cat out of the bag. We know that when black Americans walk away from the Democrats this nation will be better for it. We want you.
He‚Äôs destroying your brain and that‚Äôs destroying your children. I‚Äôll be fine in a biden admin. Even though he will destroy things Americans really hold dear. Like gun rights and freedom of speech. Safe streets because the dem party hates police so much. I‚Äôll be ok.

Biden is Democrat hypocrisy on steroids. They are all edging closer to the cliff as they all realize they created this shit show.
Don‚Äôt forget that Biden is able to achieve all this...from his basement.
Biden, more powerful than a speeding locomotive. Able to defeat an all-powerful God and the Bible in a single bound!
And Biden can accomplish this while hiding in the basement!!
uhh catholics like joe biden always hurt god; thats the whole religion
If Trump hasn‚Äôt hurt God, Biden isn‚Äôt going to lay a glove on Him.

Donald Trump: ‚ÄúJoe Biden is so weak and frail, he doesn‚Äôt know where he is, he can be pushed by a slight breeze‚Äù  Also Donald Trump: ‚ÄúJoe Biden will challenge God to a fist fight!‚Äù
I'm white and look the part. I will try that bank thing without collateral and let you know how it works out....reading what liberals say is almost as funny as watching Biden speak.
Has everyone had enough of this Clown already ?  He is doing all this to make himself look good to run for President.  The basement handlers of Biden are going to pull an about face and make the KING there nominee....Be careful
At this point, Biden could name a sweaty gym sock his running mate, and I'd be all "YAY GYM SOCK" wtf is wrong with people
President Trump is literally taking away someone's guns while speaking in Ohio and warning folks that Biden will come take their guns...hmm...

Joe Biden is a flaming piece of shit on americas doorstep that we all have to step on to make sure our houses dont burn down.
Yeah...when did Trump (who doesn't even know literally how to hold a Bible, let alone read it) who has done nothing Christian in his life become an expert on Biden's religious practices?
people can be racist without even knowing it.  a lot of racism is subconscious.  Biden is so old there's no way he's not unconsciously racist.
"Whenever he gets questioned hard at all [Biden] freaks out."
I throughly enjoy  commentary. However, her latest column is flawed! It‚Äôs missing a rationale for why she would vote for Biden if Kamala Harris is the VP choice but won‚Äôt support him if it‚Äôs Susan Rice. Please elaborate!
You‚Äôre proud of her?  Not even the senile Biden will endorse her.
I don't understand what your comment means. Why does it seem like I haven't broken out of the media's false dichotomy? Because Clinton, Obama and Biden are not liberals and I take issue with them being called that? I don't get your intent behind this.
Some of the women are Republicans.  I'm sure she is not referring to them. They would be the "exceptions" that Biden mentioned in his racist comments earlier today.
I‚Äôm probably voting for Biden based on  his administration over Trumps
That's why he can lie to them so well. They're basically all the same. If you ain't votin for Biden, you ain't black man!
To call Biden a white supremacist is a big stretch. Comparing him and trump in that light even bigger. Also, if trumps not the racist, you might want to let all the nazis, white nationalists and kkk people here know that. They seem to think he is. You're wrong on every point.
Yet another disaffected Republican who thinks she can influence decisions in the Democratic Party.   Biden or Trump. Take your pick.   Let your conscience be your guide.
Biden: "lucky for us the Alamo is in Pearl Harbor so we had General Custard to fight off those Germans with the rope in the library. Imagine the carnage then? Come on man! You're not Mexican if you can't see that!"
The postal union endorsed Biden, very different.  Stop lying.
Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi have taken over the  Twitter account
Everyone seems a little too invested in this narrative for it not to seem like a self fulfilling prophecy.   Maybe ask Paul Ryan how waiting for a Biden gaffe in a debate went.
I have yet to make up my mind on who will receive my vote for President, but I can say unflinchingly that it will NEVER be Joe Biden. #2A
I don't disagree with a single fact in this article but I wholly disagree with the tone denoting America's place in world leadership is dead and buried.  We need to rebuild the American Social Contract and it will have to begin with the young progressives that come after Biden.
yes, point 2. saying the quiet part out loud a la joe Biden.  explicitly political attack/theater.   gun deaths  are bad, but the only reason Dems care is because it is one of the few industries exclusively aligned with the GOP.   the same formulation applies to Banks, Pharma,
Whoever votes for #KanyeWest ..it‚Äôs a  Republican scheme so wake up ..they just want to take Blackvotes away from Biden..wake up
Nothing could stop me from voting for Biden to get Trump out of office, his term feels like a lifetime, a lifetime of torment and disgust.

Biden's plan: "every American has access to housing that is affordable, stable, safe and healthy, accessible, energy efficient and resilient, and located near good schools and with a reasonable commute to their jobs."  How is that bad?

So Dopey Joe is pandering to drug smugglers and human traffickers now?
To summarize. Biden takes black vote for granted, insults them and panders to the hispanic community. Blacks get screwed again. New boss same as the old boss, will they get fooled again?

Joe Biden won
Biden also says he would like to see schools reopen, but not until cases go down in most communities, especially where there have been serious increases in cases.
Biden also says he is being briefed four times a week on what is happening Imwith the COVID-19 Pandemic.
I guess yahoo is running campaign adds for Biden now. I wonder why 7 in 10 Americans dont trust the media.
They‚Äôre lowering expectations about Biden because they know there‚Äôs not going to be any debates. Trump‚Äôs campaign will never let him out there to debate. They‚Äôre already creating a pretext with that preposterous letter to the debate commission demanding their own moderators.
It has become very clear that if Biden were to win in Nov. the democrats will destroy the country in many ways. They clearly want the country to become socialist. The once honest loyal Democratic Party is gone,in it‚Äôs place, unfortunately,are lies,spies &amp; misinformation.
Yeah, they‚Äôre all lying, and you‚Äôre telling the truth. Since we‚Äôve lived through a known 20,000 lies from you, I think I believe Yates. #trump #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #Election2020 #Biden
Obama,Biden,Pelosi and others are all traitors and spies.   That carries the death penalty.
If people don‚Äôt vote for Biden because of his VP pick then misogyny will prevail. If the concern is that she‚Äôll be the presumptive nominee in 2024 then don‚Äôt vote for her then. But at this point the goal is simple. Defeat Trump. Return a semblance of rationality to the country.
Biden is obviously impaired. His wife should be ashamed of herself for not protecting her husband's health and welfare. Biden is not capable of being President.

When people say Biden needs to be out there more campaigning instead of hiding in his basement, I always have to laugh. We‚Äôre so much better off if he just shuts the hell up
Joined Twitter in April 2020 &amp; pastes a Biden meme. BOT.
Im going to mail in my vote then go to my polling place to ensure they received a ballot that says Biden on it!
A ‚Äúsource‚Äù I‚Äôd love to know who it is then we can know if he or she is actually credible.... we all know how CNN loves to use sources that claim false information, because that‚Äôs all CNN is its false &amp; there is no journalism at all, you should report on how Biden is mentally ill!
She answered the rest and said Obama did nothing nor did Biden she reported Flynn they are tying to clean up traitor Flynnwho was a agent of Turkey pd 500,000 to kidnap a guy out of PA to return to Turkey for death plus had the nerve 1/5/16 call Russian agent to cool putin down !
No, no, no! NO banning Trump from Twitter! No! Every ban of Trump is votes lost for Biden! Let Trump speak, free and unfiltered! Let Trump share his crazed, 3am insomniac hatred and paranoia with all Americans! Trump speaking is like an apocalyptic trumpet, announcing his defeat!
joe Biden complete a full sentence
They don't go for liberal policies. Medicare for all. Living wage. Reducing the Defense Budget. Holding corporations and Wall Street responsible. The list goes on and on. Clinton signed away Glass-Steagall. Obama offered a GOP version of the ACA. Biden wrote a vicious crime bill.
Okay, you people need to get something clear, here -- Clinton, Obama and Biden are NOT liberals. They are, at best, moderates and, in MY liberal book, Reagan Democrats, and I do not see that as a compliment. Anyone who claims otherwise does not know what it means to be a liberal.

Can I just point out that Biden is not the best the Democrats can do. They picked and supported the guy they think the people that actually show up will vote for. All these Bernie Bros cry foul, but those are the same assholes who have never seen a polling place in their lives.
you just perfectly described the Biden plan; haven't you been paying attention?
Joe Biden is going to make Donald Trump his VP nominee
No, you don't get off deflecting WHICH IS WHAT I SAID DEMS DO! Do you see Biden has cognitive issues? Yes or no.
Trump isn‚Äôt facing Biden, he‚Äôs battling his own ego. He can‚Äôt get out of his own way.
Imagine when Joe Biden is elected. How can those hypocrites say one word about ANYTHING he does!!!!
Ok who wrote this? Because it wasn't Biden.
Imagine being so scared to lose to Biden that you have to doctor videos and photos of him in a campaign ad rather than just using actual embarrassing footage, of which there is plenty of. Is November here yet? #overit
We‚Äôll see what kind of spot he‚Äôs in after the debates. Even the biggest Trump haters can‚Äôt deny that Biden simply cannot form full sentences. It‚Äôs really sad and I truly hope he‚Äôs ok health wise

I never defended biden or said he wasn't racist. Nice try though. Some of us like neither biden nor trump. I know conservatives have a hard time wrapping their heads around that but it's true. But nice try at that deflection there, I notice you didn't answer my question.
Did you guys know Biden was a straight white man?? I wasn‚Äôt sure before but this video cleared it up for me
You talking about Biden ?
I feel sorry for VP Biden.  If he is not mentally failing then he should take test and reveal results. His lack of interest in taking the test tells me he is getting senile.  I‚Äôm not sure we should have a president who is not mentally all there which is what we‚Äôd have with Biden

Why wouldn't Biden accept the nomination in person? Probably so he can have a pre-taped acceptance speech presented. Why would he want that? So they can can make sure he doesn't flub it.
Their strongest pitch starts off with admitting Biden sucks. Kinda says it all
he's a Trojan horse. Everyone knows that he's just the face of the operation; whoever his running mate is will be the real president if they win. Give it 30 days &amp; Biden resigns for health reasons.

It's weird how liberals accuse Kanye of being Republican (probably true) but also accuse him of trying to take votes away from Biden. But they can't see that that is only possible because Biden is also a republican

This is awful. The reporter really kept his cool. Joe Biden is a racist.

Joe Biden is a racist. The cocaine comment was terrible. His c‚Äômon man shtick is as old as he is. He said some months ago he takes a cognitive test everyday. Although given Hunters cocaine addiction he is well versed. What a disaster.
I liked the "come on man" affection he put on because he thinks that's how you speak to black men. He used the same exact cadence as when saying "you ain't black" if you don't vote Biden.

biden is under a Senate judiciary investigation about burisma/ukraine right now and they will most likely find some bribery. Trump is going to be investigated for #fauciGate, tax/real estate fraud, the #PPPloan scam, illegal sanctions, illegal use of our military, coercion, etc..

Yes I do think Biden will be way better.
You hope that Biden comes in and the country gets worse then it's current state? Smells like privilege
If Biden were to only win two states,  it'd be Hawaii and Vermont, not New York. An argument can be made that'd it'd be California and Hawaii though.   Goes without saying DC should be blue.
Who will Biden choose as Secretary of Shut The Fuck Up, Mr. President?   It‚Äôll be the most important job in his WH. And he clearly can‚Äôt keep whoever Trump hired. üòÖ

My new theory is that she is prepping us for the utter disaster of Biden's lame-duck admin. She hits all the crises at once and puts out solid plans so that, when his "appease the wealthy base" proposals fall flat, we have constant reminders of what real left policy looks like.
The amount of BS Biden has been on I seriously can‚Äôt be mad at this anymore. But still fuck them too

Biden is a centrist democrat, he isnt even for universal health care. His policies are not socialist.
There is more probabilistic downside to a trump autocracy that effectively eliminates your ability to legally affect change.   With Biden, you can still general strike, protest, etc.
Tell me about Trump‚Äôs policing policies that will help with law and order? He‚Äôs implemented them, and done nothing but escalate the issue and violate the constitution. Which of Biden‚Äôs policies will lead to rampant crime and lawlessness?
Gotta love that Biden outreach of catering to absolutely no one besides fascists
Who?  You?  I dont know about all that "we".  BLK politics = Tangible policies  Biden has LESS BLK support than Hilary did in 2016.  Biden will get 90% of half the ppl that WOULD HAVE voted for tangibles.  We already know that's not enough.  #NoBlackAgendaNoVote

Agree and disagree. Biden is no radical so expect no radical change. As a moderate his leadership will involve following and fellowship. The direction he will lead will depend a lot on we the people, what we want. As long as there is a consensus or a clear best for all direction

I hardly think a convention, at which he would be reading a speech from a teleprompter, is a more strenuous test of mental acuity than the debate in September is. Biden has plenty of faults but he‚Äôs fine when he‚Äôs reading something prepared

You may be right but non corporate democrats want (any) democrat at this point. Biden isn‚Äôt what is important really. It‚Äôs Supreme Court appointment, Vice President, it‚Äôs control of house and Senate. Much bigger than Biden.
how could anyone even consider BIDEN, listen to TRUMP ON FOX &amp; FRIENDS This morning everything he talked about, and put Biden in his place for 5 sec, he could not even explain any topic without FLUBBERING IT UP!!  Don't even considercBIDEN, unless u have death wish for America.

I think the idea is that Biden, as imperfect as he is not a Nazi and that should be good enough especially versus Trump
It's making people realize the severity of their decisions. It shows that if you're only going to vote for someone who perfectly agrees with you it's a sign of privilege. Biden's presidency won't be the same as Trump's. Kids are in cages, people dying of Covid and mass shootings
Puppet president, puppet candidate? You turned a joke about another politician into an attack on Biden. That is an acceptable use of ad hominem.1/

As a moderate Joe Biden is going to survive by consulting. He is going to try to give everyone a cookie. He is Bush-like, he will be a decider. He is not going to come into a discussion with a preset conclusion. If you are a Deadhead think "Ripple"
People who are against Trump and won't vote for Biden are naive. They don't understand what is at stake if they vote according to an idealistic vision. They could be called exotic, or unrealistic, and are acting childish. They also fail to follow any leadership therefore narrow.

In fairness, there were quite a few candidates in the primary who I thought made pretty bad-faith attacks on Biden that didn‚Äôt work. I think all of them should be out of consideration. Harris just happens to be the one people consider most likely.
The Harris/Dodd stuff started from this politico article which I don‚Äôt think is at all unfair critiques   She obviously went after Biden big time in first debate. That makes trust an issue. It brings into question whether you can be a team player/trusted #2
You have to have deep trust in the person that is going to be the #2 person in the administration. She took the biggest swing at Biden. It didn‚Äôt help her. Jill Biden called it a gut punch. Nothing in this article seems unfair to me.
I'm no Biden fan, but there's no way he'd reject progressive policies passed by Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress. If the US doesn't pass universal healthcare, we have (almost) only Congress to blame.

Biden is weak, can't think for himself and will go wherever his party pushes him. If the democrats are increasingly radical, Biden will be increasingly radical. This is why he now supports defunding the police after a long career of being tough on crime.

I love that he‚Äôs appraised Joe Biden as being able to hurt God, but not maim or kill him.
I believe Trump wants an earlier debate so that he can try to get Biden to ramble, mix his words up, possibly show his rage, and appear incoherent and use that against him for the early voters. Not only will it make a "gotcha" moment or 2 but campaign ads too.   Just my opinion.

Joe Biden is "sleep", "low energy", and can't get anything done.  But yet he can hurt an omnipotent god?   They can't even stay on message!
Um [not that it should matter] Biden isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwithout religion‚Äù you lying twit (Trump, not  she‚Äôs the bee‚Äôs knees!), he‚Äôs a devout Catholic. G-d will be just fine. If G-d can handle the human poopstain that is you, a decent, thoughtful, kind old man like Biden is cake.
Joe Biden quotes:  I don't want my kids growing up in a jungle.  You're not black if you vote Trump.  Blacks are not diverse, meaning all blacks are the same.   Calls a black reporter  a "junkie" for questioning this cognitive health.     and his full blown racism
Biden campaign fires back after Trump attacked his faith
"Offering a reward for dirt on Joe Biden"?
Kid, get off twitter and read some books. Don't come back on until election day. Maybe you'll see that Joe Biden is the only candidate who can save us.
Joe Biden read a book 2020 challenge
What gain, Mr. President, saying your opponent is "against God", while assailing Catholicism?   PS Do you think God likes you, Mr President?   PPS Do you think God knows  you are using God to scare folks?         #RegisterToVote2020
Joe doesn't want his kids growing up in a racist jungle, tells blacks they aren't black if they vote Trump, says black people are all like, and then calls a black reporter a junkie for questioning his cognitive health. Why isn't the left speaking out against Biden's racism?
Racist  is at it again bashing black people while Anti-Trump left wing losers call Trump a racist and evil.  Just another example of left wing hypocrisy.    #RacistJoeBiden #BidenHatesBlacks #DemSlaveOwner
Oh look racist  is bashing blacks yet again. You keep deflecting from his pure racist beliefs against  blacks that he shows over and over again while calling  Trump a racist. Stay a hypocrite.
At FCB, while insisting he takes nothing for granted,  alludes to possibility of "a very different reality" next 1/20‚Äîi.e., a Biden Admin &amp; Dem Congress that BdB (like Cuomo) assumes will pour money into city &amp; state. As usual, he also calls for higher taxes on wealthy.
If Biden (or any other human being, for that matter) can hurt God then He is not as almighty as many believe.  Trump poses his own Epicurean riddle.
Trump  ‚ÄúBiden bad. Me good‚Äù ‚ÄúBiden hates gun. Me like‚Äù ‚ÄúBiden hates God. Many people say I‚Äôm God like‚Äù  And hjs followers eat it up. I understand now how Jim Jones got so many people to willingly drink koolaid
Bothers me that qualifications don‚Äôt even matter. If I was  I‚Äôd sue the Democratic Party and how biden for discrimination

Sanders-Biden debate? No more MSNBC or CNN!
This anti-Biden crap coming from Trump, his administration/campaign and the GOP is getting weirder - and more desperate - each day.
It's like  aren't even paying attention to how awful Biden is. Or they are and they know they'll have a puppet in office who'll run their agenda and receive unilateral support from the MSM.
PUT A BIDEN 2020  SIGN ON YOUR YARD OR FRONT AREA
Part of me wonders if Biden has Theoretically Pure Anterograde Amnesia, cause he seems to be forgetting a lot!
Yes. Biden is ignorant. In case you didn't know
Ngl, this suddenly makes me like Biden... üò∂
Debating Hidin' Biden would be really sad.  Your father should debate  .  It would be a entertaining and move the overton window towards freedom and away from Socialism.
Trump Campaign Busted For Deceptively Manipulating Biden Photos In New Ad  via  // TRUMP AND DIRTY GOP REPUBLICANS WILL DO ANY THING TO CHEAT AND STEAL THIS ELECTION ...NOT GONNA HAPPEN ON OUR ......WATCH THOUGH..VOTE HIS CORRUPT ASS OUT NOV
It is the usual government nightmare as most are but the benefit is huge. Don't write it off bc of their dysfunction! I've got years of this happening to me as well but hope to save $80k in the end. Not w this administration but hopefully under a Biden one they'll honor it.
Biden can be pushed on some issues.  people need to stop putting so much focus on electoralism that's not the only solution. Civil Rights wasn't passed because of voting it took years of hard work from activists to achieve that. Elections are only a small part of enacting change
The consultants who don't want Biden to debate may know what they're talking about.
My $SWBI and $RGR love this.  They'll both double or triple if Biden is elected.  Democrats and their policies sell a lot of guns!
Are you kidding me with this guy Biden. Lol. Seems like he has a nut loose in his head.  #Trump2020
That's a great deflection from the fact that those who run for office have no say as to who supports them. Get real and keep avoiding the fact Biden is a racist.
This clip changed my mind Biden is hilarious and since I could care less about the Executive  Branch let him just roast people online and let AOC, Tlaib, Cori Bush, Jayapal and Ilhan pass bills that Biden will have to sign
Biden should not consider debating trump! It's a non starter! A fools errand at best!
If only Biden was a good enough candidate to not need people going around asking people to sign Pledges to vote for him  Imagine if he had, idk, Policy positions, that just made people want to vote for the guy who wrote the crime bill and asks black reporters if they're on crack
Biden will not debate trump!
Biden should not consider debating trump! You can't debate insanity!
Lmao, it won't take any longer than it ever does. They will be declaring Biden the winner by 10:30 pm EST.   When it happens, look outside Donny. You will finally get that epic crowd. Millions will be dancing in the streets all night to celebrate your loss.
At least Biden is not owned by Putin
And Trump is attacking Biden's mental ability to be president? Um okay......
If Hidin' Biden doesn't debate, would you have a debate with  and   I feel like it would be more productive than talking with Hidin' Biden anyways.
I agree we need a ‚Äúbalanced ‚Äú ticket - a progressive and a moderate  and Biden is the moderate.
My point is that not only is Biden not accepting the nomination at his convention but as of this morning President Trump is not either. Pres Trump also said it was due to health and safety reasons as well and the he would have preferred to do it at the convention..
Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report
Remember you're only black if you vote for Biden.
Biden wants to use federal funds to create automatic expungement processes for marijuana convictions as part of his plan for racial equity in the economy.  Read more here:
Biden should only agree to debate if Trump first releases his tax returns and other financial records. Trump will not ‚Äúdebate‚Äù anyway and get up there and lie and spew nonsense like he usually does...
President Biden will appoint an attorney general and fill inspector general positions. Those people will need to determine if or how quickly to pursue this. Unlike Trump, I don‚Äôt see Biden micro-managing random things because he will have a qualified cabinet.
For 4.9m people what about the other 22m people? If you said ‚Äú‚Äòyeah Biden is wrong on this issue, but I still support him overall‚Äù I‚Äôd have a much easier time having this conversation. But right now it seems like you don‚Äôt care about the working poor.
Where's the Money.... Assholes.... We are hating life and you and your cronies get paid.... Donate the Senate and the houses pay to us.... The people who are voting for you or else. We are all waiting to see what you do Me. President.... What's it going to be? You or Biden?
I like how she cites "Biden's VP black women pick" as if no matter whp he picks will be drunk with power just because she is a black woman
Whoever is getting paid to prepare him for interviews needs to be looking for another job. It's hard to accuse Biden of bumbling through interviews when you doing it.  Oh, and Per Capita stats are REAL stats. You can't omit states deaths publicly to lower death rates.
Biden won't go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
I read what you said, but it translated to "muh Russia"  millions of dollars spent, over a year investigation.  Mueller came up with NOTHING  Why is this president being attacked from every possible direction? Ask yourself that. Biden is literally ON TAPE SAYING HE DID PAY TO
The point is to reach out to NEW voters, your base is your base. It was obvious that bernie and biden had rock solid support so the only real option for growth was appealing to the disenfranchised. I think the left overlooked yang bc they were told busy stroking their bases egos
really thought they were gonna go for the William Henry Harrison route with Biden and just let him die of Covid right after finding a Vice President capable of uttering a full sentence but I guess they're just gonna do a whole zoom call thing
Omg what a nut job.  ‚ÄúHey man‚Äù That‚Äôs all Biden can say.
- Like I said, I'm no supporter of Biden but I am also about being accurate and factual when it comes to either attacking or defending anyone.  I can't tell people they're not being if I'm not being the same.
AP source: Biden won‚Äôt go to Milwaukee for acceptance speech
AP source: Biden won‚Äôt go to Milwaukee for acceptance speech
I'm certainly no fan of Joe Biden but I could swear I heard President Trump say this morning that he may be accepting his party's nomination at the White House. No?
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.

Attention world, after making this statement Trump was immediately brought to Walter Reed with severe burns when his pants caught on fire.üî•üî• And here comes MAGA cause I made fun of their messiah.
I am very honored to once again be chosen as a Bernie Sanders delegate to the Democratic Nat‚Äôl Convention. Like Bernie, we support Joe Biden, but beating Trump is not enough. We need to leave post-Reagan economics behind and renew the promise of the New Deal.
The Debate Commission has scheduled debates between Trump and Biden for Sept. 29, Oct. 15 and Oct. 22.  Early voting in NY starts 10/24.  Trump campaign mum after aide confirms he‚Äôll debate Biden 3 times  via
And one debate for every deal Biden made with China to make his incompetent son Hunter super rich!  My God we will need more than a couple months worth of debates!
Do Biden people ever argue in good faith? At the end of the day I still want everyone to have health care, whether I think you‚Äôre a shill or not. I still want everyone to have a decent life. You can question whatever you‚Äôd like, but I know it‚Äôs not in good faith.
You want Biden to lose, too :)
Why do leftists have to tear each other down if they disagree on this site? We all know trump sucks, biden sucks, and the system sucks, so let's change them!
Physically? Sure. Mentally? The guy has no idea where he is at any given time and couldn‚Äôt competently debate a toaster.   #DimBulbBiden
I cannot understand why they keep allowing him to do this. I mean...I'm glad because it helps Biden, but holy shit the people on his team allowing this are as dumb as he is.
I declare November 3 as maga day! Joe Biden gets elected! Maga!
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.
That's right. He's the President. Even though all of us ha e licking its on our free speech as a established by SCOTUS , he should be exempt he should have unlimited power. until Biden's president
He shld as long as he can remain calm, cool, &amp; collected while trump hurls insults &amp; starts name calling. #Biden needs 2 come across as the level-headed leader that he is. W/ a good moderator 2 keep trump in check, my hope is he'll whine and walk off the stage. #TrumpleThinSkin
Facebook removes pro-Trump ad aimed at Joe Biden, claiming false information  #FoxNews
She is a Patriot. President Biden should pardon her as one of his first acts. Horrible injustice, as the corrupt traitor she blew the whistle on sits in the Oval Office #FreeRealityWinner
This is why Biden shouldn‚Äôt agree to a debate
In an interview on Fox News, Jill Biden confirms that Joe Biden WILL debate Trump in the fall.
The vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that's more attuned to gender and racial biases.
Politicians these days...
So, Dr Jill Biden is about to go on Dana Perinos show on Fox...  No one questions or thinks it odd that Joe, the actual candidate, does no interviews, but his wife does them for him?  WTF, is going on?  Seriously, WTF?
you like to mock Biden when he slips up. This is a real stumble for your dear old dad
They are trying to blame Obama and Biden now
If Biden and the Democrats try to avoid the Presidential debates, Trump should Retweet this video every 46 minutes until Election Day.
Keep doing these interviews!! It helps Biden, when you‚Äôre seen floundering trying to BS your way through a terrible situation, which your not taking leadership over üëç
Democrats Say Russia Funneling Anti-Biden Info Through GOP Senator's Committee....WHY IS RON JOHNSON ALWAYS CONNECTED TO THIS RUSSIA DISINFORMATION...

Joe Biden is the Democratic Candidate for the President  of the United  States.  How could that ever  happen and how could anyone vote for him.  Mass Delusion Syndrome is real.
BIDEN 2020. HE DOESNT WANT YOU DEAD.
He's scared he'll lose and be carted off to prison.  He knows Biden won't pardon him.
Don‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt care about beating trump. I cared about beating trump ever since he wanted the Central Park 5 executed fora crime they didn‚Äôt commit.  Don‚Äôt do that. I lived through those times.  I just told you, I will pick anybody to beat the ASS.
Exactly just vote.
Ok. So if it‚Äôs not Karen Bass, you are not voting? That‚Äôs funny, because I bet you that even if  doesn‚Äôt pick Karen Bass, Karen Bass will vote for  You can repeat 2016 if you want, I can‚Äôt do 4 more years of #MAGA and this fucked up
Me to people that constantly critize Joe Biden but did nothing in the primary to make sure he wasn‚Äôt nominee
My thoughts are that at some point it isn‚Äôt going too b Biden,it‚Äôs going too b Cuomo! I think that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs gotten away with sending thousands too die and not ben held accountable!
"Why Biden Won‚Äôt Find His Biden" by Lisa Lerer via NYT
Tell Joe Biden: Make Abortion Access for All* A Top Priority
I don‚Äôt like this. My biggest problem with the Trump flags is the cult of personality associated with it is often seen in fascism. While this clearly is not designed to encourage cult of personality for Biden, it‚Äôs wrong for Trump to have this, and its wrong for Biden too.
I love how Epstein‚Äôs flight logs were released and Trump was nowhere to be found on them. But for some reason Biden was?
Good on ya, Now get, the candidate, Biden, to give me ten reasons to vote for him that are not, "I'm not Trump" and Maybe i'll consider not Voting for the Best Candidate, Howie Hawkins #VoteGreen, and instead #settleforBiden  All Biden really needs to do is support M4A, but won't
This is a good day we need to keep the president in office for 4 more years because Biden will just hurt us all.
So, now you're OK with Joe Biden after your impassioned words against him?
Or we could include candidates like  so that real issues are discussed. But the NYT would rather see no debates than expanded, robust democratic dialogue
I'm pulling for Karen Bass to be Biden's VP pick since she looks to be  the most progressive and least political of the lot.  What do you think?
Interesting that Rassmussen is also reporting that you are losing to Biden.  #BlueWave2020
Some of us in 2016 knew the type of immoral man Trump really is. But many of you refused to believe us. Now you know Trump is incompetent and corrupt.  So stay home or vote Biden.
Stocks hit all time highs under Obama/Biden too
You don't know what "buhahahahahaha" means? Good grief you're more dumbfounded than Google and Biden combined.
Then vote Biden,  bc Trump gives two shits about you.
Also, Trudeau, whom I like a lot, is in power because he drew in small c conservatives and despite the vote split to the NDP and Green.  None of those small c cons, like me, would identify with Republicans.  We do like Biden over Bernie

When is Joe Biden revealing his VP??!!! I‚Äôm excited üòä üòäüòäüòä
Because the Biden supporters are smart enough to stay alive and not engage in mass gatherings,  perhaps?
The poster asked for proof on Biden's stance change on the Hyde Amendment, so I provided it.  No one here claimed that Trump hasn't changed his views on abortion.
From your favorite left-wing media outlet:
Do you think that Harris is leaking this ambitious stuff or Biden? If it‚Äôs her I really like her
Obama, Pelosi, Schumer... And Biden is the final Jeopardy
Incorrect. The problem lies with the electoral college existing. Biden will win NY regardless of my vote &amp; honestly I'd rather vote my conscience. Hopefully in 2024 we'll have some decent candidates &amp; maybe not from one of the 1.5 party system.
Joe Biden is not going to pick a Black woman as his running mate this week because he will have a major heath crisis and the DNC will start looking at a new nominee.
So true.  Also, just listen to Joe Biden.
lol if they think 3 second clips of him saying yes/no to things (or simply saying 11 million undocumented) is somehow a clear affirmation of a policy standpoint, it‚Äôs over. Anyone in the middle who is on the fence about Trump or Biden won‚Äôt take away anything from these ads.
Biden won't debate because he can't have Jill holding flash cards for him like she does in the basement!
With 92 days until Election Day, here's what we're watching heading into a new week in the 2020 campaign:
Let‚Äôs not screw things up by squabbling over the VP pick! They are all talented/capable public servants that will give 150% to supporting Pres Biden in resurrecting our democracy!It is up to all of us to end this nightmare of these last 4 years&amp;this pandemic-US! US! ALL OF US!!!
Biden supporters were at work, bro.
So you put up a photo of failed Gubernatorial candidate Stacey Adams, who will also lose out on being Biden's VP pick despite her campaigning for the job for the last year? That's the black woman you chose to represent all black female politicians?  Got it.

No, not Trump or not. We can hold Biden accountable. You can't hold a despot accountable unless you're willing to die to murder him.
‚ÄúJoe Biden will close all the deli counters in the suburbs. No more Bologna for you!!‚Äù
do not vote for joe biden
True, but this election is nothing like I have seen in my lifetime. I am waiting like Indiana Jones and Last Crusade. If Biden doesn't pick wisely, he will fry up!!!
They may even come around to vote for Biden. What do they have to lose? Trump has already made them lose everything now.
From Bongino - Not a joke and not hyperbole - I‚Äôm hearing from people close to the situation that Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline is rapidly worsening and is becoming increasingly difficult to mask. The Democrats are going to have to make a decision soon.
How is it the opposite? In both states, the Democratic Senate challenger appears far ahead of the incumbent. And in both states, Biden and Trump are in a tighter race. How is that misogyny?
If Biden keeps up the do nothing strategy than we‚Äôre doomed but if we can get them on a stage together debating there‚Äôs hope.
Biden‚Äôs strategy of just doing nothing is working
Both candidates are hated tremendously and Biden is non threatening. Trump is agressive and unlikable to a neutral voter, also the polls are decently accurate 2016 was an anomaly that is unlikely to happen twice
Why wouldn't he? He'll be running the country again behind the scenes if Biden wins.  Oh, and also #BillClintonIsAPedo
No, I first came here to advertise my writing. Trump has me too stressed out to find the energy to write anything. I hope once we can get Biden elected I can go back to writing and advertising.

Joe Biden‚Äôs supporters seem nice. #JoeBiden #NYC #NYCProtests
I don‚Äôt get why Biden‚Äôs relative underperformance among Latinx voters isn‚Äôt getting more consideration. Seems like  would help and would probably deliver Senate seats in AZ &amp; CO and make TX, FL, GA more competitive for him.
Yes! We will! On November 3rd when Biden gets voted in!
I think you're spot on, my friend. It's all about getting this Godforsaken mess out of 1600, letting Joe do 4 years to clean up this shitshow, and positioning the VP to run in 2024.   Susan Rice is a powerhouse but I think Biden wants separation from the O admin.
Who's been factually proven to be a serial predator? Trump sure AF hasn't. Do you always assume allegations are pure fact? If so, Biden is factually a rapist as is Clinton. See how that works?

Obviously Trump, but definitely still believe Biden is privately homophobic. But he most likely won't make that into policy
No taxes on the rich, but I will write legislation for rhe GOP to make sure I'm not culpable for the 15k grandparents I killed and hike taxes on the poor. Id be MUCH better than Biden! Thanks for the support!
I don't think he'll have to decide. I think Trump will make  some excuse to back out. But, to answer your question, yes I am. Nothing will stop me from voting for Biden except death.

Every time politics comes up my dad tells the same story about the time Biden‚Äôs security detail blocked his rental car into a parking lot in Delaware in 1989. He gets angrier each time.

If Trump bans #TikTok I will quit my job and throw my entire being into the Biden campaign.   (For T&amp;P purposes this is mostly this is a joke.)   (Also, Trump threatened to ban TikTok to distract from the GDP and/or the GOP jumping ship on him and/or other massive failings.)
Yet somehow the Democrats bailed out Bush 41 and Bush 43 (both republicans) and now Biden will have to clean up the disaster you are leaving behind.  #fact #truth you and your entire family are nothing more than disastrous piles of crap

Sir, you speak truth; However, don‚Äôt confuse or use this as an example as to why we should vote 4 Donald Duck. Honestly, Trump nor Biden understands the complexity of Black citizens struggling in Amerikkka under Repugs &amp; DemoCRATS. But I think Amerikkka getting ready to learn.
I‚Äôve been surprised by how much the MSM didn't ignore Biden's latest gaffe. I guess there are some news directors &amp; editors having second thoughts about him
The bottom line is Biden can say whatever he wants and the vast majority of black voters don‚Äôt care. His actual history is repulsive considering the black community. But he is a democrat.
Eric Trump will be crying on November 4th once Joe Biden becomes the winner. ‚úåÔ∏è
The Trump campaign needs to stop the Biden has dementia stuff. They are bringing this attention to themselves.  It's just dumb they are both men of a certain age we get it. Can we not have a race to the bottom?
Imagine working for Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign and having to constantly do damage control because he believes black people are all the same. Must be tiring.
One of Donnys lowest statements. And that‚Äôs saying so much.  Great response from Biden
at least Trump writes his own crazy tweets during his morning shits. Biden said what he meant and some 23 year old translated the explanation on Twitter. Don‚Äôt fall for it.
That‚Äôs Joe Biden does think black and minorities are sub human you couldn‚Äôt be more correct. He does top Trump in that
And African Americans come from...America, Britain, Africa, Nigeria, Haiti, Jamaica, Trinidad, so you trying to make that argument about what Biden meant is ridiculous.

can get caught in motel 6 with 8 midgets 7 sheep 50 chickens a few ducks a donkey and a cow passed out and i would vote for Biden. I'm really Black. Not a sell out to my people and I would never vote for trump who called for the execution of innocent Black children
Trump is all I need. He keeps talking....guaranteed Biden
I don‚Äôt think Peter was putting his affiliation on his sleeve. The POTUS just said that Biden is against God. First off, who says that? Second, that‚Äôs rich coming from a man who has committed infidelity in every relationship he‚Äôs ever had.

Biden narrows VP choice down to two Black women
Hey, can‚Äôt we replace Biden as candidate ? How can he continue to make such stupid statements ?! Why didn‚Äôt he stick to saying that Hispanics are a diverse group- Puerto Rican‚Äôs, Dominicans, Mexicans etc. He makes so many misstatements that the Republicscum masses jump on.
the anti-christ himself is saying joe biden is "against god" ü§£ü§£ü§£ worst part is that some of these dumbasses believe him.
What happened with Biden picking a VP early this week? Is the VP pick hiding in a basement to? The democrat party is a total mess.
If Juan wasn't there just think who would tell us what a good Catholic Biden is ?
if mr Biden is such a good catholic how come he is so in favor of abortion and why are there so many videos of him fondling young people
Please join New York for Biden on Saturday, August 15th from 3pm to 4:30pm for a Unity Rally! Space is limited! Register today via this link:
Have you heard Trump speak? "Big water", "man woman elephant", "injecting disinfectant", praising the Charlottesville bigots, not disvowing KKK support....? If that is competence, I will take Biden's incompetence.
Wow it‚Äôs sad that all Biden has to offer us as our President is a politically correct Vice President choice. He should pick Beyonc√© or Oprah they would bring in more votes!
"I will see your 'black people aren't diverse' and raise you 'Biden will hurt God.'".  Thanks for such a great choice #Republicans and #Democrats
you keep spilling the same shit day after day! Please , PLEASE tell us , everyone what Biden or anyone else you like would have done differently in a PANDEMIC -historical - 100 years!
someone posted that you would be voting for Biden knowing your closeness to the Bush family please say it is not true.
Joe Biden is completely lost
I saw whole clip..BIDEN IS LIVING IN 1950
Racist Joe at it again I‚Äôm starting to loose faith in people he‚Äôs disrespected blacks and minorities in just about every way and still expects 100% of their votes. Time to say no to the real racist Joe Biden exhauslted Cyclopes kk?
U‚Äô Go Joe Biden, God Bless and God speed.
So you‚Äôre voting for Kanye? Not voting for Biden is like voting for tRUMP. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Someone said that THIS IS the conversation. Well, someone needs to tell Biden, THIS IS the cognitive test. What EXACTLY was his answer when asked about taking such a test? #MyGod. #NONEOfTheAbove4REAL! WOW! YK ##?? #MYTIME
Being like Joe Biden
It is very cruel of you. Biden grew up as a stutterer. Considering this, he has come a long way. Everyone of us have something to overcome. You should post an apology.

I just had a crazy idea... What if the announcement is she‚Äôs resigning to be Biden‚Äôs VP?
Vote Biden; we need a avalanche of votes for Biden. We need PEACE.
Not a surprise. Biden was picked so Obama can control him.
Where's the line? I'm there. For those people who aren't sure, just make believe that Joe Biden is the latest iPhone.
Ha! Good one . Hidin‚Äô Biden. Lollll
What about Biden ? Why he don‚Äôt speak ? Is he ok ? What about your brother who make the death rate for the virus 800% more than other state
Reba release of who Biden picks I am should not matter look at the criminal the in humane criminal in the whites house and his swamp ? Are you kidding me people rather news pundits !
Compared to Biden, he is Sherlock Holmes
LMAO- can't get Russia‚Äôs help because of mail-in voting? Use Kanye West to take away black voters from Biden
How come no one's complaining and seeing racial and sexual discrimination,  when Biden only picking his VP by race and color(woman and black) It's illegal on any jobs..it's the law..Democrats don't follow their own laws..
Obama and Biden had 8 years to make Black voters lives better. Why didn‚Äôt they?They don‚Äôt give a shit about the black voters or any other voters. They only care about doing nothing and making a lot of money stealing from hard working taxpayers. They make corrupt deals with China
...Biden? Shit i fucked it
I think Joe Biden just said ‚ÄúDefund the Police‚Äù
Speaking as someone that absolutely hated Clinton as a candidate and voted for her anyway, this feels like the right answer. Biden is more palatable that Clinton but that's a horrendously low bar.
In other words is #biden and are #Democrats saying they wouldn't have locked down? Or are they really that transparent when it comes to bald-faced lies? Third option: they think we are as stupid as rocks.   My guess is the second.
#Biden can barely speak normally much less come up with a plan to fight #COVID__19 . The same could be said of #Trump. You know who I trust to be our leader?
I‚Äôm attending The National Education Association‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúVirtual Town Hall with Jill Biden &amp; NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garc√≠a‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #StrongPublicSchools
Did Biden write that?
He didn‚Äôt show up to a Fox News debate on republicans. Biden has shown up to every debate as VP
You are a dope Jack. Wake up, do you think Biden is going to be flying commercial sitting next to crying babies?
Joe Biden was Barack Obamas VP. He doesn‚Äôt need exposure.   He‚Äôs not a radical.  Just old.  Trump is old, an extreme right fascist dictator wannabe and a lunatic.  His debate on F&amp;F this morning was incredible.
Biden agreed to debates case close .
During this virus? Are you really going to Hillary didn't go to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin this? People are dying. Thank you Joe Biden for not having someone knock at my door during Coronavirus you got my vote anyway.
Unless Barr indicts Biden, if he is the Dem candidate, what could he possibly do to persuade someone not to vote for Biden or to vote for Trump? So what if he indicts Comey, Yates, McCabe, Strzok, Page &amp; Rosenstein?
This story is terrifying for anyone who thinks Biden has this locked down.
Joe Biden WILL beat Trump like a DRUM, Mrs. Krassenstein! Unlike the orange Nazi in the White House, Biden will stand strong &amp; speak FULL TRUTH to the American people! Like Biden himself, I cannot wait to see him tear Adolf Trump to SHREDS!
Seriously???? I know now for sure your not listening to Joe Biden.
#Biden2020 may win. But his campaign is a train wreck and so is he.
Adam Schiff must have the put his file he had on the Russian collusion with Joe Biden‚Äôs files at the Delaware university basement. Maybe the DOJ or FBI can help find all that info he had. Maybe they should conduct a early morning raid. Democrats are so Fu-king corrupt.
You have to be very Special to say you are voting for Biden when he can‚Äôt even speak coherently. How can this man speak to world leaders and try to make deals? We have a great President right now that just needs majority congress and senate to get more done to help Americans.
Its Biden who wouldn't make sense
Was Joe Biden also responsible for drafting a law prevents you from eating a baguette and a brioche.
Jill Biden promises her husband will debate Trump this fall, is 'close' to choosing running mate   I hope he gets a good nights sleep
Why has all this hunter biden stuff been forgotten?
Has dana perino interviewed Melania? Why mrs. Biden? So she can state his case..again??
So basically, try to elect Biden on the blind
Still waiting for your response, regarding a Biden initiative to register young Black and brown activists, marking across the country for change. It would be a travesty if they are not registered to VOTE on November 3rd. This is doable. Campaign staffer during Obama's first run.
There is no chance that whoever is making the pick, we know it‚Äôs not Biden, will pick
ZERO #empathy from a complete #Narcissist. I don‚Äôt care what negatives #Biden may have. They are not this.  If #Trump had been #POTUS after 9/11, he would have been complaining about the traffic delays in NYC due to search and rescue.  That‚Äôs how he sees the world, thru a mirror!
Yes and after demanding trump's taxes , which is a privacy issue for all Americans,  let's see Biden and family how they enriched themselves
Look at the deaths, same population. DeSantis prevented infected going into nursing homes. Imagine hating Trump so much you‚Äôd rather have a sick paedophile in office. You really don‚Äôt care about kids, or Biden‚Äôs Ukraine corruption because you have hate bro

I mean I hope whoever is making the decisions for Biden picks her

Please ask Jill Biden why her husband won‚Äôt do the interview with Chris Wallace ty
Will you for once, stop taking about what you think Biden will do, and focus on what YOU should be doing!
What happened to Hunter Biden? Is he in a bunker or at his job in Ukraine?  It‚Äôs funny how Fake news media love to hide the crimes of democrats. Vote Republican MAGA TRUMP 2020 KAG
What can civilian Biden do? How about your Trump fellow? He can invite people to WH and perform his usual do nothing plan.
Sharpton what the Hell did u and Obama and Biden do for Chicago I‚Äôll tell u S- - t!
Hoping for this news:  Biden Harris an unbeatable team..
Well Chump, laying down and rolling over  for Schumer and the Hag, yet again!  Let's bail out all the Dem states and municipalities, pension funds and then go for Biden's Plan (he'll be POTUS by then.  Adios!
If Biden refuses to debate he will lose the election. It will look like he is scared.  Bottom line .
This is unbelievable they know Biden has dementia
Running an entire campaign on just the strong anti-Trump sentiment out there can take you a long way. But for the Biden campaign, it‚Äôs gone as long as it can go. Unless they can drum up actual enthusiasm FOR Biden among at least 25% of the voters, this car is out of gas
And I‚Äôm willing to bet Biden‚Äôs name recognition is lower than any Dem nominee at this point in the race... which is incredible for a former 2-term VP
Democrat leaders &amp; their media supporters talk so much about Trump &amp; so little about Biden, that at this late stage in the process there‚Äôs a legitimate risk that a million of their voters will accidentally vote for Trump on Election Dsy because that‚Äôs the only name in their heads
Kamala Harris will attract Indian and Black votes and she is a kickass Ex AG and super Senator. Hands down, she is the best choice for VP
Biden has a speech impediment that makes it hard for him to formulate the right words for his thoughts on the spot.
He should debate Biden
So ready to elect the #Biden administration to get this country on a better track. I'm ready for competence and decency! #Biden2020 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #TeamPeteForJoe

Listen to "8/3/2020" by Derek Varsalona ‚öì  The Democrats Don't want Joe Biden to debate. They know too well that Joe Biden will get manhandled by President Donald Trump. Listen to my take.
Joe Biden just needs to be good enough. And he is.
You can‚Äôt debate a liar. Never can win against someone who will say anything. Good move by Biden to not debate. Won‚Äôt change anyone‚Äôs mind. #Debate
And this relates to Biden sexually discrimination how? Stupid person.
How about one reason to vote for Biden. He will pick the most qualified people to run the government, not his deadbeat cronies.
I saw one. ‚Äúnever biden‚Äù
wouldn‚Äôt know what truth is.  You are just afraid that #Biden will get his ass handed to him because he is incompetent.
Things to consider...2nd phase of COVID  so we can‚Äôt vote in a booth, Biden will be replaced by Pelosi, Killary, or Sanders, Antifa obstructing voting, when Trump wins more Antifa riots,..things to do..get a gun, vote for Trump, hunker down or join Patriots in the streets

Anyone that votes for Biden has no love for this country and wants us to go down in flames
Biden's picks for VP should be one theses 3 , Rice or Ms Obama or Warren. As for Harris,  SCOTUS.

Y‚Äôall be militantly voting for Biden ‚Äúbecause he isn‚Äôt trump‚Äù but no one talks about Lyndon b Johnson or Harry Truman. Like lmao cnn really has y‚Äôall brainwashed like this orange dude is worse than Hitler.
I think a good portion of the country believes those fairy tales, but not enough to even get one party past Joe Biden.
Biden should debate Trump, if and only if, there are fact checkers nearby!
I'm ready to call our sister in the movement for justice Madam Vice President Kamala Harris (opinion) - CNN
Howie,  #Biden made his decision because #KamalaHarris is a perfect #Corporatist hack.  #BernieSanders sold out a long time ago to become a sheepdog for the Democratic Establishment.  You are trying to voter shame his supporters. Well, that's their decision not Bernie.
Trump, Trying to distract from  what you "should" be doing, rather than trying to  guess what Joe Biden will do. Put down your crystal ball and get to work. On reducing the number of souls lost from the Coronavirus. Have you forgotten? You are still the  captain of this ship.
Classic Trump.Making perceived  allegations about what Biden " will do" . Instead let's hear about what you are doing on behalf of those suffering every   single day. Never heard you speak about souls  lost, as "people". You call them " numbers". 150,000 loved ones.
So you favor discrimination and not even interviewing the best possible candidates? That‚Äôs your stand? If Biden said he was only considering a man and not even interviewing a woman would that be ok? I‚Äôd say no. You?
If Biden wins in November, imagine the inauguration.  Who would even want the gross Trump family there??
Biden needs to say that. A lot. And loud
Trump is thinking g about postponing 2020 election. CV-19 is not going away like the Republican party wish it would. Vote Biden.
Unlike  Trump Joe, Biden demonstrates empathy for the people who are mourning the lose of 150,000 families. Trump has an inability to show concern for anyone other than himself. Trump plays the victim at all times. We will escort him out of the back door of the White House.
And this is supposed to discourage me from voting for Biden? Nice try, asshole, but Adolf Trump is STILL going down in November!
#Biden should give  a Presidential Medal of Honor at the #StateoftheUnion next year!  Maybe take back #Rush‚Äôs at the same time.
Yes, we must elect Biden
Joe Biden‚Äôs Costly, Radical Race and Gender Agenda
In every Presidential election year their have been debates by those politicians running. It looks like this is going to be the first election with no debates thanks to the scared Joe Biden and the fake news media that is protecting this weak democrat candidate.

Chris Wallace challenges Biden to follow Trump on 'Fox News Sunday,' says ex-VP must 'get into game shape'
Yet stu you will vote for Biden who was mentored by his very good friend kkk grand wizard Robert Byrd. That‚Äôs perfectly normal. Just say it you don‚Äôt like trump.
What white supremacist did this? Biden? Jillian can take her act elsewhere. The nhl players did what they thought was right in unity. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt like it has the option to not watch. Is every from of support need to be disliked by the president? Who is not a WS.
This guy needs to stay home like Biden
Another failed tweet from a person that wants to be just like Biden...
You are so busy looking for ways to discredit Biden, (who you fear) that you cannot focus on the biggest crisis facing our country the Coronavirus. Remember this number, 150,000 families who are mourning loved ones. What have you done for them lately?
Karen Bass, Susan Rice Rise As Biden's Search for V.P. Nears End
So long ago, I would defend my classmates from getting teased.  BULLIES suck. Vote Biden
Biden or Trump. Who's Better for the Market?
The MSM truly are ‚Äúthe enemy of the people‚Äù! They lie, distort, are rude, disrespectful &amp; don‚Äôt cover any positive news on Pres Trump &amp; are only interested in destroying Pres &amp; his administration while asking Biden what‚Äôs his favorite flavor ice cream? Real hard ball questions
94 days until Election Day. Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt want to have any debates. How can you vote for someone if you don‚Äôt know what he stands for? He only helped himself and his family for the past few decades. He pressured Ukraine into dropping charges on his corrupt son. Vote Red
So all of a sudden you care that our people are safe? Really? Interesting how it‚Äôs so close to election time and now your so worried. It wouldn‚Äôt have anything to do with the fact that you are trailing Biden in the polls sooooo badly right? Go back to building buildings!
Shy Biden supporters for sure /s
Oh thats rich. What a comedian Duh Biden is
A moot point. Pence won't be in the Biden Administration. When Trump loses, he will blame Pence. Pence will be thrown under the bus. He will join other folks already under the bus.
Odds on #Biden getting Covid right before the debates and bowing out? Any takers?
He made his own decision.  No wonder you are fans of Biden.  #morons
Donny,  this is what I am thinking, you and Mikey resign. You defect to Russia,  and Mikey becomes a pharma spokesperson.  Biden Klobuchar run as the republican nominees, and Warren/Harris run as the democratic nominee.
Joe Biden has the whole left wing media to tweet for him. No need to tweet himself.
You‚Äôre exactly right. Oregon is a great model. But there are too many states who are implementing this too late. There‚Äôs still a chance everything goes smooth and better than i expect. But this is potentially the biggest threat to Biden‚Äôs chances.
Biden Proposes Free Tuition To HBCUs, Student Debt Cancellation For Alum
I vote my conscience, and in a normal election I wouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden because he‚Äôs against many things I support. At the same time, Trump is just so unbelievably toxic to this country, and we don‚Äôt have high quality options for the presidency. Whatever it takes.
Obama is a real son of a b**ch. I heard his eulogy...or was he ghost running for Biden, with his lies, bullcrap, and agenda
I deeply miss having an ACTUAL president in the White House, Lea Thompson...not some child-man who needs a diaper change every two minutes. Thankfully, we'll get that again when we elect Joe Biden in the White House this coming November.
No but I‚Äôve been called twice to vote for Biden and I‚Äôm a registered republican. Anyone else ?
2020 Election Live Updates: Republicans Reject Trump‚Äôs Suggestion to Delay Election, Something He Cannot Do
I wonder how many will vote for him anyway
Worst case I think is enough GOP governors bag the elections in their states to prevent Biden from getting to 270, then GOP-majority state congressional delegations in reinstall Trump, with scotus upholding
2/ ... like keeping their nominee hidden, nixing a real convention, &amp; likely avoiding any Biden-Trump debates. So when your opponents are engineering a pretty strong strategy of destroying the rules, it‚Äôs a great idea to suggest breaking some too...

Spoiler alert? Kamala Harris may have been outed as Joe Biden's V-P pick, United States News &amp; Top Stories - The Straits Times- I‚Äôm really hoping it‚Äôs true üòÄ
Step up Mr. Biden show us how your plan should go. Show us how you would do things differently in a plague across the world üåé in our lifetime we have never seen such a virus be so unpredictable like this virus .
I think this VP choice is most impactful because if Biden does only run for a single term the VP is going to probably be the de facto Nominee in 2024.
Biden has a unique opportunity to CONNECT  with young Black and brown activists marching for change. It would be a travesty if they are not registered to VOTE on November 3rd, for Biden. It seems that this age group  do not feel that Biden addresses their concerns. This is doable
In one story I read, Barr said he was disappointed at how little interest the public has in his investigation. I can‚Äôt imagine any Dem not voting for Biden even if Comey, McCabe, Yates &amp; Strzok were all indicted. Barr could end up w a lot of egg on his face....Yep. We‚Äôre good. Nothing to worry about here. Grandpa Biden will bring us right back to 1969, the last year he remembers clearly.
I can see where she's coming from. No matter who Biden selects, some will be happy while others critical. Maybe this is just a way to remind people the two would lead as a team. Unlike what we've been seeing now where Pence is a silent, complicit puppet.
It is laughable that Biden gets criticized for a miss characterized statement when trump makes  insane statements on a hourly basis!

No what is ridiculous is 90 days before an election, republican donors and presidents allies are trying to get Kanye West on the ballot in states he‚Äôs narrowly losing.   Trying to take votes from Biden with a candidate that everyone knows won‚Äôt reach 270 electoral votes?
At times, I don‚Äôt think either major party candidate really wants to win. The Dem VP thing is so hard because right after the convention, the DNC is going to replace Biden. He‚Äôs going to fail some fitness test or other, and he‚Äôs going to get replaced.
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúLeague 46 and LGBTQ+ for Biden: An Out for Biden Event feat. Dr. Jill Biden and Chasten Buttigieg‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Biden is a disaster and has always been one of the dumbest people of politics, but in a rare moment of coherence he reveals how much he and the Democrats take the black community for granted. His handlers then spent hours apologizing for his idiocy.
Imagine thinking Joe Biden was actually radical enough to do something this hahahahaha
The Russians also have gotten control of Joe Biden‚Äôs meds
I asked someone to explain the difference between Biden &amp; Trump to me and, apparently, I offended them so greatly they couldn‚Äôt. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Make no mistake about it. Joe Biden won‚Äôt be picking his own VP. He‚Äôll pick whoever the DNC tells him to pick.
Every single thing that is plaguing urban communities, and every problem with American Law Enforcement, from civil asset forfeiture, mass incarceration, the drug war, militarization of police &amp; the prison industrial complex, are all from the pen of Joe Biden.
After Biden‚Äôs racist remarks does Obama disavow him?
Hey while we're on the subject How will Biden hurt God? Seems impossible by any definition of God. Shows how "religious" your guy is .
This man is racist, if you don‚Äôt think so 1.) you obviously never pay attention to real politics 2.)Mr.Braindead on desegregation, ‚ÄúFormer U.S. Vice President Joe Biden once said he didn't want his kids to grow up in a "racial jungle‚Äù  #DrJoeJorgensen2020
This FOOL is confused as fuck. He knows he's gonna lose so every LIE he can catch, it's useful to him. One of these days, he's gonna say " Don't vote for Joe Biden because he doesn't like golf and he will hurt my boss Vladimir Putin"! I don't know if I should cry or laugh tbh!
Um [not that it should matter] Biden isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwithout religion‚Äù you lying twit (Trump, not  she‚Äôs the bee‚Äôs knees!), he‚Äôs a devout Catholic. G-d will be just fine. If G-d can handle the human poopstain that is you, a decent, thoughtful, kind old man like Biden is cake.
What gain, Mr. President, saying your opponent is "against God", while assailing Catholicism?   PS Do you think God likes you, Mr President?   PPS Do you think God knows  you are using God to scare folks?         #RegisterToVote2020

Ngl, this suddenly makes me like Biden... üò∂
Biden should not consider debating trump! It's a non starter! A fools errand at best!
Don't like this Kanye West thing to take enough votes from Biden in key swing states. The Jill Stein of 2020!
Biden will not debate trump!
Biden should not consider debating trump! You can't debate insanity!
Biden should only agree to debate if Trump first releases his tax returns and other financial records. Trump will not ‚Äúdebate‚Äù anyway and get up there and lie and spew nonsense like he usually does...
President Biden will appoint an attorney general and fill inspector general positions. Those people will need to determine if or how quickly to pursue this. Unlike Trump, I don‚Äôt see Biden micro-managing random things because he will have a qualified cabinet.
I like how she cites "Biden's VP black women pick" as if no matter whp he picks will be drunk with power just because she is a black woman
really thought they were gonna go for the William Henry Harrison route with Biden and just let him die of Covid right after finding a Vice President capable of uttering a full sentence but I guess they're just gonna do a whole zoom call thing
Omg what a nut job.  ‚ÄúHey man‚Äù That‚Äôs all Biden can say.
I am very honored to once again be chosen as a Bernie Sanders delegate to the Democratic Nat‚Äôl Convention. Like Bernie, we support Joe Biden, but beating Trump is not enough. We need to leave post-Reagan economics behind and renew the promise of the New Deal.
And one debate for every deal Biden made with China to make his incompetent son Hunter super rich!  My God we will need more than a couple months worth of debates!
Physically? Sure. Mentally? The guy has no idea where he is at any given time and couldn‚Äôt competently debate a toaster.   #DimBulbBiden
I declare November 3 as maga day! Joe Biden gets elected! Maga!
That's right. He's the President. Even though all of us ha e licking its on our free speech as a established by SCOTUS , he should be exempt he should have unlimited power. until Biden's president
He shld as long as he can remain calm, cool, &amp; collected while trump hurls insults &amp; starts name calling. #Biden needs 2 come across as the level-headed leader that he is. W/ a good moderator 2 keep trump in check, my hope is he'll whine and walk off the stage. #TrumpleThinSkin
She is a Patriot. President Biden should pardon her as one of his first acts. Horrible injustice, as the corrupt traitor she blew the whistle on sits in the Oval Office #FreeRealityWinner
So, Dr Jill Biden is about to go on Dana Perinos show on Fox...  No one questions or thinks it odd that Joe, the actual candidate, does no interviews, but his wife does them for him?  WTF, is going on?  Seriously, WTF?
you like to mock Biden when he slips up. This is a real stumble for your dear old dad
They are trying to blame Obama and Biden now
If Biden and the Democrats try to avoid the Presidential debates, Trump should Retweet this video every 46 minutes until Election Day.
BIDEN 2020. HE DOESNT WANT YOU DEAD.
My thoughts are that at some point it isn‚Äôt going too b Biden,it‚Äôs going too b Cuomo! I think that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs gotten away with sending thousands too die and not ben held accountable!
Also, Trudeau, whom I like a lot, is in power because he drew in small c conservatives and despite the vote split to the NDP and Green.  None of those small c cons, like me, would identify with Republicans.  We do like Biden over Bernie
Do you think that Harris is leaking this ambitious stuff or Biden? If it‚Äôs her I really like her
Incorrect. The problem lies with the electoral college existing. Biden will win NY regardless of my vote &amp; honestly I'd rather vote my conscience. Hopefully in 2024 we'll have some decent candidates &amp; maybe not from one of the 1.5 party system.
Joe Biden is not going to pick a Black woman as his running mate this week because he will have a major heath crisis and the DNC will start looking at a new nominee.
Let‚Äôs not screw things up by squabbling over the VP pick! They are all talented/capable public servants that will give 150% to supporting Pres Biden in resurrecting our democracy!It is up to all of us to end this nightmare of these last 4 years&amp;this pandemic-US! US! ALL OF US!!!
Ours are when he's finally locked up for all the death, destruction &amp; unnecessary pain he has caused to countless Americans. Thank you Joe Biden for coming to save us all from this madman!
Enter Hillary? Remains to be seen. One thing is clear though, Biden is not competent to serve.
Puh LEEZ! We don‚Äôt GAF how long it takes or who it is or anything!  It‚Äôs Biden or this country is TOTALLY and IRREVOCABLY FUCKED.  We know you all have to have something to write about. Choose more wisely please.
Hate and division. TRUMP.  Love and cooperation.  BIDEN.
Trump needs it more than Biden he should use to his advantage and only debate if Trump releases his tax returns as well as medical records. Americans deserve to know!
If Biden is a shoe in like you say then why would his VP pick matter?
Joe Biden‚Äôs supporters seem nice. #JoeBiden #NYC #NYCProtests
I don‚Äôt get why Biden‚Äôs relative underperformance among Latinx voters isn‚Äôt getting more consideration. Seems like  would help and would probably deliver Senate seats in AZ &amp; CO and make TX, FL, GA more competitive for him.
Which is another reason I‚Äôm not voting for Biden and either writing in Bernie or voting 3rd party. Our system sucks and I‚Äôm no represented and I refuse to play along.
It's too late, we are now a shithole country. The best we can hope for is Trump's replacement by Joe Biden! The fear is how much further down the shithole we fall with what happens between Nov. 3rd and Jan. 20th!
he doesn't give a damn about the health/safety of the general population or healthcare workers. The challenge is to find a way to "workaround" IMPOTUS and the co-conspiratorial GOP Senate. Absent that nothing good will happen til Joe Biden's inauguration
Donald Trump a rapist! Bill Clinton a rapist! What more can I say?! Biden rapist!
‚Äúi aint joe budden i aint joe biden, in in colorful clothes so its no hidin‚Äù - me 2012
The choice between Biden and Individual 1 couldn‚Äôt be clearer.
Yup. Biden will take the state because of the dumb electoral college &amp; I get to vote with conviction. If I lived in a swing state I'd hold my nose &amp; vote Biden
Biden will push for clean energy, creating millions of jobs in the solar, hydro and wind turbine industries!!!
Whoa, whoa. Why the hate? Nobody attacked you. But if I lived in a swing state I'd hold my nose and vote for a Dem for the 1st time ever. Literally anyone is better than Trump. Joe Biden, Joe Budden, Joe Montana, Joe Mantegna. Anyone.
Barr needs to be arrested and prosecuted under a Biden Administration.
Perhaps Biden should disband DHS entirely when he takes over in January. Certainly disband the corrupt and rancid Border Patrol.
Yes. You're correct. I already said he's piggybacking off the Obama lovefest. Biden name drops him constantly to get the black vote. It's not a mystery.
I'll deal in facts. Believe me, on Nov 4th I'll be the most vocal Biden hater out there. Unfortunately he's our only hope
Oh I can't vote in primaries. And don't fool yourself, the GOP and DNC pick who they want. They thought Hillary was more "electable" and feel Biden can just piggyback off the Obama lovefest. Just hope it doesn't cost us again.
I will. And thankfully in my state don't have to hold my nose &amp; vote for Biden.
Did I hear you use Biden terminology? üòÇ You said MALARKY.... ‚ù§Ô∏èIt!
Did I just hear you use a BIDEN term????? Did you just say Malarky?üòÇ  ‚ù§Ô∏è it!
Well in my state the dumb Electoral College is guaranteed to go Biden so I can vote 3rd party with no ill effect.
Fair enough. I'm just lucky to live in a state where my vote doesn't really count so I won't have to hold my nose &amp; vote Biden.
That's BS. Totally depends what state you live in because of the electoral college. In NY I have that luxury. In a swing state I'd hold my nose &amp; vote for sniffy Biden.
isnt it more likely that this is just a rhetorical strategy to cover the gop's ass in the event of a loss so they can claim that biden won due to fraud and impeach him over it?  both parties are just 24/7 grievance politics, meanwhile the rest of us just want healthcare
To be fair it's not like Joe Biden was ever vice president with clear ambitions of being president.
Yeah it's truly sickening...I hope Biden campaign just keeps drilling down he does not want to defund police.... This is all Trump is has got. Scare tactics &amp; playing on racial fears. We are at a time of racial Justice/reconing &amp; growth and this man is truly a monster!
And honestly, given all the criminality, dementia and blatant racism of trump, what the heck could they put on Biden to equal that?
That would be one more days work than Joe Biden has done
Richard Nixon. Lyndon Johnson. Fritz Mondale. George Bush. Al Gore.John Edwards. Paul Ryan. Joe Biden. Kamala Harris. One of these things is not like the other can you tell which one
Isn't Tlaib the one who refuses to endorse Biden?

Yeah I've been speaking to a lot of my friends about it. None of my rational friends who were non-voters -&gt; Biden are considering it.  But a lot of my tin foil friends are with it.
Stupid people have to vote for Biden because that's what they're told to do.
I'm still not giving another penny to the Biden campaign until the VP announcement. Text me for a $20 then.

I could have told you this 4 years ago but I am glad you guys are catching up.  I'm not saying Joe Biden has all the answers but he will restore dignity, leadership, ethics, and compitency to the WH.  Trump has only brought chaos.
Biden needs to think thoroughly before speaking. He‚Äôs losing the Black votes.
The difference between Biden and trump, or at least one of the differences, is that Biden came out and apologized for the misunderstanding while trump‚Äôs people would be twisting themselves into pretzels trying to ‚Äúexplain‚Äù what trump meant.
I miss Jill Stein. Could you imagine her debating Biden and Trump on national TV? That shit would be a slaughter.

No need to worry though, the AFT is spending all their time and money on Biden right now
Did you hear when Trump said he didn't go to John Lewis's funeral because John Lewis didn't go to his speech? And did you hear Trump say that Trump has done more for black people than any other American ever, When asked about John Lewis?  Don't pretend Biden is as bad as Trump
Yes this guy who's been around for 50 yrs is a disgrace, a racist, spied on our President, a plagiarist, liar &amp; accused of rape. Biden may not make it to Nov. If your the slightest bit curious watch this-All Biden
Joe Biden is Supposedly Catholic But He Hasn‚Äôt Condemned Arson and Vandalism of Catholic Churches...and today champions almost unlimited abortion access as a presidential candidate
Let‚Äôs set something straight:  John Katko is a coward.  He‚Äôs out with a desperate attack on my friend  turning to JOE BIDEN to speak for him on healthcare.  1) John, am I hearing correctly? Did you flip-flop your endorsement of impeached, dishonorable Donald? #NY24
God bless Biden the guy in the White House is a disgrace attacking Biden about religion. This is the same man who is married 3 times grabbing women by the crotch and sleeping with a porn star really.
Love to see Joe Biden's actual quotations being used by my district's Republican candidate to prove the Democratic opponent is too radical. Fuckin a man.
Get a load of this guy. His campaign has so much contempt for black voters that they think they‚Äôll vote for Kanye instead of Biden just because he‚Äôs black.
Loser Trump, you're obsessed with both Obama and Biden because you cannot compete with either of them!! Since day one, you have been deathly jealous of President Obama and the Democrats!
To get the nomination Biden bowed to the radical abortion forces &amp; their $ that funds the DNC.  He abandoned any moderation for abortion on demand. His "faith" should acknowledge the science of fetal development and see that at minimum abortion by the 5th month is killing a life.
Biden will not be the nominee. That‚Äôs why he isn‚Äôt going to Milwaukee. It‚Äôs a head fake. The nominee will come off the floor
Wow Biden let us know how he feels, someone needs to tell him it‚Äôs time Joe you aren‚Äôt capable or prepared or cognitive or truthful or legitimate or...I could go on and on
Biden understands this, Trump doesn‚Äôt.

Joe Biden said all black people are the same, unlike the Latin community.  I heard him.  Don't forget if you don't vote for Biden then you ain't black either.  Gtfoh
C'mon Kentucky, you're failing us! Trump leads Biden in KY poll by 24%, McConnell led McGrath by 17% earlier this week. New poll has him up only 5% but you know he has a voter suppression plan. Where's Booker? He needs to get out the vote! Paging Booker!
There is no comparison. Trump is a complete douchebag. Biden is a very respectable man.
If you care at all about the exploitation of Kanye, vote for Joe Biden.
What the hell is wrong with you? Backing a guy on based on platitudes, who refuses to actually fix part that's fucked up. The policy itself. And the topic was healthcare itself. Backing Biden is backing the policies he keeps in place.
I'm normally not one to talk politics, but sometimes it just needs to be. A vote for Biden is a vote for civil war. Reference his stance on 2nd amendment and wanting to ban all guns except smart guns
He isn't coming around to it whatsoever, and he refuses to comment when asked on even lifting Trump's anti-trans medical policy. A policy designed only to get trans people killed by denying us access to healthcare. That's what you and Biden back.
I guess they don't realize that starting fires is a big deal, it can get out of control in no time. Also attacking police property is going to get you in trouble, no matter where you live. Actually, they might get off since their strategy is to wait for Biden to win.
Can someone  please explain to me why, out of this whole country, we have Trump or Biden? C‚Äômon people! These are our choices? I‚Äôll nominate my dog  #twilight zone #we‚Äôre screwed
If Biden wins in November I have some advice for antifa, blm activist and rioters across the country. Trump supporters will be out there looking for you. When they find you it won‚Äôt be pretty
I‚Äôd take China Over Russia. And I don‚Äôt think Chinese hookers have ever pissed on Biden
Where is the outrage from the Left? Can you imagine if  had said something similar? Oh the hypocrisy.   Shame on you Democrats for not denouncing  racist comments. #shameful    #FoxNews
Biden will not be the candidate. It‚Äôs a head fake
Never pictured Biden to be the one to dethrone God, but here we are. One well-placed haymaker ought to do it.
Biden will not be the candidate that‚Äôs why he isn‚Äôt going to Milwaukee
I bet Biden knows how to hold a Bible upright
Still don‚Äôt believe that the MSM is corrupt... Trump‚Äôs pronunciation of the word ‚ÄúThailand‚Äù is getting more coverage than Biden basically saying Black people share a brain...
Here's what really happened.
Have to cut Biden a little slack as he‚Äôs busy planning his war on God
That‚Äôs awesome stuff, I hate that SOB he‚Äôs got to go. Hate that Biden isn‚Äôt the answer we wanted but the one we are getting. We deserve better.
I didn't hear any "jive turkey 1970 tone" in that clip, not sure what you're referring to. Anyway, not sure why it's helpful to be so down on Biden when the Trump alternative is so repulsive.
I‚Äôve tried many a time to imagine Trump transitioning power over to Biden, like doing the presidential thing and sitting down with him to go over things‚Äî- I can‚Äôt do it. I can‚Äôt picture it.
The dirty little secret as to why Joe Biden feels free enough to say aloud that ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt Black‚Äù unless you vote for him or that Blacks lack diversity, is that as far as voting is concerned we‚Äôve never given Dems reason to worry about losing our vote before now.
You say Trump is racist but Biden constantly says racist things &amp; has throughout his career legislatively harmed Blacks. Like the 94 crime bill. Biden says all the things unsolicited that folks imagine Trump would say
We were talking about Biden‚Äôs comments on the merit of Biden. The fact that you felt the need to inject Trump into it is interesting to say the least. Trump has his issues, but that doesn‚Äôt make Joe‚Äôs unsolicited comments any less weird
Joe Biden has no policies yet. Only tRUMP does and they aren't working.
What exactly does what Biden said have to do with Trump? Even if Trump was unwell that doesn‚Äôt make the crazy things Biden says about Blacks less crazy
The media did their job. What‚Äôs funny is that Biden says unsolicited all the things the media imagines Trump says.
So Biden is a globalist and a radical leftist.
If on his journey, Joe Biden should encounter God, God will be cut.
Agreed. The states we live in (CA, NY) are Biden's anyway. Trump has to win TX, OH, PA, NC, AZ, and possibly one of WI or MN to win the election.
The only people who know about this is people on social media because the MSM won‚Äôt cover anything that makes Biden look bad. The ‚ÄòOrange Man Bad‚Äô crowd will forgive any crazy thing Biden says or does &amp; make excuses for his inactivity. The Dems are counting on this...
I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden backs fair housing, but go on.
I don't see how Trump's usual tactics are going to work this time.  Biden needs to cool off on the interviews. The less he stays in the spotlight the better.
Biden can't string together a sentence and this is newsworthy you idiots?
Rep. Karen Bass, is a racist as well, is from the Confederate Party (Democrats), and supports Joe Biden who says blacks as a whole, lack diversity, and all think alike; that's a license to hate and to spread division;  Fact check:  CNN hates the truth
RUSH: I'm gonna play two things for you. One happened back in 1987 on Nightline, the other one yesterday with Joe Biden.
Even if Biden wins he‚Äôs essentially guaranteed to be a one term president because he inspires nobody, won‚Äôt do much in office, and isn‚Äôt going to be the ‚Äúother guy‚Äù against a villain like 2020.
There is a very good possibility that Obama (and Biden) might be nailed in the Durham report. Some of their top people are expected to be indicted soon. He has to be careful. (The findings in the report may also make him a very flawed presidential candidate.)
The only rooms Biden seems capable of reading are the rooms within your local Elks lodge.
Well then Biden can‚Äôt be too sleepy then lol
Trump, warning that Biden is ‚Äúagainst energy‚Äù, points out that it was his administration that passed the First Law of Thermodynamics.
Cuomo-asks people "please come back to NY" Blasio- We will fine you if you don't lock yourself up for 10 days" NY AG-We will always try to take your 2nd amendment away Biden- Joe Biden can't stop saying INTERCOURSE during interviews
Biden needs to get ahead of this and secure the endorsement of Rex Morgan, M.D.
Biden is more powerful than god? Wow.
RUSH: He's saying that African-Americans are like-minded simpletons. This is as racist a comment as anything they want to try to lay off on us, folks.
Joe Biden will hurt God? Damn he is a BAD ASS!
Biden vs. God was the 2020 plot twist that I actually did see coming. Boom.
"And puppies... Biden hates cute puppies."

Biden will not be the nominee in Milwaukee that‚Äôs why he isn‚Äôt going. It‚Äôs a head fake. The nominee will come off the floor. I‚Äôm from the future trust me
Watch this-Biden caught &amp; he calls himself DUMB Truth-He's a liar, I do my research. The man is senile and a fraud
Biden will not be in Milwaukee because he will not be the candidate. It‚Äôs a head fake. The nominee will come off the floor. I‚Äôm from the future believe me
It seemed obvious to me. I mean, Biden is always clumsy, but I make this point literally every semester in my race and ethnicity class.
Ok. Let‚Äôs ask ourselves why the left is presenting Biden as a legitimate presidential candidate. It‚Äôs obvious he can‚Äôt do the job. So what‚Äôs the end game?  Is it a diversion to make trump focus his campaign against Biden when the real candidate will come off the floor
Is Joe Biden on Cocaine? ü§î
No, trump and biden are the same person morally and i dont see a smaller party winning
Ok hear me out, we run a dumbass against a dumbass. Could totally work. Maybe I could support Biden.
Between Joe Biden interviews &amp; attention seeking frivolous lawsuits like this, the Left is doing everything they can to turn America off. I haven‚Äôt even brought up the riots, er, peaceful protests
Is this real, did Joe Biden just say that Blacks are not capable of being diverse?
To think the Left &amp; the Media has spent the last 4 years looking for racism under every rock and all they had to do was put a microphone in front of Joe Biden. Such a time waste...
Here's a clip from Joe Biden in October
i 100% agree. it is going to pain me terribly to vote for biden but literally anyone is better than tr*mp at this point so you do what you have to do.
The President has had every part of his life investigated for the past 4 yrs. Good try-there is NOTHING. But we have Biden who was involved in a conspiracy to take down a duly elected President. We also have him shaking down the Ukraine President when he wanted prosecutor fired
Biden needs to be investigated, along with Comey,Obama, Rice Clapper, Hillary, Brennan &amp; Schiff. It's all out &amp; more is coming. Conspiracy to remove a duly elected President. It's all coming out-in their OWN words. NY AG is harassing the President. Biden is not immune
Still waiting to see Russian interference...says who? Hillary? Comey, Brennan, Rice, Clapper, Biden, Obama? Same ones that gave us phony dossier, FISA abuse, Russia Hoax. Ex CIA say our own ex CIA NSA broke into emails to get info out about corruption.
You mean we should wait until after elections to bring all of the lying from the Obama/Biden DOJ to justice? That it‚Äôs, all in the timing of it, who cares what laws were broken. Those have to wait until after Nov. 3rd. What a lame excuse. Crimes were committed, end of story!
Want to join me for this Joe Biden for President event?
Well, I'd agree with that in the abstract, but I did notice an epithet only on Biden, none on Trump.
"Haha you're mad over hundreds of thousands of people dying, homelessness and unemployment spiking, while leaders make these problems worse, while I don't care because I'm so great"  You have brainrot dude. Sucks you can't even get it treated with no healthcare thanks to Biden.
If Trump was given multiple cognitive exams it's because his doctor believed he showed signs of impairment.   Biden hasn't taken one because his doctor doesn't think he's showing signs of impairment.  This isn't rocket surgery.  #personwomanmancameratv
Biden all the way get you crazy people out of the White House
Just because you libs happily ignored the problems of marginalized people, and declared bigotry defeated before Trump, doesn't make that reality. Nazis and other hate groups have been an issue long before him, and will continue to be when you go back to ignoring them under Biden.
Tish is Biden's VP pick. You heard it here first lol
Happy birthday, wish you were still president of the USA. Team Biden this November.
Biden needs to lean into this common man appeal. Stream some Warzone with Dr. Lupo and ramble on about suppressors
She's afraid that the Democrats will run away screaming when they see how badly Biden has deteriorated into dementia, but if you mail in that ballot early it'll be too late to change your mind.   Pass this on to your liberal friends. Get them to see what they're voting for.
Biden will not travel to Milwaukee for the Democratic National Convention.
My choice for VP is Susan Rice.  If it isn't her, I will immediately support Biden's choice.  IMMEDIATELY!!!
Nikki Haley will be President in 2024, if Biden wins in November.
I agree that Warren is the best choice, but the moment might require someone else. That's why I keep advocating that Biden not only announce his VP, but a bunch of cabinet members so "the tent" is as big as possible, and fewer people are disappointed, because some will be.
Is anyone considering the scenario that both Trump and Biden could die just before the election?
Biden is the candidate w/ a history of racist comments - remember " obama is a clean articulate negro"  "don't want my kids growing up in a racist jungle" so many racist quotes/speeches from biden to choose from - guess your ok w/ that tho bcuz your woke or something
In the wake of the George Floyd protests, it looked like Biden was on the verge of opening up a 12-13 point lead. He's leveled off and shrunk back down to 7. This is a horrible development because it suggests his peak has passed. Trump has an electoral advantage.
Just move forward. Let the circus die. Biden would have so many more pressing things to get done.
Worse, not worst. One uses worse in a comparison between two things, e.g.- ‚ÄúIt is my opinion that Trump is a worse candidate than Biden, in every way possible.‚Äù Worst means worse than all options, not just two, e.g.- It is my opinion Trump is the worst president in history.‚ÄùüëçüèªüòÄ
Why the hell do 77% of blacks support Biden then???
Anyway, it's demonstrably false to say white people are that invested in their identity when the Obama coalition is so recent that Biden wants to reignite it

Biden didn't write this. We are quite sure he doesn't know how to use twitter.... this must be a fake account. Beware... Twitter should probably take this down.... or is Twitter left sided.
They are trying to pin Biden for the Ukraine thing and he was found innocent of any wrong doing.  Don't you keep up with the stories? Trump, he's been guilty of everything.  He has yet been found innocent of anything
Biden Wins Overwhelmingly
only difference is, Biden was proven innocent and Trump guilty
Obama was running the show &amp; Biden ..FBI official texted 'POTUS wants to know everything we're doing (says Lisa Page to Peter Strzok)': report

On my offshore betting site Biden is the favorite at -175. I‚Äôm concerned because Vegas doesn‚Äôt make many mistakes. I still believe in trump and I bet $1,000 to prove it
If Biden doesn't chicken out, this should be better than WW/WWE. Marxist Socialists are banking on Creepy Basement Biden's cognitive abilities. Well so am I LOL. Even if they gave him the questions, he'd mess up the answers they give him.
He knows, thats why he accuses Biden of having it. His projection is uncontrollable.
Brilliant. Biden has nothing to loss and everything to gain. And have him say it publicly to out Trump and call him a puss. Just keep pointing to all Trumps blunders and lies.

Get the facts.
But tell me how Biden beat Bernie lmao... gtfo paper ballots from now on.   The machine in NY-24 for the dem primary didn‚Äôt even tell me how it read my vote. If there is no confirmation, the vote is tainted.
So ALL POLITICS ASIDE, like truly, I don‚Äôt care about your belief system/political offiliation/who you voted for/how you‚Äôre registered, I need to know...like, arent we collectively worried about Joe Biden? Like don‚Äôt care if you like him/agree etc....like he is ill, right??

Biden is a bumbling idiot at this point.
the good news is that i didn‚Äôt mention biden in this tweet so your video is not relevant. i‚Äôll humor you though, and even if it was by some chance relevant, i could find a million videos of trump being completely illiterate. üòÇ
Biden spoiler? Republicans helping Kanye West get on ballot in battleground states (reports)
Biden all the way get that nut shop out of office
Joe Biden is clearly an anti-yo-semite and I just can't vote for him.
Here are the possibilities in November.  1.  Blue wave - Democrat‚Äôs control all of federal government.   2. Biden wins, GOP Senate control, Dem House control  3. Government stays the same.   3. Pandemic caused anemic turnout - Red Wave - GOP controls all of government.
It‚Äôs true. There might be some wisdom in Bloomberg staying quiet. If it is Biden‚Äôs choice that is fine. If Mikes just sitting on his hands after all that talk he can fuck right off.
And yet, in a heavily blue state I have yet to see one single piece of Biden merch, or anyone openly supporting him. Who voted for Biden to get that nomination? Like I didn't even see much enthusiasm for him online before he got it either.
So we all know that djt is the biggest projector in history. They try to paint Biden as demented when we know he is. Republicans also try to portray dems as child molesters,  that is their biggest projection for djt.
Tucker spells it out and doesn't mince words. Biden's potential VP pics are scary and he tells you why
Biden's VP pics: Karen Bass - lunatic Fidel Castro acolyte, praises Scientology, once belonged to armed revolutionary group. Stacey Abrams - delusional, thinks she's Governor of Georgia, unemployed, recently wrote bad porn novels. Kamala Harris - No one who knows her likes her
Start here &amp; keep in mind this video was made very early before we got the results that the President did nothing wrong. It was coordinated by Obama/Biden/Comey Brennan/Clapper Strzok &amp; others These are facts
Biden-like
I'm not voting for Joe Biden. You have let all of your supporters down. Here is another reason why.
RUSH: Can Thomas Friedman name one thing Biden would do that&amp;#039;s different?
Pure speculation here, but I feel like Biden doesn‚Äôt want to pick Harris. She‚Äôs such an obvious pick that blowing through multiple(self-imposed) deadlines, to me, signals that he has doubts. I‚Äôm likely wrong, but I think those leaks kinda put him on the spot. Just my two cents.
I'm not voting for either Joe Biden or Donald J Trump. I'm voting for the Green 3rd Party candidate Howie Hawkins, which is what you should have done. The current Democratic Party is corrupt to the core. I'd rather have 4 more years of Trump than 8 years of the current DNC.

The blue wall may be back.  But Its important to note Biden will need to win all three.  OR  he could substitute one of these three for AZ, NC, GA, or two of these three with FL or TX.  Lost more paths to 270 for biden then there was for Clinton.
He's damned if he does, damned if he doesn't. If he does, Trump will clean his clock. If he doesn't, Biden is a coward and will look weak. If he can't stand up to Trump how can we expect him to stand up to Putin, Kim Jong-un; etc
Does anybody really think Biden has a chance of winning with all our major city's run by Democrats in total chaos because of all the violence all the criminals getting a free ride, Good luck Wussy Pussy Liberals.
I am voting #Trump this November because I don't want to lose my freedoms as a human being. Biden is a puppet of evil.
California Rep. Karen Bass, a top contender to be Joe Biden‚Äôs 2020 running mate, denied having ties to the Nation of Islam, despite photos and event appearances linking her to the group. anti-Semitism runs deep in the Democrat party #DemocratsAreRacists #DemocratsHateAmerica
Yeah, but let's all make fun of Joe Biden's stutter and deem him unqualified for the office of POTUS.
I‚Äôm actually glad they did this. The president should be pressed and treated tough about this situation and situations similar to this one.  Now I look forward to these types of interviews with Joe Biden before the election.....
Which Biden Policy is socialism exactly?
I think Biden is fine there....but he will need a decent gotv  in the urban areas.  Hopefully his veep pick can help that
Trump is visibly hanging himself. Biden is staying out of sight and letting Trump fumble and make mistakes. It‚Äôs a great strategy.
I take back everything I‚Äôve thought about Biden‚Äôs mental faculties.
I still think MSM is going to say Biden won even if he didn't
Possible Biden VP Pick Karen Bass Flaming Out Over Past Comments on Castro and Scientology
Old and stupid and her sidekick too. Not to mention Joe Biden can't remember shit.
Maybe in fake news world, no one with a brain watches them. After one minute you get depressed, sick &amp; turn channel. Don't watch or read them. Facts are facts like Biden spying on President Trump, Biden has embraced Nazism/Communists, senile,cheat, a liar
OMG, That Axios interview. Keep doing more. Best campaigning Joe Biden could ever do.
Did you here? Biden, the senile old man who can't what day it is, accused of rape, playing touchy feely with women, a plagiarist, liar &amp; cheat ..was in last place a few months ago..is now....officially
Biden denounced Bob Avakian!! Good try FOX!!
Things I take away from this batch of polling:  1.)  Democrats are probably going to lose the Alabama Senate Seat.  While it was in play for a bit its not looking good.  2.)  SC and TX Senate are in play.  And that is not something I really expected.  3.)  TX is in play for Biden
How about your new superhero is a communist! Wow...what? Let's see we fought tyranny to form our great country, WWII, Korean &amp; Vietnam vets fought to end communism &amp; the left has a Commie baby boomer running for President. MAGA 2020
trump will do virtually anything to prop up the stock market for 5 more months (or at least 3 more) so if it crashes he can blame biden.  the opportunity to say "i told you so" is MUCH more important to him than than the future of our entire country. MUCH.
A communist
Why in God's name would this idiot ever to an interview with anybody other than Fox? Best campaigning Joe Biden can do is Trump interviewing or a #TrumpPressConference
I'm voting TRUMP 2020 and the left have a Communist, Biden WOW
The Revolutionary Communist Party endorses Biden who can't remember what day it is. A senile, creepy old Communist  running for office! MAGA 2020
Why in  God's name would this idiot ever sit down to do interviews other than with Fox. The best campaigning Joe Biden can do is Trump doing interviews or a #TrumpPressConference
It's official- the senile old man has the backing of the Revolutionary Communist Party. Happy Tuesday!  MAGA 2020
Trump? Best President ever. Biden? A Nazi &amp; has the endorsements to prove it. Where is Joe? The senile old man who was in last place a few months ago-lol- miraculously is the left's best choice- an angry senile old commie!
Congratulations to Creepy Joe who the Revolutionary Communist Party now endorses. WOW, officially endorsed! Are you proud, after like 50 yrs in politics &amp; besides spying on our President-your now endorsed by a Nazi! VOTE TRUMP 2020
And you'll be responsible for the same MAGA policies under Biden targeting the black community, LGBTQ+, Latinos, ect. Or are you just that hateful, and want bigotry in a blue wrapper in office?
Trump and Biden don't want to debate. They don't want a competitive election. The American people deserve to more than the corporate candidates, more than the approved ideas! #LetHowieDebate #OpenTheDebates    Sign the petition at
I mean, shit it's definitely a good thing if he does. I doubt he will, but if he makes any progress on that it'll be alot more than Biden has even tried to do.
Does anybody really believe Biden would stand on a debate stage and pronounce his support for the Bernie/AOC agenda. Open borders, Medicare for all, healthcare for illegals, voting rights for non citizens, new green deal, bail reform, defunding of police, erasing student loans
The same pollster has Joe Biden winning by 6 points. #Biden2020
I say, no problem. Don't extend this 600. 00 per week fiasco People will find work or go back to their job. In 2009 during the financial crisis &amp; dems in charge Biden/Obama/Pelosi Schumer unemployment they gave 25.00 more Don't give in to trainwreck Pelosi
I predict the following people will lose their next election. Biden, shumer, deblosio, schiff, pelosi, nadler,cuomo, waters, mayors from Chicago, Seattle, Minneapolis, Portland and newsome. Americans are fed up and hold these losers directly responsible.
Secret service agent for Biden easiest job in America
The real Ukraine scandal is US cash for gas -- It involves the Bidens and a growing list of Dems. Biden's a crook
Joe Biden is a real man
What happens if Biden is afraid to debate the President? This is the best question you have? What of Biden wins and spends his Presidency in the basement? President Trump will win, no worries
Fake news, no one watches them, People see...sitting home due to virus, lol...what the left did &amp; are doing. Defund police? Peaceful protests burning cities? Remember a few months ago when Biden was in last place? Behold everyone beating him dropped out..hmmm
The best campaigning Biden can do is #TrumpPressConference
Why do they take an oath to defend &amp; protect our Constitution= and don't? They are liars-cheat &amp; Biden (after 47 yrs) is a liar who hasn't done anything. They are communists trying to destroy our country
Joe Biden admits the Crime Bill in the 90's HE was responsible, he wrote the Clinton Crime Bill that jailed many Blacks with outrageous sentences
‚ÄúSticking it to China.‚Äù Its the thing the GOP tells its voters now. It‚Äôs an election wedge issue now. Biden won‚Äôt be tough enough on China apparently.
Not one person that was gonna vote for Biden is going to vote for Kanye. He can try helping trump but he will just end up doing harm to him in the end. This is what losing looks like in the trump campaign lmao
"LGBT" isn't a political candidate. Trump is. It would be just as inappropriate if it were a Biden flag or a Cuomo flag or anyone else.
LOL total harassment. The President because of Biden &amp; Co spying on the President- his political opponent-went through 2 yrs of investigations.  Obama Biden/Comey Brennan &amp; others Russia Hoax FOUND NOTHING! Biden's turn to be investigated for crimes-
I agree that he should probably do this as a private citizen. I am very passionate about free speech--especially in regards to religion and politics. I wouldn't care if the officer displayed a Biden flag or even support for Kanye.
Virginia mayor faces calls to resign after claiming Joe Biden had picked Aunt Jemima for VP   / These are the times we live in...
I don't care if this is promoting Trump, Biden, or someone from the Flying Spaghetti Monster party. It's wrong, period!
Biden has NO strategy! He has incorporated every crazy idea from the lunatic left. Now he‚Äôs proposing ideas that Trump has already implemented to fool the uninformed into thinking he‚Äôs a centrist.
Amazing that the GOP is trying to paint Biden as a socialist. The more you read about red state Tennessee the more you find similar policies.
RUSH: The reason they don't want any debates is because specifically of Joe Biden and his inability to do one.
South Carolina Congressman says Fla. Rep. Val Demings merits Joe Biden VP spot
Oh, Kellyanne, you‚Äôve backed the wrong horse.  Biden always shows up for the one to ones.  Especially with opponents he loathes.  Bet Trump finds a way to cancel at least one.
People really can't think that Biden will make a good president. He has Alzheimer's I thought.
This would be just as wrong if it was for Biden or Obama. We expect law enforcement to, without bias or partiality, justly enforce the laws. Being seen as "taking sides" in campaigns is a dangerous precedent to set &amp; one that I do not support regardless of my own partisan views.
What I saw was that Biden is picking a woman
I still don‚Äôt find it shocking. Are there rules anymore? I‚Äôve never seen law-enforcement attacked this violently, so I expected this. So far, Biden has not given law enforcement his support, and they have no idea if he will. I believe this is just the beginning...
I think it‚Äôs funny that a pro fracking candidate ie joe Biden is about protecting the environment needed a good chuckle . As for the Biden voter shaming it‚Äôs out of desperation&amp; the fact they didn‚Äôt learn that it didn‚Äôt work for Hillary and it may backfire even more this time !
The Democratic Party can't put Biden on the same stage as Pres. Trump.  It'd be a landslide after the first 10 minutes.  And if they are claiming cancel them because of Covid, then now you know why the media is pushing that Covid is so bad.  Covid will die off after the elections
That the American public will see just how bad Biden‚Äôs mental decline is!
I want to see Biden‚Äôs bank statements ... that is where the dirt is.
Of the 18 ad buys, the most successful one by impressions was exclusively run in Wisconsin. Biden received an estimated 70k-80k impressions from Wisconsinites. Below is the age and gender breakdown by impressions on that ad buy, with people 35+ exclusively targeted.
Biden ran 18 different versions of this same ad, which focuses on his time as Vice President under Barack Obama and a focus on the auto industry.   The 18 different ad buys were focused on one state each, exclusively in Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina.
It‚Äôs now August, and while the Biden campaign‚Äôs early digital advertising wasn‚Äôt necessarily focused on the crucial swing states, his campaign spending has been much more focused there of late.   Today‚Äôs #AdOfTheDay is a pro-Biden ad that the campaign began running on Aug. 2.
Fake News Mr. President, that's all they report-or don't report. I don't watch those stations. Polls are wrong Fact- Joe Biden is a liar, plagiarist, cheat &amp; accused of rape. He apologized for inappropriate touching, was involved in SPYING on your campaign, doesn't support police
Joe Biden spent an estimated $401,675 and earned about 23.5 million impressions in the week from July 27-August 2.
***Please dont the debates because Biden doesnt have the mental capabilities to do anything other than read off a teleprompter on his best day
The left has to do all it can to make sure the American public never sees how much Biden‚Äôs mental acuity has declined!
BBC News - US election 2020: The war hero who could be Biden's running mate
I called for ban on fracking in NY in my 2010 run for Governor. After my 5% of the vote in 2014,  agreed. We need him to sign this bill re waste. We need Joe Biden and the Democrats to support a ban on fracking - and all new fossil fuel infrastructe. #GreenNewDeal

Something everyone shouldn‚Äôt be concerned about:  Biden‚Äôs Quietly Radical Care Plan
the kinds of things trump tries to accuse biden of wanting are so funny. "radical left biden!" omg have you seen the man he's practically a republican
Agreed. I hate to say it but she probably should‚Äôve retired when Obama had both chambers. If they don‚Äôt flip the senate she needs to hold on for Inauguration Day and hope Biden wins
The Trump plan for the 2nd term needs to be made clear to voters. Biden campaign is now preaching Joe‚Äôs plan is the plan Trump implemented in the 1st term. It‚Äôs all make believe to attract the uninformed. They decide on sound bites.

Why Do "Republicans" HATE Trump And Plan To Vote For BIDEN? | Huckabee  via
There used to be a joke about the two best days in a boat owners life..  I've updated it to three  1. The day you buy it 2. The day you DONT participate in the Trashy PussyGrabber in Chief boat parade. 3. The day you sell it.  Try the veal...I'm here till we elect Biden!
Excellent story by one of my favorite political reporters--and, incidentally, a  and  alum,
But..... but....... but..... Hunter Biden, Damn it
Listen, I think Trump is an ass as much as the next guy. But you cannot honestly think that a live debate against Trump will be anything but a disaster for Biden. This is either complete delusion or a total lie by Yang.
seriously, i know its a meme, but all trump has to do is walk on stage, say "senile joe" and he wins. Its that simple. Nobody genuinely supports biden, they support beating trump. That won't happen in these debates because of that. Downward force on a bridge with no supports.
the problem is these "debates" have never been "intellectual debates". They're personality contests, that's why trump did well in them. Dude never had to argue facts, he just had to zero in on a weak point and he did every time. Biden is doomed, and I don't support trump.
It will be Biden.
I agree  it's important to help by informing friends, family &amp; people. Biden &amp; the rest of them don't give Americans credit...like we don't remember what Biden did. Burned Bernie-made deals for his drop out, Spygate, Ukraine &amp; 2016 Election corruption &amp; whole Obama Presidency
Still never seen a Biden flag or sign
No longer has to serve jail time for his Federal Crimes He ADMITTEDLY Did! hmmmm so yea we know his gross ways. Too bad he won‚Äôt be able to go through with that promise when we vote Joe Biden In office in November. Because her trial isn‚Äôt until next July ( smart judge )
They should, had no problem investigating our President and Obama/Biden were the culprits
These people are lawless. Biden was involved, along w/ Obama cabinet members-imagine that-he spying &amp; attempted coup of a duly elected President, than tried to remove him when that didn't work....few days later this happens &amp; they have anarchists &amp; want to pay people to stay home
Biden is literally anti progress. Wants to reward cops with more funding for murdering black people, plans to keep Trump's anti-trans medical policy in place, continuing putting Latino kids in cages, that started under him and Obama, ect. He only opposes progressive policies.
And you'll be responsible when we get the same shit under 4 years of Biden.
and this
and what happened to Tara? Not so long ago...
and this
Joe Biden Identifies as catholic but he Goes against church teachings! Why would he not side with Catholic church teachings?
No it isn‚Äôt. Obama announced Biden on august 23. The convention started on the 25th. McCain announced palin on august 29. Convention started September 1. Stop making drama where there isn‚Äôt any.
In fact if joe Biden becomes president there will never be another July 4th Celebration of this country Because joe Biden day it's Racist What Do you think of that America The democrats are going to destroy the United States of America
If and when joe Biden does become president he will change a lot of things that go on in this country like the Muslims will come along and say you have to remove god from the pledge of allegiance cause we don't believe in that god...
Joe Biden you are a coward and a traitor, I will never respect you!!!
Democratic presidential candidate Joseph Biden is a traitor Of the United States of America He agrees that statues should be torn down mount Rushmore should be removed because he wants the black vote, But when he was vice president he was for all that stuff that he is against now
Obama started -anti police rhetoric, was gatekeeper along w/Biden to spy on candidate Trump &amp; a coup to destroy President Trump. It's all out. Biden on day he FOR NO LEGIT reason, unmasked Gen Flynn, came up w/ Logan act to falsely charge-no predicate &amp; same day he gets a medal
Can we skip the part where the left has a meltdown over Biden‚Äôs VP pick not being *check‚Äôs notes* Nina Turner and carrying on with the task of relegating Donald Trump to the dustbin of history?
Yes Biden voters aren‚Äôt brainwashed by a cult like Republican Party. We don‚Äôt obsess over him or have his poster on our walls. He isn‚Äôt a god he‚Äôs the president. And a corrupt one that‚Äôs destroying the country and killing thousands of Americans everyday with his stupidity.
Honestly shouldn‚Äôt the question be ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 11:28, does Joe Biden know where Joe Biden is?‚Äù
These folks can talk all they want Biden will be at the debate. There is a greater chance that trump doesn‚Äôt actually show up.
Hope so, clearly we have more God fearing Patriots than anti American Marxists who embrace Venezuela/Russia style socialism. It's amazing -same politicians including Biden, who were so Russia  Russia embrace there ideology.
Biden admits he lied &amp; calls himself dumb!
Biden (an admitted liar) the weasel -his handlers won't allow it to happen. Biden is a senile old trainwreck who's been in DC since 1972 &amp; has done NOTHING except SPY on his political opponent President Trump, He was involved along with Obama!! and this

Really look at the results form the debates with Clinton. According to gallop Hillary won every debate. And trump constantly lies all you have to do is point out his lies and failures. It really isn‚Äôt very difficult. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs gonna yell every time Biden speaks
What a dumb tweet. People said the same when he went head to head with Bernie. Calling Biden demented when trump is being rushed to Walter Reed constantly has bruises on his arms and can‚Äôt put together sentences is honestly incredibly stupid.
Turn off creepy Biden's so called press conference &amp; wash my hands -yuck
Trending in the right direction.  Down from peak of 15300.  Specifically what would Biden do for Florida (&amp; rest of U.S.) that Trump is not doing ???
Current cases down from high of 15300.   Seems to be trending in the right direction.   What would Biden do for Florida that Trump is not doing?????
Why would Biden change anything right now? Why give Trump any fresh ammo? This race is 99% a referendum on Trump. Let him sink himself.
Mass incarceration that‚Äôs Biden right?
There has been no shift. Joe Biden is leading in almost every state.  Who are you anyway ?
Not me. Watching trump yell over him is only going to confirm that Biden needs to win
Biden is no less authoritarian than Trump. He won't even speak out against the gestapo Trump has abducting people because he plans to use it. And his entire career has been based around strengthening police authority and targeting the black and LGBTQ+ communities.
Yep, that is why we will be voting for Biden
lol true-Biden worked with several segregationists look at the date of this article and there is much more.
Plus Biden's past isn't being reported like they did all the way up till the DNC forced all the other marxists out but made a pack with Bernie &amp; the rest.
Biden has released plans to make public college free (for most), forgive student loans, bailout the childcare industry, provide universal pre-k, double the min. wage, increase money for low-income schools, and boost collective bargaining rights. But Trump did tweet that one time.
Democrats don‚Äôt believe Biden is a good candidate, they just hate trump. Many won‚Äôt vote at all
They are pathological.Biden has the 2 biggest box of rocks for brains helping him with his marxist (aka progressive aka communism aka socialism) plan -AOC &amp; Bernie, handlers keep him in basement like a country mouse, comes up to make a fool out of himself -than back in the hole
Biden has the most progressive platform in modern American politics and this is your takeaway? Have you not noticed all the ‚ÄúBiden is a puppet for the radical left‚Äù talk coming from Trump? But hold up, folks, Trump tweeted something completely at odds with his actual record. ü§îü§î
Yes, I've been expecting this for months. It's the Viktor Orban strategy. He asked DOJ to investigate Biden several years ago. When it did not announce an investigation, he turned to Ukraine. But now he has an unethical AG, so he can use the Orban trick in its pure form.The comparison 2 Stein is a bit strained.  Ppl thought Clinton had it n the bag and there couldn‚Äôt b enough ppl 2 actually elect trump so they stayed home.  Also, there‚Äôs a segment of the population that has an unreasonable distain for Clinton.  Neither scenario is true re: Biden
Hey,  the  groups working against  the USA  (1) Trump, (2)republicans and (3) Russians. They iwant to re-elect  Trump and Dirt up Biden. In November 3th replaceing the republicans enablers. These white voters for Trump,  blindness of his inconsistency, handling of the virus?
The only way I‚Äôd vote for Biden is if his VP pick is a true progressive or the closest thing to Bernies camp (which I doubt will happen) and even under those circumstances I‚Äôll still be hesitant.
It's not just "dumb shit". He's exhibiting signs of dementiav which puts him in the same category as Trump in that neither has a clue. He also likes almost as much as Trump. The argument is if Trump is supposedly so bad, why did the establishment Dems pick Biden as his opponent?
Biden is done
Joe Biden has been in power for years and nothing has changed for the Black community. Plus we had a black president for 8 years and still nothing changed apart from things getting worst...and you still want to vote the same way? That's madness.
Honestly, if Biden does not choose Kamala....November lookn grim
It's amazing that many of the things that have been implemented by the Trump Administration for the black community were not done during the Obama/Biden Administration!!
What wouldn't stick? You don't see that Biden's in cognitive decline? Try taking your head out of the sand.
Except that all that calculation flies in the face of a) Bernie was no longer an unknown quantity, b) Bernie's strong showing [read 'winning'] in Iowa, a white state, c) Bernie dominating white youth vote d) Biden showing obvious cognitive decline and e) the popularity of ....1/2
Sir, you speak truth; However, don‚Äôt confuse or use this as an example as to why we should vote 4 Donald Duck. Honestly, Trump nor Biden understands the complexity of Black citizens struggling in Amerikkka under Repugs &amp; DemoCRATS. But I think Amerikkka getting ready to learn.
If it were all my toys I'd be demanding the GND, Bernie's Climate Policy, a Federal Jobs Guarantee, Universal Childcare, Student Loans Debt Forgiveness and Free Colleges and Universities. You and Biden should consider yourselves lucky I'm not 3 any more.
Eric Trump will be crying on November 4th once Joe Biden becomes the winner. ‚úåÔ∏è

at least Trump writes his own crazy tweets during his morning shits. Biden said what he meant and some 23 year old translated the explanation on Twitter. Don‚Äôt fall for it.
You're right Biden's declining at a faster rate than Trump.
Yeah? Tell me why Biden in the primary?
what is politics?  Kamala and Biden started out rocky in the beginning debates. Kamala attacked Biden for  his concerning record on race relations.  Now they are likely to be pairing up as Pres. &amp; Veep

Hey, can‚Äôt we replace Biden as candidate ? How can he continue to make such stupid statements ?! Why didn‚Äôt he stick to saying that Hispanics are a diverse group- Puerto Rican‚Äôs, Dominicans, Mexicans etc. He makes so many misstatements that the Republicscum masses jump on.
It's ironic because Trump is less religious than Biden is
If Juan wasn't there just think who would tell us what a good Catholic Biden is ?
if mr Biden is such a good catholic how come he is so in favor of abortion and why are there so many videos of him fondling young people

Crazy thing. Joe biden is madddd catholic. This is RICH coming from this orange Satan. Not a thing godly about him. Trash.
Joe Biden takes the Black &amp; Latino vote for granted.  Who knows what else he thinks &amp; says about anyone else who is not white.
Obama/Biden took fracking to its peak during their tenure. They gave Shell permission to drill in the Arctic twice. 1 of Biden's top advisor &amp; fundraiser is an oil and gas executive. I'm way past falling for such meaningless gestures. I'll stay focused on the candidate's actions.
Well, Biden's already told us what'd happen if it miraculously cleared both Houses. As I've said before, the opposition from the courts has nothing on that coming from the establishment Democrats.
someone posted that you would be voting for Biden knowing your closeness to the Bush family please say it is not true.
I don‚Äôt think the black American community cares about anything joe Biden says because they know he won‚Äôt be the one running the country. Such a shame
Biden helped 2 right wingers onto the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court dealt one of the biggest blows to democracy with Citizen's United and that was before Trump.
You're right. It's not fair to compare Trump to Biden. After all, Biden's had decades-long headstart over Trump in screwing over the working class especially minorities. Trump has some catching up to do.
You're absolutely right. But it makes no sense that you'd prefer Biden either.... Biden is waaay more responsible for this system than Trump. Biden's actions had resulted in real damage to real people for the last couple of decades.
That just shows u how "conditioned" many Blk voters are. Not that that was the only reason Biden is the presumptive nominee. It depends on what u call better. Would he have been more responsive during the pandemic? Most likely but they had 08 crash &amp; their response bore Trump.ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Donald Trump is funny-dumb racist, Joe Biden is blatantly-oops racist...feel me?
The fact that Biden doesn‚Äôt even hold a position of power and yet meets with pandemic experts 4 times a week and trump openly admitting to not meeting with experts regularly..... is TELLING!
So you‚Äôre voting for Kanye? Not voting for Biden is like voting for tRUMP. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Vote Biden; we need a avalanche of votes for Biden. We need PEACE.
Not a surprise. Biden was picked so Obama can control him.
I'm not sure about that. Bernie held back much in that final debate. He basically gave Biden that win.
Ha! Good one . Hidin‚Äô Biden. Lollll

Everyone prepare yourself: Barr is cooking up some garbage against Joe Biden. It is coming. Know this: IT IS NOT TRUE. DO NOT BE MISLED. DO NOT BE DISTRACTED. FOCUS.  DONALD TRUMP MUST BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE. Over 159,000 dead Americans from Trump's incompetence is enough.
So now red ass Missouri is showing love 4.....OBAMACARE...an president skidmark is trying 2 shut it down..i think this a good wedge issue 4 Biden in Missouri
I'm not confident in Biden's ability to beat Trump. Yes he has the lead now but look what the polls were showing in August 2016 and the debates are yet to come. Trump will shred Biden on the debate state and he knows it, the latest is he's asking for a 4th debate to be added! üòñ
Don't believe ANYTHING BARR and his cronies come up with any day now. Just know that it's MADE UP GARBAGE NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY. REMAIN FOCUSED: WE MUST VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN AND DEMOCRATS UP &amp; DOWN THE BALLOT IN EVERY STATE. DO NOT BE FOOLED.
Oh yeah!! What about Biden's crimes and Clinton's crimes? Are you blind or deaf?
How come no one's complaining and seeing racial and sexual discrimination,  when Biden only picking his VP by race and color(woman and black) It's illegal on any jobs..it's the law..Democrats don't follow their own laws..
If this election is so close that ‚Äúx‚Äù thousands of votes that Kanye West could siphon off from Joe Biden (be they black, brown, purple, or polka-dot) from ‚Äúx‚Äù number of states a‚Äôla Jill Stein, after such a disastrous presidency, then we‚Äôve got much bigger problems!
People with guns shouldn't be called to deal with a bad parking, so at this time Biden can't so much than just advocate and whatever about Medicare for all that can be added to obama care if it helps fix it then he can.. makes no sense kill Obama care for Medicare for all
Kanye West has mental issues, and is being used by the Republican Party to help Donald Trump.  Believe. We cannot let it work. VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN AND DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT IN EVERY STATE EVERY WHERE.
Please people do not be fooled. Kanye West is not a serious candidate. He I s being used by Republicans to help Donald Trump.  Don't allow it to work. Please don't vote for Kanye West it is a vote for Trump. Make sure that you, your friends &amp; family vote for Joe Biden.
Shit on Biden too
Trump Calls For Additional, Earlier Debate With Biden; Campaign Provides List Of¬†Moderators
I think Joe Biden just said ‚ÄúDefund the Police‚Äù
I‚Äôm attending The National Education Association‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúVirtual Town Hall with Jill Biden &amp; NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garc√≠a‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #StrongPublicSchools
Did Biden write that?
You are a dope Jack. Wake up, do you think Biden is going to be flying commercial sitting next to crying babies?
News week with some of these stupid post if Obama trash trump why Biden come up come on
Donald Trump did not build the U.S. Economy when he became POTUS he took over the Economy built by Obama &amp; Biden, which  provided the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, until Trump destroyed it.Trump destroys everything that he touches.
Biden agreed to debates case close .
Group comprising multiple, some opposing interests, working on what could happen if Trump loses the election or he or Biden win by a very narrow majority. Chilling.
Joe Biden WILL beat Trump like a DRUM, Mrs. Krassenstein! Unlike the orange Nazi in the White House, Biden will stand strong &amp; speak FULL TRUTH to the American people! Like Biden himself, I cannot wait to see him tear Adolf Trump to SHREDS!
Seriously???? I know now for sure your not listening to Joe Biden.
If Biden chooses Rice, he probably can kiss winning the election goodbye
You can wipe whatever with this . Don‚Äôt worry about Biden‚Äôs they are not trash like you folks
why would the Democrats want Joe Biden to debate with President Trump? President Trump is in a class by himself and many people would be afraid to have a debate with him.  Biden's constant response would be his customary "What Malarkey is that?"
Oh..Biden already has an ad out wit the "it is, wut it is" statement...i gotta b on the lookout..havent seen it
But surely he can Google Biden's legislative history. That's not so hard for young people.....
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt prove it but I know it‚Äôs true:‚Äù This will be Biden‚Äôs first comeback after trumps first of many lies at the debate!!!  "This is just pointless. I get it. You're just saying a bunch of crap, okay? You're saying a bunch of crap" --
During the debates, Biden better have a host of shutdowns and comebacks to counter trumps interruptions.   If not, they better have a mute switch on his microphone.
Joe biden says he cant wait to find out who he picked for vp
Not voting isn't the only other option. The Green Party is also an option. What's the context that's missing? Trump got into office party b/c Obama/Biden chose to help big businesses rather than little people to get back on their feet after a crisis and reneged on their promises.
Was Joe Biden also responsible for drafting a law prevents you from eating a baguette and a brioche.
Trump not Biden is ? U r nuts
Why has all this hunter biden stuff been forgotten?
You're right Biden didn't out campaign him. Bernie under-campaigned and Biden did win the last debate but not because he was great but because Bernie didn't do what he needed to do. He had to control over the coalescing but there were some things he could've done much better.
I think a lot of the Biden voters will be shocked.
No, if you want to fix the system you must elect someone who didn't contribute substantially to the damage. Arsonists don't put out fires no matter what they tell you. Biden's an arsonist. And here's why "after" doesn't work.
Still waiting for your response, regarding a Biden initiative to register young Black and brown activists, marking across the country for change. It would be a travesty if they are not registered to VOTE on November 3rd. This is doable. Campaign staffer during Obama's first run.
That‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs job.  And he needs to be prepared to pounce on every lie that comes out of trump‚Äôs mouth. Biden ain‚Äôt new to this and it don‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to bust trump up. #tooeasy
...caused. He was VP just 4 years ago. I'd encourage you to be a bit more research on Biden and he's activities over the last 20 years. I think you'll be unpleasantly surprised. 2/2
Biden had done more actual harm to Black people than Trump has. I'm not sure y his record as a legislator should be discounted simply because he hasn't been president. It's NOW when it should be relevant. The Crime Bill isn't the only terrible damage Biden's policies have...1/2
Biden‚Äôs retort to every trump debate answer should be ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about and he‚Äôs lying when he does.‚Äù
I don't fear Trump winning any more than I fear Biden winning, doing nothing, the MSM covering for him like they did for Obama and a worse Trump emerging in 2024 and if you think Pompeo doesn't have any such ambitions, think again. And he's no ignoramus.
...Trump gone but more importantly, I want to ensure that he never returns. Joe "nothing will fundamentally change" Biden will only guarantee Trump 2.0., the literate version. Tell the DNC and Biden that there's a lot at stake. WE already know that. 2/2
There is no chance that whoever is making the pick, we know it‚Äôs not Biden, will pick
You see that's where your wrong. Getting rid of Trump is important but the MOST important thing is to ensure that you don't lay the foundation for a worse Trump to appear. That's what you'll get with Joe "nothing will fundamentally change" Biden.
Imagine calling people ignorant when they cite facts as their reasons for not voting for Biden. And calling them fanatical because they don't vote blue no matter who........
The Beauty of The Verses of This Sing along Song you  can make up the Verses as You go Along as To in what Ways Trump The Idiot has Impacted your Life and End  With If You Think Trump's  Crazy Now  just wait Till Biden Win The Election!
So no tough questions for Biden?
The only problem is that Biden has a record too.
No, they've just voted on the platform less than a week ago. It's not changing. It shows that Biden isn't a real option at all b/c nothing will fundamentally change. Wishful thinking won't make it so.  Also Biden's record speaks for itself. It's more prediction than speculation.
I mean I hope whoever is making the decisions for Biden picks her
I hope Biden picks her.
The Dem Party &amp; its ever increasing similarity to the Republicans is the problem. That's Hillary, Biden, Pelosi, Obama etc. We saw how hard they fought Bernie in 2016 and how little they've fought Trump. We know there donors are in charge and both parties serve the same masters.
Please ask Jill Biden why her husband won‚Äôt do the interview with Chris Wallace ty
When will the barrage of disrespect for the Great President Donald Trump end.  Most of the criticism seem to focus on the fact that this is a man who knows how to pull a crowd and many envy that outstanding ability.
Will you for once, stop taking about what you think Biden will do, and focus on what YOU should be doing!
It's not bitterness. It's a warning siren that electing Biden is paving the way for a competent Trump.
Hoping for this news:  Biden Harris an unbeatable team..
Well Chump, laying down and rolling over  for Schumer and the Hag, yet again!  Let's bail out all the Dem states and municipalities, pension funds and then go for Biden's Plan (he'll be POTUS by then.  Adios!
If Biden refuses to debate he will lose the election. It will look like he is scared.  Bottom line .
Kamala Harris will attract Indian and Black votes and she is a kickass Ex AG and super Senator. Hands down, she is the best choice for VP
So ready to elect the #Biden administration to get this country on a better track. I'm ready for competence and decency! #Biden2020 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #TeamPeteForJoe

Listen to "8/3/2020" by Derek Varsalona ‚öì  The Democrats Don't want Joe Biden to debate. They know too well that Joe Biden will get manhandled by President Donald Trump. Listen to my take.
Do you know what just happened in the DNC's Platform and Rules Committees' meetings recently. If not, listen to first hand accounts on   and  . Then come back and tell me if that's fighting. Of course Bernie's still for M4A. The question is why isn't Biden?
I know. That's why that has to be our redline for Biden to earn our votes. If he wins without understanding this, he'll ignore is for 4 years.
You can‚Äôt debate a liar. Never can win against someone who will say anything. Good move by Biden to not debate. Won‚Äôt change anyone‚Äôs mind. #Debate
How about one reason to vote for Biden. He will pick the most qualified people to run the government, not his deadbeat cronies.
I saw one. ‚Äúnever biden‚Äù
If you really think Black lives matter, you'd run away from Biden. Not only did he write the Crime Bill but he's very proud of it and he's still not interested in legalizing marijuana. All the policies have ravaged Black families for decades.
Yes Bernie failed big time with that statement as well as in saying that Biden's not corrupt. SMH
Biden 2020...thats the path
No the MSM was saying Biden could beat Trump long before that.

Clyburn Says Biden Black VP Demands Are ‚ÄòFoolhardy‚Äô
I think that's a more reasonable take but not altogether true. We'll take a big hit but we'll not be destroyed b/c Biden won't do anything to endear voters to his administration. But they've clearly decided to win without appealing to us. If they do, that'd be a hard hit for us.
Biden promises nothing will fundamentally change.  Biden fundamentally changes nothing.
Voting for Biden amounts to the same action for all the good it's going to do you. At least if the Green Party gets 5% they become eligible for federal funding.
Biden and the Dems say "Fuck You!" too. They just do it with a smile and 100 words.  How many people lost their homes under Obama? Why didn't he help them?
You think Biden and Democrats are care about you, your family &amp; your home equity. ü§£ü§£ You see what happened with Occupy Wall Street, BLM, &amp; now people are chaining themselves to court doors to prevent their landlords from filling eviction papers. What are they doing about that?
You need to reread my posts. I said  people will remain vigilant &amp; political conscious &amp; that beats being lulled to sleep under a Biden adminstration by the TV until the next Trump appears. I don't expect Trump himself to make things better. In fact I expect them to become worse.
U don't have to listen to me. Look at the facts. You can't tell me what has changed. How's Biden behaving any differently? Who're his advisors? You don't want to face reality &amp; will be back here in 2024 telling us to vote for Kamala or Buttigieg because Pompeo is so terrible. NO!
Both are terrible is the position of those who are knowledge. Tell me what policies in the Trump adminstration is Biden really opposed to. The Democrats aren't against what Trump does, just how he does it.I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúNew York for Biden: Westchester for Biden Weekly Meeting (Virtual/Phone event)‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe

I would have stopped and then started talking about Biden. Lmao
Don't take words and assume what trump meant cause it fits your narrative. Biden has said the words and on video without anyone having to assume anything! Lol yet continue to troll trump everyday cause that's pretty much what you do lmfaooo
I'm Latino, I'm not voting Biden. My family isn't voting Biden either
Somebody said the Russian bounty story was 'lib shit' and the Beverly Hills YouTube anarchist threw a fit. Pure entertainment.  It's a rhetorical move to say 'I really want socialism and anarchism, but for right now, we need to support Biden and parrot US FP talking points.'
Biden knows the women whose names get floated will get smeared, but that's the whole function of floating names ‚Äî to see what smears come and how well the smears get dealt with.

Madam Senator, fellow Veteran you keep on protecting us from the Impeached One I'd be more than honored to host your visit to New York City after President Joe Biden's Inauguration.  I'd love to show some of the sights:
I‚Äôm thinking a narrative shift because Covid may end soon after they select Biden‚Äôs VP and he steps down. 2 days in a row, awful coverage, they know they can‚Äôt trust him. VP turned Pres candidate now can get on campaign trail. PPL Waking up to dems governing during plandemic.
Yes I do think Biden will be way better.
You hope that Biden comes in and the country gets worse then it's current state? Smells like privilege
Based upon about 10 different witnesses and if Trump was innocent why didn‚Äôt he allow witnesses to testify? Like John Bolton? Everyone knows what he did and if you think for one second he didn‚Äôt withhold aid for dirt on Biden you are a lot dumber than I thought.
If Biden were to only win two states,  it'd be Hawaii and Vermont, not New York. An argument can be made that'd it'd be California and Hawaii though.   Goes without saying DC should be blue.
Why is it that whenever Joe Biden makes another racist remark     all say ‚ÄúHe just misspoke‚Äù however according to all the same news agency‚Äôs Trump is a vile racist? ü§îü§îü§î
Who will Biden choose as Secretary of Shut The Fuck Up, Mr. President?   It‚Äôll be the most important job in his WH. And he clearly can‚Äôt keep whoever Trump hired. üòÖ
So technically a vote for Biden is a vote for China? How much did that report cost? Because anyone who ever heard Biden speak knew that already.

In your 50 years of working for this country your two accomplishments were putting way too many black people behind bars and now this other accomplishment of yours is your lack of ability to speak you are not fit to be president mr. Biden go watch your grand kids

He also was awestruck by the ordnance detonating over the majestic valley and over the sea to shining sea on this Thursday night into Friday morning.
Ask Joe Biden he thinks he has the answer or does he.
Also electoral politics made my vote completely irrelevant. How I vote doesn‚Äôt matter because my vote doesn‚Äôt count in NY, my state will vote Biden anyway. I won‚Äôt be voted for anyone who is going to perpetuate the capitalist hellscape we are in.
Both Trump and Biden have no desire to end poverty, which kills so many
I can go on if you‚Äôd like. Trump and Biden are both evil politicians with little care for the deaths their policies caused or will cause. And that has been a consistent trait of every single US president.
Dope head k w no problem   Biden
My new theory is that she is prepping us for the utter disaster of Biden's lame-duck admin. She hits all the crises at once and puts out solid plans so that, when his "appease the wealthy base" proposals fall flat, we have constant reminders of what real left policy looks like.
The amount of BS Biden has been on I seriously can‚Äôt be mad at this anymore. But still fuck them too
No shit. Literally Kanye's whole reason for doing this is to hopefully take votes from Biden to keep his buddy Trump in office. It's not rocket science. Why else would people from Trump's campaign be helping to get him on the ballot in some states?
I hope Mr. Biden and his family REALLY think hard about running for president.
Does he think that having two MAGA people running for president is going to hurt Biden 2x as much? I don't get it.
Keep talking to yourself in the mirror Mr.Biden!
So Biden‚Äôs trying to lose, huh?

He may just think staying in the Basement was working out for Biden so he figured to try the same tactic and hope for the same love/excuses #Biden gets from MSM.
Saw Elliott Abrams trending &amp; got worried that he might be joining Biden's foreign policy team. I mean, with the announcement that a fundraiser for the murderous Contras is heading Latinx outreach, it seemed plausible.  Turns out Abrams is envoy to Iran.üôÑ

Lotta ppl w/ expressed reservations about the covid vaccine describe themselves as up to date on other vaccines, &amp; pro-science. They said under Biden, they'll get it. But under Trump, they won't bc he can't be trusted to administer it properly. Getting rid of him= all we can do.
Biden, all your doing is twisting words, you know what you damn said, now your backtracking to save your ass. It‚Äôs to late Joe, the horse is out of the barn.
Biden, your so full of BS it‚Äôs pathetic. Basically what you said, you couldn‚Äôt distinguish one Black Man from another, to you they are all the same. Now that is a racist statement, and you should be held accountable.

Biden, don‚Äôt try to backtrack you know damn well what you said, the short of it, is the that all Black People are the same, while Latino‚Äôs have diversity.
Biden is a centrist democrat, he isnt even for universal health care. His policies are not socialist.
There is more probabilistic downside to a trump autocracy that effectively eliminates your ability to legally affect change.   With Biden, you can still general strike, protest, etc.
Tell me about Trump‚Äôs policing policies that will help with law and order? He‚Äôs implemented them, and done nothing but escalate the issue and violate the constitution. Which of Biden‚Äôs policies will lead to rampant crime and lawlessness?
Gotta love that Biden outreach of catering to absolutely no one besides fascists
Who?  You?  I dont know about all that "we".  BLK politics = Tangible policies  Biden has LESS BLK support than Hilary did in 2016.  Biden will get 90% of half the ppl that WOULD HAVE voted for tangibles.  We already know that's not enough.  #NoBlackAgendaNoVote

Is it possible Biden will not do any debates to protect himself before the election, robbing us of some political comedy during the shitshow that is the 2020 election?
Normally you just say sorry. But its Biden...

'Biden has permitted his League of Mediocre White Men to run around dinging up a group of trailblazing female politicians, most of them Black, all of whom have plied paths unimaginably more challenging than any taken by these men.'   forever speaks our truth:
Joe Biden makes a really shitty gaffe every single week, I can‚Äôt believe I am expected to vote for a guy like this! This shit is awful. I feel like I am being gaslighted.
At least Biden knows how to apologize. Had Trump ever once uttered ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sorry‚Äù?
Joe Biden is on board with killing babies. Showing up on Sunday doesn't make him a better man.
Biden needs to STFU tho, dude is making gaffes left and right
There is no alternative, if we don‚Äôt want socialism and a left wing agenda for our country.  Biden is a puppet for the radical left and will bring the USA down.

Bernie has always voted and endorsed based on pragmatism just as Bernie has always spoken, done direct action, and written legislation based on ideals.  No he doesn‚Äôt have a scheme. He endorsed Biden just as he endorsed Hillary and Obama.

Everyone makes mistakes, so why yall cruficying Biden for? Yall couldnt  wait for him to slip up
Young Black Americans not sold on Biden, the Democrats or voting
Joe Biden is 97 years old  Screw him
Trump claimed Biden will "hurt the Bible" and "hurt God." If you believe this, I got a bridge for sale in Brooklyn.#Biblicalidiot  via
Here‚Äôs the way I look at it, Biden is ok, not who I was pulling for originally, but I think he‚Äôll surround himself with good people. Unlike Trump who‚Äôs surrounded himself with horrible people and we see the results.
If Biden chose Scrooge as his running mate I would still vote for him. The Alternative is the end of America as we know it.
Zero evidence that anyone was sexually assaulted. And if you‚Äôre into bullshit of believing all women, don‚Äôt vote for Biden.
If u can forgive Trump after watching a scripted video like that I'm sure u can do the same with Biden owning up to it. Doubt it.
That &amp; tearing people down. Trump is a destroyer not a builder. Trump is a divider not a uniter. Trump is angry &amp; hate filled. He is dishonest &amp; nothing he says can be trusted. 4 years is enough of that BS. We need someone who can be trusted, is honest and a uniter. we need Biden
Oh here we go, now someone else writing his tweets to cover-up what he says, thinks and believes. COVER-UP is the complete objective of the Biden Clan aka Hunter,laughing all the way the bank! Have they donated a dime to a community center to help poor kids?
Vote for Biden
Thighland?   I thought he was a pussy man.  Your stable genius at work.  87 days until Election Day.  #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpIsAnIdiot #Biden #Biden2020
Biden says downright mind numbing shit all the time and democrats are like ‚Äúignore that guys it‚Äôs just the dementia!!‚Äù
He's right (Trump, I mean). What Biden said (again) was reprehensible and showed how he really feels about an entire race of people.
Well if you take the time use Google a doctor who has a extensive background in helping people with dementia wrote a long post detailing Biden's signs of it... you won't take the time to look it up cause "propaganda" but using your logic since you aren't a doctor your invalid
Their answer for every Biden racist remark is but Trump... Trump doesn't give him a pass to say whatever
My guess is, it'll be for calling out Biden's racist comments made yesterday, how dare I point out the hate from the Dem's only chance to free twitter from Trump... that's racist of me to point out his racist comment! (it'll make sense to Twitter mods, even if not to anyone else)
Mr Biden, you are making the same mistake that Hillary made by over pandering to us. Make your case to the country as a whole. We don‚Äôt need you to hold our hands. We‚Äôll vote for who we want like everybody else. May the best man win.

Joe Biden likes himself some slaves. #MassaJoeBiden
I can't sleep. Omg look at the time. And I can't sleep thinking if Trump win .them I will never sleep in peace. Is all going to be nightmare frome then on.and I really want to go to sleep. Please God make my dreams come true. Let Joe Biden win .so I can go back to sweet dreams.
Because Joe Biden is the man who is going to win this election. With or with out a bug in the campaign. üò∑‚úå
Really we the American people be hearing about a vicine for the past 7 months. Now we the American people have to wait until November. Omg because a lot off people will die by them. So there will be no one to vote for Trump. I will vote for Joe Biden. For a change. üò∑‚úå
Ok that sounds like a good idea. But who's going to pay for the bill . Bill because I'm voting for Joe Biden. I as a veteran and my fallow veterans are changing vote from Trump to Biden. Because to many people are died. And Trump is only telling the American people fake news. üò∑
Well I'm not a professor. And I can't predict stuff sense I can remember. But with my vote and my voice we the real American people who want a better future for our children's and our lives. We will vote for Joe Biden on this election. And with God blessing  Biden will win .Amen
If I just tuned in I would think that was a skit from Saturday Night Live and it was the actor playing Biden but after looking at it again that stupid ass mother f***** actually said that
I will just say this...pls find one audio, one tape, anything close to Trump making a derogatory, racial, comment about Black Americans, here Biden in one week, said 3 different racial remarks, Black ppl Pls wake up
He's trying to gin up something. he's desperate. He's going to be indicted once he's out of office after losing to Biden.
I never knew Biden is Super Duper Human. Hurt God! REALLY! WTF is going on? We need to get back to REALITY!
Lol y‚Äôall think John Leguizamo looked at Biden‚Äôs remarks and said ‚ÄúTHATS MY PRESIDENT‚Äù
The man demonstrated his flagrant pathology &amp; nonstop lies during the campaign but journalists ignored his mental health--many STILL do- and went after Hillary's emails. Trump launches delusional and bewildering rant against Biden: ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs against God!‚Äô
Very interesting watching the Republicans trying to paint Joe freaking Biden to be a radical leftist. #RacistJoe #neoliberalism     #Dixicrat  #GreenEnter
YES, and letsnot forget to make sure Bunker Joe can pass the mental capacity test.  VP JOE BIDEN PRES CREDENTIALS HAIRY LEGS | CREEPY TOUCHES | KIDS SITTING ON THE LAP
Trump said Biden would hurt God and we as a nation went "Well Mr. Biden, will you hurt God?" apparently
It's hysterical and so laughable to hear the monster talk about the mistakes that Biden has made when speaking. The master of dumb sayings &amp; mispronounced words has the nerve to criticize somebody. Really? I wonder where Thighland is? Lmao!

What Biden thinks of Americans right now is not as worse is how Trump thinks of EVERY American dying of the coronavirus.

Mr. Biden, you have my vote...üëçüèº  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Great. Biden is allying with someone who raised money for the murderous contras (and doesn't regret it at all!). Should be truly inspiring for all the Latinx folks who lost loved ones in US funded wars in Central America.
There's no need for Joe Biden to apologize for a misstep but that just goes to show the difference between the double down orange clown and a real man who is willing to admit a mistake. Orangutan man and his sycophant's never accepts blame or responsibility for anything
What you owe to the American public is your resignation.  You‚Äôre throwing out conspiracy theories, putting out debunked and junk science, promoting doctors who believe in demons, and attributing bad character traits to Biden when it describes you - gee whiz, you‚Äôre off the rails!

Donald Trump is the devil, Joe Biden is Jesus. After this is all set and done, Jesus always prevails. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica #DumpTrump
I trust Biden. He‚Äôs never been heard bragging about grabbing women‚Äôs pussies or cheating on his wife with pornstars or having been married multiple times. He may make mistakes but he‚Äôs human. Everything he has done was based on helping the people based on facts presented
Joe Biden is a senile old man who will be a puppet for Democrats that try to establish America as a communist country
Fuck this guy.

You want to elect Joe Biden because he is senile and can take orders to destroy America by turning it into a socialist state anything to make money for you Kamala anything for you to make money
His VP pick will be a strong and qualified candidate given who he has to choose from. The only choice is Biden. Period. Any other ‚Äúchoice‚Äù is Trump.
It doesn‚Äôt matter what he says I‚Äôm voting Down Ballot anyway.  He‚Äôs gonna pick off more of the Black vote and lose to Trump. Like other racist Biden cannot stop himself.
Biden is not ready to be a president what did he do all he going to do is let Bill Gate vaccine approved and sex trafficking free

stop showing Biden while Eric speaks.  Show,Trump.
Joe biden is almost as stupid as a person can get, anyone that votes for him or supports him is absolutely as stupid as a person can ger.

Also, I hate the way this lawsuit can be spun against Democrats. I think this could hurt Biden in places like Pennsylvania. It might be the "right" to do but I don't like the looks of it so close to the election.
It's clear that for Trump, God is a placeholder name for what he values, which is himself &amp; power. And that he assumes that  God and Bible mean power to his audience. In that, he might be right. Those are what he fears Biden will damage.
Joe Biden...count your fuckin days bitch
Trump has taken away your first amendment rights. Biden isn‚Äôt taking away your Second Amendment rights. Try Thinking for yourselves rather than letting that idiot in the White House think for you.
Biden, very reliably, continues to turn the Democrats‚Äô efforts to make people #VoteBlueNoMatterWho into an absolute dumpster üóë fire üî•. Every time the opportunity presents itself. Cue liberal hand-wringing.
Drove from NYC to Tennessee last week..... I saw 3 Biden stickers. I saw literally hundreds of Trump flags, posters, etc....
Biden could come to my house, piss on my dog, and then nominate my dog to be VP, he would still have my vote
Oh I thank you for the blessing even though I did not say anything wrong about Trump nor did I say anything wrong about Biden I said something about manipulating media
They're reaching because they're desperate. As we get closer to election day. The Biden attacks are going to get more ridiculous &amp; classless.
Fuck Trump and Biden. They're both full of shit
One can only hope
Seeing speculation that #JoeBiden may have decided to pick #SusanRice as his VP. If true, #Biden is making a mistake. Ms. Rice has never been involved in a public campaign where she must prove her mettle daily and take a public stand on the issues of the day. She is a weak pick.
But Biden is not the answer, the Left is not the way and the View is a fucking joke
Joe Biden campaign strategist legit main point of focus should be keeping him away from microphones
We should be done with covid when dems select Biden‚Äôs VP, and then he steps down within weeks making the VP the presIdential candidate. Since Biden won‚Äôt have to make any appearances after then they can finish Covid.
Another reason to vote for Joe Biden
Didn‚Äôt see a tweet about any of Biden‚Äôs stupidity.
You're not getting one because biden is frail
I would wait on line to vote Biden out. Wait, does Biden remember he is running for president.... let‚Äôs remind him

I think if Biden could do anything to an all powerful omnipotent being... That would be really impressive!
Biden can hurt God??  Maybe's he's just a vessel then...
If Joe Biden is powerful enough to hurt God, then we definitely need him to be our commander in chief.
When Biden says racist things it‚Äôs not because he‚Äôs racist it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs stupid duh
I think my favorite thing about our big wet king's claim that Joe Biden, an actual practicing Catholic, will "hurt God," is that he doesn't seem to grasp the concept of omnipotence; I'm pretty sure that's one of the key characteristics of God.
Dmitri Firtash paid for his junket to Europe to frame Biden.  Perhaps they have an "arrangement" you know, between friends.
Biden, is that the same thing you said today, that all Black‚Äôs are all the same. No diversity in Black people. Your a racist but you do hide it well.
Joe Biden needs to pick a black woman because he is probably gonna die in office.  So essentially I‚Äôll be voting for a black woman.
Op-ed: Joe Biden has a Latino voter problem. Here's how he can fix it
Biden the guy who cannot string a 5 minute speech together! Good luck with that. Your about as much right as you are wrong.. up leave that there for you to analyze. I care lol... tragic
BINGO!!! They know Biden has some mental problems, so his comments are not malicious. Anyone knows elderly people with health issue can say stupid things.ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Joe Biden has the track record, and will be 1000x President that Trump is. So don‚Äôt worry about us, we good over here
Y‚Äôall mad at Joe Biden for saying black people are more likely to not vote for republicans than other races?  Lol
Biden, anyone whose thinking of voting for you or are going to vote for you, need their heads examine. Your senile old man, who could never run this country, with the exception of collecting money from China, your such a crooked politician. If people don‚Äôt see that their blind.
Biden, your so full of BS, it‚Äôs pathetic. What you said today about the Black‚Äôs sums it all up, I like to see how are you going backtrack on this one, your looking for the Black vote, and your no better than the KKK.
That's true, unlike Biden Trump was elected by his own actions instead of simply being the least offensive southern white guy they could chose to stand behind Barack and keep his mouth shut as much as possible for eight years
"I WANTED TO VOTE FOR BIDEN BUT (X) MADE ME VOTE FOR TRUMP! I'M THE REAL VICTIM HERE!"
You're an adulterer, you put kids in cages and separate them from families. You put paramilitary thugs in cities to beat peaceful protestors. You pardon convicted criminals on more than one occasion but Biden wants to hurt God and hurt the Bible. Pathetic

Biden coming up with anti-black soundbites every two weeks should concern Democrats more than Kanye
The last election Dr. Susan Rice won is senior class president in high school. She would be the weakest VP choice in history next to Dan Quayle. A Biden- Rice ticket is a pure looser.
The amount of racist shit that has come out of Biden‚Äôs mouth is unreal. He did it again today. That‚Äôs who your voting for? Because trump hurt your feelings. Policy has nothing to do with it? Like a teenage drama queen.

you and Schumer are two BS artists. You don‚Äôt want a deal because your not negotiating in good faith, you could care less for the American people, your only agenda is the Nov elections. If Biden keeps making statements like he did today, he better start praying
Clinton won my neighborhood by 95%, Manhattan by 86%, and NY state, overall, by almost 2 million votes. And I'm sure Biden will be close to the same. My vote means absolutely nothing, so talking about it is a huge waste of time.
I wonder how biden would draw that ven diagram. Black , latino, no intersection?
Yeah, at least no 13 year old ever filed charges against Biden- which you can't say about Trump.
There have been like 5x this week I wish Biden would make some immediate very strong retort to some of these statements. This is top 3
He never really had in th numbers he would like.  Now?  well let's just say more than a couple ppl dropped off the Biden Bandwagon.
I guess my takeaway from this (other than the lunacy and potential blasphemy) is that Joe Biden is in possession of a Hattori Hanzo sword.
There is a clear and distinct reason why the GOP is pushing for Dr. Susan Rice to be Biden's VP. Rice's son is arch 45 supporter.
Good lord. Biden is going to hurt God? The GOD? I don‚Äôt know, I think he sounds pretty powerful to me. I don‚Äôt even God would mind if Biden was elected.
Now do Biden
Your move, members of the clergy: Do you think Joe Biden will "hurt God" if he's elected?
And no one broke your window for a Biden or Springsteen sticker. You are lying about that.
This is classical racism plain and simple.   Biden will never say Whites thinks the same. What an insult to every Black American.  This is a double down of what he once said "you ain't black" if you don't vote for him.
The smart ladies of the Sigma Gamma Rho started at Butler University in 1922 would give their full support behind a Biden-Harris Ticket. Black Fraternities would give their unwavering support of Biden and Kamala Harris.
The beautiful ladies of the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority started in 1920 at Howard University would totally support a ticket with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.Biden shouldn't blow this opportunity to choose a Black Greek on his ticket. Kamala Harris would be asset to the ticket.
Trump's Biden is so much cooler.
Would anyone like to defend Biden saying this racist shit
The Alpha Kappa Sorority started in 1908 would give their full support to a ticket of Biden and Harris. The Delta Sigma Theta Sorority started in 1913 would fully support the candidacy of Kamala Harris as VP. Black female power is dynamite.
"How long are Joe Biden's arms? Long enough to box with God? Tune in tonight for our in depth investigation!"
I‚Äôm 67 years old and I will stand on line to vote Biden in a snow storm during zombie apocalypse for as long as it takes, will pack a lunch ü•ó
If Joe Biden wants to win the election it would be in his best interest to select the highly gifted Kamala Harris as his VP. The GOP will have a field day with Dr, Susan Rice who hasn't won an election in years.
Not anymore - is now a dead heat in Ohio !!

I love how a lot of Dems‚Äô responses to the protests have been ‚Äúgo vote, don‚Äôt riot!‚Äù and then present options like Biden
Trump is horrible and he fucked us for years to come this is true, but you think Biden undoing that on carrying on tradition? I'm saying the ship is sinking either way not disagreeing
I'm not saying Biden not a better choice cuz he is, but you replacing a snake who can't camoflage with a serpent who can how is that really better? Why didn't we put Bernie on the ballot? I really don't get it
My point is it was idiotic to vote for Biden in the first place. There were way more viable candidates, why are we that dumb?
Same level Biden may be worse cuz he's a serpent, you aware of his history of legislation passed correct?
I hate the fact that the powers that be are trying to force Joe Biden on me.
This is NOT an aberration.This is who Joe Biden has been his entire political career.    That his progressing dementia gives way to YET ANOTHER regrettable gaffe, you can only surmise that this is what to expect from a Biden Admin.   BLK folks, vote FOR SOMETHING, not against.
This poll is crap, but one election doesn‚Äôt make Iowa no longer a swing state. It won‚Äôt be a tipping point state but I definitely think Biden could win it since I expect a big win for him.
This is why  is the enemy of the people. They don‚Äôt want America to know what is happening. They just want to push their anti American racist narrative!  avoids on-air coverage of Biden's 'Are you a junkie?' remark about taking a cognitive test |
Bro, face it..Biden just lost the black vote. Take your loss like a man and move on.
I  would highly recommend that Biden choose Kamala Harris as his running mate. Kamala's candidacy could ignite that often talked about Pink and Green Army into high gear. Look! The voters can't get excited about Susan Rice but Ms. Harris' candidacy would motivate younger voters.
Let's really address how horrible of a candidate Biden is, he does not have black people's interest at heart either like at all
Susan Rice for VP! Are you kidding me. A Biden- Rice ticket would be the least inspiring  ticket in American politics.
But will it cost him any black votes?  Doubt it.  "Biden bad, Trump worse."
Joe Biden has had the black vote locked up for about 3 or 4 months now. Since then, he continues to disrespect the black base of support he has and honestly, I can‚Äôt even be mad. He knows we aren‚Äôt going anywhere so there isn‚Äôt any blowback coming for him being stupid.
I have never seen a presidential candidate tell a base that‚Äôs already voting for him to suck his political dick more than Joe Biden. There‚Äôs no defending this ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Take it from us who have witnessed so much. This is the most important election ever, and it is on very wobbly legs. No sane person should advocate that Biden skip the debate.
The thing that pisses me off with Dem presidents is that they have an entire media system to cover for them. So whoever takes over for biden, VP will be president, and quickly covid will end after nov and they'll say how fine and dandy everything is under VP but really its not!

You‚Äôre black when it‚Äôs convient and we aren‚Äôt doing the same thing over and over. You are, you‚Äôre voting for Biden no matter what. That‚Äôs insanity
We are now but fake allies like yourself always coming in trying to undermine our demands and saying if we don‚Äôt vote for Biden then we must be pro Trump! Right now we don‚Äôt want to hear from y‚Äôall! We‚Äôre shaking the political landscape, move aside or get rolled over
Dont be stupid..vote for Biden. As a Canadian your vote impacts us. And I've never been so scared to watch your election.. I had no idea your president could impact us so much till trump came. And that's not a good thing. Lets get back to getting along which we cant do with trump
No dought, Biden is incompetent.
I know right?  Biden is a crazy looney
Biden said if you want Medicare for All, Green new deal ect... to vote for someone else.  I'm voting Green like EVERYONE SHOULD.
Hahahahaha it‚Äôs going know where you‚Äôve bowed out of the election twice you should have no say at all .. can you utterly ensure the safety of all Americans voting!! Go hide in the basement with BIDEN !!
... again, Trump gives Biden the perfect campaign ad.
I sincerely hope President Biden orders a thorough investigation into FEMA.  Their top guys should look pretty good in orange, don't you think?
For a country where we have freedom of speech there sure are a lot of assholes that jump down your throat when you say you hate trump and biden. People are so quick to judge and jump down your throat for opinions
He didn't say no because Google is helping Biden, along with much of social media.
is this a hoax from the Biden campaign or is this really from tyt? Please let us know as many friends are so upset and cancelling memberships.
is this seriously from you guys or did the Biden campaign try to pretend to be you? A lot of friends are cancelling memberships over this. Before I do I wanted to check if its true? Please address this as countless people are leaving tyt
Trying to connect the dots between people voting for Biden who also say Kamala Harris's record as a DA and AG disqualify her for VP.
QUESTION: Are you really white? If so, why do you degrade blacks by trying to be their voice. Why do you think that blacks are incapable of speaking for themselves?  I guess "you ain't black" biden and yourself have something in common.  #raciststaci
For the love of humanity American. Do everyone a favor and vote Biden in November. Please ....
Joe Biden - Please SAVE our nation from the fascists
Biden dosent even need Texas and he will win it because trump is a loser just like his supporters

US intelligence says Russia seeking to 'denigrate' Biden
Based upon about 10 different witnesses and if Trump was innocent why didn‚Äôt he allow witnesses to testify? Like John Bolton? Everyone knows what he did and if you think for one second he didn‚Äôt withhold aid for dirt on Biden you are a lot dumber than I thought.
In your 50 years of working for this country your two accomplishments were putting way too many black people behind bars and now this other accomplishment of yours is your lack of ability to speak you are not fit to be president mr. Biden go watch your grand kids
Come On Man üòÇ Biden‚Äôs mind is stuck in the last century üôÑ
since joe biden and the democrats said obviously
"You ain't black."  -Joe Biden
My favorite thing in the world is when people are like ‚ÄúBiden is just as bad as Trump, you shouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden either‚Äù. Okay so who should I vote for? Lol someone has to win and I‚Äôd prefer the one who doesn‚Äôt tweet as much.
Lotta ppl w/ expressed reservations about the covid vaccine describe themselves as up to date on other vaccines, &amp; pro-science. They said under Biden, they'll get it. But under Trump, they won't bc he can't be trusted to administer it properly. Getting rid of him= all we can do.
This is the 1st üö¨ I've had in a month and I justify it as a prize I've awarded myself for 20-something mile bike rides every day this week... And it's just fuckin glorious. Maybe when Biden's sworn in I will never need another cigarette again.
You missed the clarification. What did Trump mean when he said Biden would kill god?
You may wanna shut your mouth about Biden's minor flubs compared to your dude. Biden knows AZ is a state, Trump is incompetent about virtually every aspect of governance. Unless there's a grift involving his family businesses, of course.

Why can‚Äôt more Black people see through this crap? Elitist liberals like Biden keeps trying to tell the black community how to think and vote while insulting them and get a away with it.
Joe Biden is a senile old man who will be a puppet for Democrats that try to establish America as a communist country
You want to elect Joe Biden because he is senile and can take orders to destroy America by turning it into a socialist state anything to make money for you Kamala anything for you to make money
Joe biden is almost as stupid as a person can get, anyone that votes for him or supports him is absolutely as stupid as a person can ger.

Biden could come to my house, piss on my dog, and then nominate my dog to be VP, he would still have my vote

I would wait on line to vote Biden out. Wait, does Biden remember he is running for president.... let‚Äôs remind him
i don't understand why people even dare to think that biden is the better choice when he is directly responsible for mass incarceration
I see you're super biased, but if you actually want trump to win, denying the reality that Biden has a lot of support isn't going to help.
GOD and we all SAID he would do shit like this!! It is the Biden special!! Jesus. One of our worst candidates ever.

How can a politician ‚Äúhurt the Bible‚Äù, let alone ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù??? Isn‚Äôt God a bit more powerful than Joe Biden?   Gotta ponder this one a bit... ü§îü§îü§î
She isn‚Äôt suffering. She‚Äôs just upset their rigged election didn‚Äôt get HRC in the WH. And she‚Äôs depressed because she knows Biden is a senile perverted old fool who can‚Äôt win.
Why is Biden still speaking?  Shut up, pick your running mate, and re-emerge in November.
The last election Dr. Susan Rice won is senior class president in high school. She would be the weakest VP choice in history next to Dan Quayle. A Biden- Rice ticket is a pure looser.
I guess my takeaway from this (other than the lunacy and potential blasphemy) is that Joe Biden is in possession of a Hattori Hanzo sword.
There is a clear and distinct reason why the GOP is pushing for Dr. Susan Rice to be Biden's VP. Rice's son is arch 45 supporter.
Your move, members of the clergy: Do you think Joe Biden will "hurt God" if he's elected?
The smart ladies of the Sigma Gamma Rho started at Butler University in 1922 would give their full support behind a Biden-Harris Ticket. Black Fraternities would give their unwavering support of Biden and Kamala Harris.
The beautiful ladies of the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority started in 1920 at Howard University would totally support a ticket with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.Biden shouldn't blow this opportunity to choose a Black Greek on his ticket. Kamala Harris would be asset to the ticket.
The Alpha Kappa Sorority started in 1908 would give their full support to a ticket of Biden and Harris. The Delta Sigma Theta Sorority started in 1913 would fully support the candidacy of Kamala Harris as VP. Black female power is dynamite.
If Joe Biden wants to win the election it would be in his best interest to select the highly gifted Kamala Harris as his VP. The GOP will have a field day with Dr, Susan Rice who hasn't won an election in years.
This poll is crap, but one election doesn‚Äôt make Iowa no longer a swing state. It won‚Äôt be a tipping point state but I definitely think Biden could win it since I expect a big win for him.
Bro, face it..Biden just lost the black vote. Take your loss like a man and move on.
I  would highly recommend that Biden choose Kamala Harris as his running mate. Kamala's candidacy could ignite that often talked about Pink and Green Army into high gear. Look! The voters can't get excited about Susan Rice but Ms. Harris' candidacy would motivate younger voters.
Susan Rice for VP! Are you kidding me. A Biden- Rice ticket would be the least inspiring  ticket in American politics.
Quick vote before the debates! Only chance Biden has left

Poor Biden just ganging in there on a thread . It will all be over soonüòâ
Right. Recognizing that there are only bad options all around, we need the national government to do something about testing - and it‚Äôs clear that‚Äôs not going to happen until Feb. at earliest (if Biden wins). In the meantime, what is it that‚Äôs fair to expect from a governor?
Joe Biden wants to be #AloneTogether with your kids...
More #TrumpLies &amp; #TrumpCorruption. Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report
Coneheads voting for Biden
Because Joe Biden is a household name associated with Obama who will always hold a special place in the heart of older generation AA‚Äôs. Bernie overwhelmingly won AA millennials and under by a wide margin.
Biden should not debate until Trump produces his tax returns. Period.
I hate Biden just as much as the next person but what was the point in asking him that? Y‚Äôall gon send that man off the deep end üò≠
To remove trump still means to elect Biden - I imagine a Cheney like vice presidency for Kamala
Joe Biden announces that he will not be traveling to Michigan due to coronavirus, choosing instead to remain in the safety of his blood-fueled artificial life pod
I'm with you young lady! GOP for Biden! Rock on! Aloha!
Why should he?  As Napoleon said, ‚ÄúNever interrupt you‚Äôre enemy when he is making a mistake‚Äù.  Trump is doing a bang up job on his own showing why he is unfit for reelection.  Biden‚Äôs time is needed elsewhere, he‚Äôll inherit another disaster from an outgoing GOP administration.
Biden Leading Trump Among Voters Who Favor Being Alive  via
As always, sage observations by someone who has seen Presidents come &amp; go. Trump appealed to so many as an outsider who wasn‚Äôt a career politician; now, ‚Äòthe bloom is off the rose‚Äô. Running Biden in his diminished mental capacity is heinous; many prefer because he‚Äôs ‚Äònot Trump‚Äô.
Joe Biden is older than Trump and is in better cognitive fun at than him.
Why did Joe Biden say a month ago that he‚Äôs been ‚Äútested constantly‚Äù for cognitive decline, but just yesterday said ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken a test‚Äù? Does he even remember?
Trying to explain why voting for joe Biden isn‚Äôt a good idea to someone whose only concern is getting trump out of office is like talking to a brick wall
In Biden‚Äôs world they are both true.
The Biden team is doing internal polling that he will consider when making his pick. Vox is letting the public know how that‚Äôs likely to look. Are you opposed to us having this information? Why?  I will respect his choice and support the ticket no matter what BTW.
But she hasn‚Äôt endorsed Biden. She isn‚Äôt a real black person.
And Biden and anyone would be a fabulous team to lead this broken country.
I have no fear, I don't get hysterical, spent too much time between the rocks and hard places. If Biden wins the country will suffer. All of the pompous asses that supported him will get a real education.
if you're for Biden you ain't no republican!
Keep talking about how Biden is afraid to debate trump. But he sure will anyway.  You know what they say - ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù.
Thank you  for recognizing the cruelty of Trump's #covid incompetence on seniors. I used to visit my Nana (she's 97) 2-3x a week b4 #COVID19 . I can no longer go cook for her, hug her. 45's fecklessness cost quality time w/ the best grandma ever.
Bet she votes for Biden.
üóΩ 91 Days till we VOTE #WeWillVote.        ‚è≥ IS GETTING SHORT.  tRUMP MUST BE VOTED DOWN SO HARSHLY THAT HE CAN'T FIND ANY WAY TO DISPUTE IT.  VOTE JOE BIDEN FLIP THE SENATE STRENGTHEN THE HOUSE  WE DESERVE A PROBLEM SOLVING GOVERNMENT  NOT A PROBLEM
She‚Äôs my second choice, but - she does not have any experience in any areas of domestic policy. She has very limited executive experience and she  hasn‚Äôt served in a legislature either.   She is not nearly as ready to step in as Harris would be.
The second I think Biden will win I will be beefing up security, buying more guns and ammo, making large cash withdrawals, and buying all the gold I can find.
That‚Äôs his goal. Don‚Äôt fall for it.
Those traveling papers that got handed out on Trump's watch are going to be going into full effect in a Biden Harris regime
You know you've drunk the kool-aid when you ignore the point made and assert because someone else may be worse it means he's not bad. He's unintelligent just admit it. (I don't like Biden either)
I'm still shaking my head years later! WTF? Why are the election polls between 45 &amp; Biden even close? It doesn't make sense!
Cable news talking heads, please stop asking Democrats who should Biden pick as his running mate, its annoying. You're not, I repeat, you're NOT going to get an answer!!!! Thank you.
‚ÄúGrace is to Trump what garlic is to vampires.‚Äù
Hillary Clinton would never agree to do an interview with someone as aggressive who‚Äôd call her out for her bullshit and bring up all her and Bill‚Äôs shady business connections and partners, and Joe Biden‚Äôs brain would just shutdown midway thru such an interview
I watched this clip, how is it worse than Obama giving a Biden campaign speech at a funeral?
Biden looks 99
Of course they did.
The communist party of China endorsed joe Biden for president üò≠üò≠üò≠
Biden was partly responsible for the civil war in Syria. It was the Obama administration which used the CIA to train and fund the Islamic State to overthrow the Assad government.
Do you think Biden is changing anything for the better in this regard? This was the VP who was advocating for the Syrian conflict, Afghanistan as well as being a self admitted Zionist.
Thats not how you vote. You do realize Joe Biden is going to be disastrous for other reasons. Or do you not realize that the U.S Government is entirely corrupt?
Can this please be an ad to vote for Biden? Just this one topic alone. Women‚Äôs rights, LGBTQ rights, etc. #VoteBiden
We'd be so much better off if actual Joe Biden was replaced by The Onion Joe Biden.
Just like Biden, you couldn't even write your own stuff, had to plagiarize what I wrote, and change a few words.  Yup Biden copy cat!
I happen to really like Biden but I would vote for anyone who was running against trump.
I think Joe Biden is a shitty person but I don‚Äôt hate him.
Nothing you could say or do would stop me from voting for Biden. Rethink, your vote matters now more than ever.
Unfortunately, it will likely prove that Biden is not up to the job.
Biden? Moral compass? LMAO
Say what I want about Biden? OK, he's stupid, immoral, way way too far to the left, wants to pay for all kinds of stupid shit by overtaxing all of us that work for a living, hasn't gotten anything done in 46 years, uses his office to make family members rich, denounces law &amp; orde
With even the remote possibility of Biden winning, all sensible Americans are buying guns. If Biden is elected we will probably need to protect ourselves. Ask yourself why people didn't have the need for guns and self-protection with Trump
Beto + Biden?  you think 2 morons are better than 1?
Robin, Trump is actually running the 'Bernie File' on BIDEN'. What do you think the 'Biden is controlled by the Radical Left' is?
Is it Joe Biden‚Äôs frontal lobe ?
He removes it to speak when there is no one within 6 feet of him. Yes, Trump made fun of Biden for wearing a mask and he made fun of a reporter for wearing a mask...
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
If ‚Å¶ really wants to make transformational change and ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù he needs ‚Å¶ as his VP.
Delaware was part of colonial Pennsylvania and was called the lower  counties.  So really, Biden‚Äôs move was within the family.  More than that, Biden is going to crush Trump in the Philly burbs‚Äô,  and orange small-handed cadetbone spurs wannabe dictator knows it.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Tell me again Donald Trump is a better steward of the economy than Biden would be...
I had to stop following him and when I told him so his cultist followers came at me with their anti Biden bullshit. They're a bunch of short sighted children. Not exactly big picture people.
Yeah, remember when Biden had to apologize to Obama for his comments? No one cares what happens before the primary. It‚Äôs a debate. After, we all come together.
The television execs will never go for it. It‚Äôs theater not politics (or truth) they want.   Let‚Äôs Scrap the Presidential Debates
154,000 Republicans, Democrats &amp; Independents are dead. My loyalist Trumpster  cousin &amp; her husband (in good health) nearly died from COVID19 in May.  has no plan to end this crisis &amp; never will. My cousin &amp; her husband, are voting 4 Biden. If you lost them, the GOP has lost
I will sacrifice my coffee to sleep well every night with Biden in the White House
The choice is Biden's, no one understands the role better than him and the importance of a collaborative woman who will also voice her dissent. I have my preference and will still support whomever he chooses. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
The ex governor of Pennsylvania says Trump groups‚Äô ad‚Äôs attacking Biden‚Äôs character, and filled with misinformation. He‚Äôs saying more effort and involvement needed!
Biden is a racist.
Support girls rights to not be bothered by creeps. Dont vote for Biden.
You made the point that a future presidency under Biden would look like current events and Nazism.  Ignoring the irony that your prediction of Biden is happening under the current POTUS.  Your point was stupid, you‚Äôve been sacked.  Sometimes you should punt.I really can‚Äôt believe that millions of fools are going to vote for Biden after not attending one debate and saying racist remarks. Vote Republican MAGA TRUMP 2020 KAG let President Trump make your future great in the next 4 years.
The ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt blame China/Only Blame Trump!‚Äù crowd has lost Cramer. This is a huge blow to the Biden campaign &amp; a huge part of the Democratic Party messaging in this election
The why is obvious in my opinion. They're trying to get Michelle as the Nominee at this point because they cant keep hiding Biden's illness.
Biden's last gaffe for me locks it in. They're gonna fucking do it. Or they risk a 50 state blowout.  They have to avoid that for the down ticket effects.
Likely yes, I'm at this point expecting Michelle to take the Nomination after they lay out the case of Biden's mental incompetence at the convention.  Did you see yesterday's Gaffe? It would be a campaign ender if a GOP guy said it. Biden's not home any more...its sad.
In Regards to the 'slip' concerning the 'big get'  It is Team Obama who benefits the most, because they're trying to get Michelle Obama to run. They will lay Biden out as incompetent at the 'convention' make a magical change to the rules and nominate Michelle Obama.
AM UNPRECEDENTED MEDIA "WITCH HUNT" ON TRUMP.... HAS CAUSED THIS.... AFRICANS ARE WAKING UP.... PLANNED PARENTHOOD WAS RACIST(MARGET SANGER) SO WAS JOSEPH BIDEN THE GRANDPA OF "JOE" BLOW.... YES BIDENS FAMILY OWNED SLAVES!!!!!!!!!! BOYCOTT DEMOCRATS.... THIS IS A REPUBLIC....
Joe Bidens GRANDPA(Joseph BIDEN) was A SLAVE OWNER!!! BOYCOTT PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND COMMUNIST DEMOCRATS üôè AMEN
How bout I go to war with the KKK this organization I signed PETITION TO LABEL AN ILLEGAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.... CHANGE IS COMING.... JOE BIDEN'S GRANDPA WAS..... A SLAVE OWNER.... GOOD LUCK HILLARY CAMP.... WHY KILLARY NOT RUNNING AGAIN???(IF TRUMP WAS ELECTED ILLEGALLY? HMM
No JOE BIDEN'S GRANDPA WAS A SLAVE OWNER!!! BIDEN AND SOCIALIST COMMUNIST DEMOCRATS ARE LYING!!!!
Sir, you speak truth; However, don‚Äôt confuse or use this as an example as to why we should vote 4 Donald Duck. Honestly, Trump nor Biden understands the complexity of Black citizens struggling in Amerikkka under Repugs &amp; DemoCRATS. But I think Amerikkka getting ready to learn.
I‚Äôve been surprised by how much the MSM didn't ignore Biden's latest gaffe. I guess there are some news directors &amp; editors having second thoughts about him
The bottom line is Biden can say whatever he wants and the vast majority of black voters don‚Äôt care. His actual history is repulsive considering the black community. But he is a democrat.
...They're trying to get Michelle to step in because Biden is Senile.
Biden can't even answer a scripted question. Without stuttering.
One of Donnys lowest statements. And that‚Äôs saying so much.  Great response from Biden
Biden is the racist . You are so gullible !!
Biden is an old school racist.
BIDEN is NUTS...MAKES KANYE WEST LOOK LIKE THE "VOICE OF REASON"(DIVORCE  sorry  CHOOSE GOD!!! DIVORCE  SHE IS A TRAITOR!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED MY BROTHER!  !!!!!
JOE BIDENS GRANDPA OWNED SLAVES!!! SEEMS LIKE ALOT OF MAN HATERS AROUND... BTW... JOE BIDEN IS A WHITE MAN(NOT A FEMALE BTW WHERES HILLARY???????)

can get caught in motel 6 with 8 midgets 7 sheep 50 chickens a few ducks a donkey and a cow passed out and i would vote for Biden. I'm really Black. Not a sell out to my people and I would never vote for trump who called for the execution of innocent Black children
Trump is all I need. He keeps talking....guaranteed Biden
I don‚Äôt think Peter was putting his affiliation on his sleeve. The POTUS just said that Biden is against God. First off, who says that? Second, that‚Äôs rich coming from a man who has committed infidelity in every relationship he‚Äôs ever had.

Where to begin?  The NRA is a sham.  Nothing is happening to 2A, although I wish you showed as much concern for 1A.  There will always be cops, and Biden wants to increase funding.  Since there are more guns then people in the US, I don‚Äôt see them all magically disappearing.
Joe Biden is completely lost

I just had a crazy idea... What if the announcement is she‚Äôs resigning to be Biden‚Äôs VP?
Evidence that locks down not only the four in question, but others. Such as Obama, Biden, And Clinton.  Prosecutors make deals all the time. It saves the taxpayers money, and it decreases stress on the court.  very limited circumstances on why a prosecutor does not talk to (cont)
Think about this. If Biden gets voted in, Antifa will stop. George Soros will not have to pay any money to riot. There will be no street take overs, no statues violently taken down, IT WILL ALL JUST STOP. That is the political country we live in. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Not a surprise. Biden was picked so Obama can control him.
Pence nailed it. This election IS this important for the Supreme Court. So for that reason and that reason only, suck it up and vote for Biden because the next presidential term will definitely see one, if not two new Supreme Court justices appointments.
Biden has had ALL OF THESE...
Where's the line? I'm there. For those people who aren't sure, just make believe that Joe Biden is the latest iPhone.
You will start a civil war. We know it, they know it. Joe Biden doesn't know it though because he cant remember what he had for breakfast. To the Social Media operator, You're on the wrong side.
Ha! Good one . Hidin‚Äô Biden. Lollll
Not ‚ÄúSleepy‚Äù Joe Biden?üôÑ
What about Biden ? Why he don‚Äôt speak ? Is he ok ? What about your brother who make the death rate for the virus 800% more than other state
Compared to Biden, he is Sherlock Holmes
How come no one's complaining and seeing racial and sexual discrimination,  when Biden only picking his VP by race and color(woman and black) It's illegal on any jobs..it's the law..Democrats don't follow their own laws..
Obama and Biden had 8 years to make Black voters lives better. Why didn‚Äôt they?They don‚Äôt give a shit about the black voters or any other voters. They only care about doing nothing and making a lot of money stealing from hard working taxpayers. They make corrupt deals with China
Biden does not want to debate. That's fine, tell him he's running for Miss America and to pick out a nice bathing suit, preferably one that shows off his hairy legs.
I want to be clear, Every Conservative actively participating in door knocking, phone banking, or any kind of campaigning should be hammering home Biden's Mental State.
If they want to go through with it: They'll reveal Biden's full mental state in a short but brutal video stating that their nominee is not Competent. That a new nominee needs to be chosen and an open nominating process begins.   If they stick with him, they're throwing it.
In other words is #biden and are #Democrats saying they wouldn't have locked down? Or are they really that transparent when it comes to bald-faced lies? Third option: they think we are as stupid as rocks.   My guess is the second.
Democrats Aren't Even Campaigning And Now Biden Will SKIP The DNC!!  via
#Biden can barely speak normally much less come up with a plan to fight #COVID__19 . The same could be said of #Trump. You know who I trust to be our leader?
Did Biden write that?
I got hard numbers now to back that up. The DNC ground game is Non-Existent. 1 million doors knocked on last month by the GOP even NOW during this.  None for Biden.   If Michelle had won the 2020 nomination out right its a whole different game. Now? GOP would go to 11.
If they do not get this debate.  You will see TV ads FLOOD the scene and all platforms about Biden's Mental State.
Joe Biden doesnt even know what he had for breakfast let alone the VP choices.  Make no mistake. He wont be the nominee.
If the field ops dont pick up for the DNC even if they Replace Biden on the ticket it might not be enough.
If the 4th debate is real then Trump's squad is convinced Biden's Mental state is in absolute Ruin and they want to exploit it as many times as possible.
Saw this coming 30 miles away.  They know that Biden is Mentally ill, that he's slipping away., That his wife and the DNC are engaged in Elder Abuse and will do EVERYTHING they can to make sure they dont have video evidence of it.
Its an excuse alright.  Biden's not gonna be the nominee at this pace.
Reminder: DNC has not gone through the official nominating process yet.  This is not a Pro-Forma thing. This is required.  I said before i didnt believe Biden would be the nominee... still holding to that.
You are a dope Jack. Wake up, do you think Biden is going to be flying commercial sitting next to crying babies?
Biden agreed to debates case close .
This story is terrifying for anyone who thinks Biden has this locked down.
Seriously???? I know now for sure your not listening to Joe Biden.
hint: Biden is broken. This is Elder Abuse, and the Democratic Party has no place to go.  Surrender: Would be a better option than what is unfolding right now.
#Biden2020 may win. But his campaign is a train wreck and so is he.
Biden‚Äôs gonna fuck this up, isn‚Äôt he?
Biden has not been asked a tough question since he announced he is running . He has wife take questions on FOX today . Are you on drugs ?
Yeah right Trump gets asked all the tough questions !! Are you on this earth ? Biden has his wife speaking for him on FOX lol !!
Adam Schiff must have the put his file he had on the Russian collusion with Joe Biden‚Äôs files at the Delaware university basement. Maybe the DOJ or FBI can help find all that info he had. Maybe they should conduct a early morning raid. Democrats are so Fu-king corrupt.
You have to be very Special to say you are voting for Biden when he can‚Äôt even speak coherently. How can this man speak to world leaders and try to make deals? We have a great President right now that just needs majority congress and senate to get more done to help Americans.
Its Biden who wouldn't make sense
Jill Biden promises her husband will debate Trump this fall, is 'close' to choosing running mate   I hope he gets a good nights sleep
Why has all this hunter biden stuff been forgotten?
it's gotten to the point where I'm actually repulsed by Joe Biden.
There is no chance that whoever is making the pick, we know it‚Äôs not Biden, will pick
The socialists have been trying these bogus investigations for almost 4 years!! And have come up with absolutely nothing!üòÅ They should investigate Biden who sold his office to enrich his family with China and Ukraine!!üòù
ZERO #empathy from a complete #Narcissist. I don‚Äôt care what negatives #Biden may have. They are not this.  If #Trump had been #POTUS after 9/11, he would have been complaining about the traffic delays in NYC due to search and rescue.  That‚Äôs how he sees the world, thru a mirror!
I wish Biden would Sit for an interview like that !! It won‚Äôt happen because he will not be allowed !
That will be the MSM narrative yes.  I can tell you in a contested area of PA...  I sit at outdoor dining by a couple of local coffee shops...The talk on Biden is about his Mental State.
Which now is a mistake.  This is effectively saying to the public 'Biden's Cognitive Decline is Real'
I mean I hope whoever is making the decisions for Biden picks her
I hope Biden picks her.
Please ask Jill Biden why her husband won‚Äôt do the interview with Chris Wallace ty

What can civilian Biden do? How about your Trump fellow? He can invite people to WH and perform his usual do nothing plan.
Well Chump, laying down and rolling over  for Schumer and the Hag, yet again!  Let's bail out all the Dem states and municipalities, pension funds and then go for Biden's Plan (he'll be POTUS by then.  Adios!
If Biden refuses to debate he will lose the election. It will look like he is scared.  Bottom line .
Running an entire campaign on just the strong anti-Trump sentiment out there can take you a long way. But for the Biden campaign, it‚Äôs gone as long as it can go. Unless they can drum up actual enthusiasm FOR Biden among at least 25% of the voters, this car is out of gas
IT‚ÄôS AGAINST THE LAW DISCRIMINATING AGAINST BIDEN JUST BECAUSE OF HIS AGE (AGEISM)‚ùóÔ∏èBIDEN NEEDS DEBATES
And I‚Äôm willing to bet Biden‚Äôs name recognition is lower than any Dem nominee at this point in the race... which is incredible for a former 2-term VP
Democrat leaders &amp; their media supporters talk so much about Trump &amp; so little about Biden, that at this late stage in the process there‚Äôs a legitimate risk that a million of their voters will accidentally vote for Trump on Election Dsy because that‚Äôs the only name in their heads
Biden has a speech impediment that makes it hard for him to formulate the right words for his thoughts on the spot.

Listen to "8/3/2020" by Derek Varsalona ‚öì  The Democrats Don't want Joe Biden to debate. They know too well that Joe Biden will get manhandled by President Donald Trump. Listen to my take.

How about one reason to vote for Biden. He will pick the most qualified people to run the government, not his deadbeat cronies.

Anyone that votes for Biden has no love for this country and wants us to go down in flames
They might have no choice if Biden really has had a full collapse of his mental facilites. We have no clue who is on the ballot in 90 days...
Nothing to laugh at.  Joe Biden agrees with Defunding the Police Nationwide and giving criminals free reign while suppressing the rights of law abiding citizens.  In Joe Biden's world its better to be a criminal. That is Chaos.

I got a fundraising email on behalf of biden from kamala.  i think it's going to be her.
Howie,  #Biden made his decision because #KamalaHarris is a perfect #Corporatist hack.  #BernieSanders sold out a long time ago to become a sheepdog for the Democratic Establishment.  You are trying to voter shame his supporters. Well, that's their decision not Bernie.
üí•Joe Biden  has no idea who is VP candidate is they have not told him yet!üòù
So you favor discrimination and not even interviewing the best possible candidates? That‚Äôs your stand? If Biden said he was only considering a man and not even interviewing a woman would that be ok? I‚Äôd say no. You?
If Biden wins in November, imagine the inauguration.  Who would even want the gross Trump family there??
Biden needs to say that. A lot. And loud
Trump is thinking g about postponing 2020 election. CV-19 is not going away like the Republican party wish it would. Vote Biden.
#Biden should give  a Presidential Medal of Honor at the #StateoftheUnion next year!  Maybe take back #Rush‚Äôs at the same time.
In every Presidential election year their have been debates by those politicians running. It looks like this is going to be the first election with no debates thanks to the scared Joe Biden and the fake news media that is protecting this weak democrat candidate.
Soooo lucky.  Enjoy üëåüèª
Yeah jerk, if it wasn‚Äôt for trump we would have ,by now been OWNED by China. Stupid leftist dems kissing up allowed China to steal, cheat ,control Take our factories. They profited from that abuse, hunter biden among others. All involved should b prosecuted! üë∫üë∫üë∫

Biden or Trump. Who's Better for the Market?
The MSM truly are ‚Äúthe enemy of the people‚Äù! They lie, distort, are rude, disrespectful &amp; don‚Äôt cover any positive news on Pres Trump &amp; are only interested in destroying Pres &amp; his administration while asking Biden what‚Äôs his favorite flavor ice cream? Real hard ball questions
94 days until Election Day. Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt want to have any debates. How can you vote for someone if you don‚Äôt know what he stands for? He only helped himself and his family for the past few decades. He pressured Ukraine into dropping charges on his corrupt son. Vote Red
When will Biden speak up against the senseless killings that have been going on by the anarchists! That are not being talked about and these people lives also matter!!
So all of a sudden you care that our people are safe? Really? Interesting how it‚Äôs so close to election time and now your so worried. It wouldn‚Äôt have anything to do with the fact that you are trailing Biden in the polls sooooo badly right? Go back to building buildings!
Shy Biden supporters for sure /s
Odds on #Biden getting Covid right before the debates and bowing out? Any takers?
He made his own decision.  No wonder you are fans of Biden.  #morons
I wonder how many will vote for him anyway
2/ ... like keeping their nominee hidden, nixing a real convention, &amp; likely avoiding any Biden-Trump debates. So when your opponents are engineering a pretty strong strategy of destroying the rules, it‚Äôs a great idea to suggest breaking some too...
I think this VP choice is most impactful because if Biden does only run for a single term the VP is going to probably be the de facto Nominee in 2024.
(Yesterday) Biden is supportive of something called #BLACKlivesMatter AND has vowed to pick a woman running mate and likely a Black one for political reasons, rather than just picking the best person, and he says Trump is divisive? Yeah. Ok. YK
They‚Äôll blame it on Biden.

I am the middle and didn‚Äôt vote trump or HRC last election. I don‚Äôt think trump is the devil but there must be someone better. Biden is a puppet and the left have done all it can to push me from considering their candidates at all.

Finally #biden breaks his silence and says something reasonable. More of this and #trump is sunk.US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election
WOW WOW, Just for the heck of it, I listened on youtube the first debate between then candidate Trump and Hillary and EVERY AMERICAN should watch it. :PRESIDENT TRUMP was correct on everything he said and what he would do, Biden is more is far left than Clinton. WATCH IT!
Typical liberal response...deflect and post an irrelevant article. Figures. Well I'm done here. You haven't made your case and Biden is still a racist for implying black hegemony of thought. Later
STILL VOTING FOR BIDEN!

It‚Äôs amazing to me because a lot of the Obama (and even Biden in most instances) policies would actually help people in those communities.. and the basketball players have promoted them in many ways.. it‚Äôs incredible.. and to me the best solution is-
And if we do some of the policies that Biden/Obama and most of the bball players are in support of.. we‚Äôd actually be helping to curb these statistics too.. she‚Äôs actually just flat out wrong in her tweet..
Forget Biden, right now we are NOT safe in Donald Trump's America. 160,000 dead and counting. And he shows NO compassion for any of them. He never mentions them, even when pressed, just that he claims to have done more testing than any other country. What an ass. Good riddance.
Lmao bro sometimes I be peeping Trump in interviews and just be wondering if he knows wtf is even goin on. Same with Biden
Lmao facts my guy Trump = Loud evil  Biden = Sneaky links evil. üòÇüòÇ
No. Im not telling anyone how to vote. That was more a joke than a directive. Biden, like Hillary are notorious for their mouths affecting their poll numbers. The idea of them is more appealing to people than they actually are.
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
Whats worse is he was asked about whether he would continue temporary protective status for refugees from Cuba and he didnt want to answer the question. He literally didn't need to say any of it let alone throw black people under the bus to make a garbage point..Biden is Biden...
The only thing Biden is fucking up is his election chances by being out in public with his mouth moving.
Well, it's without my vote. I can overlook a lot of things, but not blatant racism. I was really trying because I hate Trump, but at this point, I'm sitting this out. Biden should step down before the nomination and save us from this nightmarish situation.
He hasn't officially been nominated. If Bernie was in the lead and he said this, every letter in the book would be thrown at him to step down. Biden is a racist. And, he's going to take us down with him if we allow him to continue as the nominee. This isn't going to go away...
And Biden should step down before the nomination process. His advisors aren't the problem. He is. Biden is always going to be Biden.
Joe Biden is planning to use taxpayer money to hold an unholy ceremony to summon Satan to kill all the children in America. DISGUSTING!!

Kneel before biden!
And it will be the best vaccine.  Much better than the biden/obama/hillary/soros/gates vaccine
Can someone explain to me why the only time Biden says something coherent and connected, it ends up making me even less likely to vote for him? He never "stutters" when he says he's against Medicare for All or that black people arent diverse minded.
So Biden... Is a better choice?  Crazy Kev. No police and rights slowly removed
Clearly, you dont know any black people because you aren't likely to find two in the same room that think alike on anything either. People are humans, not these arbitrary lines bigots like Biden draw around them. You agreeing with homogeneous black thought makes you racist, too.
Biden needs to stop talking. I know he means something else when he says this, but we are voting for him because he is a democrat, not because he is the right person for the job. Nothing intelligent comes out of his mouth.
I notice you folks never use quotes when posting Biden's comments, with plenty of inrterruption of the normal flow. But it doesn't really matter because every single dem doesn't care what
But we're diving the party by demanding Biden get behind us rather than the other way around. FOH. Our system is broken when a near universal consensus is ignored by the defacto leader of the party.
I mean, both are true. Were kind of in a no-win situation of the goal is having a mentally sharp non-senile president. Argue any other point you want but its pretty clear both Trump and Biden are in advancing mental decline.
Joe Biden is dangerous to The United States and the Free world- as we know it. Not him personally- but his handlers and backers.

You need new material. The Turnip's war room is showing a lack of skill and ingenuity and a lack of new ideas. Really copies Trump's total lack of offering anything new. Attacks on Biden in basement are pathetic.  Whenever Turnip leaves bunker, people get virus.

If this clears up, the argument or even tames significantly even with no help from Trump and thw Republicans, the argument for Biden for a lot of people goes away. Hes gotta do better to make a case for himself that isn't just mot being Trump. Which means adopting left ideas..
It must be, Trump stuck his nose out of the White House and saw Joe Biden's shadow. Scared the shit out of him.

But all of that ends November 3rd. Once Trump is gone, there is no excuse. It would be irresponsible to let Biden run the status quo and disillusion people who were convinced that Dems were the answer and their lives didn't improve. That's the real danger.
But, that also requires acknowledging the weaknesses and flaws of who we elect. Biden literally spent his first few decades in congress propping up segregationists. I don't trust him. But if he's going to be the guy i'm going to be on his ass keeping him correct.
Biden won a majority of old people. When you go by age democraphics, you see the same split in ideology regardless of color. people under 45 largely are more progressive and less likely to support neoliberals like Biden
"some" the selective prejudice of white liberals to see some black support as a hive mind. Its the same as assuming that because Biden won SC primary that overall the black vote was his despite seeing incredibly varied support specifically by age demographic telling another story

Bernie has always voted and endorsed based on pragmatism just as Bernie has always spoken, done direct action, and written legislation based on ideals.  No he doesn‚Äôt have a scheme. He endorsed Biden just as he endorsed Hillary and Obama.
Fucking Auto correct. Not when Biden decided to run for president nor did I become mixed when he said what he said to that reporter

Their answer for every Biden racist remark is but Trump... Trump doesn't give him a pass to say whatever
Mr Biden, you are making the same mistake that Hillary made by over pandering to us. Make your case to the country as a whole. We don‚Äôt need you to hold our hands. We‚Äôll vote for who we want like everybody else. May the best man win.
I can't sleep. Omg look at the time. And I can't sleep thinking if Trump win .them I will never sleep in peace. Is all going to be nightmare frome then on.and I really want to go to sleep. Please God make my dreams come true. Let Joe Biden win .so I can go back to sweet dreams.

Ok that sounds like a good idea. But who's going to pay for the bill . Bill because I'm voting for Joe Biden. I as a veteran and my fallow veterans are changing vote from Trump to Biden. Because to many people are died. And Trump is only telling the American people fake news. üò∑
Well I'm not a professor. And I can't predict stuff sense I can remember. But with my vote and my voice we the real American people who want a better future for our children's and our lives. We will vote for Joe Biden on this election. And with God blessing  Biden will win .Amen
If I just tuned in I would think that was a skit from Saturday Night Live and it was the actor playing Biden but after looking at it again that stupid ass mother f***** actually said that
I will just say this...pls find one audio, one tape, anything close to Trump making a derogatory, racial, comment about Black Americans, here Biden in one week, said 3 different racial remarks, Black ppl Pls wake up
He's trying to gin up something. he's desperate. He's going to be indicted once he's out of office after losing to Biden.
I never knew Biden is Super Duper Human. Hurt God! REALLY! WTF is going on? We need to get back to REALITY!

It's clear that for Trump, God is a placeholder name for what he values, which is himself &amp; power. And that he assumes that  God and Bible mean power to his audience. In that, he might be right. Those are what he fears Biden will damage.

Don't worried Marc Biden VP she will not be mob affiliated/Corrupt CRIMINAL ,   will show last 8yrs taxes , Not A Sexoffenders , Not indebted/Cover-ups with any Country ...will Defend faithful loyal to USA an Respect our Veterans Troops Not Betrayed our military

He never really had in th numbers he would like.  Now?  well let's just say more than a couple ppl dropped off the Biden Bandwagon.
I guess my takeaway from this (other than the lunacy and potential blasphemy) is that Joe Biden is in possession of a Hattori Hanzo sword.
There is a clear and distinct reason why the GOP is pushing for Dr. Susan Rice to be Biden's VP. Rice's son is arch 45 supporter.
Good lord. Biden is going to hurt God? The GOD? I don‚Äôt know, I think he sounds pretty powerful to me. I don‚Äôt even God would mind if Biden was elected.

And no one broke your window for a Biden or Springsteen sticker. You are lying about that.
This is classical racism plain and simple.   Biden will never say Whites thinks the same. What an insult to every Black American.  This is a double down of what he once said "you ain't black" if you don't vote for him.
The smart ladies of the Sigma Gamma Rho started at Butler University in 1922 would give their full support behind a Biden-Harris Ticket. Black Fraternities would give their unwavering support of Biden and Kamala Harris.
The beautiful ladies of the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority started in 1920 at Howard University would totally support a ticket with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.Biden shouldn't blow this opportunity to choose a Black Greek on his ticket. Kamala Harris would be asset to the ticket.
Would anyone like to defend Biden saying this racist shit
The Alpha Kappa Sorority started in 1908 would give their full support to a ticket of Biden and Harris. The Delta Sigma Theta Sorority started in 1913 would fully support the candidacy of Kamala Harris as VP. Black female power is dynamite.
"How long are Joe Biden's arms? Long enough to box with God? Tune in tonight for our in depth investigation!"
If Joe Biden wants to win the election it would be in his best interest to select the highly gifted Kamala Harris as his VP. The GOP will have a field day with Dr, Susan Rice who hasn't won an election in years.

This is why  is the enemy of the people. They don‚Äôt want America to know what is happening. They just want to push their anti American racist narrative!  avoids on-air coverage of Biden's 'Are you a junkie?' remark about taking a cognitive test |
I  would highly recommend that Biden choose Kamala Harris as his running mate. Kamala's candidacy could ignite that often talked about Pink and Green Army into high gear. Look! The voters can't get excited about Susan Rice but Ms. Harris' candidacy would motivate younger voters.
Susan Rice for VP! Are you kidding me. A Biden- Rice ticket would be the least inspiring  ticket in American politics.
Joe Biden has had the black vote locked up for about 3 or 4 months now. Since then, he continues to disrespect the black base of support he has and honestly, I can‚Äôt even be mad. He knows we aren‚Äôt going anywhere so there isn‚Äôt any blowback coming for him being stupid.
I have never seen a presidential candidate tell a base that‚Äôs already voting for him to suck his political dick more than Joe Biden. There‚Äôs no defending this ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I really think there is a window, not a large one, but a window where he stays on (in the advent Biden wins). If key Dem Senators (Sinema?) make a push, Biden may be open to a bi-partisan show of unity in what is definitely not a role at the top of his radar.  Here's hoping lol!

Remember Biden's Crime Bill? Right. This is what people said about Trump before he won the Presidency:
Yes, Epstein's island is scary as fuck.  Biden owns land on an Island next to his.  What do you think good luck means?  We are in the storm.  Did you see Trump talk yesterday about we might not see him for awhile.
Wasn't calling him that before he was President. Only thing you can find on Biden is his famous Crime Bill. But keep defending that man.

What weird alternative reality are we in. Everything they say Trump is, Biden is on tape being. Yet that's who they've put up for election.
STFU serious? That's classic!
Do you prefer keeping Trump another 4 years?!  That‚Äôs better than Biden?!  Please vote for Biden &amp; ‚Äúf‚Äù the Republicans insteadüôè?
For the Lord Joe Biden
Think you're serving this morning because I brought up what Biden said? Nah.
Joe Biden says otherwise (about diversity, which I don't agree with)
Your Twitter feed looks like a German beer hall in 1934. Racism is the dip for your chips, so you should appreciate Biden‚Äôs intemperate views, as much as someone in the UK has the depth and experience to understand the intracies of urban-suburban busing in the 70s in the USA.

Is Biden?
He has said repeatedly that he is not voting for Biden. Also i think he might be past the voter registration date. So he he would have to vote absentee in California.
I mean, if you actually deep dive Biden's gun control plan; he basically intends to make a large portion of law abiding citizens pay a large amount of taxes on items they already own, be registered like criminals, and if that doesn't work actually make them criminals. Scary.

Idiot haters can't even figure out. Let's see.. if Biden won't do interviews now and is too afraid to speak then either lets move them up or add more. But thinking is not an option for Trump haters.

I love that you posted this meme about the "radical" left, and defending Biden.  But Biden is against healthcare for all He still wants to give more money to police and doesn't want to legalize weed.  He is not radical.

Biden wasn‚Äôt my first choice.  Hell, he wasn‚Äôt my fourth choice.  But I am proud to suppport the man that can write so eloquently about his faith...and I‚Äôm an agnostic!
Biden's comment was clumsy, but I understand what he was trying to say. a Florida Cuban is very different from me, an upstate Spaniard.
RUSH: I'm gonna play two things for you. One happened back in 1987 on Nightline, the other one yesterday with Joe Biden.
Pelosi, Biden, and Warren are buying Cuban boys to mentor them in butt fucking like Gaetz does? Are they doing this in the non existent pizza basement where Hillary murdered Seth Rich?
Thanks again fellow Andy!  Here's Rochester NY back in June...
pretty sure the debate will just increase Biden's lead. Trump, you should just not debate, better for you. Lie ,lie, lie, &amp; etc...
Biden‚Äôs comment about the diversity of Black Americans vs. Latinos really made me think about diversity among the presidential candidates. ü§®

yeah its just a classic biden foot in mouth for a little nibble momen but thats a huge apples and oranges thing to compare anyway "latino voters" encompasses dozens of cultures so... yes it seems diverse

Mr Biden - If you didn't mean what you said, what did you mean?
Ms. Harris is great in Congress. If you want to lose to the GOP have any female politician! running as VP. Swing voters have tired of politicians. Biden is enough. Need a Black Female? how about Ursula Burns(Xerox), Mellody Hobson or Judy Smith or several other blk female CEOs
then don't. If you really can't decide between trump and biden and the VP is the make or break, then no one needs you. Racist or not racist. really that is the choice. If the VP makes a difference then we know where your thoughts really lay.
Kanye is wrong and no one should vote for him.

Unless Biden hurts God, I guess???
Why do republicans make Biden sound cooler in theory than in reality? I‚Äôd love to vote for a Biden that would kill god. Instead we‚Äôd get a Biden that balloons police budgets and passes tax cuts for billionaires. Way lamer
Did you actually accuse Joe Biden of wanting to hurt God??  Did you really do that??  Unbelievable the depths you will sink to.  You do realize God watches everything you do right?  Including using his holy Bible as a prop.
Idiot haters can't get that Biden hasn't done one single interview. They can't think as to why.
I'm sorry. But this is silly. He'll apologize like a grown up and this is over.   Biden faces backlash for comparing diversity in African American, Latino communities

The strategy boggles the mind. Biden is basically an aging pitcher whose fastball tops out at 86, and the Republicans are mocking him while running a guy who‚Äôs throwing the ball 58 feet.
Scare tactics. Biden is a gun OWNER. He never said defund the police. #TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks
It won‚Äôt be pretty but it sure will be entertaining when the US marshals drag him from the White House after Biden is sworn in! Talk about must see TV!

I mean whatever side of God you are on...if Biden is able to hurt God...that alone means he should be in charge...just so we don't anger him.
Biden's team enables his racism, racist remarks.  And the #media's goal is to protect #Biden and to get him elected.  In other words, no surprise on either point.
Joe Biden is from Scranton. Having this information at my disposal makes it necessary for me to send the least-political political tweet of all time:  WOULD Michael Scott have voted for Joe Biden
Trump:tries to paint his opponent- a devout Catholic - as being against God and religion.
When I heard Biden was gonna take down God I had no choice. I'm not mature enough to ignore it lol
It could be the same thing all the other women in the primary lost to Biden. We should all figure out what they had in common.
Are you saying that you will vote for Trump is Biden chooses a VP that you do not like?  I find it interesting that the VP choice is such an important factor.  Has never been much of an issue historically.
It's Joe Biden! Hide the women and children. No God-fearing mortal is safe. He'll take your religion. He'll take your birthday.   Gimme a break POTUS. You get more pathetic by the day. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

I would like to see less Christianity in the political realm. The lessons of Jesus are in no way represented in current group that claims to be Christians. BUT without a doubt, Biden would crucify Drumpf on a bible verse challenge.
Joe Biden emerges as the ultimate anime protagonist on a ‚ÄúI will kill God‚Äù platform.
This is consistent with prior QPac polling, but hasn‚Äôt been supported by other quality pollsters. Seems a bit too rosy for Biden in KY/SC and for McGrath. Jury‚Äôs still out on Harrison IMO.
Wow... the Ethiopian grasping beetle couldn't put on a better performance reaching for straws than Donald Trump. He sleeps around, divorces, doesn't repent or pray, and can't even hold the Bible upside right, but Joe Biden is against God. Okay then.
The only changes that should be made are fewer or better yet no debates. Anyone who hasn't made up their mind about the candidates this year is in a coma. Biden should tell Trump he'll debate him when he coughs up those tax returns. Otherwise, not interested.
I even heard Biden mockingly waived a Bible in front of a church after trampling unarmed US citizens!  Oh wait........
It is what it is, but never forget that a Biden Presidency will hurt God‚Äîyou don‚Äôt want to hurt God, do you Tom?
RUSH: He's saying that African-Americans are like-minded simpletons. This is as racist a comment as anything they want to try to lay off on us, folks.
If you vote for Biden, you‚Äôd be breaking your streak
Until we stop this "vote for the lesser of two evils" dynamic, and the system gets a major overhaul, then it will always be like this. I feel like Biden is just a puppet and they're all complicit.
Trump is so devoid of impulse control that even if a major Biden gaffe dominated the news cycle and threatened his campaign, he'd just get jealous and do something to get attention back on himself.  Addiction is a b*tch!
Can God create a politician so powerful, that God himself cannot overpower him? And if so, why Joe Biden?
My God, this campaign is in an utter tailspin grasping at absolutely anything to try and damage Biden.    Every line of attach boomerangs back on Trump ten-fold.
I love this President. I just wish I could decorate my car and house with Trump decor. No one touches a Biden banner but I know some rotten disgusting Dem will burn down my house and key my car!
I have to say: if Biden can hurt god imagine what he could do to Trump.
Donald Trump seems to think pretty highly of Biden‚Äôs potency.

President Joe Biden.
üíØ I've actually been worried that the GOP would dump Dummy and put Kaisch on the ticket. He would take November in a landslide; so many Biden voters are just looking for a person of decent character.
Nice try. You took this out of context. Joe Biden was speaking about the shared experiences of America's African-American community vs. political and cultural diversity of Latinos like conservative Cubans to income diverse immigrants from S. America, to poor refugees from Mexico.
Well.....Biden is better than that horrendous orange monster in the white house.
Yeah Biden really couldnt have asked for a better lead in. Esp now that hes found his voice these last few weeks, I think hes more than ready to take on Trump.   Trumps ppl really are idiots. Per usual, they misread the moment, the format, their opposition, and their own guy lol.
Joe Biden just said that African Americans (with some exceptions) all think alike while Latin Americans are more diverse.  Aren't you outraged?
Crazy I know, I think we need another 4 years of Trump. Biden will only put the mask back on. Things will seemingly go back to normal, but they will be far from that. We‚Äôll all go back to not being pissed off every day and real change will be on hold - indefinitely - once again.

Watch the #AxiosOnHBO interview.  Trump‚Äôs serious cognitive  deficiency on full display for 37 incoherent &amp; ignorant minutes. Biden stumbles over words as he‚Äôs fought a lifelong battle  over stuttering disorder . Big difference.
Let me ask you something. Do you honestly think that if Biden is elected he will take away religion, suburbs, and our police?
To clarify, the only good outcome for the U.S. is if both Trump and Biden instantly evaporate from planet Earth. Alongside parliamentary politics, the rich, the patriarchy, etc.  I was commenting on the likelihood of Biden losing, not my desire for it to happen.
Revealing his poker hand, bigly.    This campaign is in a flailing tailspin, and he thinks that the debates with Biden are his Hail Mary.  üôÑ
I almost want Biden to choose Rice to see their reaction.
I have felt the same quite some time. Hopefully people will get out and vote in November, and things in this country can start to improve. Regardless of whether Biden has lost a step or two, his character is what matters. 45 is ignorant and evil. Biden is not.
I‚Äôm pulling for Susan Rice. I‚Äôm currently reading her memoir, and she‚Äôs very impressive. She could be Biden‚Äôs brain.

Undone and redone are 2 different things. Re-done suggests they've been made better. All this #Moron has done is reverse and eliminate good practices and laws. No worries, though. Biden can undo all of Chump's EOs.

As did virtually every other politician of that time but in 2012 Biden spoke out in favor of marriage equality and was key in moving it forward.  Trump has done everything he can to take away rights from day one hard stop.

It is just jawdropping how unmeet to the moment Biden is.   He beholds the energetic justice movements in this country, addressing urgent social and environmental needs, and says, "Come on, man."   Yesterday's man indeed.
VP Biden, you‚Äôre well-known for taking Amtrak. What are your three favorite Ticket to Ride boards and why?
RCP is a straight average that randomly excludes pollsters, which poses two serious problems. This is why 538 is a lot better. And even in 538‚Äôs average, Biden is down to 7.6‚Äîbut that‚Äôs not six.
I meant Biden not third party!
You can't trust polls, people lie to the polls or data is insufficient. Primary models are where its at, and all of them point to Trump. Every president has won an election based on enthusiasm among likely voters, which Biden doesn't have.

he has done several but the info is also posted to read...  Trump has no ability to debate the issues as he has no specific plans and never has.  Ask Biden to speak more but screw pointless debates.

Biden won't go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
I agree! Biden 2020!
I‚Äôll speak for my father. (No Twitter for flip phones üò¨) He will be casting his first vote ever for a Democrat (Biden). For him, the first straw was McCain. The last straw was literally everything that followed.

Biden can deligate, unlike this idiot. Lock the sob up.
In 2008, the nominee wasn‚Äôt hashed out until lot later. We‚Äôve known Biden was the nominee since Super Tuesday. Doesn‚Äôt need to be this long.

Biden's best ads are written by trump
Facebook‚Äôs fact-checkers have ruled claims in Trump ads are false ‚Äî A Washington Post review of those assessments show unanimity that Trump campaign ads about Joe Biden's position toward defunding the police are false.
Or maybe, just maybe he, like Beck acknowledged that Trump is the President. Trump isn‚Äôt God, but against Biden, at least he has a shot to do the right things. NeverTrump for the sake of NeverTrump is its own form of idolatry

In one of the stock market‚Äôs brief downward slides during its long march upward this summer, worries about the prospects of a Biden presidency began to dominate the chatter, and for seemingly solid reasons.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden won't go to Milwaukee, the party's convention city, to give a speech ‚Äî and neither will anyone else. Instead, Biden will accept the Democratic nomination from his home state of Delaware.
Tbf if I'm Biden I'm saying nothing.  Let Trump do the talking.
To the public Biden is basically just pitching "Trump won't be here anymore", but to the upper class and funding base of higher levels of the dem machine he's promising a turning back of the clock to pre-2016 levels of mobilization, a closing of the pandora's box of radicalism
The left wing groups (? seems to largely be nonprofit listbuilding groups with the exception of the RCP and CPUSA) that are going out of their way to support Biden seem to be doing so to make themselves seem untoxic at the higher levels of liberal machines and idk if it'll work!
A very smart person I know wrote this piece. Like me, Biden was not her first choice. She details the importance of realizing we have 2 choices this year and the alternative to Biden is disastrous. Give it a read and let's not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
Is there anything, at all, that would sway a Trump voter to Biden?  Anything a reasonable person might accept-I feel like a Trump voter would chalk up to Fake News, a trap, or irrelevant. Murder on 5th Ave wouldn‚Äôt swing votes at this point.
Ronald Reagan had early onset dementia in his second term. He had to be managed with note cards and Nancy. Joe Biden is nothing like this. It‚Äôs just an empty attack from the a Trump campaign that risks a lot considering Trump‚Äôs own massive gaffes and narcissism.
He is ‚Äúclearly‚Äù in decline because that is the message a badly run echo chamber tells you to believe. Trump can‚Äôt pronounce Yosemite or hold a glass with one hand, but Biden is the problem. Classic projection.

If trump attacks joe on a simple stutter, let joe call him out! At the end of the day, biden still has intellectual savvy and the ability to get trump on the actual issues. Debate away.
Yes!  Sorry -- didn't think of that.  Yes, Biden!  I'll find it in a publicly-accessible source and post again!

A cognition test is not an aptitude or IQ test. Unless Biden was spouting gibberish or divorced from reality, there would be no call for a cognition test.
In a fight between Trumps hyperpolarization and Americans long standing bi-partisan love of NASA, which ultimately wins?  Im not sure, but I will always fight for a space program that lifts up the entire country, not just the Presidents supporters.  #Nasa #Biden #Space
Support for #Nasa and space exploration has largely been unifying and bi-partisan. Turning it into a hyper-partisan political football is as insulting as it is harmful.  Space exploration is a way to lift the country up, not tear it apart.  #Biden #SpaceX #Trump #Space
Like the trauma of knowing the VA is led by a Trumpanzee republiKKKlan moron? I‚Äôm with JOE BIDEN. Clean house, Joe.
On Aug. 4, 2016, Clinton led Trump by nearly 7 points... now has Biden up by 7.4 points. With apologies to Yogi Berra, if Biden isn‚Äôt careful, America could wake up in November with that d√©j√† vu feeling all over again.

It's Trump's job to responsibly run the country and he failed on all accounts. Biden has no reason to debate Trump. Trump's record of failure speaks for itself.
There is TREMENDOUS Lawlessness in the Trump Family business/Administration.  So easy to stop. It‚Äôs clear we need to elect Biden. Your vindictive philosophy will never work &amp; is destroying America. A second term means authoritarianism would be the norm!
Awesome.  The more you talk, the more you keep digging your own grave.  You are the Biden Campaign's best asset.
She's my favorite for one big reason; her diplomatic experience. Trump has f-d up so much domestically &amp; internationally that I like the idea of Dr. Rice being able to travel &amp; mend some fences while Biden repairs the domestic damage. A good tag team so to speak

Opinion: Biden‚Äôs VP should be prepared for an onslaught of online misogyny unlike anything seen before
why hasn't biden said he doesn't like hillary yet, the election would already be over
yes, because even in his addled state, Biden has SOME idea how government works. He knows who to put on his cabinet. He wont pick white nationalists who work for blogs to run work on his staff at the white house!
I didn't always agree with him before, but he's correct here. As far being in the Biden administration...ehhhh, let's hold on those projections, General.
Itz somthin u have 2 FIGYER owwwwt YERSELF!!!
Did you see all of the videos showing that Biden has dementia?
As long as progressives are willing to vote for Biden for POTUS while receiving ZERO concessions from Biden, Biden will continue to appeal the the Never Trump Republicans.    Question for progressives: how does that make you feel voting for the same candidate as Kasich, Max Boot?
yeah, i like biden but looking beyond him i'm not so sure.
Biden, Trump make opposite pitches to suburban voters on housing
Borg queen says fuck Joe Biden.
As bad as Trump's Press Sec have been, this one takes the cake for the vapid award. National disgrace.   Biden has been busy but she didn't bother to check and she has not right to know where Hunter is.
Sara Carter is a lying hack and the Murdochs ought to worry about the people they give a microphone to accuse antifa of all the violence seen when incited by Trump's little green men and as synonymous with DEMS and Biden who is certainly not the socialist FOX wanted.
On Monday morning, November 2, the Biden campaign will hold a press conference; announcing newly discovered documentation that masks do not work, lockdowns are harmful, and therefore promise to open all elements of the economy immediately upon taking office.
lol is biden really going to run the HRC 2016 campaign again???? from all angles??????????

Attacking Bloomberg debate 1 was fine. The 2nd debate was overkill, and she killed her own campaign, instead of attacking Joe or Bernie.   Women Biden could pick: Kamala, Demings, Rice, Duckworth, Whitmer
How come we don't see any crazy Biden houses or vehicles?  Oh that's right we aren't crazy cultists.
When asked if he wants to debate Donald Trump, Joe Biden replied ‚ÄúI like tater tots‚Äù!
YA STILL BE OK PLUS GREETINGS AGAIN SIBLINGS THEY DONT DO THAT THEY JUST DONT WOW THAT HAPPENED SIBLINGS I BETTER BE AT THE BALLGAMES PRESURES ON YOU EVEN WRITE A ROTTON ARTICAL ABOUT JOE BIDEN IN THE NEW YORK TIMES MERRIAM WEBSTER MY ENGLISH TEACHER BECAUSE I OWN THE NY TIMES üòá
What an idiot. Seriously. Don‚Äôt anyone say they are concerned Biden is senile. This guy is high, senile and an imbecile. Thank you for letting me rant. üò≥
I‚Äôm happy to hear your analysis of my tweet and why voting for Biden ‚Äî or quoting Angela Davis ‚Äî is racist. I suspect you‚Äôre just mad because Angela Davis and 92%  of black voters are voting for Biden. They understand the existential threat. Apparently you don‚Äôt.
Corruption is our enemy. I don't care who it is. I feel the same about Biden. All I am saying. Bro, it was good "tweeting" with you, man.
Juan should be staying in the basement with Biden.  Brain damaged people should hang together.   Oh yeah, answer the door Pelosi is joining u.
Funny how I‚Äôm despicable and racist because I think we need to make sure Trump loses to Biden as a matter of strategy, and I had the *nerve* to report that Angela Davis is urging people to vote for Biden, too. 92% of black voters agree. Beginning to think you guys are just sexist
Ty my dear friend üåπ!
RUSH: Can Thomas Friedman name one thing Biden would do that&amp;#039;s different?
I don‚Äôt understand why people think Trump gives a sh*t about them. He doesn‚Äôt care if you DIE! Bring on President Biden!!
Have any of these people endorsed Biden?
I understand your point. But we disagree on this: most 1% are job creators. The middle class is effected positively by the cuts. The stats show job growth within those companies, particularly for the black and hispanic population. More jobs for us in 3 years than Obama/Biden in 8
Really, well we agree on that. What's the issue then? Blue states (and Biden) are on that socialism train. I see how people don't like Trump's personality, but the platform (Republican) right now is making jobs. That's what I'm saying.
Groups of Republicans are doing everything they can to rid of this evil disaster of a President. #TrumpFailedAmerica
I‚Äôm Joe Biden, I‚Äôm here to debate with Joe Biden!
Sir you must be a idiot to vote for Biden!!  You Must want high taxes, open borders,  healthcare for all the illegals, Must not want fossil fuel but a green new deal, socialist government
Opinion | The one thing Joe Biden should think about in a running mate. Who has the emotional intelligence and humility to unite a leaderless country.
Opinion | The one thing Joe Biden should think about in a running mate: Whether she can be president. I completely agree.
Can ‚ÄòBeijing Biden‚Äô balance being tough on China while seeking common ground?
Maybe Biden will finally liberate the FBI to investigate the multitude of crimes committed by a corrupt family business whose patriarch happens to be an impeached  president, along with participants in Epstein‚Äôs child sex trafficking ring.  Both would be great, don‚Äôt you think?

Do you know how much Biden is leading by in WI?
What‚Äôs he got to go on? He can‚Äôt remember facts or statistics, he doesn‚Äôt know how to read; all he can do is call Biden names and try to belittle him personally and keep bringing up his son and Ukraine. Biden‚Äôs a facts and figures man, he‚Äôll run rings around Trump.
Trump? You mean Biden? Or did you mean Pelosi. Kinda looks like Michelle Obama actually
There's more evidence Biden is racist. How about that crime bill that sent record numbers of black and hispanics to jail, how about his "You ain't black", How about he can't think or speak without help, how about a career of lies and plagiarizing...I guess that's good.
Biden will lose because his supporters are fucking assholes like this guy:
You‚Äôre funny, Chuck. 45 doesn‚Äôt like to hear both sides, his mind is made up, he‚Äôs an idiot, and you Republicans do nothing. When people say Biden is too old, they should first look at you.

I wonder what would've happened if it was a Biden sticker.
Debate questions.  Mr Trump explain the major integrated steps to move ahead with China trade talks.Trump gave long labororious answers.  Mr Biden what is your favorite color.  MSM after. Biden was decisive and quick to the point.
Check this out! Biden's plan to invest $775 billion in caregiving shows US politicians are finally taking unpaid labor ‚Äî most of which is done by women ‚Äî seriously
When did Biden say that? You making shit up again
Lol. Yeah they didn't do anything..lol. There's a thing called google. Put in Biden Ukraine. Wow.. you get info. Not on fox either. Keep it up stupid Joey.
Joe Biden is feeble minded. He is incapable of mustering enough brain cells to respond to debate questions

They are both in their 70‚Äôs, and Biden is in better health.
NO. DUDE, YOU WANT BIDEN TO LOSE?
If Trump is re-elected they will make sure the trial is in the middle of the summer.  If Biden is elected they will have the trial in January.
I maxed out on contributions to Bernie Sanders and organized for him. I've been advocating for single payer since the 90s, professionally and personally. Please don't act like there's no difference between Biden and Trump. It makes you look stupid.
The Biden team doesn‚Äôt need to create campaign content. Just put this except on a loop. üòÇ
The one where your family is in jail and Joe Biden is in the WH.
Pete won't get in the Biden cabinet but he may run for the Senate or a State office. He has a future. Bernie Sanders does not. I';s over for him, and for his cult of personality.
Smile more? Some critics see sexism in debate over Biden VP
Biden should debate when Trump releases his taxes.
Do u know who constantly makes up more shit than I find in my toilet each day? Stupid Joey. Do u know what Biden did with the Ukraine? He forgets things, so Biden probably has forgotten too.
Who's in charge of your social media? Do they not know who Biden and Trump are? Having pictures of Johnson and Grassley is ridiculous‚ÄúI did hear the campaign was creating programming for all of the former candidates and there was a slight favoritism slanted towards Pete because he endorsed at a very important time for the campaign," a source w/ ties to Biden camp said üëáüèΩ
I'm hearing Biden's VP pick is the 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle. Hell of a car.
Biden is attacking Biden
Why does one need to publicly love Jesus? Biden regularly attends Mass near his home. When was the last time Trump voluntarily went to church, except for a photo op. Even he didn‚Äôt go inside, or even bring his own Bible. (BTW, ‚Äòpastor‚Äô, what about poor Falwell, Jr. Too bad!)
And Democrat elites would rather have you die than them have to give up their rights and plans in power. All politicians are shitty but if you think Biden is gonna give two shits about anybody, even more so the people behind him. Yeah you are so naive and have to be quite young
I think this could have worked last election, but I think we‚Äôre smarter this time around. His base will believe all the Biden lies, the rest of us have one end in mind...

You know that Trump quickly corrected himself, right? He knew he said it wrong. People trip over words. It happens.   Joe Biden on the other hand said that 150 million people in America have been killed by gun violence since 2010. Biden never corrected himself.
Would be cool if Russia supplied arms to trump voters and China provided arms to biden voters and we had a full fledged proxy war

Exactly. As I've said previously, there's no upside to Rice. There's so many negatives. There's so much that has to be addressed defensively which takes away from Team Biden being on message

To quote  "Fire every single one of these people" in Congress, especially Pelosi and Schumer.  ...but to not-quote Krystal, "fire [them] into the troposphere"  srsly, they're really trying to kneecap Biden even more by letting Trump run to the Dems' left aren't they

Here is the big difference from this intelligence report:  1. Dems believe it and Joe Biden will NOT encourage/accept support from China and Iran.  2. Republicans will deny Russia is trying to help Donald Trump, but Trump will gladly accept the Kremlin's help.  This is 2020.

Joe Biden Launches National Advertisement Aimed Toward Black Voters
O. Mr Fat Boy Trump . Why about that one point seventy fivr trillion you stuck in the bill to Renovate the FBI building close to your Hotel? If Biden win that building will be Demolished and a Hotel will built in place ..
The difference between  and the current fake President is unmeasurable. Biden will have a big job to restore the country from the  chaos that has taken over but anyone with sense, has confidence in him and that he will surround himself with the right people. #Biden2020
BIDEN GOES TO CHURCH;trump never does. BIDEN IS CATHOLIC &amp; practices;TRUMP doesnt even know biblical passages.TRUMP only says &amp; does what he does to CON-BRAINWASH VACUOUS evangelical CHURCHGOERS! Trump is actually the devil,like OMEN‚Äôs Damien.Anybody checked trump‚Äôs head for 666?
lol Biden picks Tim Kaine.
I would have stopped and then started talking about Biden. Lmao
Trump voters gave us Trump and after that I credit Clinton &amp; her inept campaign(who promoted both Trump &amp; Cruz thinking they‚Äôd be easy to beat with tragic results). This year those same assholes consolidated behind Biden and his billionaires who also don‚Äôt care if we live or die.
Here we go again  China virus? And you called out Biden for insulting people of color? DO YOUR  DAMN JOB or  GTFO
Biden would be, if he is elected, only the second Catholic to become U.S. President.
I though only Biden had Alzheimer‚Äôsin this thread.

It was a word Rush used in his program yesterday. 'And then you come back with the Biden answer today about Hispanics are wildly diverse &amp; African-Americans are monolithic, there‚Äôs nothing interesting about African-Americans, they‚Äôre all the same, and we treat them all the same'.
So, it‚Äôs Russia writing the notes Biden reads off of in his basement?  ‚ÄúAre you a junkie‚Äù ha those crazy Russians.
I don't want my president to have any religion. Biden is a soulless corporate tool. I'm not surprised he "faith".
A friend who follows elections/politics very closely tells me he is just learning, via Trump insults, that Biden is Catholic. I imagine there are more than a few voters who are also learning this, and some of them will be more favorably inclined to vote for Biden b/c of it
Kira Davis: Maybe It's Time to Admit Joe Biden Doesn't Think Very Highly of Black People
Same obstruction they pulled with Obama and which Biden saw first-hand. Biden will need discipline to not get drawn in
Well, at least China won‚Äôt be contributing to the anti-Biden propaganda. That‚Äôs something. I hope.
‚ÄúChina, if you‚Äôre listening, release the Trump scandal data.‚Äù - Joe Biden
"It's hard to believe that the Biden campaign would allow this convention to be whitewashed, but it looks like that's what might happen.‚Äù - a  member opens up on frustration üëáüèΩ
When will Biden apologize for his racist comments yesterday?
Joe Biden didn‚Äôt clarify anything. Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign tried to make up for it.
i wanna know what it would feel like to be a biden stan
that's because you only run with corporate appeasing centrists.  no black or latino people i know are voting for biden.  i run with the left. üåπ‚úäüèæ
I agree w/ that but since I‚Äôm voting in NY Im still undecided bc it ultimately doesn‚Äôt matter how I vote. I understand that national figures have to advocate broadly to vote for Biden. I don‚Äôt tell anyone NOT to &amp; want him to win, but not sure i will &amp; that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm  now.
what happens if the DNC changes their presidential ticket after mail-in voting starts?  do votes cast for Biden/X count for Biden/Y, X/Y or Y/Z?  #TheFive
In other words, 2 of 3 enemies want Trump to lose.  That's the only reason this info was released.  And if Biden wins, they'll say it's because of China and Iran.
I hereby spare anyone the dilemma of deciding to vote for Biden.  PLEASE STAY HOME in good conscious. Dont burden yourself with the decision! We understand. We have plenty of new first time voters to replace your vote.
Here we go. The Bezos Post preparing to defend whatever Black-female corporate lapdog Biden chooses.   Get ready y'all. We are all about to get accused of racism because we don't like Kopmala.
Pretty bold to set the precedent that a president can just spend money at will when Biden looks likely to win in November
Instagram Displayed Negative Related Hashtags For Biden, But Hid Them For Trump
Don't take words and assume what trump meant cause it fits your narrative. Biden has said the words and on video without anyone having to assume anything! Lol yet continue to troll trump everyday cause that's pretty much what you do lmfaooo
Exactly! He knows if he did it now it would be political suicide...and if Biden gets it‚Äôll be even worse.

You are all welcome  to stay home if you cant bring yourself to vote for Biden. I will spare you the dilemma of your decision.   We have plenty of new voters, new citizens that can replace your vote
If we‚Äôre going to have to deal with Biden we may as well be entertained with Right Wingers melting into a puddle over a Rice nomination (though I don‚Äôt see it).

Biden didn't win because the "Dem establishment" crushed Sanders or Warren or anybody. He won because a large plurality of Dems actually preferred him. It's amazing how people refuse to believe that others believe differently from them. Most dems didn't want Sanders or Warren.

Joe Biden: Latinos are Diverse, Unlike the African Americans

You realize this article is outdated since Biden won enough pledged delegates to become the nominee on the first ballot? The entire premise of this article is irrelevant

Corporate democrats must love the fact that Trump is president. If it were a regular republican in office, Biden wouldn‚Äôt even offer a real difference. The fact they have a boogeyman empowers them to not even pretend to care. Joe out posting senile videos about his car.

Biden has said and done many things that are racist and uphold white supremacy. It's not once in a while. And y'all gotta stop comparing him to 45 as a way to diminish the impact of what he says.
I would like to apologize for the really lousy take I had in this thread. I'm leaving it up so folks can see it but I want to be clear that my option to support Biden no matter who the VP choice is, is a result of my race and gender and that is a terrible take. I'll do better.
That's not exactly correct. The vast majority eligible primary voters, including black voters didn't get a chance to vote when there was an actual competitive race.   But in terms of making amends, Biden at the debates didn't seem that motivated to de-criminalize weed.
No, it isn't. None of those people speak for the Chinese Communist Party. In any case, China has been economically weakened by Trump (and other nations) bringing jobs and industry home. China's leaders want a return to the pre-Trump status quo, which Biden represents.

But you still MIGHT vote for 160K dead, kids in camps, Putin lovin' Donald if Biden offends you with the wrong VP?
Amazingly,. Where is Biden?ü§î
The man says that Biden wants to take away the Bible and hurt God! WTF is he talking about.
I mean, I don‚Äôt know about all women but I‚Äôd def be more open to letting a Biden voter see my vag before a Trump voter (never!)  ü§£ü§£ü§£. Does that help? ü•¥
Vote Biden to bring back respect &amp; unity to our country!
When The worlds state sponsor of terror wants Biden to win.....
This is the absolute reason why Biden is beating him, not just because he is incompetent but vitriolic and childlike. A man who lacks leadership skill. Look at Trump and COVID 19 and Obama and Ebola, that should tell you everything
I don't care if you fall in line. Just vote for Biden if you live in a swing state. If you live in NY or CA, do whatever you want
Urban X Podcast 120: Joe Biden says Blacks lack diversity, Jay-Z starts new college program, Common
You know, I‚Äôm against foreign interference but thank GOD China is rooting for Biden. Russia is weak and amateurish and stands little chance against China. Silver lining I guess. The ends may justify the means here.
So basically since our federal government now allows foreign influence in the election, the election isn‚Äôt Biden vs Trump but China vs Russia.
Kanye needs to get mental help just like Biden does!!
'Hurt God'??? It never occurred to me that was possible. If Biden has that kind of power we'd better elect him lest he kill God out of spite.
I read your reply, I didn't see 'Biden' or 'Trump' anywhere in your answer. Please refer to the Youtube video I sent you, you may be able to answer the question successfully after watching that video.
Also, the EU would prefer Biden. Also, Canada. Also everyone except Russia and Saudi Arabia.
‚ÄúBecause the Biden campaign is about to pick a woman. And her selection, thanks to this wretched process, is likely to be met with deflation, exhaustion, and resentment, rather than with thrill.‚Äù Hmmm
I draw my line in the sand. If Biden does not pick a Black woman VP I‚Äôm not voting for him. That‚Äôs not too much to ask.
What‚Äôs the emoji for you doing something about Kanye trying to sabotage Joe Biden?
This VP pick nonsense is quite astounding. Remember Tim Kaine? Sarah Palin? Joe Biden???

But isn't this going to come down to what Biden wants? Not what a betting site has calculated is the way to make the most money? All this tell us is that if Harris is picked, the site can cover its losses, right? It's a reflection of largely ignorant sentiment, right?
Believe me bro Twitter doesn‚Äôt mean shit.Personally I don‚Äôt know anyone voting for Biden.I just do it to piss people off.All the fake news networks base their reporting on twitter.That should tell you something.Keep fighting the good fight.
On the biggest conservative sites, engagement (likes, comments, shares) on all stories about Biden peaked in May and fell 31% by July. AXIOS
When are you going to start helping Biden's campaign as you promised?
I am terrified of Biden being president but you‚Äôre just so annoying! All you do is whine. A lot of us would tolerate you if you‚Äôd just shut up and do your job.
Listening to stuttering charlie Gasparino is like having a conversation with joe Biden.. its torture listening to this moron.  Wondering who he is related to at Fox business news

Biden wears a mask in the car to show that he‚Äôs doing the right thing -  but in reality it‚Äôs really an excuse for Biden Hiden.
Is there an ideal VP candidate that we would like Biden to pick? I think we have to accept that he's going with his own kind of neoliberal, not someone progressive. Remember Tim Kaine?
I read the tweet wrong, Russia is the one trying to "denigrate" Biden. So China must be on Biden's side?
ODNI:  Russia doesn‚Äôt want Biden to win  China doesn‚Äôt want Trump to win   Russia = Trump China  = Biden  China potential trading partner under proper leader  Russia is an enemy of the United States  Vote Joe for safer healthier America #wtpBlue  #wtp2020 #WorldMaskWeek
Now would be a good time for Biden to condemn in harshest terms any attempt by the Chinese to interfere in the upcoming election.
Finally, Joe Biden has never proposed forcing nuns to approve of or support abortion or birth control. They were granted an exemption on medical coverage for this purpose. The nuns sued because they didn‚Äôt want to ask for it. That was the only issue.

Good. Democrats should work with China &amp; Iran.  Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working against Biden
Biden doesn't need to say anything, Trump will continue to destroy his own campaign, cultist.
You tulsi need to take biden out back like old yeller... politically
Historically, the candidate with the most "mojo" has always won.  We call this the mojo factor. Trump had mojo in 2016 but is losing it. Biden is oozing mojo, driving cars and making basement gaffes. Still, November is a long way away.

Joe Biden is a devout catholic and regularly attends Sunday service.   The last time Trump went to church, he gassed peaceful Americans.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence confirms Russia is using a range of measures to "primarily denigrate" former Vice President Joe Biden.
The only thing Christian about Biden is that he apparently has read his Bible &amp; doesn't intend to move the US embassy from Israel's capital. We are all imperfect in the eyes of God, but some of us push policies that contradict Christian doctrine for careers.

They all broke it. Trump didn't happen in a vacuum. Obama's biggest mistake was letting the Bush monsters go. Fuck all that happy talk. Love you. But nope.   Biden will get us out of the ditch and the next democratic House/Senate will finally serve consequence on the monster.
Sounds like us intelligence is working for Biden and this is one of a range  of measures used to denigrate trump
This election is not between two American candidates.  It's about Russia vs. China.  Russia is working to undermine Biden's campaign while China is working to undermine Trump's. Who will win? #Election2020 #Democrats #GOP #liberal #Conservative #Biden2020

Not long ago, Warren also raised crapload of $ for Biden via small donors when she made appeal to her supporters. Plus, as noted by Paul, energy is with progressives and Warren checks that box in big way.
You really want Joe Biden to win without doing anything? Hahahaha
I've been gambling tiny amounts of money on who Biden will choose as his VP. I sold my shares of Tammy Duckworth and bought Gretchen Whitmer shares at 20 to 1 ods. We'll see!

I would hope Democrats would NOT want Biden to be president if we found a Russian influence organization was working to get him elected! WTF???
You still haven't a valid answer for the question (again it's simple, Biden or Trump), so it is clear you need to work on your reading comprehension.   But perhaps you are making the point clear by not answering?   4th times the charm hopefully - who will the KKK vote for in Nov?
So you said  will get republicans like you to vote for biden, but you won‚Äôt if  is the vp? That is very weak.
Follow along, dum dum. He didn‚Äôt CHANGE. He NEVER WAS for Trump.  Listen, you can hate me all you want. But for your OWN sake-do not embrace this guy. He stands for nothing. He doesn‚Äôt care about Democrats or Biden, either. He‚Äôs only chasing opportunity. He‚Äôll turn on u all, too.
Well, they can do all the bad mouthing they want but he has a solid vote from me. At this point, I'd vote for any of the candidates that were in the line up where Biden has ended up. Trump, a second term? Let them sling all the üí© they can, I'm not listening.

SEN RON JOHNSON NEEDS TO RESIGN!  He has betrayed his oath of office and our country by knowingly working with Russia intelligence in a US Senate sanctioned hearing on Biden.
I will vote for Biden against Trump if he chooses a Mickey Mouse lunchbucket for his running mate. The highest imperative is to remove Trump and his gangsters from power before they destroy our country. I have a hunch Biden will do better than a lunchbucket.

There are few in the history of US-PRC relations who were in a better position to counter Communist China--our greatest adversary--during its rise, than Joe Biden. Yet at every turn, for almost 50 years, he supported the regime and cheered it on

From a theological perspective is it actually possible to hurt God? I know Jewish God can get real mad and hurt people hurt people but God isn‚Äôt a person so anyway you idiots vote for Joe Biden or we‚Äôre all gonna die.

Biden on my last nerve now with this damn decision
That‚Äôs literally all Biden has going for him at this point. That and he‚Äôs not Trump, I guess.
That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. Imma bite the bullet and vote for that man, Joe Biden I guess. I just don‚Äôt feel motivated
You call yourself a commie yet you support Biden because minorities üòÇ.  Libs are funny.
I joined a Discord with other Leftists.  From now until the Election is about doing protests. Since Progressives don't have a Presidential candidate and won't be doing any activism Biden other than voting for him on Election Day (and many won't do that!), we take to the streets.
Biden doesn‚Äôt need help to be denigrated. He does an excellent job every time he opens his mouth.

Since Joe Biden asked America to judge his mental fitness, I thought post this gem:
#KanyeWest has the right to do whatever he wants. But 2 things: 1. If #Biden runs on the issues that he believes will benefit people, then he needn‚Äôt worry about West. 2. If trump has to use a mentally ill person to try to win, then he‚Äôs already LOST!
This is terrible. Foreign govts have no place in our partisan politics. I promise you Biden doesn‚Äôt want China‚Äôs help.
Many of us think the fact it is so close, the fact we have to worry everytime Biden‚Äôs speaks, the fact people want biden to avoid debates, the fact the party is more concerned with bringing in moderate republicans (white people), makes us believe most of them already need to go.
The only way I‚Äôd vote for Biden is if his VP pick is a true progressive or the closest thing to Bernies camp (which I doubt will happen) and even under those circumstances I‚Äôll still be hesitant.
Yous should let joe biden tweet himself it would be the greatest thing on twitter for sure...
While he would need to poll at 15% to get into debates, you can count on Trump saying he should be included and Biden is keeping him off the stage. It‚Äôll be just another in the constant series of sideshows.
Re-reading the story now makes me realize that.....it says absolutely nothing. Even the quote you mention is from an earlier interview on July 8 (and appears to be in response to a question about whether he was OK siphoning black votes from Biden, not intentionally hurting Biden)
We‚Äôre Ridin‚Äô with Biden! #goJoe2020
LOL... US Intelligence says Joe Biden is taking steps that denigrate Joe Biden...
Equally funny is that the RNC thinks Kanye will take away votes from Biden. Trump was the candidate for people who wanted to troll the establishment in 2016, he was the protest vote. Those are the people who will vote for Kanye; They were never going to vote for Biden.
Or...the Democratic Party has been called out for their abuse of the black vote for decades and Biden can‚Äôt stop insulting them...I love watching the Democratic Party implode!
KANYE IS TAKING BLACK VOTES AWAY FROM BIDEN.  If you want this country to be unemployed, dying from Covid, going hungry - please pull back your husband. Trump is killing 180,000 Americans.  THIS IS SERIOUS.
No. Biden is demented. I actually know Joe. I know he cannot string a cogent sentence together. As for US economy being modeled after Russia then you failed economic theory. Where did you graduate from undergrad again? And what was your major? Any grad school? You seem uneducated
If Susan Rice is VP and Biden wins we will have another 4 years of Obama as "shadow" president. He will be pulling the strings and making policy for Dementia Joe.
Enrichment in Luxembourg...  Just another knife fight in broad daylight, the police are looking for the people involved.   Open borders Joe Biden declared he will Increase refugee admissions by 700%  Save America while we still can, Vote Trump!
‚ÄòDear God, I hope this isn‚Äôt true‚Äô: Rumor mill says Biden has chosen his VP
I called you a moron because you are acting like one don't ask for proof of his dementia then once I list a credible doctor try to pivot to something else. My life is about as awesome as it can be during a pandemic but you don't even live here love how foreigners love Biden üòÇüòÇ

US intelligence warns of election interference, says Russia is trying to denigrate Biden, China wants Trump to lose
The Dem hacks are always screeching at us, "Not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump!!" Yet it seems every time Biden opens his mouth HE'S a vote for Trump! His handlers need to lock him in a crypt until election day, since he's hellbent on self-destruction....
If Latey Gaga‚Äôs album rollouts have taught me anything, do not read into any single signs. Websites are staged on a hidden site before they get pushed live. So Biden/Harris merch could be staged without disruption of what‚Äôs was on there. I‚Äôm just sayin protect your hearts bbs.

Yeah, man! I did notice. If ever there were a cracker, it is Joe Biden.
Hoe Biden is a complete fiend
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
This statement bears no resemblance to reality. Why publish it? Did you miss the Axios interview? Or yesterday's tarmac delirium about Biden being against God?
Also... he happens to be a deeply religious guy from what i know. Its def nobody‚Äôs business, but Biden is def more of a devout christian than trump who just holds up the bible as a propüôÑ
Thank you for loving us and only wanting the best for us. I do, too. I backed Bernie last time and this time in the best way I could as an independent. But I knew he could not love us. The same goes for Elizabeth Warren. They both would've hurt us less than Biden will, though.
Latinos are more diverse and free thinkers that blacks,blacks just follow whites around and vote democrat every year according to Trump I mean Biden my bad
PUTIN has vowed to pour resources to help denigrate Biden in an ongoing campaign against him.
Folks, the 2020 election is a joke. Climate disaster is less than 10 years away. Biden/Trump will not change this. Covid will become Captain Trips in a few months and there is no viable solution yet. Vaccines are not fully tested. They need research at least a year to review.
criticize unfairly; disparage by SIMPLY setting up a #ZOOM $ZM account for BIDEN &amp; letting him talk.                BRILLIANT MASTERFUL PLAN
Her store has been scrubbed for quite awhile.   As for that site there's no proof that Biden's campaign owns it, is there?
China and Biden vs. Russia and Trump.
Biden‚Äôd bring REJUVENATION and HARD WORK!
joe biden can denigrate himself, no need for external intervention
Can you send that to Tim. He blocked me and he claims to be very Christian so I‚Äôm wondering why he supports a pro choice President rather than Noe Biden who goes to church every Sundayü§£
Materially it doesn't make much difference, but just like Jill Stein focused her energies on Hillary in 2016, it doesn't mean it was an admission that she was running to purposely make Trump win. Likewise, for Kanye, it just means that he thinks Biden is worse than Trump.
He clearly likes Trump more than Biden, but that's no new, he's praised Trump for a couple years now. And focusing his ire on Biden and saying it's going to be either him or Trump isn't a confession or surprising.
LOL. Yeah. ‚ÄúBiden is gonna kill God‚Äù is ‚Äúmessage control‚Äù.
So Joe Biden is racist because of China, Russia and Iran?
No surprise. Biden is on the record saying China's rise is good for America! No wonder Obama's own Defense Secretary says Biden's been wrong on every major foreign policy decision in his career. Meanwhile, Trump is taking the fight to China, protecting our IP, data, and industry

If Biden takes five months to select a VP what wd he do if he becomes d President. Good Bye Den.
That ‚Äúa quality they‚Äôre seeking in a prospective vice-president is the absence of desire to be president‚Äù is all the more ridiculous when Biden sent ‚Äúsignal‚Äù last winter (when he was losing) that he‚Äòd be ‚Äúa transition figure‚Äù who‚Äôd only serve one term.
What you just described absolutely qualifies Biden as a racist.

Russia is making Joe Biden appear brain dead and very racist.
Prediction: In exactly 1 wk. (on 8/14), Joe Biden will announce his running mate as Senator Kamala Harris. The left will uproar and call her Kamala the cop. The right will paint her a communist. And none of this rhetoric will matter in the slightest for the major turnout come Nov
Lemme get this straight:  The FBI did this in 2017, after Trump was already in office, but the right wing conspiracy nuts are frothing at the mouth to tie him to Obama and Biden, who were no longer in office?
Worth retweeting my own tweet based on the dumbass crap I‚Äôve seen on Twitter today. GFY and admit you‚Äôre a Dem. Neoliberal = Dem. Bush Alum 4 Biden = Dem. stop pretending.
of harm reduction of another four years of Trump. Without question the Patriot Act infringes on the rights of Americans to this day, but to equate Biden to Trump as a fascist is an extremely dangerous tactic.
There you go again talking out of your mouth from both sides whatever suits you that day is how you speak first Biden was a horrible person now he's the best thing since sliced bread you're nothing but a joke
The argument isn‚Äôt coming from the standpoint of ‚ÄúBiden can do no wrong‚Äù it‚Äôs that a vote for Biden would be a vote against Trump‚Äôs blatant fascistic tendencies‚Äîfederal police black bagging people off the street in Portland, tear gassing peaceful protesters in DC‚Äîin the hopes...

A sobering takeaway from my cold call conversation with Team Biden: I was expecting pushback when I said Biden‚Äôs a corrupt, imperialist war monger who doesn‚Äôt care if every person gets healthcare. Instead I got acknowledgement that I‚Äôm right. But vote anyways? Such a low bar
That's weird, I don't see Holly S. in this clip, I see Joe Biden.

Yeaaa wasent talking about an underage girl there smart one, but Biden on the other hand... are u legally blind? Must be or your iq is 10
Agree... Drove PA to Cumberland MD yesterday ...TONS of Trump/Pence. Then today to Mount Union...same story. Only l saw ZERO Biden.
You and I both know Biden and every other Democrat would bring that up 24/7
That‚Äôs comparing apples to oranges. Emails weren‚Äôt given to  Trump they were released to the public via Wikileaks. So what if China hacks Trump and gets his tax returns and it shows, it doesn‚Äôt, that he‚Äôs in debt to Russia are you saying Biden won‚Äôt EVER discuss it?
Kind of like Wall Street lapping praise one Kamala and Biden. Wells Fargo heads ect
I‚Äôm sick over this as I don‚Äôt vote FOR people I vote AGAINST. I only voted Hillary in 2016 as I KNEW Trump was a piece of shit when I was 17 ! I don‚Äôt care for Biden but it‚Äôs either him or Trump . Fuck both of them overall üò°
What is the Biden/Harris plan for a sound future for the USPS and it‚Äôs 600,000 employees (including about 100,000 military veterans)?
Oh god! I think she‚Äôll be sworn in by 2022. No way Biden survives a full term
He‚Äôs done . I don‚Äôt like ANY politicians . Left wing or right wing it‚Äôs all the same bird . A true hippie/boomer doesn‚Äôt support the system . It‚Äôs not who I vote for it‚Äôs who I vote against . Same in 2016 . Voted for HRC as I did NOT want Trump . Biden should‚Äôve entered then .
If you can convince 10 of your friends to show up for a local race they may actually feel some stake in they will probably throw a vote to Biden anyway without you having to convince them to show up for him.
Tara Reide accused Biden of rape
Read a great article that  was sharing a while back that said if you‚Äôre in the ‚Äúnot pleased about Biden but hope he wins‚Äù crowd you should get people fired up about local races.
Facts are straight. She said ‚Äúbelieve all women‚Äù, Biden was accused of rape.
Yeah absolutely no way anybody watches the debates and comes out voting Biden. As someone in the middle who voted Jill Stein in 2016, I realized everything I heard about Trump was a straight up lie. I guarantee I'm not the only one who woke up to the bs since the last election
I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs why Biden is piling over him

You Liberals are stupid! Seeing how you all have no problem with what Clinton did paying Uk/Russian spies for Trump dossier I was asking if it‚Äôs ok for Trump to do the same with Ukraine spies for a Biden dossier. Try following along better before you chime in.

Yes there‚Äôs a difference, one campaign was a active participant in election interference and one was non-active. So you‚Äôre telling me that you‚Äôd be ok with Trump paying Ukrainian spies for dirt on Biden?
"When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well! I meant Medicare/Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing, in the gov't. I not only tried it once. I tried it twice. I tried a 3rd time &amp; a 4th time." Joe Biden

Something ‚Äòstrange and disturbing‚Äô came from Biden, Kamala Harris appearance   | Sky News Australia
Oh, I will crawl through broken glass to vote for Biden/Harris
I think Biden‚Äôs has a lot more potential voters that don‚Äôt work and lack transportation to vote.
The Republicans have tried for forty years to destroy the central government. With Trump, they have succeeded. Now we're a planetary embarrassment and a nearly complete failure as a nation. I just sent $100 to Biden/Harris. Hope it works.
I can't help but feel like there is a slight power struggle between the Obamas, and the Clintons. In that scenario, it's obvious Biden is more in the Obama camp
If you vote for Trump now, you will cement a dictatorship. At least with Biden you can try again in four years.
Not a surprise at who's leading in the state, but this pegs Biden at about the same as Obama and Clinton got there the last 3 elections, with 12% still up for grabs. It's likely he will end up getting the largest share of the vote in CA since FDR got 67% in 1936.
Fuck that worthless Biden.
I‚Äôm on your side Adam,and I just know that both Biden and Kamala will be ready for this fall Presidental race this fall. I like Kamala,she‚Äôs all heart!!
He couldn‚Äôt even win her own State in a primary so she dropped out did you forget her primary numbers give me a break she‚Äôs locked up more Black people than Joe Biden from her policies
Do you want me to send you a picture of my Biden sign when it gets delivered? It might be a couple weeks because the current asshole in the white house is fucking with the USPS but it'll get here
I may not be big on politics,I think that it‚Äôs a great thing that Biden has chosen Kamala!! I totally agree with you Adam! You said it right! Priorities are a must l!! Kamala is perfect for  Biden. Trump doesn‚Äôt have a chance!?
In picking Harris, Biden makes history and plays it safe
Infuriating that you would really,truly peddle this nonsensical bullshit knowing goddamned well this is your dictator trumps mess...This is exactly what he has done and why we're still in this predicament. Last I checked Biden doesn't have authority to do anything.... YET

Trump can't go down a ramp, can't make coherent sentences, can't close his umbrella, can't hold his glass with one hand, can't go upstairs without assistance sometimes, etc. Considering he's also basically the same age as Biden, you're wrong. Also none of us nominated Hilary sooo
wait if they're well informed, doesn't that mean they know why they're voting for Biden? instead of being a braindead Trump supporter?
Another swing and a miss for the Biden campaign as everyone was asking for Cardi B to sign WAP
No, but you'd need to be a racist to even point that out, because it's obvious. And I'm a creep? How? There's literally dozens of videos of Biden making women and little girls uncomfortable, maybe I'm just a creep because unlike you I have enough of a conscience for honesty.
Denying that would be the delusional thing. Or maybe you haven't heard that speech Biden gave where he did a freudian slip about how black kids were just as smart as white kids? Or the one where he talks about how he likes kids on his lap to pull on his hairy legs?
Let me be clear: Biden and Harris were not my first choices.  But Harris IS a more progressive, voting 93% the same as Sanders.  Arguing against the current picks does nothing to further a progressive cause.  Save that energy to campaign for new Congresspeople.
Rich I hope you guys get your way at this point I don‚Äôt give a fuck!!! I just hope who Ever are president is he does a good job for America. Biden or Trump. So put that in your pipe and smoke it.

This piece is tone deaf. She is a first term congresswoman who actively campaigned against, and still overtly disdains the nominee overwhelmingly chosen by democratic voters. She has said her and Biden shouldn't be in the same party. I am pissed she even has a 60 second spot.
i dont care about mail sorting machines and removing mail boxes. to be honest, i dont care about biden or trump, they're both idiots. im just saying, stop acting like the USPS is some sort of pinnacle of efficiency lmao

I mean, Trump has come very close to inciting violence upon members of the press. Biden has declined to answer shouted questions. It is evil to conflate the two, and Frank should show some shame.
Trump didn't say money per month, the Dems did though. If they are holding it up it's because they want more money for the people.
Are you serious? We‚Äôve had a fake republic for decades. These people don‚Äôt work for us,  they work all work for themselves. Biden‚Äôs been wrong on every important foreign policy decision or opinion for decades. He‚Äôs a corrupt buffoon.

This a worthwhile read. Spoiler alert, the article is not meant to dissuade anyone from voting for the Biden Harris ticket. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Biden and Kamala were by far the two least popular among the voters during the primaries. But most popular among big money. And that doesn‚Äôt make a single lib question how they got these two? Good grief
He's worried he'll loose to Biden
I'm assuming your saying the same thing about biden according to Sen Harris right?
I will say. Literally every candidate has flaws. Biden nor Harris were my first choices but I'll be damned if I let that be what keeps Trump in office. Right now it's anyone but Trump. In 2024, then we can really try to nail down candidates (and hopefully not have just 2 parties)
Anything to get Biden/Harris in office!
The WH reporters should be asking the harder questions of trump and holding him accountable that is thier job. Biden is irrelevant for that setting. They are another check in the system. I feel they are hard enough but chanel and crew are the weakest!
What?! You know the reason you don‚Äôt see many Biden signs? Because Trumpers are crazy. I know plenty of people that have them, but they‚Äôre waiting until closer to election time to put them out because they don‚Äôt want them stolen or worse.
No you have to be... don‚Äôt you understand that if you disapprove of Biden or think he is a creepy and failed centrist who has done far more harm than good in his political career, you then must love Trump?!

The idea is that Biden is entitled to votes, and anyone who votes 3rd party instead is somehow denying him something that's rightfully his and therefore helping Trump. I don't think 3rd party voting makes strategic sense, but the "helping Trump" argument is obviously false.

This is pathetic... As a high schooler, she was a total crush for me but as an adult, I'm surprised she doesn't have Russian propaganda tattooed on her ass!   Let's not even begin with the obvious issues of Biden choosing a previous, outspoken enemy as his running mate ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
biden chose by far the worst possible running mateüíÄ
It‚Äôs the worst bc then they argue with me and start listing problems with Biden and I‚Äôm like hol up fuck that nigga too
üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ. Biden is so much more respected globally than you.  You‚Äôre so funny!  üòÜüòÜ
Joe Biden gives praises to a grand master KKK member Senator Byrd. Does anyone believe this nonsense? Did Biden write the tweet?
These Biden Bros are beyond toxic
Trump and fox got nothing on Biden/Hartis ticket they are coherent and have plans they told truth to facts not made up bully names like trump not working  he won‚Äôt find our Postsl Service got a puppet in to run it ! DeJoy shouldresign
This is fucking hilarious lol. Everything on here is something either Harris or Biden has literally already done. Deranged
What ?? And Biden‚Äôs got dementia? I think you fo
Master Distractor- we don't care. BIDEN/ KAMALA make for better TV grandpa! Go to bed.
I do with üòÅBiden/Harris
Biden doesn‚Äôt know up from down
"Trump campaign branded Biden running mate an ally of 'radical left,' but her background tells different story" No, Harris is a centrist.  By Canadian standards, Kamala Harris could run for the Conservatives: Don Pittis | CBC News
AOC should get up there and say that Biden agrees w everything she believes in and that she can‚Äôt wait to help him make Venezuela style socialism here.
My dream scenario is; vote in Biden to get ride of trump, Biden gets in, passes the bucket shortly after and activism carries on strongly the next four years yielding to changes that will set this country towards to actual freedom and liberty.
Next week  is speaking at the  Read his message about why  was the right person to join  on the ticket.
Trump &amp; Pence want to further tax breaks to the rich. Biden &amp; Harris want to raise taxes on the rich. Trump &amp; Pence want to get rid of Social Security. Biden &amp; Harris want to preserve Social Security and want to ensure healthcare is not a privilege!  Who are "for the people"?
Pence and Trump lost a least 3x more jobs in 2 months than Joe Biden and Barack Obama lost in their 8 years in office.
WTF? Trump really is off the rails. #TrumpIsNotWell
Trump, Obama, Clinton React to Biden's Kamala Harris VP Pick
Ironically Kamala‚Äôs action in California would indicate she‚Äôs more racist than Trump. Biden, for sure, is more racist than Trump
Trump people are actually saying, out loud, that they‚Äôre against voting rights. But yes let‚Äôs protest vote against Biden to give this nonsense 4 more years.
As Biden and Harris say, the US is fighting for the soul and the conscience of the nation in this election.
So I guess you can‚Äôt read. Your so upset. Once again I didn‚Äôt want Biden. But I also have the common sense of knowing that not every politician is squeaky clean. I like Bernie but him voting on that crime bill didn‚Äôt help with our community. Bernie doesn‚Äôt believe in reparations
I was in law school at 22  what were you doing at 22? Comments like this are why Biden was an absolute moron (we already knew this) for picking you as his running mate. üó£
I give up . I can‚Äôt stand anyone who is running for president. The whole thing is a scam. Biden is a puppet of what‚Äôs her name. She wants the power. Trump is an a idiot. I am not voting.
lol- u want to see biden preside?
"Biden and Harris vow to ban Right to Work laws which protect 166 million Americans in 27 states, more than half the U.S. population. Right to Work laws allow workers the freedom of employment without forced membership in a labor union or forced payment to a union boss."
The argument is the exact same as the one made about Biden. If we do not make demands of him before voting for him and instead blindly fall in line, then why would he ever listen to our demands?
Like I said I didn‚Äôt want Biden. So read! So Bernie helping it pass didn‚Äôt put millions of black and brown people in jail?! I‚Äôm so sick of that damn excuse! Bernie is as responsible and Joe. So get off your high horse!
Trump will cheat any way he can. Jared Kushner And Kanye West Are Colluding To Hurt Joe Biden  via
He could shoot the Pope (not that I‚Äôm Catholic) &amp; I‚Äôd still vote for Biden. No matter whst he does, I‚Äôm still voting for Biden! Harris! #BidenHarris2020 #VoteHimOut2020 #VoteHimOut
I didn‚Äôt forget anything. I didn‚Äôt want Biden. But this is what we have. You must‚Äôve forget how Trump went through a housing discrimination lawsuit. Or how he wrote the letter to the Centel Park 5. Or maybe you forget Bernie Sanders also voted on the crime bill.
Joe biden. "Hold my enfamil"
‚ÄúI know how much Beau respected Kamala and her work and that mattered a lot to me, to be honest with you, as I made this decision.‚Äù #JoeBiden referencing his late son while introducing #KamalaHarris as his running mate:
Wow, look at Biden putting in the work himself on something that is much more environmentally friendly. Good dig. Also very hard to ignore someone is compensating for something!
Yes!!! Like my hubs said Joe Biden has tons of folks coming out Virtual for him 3 day convention on Tv ! Who doe trump have Barr and the do nothing Senate
Biden and Harris raised that... the Harris energy to the ticket is key ..I know you know that but just want people to get how key she is to this and I happily donated.
My hubs repeats that all the time ugh lol! All Biden has to do let trump next few weeks shot himself in the foot with Wind Mills and short showers I just read he wants that! Omg crazy something about his hair and people taking showers .I‚Äôm and Karma throwing joe off cliff
So does Kamala Harris still believe Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers?
That‚Äôs whai I am afraid of it‚Äôs going to be vitural right! He will be babbling for sure!I think Joe Biden can handle his craziness!

If the Biden ticket should win in Nov. our country will change as never before. The team of Biden &amp; Harris is the most dangerous combination ever to present itself to America. The Democratic Party has crossed the line of sanity. If allowed we will no longer be the country of past

Biden cannot and would not ever decline to debate.  That is the win for them.  Of course they will claim victory no matter what babble Trump spews out but the nation and the world need to witness it.  Claiming victory isn't victory.

Haven‚Äôt really been paying attention that much today. Got too excited by the Biden-Harris Announcement of Thier Campaign Event.
This is what I tell people when I say that on a 10 year scale, Biden could end up worse than trump
Joe Biden confirmed white supremacist.
They accuse Democrats of getting votes from dead people, but these motherfuckers sent stimulus checks to dead people, and now they got Zombie Herman Cain tweeting against Biden and Harris for Trump.
Biden‚Äôs announcement, which came in a tweet and in an email to his supporters, called her a ‚Äúfearless fighter for the little guy.‚Äù
She is a phony, she's not black. I thought she was the first Indian Senator? But now she the black VP candidate, how does that work. She believes Joe Biden sexually harassed 3 women but now not so much? And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
Exactly.  I have been asked why I support Biden bc of what he has done over 48 years; OMG if I got judged by my choices and mistakes even 10 years ago I would be upset. People change with experience and age!
There was really no way Biden could announce a VP without:  -Old wounds being re-opened for Sanders supporters -Those wounds being exacerbated by every fucking lib yelling YOU DAMN BERNIE BROS BETTER FUCKING FALL IN LINE
Twitter doesn't allow enough space for me to tell u all that worries me. üòÇ. I'm generally optimistic but the Trump administration has tried to rob me of that. The Biden-Harris ticket is bringing it all back tho. Positive thoughts going forward!!!
Thank your daughter for supporting Biden/Harris. You raised a very smart daughter.
After what New Yorkers have lived through this year is there anything else we need to know about the judgement of the person selected to take over for Joe Biden?

Hopefully Nov 3rd, or soon thereafter when all the ballots are tabulated, this shit changes. Biden/Harris 2020!!!
Zebras don‚Äôt change their strips. 6 days ago ¬∑ Democratic presidential Joe Biden has again waded into controversy over how he discusses race and ethnicity. Washington Post
I mean Biden could have picked a stuffed cat as his running mate and he had my vote... let‚Äôs hope we are toasting that night!
Thanks Mark, any way we can get Biden/Harris lawn signs?
Wrong. Biden needed to build a broader coalition and move his platform toward the middle.  Instead he pandered to the far left and didn‚Äôt build shit.  Already has California and already has ‚Äúthe black vote‚Äù so while I love Kamala as a politician, there were better choices.
I think something is getting lost in this because everyone is paying attention to Biden screwing up ho's...i mean her name. He says "thats why I wanted to be last in the room when he made the decision"....what? Who made the decision??
And you know what‚Äôs sad? I think Covid helped. I also think it hurt Biden to pick Kamala over Warren, only because with Warren he can appeal to younger Dems with her and older Dems with himself.
The Joe Biden campaign said it more than doubled its previous one-day fundraising record after announcing Kamala Harris as his running mate.
What Biden refused to acknowledge IN 1975 were the discriminatory education and housing of Jim Crow policies that undergirded their segregated communities. In 1954, the SCOTUS reversed segregation in public schools unconstitutional. BUT JOE BIDEN UPHELD SEGREGATION, duh-?
If you only watch one thing today this  podcast needs to be it.  Brutal takedown of Biden, Harris, Rice, and corporate Democrats.
‚ÄúThe Democratic Party won‚Äôt be strong enough as an institution to build upon ... and the legacy of  MLK‚Äù  ‚ÄúPut pressure Biden and Harris to break away from their centrist ways, friendly with Wall Street....militarism.. they‚Äôre tied to conservative lobbies‚Äù üëèüèªüëèüèªüôåüèª
Liberals criticizing leftists and radicals for not erupting in ecstasy at the thought of a Biden/Harris ticket should take a moment to consider who will be building the barricades when Trump tries to steal the election.
The point is that Bernie attacked Biden for wanting to cut SS, but then endorsed him after dropping out and is now attacking Trump for wanting to cut SS. He let us down to curry favor with the establishment. Like George Carlin said: "it's a big club, and you ain't in it."
Remember When?  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago. I do not buy the concept, We have suppressed the black man for 300 years and we must now give the black man a head start, or even hold the white man back, to even the race.‚Äù  Biden 1975

voting in america be like I don‚Äôt want trump bc he‚Äôs bad and I don‚Äôt want biden bc he‚Äôs bad and if I vote for a third party my vote will be wasted but none of that really matters anyways bc no matter the popular vote the electoral vote determines the president UGH I hate it here
Built by Obama, destroyed by Trump, rebuilt by Biden
Thank God... I'm so glad Biden picked her
Biden and Harris spoke Wednesday at a high school in his Delaware hometown to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Trump in November.
Was it like when she hammered Biden for being a racist? Or like when Tulsi hammered her for being an absolute fraud? Or more like when Willie Brown hammered her?
Joe Biden is a sexual predator and Kamala Harris is a pro-cop pro-prison pig but I just have to keep telling myself that their win means democratic Supreme Court justices and a democratic cabinet, director of EPA, etc... and I have to hope that‚Äôs good enough
Bernie attacked Biden repeatedly during the debates that Biden has a history of saying he wants to cut entitlements.
Yeah No Our Country will be Destroyed by Biden and Harris.
But you're voting Biden?
Yeah that real leader isnt Biden or Harris try again in 4 more year.
Bernies big attack on Joe Biden five months ago was that he would cut social security. now Biden is the nominee, Bernie is in the pocket, and Trump is the one who will cut social security.   Nothing matters. Anyone can say anything and say the opposite the next day. Disturbing
Agreed I have people that live in Democrat Run cities like NYC and Democrats are turning cities into shit holes. The President had offered to send in the National Guard to clean the streets up but they would rather let people get murdered! Idk how people can support Biden!
my post on FB got removed but I DO remember Harris stating that once 'they got Trump removed" then 'we are coming for you who voted him in, no exeption!  and yes, as you can clearly see by the pic of her parents, as Bubble head Biden is fond of saying "C'mon Man!  you ain't black
As someone suggested: Biden stipulates that Trump has to release his taxes in order for the debate to happen. He would never do it.
honestly that would get me to vote for biden
Trump is gonna win no doubt Biden Harris is a weak choice Trump may not be perfect by any means but I truly dont trust either of them with Biden acused of Raping Women and Harris locking black men up unjustly. I dont trust them.
Long as Biden has one I think anyone can
I'm not betting I'm telling you this is gonna be the outcome unless Biden Condems the Violence and Riots going on he will lose when Democrats have abandoned cities such as Minneapolis who do you think they will turn to?
Nope gonna be a Red Wave just like in 1984 for Ronald Reagan. Do you really think people can justify voting for Democrats when they are responsible for cities being destroyed and the killing of innocent people. Unless Biden condemns the Violence he will lose!!
Trump is easily the worst President in American history and has done near incalculable damage to the nation. Biden/Harris will win in an electoral tsunami and restore America to its former greatness. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
I love how the left's response to  tweet is to praise Marge Simpson like she's a real person and not a fictional cartoon character.  That's the perfect metaphor for the Biden campaign.
This election is a fight for the soul of America  #BidenHarris #vote #Trump #biden #VoteBidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisVP #BlackLivesMatter
I love that conservatives are pointing out that Kamala Harris had previously debated Joe Biden as a reason why Joe made the wrong VP choice.  But as we know, the Republican mindset of putting past disagreements aside in order to move forward isn‚Äôt their strong suit.
To get to Bernie and AOC and further left - especially now that this administration has fully embraced fascism - you‚Äôre going to have to suck it up with Biden.   If you‚Äôre under 25, please realize people have been fighting this fight for  75 years and have been losing the last 40
You are right, choosing the AG will be a monumental task and one Joe Biden will consult with Kamala Harris and others. He has a wide range of qualified and capable people from whom to choose for all of his administrative appointments.
And she did it again today...saying when you typed in antifa it took you to the joe biden website. That woman is crazy and I'm shocked she hasnt been offered a job on his staff
Not one person who was on the fence just moved to Biden cuz of Harris nomination. I guarantee they moved closer to Trump if anything. Horrible pick. Sad party. #BidenHarris2020Landslide is #FakeNews #TrumpPence2020
The vast majority of Canadians are happy with the Biden Harris duo.
It wasn‚Äôt just an opinion Biden had, there was a federal law passed called the Defense of Marriage Act which Biden voted for and whipped many Democrats to support, resulting in it passing with a veto-proof majority.
Now do Biden, because he just got through mangling it.
I loved listening to Biden/Harris today.  Strong, intelligent, succinct, &amp; honorable. It‚Äôs an amazing contrast listening to Trumps presser right now;meandering,immature, and Petty.  My idea of hell would be having to listen to Trump talking for eternity.
Lol that‚Äôs someone hijacking a pic!!! Has nothing to do with Biden
Her words were if google antifa it goes to Biden lol!!
take that Biden, you creepy hair sniffing inarticulate perv, soon Heels up Harris will be feeding you your oatmeal while adjusting your bib, and if you're really good, she might just wipe the hair down your legs.
So your girl just lied on TV say google antifa and goes to Biden here is the screen shot !!
When the  #BidenHarris2020Landslide happens can we just forget about nasty trump and name Biden the 45th president of the USA? #MAGA üá∫üá∏
Biden/Hoe crowds are roiting and geting their reparations
the country is divided. it is a divide that trump nor biden can fix. there is one man who can salvage this country. there is one man who can save america.
Right Biden would‚Äôve waived his magic wand and it would‚Äôve went away. He never would‚Äôve shut the borders down like Trump did or make private companies pivot and make PPE and ventilators. How did Cuomo in NY do with nursing homes btw?
You can still have progressive ideals and vote for Joe Biden. At least our voices will have a chance to be heard. Trump will just snuff them out using power and force.
And the point I'm trying to get across is that if they're close to Biden then they're pretty close to conservative
Watching an election with a woman on the ballet is interesting after learning about diversity &amp; oppression.  Biden &amp; Trump comments focus on what they do not do well. Harris comments focus on her gender and assumptions about her sex life. It‚Äôs gonna be a difficult 5 months.
But you had to wait to see who Biden‚Äôs VP pick was before you decided if you were going to vote for him...
I‚Äôm 100% voting Biden/Harris. I was homeless for 7 years and have been on Medicaid and SNAP. I‚Äôm also a gay man seeing my rights under attack. Even a Presidency under ‚ÄúThe Establishment‚Äù means I can still fight for my principles, that won‚Äôt change. Under a dictator I can‚Äôt.
So what was it when Biden mangled it? Was that disrespect too?
Political ideologies are on a scale. People aren't just conservative or liberal. How liberal his choice is matters. Would he be closer to Biden or Bernie?
Watching theüçäone give his daily brief of dumb, it's obvious he watched #BidenHarris2020 earlier this afternoon. He's mentioning Obama or Biden or both in almost every other thing he brings up.
I'm Canadian, and I am over the moon that Kamaka Harris is Joe Biden's choice as VP. What a great first speech by the two people who will lead the US back into the light. We are rooting for you all on Nov 3. We will be popping the corks on Jan 20, 2021.
Our President is talking and the MSM Is not covering it, although Biden was on all channels-what is wrong with that picture.
Exactly! And she could have tried to destroy #CreepyJoeBiden too if the Dems hadn‚Äôt made him forgive her &amp; put her on his ticket. They were thinkin, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll shut her up with any negative Biden talk!‚Äù  They‚Äôre all a bunch of Lying criminals! üëéüèªü§Æ  #Trump2020SavingAmerica! ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üëçüèª
Well, that‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúchoice‚Äù. Catholic actually means ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù in Greek. You would think that a church stemming from that word would be less restrictive on its members, not so much. As they are not so much thd most universal of churches.
Kamala Harris is making history. The daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica is now the presumptive Democratic vice presidential nominee.
Unlike you, Hunter works for a living. He's not involved in an incestuous, nepotistic crime family living off the American taxpayers. Unlike your fraud of a "father," Joe Biden will win legitimately not with the help of Putin or any other tyrannical master. Your daddy's a lapdog.
Biden lies about everything &amp; now he‚Äôs paired himself with a co-liar!
Biden picking Kamala Harris benefits Maya Rudolph more than Biden. #VPPick
But why should we feel Biden would appoint a decent choice for that seat?
Wow! I've had a few minutes to digest what I just watched and listened to with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. This was an absolutely powerful speech, it was heartfelt and as an observer, I feel hope for our neighbours to the south. Team Biden/Harris is a force to be reckoned with.
No Trump is protecting Social Security Biden will not
Now do H1N1:
They learn nothing from 2016 and average Americans seeming celebs who have avoided Epstein talk and pedo Hollywood talk enforce and cry joy for Harris and Biden make us all run the other way. I‚Äôm telling you we DON‚ÄôT like what Hollywood thinks.
I love Jill Biden! That photo of her fighting off the one protestor on Super Tuesday will forever be burned in my brain.
Caught Biden &amp; Harris‚Äôs speeches, and was OUTRAGED not to hear a word about:  ‚Ä¢ showers ‚Ä¢ windmills ‚Ä¢ hydroxychloroquine ‚Ä¢ very long, very steep ramps ‚Ä¢ our beautiful beautiful monuments ‚Ä¢ how NO ONE has been treated more unfairly than them  You know: what REALLY matters.
Harris and Biden is trash !
Didn‚Äôt see whatever the Biden-Harris thing was. But if they didn‚Äôt say they‚Äôll raise your taxes, murder babies, and make your gas $5 / gallon again then they lied.
My favorite line. Kamala Harris: "He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
Every meaningless cliche and dragging dead Biden son out for a nice memory lane stroll is really going to solve problems. These people are such disingenuous pukes!
Warren is gonna be Secretary of the Treasury in a Biden administration and Kennedy will win the special election for her seat
This biden speech is so boring I'm wandering off as much as joe does
Kamala Harris: "He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
Joe Biden helped write the law that led to mass incarceration of blacks and Kamala is a cop. What the hell are they going to do for BLM?
A historic appearance with Biden &amp; Harris, and all local news stations cut away for another 10 minutes of weather babble.  Really?  Local news just doesn‚Äôt get it.
Not sure I‚Äôd call Biden ‚Äúfundamentally decent‚Äù, but it‚Äôs better than the other option.
Kamala compares Ebola to COVID-19.  üòú crazyüòù   Keep this in mind America NEVER had  Ebola on its soil until Obama/Biden had persons sick with Ebola flown here. Soooo America still would NEVER have had Ebola here if they didn‚Äôt bring here.
seriously! You cut away from Biden and Harris??!!
Notice how so called "Fact-Checkers" scrutinize #Trumps EVERY comma and period but #BIDEN &amp; #Kamala can spew all this garbage without a single fact check.
Wow!!!! Kamala Harris is giving me chills!! I absolutely admire her calm demeanor, class and style. She‚Äôs so well spoken and speaks with elegance that‚Äôs incredibly welcoming in a time of crisis. I look forward to living a new life under Biden/ Harris administration. BRAVO!!! Xoxo
What does the dead son of Joe Biden have to do with how they‚Äôre going to get our country to a better place? Jesus Christ no plan all cliches. Sounds awesome #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris
Biden just told a bull-faced lie! Saying that Trump has the worst record in the history of Presidency with jobs &amp; handling the pandemic. Well #SlowJoe, planes weren‚Äôt flying over seas until the 1930s. Technology has made it easier to spread today. üòâ

Hey, we know Biden made a pretty shit choice, but they‚Äôre literally all we have to get rid of Trump. All this is doing is making people not want to vote when we NEED THEM TO VOTE MORE NOW THAN EVER

Joe Biden is a damn liar!!!!!
Kamela/Biden tackling police reform rn would be like when PD‚Äôs investigate themselves and find no wrong doing. They WILL gesture reform and then turn around and throw money at law enforcement. I guarantee it.

I'm honestly scared. These are our 2 picks? They both suck. Biden will forget where he is the second he wins. Can't we get someone else? Who's the third party guy?
I haven't decided if I'm voting Biden/Harris or Howie yet. If I lived in a red or battleground state I'd be voting Biden for sure though.
Joe Biden is NOT a Boomer. Joe Biden is Silent.
Ok but, but, but,  it would be cool to visit a Biden Presidential library that has an Amtrak a la Harry Potter world and free ice cream
President Trump wasted no time attacking Sen. Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate. But in recent years, he was donating to her political campaign.
New Reuter‚Äôs poll has Biden up 16. I hate the media.
PERFECT COMBO:  DUMBER THEN A BAG OF ROCKS BIDEN AND HEELS IN THE AIR HARRIS.
A ‚Äòradical‚Äô leftist who is ‚Äòagainst God‚Äô? Trump paints Biden in a picture many don‚Äôt recognize
The double standard is real. I saw Kh*vers (*cough* Bianca *cough*) they wouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden if he picked Warren, and not a single Warren Dem I follow has said they wouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden, and yet we‚Äôre still getting harassed about it
Are you senile, lying, stupid or just another #FakeChristian spouting vile venomous and evil crap from that ignorant orafice in your face? Joe Biden is a far better Catholic than you ever will be.
Fascinating. I said like the exact same thing when I watched Biden trounce Bernie Tuesday after Tuesday after Tuesday
She will be the best and tenacious women for our government... God Bless Biden &amp; Harris
Trump campaign sources: ‚ÄúKamala Harris was the one candidate they hoped Biden WOULDN‚ÄôT choose.‚Äù  Awwww that‚Äôs a shame. #BidenHarris2020
Big fan, from Buffalo love the Dogs. Just curious how you can get behind Biden, I understand the Trump point of view. I feel Biden is way riskier because of his health, KH was ousted by the Dems, so essentially we are voting for her! Welcome thoughts
#WATCH Joe Biden is making his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris on Wednesday.
Why wouldn‚Äôt Biden? He‚Äôs the top of the ticket? Or is he too brain addled?
Most of us knew that Joe Biden would pick Kamala Harris. That it took them this long to announce it means that he was the last person to know. #VPPick
Bro..honest question. What does pointing out Harris' problematic past RIGHT NOW do? Trump poses an immediate threat to Black &amp; Brown ppl via white supremacy. The ONLY road to him out of the WH is now Biden/Harris. So shouldn't our collective energy be toward that?
Biden and Harris are appearing together today at a high school in Biden‚Äôs Delaware hometown to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Trump.
The   explains that Biden's VP pick does not signal smooth sailing for the future of immigrants and immigration reform.
I‚Äôm disappointed that it‚Äôs Biden/Harris but they‚Äôre still getting my vote bc the alternative is unfathomable. AND we still can and should continue to demand better from the DNC next go round
I promise nobody will hold it against you if you vote for Biden
He‚Äôs doing this to interfere w/coverage of Biden/Harris remarks at 3:50. Good luck with that. Hopefully media is learning its lesson from 2016 and will dump his lying ass the minute the Biden/Harris event starts.
Carl Paladino, who famously informed his wife about his second family and daughter by another woman at his son's funeral, has a lot of opinions about the Biden family.
No way.... Shark week is on....besides, we want Biden/Harris!
To be honest I have no idea right now smh. I ain‚Äôt with the lesser of the two evils shit, biden and rump both evil for real. Idk what‚Äôs going on with Ye so niggas stuck right now. What‚Äôs your take?
Biden/Harris, Crackhead/Alcoholic, EmptyWaterBottle/UsedNapkin - I don‚Äôt give a fuck who it is at this point anything is better than Trump.
Western New York political analysts are reacting to Joe Biden's VP announcement.
Sorry but Biden and Harris will do nothing positive for this Country if you actually do Reserch into what Biden stands for you would change your mind. President Trump may not be perfect but he loves this Country and has worked hard for us all!
Kamala and Biden are destroying him by a historic margin in the suburbs, and suburban women are going to go hard for them once Kamala's prosecution of sex crimes and domestic violence gets more press vs Pence
Biden picking Harris is a piss poor effort to receive the minority and female vote. It‚Äôs on record that they are not fans of each other, but he still locked her as a running mate? Anybody else left wondering what Biden was thinking? Oh waitü§£ü§£

It‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôre pandering to a certain crowd when Biden said months ago that he was gonna pick a woman to be his running mate. Lol no dude just fucking pick the most qualified. It didn‚Äôt work for McCain and it won‚Äôt work for you either.
Do I love Biden? No. Do I love Kamala? No. Would I still wait in a 5 day line to vote those two in and get the tiny dick Cheeto monster and the homophobic weasel out of office? Hell fucking yes I would

Biden is deeply catholic.  How do you not know that?
At the time C. Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court, the Dems didn‚Äôt have the will to Bork him. The Dems conspired to politically assassinate Anita Hill. Biden did what he was told. This is one of many bad moves by the Dems.
I feel like Biden and Harris should switch titles. We all know she's going to be president in less than a year anyway.
Joe Biden is not a socialist. He is very much a capitalist
Y‚Äôall are really gonna convince yourselfs that Biden and Harris are worse than Trump and Pence aren‚Äôt you
Hey dummy. The fact that you call us ‚Äúsuburban housewives,‚Äù like we have no identity outside of our husbands and children says a LOT. Suburban working moms, who have more skin in this game than you realize, will be voting for Biden. #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
That‚Äôs funny when you were calling for a Biden admin to prosecute  after he leaves office. So prosecuting Trump is ok but don‚Äôt look at what Obama admin did?
Hillary's role in the Biden campaign should be to just mess with Trump every. single. day.
Not sure why you compared Biden to the worlds most beloved frog who helps leads a group of crazy Muppets of all different species, shapes, sizes, &amp; colors. Kermit would be a great President! &amp; who wouldn‚Äôt want to watch Jim Henson‚Äôs beloved iconic characters? What‚Äôs your agenda?
They are afraid of the Biden Harris ticket and the inevitability of their hate crusades will have to come to an end. The other issue, Kamala Harris is a woman of colour and they are watching the changing demographics in the USA. Bye-bye to their white dominance and superiority.These asswipe r here can‚Äôt not get away we all these bullshit, let‚Äôs vote them out of office and rebuild a better future for our children, I‚Äôm going to mask on, out some glove and I‚Äôm going to my voting place to vote for Biden / Harris 2020
Joe Biden  in the dugout
If Democrats don't have control of Congress how on earth do you think these socialist agendas are going to pass? For Biden to promise something he can't deliver he would be a bigger liar than Trump.
Biden is better than this guy? well, that's probably his only positive point
Biden was a segregationist in the 70s
Only thing I‚Äôll say about this tweet is you can definitely say Biden is creepy. That‚Äôs established. The rest I‚Äôll agree on to this point.
No, she‚Äôs definitely wrong. New York and California are not voting for the monster. In fact he‚Äôs losing to Biden in every swing state except one where he‚Äôs tied. So it appears that you are the ‚Äúbat-shit-crazy‚Äù ones.
FYI, if Joe Biden becomes president he shouldn't have absolute unilateral power to launch nuclear weapons either.  A lot of shit that is obviously messed up about the presidency right now will still be messed up with a different president, even if it's not as obvious.

So the President has no power. That's what you want? That means Biden would have no power. Or does the word "dismantle" now mean something different to you lunatics just like "defund" means something different in Libloonish?
def!! am just thinking aloud (on twitter?).   am just also afraid of the reactionary candidate that comes after a biden presidency. üòÖ
I understand your trump hate, but Biden ain‚Äôt no different .
Saying that Biden will be better than Trump for people who r suffering is typical white liberal bullshit from someone who knows no one who is suffering. High living in Brooklyn with wealthy parents.
also think there‚Äôs a huge message to be sent to the DNC if young ppl turned out in such record numbers for bernie and then didn‚Äôt for biden
feel like there are def different layers to not liking a candidate! like biden n kamala are frightening. i didn‚Äôt really like bernie bc he is still establishment and pro-israel but i still voted for him. idk if i‚Äôll vote for biden but i think it‚Äôs valid if ppl opt out now

I asked you a question as a Trump supporter about his policies for re-election and you result to asking me a question about Biden. Since you are a Democrat now, I should as you that question.
I will however not play as a fanboy for Biden &amp; Harris. Y‚Äôall both need to convince our base if y‚Äôall want their vote.
So basically just give them a chance? Yea some ppl said the same thing with Trump. Stop silencing ppl for not being ok voting for Biden and Kamala. We‚Äôre not voting for Trump but they‚Äôre not that much better. So no I am not throwing a parade that this woman of color may be the VP
A *possibility* is that they have decided to toss in any chance of an electoral win &amp; plan to saddle the Biden admin. with chaos &amp; obstructionism. Kind of 2009 on steroids. Others among em want a straight up stolen election or civil war-the more panic &amp; demoralization,the better.
YUP, they literally were doing this for ego and appearances.  Biden even said it on the congressional floor that they WERENT doing it because of it being a decent human thing it was to change the narrative of Dems being softüòíüôÑ

Yup, the correct strategy to win the election against Donald Trump is to rabidly attack anyone in a blue state that will vote 75% democrat that doesn‚Äôt worship Biden
This is completely fictional. Biden‚Äôs plan does not guarantee every American healthcare AT ALL. There is literally nothing that supports your claim
- As a loyal viewer of your show and fellow patriot please allow me to say this, instead of talking about Kamala Harris and Joe Biden can you please devote time to the 5 year old who was assassinated while riding his bike. I think this is more important.
U being mislead, absentee voting is much different, it's not the same system and nobody parading for joe biden, doing anything for jim crow joe, keep letting  mislead u. Check out the communications act of 1934.
We have conflicting data
The issue is, will she actually stand her ground, have strong convictions, be able to make her stated progressive policies be things the Biden campaign adopts, so that they can become reality? That's the reassurance progressives are looking for.   And we have not bn getting that
Not according to studies that show tens of millions will not have healthcare because they can‚Äôt afford it under Biden‚Äôs plan
Americans were literally just polled and 70% of them support it, with around 80% of Democrats. Its not a prop, we want people to be able to survive. We want Biden to support a policy that a majority of the American people support and will save countless lives.
So many potential actions are inhibited by Democrats saying we don‚Äôt want to open that Pandora‚Äôs box.  It is possible that Barr will indict Obama, or Biden, or others in his administration. If he Opens the box then it must be no holds barred

Biden/Harris are better for more Americans than Trump/Pence.   As an American, go with the candidates who are more likely to do more good and less harm to the majority of Americans.

He's in CA. The way the electoral college works. There's no way his vote to nominate Bernie affects the general vote for Biden in CA in November.   I'm in a similar situation cause I live in NY. Im gon write in Bernie but in NY that still means Biden will win NY

Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi.  Hear this loud and clear.  Just because the Dems have an outstanding ticket they will have zero chance of being elected.  Once Trump gets done with obstructing the vote the tally will be Trump 99%, Biden 1%.  Just like Saddam used to do.

OK. Let the racism begin: KH is indeed eligible under Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution. Then the 13th Amendment regards citizenship. There's no question Harris is eligible. Do you think that Biden and his trillions of lawyers would put her forth if that weren't the case?
Further: if there are any surviving Biden-Clinton-Obama cracks, the fastest way to knit them shut is by quoting a Russian intel operation.

I was 40 in '94. I can attest to what the climate was like, what white people like me feared, how the rhetoric ran. Biden was kinda mainstream in that. That however, doesn't mean that it was good, wise, or somehow not racist.

He wants to have those press conferences every day and now that Biden has announced his VP it gives Trump something to turn his attention to. He needs to be challenged every damn day and he needs to not get away with his nonsense. Enough is enough.
So explain how Reparations went from virtual obscurity to part of the national debate, precipitating a congressional hearing and forcing the candidates to produce (albeit inadequate) BLK exonomic agendas... INCLUDING Biden.  No PACs.  No lobbyists.  How?

Stare down Biden like an episode of DBZ
I saw how the DNC and the media played thier dirty tricks to give us Biden. I watched every single debate. I watched all the analysis. I saw the framing of questions and the manufacturing of consent. Everyone should be concerned.
Ain't nobody said, let's get Biden/Harris in office and call it a day. From day one, we keep fucking working and pushing. And if a less shitty cabinet can save some lives, then bet I'm picking them over the current one purposely screwing over &amp; killing thousands on their watch.
No leverage?  Blk voters have immense leverage and there is already a critical mass of BLK ppl that oppose this ticket.  Biden needs Obama numbers, nearly unanimous support to win.  He hasn't got that and he needs it. Thats partly why he chose Harris.  Thats the leverage.
Are we talking about Trump or Biden?
He‚Äôll be 75 years old in 2024 (younger than Biden is now but I think voters are going to be over Boomers/senescence in the next cycle).  Also voted with most of the other Big 10 presidents to postpone football, how‚Äôs that going to play in the GOP primary (only half joking).
Enjoy the cartoons, particularly the one from the buffalo news. (Prince's "Baby, I'm a Star" fits the VP selection.) #KamalaHarrisVP
A vote for Trump sounds like a vote for Trump.  Until Biden puts a real economic agenda, up to and including Reparations on the table, the overwhelming blk support needed to win is void.  Harris being a BLK woman is irrelevant. Her VP aspirations are not Reparations.
Biden your FIRED
Biden DPIKE ST THE HEAD OF KKK FUNERAL TRUMP FIDNT YOU IDIOT. Democrats voted to keep slavery Republicans VOTED TO END IT. SMARTEN UP AOC.
Our economy is the worst it has been since 1930 because of trump. Joe Biden wants to restore the economy and bring jobs the thousands who are unemployed bc there was no federal response to covid 19. Nice try though. Just throwing shit now to see where it hits.
And there will be an army from the grassroots on the ground explaining why voting for a Biden/Harris ticket without a specific Blk agenda in the table is suicide.  #NoBlackAgendaNoVote  #ReparationsNow
How will BLK citizens benefit from Biden/Harris "Crossing the finish line"?  Dr. West, their ticket has committed zero economic policies to BLK citizens.  Its the same Obama hornswoggle you once lamented we fell victim to.  90% support with zero in return.  We CAN'T do that again

No. Maybe if Biden had picked Karen I would have, but not now. You're a despicable human being Bernie Sanders, and you never believed a damn thing that came out of your mouth.
Doesn't sound at all like Biden at all good try tho, shows just how low you can go but I still think you haven't hit rock bottom yet your hair is still glued to your head
It means they have nothing but complete faith that Biden is capable to handle the job for a few hours.
So Biden is so incompetent that he let the mob chose his VP,  and then it actually ending up mattering more than the man, himself .. running for President.
Didn't Kamala call Biden out for his multiple sexual accusations?
Didn‚Äôt she call Biden a ‚Äúracist‚Äù? And how many black men do you think she put in prison for weed charges? And why isn‚Äôt Biden debating Trump?

What a terrible choice for Biden and the Democrats!
Harris is also infinitely better than Biden

Not to mention his impeachment for his roll in withholding funds unless Ukranians investigated Biden. Not a Biden supporter, but unfortunately he is the lesser of 2 evils. We can go on forever about this. Probably get no where.
The guy I replied to literally made up comments based on his opinion and not fact. Harris and Biden have both lied, do you call out their lies?  Wow.

I find it funny how Bernie doesn't call out Biden's racist behavior and policies. Kamala did tho during the debate,let, and then bowed down to lick his boots for a seat at the plantation table.  Dems are such frauds.
That would be racist Biden

Not even a great metaphor because Biden is not chicken. Biden is a ball of lard. The choices are ball of lard or steaming dog shit with razor blades. Ball of lard is edible and the obvs choice, but sure af ain't appetizing or even healthy.

He knew when the Mueller report dropped he would just claim exoneration regardless of what the report said. Same thing on Nov 4. He will declare victory even if Biden wins by a landslide. Barr helped coverup the Mueller report, &amp; he'll help Trump overturn the will of the people.
Don't you dare give any credibility to the BS Biden and Harris are spitting out about going to bat for the little guy. Both are as slippery as they come.
I'll stand maskless and naked to cast my vote for Biden.

No one fears the racist Biden and the woman who traded sex for positions in state government.  The left already stated they didn't want Harris that's why she dropped out.  Nice try though. You should live in reality.
I have felt really torn since the 1st word of Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs running mate. On one hand as an Indian Man it‚Äôs amazing to see her come so far for us and for women; but on the other, it‚Äôs hard to feel she is little more than a piece on the Progressiveness checklist to him.

I'm no fan of Biden, but Biden never suggested we try Clorox. as for dem govs.  There's plenty of blame to go around. Nursing homes were given advance notice. everyone fucked up. No one was prepared for what happened. Those Govs should have monitored that situation better.
Nice try.  Make sure you hold Biden accountable for all his racist comments. I totally don't believe he's not a full blown racist.

Some insights on the Kamala Harris VP pick and what it could mean for #energy policy in a Biden administration from
Exactly! And a centrist Dem president will have to be more responsive to public pressure, because they'll be facing it from both sides. I don't support Biden, but he'll support what I DO support long before Trump will. If not, we get rid of him, but Trump is burrowing in.
I see so many people talkin about the problems with Biden/Harris.... okay.... but lets focus
Meanwhile we worry that if Biden is elected, ONLY the things Trump has done will be reversed. We need #Progress vs back to "normal"

She's so frigging smart that she called out Biden's racist polices and now is a leader on his racist plantation. Talk about hypocrisy.  Yeah she's smart alright.  LMFAO
Bwahahaha.  This is dumb. Her leadership? You mean the leadership where she calls out Biden's racist policies and then bows down and licks the boots of Biden the plantation owner in exchange for a seat at the table. Leftist hypocrisy writes itself. FOH.  LMFAO.
Totally. I was hoping for Kamala, but willing to vote for Biden no matter who he picked! We need that orange blob out of office!
This is just further proof liberalism is a mental disorder. Tears of joy for a VP pick who is nasty, traded sex for work, and then after calling out Biden's racist polices, bows down and licks the boots of the racist master. You wasted those tears of joy.
We don't have to engage in fantasy to support the Biden-Harris ticket.  Let's just do it because it's so much better than the ugly alternative.

Yeah because wanting healthcare for all, corporate accountability and a truly clean environment is self-centered. Just admit that Biden isn't going to do what's in the best interests of this country.
Do..  People realize that anything Biden/Harris will do will not be as bad as another four years of Trump/Pence?  It, actually, may be better!  Weird thought, I know.

One of the biggest and best things Biden can do as president is simply apppoint qualified people of integrity who are committed to the mission of their departments. Trump appointed people intent on dismantling their departments to enrich themselves and their donors.
You forgot that Democrats want to burn down the country, you will be  unsafe if Biden wins, and democrats are trying to cancel American history. Fox News literally repeats these points every 5 minutes.
What? Obviously, you only went 1 later deep: it was Yangs fault that it was Bernies fault that Biden/Harris lost.
It's made specifically for blue checks to avoid having to deal with criticism. Notice they rolled it out the day Biden announced Copmala as his VP choice
If Trump stays in, we can't touch him for AT LEAST four years. If we put Biden in, Trump can face civil justice, &amp; Biden goes under the lens for everything he does, we spend 4-8 years rolling back Trump's agenda while the current batch of Progressives prepare for 2024/28.
Biden is bad news on a whole list of fronts. But a few things make him "touchable". The big one is that he doesn't have the GOP protecting him. When he breaks laws, he'll have the Centrists on his side, and the Right and Left both hounding him. He is impeachable. Trump is not.
Even if you feel this way, consider, who is more vulnerable to civil oversight while in office? It's not Trump. The GOP/Right will destroy everything to protect his evil, but if/when Biden messes up, we can reach out and "Whoah there Joe... You wanna get impeached maybe?"
Abolish the electoral college so every vote is equal and then we can have a real conversation, but until that moment my vote in the deeply blue state of New York doesn't matter. I will not be voting for the guy who killed my girlfriend. An actual bag of shit? Yes. Joe Biden? No.
I'm Palestinian, I have issues with almost every US politician dehumanizing the shit out of my people (Biden and Harris included). But all of these takes that ignore Harris' consistently progressive record as AG to call her a cop as a "gotcha" are just trolly.
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and their fellow Democrats¬†are fighting hard for vote-by-mail, but they can't do it alone. With the most important election of our lifetimes less than 100 days away, we need to show that vote-by-mail has the overwhelming support of the American people.
Be Carefull Minnesota this is What She Brings! Biden embraces them, Quotes the Quran Does that surprise anyone! Muslim Emoms call for Mosques üïå to be used as command posts. Govrnment hiding behind religious freedom! Wait.....
I've heard many, many people who say they're down with Trump and will vote for Biden ‚Äî or anything that has a heart beat.
I think she just got a few good zingers in on Biden in the debates
So you are not really for Biden and Harris you are against Trump but do not fool yourself that either of them has changed in anyway Sleepy Joe is corrupt and Kamala is plain nasty
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
Biden is nowhere near as Bad as Trump. And even if he was, he's a capable leader. Which is something I'm willing to sacrifice some of my politics to have. Work on the House and the Senate, then get progressives in the WH.
Joe Biden is Catholic and you let wrestlers be sexually abused! Someone that ignores sexual abuse like you did has no right to question the morals or values of another human being! You are among the lowest form of life, Gym "I like to ignore sexual abuse" Jordan! #GymJordanKnew
Huh? First of all Biden is a Catholic but....
Biden/ham sandwich gets my vote!
I‚Äôm waiting for the ‚ÄúNext Obama Administration‚Äù accusations. But Biden truly does know all the right people. And many of them, smart, talented patriots all, worked in the previous administration.
I might take a leave of absence from Facebook until the election is over lmao. Too many white liberals who couldn‚Äôt possibly consider voting for Biden when we‚Äôre literally trying to remove fascism from office. K

President Trump responds to Kamala Harris‚Äô selection as Biden‚Äôs VP and political analysts look at how it might impact the race!!!  #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris #KamalaHarris
Biden‚Äôs ad highlights that American travelers have few choices these days. The high infection rate of COVID-19 across most of the United States continues to be a deal breaker for most of the world‚Äôs countries that have controlled the disease more successfully. Here‚Äôs an overview:
There are only a few states where Lefties can afford to not vote for Biden like CA, NY and a few New England states.  Everyone else has got to stampede the polls for Biden b/c anything less than a solid win will enable Trump to declare the results invalid.
Trump may try to outflank Biden on marijuana legalization by attacking Harris‚Äô record of prosecuting marijuana possession and Biden‚Äôs opposition of legalization. Hopefully Biden realizes this and the obvious political upside of being on the right side of a 60/40 issue.

Biden Flat Out Lies That Trump Said He'd Defund Social Security, Twitter Does Nothing About It  via
I think you're right but maybe one thing that bugs people is the possibility that she might be perceived as actually progressive on criminal justice. No one is fooled when Biden or Klobuchar pretends to be progressive but it feels like Harris might pull it off.
The 'Trump is the worst ever' argument still doesn't save you from making a racist remark and calling someone you don't know Uncle Tom. Sorry to break it to you, but Biden is the (arguable) palatable version of Trump. He's not as blatantly racist, but still so. You've been had.
Biden allied himself  with a MMA fighter  will the fascists  exploit this slobbing  of the neo aware corporate  re-branded culture  of pretty ma control mechanisms
Discussion tonight- anyone that is against Biden/Harris ticket would ever be pleased. Far left would only be happy if it was Bernie &amp; someone more to the left. Center right - if you are against this ticket you‚Äôre just looking to vote Trump anyhow.
Didn't she also believe Biden's accuser?
Spot the difference. Anyways chile vote for Biden.
you and your little dog Pence say "We won't be safe in Biden's America?" You've killed 163,000 with your bungling, our streets are on fire, and there is no end in sight under your lack of leadership and you want us to fear Biden? You need a new cognitive test.
Look I don't like Harris, and Im not a huge fan of Biden. But right now I would elect a Republican who is capable of leading over Trump. If we can get the house to be more progressive, then the Senate. We can move on to the president. Right now we need leadership in any form.
Just a great choice for American culture - Biden / Harris - have the same values of a majority of Americans. A powerful ticket and hopes to bring other Democrats into office. Time to turn the white nationalists aside.
As they say - picking your running mate is the first major decision a person running for president. And Biden picked a great running mate. Charadmatic - tough - will be able to stand against the ‚Äú bully‚Äù.
Wow big selection move by Biden üëå this election year goin be history and huge I see
It's just Biden-Harris. Sen. Harris is not married to anyone named Cobb.   But if you are linking  to Biden and Harris, you are doing her a favor, Americans hate Putin-Trump.
A good move for Biden IMO would be to announce some cabinet picks before the election. Just saying hey remember this person you supported yeah they gonna run the monies now ok bye
It's been about five hours since Kamala Harris was announced as Biden's VP pick and the white supremacists are already out in full force questioning her African descent as a person of Jamaican heritage. They're as predictable and transparent and as they are ignorant and pathetic.
WOWWWWWW what a fucking pathetic loser.
That‚Äôs why he picked her. She‚Äôs real tough on crime. Biden/Kamala are going to be the Reagan/bush of the 2020s
Right now our country is sooooo far 2 the right that swinging the pendulum waaaay over 2 the left isnt the answer. Biden/Harris will bring things back 2 middle ground &amp; then go from there. Middle ground is what we need right now. Theres 2 much damage 2 repair b4 moving forward.
Also if she‚Äôs such a tool of the radical left, why was there so much distance between her and Sanders/Warren on the debate stage?   They‚Äôre trying the socialist boogeyman attack AGAIN (first Biden, now Harris) in a race where both are actually pretty moderate.
Kamala deserves benefit of the doubt on her DA/AG record given the hurdles to get where she did. Also overpolicing -traffic ticket revenue model, racist drug war/mass jailing, unconsented surveillance state- legit top issue. Reconciling revolves around Biden. That‚Äôs troubling
I support a revolution not a political party. Bernie may not have won his Battle but we are winning the war for Congress &amp; the Senate so far, by voting for grass roots Progressives which I do! Not by participating in a glorified  opinion poll between TRUMP &amp; BIDEN. What a joke!!

Biden‚Äôs going to resign a week into his presidency
was asked, seeing as how Republican governor John Kasich is speaking, do you want Mr. Yang? To which Biden said, "No, I don't feel like Chinese tonight."
You signed an executive offer?  And you criticize Biden?   Panicky trumpy?  Good look for an orange egomaniac to see you blanch.  It‚Äôs truly beautiful.
Not only will we remove Donald Trump from the White House this November ‚Äî we will elect the first person of color and the first woman as Vice President of the United States.  Let‚Äôs get to work, Democrats.
The dumbasses who think that Joe Biden is the worst Democratic presidential candidate are the same people who have never heard of that assclown known as Mike Bloomberg. #BidenHarris
even Joe Biden didnt want to be tethered to walking gaffe factory Elizabeth Warren
Good luck you're going to need it... And I'm not a Trump supporter. I hope mr. Biden's mind Comes together because I think he's losing it.
And that's all fine and dandy Lisa. But Biden is a mess. I truly feel he has beginning stages of dementia.  I despise Trump he's an idiot... I just pray for our country.
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for everything the protests stand against

The cop.  For reform.Damn not really dedicated to this Biden thing are ya
THE REAL REASON WHY JOE BIDEN PICKED KAMALA HARRIS FOR HIS RUNNING MATE
On November 3,2020 remember Obama administration spied on President Trump. Democrats and fake news media lied about Russiangate. Biden will never debate President Trump. Kamala lied about Kavanaugh. Kamala is not black. Pedophiles were protected by democrats and fake news media.
Would continuing to bitch about progressives or phone banking for Biden further your cause
No mail vote.we shopping at Costco, we can vote in person...You just looking for away to still elections. You know Biden has lost his mind...
Remember Mr Biden,we talked about this many times before,just like yesterday,and the day before. Absentee vote,is not the same as mail in voting. Just like legal immigrants are not the same as illegal immigrants. Remember??
What about cutting the cheese? Will they let Biden and Kamala cut the cheese? Perhaps at the debate?
You will see Biden (he probably submitted when VP) and I have no issues with everyone in congress as well

How about the endless number of videos with Biden inappropriately touching and whispering in little girls ears? If Trump did that he would be shot
Its crazy, a week ago I was actually looking forward to seeing Trump lose, not because of any love for Biden just because seeing Trump lose would be cool but after seeing dems be so self congratulatory for picking Harris for VP I‚Äôm lowkey back to rooting against them
No prob just need a Trump/Biden/Sanders/yang/Harris tribunal
Trump, have you forgotten? When you ignorantly call Joe Biden condescending names, don't forget about the fitting names given for you. Joe has too much class, so I will stand in for him. Dumb Trump Donald Duck Frompy Trump. Pick one.
So you are saying as Vice President of the United States there was no action Biden and Obama could‚Äôve taken for 8 years as the post office lost billions? The highest offices in our government were helpless even with a democrat legislative majority? Please stop.
When was BIDEN VP again? How does this change what I said. They still lost close to 100 billion in his 8 years. Even if you take off the pension cost from last year the post office lost 3.8 billion. Supply link for your claim please.
Already they are trying to deny, deny ! Schiff &amp; Biden wouldn't even be talking about the investigation if there was nothing there ! I guess they "as usual" must try to take the focus off themselves &amp; put on Trump ! Biden did some bad things &amp; he will never be POTUS !
I just realized I can mute certain words on Twitter and my life immediately improved.  Muted words: Biden Kamala Trump Democrat Republican  üòéüòéüòé
Only now the dems are interested. 8 years Biden was VP they lost close too 100 billion. I am ok with mail in ballots. What is not ok is that there is no structure or system out in place for the number of ballots they will get. The USPS is NOT part of our democracy.
Americans need to act! NYTimes #PostalService
How long before Hunter Biden and Kamala hook up.
"Fox News medical contributor " Oxymoron or just moronic?  THIS right here claiming no science behind mask mandate.  Playing Russian Roulette.

I‚Äôm not suicidal, unlike you! Prepare to lose in November, MAGAt! And once Joe Biden wins, I‚Äôll have NO SYMPATHY for you! üñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñï
It would be accurate if Biden had shown even remote interest in what the left actually wants. If instead ignoring the majority of AMERICANS let alone Dems he supported M4A. He has come out agains the very foundations the true left stands for.
Stunning how for the 8 years when BIDEN was VP the post office lost close to 100 billion and not one democrat himself included cared. Now they claim it is needed for our democracy? Since when? Wasn‚Äôt created for that and can‚Äôt be broken up at any time.
So is it about medicine or Democracy? Did the usps get more important for some reason this year then the 8 it lost close to 100 billion when BIDEN was VP?
It wouldn‚Äôt be cancelled if   Biden was already in charge .  Soon though this dangerous Conservative experiment will be over #BidenHarris2020
What great "leader" do you know that has to force his or her flowers to do something? A mandate isn't leadership.   Everyone should wear masks. A leader would convince them to wear masks. Neither #biden nor #trump is a leader in that sense
We won‚Äôt forget you are shutting down our post office and killing your people with your incompetence.  Joe Biden will keep the peace and we will be alive to enjoy it.  Tell fat boy to start packing.
How about Biden??? He‚Äôs been there for 40 years
A handful. I someone post a picture on FB of Biden chocolate in her fridge. I asked her if it smelled good? But I‚Äôm not sure she got my reference. üòÜ
Biden is uninspiring.  His campaign is built on fear and not hope.  His saving grace is that his administration is not trying to undermine the social safety nets and basic systems that keep the country functional
If you want to tear the country down, Trump is your guy.  Just know that you might not be where you want to be on the other side of it.  If you think the country is salvageable, Biden‚Äôs your guy.  But he is in no way a revolutionary.
Biden could easily be framed as a Republican based on his record.  But Trump is not even a Republican.  Trump‚Äôs whole playbook is deregulation with a head start for his circle so they can cash in.
This is very disappointing, Van. I thought you were more level-headed than this. If you were saying you‚Äôre holding your nose and voting for Biden-Harris, I‚Äôd have no gripes. But I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd hear this kind of sycophancy from you.
Crazy how Biden supporters don‚Äôt see this. Imagine hating a President so much that you hate the peace he is bringing.

Obama is the best we have. We are lucky he is close to Biden I look forward to his voice.

NEVER BIDEN
If it is the last breath I have in my body, I will be voting for Biden/Harris on November 3rd. I have a back problem &amp; can‚Äôt stand for more than 5 - 10 minutes. I WILL STAND, KNEEL, CRAWL OR WHATEVER on November 3rd. Hopefully the rest of my NY family will do the same.
Catholics take note about this promise from Mr. Biden.
That's a LAUGH! Joe Biden will ANNIHILATE Trump...and the man can do it in his sleep!
Still think Dems have tricks up their sleeves. Biden off the ticket for medical reasons, mail-in voting fraud, worse case scenario involving attempts on life and limb God forbid, the Dems are desperate.  But i think POTUS knows all of this and yes, it should be a landslide.
I think you have to connect with what they care about first. That‚Äôs subjective and personal. I find pointing out that Biden is a creeper who smells little girls and says the craziest crap is something many agree with.
And, what have You done for the US: Implated hatred, divided us,  lied about the virus resulting in 165,000+ dead Americans!  Stop praising others &amp; FOCUS your last 80+ days left! Beacuse Biden/Is next to fix the damage you have CAUSED OUR Naation and the Wolrd!
I wonder if #biden chose #KamalaHarris  because she smelled the best when he sniffed her. Although Harris may be too old for his tastes
Was this the mantra during the 8 years Obama - Biden were in office as they lost close to 100 billion? Or is it the mantra now that you want something from them?
Of course it was. Anything positive you can relate to the Obama Biden admin anything gnegatuve trump just didn‚Äôt listen.
I'd love to know what game  playing. She's not stupid by any means. Why she hosts &amp; encourages the Trump crazies like James Kallstrom &amp; even Trump himself today is beyond me...
Could you please let Marie know that its not up to Joe Biden !! Is she serious saying Joe wants a mandate on wearing masks but he's going to leave it up to each state ? Really, I guess he thinks he's the President now ?
All the times Kamala Harris criticized Joe Biden during the Democratic primary
Can you elaborate on what Obama and his VP Biden did to save the usps as it lost billions 8 years while they where in office with a high loss of over 13 billion? Now it‚Äôs an issue?

Just venting. As I've said many times, I've dreamed of a wave of reform for 20+ years &amp; this year was the best &amp; maybe last shot at it. Those dreams were dashed by Biden's candidacy. He's a mediocre, not that bright, over the hill loser....
This is the problem w Biden's candidacy. Same old, same old. Bloomberg &amp; Kasich get prime time speaking slots but  gets a lousy 60 seconds. I would have given former Senator Al Franken &amp; Larry Flynt slots but I'm not a highly paid political consultant...

Tears are running down my eyes as I listen to Biden speak. It gives me hope to hear a man of integrity, speaking of the atrocities of the Trump presidency and how he and Kamala will restore the nation's soul. A joy to see a light glimmer  after years of darkness.
Watch Live: Biden and Harris Make First Appearance as Running Mates in Delaware - The New York Times (Kushner issues orders from Netanyahu) #TheSagaContinues
Am I the only one falling asleep during Biden‚Äôs debut?
Sounds like a plan.   The part about Booker running Biden's HUD, that is.
another thing both biden and trump have in common. these guys are sick
This is how bankrupt the #democrats are. "We don't think #bidem will finish a term but we didn't want to vote for his VP during the primaries."
Trump is so meanspirited. Mary Trump chronicled in her book that Trump lies at-will. She says that Donald feels entitled to lie with no conscience of who is  insulted. People who have good sense have to know that Trump is mentally ill to say that Biden is " against God"
Sure that‚Äôs possible, but I am not convinced Biden has.
so what‚Äôs your stance on Biden‚Äôs VP Pick again? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Mane all I‚Äôm saying is if y‚Äôall vote for Biden and Harris don‚Äôt be surprised half the population of the U.S. is incarcerated for petty crimes.
I was, and am, a big Sanders/Warren supporter. Biden &amp; Harris aren't my dream ticket. It doesn't matter. Trump is a Fascist narcissistic ignoramus who has already run roughshod over our democratic republic. We do not have the luxury of sitting this one out. I mean, really!.....
A Catholic that supports abortion is not a Catholic they are not even Christian hence Joe Biden. #JoeBiden #JoeBiden2020

Sure I get your point of people‚Äôs beliefs evolving and shifting. Problem is those laws along with others created the criminal justice system we have today. Likewise, Biden‚Äôs remarks are still racially charged, so it‚Äôs hard to see that he has evolved in his belief system today.
I believe you mean Biden is racist, Trump never said anything remotely close to what Biden has said...
It's amazing to me how much "steam" this narrative is getting. Not to mention how transparent what's going on here is. My guess is anyone backing Kanye wasn't voting Biden no matter what.
PLEASE don‚Äôt vote 4 Biden n Harris
What racist mantra? You realize the Biden actual words right! You realize his running mate called him a racist. But yes it‚Äôs my mantra. Ignore his history. Please tell me what your racist Trump did to the  black community?
Powerful, disturbing piece by Mr Kellyanne Conway:  I believe Joe Biden is sleepy &amp; weak. I believe Biden could hurt God &amp; the Bible. I believe that if Biden is elected there will be no religion no anything. He wld confiscate all guns immediately.  Waiting for I, Claudia comment.

Ok then. Guess you win. Policy doesn‚Äôt matter to anyone anymore. I hope you‚Äôre not a protestor &amp; don‚Äôt know any because under a Biden-Harris presidency they would be seeing the same resistance as they have under 45. But Biden will... tweet less?
You wish, fool! Trump &amp; Pence will be CRUSHED by Biden &amp; Harris! They can‚Äôt even stand up to Nancy Pelosi because they‚Äôre scared of her!
Right and my point is because 45 is abhorrent and incompetent or whatever disparaging word you would like to use... it doesn‚Äôt make Biden a good candidate. It doesn‚Äôt mean Biden-Harris will change anything.
Can‚Äôt wait for the Donny Show - Lying Edition tonight.  Spot his lies  on Covid, Biden, Harris, Russia and guest  topics that will be added impromptu.  Drinking game  anyone?
Oh snap!!! You got him!!! Nice job man! Biden would spell Booker‚Äôs name right the first time! Best POTUS nominee ever!
How many people do you reckon would be dead with Biden as president during this global pandemic?
What in the world are we expecting to change if Biden takes over? Less tweets? More ‚Äúprofessionalism‚Äù? Nothing of substance that will help disenfranchised people. No M4A means the last four months under Biden would‚Äôve looked similar to 45‚Äôs rule.

Biden was going to pick her for Vice President but Harris hair smelled better üò≥üò≥üò≥
Trump couldn't understand w hy Biden selected Harris after she was nasty, because Trump holds a grudge permanently if someone speaks against him. Biden has more maturity and depth of character and knows how to forgive ‚ù§Ô∏è

Nope. Voting for Biden. Guess that zero tolerance for misogyny policy of yours isn‚Äôt exactly true is it
We‚Äôve said we‚Äôre gonna vote for Biden, even though we think he‚Äôs terrible. What more do you want
Look up the crime bill of 94, the crack-cocaine bill of 86, and the comprehensive crime control bill of 84. All authored by Biden along with Thurmond a known segregationist...Look up Kamala‚Äôs record as a prosecutor.  Then ask yourself who did more to hurt minority communities? ü§î

Biden opposes everything the left wants and you really can‚Äôt wrap your head around why the left doesn‚Äôt support Biden with enthusiasm and no criticism?must offer  a high ranking position in his Administration.

I see very little value in Biden or Harris agreeing to debate. Trump and Pence will use debates as free airtime to spew their usual lies, and baseless attacks and distractions. Think how furious Trump would be to be deprived of a big stage to lie and distract.
Warning: the corrupt Attorney General Bill Barr likely plans to get false charges filed against Biden, Obama, or other Democrats before the election. This will be a garbage political stunt to aid Trump‚Äôs election prospects. #ImpeachBarr

Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate Trump. Trump will just lie and try to distract and smear. Biden should demand Trump release all his tax returns and financial documents as a condition of a debate. Then there would be NO debate.
Would you be okay with Democrats lying, cheating and stealing an election?  Would you enjoy a Democrat President bullying anyone who disagrees with him/her?  Luckily, you don't have to worry about that happening. Biden-Harris want to unify the Country not sow hate.

One of the biggest and best things Biden can do as president is simply apppoint qualified people of integrity who are committed to the mission of their departments. Trump appointed people intent on dismantling their departments to enrich themselves and their donors.

Just a great choice for American culture - Biden / Harris - have the same values of a majority of Americans. A powerful ticket and hopes to bring other Democrats into office. Time to turn the white nationalists aside.
As they say - picking your running mate is the first major decision a person running for president. And Biden picked a great running mate. Charadmatic - tough - will be able to stand against the ‚Äú bully‚Äù.
It's just Biden-Harris. Sen. Harris is not married to anyone named Cobb.   But if you are linking  to Biden and Harris, you are doing her a favor, Americans hate Putin-Trump.
Right now our country is sooooo far 2 the right that swinging the pendulum waaaay over 2 the left isnt the answer. Biden/Harris will bring things back 2 middle ground &amp; then go from there. Middle ground is what we need right now. Theres 2 much damage 2 repair b4 moving forward.
I support a revolution not a political party. Bernie may not have won his Battle but we are winning the war for Congress &amp; the Senate so far, by voting for grass roots Progressives which I do! Not by participating in a glorified  opinion poll between TRUMP &amp; BIDEN. What a joke!!

Guess what America? New York is open and nobody is going to restaurants,  or any other place where it is crowded! What do think the effects of that over the next 3 years is? By the time Biden takes over his main job will be to shorting food line times!
The fact that the sturgis rally was allowed means there is no hope that federal leadership can contain the virus! The United states is in for a long protracted period of death and economic catastrophe! By the time Biden assumes office it will be horrific!
If I had my way, Stacey Abrams would be VP choice and Kamila Harris would be AG.  But I will fully support whoever Joe Biden chooses.
Don't recall Obama having deal w/this crap. At time ran for Presidency lacked years of foreign relations&amp;experience,so he chose Biden for his skills.Should choose whom he's able to work well w/&amp; govern with. When trying to make color of skin a demand makes those seem racist.
Joe Biden could nominate a moldy ham sandwich, and it would be a significant improvement over anyone in the current administration.
Down an incredibly steep ramp, and then he will run. If we can get Joe Biden to hang out with Tony Hawk, it might make for some interesting Trump footage later.

Like Biden‚Äôs head, this is empty. Just boilerplate nonsense. The undeniable fact is the economy under  was the best anyone alive had ever seen.  At this point  is lucky if can operate a light switch.
It amazes me how real the outside world looks(seeing that Trump constantly implies Biden is in his basement all the time). I'd love to see Trump get some real exercise &amp; attempt to even balance himself on a bicycle... That be a real treat, almost another Trumpgait.
Ya see if the Blacks don't vote for Biden then the idea is Trump will win. . . .
Just imagine if, in September, the DNC announces that Biden can‚Äôt continue and uses their power to appoint someone else. It‚Äôs not hard to picture. I think it‚Äôs why this VEEP choice is so drawn out.
Not even then, the few days before second Super Tuesday when Sanders` campaign was urging people to stay home to help quell the spread of the pandemic and the DNC and Biden's campaign were all "no, no, vote, LOL what a bunch of panicmongers". Literally kill us rather than lose.
Yep. We‚Äôre good. Nothing to worry about here. Grandpa Biden will bring us right back to 1969, the last year he remembers clearly.
I can see where she's coming from. No matter who Biden selects, some will be happy while others critical. Maybe this is just a way to remind people the two would lead as a team. Unlike what we've been seeing now where Pence is a silent, complicit puppet.
It is laughable that Biden gets criticized for a miss characterized statement when trump makes  insane statements on a hourly basis!

At times, I don‚Äôt think either major party candidate really wants to win. The Dem VP thing is so hard because right after the convention, the DNC is going to replace Biden. He‚Äôs going to fail some fitness test or other, and he‚Äôs going to get replaced.

I don't know if it's drugs or what, but Biden has deteriorated badly in the last few years.
I was just listening to Shapiro.  He was reading a statement from Biden claiming credit for the peace deal that Kushner just finished brokering between Israel and the UAE.   I wonder if Creepy Joe is so far gone mentally that he actually believes that.

#2of#2 they could even think about winning anything.  What's Biden doing beside hiding in his hole.  When he's out he won't answer questions or he says the same thing over and over. What a waste of time he is. His choice of VP is going to save him? How will he cure the virus??
There are multiple low life people in this country.  Who could blame President Trump for the corona virus. Are we talking about the Democrats?  Who else?Tthey are doing everything to make him look bad because of the vote for Biden which is the only way  #1 0f #2
PENCE: The selection of California liberal Senator Kamala Harris as Joe Biden&amp;#039;s running mate simply confirms everything President Trump and I have been saying about Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.
honestly I have two Biden signs in the garage and I‚Äôll put them up just before the election but my two anti-trump signs have been up for months. we just don‚Äôt feel the need for Biden signs cause he‚Äôs a lock here in NY.

If you think Biden would have handled the Wuhan virus any better than Trump has, you're delusional.  Cuomo is clearly more competent than Biden and he condemned thousands of elderly to death when he mandated positive patients be admitted to nursing homes.
Unfortunately I believe the Hillary affect to still be there with Harris. Many voters believe including me that Harris will be either a president if something happens to Biden or she will be the nominee in 2024 because of a Biden‚Äôs age.

She said she believed that Biden was a sexual predator when multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct, rape. Now all is well? Kamala is a self serving narcissist who cares about her career not the country, lacks character, principles, morals
The priority right now has to be a fair election. If that means using FedEx or UPS or private citizens to get ballots in then that is what we have to do. Biden can fund and save the USPS once he's elected.
Biden is an angry man. He &amp; Harris read from a script, she's going to be easy to take apart. Biden well, what the socialist marxists are doing is close to elder abuse. They made deals after Bloomberg did damage for all to drop out, let Biden take control &amp; Sanders fell for it.
Most of all, she's bringing positive energy backed up by BRAINS and DETERMINATION!  She will be an amazing VP and the number one adviser to President Biden.
I‚Äôll ask the question again because nobody gave me the answer. If Biden accepts the nomination and becomes incapacitated before election will Harris be the candidate?

Biden/Harris are not technically moderate, they are just establishment modern day democrats and going up against Bernie Sanders and the left wing progressives will make you seem moderate.
Let's talk about the Biden Harris campaign and what it means for us....  via
Just adding that Biden is a  alumni.
Biden does support social security expansion, so they are in lock step on this as well.
The only 2 things her sponsored/co-sponsored bills show is she might be a little left of Biden on the environment and expansion of social security. Other than that he Senate record would suggest they had similar goals to what Biden had discussed in the primary.
The proper way to frame this is ‚ÄúJoe Biden calls for every governor to issue statewide mask mandate.‚Äù It‚Äôs technically not a national mandate. A national mandate would be the federal government mandating something.
‚ÄúEvery single American should be wearing a mask when they‚Äôre outside for the next three months, at a minimum. Every governor should mandate ‚Äî every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing,‚Äù Biden said.
It‚Äôs amazing how everyone including news media has seemed to misconstrue Biden‚Äôs mask comments. He used the word ‚Äúshould‚Äù and said governors should institute a mask mandate in their states. He did not say I‚Äôd institute a national mask mandate. He‚Äôs going to need to clarify this.
Do we really want Biden and Clinton and Harris in the White House this is it people do or die time.
Kamala is part Indian and I guess they think the Biden/Harris ticket is in favor of forcing people to be vegetarian?  Racist thinking strikes again
Yeah no one would have died if we had Biden in the White House!
OMG.. LMAO..The orld has been laughing at America since you took office..how about you debate VP Harris as well as President Biden..we need a really good laugh!! Don't bther to call VP Harris names..shes a helluva smarter than you!!
The thing that stands out for me about this ticket is these 2 candidates exuded more warmth &amp; humanity on Day 1 of campaigning together than Trump &amp; Pence have exhibited in their entire careers. These are qualities we have sorely missed since Obama-Biden. #BuildBackBetter
So if Biden wins and subsequently becomes incapacitated Harris would not be eligible to be president. That means that depending on who wins the house the president would be pelosi or McCarthy.  Omg
Harris has a net-positive favorability rating. Not sure what that means, but I know it‚Äôs good news! #BidenHarris2020
Was waiting for him to say, "Just try to beat my meat, Kamala &amp; Biden. Just try."
Yes Sandra I sure can but seeing how you subscribe to the mind numbing ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs done nothing in over 40 years‚Äù blind followers club, it‚Äôs a waste of time and effort. Feel free to do a google search though. Stay away from Fox and Breitbart. They‚Äôre leading to your mental decline.
Question... if groups are trying to defund the police and Biden calls for a mandatory mask wearing who‚Äôs going to enforce the violators?  Will the mask violators get an appearance ticket and be  let go like the burglars, looters and assaulters?
She‚Äôs a hypocrite just like Biden and the rest of the Washington politicians.
The Biden Trump matchup isn't even that close. Trump most definitely outranges Biden's shitty aerials. The only good thing Biden has is his dumb ass up B that's only good out of shield. FAKE NEWS
He's the BEST President ever. Biden however is the left's senile version of a nazi &amp; now he wants to mandate or punish if you don't wear a mask. LOL Gestapo police &amp; he's a sexual predator according to Harris

LOL that's the end of their campaign That's all he's got. First thing -another bureaucracy Mask Police while they are trying to defund the police. Sounds like a dictator.
coming soon with Biden Harris ticket
So Biden wants to have the mask police? Really That's the plan. What a nut. Harris is already into the racism stuff, I'm sticking with our President not the radicals who don't mind cities burning, want to tax the hell out of me, open borders &amp; defund police.

There is too much time left,a d he can do so much more damage. Biden is going to spend a lot of time undoing trump's messes.
Governors have the legal ability to do so depending on the powers granted to them by their legislative bodies and in their respective constitution. The constitution does not inhibit states from doing so. Biden issuing a mandate would be a different, but that‚Äôs not what he said.
I am pretty sure Biden was for this for a long time but he knew announcing it would further Trumps anti mask reactions.  Still Someone needs to lead now.  And its Joe Biden.
She said - "This was not a search for the truth. Instead, this was about politics &amp; raw power to push through an unfit nominee." So she was angry allegations against Kavanaugh not investigated further because "about politics", but zero interest in similar against Biden? Politics!
Best possible solution that I see given our current situation? Vote Biden then fill the house with actual leftists and progressives.start thinking long term, we messed that up in 2016.
He never fails to make Biden look way more appealing than he actually is

Ah yes, the elusive white moderate vote.  Kind of crazy to me that they think there are any Trump voters left who would consider switching over to Biden at this point because Bloomberg/Kasich endorsed him. If they could be convinced, they're already convinced.
Maybe I don't get this, but I see Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, AOC, and recently Andrew Yang has been added. All are big progressive voices.  I don't think anyone believes that a Biden presidency will be a terribly progressive one, but there are certainly progressives there.

Well, it's possible he wins, but the chances are equally good Biden destroys him en route to 400+ EVs. He hasn't made any headway with the demographics he lost in 2018. Just more of the same from 2016, where he just BARELY WON an EC victory but still lost the popular vote by 2M.
I think you have what it takes to be our president some day! Biden-Harris 2020!!!
Joe Biden is the liar that's why his past election runs for President -he withdrew Just because he has a "D" after his name doesn't make him a good man. Watch-You may see some familiar faces. He lied and called himself dumb
and Van Jones agrees. You are a white man playing racial politics when it doesn't affect you at all. It's a word we hear from liberals every election. Biden has done nothing in 50 yrs of politics to help Black Community
Nothing racist. But Biden has....multiple times and he did work with KKK member ex Democrat Sen Byrd to stop busing &amp; wrote 1994 Crimes Bill that incarcerated Black Community in masses. President Trump First step Act, 2nd Chances, Funded Black colleges, Opportunity Zones-read up!
Voting Biden/Harris into office is not moving the country forward. This government is incapable of serving the people. I suggest becoming ungovernable and dismantling it

After having watch Biden and Harris speak this afternoon, it‚Äôs quite a contrast hearing the current occupant of the WH slur away in a dull monotone, mispronouncing words (fatilities?) and lying.
They wouldn't have to do anything to Sanders, since the youth vote made it abundantly clear, AGAIN, that they will not show up to vote for their livelihood. We get Biden because middle-age and older are the ones that actually participate.
These idiots think American people are stupid. In one sentence she says it's the President's fault for not handling economy (which HE built not Obama) than admits it's a pandemic. Is she suggesting the President keep the economy open so people die? Biden wanted to. Doubletalk
YES!!! If Biden's policies would have adverse effects on Americans, then they should be asked about it. Otherwise, what's the point of even asking?
I tried explaining that Trump inherited a good economy from Obama/Biden to a Republican relative and he refused to believe it. He believed the economy was bad and suddenly became good in 2016.  Newsflash: Economic policy generally takes 1-2 YEARS to affect the economy measurably.
I think Biden and Harris looked and spoke strong. But I got too admit I would love to see Kamala Harris debate Trump cause I think she would rip him a new ass hole on the debate stage.
Republicans simultaneously give Trump credit for the economy he inherited from Obama/Biden while absolving him of all responsibility for the cratering due to his utter failure of a COVID response.
I hope that it teaches little girls to educate themselves and learn a skill that employers need. And not to rely on affirmative action like Harris had to rely on. The DNC made it publicly clear that Biden was to pick a "black female". No other qualifications were necessary.
yep. people bickering over whether Biden is "progressive enough" while Trump is dismantling democracy.  We can quibble about whether we need a public option or M4A AFTER the existential threat has been dealt with
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris just delivered two slam dunk speeches!!!  I am so inspired, so motivated, so in love with the dream of saving America from the evil of Trumpism.  Both Joe &amp; Kamala spoke to America in ways we haven't heard in YEARS!  Positive energy!  Human compassion!

is joe biden perfect? no. does he make mistakes? yes.   but...  joe biden wants and tries to be a good person. donald trump doesn't care.  joe biden wants to do what's best for america. donald trump doesn't care.  and that's all you need to know about this election. go vote.

People be like ‚ÄúBiden isn‚Äôt my first choice‚Äù ok but is Trump?????
so so wise. so right about everything.  i guess i could never vote for racist biden who selected a Black woman as his running mate, and Harris who agreed to be running mate of a racist. shall i vote for non-racist trump and pence, or not vote? i've heard not voting is best.
"Trump is flat out saying that Joe Biden is going to put a black guy in charge of housing who will move a bunch of low income people of color into your white suburban neighborhood, so look out! This is just pathetically racist."

Quite apart from anything else, has it not occurred to him that Biden was the only Catholic on the ticket in 2008 and 2012?

True. But in the case of Biden and Harris, they are definitely progressive. Not left-wing, certainly, but left-wing doesn't own the label progressive.
I don't know who needs to hear this, but just because someone doesn't espouse all of the things you do doesn't make them a neoliberal.  And yes, I'm talking about Biden and Harris.
The #NexstarElex producers deserve a shoutout for updating their PowerPoint in the last 20 hours with a photo of Biden with Harris.

We all need to vote. Don't fall into the trap of comparing the ticket against your dream duo and getting discouraged; it's not productive. Imagine how much better your life will be with Trump gone, get excited, and vote. When Biden wins, advocate for the policies you support.
Hey straw man... the only problem I have is with hypocrites. No person who claims to be Christian or follower of God can justify their support of Trump, the antithesis of Christian ideals. I see you can judge Joe Biden, but can‚Äôt reconcile your support of Trump.

Senator Harris is the most qualified &amp; most dynamic choice Biden could have made!  She's smart, tough, &amp; confident.  She's worthy of being next in line to be President.  She's a voice that America needs in the White House!  She is a champion for woman's rights, people of color.
You are just full of crap! Joe Biden helped to eliminate the bankruptcy protection for student loans. Joe Biden was against Medicare for all before you were. Joe Biden is a puppet of the pharmaceutical industry determined to keep the price of life-saving drugs out of reach.
Can anyone tell me if Biden drops out after his nomination,will Harris be the presidential candidate
Nate Silver said if today was Election Day he‚Äôd have a 93% chance. (Biden). Damn I wish it was today.

5 Takeaways On The New Biden-Harris Presidential Ticket
Biden‚Äôs about banning weapons. That‚Äôs an increasingly unpopular position lately. Any VP pick would have had problems with different groups of the electorate. Regardless of the choice Trump has always had a shot. I don‚Äôt believe any VP choice would sway good or bad significantly.
I shouldn't be shocked that the people who voted Biden in the primaries think Harris is progressive but it still hurts in my soul
Joe Biden has been pretty clear on approach and big goal posts. Democrats and most of the Left is unified around platform in pre- and at- DNC Convention discussions.  What we can accomplish is set by blue seat count strength in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate.  Heavy lift ahead.
CNY Democrats React to Biden Harris Ticket
It‚Äôs crazy. Nothing they‚Äôre complaining about applies to Biden. It‚Äôs like we didn‚Äôt just have a primary where Biden took on and roundly defeated the left wing of the party. If folks want to vote for Trump, just vote for Trump. Stop with the ‚Äúlook what you made me do‚Äù bullshit.
all my homies hate biden/harris but all my homies still voting biden/harris bc all my homies get it
All the potential running mates had baggage of some kind or another. She fits in with the moderate ideas that Biden has, but also might be a progressive voice in his ear on some issues. Probably the best choice at the end of the day. She can go toe to toe with Pence.
Vote for Biden-Harris.
Please wake me when these Trump supporters stop commenting on Biden‚Äôs religion. #HypocriticalAssholes
I think Kamala Harris is a fine pick. A solid pick but I just don‚Äôt see the Biden ticket having enough muster to out fox Trump/Putin
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
Kamala Harris said she believed Joe Biden‚Äôs assault accusers &amp; said during debates that Joe Biden was in favor of segregation. The fact that she is now his running mate, would not make sense in any world until you remember that Dems have no principles except acquisition of power
I think Biden will bring back the Obama team. Valerie J, Yates, Susan Rice, Samantha Power etc. He trusts them the most.
One of the best things about Biden picking Kampala Harris is that Orange contributed to her campaign.
Most young Democrats are highly skeptical of Harris due to her record and many say ‚ÄúSettle for Biden‚Äù so I think they took this advice a while ago.
Republicans are running to BIDEN to save AMERICA from Trump!
Check out the work my friends  &amp; Rachel Landsberg are doing at  They are specifically focusing on state house races between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia to win back this ground.  And don't discount the silent Biden supporters!
Seriously don't think that Joe Biden will continue to attack Kamala Harris now that he has selected her as his VP; that's one less; it's a start; lmao
Let me help you replace Joe Biden with Donald J Trump. Now you have it right.
Keep parroting those fake Trump talking points. Biden has never said that.
Elizabeth Warren is the biggest loser of Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP candidate. If Elizabeth Warren had supported Bernie Sanders in 2016 or 2020 she might had become Bernie Sanders Vice-President. As a result of attacking Bernie Sanders she now has nothing.
Part of me really wishes that Trump had decided to register dem bc it‚Äôd be interesting to see if everyone on the left would maintain their ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt matter who it is, just vote him out‚Äù mentality just like they‚Äôre saying for Biden/Harris.. ü§îüßê
Flashbacks to Kamala Harris‚Äô wacky policies and behavior...Harris would be the President-in-Waiting in a Biden White House, and contrary to the NY Times, she‚Äôs no ‚Äúpragmatic moderate‚Äù
He will try to make it as trashy as he can. Biden and Harris have so much class he won't be able to touch them. I'm feeling hopeful again, and it feels so good.
How about turning the TV off and focus on this #trumpvirus that has killed 165,000 Americans. Why are you watching Bill Maher ? I expect Biden/Harris will come out of the gate with a plan to fight this virus. You've had 5 months and you're on Twitter talking about Bill Maher. Sad
i really can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve been screaming defund the police for months and biden was really like:   ‚Äúhold my drink‚Äù
165,000 Americans have died because of your inaction and you're concerned about how Bill Maher looks?  I want Biden/Harris who will focus on the #trumpdemic !
Lessons on God from a self described antitheist? That makes an "interesting" take. Biden claiming to be Catholic but devolving to now support abortion on demand is also a rejection of any ethical view of fetal development science, particularly as pregnancy moves beyond 5 months.
Ordered my Biden Harris 2020 Yard sign to add to my Dana Balter for congress yard sign and my "we believe" sign from signs of justice. Fuck every last Republican in this country.

Good for Biden! He's the ultimate wingman. Now how are the right-wingers going to spin this so it's a bad thing? Trump could never, ever in a million years be anyone's wingman because he's a sociopath.
Your phone didn't pass the Biden sniff test!! üòâ
So excited to see Biden's cabinet and who leads up our government.  The way it should be.
At least Biden has absolutely no shot against Trump in the upcoming election. I personally despise Trump, but his insults are funny. We just can't let this country go to loser, freeloader socialists.

Female leaders in CNY react to Biden choosing Sen. Harris as VP nominee
He has literally said he wants to invest more in policing...numerous times. Hell, he even put it in writing. Cool story though.
Biden/Harris is about as progressive as Bush/Quayle.
So when Biden gets the official nomination for Pres, he will be included in the Presidential briefings. With Kamala, one of the baddest-ass AG‚Äôs ever, now on the ticket, wonder how that will effect Barr‚Äôs future shady plots?? Battle of the evil AG Barr vs the good AG Harris??? ü§î
To every die hard liberal who‚Äôs pissed about Kamala Harris being Biden‚Äôs VP candidate  Y‚Äôall could have rallied behind Tulsi (the person who called her out) and still had a minority female VP candidate who can turn moderate conservatives for Biden  But ya didn‚Äôt ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Nah ... Elizabeth has a clutch position in the Biden Administration - no way she gets left behind ...
Why does Biden have to make it SO FUCKING HARD to want to vote for him? WHY?!
Your choice is tRump or Biden.  That‚Äôs it.
Your choices for President are tRump or Biden.  That‚Äôs it.  No amount of whining on your part will change that.  Be an adult and do the right fucking thing.

I'm going to be hyper critical of the Biden-Harris ticket the other 16 hours of the day when I'm not volunteering to get Biden-Harris elected.
She‚Äôs the only democrat to call Biden a racist too... imagine the attack adds. This is Trump‚Äôs election to lose
This makes me want to vote for Biden even more. A racist calling another racist racist. November‚Äôs coming donnie Boy
Awesome! We wanted her over Biden anyway!!!
If Biden‚Äôs not the boogie man, there must be a boogie man behind him. They probably think it‚Äôs Soros and his gain of pedos kidnapping children while eating pizza.
Wait, you think Biden acts like he likes Obama so he could get to where he is now. Didn't he just announce Kamala Harris who is biracial as his VP.
If Biden is being forced to answer for random ‚ÄúDefund the Police‚Äù twitter activists, then surely Trump should have to answer questions about QAnon conspiracy theorists who are actually winning elections.
Biden not my bro, don't Jack that.   I'm a pledged Delegate for the Senator from Vermont.   I'm calling spades spades.
This was me at work feeling bleh and Corey Driscoll Dunham (yes, I like saying it all) asks if I saw Biden's pick. I was like, dont mess with me‚Äîit would be cruel üòî She said Kamala and held up her phone. I literally jump, yipped, and squeaked. Jesus, I needed that hope ‚ù§
I finally stopped BIDEN my nails when I heard he picked Kamala as VP!
It's not hard, Biden is CP3 and Trump is Terry Rozier.  Would we rather LeBron, or Klaw, or KD? Absolutely  But you got two choices CP3, and Rozier.   Not a tough choice.
Seeing people on Facebook say that Joe Biden is a socialist is so funny. You really can‚Äôt fix stupid
History really does repeat itself.   As  pointed out, the same day the first women was added to a presidential ticket, the first  signed the state‚Äôs first seatbelt law.  Today,  is Biden‚Äôs VP and  signed an updated seatbelt law.
You‚Äôd have to be a dummy to believe that Joe Biden of all people is a radical leftist.
Same here.  I look at clips of Biden and I see my dad going through the same illness.  I can‚Äôt imagine doing that to him
My only preference for the Democratic ticket would be Harris for President and Biden (or someone else, actually) for VP.
I think people know enough about Biden and Harris‚Äô records to realize the ‚Äúradical‚Äù smear is just that, a smear.

can‚Äôt imagine being so lost at sea politically that you think Harris/Biden is a radically right wing ticket, or even a big departure from the normal D ticket. If you truly feel that way, you‚Äôre prob not going to see political victories in your lifetime. I hope you‚Äôre ok with that
I don't think Biden "hates blacks" I mean he was VP for Obama for 8 years...
I‚Äôm gonna vote Biden/Harris, no doubt. Antifascism includes participating electorally. But this stuff makes me cringe. These people are not our friends.
This is the obvious mistake that Trump and company are currently making with Biden, btw.
Excellent choice, President Biden!!!

If Republicans win the Senate and a Biden wins Presidency, then yes I‚Äôd love to see them boot McConnell out of that position in favor of someone who would actually get some work done and remake GOP for the future. If Democrats win I‚Äôd see that as less likely to happen.
Wait a minute.  Hold the phone.  üéÉ just called her phoney KAMALA  &amp; the ticket should be Harris/Biden bc she &amp; the radical left will be calling all the shots.  Did I win?

LOL. Biden wrote 1994 Crime Bill that led to mass incarceration of Black community &amp; she put them away, her handling of claims from men of color who had been wrongfully convicted of criminal charges, Laughed about smoking weed but imprisoned those who did! Yea
Tell me how you think Biden improves our current situation.
So essentially similar to Obama on trade. Good with free trade, but try to negotiate environmental and worker policy in. Much better than Trump IMO. Hopefully Bernie‚Äôs crowd hasn‚Äôt corrupted Biden too much.
Actually Kamala said Joe was the guy against inner city kids  bused to better schools as he worked w/ segregationists, she laughed about smoking "weed" when she put people in jail for it under Biden's harsh 1994 Crimes Bill-mass incarcerated Black community
The only question you need to ask yourself is: are you ok with 4 more years of Trump? If the answer is yes, then vote for anyone. If it‚Äôs no, then vote for Biden/Harris.
Joe Biden selecting #KamalaHarrisForVP is not a victory for #BlackAmerica. He introduced us to the #CrimeBill that gave us mandatory minimum and 3 Strikes. And Harris played her part in destroying black families as D.A.
Don't talk like this election is money in the bank. Biden still has to win, and sure, I guess I hope he does, but don't forget how good shit looked for Hillary at this point in 2016.
Biden-Harris v Trump-Pence: 2x the syllables. 10x the experience. ‚àû x the heart, soul, tolerance, compassion, dignity, patriotism, commitment to diversity, democracy and scientific reasoning. But hey, even if syllables are what you care about most, welcome to #BidenHarris2020
And what are you going to do when he ignores all of this shit? Even lukewarm progressives have zero leverage on Biden
Imagine being this weak that you're making excuses for a Biden being a useless president alreadyTHE REAL REASON WHY JOE BIDEN PICKED KAMALA HARRIS FOR HIS RUNNING MATE
No mail vote.we shopping at Costco, we can vote in person...You just looking for away to still elections. You know Biden has lost his mind...
What about cutting the cheese? Will they let Biden and Kamala cut the cheese? Perhaps at the debate?
You will see Biden (he probably submitted when VP) and I have no issues with everyone in congress as well
And the fact that this woman is getting support seemingly solely off her being black woman and having Jamaican heritage.....Y'all just want her to make history and nothing else. Biden definitely chose her so that he can get the black vote.
Trump doesn't care about restoring the black community and neither does Biden. We have to do it ourselves.
How about the endless number of videos with Biden inappropriately touching and whispering in little girls ears? If Trump did that he would be shot
Hey, Texas people , you all crazy, still giving Trump 46 percent against Biden. Texas is in a mess, lining up for food bank,  death rate is spiking, unemployment increasing. What is Trump doing to safeguard the texan? COVID-19 is wiping out the state, you want to elect this fool.
Hillary wanted 55. They're are bills floating around the House right now with it at 50, but in the middle of a pandemic Biden's decides that not enough people are dying unnecessarily.
Here's the thing though...Biden and Harris will continue to give away the store.
Trump, have you forgotten? When you ignorantly call Joe Biden condescending names, don't forget about the fitting names given for you. Joe has too much class, so I will stand in for him. Dumb Trump Donald Duck Frompy Trump. Pick one.
Already they are trying to deny, deny ! Schiff &amp; Biden wouldn't even be talking about the investigation if there was nothing there ! I guess they "as usual" must try to take the focus off themselves &amp; put on Trump ! Biden did some bad things &amp; he will never be POTUS !
What should Biden‚Äôs campaign slogan be? #YIAYrev
"Fox News medical contributor " Oxymoron or just moronic?  THIS right here claiming no science behind mask mandate.  Playing Russian Roulette.
If you look at Biden's record and says that any shunning of him is a "purity test", you need develop a purity test of your own. ASAP!
What theory?  My response was to the strategy of making demands of Biden AFTER he's been elected. That's a fool's errand.  I agree the Dems are OK losing. They've beaten who they wanted to beat &amp; are making it crystal clear that they're not interested in anything progressive.
Politics  of division and taxing will hurt our communities. Together with innovative approaches that give people choice that stimulate rather then stagnate our local economy we can all unite. Say no to tax and divide politics #congress #NY04 #douglastuman

How about Biden??? He‚Äôs been there for 40 years
Biden is uninspiring.  His campaign is built on fear and not hope.  His saving grace is that his administration is not trying to undermine the social safety nets and basic systems that keep the country functional
If you want to tear the country down, Trump is your guy.  Just know that you might not be where you want to be on the other side of it.  If you think the country is salvageable, Biden‚Äôs your guy.  But he is in no way a revolutionary.
Biden could easily be framed as a Republican based on his record.  But Trump is not even a Republican.  Trump‚Äôs whole playbook is deregulation with a head start for his circle so they can cash in.
Joe Biden Chooses Kamala Harris As His Running Mate And Hillary Clinton Cries Into Her Cornflakes
Big Pharma funds Trump too. The estab Dems and Repubs work for the same masters. That's why they have no issues with Trump's policies; just the way he executes them. Biden's positions are well documented. Trump's still have the space to pull a surprise from his hat.
But he hasn't said he would &amp; that's in keeping with his long political history. So there'd be reason to be skeptical if he'd come out for it. But u have to face reality. Biden &amp; the Dems leadership are in the pocket of Big Pharma &amp; 1000s will continue to die each yr as a result.
A lot of people who're taking money from Big Pharma, including Biden, are against M4A. The majority of the people who live in the country are FOR it. There's no middle ground to universal healthcare. Would you like to be one of those who get left out of that "middle ground"?
She's right. You think Biden and the establishment Dems disagree with Trump's policies; they don't. They disagree with how he goes about executing them. That's all. Biden himself has said nothing will fundamentally change. If Trump's been so terrible, why no fundamental change?

Yo me wa hear a Joe Biden Dub
Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm defending this jerk and I‚Äôll probably get heat for it but he‚Äôs right.   Biden was against the raid for many reasons, one of which was they weren‚Äôt 100 percent sure he was there.   However, Once Obama made the decision to go, Joe was 100 percent behind him.
Here is one with a quick answer: Trump or Biden?
That's a LAUGH! Joe Biden will ANNIHILATE Trump...and the man can do it in his sleep!
And, what have You done for the US: Implated hatred, divided us,  lied about the virus resulting in 165,000+ dead Americans!  Stop praising others &amp; FOCUS your last 80+ days left! Beacuse Biden/Is next to fix the damage you have CAUSED OUR Naation and the Wolrd!
Biden must be pressured to use the climate crisis to heal our economic woes. Environmentalists are increasingly maneuvering to make sure that the advisers in a potential Biden Administration understand both the peril and the promise of the moment: we either go big or we go under.
Although I have made myself minimise the Kamla criticism on my TL. I spent no time on Biden or the rest ('cept to kiki at CIgay) and don't feel good about piling on the mixed woman like she's the worst. She's not the worst. Important to keep pressure on others as well.
...In this regard I think Trump has started his political campaign smartly. It's almost as if saying Biden selecting a Black/Asian American isn't because he care...but because he wants to win and in light of the BLM Movement she was the "obvious" choice.
...thenones who feel like no matter what they wont win who will truly help Biden. This election will not be won on policies. But by fear and hope simultaneously I think. The candidates just need to know how and who to make afraid and who to give hope....
And I say if he is willing because he seems to have a littlw complex where he isn't as careful with his words and over compensates when trying to explain them. With that said Trump already has his supporters and so does Biden. Its the ppl in the middle ground who feel hopless...
Could you please let Marie know that its not up to Joe Biden !! Is she serious saying Joe wants a mandate on wearing masks but he's going to leave it up to each state ? Really, I guess he thinks he's the President now ?

Ok. So you vote for the Biden Ticket. He wins. Now there are people who think you can push them further left. How do you propose we do that? The easy answer is protest and petition. At least to me, that is where the current system does it‚Äôs best work.
Biden &amp; running mate Kamala Harris made their debut together yesterday as the presumptive Dem ticket in this year‚Äôs presidential election.  Meanwhile, Trump attacked Harris as ‚Äúnasty,‚Äù a term he commonly uses against women. #HofstraExperts can discuss:

Shit, sorry Mr. Biden sir
I bet they'd have given her more time had she'd said she wasn't going to vote for Biden without M4A or the GND being a part of the platform.
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris are going to give us all the hope we desperately need right now, Lea Thompson.
They‚Äôll do anything to discredit Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris from winning in the election, Lea Thompson. Thankfully, we‚Äôre not falling for it.
Problem is Biden‚Äôs gonna be under indictment by then so......
I actually agree with biden being more racist, but hes willing to compromise that to pander to those races, so he might be a bit more susceptible to pressure

THAT'S NOT TRUE! The task forces proved to be nothing more than the charade that they really were. Look what JUST happened with the party platform. Where are the left-leaning policies? Hillary had not left policies than Biden. Obama never switched right until he was in office.
What has Biden done to indicate that he's changed? What's he doing to indicate that he's going to change? We're in the middle if a pandemic for heaven sakes, if he's not going to come out for M4A now, when? Stop deluding urself. With Trump's unpredictability, he just might do it.
Americans are so funny. I‚Äôve seen so many think pieces regarding the lack of options for president but just last year y‚Äôall were saying anyone is better than Trump? Now they pretty much don‚Äôt mind Trump if it means not voting in Biden and Kamla ? Interesting.
The optics aren‚Äôt the same. Kamala can be next to any man as long as it‚Äôs a man she is next to. Her only requirement is to be next to one of any race. Tbh her and Biden look like Husband and wife running for office.
Good luck to the Biden &amp; Harris ticket.  I'm a disgruntled Republican. They definitely get my vote!
It IS about what they do and EVERYTHING Biden's done so far tells you that he's NOT moving left of where he is right now. Why'd he change AFTER he's been in office? What's the "progress" being made?   Yes I can prove it - Obama/Biden 2008-2016.   How's advocating for M4A a...1/2
Todays press conference of Joe Biden and Kemala Harris was refreshing and superbly handled. Trump your scare tactic s mean words and worrisome tone tells us everything. You are the one running scared. She is going to be a great VP.
A lot of folks are very supportive of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I hope the voting numbers showcase the same energy. The entire world is ready to be done with that orange man
In Trump hysterical Obama was the pattern Of corruption he Comey Brennan Clapper Yates Struk Paige are the ones who are corrupt oh did I forget creepy Joe Biden who was the disgusting person of corruption
You guys are going to lose big time with that "far-left" bullshit. Everybody knows neither Biden nor Kamala is far-left. Ah mean their actual records are enough to turn people off without you making stuff up. #Silly

New post (Jamaicans joyful as Biden picks Kamala Harris for VP) has been published on Yaadroc News -
What?! The DEMOCRATS are the ones who've been demonizing the idea of universal healthcare. Hillary said it wouldn't happen under her watch! Biden said even if it passed Congress, he'd VETO it! You're taking comfort in EMPTY words of politicians who are trying to stay relevant.
And your response to that is to fret of the leftist take over here? So a Biden/Harris ticket has got you considering Trump, a man who denies the science on COVID-19 and who has empowered both white nationalists and evangelical fundamentalists? Like take a breath, bro. 2/2
What the hell are you going on about? The left got rebuked this past election, with Bernie accepting defeat and now no Warren vice presidency. You got Joe Biden, a longtime Democratic elite, and Kamala Harris, a former DA who got rejected by leftists as being too much a cop. 1/2
Biden campaign has raised 26$MILLION in 24 hours since Harris named VP. WOW
We CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF THIS. TRUMP is trying to CUT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, MEDICAID &amp; HEALTHCARE. DON'T BE DISTRACTED. VOTE FOR BIDEN &amp; HARRIS &amp; FOR DEMOCRATS UP  &amp; DOWN THE BALLOTS IN EVERY STATE.

Not this time. BlackAmerican voters have neva been faced with an incumbent so racist, misogynist&amp;jingoistic(at least where majority black"shithole"countries r concerned). Democrats r guaranteed95%of the black vote no matter what. Biden securedTHATthe moment JimClyburn endorsd him

I‚Äôm sorry team but these are not my leaders. üßµ  1/ In a time of national uprising against the violent wheel of our racist law enforcement, Joe #Biden picks a prosecutor to run with?   COMPLETE DISREGARD for every American protesting in the streets for the last 2 months.
What is your point regarding saying that Biden and Harris is usually not articulate and able to carry an audience. You are carrying Donald Dunce water cause the question is, how did they get this far if what you say is true. You are a "double agency/Trump agent go away

Anyone that willingly says they are for Biden is obviously insane.
She &amp; Joe Biden are going to DESTROY Adolf Trump &amp; Mike Pence, Scott Dworkin! I can already see Biden &amp; Harris in the White House now!
Trump is probably hiding in his bunker to get away from Kamala Harris on account that he fears her greatly, Scott Dworkin! She &amp; Biden are going to nail Trump &amp; Pence to the wall when the debates arrive!

Trump is so meanspirited. Mary Trump chronicled in her book that Trump lies at-will. She says that Donald feels entitled to lie with no conscience of who is  insulted. People who have good sense have to know that Trump is mentally ill to say that Biden is " against God"
Quote video of Harris calling Biden a racist, she didn‚Äôt, her affair, is her affairs, an is obviously not disqualifying for public office at the WH. 45 has so many things his affairs are like parking tickets.

trump is like a cornered rat...his camp is more afraid of Biden than Biden‚Äôs camp is of them. #BelieveMe
Sure I get your point of people‚Äôs beliefs evolving and shifting. Problem is those laws along with others created the criminal justice system we have today. Likewise, Biden‚Äôs remarks are still racially charged, so it‚Äôs hard to see that he has evolved in his belief system today.
All these black folks on a whole take down agenda of Biden and Harris. Just say y‚Äôall gonna vote Tr*mp in and go. Nuff ah unu rate Tr*mp and cah say it wid unu chest.
It's amazing to me how much "steam" this narrative is getting. Not to mention how transparent what's going on here is. My guess is anyone backing Kanye wasn't voting Biden no matter what.
Biden's communications team needs to be more positive and assertive.
So why isn't Biden leading in all states?
Nothing like advancing the Black Lives Matter movement by appointing a woman who jokes about using marijuana herself then prosecutes her own historically disenfranchised people.   Biden won‚Äôt be the president, the Feds will.
I expected Bernie to lose. The polls showed that Biden would sweep the South.  Bernie was winning in small irrelevant states that were more than 80% white, getting his support from college kids and DSA clowns.
Enjoy your new war with Biden and Kamala.
If Biden or Kamala loved the country they would hand it over to Bernie and Stacey... now what? Bite me!!!!!!!
biden is more racist and sexist than trump though, and if you‚Äôre saying biden is the less of two evils you‚Äôre wrong. i‚Äôm a neutralist, i don‚Äôt support either parties, but in this situation trump is actually the lesser of two evils.

Only thing I‚Äôll say about this tweet is you can definitely say Biden is creepy. That‚Äôs established. The rest I‚Äôll agree on to this point.
No, she‚Äôs definitely wrong. New York and California are not voting for the monster. In fact he‚Äôs losing to Biden in every swing state except one where he‚Äôs tied. So it appears that you are the ‚Äúbat-shit-crazy‚Äù ones.
FYI, if Joe Biden becomes president he shouldn't have absolute unilateral power to launch nuclear weapons either.  A lot of shit that is obviously messed up about the presidency right now will still be messed up with a different president, even if it's not as obvious.

Saying that Biden will be better than Trump for people who r suffering is typical white liberal bullshit from someone who knows no one who is suffering. High living in Brooklyn with wealthy parents.

feel like there are def different layers to not liking a candidate! like biden n kamala are frightening. i didn‚Äôt really like bernie bc he is still establishment and pro-israel but i still voted for him. idk if i‚Äôll vote for biden but i think it‚Äôs valid if ppl opt out now

This is what it will look like when we all celebrate the defeat of Donald Trump and the election of Joe Biden!

A *possibility* is that they have decided to toss in any chance of an electoral win &amp; plan to saddle the Biden admin. with chaos &amp; obstructionism. Kind of 2009 on steroids. Others among em want a straight up stolen election or civil war-the more panic &amp; demoralization,the better.
YUP, they literally were doing this for ego and appearances.  Biden even said it on the congressional floor that they WERENT doing it because of it being a decent human thing it was to change the narrative of Dems being softüòíüôÑ

U being mislead, absentee voting is much different, it's not the same system and nobody parading for joe biden, doing anything for jim crow joe, keep letting  mislead u. Check out the communications act of 1934.
We have conflicting data
The issue is, will she actually stand her ground, have strong convictions, be able to make her stated progressive policies be things the Biden campaign adopts, so that they can become reality? That's the reassurance progressives are looking for.   And we have not bn getting that
Not according to studies that show tens of millions will not have healthcare because they can‚Äôt afford it under Biden‚Äôs plan
Americans were literally just polled and 70% of them support it, with around 80% of Democrats. Its not a prop, we want people to be able to survive. We want Biden to support a policy that a majority of the American people support and will save countless lives.

Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi.  Hear this loud and clear.  Just because the Dems have an outstanding ticket they will have zero chance of being elected.  Once Trump gets done with obstructing the vote the tally will be Trump 99%, Biden 1%.  Just like Saddam used to do.

No disrespect taken. The good sis did not she has not praised either as a savior. Neither have I. I believe, which have every right to disagree, that my fight may be easier won with Biden/Harris and a Democrat Congress than the current. Especially looking at the goals of the GOP
OK. Let the racism begin: KH is indeed eligible under Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution. Then the 13th Amendment regards citizenship. There's no question Harris is eligible. Do you think that Biden and his trillions of lawyers would put her forth if that weren't the case?
Been talking about voter suppression all year #onhere and yall still not even trying to see how the Dem's are complicit but the same people are going to "push Biden/Harris left" after election day  Make it make sense.

They're afraid of the boogeyman version of Biden that doesn't exist. A Marxist that will take their guns, make them gay, and force them into slavery under women and poc.
If voting for Biden were the same as voting for Trump, Republicans wouldn't be going out of their way, illegally, to prevent people from voting for Biden.
I was 40 in '94. I can attest to what the climate was like, what white people like me feared, how the rhetoric ran. Biden was kinda mainstream in that. That however, doesn't mean that it was good, wise, or somehow not racist.
Vote for Biden
Yes, i encourage everyone to read through the comments. You will clearly see that the responses to Joyce's vile, disgusting post are organic and authentic. Joyce thinks if she says "Trump and Russia" enough times, ppl will dismiss the overwhelming opposition to Biden/Harris.  No.

Correct me if I'm wrong but Biden was notoriously one of the poorest Senators when he was a Senator.
Up until now I have been pleasantly surprised with Biden‚Äôs campaign, but the DNC speaker lineup is disapointing. If Biden wants to send a message about promoting unity then the speakers at the DNC should include more speakers who truly represent all parts of the party.
His dementia sometimes forces some honesty. Most democrats DO believe that all blacks think the same and that any that don't vote democrat are not really black. This SHOULD offend every black person, but, sadly, there was some truth to what Biden said about them politically.
I don't know how we have Biden on a ticket knowing what he's done! Actually, I do know!

the first Black and South Asian American woman to run on a major political party's presidential ticket. Harris was raised by her Indian mother. CNN's Vedika Sud speaks to her extended family in India on how her Indian roots shaped her political views.
I think Biden sniffed her out so we are all good
Kamala and Biden accounts are tweeting ten tweets an hour.  I can't keep up.  Where is everybody on their threads?   They've seemingly hired a social media team, theyre trying to preempt a social media opposition campaign to control the narrative.  We cant let that happen.
Honestly more people needed to know about  . Because this trump / Biden era is sad.
Definitely! And watch and see how they criticize President Biden and Vice President Harris every single day. (You see what I did there? Pres. Biden and VP Harris!!! It sounds wonderful and Peaceful).
Here we go folks! Ready for the birther conspiracies? Knew this was coming on the day Biden announced she was his VP pick. Trump does re-cycle... üôÑ
then one cannot in good conscience vote for Trump or Biden
Well, they can't go with the "Biden hates cops" route üòÇ
I also hate her for making me want to defend Biden campaign staff
He wants to have those press conferences every day and now that Biden has announced his VP it gives Trump something to turn his attention to. He needs to be challenged every damn day and he needs to not get away with his nonsense. Enough is enough.
So explain how Reparations went from virtual obscurity to part of the national debate, precipitating a congressional hearing and forcing the candidates to produce (albeit inadequate) BLK exonomic agendas... INCLUDING Biden.  No PACs.  No lobbyists.  How?
‚Å¶ reaction to  ‚Å¶ saying that Biden‚Äôs odds are same as Hillary‚Äôs on election night is my 2020 #spiritAnimal
- is it not blatent racism for someone to discriminate in saying they wont even interview any males or asians or male whites or hispanics to be Vice President as Joe Biden just did? Would Violate Title VII if any other employer did so. Are you going to call out Biden?
I meant to say; I‚Äôm pretty SURE... President Biden...
Thought you were running against Biden
Stare down Biden like an episode of DBZ
Seriously-your nominee Biden just openly discriminated against millions of Americans in making it clear he would only consider a woman &amp; then lean toward African American women-not Asian, Hispanic or any males,even if more qualified.That is the very definition of racism-Title VII
I saw how the DNC and the media played thier dirty tricks to give us Biden. I watched every single debate. I watched all the analysis. I saw the framing of questions and the manufacturing of consent. Everyone should be concerned.
Maybe the unemployed cops will volunteer to go out and enforce the mask mandate. I hope Biden doesn't see this, he make it part of his plan
Who needs an investigation to uncover this - Biden just openly  discriminated against the very same people in deciding on who to consider for his VP nominee. Blatent race (and gender) discrimination which would be a slam dunk law suit if it was for any other govt position
Ain't nobody said, let's get Biden/Harris in office and call it a day. From day one, we keep fucking working and pushing. And if a less shitty cabinet can save some lives, then bet I'm picking them over the current one purposely screwing over &amp; killing thousands on their watch.
No leverage?  Blk voters have immense leverage and there is already a critical mass of BLK ppl that oppose this ticket.  Biden needs Obama numbers, nearly unanimous support to win.  He hasn't got that and he needs it. Thats partly why he chose Harris.  Thats the leverage.
Are we talking about Trump or Biden?
He‚Äôll be 75 years old in 2024 (younger than Biden is now but I think voters are going to be over Boomers/senescence in the next cycle).  Also voted with most of the other Big 10 presidents to postpone football, how‚Äôs that going to play in the GOP primary (only half joking).
The first one is so way off. Of course he knowingly said false things...every single day. He is the most dishonest President in history and it‚Äôs not even close. If Biden became President would the stock market crash? No. Was the unemployment rate under Obama 42% when was 5%? No
Enjoy the cartoons, particularly the one from the buffalo news. (Prince's "Baby, I'm a Star" fits the VP selection.) #KamalaHarrisVP
A vote for Trump sounds like a vote for Trump.  Until Biden puts a real economic agenda, up to and including Reparations on the table, the overwhelming blk support needed to win is void.  Harris being a BLK woman is irrelevant. Her VP aspirations are not Reparations.

All the left wing black radio shows are already pushing the "If you don't support the Biden/Kamala ticket you hate black women" narrative üòÇü§£
*exceptions may apply if the women accuse Biden of sexual misconduct*
Weird how it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwomen lift each other up‚Äù when women came forward to say that they were sexually harassed/assaulted by Biden ü§î

Wow! so what was Biden‚Äôs excuse at their very first outing to get her?!? C‚Äôom on man keep it real!
Sorry Joe Biden is never going to be president and he hasn't a clue what science is. Don't quit your Senate job Kamala.
I‚Äôm not voting for Biden Harris . No way.
Like you do know she fully supports Biden, right? And that she never went after Biden the entire primary?
I don't know about you, but I needed a good laugh, and  didn't disappoint. #TrumpsTVLawyer #CousinFucker  #Disgrace #Traitor
Good question. Even if Biden wins this is far from over‚Ä¶
We can not be complacent- the media is going to pick this statement up and run with it- and most apolitical ppl will take it as true. Not sure how we can reach ppl.  It seems that Biden/Harris will just make speeches and send out statements that are blatant lies.
You keep highlighting why she's right. You're going to vote Biden/Harris at this rate.
Biden crime bill plus racist remarks while in the senate. Harris is a corrupt prosecutor. You have no clue on fascism and you have a P.S. degree lol. Bet you never stepped foot in a fascist country. If you did you wouldn't call Trump that at all.
Has anyone noticed that  has 10 times the following of Kamala/Biden combined and gets less then half the likes on his tweets? Democrats are not only asking you to suspend belief in history but statistics as well.
It only related to the difference between saying, ‚ÄúThe candidates spoke cleary and effectively and humanely and with vision‚Äù and ‚ÄúBiden looked like a father at his daughter‚Äôs wedding.‚Äù
I hope  Will no longer live in the U.S. when all is said &amp; done, or acknowledge this was Native American land before massacring them for it would #MAGA  You can‚Äôt sell the narrative a former defense lawyer (Biden) &amp; former prosecutor (Kamala) will destroy America ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
FTR I wouldn‚Äôt pay a freaking dime to see an egotist who could do with a dose of reality-enjoy voting for your racist pals, the 2 of them put more people behind bars while  has put a stop to Biden‚Äôs draconian ‚Äò94 crime bill &amp; done more for people of color than BLM
How about the ‚Äúdeal‚Äù made by the Obama/Biden administration to release 5 Taliban members + give the Taliban money for the single deserter Bergdahl who is a national disgrace
Hillary didn‚Äôt misspeak, she wasn‚Äôt slow with her talking points and she didn‚Äôt refuse to answer the question, ‚Äúwill you run for re-election?‚Äù It‚Äôs clear to see the cognitive decline in Biden from a non-bias point of view.
She has no choice but to go on record and say "I don't feel good about it"  what the DNC is doing is pandering when she is just as Racist as Biden is.
Imma still vote for Biden but I don‚Äôt feel good about it at all
Mike Bloomberg to speak at DNC as Democrats wonder whether he will spend big for Biden
Do you think Kamala will change Joe Biden‚Äôs mind on some issues?
You think kamala and Biden wouldn't want a deal made?
I thought democrats hate old white men.  Is Kamala going to cancel old white men?  Will she start with Biden?
Sanders, keep dreaming if you think that the democrats are going to beat Trump come Nov. Not going to happen, especially with Harris on the ticket with Biden. Biden gave Trump an early Xmas gift by picking Harris as his running mate.
"Black women saw in Biden the answer to Trump that the country desperately needs; by choosing Harris as his running mate, Biden has shown he recognizes that we are a critical part of that answer, too."
Harris, your a delusional person, if you believe that Obama and Biden straighten the economy before they left office. A complete fabrication.
Im so sick of this CIRCUS. CAN'T WAIT FOR NOVEMBER SO I CAN VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN AND HELP GET THIS ORANGE STAIN OFF OF AMERICA
She must look like Mom (thank goodness for her)! Good choice - Biden/Harris!
Oh, come on!  Note to  and #maga followers: listen to what Biden/Harris say, not the fevered lies of Fox/Cheney. I think you will like what they stand for.   #GOPBetrayedAmerica

I'm late in watching, but Biden &amp; Harris üò•üíúüëè Yes ma'am bridged it all together. Her parents coming for education &amp; participating in the Civil Rights Mvmt.  Joe saying they're both part of the American story. #JoeMala (yeah I know it might be corny but hey) #BidenHarris2020
The world's laughing Now, Donny. And it Ain't at Biden. Get a clue. Hey.. why isn't anyone monitoring this guy over at the White House? Or does he do his Tweeting from the, seemingly, hours long visits to his "Throne Room "?
6/10 Americans believe Biden won‚Äôt finish his first term. His VP pick Kamala is ranked the 4th most radical Dem in Congress. Bernie was the runner up in this years primary. All the signs indicate that the party is moving towards socialism.
I keep seeing people with 'communist' and 'socialist' making the same old, simplistic, boring utilitarian arguments about Biden. We've been so brainwashed with 'voting' that it destroys any thinking that goes deeper than that.
yeah, I think he pushed people farther left, and his run made people farther left, but I've heard people say that, and it just doesn't make any sense unless you're talking about what's possible with electoralism. If Biden is now the 'farthest left,' than you can't go farther.
Now you're trying to flip it as if your intent was to facilitate some kind.of educational Jane Elliot moment.  Let's be clear, you posted that BS as a way of saying if you dont vote for Biden and Harris, you aint BLK.  The irony is breathtaking. That image is YOU.
'the Communists for Biden/Harris' thing in my bio was supposed to be a joke, but now I'm seeing that it's real.
there's a real idea that you can't go farther left than Bernie, but what does that mean? he's back to just being a senator, and he's not my senator. If it's a presidential candidate, then you can't be farther left than Biden, and that's what capitalist democracy's doing now.
You just described yourself.    You have no logical substantive explanation as to why BLK ppl should vote for Biden/Harris other than removing Trump. You'd gladly give away your endorsement while Blk citizens get nothing. You need to apply the mammy sambo illustration to yourself
That should count as an in-kind contribution to the Biden campaign.
It's probably the right move until Biden/Harris fix this COVID-19 mess! This lard-ass clown won't provide the leadership! Onward!

I‚Äôll vote Biden pray he slows down the pandemic and has a right answer. Then I will work to improve the current system. Shit I‚Äôll even join the Green Party.
I‚Äôm a bit confused on this tweet lol. I‚Äôm just anti-trump 100% &amp; although kamala and Biden aren‚Äôt the ideal candidates, we‚Äôve already seen what horrible things Trump has done and is capable of, I just can‚Äôt take another 4 years of his nonsense tbh
I agree. You not even saying anything bad rn. But it‚Äôs just I was traumatized about the covid situation that occurred. I work in a hospital (essential employee) the stuff I seen I don‚Äôt want to see or experience again. I‚Äôm afraid and the only answer they gave us is Biden so...
‚ÄúEven tho I don‚Äôt like him or agree w him, I will be voting for the racist rapist only to get the racist rapist out of office‚Äù is basically all I read when people talk about voting for Biden /Trump

#KamalaHarris says Trump economic policies ran the country into the ground. Complete lie. Trumps policies delivered far more especially to underprivileged and minorities than the anemic Obama/Biden policies of 8 yrs.

Mrs. Harris, I do not know too much about you but for that 30mins on TV with Mr. Biden your words were very powerful. Now Trump is saying you should not be running because you are a African-American. Is Donald Trump scared because he finally met his match?
The squad hates Biden and the vast majority of democratic voters. With the exception of Rep Pressley, they hate Biden and Harris and will actively work against him. They have absolutely no place at the convention.
This piece is tone deaf. She is a first term congresswoman who actively campaigned against, and still overtly disdains the nominee overwhelmingly chosen by democratic voters. She has said her and Biden shouldn't be in the same party. I am pissed she even has a 60 second spot.

Which still makes him better equipped than Trump. Everything you said about Joe just now could be applied tenfold to Trump. Even if Biden is around for just one term, I don't care. Trump has failed at every turn, and that's a simple fact. One any sane human being should recognize
It's a shame...I was hoping to have an intelligent discussion. Is Biden perfect? No, not at all. But when you look at him and you look at Trump, it's clear that Biden, even with his supposed cognitive issues, is the far better choice for POTUS. No reply needed. Good day, sir.

Stop with all the Biden tweets!
The only thing that will collapse when Biden wins will be the air mattress you're squatting on in the Lincoln bedroom, as you refuse to leave the WH after your historic loss in November!
Fact is, a Biden win will lead to many cheering voices, that the nightmare is finally over. But the entire leftist coalition knows that the nightmare just keeps getting worse, going beyond any President.  I guess, deep down, I just don't want us to lose that anger. It's useful.
... and a Trump-Pence ticket should be a great concern to all witches.
If, as she did earlier this year, still supports Medicare For All, I can get behind her and hope she can be pushed left on other things.  Considering Biden's mental state she is the more important candidate.
By voting for Biden you are voting against Andrew Yang. I also never said I was protest voring for anyone. I'm refuting your faulty manipulation technique.
You didn't send me a wikipedia link but okay lol second, that's not a vote for the other guy. It's just not a vote for YOUR guy. I'm not beholden to the Democrat party and Biden doesn't deserve my vote. If the DNC can't pick a candidate people want to elect, that's their decision

I'm not going to worried about the election Trump will get a second term. Biden has already made a bunch of bunch of galfs that would sink a ship. Then again l worry about the mail ballots.
Whoever he picks for VP will be the president in no time, Joe Biden is fading fast !
Sure they prefer Biden because they will be in his back pocket.
I am familiar with the wackos at TYT. They hate Democrats and are only interested in chaos and dischord, not progress. I know they don't want Biden to begin with and they will work as hard as they can to disrupt the process. They have no business at a Dem convention.
You would rather burn everything down and have Trump again if you don't get your "pure" candidates because everyone who disagrees in the slightest is autu"the enemy". I am glad the Biden campaign did this, it was smart.

‚ÄòSit down‚Äô: Trump buried in mockery and scorn for claiming Biden ‚Äòno longer worthy of the Black Vote‚Äô -
Biden is a puppet. I like the guy, but the DNC is engaging in jeriatric abuse. They are not against guns, as long as they‚Äôre being used to enforce their laws.  The DNC is absolutely against the 2nd amendment, I‚Äôm not sure how that can be argued.
She may be qualified but for the unity of America I really want Biden to pick an African American
And you‚Äôll vote for a guy who openly mocked a disabled reporter on live tv. And where did I say I was a fan of Biden? Sit down fool ü•¥

Do t worry Biden will pardon him.
Trump racist? The only racist remarks I've been seeing are from Biden.
Biden never had affairs or slept with porn stars or hang out with Ebstein and underage girls or prevented blacks! Joe is a decent man who can empathize, make sound decisions and does not embarrass US on daily basis!
Literally no one said anything about voting green or writing in anyone here ‚Äî we‚Äôre just (justifiably) incredibly pissed off.  I can vote Biden while fucking loathing him and the sector of politics he represents ‚Äî just as I did Hillary.

So the  will fire a freelance photographer for posting an offensive meme about Biden/Harris, but still won‚Äôt do shit about China and their crimes against humanity.
Who would score higher on a cognitive test....Mueller or Biden.   Kamala is to Biden as  Weissmann was to Mueller. The puppet and the puppet master.  is an American hero
How confident would you feel about ingesting a pill if I gave you 100 pills and I told you that 27 of them could kill you?  The latest from  says there is a 27% chance that Trump could be re-elected.  We must work for Biden/Harris as if we could die
I thought he might wait for the chance that Biden wins.  The clock would be his friend. The DC courts tend to lean heavy to the left. His lawyers are getting pressure not to disclose info in open court. That is why Trump never pardoned Flynn. They want the FBI garbage in the open
Vote Biden, and then push him like hell to do more of what you want. That might work on Biden. Clearly doesn't work on Trump who just doubles down on what you don't like.
Doesn‚Äôt matter. Massive showing of green is just symbolic at this point. At least Biden/Harris will respond to political pressure unlike trump. The populace won‚Äôt go back to the sleepy days of Obama. B/H isn‚Äôt the worst thing if we keep applying pressure and electing progressives
And we begin... racist tarks from scared white men...
I don't know how we have Biden on a ticket knowing what he's done! Actually, I do know!
If this is actually how coherent joe Biden is, then I want him pushing for the debates
I think Biden sniffed her out so we are all good
I never received 20% of my earnings taxed, and $6000 more in deductions while Obama and Biden were in an office. You tell lies. If you don‚Äôt believe me, I can let you talk to my tax consultant. I‚Äôm an independent contractor.
Maybe the unemployed cops will volunteer to go out and enforce the mask mandate. I hope Biden doesn't see this, he make it part of his plan
The first one is so way off. Of course he knowingly said false things...every single day. He is the most dishonest President in history and it‚Äôs not even close. If Biden became President would the stock market crash? No. Was the unemployment rate under Obama 42% when was 5%? No
But we not excluding other celebs. We just focusing on Trump n Biden rn cause the evidence against them is insane.
and he's not involved in golden showers...score one for Biden
Biden will kill god
They're still pissed that Bernie got crushed. Trashing Kamala is just an excuse. They weren't going to vote for Biden anyway.

#KamalaHarris says Trump economic policies ran the country into the ground. Complete lie. Trumps policies delivered far more especially to underprivileged and minorities than the anemic Obama/Biden policies of 8 yrs.
i too am not the biggest fan of biden but like he‚Äôs all we got so let‚Äôs hold him accountable and let em know that he needs to be b e t t e r
hi maybe instead of hating on biden ad miss kamala we can push them, FORCE THEM to be better for this country. they will win simply by being the lesser of two evils so we might as well let em know that they ain‚Äôt getting off easy!
Are you voting for Biden for any other reason than ‚ÄúI wanna get X out of office‚Äù? Of course you don‚Äôt because Biden doesn‚Äôt stand for anything. It‚Äôs just the same neoliberal policies that got Trump elected in the first place. We need to have better candidates come 2024

Ironic given Biden‚Äôs record
1. Biden will likely have his share of gaffes. 2. Trump said that about Biden to misdirect from his own "dementia" &amp; often accuses others of his own stuff (i.e. corruption and lies). 3. As they say in boxing, styles make fights. She had skills in the primary debates.
I live in the suburbs. I'm a wife. I'm white. I'm voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. There are a lot of other people like me doing the same thing. Why? Because this is 2020, not 1957.
Biden could do that, you could never, and on the other hand, you are demonstrating that Biden is for the real people and you are part of the so called elite.

Biden just gave the best speech of his career. People are so busy projecting Trump's mental flaws onto  that they forgot he's sharp and eloquent, especially by comparison.
Biden and Harris would do as much gun control as possible while starting a race war. A continued Trump presidency gives Americans more time to stack ammo and food, but still ends up in the same mess.
I knew this would happen when Biden didn‚Äôt pick you for VP
i just read somewhere that joe biden has dementia LMAOOO on top of all the other bullshit how u gon vote for somebody who can‚Äôt remember shit
Just tell her Warren should be the next Senate Majority Leader to enact the legislative reforms the Biden Harris team are going to run on. It's arguably a more important role than VP.
I‚Äôm 99% sure this tweet was written some times ago, with blanks where the name appears...Biden announces...fill in blanks...tweet away.

No need to debate with an idiot criminal. Biden should refuse any debate. We will still vote for him
He‚Äôs under the misapprehension that Harris was added to appeal to African Americans, she‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt.  Her appeal is to women in the suburbs.  Biden himself, with full throated work from the Obamas and Bill Clinton, already does and will continue to appeal to African Americans.
Thank God, that Cardinal Joe Tobin is around.  Don't need this idiot up in Providence preaching against Biden while supporting Trump.
Who‚Äôs gonna vote for West? Trumpists are so stupid and confuse that they will vote for him thinking that it is Trump‚Äôs instruction. West will only take Trump‚Äôs votes not Biden‚Äôs.
Nope. Because if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, you ai black
Literally nothing you post will make me think your father is a better suited president than Biden. Just stop, it‚Äôs hypocritical
Its almost repetitive now. A Biden ticket, a Trump ticket....anyone ticket, no matter the party will never abandon or neglect the Israeli Lobby. Ever. It will never happen. Yet people will still believe that voting is going to make significant changes.
Biden was a cop?
At least Kamala didn't need to sell her soul, like you did for Dear Leader. I saw your soul leave your eyes on the Swamp when your bill didn't pass. Both Biden &amp; Harris are as anti corruption as u once pretended to be.
Regardless of his choice, Biden is still senile and feeble.
Trump's story could happen anywhere in the world. Inherit a ton of money, use chummy connections with the rich and powerful, spin a web of lies, corruption, TV, and demagoguery to seize power.  But the Biden-Harris ticket is the living embodiment of the American Dream.  #VOTE
Joe biden will take social security away.
remember when trump said to Chris Wallace on national television that Biden wanted to defund the police? lol

That's it! The alternative to Biden/Harris is not a perfect president/VP slate you agree with 100%. The alternative is four more years of Trump et al.
Joe Biden is Catholic.  Maybe instead of showing your bias and clowning yourself with ignorant tweets, you could use that phone you're holding to do some basic research, Bishop.

I agree, this isn‚Äôt a celebration of a victory at all. I would rather have anyone right now in the office than this current administration. Biden and Harris isn‚Äôt even a great choice, but what is our best chance? You think writing the name of your candidate would make a change?

So agree with this.  The fact that we have a Black woman on the ticket is epic and picked by an old white man nonetheless!  Go Biden/Harris
She locked up more black men than anyone other than Biden
Why praise a black women who put more black people in jail than anyone other than Biden?
Seriously? You're gonna call Biden racist? We have the grand wizard of blatant, violent racism defiling the Oval office, and you're trying to call Biden racist? Seriously, what is wrong with this picture??? üôÑ
If Biden wanted a black woman, he should‚Äôve chosen Nina Turner
A chronology of the Kamala Harris as VP announcement on my feed today: YAY! YAY! YAY!--Ugh, what an awful choice--remember what she said about Biden at the debates?--sexually repugnant memes--She's going to run the show, not Biden--she's mean.   And it's not even been a full day.
Joe Biden working with Kamala shows that he can compromise, forgive and build a better company.
She specifically said ‚ÄúVice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist‚Äù.
If Trump wins, the right keeps "trusting the plan." If  Biden wins the country is definitely worse off, but at least our side will KNOW nobody's coming to save them.
Congratulation Senator K Harris on your selection as Biden VP . I am extremely happy  and excited about our future with you in office. Our real work stars now , we will succeed,  united‚Ä¶
yeah that would be ideal. She's on record calling biden a segregationist and saying she believes his sexual assault accusers and still got picked so I don't think she feels terribly beholden to the public.
wrt supporting the green new deal and spearheading covid relief stimulus. She's definitely trying to have a better record but the main concern is once she has power there's little faith she + biden will change much fundamentally. Harris doesn't make it much worse, it just sucks
I‚Äôm sad that in what feels like a sea of progressivism in the Democratic Party, centrists are always the lifeboat everyone thinks will get elected. Happy to vote for Biden/Harris, but damn are they really the leftist counterpart to Trump?
Trump says Kamala Harris 'nasty' and 'disrespectful' to Joe Biden, surprised by VP pick  via  that means Pence will be eviscerated by her
Agreed! And, I'm registered Republican! Biden/Harris #1! It should be a landslide! I hope tRump &amp; the GOP are under it too! Stay hydrated!
and the voters didn‚Äôt pick biden at polls, the democratic party did it with backroom deals and media manipulation. the game is rigged
Im pretty sure Joe Biden just shit on my neighbors lawn.

He can't even serve one term!!! He is so controlled by the socialist party!!! and Karmala  only had 3% when she ran for president!! Plus most Americans don't like socialism and don't like that fact that both Biden and Karmala did not say one word on the lawlessness and anarchy!!

So you are saying as Vice President of the United States there was no action Biden and Obama could‚Äôve taken for 8 years as the post office lost billions? The highest offices in our government were helpless even with a democrat legislative majority? Please stop.
When was BIDEN VP again? How does this change what I said. They still lost close to 100 billion in his 8 years. Even if you take off the pension cost from last year the post office lost 3.8 billion. Supply link for your claim please.
Already they are trying to deny, deny ! Schiff &amp; Biden wouldn't even be talking about the investigation if there was nothing there ! I guess they "as usual" must try to take the focus off themselves &amp; put on Trump ! Biden did some bad things &amp; he will never be POTUS !

Wow that means a lotüòù she's an ex cop that put in jail more black Americans 12 times more than whites she also said that she believes Biden's accusers but did nothing!!
Only now the dems are interested. 8 years Biden was VP they lost close too 100 billion. I am ok with mail in ballots. What is not ok is that there is no structure or system out in place for the number of ballots they will get. The USPS is NOT part of our democracy.
How long before Hunter Biden and Kamala hook up.
"Fox News medical contributor " Oxymoron or just moronic?  THIS right here claiming no science behind mask mandate.  Playing Russian Roulette.
Politics  of division and taxing will hurt our communities. Together with innovative approaches that give people choice that stimulate rather then stagnate our local economy we can all unite. Say no to tax and divide politics #congress #NY04 #douglastuman
Mother says she‚Äôs not gonna let Joe Biden cut his meat. She likes to cut it into little bite-sized pieces so he doesn‚Äôt choke
I also never said I wasn‚Äôt voting for Biden...
It would be accurate if Biden had shown even remote interest in what the left actually wants. If instead ignoring the majority of AMERICANS let alone Dems he supported M4A. He has come out agains the very foundations the true left stands for.
Harris is now the VP candidate and is now open for her flip flopping-! Her weak 3% presidential run as prosecutor she locked up black Americans 12 times more than others  and the fact that she said that she believed Biden's accusers!! üí• mail in voting is plagued with fraud!!üòù
Stunning how for the 8 years when BIDEN was VP the post office lost close to 100 billion and not one democrat himself included cared. Now they claim it is needed for our democracy? Since when? Wasn‚Äôt created for that and can‚Äôt be broken up at any time.
So is it about medicine or Democracy? Did the usps get more important for some reason this year then the 8 it lost close to 100 billion when BIDEN was VP?
What great "leader" do you know that has to force his or her flowers to do something? A mandate isn't leadership.   Everyone should wear masks. A leader would convince them to wear masks. Neither #biden nor #trump is a leader in that sense
How about Biden??? He‚Äôs been there for 40 years
Biden is uninspiring.  His campaign is built on fear and not hope.  His saving grace is that his administration is not trying to undermine the social safety nets and basic systems that keep the country functional
If you want to tear the country down, Trump is your guy.  Just know that you might not be where you want to be on the other side of it.  If you think the country is salvageable, Biden‚Äôs your guy.  But he is in no way a revolutionary.
Biden could easily be framed as a Republican based on his record.  But Trump is not even a Republican.  Trump‚Äôs whole playbook is deregulation with a head start for his circle so they can cash in.
Biden won‚Äôt even take questions and Trump gets this kind of disrespect !!
If it is the last breath I have in my body, I will be voting for Biden/Harris on November 3rd. I have a back problem &amp; can‚Äôt stand for more than 5 - 10 minutes. I WILL STAND, KNEEL, CRAWL OR WHATEVER on November 3rd. Hopefully the rest of my NY family will do the same.

I wonder if #biden chose #KamalaHarris  because she smelled the best when he sniffed her. Although Harris may be too old for his tastes
Was this the mantra during the 8 years Obama - Biden were in office as they lost close to 100 billion? Or is it the mantra now that you want something from them?
Of course it was. Anything positive you can relate to the Obama Biden admin anything gnegatuve trump just didn‚Äôt listen.
Could you please let Marie know that its not up to Joe Biden !! Is she serious saying Joe wants a mandate on wearing masks but he's going to leave it up to each state ? Really, I guess he thinks he's the President now ?

Yeah but other things in the world matter besides just Donald bad. Meidas, Lincoln Project, etc do not care &amp; focus only on Donald bad as shown in this tweet. Unfortunately and begrudgingly I‚Äôll be voting for Biden. Nothing to do with the stupid nonstop ads Meidas or Lincoln make
I‚Äôm worried that Trumpsters are now intentionally undermining these polls, so as to give the impression that turnout for Biden supporters is not as critical as it is. Eye on the prize!

do you think Biden will ever post another tweet that doesn‚Äôt mention Kamala and how incredible she is? It‚Äôs already so stale
Judge please start hammering Mr.Biden‚Äôs stamina !!!!!
Saying both sides are evil and having concerns with each isn‚Äôt promoting a third party. I will vote blue to vote fascism out, I just won‚Äôt be happy at all about it. Doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt legit criticisms to be made for Biden/Harris and all neoliberals.

I was, and am, a big Sanders/Warren supporter. Biden &amp; Harris aren't my dream ticket. It doesn't matter. Trump is a Fascist narcissistic ignoramus who has already run roughshod over our democratic republic. We do not have the luxury of sitting this one out. I mean, really!.....
A Catholic that supports abortion is not a Catholic they are not even Christian hence Joe Biden. #JoeBiden #JoeBiden2020
Sure I get your point of people‚Äôs beliefs evolving and shifting. Problem is those laws along with others created the criminal justice system we have today. Likewise, Biden‚Äôs remarks are still racially charged, so it‚Äôs hard to see that he has evolved in his belief system today.
It's amazing to me how much "steam" this narrative is getting. Not to mention how transparent what's going on here is. My guess is anyone backing Kanye wasn't voting Biden no matter what.
PLEASE don‚Äôt vote 4 Biden n Harris
What racist mantra? You realize the Biden actual words right! You realize his running mate called him a racist. But yes it‚Äôs my mantra. Ignore his history. Please tell me what your racist Trump did to the  black community?
Maybe if Biden and his team are concerned about Stein voters they should consider a few substantive policy concessions that would get them on board

You should have to earn the people‚Äôs votes, not be shamed into voting for you. We must beat 45, but as soon as Biden wins, the protests must start DAY 1!! I‚Äôm seeing people ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù this ticket. They better be willing to vocally criticize them and demand for more out of them

Ok then. Guess you win. Policy doesn‚Äôt matter to anyone anymore. I hope you‚Äôre not a protestor &amp; don‚Äôt know any because under a Biden-Harris presidency they would be seeing the same resistance as they have under 45. But Biden will... tweet less?
Right and my point is because 45 is abhorrent and incompetent or whatever disparaging word you would like to use... it doesn‚Äôt make Biden a good candidate. It doesn‚Äôt mean Biden-Harris will change anything.
Oh snap!!! You got him!!! Nice job man! Biden would spell Booker‚Äôs name right the first time! Best POTUS nominee ever!
How many people do you reckon would be dead with Biden as president during this global pandemic?
What in the world are we expecting to change if Biden takes over? Less tweets? More ‚Äúprofessionalism‚Äù? Nothing of substance that will help disenfranchised people. No M4A means the last four months under Biden would‚Äôve looked similar to 45‚Äôs rule.
biden is senile, they know it, and they wont let him debate.  People should be chanting Biden is Senile at Rallies and if you somehow get your door knocked by his non-existent ground game you should repeat that phrase until they leave.  #BidenIsSenile

This AND, when have we ever had perfect pres candidates AND did you really think it was going to happen *this* time? Stop whining and keep working because refusing to vote for Biden solves nothing and helps no one but you.
Wish Biden would have chosen you for VP
Still trying to stay relevant, are ya now, Ari. You don‚Äôt understand, Fuhr√´r 45 is so awful we would have voted for Biden‚Äôs kidney if it were running.
If she exposes the corruption in the Judicial Branch and helps Biden bring integrity and respect for the rule of law she‚Äôll see support from Congress but mostly from the American  people.  The clean up will be satisfying.
Trump couldn't understand w hy Biden selected Harris after she was nasty, because Trump holds a grudge permanently if someone speaks against him. Biden has more maturity and depth of character and knows how to forgive ‚ù§Ô∏è
How can this be explained?....Joe help write 3 notorious bills with Thurmond: ‚Äò84 comprehensive crime control bill, ‚Äò86 crack-cocaine bill, and ‚Äò94 crime bill. I guess that‚Äôs what friends are for? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
What change and progress is Biden about
I am voting Biden. People are too comfortable. Biden will wake the lazy ass genX and boomers up. Another 4 years of Trump would just be another 4 years of cope as Israel further takes over.
I want a racist president. I will vote Biden.
Nope. Voting for Biden. Guess that zero tolerance for misogyny policy of yours isn‚Äôt exactly true is it
We‚Äôve said we‚Äôre gonna vote for Biden, even though we think he‚Äôs terrible. What more do you want
Look up the crime bill of 94, the crack-cocaine bill of 86, and the comprehensive crime control bill of 84. All authored by Biden along with Thurmond a known segregationist...Look up Kamala‚Äôs record as a prosecutor.  Then ask yourself who did more to hurt minority communities? ü§î
Is criticizing candidates you‚Äôre gonna vote for allowed or do we have to pretend Biden is perfect
Biden opposes everything the left wants and you really can‚Äôt wrap your head around why the left doesn‚Äôt support Biden with enthusiasm and no criticism?
So any criticism of Biden is out of bounds?

Biden is a horrendous candidate whose only redeeming quality is he isn‚Äôt Trump. Not wanting to cut social security, bail out Wall Street, or start sham wars is a Trump thing now? Healthcare for poor people and student debt relief too?
It‚Äôs always about Trump. It wasn‚Äôt rice because rice wouldn‚Äôt tow the party line no questions asked. She doesn‚Äôt help Biden. She may actually hurt with black males.

FLASHBACK: Kamala Harris Said She Believes Women Who Accused Joe Biden of Sexual MisconductYou told the people of #NY22 you wouldn‚Äôt support Pelosi, but by voting for Biden instead of her opponent, Pelosi needed one less vote to win. That means voting for Biden had the same impact on the outcome as if you voted for her. That‚Äôs BS.
I did extensive research on Malcolm X for a class last year. He was pretty clear that he despised people like Biden for their lack of honesty. There's not any way of reinterpreting it. He didn't die with this position, but it was a large part of his Black Nationalist Ideology.
The mental gymnastics are impressive here. Truly Olympic level. 86% of Dem voters and nearly 70% overall support Medicare for All. Biden said he would veto it. What left coalition is he part of when he can't even take what can only be described as a mainstream position like M4A?
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
The fact remains that Biden is and has always been a corrupt neoliberal. The best possible case you can make for him is that while he is ultimately not the preferred option and is largely bough and paid for by the oligarchs, hes more prone to public pressure than Trump would be.
Man you people really are delusional. Im not trying to be rude, but if you think Biden is some kind of covert lefty who is just trying to 3D chess his way into a real progressive future, were not living in the same reality.
Honestly, it depends on how hard right Biden pivots. If he, like im guessing he will, pivots to basically Bush Era conservative and continues to attack the left, my vote is going elsewhere if I even vote at all.
#SaveTheUSPS Protect mail-in ballots against those bent on sabotaging the elections!
Aren't there laws against this? If he goes ahead and dies this, we should hold a rally in Washington, DC that same day for Biden.
If Kamala Harris is suddenly so bloody wonderful- why didn't the DNC nominate her for their POTUS choice? IMO- they need White male Biden as the placeholder, to then enact the 23rd Amendment. If not that- then Biden will at most be a puppet of the Squad, BLM, and Pelosi-types.
It‚Äôs astounding. Biden has always been a buffoon.

It's fantastic news that Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris! They will be an awesome team!

Oh the retweet as if you've done anything more than mental gymnastics for why wall street prefers biden. It could have to do with him saying "nothing would fundamentally change" for them if he was president. Yea. Its about wanting their taxes raised.
People keep saying that but never point to specific policies that actually make that point valid. Its just a media talking point, bud. Wall Street is ecstatic about a Biden Harris ticket. I dont recall them being excited when it looked like Bernie was going to take it
What issues that poll above 50% in the Democratic Party voter polls does Biden support? Please, I'll wait..
Progressives don't bathe in superpac and wall street cash. Thats literally the bare minimum. And there's GND, M4A, cancelling student debt, tuition free higher education and trades. None supported by Biden. You can keep the word liberal but stay away from progressive.
should decline and state specifically why. This is a slap in the face to the people who have backed Biden despite all of their objections. And were supposed to be excited in November that Biden has an open ear?
I bet Kasich will get enough time to whitewash his anti union pro forced birth record in support of Biden...
Ha, ha, ha, ha, keep trying trumpy, but it aib't going to work. Not just dems but Republican women and men are going to vote for Biden to end your tenure.  You can try every gimmick but it just makes it worst. You have become a loser.
Every American who plans on continuing to support Trump should watch this repeatedly every time he tries to scare us about what the country would look like under a Biden/Harris administration. This is what the country looks like NOW. Scared yet? #NothingHasChanged #FireTrump

Who is Kamala Harris? A look at Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate
Biden is the Trump of 2020 when it comes to the opposition preferring to run against them. Better hope they were also wrong about being able to beat him unlike the DNC with Hillary.
maybe it wasnt a good idea to allow war criminals into the "resistance" and Dems are morons for praising him and the rest in the first place. Not to meniton, what he's saying is correct. They much preferred Biden with how weak he is. I bet a good deal of these guy turn before Nov
Kamala attempting to incarcerate poor people for truancy violations while allowing Steve Mnuchin off without even a fine for ripping off the entire state of ca. Biden's support and complicity in the Iraq war? Biden's bankruptcy bill that screwed a generation of students?
Do we have to discuss Kamala withholding evidence that would have exonerated a death row inmate. Or Biden writing the Crime Bill and Patriot act? His recent comments about black ppl? His response to BLM being inflate police budgets? His support of the Hyde Amdnt until last year?
I don't want to debate you. I don't actually care what you think at all because i'm not interested in navel gazing. Biden supports keeping MJ an illegal substance and puffing police budgets so all of your speculation is meaningless.
Apathy is going to lose Dems the election quicker than anything else. Democrats need to push a better platform People don't vote against things they vote for things. If enough peopel aren't convinced their lives are going to improve with Biden they wont show up. Votes are earned.
OK- Hannity just asked/remarked "how fast he (Trump) had a reply Tweet for the Biden-Harris news", and did he know ahead of time? Trump laughed, paused, said "we have some good people here". Just like Biden I highly doubt that 1/2 of Trump's Tweets are actually his. Others
‚ÄúShe basically called him [Joe Biden] a racist,‚Äù Trump on Kamala Harris.
Who are they appealing to with this pick? People who were already going to vote? This is a clear signal to the left that Biden doesn't give a damn about appealing to them. And it's a cynical use of "Diversity" to deflect criticism by using a WOC as a shield.
Get the excuses ready. When Biden/Harris lose, it will be because the US is misogynistic. We just simply aren't progressive enough as a country  to handle a woman VP. #BidenHarris #BidenVP
This is why Biden picked her. Biden hasn't changed from his old racist ways. He's using a black woman as a shield to deflect criticisms of him under the banner of racism and sexism. You cannot be against the guy who wrote the crime bill and argued for the war on drugs.
At least Biden can read. El Trumpo screws up every script he reads.
....this is why Biden picked Harris....I was wondering who was going to be the first to call someone sexist....good for you...
Well then you need to get on the phone bank for Biden. Every call you dont make for Biden is a call for Trump.
Please. Tell me what substantive ways that Biden presodenct would improve on Trumps current trajectory.... he wrote the crime bill and the patriot act supported the Iraq war supported the coup in Venezuela told his wall street buddies nothing would change...go on...

During the Democratic debates Harris called Biden  basically a Racist and now he is wonderful.  She wants to be President and hopes that Biden is put in a rest home as soon as possible!
Nobody expected Bernie to be picked. Nice strawman. People were looking for some idea that Biden was willing to hear us out and hes priven over and over he won't. He could have picked Barbara Lee and people wouldn't have turned on her. This just makes less lefties likely to vote.
If Biden wins, make him Secretary of Education and that‚Äôs a hell of a cabinet to get a term started.
Do you really think "crime bill" Biden would hand his legacy over to a black woman? He'll fight until his hands won't push his wheelchair. He's using Kamala to be able to accuse people of sexism and racism. Hes an opportunist. His world diversity is a tactic not means of progress
Is Donna Brazile going to leak the debate questions to Biden and Harris just like she did for Hillary and got caught. She cannot be trusted on FOX!
"Biden is going to be the most progressive president since FDR"  Watch how hard right this guy moves once the nomination happens. This guy is going to make Bush look like a flower child.  Apathy wins for me this time. Im out.
Joe Biden is responsible for the 94 crime bill that put a whole lotta Black folks in prison. But he chooses Harris and it‚Äôs alllll ok üôÑ Foolish.
Look at Harris jumping up and down hoping Biden goes in a rest home!

Never a better time to rewatch our #2020Tuesday about how Joe Biden will pick as his #VicePresident!
Unwillingness to remove a President after impeachment is categorically different than unwillingness to remove him after losing an election. When Biden and his entourage march into the White House in January, you think the full weight of the military will side with Trump?
Trump: 'Some men are insulted' by Biden choosing female VP
If Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt select  as his running mate I‚Äôm gonna be pissed. #tuesdayvibes #TuesdayThoughts
But they see joe Biden sniffing kids and that‚Äôs their proof of that.
"‚ÄúI think she remains a low-risk pick for him,‚Äù said one source who speaks to Biden. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt have a lot of baggage""  She tried to imprison poor sick people for truancy violations and let one of the largest white collar criminals in history off without so much as a fine....
Biden did say his job was to make sure the Mayor Petes are the future of the Democratic Party..I though that just meant kneecapping the left, but I guess it was literal too.
Trump doesn't know shit. He confuses the second world war with the 1917 pandemic. So stupid. And still never mentions the more than 165,000 dead Americans as if they never existed. The Turnip is losing  and trying to bad mouth Biden won't work. Dumping Trump is all that matters.

Hey New Zealand. How about you take Biden and Trump and We'll take her. I know neither of them are worth the shirt she's wearing, but were desperate and our choices suck. We either get neoliberalism or straight up fascism...
That explains why Jeremy Scahill, Aron Mate and Matt Taibbi are all on there. They all were instrumental in pointing out how Russiagate was an unfounded conspiracy. Other than that, they've also taken the Chomsky tact of "vote Biden and put on the vest after Trump is out". Jesus.
that vote has stipulations. If we allow Biden to continue on the neoliberal track of the last 40 years the next Trump isn't likely to be as incompetent. You lying about him supporting GND or M4A and people not getting it is going to disillusion people and make the case harder
People don't vote because they don't see enough of a difference and avoiding Biden's flaws and not pushing him before and after the election is going to send him in on a mandate he is currently on which is maintaining the status quo. Vote for him, sure. But make sure he knows
Man, this person decides who is progressive like Biden decides who is black....
You literally lied about Biden's aspirations in office as if he was in favor of policies he's clearly on the record to not being. And his medicare "concession" was less than what Hillary offered in 2016. You're being dishonest. Hence K
Biden is compromised on China. voted for Biden for Speaker. Biden and Brindisi are scrambling to cover up their Pro-Chinese Communist Party support.
That was not a reply to you. Piss off. And, Biden wrote the Patriot Act which largely justifies sending government thugs into cities. And Biden will not go for any of that. He's expressed his firm oppostion to both, specifically saying he would veto M4A. you're lying.
Can someone explain to me what these people are for if Noam Chomski is on the list of "bad lefties" hes literally out telling people to suck it up and vote for Biden even though he's shit. Its like they're not even happy with that if it doesn't come with blind allegiance...FOH...
If we don't get change, we're asking for another Trump in four years. And the next Trump might not be so incompetent. Honestly, my vote depends on the futility of the next four years. If I think that things will get better and Biden will move, I will vote. If not, I stay home.
The "process" resulted in Joe Biden being the nominee. To hell with the process. People are done sitting around waiting for elected leaders to do the right thing. Removing Trump is meaningless if people's lives don't improve in the process.
What you Trumpies keep harping on about Biden is of no consequence.  The goal is to get rid of Trump. Period.
No Wrist Corsages, Please
At this point, with this president, Biden could run with anyone. The focus should be on beating down everything trump says and does, day and night. This is a war, and a trump is taking the advantage. Dems have to get moving - NOW.
Get Biden out the basement and off his bicycle  and start shredding Trump for his fiscal policies, ignoring the needs of millions of Americans; but most of all hammer the Turnip on 160,000 dead Americans. No more plans. Hit Trump and his lackies 24/7. He's out of the basement.
"Nothing will fundamentally change" we might move on a few issues, but the authoritarian tendencies exist at the highest levels of both parties. Were basically just electing a blue version of Trump with Biden.
Elect Biden. Win the Senate. Keep the House. End the filibuster. Redo the Census.
Both Presidential candidates seem to be, unfortunately. Biden's seems slightly more progressed, but they both clearly are not as sharp as their former selves when speaking.
You need a powerful Dem who can stand up and recount every Trump transgression and hammer him on it day and night. Then let Biden come in with the solution. No talk about some vast plan. Just plain solutions that will make Americans "proud". Recount T's failures 24/7. Pelosi?
Biden risks alienating young Black voters after race remarks
Trump is trying to steal the election and the USPS is a major part of his plan. It's time for Biden to name his VP and start countering Trumps moves. Precious time is being lost in this process. Biden may be ahead but if votes aren't counted he could lose.
Joe Biden tells  that he has selected his running mate.
Russia Continues Interfering in Election to Try to Help Trump, U.S. Intelligence Says

WOW WOW, Just for the heck of it, I listened on youtube the first debate between then candidate Trump and Hillary and EVERY AMERICAN should watch it. :PRESIDENT TRUMP was correct on everything he said and what he would do, Biden is more is far left than Clinton. WATCH IT!
Typical liberal response...deflect and post an irrelevant article. Figures. Well I'm done here. You haven't made your case and Biden is still a racist for implying black hegemony of thought. Later

It‚Äôs amazing to me because a lot of the Obama (and even Biden in most instances) policies would actually help people in those communities.. and the basketball players have promoted them in many ways.. it‚Äôs incredible.. and to me the best solution is-
And if we do some of the policies that Biden/Obama and most of the bball players are in support of.. we‚Äôd actually be helping to curb these statistics too.. she‚Äôs actually just flat out wrong in her tweet..
Forget Biden, right now we are NOT safe in Donald Trump's America. 160,000 dead and counting. And he shows NO compassion for any of them. He never mentions them, even when pressed, just that he claims to have done more testing than any other country. What an ass. Good riddance.
Lmao bro sometimes I be peeping Trump in interviews and just be wondering if he knows wtf is even goin on. Same with Biden
Lmao facts my guy Trump = Loud evil  Biden = Sneaky links evil. üòÇüòÇ
No. Im not telling anyone how to vote. That was more a joke than a directive. Biden, like Hillary are notorious for their mouths affecting their poll numbers. The idea of them is more appealing to people than they actually are.
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
Whats worse is he was asked about whether he would continue temporary protective status for refugees from Cuba and he didnt want to answer the question. He literally didn't need to say any of it let alone throw black people under the bus to make a garbage point..Biden is Biden...
The only thing Biden is fucking up is his election chances by being out in public with his mouth moving.
Well, it's without my vote. I can overlook a lot of things, but not blatant racism. I was really trying because I hate Trump, but at this point, I'm sitting this out. Biden should step down before the nomination and save us from this nightmarish situation.
He hasn't officially been nominated. If Bernie was in the lead and he said this, every letter in the book would be thrown at him to step down. Biden is a racist. And, he's going to take us down with him if we allow him to continue as the nominee. This isn't going to go away...
And Biden should step down before the nomination process. His advisors aren't the problem. He is. Biden is always going to be Biden.
Joe Biden is planning to use taxpayer money to hold an unholy ceremony to summon Satan to kill all the children in America. DISGUSTING!!

Dude, seriously? With all the racist shit Trump has said you think this will hurt Biden? No. It will not.
Kneel before biden!
And it will be the best vaccine.  Much better than the biden/obama/hillary/soros/gates vaccine
Can someone explain to me why the only time Biden says something coherent and connected, it ends up making me even less likely to vote for him? He never "stutters" when he says he's against Medicare for All or that black people arent diverse minded.
So Biden... Is a better choice?  Crazy Kev.

Joe Biden  in the dugout
If Democrats don't have control of Congress how on earth do you think these socialist agendas are going to pass? For Biden to promise something he can't deliver he would be a bigger liar than Trump.
Biden is better than this guy? well, that's probably his only positive point
Biden was a segregationist in the 70s
Only thing I‚Äôll say about this tweet is you can definitely say Biden is creepy. That‚Äôs established. The rest I‚Äôll agree on to this point.
No, she‚Äôs definitely wrong. New York and California are not voting for the monster. In fact he‚Äôs losing to Biden in every swing state except one where he‚Äôs tied. So it appears that you are the ‚Äúbat-shit-crazy‚Äù ones.
FYI, if Joe Biden becomes president he shouldn't have absolute unilateral power to launch nuclear weapons either.  A lot of shit that is obviously messed up about the presidency right now will still be messed up with a different president, even if it's not as obvious.

So the President has no power. That's what you want? That means Biden would have no power. Or does the word "dismantle" now mean something different to you lunatics just like "defund" means something different in Libloonish?
def!! am just thinking aloud (on twitter?).   am just also afraid of the reactionary candidate that comes after a biden presidency. üòÖ
I understand your trump hate, but Biden ain‚Äôt no different .
Saying that Biden will be better than Trump for people who r suffering is typical white liberal bullshit from someone who knows no one who is suffering. High living in Brooklyn with wealthy parents.
also think there‚Äôs a huge message to be sent to the DNC if young ppl turned out in such record numbers for bernie and then didn‚Äôt for biden
feel like there are def different layers to not liking a candidate! like biden n kamala are frightening. i didn‚Äôt really like bernie bc he is still establishment and pro-israel but i still voted for him. idk if i‚Äôll vote for biden but i think it‚Äôs valid if ppl opt out now

I asked you a question as a Trump supporter about his policies for re-election and you result to asking me a question about Biden. Since you are a Democrat now, I should as you that question.
I will however not play as a fanboy for Biden &amp; Harris. Y‚Äôall both need to convince our base if y‚Äôall want their vote.
So basically just give them a chance? Yea some ppl said the same thing with Trump. Stop silencing ppl for not being ok voting for Biden and Kamala. We‚Äôre not voting for Trump but they‚Äôre not that much better. So no I am not throwing a parade that this woman of color may be the VP
A *possibility* is that they have decided to toss in any chance of an electoral win &amp; plan to saddle the Biden admin. with chaos &amp; obstructionism. Kind of 2009 on steroids. Others among em want a straight up stolen election or civil war-the more panic &amp; demoralization,the better.
YUP, they literally were doing this for ego and appearances.  Biden even said it on the congressional floor that they WERENT doing it because of it being a decent human thing it was to change the narrative of Dems being softüòíüôÑ

U being mislead, absentee voting is much different, it's not the same system and nobody parading for joe biden, doing anything for jim crow joe, keep letting  mislead u. Check out the communications act of 1934.
We have conflicting data
The issue is, will she actually stand her ground, have strong convictions, be able to make her stated progressive policies be things the Biden campaign adopts, so that they can become reality? That's the reassurance progressives are looking for.   And we have not bn getting that
Not according to studies that show tens of millions will not have healthcare because they can‚Äôt afford it under Biden‚Äôs plan
Americans were literally just polled and 70% of them support it, with around 80% of Democrats. Its not a prop, we want people to be able to survive. We want Biden to support a policy that a majority of the American people support and will save countless lives.
So many potential actions are inhibited by Democrats saying we don‚Äôt want to open that Pandora‚Äôs box.  It is possible that Barr will indict Obama, or Biden, or others in his administration. If he Opens the box then it must be no holds barred

The choice is Biden or the guy rounding people up with a secret police force.   Choose wisely.
I'm typically  not, but this is serious shit going on with the USPS.  I've been expecting for the last two years that Trump would do anything to rig the election and will refuse to accept the outcome if it shows a Biden-Harris win.  Plus he has Barr in his corner.

Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi.  Hear this loud and clear.  Just because the Dems have an outstanding ticket they will have zero chance of being elected.  Once Trump gets done with obstructing the vote the tally will be Trump 99%, Biden 1%.  Just like Saddam used to do.

If voting for Biden were the same as voting for Trump, Republicans wouldn't be going out of their way, illegally, to prevent people from voting for Biden.
I was 40 in '94. I can attest to what the climate was like, what white people like me feared, how the rhetoric ran. Biden was kinda mainstream in that. That however, doesn't mean that it was good, wise, or somehow not racist.
Vote for Biden
Yes, i encourage everyone to read through the comments. You will clearly see that the responses to Joyce's vile, disgusting post are organic and authentic. Joyce thinks if she says "Trump and Russia" enough times, ppl will dismiss the overwhelming opposition to Biden/Harris.  No.
From what I've seen it's been a lot of condescending "y'all are too young to understand" takes in defense of the bill that coulda just never been tweeted while folks are critiquing Biden.
If folks woulda sat there, and ate their food, and let Joe Biden get the licks he deserves, wouldn't be no "the crack era wasn't even that bad" takes.  But, here we are. . .
Vote Biden, and then push him like hell to do more of what you want. That might work on Biden. Clearly doesn't work on Trump who just doubles down on what you don't like.
Best words? üòÇüòÇüòÇAnd Trump makes fun of Biden!

Hmmm.  Why would not-a-Freshmen Deleware Rep Rochester have a  large speaking role at a convention nominating former Delaware Senator Joe Biden? Does she have any strong professional connections to him? Have they worked together at all recently on any large projects?
When Biden announced Harris as his pick. Covid-19 took the lives of 1,450 in the US that one day. Trump owns this failure. We are a pariah nation, shunned and pitied, unable to travel outside our borders, prisoners of his fatal malfeasance.

I know there are worse things about this "cartoon" but ... I find the idea of Biden saying "go for a lie down*" inherently hilarious, because to me that means he's talking with a north London accent and now I'm just imagining that all the time.
I like kids jumping on my lap said, Biden while looking at the kid says and I love kids jumping on my lap. That sounds too creepy.
Up until now I have been pleasantly surprised with Biden‚Äôs campaign, but the DNC speaker lineup is disapointing. If Biden wants to send a message about promoting unity then the speakers at the DNC should include more speakers who truly represent all parts of the party.
His dementia sometimes forces some honesty. Most democrats DO believe that all blacks think the same and that any that don't vote democrat are not really black. This SHOULD offend every black person, but, sadly, there was some truth to what Biden said about them politically.
Will this get all the white Etsy women to vote for Biden instead?

I think Biden sniffed her out so we are all good
Kamala and Biden accounts are tweeting ten tweets an hour.  I can't keep up.  Where is everybody on their threads?   They've seemingly hired a social media team, theyre trying to preempt a social media opposition campaign to control the narrative.  We cant let that happen.
Definitely! And watch and see how they criticize President Biden and Vice President Harris every single day. (You see what I did there? Pres. Biden and VP Harris!!! It sounds wonderful and Peaceful).
Here we go folks! Ready for the birther conspiracies? Knew this was coming on the day Biden announced she was his VP pick. Trump does re-cycle... üôÑ
then one cannot in good conscience vote for Trump or Biden
Well, they can't go with the "Biden hates cops" route üòÇ
He wants to have those press conferences every day and now that Biden has announced his VP it gives Trump something to turn his attention to. He needs to be challenged every damn day and he needs to not get away with his nonsense. Enough is enough.
So explain how Reparations went from virtual obscurity to part of the national debate, precipitating a congressional hearing and forcing the candidates to produce (albeit inadequate) BLK exonomic agendas... INCLUDING Biden.  No PACs.  No lobbyists.  How?

I saw how the DNC and the media played thier dirty tricks to give us Biden. I watched every single debate. I watched all the analysis. I saw the framing of questions and the manufacturing of consent. Everyone should be concerned.
Maybe the unemployed cops will volunteer to go out and enforce the mask mandate. I hope Biden doesn't see this, he make it part of his plan
Ain't nobody said, let's get Biden/Harris in office and call it a day. From day one, we keep fucking working and pushing. And if a less shitty cabinet can save some lives, then bet I'm picking them over the current one purposely screwing over &amp; killing thousands on their watch.
No leverage?  Blk voters have immense leverage and there is already a critical mass of BLK ppl that oppose this ticket.  Biden needs Obama numbers, nearly unanimous support to win.  He hasn't got that and he needs it. Thats partly why he chose Harris.  Thats the leverage.
Are we talking about Trump or Biden?
He‚Äôll be 75 years old in 2024 (younger than Biden is now but I think voters are going to be over Boomers/senescence in the next cycle).  Also voted with most of the other Big 10 presidents to postpone football, how‚Äôs that going to play in the GOP primary (only half joking).
Enjoy the cartoons, particularly the one from the buffalo news. (Prince's "Baby, I'm a Star" fits the VP selection.) #KamalaHarrisVP
A vote for Trump sounds like a vote for Trump.  Until Biden puts a real economic agenda, up to and including Reparations on the table, the overwhelming blk support needed to win is void.  Harris being a BLK woman is irrelevant. Her VP aspirations are not Reparations.
Biden your FIRED
Biden DPIKE ST THE HEAD OF KKK FUNERAL TRUMP FIDNT YOU IDIOT. Democrats voted to keep slavery Republicans VOTED TO END IT. SMARTEN UP AOC.
Our economy is the worst it has been since 1930 because of trump. Joe Biden wants to restore the economy and bring jobs the thousands who are unemployed bc there was no federal response to covid 19. Nice try though. Just throwing shit now to see where it hits.
And there will be an army from the grassroots on the ground explaining why voting for a Biden/Harris ticket without a specific Blk agenda in the table is suicide.  #NoBlackAgendaNoVote  #ReparationsNow
How will BLK citizens benefit from Biden/Harris "Crossing the finish line"?  Dr. West, their ticket has committed zero economic policies to BLK citizens.  Its the same Obama hornswoggle you once lamented we fell victim to.  90% support with zero in return.  We CAN'T do that again

he's still joe biden, someone who has a racist background and does not support M4A, and i cannot support him.
How Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries
A lack of a vote for Biden is a vote for trump
Theres not a doubt in my mind that no matter how many millions of votes remain uncounted in swing states, no matter how much team Biden begs them beforehand to be responsible, those greedy dicks at CNN, NYT etc will gladly hand trump everything he needs to steal it after the fact
Actually I‚Äôm betting on the ‚Äúdespite decreases in turnout (omitting that it‚Äôs a 75% decrease) and *whispers* some ballots uncounted *whispers* Trump appears victorious BREAKING: PRESSURE MOUNTS ON BIDEN TO CONCEDE‚Äù
Of which one? The one of Tucker was the other night. He said her name incorrectly, not disrespectfully ( I was watching). The man he had on called him on it and made it a big deal. Then Biden as he is introducing her as running mate, says it same way.
Not saying I‚Äôm voting Biden tho. If you live in NY/a blue state and you‚Äôre disappointed with Biden, don‚Äôt vote Biden. A third party/write in vote in NY tells the Dem‚Äôs that you‚Äôre a person who votes, but you‚Äôre not going to vote for just whoever they put up.
You know, you‚Äôre allowed to criticize political opponents while still planning to vote for them. You can both vote for Biden/Harris while still recognizing their problems. It‚Äôs anti-democratic to say ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt criticize democratic candidates because that just helps Trump win‚Äù
"Biden Chooses Kamala Harris as Running Mate" via
If you have 30 people, 12 vote trump, 9 vote Biden and 9 stay home. Trump wins, even though Bernie voters didn't vote for him.  Math.
How long did the Netanyahu "correction" take to be issued??? The world knows  is leaving January 2021 as Biden inauguration happens. Biden, Harris, the new Senate, House &amp; administration will begin the task of cleaning up the mess of corruption they inherited.
What worries me most about this election is how ppl think if biden and harris win the people won... its a lose-lose, whole system fucked
Why Did Biden Pick Kamala? Follow the Money
Sirota immediately voiced his support &amp; vote for Biden after Bernie suspended his campaign.  He DIDN‚ÄôT demand ANYTHING from Biden before supporting him.    He absolutely DID NOT leverage his support of Biden contingent on ANY policy positions.  Sirota‚Äôs lone reason is anti-Trump.

Biden exercising real leadership - mandatory masks! That will supercharge voters - right?
I fully expect Biden to run again. Kamala May struggle to run in 2028
Trump calls Kamala Harris ‚Äòmad woman‚Äô and bizarrely claims Democrats want to abolish ‚Äòany kind of animals' and tear down Empire State Building #SmartNews
Stupid question doesn't deserve an answer.  Would he ask Biden same question?
How many reasons you need, mail in voting can be open to much fraud!!  But that‚Äôs the only way Biden has a shot at wining!
With all the BS this President has had to put up with from democratics and the squad but look at the FANTASTIC job he has done, ecomomy, military it shows just how TOUGH he is! Biden and Harris don‚Äôt care. They‚Äôre just in it for what‚Äôs in it for them. Phony‚Äôs.
What polls are you using for this? Biden has lead in 29 of the last 30 public Florida polls but it's Lean Trump in your map.
So I shouldn‚Äôt panic because Biden went from +8 to plus 7? /s
He's based on science and Biden isn't?   Does the White House think everyone in this country has no memory and is beyond stupid?  He has science on his side alright. Contradicts every science based person on the Covid19 group with his hairbrained theories and says this...   WTH?

New Fox News poll has Biden +7, 49-42.
I didn‚Äôt realize I was mandated to answer the question.  And I‚Äôve already pointed you in direction (when/where) Biden mispronounced.  I‚Äôll repeat. Biden mispronounced it (said it the same way Carlson did) during his presser introduction of KH as VP. (5x) She was on stage w/him.
Biden did not say he was going to order universal masking or order the governors to order masking. He said he would ask the governors to do so. More lies from Fuhrer Trump.
Plus Biden's more religious than most people in America.  Wtf????
ok, I didn't have "Trump summoned by own appointee." on my bingo card.
Biden wine Biden steak Biden tower  All failed Biden enterprises.  Oh wait...
I can‚Äôt wait for Trump to accuse Biden of running a fraudulent university
I agree!  I shudder to think what will happen if Biden loses in November!
Biden/Harris are demons.  They plan to ban cookies with milk.
Sirota is definitely voting for Biden.   Are you saying there are other blue candidates for whom he would not vote?
Now do Joe Biden when he introduced his VP selection.
‚ÄúSanders adviser David Sirota was more circumspect, saying he would vote for Biden‚Äù
"We're not going to let Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris throw out our strategic plan to do nothing about coronavirus."
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim that this is going to be a rigged election. #TrumpKillsUSPS
Send in your ballots in early.. 30 days ahead of election and send it by  "return receipt requested". Costs less than $3. Can Mike Bloomberg help with paying this? He said he would help Biden win! If he helps this would not be considered a donation to trumps campaign!
I definitely good discern the *p##$%* part. I think it's stupid to say and I have heard other people of prestige talk the same. It doesn't bother me as much as Biden fondling kids which you find on YouTube. He does it very openly. Hard to ignore.
She endorsed Biden already?

When I was treasurer of 1071 the vast majority of IAFF members did not support John Kerry in his presidential bid. IAFF supported a loser then and now. The Dems hate police and support lawlessness. Biden is for single payer HC. everyone will lose employer health coverage. üá∫üá∏üëé
There‚Äôs correlation in their model, but their model has Biden at 72% and Nate said the model is very uncertain. I don‚Äôt think this is a plausible (or possible, even) outcome, but I‚Äôm not surprised it showed up.
Sometimes I think we are doing okay and then Herman Cain sends a tweet about Biden and Harris, and I remember there are no lows to which the GOP will not stoop

Just saw a post saying they couldn‚Äôt understand how anyone could possibly vote for Biden because he has health issues that have made him mentally unstable and unfit.  ...have you even seen the other guy?
Seeing evangelicals paint Biden/Harris as ‚Äúradical pro-abortion‚Äù makes me ill. I heard this shit before and why they *had* to vote for the asshole in office now. If you can excuse 160,000 deaths, kids locked in cages, and so much more, stop calling yourselves Pro-life and STFU.
Not voting for Biden is the same as voting for trump. I have never had a candidate I've been enthusiastic about. We just have to vote for the least disasterous.
Will politics reporters screwup again as in 2016, failing to dig into Trump‚Äôs thoroughly documented past while helping him exploit journalistic conventions to his advantage?   of  (Columbia Journalism Review) w/ some informing thoughts:
Hey! Russia is at it again. Supporting drumph; denigrating Biden; bringing on the racist trolls against Kamala. You should care &amp; act as a US Sen. But you don‚Äôt - no ethics, no principles, just craven loyalty.

Her &amp; Biden do have something in common, they both like locking black men up.
Maddox,  I know you're 12, but if you're on twitter: Thank you for standing up for what you believe in &amp; volunteering for the DNC &amp; Biden-Harris campaign. Just saw the text string where someone was totally rude to you. Keep up the good work &amp; don't let mean people discourage you!
Exactly this. Biden told us to vote for someone else. ü§£ He refused to budge on healthcare, mildly back peddled on education, and still has gaff after horrible gaff. Not to mention, we're still blamed for 2016 despite "falling in line" and the Electoral College being to blame.
They are doing that now with you as President.  Biden/Harris is the way to VOTE.
I just saw campaign ad by Joe Biden, he plagiarized Mr. Trump 2016 ad campaign. Keep jobs in USA, help middle class and economy. JOE, President Trump has already done that! You have a TV in the bunker? Your VP and THE SQUAD DON‚ÄôT have the same views of America. You don‚Äôt either.
The only good rhat came from is  that the progressives hate Kamala and Biden. They represent the establishment in the worst ways with their justice track records. Leftists don't like that.
Media today: worst ever disease! hide in your basement and forfeit your rights for a little feeling of security. Media if Biden wins: well actually it‚Äôs really not too much worse than the flu, and I guess we could get the economy going again.
Just saw campaign ad by Joe Biden, he plagiarized President Trump‚Äôs campaign ads from 2016. Keeping jobs in America, helping middle class retain more income. President Trump has already done that JOE! Your VP isn‚Äôt isn‚Äôt on the same page. Look at her track record as AG in SF.
The fact that Biden has at least said that he'll keep Trump's moves on Jerusalem and the golan in place is promising.
What They Told Us: Reviewing Last Week‚Äôs Key Polls.  ‚Å¶ has Biden over Trump by only 3%.  Remember Rasmussen called 2016 correctly:  Hillary by 2%, what's the electoral calculus? #Election2020
They matter a lot tho. I don‚Äôt like Biden and Kamala a lot but this is better than 4 more years of Trump in office.
Motivated to vote against Trump is fine, imo. They may not love Biden but they‚Äôll certainly vote for him.
Twitter users were understandably freaked out  via
to be fair, biden and pence didn't really do anything haha
Enthusiasm is a nothing-burger metric. Biden supporters are extremely motivated to vote, per polls; they are also enthused to vote AGAINST Trump. An a vote unenthusiastically counts the same as an enthusiastic vote.
could be difficult. Despite Biden's big win in the primaries, the hard core left (and anti israel focused) wing of the dem party will grow in the house.
I thought the Harris pick was supposed to be so awful and terrible and now Biden is going to lose every state
My flow chart for the future. In short voting for Biden/Harris delays any REAL reform for ~16 years.  #election #VoteTrump #ReformDemParty
you accused Biden of being of having unwanted sexual advances and you said you believe the women now you‚Äôve turned a blind eye to it secondly you accused him of being a racist you‚Äôve turned a blind eye to that also so what does that make of you
The self care day imma take after voting Biden
so you said you believe the woman that accused Biden of unwanted sexual advance so now are you being a hypocrite because you‚Äôre turning a blind eye into it and secondly you accused him of being racist have you turned a blind eye to that also
Why does it have to be "YOUR candidate"?  Obama rigged this for Biden to win when we had a chance for substantive change. Yes, he's the lesser evil but we've again been cornered into choosing evil. The truth is we'll have to fight every bit as hard for change under Biden as Trump
America will become weak if Biden gets elected.
Joe Biden's choice of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, as his vice presidential running mate elicited broad smiles from key black Catholics. Others, though, started criticizing her record nearly as soon as the pick was publicized
when we are facing multiple global crises that threaten our very existence on this planet and the Dem's response is Biden/Harris
Joe biden already served for 8 years. Yet, here we are.... unemployment through the roof, 100s of thousands dead. Racism rampant. Yeah, were in much better shape now....
That thing that's happening, where everyone is saying ‚ÄúBiden/Harris, not my first choice, but what are you doing to do?‚Äù  It's always like that. Even Obama's first run, I was skeptical just because he seemed a little too young, and i think his first year reflected that.
Biden will try and reconcile with the far right, they will spit in their hand. Brown shirts will be even more out in force, but the police will clamp down in BLM harder than before. Then in 2024 we will have to explain to people that Adolph Mussolini Mc.Killbaby is a villain.
Lolololol vote shaming totally closes the divide... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  "Settle for Biden/Harris and hold their feet to the fire."  *Attempts holding their feet to the fire, shifting the establishment paradigm left before signing away a vote*  "I gUeSs YoU'rE fAsCiSt!"
We don't need you to vote for Biden/Harris, enough folks will. And I don't think they let you vote in the afterlife anyway.
Ok I want this on record. Here is what's going to happen in the best-case scenario. Biden and Harris win, Dems take the Senate. Biden vetoes NGD, UBI, and M4A. All their "reforms" will be performative at best. The gap between the rich and the poor will grow even more 1/
you And Biden have the unique opportunity and the heavy responsability to turn around the USA and the Western world, the task is daunting, be up to it, there are millions supporting you everywhere in the world
Just acknowledging the possibility of being prosecuted is an admission by Giuliani they are losing badly. Cheer up Rudy, maybe Biden's AG will make you a deal.
BIDEN HARRIS 2020 BABY! I'M SO DAMN HAPPY! HOPE!
We cant loose all our Senate seats! We need to flip the Senate or Biden wont get anything done bc McConnell will add to his stack of all the Bill's he sat on for the past 4 years.
I just heard Biden's introduction of her and you are completely wrong.  Also, Tucker was doing it purposefully because he's a Nazi. Any instance of Biden doing it is just his senility and general inability to speak clearly.
I don't want to hear that elect Biden/Harris then hold them accountable stuff. I spent 8 years of my activist life waiting for most of you to hold Obama accountable. I heard nothing but crickets.
‚ÄúI am from Calcutta,‚Äù Cooney said. ‚ÄúSenator Harris is from South India. But we are both trying to break barriers for a very large and growing ethnic minority group in our country.‚Äù #Onward2020
Yes, Trump is vastly worse than Biden but Biden is running to the right of Hillary and has enlisted as his VP someone who has imprisoned people for small amounts of weed, kept prisoners beyond their sentences for cheap labor, fought exoneration of a clearly innocent person, etc.
This interaction is instructive. Biden is the king of shout downs. When these fascists are caught in a lie, they shout down any opposition. They use their presumed authority to get away with it!
If he stole my idea, so be it.  I really don't care how anyone reached the correct conclusion, only that they do.  We'll see if Democrats end efforts to defund (or as Biden calls it, "reallocate funds") the police and get them the training they need.  Not holding my breath.
I‚Äôm voting For Biden cuz I do believe in harm-reduction and with the right pressure Harris can facilitate SOME real progress, but I‚Äôm super critical because I know a lot of people like me won‚Äôt be voting and I‚Äôm beyond terrified that dems are gonna lose again. It‚Äôs too close

Comparing ice to the KKK is just wrong your way to lock one in the open borders,free healthcare, free for illegals immigrants, Taking away our Second Amendment that‚Äôs a great platform you got never voting for you or the idiot Biden
Joe Biden has been in politics for 47 years. If you think that he's going to be a positive change in 2021 than you are sadly mistaken.   Joe Biden has gotten wealthy as a career politician. If he wanted to help the country he should have done it the last 47 years.
Joe Biden, like most of his fellow Democrats, have NO respect for his constituents and voters at large, so lying to those that take them at their word and never question or verify what they are claiming, comes naturally.  Considering they keep getting elected, I understand why.
Reality is setting in that there is a high probability that Joe Biden will not finish his first term and that an unqualified Kamala Harris would become the 47th President, much like Sarah Palin in 2008.  President Kamala Harris...I don't think so.
Kamala and Biden as far left?  Is anyone buying that? I mean probably, but were those people voting for any Democrat anyhow?
I wonder - what percentage of people who are planning to vote for Joe Biden are doing so for the simple reason that they know he cannot possibly finish out a four year term ?
Kamala Harris stands on the shoulders of giants in the Democratic Party who broke down barriers ‚Äî the congresswomen Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Jordan and political operatives like Donna Brazile and Mignon Moore.
Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate had the most liberal voting record in the Senate last year ‚Äî surpassing even Bernie Sanders ‚Äî according to government watchdog GovTrack.

Dr Savage, I think we can say with certainty this writer listens to the program.  Total plagiarism. Link even said "Did Biden Trump Trump"

Also wrong.  Biden is Catholic.  Also weird since Biden was on two of the last three tickets. So ‚Äúlong time‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make sense.
Im not much of a Biden supporter but he's gotta be 1000x better than Trump will ever be. At this point I really believe a 4 year old could do a better job than him.
But I also live in deep blue NY so I am kind of sort of off the hook as are lefties in deepest red states. If you are in the battleground states you may feel compelled to vote Biden-Harris. 2/

God forbid but even if Biden dropped dead right now, with her AG experience, her Senate experience and her presidential campaign experience she's ready!!!!!!!!
The OP makes it sound like Biden is some sort of badass.   Maybe I misunderstood your tweet. This "it was always about the courts" is nonsense. If that were true, the Dems should've brought someone electable. Overestimate Biden at your own peril.
Are you high? Dude, they‚Äôre further to the right than George W. Bush. Biden voted for Iraq. Both of them love to throw and keep minorities in prison for stupid reasons. They love the banks like you do. It‚Äôs a match made in heaven.  Just trust me on this.

How much can we raise so Biden says this at the convention?
You're going the way of Bill Maher. It's very possible to make a defensible argument to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket without pretending she's something that she isn't. Why lie to yourself?
Did he go on to say why she would somehow taint Biden's faith?
I'm as suburban as they get. Kamala doesn't scare me. I find her uplifting. I am happy and comforted with her as Biden's VP pick.   Now, if I were a criminal, or a racist twat, I guess she'd scare me. Can't even wrap my head around that kind of thinking. So strange.

YES VERY BIDEN/HARRIS LET‚ÄôS GO!!
He is a racist and loves racists supporting him. No amount of your failure of a lifetime of trying to refute that will ever convince anyone with a functioning cerebral cortex. When Biden kicks his ass off the electoral map he'll rename your home Jomaha and outlaw ethanol subsidy
It's just so obvious how big of opportunists Harris and Biden are. They ascended the political landscape so well because they're good at schmoozing rich people/big businesses/law enforcement. The American people deserve better.

They‚Äôre all talking about the Pence/Harris debate because Biden is gonna flop hard against Trump and everyone knows it
He chose a qualified woman. He didn‚Äôt pick someone that was loyal to him. Credentials mattered. Biden chose someone that was critical of him. Seems like a smart choice to me.

I'd have to say that I believe this guy is right. Biden never had any core principles so it's impossible for him to "sell out" when his entire guiding philosophy has always been to only ever serve the donors. Sell outs once had ethics that are compromised. Joe never had them.

So why change?  It can get much worse under Biden, but economics were improving across the board for minorities prior to the pandemic.  I may not like Trump, but most of policies were a vast improvement from Obama.  Just sayin'

We have two terrible candidates, but the policies of Biden are far worse...with regulations to crush our economy and possibly send us into a Great Depression, where Trump's economy was humming along until the pandemic.  I don't see how Democrats have made us better since Clinton.
Ridiculous. How could I think everyone thinks like me when we constantly lose to the donor zombies?  Explain how Biden would do that when he has sworn not to. M4A is a much easier sell than UBI and he swears he won't even sign M4A. What good is Congress if POTUS acts against us?
Catholics vote like regular Americans,  for Gore, and Obama twice. Another words, they already voted FOR Biden twice. Stop with the weird litmus test.

Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
Joe Biden has spent most of his political career trying to destroy civil rights. Harris is responsible for the mass of black and latinx people in California. So yes they are.
88% of Dem voters want #M4AllNow yet Biden/Harris want to let people continue to die of lack of care. "Killing people slower" is a bad campaign plank. Until they decide to serve their voters instead of their donors  #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Joe Biden‚Äôs decision was cautious, perhaps even obvious. He weighed numerous candidates for his number two spot, but only the Senator from California, it would seem, could be greeted with ‚Äúof course it‚Äôs Harris‚Äù upon selection.
Nor should it be a place where one's religion has no influence on public life. Abortion isn't strictly a religious quarrel, it is an issue of personhood. Biden chooses to promote it, going against his own religion which has its own rules
Now provide Biden's track record üôÉ
Trump is the result of the corrupt donor driven corporate Democrats failing to fight for what their base actually wants. Now 88% of Dem voters want M4A but Biden insists he will never allow it. Don't even try to pretend it's progressives thwarting Dems. That's backwards
Biden supporters act the same as Trump supporters when they see a poll they don‚Äôt like, whine and say it‚Äôs garbage
By picking Kamala, Biden has made it clear that he is senile and insane
...and I understand that, but even though it may not be ideal, I can't be convinced that a Biden/Harris administration will be even remotely as destructive as 4 more years of this absolute asshole.
There's that biting Republicon wit. I'm sure that's going to cost Biden/Harris a lot of votes.
For the 1/100 time Trump isn't going to show up to debate Biden. Biden just has to ask Trump to read yo yo yo semitty...yo semite...Yohsmite...dah
Yeah, I‚Äôm surprised Trump hasn‚Äôt dumped Pence for a more brash or outspoken VP. Pence will get annihilated by Kamala. But yes, Biden is gonna get crushed by Trump.
Kamala will likely dominate him...while Trump will likely dominate Biden. Will be fun to watch them all
Biden/Harris2020  Vote the motherfucker out and then indict him on every applicable state and federal criminal charge
Biden's biggest mistake was not choosing Corn Pop as his running mate

Biden's misguided handlers think that it will work. At any rate, Biden wouldn't have gotten my vote regardless of what his handlers chose for "president in waiting."
Then Biden asks where he is. Trump shows him a drawing of an elephant and he calls it an armadillo.   Don't act like Biden is a good choice just because he can ride a bicycle and drink water. We've got an even worse choice than 2016 right now
She could have at least owned up to her past. She‚Äôs sweeping it under the rug. Remember, both Biden and Harris were attacked for their views on legislation
Not to worry. If Biden loses, everyone in those photos will deny that they ever knew her or heard of her. Such is politics and celebrity in the US.
Hopefully when Biden's administration takes over, we'll finally get the truth, and it will be ugly. But, if everyone votes, it becomes a non issue. They can't change that many votes, even in counties here &amp; there across the nation. None of it absolves white people for 45.

I don't think it matters to him. He'll pivot from one bigotry to another. Oakland is where white people don't live, and Trump is busy trying to convince everyone if Biden and Harris are elected, black and brown people are going to move into their communities.
Wonderful revealing retort! You don't actually mount an argument because you cannot refute the facts. Biden &amp; Kamala are donor driven candidates that refuse to even give lip service to progressive ideals. Go ahead and vote against your own self interests, again. U r SO ignorant.
Her qualifications speaks for themselves as she is more than qualified for the job. Whether she and Biden are elected or not does not speak to their qualifications it speaks to voters perceptions of them as leaders.

Im clueless, and you just tweeted a video about something pertaining to his son. Not what you were talking about, the accusation that obama/biden spied on trump. But ok, im clueless. Still waiting...
So instead of calling Biden far left and radical the Trump campaign will call Harris far left and radical. The deep thinking here blows my mind. #3Dchess
I know there‚Äôs always other candidates on the ballot but I‚Äôm talking about people who stand a chance against Trump in 2020 and I feel like that‚Äôs Harris and Biden

You just made me like Kamala Harris a lot more.  Homophobes, sexists, and anti-choicers are viewed as extreme in much of the country because they *are* extreme.  Biden and Harris had better not start pandering to ultrareligious lunatics if they expect my vote.
She blocked me too, which is weird/hilarious considering I‚Äôm a Twitter nobody who doesn‚Äôt have a fraction of the free time required to post enough to deserve blocking.
what is wild about  own words is that he's effectively saying  **lost** their "dignity" &amp; "respect" already...DURING TRUMP'S TENURE! Biden isn't  Trump is. Trump's words are the words of an outsider candidate - but he's the one in charge RIGHT NOW!

OPINION: When Trump inevitably insults Kamala Harris with misogynistic and racist stereotypes, she and Joe Biden should respond with positivity. His hatred will alienate voters and help the Democrats win in 2020.
Biden vs Trump.

Amazing. This Murray guy apparently has no job but to jump on Trumps tweets the moment he tweets. No buddy NYC will NOT vote for communist/fascist dictators like Biden and Harris. I live here. I know. Me and everyone I know in NYC are saying NO to that scum.

Arguing with Bernie-or-Busters isn't to beat Trump. The left will not cost Biden the election. It's to make the left a part of a voter bloc that SOMEONE wants to win over in 2024, rather than make them the same fucking afterthought they were before 2016.
It really does suck, I agree. But things can actually improve. There are several progressive candidates winning Congress and they'll probably push the administration toward the left, in case Biden wins and the election is not stolen.
No, I have some data. More Biden voters intend to v-b-m vs. Trump voters, who disproportionately favor in-person voting. This partisan division has opened up b/c of Trump's statements re v-b-m. 1/
You have to be such an Idiot. What, when, and where had Biden done anything? Can you mention something that Sleepy Joe had done, other than sell the country to China along with Hunter....

Sad to say, but it's all too predictable that Biden will say something like, "Our country needs to heal, we aren't going to look backward, we're going to move forward", and not hold Trump accountable. Same as Obama did not hold Bush accountable.

Funny how suggesting both candidates meet a neutral Black leader is some how sabotaging Biden campaign. Why is it that his campaign is so dependent on Black people getting the shaft n not complaining about it? Seems like they want to continue business like usual not change things

The fun thing a out this is that Biden has said he wants to give more money to cops, so it can only be taken as an endorsement of Donny's non-police related politics.

Youre a socialist &amp; u think Biden's plans are good? Or even true? As far as the Medicare option goes it will be a huge gift to ins comps &amp; will cause Medicare rates to skyrocket cuz all ins comps will dump their sick in2 the option. As for Bernie having input 2Biden..U R dreaming
This question is for you and also  -- Could range/score/STAR voting be used to pick both a president and a vice president from the same primary?  Like -- imagine if Biden didn't choose the VP but we did during the primary, wouldn't that be much better?
So thats the state they want to infiltrate and corrupt the election results. With Gore it was Florida. With Hillary it was Ohio. Now with Biden it‚Äôs Montana.

It's funny  what I consider "flat, desultory" is ur 1/2 baked political punditry. Obviously most ppl don't agree with u - the Biden campaign raised over $50M in 48hrs after  announcement.  U shld go back 2 reviewing restaurants; ur way out of ur league.
Yeah, Biden has not made a mis- statement.

Sure that will be um. Never. üòÇüòÇüòÇ. At the end realistically speaking Biden is weak he will be crushed by other world leaders  he is a puppet he is not strong he is being controlled now by his own party it's a joke  he's no leader never was and never will be
You ever see this?
Oh yes! I wanted her to be the Presidential nominee. I couldn't be happier. That said. I am working to GTVO. I will do whatever I can to support her and Biden.  Black women have carried us all for generations. It is time.
I honestly never realized what emotionally driven pussies my fellow leftists are. Spend the whole primary vote shaming Biden supporters (rightfully so) to convince them to vote for the better candidate, Bernie, then during the general election, act like little victims of shaming.
Democrats don‚Äôt need to worry about leftists voting Trump. We hate him. They should be worried about convincing us to vote Biden. Because that‚Äôs not an easy task and so far they‚Äôve been absolutely shit at it.
How it shows you guys don't know anything: Leftists don't like Biden bc his platform *isn't* far left. It's neoliberal corporatism. You ppl on the right don't understand that massive rift between the left-wing on policy, &amp; the Biden corporatist-wing that doesn't like the left

Wallace thought he‚Äôd def have a chance to interview Biden after shilling for his fake campaign for months....nope, no press, no questions. A big FU to their most diehard supporters, MSM.
I hear a lot of ‚Äúwell Trump is horrible, but... *whispers* I guess we have to stick with what we have.‚Äù  I think the Biden support is a FakeNews mirage and what support he does have is extremely shallow, fair-weather fans. Trump people will crawl over broken glass to vote.
this is explains the Democrat scam orchestrated by the corrupt big labor unions
‚ÄúThird party voters like you are the reason we‚Äôll lose in November‚Äù said the ardent Biden supporter, not realizing his mailbox was being removed outside that same moment.
I never said cuomo wasn't wrong.   Pretending that Florida, Arizona, and Texas aren't worse is just idiotic.
Why don‚Äôt you order the US Department of Justice and order Joe Biden and his son investigated for crimes committed. Biden is an accessory after the fact.
Experts weigh in on the Biden-Harris logo: ‚ÄòIt could be scribbled on a napkin and I‚Äôd be happy‚Äô
#ByeHannity is trending and it has a lot about Q in there too. The attempts to make Trump weak are humorous. They have like 2 second clips compared to the full length feature films on Biden

Biden at a virtual fundraiser tonight commented on news of USPS mailboxes being removed in Oregon, a state w all mail voting.  ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre going around literally w tractor trailers picking up mailboxes,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòI mean, it‚Äôs bizarre.‚Äô  Per press pooler.

It‚Äôs not done til it‚Äôs won. BUT, you kinda have to be optimistic about the coalition of the wiling. Biden, Kamala, Bernie and Warren working together is kinda powerful. With mayor mike pulling strings with $$ #GETITDONE
I am not okay with a federal election being hijacked. So, whatever it takes to prevent that from happening, I am in support of ... obviously, Congress has no self-interest, or interest in the people. The Senate is gone. They've the Russian ruble.  So, Biden in first.

Drain the swamp. How many 501 c 3s are there tht work to promote Dems &amp; funnel campaign cash to DNC under the guise of charitable contributions? BLM is the most notable, they‚Äôve received almost a billion tht they funnel to act blue aka Biden.
The left have so vilified the police, how can you not be surprised.  The teachers union will probably endorse Biden.
Biden's lead has expanded to double-digits vs Trump in an NPR/PBS/Marist poll. Biden leads Trump 53% to 42%, up from an 8% advantage at end June.  71% of Americans now see Covid as a threat: many more than before. 167,000 Americans have died; 5 million have been infected.
If you are on the fence re Trump v #Biden, remember that despite all claims to the contrary there is overwhelming empirical evidence that #DonaldTrump is wholly unfit for office, to wit: his pattern and practice of outright lies and deceptions, his self-dealing, his narcissism...
Oh no. You see, Trump is hard on China so that‚Äôs okay.   Kamala (aka Biden) is GOOOOOD for China so that‚Äôs almost deserving of an execution.   If not, at least 20 years hard labor at re-education camp!
Biden doesn't even know what day it is today let alone trying to tell the entire country to wear masks. Even if he does become President, this won't make it through Congress because Republicans and Democrats will fight each other the whole time.
Who gives a fuck? All you‚Äôre doing is promoting Russian propaganda. You think people don‚Äôt see through that? Haha Even the IC says Ukrainian dirt on Biden is just russian smear campaign. But guess what, you‚Äôre losing big in 60 days and that‚Äôs when the entire GOP goes boom
If Biden gets elected, he's gonna presumably spend 4 to 8 years getting shit on by the right-wing AND a huge percentage of the left-wing. That's exactly how it should be.

NY is literally a lock for Biden. The only people who'd vote for Trump are the racists upstate. Even then, that's nowhere near enough
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
Tulsi should have been the nominee not biden they did this to themselves.
It's clear the Biden campaign is protecting Biden from facing tough questions, we can all speculate as to why. It seems like a flawed strategy, though. Do you really want Biden to walk into the first debate in September not having faced a tough interview in months?
Now that I know you support Biden. I can‚Äôt take anything you say now seriously.
I‚Äôm happy with Biden‚Äôs choice of Kamala Harris  I mean. Let‚Äôs be honest if he chose a bottle of sunscreen we‚Äôd still vote for him  But still. She‚Äôs solid.
I feel the Biden/Harris team,from Trump's perspective,is too good to be true;And Trump would want to take advantage of it,while it lasts.Who are you a fan of,Mrs.Pletka?A woman VP would've helped Trump? If Trump,I'd focus on the #WomensVote,and #LatinoVote;Too late now,for Trump?
It‚Äôs not merely an accusation. Trump did indeed try to bribe the Ukrainian President to slander Biden. Trump might be president, but he‚Äôs also an awful man.
I don't like Biden, but I disliked the last 4 years way more.. Biden it is.
YES! I‚Äôm with that 100%. Biden literally is nowhere near being good for this country or the world. That being said; Trump is literally a demon and needs to be stopped at a l l cost
With all these different forms of #votersuppression I don't think Biden is ahead when those forms are factored in, sad to say. #usps #TheReidOut #coronavirus
Easy for him to say, the Dems will be running the country and keeping Biden safely in his basement (where he will not need a mask) after the election. Hopefully he has a nice basement, because he'll be there for 4 years.

Trump doesn't care about restoring the black community and neither does Biden. We have to do it ourselves.
I keep seeing tweets like, ‚ÄúWHAT EVEN IS JOE BIDEN‚ÄôS PLATFORM, NO ONE KNOWS‚Äù and I mean... that is why he has a website? So you can read his platform?
I also think they‚Äôd all pretty much support Biden/Harris except Peggy. Dale would have thought corona was a conspiracy until he lost his sense of smell for 6 weeks and that changed his mind on the whole election.
Trump/gop have lost a % of their voters. They will b voting 4 Biden in Nov. They're 2 stupid 2 realize that not every republican voter r like Trumps cult followers. November is going 2 b a landslide 4 democrats &amp; Biden. Look 4 the gop's shocked faces in Nov. #VoteBidenHarris2020
You win!
i wouldnt trust biden to drive me home though

The U.S. Postal Service workers' union endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden Friday after President Donald Trump frankly acknowledged that he's starving the USPS of money to make it harder to process an expected surge of mail-in ballots.
I‚Äôm not going to lie, I prayed like hell for this. I have an older family member who was indifferent about voting in the election. Wtf? Now it‚Äôs, ‚ÄúIf Carter can support Biden, I can too.‚Äù This is a really big moment for all of us!

No one out-swamps Biden, boyo...
it's so sad our "president" is so lacking, not just in values, but any shard of creativity. Has to recycle lamest garbage. Fox hosts are now casting Biden as facing imminent mortality, just like Hillary did. 45 is like a washed up lounge act who won't get off the stage.
