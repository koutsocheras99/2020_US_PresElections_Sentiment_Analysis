Someone said other VP candidates were dropping oppo on Bass.  But I'm convinced team Biden is doing it after building her up so that it looks like they have no choice but to make "safe" pick in Harris.
You did not beat Obama, you didn't even beat Biden. Obama would have cleaned your clock far worse than Biden will. Resign already!
Biden‚Äôs are made up Bunker boy‚Äôs are legit. Sorry booboo
There is absolutely no evidence that Joe Biden wants to pursue a radical extremist agenda or would rubber-stamp it if Congress decided to. This argument just doesn't hold up to scrutiny.
Kamala‚Äôs intellect and ‚Äúrubbing people the wrong way‚Äù is exactly why she should be VP. She‚Äôll mop the floor with Pence during the VP debate. She fills in the gaps of Biden‚Äôs weaknesses with her strengths. They‚Äôd be a formidable force.
The left is threatening to continue burning down our cities if we dont elect Biden.  If that doesnt get your goat you will LOVE living in a Communist country
#FiredUpReadyForJoe  To Make His VP Announcement
MORE LIES FROM TRUMP. Joe Biden never said he wanted to defund the police. BTW YOUR CAMPAIGN ADS ARE STUPID. All you do is lie and everyone knows it. JOE BIDEN HAS GREAT ADS! Do you know why they‚Äôre great? Because what he says is true! HE‚ÄôS JUST A GREAT GUY AND YOU ARE A FAKE.

Biden Goes Into Blank Stare After Forgetting Where He Is, Tries and Fails To Pass It Off as Joke
Only deficits under Democratic administrations are bad.  The GOP deficits are patriotic.  Need to get rid of the filibuster because the GOP will use deficits as an excuse to block any Biden initiative that requires investment.
It's a good thing Joe Biden isn't ambitious.
Because he's doing it again with Biden.
Obama isn't running for president. After a two term, 8 years, Scandal Feee, time in the White House, he's backing Joe Biden, and warning, as are literally thousands of people, many of who were part of Trump's Administration, in strongest words, about the Danger Trump poses to USA
I‚Äôve donated, attended online events and celebrated a few of his policies, but if Biden continues this he will get no more help from me outside of my vote. The welcoming of Kasich and the comments of Dodd shows they are not understanding this moment - at all.
I am so so riled up about this. The fact that Biden has these assholes in his inner circle making decisions about the campaign is absolutely disgusting. And the fact that it has ended up in multiple news outlets makes it worse.
Has Biden gone blind?
Serious question. What happens when Biden drops out after accepting the party nomination? Does the party get to name another candidate, like say Cuomo or does it fall back to who held the second most delegates being Sanders?
I can‚Äôt take much more of his BS. We have suffered from day one from his whining, me me me, everyone else is crap pretense of a POTUS. He needs to shut up. I‚Äôm saying if Biden doesn‚Äôt win then  WE need to protest the election. No way that many people want 4 more years of this
You know what?  Americans have suffered from day one of his ridiculous pretense of playing POTUS. We have suffered ENOUGH. Too much. So he can forget this BS. If Biden doesn‚Äôt win WE WILL PROTEST THE OUTCOME. Because we can‚Äôt take any more of him. He needs to shut up &amp; go away.
It's just the same old Conspiracy Theory crap!  Gotta scare (fear monger) the Trump base to get votes.  PS. Joe Biden does *not* want to defund the police and has never said a single thing in support of it.
BIDEN WILL LOSE#EvictTrump
Yes, it‚Äôs going to take years to unfuck everything. But Biden alone doesn‚Äôt matter. Getting both the House and Senate majority matters, saving SCOTUS matters, and they‚Äôll pull him leftward. Warren has already been doing it.
With luck (and all hands on deck in November) 2022 should be Biden's America, not Trump's.
Are you going to be this boisterous when Biden is President?
You nailed it. Looks like dems are trying to get ahead of the Biden Ukraine crap so he may need a different October surprise.
maybe, but I'd bet less than you think. I think its a real short list of folks who are on the fence with Biden but would be swayed by VP. Most folks on the left at this point know either they won't be feeding the machine or they can't sit by with Trump as the opponent.
It will be such a landslide for Biden that you will absolutely know on election night.
Yeah, man, why didn't Joe Biden send in the National Guard?  He really fell asleep at the Not His Job Right Now.

Obama and the Dems seem to be running scared. He had eight years to do any of this but didn‚Äôt even try. Now he‚Äôs says this is what needs to get done as if Biden will ever get it done.
It‚Äôs a Biden campaign ad.
I am using Biden so that I can understand why there is seemingly a disconnect here.
B/c Biden will be at a mass gathering where there essentially is no social distancing.  Yet, Mr. Biden is staying in his basement because of social distancing.  But the protesters do not socially distance and you claim there's no spike.  Do you understand the conflict now?
Assuming you statement is accurate, then it can only logically (and scientifically) assumed that there now exists no material impediment for Mr. Biden to be physically present at his political rallies and speeches.  If not, why not (i.e.please distinguish).

As of today, we now know trump is desperate and salty due to biden winnng the polls and his polling averages were oversampled/overpolled and didnt actual real primary elections his actual vote count was worse than any poll.
This is mainly who I am taking about. He is on the selection committee. He has been named in most of the leaks. So yes, surrogates. Donors going to donor, but to say they don‚Äôt have some control over this is false.

No way  can you choose who you want to ..Don't you know that by now.. You would have forgotten who you chose anyway.

Biden has already proven that he won‚Äôt be able to keep us safe without copying ideas from someone else (COVID-19 ring a bell?) What‚Äôs gonna happen when he has to come up with his OWN ideas for what we need for today‚Äôs market?  No thanks.
Absolutely! Mail in voting is exactly what the Deamoncrats want. Allowing them to change the vast majority of the votes over to the deamoncratic candidates. Once Biden is replaced as their candidate, odds are they will replace him with one of the hateful 4 unAmerican scam squad.

Thoughts and prayers.
Don't hold back, tell us what you really think about Biden.
The Biden q&amp;a was orchestrated and leads one to believe he is incapable of handling unscripted questions.
Burn to the ground and Biden becomes President. That in not acceptable.
Biden is a seriously ill brain dead puppet. This can be said of all elected Democrats. They vote in lockstep. The only ideas they have  party gives to them.

I can understand not liking Biden and not voting for him, but are you voting Trump?
Ha, no, they have been given the best hand ever. I think people in Biden's campaign are waking up to the fact that by the end of September many right leaning independents will go back to Trump regardless of Covid. So the Doc is right, they have to be clever to keep the senor vote

You have a valid point, I am not sure this election will end on Election Day...possibly not even on the Inauguration of hoping Joe Biden. Trump has a lot to lose and he doesn‚Äôt care how he stays in the game.
When Biden said this about Obama in 2007 : ' I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who¬†is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man.' He said, in order words, that Blacks were dirty, ugly, dumb...Wow! Not racist?

Everyone knows about the old crime bill he supported. Things change and in hindsight the bill was wrong. Biden learns from his mistakes unlike the orange clown who will continue to fail.
Problem is that Trump has lowered the expectations for Biden so much that all Biden needs to do in the 1st debate is show up and not drool to win.
There's alot who follow Trump just to harass him, so that 82 million is not necessarily his supporters. Democrats don't like Biden but you can bet they'd go out and vote for a dog with rabies in November just to get Trump out.

Biden is going to crash soon! Trump is going to win be "default!"
There won‚Äôt be a plan. We have to save ourselves by voting. Joe Biden will have to do it.
But not voting for Biden so we get 4 more years of Trump- will fix which one of those issues? Asking for a friend.

Biden vs trump
The Nov vote is simply a referendum on trump. Are you better off than 4 years ago? Do the actions of the current WH agree with your vision of American and family values? Let's be clear, this is binary. Trump if yes, Biden if no. Anything else is trump vote in our electoral system

Lol Bunker Biden...The deflection is so hard with people like you.
China IS responsible for infecting the ENTIRE world with the virus and you want to blame Trump??!! The economy was NEVER better before the virus hit and ONLY President Trump can bring it back. Name ONE thing Biden did to help Americans in his 50 yrs. Good luck with that.
On the other hand, Biden was good friends with Robert Byrd, a leader of the KKK. Don't be fooled by the MSM. Trump is NOT a racist.
He wrote and passed the "First Step Act" that helped many Blacks get released from prison. President Trump felt they were unfairly sentenced because they were unable to hire big name attorneys. Biden or Obama NEVER did any of this.
Biden IS a whiny bitch and his horndog son who impregnates women and then denies it should be castrated as well as any man who votes for this doddering old fool..#INSTABLOCKED
Mr. President, if Joe Biden becomes President in November, we will have to change the National Anthem to "Taps", not only for the death of the many lives being lost in Democratic-run cities, but also for the death of our Nation.
Actually,  I think Joe Biden should add one more word, e.g. dog. It will drive Trump nuts that Biden had 6 words, not 5.
The NBA Commissioner knows that if Biden wins they can continue being supported by China. It‚Äôs horrific that neither the owners, coaches or players will comment about China and the slaughter of their own Citizens. Money has no conscience.

questions from reporters, as documented by¬†Breitbart News.
some people are suggesting that Biden‚Äôs team is doing all they can to block him from having unfiltered interactions with the media.  Events from earlier this week seem to confirm these suggestions. On Tuesday, the 2020 Democrat nominee outrightly refused to answerAnd why hasn‚Äôt he and hillary been arrested?  We‚Äôve had 2 do-nothing AGs. What a shame.   We have a President that want to drain the swamp but it runs too deep!  If Biden wins, there is no help for this once great sovereign republic.
Andy may have been Romney-Trump-Biden.  Was willing to support Trump in 2016 as a fellow Ivy grad (do you know Andy went to Cornell?), but is returning to the hometown kid now.
Writing Joe Biden speeches.
I think Biden picking someone that says they wont seek a presidential term is terrible. If Biden resigns/dies before 2024, the Dems are going to be fine with a lame duck president? And who would want to be that person's VP?
I think Phyllis and Kevin would change from Trump-Biden (Kevin only after Oscar spends months guilting him). Angela, Dwight and Ryan staying with Trump. Everyone else voted Hillary-Biden or didn‚Äôt vote.
yes i saw another biden ad on espn
joe biden is a rabid dog, he should be beaten to death with a stick
To be clear I'm not telling you that you have to vote Biden but I'm not going to trash people on the left who think having Biden in office would be less awful the having a fascist Trump administration that is still botching this pandemic responee.
Voting for Biden isn't an unreasonable position and I think he's fucking awful. If you think that somehow the DNC will all of the sudden betray their donors and support M4A to avoid losing the support of some on the left you're being naive. Not voting for them doesn't scare them.
Also, my sense is that the leaks about Kamala are from pro-Kamala people trying to embarrass Biden into picking her.
Michael is an Obama-Trump-Biden voter. He votes for Biden because he‚Äôs friends with Obama.
People shouldn‚Äôt be in the position of  choosing between the lesser of the evils. I hate Trump as much the next person, but I haven‚Äôt lost my objectivity as to what an awful person Biden is as well. Vote blue no matter who is the worst slogan ever.
Your non-vote will also make a difference.  And that difference could be between Trump winning or Biden winning.  Think about the impact of your non-vote.
You ran against Hillary Clinton! This time it's Joe Biden! You're Sundowning! Go to bed.
Well we now know where Hunter Biden is, just follow her.

This is how the VP process works. They always announce right before the convention. Like HRC, Biden is running a very traditional campaign.
Ryan tells people he's voting for Biden, tells himself he's going to vote for Howie Hawkins, but then forgets to vote.

Why in the world would Joe Biden pick Karen Bass? 90% of the country has no clue who she is &amp; Bass in her mid 60s. If I were him, and the Democrats, I would think about setting up the next candidate, because I doubt Biden will run for a 2nd term. Karen Bass won't be POTUS in 2024
Thanks for the tag Andy. Followed all. Keep up the good work. #FBR #StrongerTogether
She could sacrifice a lamb on an altar and I'd still vote Biden if she's VP.
Biden sincerely cares about ALL of America.  He is compassionate and believes in the Constitution.
Do your research. Obama and Biden had a 69 page pandemic plan that tRump threw out, along with firing the pandemic team. He has done nothing to help this country stop the spread of the virus and is a global embarassment.

Harris allies granted call with Biden campaign after Dodd blowup
Sir, I just can‚Äôt help but think these comments towards Harris by Biden‚Äôs ppl is more of indication he‚Äôs not going to put up with Harris‚Äôs online cult group and it‚Äôs shows she can‚Äôt control them at all. It‚Äôs like Bernie Bros and that‚Äôs what did Sanders with them.
Are you kidding me? Dont embarrass or insult the intelligence of Baron. I'm sure he is an amazing, smart, with-it kid.. there is no comparison.  Biden is definitely cognitively impaired.  Looks and sounds like some form of dementia
Did you see the spread between Bernie's general election Florida numbers and Biden's?
Given your political Inclinations that would make sense if Sanders were the nominee, but it‚Äôs Biden. We are not going to become Cuba. Not even close. A Republican Senate will try to do to Biden what they did to Obama. They will have learned absolutely nothing.

Defund means taking away funding they need to cover costs, and that is not what Biden or most Americans want. If your redirecting calls relating to nonviolent issues to a different force separate from the police, you can REDIRECT funding to support that.
Well, you may feel that way, but I have older family members who always vote and usually Republican.  They feel "safe" with Joe Biden.  They can't wait to vote for him so they feel better.  Can't he be a stepping stone to youth?  I think he can.

Biden IS the other choice.  You are right.
Yup.  Then a ‚Äúbustling, heroic save of the economy by Biden‚Äù with +.1% SPX days, 1.50 rates, stagnating GDP and declining dollar
Mark this: the craziest part of Biden‚Äôs win in November won‚Äôt be the fact he won but the fact he will do virtually everything trump was already doing and regarded as a hero for it
With all respect, in 95 days we will have a chance to save our nation.  After that, you and Potus Biden will begin to heal this country.
Joe Biden doesn't want to defund the police. More GOP lies.
You are co-signing on all the people that will suffer under a Biden presidency. I'm not voting for either authoritarian corporatist because both of them are shitty people and as a non shitty person I have no interest in helping them do so.
Biden has dementia &amp; you‚Äôre backing him! Enough said.
I'm not voting for Biden because he's Biden not because he isn't Bernie, and no refusing to vote for corporate authoritarians does not make me a bad person. Your plain as day voter harassment however does make you a shitty person.
Karen Bass is a double whammy. She is a Castro-sympathizer and a Scientology supporter! Hell no! Joe Biden needs to pick Kamala or Susan Rice and stop with the reality TV antics!
But think about it. Why? Why them? They want to save the gop, they know if they can purge the trumpists they can ‚Äúreturn to normal‚Äù (loud parts quiet again) and saddle joe biden with the burden of cleaning up this mess. The party would collapse under a second trump term (1/2)

Bombed Libya to point it turned into a failed state &amp; its citizens were sold into slavery. Armed terrorists to topple Assad in Syria, facilitated coup in Honduras. Among other BS, Biden has done almost nothing positive in 44 consecutive years in government.
Karen Bass will be 70 after Biden‚Äôs first term. That would put her at 78 if she wins and completes the next two terms as president. I want someone younger.
If you hate Trump- OK.. voting for Biden out of pure bias and no logic is a despicable act.
Educate yourself on Biden's 44 year record.

There have been several high profile dems that have said kamala is ‚Äútoo ambitious‚Äù amongst other things &amp; imho is getting treated unfairly by dems and press (like Hillary). Biden pushed back his vp announcement &amp; I hope he‚Äôs not taking this ‚Äútoo ambitious‚Äù nonsense into account.
Who should Biden pick for VP?
...Karen Bass (who they're really pushing in the trial balloons) or Susan Rice, who are both excellent but also I could see them drawing primary challenges from the Bernie/AOC left in 2024 (or '28 if Biden is feeling it). The Dems are still not "an organized political party"
I think Biden really thought he was picking Klob before the George Floyd protests blew up. Harris is the obvious choice except all the old men he listens to (and maybe his wife) think she's too "pushy." So now he's going to pick someone he's "comfortable" with, probably...
I‚Äôm an old white woman, who‚Äôs getting sick and tired of pundits denigrating old white men. I don‚Äôt like Harris, because of the stunt she pulled at the debate, With T-shirts waiting in the wings. I like Rice, but it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs choice.
Biden is a Bubba, not Obama lite  via
I think Trump,himself, decided not to attend Lewis‚Äôs lying in State in the Capital. Biden went. Many people attended some &amp; not all. I felt the day of the funeral, Trump might decide he did not want to be left out, &amp; insinuate himself. I was extremely relieved not to see him.
I respect Ed Rendell however I 100 percent disagree with him regarding Kamala Harris. I think she would be an excellent choice for VP. Anyone who Biden picks is a better option than Mike Pence. #KamalaHarrisForVP
If that was trump and not bill it would be on every channel. Even Cartoon Network would be talking about it. Since the girl said Trump never partaked though... they don‚Äôt care. Wait til Biden shows up in the papers.
It is a really bad look to lobby against Kamala Harris because she‚Äôs ‚Äútoo ambitious‚Äù. I‚Äôve been donating regularly to the Biden campaign. Only good reason to oppose a pick is if it hurts the ticket.
Too bad you WON'T get OUR VOTE! Sleep on Biden into becoming our next POTUS! Never thought someone asleep would be MUCH IMPROVED over what we have now!#naptimeü§≠

Speaking only for myself:  The populist, identity politics of Kamala have always given me the opinion that she's the "Trump of the Left" (far more intelligent, though).  I'd want nothing to do with that, so much so that a likely vote from me for Biden would go out the window.
It‚Äôs hard to see in this drive by photo but this duplex in OCNJ had Trump flags up top and Biden flags below. We were fascinated!

Great case for a woman who: has said repeatedly she has no interest in running for president; is the most admired woman in the world; has a strong trusted relationship with Biden; is intellectually and emotionally capable for the job; and would motivate record turnout.
Biden didn't crack 15% in Iowa. Others had to bail-out, Yang included.  DNC didn't want to risk a 1st timer losing to an incumbent, it would cripple them politically.  Mayor Pete's next primary opponent, would only need the easy line of "This guy couldn't even beat Trump".
Stop and think for a second. We are entering a national election in less than 100 days. No debates? No rally‚Äôs!  seems hunter Biden scandal is gone along with the flu. Fight for mail in voting. Where are the studies HCQ works for covid 19. Americans are being played.
I agree he was a great man who has passed,but to turn a eulogy into a political campaign is wrong,its similar to what Biden and other public officials did at George Floyd's funeral,now in no way am I comparing the life of Floyd to Lewis,as far as i'm concerned there isn't any
I just think not acknowledging she is being overly criticized is dishonest...even that Ari Melber thing...He created a whole ‚Äúseries‚Äù just to dig at her...he said they‚Äôd be discussing ALL contenders, Biden may be announcing tomorrow...and that‚Äôs how this whole primary has been
Why...because deciding between Yang, Biden and Trump needs 95 days of pondering?
Sean, can you guys kindly consider a return to your previous format for election comparison? This is really tough on the eyes.
Obama Biden. Hillary. Gym Jordon. Orange Dumpling.
Biden should pick someone who can be a true partner as his VP, as he was. There are a number of great candidates. That said, I think the people in his circle criticizing Harris as ‚Äútoo ambitious‚Äù are underestimating his personal appeal and ability to lead, and Harris‚Äô character.

No credible people would  talk like this. Biden would  not talk like this or think like this. Whoever was interviewed for this, lacks discipline, maturity &amp; should be mum about it. Power attracts some of the worst people. This sloppy interview proves it.
Thanks in part to Joe Biden.
Sure Biden is the one with dementia. Trump is asked why not spent more energy providing states with resources for mail-in elections. And Trump thinks the reporter is accusing him of having low energy or something.
Dude ‚Äúnever trump Republicans‚Äù are like three percent of 30% of the voters.   They‚Äôre wildly over represented in media but they make up a vanishingly small percentage of the electorate.   And the Biden strategy is to go all in on them.   Come on.
that's one of the reasons I think so too lol. but for niggas to make it seem like black people didnt have a say in the creation of the bill is disingenuous. the people who live through the crack epidemic played a very big role in its creation. blaming biden alone is wrong
I can confirm that Biden is pro-pasta and other delicious carbs.

If in the hypothetical Trump shot Biden on the debate stage I do believe local authorities would arrest him. They would have to, as an imminent threat. if they didn't what would stop him from shooting 12 other people? Admittedly this is a ridiculous hypothetical, but with Trump??

Joe Biden &amp; Nancy Pelosi did not do well in the most recent edition of the national paper, "The Catholic Register" They did so poorly, I was surprised. The article praised President Trump for all his good works in supporting the issues the other two were expected to support.

((looks like the progressives are already voting for Biden at least as high as 2016 levels for Clinton, from polling, so not too concerned about that))  But I would announce her as Treasury at the same time as VP pick

Yes, many voted for Biden. Is that not a fact in your world? Bernie and Yang both ran and lost. Both were great candidates who had their chance and didn't win. They are now supporting Biden.
I think leading the Black Caucus is a huge plus. I think Biden is looking for someone who won‚Äôt take the spotlight based on some of the reporting, and also someone who is perhaps a little more loyal than Harris is perceived as because of the primary attacks.

The fact is they simply do not have a deep bench when it comes to women of color with the qualifications to be President, Harris has the best credentials. However, even she has a pretty shallow resume more similar to Obama or Cruz than a steady hand like Pence/Cheney/Biden.

Just a reminder; Trump‚Äôs campaign ads showing looting &amp; burning, etc. and claiming that would be Biden‚Äôs America, is actually Trump‚Äôs America. Additionally, Miller is the most stiff of the stiffest bunch of fascists I‚Äôve ever witnessed in the WH.
Maybe we should be certain Biden is elected before we tear him down. I operate under the rule of eliminating the greatest threat first.
one thing i like about the neolibs is that, while they're trying to reclaim/redefine "neoliberal", they're aware their usage of it is idiosyncratic  compare this to the anarchists who were so sure joe biden was talking about arresting people for liking kropotkin
Barack Obama Just Changed the Landscape of a Joe Biden Presidency
You seriously look like this?  Jump off a bridge.

This what Trump and his campaign team should be doing if they are serious about winning the election, instead of falsely attacking Former Vice President Joe Biden and the peaceful protests, focus more on combating the Coronavirus and the COVID 19 disease with actual facts.

Trump is a threat to our democracy and is becoming more authoritarian by the day. This country will not survive another 4 years of Trump.  I prefer Biden's policies and like that he is working with Bernie on a tax plan. This is what I like about Biden:
I‚Äôm resigning from twitter as soon as we have a sane President. Biden will do. For now.
I can't emphasize enough how completely disconnected from reality the #votebluenomatterwho logic is. Trump is absolutely an insane, narcissistic, misogynist, bloated cheese curl of a human, but Biden is a flaccid, passive, corporate loser who will do near-nothing to fix the
He voted Johnson. And he said he wouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden due to his clear cognitive decline.
Now you know darn well Joe Biden did not put the word 'effusive' in a sentence.
So witty. So original. Every minute you don't make calls for Biden you're making calls for Trump.
Affordable housing is a HUMAN right.    joined forces with  and  this evening to discuss Joe Biden's Racial Equity policy.
More democrats voted for Biden.  If more Bernie supporters showed up or if he actually grew his base from 2016 then he would be the nominee instead of Biden.
I actually like my insurance.  My parents love the insurance they have.  They have union insurance and that's one of the major reasons they're supporting Biden.
Biden sure wasn't my first choice but I will vote for his ass even with my dying breath to get rid of the current disgrace of a president ‚úåÔ∏è
It‚Äôs not going to b safe for a long time. He better give it up  BIDEN 2020. The election is the first week of November. I‚Äôll mail in my vote as soon as I get it I. The mail
I finally figured you out. You want Trump to win because if Biden wins then his VP has a leg up on 2024. If Trump wins then  has a better shot. How selfish to not care about the Americans suffering immensely under the idiot in chief. Stop being so na√Øve.
Have you read about Biden's policy proposals or how he's working with Bernie on a tax plan? These are views and policies I support:
Biden's handlers should be ashamed of themselves!
You got another thing coming for the next 4 yrs BIDEN 2020. You think your better than him. Your a liar a cheat. Did you hear Obama today? You don‚Äôt know how to speak. Your time you spend at the podium leaves a lot to be desired.

We need REAL leadership in the White House ‚Äî not reality TV ‚Äúleadership‚Äù.   We need Joe Biden.
With that said I will vote for Biden, then all of my fury will be directed 2wards Joe Biden and Democrats that think like him. Pelosi and crew has done little for working people. Their lack of leadership has been on full display. Cant do half measures in this climate
Ted we know your under pressure from China to do everything to help steal this election but mail in voting is not the same as absentee voting.  There have been numerous reports on just how fraudulent mail in voting is.  I'm sorry if you have no confidence in Biden winning fairly.
I‚Äôm voting because theres too much at risk with Trump. I will STILL challenge Biden heavily because he is not very progressive.  I‚Äôm not going to shame other Black people into voting. Because yes our system is shit no matter who runs it and we all challenge it in different ways.
For the next debate? How about asking questions from a HS history book to discuss Government and American History. Biden would ace that.
I‚Äôm a Mom for Biden. Who are you, again? Actually, I don‚Äôt care. My point is: you are very, very wrong.
When Biden takes power is time to split the party. It‚Äôs the best time, no point waiting until 2028 or 2032 to ‚Äúreform the Democrats‚Äù
Great question, Stephen. Most of us Biden voters are just hoping to salvage whatever's left of the country that Trump and his enabling cult members haven't destroyed and don't have the luxury for subtle nuance of rhetorical political nonsense from the right. Hope that helps.
Joe Biden &amp; Wall Street Pete beg to differ.
If your kitchen were on fire, would you insist on using Brita-filtered, boiled, distilled water to put out the fire? No? Then don‚Äôt vote for the ‚Äúperfect candidate,‚Äù but rather the one (Biden) who will put out the dumpster fire that is 2020 America
I‚Äôm a mom and I‚Äôm all for #JoeBiden  is literally trying to kill all of us.  And then pass the blame. He‚Äôs a weak little man and Biden is a real leader. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #ObamaIsBetterAtEverything
And Biden doesn‚Äôt know what year it is.... which would you choose
It‚Äôs so crazy you put this up  What you are calling ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs America‚Äù is actually tRUMPS AMERICA NOW!!! Wake tf up !! And put a DAMN MASK ON
Let the Democrats and their media pals enjoy themselves with their phony polls!  The full court press on Joe Biden is going to be awesome!
It‚Äôll be warp speed if Biden wins.
I hope this flies too. What i like ehre, and Biden is trying to stop, Trump's threat to the US.

Vote for Joe Biden. Restore the soul of this country and return to civility and the rule of law.
Really impressed by  I‚Äôve been critical of the Biden campaign for over a year (mostly because they wouldn‚Äôt hire me), but hiring her was one of their best moves.
Devin Nunes and other Trump Loyalists received intelligence packets from Ukraine that probably contain allegations of Biden wrong-doing. The FBI is informed of this illegal action and are doing nothing.  Maybe we should ask   ?
Did I say Biden was perfect? Also Trump was friends with Epstein and wished Ghislane Maxwell well in her trial if you want to go there.
Will you finish the Great Wall of tRUmp before President Biden knocks it down?
I hope this flies. What I like here, and Biden knows, Obama trolls Trump in every way.
OK--I understand, but tactically it's not at all clear that Dems don't do better for the country and themselves by seizing the day. Yes. I agree we risk yo-yo governance. OTOH there are enormous risks in continuing to be held hostage saboteurs.  A failed Biden term leads to what?
And just to remind folks who Biden is working for &amp; why he won't endorse #M4All
propaganda machine pence. How can you a religious godly man lie so egregiously?! While Biden was VP for8 years America prospered safely, much more so than under u and trump.! Defund the police is not an insult to police and does not mean eradicate police; anything but! Resign
Fuk breaks. I‚Äôm not taking a break because that shithead is making us miserable.   He‚Äôs done. Let‚Äôs move this along already. I don‚Äôt GAF if I have to stand in line for three days.   I‚Äôm going to drag a Republican by the leg and make them vote for Biden, too.
Biden is great. ‚ÄúSettle‚Äù denotes he‚Äôs not First Choice.

Not that I say that's a concrete thing, Biden calling upon Bernie.  But it's a high likelihood.  The reason I want Biden is not because I hate Trump (I do), but because I know Biden will surround himself with people RIGHT for the job, unlike what Trump did.
Well, I can't disagree with you there.  Bernie was the guy that America needed, and unfortunately he was shafted yet again.  The good thing though is that Bernie and Biden are VERY close, and Biden winning almost certainly means Bernie will be heavily involved during his term.
Like, if Trump attempted to do a coup, the coup would straight up consist of him tweeting a thing, and then every Republican in Congress pretending they hadn't read it, the whole federal government not doing anything, and then Biden becomes president.
Trump is talking about rigging elections he had it rigged in 2016 he scared because he knows he‚Äôs gonna lose to Biden so now he wants to stop vote by mail all of a sudden it‚Äôs a scam he‚Äôs so damn scared because he knows he‚Äôs going to lose this election to Biden
Biden? yes
dirt on Biden. My take people will go as far as you let them.
I hope Biden wins and we get better options in 4 years.
You are a ignorant piece of shit but I forgive you because I realized that you like Joe Biden have Dementia and are not responsible for your stupidity  and obnoxious behavior. Your blob like mouth oozes with bullshit so why don't you resign and spare us your crap
i have no idea.... i don't want Biden or any dem.
Ngl it‚Äôs funny seeing people now saying this is bullshit. Like, yeah, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been for years. And sure that‚Äôs no reason to endorse the corrupt system, but right now abiding by it is the best option. Biden isn‚Äôt the best option, but he‚Äôs the best option we‚Äôve got.
My dude, you think people who had Biden as their # 2 really would have flipped to Bernie with the wave of that Warren wand? These people don't even want her as VP now. I get the disappointment but please, get real.
We will have enough info by 11 pm Eastern Standard Time that Joe Biden won in a landslide!
I hope it does, because it will Insure a Biden win!
You really disapprove of Biden THAT much?
This is not true, and we have all been through this argument 1000 times. Warren's support was 50/50 between Biden and Bernie. She was not going to change the game. Please, knock this shit off.
So Biden is an idiot?
Can't wait to see the military drag him out the White House kicking and screaming. Obama will have to swear Biden into office. LOL
Because Biden will be the end of America.
He's capable of anything, but not sure here. I feel certain he enjoys the attention, provoking "the libs", taking attention away from Lewis/Obama, stuff like that. He &amp; GOP may be content with wrecking the country for Biden and the Dems, then sitting back to plot the next step.
To your first point, yes, we should be talking about how dems are not necessarily the ‚Äògood guys‚Äô and are guilty of the same corruption that Warren is fighting against‚Äî including Biden‚Äî hence the tepid response.
Not everyone on the left is "far left"... which is why Biden won (he's not far left). It's a big tent. And it mostly still believes in voting and democracy, which is a plus.
You're right on the issue but not sure why you have to be racist. Black people have no clue either how much this has ripped apart their communities, they think it's cops doing it to them. They're so dumb they voted for Joe Biden, who spent most of his career ass-fucking them.
Done
Did PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN approve this....he will be the sitting PRESIDENT AS OF JANUARY
Joe Biden-s Racial Economic Equity Plan Would Invest $150 Billion in Minority Businesses -
Decriminalization is bullshit. Legalize it or no vote. The fact that he can't even commit to legalizing weed when that's such a basic request is why we don't care about Biden. He's offering literally nothing.
You know what's a great priority? M4A, UBI, a GND. You know who doesn't give a fuck? Biden.
You might enjoy enough privilege to survive Biden but countless people don't.
No it does not imply any such thing the only people professing that they don't care about millions suffering are the people voting for Biden and acting like everything will be okay again.
96 days to the election and I‚Äôm voting for Biden because he understands the gravity of this pandemic and is encouraging vote by mail as a way to safely vote on November 3rd! But thanks Trump for trying to stall the election...good try
Letting Biden win is not a good strategy.
Biden is not center left. Bernie is center left. Biden is far right.
You are the only one bending reality. There is absolutely no chance we're getting any progressive policies out of Biden.
His work as VP was horrendous. If you want to sell us on the idea of Biden maybe don't invoke his record as it pretty much all sucks.
Biden is a real and present danger. There's no chance in hell we're going to vote for him.
Trump is clearly delusional. He needs a competency evaluation asap. #TrumpFailedAmerica #COVID19 #WorstPresidentEver #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
So is Joe Biden.
Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden
yeah no question. Biden is way more culpable, she served in a prison state that he helped build. only thing grinding my gears is this trying to erase her hardassed prosecutor history
We don't have a Democracy. We haven't had one in decades. Voting Biden isn't going to bring it back.
When Biden is Inaugurated I hope the MSM does us all a  favor and not report on anything Trump unless he or his family is charged with a crime and arrested. We've #HADENOUGH!

But isn't that how it usually works? Biden will gladly take from a smart woman without giving her the due credit.
"Shit, I'm going to lose to Joe fucking Biden...I'll move the elections because that will work in my favor...somehow!"Hey joe Biden stop fucking around and select  as next on line.
Short of endorsing Biden it's #toolittetoolate
I feel like political ads for instance are like...soooo slanderous in their own nature. Why do I keep seeing these YouTube ads of clearly chopped up audio of Biden saying ‚ÄúYes, absolutely yes‚Äù about defunding the police and some little kid saying ‚Äúmommy I‚Äôm scared‚Äù
Im so glad we have Biden. Can't The wait for the debates. Biden will definately overwhelm Trump with his quick wit and his command of the facts.
No one should have to call him out. It's appalling that Biden hasn't put a stop to it and there's nothing wrong with expecting our candidate to step up against misogyny. I don't think anyone has campaigned harder for Joe than Kamala. She deserves better from him.
Ed Rendell's take on Biden's VP choice is about as useful and relevant as Rick Santorum's take on the same.
I saw a Biden ad on MSNBC last night and in a brief second they show Biden jogging down a ramp.  I literally LOL'ed.  So subtle but effective.

Hey, he's the one that will be running this country if Biden wins.   #ObamaGateIsReal
Thats a good question. Maybe team Biden couldn't prep his lookalike in time? Or maybe they didn't want him to have to answer any questions?  #WheresHunter
The questions now  is what we will do once Trumpism is rejected in the Tsunami that will hit the GOP in November.  How will we use the four years of a Biden Presidency to rebuild our party into something better?  We‚Äôve lost our way.   We let the ugliest among  us,  define  us.
I guess one of the big questions is after Trumpism is rejected in a humiliating Tsunami in November, how will we use the next four years of a Biden Presidency to rebuild the GOP back into something Abe Lincoln would be proud of?  We let the ugly among us define us.  What now?
Yes we are gonna wing BIG!! What are u gonna be doing when Biden takes over?
Hillary was awful at getting the people on the fence to vote for her.  I'm not saying Biden is good, but Trump is awful too.
Had a Trumper try to convince me not to voter for Biden.  Told him I was a 1 issue voter, I want Trump out of office.  Biden too old? Don't care.  Biden sniffs girls hair? Don't care. Biden son and Burisma? Don't care.  They really get frustrated when you tell them you don't care
I do not like Biden... I will vote for him as a default, but I just hate Trump. Your typical democrat insults don‚Äôt work on me... I don‚Äôt care...in fact you got nothing so you are making this is fun..enjoy the knowledge I am dropping on you. You argued with the wrong Republican..

He knows that when Joe Biden takes office, one of the first agenda items will be to investigate the last 4 years of the Trump presidency, his family, his associates... everything.  For all that we know now, just wait until we discover what we don't.
All Democrats, including Biden, are against the murder of trump supporters. There isn‚Äôt a need for murder since they will take care of it themselves.
I find it funny in these trump commercials of ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù that they‚Äôre showing literal footage of Trumps America...
Wonder if Biden will just ask Obama to be his VP
DEFINITELY! Watching the F&amp;M polls this morning, 50% of people said if the election was today, they‚Äôd vote for Biden. Only 41% Trump and the rest undecided or neither. ü§ûüèª

Spanky is going out of his way to make sure that Putin gets whatever he wants. Biden should have him thoroughly investigated when he wins the election in November.
Joshua: A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.
It is so obvious that Biden is just a pawn! WAKE UP AMERICA!
They should be. She'd be a disaster.
Ohhhhh &amp; all of the shitbag protesters &amp; rioters COMPLETELY understand the entire point of BLM?  I don‚Äôt expect you to understand, but if Biden wins YOU my friend will then understand BLM= Democrat ploy!!
GET YOUR FEDERAL TROOPS OUT OF PORTLAND NOW!!!! YOU ARE NOT A PRESIDENT BUT A DICTATOR!!!!! WE WILL NOT HAVE THAT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!!! BIDEN HAS A HELLA MESS TO CLEAN UP CUZ OF YOU DAMMIT!!!! FUCK YOU TRUMP AND THE HORSE YOU RODE IN ON!!!
Sure, but we wouldn‚Äôt even be having the conversation about Medicare for all without the Affordable Care Act and Biden *does* want to expand it. Is it enough? No. But it‚Äôs clearly a step in the right direction and we should keep pushing for more.

Saw my first Biden yard sign this morning close to the LGH health campus. #necivgov
That sounds like people who have not heard Biden speak without notes. Clueless!
Once again...  I don‚Äôt believe in the two party system. So I will not be voting for Biden either. He is just as trashy as Trump. I HIGHLY recommend getting to know your independent candidatesüëçüèæ
Sowing the seeds of doubt about the legitimacy of the result. That way, he wins either way. Either they litigate his way to a second term, or he makes a fortune in right-wing media telling his faithful that he was robbed and Biden is failing at everything.
Most of us are not comfortable with bumbling Biden the Creepy Sleepy Uncle Joe. &amp; whoever he ;picks they will make a diabolical duo! MAGA KAG 2020 &amp; May GOD be with us!
If he were right, Biden would be polling by a landslide. Unfortunately, he continues his pattern of an exaggerated distortion of facts in a pathetic attempt to manipulate his followers into coming to his defense out of pity.
Biden's notes suggest Kamala Harris may be his chosen running mate: reports  #FoxNews Dear GOD the worst 2 anyone could ask for! MAGA KAG 2020 or we are DOOMED!
Biden is what we need now, as he is the only sane choice.  Two choices on November 3rd....choose wisely.
And Biden looked great today. How about trump promoting a witch doctor today?  Sad. Talk about madness!  trump is a failure.
And that is just what our Nation needs now. Certainly won‚Äôt be progressive enough, but Biden will create stability through leadership. The trump tweets this morning, followed by the press conference later, was a prime example of why we need change! üá∫üá∏

Biden vows to fight racial inequalities with economic agenda
In case anyone wondered why Bernie ran for Prez and why I ran as a delegate of his.  We both support these things, meaning we are both more popular than the Dems and Joe Biden rn.  When all you are is blue no one will vote for you.
Cmon man I know the answer you expect but here‚Äôs one....there is a nationwide SILVER alert posted for Joe Biden today, he escaped frI‚Äôm his basement unattended, whereabouts unknown!
Its the defund police cause. And Biden backs it.
No one should be bashing Biden. He needs all of our support. #VoteTrumpOut  #JoeBiden2020
You need to shut the fuck up about this because we will find EVERYTHING BAD to say about you just so your supporters see who you really are!!!! YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER 150,000 AMERICANS DEAD!!!! YOU WILL BE PUNISHED FOR THIS!!! BIDEN WILL WIN THE ELECTION MARK MY WORDS!!!!
Biden would be the closest thing
Dom, My idea for the cardboard cutouts at the ballpark is Karl Marx flanked by Biden and Sanders.
Click-bait headline. Biden won't pick Susan Rice.
I mean practically all the white politicians voted for the crime bill and many to this day have denounced it. We know what a Trump America looks like. People that would prefer Biden are not saying so because they are thrilled with him. We just don't need a leader like Trump.
And consequently make up a larger portion of student debt as the Biden camp so ingenuously points out.
Next Biden will ‚Äúend violence against women‚Äù and don‚Äôt worry ladies he‚Äôs going to ‚Äúprotect and empower woman around the world‚Äù
This is the most male centric m. Mansplanning womensnagenda I‚Äôve ever seen, don‚Äôt worry ladies Biden will, ‚ÄúHelp women navigate work and families.‚Äù Because clearly you need his advice on how to do both.
Since the majority of this nation‚Äôs discontent centers around Donald Trump‚Äòs incompetence, devisive  rhetoric, and bungling of the coronavirus response, his removal would bring about civil rest.   Joe Biden, ultimately, is the ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù candidate.

Are there really "hidden" Trump voters?  Don't you think in red states that there might be a ton of "hidden" Biden voters?  And after all of this, how is there any "undecided" voters.
Loving this Biden smear campaign where the videos have the text "Defund the police?" and then play a clip of Biden saying "Yes!"
Leave it alone. You will be gone soon.  Let Flotus Dr. Jill Biden handle it.
The polls look good for Biden, and I would never suggest anyone not vote for Biden at this point. But relying on one election to stop a facist movement that has shown how easily they can attack us citizens without consequence is irresponsible.

AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
These ‚Äúin Joe Biden‚Äôs America ads‚Äù are really just...awful. Family calling 911 and no one is there to answer. Like you think ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù means ‚Äúfire dispatchers?‚Äù. Y‚Äôall had your brains shopvacced out of your ear at a young age.
Biden and Trump are not the same. Dems and Reps are not the same. It does matter who you vote for in November. Voting third party is your right but clearly you haven‚Äôt been paying attention. We‚Äôre 99 days out from Election Day, emerse yourself on the issues and vote.
If you vote for Biden, taxes will increase, government will waste more money, strategic power with Russia and China will worsen, and Ukraine will get less help from us.

I keep reminding everyone I know that complacency has no place in this election. Everyone must vote. Complacency/not voting=a vote for Trump. Writing in anyone who is not Joe Biden=a vote for Trump.
Well you're right about one thing. We do want Joe Biden to win in November. Our country cannot take another 4 years of Trumpism.

Okay, but let‚Äôs take a look at the five current candidates from a more logical angle.  Okay?  Compared to Trump and Biden, Bernie has more interests in improving our country than ‚Äúthe lesser of two evils,‚Äù or as I like to call them, ‚ÄúGiant Douche and Turd Sandwich‚Äù.  (1/2)

I wish all 11,460 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN
Do what you have to, but ill brag in your face when Biden wins.
Ha you keep telling yourself that, I hope you are right,I see it, it‚Äôs not gd. I‚Äôve watched every town in U.S. turn into rust buckets in the last 30 yrs.Start was NAFTA/Clinton, final nail was Biden/China.Textile Steel Furniture  Auto Pharm etc gone Millions of jobs, it‚Äôs bad now
America?  Or Trump.  You are going to have to choose.  The Democrats gave you Joe Biden, who you know and can easily vote for.  The other choice has been a miserable failure, and has hurt our country.  Choose wisely.
America, or Trump.  The Democrats gave you someone entirely plausible to vote for; you know Joe Biden.  Are you a patriot?  Or are you one of few left who thinks Trump is fit for the job.
Im also hearing the GOP said Biden could actually win Texas this year
Biden also won PA and thats HUGE
Biden is so right about that

Wow‚Ä¶ Why doesn't any news outlet truly grill Biden?
Bill Mitchell   ¬∑ 3m Is it true that Joe Biden's sign-language interpreters have a higher than average rate of attempted suicide?  Replying to
I don‚Äôt Oppose Biden taking it if requested. Apparently his Dr did not request it. I guess, and I can only hypothesize that his DR didn‚Äôt require it. However, it was administered to Trump. And let‚Äôs be real. He bragged about it twice now. It‚Äôs embarrassing....
I don‚Äôt think you are getting that I am not democrat or really like Biden. I really just oppose Trump, Barr, Mitch, and Lindsey
I feel like with everything else he does he projects. He‚Äôs a big time liar. He‚Äôs been caught so many times. Also, I don‚Äôt even really like a Biden. I just cannot get behind the weird ideology. Why put a crown on a Trump pic or make his head on Rocky‚Äôs body. It‚Äôs weird.
Biden or no one. I think Biden is a terrible candidate and I really don't like him, but he is light years ahead of Trump. I understand not voting in 2020 but I really can't respect unabashed Christian support of Trump.
If Biden wins MI, WI, and PA, he‚Äôs the next prez.
I watched the Biden-Obama video just released and wanted to cry listening to Obama. We had a highly intelligent, relatable &amp; responsible prez. Now we have crazy 3rd grader. üò´
Many Trump fans in my hometown - letter to editor today said that Trump was born again &amp; God's appointed pick for our leader. Said on Judgement Day, Trump will fare better than Biden. I must be practicing a different form of Christianity than the writer of that letter.
No thanks to you.  We‚Äòd  be done with this and back to work already if ‚ÄùRepublicans‚Äù like you didn‚Äôt call it a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù and sneer at masks.  Now you‚Äôre cutting benefits to people out of a job because of what you did, saying they are ‚Äùlazy.‚Äù  Done.      I‚Äôm voting for Biden.
Idk, the funny thing is is that these people have built it up in their minds that Biden is going to be worse than Trump with acuity that they have actually created this level of expectations that I think is going to massively backfire on them
Right!!! Lincoln was NOT AND NEVER WOULD BE A TRUMP SUPPORTER. He would support Joe Biden and in 2016 Hillary I'm sure.
Nice that Trump is pushing this.  The "end of the suburbs" to Trump is affordable housing.  This is not a dog-whistle; this is a bullhorn.  "Vote for me or Biden will let brown people live near you."
If you want to drive a Trumper bonkers tell him that you heard Biden plans on putting Obama into a position in his cabinet.    #Resist #RidinWithBiden #ImVoting4BidenBecause
biden is a complete horses ass
Biden all the fucking way!!!! #BlueWave2020 #Biden2020Landslide #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Followed all and thank you sis last night for the shoutout. You do a hella great job bringing #Resisters together. You are like the leader tbh. LOVE YOU LOTS &lt;3
I'm not sure why a Biden Admin should allow FoxNews access to the White House. It sacrificed what little credibility it had for Trump (like the GOP), and is nothing more than propaganda for right-wing authoritarian whackos. It does immense damage and deserves no legitimacy.
Biden has proven racist acts in his past, Trump does not, it‚Äôs only Democrats and Democrat propaganda media who say it.  Beyond that, Biden‚Äôs mind is shot, and he can barely speak coherently for 3 minutes, that‚Äôs why he basically in hiding, and others  speak for him.
Don‚Äôt you love how all the monday morning quarterbacks like CNN and Biden, tell you they could have done better.  But they don‚Äôt say how, just bash others.  Again, CNN is not news, is Democrat propaganda, and it‚Äôs embarrassing.When Biden is president you will not see this
I don't give a shit what people have you work for it and earn it then all is good as long as it is legal. If I hate a person it will be for their attitude not their skin color, skin color hate is what racism is. And that is not me and I support Trump. But on COVID-19 I go Biden.
Biden should challenge Trump to a debate regarding corona virus policies. That way both candidates can explain their policies in detail.
Is Trump threatening America with war if Joe Biden wins?
It's not an opinion. Biden and the Democrap party do not stand for the issues that I feel strongly about. Why would I continue to vote for one? It's asinine to continue to vote for status quo.
Not supporting Biden is not supporting Biden.
Sorry, no. That not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump bullshit is just that, bullshit. A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump. I'll be voting Green again this year. So my vote for the Green party candidate is a vote for the Green party candidate.
There are enough people on the left who will vote for the letter in ( ) after a name regardless of who that is. Also, I have no doubt some registered Republicans will be voting for Biden. Middle of the road liberals aren't going to be an issue.
Joe Biden is a Trojan horse full stop. #MAGA
Healthcare workers for Biden
"Radical Identity Politics," in my opinion, uses a mix of Identity and Leninism to bring Governments to heel.   Obama isn't doing this RN, but the WSJ is pointing out that he's getting close. Scary as he'll be at the TOP of the Biden ticket.

Weatherford cartoon: Biden and China
Just need Joe Biden to stay alive until then.
If they can manage to get enough votes to pass both chambers and land on President Biden's desk he could sign the bill making the popular vote the law of the land. If they can pull this off the country is lost. Then only New York, California, Texas &amp; Florida votes will count.
He was living his life as a free American, making his own decisions and deciding what personal risks to take. He was not hiding in his basement like Biden. People get the virus every day. If I am one of them, I want to get it at a Trump rally‚Äînot at a Satancratic riot.
He had a delicious Joe Biden at the Kingswood Community Center. That's a joke, I don't know where I am.
Based on polls, Biden is 95 days away from humiliating Trump and his followers and they're going to impeach him again now?
Devin Nunes declines to say whether he received foreign information meant to damage Biden
What did Biden do to you? Here I'm clueless?
Biden! Because I'm saying I'm voting for Biden to avoid scrutiny while actually voting Trump.
FIRST: Trump and the entire GOP began to tank in the polls. Here in PA, Trump is trailing Biden by 7 points and I‚Äôm within single digits of Mike Kelly.  (THREAD)
You mean the Biden that people are saying that he's going senile Biden? GTFO with your conspiracy theory!
I hope it is only real Americans are true Blue Republicans! And Everything but COVID-19 Trump got right. But for my health I must vote Biden but if Trump wins I'm content. I just don't want to pull a suicide lever. COVID-19  is my true enemy! üòîüòîüòî
Do you ever do real work? Or do you just tweet your life away while Americans are dying because you dont know how to lead?  Joe Biden knows so much more than you. He knows how to serve his county, no bonespurs for him! He also loves America. You only love you.
I thought picking between Trump and Hillary was rough, but Biden and Trump might be worse. How is Biden the best the democratic party has to offer? Out political system is a joke.
NO CHANCE!! Biden 2020 üá∫üá∏
President Biden will change that
We will have one in January President Biden
You're quote tweeting James Woods mocking Biden...  God you aren't bright.   PS I thought the virus was less deadly than the flu or pneumonia, pops.
Biden = White Supremacist P.O.S.   It will always stand that way and never change. Biden is the pure definition of "WHITE TRASH"
what if Joe Biden wins?
Just another stab at Trump. Democrats are so full of Hatred they are backing a White Supremacist for the Presidency in Joe Biden.   I will go and vote Joe Biden on November 3, 2020 over COVID-19. But I do not like Biden, I never will and if he wins I will cry.
It‚Äôs not Trump‚Äôs America you dunce. It‚Äôs Democrat run cities, so you have proven our point that you are evil. Able to watch your own cities burn for political gain because Biden is a terrible candidate... shame on you.
Yet on Biden's record you should look it up. If you claim Black Lives Matter than you would not be voting for Biden because his whole career has been set against people of color. His 1994 Crime Bill with the well known Racist Strom Thurmond proves that.
Haha, you're so scared to lose to Biden
Biden is a racist, you cannot see that. He is spinning blacks like a top. Selecting a woman of color to be his running mate is manipulating the black voter despite all his past racist statements, gestures and gaffes.
I‚Äôm one of your biggest fans would love a response and your opinion on if you think the Democrats will actually somehow let Joe Biden slide and get out of debating? I‚Äôd love to see it because there‚Äôs no way Trump would not just destroy him
Bad mistake on his part this virus is an Aerosolized pathogen which makes it highly contagious, is why the spikes in cases are so high. Wear the mask it's better than nothing. Also we must Vote Biden because Trump is not approaching this Virus seriously.
So go to the polls and vote and when you do and Die not my problem. I will vote for Joe Biden over COVID-19 if I can vote by mail if not I vote for no one. It's not worth my life.
it seems like the only commercials I can't skip on Youtube are ones trashing Joe Biden and trying to install fear into people. That's annoying, guess I'll just stop watching YouTube for awhile.
I heard that too and I hope to God that happens because they could be a smaller version of what happens to America if Joe Biden gets elected. We can‚Äôt let the left take the Senate and the White House.
How long are we gonna do this song and dance? This does not prove he is racist what this is is a block on the planned attack on the suburbs from Joe Biden. I‚Äôm sorry but who thinks low income housing in the middle of the suburban neighborhoods is a good idea
Thank you for not allowing Biden‚Äôs terrible attack on the suburbs to go through
This also shows they are not confident that Biden can win without special help so no one should pay attention to the polls saying he‚Äôs ahead. Why suggest the need to change the voting method to a method that could lead to more fraud unless you weren‚Äôt confident in your candidate.
Is there a particular reason we do not hear anything regarding Biden sexually assaulting the staff worker or how he had the prosecutor fired in the Ukraine or he was going to withhold money. Thought maybe I was dreaming and this was unreal
You are is delusional and the rest laughed what they did to borrow yesterday was ridiculous especially when he has for a bathroom break you people are so delusional no one in their right mind would ever elect Joe Biden let alone his running mate Kamala Harris let‚Äôs face it
Enjoy it now because it‚Äôll never last Biden doesn‚Äôt have a brain let alone any running mate that‚Äôs were talking about and if it‚Äôs Kamala Harris the hate towards her is worse than the hate towards Trump can‚Äôt wait for you people when Trump wins reelection what are you gonna do joy
Trump is a great President just not on COVID-19 but everything else he is spot on. With Joe Biden you will put a racist in office. "I do not want my kids growing up in a jungle, a racial Jungle." 1977 Joe Biden on Desegregation debate.
So true Biden made that claim but hell they ignore all his racist gaffes anyhow!
Yep welcome to the New CCP. Once Biden wins freedom of speech is dead in America, quite possibly worse. Look for a Coup to overthrow our Government system.
Honestly not sure who to vote for. I vote for county more then party.   I am not a huge Trump fan but Joe Biden literally did not know what city he was in today or what year it was.   Just can‚Äôt believe these two are the best we have.   #usa #maybethingsgetbetterin2024
A strong Vice President. If Trump is re-elected the next four years will be hell and anything he does could effect us (particularly young people) for years to come. Please, just consider voting for Biden. Thanks for taking the time to read this.
I'm gonna vote like biden Is 50 points behind
The next president will be choosing her replacement. The court is already stacked with conservative justices. That replacement and the make-up of the court will effect you and all young people for decades. Also, unlike Trump, Biden will surround himself with strong people. And
I have sons in their early 20s. I absolutely understand what you‚Äôre saying. Many conversations with them about this exact issue. And yeah, I‚Äôm not thrilled with Biden either. That being said, please look at the bigger picture. RBG isn‚Äôt going to be able to work for much longer.
wait, isn't that kinda what most VP's do, even Biden?
Enjoy President Biden
Yes Biden has become delusional
Regardless of the whole Demon Sperm thing...it‚Äôs funny how Joe Biden (a white man) isn‚Äôt being raked over the coals for calling a black female doctor ‚Äúa crazy woman...she‚Äôs a disgrace‚Äù. Remember when DJT called Hillary ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and all you woke white broads lost your mind?
I'm not an expert, but my gut says that a vote for nihilism is probably not necessarily a vote for Biden, so I'm with it.
Why would Congressman Clayburn support him?Why are so many African Americans supporting Biden. Research what Trump did pertaining to Obama and BLM
Trump 2020 for real Biden 2020 for COVID-19   You vote Biden you give power to Marxist Terror groups BLM &amp; Antifa so yes choose wisely. Biden is really tied to Russia &amp; China!
Well, with Rachel coming down to tell us what he *actually* meant, why do we need Biden to speak?
Trump deserves his protection he earned it and if Joe Biden wins then we are in real serious trouble.
Did Biden form a complete sentence or did Jeff Dunham have his arm rammed up his ass working him like a puppet?
You still can‚Äôt give me any actual proof, when there are tons of gaffes about Biden. I rest my case
While I think she's a bad choice for VP because Berners and the center right don't like her, this is a dumb reason.   I think she should be AG should Biden win.
Interestingly enough Erie was in this, and it went 7-2 Biden including 4 Obama-Trump voters.  You would think that would be noteworthy that a usually blue county that flipped in a usually blue state had this kind of change, but that doesn't get rage clicks lol.
Also my town was in this, 7-2 Biden.  Which is interesting for a PA county Trump narrowly won in '16
Trump has lost his economic edge over Biden
I‚Äôd be a hypocrite if I denied a trump gaffe but I haven‚Äôt seen any. Plus I have seen the interview you‚Äôre referring to. There is no mistake at least none like Biden. In fact trump is pushing for school choice which will help the less fortunate including blacks.
So you get mad about baffling Biden &amp; attack trump because you can‚Äôt believe Biden isn‚Äôt lucid? Not our fault or trumps. If you can show me a verbal mishap of trump I‚Äôll be happy to acknowledge it. But you people get pisssed &amp; can‚Äôt acknowledge Biden‚Äôs failing mental state
If Biden has it what do you call the Quisling Trump?  Notice most of the Congressional black caucus are Democrats.
Whatever there‚Äôs no point in talking about mental states because all you fucking Dems for whatever reason still believe Biden is all there when it is factually evident he‚Äôs not by audio and video you can look it up there are tons of gaffes on YouTube
Oh but you can find Biden introducing himself as Joe Biden‚Äôs husband
Biden is on his road to dementia and AOC is as dense as a rock. She doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about she thinks that a policeless world is the suburbs. She is one of the dumbest people in politics I‚Äôm sorry if that offends you but it‚Äôs just true
I'm not going to try to help you, because I'm going to vote for Joe Biden. I hope when you lower people's prescription prices that it's not just like 50 or 60 cents. That's a joke. Also, people are mad because you have not been a president for everyone, just your chosen few.
DUMBEST POTUS EVER!!! Biden 2020üá∫üá∏
...if they will find a way to "Blow" this one.   All Biden surrogates should "STOP" right on the "spot," if they feel that an Action could draw further Attention to Biden's forgetfulness.
Brenan's mind must be 'Shot' if he can't even remember the major milestones of his career. Sometimes you look at the Biden Campaign and just wonder...  "Ex-CIA director Brennan writes in upcoming memoir that Trump blocked access to records and notes."
I kept telling everyone when I was in Cleveland this weekend to vote by mail because he doesn't want us to.  Everyone at my nephews party live in Ohio and all said they are voting for Biden. Hopefully they will by mail
I‚Äôm in no way shape or from a Biden supporter. I just need that fugly oompa loompa out of office. Even if that means replacing him with someone slightly less awful as him ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I‚Äôm well aware of how creepy and disgusting Biden is, but I‚Äôm sorry I only have two choices what do you expect me to do? Vote for someone who has absolutely no chance at winning? That‚Äôs a vote for trump in my eyes. That a vote wasted in my eyes
I'm seeing Biden signs in a lot of blue collar suburbs.  The GE plant neighborhoods here.  Zito / Arande territory.
I agree, Biden should flip enough of the suburbs, although given covid in Florida I could see Biden's lead being bigger there than PA.
Waffling on fracking/coal will hurt Biden in PA too, although I think he'll flip the suburbs enough to win it.
By God, this beats everything, absolutely every crazy thing Trump has ever tweeted does not compare with this one. And to think that people have any worries about Joe Biden. Oh my, this is a first.
I'm not sure people really associate this with Biden.  These are scenes from Trump's America.
Also, given the disastrous COVID response, I could absolutely see Biden polling better in Florida than PA.  The cult is strong here.
I mean Biden has *gained* two points in NC.  But I still don't think the protests are making anything better at this point.
I think it‚Äôs mind-boggling that Joe Biden is the culmination of everything wrong with our political system, but Trump has still somehow found a way to be worse.
I think you're talking about the Democratic Party. It runs the gamut from radical left, liberal, progressive, moderate, and conservative. Democrats are much more than one man or party, and Biden is a decent man.
Joe Biden making jokes about his diminished mental capacity = 4D chess
We will have to shut down again and the people spreading these conspiracies about #TrumpVirus not being serious and fake cures are responsible for this lasting into the Biden administration.
Biden photographed with Kamala Harris talking points as running mate speculation grows
Shouldn‚Äôt you be hiding in the basement with Biden?
Have there been any boat parades for Biden?
Biden says he will choose his running mate next week
63 Days until the world sees Joe Biden live on TV with no where to hide himself
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden said Tuesday he will choose his vice presidential running mate next week. Biden has said he will choose a female running mate, and has faced pressure within the party to choose a woman of color.
This isn‚Äôt FUCKING FUNNY! Democrat mayors are watching their cities burn &amp; they don‚Äôt care because the worse the economy looks the better the chance Joe Biden‚Äôs Husband has
I don‚Äôt know which world you live in but the world respects trump. Biden is losing his mind
Joe Biden can't find the little boys room to go pee pee cause he doesn't remember where it is.. He is too busy sniffing little girls hair, like the pedophile he is... Not to mention he is a true RACIST.. Do your research.
52 USC 30121 Contributions and donations by foreign nationals  it doesn't have to be money but anything of value, Biden is of value. Trump asked China and Ukraine
The WSJ is suggesting that business and corporate Interests will Punish Biden if he doesn't come out AGAINST Portland Leninists, but in doing so Biden will jeopardize his standing with the base.   It won't. Everybody knows it is Barack in Power at the TOP.
Barack O'Biden built the Movement. To be fair, they built the peaceful protesting, but they used the worst of Identity Politics to do it. As an Outcome, we have Leninist Socialism taking place in Portland.
Lol.  No one has ever called Joe Biden a radical.
Right coming from the guy with Joe Biden as his iconü§£üòÜ. #4MoreYears#TrumpPence#WeWillWin
Biden‚Äôs campaign is trying to limit his speaking time...Trump won‚Äôt shut up and is great at making himself look like a dolt, especially right now. They‚Äôre hoping Lee‚Äôs is more with crazy uncle joe. Whoever his vp is will pickup a lot of mic time.
People in most states saw it. We knew. I asked our governor to consider holding back on reopening, because it was apparent that it was too soon. The president jumped the gun and kicked our science team to the curb. There are no more congratulations on mitigating, that's for sure.
Have a very hard time believing Biden is +7 in AZ and up in Texas and Georgia but only +3 in Minnesota
Which completely ignores my point about South Korea getting under control but good talk.    Trump was golfing and saying it would miraculously disappear when Biden wrote an article warning about it
In many ways I will cry. Because Joe Biden in the end (is) an extreme racist, he has a laundry list of extreme racist friends. He will be 10 times worse than Trump could ever be. So I will be very sad and heartbroken to see the road we will go down. üòîüòîüòî
98 days until the election, and Joe Biden still hasn't announced who the democrat nominee is going to be.
Seriously!!!  Sounds like something a Biden backer would say. Biden basically said same thing. If you don‚Äôt vote for me you ain‚Äôt black
"Trump is weak": Lincoln Project video shows conservative veteran making case for Biden
Indeed. That‚Äôs why we gotta get out and vote in numbers that absolutely cannot be mistaken to mean the country wants him out. Even if it is close with a Biden win, I think there are people whose job will be to force him out. üòÅ
Understandable. Even if it‚Äôs just long enough to help Biden get into office in November, we‚Äôll take every single electoral vote we can get.
So what about all of your unfair name calling of Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and now,Paul Ryan, who handed you your famous #TaxScam. You called John McCain every name in the book, and he was responsible for the pay raise and new equipment for vets, not you. You're never fair.
Get ready for 4 more years my 1 vote for Biden will not help
Biden will

Pretty soon you will be called President Biden
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ which ones. I'm a Republican only turned Democrat to support Bernie Sanders. Even donated $50 towards his campaign, will vote Biden Nov. 3 but I am still a Republican so do your best. üòÅ I love a challenge
Also to note there are Republicans who don't like his policies, especially me over COVID-19. There he is a screw up and on his wall blowing down that was a laugh cheap contractor's cutting corners! ü§£ Yet I will vote Biden, then go back to my Party and stay. Trump made me mad.
A 4 point Biden win should absolutely make up the 40k votes in PA, MI and WI  Always good to be vigilant tho

Pennsylvania for Biden landowners are getting ripped off by gas companies anyways taking away royalties most people are not happy with energy companies here BIDEN 2020 our wells are already fracked so ban it now
Trump election has what I‚Äôm calling the socialism put. He has a certain percentage of voters that will not vote for Biden on principle of socialism vs our political system.
So to be clear you wouldn't know who I was if I showed up at your front door but you've already decided I'm a racist? That says it all about the left in 2020. And if Biden wins I won't protest, riot, or throw a hissy fit. I'll just get up and go to work like every other day.
I have lived in Pennsylvania my entire life. We are a proud people. You may have conned the people once but not again. Pa. Is voting for Joe Biden.
A GREAT lesson for would-be capitalist politicians AND Moderate DEM candidates RN. Biden isn't going to save you. He is just a temporary 'stop-gap' to what the future DEM Party holds, social welfare programs, identity-based social programming, and free health care.
Can you say President Biden. Sounds great. How about  a Commander in Chief forum where vets and active duty ask the questions and Paul Reichkoff is the moderator
Joe is everything Trump is not. Joe at his worse is better than Trump at his best. I can not wait until I can say President Biden
If you think I‚Äôm not voting for my fellow Pennsylvanian, King , Joseph Biden that knows more about the state than you‚Äôd do than you‚Äôre out of your damn mind
Get you nose out of Pennsylvania. You are ruining enough things. Fracking and rogue oil wells have ruined the drinking water sources for many rural Pennsylvanians. #Biden will fix that. You have destroyed the necessary protections to our environment. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I‚Äôm from Pennsylvania. I will vote for Biden. You, mr. trump, are a fake, nasty, person undeserving my vote.
This is honestly the strongest argument in favor of voting for Biden I‚Äôve read.
From Donald Trump to Ted Yoho, Republicans are losing with women voters
Biden is suppressing Hispanic voters???
Literally every single person I know in PA including myself are voting for Biden... Sorry  Not sorry
He lacked Biden's raw sex appeal
Questions that will shape last 100 days of Biden vs. Trump campaign - Business Insider  Let me editorialize a list of questions about the election..
Actually,  this is exactly the year to do that. You vote for Trump or Biden and they win, you're culpable for what they do.  Own that.
My loyalties lie with truth. You should never convict by word of mouth but with proof. I am voting Biden over COVID-19 but does not mean I have to like him.
Worth noting as well Biden only needs to outperform Hillary by like 1% and he wins it.
Sadly, I‚Äôve seen 3 Biden signs but never have seen a Bigfoot. Rather think Bigfoot would be a better dem candidate than Biden; more honest anyway.
I feel this is more accurate than Biden +10 in PA.  The cult is strong here.
I just saw that Biden's America ad.   First, it idiotic as he's not president.   Second, it's a poorly done ad altogether.
It is his records that is the thing if Trump decides to start slinging mud Biden is in deep trouble. He can expose all of his sayings on the floor in the Senate, his once aired comments which are circulating now among Republicans and if this all comes out he is in for it.
Biden is the racist
It is ridiculous. How anyone can seriously think Bernie in Biden mask will heal this country is beyond me. I don't think they even think that, they just hate Trump.
I agree we need enforcement reform and major law reform. I don't think Biden is the guy for that. His answers usually include massive government expansion, where I think Trump represents at least the intention to shrink government.
Rizzo and Wrigley are campaigning for Joe Biden!
My Pennsylvania for Biden sign went up last week. My neighbor commented that this country can not survive 4 more years of Trump.
I‚Äôm a Biden fan. Also, Trumpers lost the credibility to call out anyone‚Äôs character when they backed a carnival barking scumbag because he ‚Äúsays what everyone is thinking.‚Äù
Same guy that says they don‚Äôt do politics, has made bloggers at his company take down political blogs and who‚Äôs company‚Äôs top podcast turned down a Biden interview recently because they were told the company doesn‚Äôt do politics.
On November 3, 2020 Joe Biden will win! This will be the date that will be Celebrated in Russia &amp; China! It will be America's turn to Extreme Leftist Fascist Dictatorship not unlike Hugo Chavez or Manuel Noriega the Panamanian Dictator. Freedom in America will die!
Sadly yes over COVID-19! I think Biden is a racist! He's a dirtbag and a crook, is being led on a leash by Ultra Left Wing thugs in Antifa &amp; BLM. But I have no choice but to vote Biden to give my life a chance to go on. Voting Biden is the most selfish thing I will ever do!
If you want to elect Joe Biden, we will go back rather than moving forward. Biden wants socialism, to continue this covid-19, allow more foreigners to arrive( us tax payers are paying them to be here), our freedom is gone!! It's your choice.
I can‚Äôt think of one bad thing about Biden.  Is he far enough left for me?  Probably not, but as a person he couldn‚Äôt be more decent.  And the other candidate has arrest warrants out for him and court cases and is a narcissist.  What is the comparison??
Trump has done well in every area but COVID-19 response, and to be fair to Trump slightly everyone got it wrong, Trump still does get it wrong! He lost my vote in 2020 over COVID-19, my health concerns, may God be my judge when I vote Biden for President,  I pray God has mercy!
The only office Biden will be in is the doctor's office getting treatment for his dementia.
It‚Äôs obvious that Drumpf only is ‚Äúworried‚Äùabout high crime in democratically run cities. He hasn‚Äôt sent his goons to Jacksonville, FL, where crime is also rampant. It‚Äôs all about politics. He just wants to intimidate Biden voters.

Even if it's off my that margin (and let's be honest, it's wrong) Biden wins by 5 or 6.
Biden specifically asked Obama not to endorse him until primaries were over, you dildo!
An interesting thing about those spry polls, if you take them at face, Biden still wins 277-261 (assuming NE and ME 2 go red and he wins all of Hillary's states)
Personally I think Biden is easier to vote for than Hillary, but yes same logic applies lol
Looking forward to saying President Biden. If you like President Obama you will love President Biden

They are right. This is how America will look under Biden. There was a time when the Democratic Party was actually okay. I didn't like their ideas but some were not bad but now the Democratic party is really scary like Joseph Stalin/Adolf Hitler scary.

Campaign hard for Biden during normal working hours.
Scott Dworkin:  Trump has done business for decades in China; I don't know if Biden has done business outside the U.S. except on behalf of the U.S. gov't. Our allies, I'm guessing, would be vying for Biden.
Scott Dworkin: The worst is yet to come, but I'm not sure if it comes from Trump or if it's just reality. I watched Biden talk for about half an hour, &amp; it was so strange to watch someone with feelings, who cared.I don't know if I can handle that any more
If GOP &amp; Trump truly have as much faith in a robust V-shaped recovery as they say they do, this should be an easy sell.  We‚Äôll be down to $0 in no time!  If that doesn‚Äôt work out, these triggers would ensure McConnell can‚Äôt filibuster future reauthorizations during Biden Admin.
This is crazy and Biden is accepting this because he doesn't respond to tell these destructive people to stop the torture and killing innocent lives.  Biden reminds me of the next (BTK).  Biden, Torture and kill them!  He doesn't care.

I thought it was strange last week there was no pushback on Biden for calling Trump a racist, then this happened. I guess he already had this tweet cued up.
Harris turned out to be a mediocre - at best - candidate. Her only star turn was excoriating Biden in a debate late last year. She's from CA, which Dems will win easily. Her experience as CA AG would just refocus her and Biden's issues with law enforcement/CJR issues.
It‚Äôs an epic idea to use a tongue-twister for Biden‚Äôs slogan, considering he‚Äôs such a skilled speaker to begin with.  #BuildBackBetter
America needs to be wearin' a Trojan if Biden's elected.

The sad thing is that I know this is a parody account and I can't even tell if this post is a joke or something that really happened. Yes, Biden is that bad.
Every single indicator shows Biden is DOA.  The only indicators you have are fake news polls who have no correlation to electoral outcomes.
There's very few paths to the White House for Biden if he can't win GA.  GA is really in many ways a bellwether election of the swing States.

I'm seeing less ads in Harrisburg market.  The ones still running are the squirrelly fear mongering ads but they're not running every five minutes like before.  They seemed to have backed off since Biden finally started running ads.
He‚Äôs a grifter who moved to Bernie when Warren was no longer viable; I suspect if he would have moved over to Biden if he could have leveraged enough followers and monetized that move, but as he can‚Äôt this is where he‚Äôs at now. Sad.

"Look, there are some places where when the curve is going down, you can begin to loosen things, but we should have a mask mandate until we get this under control," Biden said.
Biden has said he would choose a female running mate and has faced pressure from the Democratic Party to choose a woman of color.

But what gives most hope is that every time one of these articles comes out about Biden essentially adopting the worldview of Warren/Sanders economically, the obvious conclusion is this
They‚Äôre working with Bernie‚Äôs campaign setting up task forces for every domestic issue, due to the warm relationship between the two. Bernie wouldn‚Äôt go scorched earth at Biden at the end of his campaign bc he‚Äôs loyal and Biden respected him as a fellow Senator when few else did
‚ÄúClinton and Obama were operating under the shadows of the Reagan ‚Äògovernment-is-the-problem‚Äô. I think Biden is the end of [that] and the beginning of something new, a touchstone of a view where the government was an affirmative force and public service was a noble profession.‚Äù

Propane Jane:  I think there's an acknowledgement that Biden needs to choose someone who will challenge him to move to the future; he will need to pass on institutional knowledge.
Propane Jane:  Biden knew out of the gate that he wanted to pick a woman. He knows he's a place-holder candidate who may only hold one term, who is to get Trump out of office.
Propane Jane:  The reasoning behind Biden's having to pick who he needs to pick is distracting from the fact that Biden is the guy who's going up against Trump.
Propane Jane:  I don't know who Biden will pick for VP; I still believe Kamala Harris would be a great choice for him. I see them as yin and yang, a great complement to each other.
Honestly if there was any other viable option for president besides Biden I wouldn't hesitate to vote green, yellow, purple, what fucking ever.   I can't wait until we destroy the Democratic Party, too.
Biden can be made to look very very bad by not debating.  I hope he tries that political strategy.

Strikes me as an extension of Biden‚Äôs apparent ‚Äújust let Trump defeat himself‚Äù strategy.   Which isn‚Äôt unreasonable.   Like ‚Ä¶ endorsing legalization when up this far in the polls would be akin to a QB up three TDs throwing the ball deep instead of handing it off.

Actually, it was the Silent Generation (born 1928-1944) that molded the entire economy to their needs -- it's time for the Silent Generation (Biden et al) to enter retirement -- many Boomers (born 1945-1964) are still raising children.
Because of all of the polls the Trump campaign and RNC and OAN have released that show Trump winning? Compared to the other polls that show he has a 32% approval on Covid, race relations, find Biden more competent on economy &amp; less senile? Okay, Boomer.
If Biden wins - secession?!?
Thank you Bobby. If you were running for President, I‚Äôd value your perspective, but that statement was for Joe Biden.

Biden will be able to send in DEA and patrol cities, use the gun registry to go to people‚Äôs doors and take their now illegal rifles. Before, that enforcement would have been left to sheriff‚Äôs offices. Now, because of Trump &amp; Barr - not so much. See?
What i‚Äôm saying is that say Biden gets in. Senate and house go blue, you know they are going to pass gun legislation making automatic weapons illegal.  Now, we have precedent for federal Agents to go into states over the objections of gov &amp; mayor to enforce fed law. That means...

No problem then with Biden, just the people quoting him, huh?
You sir are the ignorant one. If you say Biden is guilty, then you have to agree that trump is too. Both can be swung into a Quid Pro Quo story. The fact is trump did it as president and sought dirt on a rival, it was a deal to benefit himself.
Biden did it under the direction of Obama. He wasn‚Äôt going rogue or seeking investigations into his political opponents. Trump withheld aid to attempt to make a deal: aid for dirt. If you can‚Äôt see who is more at fault here... you‚Äôve drank the trump jizz

Just wait!  Now this will set a precedent and allow Biden to send DEA officers into every city across the nation to confiscate automatic rifles from citizens.
Watch out!  Once you compromise  the federalist premise and move into absolute executive power, Biden will be able to deploy DOJ guards across the nation and confiscate automatic rifles from citizens.
The problem is this precedent means Biden will be able to send DOJ agents across the nation to confiscate automatic rifles from people.

It‚Äôs much more dangerous to keep him in power. Biden will have my vote no matter what.
For this election, they‚Äôre completely missing the point. I can see not wanting to vote for either candidate, but not voting against trump is implying you don‚Äôt mind keeping America ‚Äúgreat‚Äù again... I do not wish America to keep going in this direction. I will vote, and for Biden

The  of #PA today shows  holding a +23%  lead over  in the #NEPA region. Biden: 59% Trump: 36%  &amp; 2% undecided. Good news for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area Biden boosters. Only caution: region polled includes Lehigh &amp; Northampton counties.
A #PA pollster confirms what many national polling firms have found in the state: ‚Å¶ is gonna lose. Trump‚Äôs total incompetence in dealing with #COVID19 scares voters. Lotta time left, but ‚Å¶ has no plan to beat virus.
All they have left is Biden, and it looks like he is going to pick Heels up Harris to be his running mate.  If those were your options, would you be happy or mad?  Lol

If Biden had any PR sense at all, he'd pick one of the other popular candidates, such as Sanders, Gabbard or Yang... but we know he's not going to.  He'll go with some party insider that nobody cares about.
I answered your question. I'm not giving Trump anything. There is no benefit if he wins. There is also no benefit in Biden's current policies. Only he can hand this election to Trump, by not attempting to bring more people on board.
Whose "letting" Trump win? The only person who will be responsible for a Trump victory is Biden by not bringing more voters to his side.

James, your Irrational TDS is showing.  Anyone that would vote for Joe Biden really doesn't care about America.  Do Not forget that before the pandemic America was the best it has ever been for all races of Americans.  :-)
So Biden will appease everyone by saying "he'll look into it." And that will be good enough?
Biden literally spearheaded "Most Favoured Nation" status. Bull.
I wonder why?
If Biden won, it'd be terrifying to call her VP. She would call the shots. Biden is surrounding himself with the radical left.
73% say Trump 7% Biden 7% Jorgensen 7% other
Many more radicals ran than moderates, hence how Biden won
Its designed to be easy. Biden couldn't tho
Trump lived in PA longer than BidenBiden is gonna spend half his time convincing us he know what he's talking about.
A friend of mine lost her husband to cancer. She‚Äôs 53. Now a widow. She couldn‚Äôt have a funeral.  They have a rally disguised as a funeral. Where was Biden???  These people are diabolical.
You never ran against Obama. You lost against Clinton with Russian help. You're losing against Biden.  Give it up.
Unfortunately, for you, almost all of America is against you! Good news, we are all with JOE BIDEN! #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
Biden seems to prefer doing things to little girls in public and on camera
Biden isn't a socialist, but Trump is a fascist.
Biden and Warren ticket branded in my mind.
I just wanted to follow up and tell you that I want to eat my words. I've just watched the zoom convo between Biden and Warre-available to those who made donations to his campaign. I was *deeply* impressed with him and his agenda. He is definitely *not* "ordinary." I apologize.

I'm surprised you haven't tried to blame Biden or the Democrats or the "Radical Left"  I guess that will be tomorrow's tweet storm?
BIDEN INVENTS NEW WORDS! AG BARR: DURHAM ACTION MAY OCCUR BEFORE NOV! PO...  via
Biden‚Äôs first responsibility is to choose a VP that gets him elected. A close second is picking a person who can follow him into the Oval Office in 4 or 8 years. Getting rid of Trump is job one.
We have reached the stage of the Biden VP search where it is time to track private aircraft.
When was Trump vindicated? He has fifty pending cases including the treasure of a child .You just can't make up your own set of facts.
The guilty
Red herring to who is really in deep shit that one is Bill Clinton

New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Majority of Democrats want Biden to pick a Black woman for vice president
I donated $10 to attend Biden and Warren's fundraiser tonight just in case he announces she's the VP. Now I'm shouting at the screen BRING OUT LIZ BRING OUT LIZ. I may or may not be drunk.
I think she is great.  It was great that she actually pushed back at Biden in the debates.  But he should respect that.
How do I be the first one to vote for Biden
To me, it would be the ultimate show of loyalty if she was ambitious. She wants to be President, and her best path to that is to get the blessing of Obama and Biden.   I like Bass, Rice, &amp; Demings. They're great. But Harris is ready to be President RIGHT NOW. She adds enthusiasm.
The worst part is that there will be NO accountability whatsoever for these GHOULS. If we ever have elections again, the Biden administration won‚Äôt even push for hearings
This shows exactly what's wrong with Biden.
They make milk toast liberals sound so cool  I wish Joe Biden was going to defund police and create a socialist state with no god in schools. That would be awesome.
My targeted advertising on Google has switched to Joe Biden ads instead of Trump ads.... it seems it has learned something but it still hasn't learned I can't actually vote.
Yet you're taking the white men stirring things up seriously. And blaming Biden for it. Ask yourself who benefits. Because it sure as shit isn't those of us who will be fucked with 4 more years of Trump. At some point we have to stop making ourselves easy targets.
At this point I think we need to ask ourselves who benefits from Dem voters being mad at Biden, from turnout being suppressed. These opinion pieces seem too well crafted specifically to anger people and we need to stop getting suckered.
Were you there when Biden was credibly accused? Did you see how the Democrats responded to that? Democrats will fall on their own swords to protect the Clintons.
No disrespect intended, but who‚Äôs Karen Bass?   Due to their ages, Biden‚Äôs (and Trump‚Äôs) VP must be someone experiencied and qualified enough to be President from day 1.
They're gathering proof that Biden is in deep doo-doo for the election.
Then you should want Biden to quit over Catholicism.
what kind of "love it or leave it" argument is that? Can I complain about US foreign policy because I pay taxes?  I don't support the dem party, my primary support went to Sanders, and I do my best to convince people to shift left. But this election will just be Trump or Biden.
Biden is a puppet of the far-left. There‚Äôs no question about it.

I was gonna vote for Biden but now that you tweeted this I‚Äôm gonna just write in Bart Simpson

Biden wins.  (see, I did it in 2)
Biden is 77.  His VP better be ambitious!
So you're voting for Joe Biden via absentee (mail in) ballot? Glad to see you finally saw the light.
BREAKING: Biden announces VP pick is.......  Former WCW/NWO wrestler Sting???!
If my choices were Trump, Biden or Keem. Honestly I'd just vote for Keem.
I wish I could be optimistic, but looking at Biden's record rather than just what he started saying a few months ago, he'll let us all rot before he does anything that even slightly inconveniences the party's donors, helping pave the way for a competent Trump down the line.
7/ With a Sanders or a Warren, the people had a better chance to shift policy but we‚Äôll have to push Biden. Until the rich lose control of the reigns, talks of revolution are frivolous and childish.
6/ General Strikes will never work until some of the power is given back to the people, the workers and in order for that to happen, you‚Äôd want a Sanders in the Oval Office but instead our only shot is Biden.
Yes, girl? Biden is a joke that writes itself. #comedygold
At the end of the latest Biden commercial good old Uncle Joe said "I'm Joe Biden and I ... wait I am Joe Biden aren't I?
Well that was just f'n stupid. Obama/Biden created 11.5 million jobs, whereas Trump/Pence have lost a total of 8 million since they took office.
I have never heard of her until the latter months of the VP search &amp; I can take a guess of why that is but I will just say BIDEN/HARRIS 2020
I agree theoretically, and the accelerationist in me agrees. Pretty much every version of me agrees but I can‚Äôt say for sure I won‚Äôt vote Biden
yeah, i heard biden's got them in a big cartoon villain bag in his basement
It isn't scary.   It shows Biden is competent and sharp.
Yeah we would just have to worry about the country. Can you imagine Joe Biden speaking with leaders of other countries about diplomacy? Especially after your brain degrades for 4 more years, you‚Äôll end up forgetting which country you‚Äôre serving.
If Biden win WH and McConnell still controls the senate....  McConnell will go into the mode he was in from 2009 thru 2016 - block every piece of legislation from passing and block every judicial nomination from a hearing.  He'll hold a SCOTUS seat open for 4 years if he has to.

I have a terrible feeling that acccounts which tweet like this are Russian trolls (who amount in the 1000‚Äôs) and each amass 1000‚Äôs of left leaning followers... one week before the election, their troll community will unleash a torrent of anti-Biden tweets, causing mass confusion.
people to want better things. These are hard projects and can't be done at the ballot box. We need mass movements.  I'm voting Biden to repudiate the path to the presidency of pandering to authoritarian + white nationalist bases. I don't want more politicans emulating Trump.
Oh Donny.  You‚Äôre at 42.7%. Picking the one poll that is always 5 or more points above everything else is asinine.  Biden has an intellect that you couldn‚Äôt touch. He has a Doctorate and years in politics.  You have a Bachelors that daddy bought and proud of a cognitive test.
I just don't know how anyone can look at Biden's steady lead and dramatic outpacing of Clinton, who barely lost,  against an incumbent with worse favorables in a weakening economy and then think "idk i think trump will still win"
I just recently had one through DISH network in an odd place after I went to my settings to connect to Alexa Echo Dot, it appeared as vote for Biden, Trump, or not vote. Of course I picked TRUMP!
Biden is proposing forgiving private HBCU debt as part of his racial equity plan, but it's odd to me to narrow relief that way.   POC go to non-HBCU private schools too. If you're forgiving public debt and private HBCU debt...why not just do it all??
Aside from the fact that Sanders appealed to independents more than Biden ever did (and that the "nonmember outside" *won* because lots of people despite both parties), I don't buy the idea that it was about strategy and not about what Sanders wanted to do for a second.

You won‚Äôt be safe when Biden wins because you will be indicted. You can lead the prayer group in the slammer.
Listen - I remember 2008 quite well. All the members of the old boys club in the Democratic party that are saying Biden should not pick Harris were the SAME exact people who were opposed to the party nominating Barack Obama.  How'd that one work out?   Biden-Harris 2020
When I was 17 I helped my Mom who worked for Jesse Jackson‚Äôs campaign, We beat Biden back then only to lose to Dukakis. Jessie‚Äôs campaign was awesome and had so much energy I was stunned by the loss!!  It was a tough pill to swallow back then but yet here we are again!!

And then they will blame us Democrats as we clean up their mess. Just like they did after 2008. They will hold one of their Nazi rallies and decry socialism, Biden, healthcare, JFK, the Clintons, the New England Patriots, Pope John Paul II, the Emancipation Proclamation.....
What actually happened was Obama pressured all the moderate candidates except Biden into dropping out at the most strategic possible moment. Plus using the pandemic as an excuse to shut down polling stations, especially on college campuses, where Sanders voters were likely to go
If Biden is listening to a piece of shit like rendell, we‚Äôre all in trouble.  I think he‚Äôs done a disservice to all the VP candidates especially Senator Harris by dragging this out so long.  It‚Äôs ridiculous
He really wants Biden to win even if it's fraudulent.
Well said. As the father of three grown brilliant young ladies, said instinct has been absorbed internally more often than not.
The latent racism aside, isn‚Äôt this particular VP pick one that biden would want to be outspoken, ambitious, etc?
You seem to think "Sleepy" is a derogatory name for Joe Biden.  America has a massive case of Trump Fatigue.   A "sleepy" President who doesn't keep us up at night is exactly what most of us want.  It's why you're going to lose.
Rendell is a crook and a career corporate mob blowhard. I had the displeasure of working for the PA Democrats while he was governor. If he says not to pick Harris, then Biden should pick her immediately.
What is the purpose of having Symone Sanders and Karine Jean-Pierre as part of the Biden team if they won‚Äôt or can‚Äôt stop this mess?
Why is Nina Turner at any table?  She‚Äôs always abrasive and combative...she should not represent Biden or Kamala in any capacity. The Bernies are still bitter and vindictive...they‚Äôre more committed to vengeance than beating trump.

Maddy is a beautiful young lady with much more going for her than the little punk who posted the picture. Plus points for Dad for not giving in to the instinct to kick the kid's ass.
I dont like Clinton, Trump or Biden. I voted for Clinton anyway. Biden is a worse candidate but Hillary was more disliked. Trump only won because there were many people who thought he had no chance and just didnt think they had to. These two elections are awful.
Not sure that‚Äôs going to happen!!  I truly believe he only won cause a woman was running and because it was Hilary(emails and Benghazi). Biden is just senile. But Trump is a moron. Senile trumps moron. üëç
still thinking about that time joe biden owned mike bloomberg and also himself by claiming that he, a republican, does not endorse republicans.
Good lord. Biden is basically a Republican. You have no other talking points?
Chris Wallace talks Biden VP pick, 'embarrassing' Barr hearing and Trump 'stoking a brush fire'
He didn‚Äôt address the notion of any adult taking advantage of minors at all, let alone address any scenario where the offender is above the age of 19. He still says rape is rape. The average rapist age is 31. A high school couple is entirely different from an adult to minor.
I like beer.üòÇ I ‚ù§Glenn. I'm voting for Biden. I wanna come too!
There should not be any more doubt after the disgusting political motivated eulogy Obama spit out yesterday. Filibuster??? At a funeral??? This POS was the harbinger for the extreme Left's anti- American stance. Obama started ALL of this. And Biden was right along side of him
Sorry gang I just made a donation to the Dementia Society of America¬Æ in honor of Joe Biden .
A lot of Trump's 2016 appeal came from a mysterious factor about him. Now that we know what he's really about, that vote is gone. And there is less hate for Biden than there was Hillary. The math doesn't add up for Trump to win 2020
I certainly have my preference but I'm kinda ova it, whomever it is I'll vote for the Biden ticket up and down ballot.
The sad part is that Biden doesn't need to do interviews or campaign for that matter. He's still up huge in the polls because Trump keeps shooting himself in the foot
None of us on twitter are a part of Biden‚Äôs team, so making these assumptions is stupid.
I really don‚Äôt care who Biden picks, but please don‚Äôt let it be Bass. There‚Äôs so many things that could go wrong.
I PRAYED he picks her. Trump pulled troops out of Germany as he left other soldiers to die because Putin‚Äôs bounties. We NEED the 2 most qualified people and that‚Äôs Biden &amp; Rice. NO MORE ‚Äú cult of personality ‚Äú people PLEASE. This country needs to heal. BOTH READY ON DAY ONE üá∫üá∏
Yeah, Biden can maybe stay in his basement.
He said words...Biden sniffed kids #CreepyJoeBiden
I agree. It‚Äôs childish to refuse to work with people because they don‚Äôt 100% adhere to my opinions. That‚Äôs why I plan to vote for Joe Biden. But that won‚Äôt stop me from criticizing a lame duck fringe candidate who couldn‚Äôt even get 1% of the vote.
It didn‚Äôt happen while Barack Obama was President and it won‚Äôt happen when Joe Biden is President.
A new poll states most Trump supporters won't accept the results if Joe Biden WINS ! Aww isn't that just tough shit . We had to live with the fucking POS üí© you voted for , for 4 years and he didn't WIN the Electoral College handed it to him . üò†üò°

And then people won‚Äôt vote for you and then we have to your kvetching about Joe Biden.
Yeah man, No idea why he singled me out on the lame Jesse Ventura post and retweeted at me his stupid Biden BS! But then again he already has everything like health care so why does he give a fuck!
Literally lacking any shred of self awareness. ‚ÄúSee this stuff happening right now while I‚Äôm in office? This it totally what would happen under Biden!!!‚Äù #Biden2020
I can assure I have never fucking looked at a kid and said that or thought it. That's fucking disgusting. Why are you symping for pedophiles? Do you not hear how fucked up what you are saying is?
Don‚Äôt confuse my intense dislike for Donald Trump as an endorsement for Joe Biden.
No,  there had it the first time. Biden stands for all the things that gave us Trump in the first place. Fascism will just grow stronger under Biden. ‚ÄúThe fire‚Äù is rising fascism, not just having Republicans in office.

rendell is NOT a member of that committee. but wtf was he was asked his opinion for this article?
Were you in a coma during the Obama-Biden presidency? Maybe you can find a chart showing jobs growth during their time in office. Oh look, here's one:
That's likely. In the scenario where he wins all of those states, he's likely hanging onto GA and TX as well. But I've said it from the word "go", it's coming down to PA, WI, and MI. If Biden takes those 3, trump has essentially no path to 270.
He was not eulogized.  He was used by the Democrats to grandstand  the Democrats narrative.  It was a political rally to help Joe Biden who will not come out of the basement.  Very little of the man was spoken of - would like to know the minutes breakdown on event.
Black Lives Matter. So why do Vice President Biden, the Democratic Party, and teachers‚Äô unions oppose the most successful means for African Americans to achieve the American Dream?

I‚Äôd say about a week post Biden‚Äôs victory in November we will get ‚ÄúI survived the Trump Presidency‚Äù shirts and bumper stickers and then like 6 months later US military will be bombing Iran
Doesn't matter trump doesn't pay his bills. Vote Biden 2020.
I think a lot of people on the left don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúvictory‚Äù is. The goal was to get Bernie Sanders elected, not to get Joe Biden to half-heartedly think about possibly giving us part of a GND. We lost. Claiming otherwise is moving the goalposts!
I pray No one shows up at your fathers funeral and delivers a campaign speech on behalf of Joe Biden. May the Perpetual Light shine upon your father and, through the Mercy of God, May he Rest In Peace.
Joe Biden: I will beat Donald Reagan in December (stolen)
That‚Äôs very unlikely for multiple reasons. The biggest reason is that would be giving up a senate seat to a Republican Governor who names the replacement. Also, Biden and the DNC only care about identity politics, so they‚Äôll pick a WOC who is a corporate puppet just like Biden.
Hi Denise, that's too bad because once Biden gets in he'll do it.
Biden ain‚Äôt the president. Why are you like this.
I feel like Democrats are not playing up the USPS story enough. I'm not super enthusiastic about voting for Biden but I'll sure as hell show up to make the post office a better service.
Honestly, I have been conditioned to expect Biden gaffes. But he is doing a great job at the podium. Clear answers, coherent policies. He was my favorite going in, but he is doing a lot better than I would have expected.   And his opponent is a gibbering lunatic.
Typical deflection lmao ü§£
True, that does seem to be his strategy (see QT). But it‚Äôd be nice to see some more forthright moral leadership.   Not saying I expect much from Biden at this point. But Bush used 9/11 to reshape US politics. Dems should be doing the same with COVID, imo.
It‚Äôs crazy out there.  In my recent travels, for every anti trump vocal social media poster, I saw 2 or 3 Trump signs or banners in rural areas and not a single Biden sign. This election is going to be fascinating.  My biggest fears are either Biden winning or Trump winning.
As much as I think it's not on Biden to chase down every jagoff with a shitty opinion about a VP possibility, this is dragging out way too long. The convention is late this year, dragging it out until right before is too much. Put an end to the speculation and posturing.
Imagine being so scared of losing the Joe Biden that you want to postpone the election. Lmmfao if you‚Äôre scared say you‚Äôre scared ya big orange fascist
Omg me and my mom are putting together a drinking game for the debate w Dump &amp; Biden!!!
Either you need medicated or you are on too much already. President with the Best Economy, Lowest unemployment rate, Brought more jobs back to USA (which btw Biden &amp; Obama said could not be done)had the MOST support for our men &amp; women in uniform.  TRUMP 2020 ALL THE WAY!

The article was about ventilators, not PPE. And if you want to talk about that, talk about how the Obama-Biden administration didn‚Äôt replace the N95 masks used from the stockpile and how China purchased all of the surplus PPE on the market before anyone knew details on the virus.
LOL And all the liberal polls show Biden up by like 9 points. I don't think so
Hang onto this one for the next time  or anyone else says "No one could see this coming!" This "administration" is tragically stupid, inept and a complete and total failure. We can and we WILL do better. Remember in November. #VoteBlue #TrumpIsAFailure #Biden #p2

Trump is trying to bring back manufacturing to the US, at least he is making an effort to create jobs. If Obama(Biden) gets in, there will be poverty levels never seen by anyone alive today.

Huh? Warren is looking more and more like the pick. Just cause the news no-one watches doesn't mention her doesn't mean she's out. Hardly. Every plan biden releases is one of hers or uses the same language. They are holding a fundraiser together tonight ect ect ect.
Warren for Senate Majority Leader, at this point.  Betting markets have it as Harris, but Ms. Clymer is right: only Biden's inner circle truly knows.

President Trump refused to back down on Thursday afternoon from his suggestion earlier in the day that the election be delayed, something he has no authority to order and that top Republicans quickly rejected.
Look at this troll... hilarious. He starts with ‚ÄúIn all fairness to‚Äù and then proceeds to trash Biden. üôÑü§£üôÑ I‚Äôm sure idiots (MAGA) might fall for that. You do understand, komrade troll, that Trump IS the ultimate puppet? And of your leader Putin, at that? There‚Äôs no hiding it.
Joe Biden could NEVER keep a schedule like this.
My parents didn't vote for either of them in 2016 and are firmly Biden this time
Hopefully the media doesn‚Äôt call him dovish. He has escalated conflict with Iran and emboldened their hardliners there whereas Biden, genuinely dovish voice in the Obama adm, would get us back in the Iran Deal and understands how to approach Iran:
Of course that will happen and if Biden wins too.
Biden is smart enough to know the base of the party wants substantive, progressive reforms and he is willing to listen.  That's a good start.
Oh I know the piece was different from the tweet. I also can‚Äôt help but laugh at when it‚Äôs GOP members it‚Äôs ‚Äúplans‚Äù when it‚Äôs someone like Bernie, Biden, Obama, Pelosi, AOC, etc...it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmanifesto.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt like either Biden or Trump but I don‚Äôt think any organization should choose a side. Everyone has the right to choose who they want. I would never donate money to a politician in any scenario.
Come on! Let‚Äôs tell the truth! Obama /Biden were busy trying to save the economy from the housing crash you Republicans let happen! Now the U.S GOP shrinks by 32.9% in Q2! Really? Lowest numbers in history!  As always Dems will have to save the economy again!
Mark my words, Sarah Jessica Parker will be Biden's VP pick.

Hunter is living his life he's not worried about you or you're corrupt family, and you really need to chill on that because there are so so many skeletons that Biden could unearth on all you Trump's and it ain't pretty, btw you're not working on any Charities are you, you thief..
I worry about this as much as I worry about a second tRump term.  ~40% of registered voters are going to be going around angrily denying the legitimacy of Biden's election, claiming massive voter fraud and deep state conspiracy.
I can't remember seeing a Biden sign yet.

Fair hit, but I think Biden's implication is that he won't even use Twitter as president. I'm sure he doesn't LIKE being on this hellscape of a platform.
Biden daddy long hugs lol
You liberals were defending joe Biden months ago. Fvck off.
You‚Äôre only attacking trump supporters of doing the same thing you do for biden. Remember when he was accused of sexual misconduct and possibly rape. And thousands of you used whataboutism.
Weren‚Äôt you liberals defending joe Biden sexual misconduct a months ago? So weird. Well I guess you must have forgot.
Mr Biden‚Äôs team is going slow in the left lane. What‚Äôs Ms Harris supposed to do?
Trump seeks truth and is exposing corruption. Biden doesnt give a shit and only cares about himself and filling dirty politician pockets.
I pray so hard that Biden wants you by his side. God please!!!!
You said you‚Äôd rather have Donald Trump. Trump is a helluva lot closer to Caligula than Biden is.
Nah it‚Äôll be Ted Cruz in 2024. He‚Äôs already working on it. He‚Äôs been on a few pod casts saying both parties are corrupt. He‚Äôs going play the populist. Biden has to deliver on everything or he‚Äôs done.
pls god don‚Äôt tell me things biden has done in comparison to trump when arguing politically. no one genuinely wants to vote for biden, we just have to lol
Biden and Trump are both abhorrent
Hillary lost northeastern Pennsylvania by 13 points, and that Franklin &amp; Marshall poll has Biden winning the region by 23.
Why so they can take votes from biden we know what your doing
If you prefer Trump to Biden, you weren‚Äôt gonna vote for Biden anyway. The goal isn‚Äôt to get yinz to switch your vote. It‚Äôs to get yinz to stop lying.
Well...... funny thing is..... you‚Äôre using all this footage about ‚Äúwhat America will look like under Biden‚Äù with footage of what TRUMP‚Äôs CURRENT America  looks like.... you‚Äôre blinded by ignorance.
Listen to your supporters, you screwed them once again. You abandoned this army of followers, that you promised, you promised you would change things. And now you want me to follow Biden? Fvck that. I will not stop until the Democratic Party is destroyed. #CorruptDemocrats
Actually this started with voter shaming over Biden, something I think all independents have grown very tired of!!!
And you appear to be an anti-democracy supporter of fascist rule. You have no significance. ‚ù§Ô∏èKathyGriffin, BIDEN 2020!
When were you brainwashed? You used to be smart. Now you are a shill for the corrupt trump syndicate. WTF happened to you? BIDEN 2020. Prison for trump 2021!
You must have meant the SEC after Biden takes the oath of office. Don't be surprised if this Admin literally burns the books on the way out.
That is to say that leaving the presidency open, will have lasting effects. Because the president has a lot of power over other political realms. I'm voting for Biden not because I want to but because Trump's already appointed so many judges and his cabinet is trash
your more worried about your own election then endorsing biden because your constitutes will ask alot of question is being a scared sellout. undercover republicanü§´. So are you voting for trump or are you not going to vote and be a hypocrite.
Lol my mom‚Äôs republican cousin blocked me and my little sister on Facebook for disagreeing with her comments on my sister‚Äôs posts about BLM. In her comments she defended f*x news, got the meaning of ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù wrong, and compared Biden to her mother, who has dementia.
I'm not voting for Biden but this is just dumb.
Entire bags of mailed ballots have gone missing, not to mention bags that have been swapped.  The U.S. Postal Service has indicated they are supporting Biden.  How easy for them to swap out bags of ballots to favor Biden.
"I wasn't sold on the idea of voting for Joe Biden but then I saw Briahna Joy Gray criticize Donald Trump. Now I'm with Joe all the way!" Said no one ever, idiot.
They only use a fraction of the polls that 538, JHK, et al use. They list non-partisan polls as "democratic polls", affecting their weight. They also removed election odds from their homepage once they began favoring Biden.
NOT A CHANCE! #Biden #Biden2020 #TrumpVirus #TrumpMeltdown
So this is why you should still hold your nose and vote for Joe Biden.
Think about this for a second, your options are Donald trump, joe Biden,  jo Jorgensen, and Kanye west.
It is literally Donald Trump's America.  Joe Biden isn't President yet.  You are describing something that is happening on TRUMP'S watch.
If I may politely amend your post - President and Dr. Biden.
Joe Biden is a corpse... however I don't feel threatened by him so he has my vote. Look, I'm doing my part!
Because you're presenting a scenario in which Biden doesn't win at least one out of AZ, NC, GA, TX, OH, IA... That's certainly possible, but not especially likely at the moment.
Imagine being so scared of loosing to Joe fucking Biden that you suggest postponing the election?? If you‚Äôre scared say you‚Äôre scared you big orange coward. LMMFAO
For Biden, the best thing would be to have all of us citizens locked up, unemployed, hungry to create a far-left dictatorship, it's pathetic.
Biden is doing good. He just needs to do the typing and not talking and use Obama for votes

Can't be afraid to make decisions. Thank god he's president and not Biden. Biden has to think where he's at.
His only accomplishment was ‚Äúmaking healthcare affordable‚Äù?  It was, to quote Joe Biden, ‚ÄúA big fucking deal‚Äù. They have been trying for 50 years to get something done to help out average Americans. All you have to say is ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù.  #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything

All I look at in these polls is Biden‚Äôs share and he keeps getting 50+  A lot of these ‚ÄúD +11!‚Äù polls are just DJT only getting his basement 40. He‚Äôll get more than that, but that‚Äôs not ‚Äútightening‚Äù really.

I have to say....it really deeply upsets me that absolutely no one in Hollywood has spoken up about the sexual assault allegation against Joe Biden. As a survivor of sexual assault myself, it just hurts. Terribly. My heart is with you,  xoxo ‚ù§Ô∏èüíï
My father in law has dementia and I'm his caretaker. When he talks, he doesnt even say words, its just mumble jumble or if he gets word out it has nothing to do with anytging.  I really don't see Biden having demetia, but I respect your  opinion on it as well.

Polling gave Clinton a 3-point lead in Michigan, 2 points in Pennsylvania and showed Trump narrowly winning Florida. Only Wisconsin was wildly off at 6¬Ω points.  Biden has an 8-point lead in MI, 7 in FL, and 6 in PA. Trump has no room to maneuver.

The racial wealth gap expanded in Joe Biden's forty years of service as a Senator and Vice President.  Why do you expect him to fix it in four years?
Biden is dying to debate. It will be very socially distanced, though. No audience. That plan is already in the works.
A major part (perhaps the key part) of running a presidential campaign against an incumbent is framing current social problems as results of the incumbent‚Äôs political agenda. Ideally such framing would invoke the incumbent party‚Äôs name as well. When in 2020 has Biden done either?
China supports your efforts.
You are confusing Biden landslide with trump poopslide
Voting for Biden instead of the man with 24 sexual assault cases against him. The man who said he was more sexually attracted to his (then) 13yo daughter than his wife. The man who has over 2,000 active lawsuits against him.  It‚Äôs a no brainer.
He is campaigning     Since Biden is mostly stuck in the basement
Joe Biden is exactly what you need now to heal the country... ü§ß
. The only reason they are saying Biden is picking a black woman ,is because they want the black, and the woman vote. Do they care about back and woman, hell no, only on election day. Wake up already.
No! Just stop! Biden was right &amp; every American should be concerned for our democracy. There is no both sides to this!
I am unsure how Biden got a reputation as a more decent person than Trump: there's sniffing, mass plagiarism, segregation/Confederate support, and name calling supporters. He's quoted Mao + Muhammads call to Jihad.   There's the Tara Reade issue as well. Just vote policy, lol.
Absolutely voting for Biden.  Your little tweet that just parrots what Donny screams in his rallies is a complete joke.
Just breath it will only bring you down to their level.  I often wonder and now will do,  put a Biden flag in a military community.  Lets see if I get the same respect...

Vote BIDEN on NOVEMBER 3RD and end this ridiculousness
Nope. Neoliberal politicians like Harris and republicans like Biden turn off voters.
When Biden was VP, he and Obama did nothing for people getting evicted in 2009. They oversaw the largest annual evictions history.
Biden played a big role in creating the conditions that created Trump, I don‚Äôt understand how repeating that mistake will get us a different result.
With any luck Biden‚Äôs lead on election night will be impossible for you to overcome.
Trump's packed the Courts and since they have no further use for him and can see that he's going to lose. they want Pence to run against Biden.

I guess one reason this wouldn't work though after further thought is the risk that something happens in between the two days. Maybe after the A-L people vote, Biden tweets out some nonsense about worshipping aliens from Planet X. Then the M-Z voters have new information.

Project Lincoln is ran by republicans.  Joe Biden is a good enough republican for them and many others that chose your dadbover Hillary. People hate Hillary just like your dad, but Joe is liked. He can walk down the street without security. Your dad hides in bunkers.
You should consider changing your handle. Biden 2020 makes Yang 2024 impossible. If Biden is only in office for 4 years then that means his VP will take over or a republican, there's no room for Yang in 2024 with a Biden Presidency in 2020.

People will stop being put in cages if Biden wins. We will have leadership during the pandemic if Biden wins, resulting in less death. Trump = death. Period.
Only fear I have is that mail-in voting will be regionally targeted well enough to swing a few key states, but I expect that Biden should win by enough to outperform it
His new tactic is the fear/racist one like in 2016. He signed a bill to stop low income housing in suburbs, sent armed DHS troops to create violence against BLM protesters, &amp; claims in ads that Biden wants to defund the police &amp; we‚Äôll all die. Most have black men breaking in.
He cannot delay it.  What he can do is resign before getting destroyed by Biden, and get Pence to pardon him, which may not work either.  So, what's the over/under on him fleeing to Russia at some point between now and November 4th? ü§£

Well, if you are truly concerned,  perhaps you could just concede to future President Joe Biden. Your terrible lack of leadership, as a national leader, has cost American lives, monies, and hope. You have stimulated national  paranoia, so there's that.
First compelling argument for a Biden vote I've heard so far
Biden Holds Large Lead Over Trump In PA, New Poll Shows
The poll indicates Trump might have difficultly duplicating his narrow 2016 win in Pennsylvania.
He's nearly as far gone as Biden. Have another drink George.
I was just up MI saw mor trump signs. Didn‚Äôt see 1 Biden sign. This was at the dunes at silver lake.

BREAKING: the biden campaign has announced they plan to outlaw illegalism
‚ÄúHow will Biden carry New York (population 19.7 million) without Boro Park (population 100,000)?‚Äù
Odd, here in PA we had a pretty good mail in vote in the primary. You are trying to keep the people from voting. You know you‚Äôre getting crushed and that states that shouldn‚Äôt be in play, are. Texas has Biden up by 2. Are you going to brag about the GDP release today?
Is this tweet about Biden or Clinton? I‚Äôm confused.
Biden‚Äôs list of crime chores is going to be so, so long.
Hoe do you account for Biden being so consistently ahead in these Florida polls then?
Surprised we haven't seen anything about biden having acquiesced to the highly ambitious Clinton already
Joe Biden should go on Joe Rogan's Show.  Why not?  #RedPillBill üëâüêøÔ∏è‚õ∞Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è #TheJoker
Once Biden is sworn in, not a lot trump can to, he will not be recognized as president any longer, period. Vote for Biden, let‚Äôs make it a landslide victory!
As much as I don't like Biden, this is actually sad to see.
A vote cast for a Democrat is a reward for violence, lies, deceit and destruction.  Voting for Biden to hope this goes away is like paying a ransom to kidnappers.
Exactly.  Florida is icing on the cake.  If Biden wins there Trump's done and it'll be close if he does.  He has to have PA which is looking good.
So to support Biden I have to pretend that he is not one of the oldest presidential candidates in history?  That is foolish.
The replies are just a brilliant collection of reasons why Biden and the democratic party sucks. People's brains are so poisoned on "Russiagate" that they want Biden to promise new endless wars
Biden most irrelevant presidential nominee in history. If the media didn‚Äôt care his water/message daily you‚Äôd never even know he was running.
Why are Democrats held to a much higher standard by our media? It was always an annoyance of mine - until Republicans started killing us. Based on how Biden and Harris have been treated so far, this shows no signs of letting up any time soon.
If you‚Äôre a liberal &amp; are still thinking about voting for someone who isn‚Äôt Biden...I hate you.
Hillary Clinton got 88% of the black vote. Joe Biden will at least get that.
your commercials are full of lies. No where did Joe Biden say he agreed with defunding the police. You can't even tell the truth even in a commercial.   Stop doing the devils work
Have you looked at Biden's site at all? Heard him (attempt) to speak recently?
Preempting VP Pence's visit to Greensburg today, the Biden campaign says the last thing Pennsylvanians need is a ‚Äúphoto-op‚Äù from a Trump administration official as the state struggles with a pandemic.
Joe Biden wrote the "crime bill" that decimated black families/communities by ripping parents out of the home for NON-VIOLENT drug crimes by mass incarceration of mostly black men/fathers.  Tell me again how Trump and his supporters are racist
LOL üòÇ You keep trying to sell that  "Registration shifts across the state show Republicans are gaining voters at five times the rate of Democrats."
If at all possible if Biden wins on Nov 3 can trump be removed at that time before he starts a nuclear war!!
Was Biden not a VP who eventually went on to focus on becoming the President? Let a woman live.
I know a couple of Biden supporters that are white males over 50 that never went to college.
Wait. You mean we actually have to fight conservatives who think that Biden, Pelosi and Schumer are far left? No. I‚Äôm shocked. üôÑ
Donald Trump Vs. Joe Biden 2020 Quiz: Who Said That Quote?
Biden is great choice for racist voters of demokkkrats
We‚Äôre rooting for America. A vote for Biden is a vote for communist China.
There are correct and valid reasons to not like Kamala Harris as a potential VP. Concern that she might be ambitious and want the Presidency isn't one of them. I would be extremely surprised if any Biden VP wouldn't be seeking the presidency considering he is 79
I voted for Sanders (mainly because of health care), and Biden does nothing for me. I'll still vote for him, but it would be nice not to be hectored about how I'm not sufficiently happy about it. I don't have to be happy. I'm voting to get the orange bastard out.
I live in Pennsylvania. Donald Trump won PA in 2016. The only way to make sure he doesn‚Äôt win it again is to vote for Joe Biden.
Easy for you to say in a solidly blue state like Vermont. But for someone like me, who lives in Pennsylvania, it‚Äôs mandatory to vote for Joe Biden.
I grew up in Butler County, Pennsylvania (very rural part of Western PA), and whenever I see old high school friends of mine on Facebook, they aren‚Äôt the least bit shy. They usually tend to show GIFs of Trump tying Biden, Pelosi, AOC, etc. to train tracks and running them over.
I wish I had a way to save all these "Biden will never win!" tweets. I feel like I should be checking back in on their mental health when he does win.  Good luck bud, you'll need it.
Love of the USA, which the Democrats hate.  But thank you for nominating a senile candidate.  China's candidate.
Biden said he wants to make steel here, at home, without buying foreign steel.  Will someone ask him how we will make that steel with no coal or no natural gas.  Where is he getting all that electicity to build all those power stations to plug those electric cars in?   Just ask.
Or Biden crushing Trump in PA.
Biden isnt pragmatic, its disappointing. Replacing Trump with corporatist Dems isnt a solution. It's a recipe for disaster. Who do you think destroyed the economy? Newsflash, not Trump. It was Rs and Ds over the last 20yrs who sold us down the river for corporate profits and GDP
Biden‚Äôs an old white guy who sometimes says dumb shit. He‚Äôs not running a campaign based on hate, division and fear of the other.
I mean, you're literally arguing we should vote establishment again, which is what gave us Trump and you're calling us insane for wanting to try something different. Do you not see how you've mixed it up? I say this as someone who will vote Biden. Dont expect me to like it.
So does that make Congress Nazi's since they make the federal laws? Politicians that have been in office for decades like Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden.
You are savage and so very intelligent don't ever forget it! Biden can't answer the questions hence why he doesn't get asked #Trump2020 #MAGA2020
If you listened to the mainstream fake news media, shouldnt we all be dead by now? I mean Biden claims half the country has been wiped out.
Biden stinks.
As a radical leftist I can tell you joe Biden is not giving me shit that I want
lol Biden is gonna govern like a Republican because he is a Republican. When voters realize he doesn't give a shit about them they'll stay home in 2024 and the right will benefit.
LIVE!!!  WE ARE NOT FOOLED BY BIDEN
I would vote ‚úÖ for Biden even if he was Orange üçä
Yeah too bad you had to go back 30 years to find something derogatory on Biden! 45 showed his racism today!
Substitute Joe Biden for Donald Trump and this makes perfect sense.
Or perhaps it‚Äôs working exactly as intended? ü§î Biden has an HD pic of his notes taken with Kamala listed on top and now a Biden ally ‚Äúleaks‚Äù an obviously sexist talking point that‚Äôll boost Kamala‚Äôs profile even higher a week before Biden makes his VP pick. Timely coincidence? ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Um, I'm not being emotionally manipulated by today's political agendas and I'm very aware of how unfair health care accessibility and costs are. The bottom line is: a vote for Trump is a vote for cruelty and incompetence. Up against that, voting for Biden feels like hope.
It really makes me feel some type of way the commercial about ‚Äújoe Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù but the images they are using are literally from trumps America
It wasn‚Äôt immediately clear what segment upset the president during his flight, though he often criticizes Fox‚Äôs polling, which has consistently showed him trailing Joe Biden in the November election.
Who cares what Biden or anyone said? They weren't in the chair. A president is there to make the tough decisions, especially when they aren't popular.  Fauci and other experts were saying travel bans give folks a false sense of security, and the focus should be on mitigation (1)
Here‚Äôs a question: why is it ‚Äúthe perfect example of what will happen if Joe Biden becomes president‚Äù when you don‚Äôt seem to care that it is happening when trump is president?
Yeah. I‚Äôm assuming the Biden ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù will be very similar to the Obama ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù in 2009
and the media would rather shit on trump again bc as long as they can drill into your head the idea that joe biden is a better option for president thats all that matters ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Joe Biden‚Äôs America.
Spoiler alert? Kamala Harris outed as Biden's VP pick -- maybe
If you replaced Muslims with Christians in this message would you be concerned?  They are misunderstood and marginalized so much.  I thought this was a nice message from Biden.
5: anyone who actually perpetrated those acts has been Long Dead... except for Hillary and Biden... they still have slaves. They should probably be tried for Treason also.
Now do Biden.

That's what I've been saying but everyone would rather be mad at Biden. It's ultimately voter suppression.

Mysogeny in the Biden campaign. I‚Äôm shocked.
You misspelled "Joe Biden".
Trump shutdown travel while Pelosi was calling it a hoax and encouraging everyone to get together in mass gatherings.  This wasn't Obama/Biden's brutal mishandling of the swine flu, but it is definitely a much more contagious disease.
They don‚Äôt report it because you‚Äôve made the whole thing up.  Mail in voting is absentee voting.  You &amp; Pence voted that way this year. Polls in minority districts closed &amp; stopping mail in voting means less democrat votes. You have to cheat to beat Biden. #VoteTrumpOut
All of you laughing at poor Joe Biden... Wait until they stop denying the obvious - they will pivot and call you ableist for noticing his condition.
This is why you must go to the polls to vote with ID. Post office, backing biden, will be a major cause of lost ballots and voter fraud. #VoterFraud  #VoterID
He said it himself. A Biden presidency will put everyone back to sleep! It‚Äôs easier to fight an evil system when it has an ugly face on it.
Love it. Ive seen about 10 biden yard signs and about 5000 Trump 2020 signs.
I like it! But they may like it too, considering all the shit coming out of the mouths of Biden, congressional Dems, governors, and mayors.
Nope. Kamala does not want to be AG and Rice has way too much baggage. I can‚Äôt deal with months of Benghazi again. Biden/Harris2020
What happened to #metoo guess it doesn't apply to Democrats. Tara Reade is very credible, and all I hear is crickets. Shows ya how crooked this party is. Joe Biden is an accused sex offender and all the so called activist and leftist media are nowhere.Just another example
As an addendum to your great VP selection series, please comment on the press reports of certain donors trying to undermine Kamala Harris as a VP option. What level of influence, if any, will this have on Biden‚Äôs decision.

What do you mean I thought our stock was already worth $0, that‚Äôs what some of these Trumpster JPS are already saying. So, since I‚Äôve already lost everything, no sense in that lunatic cont to run the Country like he runs his business. Hope Biden beats his ass. $fnma #fanniegate
Who would entertain the the thought of #HeelsUpHarris as VP?!  She wasnt even popular as a candidate! Why would that help Biden? Did she sleep with George Soros?
Their absurd, irrational attempts to unseat Trump have been comical. If Biden gets to 270 it‚Äôs either because they cheated or the real pandemic is stupidity.

Dodd being part of the team doesn‚Äôt make me feel better about Biden‚Äôs choices.
Despair trolls out everywhere. Hit pieces by the media on popular democrats. Attacks by the GOP on the FBI. Bizarre distractions all over the place..  Yeah, someone is losing badly right now, and that person is NOT named Joe Biden.
I hate the fact that Biden and Trump are the only legitimate candidates. Two racist old white men. One will say it to your face with a gun in his hand and the other will say it behind your back with a gun to you
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
Why are these extremely elderly people still in political office!  RBG, PELOSI, BIDEN, etcetera and so on. Retire already.
Team Biden has been really savvy. He's had a few minor gaffes but that's it. He has hired great people.   Let some old washed up guys take some shit while you float trial balloons to the media. Biden can brush it off and no one will remember
Umm. That‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs handwriting.
As is typical, presidential candidates are worried about being overshadowed.   Considering Biden walks like a dotard on his last legs he better pick someone ambitious.
Covid-Don Trump is the worst president in the history of the United States of America.  VOTE BIDEN
We just want Biden people to help push him left. But instead y‚Äôall like.. sorry this is the best we got.
Well, Susan, u know ur way around dishonesty and distractions. But HRC spilled the beans. U were set up to spread lies to distract from the truth of Benghazi. Unless u knew the truth, in which case u lied to the American people. VP choice? I hope so. U would be Biden‚Äôs millstone
Did you see the Republicans questioning Google etc about showing favoritism to Biden? That will be their next excuse and if course all the fake news that 90 percent report on the same way. If it even comes from his mouth and he doesn't like it..that is fake too!

In fact just yesterday he tweeted Make America Great Again! So he agrees Biden should and will get the job.
He literally does and you know it for a fact. Stop being ignorant. You‚Äôre only voting for him because you don‚Äôt wanna see President Trump in office again. Of course you don‚Äôt give a fuck about Biden..it‚Äôs all about ‚ÄúTrump bad! Orange man racist!ü§¨‚Äù
Oh hey look black people getting hurt again. Glad biden and Obama did nothing to stop this. Totally just not gonna vote. Both candidates clearly equally bad.  You fucking idiots.
We really gotta choose between this guy and biden oml im ganna cry
You bring up an important issue. But a vote for Biden raises the possibility of working on the inequities in the system. Trump seems to only want to make inequities worse, to the point that nurses (and doctors) and other Americans die from COVID.
I mean, Joe Biden is our nominee, but go off, I guess.
Sure. Because Democrats win by electing non-ambitious weaklings who never throw a verbal punch. That'll beat Trump. (Eyeroll).  This has to be bullshit.
I thought it was kinda obvious that whoever is Biden‚Äôs VP is they‚Äôd be the favorite in 24.
I agree the Democrats are running the same campaign as Hillary in 2016. A puppet candidate that will not be running the country. Others will call the shots.  Not
Def. Look at how many tweets Kamala has about Biden and compare that with other VP potential candidates.
You can block me but doesn't stop the fact  will be re-elected come Nov. Also, tell me what Biden plans to do as president because I cant make out anything he says or what his plans are? I've been trying to figure that one out for a while.
Seriously üò≥ she must be confused like her buddy Biden.
Aren‚Äôt you liberals praising bush another white supremacists? Aren‚Äôt you liberals praising and propping up the Lincoln project. Run by white supremacists? Aren‚Äôt the same white supremacists voting for Biden. Weird huh.
Watch the other clips, or watch the Breakfast Club's video in its entirety, idc.   This is like saying that Biden's "you ain't black" was out of context. ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I refuse to believe this picture isn't a wax statue of Biden
Thanks for the food for thought. The things I most want as a nurse: eliminate profiteering in health care, have universal coverage. Biden has a sense of why those matter, while Trump sees any kind of profit-making as good. He also doesn't care if nurses/docs are killed by COVID
It makes no sense since Biden also said he may only serve one term. There was talk of grooming beto like a year ago.
Kamala has done more for the campaign than literally anyone. Event after event. If Biden falls for this, he‚Äôll lose a lot of respect in my book.

Joe Biden said to shoot people in the leg, not the heart.
Yeah, who wants a ready-made Pres candidate when Biden bows out after 1 term.......Biden will be the problem for normal people? Not the fascist wannabe dictator in the White House now? I was under the impression that Trump letting his white supremacist friends run amok that that would be the problem for normal people. Thank you for clearing that up for me. ü§®
Keep America great!  Oh wait. Yeah, very bad unemployment #s, and pandemic is killing a thousand people a day again because he wanted all the states opened!  Lies about Biden is definitely the next play.

E. The media.  Trump has not been good for America's health, but I think the media gave us Trump.  Left and right media gave us Trump.   Clinton was fine.  Biden hasn't done anything.  We survived Obama.  Trump &amp; Trumpishness is toxic beyond policy.

Interesting ... Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
I'm in #PA07.  My guess is Biden +2.  That would be about a 3-point swing from 2016.
Biden just has to sit in the basement and let the Orange Man keep digging his own grave, which he's doing with alarming speed.  He's embraced white flight, sex with demons, and proposed moving an election that he has no Constitutional authority to do.   And its only Thursday.

The 1% and baby boomers in particular, have been killing all who follow on purpose for personal gain for 40 years. This is far from new. They are inferior. They know it. Have to be removed by force. Biden's presence proves that yet again. Cancer doesn't cure cancer.
Don't you know everything is only happening this way because it's an election year. Biden did it. Don't worry about the last 3 1/2 years. They don't count! #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Trump's anti-Biden commercials say that if Biden wins there won't be any police and no one will be safe. Meanwhile in Trump's world now, the police that currently exist aren't being fair and equal to anyone.

I agree, but keep in mind that Karen could also help with progressives.   However, most progressives are going to be voting with Biden regardless, so it wouldn't make as much as an impact as someone like Duckworth, who isn't only an army veteran, but as you said, a midwesterner.
Kamala Harris, Karen Bass, or Tammy Duckworth.  Also, typically it's announced at the convention, so it's not really like Biden's putting it off on purpose, the convention is just later than usual (August 17th).  Regardless, I think he'll announce in a week or two.
That award went to Biden for his support of Robert Exalted Cyclops Byrd's racist, segregationist legislation.

Whats that word for- a senile old communist stooge who likes kids in ways most adults can't understand as he enriched his incompetent family while he lectures us on morals?           Biden
BIDEN certainly not the disgraceful 45!!
. as a Biden supporter, please shut up. This couldn‚Äôt be further from the whole story.
Former VP Biden, didn‚Äôt you say we need to stay home and not open up? Now you say get to work?

Biden &amp; Trump should go on live TV &amp; take that cognitive test as the whole world is watching it.   #Biden2020
You say you‚Äôre not political but half of your twitter and podcast is political. Saying you want Biden in there and let him just sleep in the chair I think is irresponsible to keep pushing but you‚Äôre entitled to your opinion. I know you are more fair than some
Went to HS in Bethlehem. He‚Äôs the Biden of Scranton baseball players!
I have seen two of them. But, if i recall, say what ypu want about Hillary at least she had proud supporters and many of them. Biden has Nada.....
Trump would not have been up on Biden by 10, because of Trump‚Äôs racism, etc. and gaffes.
Northampton could be an Obama &gt; Trump &gt; Biden county.  The only question with Lackawanna is, "How much will Biden win by?"
Honestly. Good for Trump to just go ahead and say it. He isn‚Äôt looking for everyone‚Äôs vote. He wants white suburban women to be afraid if they don‚Äôt vote for him, Joe Biden will treat Black and Brown people like PEOPLE. MY GAWD THE HORROR.

You're talking about the double standard where the Donald gets eviscerated, but Joe Biden can't even remember how to put on pants and spouts senile gibberish 100x worse than this = *crickets*?

I'm in Northeast Pa, and I've seen plenty of Biden signs in the past few months after seeing only one earlier this year.
But um...Portland is only part of USA. You know, like, um... maybe the  Boris (I don't know who he is) is projecting anarchist rioting would spread across the USA under Biden?

This is as relevant as me saying I won't vote for Joe Biden.You did not beat Obama, you didn't even beat Biden. Obama would have cleaned your clock far worse than Biden will. Resign already!
Biden‚Äôs are made up Bunker boy‚Äôs are legit. Sorry booboo
MORE LIES FROM TRUMP. Joe Biden never said he wanted to defund the police. BTW YOUR CAMPAIGN ADS ARE STUPID. All you do is lie and everyone knows it. JOE BIDEN HAS GREAT ADS! Do you know why they‚Äôre great? Because what he says is true! HE‚ÄôS JUST A GREAT GUY AND YOU ARE A FAKE.
Biden Campaign Whittles VP Shortlist Down To Either Woman Or Man With Long Hair  via
Biden Goes Into Blank Stare After Forgetting Where He Is, Tries and Fails To Pass It Off as Joke
Only deficits under Democratic administrations are bad.  The GOP deficits are patriotic.  Need to get rid of the filibuster because the GOP will use deficits as an excuse to block any Biden initiative that requires investment.
It's a good thing Joe Biden isn't ambitious.
I‚Äôve donated, attended online events and celebrated a few of his policies, but if Biden continues this he will get no more help from me outside of my vote. The welcoming of Kasich and the comments of Dodd shows they are not understanding this moment - at all.
I am so so riled up about this. The fact that Biden has these assholes in his inner circle making decisions about the campaign is absolutely disgusting. And the fact that it has ended up in multiple news outlets makes it worse.
BIDEN WILL LOSE#EvictTrump
maybe, but I'd bet less than you think. I think its a real short list of folks who are on the fence with Biden but would be swayed by VP. Most folks on the left at this point know either they won't be feeding the machine or they can't sit by with Trump as the opponent.
It will be such a landslide for Biden that you will absolutely know on election night.
Yeah, man, why didn't Joe Biden send in the National Guard?  He really fell asleep at the Not His Job Right Now.
lol 17...7302020...  ...Donald J Trump - He Doesn't Give A Fuck About You!...  ...Don't Be Fooled...Trump Will Try Everything He Can To Discredit This Election...We Will Make Him Leave...  ...VOTE BIDEN VOTE BLUE!...    #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath  #FuckingMoron
It‚Äôs a Biden campaign ad.
I am using Biden so that I can understand why there is seemingly a disconnect here.
B/c Biden will be at a mass gathering where there essentially is no social distancing.  Yet, Mr. Biden is staying in his basement because of social distancing.  But the protesters do not socially distance and you claim there's no spike.  Do you understand the conflict now?
Assuming you statement is accurate, then it can only logically (and scientifically) assumed that there now exists no material impediment for Mr. Biden to be physically present at his political rallies and speeches.  If not, why not (i.e.please distinguish).
Was this a eulogy???? Or a commercial for Biden?
Jill Biden told Pittsburgh-area educators Tuesday that if her husband were already president, he would have had a plan to safely reopen schools. Teachers told her in a virtual call that they don‚Äôt feel safe going back to classrooms.

he is desperate and he is now trying to make it crash and burn and this will enrage him more and and people are and more will see how crazy he is.  now he is seeing that biden is thinking about harris a non appointee.  he is scared as a little child!
As of today, we now know trump is desperate and salty due to biden winnng the polls and his polling averages were oversampled/overpolled and didnt actual real primary elections his actual vote count was worse than any poll.
This is mainly who I am taking about. He is on the selection committee. He has been named in most of the leaks. So yes, surrogates. Donors going to donor, but to say they don‚Äôt have some control over this is false.

In November I may not be outside in bare feet and shorts, but I will be doing this exact dance if Joe Biden is declared the winner. Shortly after polls close, BTW, in a landslide.
I don‚Äôt know who will be selected as the Democrat VP pick, but I‚Äôm certain of one thing. Joe Biden won‚Äôt be making that choice. He‚Äôs owned by the radical Left.
At the very least, if joe Biden were president, we wouldn‚Äôt be at war with Portland
It is weird. Sanders endorsed Biden in April. Actually Sanders should be doing at least a little campaigning for Biden, but I don't think he has?
Trying to sell Biden as a left-wing nut is nuts.
Biden slams Trump for promoting false COVID-19 claims from 'crazy woman'
Hmmm....Someone that said ‚Äúracial jungle‚Äù is gonna do all of that?  Who ever is writing these needs to have a Joe Biden history lesson. Don‚Äôt worry, WE REMEMBER what he said and REALLY meant.
Biden- Rioters, protestors, anarchists, antifa, BLM, socialism   Trump- Police, military, Patriots, law and order, constitution and capitalism   Easy choice!!
Biden has already proven that he won‚Äôt be able to keep us safe without copying ideas from someone else (COVID-19 ring a bell?) What‚Äôs gonna happen when he has to come up with his OWN ideas for what we need for today‚Äôs market?  No thanks.
Absolutely! Mail in voting is exactly what the Deamoncrats want. Allowing them to change the vast majority of the votes over to the deamoncratic candidates. Once Biden is replaced as their candidate, odds are they will replace him with one of the hateful 4 unAmerican scam squad.
No! I think Joe Biden has cognitive decline! He could.become anyone's puppet!
"I'm Joe Biden, and I'm gonna catch a Joe Biden today!"
See, they are able to continue this cultist belief system because they know Biden will win in November, and then, when he does, they can say "Trump didn't get to finish his plan before he was forced to leave office by The Cabal".  It's a perfect plan.
The Biden q&amp;a was orchestrated and leads one to believe he is incapable of handling unscripted questions.
Burn to the ground and Biden becomes President. That in not acceptable.
That's why I am not voting for Joe Biden!
Joe Biden is not!
This is Nate's I need to cover my ass tweet in case things dramatically change in the race (which it will). We all know that by end of September the polls will narrow again as right leaning INs come home. Making it a 3-5 point Biden lead, making pop vote (solid D) and EC (lean D)

PA resident here. Biden has my vote 100%!   I am sooooo over this shitshow!
But just saw you are in NY, so it really doesnt matter..  Biden has already won NY so you can excercise your voting rights guilt free as it wont change election.
I can understand not liking Biden and not voting for him, but are you voting Trump?
Ha, no, they have been given the best hand ever. I think people in Biden's campaign are waking up to the fact that by the end of September many right leaning independents will go back to Trump regardless of Covid. So the Doc is right, they have to be clever to keep the senor vote
My sister, who dislikes Trump very much, said that Joe Biden looked like he is falling apart and Trump still looked strong!  My sister's unbiased opinion should make Democrats aware that that is what unbiased people opine about Joe Biden compared to Donald Trump -no debates yet!
What about Joe Biden who loved kids jumping on his lap; minority kids playing with his hairy legs; kissing, touching women;  sniffing little girls' and women's hair and enjoying every minute of it? Oh, and he was accused of rape too! Is that all right because he is Biden? Hello?
What about Joe Biden saying that he loved kids jumping on his lap and allowed minority kids to play with his hairy legs? Do you think he would have allowed White kids to play with his hairy legs since White mothers would have been offended by it?  What about his sniffing hair?
There isnt one. I am one of those trump to biden flippers, as is about 15 family members, all in PA.  I even talked to a friend, blind trumper, who is not voting.
Do I think Biden‚Äôs the answer? Hell no. But I know for a fact that 4 more years of a president that‚Äôs a sociopath with the temperament of a 12yr old, isn‚Äôt made for this. Tax cuts for the rich while we need extra to survive because billionaires need more. Right.
Grow up. He is the DEM candidate. It‚Äôs Biden or Trump. Let‚Äôs not have a rerun of 2016.

Yes, there's not anywhere near the amount of contempt for Biden right now as there was for Hillary in 2016.
now in the waning days of trump's first time, i feel biden and obama are soothing voices.  I am not scared, we will beat this attack on our nation
AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
wow you all follow my favorite peeps! including biden and obama!
Biden will courageously nominate Harris, the best of an outstanding field. Some Democratic bigfeet still oppose a woman AND black understudy. Biden sees a bigger panorama.  BTW Dodd is right about the movie and other big California media industries liking trump. No matter.
I‚Äôll take Trumps troops over Biden‚Äôs bitches any day of the week.  If he pulls the trigger he‚Äôll be thinning the herd... literally.
Try this:. Why did Biden call Trump a xenophobe when stopping flights from China and Europe?  Why did Pelosi stroll down Chinatown in San Fran in March claiming it was "safe"?  Why are the mobs not wearing masks and/or social distancing (and why the covid spike since the mobs)?
Biden is a sissy.
Biden hides from press, protesters and the general public.  "Hidin' Biden" is a very apt nickname.

And being a brain-dead moron who thinks Biden is great and votes Dem no matter what. I grew up liberal in NJ and quickly saw it for being the cult of hate that it is and you clearly show with support for D'OH BIDEN! #INSTABLOCKED
: "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who¬†isarticulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." No, but they are going to vote for Biden that called them "dirty, dumb, ugly, inarticulate," while "praising" Obama!
Biden said about Obama in 2007! Do you want anything more racist than this? "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who¬†isarticulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." In other words, " You're not dirty, dumb, ugly!"
Pennsylvania will go for the President. Republicans and Democrats are tired of the overreaching from our Governor and have clearly seen the economic difference between the Obama-Biden administration and our President‚Äôs. #TeamPA will #LeadRight
You have a valid point, I am not sure this election will end on Election Day...possibly not even on the Inauguration of hoping Joe Biden. Trump has a lot to lose and he doesn‚Äôt care how he stays in the game.
When Biden said this about Obama in 2007 : ' I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who¬†is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man.' He said, in order words, that Blacks were dirty, ugly, dumb...Wow! Not racist?
How is it Joe Biden‚Äôs protest? This is Trumps America- he‚Äôs the president, this is happening on his watch. Blood on his hands. Joe Biden will come in and clean it up. üôÑ
Real women don‚Äôt want weak men.  That‚Äôs a very weak man.  Biden is a racist... when he can remember how he feels about things.
Don‚Äôt write in unless you want Trump to win because all you are doing is taking a vote away from Biden. You might as well just vote for Trump.
Much much different.  Clinton is in the lower 40s.  Biden is above 50% in some states.  Trump is now incumbent.  Biden much less hated than Clinton.  I wouldn‚Äôt bet my house, but Biden is in much stronger position now compared to Clinton in ‚Äò16.
Everyone knows about the old crime bill he supported. Things change and in hindsight the bill was wrong. Biden learns from his mistakes unlike the orange clown who will continue to fail.
Problem is that Trump has lowered the expectations for Biden so much that all Biden needs to do in the 1st debate is show up and not drool to win.
There's alot who follow Trump just to harass him, so that 82 million is not necessarily his supporters. Democrats don't like Biden but you can bet they'd go out and vote for a dog with rabies in November just to get Trump out.
On January 20th he would be escorted from the White House by the military. That's what Biden has said.
You might win pa especially if Joe Biden is talking about getting rid of mfg jobs and higher taxes.

Biden's announcing his pick August 1. trump can't even get news coverage when he's on tv. Also, forewarned is forearmed.
A conservative Democrat ( in other words, a Republican). The _only_ demographic Biden is losing.
What do you mean "no free pass?" Are you suggesting that "pogroms" should be started against Trump supporters if Joe Biden wins? What you just suggested is so dangerous and divisive and you have the nerve to criticize Donald Trump!
The Republicans who vote for Joe Biden will be voting for a Communist regime!
I‚Äôm a Democrat and there‚Äôs no way in hell I can vote for Biden.  No way.
Do not vote for Joe Biden he will defund the police just vote nobody
I have rhe electoral college score right now at 233-,133 providing biden wins all that Hillary one.  Trump has made major states swing states, so. Iden only needs one swing state and florida to win, but i want this to be a massacre.

If Trump is a noted rapist then the same is true for Biden, because accusations mean guilt right? And where did I ever defend Trump, for the umpteenth time, you keep interjecting your boogeyman.
There clearly is a lot more to the story than you want to let on.
Uh, you support Biden who is accused of the sexual assault including penetrating and he refuses to allow anyone to access his files in the library of Delaware. Plus there are myriad images and videos and accusations against him for improper touching...of children!
please dont kneecap biden who at least marketed his campaign better than you
Biden vs trump
The Nov vote is simply a referendum on trump. Are you better off than 4 years ago? Do the actions of the current WH agree with your vision of American and family values? Let's be clear, this is binary. Trump if yes, Biden if no. Anything else is trump vote in our electoral system
Cool  tool enables you to look up Biden v Trump donors in your ZIP code. Keep double tapping on the map to bring up your area.

they are patriots and they also discussed their plans after biden is elected, they are going to continue to fight disinfo and help us heal

Oh, ok! You're talking about the team that is "feeding" Joe Biden's brain!
Joe Biden might elect a Black woman because Democrats need the Black vote! Otherwise, he wouldn't even consider it! You just have acknowledged that Democrats are also racists, just less than Trump. You finally told the truth: White Democrats are also racists! Congratulations!
What was 40 years ago, Biden referring to Blacks as dirty, ugly, dumb and inarticulate?  He said that in 2007! Also, he said that when he worked in minority communities, he learned about roaches. Roaches are associated with dirty.Racially, Democrats are the biggest hypocrites!

I‚Äôm not saying this isn‚Äôt true, I‚Äôm sure Trump is losing support but so far I know 10 people that have told pollsters that they are voting for Biden just to mess with the percentages.

Yup and a common Pennsylvania joke is there is a church or a bar on every corner. In my small town the joke was get smashed on Saturday night and crawl to church on Sunday. This Biden joke struck me as totally normal. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

WTF is Biden talking about this guy is out of his fucking mind
every president has been immoral in some completely unignorable reputation-shattering fashion  but of course biden was a vp and IS an aspiring president of course HE'D be in denial, or at least denyING this for the sake of the DNC's publicity üôÑüòí
If you think that Biden‚Äôs plan is to parrot what trump says, I don‚Äôt know where the f*ck you‚Äôve been getting your info from. OAN maybe? Info wars? Other news hacks?Lobbying Intensifies Among V.P. Candidates as Biden‚Äôs Search Nears an End
Mark my words.  #Hydroxychloroquineworks and works well.  I‚Äôm not a Dr or epidemiologist but I‚Äôm happy to go on the record and n say this works n the only reason it isn‚Äôt being used widespread is 2 suppress the economy in order for #biden to have a chance. #sick #corrupt #demonic
Joe Biden will fight for equality.  #Biden2020
I never heard of Karen Bass until now. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd make a wonderful president when Biden looses it for good. I will not say what I think of someone who would vote for Biden let alone Bass or Harris as running mates.
Here‚Äôs what bothers me. If the roles were reversed. Biden President, R legislature, they would be doing everything in their power to make Biden look bad...including not giving a dime to anyone. That day will come again soon
Yes, with Biden as POTUS and your ass in jail or a nursing home! Probably the latter!
Yessir. Can‚Äôt win the election without blaming something ungoldly on trump. That‚Äôs their whole scheme. Not to make Biden look good, that‚Äôs impossible. It‚Äôs to make trump look bad. CCP is to blame.
Had a friend already told today on the FB that Obama stopped so low to a campaign speech for Biden. Meanwhile, they love when DJT holds rallies during addresses of the American people during a pandemic.
It still will be big numbers for Biden, sorry and good bye.  You had your chance and failed, you only like those who like you and stupid you tweeted and lied yourself to the bottom.
I plan to vote for Biden.
200% voting for Joe Biden
Millions of cases, hundreds of thousands of deaths: it‚Äôs a hoax, don‚Äôt wear a mask, it‚Äôll be fine in a month  Biden up in the polls 3 months before Election Day: cancel the election this is serious people!!!

Is this an admission that you are going to  support and vote for BIDEN?
In Texas Biden 47% and Trump 41% even losing in that state. Hahaha on Trump!!
Really?  We have the turmoil now. It will take President Biden his first term just to restore dignity to the office.
Susan Rice? Really? So when Biden doesn't run in 2024 she can run a contested set of primaries? Tough enough for Gore. She's going to get the vote of all 5% of the electorate that really are into foreign policy. Really?
The people of this country messed up! You are the one that should be thinking about a VP, not Tweedledumb, aka Biden.
I will. Vote Biden. Vote blue. Fix the pumpkin.

Will you work for Joe Biden if he asks? BTW,...you ROCK! Thanks üëç
you stupid fuck. Pulling numbers out of your ass again. You are jealous of Fauci throwing out Nationals first pitch last week. Just like a little bitch. Watched Biden earlier. There was a REAL President. #FlushTheTurdNovember3rd
YES, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! VOTE BIDEN 2020!
Biden will be facing a cognitive test. He will fail
So you WANT me to vote for Biden?
I see a huge amount of enthusiasm for Biden.  Everyone I know is voting blue straight ticket.   #TrumpIsACompleteFailure  #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
...President as well, if anything happen to President Biden.
I guess you all have to satisfy yourselves with small triumphs when it's Hidin' Biden.

Anyone else not care at all who Biden picks for VP?  Like literally unless it‚Äôs someone who has served in the Trump administration or as a Republican governor, it matters not at all to me.
Biden is just a walking carcass
Your example is from a primary, where voters may choose someone other than their local for many reasons-- starting with they wanted to keep  him as senator. Name recognition,ability to pull votes,matters more than foreign policy expertise--Biden if elected could make her secstate

You know that I mean it in the sense of having a reason to support Biden and giving enough of a shit to vote for Biden because without Trump, Fox News is without a master. Don‚Äôt be obtuse.
Biden campaign declines?? Nah! The machine behind Biden declines!
I almost want to vote for Biden just to make the Fox News sycophants‚Äô heads explode. I won‚Äôt, but if I did, that might be why.
But also Biden is trash. Not praising trump but we are fucked either way.
biden sucks yawn
I‚Äôm enthusiastic too.  I can‚Äôt wait to vote for Joe Biden.   #Biden2020
A lot of bernie supporters would still get out to vote for biden if warren is on the ticket. Despite everything she has done, she is still way more progressive than most politicians and vice president is a stepping stone to being president in the future
The choice is clear, BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT! Nov 3  DUMP TRUMP!
Living in PA, I can verify that Biden has no chance.  Only people that want mail in voting in PA....Dems....don‚Äôt let it happen
Wait till November 3 AND WATCH US!  Lots of Biden signs on lawns in Barks County
I‚Äôm concerned Biden doesn‚Äôt have a biker club üôÑ
Trump is already a disaster. Biden can‚Äôt be any worse
Biden is ahead of where Hillary was, but let's not forget people thought Hillary also had it on lock. Biden's campaign and everyone who wants him to win should act as if he's not polling well, this is a very important election and he can't go on cruise control like Hillary did.
This man makes 7 mistakes worse than this before lunch each day, and I‚Äôm supposed to be worried about Biden when he simply misspeaks? What planet does this man and his followers live on? Seriously.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

I could give a shit about your stance on politics... it doesn‚Äôt matter.  If you‚Äôre not impressed by Biden‚Äôs ads for not just slandering his opponent because nobody fucking does that anymore, you‚Äôre an idiot.
Here‚Äôs why everyone is suddenly talking about Karen Bass as Biden‚Äôs potential VP
First high-profile Republican defection to Biden comes from swing-state Ohio  Trump is losing big time in every swing state including Ohio!!
Looking for Trouble: Trump to Send Federal "Police" to Milwaukee during Democratic Convention  Trump is causing his own problems with this phony incidents!! And it`s getting worse and it is failing in his attempt to blame Biden for Trump`s creation!!
From Black lives to 'white spectacle,' Portland protests have lost focus, civil rights leaders say  via  Trump`s false and phony message about Biden and it is NOT Law &amp; Order it is Trump CORRUPTION!!
I‚Äôm shocked, shocked Ted Cruz isn‚Äôt supporting Biden after the way the impeached president went after your wife and father. Loyalty sometimes makes strange bedfellows
Sorry it was obama and Biden and right on down the line. The evidence is undeniable. Crooked Obama administration will pay for it.
Where is the media on Biden. Oh wait he doesn‚Äôt do interviews and if he does. He gets softball question all the time. Time for Biden to come out of the basement and really allow the media to have at him!!
Defound?  Did you ever attend school?  Do you understand how to spell and construct a proper sentence?  Do you know how many years Biden has been in office?  He never accomplished anything in all of those years.
I sifted through a number of polls. 96% of Republicans support the President.  Only 70% of Democrats support Biden. Black support for the President, depending on the polls is anywhere from 20% to 40%. How can Biden possibly be ahead.
First high-profile Republican defection to Biden comes from swing-state Ohio
Biden can‚Äôt even complete a sentence lol
Props to Biden for running a legitimate campaign ad...  Opposed to the smear campaigns we get from the other side, and from both sides in the last election...  It was actually refreshing

You know what‚Äôs funny? When people speak out about every single issue (COVID, Sex Trafficking, Trump/Biden) EXCEPT black lives. Then when they‚Äôre confronted, ‚ÄúI have my conversations in person not on social media‚Äù .... yeah great story bro.. your racism is showing

You never trumpers think it‚Äôs so bad now. You have no idea what‚Äôs coming if Biden gets into office. This country is a straight path to hell. And you guys will be part of the blame!!!
I think Biden should try saying ‚ÄúPok√©mon go to the polls‚Äù it didn‚Äôt work for Hillary and Pok√©mon Go has been unpopular for several years now but hey
Exactly, they plan on massive mail-in voter fraud. Americans who are not caught up in Twitter world know something is wrong with Biden, Dems don't care , if they successfully steal the election, The VP will take over before the inauguration
There is no way Americans will vote for Biden, everyone knows this, The plan is to steal the election, notice how mail-in voting has just gone quiet. There was a bunch of stories...nothing. Dems are going to try and make the VP the President Watch and see WHO
Yes. All Democrats aren't radicals. Millions are hard-working American's with families to support, and protect. They see the lawlessness in the streets, and they see what will happen if Biden is elected.
ME: Biden. Vote. January. Trump. Prison.
