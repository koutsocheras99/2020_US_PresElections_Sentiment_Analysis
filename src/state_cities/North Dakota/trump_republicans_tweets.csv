Pre-Covid I think you have a valid argument. But Covid trump actions in my mind are not only insanely dangerous (literally way too many people are dead/dying) but also the reason why America is not going back to work. A few months of unemployment wouldve been understandable.

Someone tweeting about Trump's "low income" tweet while simultaneously living in some of the most racially and economically segregated neighborhoods in the country AND would fight tooth &amp; nail for the exact policy he is advocating is the worst kind of hypocrite.
I know way more than you will ever know about how this works.  Obama restricted business and Over regulated everything.   The reason we were thriving was President Trump removed several of the unnessary regs and lowered taxes.  That spurred our massive growth.
What happens to Trump if she is AG? That would be more fun.
You can think Trump's tweet was stupid AND not think that every low income person is a minority to gain the "muh racism" likes and r/t. But remember that all this faux outrage is mostly from people that hold their nose and quietly agree w/trump about this.
And yet Trump does it for free!!!  #Trump2020LandslideVictory

Trump is trying to orchestrate protests in swing states, hoping they turn (or helping them become) violent, in order to be the "law and order" candidate. He knows protests make good TV for Fox News, etc. Cynical and dangerous.
