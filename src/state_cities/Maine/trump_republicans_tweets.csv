How I feel about the Maine Dems infighting. Again. Still. Time immemorial.  You like Susan Collins? You like Trump? Cut the shit and focus on the bigger picture, for fucks sake. I love me some ideals, morals, but we have ZERO leeway right now.
Yeah, the 'trump derangement syndrome' accusations begin to fall flat when he's advocating the end of democracy.
I‚Äôd vote for a ham &amp; cheese sandwich before i vote for Donald J Trump again...
Will Trump win?
The only reason any conservative outlet is upset that Trump wants to delay the elections is that he‚Äôs finally committed the ultimate sin in their eyes:   He proved us hysterical liberals right.  It cannot be borne. We cannot have been right. We must be owned.

Boom, even guy who disbelieved #Muellerinvestigation, which was approved by watchdog counsel Ira Horowitz as legitimate, now understands #Trump call to postpone presidential election is utterly unConstitutional. The man called for another #impeachment. How far Trump has fallen.
The Trump.

The sky is are blue. wtf does that mean? Oh right, Trump loves the poorly educated.
...In wake of  threat to try &amp; postpone election, Schmidt noted he lacks #Constitutional right, but he warned #Trump will do all in his power to sow division chaos &amp; voter suppression. We see him slowing postal service &amp; martial law in Dem cities is possible...
Caught  tonight on MSNBC. He is conservative &amp; was Republican until renouncing #GOP on June 20, but he is consistently the brightest political commentator on TV. I always come away awed by his words &amp; perception of #Trump danger &amp; tonight was no exception...
He should have been kicked out of Congress a long time ago he's a Trump sycophant.
No doubt. It‚Äôs the IMPROVEMENT Trump will tout as ‚Äúthe economy is coming back so trust me‚Äù.
This is my favorite parody account. Hehehe Trump momentum. You are killing me son
You never want to put yourself in the position of wondering why you bet on Trump.

Could you imagine if Trump gave campaign speech or a political speech at a funeral? Disgusting and divisive #obamagate
I listened to the Trump propaganda hour today in the car.  Talk about low engery! Trump sounded like a defeated man. He kept whinning about mail in ballots and EVERYONE knows it will be a rigged election.  So what he‚Äôs saying when he loses, he say it was all voter fraud. Bullshit

Me too - I was little ashamed of myself for what I used to believe about dubya but damn proud of him. He was sincere and sweet and genuine. I hate trump, I really do.
Someone should ask Trump how often amendments are repealed. It's only happened once, almost 90 years ago.
And every other country knocked it out and is reopening just fine. Trump is the reason we haven't.
Wrong! Your trump bootlicking has gotten out of hand
Where am I wrong? You prefer Trump or his GOP enablers?
I think trump‚Äôs tweets on the election this morning likely triple its effectiveness.
That may be where his head is at but I think what Putin really wants is the end of western liberalism as a bulwark against populism/Nationalism/authoritarianism, and he  has achieved that. He wants Trump and Republicans in power, because they are tribalistic, not humanists.
Don‚Äôt be so dramatic. If we can survive Trump, we can certainly survive a President who actually knows how to govern, combined with being a decent human being.

"President Trump needs to be told by every Republican in Congress that he cannot postpone the federal election. Doing so would be illegal, unconstitutional and without precedent...Anyone who says otherwise should never be elected to Congress." again.
they really have no platform other than getting trump out of office
Trump needs to go, but on another note. Still no word on Radar?
Note that Trump decided to promote this guy (which is in violation of a few laws) the day Herman Cain died.
Arch conservative and Federalist Society co-founder Steven Calabresi has called for Trumps impeachment after Trump suggests delaying the election. He states that is as fascistic as it gets.   #Fam46 #Blue96Days #Fearless #TantrumBunkerBaby #Snarkys

Yes Trump is a coward..my brother volunteered for Vietnam..we need to elect Joe Biden
So how come no one seems to give a damn about what happened to Reality Winner? Its such a travesty. This young girl leaked Russia's involvement in the election and for the that she is going on her 4th year in prison. She is a hero and the criminals that help Trump get out free
Everybidy talks about the stress of the presidency aging people but Obama held up fine over 8 years. It‚Äôs the 4 years of Trump that got to him.
Exactly!!! Just  another Trump lie!! He &amp; his buddy Putin!!
1- trump blamed Cuomo for NY getting slammed  2- in his press conference just about an hour ago, trump named a bunch of red states and then said that it‚Äôs ‚Äúprobably not their governors‚Äô faults‚Äù
Yeah, full stop, that just looks like a guy that supports Trump.
You are right. I could tell as soon started reading it. Trump didn't right
I think if Trump wins, it will be a huge fraudulent election. Biden can never ever concede!
The voter fraud is in Trump' s camp &amp; how Trump can get  the Russians to rig the votes cast at the polls by fake people!!

Well myself I am a moderate-left independent. My only point here is Lincoln Project are not asking for a seat at the table to craft the D‚Äôs platform. They just want to get Trump out. For different reasons, of course. They aren‚Äôt trying to fool anyone about their politics
Trump is trying to stay out of jail he doesn't care about being president he just wants to stay out of jail.

Death by Trump
It is safe. Trump is gaslighting and pre-selling his excuse for why he lost.
Will there be anything done about it? No. Trump can spew shit night and day. SHOCKING? A diversion.
The people who drive me the most nuts (and I even have some in my extended family) are the ones who voted for him and then say but I didn't expect this.  Clearly you were not paying attention to last 30 yrs of the public life of Donald Trump
And he will incite his followers to violence. Biden is going to have to make it clear that if Trump/Barr order, or incite violence against the people that they will be held accountable.

Trump doing grave dancing on other country‚Äôs citizens.  No shame.
One might say it was planned this way. Nothing like the cover of a botched pandemic to rib America blind and just call it incompetence. Trump may be incompetent but those around him are professional thieves
Did Trump just say that the economic harm from shutdown probably caused more deaths than covid-19
This is quite frequent for Trump, as well as making up his own language.
Yes! Count the votes; end the bs.  And since all races are on the same ballot for voters, let‚Äôs see how many Republicans who are losing on election night back up Trump on ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Äù before all ballots are counted.
Of course he didn‚Äôt create it. Trump has not taken all necessary steps and precautions to prevent its spreading. He has lied and embraced harmful measures that can end fatally. He has divided and conflicted in a hateful, dangerous way.
You haven‚Äôt been paying attention, and that‚Äôs exactly why do many votes for trump. Time to wake up and smell the shit trump is peddling

I hope  didn‚Äôt kill anyone by not social distancing or wearing a mask. I guess following Trump‚Äôs advice instead of the CDC might have been a mistake.
Lol...political speech at a funeral.  Takes a real ass to do something as low as that. Cheap shot.  So nice of you to compliment a corrupted president that spied on Trump.  We should call him mini Nixon.  Lmfao
"impotent"  This word ought to be used more frequently in discussions about Donald Trump.
Maybe there are some guardrails after all. (Maybe.)
Unknown to trump the constitution gives the authority to the states how to run their elections   The only thing the federal government decides is the date and that the constitution left to congress, not the executive
A Republican is preferable to Trump. A Republican is preferable to the creatures that call themselves Republicans these days.
Yet the GOP and Trump campiagn solicit for vote by mail:
They won't lose their minds... You kidding .. a delayed election trump would have to leave office on Jan 3rd until an election could take place and the speaker of the house takes charge... Which is Pelosi... Yeah the left would hate President Pelosi...
The big 4 covered it, I wonder who covered trump who decided to speak at the same time as Obama was delivering the eulogy?
Yes. 100%. If Hermann Caine did not get coronavirus at the Trump rally, he would 100% be alive right now. That is not fiction. That‚Äôs not fake news. That‚Äôs now lame stream media. That‚Äôs an actual fact.
It seems you forgot about the tariffs Trump put on China and all of the steps he has taken to protect our financial system. And what about the action on HK after China passed the security law? Obama didn't do shit, he just appeased them and made the situation worse.

When FDR proposed packing the Supreme Court in the 30s, the country reacted in horror and he was forced to back off of the idea. Let's hope the reaction is the same today with Trump's shameless "Let's delay the election" talk.

Now that people have been reminded of what real heroes are,and a Real President gave John Lewis's Eulogy,I sincerely hope it will renew the energy and strength needed to push trump and his supporters back into their despicable existences,no post poning elections,I'm counting days

IM ANGRY BECAUSE TRUMP CAN DECIDE TO TAKE WEEKS TO SHUT DOWN A FUCKING APP AND SHIT TALK THE BLM MOVEMENT BUT DO NOTHING ABOUT COVID-19 AND THE KKK LIKE WHAT THE FUCK
Trump probably wants to do that but he can't because he has to handle the coronavirus. He seems very anti-China. Biden on the other hand wants to be allies with them and that cannot be.
God bless President Trump I believe he is the best president we have ever had I am an independent and after seeing what the shyster Democrats have done in our country tearing down all these cities I will vote for President Trump‚ùóÔ∏è

Michael- it also destroys the ‚Äúfraud‚Äù narrative when the GOP and Trump campaign actively solicit for vote by mail (not to mention, do it themselves).

imagine dying from a trump rally
It's just them reenforcing their little brand of irredeemable conservatives who just happen to think Trump is bad. I mean, great I guess if it helps move the dial on this bullshit. But I'll not be looking to them after November for some kind of attempt at political unity.
Is actually no one from Trump admin at John Lewis‚Äôs service?

I am dismayed that he does this on the day of John Lewis‚Äôs funeral. A man that believed voting rights were paramount.   Trump is a very sick man.
I read your entire tweet and I am truly sorry for the loss of Cain. As a liberal who did not believe in his politics I am sorry to say if you follow a huckster like trump - and play with fire (COVID) you are playing with fire. Trump doesn‚Äôt care about anyone but himself.
I keep saying it, I see no proof that Trump is ‚Äúbrave‚Äù enough to do this.
You think Trump is a "death cult" but don't apply that same term to George W Bush who started an illegal war that we're still in and has killed near 7000 service members and 100k Iraqis/afghans then guess what, you are the problem.
If you think that Trump should face consequences after he leaves office, but are ok with George W Bush than you are the problem
I do feel some sadness for those caught up in the Trump admins lies and the conspiracy theories around them. It‚Äôs sad when someone becomes so disconnected from reality that they actively seek out their own destruction. The self destruction is sad.
Indivisible: "Take a breath. Trump can‚Äôt delay the election." Yes. Knew that. The point is that the President called for delaying the election. He again does harm with his words.
So you‚Äôre saying Trump might lose the pizza connoisseur constituency?
He‚Äôs a close second for biggest American traitor to trump. Why media allow him to go on is beyond me

This is now an old Trump standard. Remember when "I really don't care do u?" was also just a stunt aimed at making the press crazy? And Covfefe?
It's not a dream.  It's a nightmare that none of you realize is written in the constitutional.  I'm guess Trump had no clue it's there ( shocking I know) when he wrote this..
Every day Trump trespasses on our Constitution and pushes his reckless will on our people.Dividing us is his goal as he perpetrates and encourages uncivil war amongst our own people. He delights in our broken-ness and laughs at the poor and non-whites. His walls imprison us.
Wear a mask. He was at a Trump rally without a mask on.
Point taken. Trump‚Äôs in the position of actively perpetrating damage by trampling existing laws daily with Barr as his enabler. Glad you have more positivity than I. The destruction continues and laws are mere inconveniences to Trump and his personal army.
Delay.  Trump will lose the election on November 3rd.
Well, then.  has spoken. So I guess it‚Äôs ‚Äòsafe‚Äô now for YOU  to say whether Trump can unilaterally delay the Election date. (If you dare go out on such a limb üôÑ)#mepolitics
Trump lacks the most common instincts for decency.  Even holding the office of president of the United  States could not move him to display even a basic act of dignity
Ignorance of or total contempt for the constitution is a prerequisite for employment in the trump administration

Herman Cain, former GOP presidential candidate, dies from #coronavirus at 74. Here's a picture of him from 6/20, maskless and in a large crowd with no physical distancing, at the Tulsa Trump rally.
People keep talking about how Trump decided to not attend John Lewis' service, as if he had a choice. There's no doubt in my mind he was ordered in no uncertain terms not to attend.
"I voted for trump and all I got was infected"
Trump! BC despite the far left doing anything they can to take him down so he doesn't expose them, he's done a multitude of things for this country to give us better lives individually &amp; economically going fwd &amp; he's not even done yet! Many don't know most of it becuz - COVID!

The economy is tanking, Herman Caine died for #tRump‚Äôs vanity, so he throws in the voting tweet to distract from the shitshow his administration is. Don‚Äôt be fooled. #TrumpIsLosing
They have been parading around John Lewis for days. The only air time Herman Cain will get is negative including the favorite headline of the soulless Democrats. ‚Äú Herman Cain contracted COVID-19 at the Trump Tesla Rally‚Äù
And the Trump Hate rally killed him! No masks, no social distancing and Cain died from attending the Tulsa shitshow! Nice work Trump another dead American, due to your negligence!
Guessing Pompeo is as stupid as Trump not know only Congress can delay an election!  But even better they don‚Äôt have the votes!  The election will proceed &amp; Trump will be humiliated!

Whoever touches Trump dies.
That ‚Äúsafe and secure‚Äù part is what Trump‚Äôs afraid of the most. Can‚Äôt hack mail in ballots.
Why don't you just say "I will keep the NY economy shut down as long as I have to, to kill Trump's economy, to lessen  his chances at being re-elected any way I can". Oh yeah and then add "But please tell him that NY needs money.  Lots of it. And if he doesn't send it he sucks".
Trump‚Äôs looking more like John Bolton in #OrangeFace.
now a #FakeNews  affiliated CNN Democrat "without portfolio" much like Stacy Abrams the wanna-be unelected "governor" of Georgia - both high ego attention seeking incompetents much like Obama.
Yeah that‚Äôs on Long Island, and THAT part of LI is definitely Trump country...
Anyone who thinks that Bullyboy Trump has any regard or respect for our Constitution is both stupid and delusional.
The scary part is when he is voted out, his private army (aka Bikers for Trump that he used as protection leading up to 2016 election) will probably gather at the White House to try and keep him from being removed during the inauguration.
My error. THREE ex-Presidents are in attendance at the funeral of Rep.John Lewis today, not two. Our current president,the Lunatic-in-Chief, did not as much as pay personal respects to our beloved patriot Lewis.Trump brings SHAME to our country every day.
Even if it were postponed (and it won‚Äôt be bc House would never consent), on 1/21/21 the new president would be the Speaker of the House or President Pro Tempore of the Senate, not Trump.  And both will be Dems.
100%.   Trump is the Boy Who Cried Election Fraud yet his party and campaign are soliciting for vote by mail:
Why did Trump tweet about the pizza place that‚Äôs in walking distance of my house
Psst...Trump supporters...the election is delayed until 2/29/21.
"Herman who? He died of what? Well, I didn't know him at all, that I can tell you."   --Trump soon

Trump is not aware that it takes an act of congress to change the date  Don't worry, Ms Pelosi is on it
Unlike most grateful Americans,Toxic Trump did not pay his respects to beloved patriot John Lewis as yet another visible racist act. White supremacists will love him for it, too. SHAME on this wretched carcass of a president.SHAME.
Unfortunately he was at the Oklahoma tRump rally (mask-less) Condolences to his family. Herman Cain, former Republican presidential hopeful, has died of the coronavirus, statement on his website says
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Great pictures of him attending tRump's Tulsa rally, packed in like sardines, and not a mask to be seen. I wonder if that's just a coincidence?
I do worry. With Barr‚Äôs assistance, Trump has been slithering around the law and flipping the bird at the Constitution.The obfuscation causes damage and mayhem. We are losing our country one vicious bite at a time. Slow erosion. Heartbreaking.
DISTRACTION DEFLECTION DESPERATION  Do not chase this nonsense.  Trump is panicking because reality is crashing into his delusion. His handlers can't keep it out anymore. Trump is alone in his bunker. No phantom armies. No secret weapons. He's done
They don‚Äôt care-they‚Äôre desperate. AND I think they know trump is going to delay the election in some way, already calling for it after call w/Putin, rig it with Russia. They‚Äôre counting on that.
And you folks killed him. All for some applause for Trump‚Äôs ego, that‚Äôs as disgraceful and pathetic as it gets. He needs to resign, now!

Trump demands his cult not wear masks, knowing they might well die‚Äîor kill their families. #RIPHermanCain. You sure showed your allegiance to the #GOPDeathCult right to the end.
The other thing is w GDP falling over the cliff, the number for Q3 will improve over that + Trump will ridiculously brag about it BUT the number for 3Q only gets released 30 days after the quarter ends and for Q3 that will be October 30. Kinda too late for him to make any hay.

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Even if it were postponed (it can‚Äôt be unless House agrees), the new president on 1/21 would be the Speaker of the House or President Pro Tempore of the Senate, not Trump.  Plus, all those GOP Senators and House members up for election wouldn‚Äôt retain their seats after 1/2.
Trump is a direct and immediate threat to Democracy. Pass along.
They know they have lost so they are taking everything. Imagine leasing a furnished apartment and when the lease is up you go to change the locks and find the furnishings are gone. That‚Äôs Trump
Trump knows he can‚Äôt change the election date. Don‚Äôt be so easily fooled by the con. He successfully played everybody, it seems, by diverting attention away from today‚Äôs economic news. Keep your eyes on the fucking ball.
Even if it were postponed past 1/21/21, the new president would be the Speaker of the House or President Pro Tempore of the Senate, not Trump.

President Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
So *ALL* of the Congressional members, GOP and Dem, need to come out and strongly condemn any attempt to delay our elections. Mr Trump does not have the authority to do so, and it needs to be explained to him (and to his followers) that it is NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. #Election2020
Donald Trump basically just admitted that he thinks he will lose the 2020 presidential election.  Finally, something good has happened this year.
The House would never agree. And even it were postponed past 1/21/21, the new president would be the Speaker of the House or President Pro Tempore of the Senate, not Trump.

Trump‚Äôs passing mention about delaying the #election is ridiculous and everyone knows it.   So how about the major networks don‚Äôt bother to give it credibility by not even talking about it today?
Since when has dictator Trump ever let the Constitution get in the way of his reckless mayhem? He will stop st nothing to perpetrate damage on our people, and Bully Barr will help him to it.

Trump floats delaying 2020 election  via   One thing is true: #TrumpThreatensAmerica makes every day worse
Surely Trump's supporters who claim to love the country and democracy will rush to condemn even the idea of not having an election.
US elections have never been delayed for any reason (pandemic, war, natural disaster, etc.) and that *needs* to remain the case if we are to remain a democracy.  Thankfully Congress, not Trump, decides this.  Call your senator to demand they commit to opposing this (202) 224-3121
1. Only Congress can change the date of federal elections. 2. There's no evidence of widespread voter fraud. 3. Mail-in voting is the same thing as absentee voting.
There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, but the president wants to delay the November election anyway.
So Trump is floating the idea of delaying the election because of his conspiracy theory of mail in voter fraud. Bullshit! There is no evidence to support his theory, so with so many of his theories debunked. The election should be held as planned
Trump floats the idea üí° to delay the election üó≥ in November!

Trump is a lying lynatic. Everyone should understand that. He is a pathological liar. He has caused a lot of suffering over the course of his lifetime. He does not understand Pleiadieans/the plan. Trust me. He only wants fame and fortune.
Like really, Trump is not a Russian asset. Hands down, no fucking way. Trump is an idiot who consistently gets used by people more powerful than he is (MBS/Turkey) not just Putin.
It's fucking insane that people actually believe this shit. This guy is a former Republican operative who is pushing Russia blaming because then he doesn't have to answer for how his actions (as a former right wing operative) have lead to the rise of Trump and right wing populism
I mean, there's a pretty good chance the Republic won't survive another Trump term. It will definitely survive Biden. That's enough.

Ha I salute you for your football perseverance.   Look at it this way: the 2 yrs of clear Trump Russia f*ckery didn‚Äôt move the needle much + that was THE biggest story then. I just don‚Äôt think anyone cares about it anymore, esp w a pandemic/ cratering economy/ social unrest.
How is it fake? But please know that "because I hate Trump" is NOT an answer.
TRUMP FBI TOWER
And Twitter, FB &amp; YouTube all suppressed their video &amp; google suppressed their ‚ÄúFrontlineDoctors‚Äù website! And suppressed Trump &amp; Trump Jr from sharing it on Twitter. That tells u they‚Äôre directly over the CDC/Fauci/Gates target!
Maine and yes governor Janet Mills has been doing a great job. Democrat of course she listens to the science and hates Trump.
I love that idea....maybe you can also get Trump to come in &amp; say ‚ÄúDr. Fauci, YOU‚ÄôRE FIRED‚Äù!
Not only is Trump a moron but he is a coward. If you‚Äôre a Trumper don‚Äôt you think Putin, Xi and Kim know that?
"It was just over three months ago President Trump predicted the U.S. would lose 50-to-60-thousand people from coronavirus. He wasn't even close. Tonight the death toll climbed to over 150-thousand." ---Lester Holt's opening words on NBC Nightly News
America has always been great and it has nothing to do with Donald Trump
Sure,  publicly said she didn't vote for Trump. Since then, she has continued to leverage her "moderation" to insure power among  while doing almost nothing to push forward recommendations of the 2012  postmortem.  7/
The  article confirms my hunch. And it explains why I felt so uncomfortable and unpersuaded when I heard  speak  in late October 2016. 4/
Trump isn‚Äôt lying for the first time ever, nobody likes him
Trump is self-deep-stating himself.
Speaking about Mencken and the hilarious Trump.
Dully Elect President of the USA. You will get your ratings when you are re-elected in November! We love your personality! Look at Eisenhower Park Back The Blue Rally! Trump 2020! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üôèüèªüôèüèª
From what? I‚Äôm not being facetious here. This guy‚Äôs credibility needs to be kneecapped. The only way Trump can win (and I don‚Äôt think it will work) is to try to invalidate hosts of Mail-in ballots. Barr is ready to help. It doesn‚Äôt pay to make an  issue out of his lawlessness?
"The public needs to know whether Attorney General Barr thinks President Trump can conduct mass surveillance of protesters without congressional authorization."
A couple. I was never a fan of Trump, but I didn't judge anyone for their choice. People can always prove people wrong. In this case he failed and my biggest gripe is with those blindly following/supporting him...and not even for any big accomplishments in 4 years.
Trump is whining about Fauci having a better approval rating than he does
Trump:  Nobody approves of you BECAUSE YOU ARE KILLING US ON THE DAILY.
Trump dying on this hydroxychloroquine hill is the dumbest, most mystifying thing in a dumb, mystifying Presidency.
