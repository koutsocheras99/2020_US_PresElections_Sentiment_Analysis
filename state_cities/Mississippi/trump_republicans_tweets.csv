President Donald Trump has threatened to cut federal funding from schools that don’t reopen in September. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner says the president cannot unilaterally take funding away from schools.
My Uncle was a marine at Guam. He had that book. I remember him explaining it to me. I thought it was melodrama when I was eight. But Trump really is a treasonous weasel.
❤️ because at the end of the day, black lives matter too 🦋 proud to support the Lakers esp since Donald Trump will be pissed 🤗
Thread by  Wanna see how disregarding facts and believing Trump and the GOP's BS can kill you? A thread: First of all, I can any cable news channel talk about the coronavirus because they keep giving us whole numbers, which means absolute…
Sure, it will have to after the inauguration.  No trlling what a lame duck Trump will try.  😝
Came back from an AWESOME vacation in Alabama and it’s DEFINITELY Trump country!! So I wore my gear today while I headed back home! Stopping at a couple of places and got nods from supporters!❤️#MAGA #TRUMP2020 #NewProfilePic (photo credit from my aunt
Trump support ultimately killed him.
the president cannot delay an election without congressional approval, it is UNCONSTITUTIONAL, honestly it looks like Trump is scared because he’s about to get crushed in November, and instead of actually leading his country he wants to cheat his way back in office
Trump doesn’t love America! He only loves his supporters and no one else! The #trumpvirus was his fault! He took no action and wanted to argue with the experts!
Madonna Endorses Trump’s ‘Demon Sperm’ COVID Doctor Stella Immanuel | Michael Stone
Trump: “It’s a tiny percent of one percent” of young people severely affected by Covid 19. “We must open our schools”
Worry about the Trumpvirus and our troops that trump could care less about. It’s amazing Trump is fucking up America but you want to criticize a man no longer in office
Trump: “Smart people know it, stupid people don’t know it” regarding faults of mail-in voting.
Trump: “This is the opposite of voter ID. The Democrats love it, the Republicans hate it.”
Trump: “We are in favor of absentee voting, but it’s much different than mail-in”.
Trump says mail-in voting trial runs in some places have been a disaster.
Trump: “Americans always rise to the challenge and we will emerge more resilient”
Trump: “To pass a bill, Democrats must reject the extreme partisan voices in their party”
Trump: “children are at the lowest risk of any age group from the virus... we must get them safely back in school”
Trump: “We need Democrat’s to join us to pass additional economic relief”
Just another guy that refused to wear a mask and that was one of Trump’s puppets... Rip though and to the ones who have died since he spread the virus around to others
Trump: mortality rate from Covid in those over the age of 18 is 85 percent lower than it was in April.
Trump: visit  if you have recovered from the virus, and donate plasma.
Trump: Everyone, even healthy young people, should be taking extraordinary care.
Trump: we now know a great deal about the virus. Half of the deaths come from less than 1% of population. Average age of those who die is 78.
Trump: primary purpose of a shutdown was to flatten the curve... we did the right thing initially and saved millions of lives.
President Trump is speaking right now regarding Covid-19.
Watch Live: President Trump to hold press conference
If I see ONE PERSON who whined about “not getting to vote” on the state flag change come out in support of Trump’s tweet about the election, I will have a full-blown come apart.
Well ma’am, I am not really spouting anything. I am responding to the post that I choose to respond to; and I respond with the word of God. I am not judging people! I’m saying we need to give Trump another 4 because we’ve seen a lot of good done for this country thus far.
Pretty sure that trump was at a church in Arizona last month. Just say dumb stuff.
What do y'all think? The video from 'America's Frontline Doctors' has been wiped from Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.
Probably not. It’s like if it’s that bad where you have to sign a waiver, he shouldn’t have gone . That’s crazy. Trump said if you die don’t blame me 😂🤣😂🤣 wow
BLM protestors aren’t running the country so they are a small minority and people don’t even know their names. Trump told these people not to wear a mask and you know his followers love their savior trump
You are free to laugh! You have freedom because people stand-up to big government. We finally have a man with true grit in the White House! Trump is the best we have had yet! Trump is a businessman: exactly what Americans needed! Get your head out of the sand and look around.
Statement from the Press Secretary Regarding the Implementation of President Trump’s Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship  via
Following President Donald Trump's suggestion to delay the 2020 presidential election, politicians from Mississippi reacted to his statement.
Strangely I feel like today Trump has succumbed to the abyss.
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law The president does not have the power himself to move the date of the election, which was set by an 1845 federal law.      #MPBOnline
Just like when I see racist comments, people against masks, or people bitching about bar closures due to covid and/or comments FOR racial injustice I see “MAGA” trump, conservative and Christian in the bio.. Equally just as disgusting
Why were there SOOOOOO many Trump supporters watching that eulogy is beyond me, like why are y’all even watching this!?!?
Tell the truth - can you see Trump doing eulogies for any elected official? Bush 1 and 2, Clinton, and Obama - all have down them. They were presidential!   Can you see that narcissistic idiot speaking at Herman Cain's funeral?  SMH
Six members of an advance team... tested positive for the virus while in Tulsa, with another two campaign staffers testing positive after the event itself.  staff were all tested before the rally started, these two were negative before.
Bush was not a good president but he is a good and honorable man. It’s a shame that it took someone like trump to make some realize that. Hopefully in the future we don’t call every republican racist (like we did with bush, McCain, Romney) now that we see an actual racist
Six of his aides tested positive.
Trump is a disaster for americans
Other Trump aides who worked at the Tulsa rally contracted #covid19 also.
Trump and many members of his administration—along with our servicemen and women—vote by mail. Why is it okay for them and not everyone else?
Another Take; Herman Cain died from attending a tRump rally in the middle of a pandemic.
Same I’ll wait 8 hours if I have to. Trump has ruined America. He and his porn star wife need to head back to Hollywood
Defend the Clean Air Act from Trump Administration Attack
Notice when the opportunity arises to be in the room with REAL political talents #trump always skips out?
How many people will have to die in this cabinet for Trump gets it???#TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
The same reason folks vote for Trump
They need to get Trump in on this, we know he can at least get $3.76 out of it.
Trump is not there?
Imagine not voting for trump because he’s racist and sexist and turning around to vote for Biden. It’s just silly at this point.
Watching the John Lewis funeral makes me recognize just how bad things are. Trump has black folks giving George W. Bush a standing ovation.
I will say Herman Cain was a notable Trump surrogate - but I wouldn't consider him High Profile. Until a current Senator, Governor, or cabinet member dies from it, I don't think Republicans will take it seriously.
You jumped on this purely because he supported Trump I’m checking your page and not one thing about Andrew, Nadler, nor black face Northam. Just a jab at the president. Using a black mans death for clout 🤮
yes ma'am - good as the day is long!   Died on that hill - to prop up Trump!? SMH
President Trump tweeted the idea that the election could be moved because of COVID-19.    Do you support this idea?

Imagine dying over a Trump rally.
...and yet, no one has uttered a word about Trump’s golf trips that costed tax payers over $340 million dollars.
I wrote your column’s title for you “Henry Olsen accused Trump of being a normal president.  He should know better.”
Trump wanted them packed in tight for the cameras and the place was half empty. This could have been avoided.
Everything and everyone Trump touches dies.
THERE IS NO DEBATE!!!
MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe’ implies Trump has financial ties to hydroxychloroquine: ‘Follow the money’   ⁦⁦ who you going to kill today Joe????? Have a certain intern in mind???
His estate should sue the shit out of the Trump campaign for negligence and wrongful death.
Trump suggests delaying November election, something he doesn't have the power to do
President Donald Trump suggested delaying the 2020 presidential election on Thursday, tweeting it will be “the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history.”
Trump... The Distractor in Chief!! Every Republican needs to be speaking out!  It’s time to get that white jacket that ties in the back ready!
Trump doesn’t have a master plan. He’s a fly by the seat of his pants, corrupt dilettante.
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail
President Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
I’m getting real sick of government officials who dance around the stupidity of the GOP’s COVID response. FDA on  refused to discredit Rep. Gohmert for saying that his mask gave him COVID/refused to dismiss Trump’s recurring claims about hydroxy. 🤯 What is happening.
Keep up this idiotic strategy because  most suburban voters see Trump's racism and don't like it.  This isn't 1962, dude.
Puh-lease. Barr and Trump shit all over the rule of law every day.    Remind me how many people from the Trump campaign have gone to jail, Steve? I lose count.
They also support trump but that don’t mean the food ain’t good 😋
Whoa there! He didn’t say anything about poor people being black. I’m poor and I’m white and I’m voting for Trump because I’m also smart and I believe in democracy not socialism.
Trump is not RESPONSIBLE for anyone dying. Please before you speak, put your brain in gear so you don’t run off a mountain of lies!
"Mr. Trump didn’t hijack the Republican Party. He is the logical conclusion of what the party became over the past 50 or so years, a natural product of the seeds of race-baiting, self-deception and anger that now dominate it."

Trump is hated by at least 50% of voters and how does he try to win over to the dark side....pity...cause nobody likes me!!!
The biggest problem the conservative movement faces after Trump - continuously changed the goalposts on who or what it means to be a true conservative   If you don't stand for something you will definitely fall for anything.
We’re dealing with an existential threat right now known as Donald Trump. Whether it’s Biden, Sanders or Warren, it will take either one a while to clean up the mess. We’re gonna play catch-up with the pandemic for months. That has to be addressed before we can do anything else.
Gary - I know he's (Trump) your hero - but the Lincoln Project exists for a reason, that's how bad it is.
Y’all Trump talking bout drug testing for food stamps. Child ain’t nobody going be on food stamps. 😂😂😂
1/That’s what they don’t seem too get. Biden sounds more progressive now than I thought he would. Yes, I rather he be a Sanders/Warren progressive, and I want corporate money out of politics, but we’ll get absolutely none of what we want with Trump.
A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump.
It does work and I love trump but that’s funny
The Trump administration is considering a plan that would allow states to require mandatory drug testing for some food stamp recipients.
The Doctors?
A seven figure ad buy is happening in Texas. Trump is pulling ads in MI. Rumors of our death have been highly exaggerated. ✌️

lmaooo so trump tryna shut down all social media platforms. 💀
Trump has demonstrated an unprecedented level of corruption and disregard for democratic norms. You can tell that by how he has done in this conservative Supreme Court. He’s one of the most seemly men to hold the office.
After all the nonsense that’s happened in the last 3 plus years. I can’t imagine that people who weren’t Trump supporters to begin with would hop on the MAGA train. For those of us who opposed him, he is, who we said he was, an unethical racist traitor.
Nobody likes trump , tate.  He knows it.
Trump really illegal for all this stock pumping he stay doing smh 🤦🏾‍♂️ highkey wish I knew lol
He’s a sitting President what are they shy about? Kinda upends your enthusiasm argument. If the undecided break evenly Trump is toast.
Upon closely inspecting numerous studies that I made up this morning, the phenomena introduced by Trump's new #COVID19 quack doctor known as "Demon Sex" has proven to be the cure for #coronavirus. I hope to be booked on Tucker tonight. TREMENDOUS PROGRESS! #DemonSperm
You realize with 40% you can’t get that many electoral votes. Those libertarian votes are would be Trump voters.

President Trump said Tuesday that he has not spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin about U.S. intelligence reports of Russian bounties given to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan.
I really wish Joe Biden was who Trump’s tweets say he is.
Is that Trump’s 2020 campaign slogan?
President Trump, and so called "patriots". Cant wait for both to be over.
I think he’s right Trump is using this virus to kill innocent ppl to control the population to save the American economy  probably the reason why he’s forcing schools to open sad world we live in 🤦🏽‍♂️
There’s a money trail back to tRump and billionaire Republican mega donors. There’s always a money trail on everything he does.
Trump will eviscerate any of them, although Susan Rice concerns me more than any of them.
If Trump says something about these seeds, whatever he says, the Press, Science Community, Democrats will come out and take the opposite position.
Biden is anyone's choice? They will only win by cheating so Trump supporters have to show up100 times stronger to make up for it.
He has lieitis like Trump!!
Google Twitter etc know that they are losing to Trump and if he doesn't reign in their unimpeded power, they will win.
Y'all the new doctor appointed by Trump. IKYL 😳😧
I'm glad the medical totalitarians aren't getting their wishes while Trump is in power. Weird how so many anti-Trump Democrats want to give Trump and the GOP run feds power to strangle the entire economy (ie, all people, all life) and think they'd give it up in a month or two.
Totally agree.  Be careful, Donald Trump, Jr. got thrown off Twitter for this.  Lmao.  I am so sick of this BS. Hugs!

" The FDA isn't anything special"    The FDA is why we don't have fraudsters like trump peddling snake oil on every corner.  Grow up.
I thank God once a week that the 2016 election was 2 weeks before I turned 18, because I definitely would have voted for trump and I don’t think I could live with myself. Hard enough to believe I used to be that.
Ask her why there is a truckload of money for a new FBI HG across the street from a Trump Hotel?
If they don’t find another location then Trump should hold a rally and either debate a empty chair or put a Biden mannequin in it. Same difference.
Maybe you should worry about the 20000 lies  Trump has spewed out during his presidency
Trump is making money off of it that's the answer. It's not complicated.
#MorningJoe   It takes an act of supreme intellectual dishonesty to claim both sides engage in the kind of hateful and divisive rhetoric that trump engages in.  Call it out Joe and Mika.
For once Please. Just.Stop. You never say anything of substance. Is your entire campaign based on how far your head will fit up Trump’s ass. Watching you constantly suck up to that Cheeto is cringeworthy. Apparently you’re not ashamed, but we’re embarrassed for you...
You need to read  book, Hiding in Plain Sight. Sarah explains what has happened to our country and how Trump was elected.
- trust me  did the right thing for once in his life. His presence would have been a dishonor to    Trump does not and can not understand someone of the moral character John Lewis.   #RIPJohnLewis #MorningJoe
This market has been obviously unnatural for so long people believed it is real.  I have people making 32,500 but Trump supporters bragging about the DOW. I can’t .
Great strategy you ask me. Let trump keep sticking his foot in his mouth and displaying his incompetence. Biden's political career speaks for itself, good or bad. By now, people have made up their minds about both candidates. You either want stability or more chaos.
I saw this video during the 2016 campaign. All of these videos were available. The people who voted for Trump didn't care.  He spoke their language.
Is this trump cousin?

always cheers for him to get it. He came up with the idea for a Trump Crimes Commission. We definitely need that.
Exactly—they are behind TRUMP. We’ve heard Governor Cuomo in MULTIP Press Conferences tell NYPD that they must “DO THEIR JOB” and enforce the Executive Orders BC they are THE LAW. SO Pete took a swipe at you knowing NYPD IS RESPONSIBLE for enforcing the Governor’s orders.
Well there you have it, the heir apparent to the Republican Party calling slavery a “necessary evil”. It isn’t just tRump, it never really ever was, the party of hate must thrown out of power.

“The American catastrophe seems to get worse every day, but the events in Portland have particularly alarmed me as a kind of strategic experiment for fascism. The playbook from the German fall of democracy in 1933 seems well in place."
No. The pursuit of replacing freedom and capitalism with Marxism and tyranny is what’s ruining. Trump, like him or not, made life better.  Dems will make it worse.
THE ENEMY WITHIN. Democrat mayors clearly fine with the ruin of their cities as long as it helps their party's prospects in November. Is that sedition or treason? Or some bizarre combination thereof?
Trump politically and Americans who genuinely love their country will rue the day POTUS did not arrest seditious mayors and crush the insurrection in the streets when it first began. Way too late now to do it cheaply, if at all. Wait for the cauldron of excrement to boil over.
Beating Trump is not enough, we have to crush Trumpism.
They’re laying hands on him and Trump can’t even play the part well enough to close his ‘effing’ eyes. Probably scared one of black guys might steal something from him.

“I aced it. I aced the test,” Trump said. “I guarantee you that Joe Biden could not answer those questions, and I answered all 35 questions correctly."
“I aced it. I aced the test,” Trump said. “I guarantee you that Joe Biden could not answer those questions, and I answered all 35 questions correctly."
were you in the room? were you part of the decision making process? He has admitted to answering a question in a  deleted tweet that Liberals suck. That said from all appearances this firing was a punitive action for stating a fact that Trump is the President, and open to schools
I disagree, but I understand how you feel, I do, and we’ve all felt that way at some point during this hellscape that is tRump’s America. But he will lose, but only if everyone who can vote gets out and votes. Take care
This is proof that local and state elections matter just as much as the presidential election. Trump had to put on a mask for press, NOW Tate cares so much.

I'm so grateful to Sarah Cooper  because now, whenever I hear Trump speak, instead of cringing and feeling a bit of PTSD, I see her mouthing the words and I laugh.
Agree, but if they are doing earmarks, get Trump to extend/expand the EV federal tax credits.

Didn’t say anything about trump cause trump don’t give a dam about neither side as long as he got the power just sad you still can’t see that by now

To do what? What issue are we movable on? Austerity? Budgeting? They don’t reality care about that. They want Trump gone and to quickly rehab a Nikki Haley type.
If they want to try some fiscal responsibility shit.... which we know was always crap. The key issues are cultural. We aren’t budging. They were embarrassed by Trump. They can go and try to reorganize. I don’t care.
Go Trump!!!!!  👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This is genius...but sadly I don’t even live in Cali..i blame trump.
You’re only mad that i didn’t say it about trump. When the reality is I don’t support any high figure in the government doing something of that nature during a time like this. But thanks for your response.
Trump doesn’t do anything unless it benefits him.
People need to understand that if people back then had the means of learning g and educating themselves things may have been different. People went along with people who had power hmmm similar to Trump. Women didn’t have rights either and were treated just as bad just as Indians
Rule number one with Trump is that he is loyal only to himself.

I’m most certainly not. You have no clue of my opinions on Trump. And I never said anything about him throwing the pitch.
I’m not a Trump supporter in anyway. But this could be a big moment for unity. Imagine if all the players were to kneel right before he came out. Or maybe he’ll actually wear a mask and all of the haters will have no retort 🤷🏾‍♂️. Probably unlikely but I’m an optimist

President Donald Trump announced that he has scrubbed his planned Republican National Convention scheduled for Florida next month, citing a “flare-up” of the coronavirus.
Seriously, Trump is a block and the presidency is a circle. Just doesn’t fit.
You said it’s not under Trump. If this were to happen under Biden, would it be under him? I’m trying to understand your logic.
#Biden seems to be promising to put things back the way they were, that is, pre-Trump. If he succeeds in this, he will be laying the foundation for another Trump, only worse. I hope to God he knows this, or his presidency will be a 21st Century version of the #WeimarRepublic.

President Trump is expected to sign executive orders as early as Friday that are designed to lower drug prices, according to a report from The Hill.
They don’t listen to #facts. No matter what. Also, just my opinion— stepped up and basically DID THE JOB of a President. TY God! His ratings soared. And I believe Trump COULDN’T stand it. So he whispered into his “State News”ears to hurt Governor Cuomo any way possible
Trump’s America was February and before.. This is chaos brought to us by the left to take America’s freedom and rights. Media is ran by the left and they got majority hooked up like a fish.

Barack is no longer president. He can’t fix the problem. Trump has the power now to do that. It’s common sense.
He’s not the president anymore, Trump is. Even though Chicago is Barack’s hometown, he can’t fix the problem. As usual, Trump pins the blame on everyone else but himself. Like he said before, he don’t take responsibility. Sad, but true. 🤷🏾‍♀️

This interview is with Tim Russert. Tim Russert died in 2008.  Also in 2008, your dad spoke glowingly of Nancy Pelosi, said she should've pushed harder to impeach George W. Bush, and said Bill Clinton's impeachment scandal was over something "unimportant."
“The way he deals with people based on the color of their skin, their national origin is absolutely sickening,” the former vice president said. “No sitting president has ever done this. Never, never, never.”
Most libertarians I know don’t subscribe to the whole “lesser of two evils thing” and even if they do idk about them being pro trump because he’s been shite when it comes to individual rights.

Enjoyed interviewing Charles Evers in 2009  at his radio station. Confidant of the Kennedys, became a Republican when Dems booed Teddy. 2008 he urged radio listeners to vote for Obama, Cochran, Wicker. Supported Obama &amp; Trump.  A unique American story.

Didn’t I see on You Tube - saying the left had a video of them “taking out” a clone of Trump ?
Weren’t the calling Regan and bush racist? So how is trump the first? Lmao
If you’re wondering why a Kentuckian like  wants to impeach Gov. Cuomo, you should take into account the fact that Trump committed most of his known state-level felonies in New York and needs a new, Republican governor to be pardoned for them.
Don, I think this is one of those cases where the folks who buy it will be the folks who have already bought it. It may help Trump gin up his base, but for the most part it’ll only work on folks who already find his photographs of Ukrainian protests sufficient.
The administration’s moves now to “dominate” the streets risks backlash in both parties. “If there is something that is perceived as too strong and bordering on totalitarianism, that’s not right." Republican chairman in Sauk County, Wis.It’s President Trump incase you forgot!
I don't think there is any stunt too low for Trump to try.  He seems to have enough kompromat on GOP leaders to get them to go along with whatever he wants. SCOTUS still seems to have an independent mind. They present the last safety net.
I think the whole thing is to get everyone spitting feathers about "Trump is trying a coup" and not talking about the economic collapse.  USA has the worst of both worlds- massive economic damage and Covid is raging out of control.
Seen it suggested it is just a distraction for the US losing one third of its economy due to Covid on Trump's watch.  Trumps is a master of changing the subject. Been caught letting Russia kill American troops? No problem for Trum. He just says something outrageously racist.
And so begins the coup. What remains of the American republic is at serious risk.

Trump angers the defence hawks by obeying his master and reducing US troops in Germany.  But he needs a distraction from yet another act of treason...  Racism! His base love it. The lefties get distracted. Trump does play this game well.
Job 1 of the next US President will be to try to repair the damage done by Trump to the western alliance. I suspect it is too late.  Won't be long before Putin starts trying to exert extra influence on his western border to push limits and norms.
This Trump clown AGAIN delivering for his master in the Kremlin. Only one winner in all this. Putin's kompromat vids must be really good.
Yes Trump doesn't need to attend a political rally, even on Capitol Hill

Okay, but this is funny. Time to roll out the Baby Trump! 😂😂
Opinions are exactly that of my employer, Donald Trump.
Sweet suffering f*ck! I thought this had to be a satirical post. Trump is saying they are going to do testing and clinical trials in parallel with development?   He really is a moron. This is like "we don't know if the plane with have 2 engines or 4 but we can start testing it".
He has to try something.  He will use infirmity to duck prosecution after leaving office but his kids are looking at years of prosecutions. He will try to haggle an immunity deal for his family in return for leaving without force.  A very Trump-like "Justice? No peace!"
Who cares about his nation's security? Certainly not Trump.  Imagine his Presidential Daily Briefing contained a "UBL determined to attack America" type alert. Private Bonespurs would be on the golf course or cooking up another drug deal with a foreign dictator.

It saddens me that the entire movement has been reduced to this; after dark for a potential trump campaign photo op. Anyone with a god damn brain should be able to see what’s going on.
Clear as day what Trump is about to try.  GW Bush nudged a coin toss in his own favour.  Nixon tried to steal an election he won in a landslide anyway. Kennedy was at it but probably won in 1960 anyway.  This isn't normal politics.  This is a battle of ok versus evil.

Desperate men do desperate things, and Trump is a desperate man. He’s facing ruin and prison.  My take is that the “delay” strategy is a signal to supporters of what’s to come. This should give Qanon time to fabricate a conspiracy and sell it while the plan goes into motion.
Trump attended a fundraiser in Texas without a mask on the day the US hit 150,000 coronavirus deaths
I’m reality, Trump was only able to place one loyalist on the court in his first term.  That’s a big win for America. The next 8 years will likely see up to 4 judges replaced. Holding onto the presidency and congress during this cycle, IMO, overrides every other issue facing us.

Reminder:  The people who today tell you that a social justice protest/riot is worth the risk of Covid19 because the cause is noble are the same people who will blame Donald Trump for every single new case in the country.
Trump is doing these things because he KNOWS the #Kremlin has his back against voting security and  continues to be the republican party #propaganda machine. 2020. Where racism is accepted and civil rights are a thing of the past.
I'm 60, I've watched jobs leave my city. I watched my father lose his job after 40 yrs of being a machinist working at the shipyard. It was hard for him to have to get on welfare just to feed his family. Trump has given me hope for my grandkids. Jobs and opportunity.
WTF is wrong with you? Trump may not leave? He may try to use troops...are you FUCKING insane? Why would you even think such a thing? Seems you fkn Democrats haven't excepted losing for the past 4 years. Thing is my phone new what I was saying before I even typed it.STFU
I just ignored the warning and went to site and read some of it. Data was gathered from China and South Korea...they were both using HCQ as a treatment, successfully. As if we didn't already know this. Democrats just want to kill as many voters as possible and blame Trump
The same reason Trump doesn’t believe the science about wearing masks, no hydroxichloroquine, disinfectant, etc. but depends on those same scientists to come up with a vaccine.  Just evil to the core.
#JusticeForBernellTrammell Apparently this mans life didn't matter, for a couple reasons. First obviously, he was a Trump supporter...and second, he wasn't killed by a cop or a white person. #BLM?? not really.
I just don’t think so. I hate to say it but I think a black woman might shift the election to Trump. We don’t like to admit it but America is still a very racist nation. Deeply concerned that four more years of corruption and dictator-like government is possible.
Where’s Trump?  Playing golf? Groping?  Talking to Putin?
Yeah...my neighbor is a black Trump support, and on the other side is a military family, 3 houses down is another black family and an elderly couple next to them, a LE officer across the street, all Trump supporters....so I guess I'm where I should be.
Oh no, Trump is taking troops out of Germany! The same Germany that has a natural gas line straight to Russia and refuses to pay for NATO protection

Well that's totally false, but okay...I really don't put anything past the never Trump mentality...You people seem to make up your facts.
And those aren't the areas Trump is referring to, at least I don't think. If you want jobs to come to areas you have to stop giving crime a place to thrive...low income areas have high crime rates. This is a problem in a lot of small cities as well.

Misinformed hope ... Trump has financial stake in his cure bottom line
I rely on common sense. Trump seems to on that side more often than not.
tRump is making plenty of money from the office of the President - check out his golf tab -- he was on his way to wrecking our economy before covid19 - harmful tariffs &amp; bailouts -- trump doubled the deficit before Covid19.
Thank you for finally finding a cure for hiccups. Trump has already approved 'Right to Try' to cure my medical condition. 😎

Again with the moral ( in your head) high ground. If that’s true which I’ll take your word... how could you vote for abortion since today’s Democratic Party... Including Biden... is pro choice? The hatred for trump is more important then the future of this country... Nice.
Do you know why trump was impeached? You keep saying it but do you know why? As far thinking your a democrat... if you in todays climate vote democrat your giving up all your conservative views. Talk about doing research. Research the impeachment I’ll hang up and listen.

Yeah this is a meme and anyone can make a meme and put anything they want on it. But Trump donates his pay so it's okay if he golf's. At least he isn't ordering 65K in hotdogs and pizza that BTW isn't really hotdogs and pizza, at the expense of the American people.

I believe he is the first blatantly open racist to be President. Many of us knew that before he was elected. It is one of his greatest political strenths.  I reside in Alabama and every hardcore racist I know adores Trump. And I know a lot of them.

He’s a drug addled crazy person, but he’s just a puppet. He’s nothing to fear, it’s the evil that’s controlling him. If our numbers swell in the streets daily, trump republican allies will be telling him to get the Phuck out. Sounds crazy I no, but it’s that point in our history.
Apparently a lot of resisters are. So many are stressed and nervous about trump and the craziness he spews from his pie hole, while hoping someone comes to save them. It’s as if they refuse to believe they’re more powerful than than trump. Many of us are paralyzed with fear.
Nope. Still hopeful. Most of what trump is saying isn’t within his capability.
That tells who he’s beholden to. Not the knuckle draggers walking around with a trump 2020 t-shirt on.
ATLANTA (AP) — Herman Cain, former Republican presidential candidate and former CEO of a major pizza chain who went on to become an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, has died of complications from the coronavirus. He was 74.
Trump suggests delaying the election because of potential voter fraud.
We no longer care what trump asskissers have to say.
Don’t let trump take your vote.   We have to remember just how powerful we are. We control this whole process. This country can’t continue to be a country without us. Our vote, our money, and by the work we produce. They need us a hell of lot more than we need them.
No. I don’t think it will matter in the red states how many people die. They’re do just as Florida is doing. Wait for the surge to pass regardless of how many people die because there won’t be a blanket shutdown order from trump, like the last time.
DONALD TRUMP KILLED HERMAN CAIN!!!!!!!   Who thinks trump cares that he’s killing people? I don’t. He only cares about himself and Vladimir Putin. I never thought I would say this, but he cares more about Putin than he does about Ivanka.
You aren’t the only 1 unable to sleep &amp; not because of Trump. It’s due 2 citizens like yourself being a voice for the Democrats spreading hate, division, lies, &amp; destruction then blaming everyone but yourselves. Are U hopeless &amp; defeated yes if U remain death dumb &amp; blind 2 truth
So what? That doesn’t mean it’s over for us. Say all that happens, what then? Just give up and be trump’s slave? That’s how your tweet comes off. That its all over and there’s no chance of survival. I’m sorry, I’m not built that way. But I understand your fear, but trumps no God.
Yes. Nancy is doing the best she can. She also tells us in every interview she does, that the American people have the loudest voice. Ppl don’t seem to hear that part. They need our help a lot more than we need theirs right now as far as trump goes.
Tell us something we don’t know.   You’ll never be president if you don’t figure out a way to remove trump. Don’t think you can sit back and coast into the White House. If you’re decent, more is expected of you.
This is why we can’t give up. If we break now, we’ll be broken for ever. Evil wins. This ain’t about trump or paid militia. It about fighting for right over wrong. The people’s back is strong, let’s show them how strong we are!
I’m surprised it’s taken this long for trump’s puppet to start closing offices. Sorta like closing polling stations and DMV offices in predominantly POC neighborhoods so they can’t vote or get voter ID’s. Welcome to the South my friends. Just don’t let it stop you. Vote anyway!
Well, we are with that attitude. Even if trump wins another term, we have to make sure we control both wings of congress. If he wanna continue to break America,he’ll have to do it by executive order. Those can be reversed when he’s gone. We can’t give up bc it looks bleak. Right?
It’s the wealthy, white, male power structure. No way trump could pull all this off on his own. He has expensive backers.
The diehard trump supporter will never turn their back on him, but they are not who I’m worried about. We outnumber them, but the cheating by foreign nations and red state governors pose the biggest threat IMO.
It seems even businesses that once believed in the safety of us, are now deciding to side with profits over safety. Until trump is gone, I’m not sure we’ll have any back up. I see cops not wearing masks.
Fuck the military and fuck trump I’m about to get out this contract
As police in Milwaukee search for the person responsible for fatally shooting a Black Trump supporter outside of his business.
I think they’re just trying to get footage on file for trump’s campaign ads in a couple months.
I would be lying if I said I see it as I always did bc I don’t. I question it’s value now. Trump caused that. If trump is my example of America, I reject everything he stands for. If he loves it, I hate it. I don’t care if it’s petty. I’m pissed.
Yeah. Can’t argue that. Or they might be more vocal about it than other states, but the same sentiment exists. Trump came from one of the most racially diverse cities in America.
Did trump just tell a black reporter that he looks like mr. Bloomberg? My God. What a lunatic!
He keeps calling Kodak an American company but they were bought out years ago by an Asian country. I’m not sure he realizes this. Oh well. This is trump trying to appear more presidential to get his poll numbers up.
Does anyone believe trump knows Kodak is not an American company anymore. They were bought out many years ago buy a Chinese company (I think). They bought the Kodak name, but they didn’t manufacture anything. Now they’re supposed to save our country?
Trump’s Wall
Because he’s petty and holds grudges. John Lewis spoke out publically that he didn’t think trump was the rightful president of the United States and that he wouldn’t be attending his inauguration.
America and the world needs leadership and compassion right now. The youth that’s coming up now,care about each other. They need to see someone that genuinely cares about them and their fellow Americans. Is he their first choice,no but they’re sharp enough to know trump ain’t it.
I discovered hate in 2016. He’s right up there with trump and McConnell on my hate scale.   And his face is so punchable to me.
What would you suggest we do? Just roll over and show trump our nuts? Not me. If it comes to it, I’m gonna have to fight to protect my family. I’ll just have to be an armed moron fighting for the other side.
That’s fine. However he want to go, but he will go. I don’t care what the MAGAs say, they’re not gonna waste a civil war on donald trump. Especially if they’re too sick from from Covid. Their ventilator hose isn’t that long.
Man, if we official win, removing trump will be the lest of our worries. I hear all the nashing of teeth but he’ll be removed. Peacefully or dragged out by his little mushroom. Trump’s not that powerful. His favorability numbers are in the 30s.
No, but John did refuse to attend trump’s inauguration. To expect trump to rise above pettiness, would be too much to expect.
The HQ is in New Jersey. The plant is ran by a full fledged trump supported that wants to keep hq in the dark. 5 of us, all MAGAs except for me decided to write an email to the Director. Everybody was having trouble starting so I started. 1/2 a page, sent it to the other guys to
I don’t think, in today’s environment, people will necessarily believe it—so many people don’t trust science (Fauci) and evening more don’t trust any announcement Trump would make.
I gave up on trying to understand trump’s stragity.  It’s sometimes feels like he wants to sabotage his re-election chances.
I have never heard the police unions speak in public or make a statement to the press ever.  I saw that video a couple months ago of some union members whinnying about negative coverage and I remember the union leader speak at a trump rally. But the union reps don’t talk to press
Trump postponed first pitch because “strong focus” on coronavirus and economy.
This guy succeeded for more than he thought he would. He couldn’t have planned it any better if he were whispering in trump’s ear.
Is anyone else surprised at how easy and quick it’s been for trump to take over most of Washington and have paid militia occupying the streets of America? I am. I thought our system was stronger than this.
Some are. I personally know 3 trump supporters that were COVID19 deniers that’s lost family members close to them. 1 of them have become a never-trumper.   I have both good and bad emotions about this. It’s bad it took family deaths to open eyes, but it takes what it takes.
White anger. Trump cultivated it, stoked it, until he became their great, White hope. Now he’s holding Republican Congress ppl hostage because they need trumps supporters if they’ll ever win another election. Prime ex. Nikki Hayley.
I agree. The Conservative party is dead because the T-party/freedom caucus killed it. Trump just finished cremating it by exposing its treason, racism, hypocrisy. The party needs to be reincarnated into something that decent conservative ppl can get behind.
I think so. I think trump thought people would run back into their homes quaking in fear. He thought he would look like the law and order president, but instead he just looks like a bully tear gassing soccer moms.
Exactly! Because Portland has been more than the trump administration expected, he’ll want to “dominate” more for the tv cameras. Mix in 3 armed militia groups, and this could be disastrous.
There’s a group of people out there that’s willing to defend these actions or deny that the even happened. All of them will be voting for Donald trump in November.
Please don’t write anything in on the ballot. That’s just a vote for trump. It’s no different than ticking the box for trump. Just hold your nose and vote for democracy. Joe Biden.
From the beginning of slavery in America there were ablisholonist. People that saw it 4 what it was. It gets to the point of what’s in a person’s heart. There’s many resisters here that were raised a certain way but managed to think for themselves and denounce trump and racism.
Especially for someone that’s done so much evil.   The last poll I saw of Ohio, Biden only lead him by 1 point. I’m gonna go ahead and give trump a win there, figuring in tampering and voter suppression.
You must want a President who don’t even know his name or where he is!! Yeah, that should really work out great! Trump 2020🇺🇸
Sick burn. Trump will never recover
You’re not along. My family feels the same way as I do about trump, but there’s so many others here that are in your same situation. I can imagine how frustrating it must be for you guys, but you have a resister family now. Welcome 🤗
I read tweets asking questions like what should Biden do 1st when he’s elected? They think trump losing is a done deal, just like in 2016. I can just see the depression resister videos already. 😭😭😭  I’m scared guys. Nov. could be a great month or the worse of our century.
No way trump could do this on his own. No way. There’s some powerful republicans helping him and supporting him.  Did you guys see the article that some postal workers changed mail in ballots in 2016? If not, google the story.
Trump-backed postmaster general plans to slow mail delivery – Fortune  Wow! Are you guys sure we’re gonna win in November?
My dear, this is probably only the beginning. We all should stop watching polls. Trump should lose, but there’s a good chance he won’t also.
Stay the course Portland. It’s working.        You ppl are missing the revolution bc you want to see if trump can identify an elephant? Come on. Be better!!!!
What? No love for Katie? Have we become numb to this salaciousness? Nobody cares about 13 year old kids being raped by rich powerful men? Or are we too busy chasing trump’s laser pointer?  Oh well. Did anybody catch the baseball game last night?
If you believe the mueller report, which I do, you don’t have any doubt whatsoever. According to the report, manafort was THE major player in the Russian-trump collusion plot. Manafort should get the electric chair for treason.
Trump have a better pitch then Mini Fauci.
It time up for letting politicians off the hook. We’ve made excuses for them long enough. If I failed as much as they have in my job, I would’ve been fired a long time ago. So they won’t be getting sympathy from me after letting trump run over the the USA. I understand rep/senate
They think he was pressured into it according to my trump supporting Co-workers.
Trump is probably trying to provoke a civil war. That would keep him in office for a little while longer.   These protest have renewed my faith in our young people and the good people of America. We just have to keep hope alive for all of us to survive, or we all fail together.
If the Supreme Court decides it was a fair election, I wish him luck fighting his own government. I want to believe everybody in Washington except Barr, is ready to get rid of trump. He’s a threat to everyone.
No. We don’t want to withdraw. We want to keep peacefully protesting whats we know to be wrong. We really need more media attention in the places trump sends his goons. Unfortunately the media continues to focus on trump’s laser pointer.   Watch what he does, not what he says.
I’m with you on both counts and there’s nothing that suggest we can’t do both at the same time.   We don’t realize that the key to solving all our problems, including trump, lies in our hands but we’re to lazy or too scared to exert our will. WeThePeople have all the power.
Well, I expected some decadence or some creepy family secrets. For me, it wasn’t so different from anybody else’s family. It seems to be a way for her to recuperate some of the millions trump and 2 other siblings screwed her father out of their inheritance. I don’t blame her.
I’ve always been a night owl, so I use to fill that time with reading a good book, but now having a 1 hr commute to work, I listen to audio books. Speaking of audio books, Mary trump, you owe me $15. There were no revelations in that book, but I do hope it help recup cash from dt
I think it’s real important 2 things. What we’re seeing are scare tactics in hopes that the people retreat to our homes so it looks like a win for trump. They’re not trying to kill us. 2nd. There’s only a few hundred of them. If we keep protesting peacefully, they can’t win this.
Isn’t the insurance companies considering doing something similar. They believe trump’s actions and in some cases, inaction, have put an undue burden on them?
Once they start shooting unarmed Americans, videotaped for the world to see, is an entirely different animal than what they’re doing now. Now they’re just terrorizing people. But start shooting moms? Trump won’t make it to November.
It’s time they become more accountable. Dems wanted the house, we gave them the house. They impeached trump, but I still feel I didn’t get good return on vote. There’s so much they can do, but it doesn’t make me feel any better.
President Trump and others are to host a news conference about COVID-19. Some labs are taking weeks to return results, raising fears that asymptomatic people could be spreading the virus if they don’t isolate while they wait.
so if you can say all Trump voters are racist then I guess its cool for me to say all blacks love chicken.oh and lets not forget those delicious watermelon.oh and vote democrat.i mean it would be a double standard for you to say I was making a racist comment,right
HOUSTON (AP) — The Trump administration is detaining immigrant children as young as 1 in hotels, sometimes for weeks, before deporting them to their home countries under policies that have effectively shut down the nation’s asylum system during the …
NEW YORK (AP) — The global tally of people infected with the coronavirus neared 15 million Wednesday, while in the worst-hit pandemic hot spot of the United States, President Donald Trump warned the pandemic would “get worse before it gets better.”
Yes, they are. Not a one of them willing to consistently stand up to Trump about anything.
How is this even legal? How can nothing to be done about it? Are our Members of Congress going to stand by silently and let Trump take over this country? I’m not sure vote him out in Nov is going to work if this continues.
Makes you wonder if all these “reporters” are just stupid or it’s all a game to them and they want a closer horse race. Don’t they remember how normalizing Trump in 2016 got us to this place? Federal “police” in Portland, Trump ignoring the Constitution right and left.
How about wearing a mask while painting a #BlackLivesMatter mural outside Trump tower??
knows what #GhislaineMaxwell is accused of because was he was there for many of those *teeny bop* parties with her and Epstein. Trump couldn't care less about her... unless...she starts telling about what happened under those sheets years ago 🙄😑#wednesdaywisdom
How is  even talking about violence in Chicago? There has always been violence in Chicago. Why not go to the city and help bring jobs, money, educational advances, mentoring programs to the city. Oh, no, that's not what a Trump supporter should do #wednesdaymorning
How about Trump maintains air of indifference and lack of empathy until self-interest kicks in with dropping poll numbers and he reads in a monotone what his handlers wrote telling people to wear a mask and things will probably get worse before better. He should get no credit.
The Trump administration is facing growing pushback — in the courts and on the streets — to sending federal agents to Portland, Oregon.

Thanks again Nancy for stalling, not working with republicans and waiting until the last damn minute to negotiate. You and your pathetic party really care about the American people. I pray Biden loses big to Trump .
The President of the United States is supposed to be an exceptional human being. It is hard to imagine a greater contrast than the greatness of Barack Obama and the soulless, moronic inhumanity of Donald Trump.

Projected 2,000+Americans via Covid by Nov. 1 because of Trump's pitiful response. Has turned USA into police state. Putin puts bounties on our soldiers and does nothing. Trump puts kids in cages. Mocks a disabled reporter. Myself a disabled reporter for many years.
If you're not following uncle Robert Trump I highly recommend  it haha parody or not not sure just do it pls
Trump Starting a ‘Race War’ in Portland, Claims Congressional Black Caucus Luminary
When is this shit going 2 stop innocent people who has a Trump hat is shot for no reason other than picking a political side.
Black Trump Supporter Executed in Broad Daylight in Wisconsin
BS. President Trump is the Commander-in-Chief of the USA. The General offered a salute FIRST &amp; by protocol Mr. Trump returns the salute, then the hand shake. You’ve never been in the service have you?
That was then and this is NOW, Trump must be defeated in November, as He is destroying the fabric of our Democracy.😢
Trump you should be ashamed of yourself, and your National approval is a low 38%. You stoke Racial Division, and conspiracy theories against your opponents. You are a Demagogue, and must be defeated in November.
'What does Ghislaine Maxwell have on Trump?' asks new attack ad by Lincoln Project. About as much as Epstein did. And we know what happened to him.
Carnival hawkers for trump. This is what America has turned into.
So, a leftist sleezebag can break "parole" and be fine because he's anti-Trump... Irony is that with all the pressure this crybaby, and others, was put under to help them "get Trump" with 0 results, it shows how squeaky clean the President is.
CNN Special Report on Trump Conspiracies
That would mean Trump would double his 2016 Black vote.  Please your best ladies and gentlemen,  place your bets.
Yep. But like you said people only have issues with politics in sports when they don’t agree with them. In nascar, people didn’t like the black lives matter car bubba Wallace drove but didn’t complain about the trump sponsored car
So should the House launch another impeachment process if only as a means of further damaging Trump's no longer Teflon coating?
And this from a woman who spent millions in foreign countries to buy a vote. You worry about Trump leaving the White House. You lady can’t deal with the fact you lost and are totally irrelevant
I haven't talked to my family outside of my dad in a long time now and we aren't close. We don't discuss politics and he knows how I feel about Trump.  I have a very thin level of respect for him based on tangible actions he took against racism in his church. It's lonely.

My son Dan will start his junior year a Resurrection Catholic in Pascagoula, MS Aug. 6th. I'm apprehensive. There is a big surge of Covid-19 in Mississippi -- too many Trump fan boys. Daniel has many masks. I'll pray a lot.
Teachers but to be getting super excited about classes and probably gonna see schools starting first week in ausgust or thats me bahaha
This is fake news!! We are stronger for Trump than ever before!!
Right and these radical liberals (commies) are blaming Trump for job losses when they wanted the shutdowns, wtf did they expect would happen?
Trump what about the Bounty that Russia placed on our American Soldiers in Afghanistan. Yes it is true and you have done nothing to hold Your Russian buddy accountable for the bounty on their Heads. You will Not be re-elected and as A Vietnam Vet I totally resent your attitude.
What exactly has he done for those groups you listed besides screwing them over by helping Trump get elected? Also, he is so far removed from the struggles off regular folks he isn't helping anyone but himself.
Trump is now using the Covid-19 pandemic to expand his efforts to destroy public education in the US.
DOJ Inspector General Investigating Federal Agents' Actions In Portland And D.C. And you can bet Trump and Barr will suppress any findings until after the election.
Let the record reflect that it turned out he didn't actually violate terms of his house arrest and was thrown back in jail bc Trump found out he was planning to release a book before the November election.
Pepcid as a virus remedy? Trump admin's $21M gamble fizzled (from
Dear President Trump, we, at NLIHC( NATIONAL LOW INCOME HOUSING COALITION) &amp; AHA☺ (AMERICANS HELPING AMERICANS), ask that in this stimulus bill, this DIRE NEED, be considered. 23 MILLION RENTERS may become HOMELESS, if there is no FEDERAL INTERVENTION!  #RentReliefNow
Put the Bath Salts Down: MSNBC Reporter Zeroes in On Why Trump Is Really Sending the Feds into Liberal Cities
In trump America we believe in law and order. Not people rioting and burning building all for a socialist communist agenda
Tell us how this was preventable your the one that was mocking trump on the China ban. Oh thats right we have to turn away just like we have to look away and pretend you where not a anti segregationist
Again, wtf . I’ve been privileged to hear other opinions outside my country . I haven’t heard from one that doesn’t wish they too had a President Trump.    Mayor’s and Governor’s in Portland,LA, Seattle luv that DNC money.      Bet they have to take a lot of mistress shaming 💋
THANK YOU! THANK YOU!  PRESIDENT TRUMP, for YOU, handling our country with such great care!  Thank you for beginning, again, the Coronavirus daily briefings!     Thank you for enacting a law to protect are elderly in nursing homes. Thanks to Janice Dean, also!
Anyone able to follow what trump is saying?
Trump cannot even read his little speech. Ugh
Sure trump kin taking care us. Liar
Whoever thought we would see an American president wage war on his own people? Trump is shooting people in the streets and getting away with it, just like he said he would. A true American horror story.
To Melania. I guess that be best for you and Barron, but would that be best for the rest of our kids? I guess trump sucked the soul right out of you.
This is BS.  Never happened.  It is a Trump campaign urban legend.
Matt. It’s ok I call you Matt? Look believe it or not Mnuchkin has a conscience. He didn’t want to overdo the fleecing. If you think Trump is going to lose you have to weigh the risk of the next administration coming for you.
I believe nothing trump and his toadies say.
This is Trump's America. This and 140k dead bodies of Covid19 victims. #dumptrump
Did You Catch the Embarrassing Error in Chicago Mayor's Attack on Trump Regarding Federal Agents in Cities?
The king of fake news strikes again. Trump campaign image of cop being attacked is actually of 2014 Ukraine - Business Insider
I guess when a weak mind comes up with a meme, it has to stick to it to keep from showing how ignorant it is on all other topics - "racist racist racist". Why do actual racists always accuse others of being just like them?
Your an idiot! None of you Liberals ever have a positive agenda. All you do is name call and blame Trump. That’s your platform, BLAME TRUMP. So sad and childish.
Stop lying! Shame on you! Your hate for Trump will eat you alive. Do the right thing for the people. Don’t be a coward.
How about you do something to stop all the violent death being dealt out in your town before criticizing a President helping to re-institute some law and order? Hard to take the gangster out of dem politicians...
Funny - DeBlasio say's he'll sue if Trump upholds law and order and Cuomo (don't tell me what to do) wants Trump to order his people around - too cowardly to do what needs done and shoulder it yourselves - typical "progressives"
Seriously!  You do realize this TRUMP’S America....happening now!  Not in your imagination of Joe Biden’s America!!  WAKE UP!!!!
Donald Trump has proven one thing. White Men Lie
Bro, this literally is happening right now. Under Trump. Again, Biden opinions aside, you can’t use footage from Trumps regime and be like “oof can you imagine, THIS is what another president would do”
America to Trump: “Don’t let the door hit you in the ass on your way out”
America to Trump: “Don’t let the door hit you in the ass on your way out”
It has occurred to me that you  are as inadequate at speaking as trump is.👍
The difference is I can say what I think Obama did well but liberals can’t say one good thing about Trump.
So Obama bowed to Saudis and told Putin he would have more flexibility after election. When did Trump side w Putin? Agree he didn’t make huge issue after journalist murder ( don’t remember spelling of name ) For everything you can throw at Trump ...I think Obama was worse .
THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP,for CARING for OUR PRECIOUS, SENIOR AMERICANS!
Trump sends whistle call to madame to shut up!!
