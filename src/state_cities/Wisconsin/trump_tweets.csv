Just dumb Trump supporters
We stand with you President Trump!! Thank you for all you do!!
HERE'S THE LIAR AND CHIEF GASLIGHTING HIS BASE  AGAIN ; MAKING PROMISES HE CANNOT KEEP.  WHERE'S THAT COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE PLAN YOU PROMISED TO RELEASE IN 2 WEEKS???  JUST ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.
I hope you are correct. I suspect that they may go D after Trump in 2024, maybe more traditional D, less progressive (fingers crossed)
No social distancing, hardly any masks. President Trump is an absolute joke.
How exactly does “Trump strive to create chaos”?  *I have a feeling this answer is going to be hilarious.
Those that opposed Obama didn’t cause chaos.   Those that oppose Trump are creating chaos.   Thanks for making my point.
I lost 60 in the last hour
tRump pronouncing Thailand “Thigh Land” before correcting himself 🙄🙄🙄 Then saying both “Thigh Land” and Vietnam’s leaders take advantage of the US. There’s only one “leader”“taking advantage” of the United States and…
Then why is the GOP and Trump false tweeting a victory on jobs an hour ago. They live in an alternate universe.
I'm reading Back to the Jungle via the The New Yorker app. It’s a story about a true human rights crisis. I wonder if somehow we could get this pushed higher on the radar during these terrible times.
This whole 'scheme' sure seems odd. It's as if they WANT Trump - 4.More.Years. ;)
I am sure she is reviewing and approving the questions right now. 🙄 We all know how Chris feels about Trump so why would we watch??
I wasnt aware that Trump was British.  Now I want to see his long form birth certificate.
Trump and Pence are fighting to block patients from getting care at Planned Parenthood health centers. help turn the tide: #IStandWithPP
Or nobody just wants to hear the bullshit you put up about Trump every day
bends over for Trump and makes no statements
Pathetic Trump supporters only tactic is character assasination.
A nap will always trump golf. See what I did there? Did ya see it? 😆
Joe Biden will "hurt the Bible, hurt God," Trump says in Ohio of his practicing Catholic opponent. "He's against God."
By voting for tRump or any of his GOP enablers.
All of our faces will be frozen in Mr Swan’s expression if tRump wins re-election.  #RidinWithBiden #GetUpGrowUpShowUpVoteBlue #BlueWaveBlueTsunami
I saw a death notice yesterday that someone posted where the family blamed Trump for people not wearing masks, therefore, their loved one died.  It looked completely made up.  They are going to be rats from hell until November.
No it is unfair to use him like trump has. Sorry right now he is not mentally stable!  And I feel bad for him and his family.  We cannot afford to have him as a president because of mental illness
Trump’s Bank Was Subpoenaed by N.Y. Prosecutors in Criminal Inquiry
I would say it looks like Trump is a terrible idiot but, that’s common knowledge at this point
Literally a minute ago he also tried to convince me we have a say in the US vote😂...it’s already decided, not by the people..it’s decided by the greater powers..in this war, if the “good guys” are positioned to win, Trump will win “the vote” or something else with a win for good
I'm in New Berlin, WI and I have seen (2) signs for Biden and A LOT for Trump.    A have (2) friends that work for city (courthouse) they LOVE EVER's.  Courts are closed and they get full pay for doing NOTHING.
TRUMP
So it makes sense to me that we FOR SURE, need to win the Senate back and hold the House.  If Trump would happen to win by cheating, if we have control of  House and Senate we can impeach and remove.
Schools will not reopen even if trump wants them too. Our children's health is on the line. How many if our MPS children can afford a computer or pay for wifi?
Thank god I am Catholic and know more Catholics. Not voting for Trump!  #Biden2020
Stop saying mean things about my president. I’m voting for you Mr. Trump as are most of my friends. Thank you for signing this bill.
Maybe if he keeps it up it will come back around over the next 4 years
There’s no “letting”.   Trump makes all choices of what he wants to do and say.  Listens to nobody.
Trump tweet
Millions will cast their vote by mail and Trump wants to cut their funding. Really! They are already not funded enough.
Tell crust to get out of Trump ass
Jonathan Swan’s facial expressions during his tRump interview. We feel your pain Jon. #InaneInsaneInTheMembrane #ETTD
Still waiting on someone to explain it. Trump is going to get stomped in the election for this and yet nobody cares.
I have seen 3 but I have seen A LOT of Trump signs and American Flags!
As your city rots. U say this.    The Beautiful city you once had is gone. Due to your ignorance of leadership.   Sorry non leadership.  U r a loser. Always were always will be . And you get paid for it. Go figure. Trump 2020
We will have to pick someone in Nov..I’m going Trump for the best hope..I’m not convinced it’s all roses from here, but that direction at least gives us a shot.  No pun intended..
Maybe his misguided fans do, but IT'S CLEAR, TRUMP DOES NOT have best interest of the people or this  young democracy.
🤫   SO HERE'S THE PLAN:  FIRST WE ARE GOING TO VOTE TRUMP OUT.  THEN WE ARE GOING TO LOCK HIM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY.
DONALD TRUMP IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE, THE #1 THREAT TO AMERICA AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.  FK IN THE DIRECTION OF OFF.
Ya right trump will in against that dementia havin corrupt idiot biden
Do not trust 🇺🇸don’t forget the President is Trump 🤢all he cares about is $💵 God help us!
My boss is wild. Last night she told me that Donald Trump has six clones, and then went on about how easy cloning is, which led to a tangent on quantum physics. Meanwhile I was like 👁👄👁
do u think barron trump is gonna have daddy issues or like whats
How many times do we need to tell Trump that he shouldn’t call this the “China virus”? What a racist, pompous asshole.
DONALD TRUMP IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
The Covid-19 has been successfully controlled in China. But the TrumpVirus is spreading in US. He has killed 150,000 people. If TrumpVirus doesn’t go, the death toll in US will rise. Blaming China wouldn’t reduce the death toll in US, will only appear that Trump is incompetent.
AHH, NOW IT MAKES SENSE, TRUMP IN BED WITH MICROSOFT TO FORCE TIC TOK DEAL.
THE ONLY RISK WITH MAIL IN VOTING EXISTS BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S BUDDY WHO IS NOW SERVING AS POSTMASTER GENERAL, WHO NO DOUBT WILL BE IN CAHOOTS WITH TRUMP SLOW MAIL DELIVERY IN ATTEMPT TO HAVE BALLOTS ARRIVE LATE AND THEREFORE NOT BE COUNTED.  #GOPVOTERSUPRESSION
IT'S NEVER HARD TO SPOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER.
THERE IS NO CASE THAT HOLDS ANY WATER FOR RE-ELECTING TRUMP.
MOST OF AMERICA ROLLS THEIR EYES EVERYTIME TRUMP SPEAKS OR TWEETS, SO WHAT IS YOUR POINT?
My guess is that not a lot of people are going to show up and Trump doesn’t want to be embarrassed about the crowd size (a la Tulsa), so he doesn’t want the press to report that. Which ok, but then you aren’t going to get the free publicity that comes with a convention
Are you saying we shouldn’t be smart. What the fuck is your logic. Hey there doing it so it’s ok we do it. This is the Trump logic.
She’s not a Trump. She speaks in complete sentences
Sounds like destruction of FEDERAL PROPERTY.  Trump should send in his bogus Federal Police.  They should leave Portland and head on over.
South of tomahawk Joey.  Up nort, where the city dwellers go in the summertime and I have no idea why anyone lives there in the winters.  Science should trump politics.
This is just all so surreal.  I still cannot wrap my head around all we have had to endure under Trump and a GOP party who sold their soul to him and sold out the American people, our Democracy in the process.
tRump golfed and people died.  tRump golfed and people were evicted. tRump golfed and people lost their jobs. tRump golfed and kids couldn’t go to school. tRump golfed and our economy tanked. tRump golfed and Putin…
I've seen a lot of bumper stickers for the POTUS...they usually say "DUMP TRUMP "
He hasn't even picked a veep yet so the bumper sticker is irrelevant.  Christ, is your TV Faux News as stupid as Trump❓ (Rhetorical, of course.)  Let them be fired up, they are not the majority and their messiah and his cronies are gonna be just "fired".
Trump is trying to remove Tic Tok for only one reason. 20-30% of the short videos are better campaign ads for VP Biden then he can handle and J Biden isn’t spending a time. Keep them up and add a hell of a lot more, a lot more. The scumbag will be gone January 20th. Then to jail
The kids are at it again!🤣🤣  Trump campaign is giving away free stuff if you volunteer.  On kid is getting like 30 boxes.🤣🤣🤣  They are going to have burning parties.🤣🤣🤣🤣  Lesson:  Don't mess with Tic Tok or the kids who are gonna help us vote this orange ass out!
Trump really be out here throwing more fucking tantrums like the fucking two year old he is about an app that literally a generation and a half uses. Like ilyou don't have a brain but do you really think this ban is gonna help you, you racist homophone dumb ass piece of shit?🤡🤡
Black Trump Supporter Shot In Milwaukee: GOP Wants Investigation
Trump-Backed Operation Legend Sending Federal Agents To Milwaukee
Trump trying to ban tiktok is the ultimate boomer move. He thinks you can just move tiktok to the recycle bin! The internet doesn’t work like that! You can’t build a wall around the internet.
If you are on the ticket, I will be working Trump!!!
Keep trying, these are photo shopped and Trump is clean on this but you LIBS are going to cry............... 🤣🤣
Sorry, I am busy delivering TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT signs.
Trump is nuts
As a republican who will not vote for Trump, all I ask of a Biden VP is that it be someone who can step in when he is forced leave office early for health reasons.
Good for trump
Herman Cain. Dead at the age of 74 from the Coronavirus. This picture was taken at the Tulsa OK tRump rally he attended, without a mask, shortly before becoming sick. There really are no words. Pro-Life Religions…
The Left wants Americans sick with Covid.  It is obvious, which is why the rioters and protesters do not have any restrictions.   If numbers go up, they can blame Trump.  The Left is pathetic but eyes are opening to what is really going on.  Thank you for fighting for Americans.
I find it kinda funny that the democratic anti Trump ads are blaming him for chaos they caused themselves.
Nah TRUMP 2020!
Growing up... Yeah... I had a Plosma TV.  What's it to ya?  #Trump #Plosma #TrumpVirus
Wisconsin GOP Slams Donald Trump Over Election Delay Comments
I won't be able to handle it...  🤣🤣🤣🤣
He was too busy selling America to China, covering up Benghazi and fast and furious and spying on Trump.
Remember when this guy was held up as the decent alternative to Trump?  Good times.
Nancy is so out of touch that she does not realize that working Americans and Middle class ARE Republicans and the TRUMP SUPPORTERS!
Trump's Tulsa rally claims another.
Trump sounds like the illiterate kid trying to explain that “of course I read the book” while simultaneously saying “books are stupid, I’m not reading them” and “you never told me to read the book”. He’s so bad at covering for his ignorance and his evil.
It’s a toss up 🧐. Who’s the bigger asshole ? Jim Jordan or President Trump ? Jordan licks Trumps boots all day. It’s not surprising, their both sexually sick in the head. Jordan likes them young too .( boys ) what a prick. Mr. tough guy, wear a mask and jacket.Trump Virus is more appropriate
They’re looking for public support to push their version of save America bill through. Trouble is it’s full of Schumer and Pelosi pork. They think by agreeing to some things that not only can they buy support, but if things turn bad they were just doing what President Trump wants
For sure. They’ve all cut their own heads off, just running like a chicken until they bleed out. The only way to get honest news now is from the source. Thanks to President Trump for his willingness to take the time to share each and every day. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
One: I'm not a liberal.  Two: Trump cannot form complete sentences and mispronounced basic words on a near-daily basis. #DementiaDonald is definitely not in control of his mental faculties.
Among other assertions, William Evanina’s new statement denounced foreign influencers’ efforts as “a direct threat to the fabric of our democracy.”
William Barr, Trump's own attorney general, investigated that and found no evidence that Trump's claims were true.
all tik tok has done to me is make me wish I had a dad, a close friend group, a bird, a baby horse, a new puppy and a 'smart funny and can dance' personality and I think those are the exact same reasons behind why trump wants to ban it
No, and we won’t be under Trump and this Administration. The GOP is killing middle/lower class. Millionaires and billionaires are making life/death decisions for us &amp; have no idea what they are doing.
3)  That's harder to understand, I don't always understand it myself.  There is a woman who is a long standing friend of my family, who is smart and successful,  whom I have always admired.  She has always been Republican and watched Fox News for years even before Donald Trump
1) Part of why so many Americans believe Trump's lies has to do with how popular Fox News, Breitbart News, and even OAN, are here. People get inundated with lies and fear mongering and they've lived with it for so long that they believe  it.  They have also become convinced that
True, Trump may be realizing that the Democrats have the upper hand here, and they think they can use EOs to move the talks back in their direction.
Why wouldn't Trump just go along with the $2 trillion? It's totally in his interest to juice the economy right before the election. You wonder if Mark Meadows is taking a hard line in these talks.
Well of course he is going to deny it...
President Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat. But what is WeChat, and why is it so controversial?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I didn’t know Black Lives Matter and antifa were Trump supporters that’s funny because They seem to always destroy anything that has to do with Trump. One or two rogue white supremacists do not equal tens of thousands  that support the BLM Antifa terrorist
Lol I live in rural WI and come from a family of Trump voters, my life is definitely not an echo chamber, but thanks for your concern. Have a swell day!
The orders take effect in 45 days and could bar the popular apps from the Apple and Google app stores, effectively removing them from U.S. distribution.
Any republican president would have been able to do that with the economy.  It is not trump at all.  Bush had such a wonderful economy going before the bubble burst.
I declare the winner of the 2020 presidential election to be DONALD J TRUMP.There I got that covered.Could you imagine Pelosi or Biden or any democrat alive today being president??  It would mean total annihilation of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. But Pelosi’s soul sold to Satan
The La Crosse Democrat also said the action breaches United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that went into effect July 1. Reached in May 2019, the USMCA dropped tariffs on steel and aluminum.
i disagree. republicans enabled Trump.
I think he found a bunker left over from the Cold War.He probably end up with a bar built on top of it.Only he probably alone, we’ll maybe Hunter. Where is Hunter? How bout TARA READE? And why are his ads copying what’s already being done by President Trump? PLAGIARISM OF ACTIONS
President Trump’s announcement today to raise tariffs on Canadian aluminum is extremely disappointing. This is not how we treat allies that we have recently agreed to a new trade deal with.
Trump is going to say wild and stupid things to distract voters. Ignore him.  via
Lets nit forget Trump openly admitted to accosting, grabbing, and trying to sleep with married women. Then brushed it off as locker room talk. Dude is morally corrupt and his supports refuse to acknowledge it.
So Trump comes across sounding odd, but hey, that's why Pence is on the ticket.
This follows  terrific observation: Trump's appeals to the religious right seem to reflect a New Yorker's idea of what the religious right wants to hear.
Oh repubs, trump told us Mexico would pay for the wall, then if you want a test you can get a test, this virus is a hoax...wait there's more!
DeWine took the test as part of standard protocol before meeting President Trump at an airport in Cleveland.
The Senate Rs are sidelined, Trump is floating executive orders that he cannot do. If the House Democrats think they have the upper hand in the stimulus talks, they are correct. Pelosi doesn't need a deal as badly as Trump and vulnerable GOP senators do.
Watching Pelosi on CNBC and she’s acting tough so looks like trump will look like a hero. Idiots
Democrats need to give a little on this bill or else it’s a life line thrown to Trump who will look like a hero. Not sure if this is even legal but hasn’t stopped him before.
Facebook, citing virus misinformation, deletes Trump post
absolutely dying at the idea that there’s a difference between Cruz and Trump
Totally agree. Getting conservative justices will be the repubs excuse for voting for repulsive trump. That and repealing Roe v Wade.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
Under what rock did trump find this guy? How much bs must the public endure till Jan.?
GOP, Trump campaign attorney working to get Kanye West on WI ballot
Yes they do work for us. But sure as hell won’t work with us. Way way past time for a change. We’ve got the only man that could do this job. President Donald J Trump and now he needs backup,  which he doesn’t get much of looks like. C’mon Republicans
It would appear that we now reside in a socialist communist country doesn’t it?  What is it going to be like between now and Election Day? Or after President Trump is still President Trump? Out of control power hungry idiots should of never had the opportunity to be in charge.
Watch the full "Axios on HBO" interview with President Trump - Axios
Team Trump still has plenty of money, but it seems like they've burned through a lot of cash already.
It's very Trump-like to for making fun of Biden for... following social distancing guidelines.
Given they finally stood up to Trump it’d be hilarious if they were in on this together
fun part is Trump and Barr can’t do shit about this
Low grade depression due to Trump admin ? Really ? She should be focusing on the two children that miraculously appeared sometime in their lives. Wanna see baby pics.
Is Hunter running for president?  Nope, so who cares.  Why aren't you upset of the millions of dollars the Trump kids are bringing in?
Probably as soon as your daddy stops sticking his foot in his mouth.  The incoherent turds that fly out of the Trump family's mouths is baffling.
Look at a list of Trump’s endorsements.  He was endorsed by the chairmen of the US Nazi party.  It was not reported because they are irrelevant, just like this one
Not no fuckin governor or mayors choice that’s fer damn sure. They are such power hungry assholes they’ll do anything to try to prove not but guess what PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG. GOD I LOVE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS!! BUT WAIT. HE’S BEEN RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
When has the legality of anything ever stopped Trump?
Trump signs $3B-a-year plan to boost conservation, parks
Trump may not have authority, but I worry about what his repub thugs are doing behind the scenes illegally to win.
I hate trump, felix is a good person.
My thoughts have been that they are vaccinated already. They have not tested positive nor anyone around them. Unlike President Trump’s people. Something smells and it ain’t the fish.
I do not think Trump can get 50% of the vote in Wisconsin. But with third-party candidates in the mix, he doesn't necessarily need to...
You mean like Trump doesn't have a problem?  I absolutely do not believe that he actually passed that cognitive test he likes to brag about.  And this bill doesn't force people with dementia to vote.  It allows access for people who Already Have the legal right to vote.
The only reason President Trump doesn't want mail in ballots, except in Florida, is to suppress the vote.  So he lies like he always does, and his followers just buy into it like they always do.
Census must be completed in 2021 if trump stops it.
159,000 Americans dead from covid 19, there is no national strategy, and President Trump says "It is what it is."
Asked during a White House news conference what makes the Sunshine State competent with absentee voting all of a sudden, Trump cited the fact that Florida’s string of Republican governors has established a good track record on mail-in ballots.
See how politicians and advocacy groups reacted in posts and videos as President Donald Trump signed legislation to spend nearly $3 billion a year on conservation, outdoor recreation, national parks and other public lands.
Americans waiting a week for results.   trump failed America. #TrumpVirus2020 #TrumpVirusDeathToll156K  trump demise televised daily
The law will devote nearly $3 billion annually to conservation projects, outdoor recreation, and maintenance of national parks and other public lands.
All this crap happening now sounds and smells like desperation by Trump &amp; this Administration! Start packing...will be gone on January 20th!!
Doesn’t she ever get tired of her head being so far up Trump’s ass ?
I love  Some of my favorite reactions to Trump during this gem of an interview:
Seriously. Whether he pushed Trump in that interview or not it was likely his last one with him. He knew that too.
Trump might as well have worn the fucking hot dog costume from I Think You Should Leave going "we should find the guy who did this"
It's unbelievable how dumb Trump is.
Literally every minute or two Trump refers to himself or his accomplishments lmfaoo
How many people did you help kill? Grandma’s and Grandpa’s murdered by you and your pal de blasio. And that’s what it was. Murder. You are not one to criticize anyone let alone President Trump
There is no such thing as “systematic” racism. Love our great President. And honestly, there was very little racism at all until Obama got “put” in the White House. And as I’m seeing what the democrats are trying to do to President Trump, I believe Obama was not elected at all.
Trump wants a broader role for telehealth services in Medicare
Terrific job by Swan. Will perhaps be the definitive interview of the Trump presidency. Watch the whole thing.
Trump is a misogynist.  He has rape and sexual misconduct cases against him.  He doesn't care about the kids he is insisting go back to school.  He doesn't care about the American people.     I am a #WomanAgainstTrump
So Apple is expected to pay off Trump for him not stopping the purchase of TikTok? Sounds like extortion.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is taking steps to give telehealth a broader role under Medicare, with an executive order that serves as a call for Congress to make doctor visits via personal technology a permanent fixture of the…
What happened to the Trump-sign “kicker?” Ona. Police Chief tonight on La Crosse Talk PM
Wow, Ron.  You actually said something i can agree with. The tRUMP administration was so full of corruption even back then.  I can't wait to hear and see what you have put together.  Thanks!   Oh.  Have any more trips to see Mother Russia soon? You POS.
FACT- Donald Trump is YOUR President!
Hashtag bump #WomenAgainstTrump to stump chump grump Trump for slumped lump.
President Donald Trump is making big claims about cutting drug prices and about a COVID-19 treatment. Here's a look at that and more from the past week.
Oh you meant to say the “Trump Virus”!!
With 92 days until Election Day, here's what we're watching heading into a new week in the 2020 campaign:
If Joe is so sharp, he should debate Trump today, does anybody think he’ll be any better cognitively in two months???
went above &amp; beyond with this one 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You already have mud on your hands from 2016 cheating!
I have my whole family supporting Trump. And almost everyone I know. Democrats are cancer trying to destroy this country and must be stopped
I hope he is charged! He is 🤮! Just like Trump, they think they are every woman’s dream. 🤣😂🤮🤮
I wish I knew someone that could make a Trump flag with embroidered stars and sewn letters that spell out TRUMP on both sides the rest could be screen printed I need the same heft and weight of the American Flag the crap I find online are so thin they get tangled around the pole
So all the people on the tweet above are in on a conspiracy to hide the effectiveness of the drug because Trump likes it. That is asinine and if you have any intelligence you know it.  They have done the work.  There have been multiple blind studies that show it does not work!
So, according to you the White House Testing Czar, the Director for the Institute of Infectious Diseases, multiple countries that have tested the drug and found it did not work, multiple labs in the US that found it dod not work all all in a conspiracy to make Trump look bad?
So true! And good enough for all prior elections.But not if Donald J Trump is going to get re-elected I guess.I seem to remember that almost 4 years ago a large number of ballots were mysteriously misplaced but magically appeared when “they” found out murdering killary was losing
Trump needs the race to be shaken up in a big way. And the list of things that could shake up the race is getting shorter.
I figured Trump’s re-election would cause the GOP to take this seriously.
Trump lies on a daily basis. His list of lies is long and easy to find. And, if you're going to accuse someone of plagiarism, at least learn how to spell plagiarize.
Trump shoots himself in the foot every day.  He doesn't need anybody's help.
The headquarters will remain open through the election.
Because there was an election.  But Trump is trying to delay or cancel the election.  Except he wouldn't just stay in office because Article 20 of the constitution says that his term ends on Jan. 20th at noon, no matter what.  The line of succession says who would be next.
If Trump did somehow manage to cancel the presidential election,  which is unlikely, why does that mean the states would have to cancel theirs?  The states could still hold their elections, leaving the Senate and the House of Representatives intact.
Yeah pretty much every single member of Trump's, ah, let's call it a lazy Susan, instead of a cabinet, since it's always rotating through "the best people." I digress, but yeah, can't think of a one that doesn't have a glaring conflict of interest... 🤔
Obviously they’re worried that Trump’s deranged ramblings of an acceptance speech wouldn’t provide him a bounce but likely the opposite!
Mike Pence was watching way too many Tiktok thots, so Trump banned it!!!
Aside from the obvious - that they were expecting a larger crowd than what came - this is also frustrating because they had plenty of room to social distance and didn't.   It's like Trump wants to kill his supporters.
This was a photo op for the Trump campaign to use. Sad. No way would I meet with this man. We all know how he views people of color.
Fuck Donald Trump
when he trump gonna realize you can't fuck w our generation? if he bans tik tok it'll be a week before there is a new app doing the same thing. don't play w us 🙄
Trump says he’ll act to ban TikTok in US as soon as Saturday
First it’s your Trump Troops and now threatening to shutdown a social media platform TikTok.  Sounds like we are in Russia! Is this what your boss Putin wanted?
The social media app has more than 800 million followers worldwide.
How dare he say these words now! Over 150,000 citizens are dead!! Trump and this Administration is responsible for these lives and all those who will die!  The Trump Virus! You all failed the United States of America 🇺🇸
Money doesn’t matter to the left, as long as Trump doesn’t have a rally, let’s go $20 billion in the hole!
How many presidents have given the best chocolate cake to China?    chump trump kissed Chinese arse, Russian arse, n fat N. Korean arse. Americans are disgusted and embarrased beyond measure!  USA votin
5 of 5 stars to Too Much and Never Enough by Mary L. Trump
How about telling your boss trump to stop his large gatherings because that's how Herman Cain died.
President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he was taking aim at low-income housing programs like he was doing us a favor.
Definitely not. trump is shaking with fear because as soon as he is out of office the lawsuits are coming n no more presidential resources/co-conspirators.
Crowds? 🤣😂. How much extra do you make for tweeting this nonsense. No masks and no social distancing! Take a big breathe Trump!!
Only for his Trump squad! This man has no honor!
Again, Trump breathe deeply in FL!
Don’t you put this on Dems! They had a bill, GOP will not bring it up. It doesn’t have billions added in for military spending that the GOP has on their bill. Plus Trump was stating that it would be more than $1200!
She lies so easily. The Dems were not going to sign off on a GOP bill that has literally billions for military spending! Do not lay this at the feet of Dems. This is all on Trump &amp; this Administration!!
Get facts! The flights that were cancelled from China and Europe were for nationals. U. S. citizens were allowed in and brought the virus. Once here Trump &amp; this Administration downed played it....
The Trump Virus lands squarely on you! The House has a Bill that has already passed. Senate needs to vote it in and you sign it. Do u know how to sign something other than an Executive Order?
Already reports of the Trump appointed Postmaster General crony is slowing down mail delivery. It is just going to get worse in the next few months
Is what plausible? Trump not leaving willingly? Yeah it's entirely possible. What he doesn't understand is that you don't get to choose to accept or not accept the vote. It's not up to him.
WATCH LIVE: Fauci and other federal officials testify on Trump administration's coronavirus response.
Just gonna blame President Trump for everything I’m gonna guess.
Former Vice President Joe Biden now says he supports travel bans to contain the Chinese coronavirus after all – after he previously called the China travel ban issued by President Donald Trump in late January “xenophobia.”  THIS MAN WILL SAY ANYTHING AND LIES ABOUT EVERYTHING
The intelligence of our President and his uncanny ability to fire up the left and their media hounds is amazing. One little sentence, at just the right time, and they start howling like wolves. I truly do love President Trump. His use of sarcasm drives these idiots nuts.
Ok honestly I cant tell if Trump is trying to delay the election for his own gain or if he has also figured out that everyone voting absentee will cause a shit ton of voter fraud.
so next Trump plans to steal someone's eulogy with a photo op - remember you have 2 channels!
I just realized something. Trump's "new tone" didn't even last a half of a
this pretty much guarantees a Trump victory because Mike only wants winners
Wisconsin Republicans break with Trump on election delay
I will sit here and admit I was one of the people BEGGING for the Wisconsin Primary to be postponed, but now that I've seen how things have been going, I'll show up to vote in November in a hazmat suit if needed. Trump needs removed.  (Yes, I'm doing mail-in voting, just saying.)

"I don't kid."  Donald Trump - 23 July 2020

This here is why even if Trump died the GOP won’t take coronavirus seriously. It’ll then just become a conspiracy to take dear leader out.
He survived cancer.  He couldn't survive Trump.
We do have a bunch of Trump photos of him groping his daughter and looking at her like she is what's for dinner.
I hate doing this on social media, but alarm bells need to be ringing at a 5 alarm rate. You can see this coming from a mile away..this man must be stopped before we lose what it means to even be #American #AmericaWakeUp #Election2020
You know what's funny?  Biden said he'd try this back in April. CALLED IT.
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.

Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare
Trump administration negotiators are heading back to the Capitol for last-ditch talks on vital COVID-19 rescue money.​
Trump will win.
it's entertaining when he rips the Dem establishment, but my biggest complaint is that he keeps pretending there's no pandemic as he's urging people to not vote for Biden, 4 more years of Trump WILL get 100,000s killed who otherwise would live, election is literally life or death
Look if it Trump gets rid of Obamacare, but replaces with an identical health care bill, I'm fine.  It'll stop his attacks on people's health care, and we'll all know who really did the work...
It will get worse before it gets better. I agree with you there. I too am a Jesus loving Christian. I work on building my relationship with God daily. But I believe that God is working thru Q and President Trump.  There is evidence for this everywhere if one only looks for it.
How he got to summerfest grounds for a Trump rally, I think? They had closed the roads. Basically were showing that a black person went. 😭
Oh because of how it reported my giving, on open secrets it looks like I gave more to trump than to Bernie. You have to go to the FEC website for the full accounting
...or everyone that tried to cancel Goya because the CEO supported the president. But sure, Trump started it.
or maybe they ran my name through the political candidate donor database and saw that I gave money to trump after Liz Warren called evangelicals who want to get married degenerates and unlovable incels  I gave a bit more to Bernie but it is what it is

Everyone is happy that Trump is ending payroll taxes for the rest of the year right.... Well um, Jo Jorgensen wants to end taxes for good! #TaxationIsTheft #Jorgensen2020

Why the fuck are you guys acting like Trump is the one to do this. This was done 10 years ago.
We stand with you President Trump!! Thank you for all you do!!
I'm sure the European Union, Canada, Mexico, and most countries of the world are hoping Trump does not win re-election. It's dangerous to have a crackpot in charge of a major power.  Of course Russia supports Trump because he is doing a good job of destroying the United States.
Thank you. As with all things Trump, report the action, not the talk.
How Stephen Miller went from teen troll to Trump whisperer #HateMonger
This is why the Republicans lost the house in 2016. Because they were trying to dismantle ACA and  the pre-existing conditions. Trump is throwing what ever on the wall to see what stick. He is the worst president ever. #Biden2020
Trump claiming that he will protect pre-existing condition in health insurance, and this is the first time it will happen. Wrong he is has been trying for 3 year to dismantle ACA pre- existing conditions provision. He think this will help him.

I have zero sympathy for people who voted in 2016 for Trump like I just saw on tv and now live with a huge regret.  We would not be in this situation had Hillary been elected.  They all had enough information to know that he was not the correct choice.
Oh I’ve not doubt that MEMEMIG with the pinned Trump 2020 tweet and American flag porn-laden profile is a real independent thinker who’s totally amenable to new information and fact-checking.
#JoeBiden is an absolute #racist. Has a history of racist statements, policies, &amp; the media &amp; Dems hate Trump so much, they let him get away with saying anything. It's truly disgusting. Todays Dems have adopted a radical, psychotic, overtly racist &amp; white supremacist ideology.
What Trump is maliciously doing to essential government services long thought sacrosanct is the one and only argument against single payer healthcare I will even entertain.
Sleepy Joe is quite the compliment. I think we all need 😴 after 4 years of trump.

Putin is Trump’s boss. Trump’s in our WH and this cannot be allowed. How can we trust Trump not to put Putin and Russia before this country? Trump has yet to protect our Troops from Putin’s bounties. It’s time for Trump to go!
Trump must be trying to fool the voters or did he drop the Lawsuit to get rid ACA that already covers pre existing conditions? It’s really hard to believe anything Trump says.
Does no one in the GOP understand that Trump isn't the only one on the ballot?  The govt will be reduced to 65 Senators - that's it - if there is no election.
I see now that Thanks Obama is already trending and I'm late to the party. Kinda like Trump's executive order.

Isn’t DT a pedo as well? And he definitely also has dementia. He also sexually assaulted a number of women and has ties to Epstein sooooooo? Any interview with Biden is better than the interview Trump just gave. It’s embarrassing.
this could've been written today... the trump reference would still work, just a little differently
How will the Coronavirus ever calm down when Trump won’t be honest with his supporters? He just won’t say that he got it wrong that the Covid-19 is very serious and contagious. He does his supporters a disservice and every person in this country. Trump refuses to be honest.
In 2006 Congress passed a law to require prefunding of 75 yrs for USPS pensions. They've been hurting since. Obama had both houses of congress, so did Trump. BOTH parties could have corrected this but didn't. THEY'RE BOTH RESPONSIBLE &amp; NEED TO FIX IT ASAP!
I’d def be more optimistic about that possibility if Biden weren’t so massively ahead in the polls. That’s why it’d arguably be kinda preferable if Trump weren’t imploding so horribly, b/c Biden might actually feel pressured to concede on at least one damn progressive policy lol.
I think this is a call to get the virus under control... Kids do need to be in school — but it can’t happen because of the incompetence of the Trump admin.... I think that is his point.
So, what you’re saying is: the Republican controlled Senate had 4 years to protect people with pre-existing conditions but did nothing to make it happen. Since Trump’s action isn’t law (and won’t actually change a thing) it’s important to vote for Democrats.  Will do! 👍
USPS problems started in '06 when congress passed a law requiring 75 year PRE-funding of USPS pensions. Obama had both houses of Congress from '09-'11, Trump from both from '16-'18. BOTH parties could have stopped this stupidity but didn't so BOTH are responsible for the problems

True... most presidents spend more than one hour a day working. Remember, Taft once got stuck in a bathtub and he probably still got more work done that day than trump has in a month.
Only online claim I saw was posted by   - but he failed to divide any evidence.  Standard Trump behavior.
Yeah, why I didn't get the vapors when Republicans chanted "lock her up" in 2016. BTW, when is Trump going to "lock her up"?

Nero had his violin, Trump has his tweets and both ignored facts.
As for insulin, that and many other drugs will be much cheaper after the EO Trump signed.  Drug prices have nothing to do with insurance, and all to do with big pharma, which owns both parties
That's not a reasonable comparison. Biden has been in national politics for over 40 years &amp; Trump has 4 years.  BTW no one is really doing backflips about the choices. It really is the choice of the lesser of 2 evils.  I know the right isn't always interested in facts or numbers.

I'm really worried about second wave come November #COVID19    Since Trump treated this like fiction, it's really gotten bad.    If he has supported masks earlier, we'd be in much better shape, but he treated like fiction
Trump is a danger to America and the world. He’s like a spoiled child who doesn’t understand the word no and his parents, the GOP, refuse to discipline him.
People who blame the deficit solely on Trump should be ignored...
After spending 3 days in another area of the state, its become obvious that the only folks up in arms about masks are the alt-right and Trump following    We know masks work. Stick to it, ignore the whiny right and we'll stay healthy.

the Trump lip sync lady is definitely voting for him in November right? She'll be out of a job otherwise
which TikTok do you think made Trump want to shut down the app I think it's this one
So what is the trump thing? Impeachment? Lying? Laziness? Promises you don't keep? Low polling numbers? Killing more than 150k Americans with your negligence? Racism? Fascism? I'd say that pretty much sums up what we all see.

But yeah, Republicans want to fight over masks...   Any Trump  incumbent needs to be voted out. Every. Single. One.  Democrats will lead us out of this pandemic and begin to repair the economy the GOP has neglected.

All I force is more of the same unless we win back the House.  If we do that I think we can elect another Republican President after Donald J Trump and wipe out this radical left agenda for awhile anyway. They will not stop fighting and hopefully we are just getting started.
What the fuck does That have to do with kids being beaten in camps funded by the NBA for years?  How craven and depraved do you have to be to ignore that because you think somehow speaking against it is somehow an endorsement of Trump?  God have mercy on your soul.  I sure won’t.

I feel like the best question to pose Trump people who claim they arent racist is: what has he accomplished that he said he would in his 2016 campaign for the presidency? His main chants were "lock her up" &amp; "build the wall" hes built 3 new miles of the wall and HRC isnt jailed

Right! Trump has never been seen inside a church! He golfs on Sundays! What congregation does he belong to? What is the name  of his minister? Do we ever see Trump, Melania &amp; Barron attending church services together? No. Trump’s actions are anti-God.

It's fascinating... I don't go to the "left" or the "right". But if I disagree with something Trump says or what the "right" is trying to push, I'm automatically a "Libtard". Both parties are just as corrupt and dishonest... But that's just me, the "Libtard". #FuckPolitics
Anyone who heard Trump today and not realize he is totally delusional is insane

Not with a medical excuse they can’t.    I think any pediatrician or therapist would be concerned for a parent or child concerned with those conditions during CovID-19.  Note:  I’m pretty sure Trump was banking on the schools vs the ppl after he threatened their funding.

Glad to see you standing with the greatest president ever. Trump 2020 !
Where do you get off accusing the Democrats with not wanting to protect elections? They have been TRYING but your buddy, Moscow Mitch, won't let them.  And, for the record, trying to encourage mail-in voting is NOT trying to "rig an election", despite what Trump wrongly believes.
This is just so perfect at showing how Trump wants to lower the number of tests performed but also only wants to measure success vs Covid using deaths per case (which would look better the more we test). [80 sec video]

Are you familiar with Donald Trump?
Isn't it odd that Trump sounds like an illiterate, unhinged, lunatic through spoken word and all forms of media, yet you don't care?
So, #trump screams about voter fraud. They say no credible evidence. Maybe the proof is in that clown being elected. Are there truly that many stupid people in USA?
Now #trump wants to have his campaign rallies etc out of White House. Legal? Ethical? Not that he hasn't campaigned for reelection even before sworn into office.

Its good that trump got rid of bolten. He would have pushed us right into they horrors of war. I hate neocons. Bush and his gang were warmongers and no one should be okay with going back to bush style attacks with made up intelligence and torture.
Lol they say this about middle aged trump supporters looking into open source dirt on politicians, but ignore the laeft wing extremists violently pushing communism by way of arson, street violence, and even ieds. Terrorist cells operate but qanon is a worry. Seems q hit a nerve.
Not really. They acted while the left and the who said he was just being a racist when he stopped travel from china. In reality china lied about the virus and every lie or convenient coincidence seemed to maximize the viruses impact.Trump did great by ignoring the who.
Just because you say trump killed people with covid doesnt make the reality that its a virus killing people not trump not true. You really sound brainwashed. He did more than has been done for any pandemic i have heard of in america. 160k is much less than 1m + predicted.
Its a biological weapon. It takes 2 weeks to find out you have it and is spread much of that time. Trump didnt make it and he in fact caught a lot of crap for trying to take measures to lessen it. Meanwhile goveners that made decrees that literally murdered seniors are praised.
Cringed thru entire interview. Maybe next text for Trump might be kindergarten readiness test?

Irs sad that the left has to use its propaganda arm to push fake polls so when they cheat in november they can claim they were ahead the whole time. Trump supporters must insist on at least voting in person themselves. There needs to be safe gaurds against fraud by the democrats.

I would pay a lot of money, instead of a debate, to watch a Bible trivia match between Biden and Trump.
Thank you for your concern😉 but your facts about Trump performance  are only relevant  and accurate after covid19  onset. And the country was shut down. Prior all was up and never before seen success.  The dems had  8 years and blamed republicans at every opertunity.
No question needed. Psychopath narcissistic  exposed himself at the Feb Prayer Breakfast not knowing that Jesus said “love your enemy” bc Trump said he is against that. Enough said!
That's great.  Ignore the Trump supporters.  Most of us here in the US want Biden to win out of the two choices.  The Trump supporters are more vocal unfortunately.
Psychopath  says  is against God, against guns! I would think God is against guns. God also believes in loving your enemy. Something Trump said he’s against at the Feb Prayer Breakfast. #Psycho

However, CFR is still (at best, IF it were a reliable measure) measuring efficacy of treatment, not the spread of the disease.  As executor of public policy, Trump has far more impact in the latter than the former so the metric we use to grade him should be selected accordingly.

Yeah that's not going to happen.  The third party candidate never wins and a vote for anyone other than Biden, is a vote for Trump.
Nope Trump really is that stupid.  Except for watching Colbert and sometimes Kimmel, I've managed to avoid watching that idiot in the news.  Everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie.
At least Operation Condor worked. Trump is just clownish.
And I get it.  Hillary was a flawed candidate.  I never really enjoyed the Clintons.  Her campaign was seemingly mismanaged.  And there was a lot of frustration among voters.  Trump promised something different.  A new, unknown type of leader.  I get why people voted for him.
Yet, he is our president and somehow it is possible he might get re-elected.  In the last cycle my feed is filled with Hamilton gifs proclaiming Trump is never going to be President now.  Yet, despite weekly disqualifying revelations, he was elected.
There’s a lot of Democratic rejoicing following the  interview with Trump.  Yet, it leaves me thoroughly depressed.  On one hand, it seems to be just the latest and increasingly obvious evidence that  is completely unfit to lead our nation.

Once again it’s all about psychopath  Then plays the ignorance that he didn’t know John Lewis. A president that does NOT know a key member of Congress across the aisle is bias. Trump is a divider NOT a United.
Back in 2016 MSNBC covered nearly all of Trump rallies. Like most networks they bought into the Hillary e-mail &amp; didn’t discredit it to tell the truth. They didn’t bash all the LIES  of Trump rallies. Now they cover his 💩 briefings. All for ratings.
Trump is asked how history will remember John Lewis, a vital figure in our Civil Rights history.  And it takes him a follow up question to have an answer beyond whether Lewis was at his inauguration.  I’ll make no apologies saying it: Donald Trump is a pathetic, pathetic person.
You are leaving for the correct reason. MSNBC helped Trump get elected for the sake of ratings. Our Democracy is a risk now. It’s weird how money drives things instead of doing the right thing. The right thing is the facts and the truth.
Are you that ignorant that you believe this was Trump’s fault that the economy has fallen back as much as it has? Do you really believe that? Perhaps pandemic was a major factor?
That's why I added the comment below.  Hillary did this exact thing they're claiming Trump will do.  As usual, accusing others of the very things they're guilty of.

Yes yes very true that man very much deserved to die for being a Trump supporter brave comment. Hopefully all right wingers die from covid. HOPEFULLY EVERYONE THAT DOESNT THINK EXACTLY LIKE ME DIES FROM COVID! HOW GREAT WOULD THAT BE?!  This is the continued narrative of the left
Barack Obama was making a major speech. The GNP tanked with worst report since reports began in’47. An American died of COVID every minute yesterday, so Trump was Trump trying to obscure the above. He failed. His comments about delaying the Nov. 3 election were unconstitutional.
All Trump volunteers should go on the 'sly' and wear Biden buttons in groups standing in lines. Trump supporters in Biden clothing. False sense if security
Reads as if Epstein was outlining a "defense" for her, knowing he might face increased scrutiny once Trump actually announced his candidacy.
INCOMPETENT ⁦ caused the never ever seen before worst drop GDP. DO NOTHING with COVID19 in the beginning but calling it a Dem hoax has over 153K dead &amp; put America in a RECESSION. TRUMP FAILED AMERICA! I like presidents that don’t kill us or the economy.
Wisconsin GOP Slams Donald Trump Over Election Delay Comments
State Sen. Fitzgerald goes WAY out of his way to defend Trump, but can’t be bothered to defend his constituents from #coronavirus.  And now he wants to do the same in Congress.   It’s time to #flipthe5th!  Vote for  this November.
Stupid people don't know it....so how did you get it MRS. DJ Trump...or did someone use a sharpie to explain it
Yes, NOT A TRUMP REPUBLI=CON PIMP
Since you put your man in the post office does it mean you have figured a way to dispose of votes so they can't be counted...after all it's the Trump way....con, con, con, and PIMP

Mrs. Donald John Trump is trying to change election date but Mrs Donald John Trump, the Veterans of America will be there to vote and physically evict you from public housing in Washington to cozier digs in another public housing called Singsing....
It’s like he forgets that Wisconsin was under a lockdown during the April election, and the reasoning for the delay was for safety.  Trump’s reasoning is he’s against mail in ballots, because he has repeatedly said it’ll harm republican chances in elections.  Hypocritical? Yeah.
You championed Evers trying to move the April election, and are now apoplectic on Trump's tweet suggesting the same....
I’m certain of it... and so is trump. That’s why he is freaking out.
😂😂😂 Trump is riling the base cause he knows the end is coming.
You better tell trump and the republicans that.
Obstruction and private trump-Putin conversations is what we have. Not to mention an AG who isn’t sure if foreign interference is illegal.

Putin uses his KGB tactics on pathetic gullible  &amp; controls him like a puppet. Trump wants #MoscowTrumpTower so Putin got him by the balls. Trump decisions to help Russia is for PERSONAL GAIN NOT for global security.
Here is why Doctor take time to watch note the authoritative contempt for half of America.
After watching  the Congress question google exe. This video after the 2016 election  says it all. The phrases used like we have to do a better job of telling people about minorities etc. Long video but revealing google position.

If we go to war with Russia which side will the Trump's be on!If VP were just in charge of foreign policy or if Joe Biden's polling with Black, Latino and Asian voters were higher than Hillary's I would agree.  The problem is he needs to win and win big to overcome all the shenanigans that the trump campaign are going to engage in.
Oh, yes, your great “leader” Trump finally gets on board with #Obamacare, 10 years later.
Trump? Accused of raping a 13-year-old.

Well...trump and his followers think he is God so maybe it's true.
There are two reasons I'm voting for Joe Biden: 1. KAMALA asked me to. 2. More people will die if we don't get rid of trump and I'm not a complete asshole.
Then I’m sure you are on board with 3 or 4 debates? Let’s go.
I honestly can’t wait to see a debate between  and Sleepy Joe! President Trump will CRUSH him in any debate! #MAGA
Save your tweet, because Biden’s apologies will be coming often. He can’t make a single statement that doesn’t cause people to scratch their heads.The question remains are these his real feelings or is his dimentia getting worse.If he’s going to become President, we need to know!
There is a great irony Donald Trump claiming that Biden "hurt the Bible" and "hurt God."   Plus bonus points for conflating being "against God and against guns."

PFFTTTT WHAT LOCAL NEWS STATION IS CALLING TRUMP A PEDOPHILE RAPIST??? CAN SOMEONE TELL ME SO I CAN WATCH IT???? Love my moms friends:)
If the DNC really wanted to get rid of Trump they wouldn't have run such a weak candidate and supported such a lame platform.  So don't blame me for what is totally at the feet of the DNC.  If they pull off a Biden win they will have to do it without me.  #DemExit
Apparently trumpies have extremely short memories. Ted Cruz forgot that trump called his wife ugly.
Someone thought it was funny to play "Live and let die" at a trump rally today. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣💀💀💀
I thought for some time that Trump was the Antichrist.  But he can't be.  He's too stupid.
Great, now Dumpster is going looking for dead booty....shh, that's how Trump likes them. He likes them dead, so they can't file rape charges. Allegedly....
Trump says electing Biden will “hurt God.”  Clearly Trump hasn’t read the Bible.
Lol. Who needs stand-up comedians when we have Trump and Biden on tv every day 🤣
ok can someone explain why the same ppl who worship trump are the same ppl who say “ok sheeple, the government is trying to CONTROL YOU”  just make it make sense
TRUMP 2020 🤞🏼 get her out of office!
Glad to hear it. Polls saying there’s only a 3 point difference nationally now. How did trump tighten the gap so much?!
And I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.
Above the comprehension level of Trump toadies.
In Trump’ pocket.
Well, Trump has visible mental issues, and his cult is still all in.
The trump signs came yesterday when an old white dude on a three wheeled scooter went door to door asking to place signs.  The biden campaign is not going door to door. That means biden supporter are mad enough to go get their own signs.
My block has something interesting going on. Nearly every house has a political sign in the yard. Every house with a trump sign is owned by an old white dude. The one that isn't is visited by the police regularly for noise and disturbance issues, Deplorables.
Trump's inability to understand pandemic statistics is disturbing.  His cognitive handicaps are displaying in ways that I think most people didn't expect.
And trump basically said Ron was going to help him rig the vote in Florida. Can we please sell Florida back to Spain?
a Trump 2020 mask? is that a joke?  the old white man w the purse
Good thing they social distanced. I guess Trump has just magically avoided the virus for 6 months rather than because of constant testing and certain whitehouse protocols? Or maybe it’s the Hydroxy cocktail?
At this point are you suggesting Trump should never appoint/hire a black man or women from this day forward, because it will look political? Is he allowed to talk to black people, or should he avoid that as well?
Ignore Trump and go hard after Biden's VEEP. 2016 redux
I know when the ban went into place. We began screening returning flights on January 20 and put the ban on Jan 31. To say no response happened is ignorant of the actual timeline of events and actions taken. Here’s your January 15 news btw .
This is a joke right? First No one knew of a case on January 15. And even if we did, what should have happened in your estimation with the knowledge on of 1 case?Two questions for you. When was Trump being impeached? Despite that when did he issue a travel ban to China?
I feel like I must be gaining then immediately losing new followers, esp. liberals who follow me when I say I saw the Floyd vid and agree the Chauvin was in the wrong or say "If Trump is found guilty of being a cho mo w/ Jeff, let him burn"... and then they read my other posts.
Remember that National Popular Vote Interstate Compact that I used to scream about on here? Yeah, we should have tried harder to get our state governments to pass that. There are too many republican state governments and trump is going to try to get them to cheat.
A Ukraine company gaining favor with the Obama WH by hiring the Biden’s son is just a tad different than a US official having connections to the Trump WH and getting his job a son. There are no national defense implications there. You don’t see the difference?
Somewhere between 5 and 9 every day of Trump's presidency
What day day did Trump know about it and no one else did?
1/2  So I have been trying to find the number of eligible voters in the US and have not been able to. One article said that Clinton and Trump each received approximately 27% of eligible voters votes in 2016. This would mean there were approximately 233-244 eligible voters in 2016
I'm just waiting for him to admit he's going to help trump cheat.
Yes cuz the handle Tony ever shit show is not exactly a troll at all huh?   I was referring to friends of mine I personally have never taken a handout from the government. I once was a proud Republican until Trump.
Hey, Sam! I'd love to hear the conversation between you and John Yoo related to his book, "Defender in Chief: Donald Trump's Fight for Presidential Power."  I believe this to make an interesting conversation.
It is said that Trump supported The Great American Outdoors Act because he thought it had something to do with Israel.  Yosemites and all...
Trump: “Tik Tok, it’s an amazing thing, whatever it may be.”
HOLY SHIT. trump just said he thinks the explosion in Beirut was an attack not an accident and he said that THEY think it's an attack.  He's lying so he can inflame tensions and distract from the domestic disaster and his own failure.

I do not always agree with Pres. Trump, but I think he is right about mail-in voting. Why do I think he is right? It is because the left thinks it is a good idea. Politics has a way of bringing out the worst in everyone. It is not hard to see how this will go wrong. Stop the left
When I see a Trump sign in my neighborhood my heart hurts
For two weeks until they reevaluate on October 1. It’s the school district’s choice at this point. Just like it is across the US. Should Trump send Barron to another county? Very disingenuous tweet on your part!
Wow, liberal shit rags are trying to spin this politically? You know what, if Trump is found to be unequivocally as guilty as everyone else, despite kicking Jeff outta Mar-a-Lago in '02... I'll have no problem throwing him to the dogs with the CLintons. *IF*... juss sayin.
Trump does not care about anyone but himself.  He never has and never will.
OK, so yesterday I get an email from Team Trump not asking for $, but asking us to wear masks as an act of patriotism. Annnnd top trending now is "SHUT YOUR MOUTH" ... was asking us all to wear a mask reverse psychology? Are liberals now 100% anti-mask? That 4D chess playin mofo!

Fuck Trump. He still pushes fake news. If Kushner and him allowed the virus to spread because it was a blue state problem,  them a seat in prison awaits them both
Try again.
You sound like Trump. Hope you don’t forget this promise if elected. Based on your record I’m sure you don’t mean this.
Agreed, they were kinda asking for it. Derp on their part. Perhaps it was the thrill of it all. And there's a big diff. between a President and a football player, legally speaking anyway. So, you are saying you don't like the Trump celebrity death threats, right? Griffin, etc...

Now, again, I only support Trump about 50/50, off-hand. I could give you a more accurate score if I looked up EVERYTHING he's voted on. However, I have always enjoyed setting the record straight to ppl w/ TDS: Here's Trump being hella racist.
Except most of the Hip Hop and Entertainment World. Here's exhibit 1 of 2.  The name drops were not smearing him, but saying stuff like "yea, I'm rollin like Trump, got mad stacks, G!"
Ya gotta point there. Why do you think so many people liked anti-establishment Bernie, Trump, or the Libertarian party? Tired of Lame Ducks.
Calling me a Trumpster is like someone from my side of the isle calling a Bernie bro a Biden fan. In your TDS-addled mind, anyone who gives Trump even ONE positive point is a Trumpster.
You need to educate yourself on the individuals that comprise the Lincoln Project. Although they have disagreements with Biden on policy, they understand Trump threatens our democracy. They are patriots who are putting country over party.
Are you the same GOP nominating Donald Trump?  Fitness for office isn't your position of strength.
Trump or Jo Jo. I'm not voting for a senile pedophile, sorry. And if Maxwell names Trump under oath, well... At least I still have someone I can vote for and believe in. Unlike the two party quagmire choosing a turd over a douche yet again, out of FEAR.
And his claim to fame was his persona in the 80s, numerous magazine articles, most notably in Playboy mag, and a 15 year reality show he hosted, many movie cameos, etc. Idiot. Oh and like 100s of hip hop son name drops before running for prez. Rappers used to love Trump. LOL
Who are we talking about, Biden or Trump? J/k! Trump "admitted" to having had sex with a woman who wanted to willingly have sex with him and then he ran for Prez and thought, despite JFK and Clinton before him, America wasn't ready for an openly SWINGER prez., so he paid hush$.
Actually, I was just telling someone I may go with Jo Jo if Trump were to say, get named by Maxwell in a sworn deposition. I'm not happy with much of his foreign policies nor am I thrilled about him constantly caving into the left. I'm just anti-Leftist, that's all. 50/50 Trumper
If trump promised free college and m4a they'd all vote for him. He wouldn't even have to deliver on it.
btw, for someone as anti-Trump as you are, you're doing a great job at talking to someone who is admittedly pondering voting for him or Jo Jo. No Ad Hom, or anything like it. (y) If Trump gets convicted of Pedo, guess who's short foray into conservatism is over? It's that easy.

Naw, no thanks. I'm either voting Trump or Jo Jo and I'll sit on that fence until election day. A lot of that has to do with Biding my time to see if any credible allegations are leveled against Trump IF Maxwell lives long enough to spill the beans. 1/2
What that Biden's biggest quality among liberals is that he's not Trump? I saw that the other day. Sad. That the top 3 qualities most liberals love about Biden is that 1: He's 2. Not. 3. Trump. That is truly sad and wholey unconvincing. Trump's gonna win again. (y)

As a city councilmember I get a lot of people writing with this lie. Testing less just means you don’t know who has COVID, it doesn’t make it go away.  By Trump logic if we tested less we would have less cases and presumably less deaths. 😂 This is why USA is losing this battle.
Good thing we don’t have to worry about that. The question is what will be the next Russian hoax to come about in January from the Democrats. We heard this same thing in 2016 about Trump. The time invested in nonsense by the Left media and social media is mind blowing!
4/? ...to resist Trump we have to stop falling for his tricks. We need to love our enemies. We need to stop using derogatory terms for them. We need to show where we agree with them on issues no matter how small.  Be it anything on any issue.  Not just politics. Show them that..
3/?  ...supporters of their errors or flawed thinking.  Trying to reason doesn't ever work.  But showing that we do agree on some things and responding in love instead of hate will tear down some parts of this wall that Trump has built between us. If we really want to resist ...
2/?  ...maybe we shouldn't call them MAGAts and other such names.   Maybe they shouldn't call us derogatory names either.   I do know that common ground exists.   I am going to look for that common ground wherever I can and no longer look toward convincing Trump supporters of...
1/? I've been thinking about terminology, hatred and Trump's tactics of dividing the nation.  It seems that everything he does is intended to sew anger and hatred of one side for the other and we are all falling for it.  I don't like conservatives one bit but maybe. . .
41% of the US population voted in the 2016 election for President.   19% of the US population voted for Trump.  We can easily assume that half of that number was his base in 2016. (9.5% or 12.4 million people.)  We can be pretty sure it is less today.  They are a small group.
The White House and its GOP allies appear to be retreating from their opposition to a $600-per-week supplemental unemployment benefit that has propped up both the economy and family budgets but expired Friday.
Well you know how much Trump loves the First Amendment.
This is hilarious, we all know why Biden "shouldn't" debate Trump... Biden fumbles over himself all the time, how can you have a proper dabte when Biden needs a teleprompter and pre-arranged questions? Maybe Trump will correct him and say "Arizona is a state, Joe."

I'm not a trump guy but you lying....
If the Dems are honestly concerned about Trump's tweets about the election, then make sure the polls are open for voting in person. Absentee ballots are fine, but voting by mail is a recipe for disaster. Not afraid of the left, but afraid of what they will do to the USA.
I fear that, as despicable as Trump has been in the past 3 1/2 years, and recently seems to have upped his game, much worse will happen between the election and inauguration.  No matter who wins.
I'll never be a trump guy, but you know obama started the "cages," right? Don't be a hypocrite.
You said THE SAME THING when people asked what to do when Trump suggests delaying the election. And you learned NOTHING.
They were never leaving the Trump camp. They’re fully entrenched. He could shoot them on Fifth Avenue, and they’d still vote for him (if they survive).
Wisconsin’s Republican legislative leaders and the state’s longest-serving Republican in Congress are breaking with President Donald Trump over possibly delaying the Nov. 3 presidential election.
So let's just say that Trump is building his own coalition to not only remain in power but to form an alliance of certain nations to take over the world.  Just a thought I had since we bought Brazil and no one even noticed.

And this is exactly one of the points of his tweet. Trump can be a master twitter troll at times.
Sure but his boss (Obama) started it during his administration so he's as much to blame (if not moreso) for it as Trump.
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.
Those of you losing your minds over Trump's question about postponing the fall election are falling for an obvious troll. Have you not learned over the last 4 years what a master Twitter troll he is?

I hope you are correct. I suspect that they may go D after Trump in 2024, maybe more traditional D, less progressive (fingers crossed)
No social distancing, hardly any masks. President Trump is an absolute joke.
How exactly does “Trump strive to create chaos”?  *I have a feeling this answer is going to be hilarious.
Those that opposed Obama didn’t cause chaos.   Those that oppose Trump are creating chaos.   Thanks for making my point.
More honesty to the american people. Trump has claimed it is a hoax and he hasn’t seen it. He’s lying. He has wealth of info from our cia, but unfortunately he doesn’t listen to them or care. He is to busy golfing

I am sure she is reviewing and approving the questions right now. 🙄 We all know how Chris feels about Trump so why would we watch??
Biden screwed up because he’s too old and too white to know how to answer properly. He is not however racist and cruel like Trump. It simply illustrates why Biden needs a person of color as his VP. He doesn’t know how to reach them alone.
I wasnt aware that Trump was British.  Now I want to see his long form birth certificate.
Or nobody just wants to hear the bullshit you put up about Trump every day

donald trump is a white supremacist

Literally a minute ago he also tried to convince me we have a say in the US vote😂...it’s already decided, not by the people..it’s decided by the greater powers..in this war, if the “good guys” are positioned to win, Trump will win “the vote” or something else with a win for good
I'm in New Berlin, WI and I have seen (2) signs for Biden and A LOT for Trump.    A have (2) friends that work for city (courthouse) they LOVE EVER's.  Courts are closed and they get full pay for doing NOTHING.
TRUMP
No more ignoring tRump’s sorry ass. He’s a fraud and is followed by underworld dogs.
So it makes sense to me that we FOR SURE, need to win the Senate back and hold the House.  If Trump would happen to win by cheating, if we have control of  House and Senate we can impeach and remove.
So, as my husband continues to volunteer for the Greendale WI Dems, he ended up calling a first time voter, and she thinks Trump's a dick, but is very frustrated that she has to choose between two creepy old pedophiles this fall.  He marked her as "Leaning Biden".
He said that he was so forward looking to debating Trump.
Putin is paying the taliban. He would do it probably on his own, but putting up a front of us support and bromance with trump is important, or pay the guys who will kill soldiers either way but knowing that you are playing both hands. Undermine our interests, but on surface 👍🏻
Just keep bringing this up. Trump has 10 new scandals every day, but actively supporting a country and organization who is actively killing our soldiers is unheard of. He is a traitor, dereliction of duty, and is actively working to undermine global security and kill soldiers
Trump is bringing people together!
Stop saying mean things about my president. I’m voting for you Mr. Trump as are most of my friends. Thank you for signing this bill.

Well as we've seen with the unnamed cops in Portland, nobody enforcing the mask mandate and and all the laws trump has broken, rules just don't matter anymore.
There’s no “letting”.   Trump makes all choices of what he wants to do and say.  Listens to nobody.
Millions will cast their vote by mail and Trump wants to cut their funding. Really! They are already not funded enough.
Sending millions of kids to school is a death sentence. And if ANY person regardless of political party has committed child abuse and trafficking, they should go to jail. Whether that’s Clinton or trump. we don’t care. Justice for ALL

IT'S NEVER HARD TO SPOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER.
THERE IS NO CASE THAT HOLDS ANY WATER FOR RE-ELECTING TRUMP.
MOST OF AMERICA ROLLS THEIR EYES EVERYTIME TRUMP SPEAKS OR TWEETS, SO WHAT IS YOUR POINT?
My guess is that not a lot of people are going to show up and Trump doesn’t want to be embarrassed about the crowd size (a la Tulsa), so he doesn’t want the press to report that. Which ok, but then you aren’t going to get the free publicity that comes with a convention
Are you saying we shouldn’t be smart. What the fuck is your logic. Hey there doing it so it’s ok we do it. This is the Trump logic.
She’s not a Trump. She speaks in complete sentences
Sounds like destruction of FEDERAL PROPERTY.  Trump should send in his bogus Federal Police.  They should leave Portland and head on over.
Take a dump in it or dog poo, smear it around, let it dry. Make sure if you flip it upside down nothing falls out. Spray with perfume or cologne. Then find a car with a trump bumper sticker or yard sign. Leave it on the porch or tucked into windshield. Enjoy
South of tomahawk Joey.  Up nort, where the city dwellers go in the summertime and I have no idea why anyone lives there in the winters.  Science should trump politics.
This is just all so surreal.  I still cannot wrap my head around all we have had to endure under Trump and a GOP party who sold their soul to him and sold out the American people, our Democracy in the process.

But didn't you hear? Trump is banning it in the US
Gotta share again! Don’t forget this in the mess of trump drama!
I haven't seen many trump signs, but a republican incumbent in a state assembly has his signs all over. He's  been in the position for years, 80, done nothing. We have his Dem opponent's sign as well as a Biden sign. Lots of those around here.
Trump is trying to remove Tic Tok for only one reason. 20-30% of the short videos are better campaign ads for VP Biden then he can handle and J Biden isn’t spending a time. Keep them up and add a hell of a lot more, a lot more. The scumbag will be gone January 20th. Then to jail
The kids are at it again!🤣🤣  Trump campaign is giving away free stuff if you volunteer.  On kid is getting like 30 boxes.🤣🤣🤣  They are going to have burning parties.🤣🤣🤣🤣  Lesson:  Don't mess with Tic Tok or the kids who are gonna help us vote this orange ass out!
The communities hit hardest by the COVID virus are the elderly (who are probably on social security, so costing the government money) Blacks and Latinos. With this in mind, is it any wonder Trump has never had a cohesive plan to fight the virus and has battled against testing?

The Left wants Americans sick with Covid.  It is obvious, which is why the rioters and protesters do not have any restrictions.   If numbers go up, they can blame Trump.  The Left is pathetic but eyes are opening to what is really going on.  Thank you for fighting for Americans.
Me too! No seat taken from the house or senate, she knows international politics and security, has drive, passion, and kicks trump and pences ass. I think her or duckworth would be the best but I’m game for whoever Biden picks. Seriously I’d take a cat or a grilled cheese for him
This is why the  shouldn’t be able to be apart of charities. Just like how trump and his kids aren’t allowed to run m because they robbed from veterans and children with cancer
don’t worry about these idiots replying to you 😬 Trump is a 🤡 and the educated people over here are working everyday so he doesn’t get a voice again.
Or maybe cuz if he mandated it people would throw a living fit. Even if it was a full on cure or not. Trump does something and the left feels the opposite. He can't win either way. People don't like government control.
My favorite part is when the left replies with well you know Dersh is tied with Trump and they're dirty and I'm like look MFer I don't subscribe to the two party system like the rest, as far as I care lock up anyone involved in these pedo rings, Left, Right, all of em! 🤣 LULZ

Would he also like to announce an EO to make seatbelts mandatory? Some you are just so incredibly stupid. Praising a man for trying to enact something that already exists is amazing. It’s like Trump is an only child of every racist bigot in America, so everything he does is great
Looks pretty identical to Trump's!
The expectation was over time the rates would go down. That had happened by the time Trump arrived. That’s more my work plan, everyone pays the same.  The preexisting condition coverage, it was going to be expensive at start with sick people eligible for coverage &amp; using it.

Conservatives be like "Biden is racist too" and ABSOLUTELY but what's your point????? We don't like Biden either but we're settling????? Just because someone else who has a different political orientation than you is racist doesn't absolve the fact that Trump is a bigot! Go away!
God knows what is in your heart. God knows trump is all about himself and what he can get out of it.
I went out to a State park in my county yesterday and on the way there I saw large support trump/pence signs. Made me sick.  I guess farmers like him for some reason. They just don't get it.
In order to apologize for wrong doing, one must understand the basic concept of Right v. Wrong. Donald Trump does not understand this concept. So this, he can not apologize because he believes everything he does is right...
remember when donald j trump was the first president ever in the history of presidents to allow a whiff of re-election concerns creep into his foreign policy and so he just had to be impeached? good times all around!
And replace the name Biden with Trump and we have the present  reality!

Where do we start, there are so many "only hire the best" names associated with Trump. If it is $10M per person, this would be like winning the lottery!
He most certainly would have.  He was the wrong choice and the Democrats will have to wait four more years after failing to defeat the most beatable incumbent since Carter (Trump is far more beatable that GHWB).
That’s fine, but Biden also has a responsibility to uphold his commitment to live out the teachings of the Catholic faith that he likes to flaunt.  Trump too with his evangelical faith.

true.  but it does violate norms (or if you prefer reinforce the norms obama began to set and trump doubled down on) around abandoning any pretense of public trust and harnessing non political functions of govt to harass ones political opponents
Trump only cares about himself... the rest of us are just a roadblock to his re-election.
Trump needs to stop testing at the White House until everyone can get a test without a week long wait for results.
This is bad!! #VoteTrumpOut
Pretty disappointed Trump, you know you can register him in other schools ...
Right, when trump pauses he lies, come to think of it lies whenever he opens his mouth.
this account always gets it right:  is going after  not Trump (yet, she will if he wins)  If criminalizing political differences is now the new norm, its time for  state attorney's general to start indicting   et al
But we need to takeout the DOJ Trump goons who won’t go that direction independently.

Doesn’t that 50% translate into the 36% solid base that Trump  has had since the start.
Nikki Haley probably has a much better chance of beating Biden than Trump does at this point.  An indictment, which gives us a shot at a  /  ticket in 2020 would be an absolute gift.
fwiw hard to imagine tish james will indict trump.  DNC goal is to hurt Trump, but not force him from the race. Avg democrat is less supportive of biden, than wants trump out of office. Avg republican is less supportive of trump, than wants to keep antifa out of power

I’m anti trump.  I think that Biden is an useful idiot that we can use.  I’d rather have incremental change than nothing as well.  If the greens get over that 5% cool, but I think it would be much easier to retake the party with progressives than trying to sell something new

Trump need to get his son off Spotify 😂😂😂
Anyone feel like Seth Rollins is talking to Donald Trump here? #WWERaw
Dude trump has literally done nothing but golf more than any other president ever and taken credit for what others have fixed or started to fix.
TRUMP IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!!!!!
Bernie Sanders has been in Kenosha at least 4 times, He did a national TV special on MSNBC talking to Trump Supporters here.  Hilary Clinton was her in '08 primary.  Kenosha is on the map politically.  Dems want it bad, dems here are fighting hard.  Lots of libs and progressives.
But trump is the incumbent and I have no idea how elections work
"homie (Trump) needs to stay in his lane" 😂   Loved it on MSNBC
If trump didn’t keel over neither will Biden
So, Trump wants a kickback for the sale of TikTok!
Trump makes me 🤮🤮🤮🤮
I am not a Trump supporter. It doesn’t help when the Democrats parade out corrupt trainwrecks without articulated visions for the future. I still believe Trump is a neo-fascist, but the alternative is a weak manipulatable man with zero core values and is suffering from dementia.
A return to decency and stability, something our White House has not had under trump.
They are keeping it secret if they are!  This may be Trump’s real, imaginary coup!
God bless President Trump!!
Moments ago: Trump to sign executive order on hiring American workers  via
No. Only Trump haters.
The way this article frames things is so dishonest.  the violation of norms here is not trump it’s the push to untested mass mail in voting that is guaranteed to make it difficult to have a clear cut answer by Jan 20th.   We still don’t have a victor in NY-12  primary
Microsoft to continue talks to potentially acquire TikTok's US operations after Trump threatened to ban the app in the US
Thank you President Trump #MAGA2020
Rule #1....Trump not allowed to answer any question in a way that would appear to make Joe wrong.
You will also notice I follow Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren,etc. I follow various people getting various perspectives. I voted against Trump in the national election in 2016. If someone is correct on something, I will retweet it. I challenge falsehood and hypocrisy from all people.
I also see lots of Trump flags here in Wisconsin. I don’t believe Biden is leading. Trump 2020.
The point is he doesn’t. People will vote for him because they are brainwashed. They think Biden will do all these good things and he won’t. Are economy will take a big tank. And we will be worse off then we are now. Trump will pull it all back together.
Anything's better than Trump...
It's the most bizarre thing. We're 3 months from the election and Trump still doesn't really know who he and Pence are running against. I mean, really?!?!
Looks like the GOP is awaiting your demise too. #RepublicansForBiden #TrumpHasNoPlan
Microsoft to continue talks to potentially acquire TikTok's US operations after Trump threatened to ban the app in the US
You mean the same thing Trump supporters subject black peoples to? It’s not fun when the shoe is in the other feet, does it?
That doesn’t make him conservative and you can be conservative and hate trump my guy.
dEbAtE sAm SeDeR sO i CaN fEeL vAlIDaTeD  At least he says that Trump is in charge of him lmao
I think it’s Trump in disguise - same body profile view.  He’s trying to throw us off with the green hat. 😂
Mitt stood with BLM, a foundation started by trained marxists that wants to breakup the nuclear family. I’m a loving and open person, but If you support that over Trump then please move to Venezuela and leave America to the serious adults!! 🇺🇸
They want people to DOUBT THE RESULTS. Because Trump is going to win.
Mary Trump is a force to be reckoned with!  I love that her book broke records and #ByeDonJr ‘s didn’t, even after the RNC bought massive copies 😂🤣😂🤣
Any doubts Trump will win in a landslide? Read this. 👇  Mostly note the direction the numbers have shifted in just one month.
He’s not the one pictured with underaged girls nor accused of being one that abused these underaged girls.  Trump is the one has enough pervy photos and comments with and about his own daughter.
Where are they? I’m no Trump supporter. I didn’t vote for him. However I see the Black Lives actually Matter movement being hijacked by an organization that is marxist. The Bolshevist demands and tactics are similar to this group. I reject Antifa, communism, the KKK, and fascism.
This narrative drives me crazy, along with the idea that Biden needs to win swing states by a lot so that Trump can't contest them. A win is a win, even if WI or PA end up being extremely close
You have heard Trump’s incoherent rambling “speeches” correct? Biden will own him on the stage and again in November. 🖕🏻🖕🏽🖕🏿
Right wing? Wrong. Stick to the subject. "Facts"? Trump personally never filed bankruptcy. And a few failed business ventures pales in comparison to the hundreds of successful. If you had 1 iota of business sense, you'd know that. You don't. And I dgaf about his personal life.
Self-burns are so beautiful when they happen in nature!!  Trump is right. This country sucks. After the last 4 years...we need a change. Good call boss. It takes a real man to admit he failed. We’re all proud of you backing
Trump will walk right off stage.
Why do think trump wins this?  You have data on that?
Trump would never even give her the time of day. He only likes young beautiful women!
At this point he’d pretty much have to kill someone for me to not vote for him. ...oh wait, even then it couldn’t compare to the 100s of thousands Trump will be responsible for killing before this is all over. Short answer: Hell yes.
Please please debate Trump. 😂 Must see tv.
Absolutely. I don’t think Biden has anything to gain by debating Trump.
Rob, I think Trump is right!  We should change the election date. We should have it next week!!  Too long to wait until November!
He was on his way out until the anarcho-communists came out from under their rocks and have created mayhem.  These goofs are guaranteeing Trump’s re-election.
Every time I see one of their ads my first thought is wow! This is great. But then I think if it were anyone but Trump, the ads would be about Democrats and I wonder how angry they would make me then.
I’m sure Trump’s calling him a dumbass!
trump isn’t gonna ban tiktok
And Trump wouldn’t lock HER up as he promised, so why would we expect Trump to lock HIM up?
Trump waisted $500 million by overpaying for ventilators at $15,000 a piece instead of the $3500 that was originally negotiated
On Par for Trump 🤷🏼‍♂️
Again it’s not about supporting Biden its about being anti trump and his Administration. But again let’s remove all nuance do we can be mad at people
Donald Trump fails to draw a crowd as he lands in Florida #SmartNews #ThePartyISOver #RIPGOP
This the reason Trump banning tik tok
Trump signing an executive order over tiktok and not doing shit about literally anything else really fuckin says some shit
No, the vote is most likely not counted.  A vote for trump is a vote for trump
China isn’t the only bad one.  Trump’s America is quickly turning on its citizens.
FINALLY! Trump did something great..... getting rid of TIkTok is the best thing he’s done since he’s been in office
my lord imagine having spent the last 4 years listening to all the griping that trump only ran for president to feed his ego, and then still assert that ego feeding ambition is considered an *admirable* trait in a man.
I mean, he’s not wrong but doesn’t he ultimately manage the sport? Maybe he should do something instead of threatening. Sounds like Trump. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Where is your evidence? Trump and Clinton can share a cell if both are guilty.  Work for You?  #IMPOTUS #ImpotusAmericanus #TrumpOrAmerica
That seals it, I'm voting in person come November.  Massive delays hit postal service under Trump's postmaster-General
I said 6 countries before Trump announced he would.  Others did the day he announced and others when it went into effect.
You really can't save these idiots from themselves.
Only six countries did so before Trump announced he would.
oh man trump once made a joke to epstein in a night club thats exactly the same thing as staying overnight in a villa with him and two young girls
Trump has taken action when governors and mayors have clearly failed to fulfill their most basic and fundamental of duties.
this is tired.  the preponderance of available evidence dictates that  1. Trump: knew he was a general sleazeball, was not participant in, may not have known of, illegal activities  2. Dersh: almost certainly knew everything that went on, may not have participated  3. Clinton:
Trump and Co is out to kill us all!
I think this places him much much closer to the scene of the crime than anything that’s come out vis trump, yes.  I don’t see room for any other reasonable view here
I’m not under any illusions that trump is a decent human being.  And if there was a better alternative for president I’d take it. But that’s still not the same as, it’s in fact very far from, his being participant in underage orgies.
We still don’t!  We can pray enough people have turned against Trump that voter suppression doesn’t alter the true result!
If Trump and the GOP had been promoting wearing masks 6 weeks ago Cain would still be alive.
there is evidence they spent time together as neighbors and members of the same social circle.  There is no hint of evidence that trump participated in Epstein’s illegal activities.
People are waking up to this truth.  This situation has made many, who were going to vote against Trump, rethink their choice.  The Democrats had the White House sealed up until they allowed these clowns to run amok.  Now neo-fascist Trump will get 4 more years.  Great job, dolts
“Trump paid more for ventilators in the middle of a global pandemic / shortage, than Obama did in ordinary times”  You people are sick plain and simply sick  Maybe if Obama had bought enough ventilators in ordinary times Trump wouldn’t have had to pay surge pricing
talk about lying #FakeNews!  at the rally Trump joked that he told his advisors to stop testing which was dishonestly reported as an admission by the Fake News  Here Trump rightfully points out that more testing means more cases, but there is no hint that he wants less testing
They wouldn't be bringing up hypothetical scare scenarios if they were confident in the poll numbers.  They need their side to doubt the election results when Trump wins.
The damage  has done to our families, our nation &amp; our economy will take years, if not lifetimes, to fix. Here’s a perfect example of Trump &amp; family putting their political needs ahead of our nation’s wellbeing. Beyond reprehensible.
Let’s save it for the next president. We will get a shit job done with Trump trying to pocket the money for himself and family.  Big No!
They think everyone has dirt on Trump. Never pans out.  Don't they realize that as much as these celebrities and elite people hate Trump right now, that if any one of them had actual evidence against him, it would get released stat?  They got nothing.
Trump 2020 ❤️
😂The loser accepts them?? 😂😂 If that was the case then democrats, and major media outlets would’ve accepted Trump winning the election 4 years ago. But we all know how that one went. The losers never accepted Trumps victory and still don’t acknowledge it. Nice try
lolz trump is living rent free in your brain.  feel free to pick this up again when there is an eyewitness testifying under oath that trump stayed on the island w/ epstien in a villa w "2 young girls" (like there is clinton)
If we all tweet #TrumpHatesScience a bunch of times, then #TrumpHatesScience will trend. That’s how algorithms work. Now, if #TrumpHatesScience trends, Trump will see it. He will get mad. Just because of some silly hashtag...you know, #TrumpHatesScience
If Trump is correct... prove it. Give the Rep the “cure” and see how much better he gets!
What about the billions you inserted for the military?  Tell me how that helps people affected by Trump Virus?
They are not teachable.  They love Trump because he is soulless just like them.
I hope trump sees this. #TheyreAllLaughingAtYou
If Trump and the rest of the GOP had been wearing and promoting masks 6 weeks ago he’d still be alive.
Trump killed him!
Trump killed him!
Trump 2020. I’m walking in to vote. No mail in ballots it will be rigged. Guaranteed .
On news of record-breaking US economic downturn, Trump distracts with tweet about delaying election
No matter when it happens. I’m walking in to a poll. Wearing my mask and bringing hand sanitizer. I don’t trust mail in ballots. Trump is worth it. Trump 2020. If we don’t walk in we’re screwed.
Trump may have been cut out out of partisan spite but he has been a more effective leader against racism than the whole lot of them combined
Bush can speak from one side of his mouth but he and his pappy cultivated the worst instincts of the Republican Party.    Only Trump has led GOP decisively against racism and they hate him for it
Trump unleashed the most violent and racist agents in the country on American citizens. #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Cain went to the Trump rally without eating Godfathers Pizza first.  He contracted COVID-19 at the rally.  Godfathers Pizza clearly saves lives.
Herman Cain failed himself.  Cain played the fool and court jester for Trump and paid the price.  Trump is not the Nation.  And Cain played the COVID-19 Pied Piper role willingly!
Biden is obviously a clairvoyant or just understands Trump better than you!
Lmao what a wimp.  via
Yet here they are politicizing it.  Joe has also been politicizing it all along.  Trump has too.  It’s just a hypocritical garbage ad.
Trump is an angel of death!

And here we go!! BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
I can't wait to vote for Trump. These haters are psychotic.
Trump Suggests Unprecedented Delay to November Election
The fact is the only real compelling argument *for* trump is to compare him to alternatives.   When mainstream media drops all pretense of professionalism/ integrity (as Kessler is doing here), he is lending credence to trumpism.
at q here isn’t whether trump is best person to be president, at q is facts &amp; context around the bounty story. Powell who is openly opposed to Trump politically (not interested in supporting him) is simply telling the truth. Kessler is deceiving.
Basically his statement stereotypes and identifies minorities as the people who shouldn't be welcomed in predominantly white neighborhoods.   Trump boasts of pushing low-income housing out of suburbs  via

You're delusional nobody went out of their way to make trump look  incompetent but trump
It seems that Trump might want to avoid referencing the Christian Bible and stick to what he knows...maybe compare his and Biden's scandals with porn stars or lawsuits for fraud?  Trump: Let’s face it, Biden wants to “hurt God” and “hurt the Bible”

TRUMP CAN’T BE TRUSTED! brought to you from the US Military!
Saw you on Morning Joe Friday morning  with Trump and Putin you need to go from the idea he does what benefits Putin  everything Trump has done for the past five years has been to benefit Putin and destroy this country  whatever the excuse Trump follows Putin's orders
You're enabling Trump to do Putin's wish list  Dividing us  Killing us  Ignoring Putin giving Taliban weapons and a Bounty on our troops  Removing 12K troops from Germany  Creating chaos  Destroying our institutions  Trump and you are TRAITORS to this country
But  said kids couldn’t get covid!! Are you telling me benevolent leader was wrong?  Heartfelt sympathy to this family! Fight against Trump!
Biden should say Yosemite and Thailand, look at Trump and ask him if he pronounced them correctly!
And trump’s in on it!
Anybody who has read the Bible has a favorite verse and they can say over and over again  we all know Trump can’t read therefore he’s never read the Bible  simple as that
When you think about trumps mind you go to what benefits Putin  questioning mail in ballots and our election is a win-win for Putin  if Trump wins he’s got his guy for another four years if Biden wins he can say our elections is fraudulent it’s a win-win for Putin
That would be a very likely trump excuse
This might be the first time Trump has done something and I'm not sure whose side I'm on
Trump is against America
Whenever dealing with Trump you need to look at what benefits Putin and in this case he's creating chaos making us all unsafe and creating more of us being sick getting the virus  Trump is always doing things for Putin that's the bottom line and you need to figure that out
His following is turning on him. And now he is just acting like Cornette or trump. Its sad, because I used to respect him. Maybe it's the roids kicking in.

Dude trump is a scab that keeps getting picked. We need to be rid of him. I don't care that you are a republican or not. You have to see how be isn't good for our counrty.
He took some of those trump pills I see
They aren't taking requests until after trump is booted out of the white house, and then you have to apply for it.
The NRA is already in deep financial trouble. But I’m sure they were still able to give 30 million to trump’s campaign again.  Good riddance  !!
I was just happy it wasn't directly about Trump.  That would have DEFINITELY energized his base.
Completely ignoring the merits of this case, why would you do this 3 months before an election? This is going to drive republicans and gun supporters to Trump, regardless of their opinion of him.  Feels like Dems making a lot of mistakes that could cost them in November.
Trump is going to roll with the "they're trying to take your guns" thing now
You have to look at what Trump does from the viewpoint of Putin what is good for him  keep talking about a drug that doesn't work only creates chaos which is what Putin is always looking for here and around the globe  Trump is always looking to help Putin out so start from there
By being this cheer leader for Trump following his lead lying his head off will forever taint his reputation  to me it wasn't that great before now it's in the toilet  he should remember whatever Trump touches dies
You're assuming those asking questions would do their homework and push back at Trump calling out his lies which will be whenever he opens his mouth  he can't help it being addicted
I read this 3Xs. Trump makes no sense.
Why wouldn't Trump say nice things about this guy since Trump cheated on his wives  had affairs with Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal paying them off to the tune of 280K covered up by the national inquirer and admitted on the bus he kissed and groped women because he could

People and institutions didn't used to get so many death threats until Trump came on the scene especially being the president  remember the Trump follower in Florida sending pipe bombs to places like CNN and others Trump called his enemies
Whatever Trump touches dies
All republicans have taken their lead from their boss Trump  lie when they open their lips send out a tweet or email  you're too nice saying facts don't matter  they just flat out lie knowing they are lying they just don't care  that is unless the voters punish them at the polls
The thing is interviewers normally don't push back or point out to Trump when he said something that is wrong or incorrect  they don't do their homework like Swan
By "the virus" you mean Trump, right?
He’s got Trump’s back.
Donald Trump ended a nearly 20-year-old ban on selling gun silencers to foreign buyers in July. The ban,which was implemented in 2002,was intended to prevent terror organisations from gaining access to American silencers.  This lifting of this ban helps Russia kill our soldiers!
Just for reference...there’s no way people ironically like Donald Trump’s tweets right?
To be fair, the POTUS isn’t allowed to drive. But I don’t ever remember seeing tRump drive anything than a golf cart before he was president

That didn’t take long for the real Donald Trump to come out.
So says this conservative biased spice:
So Biden "clarifies" but Trump lies. Why no one watches you.
You're missing the point that a president any president shouldn't get involved in a private business matter unless there is public corruption  he Trump shouldn't be telling a company like TikTok they can't operate in this country  that's what countries like China and Russia

I am sorry... I have enjoyed exchanging view points,  I am sorry constant criticism is too much .  Support the corrupt democrats it’s your right.  President Trump has done so many things right, but nit picking everything is too much for me.   Good luck , God Bless

it's entertaining when he rips the Dem establishment, but my biggest complaint is that he keeps pretending there's no pandemic as he's urging people to not vote for Biden, 4 more years of Trump WILL get 100,000s killed who otherwise would live, election is literally life or death
Look if it Trump gets rid of Obamacare, but replaces with an identical health care bill, I'm fine.  It'll stop his attacks on people's health care, and we'll all know who really did the work...

Putin is Trump’s boss. Trump’s in our WH and this cannot be allowed. How can we trust Trump not to put Putin and Russia before this country? Trump has yet to protect our Troops from Putin’s bounties. It’s time for Trump to go!
Trump must be trying to fool the voters or did he drop the Lawsuit to get rid ACA that already covers pre existing conditions? It’s really hard to believe anything Trump says.
Does no one in the GOP understand that Trump isn't the only one on the ballot?  The govt will be reduced to 65 Senators - that's it - if there is no election.

How will the Coronavirus ever calm down when Trump won’t be honest with his supporters? He just won’t say that he got it wrong that the Covid-19 is very serious and contagious. He does his supporters a disservice and every person in this country. Trump refuses to be honest.
In 2006 Congress passed a law to require prefunding of 75 yrs for USPS pensions. They've been hurting since. Obama had both houses of congress, so did Trump. BOTH parties could have corrected this but didn't. THEY'RE BOTH RESPONSIBLE &amp; NEED TO FIX IT ASAP!
I’d def be more optimistic about that possibility if Biden weren’t so massively ahead in the polls. That’s why it’d arguably be kinda preferable if Trump weren’t imploding so horribly, b/c Biden might actually feel pressured to concede on at least one damn progressive policy lol.
I think this is a call to get the virus under control... Kids do need to be in school — but it can’t happen because of the incompetence of the Trump admin.... I think that is his point.
So, what you’re saying is: the Republican controlled Senate had 4 years to protect people with pre-existing conditions but did nothing to make it happen. Since Trump’s action isn’t law (and won’t actually change a thing) it’s important to vote for Democrats.  Will do! 👍
USPS problems started in '06 when congress passed a law requiring 75 year PRE-funding of USPS pensions. Obama had both houses of Congress from '09-'11, Trump from both from '16-'18. BOTH parties could have stopped this stupidity but didn't so BOTH are responsible for the problems

LOL why does Mobster Trump love China's Communist Party so much?  Does it remind him of Communist Eastern Europe where he bought his hooker for a 3rd wife ?

Thanks for supporting me Jo.  Also I agree with your statement about Trump.

Just freaking great! The Republicans constantly try to dig up dirt instead of making Policies and now Putin thinks he has a say so in America‘s business. We can blame Trump and the Republicans for inviting Putin into our business!

Putin really wants to keep Trump as President. That should be everyone’s motivation to vote for Biden. Every American should be tired of Putin’s ass in our Government!
And the divergence between counties Trump won (red) and counties Clinton won (blue) is even more striking.

But since nothing was done to prevent it from exploding in the US due to Trumps lackadaisical approach shouldn’t we call it the Trump virus!!?

At this point Biden and Trump are the same the only difference Biden can't put two sentence together without forgetting what he said 1 second earlier and Trump says thing and then lie and said he never said it no matter who wins Black America is screwed.
At this point no matter who wins the President Seat African Americans are screwed either way you Have Joe Biden who have of the time don't know what country he in and then you Trump who thinks his country is a game show because he has a lot of deaths on his slimmie hands.
No more senile then frumpy trump!
Trump?  Please.  Just look at his lifetime. No comparison. Find it interesting how trumpets are feeding into this. Actually, expected. Many of the pro-trump bots will zero in, as well.
Yup, we Americans have picked about the two worst people in the US to run for President.  Any one of you is probably better than Trump or Biden.  Maybe we deserve the disaster we get.
It was not meant as and insult. One would have to have the intent. It was not “meant”. Need to get off the that bandwagon of trying to disparage for the sake of trump.

Narcissistic! Big word for a Trump supporter. Trump's job does not include spewing lies on Twitter everyday. Yet, there he is every day. Now, go lie down, take a nap, and let us adults handle this.
OK all the more reason to make it just the usual sinful crap coming from trump.  Then why didn't he do something about it 2 years ago then?  His little feelings got hurt at the Tulsa rally and that's it!  I'm sure there are more important things he could 2 worry about than TicToc
It just shows how racism runs deep in the trump bloodline along with the cult. Really scary.

I think siggy has had too many face lifts. She's really losing her mind just like trump.  Have you seen her latest video on Twitter where she saying how much she loves her husband Michael and she's kissing and smooching and showing off her new face.
Seriously? Trump hates DOGS? Really? I could understand cats, because they can be aloof &amp; they're all more intelligent than him, but dogs? Wait... I'll bet dogs hate him, because they are a terrific judge of character.
When the h*** did that happen?  I don't recall any of that happening, burning buildings and wrecking cars maybe you're getting Charlottesville confused with the white nationalists that were backing trump. Nothing like that happened 2016. You truly r delusional no matter what!!
I think Trump would have a heart attack if Biden picked Michelle or Hillary.

How will the Coronavirus ever calm down when Trump won’t be honest with his supporters? He just won’t say that he got it wrong that the Covid-19 is very serious and contagious. He does his supporters a disservice and every person in this country. Trump refuses to be honest.
In 2006 Congress passed a law to require prefunding of 75 yrs for USPS pensions. They've been hurting since. Obama had both houses of congress, so did Trump. BOTH parties could have corrected this but didn't. THEY'RE BOTH RESPONSIBLE &amp; NEED TO FIX IT ASAP!
I’d def be more optimistic about that possibility if Biden weren’t so massively ahead in the polls. That’s why it’d arguably be kinda preferable if Trump weren’t imploding so horribly, b/c Biden might actually feel pressured to concede on at least one damn progressive policy lol.
I think this is a call to get the virus under control... Kids do need to be in school — but it can’t happen because of the incompetence of the Trump admin.... I think that is his point.
So, what you’re saying is: the Republican controlled Senate had 4 years to protect people with pre-existing conditions but did nothing to make it happen. Since Trump’s action isn’t law (and won’t actually change a thing) it’s important to vote for Democrats.  Will do! 👍

So you’re saying Dems will fight against something they claim to favor because they don’t want Trump to get credit for it?
USPS problems started in '06 when congress passed a law requiring 75 year PRE-funding of USPS pensions. Obama had both houses of Congress from '09-'11, Trump from both from '16-'18. BOTH parties could have stopped this stupidity but didn't so BOTH are responsible for the problems

I'm no constitutional scholar, but this looks like a direct violation if the 3rd Amendment:

I don't understand why people are skeptical of Republicans who hate Trump and what's happened to the country at his hand. We have to get him out first, start rebuilding and then go back to policy debates. All hands on deck or the ship goes down with everyone on it, is what I say.
Yeah, great job forcing people back to work during a deadly pandemic that Trump has worked hard to lie about and ignore. No new jobs were created, unemployment is over 10% and 160,000 people are dead while you lie for an incompetent ass. Gfy! 🖕🏽
This whole 'scheme' sure seems odd. It's as if they WANT Trump - 4.More.Years. ;)

Trump is definitely for mail-in voting but only in places he thinks he can steal. I truly believe he thinks Democrats shouldn’t be able to vote by mail.

Then we would be losing Trump, because he is not a real adult.
We have been saying this from the beginning.   When men with MACHINE GUNS were in Michigan storming federal buildings, there was nothing.   Because they were white and doing Trump’s work.   “NO SYSTEMATIC RACISM” Barr states. He’s part of the problem.
What do you have against DACA. Please tell me.  They were brought here as children.  If they are hard working upstanding individuals who add to our economy, why not give them an opportunity for citizenship.  Trump keeps promising to do something, in reality he wants them gone.

It appears that all ads from Trump are altered in some manner to make Biden appear weak. Only a weak, scared, defeated person would do this. We all know trump has always been weak &amp; scared.
Journalists deep down want a trump win. It's more chaos they can report on and make money off of.
The obvious move for the Dems is to back Ted Nugent to steal votes from Trump.
Biden screwed up because he’s too old and too white to know how to answer properly. He is not however racist and cruel like Trump. It simply illustrates why Biden needs a person of color as his VP. He doesn’t know how to reach them alone.

Trump would have triggered protests at the WH for weeks with those comments. Biden is allowed to "clarify" what he meant BECAUSE SURELY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR A DEMOCRAT TO BE A RACIST.
Being overly generous, let's say President Trump's pronunciation to Thailand as "Thigh-land" was correct. Then why did he immediately correct himself after?
Hubris perhaps... not captivating. And foolish (but not surprising) of the Trump campaign to think Black folks are that simple. Then again these are the same brilliant strategists who thought the virus would stay in Democratic cities.
"Black" people voting for Biden is some sleep azz niggaz. More of us is voting Trump than y'all suspect.

Winning by a small margin isn't enough (Trump's tricks and dirty maneuvers), Biden needs at least around 320 to 330 EVs, to avoid Trump trying dirty maneuvers. Also, the senate is equally as important as winning back the White House. It's time to end Trumpism, forever!

Trump said: “My God is the best God, better than the Jewish God, the Chinese God, the Mohammed’s God and almosr as good as me”. This is the guy who had peaceful protesters removed by force so he could walk accross the street and hold a Bible upside down.
TRUMP sucks
What the actual fuck, he has shown no remorse for his administration, the quagmire in Iraq, the callous cruelty of his administration. He was considered the dumbest president in the modern era before Trump as well. The guy absolutely is horrific.
My understanding is that Trump typically skips customs.

I remember one time I pronounced Socrates as so-crates and another kid was like no moron it’s sah-crah-tees. That was grade school. Trump can’t pronounce Yosemite or Thailand...?
At least Trump doesn’t want to hurt God.
Please tell me Trump didn't actually fkng say this?!!
I didnt say you had to vote for trump. I’m genuinely curious why you would sacrifice your values like that tho and vote pro choice. I liked Biden more before I changed his stance on the Hyde amendment, at the bare minimum my tax dollars shouldn’t go towards abortions.
This is an exemplar of a terribly written survey. I’ll use it the next time I need an exemplar of bias. The stupidest part is the “other” doesn’t have a blank for the participant. This can only mean trump fears the truth. He can’t possibly be this stupid.
So is Trump planning on mixing the vaccine himself? The experts say next year so Trump must be planning on making the vaccine himself. Good luck America!
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Hydroxychloroquine prescriptions boomed; then thousands of adverse events were reported in patients
Seniors are given cognitive tests when a doctor feels there has be a decline in a patient’s mental capabilities. Obviously Trump’s doctor felt something was off with Trump’s mind. As yet a doctor hasn’t ordered Biden to be tested.

Endangered Earth: Trump Administration Unveils Its Latest Extinction Plan

Do you think him and Epstein didn’t mention the type of women he liked? Didn’t trump mention himself the type of women Epstein likes? But yeah let’s only focus on Trump saying “we had a falling out” despite their 15+ years of friendship 😂 Let that erase their history together
Whether he had a falling out later or not, we can’t ignore that Trump was friends with Epstein for 15 years as he said in 2002. Trump is someone men can be inappropriate around considering his “grab em by the pussy” comment. You think him and Epstein didn’t talk about women?
Why would you want someone in your administration that illegally got a guy off that you claim to hate. People questioned Acosta about the Epstein case before Trump Appointed him and it took Acosta himself to step down from the position Trump put him in.
Trump mispronouncing a foreign city is trending higher, with far less tweets, than Joe Biden being a blatant racist on TV. Still trust social media to tell the truth?

Expert explains the psychopathology that underlies Trump’s dictatorial behavior -
Trump is talking about a country called "Thighland" on a stage with Whirlpool washing machines.  Please God save us from this  nightmare.
I've said it before and I'll say it again: it's truly amazing how many people in Trump's orbit are just there to grift morons.  I'll hand it to them, though. If they're stupid enough to support him, they have a proven track record as a mark.
Today it does. Because Trump currently owes and controls the entire Republican Party. Dumping Trump means dumping McConnell and the rest of the clan. The GOP needs to be wiped out in November, order to do a full rebuild.
And will you investigate the Trump Organization as well?
Trump is a known liar but he goes too far when his lies about Covid-19 not hurting or killing children. He must be losing it b/c he knows his supporters believe every utterance he says. Trump is dangerous!

Wow. First the NRA is under investigation for miss managing funds and now Eric Trump too?  I can’t handle these *surprises* on the same day!
Don't fall for the Okie Doke yall. This is nothing but a ploy to take votes away from Biden and ensure Trump's reelection. It's a racist tactic to think Black voters won't see through their tricks. We see you though 👀

If Trump does steal the election, it will be a very dire warning sign, and could bring us to the brink of a constitutional crisis
People have to remember that trump isn’t the cause of all of the problems we face today; hes the result of those problems manifesting from a restless american people. This doesn’t end when trump goes away. Biden is a republican.
As Trump promoted hydroxychloroquine, prescriptions and serious adverse events and deaths spiked. Our analysis points to shortcomings of the FDA's drug safety database.
Joe Biden just said all black people think the same, and it's barely trending. When you do search Biden all the results are of Trump saying Biden will hurt God. One of these things is not like the other...

I mean, Biden is clearly not as religious as Trump, who we all know goes to church twice a week and is fingering his rosary CONSTANTLY. The man is always groping for closeness to the holy spirit. Literally grabbing god by the rectory. Also super honest.

I'm surprised that he's open to Rice. A reasonable person should be; but this gentleman clearly doesn't hail from the frothing-at-the-mouth Right-Wing Trump cult, for whom Rice would be a lightning rod for (unfounded, conspiratorial) attacks. Maybe she is a viable pick after all.
I pray for him to be wrong.  If Joe Biden would win, he would not be in charge, someone else will. America would be doomed.  Vote President Donald Trump for 2020.
because trump thinks he is God. that's the only way this makes sense.
You can repeat that statement with any number of supposed "values" that the Nihilist Right-Wing claimed. "I don't see how 'family values' conservatives can vote for any GOPers let alone Trump" "I don't see how 'Constitutional' conservatives can vote for any GOPers let alone Trump
I agree with you wholeheartedly! It’s so frustrating that I have to hold my nose and vote for Biden, just like I had to for Hillary. We need change and we need it now! All we have is a Hobson’s choice of a lukewarm Republican and Trump, an exaggeration of the “know nothing” party

Is this Kanye’s Wisconsin Election Slogan?? It’s clear getting Trump’s campaign to help him get his name on the ballot was not about Kanye but his support for Trump.  SHOULD MILLIONAIRES DICTATE WHO IS PRESIDENT??? SHOULD MILLIONARES GET MORE THAN ONE VOTE????  #kanyeajoke
KANYE, used TRUMP’s staff to help him file to be on the Wisconsin ballot in November.  He will try this in other swing states.  AREN’T YOU TIRED OF BILLIONAIRES/MILLIONAIRES deciding who will represent U.S.???? Please send this information to all, help U.S., save U.S., from evil!
KANYE thinks his vote is more important than YOURs. Now coordinating w/TRUMP,using his folks to get names;deliver paperwork to the WEC to get his name on Wisconsin’s ballot,an important swing state. Do you want to support another millionaire trying to fix the election for TRUMP??
I think the logic is there’s a certain percentage of people that absolutely will not vote for Trump and probably won’t vote for Jorgensen so giving them an option that still isn’t Biden helps Trump more than it hurts him

Is this going to end up being a situation where the Trump campaign will have to reimburse the government, like when AF1 is used for non-government purposes?
Let's talk about Trump' insistence that more testing means more (reported) cases. He argues that our low number of deaths per case shows we are out performing the world.  If we tested less, that number would increase substantially. (Same deaths / less cases = more deaths / case)

Percent deaths to percent obese please.  If we were half dead already, it's not Trump's fault.
If Trump is speaking then he is lying.

Obama did not appoint those judges. Nice try but typicall Trump Cult bullshit.
🚨 TRUMP FALSE FLAG OP🚨  1/ Incredible thread on a long, sustained disinformation and harassment campaign   I would like to point out one VERY EFFECTIVE and CONSISTENT tactic that Trump uses: PROJECTION  I have noticed this pattern over four years....
Ivanka Trump should be celebrated by the liberal feminist ideology!
Trump could have easily been a Democrat president!
I'm an Independent who respects and appreciates many liberal AND conservative views. (Yes, we do exist.) That said, no one can blame a conservative for withholding their vote from Donald Trump. He certainly doesn't represent the conservative in me.
He put Alex Acosta in his cabinet knowing Acosta signed the sweetheart deal dershowitz cooked up in an NPA to protect Epstein. Do some research. tRump is a pedo...
Trump could have easily been a Democrat president!
Remember that feeling when the second plane hit the twin towers &amp; we realized America was under attack... I've had that feeling since tRump was elected!
revolutionary trump????? based trump??????
Of course he is, he's Putin's puppet and everyone knows that. Putin tells Trump what to do and we already seen that
Why what's Trump gonna do when he loses?
Fuck Trump
It's not super exciting so far. I'm just down to generally supporting anything or anyone Trump is against.
☝️☝️☝️typical Trump #RexWasRight☝️☝️☝️fuckingMORONassery!!!☝️☝️☝️
Trump lies well because he’s actually a liberal...😂
Fuck Trump
Fuck Trump
I've noticed things are slowing down as far as packages for sure. Does Trump and Company really think we don't understand what is happening and why?
Well now we must save it from Trump.
Wow you are really afraid Trump will lose arent ya?
Im pretty sure there was something just out where Trump said he was more attracted to his daughter than his wife. Just sayin...
Until now, I had zero interest in Tik Tok. If Trump is trying to ban it then I will have to create an account today some time. Fuck Trump !
Banning Tik Tok is a Marxist, Democrat thing. Trump is a closet Democrat, see!
Donald Trump can go fuck himself and give me his son while he is at it because if he doesn't give me his son, he will give me his knee caps AND his son
Can we trade Trump for TikTok?  Very cheap price
Being big Trump fans is like being a Detroit Lions fan. Your team sucks and always has but you love them anyway. You make an acquisition and think it might turn it around but it won't. Your QB might have a 300yd 2 TD game but you still lose 90% of the time.
The 1st is Trump Inc..........
Trump thrives off of that.
Start wearing a knife very visible on your belt. I've been doing it for most of Trump's "Presidency " and it also works well for keeping covidiots away. Stay safe and good luck.
A Trump
it's been almost 4 years and some days I still wake up and have this thought of "oh shit Donald Trump, a reality show host, is really the president of the United States"
How much longer do these Republicans think they can continue to blame China for Trump’s incompetent handling of the U.S. COVID-19 response?   Does Scalise really imagine U.S. falling for “The dog ate my homework,” excuse????????
Is Trump advising Hong Kong election officials???????
You just described Trump.
I mean you can if you're Trump saying it to his idiot followers
Fuck Trump!

Federalist Society co-founder calls Trump's tweet about delaying election "fascistic"
Isn’t trump the one saying that the virus is under control and that it’s perfectly safe to send students and faculty back to school in under a month, yet now we need to postpone the election until it’s safe to go out and vote?
I wonder how many people responding to this tweet in defense of trump would do a 180 on this if a Democrat were in office and everything else was equal.
Of course he is serious, he is also very good at distractions - he has used this tactic his entire term. He has no power to delay the election, that falls on Congress.  GOP congresspersons, even McConnell, are already breaking with Trump on this. It's not going to happen.
Trump supporters are a cult and you can’t convince me otherwise
Is he making this statement to deflect headlines away from that tRump killed Herman Cain at his Tulsa rally?
Trump is a dictator and Biden is a Communist. Thanks America!
I hope you're right, Michael. However, all US Federal Gov. norms, rules and laws have meant nothing for 3.5 years while Trump is in office. Up is down, right is left, night is day. We are in a serious situation. That's why we need great candidates like you. You have my vote.
Usually I like to not mention Trump or give him the time of day, but I'm seeing a lot of people concerned about delaying the election. It has never happened and it never will, not even a civil war delayed the election.  It's just a distraction from the disasterous Q2 GDP numbers.
Unlike the examples I can think of,Trump hasn’t directly attacked the COTUS. He’s only insulted it. No judge/justice has the authority to rewrite the 20th amendment. What you propose isn’t possible. Trump is a crazy mess, not omnipotent.
Herman Cain went to a Trump Rally without a mask...Herman Cain got Covid-19....Herman Cain will not vote in 2020. Wear a mask and you then you will be able to vote. #WearADamnMask
Good ? No elections at all, Congress can’t meet, etc., then President Pro Tempore of the Senate becomes POTUS. Trump/Pence leave on 1/20/21 at noon, regardless.  Martial law of no help 1) legally Congress must first declare national, (never has happened)  2) COTUS not affected
If trump hadn’t held his Oklahoma rally.......
This is automatic, Congress either  1) agrees to a delay/postponement-which makes Pelosi POTUS in January  2) doesn’t, Trump interferes no election- Pelosi is POTUS in January Martial law? Nope a power of Congress too, nationally.  Trump wants U.S. to ignore: Chart NYT 7/30/20
Inhofe says,”..didn’t get the required documentation.” This after our top generals pulled support. In other words, this guy is done: stick a fork in yet another Trump nominee.....
Trump his dipping his toe in the water to see what the national sentiment is to him retaining office beyond his term without reelection. We MUST make it clear we will not even suffer the notion.
Trump should be removed from office today for even suggesting postponing the election this fall.  And if any of our GOP representatives even entertain this idea after their stand during the spring elections, they should be removed, too.
Republicans, now, please, please?
Twitter probably won't do anything so Trump doesn't complain about them
Trump keeps revealing how little he understands U.S. or our Constitution. Only Congress can delay/postpone and election. He should know if Nancy agreed to it, She becomes POTUS 1/20/21 NOON. He should also know if no election Nancy becomes POTUS 1/20/21 NOON... Go for it Donald!
Stop bothering with Trump supporters. It's wasted time and breath.
We understand COVID-19 was a “Black-Swan” event. Coupled with the other BS event-Trump’s EC, election: this IS his fault..... Source: NYT Online, 7/30/20
I don't think Trump has even HEARD of the ConstitutionTurd Squad
My take: I'm not sure it would violate Hatch (because the POTUS is largely exempt from Hatch), but it looks gaudy as all hell. One expects Bill Clinton to pull this move off; which is probably why Trump thinks it's a wonderful idea.
So HUGE.....Trump is replacing obamacare with OBAMACARE.
What leaned today, from Trump’s press conference. 1. Congress is non-essential. 2. Reporters are worthless.                      3. Trump is the greatest president in our nations history.
Trump's weight is reported to be 243 lbs, but id be shocked if he was under 300lbs. Why lie about that dude, its no biggie, youre a big boy. Not like you can hide that fact anyways. Youre too tall and too wide to be sub 300.
That’s total crap, he chose to ignore when he was told how bad this was going to be and then did nothing because he thought it was only hitting Democratic lead states first and so he could blame the governors, this is not “oh well he tired his best” Trump does not give a damn
Ive seen brian kilmeade damn near jizz his pant talking to trump
Really can't wait until I election and to get rid of Trump's once and for all.
Trump would go broke after his opening statement
That is because trump is holding his rallies on federal property paid for by us the tax payers where obama made his speach at a function that he was invited to and  NOT paid for by us tax payers
As we transfer from Meg thee Stallion to Meg Thee Stupid. The headline isn't macabre, because it's true. A second Trump term doesn't affect you. For the rest of it, it's a deeply personal issue. Miss me with this idiocy.
Good job Pelosi. Senate Republicans offered to continue it until the relief bill can be agreed on. She said no. Because they think hurting the people and economy makes Trump look bad. The liberal media laps it up. Just like you are.

Herschel Walker was one of the greatest RB in college history.  He is a right-wing, Trump-loving idiot.  His son is a self-hating Black dude that likes to demean others within his community to pump himself up.  All of the above is true.
ANOTHER TRUMP GAFFE!!!!
Trump is so boring
Trump is merely Putin’s puppet, and Putin will help drag Trump’s bloated corpse across the finish line.  VOTE!!!
Countries across the world that are run by people named Donald Trump are in shambles.
Dear Carl, Trump said he would have a comprehensive Health Care plan two weeks ago.  Did you ALL CAPS that lie!?
Another Trump/Pence FAILURE
Wisconsin votes Trump
when did you turn into supporting Tony Evers masks? The  &amp;  should be railed on daily for going against the base. I will not vote for a dem but I’m not voting at all for in Nov accept for Trump. The rep assembly are no different than Dems
Trump turned the USA into a shithole Country in less than four years.
Trump is BORING
Neither won 50% of the votes, but because Trump edged out ahead by a tiny margin, he won. That's what I'm talking about when less than half picks the winner.
Holy crap. The media would explode if Trump said this!
Check the Trump and Kushner families.
This is exactly why we need to reelect President Trump! #KAG
Trumpers dont care. Unfortunately i shared something like this on fb and was basically attacked by the trump base of people i am "friends" and coworkers with. 🤦‍♂️ this was my reaction every time
This is Trump doings. Con man and crook at work.

RUSSIAN BOUNTIES ON AMERICAN SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN PAID OUT!!!  THAT IS ON TRUMP’S WATCH!!
Gonna be fascinating to find out which of the other Biden Veep choices is dropping this oppo on Karen Bass. Trump's folks or the RNC would be stupid to be dropping this now.
One more rant about TheWrap today...this article.  I didn't know about the Axios interview until AFTER it aired. I don't think anybody did.  And once again TheWrap...HBO is a PREMIUM service. They don't care about the ratings for their news programming!
But again, say the old GOP hats who remain in denial, Trump doesn't have an issue in the suburbs.
Following
The Trump Economy. He likes to put his name on things. He can own this.
Trump hasn’t been right about anything.  Fart sniffer.
God is amazing God has given us the Great Donald Trump
I agree with that, but the Speaker of the House is right behind him now... calling it the “Trump”Virus then she uses the old 3rd grade excuse he said a bad thing first...it’s just  silly...she is right behind the VP in succession...as you can see I’m sick of all politics!
I thought you have a good friend that supports Trump on some things...is he a tool? I think he’s a pretty good kid, although I’m biased 😂😂
You know the Trump-Axios was bad when even the RNC isn’t posting clips of it on their various YouTube channels.
Trump pushes that limit everyday he opens his mouth
Trump is a garbage human.  The GOP could have removed him and they chose not to.  Now we remove them!  VOTE!!
Trump will kill so many innocents.  He is mentally and emotionally incapable of being POTUS.  He has surrounded himself with family members and sycophants.  Tragically, many innocent Americans have and will continue to die as a result of Trump’s criminal incompetence.
God how dumb are all you trumpers just go to the doj web site yes homicides are up in some areas like dc but over all crime is down. Oh sorry i fogot you all do not know how ti looj up facts you just trust everything trump says even thoegh he does nothing but lie
Ari Melber schedules a Trump advisor on and acts angry when the guy starts lying and being a jackass.  Melber is grating.
If you could access my Siri or Alexa history you would find MANY utterances of ‘Trump’ and ‘idiot’.
Much better than trump who stole money from a children's cancer charity.
Did you report that the National Organization of Police endorsed Trump. Over 30,000 strong.
This is what happens when the brains behind Trump Steaks gets his grubby orange hands around a Public Institution. He appoints someone woefully unqualified and squeezes the life out of it.
Yeah you tweeted and wrote about Trump and GOP from day one in 2015, you don’t take a back seat on anyone on educating the public on the topic
I apologize to my children everyday because the Trump stain will last for years.
Remember when Trump tried to send the kids back after Easter?  Same horror show.
He also was the same one encouraged people to take up arms if Trump didn't win in 2016. The man is trash. No change of heart fixes that.
Absolutely they have all ready started the day he got elected. I don’t think they will get away with it though. Trump is smarter than they are. He’s always one step ahead of them. I don’t know what his plan is other than use directive 51 and demand voter ID or something else.
What is your plan?  Trump has NO PLAN.
Absolutely
TRUMP IS BEING REANIMATED! HES COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD!!!! JUST LIKE JESUS!!!!! AMAZIN'
Kodak??? Hmm, does the Trump family have stocks or minority ownership?  I bet somethings not kosher.
Trump asked by interviewers for his favorite Bible verse: that's personal and didn’t give one. Also, wasn’t at funeral.

Hillary Clinton told America about Trump. Yet, petulance prevailed. Bernie was stomped out twice and his followers could not be bothered to help the nominee. Garbage.
He is also a Traitor and a disgrace to all Military past and present. He lied under oath, committed treason yet blames President Trump.
Speaking of Golden calves .....Trump 2020
The NYT lead story was Trump needs to quit because he’s about to get fired. Nothing about Bill Clinton. What a rag. That paper isn’t good enough to be used for cat litter.
Trump has no shame, Trump is a monster
My 8 year old wanted to know “Why is President Trump taking away one of the only fun things to do/watch during Covid?”
It doesn’t matter who Joe Biden picks for VP no one can help him. He’s a failure. He lost twice before and will lose again. Mail in ballots and cheating probably still would not help him either. He’s that bad of a candidate. Trump 2020🇺🇸
Well you have no choice sleepy Joe. He has 49% of the black vote now because you have done nothing for the decades you have been in office but fill your pockets and lie to the people. Go back to sleep. We got this election. Trump 2020!
DeathSantis continues to kill worse than any hurricane could.  DeathSantis chose Trump over our health and safety.  DeathSantis mocked the experts and demanded an apology. I demand that DeathSantis RESIGN!  Blood all over his puffy little Trump hands.
DeathSantis chose Trump over Women and Children.  He chose to side with Trump over Scientists, Doctors, EXPERTS.
He was a master at dissing trump without saying trump’s name.
Why does trump hate TikTok
That picture of the backwoods Trump fans! I won’t post the picture. I’m sure you've seen it.
Trump has blown the national debt to the highest levels EVER. He’s first again. Lol. Now Biden and team will be harassed from Republicans b/c the debt is too high. Same old BS.
You should ask your boy trump that question
Like trump orange or just orange in general?
Now go and do your required Jared and Ivanka puff piece.  I wouldn’t wipe my ass with the NY Times after you sild your souls to Trump and maintaining access to the liar.
who are you and Trump blackmailing?  “Forged”....
Good luck trying to ban TikTok Trump!
Trump - actually cares about this country and its people. #Trump2020
Absolutely
Do not want to hear your trump kissing ass after you let those young men be sexualy abused you should of been banned from congress
If cunt face trump is gonna ban TikTok can we at least get Vine back?
A toddler after he makes a poo poo.. and trump 🤔😄
you better get on top of Trump’s manipulation of the Postal Service.
Ernst is a dog hater.  She also looked the other way when Trump put kids in cages.  Joni is a bad lady, with bad ideas, and is dangerous for the HEALTH of Iowans.
The way Trump is handling this, is so inhumane.  My heart goes out to the teachers and staff that have to make the decision between working and their health. I am making masks and face shields to send to schools, even though my daughter will be doing school online.
Only if Trump wins.
Rep. Waters' foot is on Trump's ass like back pockets and some of y'all are still complaining.
I've never been a   fan but all the rumors about him promising his best friend  he would not let Trump destroy the country at the very least makes me respect the man  quietly  protecting the world from the spoiled brat with nuclear codes
Imagine a kindergarten room out of control with no teacher? Can you see it in your mind yet? Now the parents insisted on  a teacher So atleast now   can throw a toy in the corner for Trump to play with and distract him while they clean up the destroyed classroom.
Lets make an example to help Trump understand ,China has 1 million cases, US 1 million,the US tests all 1 million and China tests 1 person.Are the other 999,999 any less sick in China? Are the 1 million in America  any more sick solely because someone put a q-tip up there nose?
.Tested or not tested sick is sick.People count crazy things all the time like 54,000 times Donald Trump lied on air.Did you lie any less because it was recorded ? NO you probably have lied 500,000 times and those lies still exist whether counted ,testsd,or recorded.
The ammount of testing does not matter bro. The cases are there either way That's crazy I mean it's like saying Trump won the POPULAR  VOTE.Or Russia did not mess with 2016 election, or injecting yourself with disinfectant or paying strippers or lieing to everyone in the world ?
Wow. Rep. Scalise is a real flunkie for Trump.
Yes I am . My pay checks are bigger. Under the previous admin, I got measly 25 cent/hr pay raises. But under Trump I received a totat of $3/hr in pay raises.
Imagine proudly announcing to the world that you are xenophobic...  Oh wait, Trump probably has no idea what ”xenophobic" actually means. LMAO
likely made another donation to Trump after today...
Wow. This was a good read. It was borderline enraging to see that we are still dealing with the same shit almost 30 yrs later. -health care reform -prison reform -ban assault rifles Nothing has changed. 2 steps forward, 2 steps back thanks to GWB and Trump.
So Trump wants to delay the election apparently
All the dipshit republicans will vote in person and it will look like a trump victory, but all the smart Dems will have voted absentee and will take it back. Trump will claim victory on evening of 11/3 before absentees can be counted. I’m terrified.
Then, do your job. Eschew access journalism for actual work. People get tired of disillusioned Trump voter pieces and thinly-veiled coded pieces about Black people. Inform people. Clickbait and nonsense makes the situation worse.
Part of the reason Trump is facing a second term are Berners and third-party dorks. Can't forgive that.  Part of the reason Kamala Harris isn't the nominee are hoteps, Berners, and fake woke asswaffles.  Unforgivable.
Eddie Glaude Marc Lamont Hill Van Jones  The Triumvirate of Trifling were allowed national TV time and platforms to bash HRC, praise Jill Stein and proclaim when Trump became presidential.  There is no rationalizing stupidity.
The funniest thing about the media being played by Trump, are the media complaining about it. Y'all are being played.
Sad the FDA wants more deaths on its hands.  The length that Twitter, FDA, and the left will go, just to try and change the person in the White House is purely disgusting. After Trump wins. I hope he brings back public hangings and punishes those who are trying to kill citizens.
Fauci: social distancing and masks please.  Trump: You’re fires!  Immanuel: sex with demons might help?  Trump: Brilliant! Here’s a raise!Biden apologized for that.  He made an incorrect statement and walked it back.  Trump, on the other hand, during one of his long drawn out gatherings, mentioned  A Man who happened to be black as “my black man”.  It made me so sick at the time.  It exemplified the slave culture.
Agreed! However...I do see a lot of trump supporters in Green Bay...💔
Has anyone heard the one about Trump being an asshole?
#unemployment A payroll tax cut has long been a priority for President Trump, even before the Covid-19 crisis. Trump has said that suspending or eliminating the payroll tax—which is paid by both employers and workers to fund Social Security and Medicare
why do people keep comparing trump and biden? let them be their own people, no need to compare people💞💫
Isn’t Biden pro abortion...Nuf said. Trump 2020!
Everyone has to make there on choice but for me personally Biden has my vote no matter who he chooses. I trust him to make a sensible decision. And if he chooses Susan Rice or someone else who I may not be keen on they will certainly be better than another 4 yrs of trump/pence.
Kinda like when Bill Maher said he wanted the economy to crash so that Trump wouldn't be elected?  Imagine what they don't admit to you.
More bull shit from Quid Pro Sleeoy Joe Hiden Biden.  DemocRATs are ruining the economy &amp; are trying to blame Trump.  Us real Americans are not as stupid as the libtards.  The silent majority will awaken in November!

He's actually been Vice President. And more successful than Donald Trump was as President.
You're the kind of Liberal I miss.  One I could have great conversation with and actually disagree with on just a few things and we'd both still end up liking each other's company.  You are a dying breed, which is why Trump will probably win again.
I can't believe there's a single person on the face of the earth who believes Trump believes in God with his upside down and backwards Bible.
Is there any reason to vote for Trump,  ? In what universe is that a good outcome?  The shame alone will probably wreck the Republican Party, by the time we get to January. #PresidentPelosi Or maybe VP Pelosi? After the “White House Event” happens she will be Prez anyway.
Said it before, I'm going to keep saying, we're not going to make it to November, save for assassination the left has tried EVERYTHING to get rid of Trump, they know they can't do it cuz it validates him and the right, but I think they're going to try soon.
"Joe Biden would hurt GOD" communicated by nutcase Trump &amp; accepted by Trump's Evangelists for their god/666...Trump feeds the devil whores with falsehoods!
you are worth 50 million dollars- the media kisses your ass- celebrities love you &amp; half the sheep in this country worship you. What the fuck could you be depressed about?
NRA pay for trump's mug/body on flags holding M-60 Machine Gun? Other anarchists flags of dark stars &amp; stripes, confederate &amp; nazi?  Pay for "brown shirts' against Jews Catholics, Blacks, Native Americans with NRA badges not counting militias from former Black Water mercenaries?
Dear Diary, "Trump is attacking Biden again. ..make him stop!" ...... 😂😂😂😂😂🤣
Acosta was acting as the AG for Florida. Obama has no say over that case. Trump appointed Barr and Acosta to his cabinet
The Americans  would get 600.00 a week until January but Republicans want there own bill 200.00 a week and trump using the money FBI building  to remodel so no o e can buy it .Trump does not want a hotel next to his hotel
You can't be proud, and support trump at the same time.
This happened on trump's watch. What's he going to do about it?
Anti-Semitic, amazing, are you Jewish? If not, by what right do you judge? I am, remember how you blacks love to tell us we can't judge your claims of racism, now it is time for you to practice what you preach. Further, Trump, unlike Obama, did not work to stab Israel in the back
Me too! Just shut up, don't talk and let Trump burn.  Besides, I guarantee there's a bunch of people rn saying "Really?" Joe isn't the only one.

Chris Wallace you are so wrong!  First off,  if or when you get Joe for an interview you will not drill down on Joe like you did to President Trump.  Joe could hardly manage the debates!
Trump Supporter are over weight 😂😂 and our Women are just plain HOTTER! 🔥🔥
“It appears that policy people have been intervening in fact-checks on behalf of *exclusively* right-wing publishers, to avoid them getting repeat-offender status.”
you haven’t said I was wrong only referenced president Trump which tells me you agree but don’t wanna admit it
Most challenging job in America? Perhaps being the people for Biden and Trump who have to explain what the candidate really meant.
"no religion... no anything...hurt the bible, hurt god... he's against god..." -    Joe Biden is a dedicated practicing Catholic.  Donald Trump is a liar.
It’s not rocket surgery. If being pro-Clown birthday parties garnered Trump the support, he’d gladly DON the red ball.
Didn't Trump offer up money for anyone who turns in foreign energies trying to interfere with our elections... Is someone getting a payday or is he only doing that if it's helping Biden?
The thing is...  he basically exposed the GOP for the terrible people they are, and they will never regain their credibility after Trump.  The GOP sacrificed their values, and America will never forget it.
Copy and paste to Trump's account next.
People won't elect a demented president,Joe. Bow out gracefully. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Bow out now before the convention or DEBATE TRUMP is what I'm hoping for. I'll never vote dem again either way.

This is MASSIVE and absolutely deserves hoopla.  Trump is not the only corrupt person in the U.S. that needs to be held accountable, and the American people deserve to hear why/have attn drawn to it.
I have been so angry with Trump and I've been really focused on getting rid of him. Then I read the responses to this post and I'm reminded that there are are so many sweet, kind, loving people in this crazy fractured country. Let your kindness shine, we will win.
Their parents feel that wearing a mask shows disloyalty to trump and teach that to their kids.  The kids who do wear masks get picked on by other kids so they are likely to take them off to fit in.

If you read the article she stated that she will NOT vote for trump. As far as Biden she’s waiting to see who he picks as his VP. So she hasn’t ruled out voting for Biden.

Deaths per million is right on pace with Europe. It’s unfortunate, but history will rather judge trump on his role in crashing the dollar with all this stimulus, bailing out companies, etc

Report: Twitter bans Trump campaign from tweeting over COVID misinformation
Oh, Charlie. Magical thinking won’t work this time. Everyone knows who Trump is now. None of these polls show what you fantasize and claim.
different we all still have commonalities. We're all human. We all have emotion. We all hurt and we all (well most of us) loathe the hell outta Trump.
Trump's plan is not to give states any mandated guidance or funds to operate the schools safely and when it becomes a disaster he'll cherry pick Democratic cities or states and blame them for doing a poor job reopening the schools. He's essentially setting them/us up to fail.
The first time since Darrell Hammond that I have laughed at a Trump impression.
He stopped threatening Guam months before meeting trump. Because they finished testing.
I don’t often agree with trump, but the deaths per million are on par with leading countries of the world. It’s a virus and a small proportion of the population will die. That’s life. To blame him is just political and short-sighted of reality
LOLOL. The irony is WHITE WOMEN PUT DONALD TRUMP INTO POWER. So all the white women bitching and moaning need to go fight them and stop blaming some mystical force. Fight them or put yourself in front of the gunfire and be the leader. Otherwise shut up.
Trump related??
THIS! THIS is a large part of why we love President Trump!
I wont spend my money at a business that requires it. Im to far invested to go over. Dude in a Trump hat gave me a thumbs up at Fleet Farm today.

Hey is that Donald Trump?
Yes. I remember.
Trump had people checking him early on. He didn't get Barr until year 3. And RBG, sad to say, I have a hard time seeing her not needing to be replaced on the SCOTUS in the next 4 years given all her health issues and age, which swings it massively to conservatives.
I think this is the most important election of my life and maybe for American history. We're going to slip into an authoritarian state if we have to suffer for more years of Trump.
There's a lot of good faith items that people assumed would be done that Trump isn't following because our founding fathers assumed we wouldn't elect a steaming pile of shit, but there are certain things spelled out very directly and one of those is when a President's term ends.
I know if feels like Trump is breaking all kind of laws but he's still operating within what the constitution allows. The GOP isn't removing him from office, but they can't stop Democrats from impeaching for example. His term is done Jan 20th per the constitution.
He'd have to win by massive margins for that and the polling doesn't support that in any way. If Trump were to win, he's barely winning like he did in 2016.
My bigger concern is the things Trump is doing to attack the post office to prevent / slow down mail in voting and foreign interference which I don't think has in any way been adequately addressed. Its things that would lead to Trump winning the vote.
We don't know that an election will be corrupted. The GOP took a bath in the 2018 election. I think voting Trump out is far more advisable than a coup. If you did that, you're all but inviting a civil war.
Is trump this smart though? Who's the real mastermind here?
admittedly has a propensity to mangle his words, but it's amusing that whatever "sin" he's ever accused of doing, Trump objectively does 10x+ worse. The performative outrage directed Biden's way when the comparative is Trump is amusing.
Just your average evangelical who now needs to ask you for money so he can tell you how not to stain your life with adulterous affairs.  Oh, and he is a major Trump supporter...swine do act alike...
Simply false. LOL.  Biden has articulated a solid vision for the country. And the economy *always* performs better under Democrats. Always.   More importantly, it's literally not possible to bungle the pandemic response worse than Trump has.
Axios unquestioning accepted the claim that Biden wrote the explanatory tweets. No way in hell did that happen.  If by some miracle a debate ever happened, I'd love Trump to challenge Joe.."Joe! Pull out your phone and put up a tweet. If you can do it, I'll drop out of the race!"

All I know is that it’s been all over our news that Kanye submitted ppw to get on our ballot. He is working with the Trump campaign to attempt to get black and young voters to vote for him instead of Biden. So shady!
I remember telling people a few months back that Trump’s best chance for re-election was to try and campaign on being tough on China. It really should be a bipartisan issue.
He didn’t want to have to meet up with Trump.

Good folks in Ohio. Thing is, even though it's pretty secure, Trump will likely visit there anyway, cause he wants to talk to lots of folks, and enjoys being around hard-working people. Covid sucks, Sir. But don't lose faith. We won't.

Devout catholic Biden would wipe the floor with trump on a debate about scripture. Would be laughable.
At least other Republicans act more genuine language when they pander to evangelicals for votes. With Trump, when he looked at the GOP playbook for how to use christianity to pander to people in the flyover states, the best he could do was, "HE HURT GOD". #unfrozencavemanlawyer

I’d say even the fleeting chance that Trump’s stooge sabotages USPS vote-by-Mail is all the reason needed to push people to vote as soon as humanly possible, or learn how to best show up in person *safely* to vote.   He’ll do anything to win, which is why he needs to lose. Hard.
Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio, I know Repub.Reps are Trump CRONIES, but how dare you act concerned for Covid to your type of law enforcers blasting into Portland! If your worried &amp; insist on sending them-give them a MASK! Such B.S. you now have your own Reps. positive &amp; 1 die of Covid
If Wisconsin Republicans remove the mask mandate, they prove not only inaction but full offense towards any mitigating public health actions towards COVID.   They would prove that no Republican has WI interests in mind, and that no WI resident has any reason to vote GOP/Trump.
More Than Just a Tweet: Trump’s Campaign to Undercut Democracy
Herman Cain should’ve never been there, just a piece of advice for y’all shuckin and jivin trump supporters
Should have said it was blood as part of your Trump loyalist impersonation
I blame Trump for ignoring this and then minimizing......more "Let them eat Cake"....US is more and more resembling Poe's "The Masque of the Red Death"
#Trump logic.  I should probably also say #Republican logic too. #DumpTrump #RepublicansForBiden
So is  being divisive &amp; political, basically trump bashing part of this Christian forgiveness?
Even Lindsay Graham, one of Trump's biggest butt puppets, told reporters that he thinks this is a bad idea.
At least this one has the benefit that it would require an awful lot of election officials and clerks and whatnot all across the country playing along, compared to just like not punishing Trump Co. for money laundering or whatever
What is Trump's intent with a loyal militia in military outfits, nearly 10,000 in number? Protests witnessed these "soldiers" violate the constitutional &amp; international rights of citizens and torture them in plane view of others. Are they even authorized by Congress, as legit?
For people who are comfortable with grocery shopping, etc., I'd also suggest early voting or if you get an absentee ballot, dropping it off to a drop box. trump really is sabotaging the system to delay the results.
"...hours before Trump complained about mail ballots in Michigan, the GOP’s regional field director advertised...  “Mail in Ballot Deadline is Coming! Make sure you apply by May 26th at  so you can vote by mail for [trump]!”
Takes an act of Congress to cancel/delay the election. If for some reason it is delayed a Trump still has to be out at 12:01 on Jan 20th and Pelosi becomes Prez until a new election is held. The only way Trump stays is if he’s voted in.
Speak up if you want law and order. Democrats support the looting of formerly great American Cities. Why haven’t the Dem Mayors stopped the violence?    Biden is an enabler not a solution.
Democrats DONT CARE. Why aren’t they working?  Biden promises will make you poor again. More taxes ok with you?  A failed stock market due to a Biden victory will destroy your small business opportunities; you will be broke and obliged to Government regulations. Vote Trump in!
• “Biden doesn’t even know where he is half the time.” • “Trump built the greatest economy in the world until this stupid virus.” • “Millennials are so entitled. They want free everything.” • “It’s all the women and young people that hate Trump.”  Quotes from the SW MKE burbs

What Does Joe Biden’s Choice Of Kamala Harris For VP Mean For Wisconsin?
EXTREMELY BIDEN 2020. Pitch perfect for Dems too.
No she won't.  Americans don't like her, the African American community does not like her, even Biden doesn't like her.   She can only run on her lies for so long.
The fact that republicans like Kamala Harris even more than they like Joe Biden is quite worrisome
Is it Coma, or Camilla or Kamala? Biden just pronounced her name 3 or 4 different ways.  Does he know her name?
Camel Harris will be the new President of the United States because Biden will never last!  Oh - and everything is Trump’s fault.
Once a liar always a liar....lookout here comes Biden/Harris

Most women, and more than a quarter of the black people I know were on the fence. Most have jumped to Trump, and some are still on the fence. No new people are supporting Biden now.
This will be interesting. All Trump supporters I know are excited by the Kamala pick. Her past and her hypocrisy will be highlighted. I was genuinely surprised to see the support. It is an uphill battle now for Biden.
As a conservative roaming in the wilderness and looking for a reason to vote Biden, Duckworth ain’t it.  Don’t like her and can’t explain why.
“It’s definitely the norm, but Mike Pence brought in his own team.”  That’s your example of how Biden assembling a team is a bad thing. Click bait

Does anybody have any idea when VP Biden is going to announce his running mate ? He said the first week in August. Well it’s Saturday. I’m beginning not to care anymore. What’s his new date ? Halloween ? I’m hoping for Susan Rice. She brings it all. He worked with her for 8 years
Can’t wait for the, “that’s not Biden” lunatic fringe take.Strange how you're only interested in this after Biden is running for election.  You didn't care about this in 2016.

Yeah! What do you have to say to that Mr Figment of Eric’s Imagination Biden?!
Biden and Harris better skip. It will rust from their tears.
Is there folks that are going to vote for Biden? Not 75% probably not 25% but it answers your question a little anyway. Definitely there are morons out there 🤪
Something I'm noticing about this election is most of the Republicans I know are like "YEAAAAAAAH We're gonna vote for TRUMP! GO TRUMP!" and most of my liberal friends (note, not Democrat... liberal) are like "Oh God, do I really have to vote for Biden? Really?"
A virus created in China destroyed the economy that Trump had built. Obama and Biden‘s job killing regulations and taxes were destroying this country. Democrats are a cancer that need to be removed

Yeah, we were going to win this no matter what which is why Biden was such a stupid choice.

Biden spearheaded the Brady bill, the single most influential piece of gun legislation that has passed through the senate. Pete supports common sense gun laws and legalization of cannabis. Bidens stance on Marijuana is not something that will last, but that is just my opinion.
Reaction to Biden picking Harris as running mate
Experts expected Biden to choose Harris who brings a wealth of experience.
Biden, 77, pitched his former primary rival as a smart, tenacious figure who will help him defeat Trump in November. The 55-year-old Harris is making history as the first black woman on a national major party ticket.
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
It’s mystifying to Trump that Joe Biden could have someone criticize him harshly in a debate and *gasp* get over it!
It feels like scorched earth to me. If they’re going have to turn over the keys to Biden/Harris in January, might as well just burn the house down!
Tonight at 6, I spoke with both Democrats and Republicans on Joe Biden's choice in Kamala Harris. Hear from  and  That plus some political analysis from UW-La Crosse Political Science Professor Tim Dale.
If you hack/cheat in video games you are probably the same people that will vote for Biden 🤦‍♂️ #hatetoseeit
is great pick by  She is smart, strong, and ready for leadership. But what's most impressive by this decision is that Joe Biden is demonstrating that he isn't afraid to run towards criticism.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
So a day after Biden picks his VP we're all just gonna a start shitting on them as much we do about Trump? Is this not counter productive? The goal is to remove Trump. Please don't convince people to vote for him... Like yeah, JB/KH are shitty, 45 is worse. Now I'm nervous 😬😬😬
why would you support a predator like biden?
The La Crosse Dems hope to have Biden/Harris signs very soon. Stay tuned!!!

Literally just had a brain melting conversation where the other person really had the audacity to call Joe Biden the radical left. He is nothing more than a anti-gun republican running as a dem. He will be equally as evil and on top of that he’s promised to take your guns first.
Bernie isn't on the ballot silly.  Biden and Harris are neoliberals.  You would be better off using that as an attack
I mean no doubt Biden is bad, and racist indeed... but like, rich of Trump to accuse Biden of having a racism problem.
Also, I love how I got to listen to someone close to me call someone online a fa***t, but yet I'M the problematic one for not living Kamala Harris and Biden, neither of whom have done nothing wrong ever.
Make no mistake. Harris was choosen months ago. Her delayed announcement was to keep a dementia riddled Biden out of the lime light. He will be a complete puppet of the DNC. He will push their national agenda to disarm POC to &amp; continue buying elections for the DNC on the basis,
LOL No. He won't and shouldn't. The choice in November is America or Trump and that's why Biden will win by a lot.
“I was a little surprised that he picked her,” President Donald Trump said during a press conference at the White House. “She did very, very poorly in the primaries.”
Well I’d say if you’re the one wearing the mask there’d be absolutely no problem. Now Biden’s vp pick eh mask be a good addition to her make up routine. Big mask

No one is perfect.But, any of the people on  s VP list, who happen to be women, have far more integrity and experience than t rump period.   WILL be the history makin VP. Biden/Harris will lead us to a better place. Then she can pick a Latina VP next time.

What is the game plan if you’re not voting for Biden? Like I get having the moral high ground is nice and all, but what is the second option here?
Biden’s attempt to pander to everyone is a sure case of self destruction if you ask me. Now he’s going after the diehard democrats who he needs to get any votes. He’s estranged every other group of American people there is.
He’s headed for the ditch on the wrong side of the road. So he can get his pic took. In a dumb fuckin face mask. And there are actually people who would elect him? For anything? Ok then. I will vote for Biden to be hall monitor at nursing home.
He’s the best of the best democrat. That’s it. That’s all the have. And from an outsider looking in at the Democratic Party, they’re probably right. They have nobody nothing else, anywhere.The likes of Nadler Pelosi Schumer Biden and many others have made sure of that. THEY STINK

As we grow up and learn new things and new attitudes we become better people. So I really don’t care about the things in Biden’s past that he has changed as he got older. I will vote for him because of the ways he acts and thinks now. He has my vote.

The hilarious thing was Biden mispronounced her name the same day that Tucker Carlson was getting shit on for doing that.
"Under Biden, the velvet blacklight poster industry would receive full Federal funding."
Biden comes running into the first debate, juggling three balls, says "My these are big balls", drops them, grabs two bottles of water, drinks them both, says "look, one in each hand, easy", takes His place at the podium, looks at Donald and says, "whatcha got for that BITCH!?"
The haymaker Colbert lands here is 1000 times heavier than anything Harris landed on Biden in that debate. It charts on a seismograph.
Looks like Democrats and Republicans like keeping us in a state medical-financial fear.   Remember, Biden has vowed to veto #MedicareForAll if given the chance.

In the Trump administration, the meeting would be to also nominate the guy to the State Department. So, no, it doesn’t seem odd for Biden to have met with someone. You’re not fooling people with these smears that don’t indicate any wrongdoing.
None of this is evidence of wrongdoing by Biden. None of it. So, I think you’re engaging in a disgraceful smear campaign of innuendo for partisan gain — an unethical use of your office, the purpose of which is to represent Wisconsin voters like me.
Why are you investigating something that happened 6 years ago? If it’s corrupt, why is it only important since Biden has talked about running agst Orange Leader?
so yeah, i'm in the position where i'm voting for Biden who has made it very clear he is my enemy. not to "reduce harm" - people have been saying that for years, against reagan, nixon, bush - but because i think trump either leaves office january 2021 or upon his death

Understand your point. But I think  1) He's lost some supporters over the past 4 years 2) Biden is far from perfect but he's not as polarizing as Hillary  3) Lots of young people who ordinarily wouldn't bother to vote, WILL this time.
This same union endorsed Clinton 4 years ago.  I’m totally fine stopping all public sector unions from being able to endorse and donate to candidates but you cannot pick and choose.  Either they all can or none of them can.  By the way Biden will in NY by at least 16 points 🤷‍♂️

Biden’s big day: $10.8 million pours into ActBlue in four hours after V.P. announcement.
Joe Biden came out and asserted we should wear masks for the next 3 months saying it could “save 40,000 lives.”  Does anyone else find it odd that he would only say 3 months? Why not forever?  It’s almost as if he thinks it’s necessary to wear masks only until after the election.

The evidence is there.  They got their mail-in voting all across the country because of this covid thing and the mail service to throw the monkey wrench in so they can literally hand the election to Biden.  Trump will NOT be president January 2021, they're totally going to cheat.

This is how intelligent and coherent I imagine every Trump and Biden interview.
I don't think they are going to need to steal it. Biden has Alzheimer's &amp; even the progressive left doesn't like Harris. USPS failings are because of COVID, and the fact they have less business now than in 1985. Maybe you should get your facts before you make stupid comments.
No questions for #SenileJoeBiden! No questions at all, as Trump takes them daily, plummeted by them, about everything. Biden can't answer unscripted questions. If you vote for Biden, you are voting for Harris, the most fake politician in history as President. No way!
I think I'll buy a joe Biden hat!
I'm from Wisconsin but I can't vote for Biden. I'm voting Green.
Harris def. did some of that, and Biden definitely did a LOT more.  "Not Trump" is...something, but IF they win, THEN what do we have? No one who stands for much of anything pro-people at all.  What kind of democracy is it where candidates offer nothing yet auto-expect our votes?
They’re 100% stuffed with mail in ballots via why Blumph is having them removed by his evil henchmen !!! #Resistance is futile. Biden Harris 2020 Landslide is gonna happen whether Blumph likes it or not !!!

Joe "Nothing Will Fundamentally Change" Biden doesn't have my trust.
It does matter. I just don't think Biden and Harris truly care. Harris's past and Biden picking her is proof of that.
The election is already over Biden Harris Landslide is all we’re gonna see. It’ll be a big blue wave and the new Leaders will save us all with totalitarian communism !!!
I mean, standing up for what is right and fair for all is what matters.   If enough of us did that, we'd never have another Trump or Biden or Clinton or Obama or Bush again.
Your boy biden dodges All questions.
Biden Harris already won no need to even bother it’s gonna be a landslide. Blumph is finished this time for sure !!!

the media is losing their SHIT abt being able to fetishize obama and biden again and frankly im SICK! of it
There is truth to what you say, and if Biden were running against a Mccain or a Romney, I'd probably vote 3rd party, but Trump is crazy unhinged.
Sure, but to conflate the two is just...I don't even know. I am NOT a fan of Biden, but Trump is an enabler of extremism.  He needs to go.

Biden opposes vouchers, but experts say the president wouldn't have the authority to halt a program authorized and funded by the state.

I chose to interpret it as a gratuitious Biden-Harris endorsement.
You really think that? I'm not as confident in Biden winning as some are, but I can't really see this being a Trump landslide.

My guess is an anarchist that supports Biden this election to kick out Trump
2020 Pres Candidates as NFL QBs   Biden: Ryan Fitzpatrick. Old White placeholder who hasn’t done much in terms of success  Harris: Tua Tagovailoa. Young potential non-white  “superstar” in waiting  Trump: Roethlisberger. Repulsive, rapey, but has a few W’s.   Pence: Jake Fromm
No, Joe Biden can't ban school choice vouchers in Wisconsin (though he's strongly against them). We rate this claim False, after a quick stopover to examine the pseudo-news site spreading this claim.
Certainly seems like Biden will likely lose

It's remarkable, and  just nodded and gleefully invited the nitwit back.  I mean, really. What possibly could a voter "learn" about Biden now and actually say, "Yeah, Trump has flaws, but NOTHING like that!" ????  Do better, CNN.  #TrumpFailedAmerica
I’m guessing that the people who think I can be shamed into voting for Biden have never purchased a fucking Groupon for dental care. Sorry motherfuckers but I have no shame left!
So this "chicken or shit&amp;glass" analogy is the newest way libs are dismissing criticisms of Biden as ludicrously petty.  But it ignores that badly cooked chicken can kill you &amp; it ignores what critics are actually saying - the chicken is stuffed w/ shit&amp; glass.
If we couldn’t push Obama to the left what makes you all think Biden/ Harris will 🤷🏻‍♀️

Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris - CNN  via
Your role in this is to vote &amp; to engage others--not the Trumpsters who are too far gone but all the people who think Kamala isn't sufficiently progressive or Biden isn't Bernie or voting is a hassle. Stop trying to win over Trump fans &amp; start working on the passive &amp; undecided.
The appeal to "suburban housewives," the threat that Biden will "hurt God," the promise that "Christianity will have power"--Trump is publicly manipulating religion, fear, and racism. Meanwhile, we're joking about how he pronounces Yosemite or how much orange makeup he's wearing.
I just heard a pundit on CNN say that the big gap in the polls right now is because voters don't know enough about Biden.  Do these crackpots listen to themselves? By what barometer will Biden -- a two-term VP, by the way -- lose support to Trump over the next 10 weeks?
The ads on TV for Trump and against Biden are disgusting. Truly disgusting.
point on  about Joe Biden's MAGA POV is so relevant. When I saw him speak in MKE I was surprised and disappointed by Biden's Americentric, patriotism/nationalism.
Also, I think  is at the point in listenership and subscribers where they can afford to edit in the actual clip of Joe Biden asking if his interviewers are junkies or at least play it off your phoneNo. Biden can do what he wants...DJT follows zero rules.  Greta, we know you are a Trumper, why make it so obvious?  Still have mailboxes? KANYE?   Some of us want a non-corrupt future POTUS.   He JUST complained about Biden and no questions, you are just echoing what HE wants.
Biden tell us to wear mask. Dude should practice what he preaches.  It's ok to kiss kali moms tried lips he wanted to hugs get a little dam pervert. They blocked him with not opening thier arms to him. He had to touch kiss. He needs a test . Or quit
Biden picking Kamala. Is a DESPERATE MOVE
It sounds like you’ve had Biden on “top secret probation”. Benghazi all over again.  Six years of investigation resulting in nothing.  Republican credibility is in the toilet and will be for years. Keep kissing Trumps ass you’ll go far.
Some ass signed me up for every Biden email in existence
You know Obama and Biden have done that too...
So Obama blamed all issues on Bush and claims all of Trump's successes are because of him. Biden learned from the best...or someone did. He ain't learning nothing.
Great deal by Obama and Biden.

Oh the delusion. Can you back that up? Trump spoke unscripted for several hours and Biden can’t read a teleprompter
I chose D. I don't like Biden At. All. But I'm viewing him as the tourniquet - he won't solve any of the underlying problems, but he'll hopefully stop the bleeding long enough that we can take a deep breath and get started on the surgery.
Yeah I think Biden is a doofus too ;^)

If it’s too dangerous due to COVID19 to host an in-person DNC in Milwaukee, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris should probably stop parading around in public on the East Coast. We’re losing millions of dollars because he didn’t come to accept the nomination here.

i am what would be considered far left but i do mot give a fuck who Biden vp is all i need is not orange shit
If you were saying ACAB last month but support Kamala Harris as Biden’s VP pick you don’t really believe that all cops are bad🥴
Well hopefully in Nov you can help take care of this and the MANY other problems left from the current administration that you &amp; Biden will have to deal with!  Congratulations &amp; Biden made a great choice!!
So Biden (who I would argue is a cop, because of the 94 crime bill) picked Kamala Harris, ANOTHER COP  so our choices are Trump pence (authoritarian dictatorship) or TWO COPS.   Fuck america

Excellent choice in Harris for Biden. She'll make a great VP when sworn in next January.
Excellent choice. Historic choice. America's choice. Could not be happier.
Wait til the debates! When Biden has to speak out of his basement! People will realize he's got dementia! Can you say Trump Relected! If he's such a strong candidate, why has he not left his basement?
Yeah I'll suck it up and vote Biden in my swing state to stop the bleeding. But what we all should focus on is downballot - elect enough progressives that we can put M4A on Biden's desk and call his goddamn bluff.

Biden wants to redirect funding. This is less extreme than abolishing the police. Police are over funded and have been given too much power. If we redirect some (not all) resources towards community programs, we can improve communities instead of over policing them.
He’ll never do it.  For the same reason Biden will never be allowed to debate Trump.
I think I’m sane, but will NOT be voting for Biden. Can’t vote for anyone that supports abortions.
Joe Biden trying to distance himself from his record while trying to run on his record will be the most Joe Biden thing in the history of Joe Biden 😆
Based on Biden’s latest series of TV ads, does Obama know that from 2008-2016, Joe was actually POTUS, Commander in Chief, head honcho, the big cheese, etc., and not him?
This is LITERALLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VOTING TRUMP AND BIDEN FOR ME
Of what benefit would a debate be for Joe Biden. There is no upside.I’m not a Trump fan but It’s laughable that you believe the stifling restrictions put in place by Obama/Biden would equal economic prosperity.  Google “don’t be a dumbass”...then follow the instructions on not being a dumbass.
when Biden talks he screws up
O’Reilly?  The only way you Trump/Putin types have a chance of winning is if enough Sanders folks stay home because they are not thinking clearly.  They think that there isn’t a dimes worth of difference between Trump/Putin and Biden/Harris.  Thanks for waking them up!
driving around the cabin last weekend and I saw SO MANY T/P signs. It was sickening. Only two Biden signs the entire drive home. This weekend I drove into town and was so happy to see all the Biden signs! I wanted to knock and thank them for not being racist!
Biden will when he’s president!
Best case scenario is Biden doing two terms. We need a break from dem presidential primaries
Love Joe Biden and Kamala Harris👍
. OK, I get it,  has a tough re-election race, so he handed you the Trump Defender/Apologist/Attack Surrogate title. You are misusing Homeland Security Comm to throw mud and lies at Biden and his family, all to promote Trump’s re-election. Sad. #VOTE
If biden wins he will appoint obama to supreme court that alone we need trump reelected and win congress and senate wake up Republicans, independent.and democrats who aren't for this far left bullshit..TRUMP 2020
This is great. How can people be so blind? Common sense needs to prevail.... oh wait some of us can’t admit we are wrong - seriously - how do people justify following Biden

Bernie endorsed Biden enthusiastically
I mean, it would appear she's doing a pretty good job with Biden's campaign.
How is it that he can say in public to Americans...I'm not going to ALLOW mail in voting.  I'm not going to wait to have them counted and Biden isn't winning. I'm having a the mailboxes removed....WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY PUTTING THEM?  HE IS SO FAR GONE THAT HE THINKS ITS OKAY?!?
Trump will be coming to Oshkosh to speak in person and Biden will hold an online conference. Please, for the love of God do not take this as a sign of weakness on Biden‘s part! There’s a pandemic and he’s doing his part to keep you and himself safe.
Let’s just say in a magical world everyone’s vote manages to gets to the proper places. Will enough votes be counted to declare Biden the winner. Don’t think trump doesn’t have a plan for votes recieved.
Every single Bernie supporter I know is voting for Biden 🤷‍♂️
Take note that the Democrat Biden-Harris duo's solutions to the "Rona" all involve mandating, to wit forcing the fiefs in the fiefdom, to do something or else. That's their way.
It would kind of be funny though if he had to be physically removed. Or if him and Biden get into a fist fight.
Lol you do realize Biden isn't president yet and hasn't implemented any rules?
And obviously a lot of that’s down to Biden’s weakness as a candidate but THIS IS HOW YOU DO CROSSGENERATIONAL APPEAL. Not babbling about your car for a solid minute to an audience of boomer dads who haven’t voted Dem in over a decade and then adding an aside about electric cars
I would like Mr Pres. not to mention Biden/Harris at all, act as if they don't exists. Dont plant their names in the citizens ears. Talk about leading the country forward, rebuilding the economy, taking a stand on police reform and support, ending anarchy and Covid. MAGA!
Trump is trying to rig the election by taking away a method of voting he believes will help Biden. We have voted by mail in Wisconsin for a long time. It is fair, and it allows Americans to choose who governs them. It terrifies Trump because knows he will lose if we #VoteByMail
A player with COVID was on the Homestead Golf Course earlier this month... Joe Biden says we should all wear masks for 30 months... a peace agreement between Israel and the UAE... in today's WSAU news podcast with Chris Conley.

Biden &amp; Harris today?, thought it was one of the best speeches I've ever heard from Biden. Having Kamala on the ticket just boosted it ten fold!
That first screen grab is from Nov 2018 in the primary (fair enough). The latter is from this week in his thread supporting Biden/Harris.

Biden and Harris aren't my first choice, but do rank one above my last choice. Unfortunately, they leave us in the same situation that gave us Trump.
Excellent news for rural WI Biden voters!  endorsement is now a VP candidate endorsement for our local candidate for WI congressional district 7  🇺🇸 #WIforBiden
Mr. Biden is a baptized Catholic.
Biden did an awesome in picking his field of potential. Saw no one did not like.
like, she herself just ethered Biden mere months ago and look who kicked her ass
I for one, think the irony is just a bit that funny 45 has a campaign ad calling Biden racist as he’s using fancy terms to be racist in his last tweet
Every day, Biden and Harris should do video where they just point at him and laugh. That would make my day.   Video of him saying his usual stupid stuff. Followed with transition pointing and laughing.  The stupid is so strong in him.  No hash/tags or images in comments.
BfH on the ticket  Big f hammer  Biden harris  No hash/tags or images in comments. They annoy the crap out of me.
i haven’t been able to sleep at all and i’m fucking pissed about biden choosing kamala america is really like “oh the pres sucks? let’s pick someone who sucks a little less rather than someone who DOESNT SUCK”
i’m never going to forgive anyone for voting for fucking joe biden in the primaries how fucking stupid do you have to be
fuck joe biden and fuck kamala harris.
Reaction to Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate... a Marquette poll says Biden leads in Wisconsin 49-44... the Big Ten delays the football season until the spring... in today's WSAU news podcast with Chris Conley
She won my vote with a glimpse of Senate hearing. Her questioning was excellent. Made up my mind at once that I would never be cross examined by her. Kamala Harris' balancing act
Any vote not for Biden/Kamala is a vote for trump :/
Harris don't be alone with biden he likes boobs and hugging girls and woman  and your going to campaign with him ?
If biden steps down harris takes president isn't speaker of house vp automatically so harris don't get to pick !!!!!!
The only reason biden picked a black woman as vp is for black vote but it's con.he don't care about blacks he's a racists .but he'll drop out she'll take over as president but then pelosi we'll be vp..it crazy and dangerous for true americans  please think before voting for kids
Joe Biden has more brains than you do.  Face it, he’d make a better president too.
I’m attending WI 2020 Victory’s event, “WI AAPIs for Biden Launch with Congresswoman Grace Meng” – sign up now to join me!
TBH I wasn't 2excited 2have Joe Biden for Prez. I'd vote for him simply bcoz any1 other than DT is better already. But the choice of  as VP does it for me! It shows Biden's character. Despite Harris being tough on him, he chose her! Hats off to JB!
Is it wrong, silly or presumptuous to instead of calling Biden Vice President, to call him Next President?
Well over 40 Million will vote for Trump this year.  The ones that want to destroy the environment, health care or part of his crime cartel know he is a fraud.  But millions of them are so gullible.  Amazing!
. outstanding choice! 👏👏👏👏 Thank you  Biden-Harris is a very strong team! Peddle to the metal for 84 days now.   #VOTE

Hey Kat - you’re already spreading lies about Kamala Harris.  She NEVER called Joe Biden a racist.  #GOPComplicitTraitors
The pick has been made:
Like I said long time ago.  Biden would have black woman for the black vote only. Don't believe him he could care less about blacks .don't vote for him just to see .he'll make black miserable along with you !!!!
Remeber when kamala talked nothing but shit on joe biden her entire campaignthen back tracked like fucking hansel and gretel on that bitch reallllllll fast
We're following a lot of developing stories tonight on  :  🔵Today is the Partisan Primary here in Wisconsin  🔵The BIG 10 announced they are canceling football this season 🔵Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate for the Nov. election.
Harris is a better VP pick than Lieberman, Edwards, Biden, or Kaine.

Breaking News from Joe Biden!
So did Biden Drop the Bass?
I’m already outraged at Biden’s choice of running mate.
Really?! Trump just said Biden was insulting men by choosing a woman as his runningmate.
Miss us yet?! We are prepping to record the next episodes about Hidin' Joe Biden, Corona, Naming Summer Heat Waves and the VMP Cashgrab debacle. Coming to a YouTube screen near you soon!
The statewide mask mandate is extremely popular, but schools’ reopening is a very close question.   Public opinion doesn’t always work this way but I feel like this reflects the actual underlying reality that it is a complex, difficult call.
Former vice-president Joe Biden has widened his lead on President Donald Trump among Wisconsin voters, according to the latest poll from Marquette University.
Three new polls have Biden up by about 5 points ahead of the virtual convention next week.
Trump’s America: where they use anything and everything currently happening under Donald Trump to convince you somehow Joe Biden is already president and you should be afraid.

It’s refreshing &amp; hopeful reading these people’s statements. Vote Biden, VOTE 💙💙💙
Well I doubt Biden is gonna pick her. I like her and think she’d be an excellent choice for VP.   Karen Bass, a Physician Assistant during the AIDS crisis, talks about the coronavirus.
The last person I’d pick to fly around and meet with world leaders trying to mend wounds created by trump is Pete! I can think of many ppl Biden could pick that would actually qualify &amp;perform well! Not Pete.
I had to let go of Hillary in 2008,16,&amp;20. I had to let go of Beto,&amp;my hope for Him to be the nominee,VP or maybe ever elected to office because -well he’s a white man. I’ve learned to look for all the good in Biden so I can happily support him,but please don’t push Pete on me!
I cry too. We’re watching trumps plan to sabatoge US mail, preventing delivery. With HIS rule a ballot won’t count after 11-3. I’m disappointed that Biden hasn’t held frequent press conferences alerting voters. He should hold 1 of His own presser after all trumps Covid rallies!
Shocking that a”president”is openly aloud to abuse His powers to interfere with the delivery of the mail to win an election. Why Isn’t there ppl pounding the streets in outrage? BIDEN should be holding press conferences on this DAILY! Illegal?UnConstitutional? Will his win stand?
why are biden and trump even wasting time on political ads this year. is there ANYONE out there still actually making their mind up???
I live in WI. As most know I stay in many of our state parks &amp;moped through back woods roads of rural WI. There are always plenty of trump signs,even big banners. I’ve seen 2 Biden signs this summer. So far I’ve ridden 600 miles through extremely rural back roads this summer. Sad
Hasn't NC shown a steady lead for both Biden and Cal?
Of course not! Biden is, rightly, only vetting FEMALE candidates!
One of Biden's most valuable assets is in choosing the women from whom he will choose as his running mate. He's shown more acumen in that than UShitlermurderer and his whole GOP Gestapo team since taking office.
If we start using a Benghazi standard to judge our politicians, then we need to get rid of UShitlermurderer, all his supporters and appointees yesterday  BBC News - Biden VP pick: Susan Rice, the diplomat and lightning rod
A non Biden vote is a vote for Trump fascist tyranny! Trump hates democracy and has already managed to destroy much of it! #BlueTsunami2020
Biden by the way by default will be the most Progressive President we have ever had. There will be plenty of Progressive voices if you listen.
This is not vote shaming.  This is how things work in the USA.  CA is like TX.  If Biden wins TX we have 450 EC votes and vice versa.  If someone votes for the Green Party in 20 some states they are really voting for frying the earth next decade.  Trump2 will do that!

Everyone I know is planning to vote for Joe Biden! All Americans but a few rich bitches &amp; those who live off the black market, are suffering &amp; they know Trump is responsible for their suffering! Us he using extorsion to keep his devil dogs in line?
90 minutes of looking at, listening to Trump, that's too long. Make sure candidates are drug tested before debates. Bipartisan watchdogs to never let candidates out of sight for a moment, such as bathroom breaks! Trump's counting on tiring Biden, 90 mins?
So why do people in either side support and love Biden or Trump so much? Like to the point of defending a person you’ve never met and believe in everything they say?
Some have senior moments, others have Biden moments.
If China prefers Biden, send him over. They can have him

Unless I pass away in the next 3 months and my tombstone ends up as a vote for Biden the buffoon then no
Biden WILL won, who agrees?
Pre-existing conditions are covered under Obamacare! Once again, Trump tries to take credit for something already accomplished by the Obama/Biden administration!
Yes! Obama/Biden passed it. Trump keeps taking credit for Obama’s accomplishments while blaming Obama for Trump’s multitudinous failures!
Biden was not my first, second or third choice for president but I am deliriously happy to vote for him over the insanity we’re living with a Russian asset in the White House.
Who knows, I can't question Joe Biden, I do hope he stays safe 🇺🇸

I could see that, but Harris as AG. Still, Harris has the name recognition, but she kinda ripped Biden a new one early on. Rice has the experience, but a little Benghazi baggage, you know how that gets the base goin!!
Do read this unpleasant crap about crappers 👿Hi Rick. I know that the Lincoln Project is supporting Biden (I don’t want Trump to be POTUS for 4 more years).  Will members of the Lincoln Project still stay true to their Republican values after the election? I’ve seen this question asked on social media a lot.
This quite possibly the dumbest thing I have ever seen. It looks an ad for a middle school student council election. Can I add something? "Vote Biden if you would like to be first in line for the cafeteria...if you would like to have less homework"
#Biden campaign is unhinged? I like unhinged!! The reason I say I'm not voting is because some stuff was taken away in the beginning of 2016 and then brought back a couple months later. I can't take heart break! I'm only steel cage when things go right. Young un's, it's yer turn!
I'd rather take my chance on Biden and Harris than another 4 years of trump! Trump the world IS laughing at you!!!!
Well, there’s Biden ads on Fox News! Are there Trump ads on CNN, MSNBC or any other anti-Trump media channels? Asking for a friend!
I’m not tryna hear “not voting for Biden is a vote for trump” the ballot is equal bruh it’s between pedophile cops who don’t care about us or what the hell we have to say
Might as well of handed Trump the election since we’re putting Biden and Harris together 🙃🤦🏾‍♀️
Biden and Harris. Boy! It sure is fun to see hope return to the country.
I don’t want to vote for Biden either, but I live in a swing state that barely voted for Trump in 2016, so I probably will. Not exactly thrilled but I expected this.
Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris proves that he is not a moderate, and he will be controlled by the radical left if elected. My fellow conservatives, it's time to unite and ensure Biden and Harris never make it to the White House.
Sen. Kamala Harris is the first Black woman and first Asian American person on a major party's presidential ticket
I disagree Biden can only beat Trump under the "blue no matter who umbrella"
The dog can put a sentence together better than Hiden Biden!Why does Biden even matter?  Think hard about the last few months before you answer
Also it does nothing ro discredit biden or the clintons or even any others that were close with him and continued his legacy. The race baiting is the same as always but now it has. M9re angles. Black supremicists, brown, or even people who are (sexual preference) supremicists.
Can anyone give me a reason why biden deserves my vote without mentioning trump?
If that is an example of your grasp of critical thinking then you belong with Biden
Yup. I think it's great that Biden looked beyond old white men of means.  Imagine an America where candidates, employees, etc aren't notable for gender, race, religion, sexual identity et al. Wouldn't that be amazing? They're all just people. None judged. Just people.
Trump has been careful to respect states rights, yet he is called a tyrant. The first thing biden and kamala support is authoritarian b.s. i think most people that are honest with themselves will be saying orangemans not that bad.
They judge everyone by how they look. It is sad. Thats why biden thinks if you wont vote for him you aint black. I wonder if thats how you get white privledge! Id give it to em. Lol
Joe Biden called the China travel ban xenophobic. Your racist sex offender running mate doesn’t get a do over and your lack of ethics is showing.
Biden kept our country in stagnant wages while him and democrat/neocon cronies pieced out our economy and sold it to china. He had almost 50 years to do something worthwhile and ruined it worst at every chance.
Good thing it’s a Biden rally and Election Day voting. If they were voting they would be super spreaders of COVID. But they are safe because it’s just a Democrat rally.
Like a lot of people on Twitter, I'm not a big fan of Biden and Harris, and I didn't want either of them to be in this position. But you're a damn fool if you think they, and the people theyll bring with won't be much better for America than another 4 years of terror from Trump.
Congratulations! Soon, I will be honored to vote for you and Biden. Looking forward to seeing you debate pence!
He is so right on helping retired single households that lost a partner it is so important!  They need more then half of their total ss benifits
And democrats keep voting for people that watch citizens die in the streets while they live it up. Pelosis district is disgusting yet expensive to live there. The left has ruined every place they have a foot hold. Cant wait to see obama hilary amd biden in cuffs.
Kamala harris is trash. Biden i senile, people watch donald trump lies on msm and believe he is everythin that the democrats do. It is an obviosline of crap. With biden have many sexual assualts and harris being a good democrat soldier.
He spent his life passing racist policies to make single parent black homes and fighting for foreign aid which he later gets a kickback from in the form of his son hunter biden getting no show jobs that pay millions. Russian oligarchs were recently raided by the fbi.
Not to mention Lindsey Graham who has disgraced the memory of his supposed best friend John McCain to kiss up to a coward like Donald Trump who claims McCain wasn't a war hero and mocks his service. Sure Harris and Biden had a moment but nothing like the kiss ass Republicans!!
I think he should have just announced her as his VP pick when the Black Lives Matter Black/Brown people picked Harris it was clear if he didn’t pick her they would not support him if Rice was picked there would be a revolt I am voting for the Biden/Harris
When will the Biden/Harris knee pads come out?
really disappointed by all the people excited about Kamala as Biden’s vp
Or sooner if Biden has issues..
Biden said a while ago he was going to pick a woman...therefore, no men are on the VP list.

Joe Biden is no question a gaffe machine and from now until election day he will make several more. The difference between him and Trump is he's a human being who takes responsibility and even apologizes, Trump on the other hand takes no responsibility and apologizes to no one.
He said if Biden wins, China will own our country. 😂 Out of everyone we owe them the most, 1.1 Trill. The amount of our land &amp; property they own is more mind blowing, &amp; concerning when you see how much of it is located on our waterfronts. #Trump #Biden  #needrealleaderNick - how about moving from minutia to some real curiosity about Biden and Harris. Same scrutiny you’d give to an R.
This is disgusting. Time for Wisconsin Republicans for Biden to come out of the closet! Stand up for America!

Trans people aren’t allowed to point out she was f*cking TRANSPHOBIC? (I’m obvi still voting biden, I’m just saying that it’s ignorant and entitled to say that trans people don’t have VALID CRITICISM for Kamala)
Biden’s vp is a Senator and the GOP senators saw the fundraising haul the 24 hours after her announcement. They know she won’t hesitate to speak the truth.
LIARS! It was Obama/Biden that got ACA. It’s GOP that has the law suit to take away your healthcare with NO PLAN. It’s INCOMPENTENT  defunding Social Security &amp; wants to take away Medicare. #FactsMatter
the lesser of two evils for conservatives this year isn’t trump and Biden its trump and abortion  Is abortion so evil that it warrants voting for someone you consider a bad person because, at the least, he won’t vocally/financially support/prolong abortion?  Personally, yea
Just play the video of her bashing Biden during the dem debates!!

Susan Rice was my first choice with Biden picking Kamala Harris as Attorney Genaral. But I will support the Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ticket
BREAK NEWS for  America’s independence of energy happened under the OBAMA/BIDEN term with oil production. Plus pushed for solar &amp; wind power. The Green New Deal is a plan to get to cleaner environment to save the planet. Life needs goals.
Also: Biden is a practicing and devout Catholic. What is this dude on about?
Biden/kamala is more extreme than George McGovern in '72. It shall not be another blow-out but it will be very close with third parties doing well. Possible Twelve amendment results.   Winning control of Congress is mandatory this cycle.
In the event Biden/Harris wins, who are the leading candidates for that newly open CA Senate seat? Barbara Lee? Ro Khanna?
Hope she can debate because hidden Joe Biden is in his basement!!

I mean, I don't know what else they can do. If you just don't believe the platform then I guess it is what it is...
So first we were voting for Joe Biden and now because a former cop is his Vice President, we’re not voting at all? So we’re just gonna sit by and watch Trump take the country again hunh?
Biden does nothing for many of us....not the point of this election. A crazy man needs to be stopped.

STEALING BIDEN CAMPAIGN SLOGAN!
He wouldn't be up to a demanding job. I'm sure he'd agree... in fact, he's been retired for nearly fifteen years.  With Biden we're in a "who's kidding whom?" moment. He looks physically diminished and, unlike my new friend, Biden also looks mentally diminished. It happens.
I just came home from a golf outing. I played with a man who will turn 80 in October. In other words, he's only about two years older than Joe Biden.  He was very nice and still pretty sharp, and we had a good time. But he's also obviously old and physically weakened by age.
Never-Trumpers:  I'm sitting here listening to Anthony Scaramucci make an utter fool of himself on Steve Hilton's show on Fox, trying to defend his support for Biden.  If you ever needed proof these Trump-hating "neo-cons" are insane, this has been it!  Zero credibility.
I think fox has been testing the waters and is preparing  for rejection or acceptance  into the new prevailing winds of november. Their top office people donate to Biden,  I hear. After Trump  wins I think he may change the play book . So far fox is neutral  to left it seems?
I have seen some Biden signs. But I live in a very liberal community. There were many more Clinton signs 4 years ago than Biden signs now.

Does he actually believe what Catholicism teaches, or does he look at it as a buffet to pick and choose what he believes? I have no doubt this is why the Bishop is not acknowledging him as one.

Imagine placing your vote for Biden only to see him lose when you could have voted Green Party and put them into play.  If you can live with that then god bless you.  But I can't.
I'm voting long term.  Biden vs Trump is a short term problem with serious consequences but both will maintain the status quo.  The SQ being zero representation.  Any votes for strong progressives, socialists, Greens are the future.  The sooner we push them forward the better.
Kamala Harris announced as Biden's running mate. Me as a wrestling fan - "Pretty sure he just passed away". #RIPKamala #WWE #WrestlingFan
please stop using Geography simply as the state from which one comes.  In your own piece you identify clear geographic areas as vital.  Geography always matters, especially in elections.  #geography #ElectionDay
Gamble big win big i guess. It doesn't really matter though. Biden Harris will win.
More than that even, we need to push progressives hard into local elections so they become the national figures down the road. Biden-type candidates can't get the nod when the farm system is all AOC's. We're terrible at that, unlike the GOP.
I don't care how much you don't like Biden's VP pick, vote for them.   We cannot have another four years of Trump. We can't.
Sen. Kamala Harris is a powerful Black woman and a great addition to the Biden Campaign. I am so proud to be a candidate on the same ballot as Senator Kamala Harris during this historic election.
Nothing does a better job making me want to vote for Biden/Harris than conservatives trying to make them sound scary.
Biden/Harris has a much better ring to it than Trump/Pence so to my fellow White people please don’t mess this up again
This picture, Jesus Biden looks like he's straight up off a mortician's table and Kamala Harris looks like she's from hunger games district 12.
45 re Harris: "She was probably nastier than even Pocahontas to Joe Biden.. She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden, and it is hard to pick somebody that is that disrespectful."  Calling one person disrespectful while using a slur about another woman kind of negates your point.
Can't wait to get some Biden Harris merch. 😁🤩😍 #BidenHarris2020
Harris/Biden 2020 works better for me.
So because of a VP choice you don’t like, you’re willing to let Trump win? If you’re that easy to dissuade, were you ever actually a Biden supporter?
#BidenHarris2020 .. Maybe Joe Biden just forgot what Kampala Harris said about him?  I could do this all day.
I keep getting ads in YouTube about how Biden is far to the left and that poses a danger to families. And it's like bitch where? Where's this far left you speak of
I was thinking the same thing. She was out fast and was like BIDEN! LETS GOOOOO!!
She is a sellout. Look into what she actually thinks of Biden... guess she’s OK with sexual misdoncut and racism, now that she’ll be VP
All he needs to do his bring up how she thinks Biden is a racist and that she believes his accusers. She is a sellout. He had so many better options
Does she still believe Biden’s accusers? Think he is racist?? Not anymore because it’ll help her career
She thinks Biden is a racist and believes his accusers, far away from who I would invent. She is in it for her own career, not the people she serves
Well I'm at least glad for one thing.  We no longer have to hear news stories about how Biden is going to announce his VP choice tomorrow.
She is an absolute sellout. Thinks Biden is a racist but will be his VP gladly. She’s in it for herself not the people
She hurt the black communities of California and laughed about it. So many better options and Biden picked her
She is a sellout! Does she still think Biden is a racist?? Absolutely appalling
He should’ve picked Val Demings. Kamala is a clear sellout who has attacked Biden for his very controversial past
She is an absolute sellout. She thinks Biden is a racist, but will be his VP? Shows where her priorities are huh
She is such a sellout. Anything for political prowess. She clearly had her opinions about Biden, but anything for more power! Ridiculous
Terrible choice. Val Demings was the way to go but when has Biden ever been that on top of his game. Makes me worried for November
I don’t support trump. I think Biden would’ve been better suited selecting Rep. Val Demings. But to each their own...
She is a sellout... repeatedly emphasized that she thought Biden was a racist and sexual predator. Anything for power I guess...
She is a total sellout. Just months ago she believed Biden’s accusers and pinned him down for his remarks on segregation.
She will do anything for power. Months ago she called Biden a racist and that she believed his accusers. Total sellout!
Anything to move up politically. Just months ago she thought Biden was a racist and said she believed his sexual misconduct accusers.
The top of Democrats' ticket is set. Former Vice President Joe Biden announced today that California Sen. Kamala Harris is his running mate.
BREAKING NEWS  Joe Biden has made his decision on who will join him on the Democratic ticket for president.
BREAKING:  picked as Joe Biden's running mate.
Don't rule out Biden splitting the difference in his mind and picking Duckworth.
I feel like Biden's VP team was full of a bunch of Jonahs.
Eww I just learned that even though Biden is the presumptive nominee, Bernie still gets to be put forth as a nominee at the convention. 🤢🤮
Because Biden and his team are still more or less operating as if this is a normal election cycle.
On second thought, maybe it is really going to be Liz!--As decision day nears, VP hopefuls rake in big money for Biden  via
New battleground poll shows Biden leads Trump in Wisconsin.
Someone asked me to tell them why I'm voting for Joe Biden without mentioning trump or Republicans and the heinous things they're doing. I said because I want Kamala Harris to be president and if this is the way she gets there then I'm voting for Joe Biden.
in regards to the Biden ad spend. Would Hulu ads be considered digital spend or traditional tv spend. Just curious.
I don’t know anyone supporting Joe. I only know people saying anyone but Trump. There is literally zero enthusiasm for Biden.
I’d love to see an article now of a reporter from Sioux City spending a week talking to people in New York City or Los Angeles about why they support Biden.
I imagine they would want a spineless jellyfish like Biden as president!
Election night will be wonderful to see Green Party go over 5%.  I don't want to see a Trump win but to be honest a Biden loss would be sweet as apple pie.
I know some strong Bernie supporters and strong leftists but I know they are thinking about voting Biden just to remove Trump.   They don't want to but are so concerned about another 4 years of this asshole.   I do understand them but the Dems need to go get their votes elsewhere
🇺🇸 President  and Republicans will always stand with our men and women in law enforcement and against Joe Biden’s radical calls to defund the police.  🇺🇸 We need 4 more years of President Trump to preserve law and order.  #LeadRight #KAG #Trump2020
All of the white dudes on his staff that want Biden to pick Rice so they have a way back in.
Anyone saying they know who Biden has picked as a running mate or they know when Biden will announce is LYING.
I'm obviously NOT voting for Biden LMFAO... But I'm torn between wanting to vote Jo Jo or Trump. I feel Trump has let us all down, he constantly caves into liberals. I feel Jo Jo would be different, the Maverick we all want. Fuck the system!
Dude, I don't even know if Trump is going to get to debate Biden at this point, but BY ALL MEANS PLEASE #LetHerSpeak I'm libertarian by heart and I know this is a decisive election AND I live in a major swing state. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE MY FOLLOWERS! Tell me your opinion.
Breaking:  Biden starts everyday asking his team if he picked his VP yet.
I've been on edge for almost 4 god damn years and I refuse to stand by and watch Joe Biden blow this.
If VP were just in charge of foreign policy or if Joe Biden's polling with Black, Latino and Asian voters were higher than Hillary's I would agree.  The problem is he needs to win and win big to overcome all the shenanigans that the trump campaign are going to engage in.
Pence will be in Wisconsin on Wednesday, August 19, the night presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's vice presidential pick is scheduled to speak.
What exactly Biden’s response? He’s a non-government official sitting in his basement.
Biden can comfortably say whatever he wants to say because people like you will always come to his aid. Am sure if it was a "R" that was at the back of his name you will be taking a different positionDO NOT FORGET: In 2013, Joe Biden and Hunter Biden flew aboard Air Force Two to China. Ten days later, Hunter Biden’s firm inked a $1,500,000,000.00 deal with a subsidiary of the Communist Chinese government’s Bank of China.
Nancy Pelosi or joe Biden will assume office in January 21st 2021 whether he likes it or not. When he loses he’s gone.
Biden voter
Speak up if you want law and order. Democrats support the looting of formerly great American Cities. Why haven’t the Dem Mayors stopped the violence?    Biden is an enabler not a solution.
Democrats DONT CARE. Why aren’t they working?  Biden promises will make you poor again. More taxes ok with you?  A failed stock market due to a Biden victory will destroy your small business opportunities; you will be broke and obliged to Government regulations. Vote Trump in!
Not a housewife, but a suburban woman who is voting for Biden/Harris. In my community, lots of suburban housewives and women are, as well.
The fake Republican platform is a billion times better than anything Biden will ever do.
Trump will probably win with a similar result. Biden cleaning up in the cities but rurals going hard Trump.

No she won't.  Americans don't like her, the African American community does not like her, even Biden doesn't like her.   She can only run on her lies for so long.
The fact that republicans like Kamala Harris even more than they like Joe Biden is quite worrisome
I've admired you my entire life. Your songs have helped me find strength and courage and love. I am beyond devastated that you would support a candidate who is beyond evil and corrupt. Biden belongs in prison and Kamala helps set criminals free. You've lost all respect from me 😢
Is it Coma, or Camilla or Kamala? Biden just pronounced her name 3 or 4 different ways.  Does he know her name?
Camel Harris will be the new President of the United States because Biden will never last!  Oh - and everything is Trump’s fault.

Wow team Trump accusing anyone of sexual assault is so hypocritical. Guess who wasn’t on pedo island, joe Biden. Guess who paid off the families of 5 10-year-olds who they molested? Trump. Who has bragged about sexual assault? Trump
If white women are willing to kneel in the street for their guilt, I’m sure they think Biden will now get their vote.
I am quite happy tonight. Great VP pick and my chosen candidates are winning their spots. Best one is Roger Polack, the first best Democratic opponent for the first district. He's going to give Steil a fight. Ordered my Biden/Harris yard sign, too.
Both Biden and Trump are despicable people with shady histories. It’s sad we’re in a situation where we need to pick the lesser of two evils here
I love this picture. Joe Biden asking Kamala Harris, via zoom, to be his running mate. Now that’s he ticket 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 #BidenHarris2020 #RidinWithBiden #GreatPick
No one gives a fuck about your stupid presser Don. We’re celebrating 🥳 Joe Biden’s VP pick. Now be careful. When you see Kamala Harris’s picture don’t confuse her with  They are in fact two very different…
Pure bullshit. However, what happened to Kamala saying she believed every single one of Biden’s accusers? What happened to her saying he was racist? What happened to her sleeping her way to the top? What type of condition is her district in? Shall I go on??
Stay excited! You're voting for more than just Biden/Harris. You're voting for RBG's replacement. You're voting to replace Barr and DeVos and the rest of his crony cabinet.  No ticket is perfect but people evolve and still have flaws.
Not joe Biden chose kamala Harris as his VP?????????? Feels real anti-black in HERE
And there you have it. Our 2020 ticket. I’m thrilled. I love Kamala Harris. Now some guidelines. You come on my page and say 1. I’m not voting for Biden because he didn’t pick (fill in the blank). 2. I don’t like…
Most women, and more than a quarter of the black people I know were on the fence. Most have jumped to Trump, and some are still on the fence. No new people are supporting Biden now.
Congratulations! Can't wait to cast my vote for Biden/Harris!
This will be interesting. All Trump supporters I know are excited by the Kamala pick. Her past and her hypocrisy will be highlighted. I was genuinely surprised to see the support. It is an uphill battle now for Biden.
As a conservative roaming in the wilderness and looking for a reason to vote Biden, Duckworth ain’t it.  Don’t like her and can’t explain why.
I hope Biden waits for Trump to come out to his daily propaganda dump and then announces the name. My guess is everyone (but FoxNews of course) cuts away from Trump.
Joe Biden’s America is happening right before our eyes....

I know biden was strong on Isis. And was cautious about adding troops and aiding our allies. But ignoring the advice of NATO and giving favors to Russia and Afghanistan is not a good political strategy. Russia has annexed Crimea, is at war with Ukraine, and desires more control
11 NEW POSTS ADDED!!!It’s that three-letter word Biden loves so much.
if you can't see cynical manipulation staring you in face by a pro-biden pac (not a jewish communal organization) calling itself "jewish-unity"...  biden will get somewhere bet 65 &amp; 80% of jewish vote &amp; thats fine, but dont go labelling us in the minority as against jewish unity
from the great minds that gave us "if your black &amp; dont support biden you aren't a real black" comes "if your jewish and dont support biden you aren't a real jew."
thats implication of this tweet in support of a pro-biden pac that self-anointed itself "jewish-unity". i guess if i oppose biden i oppose jewish unity?  does that make me not a real jew  its frankly offensive &amp; i hope biden supporting jews see thru it
Vote for Biden watch the USA go down!!  Democrats control!!!

Damn near convinced me to vote for Biden. I say damn near cause fuck that's a tough pill to swallow. Like the idea has me bitter but you make A REALLY solid case.
Both Biden and Harris are running on illegal platforms.  They shouldn’t be allowed to run at all.  They’re criminals.
I see it a lot. Kind of can’t fix stupid. Looking forward to a Biden presidency ❣️
She’s just as bad as joe Biden. Get her out
garbage take ben! biden's comments were silly, but they were courageous (he stood against his jew hating base &amp; obama-era "advisors") + signified he doesn't want to make a political issue out of middle east peace. which is 100% right &amp; should be supported
biden's praising the deal was an act of courage given his jew hating base.  his claiming credit was of course ridiculous, but maybe he gets a pass here for showing at least a hint of spine.
What year was this made? It looks like it was made for an 80’s movie about how animation would be in the future. And no one gives a crap about trains...it’s 2020. When was the last time you even rode in a train? And why wouldn’t Biden just take a plane, like a normal person?
Voters pick Biden?  What kind of sick morons do we have in this country?  Where’d you take the poll—NYC?
We critique Biden and every conservative troll comes out of nowhere like "U THINK UR TOO GOOD TO VOTE FOR BIDEN HUHHHHHHH? U THINK UR BETTER THAN ME AND THE DNC? HUH?????" like relax I can critique the guy because I don't blindly follow my leader like he's God
This is a good middle of the road statement &amp; good on joe for issuing it knowing it would disappoint the rabid Jew haters in his base  But man oh man does it come so so close to recognizing how Trump putting annexation on the table (that biden criticized him for) led to the deal
dont play dumb  everyone knows that haley is on deck for gop nomination  biden had a number of good candidates w/ far less baggage that harris -- he box checking certainly was a big factor
a lebanese street that rejects hezbollah is one that is almost certainly less interested in anti-israel demagoguery thats a big shift.  trump's squeeze on iran has helped put hezbollah into a corner.  will biden really offer them a life raft?  hard to imagine...
if you look at the big picture, the regional rivals are turkey, sa and iran (israel is a regional actor, but doesn't have interest in controlling lebanon or syria).  you'll recall trump was surprising acquiescing to saudi rival erdogan.  would biden have been?
but the most likely outcome of a biden presidency is continuation of the generally pro-saudi us foreign policy that was our norm for decades before obama and that trump restored.
i dont think biden has the same attachments as obama had to iran. biden is likely emotionally far more in line with long standing american/saudi partnership.  he's gonna have to make some gestures towards restoring jcpoa and he'll have people around him who are true believers..
i mean this feels kind of tinfoil hat but the main thing thats changed vis biden is he selected the relatively sympathetic to israel harris over the more hostile to israel rice. but i dont see how to spin that into a theory as rice will still play prominent role (sec state?)
i'm still not sure what this means. open alliance w israel allows iran to portray mbs as a muslim sell out, that doesn't help him.  quiet alliance was never in jeopardy.  how any of this helps vis a biden presidency (which he has to be anticipating) i dont get the theory
this is the real reason biden picked kamala, to pre-empt these stories had nikki haley been first indian american on ticket in 2024
I like my suburb.  I like my synagogue / day schools / faith community. If Biden wins, I can’t keep those things.  Trump could shoot someone on fifth avenue (which is less unusual then it used to be fwiw) and I would still vote for him.
genuinely curious if this hinged on biden picking Harris (who isn’t particularly interested in foreign policy) over Iranian Asset Susan Rice, who would’ve taken it personally and settled scores if she perceived uae + israel and doing something that could help Trump
"If you don't vote for my preferred candidate, you hate the country and the constitution" is essentially the propaganda you're trying to force on people lol.  If you think Biden or Trump are the solution, you're part of the problem unfortunately.
Trumps website is a store or his official election website has only a donation page. There is no policy whatsoever. Biden’s has a real plan for America. Trump has nothing to offer!!
well she's clearly really black because she supports biden and i'm told thats the measure of it
i dont think its overly cynical to suspect that newsweak decided to amplify him / his pet issue to help Biden tho
well then why did he write it then exactly?  team biden is desperate for any hint of racism directed at kamala so they can make her more palatable to the working class black voters who passed on her in the primaries bc she built her career locking their kids up. why help them?
i dunno man.  the left has nominally been coopted by globalists (biden &amp; harris), but they seem rightfully confident that they will get their red meat too  its very predictable that we are going to now do our best to draw lots of little tiny circles &amp; insist anyone outside..  1/
It took me straight to Biden! Only on Goo__le. Not duck duck go though.
guys remember the key thing about mail in ballots is they aren't secret.  your kids want to try to vote biden? #disown.  grandma likes joe?  she can do her own damn shopping in the middle of covid.  wifey thinks kamala is charming...?
well there's gonna be some good jobs clean stuff up now so god bless....  coming soon to a suburb near you if biden wins.
So, you’re implying that people with low incomes are criminals?  Doesn’t the low income bracket make up 80% of your base?  Who is your strategist - I think he might really work for Biden 🤣😂🤣😂
I agree. They gain absolutely nothing by picking her as VP.  Wonder if they intentionally want to lose so they don't even have to worry about replacing Biden at the top of the ticket, which is a nightmare scenario to navigate.
If Biden is Catholic then I’m Jewish!
I’m not voting. I don’t like Trump but I also don’t like Biden.
“His handlers picked”...we can stop pretending to not know that Biden is being allowed to make any decisions in his condition.
To be fair, Biden didn’t choose. He was given a list of black chicks he had to pick from. He doesn’t know what’s going on.
It’s not “trying” or “weak” when he just hangs that biden bigotry right out in the open everytime a camera turns on.
i imagine its more of an uphill struggle than team biden might want to generate enthusiasm for a former, lets call it, *over-enthusiastic* prosecutor. tryna frame her as a target of racism &amp; hope mort klein comes through with some idiocy to back it up seems like the natural play
Earth to Cory - Donald Trump's not running against Kamala. He's running against Joe Biden. (or is he?)
Lots of comments about Biden stepping aside. Has this ever been the narrative about the (presumed) Presidential Nominee before?
Biden look like he don’t know what’s going on in the world. I would rather them have Cory Booker on the ticket.

change. And this Biden/Harris ticket is an example of optics that will make many white liberals feel good about what is being said and not caring about what is not being done, because it doesn’t affect them. Some, while I don’t agree, are taking it to the extreme of not voting
Just want to clarify I am voting for Biden in hopes of a progressive cabinet &amp; general tone shift. But there is a subsection of liberals, often white, that are satisfied with the optics of caring about people rather than the “extreme” policies needed to actually bring about   1/2
Honestly? No, not really. However I will still gladly vote for Biden and Harris because they're a lot better than the alternative.
Not me knocking hundreds of doors for Bernie with a broken foot in a conservative neighborhood in Iowa just for a biden kamala ticket....
V.P. Biden is clearly superior to #45 in two clear ways: He is unafraid of smart, strong women AND he doesn't hold petty grudges.
This is proof that Biden is clearly superior to #45 on two matters: He is unafraid of strong, smart women and He doesn't hold petty grudges.
Nooo don’t get excited about a kamala biden ticket you’re so sexy ahaa
Just read the replies to Bernie's "support Biden/Kamala" tweet. 😆
Trump might call Biden's VP pick 'Crazy Kamala.' But she'll relish taking on him, bland Mike Pence.
Well Biden just sealed the election for Trump.
Translated: Trump is angered and insulted because Biden is choosing a woman as a running mate.  #TrumpIsAMisogynist
my understanding of the polls is trump does well when it comes to *favorability* -- older and working class black voters *like* him more than the establishment would have it, and if D candidate was Bernie, Warren or Pete, Trump would have a chance w them, but Biden is their *guy*
i suspect trump is going to get a record low percent of the black vote.  Biden is their man  &amp; esp. if he does pick a black women VP who will be POTUS before term is up — they aren’t gonna be able to hide his dementia for four years. No one can stay in a basement that long
Trump not picking the next supreme court nominee is important enough for me to vote for Biden
Mayor Pete is trending. Supposedly he has taken  flight to Delaware. Now if Biden picks a white male as veep after all this black woman who hah then we knows he’s going senile. Not a better way to totally piss off 2 parts of his base, woman blacks, and women in general!
I laugh when people say Biden has lost it! This guy😳

Their Union supports Biden huh. I wonder why that is....oh ya Trump quit funding the USPS. Took mail sorters out so the employees are sorting by hand. 25 head postal masters were moved around. His damn rich buddy is in charge! Did your light switch turn on? CORRUPTION!!!!
...some absentee voting can be done in person in a certain period before election day, but it's done with mailed ballots for those out of country, etc.  In an epidemic, forcing people to vote in person reduces turnout of those most fearful...  Not many anti-masker Biden voters...

Whether biden is your adversary or not, you should definitely start fixing the pandemic, not just the economy. Our fellow citizens are dying and all you and your supporters care about is tapping your feet and saying that you have "freedom" to not wear a mask. Sad. Truly.

Joe Biden must not have run his vice-presidential pick, Senator Kamala Harris, by Black Lives Matter. If he had, the Marxist outfit might well have nixed her because she is the descendant of slave owners.
so sick of y’all pretending like Trump and Biden are the same
I hope the #BLM protesters out there fighting for change will be just as passionate if Biden/Harris win and don’t do anything to make systemic changes. The author of the 90’s crime bill and the DA that locked up black men for truancy and pot... Democrats want to lose...

Kamala Harris Once Stood By Biden Accusers - 'I Believe Them'
The proper way to order a presidential ticket is somebody exciting/inspirational at the top (see Obama/Trump) with someone experienced as VP (Biden in 08 and Pence in 2016).  When you put uninteresting/uninspiring people at the top (Hillary/Biden), you immediately have problems.
The moment voting became less “I’m voting for this dude” and more “I’m voting against this other dude”, the system was broken and needed to be fixed. Fuck Joe Biden. Fuck Kamala Harris. Fuck it all.
All honesty, Biden got some good lookin dentures.
The primary is over, im a Medicare for All supporter, which Biden opposes
I find it funny #KamalaHarris made an ad against trump calling him a sexual predator, goes on to say she believes the Biden accusers. But then goes full hypocrite And accepts the vp Position
This will go great with the Biden sexual assault alligations
This quote from Joe Biden speaks volumes:
just Gonna leave this here #KamalaHarris
I wonder how surprised Joe Biden was when he found out he picked Kamala Harris for VP?
She went on the record stating that Biden is guilty of sexual assault tho lol obviously right wing will run with that and the left won't care, but I still think it's funny
Biden/Harris Ya I said it
She never had a chance. Voters had their minds made up before debates. Was always Biden or Bernie.
Gee Lindsay.... tell us again what a great guy Joe Biden is.  Damned the Putin machine must have real dirt on you.
LIke is she trying to campaign for Biden?
This is a perfect example of bias lol. Libs will look the other way and downplay it all. But if it were Trumps VP, they'd go all in on the demonization. She literally said Biden was guilty of sexual assault and left don't care 😂
This is literally a campaign ad for Biden. Are you TRYING to lose?
Biden lost today.

Yeah and Biden opposes giving people the health care they need!
Reminder that even Kamala believed Biden’s victims!

None of this is evidence of wrongdoing by Biden. None of it. So, I think you’re engaging in a disgraceful smear campaign of innuendo for partisan gain — an unethical use of your office, the purpose of which is to represent Wisconsin voters like me.

This same union endorsed Clinton 4 years ago.  I’m totally fine stopping all public sector unions from being able to endorse and donate to candidates but you cannot pick and choose.  Either they all can or none of them can.  By the way Biden will in NY by at least 16 points 🤷‍♂️

Joe Biden came out and asserted we should wear masks for the next 3 months saying it could “save 40,000 lives.”  Does anyone else find it odd that he would only say 3 months? Why not forever?  It’s almost as if he thinks it’s necessary to wear masks only until after the election.

This is how intelligent and coherent I imagine every Trump and Biden interview.
I don't think they are going to need to steal it. Biden has Alzheimer's &amp; even the progressive left doesn't like Harris. USPS failings are because of COVID, and the fact they have less business now than in 1985. Maybe you should get your facts before you make stupid comments.
No questions for #SenileJoeBiden! No questions at all, as Trump takes them daily, plummeted by them, about everything. Biden can't answer unscripted questions. If you vote for Biden, you are voting for Harris, the most fake politician in history as President. No way!
I think I'll buy a joe Biden hat!
I'm from Wisconsin but I can't vote for Biden. I'm voting Green.
Harris def. did some of that, and Biden definitely did a LOT more.  "Not Trump" is...something, but IF they win, THEN what do we have? No one who stands for much of anything pro-people at all.  What kind of democracy is it where candidates offer nothing yet auto-expect our votes?

The election is already over Biden Harris Landslide is all we’re gonna see. It’ll be a big blue wave and the new Leaders will save us all with totalitarian communism !!!
I mean, standing up for what is right and fair for all is what matters.   If enough of us did that, we'd never have another Trump or Biden or Clinton or Obama or Bush again.

Biden Harris already won no need to even bother it’s gonna be a landslide. Blumph is finished this time for sure !!!

In the Trump administration, the meeting would be to also nominate the guy to the State Department. So, no, it doesn’t seem odd for Biden to have met with someone. You’re not fooling people with these smears that don’t indicate any wrongdoing.
None of this is evidence of wrongdoing by Biden. None of it. So, I think you’re engaging in a disgraceful smear campaign of innuendo for partisan gain — an unethical use of your office, the purpose of which is to represent Wisconsin voters like me.
Why are you investigating something that happened 6 years ago? If it’s corrupt, why is it only important since Biden has talked about running agst Orange Leader?
so yeah, i'm in the position where i'm voting for Biden who has made it very clear he is my enemy. not to "reduce harm" - people have been saying that for years, against reagan, nixon, bush - but because i think trump either leaves office january 2021 or upon his death

Five questions for Democrats as their virtual convention nears.
Remember         Trump gets endorsement of NYC police union, warns 'no one will be safe in Biden's America'
Understand your point. But I think  1) He's lost some supporters over the past 4 years 2) Biden is far from perfect but he's not as polarizing as Hillary  3) Lots of young people who ordinarily wouldn't bother to vote, WILL this time.
This same union endorsed Clinton 4 years ago.  I’m totally fine stopping all public sector unions from being able to endorse and donate to candidates but you cannot pick and choose.  Either they all can or none of them can.  By the way Biden will in NY by at least 16 points 🤷‍♂️

Joe Biden came out and asserted we should wear masks for the next 3 months saying it could “save 40,000 lives.”  Does anyone else find it odd that he would only say 3 months? Why not forever?  It’s almost as if he thinks it’s necessary to wear masks only until after the election.

If Biden wins, I hope to see Trump tell ATF to stop enforcing background checks for suppressors, automatics, etc.
Not a housewife, but a suburban woman who is voting for Biden/Harris. In my community, lots of suburban housewives and women are, as well.
The same Dems saying we should listen to the experts on covid have no interest in listening to the experts on policing. None of them scoffed at Biden saying “cops should shoot for the leg.” CNN didn’t have any law enforcement experts comment on that. Weird.
The narrative for many Americans is that Biden is a good ole moderate. Trump needs to defeat that narrative. Best way is by forcing Biden to take positions on China, Police, etc. Make him say we shouldn’t bring back medical supply manufacturing.
Patriotism isn't dead, my friend. Biden and Harris will restore it this November and America will be back!!
If  was deciding which of Biden/Harris tweets were allowed on the site, libs would go crazy and the media would talk about it nonstop. Somehow, Harris’ former press sec has that exact role with Trump tweets and total silence. Amazing.
Biden has been inept for 45 years in DC. HE HAD HIS CHANCE. You only want Orange man out, and it's disgusting what he has to go through

This is how intelligent and coherent I imagine every Trump and Biden interview.
I don't think they are going to need to steal it. Biden has Alzheimer's &amp; even the progressive left doesn't like Harris. USPS failings are because of COVID, and the fact they have less business now than in 1985. Maybe you should get your facts before you make stupid comments.
No questions for #SenileJoeBiden! No questions at all, as Trump takes them daily, plummeted by them, about everything. Biden can't answer unscripted questions. If you vote for Biden, you are voting for Harris, the most fake politician in history as President. No way!
I think I'll buy a joe Biden hat!
I'm from Wisconsin but I can't vote for Biden. I'm voting Green.
Harris def. did some of that, and Biden definitely did a LOT more.  "Not Trump" is...something, but IF they win, THEN what do we have? No one who stands for much of anything pro-people at all.  What kind of democracy is it where candidates offer nothing yet auto-expect our votes?

I mean, standing up for what is right and fair for all is what matters.   If enough of us did that, we'd never have another Trump or Biden or Clinton or Obama or Bush again.

People want Biden to win so they can go back to being ignorant about our destruction.
...but I'm going to stay home on election day, because Kamala is a cop and Biden's healthcare plan isn't quite progressive enough.

Dear everyone - this is the kind of decision that won't ever happen again if Biden wins. Dems will immediately pack courts so enough anti-2A judges will outweigh the constitutionally-minded ones.
I would not be surprised if the Biden Harris group said you two ask a question, we won't reply but it will show the "press" is asking ???'s. #suchafarce
It's remarkable, and  just nodded and gleefully invited the nitwit back.  I mean, really. What possibly could a voter "learn" about Biden now and actually say, "Yeah, Trump has flaws, but NOTHING like that!" ????  Do better, CNN.  #TrumpFailedAmerica
I’m guessing that the people who think I can be shamed into voting for Biden have never purchased a fucking Groupon for dental care. Sorry motherfuckers but I have no shame left!
So this "chicken or shit&amp;glass" analogy is the newest way libs are dismissing criticisms of Biden as ludicrously petty.  But it ignores that badly cooked chicken can kill you &amp; it ignores what critics are actually saying - the chicken is stuffed w/ shit&amp; glass.
Here in Wisconsin people are seriously pissed at the Democrats for cancelling the DNC. Very smart of Trump to visit! Wisconsin people, for the most part, are independent and self sustaining. They will definitely appreciate Trump visiting and despise Biden cancelling.

Your role in this is to vote &amp; to engage others--not the Trumpsters who are too far gone but all the people who think Kamala isn't sufficiently progressive or Biden isn't Bernie or voting is a hassle. Stop trying to win over Trump fans &amp; start working on the passive &amp; undecided.
The appeal to "suburban housewives," the threat that Biden will "hurt God," the promise that "Christianity will have power"--Trump is publicly manipulating religion, fear, and racism. Meanwhile, we're joking about how he pronounces Yosemite or how much orange makeup he's wearing.
I just heard a pundit on CNN say that the big gap in the polls right now is because voters don't know enough about Biden.  Do these crackpots listen to themselves? By what barometer will Biden -- a two-term VP, by the way -- lose support to Trump over the next 10 weeks?
The ads on TV for Trump and against Biden are disgusting. Truly disgusting.
point on  about Joe Biden's MAGA POV is so relevant. When I saw him speak in MKE I was surprised and disappointed by Biden's Americentric, patriotism/nationalism.
Also, I think  is at the point in listenership and subscribers where they can afford to edit in the actual clip of Joe Biden asking if his interviewers are junkies or at least play it off your phone

I've had the same thought.  Obviously they are pointed at Trump, but Biden doesn't exactly come across as functioning either.
My town is filled with yard signs that say "Any Functioning Adult 2020." I tend to think that is those people. Although it's debatable whether Biden is still a functioning adult lol.
I worry that now the Biden-Sanders working groups have done their work and Harris has been chosen, Biden advisors feel they have "sewn up" their bases of support and will now pivot to the Wall Street centrists.

Issue with both Trump and Biden I meant.
I think this is a compound problem of being both an issue with and an issue with Biden.  I think Biden needs to keep getting his messaging out strong about what he's going to do to help American's Healthcare system.
The thing that chaps my ass the most is when they say a third party vote is a vote for Trump to try and guilt me into going along with Biden.
Girl-make up your mind.   Trump isn't a republican like your father is.  He is a nazi wanna be. I suggest in honor of your Dad, sidestep the assohole and support Biden/Harris for a change.  Do you want your child growing up in Nazi era??? Your choice!
I have read multiple pieces on how the election will be stolen. Honestly it's mindblowing what I think we will be in for IF the election goes to Biden. The thing that infuriates me is that supporters will see nothing wrong with it and be like "OMG get over it"
Listen I get that Biden and Harris are not good on pro-life policies, but Trump isn’t either. Pro-life means being pro-life from conception until natural death. Trump is not that
just keep doing those things. There is NOTHING HOLDING BIDEN ACCOUNTABLE because THERE IS NOTHING HOLDING TRUMP ACCOUNTABLE. We have set a precedent, and now whoever's next can get away with everything and still be the great American hero president ever, even if it's Trump again!

Simple fact: Almost every country wants Biden. Why? He’s better for them than Trump. Trump is focused on making the USA great. Biden, Obama, etc were focused on letting the world take advantage of us.

There’s a part of me that believes Biden won’t make it out of August.  I could really see him except a nomination and then around Labor Day step down.
I wish, it's clear that Biden was always going to be the presidential nominee. Everything else was just "performance art" and Bernie's futile trying.  I have to say, Markey might have actually been a stronger candidate than Bernie based on this ad, though.

All Biden or  has to do to win this election is make an add like "Are you mad that football is cancelled? Blame President Trump! His failure to protect the country from the Corona Virus has cancelled football &amp; killed 170,000 Americans"

These polls all prove one thing: our liberal media remains far too powerful. If people think Biden is a moderate, it’s because the media lies about him.
Yeah...this is indeed what your media is gonna look like if Biden wins, folks.
How can anybody actually vote for Biden???? He is literally out of his fucking mind.... besides being a Pedo, he sounds like he’s almost asleep every time he speaks.
I wanted to play an online game and there was a Joe Biden commercial first on a game site. He ain't messing around
For example, broadly speaking I view Biden v Trump as:  -Getting better❌ -Not getting worse❌ -Getting worse (Biden) -Getting far worse (Trump)  That’s not to say I discourage voting Biden, I just think it’s necessary to be brazenly honest about him &amp; his prospective presidency.
Hard agree. If someone is hung up on a Biden/Harris ticket, they haven’t been paying attention these past four years. This election is deadly serious. It’s not hyperbole to say he’s destroying everything he touches.
Agreed, I just contend that when discussing candidates/policies, it’s imperative that we distinguish (A) ways Biden/Dems = less bad than Trump/GOP (“not getting worse”) FROM (B) ways Biden/Dems/progressives will actually [materially] improve upon the status quo (“getting better”)
Yes. Joe Biden supporters are corny weirdos that worship CNN.
I dislike the Clintons more than either Harris or Biden, and Harris IS better than Tim Kaine

I'm pretty sure  would poll at over 20% within a week of debating Biden and Trump. Her plan on criminal justice reform alone makes Biden's look like nothing more than an attempt to grab votes with no real change (oh wait, that's exactly what it is)
So yeah, Biden/Harris may not be the candidates I'm in love with, but I know who don't like, and I'll be using my vote to vote against Trump, who I believe is bringing the US closer to fascism every day.
I mean, the Biden/Harris administration will probably appoint people who are *not* actively out to destroy portions of the government, including the EPA, Dept of Education, CDC, USPS, etc...
Which brings me to Biden/Harris... people are bitching about them already, but like... They may not be your first choice, but I guarantee they are better than Trump and better than a flaming bag of dog shit...
Desperation from desperate people. Trump will lose. And your little tweets won’t gain new supporters. Update your resume. Joe Biden is a decent man. Trump is not.

Really? So they're not trying to create a one world order? Nobody wants to rule the world like China or Russia? And Trump isn't currently fighting against China while your boy Biden is doing deals with China?
The racists hate attacks already being launched against Kamala Harris only validates that Joe Biden picked the right candidate for Vice President. Everything about Kamala Harris family &amp; political background sounds out that the Democratic Party will be greatly energized.
Y’all are desperate and please continue these inaccurate depictions. You know who’s gonna come out on top? #BidenHarris2020 One of the many reasons former Trump supporters are going w/Biden is decency.
Always about race with Biden..

There’s no excuse for his racism but at the end of the day   Biden&gt; trump

I would never speak on anything without having all the facts so i can’t speak on Biden.   What can speak on is the hard facts that are a direct reflection of Donald J Trump’s terrible presidency
And so I won't. Fuck Joe Biden.

Wait...I thought racists were a big part of Trump’s base. Who does he want them to vote for?  Maybe Biden?? 🤔
This is political retaliation.  It's also stupid, because there's a zero percent chance OR doesn't go Biden even if you removed every mailbox.

The Unity Platform and Harris' record are encouraging.   Potentially incredible platform ideas-will the DNC adopt them?  Or will Biden's advisors push him to the  Kasich-Bloomberg-Wall Street friendly center?  Division can happen two ways.
Just like I predicted after MULawPoll showed 75% of people are fed up with protests: Suddenly your local officials are gonna start shutting them down to help Biden/Harris.
I'm confused. Are you not voting for Biden?
how about you use your outrage at third party voters every four years and help us actually get candidates that represent us. I blame YALL for voting Biden in the damn primaries you idiots
"Every single American should be wearing a mask when they're outside for the next three months at a minimum," Biden said at a press appearance in Delaware. "Every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing. Estimates are it'll save over 40,000 lives."

DNC Secretary Jason Rae will call the roll of states on Tuesday as Democrats formally nominate Joe Biden for president.
But the American left is far from Communist, and Biden and the DNC are far from being the Social Democratic Party. Are they instead the Centre Party, who had "serious concerns" about the Enabling Act and yet universally voted for it as the final nail in the republic's coffin?
the lesser of two evils for conservatives this year isn’t trump and Biden its trump and abortion  Is abortion so evil that it warrants voting for someone you consider a bad person because, at the least, he won’t vocally/financially support/prolong abortion?  Personally, yea
In contrast, Biden in past debates has used the technique to talk directly to the center camera to the viewing audience. Will be interesting.
that would be participating in an election campaign, so it's not a good idea. Biden and Harris can consult with him later in November after winning
This is the same GOP the DNC is throwing Biden at thinking it will be okay in the long term.

Here what is being said people's' they want too mess up America through Biden.

"#Virginia mayor [#BarryPresgraves] urged to resign after saying #Biden picked '#AuntJemima as his #VP'"
Biden couldn't tell you what UAE stands for without his handlers whispering the answer in his ear. Which of course would make the hair on his legs stand straight up.

Joe Biden’s veep pick – Why Kamala Harris was a good choice for Joe Biden
because the convention is being shaped around who Biden is and what his strategies are, and that's mostly about playing to the white suburbs for normalcy
Bernie can't do that but Biden can, and he has done literally nothing to flip us to his side.
I think the likely outcome is around the D+8 we got in 2018. There's absolutely nothing Trump has done since that would really improve that score, and they can't seem to make Biden hated enough to drive his numbers down.
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‘should be a great concern to all Christians’
Considering Hillary won 54% of the heads-up vote in 2016, it seems really bad strategy not to try to get some of those voters on your side. It's like Bernies strategy was "30% lane in a crowded field or bust"  It's also clear both Biden &amp; Bernie fans would prefer Liz to the other
Joe Biden pronounced it the same way yesterday with her six feet away from him!!!
Actually multiple sources have Liz's voters as 50/50 between Biden and Sanders. Some pragmatically moved to Biden on ST.  The reason I think Warren would do better vs Biden than Bernie did is b/c unlike Bernie, Warren received support from Hillary &amp; Bernie 2016 camps
Biden &amp; the Dem Party &amp; attendant Party goons have until November 2nd to get their shit together &amp; decide if they ACTUALLY care about beating Trump.  There are a LOT of voters out there they're flatly &amp; actively throwing away. Stop demanding--EARN their votes--OFFER something.

The only thing that will happen to Biden is him becoming the 46th president with the mighty Kamala Harris at his side. Pirro can drown herself in a liquor bottle for all I care.
I'm not excusing his racist post, but this is a lesson on how to apologize: "I want to make this very clear to everyone with absolutely no qualifications, I understand what I posted on social media was wrong, offensive and unbecoming."
Hope they're spying on John Kerry bc you know he's reaching out to his Iranian backers to promise things Biden will roll back.
This is what's happening now with you as president. We can do much better with Biden/Harris#2020
Everybody is saying things to the effect of:   "I didn't vote for either one. They weren't even in consideration for me."  Well, if no one voted for him, how the hell did we get stuck with Biden in the first place?

A Biden/Harris presidency would result in more abortions. If you truly believe that's worth beating Trump, you're not an evangelical, you're not religious, you're quite likely not even a good person.
This reminds me: I'm totally fine if you don't like Trump because he's not a conservative. That's fine. That said, there's no world in which I'd ever vote for a pro-abortion candidate like Biden because I want to "fix the republican party." It's never, ever worth it.

It’s still amazing to me how fast twitter switched from “I believe Biden’s accusers” to “blue no matter who” and ignoring Biden’s accusers. It felt like 24 hours between the change right as he was gonna be the nominee. If he wins we’re still gonna hold him accountable right?

That doesn't matter anymore, Junior. By the way, justice is coming for you. With Biden and Harris soon to be at the helm, you won't be safe.  That's not a threat; that's a guarantee.
Exactly. A vote for Jo is a vote for Jo. I didn't realize how hard that is to understand. I guess her vote counts as 3. One for Jo, one for Biden, and one for Trump. Its a win-win.

And what exactly will she do about Biden's dementia his problem as a racist ,harassment of women or his sons ileagle dealings . Or her many skeleton's and misdeeds were not worried.

Holy cow! You don't really believe this ridiculous drivel, do you? Biden is a Racist and Kamala is a Cop! They don't reflect me or anyone I know. I've got roughly 3 million friends who feel the same way. You don't speak for "all the American people." #FullFashTicket #NeverBiden

This analogy is dumb.  Voters are always asked to compromise, surrender, wait.  Biden's out there actively refusing to support hugely popular stuff like M4A.  So is Trump an existential threat or not? The Dem party &amp; Biden's actions both suggest he's not. That's on THEM, not US.
Legit Biden has given up on getting the left on board and that has been shown after Kamala has been picked as a VP. That is going to be his downfall, mark my words .
I don't want Trump. But, right now, I don't want Biden, either. It is indeed a bad situation.  The Dem Party needs to remember who they allegedly represent. Right now, they treat everyday voters horribly--offering nothing while demanding their votes. I just can't support that.

What Does Joe Biden’s Choice Of Kamala Harris For VP Mean For Wisconsin?
The onus, again, is not on ME. I reject your framing.   If Biden and the Dem party want my vote--if they really believe Trump is bad--they would take the initiative to secure as many voters as possible.   They're not. That's on THEM.
Again, that's not on me or any other voter.   If Biden wants those voters, he can offer them something. So far, he's actively, repeatedly refused to do so.  It's interesting to me that the candidates are never the ones to compromise, only the voters are told &amp; shamed to do so.
I could care less WHO the person is. If the POLICIES are there, and I have more than just lip service in that regard, I am open to considering them.  Biden has an atrocious record, however, and has shown no interest at ALL in wooing or working w/ actual progressives. So fuck him.
What Does Joe Biden’s Choice Of Kamala Harris For VP Mean For Wisconsin?
The Democratic establishment is clearly willing to risk it.   It's a solvable problem. I don't WANT to not vote for Biden, but he's provided me with no incentive to do so.   If they think they can win w/o my vote, that, again, is on THEM, not me.
I can't imagine ever being open to Trump.  At the same time, Biden could TRY to match his policies to the wants of everyday people--you know, everyday working people the party USED to represent. And people--myself included--could be an EASY lock come Nov.   He's chosen... poorly.

Please go out and vote! Every vote can make a difference. If you don't agree with Biden/Harris you should look into voting for  Libertarian party. She's the best shot we got at getting Trump out of office.
What are you gonna do? Vote for Biden now, but withhold your vote when the Republicans throw another fascist at us against an incumbent Biden?  A. No you're not, you're gonna preach the same Blue No Matter Who crap, and B. if you threatened it anyways, they wouldn't believe you.
Fuck the polls.  We keep working like Trump is 10 points up.  No let up whatsoever.  Also I live in Wisconsin, and it sure doesn't feel here like Biden's 12 points up.  KEEP WORKING.
I thought I saw that the Marquette poll had Biden ahead, as well. I just hope that he at least mentions Milwaukee next week in his acceptance speech.

To my Hillary family, I love you above all.   We are here to help the Biden - Harris ticket win.   We always have  back.   And now   Always.   Defend, fight, and win.  #BidenHarris2020 #SoulOfANation
with everything going on in our world rn i am fucking dumbfounded that biden would choose a dirty cop as his vp as we are in the midst of massive movement against the current way law enforcement is ran.  it’s almost like dnc actually WANTS to lose
Under Biden/Harris I hope He is. Perhaps even some States.
And you can’t really get away from the fact that Reade has as much contemporaneous, compelling evidence than nearly any high profile accuser has had in recent years and it hasn’t mattered at all, except to invite the bizarre “I believe her and I’m still voting for Biden” dodge.
Neither Trump or Biden have any intention of: *Ending Qualified Immunity *Decriminalizing Poverty *Ending the War on Drugs *Demilitarizing Police Depts *Fighting Police Unions  and  have concrete plans to tackle these issues head on. #VoteGold
So...Twitter is fine with Biden lying but tags every Trump campaign claim that’s not 100% true? That’s how this is gonna go?
Remember trump tweeted a casket with Biden name on it.😠
LOOOVE this. Biden chickens out of coming to WI and Trump does instead.
Biden and Harris Pledge a Strong Challenge to Trump and a Path Out of Crisis
Biden and Harris a President VP and his Administration that knows how to govern. It will be a dream come true. People of America we can’t let Trump and his Minions steal the Election. America’s life depends on Trump losing!
Trump wants BM to vote for him. If he can’t do so directly, he’ll run Kanye to siphon some of the black male vote away from Biden and hopefully hand him battleground states.
Don't give Kanye West any Democrat votes. He is a spoiler for to take votes away from Biden/Harris. This is what happen in 2016  with Jill Steins. #novotestothespoilers2020
I be feeling guilty as hell about that shit and then I get on here and fully adult people are like, Biden could fondle every woman I've ever met and he'll still get my vote. I still feel guilty, but damn!
Biden begins to step up to the plate. Hope he keeps it high until the election and I hope, the presidency.
You know your doing something right when Scott Walker comes out from under a rock to attack you &amp; tie a failed officer's untruthful "victim narrative" to the 2020 elections &amp; Trump's re-election campaign. Proudly I'm ridin' with Biden! 💪🏾
And I’m voting Trump.  He deserves at least 40 more years.  He’s already done more than Biden and he’s only had 4 years and non stop obstruction..
. "As you know, Joe Biden refuses to come to Wisconsin next week for his own convention ... maybe after he hears this call he will, he's not even going to pay the respect of at least making a stopover."
Biden/Harris for the people #2020 🇺🇸💙
Local tv carried Biden/Harris in full, cut Trump really short! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
No she won't.  Americans don't like her, the African American community does not like her, even Biden doesn't like her.   She can only run on her lies for so long.
Trump plans to visit Wisconsin during the DNC, which would have brought Biden and other Democratic leaders to Milwaukee before going virtual
Trump said if Biden wins we’ll all get to learn Chinese anyways, so don’t worry about it too much
A million times yes. Dr. Biden is intelligent, educated, accomplished, compassionate, attractive, kind and funny.
that's +2 for Biden vs voting directly for him which is just +1, thank you for doing your part
Biden selling dreams too ....
It is totally defensible to not want to vote for Trump or Biden. I will die on this hill.
Pathetic ass-clown amuses us with his scathing review of Biden/Harris presser. How will we ever rebound from this critique?
We don't have to do anything, the Dems offer nothing. You have to work to get Biden elected. You don't get to have concerted effort between party elites and corporate media to destroy a left insurgency and then beg us to use our energy to help you
They already have gun control. The problem is people getting them illegally. Biden can’t help with that.
Is Russia currently in the room with you and can you point to it? HRC was a bad candidate, much like Biden, but y'all didn't bother learning anything in 4 years.
So, he thinks Biden/Harris are going to put a big old Cabrini Green like complex smack dab in the middle of, say, Glencoe?
Joe Biden’s answer: “We shouldn’t have banned travel from China.”
Oh for goodness sakes. If that's the most important thing to you as a Veteran, smh. During Obama/Biden a family friend was and still is a helicopter pilot. They consistently ran out of spare parts and often had to rig stuff. Then their interpretation of "Rules of Engagement." Smh

i hate biden and kamala too but if i associate with you and you vote for trump coming up i will never speak to your ass again and i put that on everything i love. fuck you and fuck trump. i mean this shit with every part of my soul.
Experts weigh in on the Biden-Harris logo: ‘It could be scribbled on a napkin and I’d be happy’
like if you cared at all about winning you'd want a VP who would unite the party (a progressive to Biden's centrism). all Kamala does is make sure the Khive doesn't burn Biden's campaign to the ground.

So,  takes you to Biden's website?  Wtf?
I think it was  asking  abt ANTIFA site linking directly to Biden Harris fundraiser site. Should they denounce ANTIFA? POTUS said they should but they won't. Good question, good answer!!
Harris wants U.S. to give Americans $2,000 a month during pandemic, a contrast with Biden’s measured approach - The Washington Post Trump’s #GOPTHIEVES have stolen much more than that from all of us. #TaxReformHoaxes only 1 way. #PassTheHeroesAct

When does Biden start getting briefings?
Now that Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's running mate, it's a safe bet that the mainstream media will never run these devastating clips of her ever again.
I've admired you my entire life. Your songs have helped me find strength and courage and love. I am beyond devastated that you would support a candidate who is beyond evil and corrupt. Biden belongs in prison and Kamala helps set criminals free. You've lost all respect from me 😢
I never would tweet any negative Biden stuff. The Bernie Bros will never stop. They are sharing Russian propaganda and will deny that's what it is. 🤦🏼‍♀️

On Point Stephanie, but also inaccurate?  I’m confused. It seems to me that Joe Biden and his wife are Roman Catholic?  The Catholic Church has however seemed to develop a series of very strange litmus tests in the past 4 decades. Perhaps they do not pass muster?
democrats are okay with racism when it benefits them; aka joe biden
Turd waffle. You just wish you had a dad like Joe Biden...
Wow,  just nailed it, he's is 6 months younger than Biden. I would have bet 10 yrs there is such a dramatic difference between the two men. Not even close!!

Camel Harris will be the new President of the United States because Biden will never last!  Oh - and everything is Trump’s fault.

How long will it take you to realize a balanced budget amendment is a terrible economic idea, and admit you lied to 5th graders? I put my money on Biden.
We need polls of Biden, Trump, Kanye in states where Kanye has successfully made the ballot.  Maybe the GOP will stop helping him when they realize he takes just as many votes away from Trump as he does Biden.
while i'd love to see everythign pushed further left, it certainly takes the sails out of Trump's "Biden wants to defund the police" fear tactic.
If M4A is not actually popular among the electorate, showing this video will help Joe not Trump.  If M4A is popular among the electorate, pushing Biden to adopt it will help Biden not Trump.  What you're wondering does not make sense

Her words... Why would young people vote for her? Both her and Biden represent everything young people value. Listen to the language think about the issues. Don't just do what you are expected to do.
This will 100% be described as a "Biden tax penalty" next spring by all Republicans and most media outlets in the event of a Democratic win in November, and McConnell will seek major concessions over it if he still controls the Senate
not exactly Biden's best line of attack
So the Biden Harris intro was set for 2pm, then 230, then 315, now 430...anyone else find that odd for an intro 1st appearance?? Does to me. 😏
Imagine calling yourself a leftist and then thinking you’re edgy for not wanting to vote for Biden. Lmao
Biden/Harris2020 all the way!
Yeah I'll probably vote for her and Biden only because of this.
I don't think Biden wants to help Trump, he just has personal beliefs and institutional forces that push him to take positions that help Trump.

Better Ask Joe Biden if that cat is really black first brah.
This scheme was hatched and implemented within the span of 1 month, and only 2 months after more than 100 Ukrainians lost their lives revolting against corruption. The media covers for VP Biden by repeatIng “no evidence of wrongdoing or illegal activity.” What do you think? (10)
BTW, the average American household works hard to earn 10% of what Hunter Biden and his firm were paid by Burisma. It’s nice to have the right last name, and friends in high places. (8)
BTW, don’t you think that Mykoloa Zlochevsky would have made sure Ukrainian officials desperate for U.S. support knew that Hunter Biden was on his board? I’ll bet he did. The obvious message to those Ukrainian officials: “If you want U.S. support, leave Burisma alone.” (6)
Fifteen days later, on May 13, 2014, guess who joins the board of Burisma?  That’s right, Hunter Biden.  Another sheer coincidence? (5)
I voted for Gabbard, in the Wisconsin primary.  I hoped that she, Biden, and Sanders would keep campaigning until August.
Five days later, on April 21, 2014, VP Biden travels to Ukraine and news reports describe him as the “public face of the administration’s handling of Ukraine” (2)
The timeline of  and Hunter’s multimillion-dollar Ukrainian conflict of interest is revealing.  Only two months after revolution to rid Ukraine of corruption, Hunter’s business partner, Devon Archer, meets VP Biden at White House.  Doesn’t that seem a little odd? (1)
Is #KamalaHarris being chosen as Biden’s running mate simply a move to diffuse #BLM ?
I live in Oshkosh, WI and tRump is supposedly visiting here monday by Basler Hangar on 20th ave. I have been trying to get our local dem party to line the street w Biden/Harris signs. No luck yet 😪
Wisconsin is going blue for Biden after Trump tear gassed protesters for a photo.  I don't live in our 1st congressional district so if Ryan was still around there would be little I could do.  I have campaigned before for Mike McCabe during our last governor election.
There is absolutely zero chance Trump wins in a landslide, the electoral map just doesn’t work in his favor. Biden could lose every state that’s even kind of a contest and he’d still get 180 electoral votes
12. What does  know about Hunter Biden’s business dealings in China?
11. What skills or knowledge did Hunter Biden possesses that qualified him to be on Burisma’s board and receive $50,000 to $166,000 per month for his and his partner’s services?
10. Why do you believe Burisma recruited and paid Devon Archer, whom  met at the White House in 2014, and Hunter Biden to be on its board?
9. When did  first become aware of how much Hunter Biden was being compensated by Burisma?
8. When did  first become aware that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma?
7. Was  aware in April 2014 that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma?
4.Was Hunter Biden aware that British officials had seized the bank account of Burisma owner Mykoloa Zlochevsky?
3.Was  aware that Burisma’s owner, Mykoloa Zlochevsky, was generally viewed as a corrupt oligarch and that his London bank account containing $23 million had been seized by British officials only 15 days before Hunter Biden joined the board of a company he owned?
1.Why did  meet with Hunter’s friend and fellow Burisma board member Devon Archer at the White House on April 16, 2014? Was anything related to Ukraine, Hunter Biden, or Burisma discussed?
Even Secretary of State Kerry’s stepson knew Hunter’s involvement with Burisma was problematic, severing business ties with Hunter and making clear his reason why.
Two months after Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity - a revolution against corruption - Hunter seized a multimillion-dollar opportunity available to him because his last name was Biden.
Biden already turned down the Green Deal outright.  Biden pushed through the Crime Bill that helped incarcerate millions of black Americans  on petty drug crimes.  Biden picked a VP that refused to go after corrupt wealthy individuals while backing for profit prisons.
The only substantial difference between Biden and Trump is Trump tear gassed American citizens for a photo op.  Biden not dumb enough to that.  That is the only reason Biden will win Wisconsin.
Great ?, took courage to get where you are. It would be great if all groups had representation in America,but they don’t.Third parties don’t work.Until we have a proportional system,where power can be shared among multiple parties:only 2 choices &amp; you won’t vote Trump, so Biden..
Vote for Biden.  This isn't a hard question.
Yes Biden says that he will mammary the mask for 3 months.  That's til election day?  Will all the scare tactics the left is forcing down our throats go away? Suppose so
That's bullshit to say to Biden, making threats like that. Lock her up with Trump
So, you're saying if we elect Biden and Harris, high-paying technology jobs will be available across the entire country?   Sure, there will be some growing pains, but I think a lot people will enjoy making a living wage.

How do we hold Biden accountable if he doesn't address corruption, property, police brutality?  Do we vote Republican 2024 if he fails to produce?
I'd like to see it be #Preet Bharara. I think he'd be a great Attorney general in the Biden Admin.
This is my response to anyone that says “this election is too important to not vote for Biden/Trump”. Shit rolls downhill. You magically think 2024 that a 1960 JFK/1980 Reagan type candidate is going to magically materialize?
I have a hard time with people that don't think it'd be easier to push Biden &amp; Harris further left than risking 4 more years of Trump.
Trump’s the worst you’ve ever seen so Harris is right there since she accepted campaign money from him. I love how convinced you are Biden/Harris will be radically different when Harris has Trump money in her campaign coffers. It’s cute
I would’ve thought “but this election is too important” people would’ve learned their lesson that candidates won’t get any better if you keep voting for terrible candidates after going from Hillary Clinton to Joe Biden but apparently not
Harris won't help Biden.  She doesn't have much political experience; she's in her first term.  She's not from a swing state.  Biden was already going to win California.
If Biden wins (which I hope won't happen), who should be in his cabinet?  I hope, for these jobs, he'll chose these people:  sec. of state, Leon Panneta; sec. of treas., Janet Napolitano; sec. of def., Ken Salazar.
My 10-year-old son at bedtime:  Mom, remember to get a Biden-KAMALA sign for the yard!   Swoon 💙
It’s clear to me that Biden is just trying to get votes from the “wrestling fan” demographic.
I like VP Harris Biden and Harris are going to make an awesome President and Vice President
The “feud” between Harris and Biden during debate season? On the opening day of the 1960 Democratic convention, LBJ sent John Connolly before the press to disclose the JFK had Addison’s Disease. Three days later, JFK invited LBJ onto the ticket. It’s politics.
When MAGA folks say Biden will ruin america:
Apparently you seem to forget that this woman locks up marijuana users and has laughed about it. Now, why would you wanna vote for someone that said Biden was a racist/believed the accusers and locks up people that clearly would be potential voters to get her In?
The only reason I didn't think she'd be the VP pick was it didn't help electorally, she's a Senator from California, Biden is probably going to get a large % of the vote there. But I couldn't think of a better alternative with national appeal.
And called Joe Biden a racist 😂 makes a lot of sense...
Will Harris help Biden?  I don't think so.  She's in her first term.  She's not from a swing state.
Grow up and vote Biden
Is that to say we'd be Biden our time?
BIDEN/HARRIS FOR THE WIN!!!!
If Biden wins she will most likely become president because he ain't gonna last long
She'll either be the first female president if Biden is elected and resigns... or she'll be the presidential nominee if Biden even makes it to the election.
Congratulations  and  Excellent news!
As a Federal Democratic Republic not possible.The more I watch Orbán;Brexit perhaps our Founders prescient &amp; brilliant.The ACA despite its problems,has demonstrated to most that healthcare is a right.Biden will have an opportunity to bring a M4A like system,if he takes a chance.
I feel as if you would say that about anyone that Biden picked though
Of course Biden had to chose a non-white non-male VP. They would’ve mopped the floor with him if he chose someone else. Why are we surprised it’s Kamala?  #VPPick Also, I kinda like her tbh.
Sen. Kamala Harris is the first Black woman and first Asian American person on a major party's presidential ticket
A Biden Harris ticket is literally my worst nightmare.   A senile old Republican man disguised as a Democrat with a cop at his side. Cool!!
We’re Ridin with Biden and Kamala!
If even Marquette has Biden up, something big is happening in Wisconsin.
Taxes will be raised if we let Biden in the Whitehouse, did realize until I wrote it out but the structure should be renamed🧐
I won't trust a vaccine if Trump says it's good. I'll wait until Biden says the vaccine is good.
John, you’re clearly a gentleman and a scholar, however we both know she wasn’t hacked! Head injury possibly:
Adam, the ACME anval was dropped on her head many years ago....
Saunders has never been a journalist; unless promoting ones radical casuistry is journalism. Her checks, while not signed by Mussolini are at least signed in the spirit of him and his mentor.  Her most recent “jewel”...
Agreed. I still think Biden should announce the pick. He is really dragging this out.
Show me where Biden said he wants to “end” SS. Wishing to reform it does not mean ending it. Trump cutting off SS funding ends it. What a cult you belong to.
I completely agree. I would never do that but I must confess that I don't miss his signs. It is amusing cause I would not have multiple Biden signs and flags in my yard if he had not come out strong with 6 Trump signs.
Sadly, this is where we are. I have multiple Biden signs in my yard and it was necessary to install cameras and motion sensor spotlights due to multiple vandalism incidents. Neighbor is a Trump supporter and he had 6 signs, all were vandalized. Now he has none. It's not cool!
For the love of God people vote Biden! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Won't need them because Biden won't make it to election day. The delay in VP pick is really who will take Biden's place.
Let's not forget he's complicit in Trump's nonsense mission to 'investigate' Hunter Biden using Russian misinformation. Allegedly.
What if Biden's delay in picking a VP runningmate is really him picking a replacement for himself?  #deepthought
Biden already said he doesn't support the green deal and nether does Pelosi.
I think that about 90 percent of people, I know, will vote against Biden, but Illinois has a lot of Democrats.  In 2018, JB got 53 percent.  In 2016, Hillary got about 55 percent, there.  Duckworth got almost that percentage.
I can't believe these people in this country can be so stupid and ignorant we will vote Biden!
If you live in Illinois, please answer this.  Will you vote for Trump, or will you at least consider voting for a third-party candidate, since Biden will easily win Illinois?
New prediction.  Biden won't make it to the election. Dems will either install Sanders or appoint a different nominee.  #prediction #Election2020
7/7 The only ones responsible for furthering Russian disinformation to interfere in our election are the Democrats in Congress and the Biden campaign, and the media that is willingly amplifying their lies. They should all be ashamed.
Biden has also been a liar and plagiariser his whole life.
Your ignorant, divisive tweets aimed at rallying your “base” make me sick and galvanize my vote for Joe Biden this fall. Keep on tweeting things like ChinaVirus because it’s driving people like me (and there are many of us) who have voted Republican for many years, away.Voting Biden/Harris and a return to sanity.  No one is above the law, the GOP has turned a blind eye to Trump’s crimes.
I couldn’t care less what he has to say. Will you hold Harris accountable for the things she said about biden. Why do libtard new yorkers move here? To spread the misery?
But you’ll vote for biden and harris?
Love him or hate, at least with Trump you know who is running the White House. Biden? Please. Just a puppet.
I miss him as our president. I wish he could get another 4 years. Hopefully we can get Trump out and get Joe Biden to be our president for the next 4 years. That would be wonderful
lmao... ur so woke... first of all its been debunked and fake or else he wouldve been removed by now... second of all you do know russias economy is like the size of texas? and yet chinas economy who prefers joe biden is double that of the usa
I mean, Kamala did say that Joe Biden was a bad guy... duh.
Second fact check in a week from a claim friends or family pointed out. Always welcome suggestions!   Biden opposes school vouchers, but he has no authority to ban them since the Wisconsin program is authorized and funded by the state.
takes more questions in one day than Biden has in a year. Plus you can actually understand him.
is not in control. He does what his handlers tell him to do. He is an old mindless puppet like Biden. His job is to disrupt, destroy, and slow any growth and prosperity in WI and the US to lay the groundwork to have Trump lose and have the country changed to socialism.
So when will Biden ever answer questions?
Actually biden has said many times that his tax increases will be for those earning more then 400,000 a year
Fuck this guy. So worried about 0.0000something percent fraud. I’m excited to watch how he reacts to his loss. Shame it has to be Biden to do it.
Joe Biden can barely read from his notes.  His handlers proposed this not him.
Blah blah blah, Vote BIDEN/HARRIS, return sanity to the White House.  Remove these cheaters, grifters, liars, and scum
Folks want to be outraged. Let's remember who helped Biden get this far. What did she do in the process?
While shopping, I thought of what the Biden Transition Team will need most. This jumps to the top of the list.
All Biden and Harris do is bash the President. Why? They are hiding their radical agenda from America. Why do the think the Senate bartender only gets 60 seconds at the DNC? 🤔
I love you, Hillary, Bush, Bill, and Biden so much.  UN the United States, for the greater good of all that want that illumination. 🇺🇳

I hate trump more than a lot of people and you can say he’ll be re-elected if you don’t vote for Biden but Biden is a racist sexual predator and you won’t catch me with that fake ass support good byeeeeee
I remember the days before Obama-Biden (unfortunate for libs). We all got along a lot better.
Ask women if we care if "men are insulted" by this. Seriously? LOL
Honestly pissed that the 'progressive' Democratic party continues to push candidates that nobody wants, knowing we're forced to vote for whoever they put forth in order to vote out Trump. We didn't want Biden.
nobody likes Joe Biden and if you say you do you're pretending
And Biden wouldn’t be the nominee to go against him. His entire career is indistinguishable from a Republican’s. He won’t change anything, he’ll just be polite on Twitter. It’s really disheartening that this is where we’re at now.
Proves Biden is not in control.  Biden did not pick her by his own will.
Biden committed to 3 debates in June.

The Biden VP announcement timeline feels like the opening segment on Maddow. Taking forever to get to the damn point.
Joe Biden didn’t write this.
These are Biden supporters that are allowing this to happen. Why doesn’t he speak out about these governors allowing this but he won’t because he doesn’t care about the citizens only the money and power. Why would any one vote for a democrat for anything ever? This is pathetic!
Good to see Biden’s wife is doing all the interviews now. What a joke.
It's fucking annoying. Trump bad this. Trump good that. Biden bad this. Biden good that. I wanna blow my ears out during every video I watch (like FusionZGamer, Ben Phillips, IAMWILDCAT, etc). BUT at least they getting money off of it so yeah.
Yeah but I thought Trump was a better candidate in 2016. No way Biden is as polarizing as Hillary. He won’t have that sizable advantage this time around. Oh and now he’s running as an impeached incumbent. That seems...tarnished, to say the least.
And who is going to be blamed over the deficit? The republicans will blame Biden and the Democrats when they win in November. The Dems will get it under control and then a republican will be re-elected and there goes the deficit again. Same old same old.

Yes, we should. The President Biden and Vice President Harris of the United States will be sworn into office during a ceremony on Wednesday, January 20, 2021.
Stop chasing rabbits Gossamer. Biden’s mental capacity is a made up issue whereas Trumps mental decline and instability is on full display daily. The decline of the US is mirroring Trump’s failing faculties. At least Biden chose a competent running mate who is capable of leading.

It’s ridiculous people think their far left. Biden is a moderate, but I think Kamala is a little farther left than Biden, but nothing near to label her far left imo.

That's not what that means at all. Biden has a more relaxed, no low blows demeanor. Trump has an aggressive, no holds barred demeanor so it would be interesting to see how he holds up against someone as FIERCE as Kamala
Are there any 'journalists' at that presser able to ask a hard, inciteful question? Or, are they all ringers there to lob softballs.  Trump keeps referring to Biden et al as people who don't know what they're doing.  Pot calling the kettle black? Some COVID update. Such BS.

#KamalaHarris is Biden's VP pick, and state politicians and WI voters had their thoughts to share. Check out tonight's story:
You’re so classy. I was rooting for you. I love Kamala, too. Honestly, many whip smart &amp; strong candidates but you, Bass &amp; Harris were my favs for your work in the senate and beyond. Voting blue and proud of the Biden campaign for this historic decision. You’ll be in the cabinet!
Six months from now, everyone complaining about Kamala Harris being a cop and saying they won't vote for Biden, and thus Biden losing, are going to be complaining about the third straight week of police officers shooting BLM protesters and Trump rooting them on.
He'll sign a bill if it comes to his desk if the pressure is kept up.  No matter what you say, Biden is better than Trump.  Four more years of Trump, we might not even HAVE A chance to vote for president.
Then please hold your nose and vote Biden. Fesh was right, there's two options in our system. The Greens nominated Trump no matter what name appears on the ballot for them.
Mike, Colorado is in play. Every vote for Biden counts. Do you really want to see four more years of Trump?
Trump would have been shooting protesters in the streets if he wasn't running for reelection.  Just admit it, you wouldn't have been happy no matter who he picked.  I'm not happy with Biden but he's not Trump. That's good enough for me this go around.
Are you kidding? Nominee Biden has pushed significantly left of Candidate Biden. He's taken big cues from both Warren and Sanders since they dropped out. There are so many bad narratives floating around that just aren't factual.
I saw ppl on twitter today who’re Anti-trump but don’t want Biden either, so they’re going to write in Bernie. Plz don’t be a fucking idiot. This is how Trump can get elected again. If you write in a candidate just throw away your fuckin ballot.
It’s starting to become clear why Harris was chosen...as Biden’s surrogate backbone.
I dunno. Maybe I'm an idiot for thinking the worst of Joe Biden is far better than the best possible Trump second term.  I understand not pushing it too far on policy in this election. You have four years to push on that if you win. What've you got if you lose?
Anyone who isn't in a state that's in play who doesn't vote for Biden is selfish.
There's two choices on every ballot.  Trump or Biden.  Sorry but every other party nominated Trump.  Don't vote? Grab yourself a MAGAt hat because you've owned it.  We have a better chance of progress with Biden than we ever will have with Trump.
With Biden in office though, we'll have a hell of a lot better chance of the action on the streets resulting in concrete positive, and lasting impact than under Trump.
It's also just kind of the reality of the moment. Like, I'm not prepared to fuck around with anything which might push the needle towards Trump this year. Get Biden elected, /then/ push him hard to be better.
I don't even like Biden, but I'm also never going to pretend for a second that I'm even remotely considering not voting for him.

Only if people are more okay with four more years (at least) of Trump's crap than of voting for a flawed candidate who ISN'T a narcissistic POS.  There's two options, Biden-Harris or Trump-Pence. Vote Green? Trump's their candidate. Vote Socialist? They nominated Trump too.
When exactly did JB go from Justin Bieber to Joe Biden
I know some of you weren't going to be happy unless the VP announcement was "Biden picks Sanders, drops out moments later," so maybe settle down and focus on reacting from a healthier place, or don't react at all.
Let's face it, the only person Biden could have chosen that is going to satisfy the Bernie or Busters is Bernie himself.  I expect endless "Harris is a cop" for the next four years, regardless of who wins thebelection.

I am completely with both of you. Let’s take back our country, and show the world that the United States is real, and ready to lead our world again! Vote Biden and Harris, 2020!
oh yeah, i just meant tried to change how the public sees her. i don't trust people that change their views like that and i don't trust her. don't trust biden either. i hate that i'm in a position where voting for them is a necessity.
Harris is super qualified, a woman, a minority, and basically shoots down the whole "the left is against the existence of police" thing the GOP wants to use. And she &amp; Biden will have the most liberal Democratic platform seen in several decades.

I've heard it talked about, but what are the odds of a last minute dump of Pence from the Republican ticket, given Biden's pick of Harris for VP? #BidenHarris2020
I see it less as voting for biden, but more voting to throw away a big orange piece of trash.

Bernie Sanders has backed Biden to the hilt when he could very easily either gone silent, self-aggrandized, gone third party run; but he didn’t do any ot those things because it’s not in his character, since he gives a damn and has gone out of his way to avoid being a spoiler
Thank you.  It’s getting so annoying hearing not only people on Twitter but the news media talking about Kamala’s 2024 run.  Biden has said it depends on his health.  Let him decide first.  Give him the respect and benefit of the doubt first-then-celebrate her potential run.
Yeah, personally I consider giving up on giving everyone healthcare, maintaining a habitable planet and trying to ensure that people don't live in misery the true surrender.  The Trump/Biden fight really isn't that relevant to those struggles.

Criticizing Biden for not taking questions from the press makes a part of me more pro-Biden. Same with his at best mediocre academic record.
Biden-Harris is the first Democratic ticket since 1984 where neither the Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate has an Ivy League degree.
Biden’s public option would expand healthcare coverage in the United States, he has spoken in support of a $15 minimum wage, and his climate change plan has garnered praise even from leftist groups that opposed him in the primary.

Opinion | How Jennifer O’Malley Dillon transformed Joe Biden’s campaign  #SmartWomenGetItDone
But seriously...what I love is that the ENTIRE Biden campaign is premised on appealing to suburban moderates.  Guess they've decided to accomplish that through simply showing off how much they hate the left.
I never have. But the thing Biden has done that solidified it the most this cycle was him telling his oligarchic donors "nothing will fundamentally change."
This is exactly right. Biden’s handlers are pushing one message: “He’s  not Trump.”  Historically, it’s not a winning strategy, but it’s all they have. They don’t dare pull back the curtain and risk letting America know what they’re really about.

Same Marquette poll has Biden leading Inds by 12 % and among moderates by THIRTY FIVE points.   Trump won Inds in 2016 by ten points and lost moderates by only 10 points.  So even assuming it's another low-Dem turnout year, Trump still flailing much more than this poll shows.

I don't care for fundamentals. A lot of people believe this is what drives the market.   SO what could happen here in the USA that would for weeks continuously drive the market down?   A Trump loss to Biden and or the death of a President in Office.
I once believed that things were going well under Trump, and who came after would be a problem for our Nation.   I believed Trump would die in office. Enter Pandemic I don't believe Trump will be reelected. I don't believe Biden will make it thru his first term.
I'm one of those people with views on both sides of the table, so I do have issues with a Biden Presidency.   I appreciate the adult conversation.

So you do think that Biden is a stalking horse for communism? Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., that Joe Biden?

Man, I'm hardly the first one to say it, but how I wish that we lived in the world of Republican imagination. In that world, Bernie Sanders is a Marxist and AOC somehow controls Pelosi, while Biden is actually a stalking horse for communism.
Even liberals seem willing to admit electing down ballot Dems isn’t going to stop trump which seems to posit that democrats as a whole suck lots of ass. Nobody is like “if you won’t vote Biden make sure to flip the house and senate” they’re like “eat shit vote trump fuck you”
But you have hit on a key point, as a I noted elsewhere in this thread. Our country's political system is such a failure that it saw fit to offer us Clinton v Trump four years ago, and Biden v Trump today.   At least Bernie vs Rick Santorum would've been interesting.
Biden's not a pathological liar; I used that term advisedly, rather than hyperbolically. Trump is congenitally incapable of telling the truth, when a lie will do. Look at his interview with Wallace, in which he made up that horseshit about the MOCA and how amazed his MDs were.
I’m all for Biden for the reasons you’ve described, but I’m concerned for chances to move forward when this is how progressives are seen by the party.
The rest is of this thread is not helping my case on blanket stamenets and twitter vs reality here.   I think there’s a middle ground between blind vote and pointing out obvious flaws. There does need to be accountability. Biden isn’t great but he’s not bad.
Joe Biden is pulling a Hillary and dodging Wisconsin entirely, refusing to accept the party's nomination in Milwaukee, so naturally President Trump is taking full advantage of the absence. 😎
Trump is a racist because of all the things he says and does. Joe Biden is also a racist, but he's not as bad as Trump because he isn't also a career criminal, a pathological liar, or a man completely ignorant of the important issues of the day.
Did you reach out to anyone in the  like  or  - you know, the actual left - for their view on Kamala Harris and Joe Biden? Or just Democrats?
I hate Biden, love this scenario.
If you are happily voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris you are NOT an ally I promise
Biden is a racist, after all, he opposed integration. But he's no where near as bad as Trump.  It's a huge indictment of our moribund political system that the choices we were offered in 2016 were Clinton and Trump, and the choices we're offered in 2020 are Biden and Trump.
I’m no Biden/Harris fan, but it clearly says what they are signing
Does it even matter? I never like anybody that I work with and it doesn’t alter our ability to get the job done because that’s what adults do. Obama and Biden were adults doing a job.
DO you ever stop talking and tweeting? It's like this constant diarrhea of the mouth.  God, I hope Biden wins just so you will just SHUT UP for a minute. Nobody believes a word you say, it's just BLAH BLAH BLAH all day every day.
I believe if Biden wins, his speech will focus on a return to the way things were in 2015 and restoring ‘honor to the Oval Office’. Also probably some lip service to making things a bit better for women and letting Kamala take it from there.
Sadly, Biden does mot plan on offering free college. Here is a link to the complicated plan to make college affordable, not free.

In contrast, Joe Biden has been married twice, and it's because his first wife was killed in a horrific car crash, along with one of his children. To the best of our knowledge, he never cheated on either woman.  His ideology sucks, but his personal ethics are miles better.
I'm the dork who fills out literally every single survey that Joe Biden's campaign sends to me, and though I'm fully aware they are all ploys to get me to donate, I am a lil heartened when they include questions about how the Democratic primary has impacted party unity
You don't think Joe Biden sucks? Or you don't think he's better than Trump?

You are exactly the reason why I am so tempted to not vote Biden in a swing state. If you want Biden to win, you should probably not talk to leftists until after the election.  Otherwise you are just working to elect Trump.
Of course it's about race. Just like Joe Biden being against bussing was about race, being against low income housing is about race as well. You're smart enough to recognize that I'm sure.
82% of Americans would see their taxes go up under the Joe Biden tax plan!
Sean Swain 2020, your lucky I’m even voting AT ALL. A vote for trump or Biden is a vote against Swain.
At least we wont be voting for Trump or Biden
Oh I have an idea. Biden could earn my vote by supporting M4all and green new deal instead of with fearmongering.

This is no longer just a story. This is a 5 alarm fire. Congress must go to court or Biden campaign -anyone who has standing. Do it now to establish voting integrity for mail in voting
I’m not making this up, Biden credits Obama for it!  Not kidding!!!
U yell at Biden again lol or Sam
If the universe were just, everyone who voted for Trump would have their hands fall off from necrosis while everyone who votes Biden would have only two of their fingers fall off from necrosis.

Biden/Harris 2020: "Marginally better than Clinton/Kaine 2016 but in worse circumstances."  Most accurate campaign slogan I can come up with for them.
A) Biden/Harris 2020 B) Trump/Pence 2020 C) Torches/Pitchforks 2020  Now THAT is an easy decision.
So let me get this right... a second generation immigrant (Trump) is questioning the right of a second generation immigrant (Harris) to run for Vice President??? OMG! What an a-hole!

I knew since day 1 that Biden would pick Harris. They’ve always been simpatico.
Fox poll, Biden 49, Trump 42.
A nationwide mandate is not an answer to anybody's problem. It's an exercise in government control, and the capacity for the American People to be sheep to their government. Some people should wear masks, others it's not necessary. Biden doesn't trust people to do the right thing
Who else is planning on voting for Biden and Harris in 2020? Show support here!
Biden at 49 to 50 % in most polls; not a lot of margin for tightening
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.

"Something's going to happen to Joe Biden"? Where do you come up with this witless, baseless BS? Do you write it yourself or do you have some kind of insane bookshelf demon whispering in your ear?
Biden wants every governor to mandate masks and said everyone should wear one for the next three months "at a minimum."
Similar to President Trump trying to ruin Hunter Biden's life and the lives of his family?
Seems like a lot of room for Biden growth by discussion his policy positions and plans for economic growth and restoring our economy.
Libs are at the throats of lefties who are still busters (I am voting Biden) but why not use your energy to court the 45% of the population that doesn't vote?  Perhaps you can convince them that electing Joe Biden will bring some kind of change to their life 🤪

Yep, none of those answers given best explain how Trump and his policy are an existential threat to this democracy. I spend a lot of time thinking about policy, I like a lot of Biden policies, and NOT TRUMP would still be my number one motivator given the limited list.

“We must defeat Donald Trump, and we cannot do so with a candidate facing the allegations that Joe Biden is facing.” (3/3) #WeBelieveTaraReade #MeTooNotPolitics
He has contributed millions to the DNC, 18 million I believe, and is donating to down ballot races. It was decided by all parties involved to not involve his media Team. But some, as individuals, moved over to Biden.
and as opposed to Biden et al, Obama was actually really good at politics. he could convince those to his left to give him more time and breathing space
I seriously think President Biden should make you part of his team in whatever capacity.
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. “Hey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?” she asked. “Ready to work! Let’s go (Dr. Jill Biden)!” he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?

i love this piece! shout out to public universities! (especially the ones where i went to undergrad, grad school, and worked at, namely, UCSC, UW Seattle and UW-Madison)
the addendum here is that of course it's great and good and totally fine for people to try to influence biden/harris on policy, but a random DNC volunteer has as much poll as you do over the presidential platform, so you're wasting everyone's time trying to do it this way.
Can't wait for them to do a reverse on President Biden and blame him for  the deal collapsing a month or so into his term.
I’m not voting for Biden, and neither is Tara Reade. Lots of people won’t vote for him because of this.
i hear you, but there's a pretty wide gulf between, say, a voter responding with a really small, actionable, specific request, and another to be like "hey can you just get joe biden to change his opinion on the single-most contested policy from the primary."
they never actually cared  Biden made that more explicitly clear than anyone when he said "you should vote for Trump" and he's the guy they all decided to support

There’s zero chance Biden makes it 4 yrs!! Zero!! He’s already got dementia and they’re hidden his ass in a basement!! Hell they don’t even want to have debates against Trump!  I wouldn’t be shocked if they pushed her out to debate Trump!!  His a fragile old grumpy racist man
It follows trends, southwest rural areas are Biden. Northern and southeast are Trump.
Lmao now we can't even criticize Biden. Fall in line is just getting stupider.
Going to be quite a campaign. Biden telling us what he plans to do for the country. Trump telling us what terrible people his opponents are.
Choosing Kamala Harris is overtly a signal that Biden has no intention of doing a goddamn thing about police brutality.
Yeah I mean I’m fine with people voting Biden. I have a vote shamer in my tiny union at my job and me just blocking her from my life wouldn’t actually work lol so reverse vote shaming doesn’t interest me. But like for real Biden is dangerous. And his supporters also blind/cultish
Who Biden?? Are you kidding me?
EBL: Kamala Harris Believes Joe Biden's Accusers 🤷🏻‍♀️
So educate me on what Biden said that was racist
Biden gives us 4-8 years of Obama. 8 years of Obama brought us trump. So after Biden we will have a bigger fascist but this time it will be someone who isn’t going through dementia and we will all be killed by Tom Cotton. I’m not saying vote trump, do more than vote
As a socialist for life, I can tell you: I understand some "rose" folks' antipathy toward conservative Democrats, or why they might not want to vote for Biden. I don't feel that way, but understand why they do. BUT, any1 who votes for Trump is neither socialist nor even leftist.
How about Trump’s racist comments about President Barack Obama?  Remember that?  Please educate me on the Biden racist comments please
Basically the difference between trump and Biden is do we want fascism used abroad only or fascism used at home as well. As you may have noticed from years of Obama Biden expanding illegal wars to little protest, exporting fascism makes the fascism more palatable and last longer
U always have to be direct and truthful then u can make plans with the best people💙😷😷👂👁️👁️👂✊🖖💪✌️👍😁😷😷😷 BBC News - Joe Biden and Kamala Harris say Trump has left US 'in tatters'
At standing rock the police aimed a surface to air missile launcher at unarmed native Americans praying. idk what you think trump is doing that’s worse than using missiles as a threat against unarmed protestors but everything trump is doing was done under Biden or done worse
Who else is pissed Biden's platform does not include #M4A despite the vast majority of democratic voters' support?
If you think this is a supporter of your political opponent and this is how you talk to them instead of actually making a good faith attempt to critique their views and change their mind you are responsible for Biden’s loss more than trump voters. Go knock fucking doors.
If liberals think anybody is gonna get into the street to install Joe Biden to power you’re kidding yourself. If trump doesn’t cede power after the election y’all best start hitting the gun range cause I’m parking in my apartment and letting it play out I’m not dying for Biden.

Slobis76 please if Trump is a racist than his name would be smell me Biden and he would be a Democrat.  The only people that look down at people like me are lefties.  Extreme lefties.  Aoc is a poc of color as a monkey is a frog.
I'm disappointed the convention isn't doing more to promote its rising stars especially since Biden has described himself as a transition candidate and a bridge to the future. I'd rather hear from AOC, Castro, Abrams, etc, than John Kerry and Bill Clinton.

My father believes that “everyone knows” Biden will only make it a few months after elected. These conspiracy theories are wild!
It wasn't going to being me in for sure.  Just saying Harris wasn't even the second or third most progressive Senator who ran in the primary that could have been picked.  Yet gaslighters are busy saying she is the most progressive ever and Biden is FDR.
I don't like her, but she'll do well in the debates and won't cost Biden the election. She is perceived as fairly moderate. As an ex-prosecutor she will hurt Trump's ability to claim the mantle as the law and order candidate. She was a politically expedient pick.

“Biden’s candidacy is going to be nuts,” says a tweet from a dead man’s twitter account...
"I am no fan of Joe Biden" is perhaps the most polite way I can express that sentiment. I wish we had a better candidate who wasn't fucking creepy. Or as out of touch as HC was in 2016.
Make no mistake, I am no fan of Joe Biden, and I've got plenty to say about how I wish the candidates shook out this go around. But it's between a man who if elected, will make me fear for my life for the next four years and possibly beyond, and a man who very likely won't.
Excellent. Are you trying to say you're cruising on by because of other's hard work designing and building the metaphorical train, and Biden is doing his best to carry his own weight? Donny boy, I know you're big, and that's okay, but don't be mad you can't do it yourself.

Hi, as an actual Marxist that despises Biden/Harris, I can assure you that Kamala is neither Marxist nor even progressive, and wrt the article Marxists actually do generally prefer decentralized government and personal responsibility. We have more in common than you think!
Very good rundown of the differences between Biden and Harris's platforms/statements on criminal justice (Harris is almost always further left), and some predictions for where the combined platform might end up (especially in the current climate).
Girl something I’ve had to deal with all this craziness is that every politician is disappointing, and is quite honestly awful. I know it sucks, but I’m voting for the lesser of two evils. And unfortunately that is the Biden/Harris ticket. We also need a woman in the White House.
Biden and Harris pretend they are social distancing!  Fake at every level, as usual.
Yes, she has a problematic record as California's top cop. Biden has a more problematic record on a ton of things. I can't be overly concerned. I just want them to win.
You could have picked her and you went for Tim kaine then she met with the people who own you and now despite not winning a single delegate she’s going to be de facto president when Biden dies ensuring in 2024 we get a literal fascist

I know many on the left are not thrilled about Kamala. I understand she has a past with law enforcement that is problematic. I read a pretty good synopsis about Kamala on Joe Biden's website.

Oh yeah! Jill Biden is a class act that we can all be proud of .
So included in that 40 years is now, right? Are you saying Joe Biden is advocating cutting social security now?
Oh, thank you. I really feel off today. Like I need yet more sleep.  I am very pleased about Kamala. She is who I hoped Biden would pick.
We’re not Trump. Harris Biden 2020
"If you don't vote for Biden you've basically voted for Trump."  Reverse the names and let me know how that works for your argument.
Ok new plan: After Pres Biden and Kamala get sworn in, we advertise a big Trump rally under the guise of a Let's  Impeach B &amp; H rally...when they're at the point of evil frenzy we bag 'em and send them to their own little trump camp.  Im thinking Ga perhaps? They do not belong in
Kamala gets you no one. No one. It further alienates the left and doesn't draw from the right. Brilliant calculus. Biden just handed trump 4 more years!
Agh I already have this one with just Biden
I’d vote for biden before you and I would cut my arm off before voting for biden so what’s that tell you? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Excellent. This completely refutes and exposes Joe Biden as the pathetic, lying douchebag he is. Granted, there's absolutely not way he can beat Trump without being a degenerate liar and cheating all the time, so I guess we shouldn't expect any less.
Weird that Biden would be personally opposed to an essential healthcare service.  Or can the Catholic Left just agree once and for all to retire that lie?
You really know how to enrage women... more motivated than ever to send you out of office in November. Just donated again to the Biden campaign.

So what you're saying is, they're secretly planning on Biden stepping aside. 😂
Joe Biden is literally running on the most progressive platform a party nominee has ever had, I get the apprehension with regards to his record but what he is saying now is a lot of what I want to hear. #BidenHarris2020
What I hope they do: 1) Announce they understand that Biden is better than Trump but refuse to vote shame anyone.  2) Announce that they are organizing a protest for January 20 &amp; 21 regardless of who wins.  If that happens, I'm all in.
This wasn't phrased like a normal VP pick would have been. Only one President has ever "stepped aside" and it wasn't exactly by choice...it's not something Presidents normally do.  "if and when Biden decides to step aside." 🤔🤔🤔  Source:
Joe Biden is a bait and switch victim
CNN already leaked the plan for Biden to step aside.
Just listened to Biden and Harris speeches, surprised myself by crying at hearing a promise of moral, caring leadership. I’m beyond tired of Trump and his enablers and their platform of power and money for themselves.
"More united than ever" in the sense that virtually all of the left will be voting for Biden to get Trump out of office. After this November, we may be looking at a different picture.
Would you mind telling that to Biden and Harris?

Immediately after being sworn in, Joe Biden orders the military to gun down the entire Supreme Court, then appoints nine beautiful thirtysomething female justices of various ethnicities. "Clean slate," he grunts in a Rorschach voice.

I saw an acquaintance say the other day that she was still undecided as to who to vote for in November. How is this even possible?  I figured either you vote for Biden or you just admit you're a racist piece of shit. There's really no "oh gee, I could be kind of racist"
Biden isn't going to do shit about climate change and that is going to kill way more people than Covid. We need someone who isn't beholden to corporate overlords.
Thanks man! I was on the fence about voting for Biden, but this really gave me the clarity to realize that I will not.
How about your guy put Biden on the spot by releasing his tax returns and agreeing to real-time fact-checking during the debate?
In a tweet that could preview their message, Biden tweeted Wednesday morning that if he and Harris win, "we're going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. We won't have a minute to waste."
lol. We want M4All and Green New Deal. Joe Biden is a corporate shill. So no, I won't 'fall in line'. Democrats offer me nothing.
Biden isnt going left but everyone else that works under him will
Obviously it doesn't change anything for me, but Biden's ability to hide over the last few months has certainly helped him. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to the primaries and will finally see him on display (likely getting walked by Trump).
If the Kennedy twerp unseats Markey, I hope Biden offers him a cabinet spot.

Biden is white. Youre white. Leah's white. You're all dunces. My narrative is in tact.
Trump care about the rich and racist Biden care about the ignorant and dumb they both terrible but you have to pick the lesser of two evils again
Will Harris help or hurt? The Biden camp has had the magnifying glass out for months to study that question, and has apparently come up with its answer.  Read about how progressives are weighing the pros and cons of  VP pick
Also, if you paid any attention, Kamala ripped into Biden for his part actions during his time to his face during the debate. That's one reason why we were shown he has changed. He forgave her, agreed that he erred, and chose her as his running mate.
How many doors have you knocked for Biden? 0? Must be a trump supporter since you aren’t fighting for Biden. How many times have you hit the gun range to train to shoot fascists if they take to the street with guns and trump refuses to concede? Zero? Must be a trump supporter
I like this. She and Joe could host different experts to highlight what a Biden administration would look like.  Potential cabinet appointees, health experts, trade experts, school experts, environmental experts.  End each event with 2016 Trump voter who is now a Biden supporter.
Biden literally grabbed a pussy.  Don’t forget that!!!  Eventually everyone sees the light!  Congratulations.  It’s your time!!!
I feel like I can hear this A1 saying, " And Biden announced his VP? Sure. Fine. Whatever"
The senate couldn't pass Obamacare with 60 dems! Trump couldn't overturn it with his majority!  Rapid change is really, really hard to make in our legislative system — and one thing I am confident in is that Biden &amp; Harris are going to respect separation of powers.
If Trump wants to understand  why Wisconsin women will be voting for Vice President Biden and Democrats up and down the ticket, he should watch our Convention.
I am not at all comfortable counting Wisconsin in the Biden column. Not sure about the others, but gonna be close, for sure.
Tucker Carlson calls Biden-Harris the 'first entirely hollow presidential ticket in American history' | Fox News
For when you come across a Republican desperately trying to convince voters that Joe Biden will somehow be worse for our country than Trump...
Honestly, a slow progression towards the destruction of our world isn’t preferable than a quick decent under trump. Things need tremendous attention right now and Biden is a bandaid to a fatal gun shot wound.
This is why Biden picked  Harris was widely expected to be the pick, so  had MONTHS to generate oppo talking points against her. This is the absolute best they have.  #Kamala
Who made racist and misogynistic social media posts in the past six hours?   Hint:  it wasn’t Biden.    You cannot trust Donald Trump.  He has already killed 160,000 Americans through incompetence. What happens when his hair trigger temper goes off when his hand is on the button?
And having a woman on the ticket gives Biden Bros a convenient scapegoat when they lose. “I guess some people aren’t ready to vote for a woman.” Blame the voters, not the candidate.
Joe Biden is Catholic *but even if he weren't* &amp; he worshipped a dried apple sculpture that won 3rd place at the State Fair he'd still be closer to Christian than Donald Trump (who gassed peaceful protesters to hold a photo op OUTSIDE a church, w/ a random, upside down Bible).
Ummm....isn't Biden Catholic...??
Oh, we’re talking about Biden. I thought we were talking about your candidate - who hides in an underground bunker and tweets everything from his VP pick to your eventual firing.
Translation: if you elect Joe Biden, black people will move into your neighborhood
This being said, I am actually gonna vote for Biden/Harris 🤡😭
Biden. Or Stacey.  Really.  ? Elvis.    Trump 2020.
Undoubtedly it will be a close race in the Electoral College, although Biden will win popular vote.  What I am unsure of is the underlying methodology of the polls averaged.  In 2016, we learned, they undercounted non-college whites.  Do the 2020 polls fix this skew?
I third this.  Just gotta our women in charge...which Biden isn’t afraid of! #BidenHarris2020
I want a tee shirt that say’s, “I’m a NASTY Woman” on the front and Biden/Harris in the back.
Everyone is joking about voting for kanye right? Like haha but we're all still voting for Biden/Harris
Allan Lichtman has predicted every president since 84 correctly and is going with Joe Biden.
Joe and Kamala are a great team!  It is unfortunate that they won’t attend tonight’s Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee to introduce Kamala as Biden’s VP pick to the rest of the country.  Joe and Kamala need to visit Wisconsin soon and not repeat Hillary’s 2016 mistake.
Biden is Catholic so Tobin is jeering in his tweet
I think this is a good day to donate to the Biden-Harris ticket!!!
Biden/Harris2020 - We’ll have Planned Parenthood do it.
I think every week or so between now and the election, Biden should announce a new cabinet member.  - makes people think of him as already President - allows the media to contrast his picks with the garbage fires there now - let's start with Betsy DeVos
That's Clinton. I don't see anything to do with Biden or Harris. Nice try but you failed.
“If we lie to our model and tell it that the election is going to be held today. It spits out that Biden has a 93 percent chance of winning. In other words, a Trump victory would require a much bigger polling error than what we saw in 2016.” #StayFocused
The problem with this stand is that come January, we're all going to be eating the same dish, and "none of this" is not one of the options on the menu.  Bush v Kerry? Obama v McCain? Sure. We'd be okay either way.  Trump v Biden? I genuinely don't think so.
"Law-and-Order Baggage" ( ?!)
I haven’t read anything that has convinced me that Biden has raped anyone, so I don’t believe I am voting for a rapist. I do believe the writings of Timothy Snyder, Masha Gessen and Jason Stanley, which lead me to believe that if I want to live in a democracy T must be defeated.
The idea that Biden is beholden to the far left seems like desperate straining.
Like I'm just supposed to assume that he's implying Biden will be in a wheelchair
Here’s the thing.  Think of the election like a coin flip that’s weighted a tad towards Biden. (For now)  We aren’t flipping the coin 100 times.   It’s only being flipped 1 time. Trump could absolutely win this thing. To think otherwise is stupid.
A sober and objective accounting of Biden’s record as an elected official recognizes the unique responsibility he bears for our current moment. It’s not the left that’s confused by this!
Wow. The bishop of Providence, RI doesn't know that Joe Biden is Catholic.  But then he didn't think it was his job to report his diocesan priest sex abusers. Sad.
This suburban housewife can’t cook but she’s voting for Biden.
Was joe Biden raised Catholic? Yes. Are his views in line with the Catholic faith or does he practice his faith? Absolutely NOT

HAPPENING TODAY: Joe Biden and his newly announced running mate Kamala Harris will deliver remarks together in Wilmington, Delaware.  #WakeUpWi #WKOW
I don't like Kamala as Biden's VP candidate. I LOVE Kamala as the next Vice President of the United States. I'm a guy, and I am thrilled about this. At last, after almost four years of hell, a glimmer of hope!
This idea of Joe Biden as a "far left stooge" isn't sticking, because that's just not who Joe is; people can sense it even if they don't know him.  I think "Dementia Joe" will also fall away after the first debate.  What else do they have? Nothing.
Well see if u would of said this first instead of just Nah I would of said that ur one of the good ones lol. While we might disagree on Biden/Harris is better for the country we can agree on this
She was totally angling to be Biden's VP dude she would have left Sanders in the dust no matter what
Still believe the Biden accusers??
Wisconsin Democrats react to Biden-Harris ticket. via
You can't say defund the police and also support Harris (and Biden). Stop making excuses for their Bullshit. Hold them accountable like you wanna hold Trump accountable.
Forces him to be better?  Really     I think Biden was perfectly fine yesterday, and will be perfectly fine tomorrow.  Such an insult to Biden &amp; in turn,     Or did Biden FORCE Obama to be better too?   This is why I don’t want you or your network.
I love this.  The same ppl who talk of how Kamala is so progressive are the same ones who said Biden is so moderate.    News Flash: They both are centrists.  Always have been.  Sorry to disappoint.    #BidenHarris2020
If I see a YesWeKam hashtag again i will literally 🤮  I love Kamala.  Nothing to do with her, but lets remember this is Joe Biden running for President.... hopefully for 8 years.  Not a Kamala Harris 2024 Campaign.   #BidenHarris2020
Spoiler: Doesn’t help or hurt.  People will vote based on Biden and Biden only.  A few outliers on Twitter might be the exception, but I agree.  I like her-always have-but I would vote Biden no matter who he chose.  #BidenHarris2020 #BidenVP
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : Joe Biden has named his running mate in the 2020 presidential race, just days before start of Democratic National Convention
it really be feeling like this election is the worst i keep telling myself there is differences between trump and biden but like rly is there i freaking hate both of them ahhhhhhhhh both completely auth right IDKKKK

Harris is pragmatic and competamt and mirrores the face of the nation. Fox News can run their absurd programming but Biden and Harris are soon to govern from the White House.
Wet Ass President-Elect-Biden
The latest Marquette poll of Wisconsin came out today and included this heartening table. In other news,  is bad at politics.
Yep, first time I made a donation to Biden was today
But if you truly know what Jesus was really like, he'd probably hold up a Biden/Harris sign.
Four debates. First Harris/Pence, second Biden/Pence, third Harris/Trump, fourth Biden/Trump
Kamala Harris is a transphobic cop haha vote for Biden still tho please
If it gets Trump out I’m ok. I also think Biden will be a 1 term President and We the People need to get busy organizing for the future! #GreenNewDeal
I spoke to the local  chapter about  joining the Biden ticket.   Pres. Greg Jones: “More than anything else, this decision says this country can live up to it’s creed that all Americans are created equal.... Biden didn't forget the legacy of African Americans."
((JUST SO WE ARE CLEAR i am voting for biden because i don’t really have any other choice lol it is just sad that that’s the case and is hard to think about how different things could be...not to dwell on da past or anything but it’s tough to swallow sometimes))
I voted Warren in the primary. I bought a shirt. A NICE shirt. But Harris is the right pick for several reasons: 1) she sparred hard w/Biden in primaries and the choice says a lot 2) as a former AG she can cut through GOP legal bullshit, 3) wary abt two 70-somethings on a ticket.
I’ve been waiting for this announcement to buy my Biden yard sign and bumper sticker. Might have gone overboard with a few other things
Yay! Great! Biden chooses a Veep nominee who is disliked by the Right AND the Left. Woo hoo. Thanks for four more years of Trump you idiot Corporate Dems.
I guess Scott Walker, Trump sycophant, missed the Bible studies on forgiveness.     Once again, Joe Biden shows that he doesn't harbor a fleet of grudges, unlike our #tweeterinchief
For anyone who thinks your proving something by not voting for Biden, think again, esp if you aren’t personally busting your ass at lower levels of politics. A vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for the acitivists working their asses off to push Dems  left. Read: #BidenHarris2020
Biden is 77 and has borderline dimentia. I don’t think we’ll have to wait until 2024
People can joke about Biden securing California but is there any data on whether a VPs home state effects winning said state? Like where the fuck was Tim Kaine from, and did Clinton win there???
Didn’t Hunter work for a “big bank” out of Delaware?  Playing the banks for everything you can!  Has a bank ever donated to a Joe Biden campaign?  Yes; so don’t make banks the villains when you accept $ from them.
Fun fact: approximately half of American Catholics will vote for Joe Biden in November. #CatholicTwitter
If Biden had picked Trump as VP, it still would have been better.
That's why he's backing Biden and making me say to him,  "OK, Boomer."  Got it.
I'm already counting on Biden 4- Harris- 8...probably need that much time make a dent in the mess we are in
Can people discussing settling for Biden/ not voting for Biden explain to me who you think is going to win the presidency if it’s not Trump or Biden. I don’t like Biden but I’m genuinely curious as to why people think our electoral college system is going to allow anyone else
President Trump was asked about Joe Biden's Vice Presidential pick, Sen. Kamala Harris at this evening's coronavirus press briefing. He said, "...we’ll see how she works out. She did very, very poorly in the primaries..." and that he was "a little surprised that he picked her."
She was picked because Antifa/BLM (who run the Democrat Party) know they can walk all over her, and assert their insane will on the American People once she is in office (not like Biden will be there long)
Ummm, her exact quote began, "I will direct this at vice president Biden, I do not believe you are a racist..."  That is kind of the opposite smearing him as racist.  What a startling lack of knowledge, or manipulation of a message to get clicks.
(Biden beat Sanders 55-40 in Dane County in April but I'd guess Sanders did better within SD26.)
Three Madison wards in (70,73,77).  Roys/Nada well &gt; Biden/Sanders in all three.
Kamala will destroy Pence but Trump is gonna bully Biden bad in the debates #BidenHarris #TrumpFailedAmerica
Let's see...  Trump/Pence want to arrest me for supporting antifa over oligarchy.  Biden/Harris want to arrest me for supporting antifa over oligarchy.  Decisions, decisions.
Bwahahahahahahahaha!!!  (This pick means that Biden wants to keep Mnuchin on as Secretary of Treasury.)
In all three polls, Trump earns largely negative reviews for his handling of the presidency.
Let's! I am for Biden &amp; Harris!
Look, if you can get close to Biden for a few minutes and tell a plotless story about growing up in central Pennsylvania, you're in.
Presumably because Biden has chosen his running mate, people on my TL are coming out of the woodwork to say that they'll watch the debates even though their minds are already made up.  Nobody's undecided this far into any presidential election cycle if they're paying attention.
I was hoping for Joe Biden to pick  really wanted a new gym twerking video. 🤤   Guess I'll just have to go watch this one a few more times. 😏
Shitlibs: "Don't nominate Bernie, they will call him a socialist."  The left: "They'll call anyone that. At least nominate someone who excites people."  Shitlibs: "No, you toxic, divisive Bernie Bros."  The right: "Biden and Harris are Marxists who want to kill God."
I am SO glad Biden didn't pick Susan Rice.
Wisconsin Democrats applaud Joe Biden's selection of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate while opponents call it a radical decision.
Yah. Biden’s pick is important, but also somewhat irrelevant. Anyone who changes their mind on voting for Biden this year based on his VP pick is a dolt
Timcast IRL -  Biden Picked Kamala Harris As VP And The Internet Can't S...  via
I will give them this:  "Biden/Harris"   looks better on a yard sign than  "Biden/🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍"
Harris pointedly let Mnuchin off the hook for his fraud during the mortgage crisis.   Does the pick mean Biden is planning on "turning the page" on Trump and letting them all off the hook if they win?  I think so.
***sigh***  Usually love you, Mark, but I just can't care about a Biden/Harris ticket.  Push them to give me something positive to care about besides "not Trump."
Biden isn't an autocrat though. 😔
Biden/Harris  Let’s put AA out of business...
Biden was my last choice but if you told me Biden's running mate was a clone of Biden, but with a wig and a falsetto, I would vote for Biden/Biden over Trump or anything the GOP has to offer even if Trump's Big Mac and Adderall caught up to him.  #ALLin #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
FOX NEWS: "Biden trying to remove the only African American female from the US Senate"Yes. Once Biden is elected and we flip the Senate, we need to let Congress know that the USPS serves us and while efficiencies needs to be looked at, we don't expect to make a profit.
Considering Donald Trump and Joe Biden are on live tv almost everyday and will be for the next 3 months, I’d say Lou Holtz is the least of our worries.
Don’t worry, Biden and Harris will win so we won’t have to worry about Dumb and Dumber anymore.
The fact that a Fox poll shows more of the liberal vote share locked in for Biden than the conservative vote locked in for Trump says a lot.
Mayor Barry Presgraves of Luray, Virginia posted on his Facebook: “Joe Biden just announced Aunt Jemima as his running mate.” This horrific RACIST refusing to resign, only removed his comment from his Facebook!! He thinks that’s all it takes? Remove your NASTY comment? I am I’ll!
One, two Biden and Harris are coming for you.  Three, four better lock your door.  #BidenHarris2020Landslide #KamalaHarrisVP #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I’m voting for Biden in case my othervteeet confused you
Watching Twitter explode about how nice it is that a #POTUS nominee can speak in complete sentences is hysterical considering Biden is the worst speaker of the bunch. It’s truly infuriating
Exactly! Vote Biden/ Harris, they undo the damage Trump did and start working towards Medicare For All, climate change, college affordability, etc. If Trump wins again, progressive reform is not happening
Biden also lost presidential primaries before *checks notes* being the vice president raised his profile
Meh. Biden kinda sucks and you're just along for the ride. I'm voting for Biden because it's really the only choice. Don't fuck it up
Biden has been the only one to mention a plan to try and fix the divide in America between races. Donald Trump has only stood up for one race. The white population.
Lmao if you thought I wasn’t voting for Biden before I’m sure as hell not now
This poll is such gibberish Twitter asked me if it needed translating. How are they gonna put Biden +6 in AZ but only +3 in MN?
trump ain’t got shit on Joe and I watch these ads on tv saying he will defund the police and the commercial shows Biden saying one word and that’s it its a lie he has no integrity if he lies on a ad come to show what else he lieing about
My favorite Joe Biden thing ever was him completely thrashing Paul Ryan in the 2012 debates
a possible #VPPick for
Agreed similarly I think especially with black voters: some  may only want to vote black (and there does seem to be slightly softer support among black voters for Biden then in the primary) but overall I think this is clearly part of the Trump electoral college strategy
