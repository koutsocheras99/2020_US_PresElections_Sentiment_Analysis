Let's hope so. Putin's boys are hard at work to hurt Joe Biden and Trump Toadies like Ron Johnson and Lady G are in on it I'm sure
Oh no we‚Äôre about to see more ‚ÄúDemocrats would be a center-right party in Europe‚Äù takes (apparently Labourites haven‚Äôt gotten the message from the hard Twitter left that Biden is evil or there‚Äôd be more don‚Äôt know)
The "Who Will be Joe's VP" and in his cabinet parlor game is fun, but who will be his chief of staff, if elected? My guy is Hakeen Jeffires. #Biden
This picture alone shows part of what is wrong w/biden. Where is the average american? Lame.  you have no idea what's going on or what's coming.
I don't think.Susan Rice is the best pick, tho I admire her.  Joe Biden should choose the person he can work best with.
We can do both with a President Biden.  Any of the VP candidates can be part of both intl &amp; natl work ahead.  They are all light years better than the current president.
I‚Äôd vote for Biden if he picked Don Trump Jr or even Don Trump Sr.
Nothing to debate. Trump is out there working while Biden is in his basement trying to fix what he messed up on. Sorry to say but he reminds me of when my father had dementia/Alzheimer‚Äôs, some good days but mostly bad days.
"For moderates like me who are looking for reasons to vote for Biden, we need to know who‚Äôs on that ticket, and soon."  If only there were a gargantuan orange REASON to vote for Biden.
3 years of Trump's vile absurdities.  We're done Hugh. Jie Biden is a decent intelligent capable man who makes gaffes. Trump is a chaotic lying disaster who operates by insults and division. He doesn't think so well. See you Nov 3.
So, Biden is the canonical burrito that God can theoretically microwave so hot that He burns Himself?
Biden's policies put America first and Trump org last.  Nice try, tho.
I‚Äôm sorry but Joe Biden, God Killer is just straight up more appealing than Joe Biden, Likes Trains!.
Like when people make a huge deal about  man saying illegal immigrants were all rapists and murderers when he never ever said that? A lie that Biden promotes. Or when the guy is acused,of mocking a reporters handicap when he provably was not?
Don‚Äôt need to attack- Biden‚Äôs doing that all by himself-you FAKE NEWS hack.
Actually, Biden wants to give more money to police.
Still on the fence? How is that even possible for a thoughtful reasonable adult?  Biden could throw a turd in a ziploc baggie and call it his VP pick and I'll still be voting for him.  A crazed Biden beats what we have now hands down.
For the love of Mike! WH is worrying now about Trump looking corrupt? That's funny. GOP is insane if it nominates him again. Of course, Dems are giving someone the nomination because it is their turn, because that worked so well in 2016, 2004, 2000, 1984.
please let us know if Biden hurts youüòá
why? its legit observation. We've got Cubans Mexicans  Guatemalans Brazilians El Salvadorians etc. Most Blacks are dems but Hispanic com. is split.. My ex is Cuban and his circle in miami love trump. TRUMP IS A LIAR yet we should feel shame whenever Biden says something?? Fuckoff
Biden was wrong but Trump has no right to comment on this? He has said worse and we know it. I‚Äôd still vote Joe! Does that make me the Biden version like a Trump loyalist? Nah - I admitted Biden was wrong.
I don‚Äôt know but I definitely want Biden as my President if he can.
Uh, this is from the 107th Congress. Biden is not currently a member of Congress so couldn't vote on current legislation.
President Biden will put  Americans first. Cheeto von Tweeto puts himself first.
How do you feel about big money in politics? Biden's voting record shows a fight against that for 50 years already  (he hasn't unilaterally disarmed because that doesn't work vs Republicans)
You a union guy? NLRB will be so much better with Biden people there, people will win a lot more organizing campaigns
Fact check: Trump makes at least 19 false and misleading claims in wild anti-Biden monologue - CNNPolitics -
Love your feed. Since I know you are a reader, and others may find this interesting, too, good story about Biden and overcoming stuttering as a kid. #Motown baby!
Don‚Äôt worry about but for sure when Biden takes office lot of this administration will be subpoenaed and best of all lot in jail.
Dear Lincoln Project: When should we expect the Biden will "hurt the Bible, hurt God" ad?  Can't wait.  #notmypresident
Well I‚Äôd like to see ol Joey Biden wriggle his way outta this one
‚ÄúLook, I get that the other guy is dumb, misogynistic, bigoted, and a danger to global piece...but Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt ‚Äòwowed‚Äô me enough.‚Äù üôÑ
As to who might publish your op ed, I‚Äôd suggest   publication.   ( Do you think  would be interested in an op-ed written by a retired USA colonel/former-Republican turned Democrat/Biden supporter?)
I‚Äôd vote for Biden over Trump even if Biden were on life support.
Of the major candidates who are being discussed, which candidates, if chosen, will cause you to *not* vote for Biden and why?
This thread resonates with me so much &gt;&gt; I'm all in for #BidenWarren2020. But this is one job where, as Biden reportedly called it, simpatico, is important. Who does he feel he can lead best with? That's not insignificant.
He still means it - because Biden has and will always exclusively work for his donors. That's his entire career.   Ego and power are not in the equation? For a candidate who has run for President so many times? Along with being forced out of one run for plagiarism and lying? LOL
They didn't think they needed a "stop Trump" think tank. The party thought there was no way he could win. It was a disastrous and deadly mistake, and voting for anyone but Biden in November would also be a disastrous mistake.
A politician that saw the writing on the wall and was forced to listen and compromise - because other peoples suffering are theoretical. It's why he told Wall Street privately that "nothing will fundamentally change". Because he just cares about his own ego and power. Thats Biden
Biden is broken in half lol
Biden v Jesus.   Hell In A... oh, wait.
Biden plaza is their most famous landmark (previously known as the Delaware House
Biden is more powerful than I thought.
You mean when Biden called Thailand Thigh land?   Oops!  That was Pr Trump.    Please get the president some nookie.
One more note on this. The ONLY reason Biden is even citing universal coverage and other things - is because of leftists demands. Neolibs and the donors do NOT want these policies. So continuing to push the "purity issue" (read: good policy) - is what has made the difference.
How does that negate anything  wrote? It doesn't - just because the other guy is bowl of shit doesn't make moldy Biden sandwich have less mold. Both are true at the same time.
Vote for JOE BIDEN                    2020
Good - I want Trump gone. That doesn't remove what Biden said. He thinks the black community isn't diverse and is a monolith in thought and action. It's an embarrassing thing to say for a 2020 candidate, along with his #BLM response being to increase police funding. What a joke.
Also - It isn't a bad thing to want the best candidate. This purity test nonsense is about the donor class that rules the DNC being concerned about real change happening. Biden will not fundamentally change anything for the better. Just a fact. Obama didn't - Biden def won't.
Sigh - once again. More Bernie voters voted for Clinton, then Clinton voters voted for Obama. Stop falling for false narratives.   Bernie voters simply complain because Biden and Establishment Dems are -TRULY TERRIBLE-. Just look at what Biden said today about the black community
100%  I also laughed at the Biden pick reference.
The next campaign ad will be the camera panning over black and white still images of Joe Biden while Wesley Willis' "I Wupped Batman's Ass" plays in the background. #politics
No... frankly I stopped paying attention to Biden now that the primary is over. That‚Äôs just... sigh. It‚Äôs so embarrassing and exactly why I was so adamant Dems shouldn‚Äôt choose him. But here we are.
No, he will just accused Biden of killing God! Sick.
Honestly Trump makes Biden sound much cooler than he actually is
‚ÄúYou want to know which branch of Christianity I follow? It‚Äôs the one that believes in an all-powerful God who is weak enough to be punched in the face by Joe Biden‚Äù
I expect Biden to do better than Obama in KY (better fit for state, almost all polls show him outperforming Obama), but only time will tell!
Oh god - what did Biden say today?
This Biden guy is certainly taking black guys for granted!
Joe Biden stop opening his mouth and sounding stupid challenge
I prefer Biden to be elected because Trump is so atrocious, but he gets no honeymoon and all progressives better bring a world of pressure on him day 1
That Biden car ad is good and will appeal to normies
he's just tiring, come on Biden take the wheel you goofy bastard.
Energy &amp; Jobs: Biden
Biden on Jobs
As opposed to Biden?
Wow who knew Biden didn‚Äôt want to tax capital gains as income
I want Trump out of office next year, can someone tie Biden up, lock him in the basement and cut his internet? I don't mind if it is a kidnapping....
Fact check: Trump makes at least 20 false claims in Fox &amp; Friends interview
Biden we know you're not nearly as much better than Trump as you should be but you really do not have to rub it in
Trump: I‚Äôm going to give the worst interview in the history of insane interviews. Biden: Hold my beer.
So, uh, is Biden admitting here to plotting with the Chinese to destroy America‚Äôs economy? Because I can‚Äôt see any other way to interpret this tweet. #CovidFacts #HighTreason
Yes,  ‚Äòs VP needs to be  or I‚Äôm basically all in no mercy #MAGA!   If Biden chooses my mayor, I‚Äôll play nice! That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got!

Joe Biden's next home will be the White House.  He's going to take those fences down.
You‚Äôve literally shown this ONE clip like 3 or 4 times, now.   Maybe you should come up with some solid policies. Policies OTHER THAN ‚ÄúLet COVID kill thousands and thousand of people‚Äù.  That‚Äôs what‚Äôs sinking your father‚Äôs campaign. Not Biden. Idiots.
CIA steers clear of Senate Republican probe into Bidens - POLITICO
The old relatable Biden has returned.
Mary Trump would make an intelligent VP for Biden
He closed travel from the China in JAN, and created the COVID task force in JAN, while no Dem-leaders were taking COVID seriously until March. The USA has tested more than all other countries in the world COMBINED thanks to Trump. You think dementia Biden would‚Äôve done better? üòÇ
Ronald Reagan was 69 when he became Pres.  8 yrs later he was 77. Younger than Biden is now!
Trump and his enablers call the Dems out for propping up Biden but have no issue with exploiting Kanye, whom his own family calls seriously mentally ill.
The incompetent and corrupt Democrat Biden always lied and spread rumors for personal gain. This is a crime!  Make America great again.  Vote for Trump in 2020!
Biden pushes back on cognitive test question: ‚ÄòWhy the hell would I take a test?'  - Excuse me, ‚ÄúMANNN‚Äù..but if this interview does not concern you, then you don‚Äôt care about the future of this great Nation. #testbidennow
Watch Trump's anger when he watches Biden place Obama's official WH portrait in a prominent WH location.
Biden will make an excellent  president.
cymone, how did you all let Kanye West name get on the ballot for the  states of Ohio, West Virginia and Arkansas, I‚Äôm extremely upset about Ohio. It appears that Biden‚Äôs campaign to sleep.
Thanks for using her proper title.  I can‚Äôt wait until Dr. and President Biden clean out the White House!
Perhaps you should review with your boss the correct pronunciation of the names of US national parks before you start tweeting about Biden‚Äôs mental acuity.
We already have had progressive presidents. Obama, for example. What you are asking for is a Socialist president. Unfortunately right now we have a regressive president. There's why we need to elect Biden in November.
Biden won‚Äôt even go on Fox News Sunday.  He‚Äôs afraid.  Sad üò≥üò≥
I don‚Äôt think the path forward here is less fundamentals of a normal presidential race. We‚Äôre already in wonderland. Acknowledging that these may not be historically great debates, but we need to see these candidates take each other on directly. I think the Biden-sanders...
Nice try.
Unbelievably disappointed to find that a friend  (62yo WW) is going to vote for trump. Believes Biden has dementia,  doesn't actually watch any of trump's blathering press confs or interviews. Simply doesn't consider any negative info about trump.
Supporters Urge Joe Biden Not to Debate Trump, Applaud Hosts for Canceling Over COVID-19 Concerns - Mainstream News should hear this loud and clear: if #Biden will not do person-to-person debates with #Trump, then NO election in November!  #DelayTheVote
I‚Äôm in Montgomery County Maryland. The Unions are refusing to let us go back until Biden wins! Teachers I know think they will die! This is what it is like living in a fucking liberal State. # Hate my life and can‚Äôt wait to move!
"kid's off limits" like they didn't just try and drag Biden's son? Lol
I'm confused.  Is the grad student a paranoid leftist? Is this a type? Is Biden putting people in camps a thing? Most grad students I've known are just tired and busy. Is this a mentally ill grad student?
Great piece.  Nailed it w/advice to Biden.  When DJT attacks, don‚Äôt worry about defending your family, defend American families depending on getting out from under the chaos of this Administration.  Looking forward to the book!
No, actually. Trump is down 9 points to Biden, nationally, losing most swing states to Biden and even down in RED states. And the number 1 issue for voters is COVID...and with the way the GOP is handling that it‚Äôll only get worse. I‚Äôm happy as can be. You?
You mean if you are smart vote for Joe Biden
Typical Trumper. Turn a blind eye to blatant lies, hypocrisy, criminal activity and racial slurs only to make baseless claims about Biden. Same tired old story. You‚Äôve been duped by Donnie ‚Äîtime to admit that and move on with your life
Democrats are anarchists that want to defund the police and Biden is a decrepit puppet of the left: that‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs campaign strategy? Too little too late.
Why a map Trump showed at a meeting may tell a different story
I would love to save this tweet and throw it back at toy after Biden's either been dispatched by Trump or proacticely by the Democrat party, but honestly, there are too many other things to do than keep track of being petty with you.
Republican history: in 2016 Barack Obama completed his second term, yada yada yada, in 2020 Joe Biden became President and here we are.
None of this is a good enough reason to hand the election to Trump by trying to convince people to vote Green. Voting for anyone other than Biden is the wrong choice because of Trump, and you will not convince me otherwise.
Exactly what I would do if I was old enough to vote  Biden is a step in the right direction and most importantly he‚Äôs not Trump
Covid-19 hotspots now key battleground states in 2020 election
Model Kasich-Scott v. Biden-Harris. Assume dark convention and SDNY cases mean Trump is out now (no ad buys anymore). Just ask Rick what he feels about the possibility and see how he reacts.
is about to be indicted (CFO most likely brought data with him, subpoena is official copy), Trump ads stopped, #GOP convention dark. #LincolnProject ad timing. Now, not Oct &amp; not #Biden #JoeBiden #Biden2020
Biden 65% Trump 35%
The time is right when we could actually get it passed in the House and Senate. Perhaps if Biden wins, in a few years, he could be convinced to change his mind, but it doesn't matter if we (Dems) can't win the Senate and hold the house.
Who‚Äôs ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all going to be reunited?‚Äù Republicans will kill the selection no matter what. A mayor in Luray, VA just said on Facebook, ‚Äúwho‚Äôs Biden going to pick, Aunt Jemima?‚Äù
You‚Äôre not going to vote for Biden because the Democrats that area of Georgia tended to elect ranged from regular conservatives (real conservatives like not what you imagine Biden to be) at the leftmost to actual John Birchers at the rightmost
Holy shit Biden has bagged the Bob Avakian endorsement.
Until there is a vaccine, frequent testing with quick results at employment &amp; schools &amp;for travelers is essential. A Biden administration will get the virus down to manageable EU level. Biden will get a vaccine produced &amp; equitably distributed once it is available.
Obama condemned Israeli building in eastern Jerusalem and sent Biden to Israel to mop up.
Oil donors flock to Trump as Biden hardens climate stance
Who says Biden is getting elected?
You can tell they all think Biden will win, because suddenly everyone is concerned about the debt.
I do. Tired of the whining when the choice is clear. Biden or the crapper.
The incompetent and corrupt Biden always uses false news to confuse the public and deceive the people with evil intentions.    Make America great again!  Re-elected as Trump in 2020!

Whining about it is not helping. Become active to push for change . I can guarantee you Trump will never deliver the reforms you want. With Biden, there‚Äôs a chance for progress. He is the only choice and you may be surprised.

If Biden‚Äôs winning by 4 in Ohio he‚Äôs likely carrying the 1st district rooted in Cincinnati, in which case Steve Chabot is in real trouble.
Dems can't win with Biden... if he skips debates, he can't get elected... people will see right through that.  If he does debate, his cognitive issues will be on full display.  They are beginning to realize this now.
Biden said he would pick a black female Supreme Court justice.  That's awesome: she will have as much impact as who's VP  He also said he would pick a female VP. He did not specify she would be black. I want him to pick someone he can work with who would also be a good president.
Trump is not a unique threat to our society. How will Joe Biden prevent another Trump in the future?
If Biden wins and the Senate is 50-50, do the Republicans control the Senate until January 20th? They could ram though a new Justice? I assume at least ONE of the 50 Republicans left would object. Am I too naive?
The difference here is that Biden publicly started this process months ago.
Biden has the upper hand. Trump needs the debates so Biden can play hardball. That is what Trump would do.
Raising taxes is necessary to avoid the economic collapse that the GOP set us up for. Biden is pro-coal, like the GOP, so I don‚Äôt C how he‚Äôll ruin the energy sector. And tax-payer funded health care for all should happen. It‚Äôs unfortunate that may include illegals. But necessary.
Grow up and think. Your choice is Biden or oblivion. As I explained in this thread, the US electoral system makes third parties almost impossible. If you want to develop a third party, you must start at the local level progressing upward through the hierarchy.
What is wrong with you saying, IF Biden becomes President and dies during the term. What kind of person are you, no anchor has ever said anything like that. Maybe you need another job. You're just showing that your a Republican.
Shhh! I‚Äôm listening to Biden.
Shhh! I‚Äôm listening to Biden.
Biden did the best in the contested primaries (people with no extra time to devote to long sometimes far away caucuses) among people beyond the range of degree getting (30+ with no degree.
I mean sure suburban anti-Trump moderates took advantage of the open/semi-open primaries Bernie supporters were praising and demanding just a few years ago and voted for Biden in droves, but hey that‚Äôs democracy for you
This map was about the activist petit bourgeoisie who did indeed like Bernie, people with no extra $ to donate to campaigns liked Biden though that‚Äôs all there was to it
Biden raised way less than Bernie his supporters were pretty much all less stridently activist working class people
Actually I‚Äôm being too modest here I think. Biden was ahead nationally before the Iowa caucus and Buttigieg and Klobuchar would‚Äôve had to drop out way earlier with a national primary happening, Biden still wins at least a plurality
I stand corrected. Biden would‚Äôve had a narrow plurality and would‚Äôve likely won at the convention after Bloomberg threw his support to him lol
Hillary was never up by 9 points nationally and at all in RED states like Biden is.
Fox, thpropaganda machine needs to compare Biden and Trump by values, integrity, experience. Biden would be a Real President, not fake President, who asked his campaign people to photoshop Florida rally  picture by pasting pictures of crowd around him from other events. Cheater.
I'll answer this one. Pretty much none of them want us to move to the right. There are a few happy where we are. Those ones might want Trump. But China? Russia? Iran? Every shitty country in the world? They want us to move left and would be giddy if Biden won.
The Genius of our founding fathers. The people of PA have 9 times the voting power of 35 states combined. Yes, I know it isn‚Äôt exact. But Biden would give up 3 million votes in California for  50,000 votes in PA.
It was BO + Biden that stopped SARS testing long ago.
Chicago is BO Town ! Black-On-Black crime has been out of control for many years and BO + Biden Did Nothing ! ü§Æ
All evidence to the contrary. Biden doesn‚Äôt support the new Green Deal, Biden wants to throw more money at the police and he‚Äôs not against keeping troops in the Middle East.

The Many Ways That Joe Biden Trips Over His Own Tongue - my worry every day is this: what happens if #joebiden falls, hits his skull, and then wakes up believing he is ‚Å¶ ... wow! Then what happens in November?! Anyone! #KAG #TrumpNov

This chart shows how it was in 2016. Substitute Biden for Hillary now, and I think only Levels 0, 1, and 5 are left.
Will he ask a Biden aide the same thing?
Is the assumption with this that Bass/Harris/Warren/whatever woman it is played these cards to be VP? And not that they, too, have worked their asses off enough for Biden to think they're the right VP?
Biden voted For Segregation, Biden‚Äôs Friend was KKK Grand Kleager Senator Robert Byrd of WVa !  By the way , how much are Trolls of Marxist Soros or CCP of China paying you ??
Better than Biden with Russia and China
Donna stop. Let Biden pick who he  wants to pick. Kamala Harris will run over Biden. if you read her autobiography, you would know that she‚Äôs attorney general. Not VP.

Political analyst makes plea for Biden not to debate Trump
Well I‚Äôd like to see ol Joey Biden wriggle his way outta this one
Give me a viable option other than Trump, and I will vote for that person. Even if Biden did what he's been accused of, that means he has hurt some people, which sucks. Trump is literally killing thousands with his incompetence. Our country can't survive another term.
But do you really think that right now is the best time to be complaining about Biden and the Democratic party? It's counterproductive. Complaining about the Democratic party right now while the entire focus is on getting Trump out does absolutely nothing but help Trump.
Just leave his hair alone. He has a disability from scalp surgery. If you mock it, you are no better than he is.  Given that the RNC will be dark, you may be declaring victory soon. #NoTrump2020. The question is, will you back  Biden or whomever the convention chooses?
Since Illinois is not a swing state and this district is safely Democratic, IL-02 doesn‚Äôt get much attention. Perhaps if it did, Robin Kelly‚Äôs name would‚Äôve been thrown around a bit more as a Joe Biden VP pick. For now, though, she‚Äôll cruise to victory again in 2020.
Probably a lot of the same ones who didn‚Äôt take Biden‚Äôs accusations seriously because it went against their political agenda
Its already a known fact that Biden signed up for 3 debates while Prez Chump hasnt..wants to change the people asking the questions as well as locations. Basically he knows Biden will kick his ass and he wants to rig the debates. So if u did ur research u wouldnt need to ask..
Just a few days away from Joe Biden announcing his #VPPick. This is very exciting!
I mean, as I admitted elsewhere in this lengthy thread, I think it‚Äôs more realistic to assume that she‚Äôll be a player in the 2024 #veepstakes under Biden‚Äôs VP.   But she‚Äôd be a baller either way, and I‚Äôd love to see her be the youngest person to run.
We elect Biden to fix it.
I will preface this by saying Fuck Facebook. But seriously anyone who creates a FB group that is 'pro Trudeau' or 'pro Obama' or 'pro Biden' and is 90% con trolls go fuck yourself. They're the fake news.
Wrong.  We CAN get rid of a fascist dictator who is killing Americans NOW, -AND- elect Joe Biden in November.
Biden calls on Trump, Congress to enact an emergency housing program
No Biden will raise it by 600 quintillion, Trump is modest as usual
Trump's muddled message isn't landing
You‚Äôve had 3 1/2 years to take care of that disparity and now time is up. I guarantee you Biden will take care of that disparity.
How do you know what will happen under Biden administration? Answer is, you don‚Äôt! It cannot be any more disastrous then you ignoring the Covid pandemic in this country for the past six months! Resulting in more deaths and cases than most other countries in the world

Political analyst makes plea for Biden not to debate Trump
Hey Biden üëÄ
Most people saying to vote for Biden because he has plans that will ‚Äúfix America‚Äù, and give more rights to minorities is kinda strange, and suspicious, and most of this people saying are kids, teens or young adults siding with democrats.
There is literally no one he could pick that would make me vote for Trump. He could pick Trump, himself, and I would vote for Biden. I can‚Äôt imagine him doing it but I am voting straight Democratic, period.
If you aren't willing to debate, you don't deserve the presidency...
Trump took many measures to curb COVID-19, but he was interrupted by Biden and the Democrats. The Democrats lied and spread rumors, disrupting American public order.

Kamala Harris is the most logical VP choice for Joe Biden. Susan Rice makes sense as part of the administration, just not as vice president.
PRES TRUMP IS DEFEATING THE FAR LEFT! HE HAS THE TOOLS WITHOUT TWITTER AND FACEBOOK! HIS RALLIES AND THE FLYING ROOSTER HAS THE DEMS ON THE RUN AND THEY ARE QUAKING IN THEIR BOOTS. BIDEN IS SO AFRAID THAT HE SPEAKS AGAINST BLACKS AND HISPANICS!
BIDEN WILL HAVE TO EXPAND BASEMENT TO LIVE IN AND BS IN WITH OBAMA AND RICE. IF HE CAN REMEMBER WHERE THE DOORS ARE.
Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt picked a VP yet because his aides have to continually talk him out of picking Sarah Palin.
If you guys think Trump is a bad speaker uhhh have you heard Biden talk yet ?
Biden didn‚Äôt beat Harris, (fear of) Sanders did.

You ain‚Äôt black Biden is a bobble head and a Trojan horse and an empty vessel
Well that's not an answer to my question. DOMA was non-inclusive to gay people, and you're defining inclusivity and masculinity together, so are JRC and Biden more politically masculine than Bernie for supporting it? Those are your criteria, evaluate this event.
So Bernie sanders's insufficiently inclusive attitude towards queer identities is a "masculine" trait. Then, for instance, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden must be considerably more masculine than Bernie because they supported the tremendously anti-inclusive DOMA law
I don't care if his Veep pick is a loaf of bread, I'm voting for Biden.
Is it Rashida Tlaib you're talking about in terms of the anti-queer left then? She's certainly less compromising when it comes to policy, and she won't even endorse Biden.  But more importantly, what's Bernie's "violent" approach? What violence has he done?
Even the people dumb enough to support Biden know that he didn't write this
I know there‚Äôs no bottom, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll get worse. But for somebody with such a questionable relationship with the Bible to something like this. There are few things more gross.

The work is not done when we #voteTrumpout, but we must #voteTrumpout; that means voting for Biden. We can deal with Biden after Trump is gone. As Chomsky says, this generation will decide whether organized human society survives. This is what America can do in 2020-For survival.

With Biden as POTUS?  Don't hold your breath ü§£
It has literally ALWAYS BEEN DONE THIS WAY. There is NO DELAY. Obama didn‚Äôt announce Biden as his VP pick until the 23rd of August, 2008.  WTF is WRONG with you???
You called every Biden supporter a pedophile. I did not call every Trump supporter a racist. You are calling me a pedophile. The allegations against Joe Biden are false.
2)It's not the fact that the Biden family abandoned Pennsylvania because they might have family still living there. It's just that they decided to move. How do you know if Joe's father had an opportunity in Delaware that forced him to move? Just think about what you said.
1)If you born in Pennsylvania that means you are from Pennsylvania. It's not Joe Biden's fault that his family left and went to Delaware. He was only 10 years old and he has to go rather he likes it or not.
Biden is not afraid of Trump. Why does want to delay the election? Why don't he like the mail-in ballots?
You can say every Biden supporter are pedophiles, but you can't call every Trump supporters racists. I don't call every Trump supporter a racist. The allegations against Joe Biden are false. How about 35 counts of rape against Trump. That man should be in prison.
Remember when Graham promised to subpoena Hunter Biden ? Hmmm  Graham is all bark but no bite like most (ALL?) politicians ...sounds like a rino (Republican in name only)....

She would be amazing and would clinch the election for Biden.
I am in no way voting for Trump but Joe Biden should follow his lead banning Chinese companies like Tik Tok because they literally ban dozens of American companies the same way. We already had Tik Tok. It was called Vine. We can make another one
Don‚Äôt forget Michelle Obama and HRC picked by you ain‚Äôt black Biden  You ain‚Äôt black Biden would be gone except for the black vote in North Carolina and demon rat üêÄ (Democrat) James Clyburn !
I mean Gore was easily the nominee in 2000, and Bush was the nominee in large part because his dad was Reagan's VP.  Cheney and Biden were both supposed to be too old to have presidential ambitions, though lots changed for Biden (Trump, Beau, and HRC losing)
re: Biden  debates. We both know they have devolved into poli-entertainment now.  90 sec to give full answers on complex policy issues? And it just becomes name calling. Have them each make 15 min YouTube videos on each topic and be done.
For someone who clearly would be a one-term president, I don't understand Biden's camp wanting to pick a VP without presidential aspirations.
I tend to be stuck on Harris bc she‚Äôs such a tough woman. Biden needs a strong running mate to take the stage and debate strongly.
You ain‚Äôt black Biden
I wondered how HRC would get in the White House and the way is through you ain‚Äôt black Biden. A few months ago Biden talked of a black woman as his VP and now he says a woman which leaves the door open to Michelle  and Warren AND HRC !
Oh please! Kamala will be the VP nominee and you know it. Biden has done nothing wrong. Like Kamala said (when she implied Biden was a racist), ‚Äúit‚Äôs all politics‚Äù.
Thanks much for the mention!
Because we can do better than anyone who's moderate enough for Biden to want as VP
Okay, but this weird shit is def going to make it easier for me to fill-in the bubble for Biden.
She won't run for president, and she has the most progressive record that doesn't make Biden's wall Street donors antsy. She's also not a cop

I just want to say, I love your tweets. here's a fun question. Who would you like to see a Josh Lyman in a Biden admin? #Biden2020
Politics and Obama picked you ain‚Äôt black Biden as his VP.....hmmm
It's always weird when I see people criticize Biden's campaign strategy. In an era of hyperpartisanship and negativity, all news is bad news. If you do what he's done and induce a coma until November your opponent has nothing to attack and he's the one who recieves a critical eye

Oh...I see.  BIDEN was VP FOR OBAMA....LETS LOOK WHAT HE DID IN OFFICE ALREADY... URANIUM DEAL...FALSELY JAILED RANCHERS...FBI SHOT FATHER AND TOOK THEIR LAND FOR ITS URANIUM WHICH WAS SOLD TO RUSSIA...OUR ENEMY...IRAN DEAL..GIVE MONEY, WEAPONS, AND TRAINING IN RETURN FOR NOTHING
Biden released a statement that said he wants the prosecution of the believers of a political ideology. He probably only meant that he wants  the prosecution of some undefined, inherently  violent group of people who are responsible for all the trouble at protests.
I had multiple people reply that the statement doesn't say that. Well, no. Biden may have meant something different, and we may all agree that he's dumb that he probably meant something different, but the statement still said what it said, and the refusal to admit that is weird
I understand that Biden is dumb and doesn't know what words mean, so whenever he says something wrong, we're supposed to imagine him saying something different and only react to that. I also simply refuse to allow my standards to be that low for the president. Like, c'mon now.
Convenient that we only report on deaths, not decline in hospitalizations, how many have recovered etc. The most irresponsible reporting by the media on all fronts. All because you don‚Äôt like the President. Would you report the same if Biden was President right now?
The amount of white people in this thread fantasizing about an end to Biden and trump winning is...predictable
obama didn't want to hear it and Biden don't  know shit

If Biden gets Texas that would be big for his electoral vote. Texas is the 2nd most populated state behind California.
Lol, Yeah I'm a POC and I"m not voting for #JoeBiden . While I can't stop you from rationalizing your choice, voting for Joe Biden is actually the greater evil. It's been the rationale of political strategy that's brought us to this awful choice in the first place.‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they like me?‚Äù Trump wondered aloud. Because they don‚Äôt. That should be good enough to set this country right. So long as everybody votes." #GetOutTheVote #VoteByMail #VoteHimOut
I hope they see Kanye for the tool that he is and cast their votes for Biden.

If Biden ran without a Running mate, I‚Äôd vote for him. If he ran with an empty bottle of Bleach, I‚Äôd still vote for him. If he ran with the local fire truck as a running mate, I‚Äôd vote for him. If he ran with my neighbors dog Henry, I‚Äôd vote for him. #RidenWithBiden
Biden is what we, as a country, need to right the sinking ship before it drowns us all.  We're very close to that waterline now
Independent here as well. It‚Äôs our current social fabric. Biden isn‚Äôt fixing it. Trump may continue to make it worse but let‚Äôs remember he is a product of this environment. One day I hope we realize there are more colors in the spectrum besides red and blue.
DONALD TRUMP ISN‚ÄôT WORTHY OF ANYONE‚ÄôS VOTE. DONALD TRUMP WILL BE ABSOLUTELY TROUNCED BY JOE BIDEN IN NOVEMBER.
You asked how the MAGA slogan worked. He got elected; good chance it gets him re-elected, too.  Emotion aside: polls said HRC in a rout. It was rout. Biden has to flip at 4 states from ‚Äò16 to win. Winning same states by double the margin does nothing to Electoral College counts.
Trump is Grasping at straws.  He sure has NOTHING here!  Biden is someone who actually attends church and is a devout Catholic. Totally weird. #distraction #VoterSuppression #AmericaOrTrump #coronavirus #Deaths160000 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs strategy from here on out should be to shut the entire fuck up until November and let Trump continue digging his own grave. Maybe choosing a Black woman as a running mate who will snatch his caucasity-filled ass up when he starts to speak wrong will also help‚Äù üò∑üò∑ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A vote for Biden is insanity. No exaggeration. Biden is a hoax!
Yahoo new's........ok.  You are so far behind, Biden could say anything at this point and you'll still lose massively...
Biden vs. Trump?  My politics align more with Trump, but Trump is a divisive moron who routinely spouts utter garbage.  Why anyone votes for him, much less reveres him is something I'll never understand.
Its another election of the lesser of two evils. Biden for the win because of this üëáüëáüëá
No the MAGATs aren't stronger than ever, they are weak scared little people like you. Biden leads in every poll. #TrumpHasNoCredibility  #anylivingthingotherthantrump #AmericaStrongerWithBiden
It means voting for Joe Biden, and all that entails. Dementia, left wing politics. Live with that
So I‚Äôm guessing y‚Äôall for Biden?
OK now I KNOW Trump is getting desperate.  Attacking Biden (who is a very devout Catholic) saying he will ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù is ridiculously stupid. Another distraction away from the REAL threats which includes is active voter suppression by the GOP. Slowing the mail is highly suspect!
Liar. Biden is a gun owner. The second amendment is a sacred right that he will protect. Stop lying.
The ad you aired this evening (Biden)had the following idea behind it: Trump didn't just steal lives from us, he stole time we could have had with loved ones...time we can never get back. It's good ad. GenX and Millennials now have kids. They want a full family w/grandparents.
He‚Äôs going to run circles around Biden
Biden is articulate enough to talk circles around Dumb Donald.
We are a police state. So if the Dems win in Nov do you think Biden will send troops out to beat peaceful protesters to include women that oppose his will like Trump has?  Be honest.
Sorry, but this sounds like the 2020 version of ‚Äú...but her emails...‚Äù. A vote any other way than Biden is a vote for Trump.
The only appropriate response, Biden is God like, you are not. It‚Äôs simple he walks the talk, you do not. You have to pay off prostitutes he does not. Was that simple enough for your small brain
Wow - this really shows just how bad Trump's mind is!  While trying to rip on Biden, he comes out looking like the stupidest person on Earth.  There is no way he passed any cognitive test with flying colors....
NOT respectfully, people who have had enough with the demise of democracy and the rise of totalitarianism, will vote for Biden.
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.
I'm not sure I agree with Biden's team in this article.  An in person visit is enough to motivate someone on the fence or motivate a non-voter into a voter.  Trump‚Äôs campaign knocks on a million doors a week. Biden‚Äôs knocks on zero.  via
If true, Joe Biden is officially a JRPG protagonist.
What I feel Biden is saying MOST in.The Hispanic  community come from far worse living conditions in home country do the see the oppurtunity in america. The are blacks in inner cities taught victimhood. If you want a better life Get Off Your Ass and build a better life!
Typical #Trumpers üò∑ They already know they're going to lose.
My new favorite game is "Blatant Racism or Just Brain Rot" with Joe Biden.  We haven't had a single round settled yet.
Agree hopefully Biden wins.  The next term will be devoted to undoing the damage.  Its massive.  Also, we've exposed serious gaps in our legislative oversight system, those gaps need to be narrowed or closed.

Frankly, debating Trump is pointless. And a mischaracterization to call it a debate. Only gives him a stage to be his deplorable self. But if this Biden strategy results in no debates, do it!
As if that would prevent Barr from promoting any narrative that would impact Biden's campaign.
When informed people hear you describe Joe Biden as competent, humane and coming to the rescue, we look at you like you're on a plane falling out of the sky but you aren't worried because an old guy with dementia who used to be a mediocre pilot is there to attempt a crash landing
I agree with you. Mr. Biden should not waste his time.
Look how far Biden has gotten in life even with an issue with stuttering.  40 years in government. What that shows is he masters his fate.  Your father on the other hand is fated for prison.  You too, I might add.
‚Äú... if Joe Biden drops out and the D.N.C. runs a tomato can, I will vote for the tomato can, because I believe the tomato can will do less harm than our current president.‚Äù
THERE IS TREMENDOUS LAWLESSNESS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WOULD BE SO EASY TO STOP BUT THEY HAVE A CLOUDED VISION OF WHAT SHOULD BE DONE.TRUMP IS INDOCTRINATED WITH A PHILOSOPHY WHICH WILL NEVER WORK, A PHILOSOPHY WHICH WILL DESTROY AMERICA. JOE BIDEN WILL RETURN THE U.S. TO GREATNESS.

Probably should just do it over if Biden wins
Also very likely y‚Äôall are debating a position that Biden does not hold.
This article masquerades rumor and conjecture as analysis. JK‚Äôs only evidence of ‚Äúindecision‚Äù or that Biden wants a ‚Äúlow-profile‚Äù VP appear to be from unsubstantiated talking points of rivals.
Biden was making a poor/racist analogy imo. He was saying just because his age, why would he need a test to prove his mental awareness anymore than a black person would need to take a test to prove they aren't on drugs.  He should be called out on it.
"Mr. #Biden must put forward the strongest ticket possible for a crushing #landslide that not only unseats Mr. #Trump but throws the un-American spirit of #Trumpism on the ash heap of #history." Could it be? Michelle #Obama as #VEEP ü§î #DreamComeTrue
Anyone willing to be me $100 that Biden will not ....What was I gonna bet? Dam it!!!

Just thinking that if I were Joe Biden, looking at this Trump interview, I would stay in my fox hole and let DJT continue to screw this up.
I hope Trump‚Äôs response will haunt him from now till November. And Biden must remind people of this statement very frequently.
Vice President  releases his agenda for the Latino Community.  As President, Biden will ensure everyone is treated with dignity ‚Äî no matter their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or zip code.
He‚Äôs not free falling anymore. Race looks stable, Biden with a modest lead but Trump within striking distance. Considering all the external conditions this shouldn‚Äôt be close. Looking like 2016.
President Trump is on the rise!  51% approval in Rasmussen ‚Äî a full 7 points ahead of Obama at this SAME POINT in 2012.  Trump supporters are 70% MORE ENTHUSIASTIC than Biden voters.  The enthusiasm gap is real and it‚Äôs a real problem for Joe Biden
Agreed, yet I only have Trump vs Biden as options.
Sure. Biden told you so himself, did he?
usps union endorses biden and you think they should be in charge of our election?  How about everyone drop their ballots off at the police stations and let them handle it?
ByeDon.  Read it and weep.
I don‚Äôt expect Trump to attend the inauguration of Biden.  In fact, after losing, and if he is unable to alter the results, he could be on the way to Russia. As will all the Trumps. Looking for a way out of consequences.
The only reason for Biden and Impeached45 to debate is to show just how much of a moron tRump is. He needs 154K nails put into his coffin. One for every Covid19 death.
FROM NPR: "It's hard to believe that the hole President Trump dug for himself could get deeper, but it has. Biden now has a 297-170 electoral college advantage over Trump with exactly three months to go until Election Day."
There is no good reason to scrap the debates.  They could be held in a big room, Trump and Biden 10 feet apart, People asking questions at a safe distance.  There is no need for an audience or a spin room.
"A record and widening majority of Americans disapprove of the job he's doing when it comes to handling the coronavirus; he gets poor scores on race relations; he's seen a¬†suburban erosion¬†despite efforts to¬†win over suburban voters with fear..."

Don't see how it's possible.  Biden is another Democrat hoax. He will not debate. He will not be the candidate. I have no idea what the strategy is. Democrats cannot win. They can't win at the ballot box without massive cheating.  They offer nothing. And the can't win in war.

A new poll shows President Trump, has a national &amp; battleground lead over Joe Biden.  The Democracy Institute poll commissioned by the Sunday Express newspaper, shows Trump leading Biden 48 to 46%. Trump opened up a bigger lead in the battleground states.
According to a Democracy Institute Poll, President Trump leads Joe Biden 48 to 46%. Democrats extremely worried about Trump surge as Biden‚Äôs mental decline worsens.

Guy I grew up with just got arrested for getting a 16 year old wasted and having sex with her. He has a Biden sticker on his car. Go figure
This lady deserves a break, but she won't go anywhere as long as she's got a breath in her body. We owe her more than we could ever repay. But mostly, right now, right this minute, we owe her the same dedication to electing Joe Biden on November 3rd as she's had in hanging on
If Durham holds himself up 2 the requirements of a US Attorney, then Durham would take issue with a lie on Barr's part that allows trump 2 steal another  election. He should refuse to allow his name to be tied to false claims against Joe &amp; Hunter Biden,

Polls have been suspect since 2000 but it‚Äôs still Biden‚Äôs election to lose.  Who he chooses as a running mate will either solidify a win or give Trump an undeserved chance.
The so called debates are a waste of time.  Not really true debates, nhst both sides spewing campaign slogans.    Absolutely will vote for Biden.  Democracy will not survive if Trump gets a second term.
Ask Biden's son.
But we already elected Biden for 8yrs and my bank account was better then than it is now... My tax bills from 2018 and 2019 are what is draining my accounts #thankstrump #drainingthemiddleclass
I think we have a lot more to be concerned about with crazy trump than Biden's thoughtfulness.
Biden didn't have obvious signs of dementia 12 years ago. Today, Biden is a placeholder. Biden isn't up to the job of president and, if elected, his V.P. would soon become president when he steps down for health reasons.
I will walk, covered in honey, through a hive of murder hornets, to vote for Joe Biden.
I never forgot his sister soulja moment...Biden capable of that too
Might be worth noting that Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Obama, Biden and Rice have not denied their plan to entrap Flynn - as documented by Comey‚Äôs department lawyer. Those who think entrapment is OK are idiots.
Yep. No question. I‚Äôd have voted for Biden 4 years ago if he was the candidate.
For Biden it's hiding within the luxurious confines of his basement, taking his Memantine prescription, babbling to himself as he aimlessly putters around in his underwear and slippers looking for his prepared interview questions responses notebook.

Can‚Äôt wait to see Joe Biden‚Äôs tweet about how TikTok is actually good and that he definitely composed himself.
I was thinking this this entire time I was watching: Warren takes Biden‚Äôs message and amplifies it, lights a fire under it. We desperately need her energy and enthusiasm ‚Äî and her progressive values. #VPWarren #VicePresidentWarren #WarrenDemocrat
it's also a dumb thing that would win Biden exactly zero votes
Exactly. People act like corruption began on 1/20/17 when fact it's been there for quite a while. Trump just puts an ugly face on it. Plus, when it comes to a guy like Biden, even if he's marginally better than Trump in some areas, he's not exactly a dyed-in-the-wool progressive.
1. I'm waiting for the veep announcement tbh.  2. I've donated at times when Biden promised a sticker and so far 1 sticker and that just said "Beat Trump".
THE SWAMP WILL BE DRAINED ON NOVEMBER 3RD, ON THAT DAY JOE BIDEN WILL BE ELECTED PRESIDENT.
It‚Äôs been reported she has no intention to be in politics, even though she virtually guarantees a win and would be a shoe in 2024  If Biden was ‚Äúlosing‚Äù I think she‚Äôs consider, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll happen
I'm ridin with bidenDeflecting ‚Äúhey have you guys heard what Biden said‚Äù   ‚ÄúHaVe YoU sEeN wHAt tRuMp SaId‚Äù ü§£
No deflecting is   Dems- ‚ÄúTRUMP IS BAD VOTE FOR BIDEN‚Äù  R‚Äôs - ‚Äúummm Biden is bad too‚Äù   Dems - ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just defending trump‚Äù  R‚Äôs - ‚Äúand you‚Äôre just defending Biden‚Äù   See how it goes in circles? Meanwhile independents (me) are telling you they both suck and are =
Deflecting is when someone asks why you vote for Biden and all of your answers contain trump
Btw, here‚Äôs what democrats think about y‚Äôall
Seriously?  Republicans are busting on Joe Biden because he made a mistake and has apologized,when they have Trump as their candidate?  I have looked most of you up.  You never supported Biden. F off!
I think u are a great person even though I would never vote for Biden. But u doing what u think is right for ur kids future while being ill , that is amazing.
Trump never said to put disinfectant up the butt... he said the virus would ‚Äúgo away‚Äù because literally every virus ever has... Putin ‚Äúguides‚Äù him? Biden was spreading Chinese propaganda at the beginning of covid... where have you been?
Some nerves talking about Trump being a traitor. Biden is a proven traitor along with Obama and many others in office. What‚Äôs funny is you think it‚Äôs ok for some but not others. If anyone is a traitor they should be gone!!!!!!! No matter who it is.
Biden says racist, and pedophile like üí© all the time but the media would have you convinced otherwise. Like I‚Äôve said, I‚Äôm not the biggest trump guy, not even gonna vote for him, but to act like Biden is better... is just a lie you have to keep telling yourself to feel better
Right, Biden didn‚Äôt help write the crime bill (called a racist bill) didn‚Äôt say he didn‚Äôt want his kids to grow up in a ‚Äúracial jungle‚Äù   Also didn‚Äôt just say the African-American community is not diverse and all think the same lol
Then we'd better hope Senate Republicans are voted out so that when he gets impeached right away the Senate won't keep him in office. But-- far better for everyone to vote him out and not just assime Biden will win or others will go vote trump out.
Biden isn‚Äôt better than a ‚Äúracist‚Äù mainly because he is also one ü§£
It is indefensible, it‚Äôs also indefensible to put in a 77 year old man with a checkered past, signs of dementia and who‚Äôs teeth fall out when he talks. Biden is JUST as bad. But everybody‚Äôs defense of why we should elect him, is Trump ü§£
Biden could pick my high school bully and I‚Äôd still vote for him before the orange blob.
When did I tell anyone to vote for trump? Plus, if trump is a racist Biden is JUST as racist lmao
No the people running his campaign claim they do. Biden‚Äôs healthcare plan is just to re-establish Obamacare and that caused the middle class to go without healthcare or pay an insane premium while poor people just reaped the benefits
Biden‚Äôs message is anything but clear
Oh please show me where Biden is this great noble candidate to be president. Please show me without saying ‚Äúbut trump‚Äù
An idiot who says dumb üí© but can form a sentence and knows where he‚Äôs at. Biden hides in his basement talking in circles lmao.
And it's Biden who's the bumbler.
Biden is the definition of ‚Äúunfit for president‚Äù
Yes, Biden is against God.  That's why he has a cross on his forehead every Ash Wednesday and the Godly Trump is on the golf course most Sundays.
Trump: Joe Biden &gt; GOD
In the grand scheme of things, I don't think Biden can say anything worse than the "You ain't black" gaffe lmao so this to shall past
Trumpers want debates cuz they wanna want everyone to see how out of touch with reality Biden is.  üôÑ  Ironic.
Biden sucks but so does the apocalypse Trump has led us into
Joe Biden has Catatonic Schizophrenia, the madness of fear.  Patients need isolation, quiet surroundings, low stress environments. Very cruel, dangerous and dilatory to his well being to put him up into a stressful political campaign... for of all things President.
Biden wouldn't have kept financial assistance from these democratic cities.  But you did and really should be impeached for that behavior.   tRump is killing us! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #ImpeachTrumpAgain
"Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report"
He‚Äôs unfit b/c he‚Äôs incompetent..and a liar..plenty of examples google is your friend knock yourself out it‚Äôll take awhile you can call me names say Biden has dementia Yada yada but you need to admit Trumps inadequacies Republican or Democrat I would be critical but that‚Äôs me
Donald, get ready!! America is throwing you out on the 3rd of November!!!
If Pelosi is speaker on January 21st, that means we held an election. Which means the president should be Biden, if Trump is ignoring its results. As an institutionalist, I think she would recognize a potentially possible but fake outcome (Trump winning) before taking it herself.
Very, very true.  And Biden isn't exactly hitting home runs!
I am rewriting this headline- "Jill Biden predicts a complete and utter train wreak."
Joe Biden has already agreed on three debates and has been waiting on Trump to agree to... the one hiding and is a coward is Trump himself
Yeah.  Biden's incoherent.  I guess we missed Dear Leader calling Yosemite "Yo semite".  #GOPHypocrisy #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #GOPLies
But it's Joe Biden who's incoherent and bumbling.
Lmao. You have it üíØ percent BACK ASS WARDS. Your buddy Biden wants to make the biggest tax increases in USA History. Also  and her left cronies are the ones that refused to extend unemployment..so they could further their wealth and agenda
An interesting strategy by the Dems...run and hide. Never been tried before. Do you think they would propose this if they were confident in their candidate? Laughable. Let‚Äôs Scrap the Presidential Debates
I think any video of trump doing or saying anything is a Biden ad
tRump only likes service members who live through training. Already Joe Biden is bringing honor and compassion back to the Presidency.
Well I‚Äôm a huge fan of trump and I don‚Äôt care who knows it.. I‚Äôll fight to the death to vote and support who I feel is right for the job. That‚Äôs the American way. But a lot of people want to beat and kill people for supporting trump... I don‚Äôt see anyone killing Biden supporters.
Think of the visual and verbal contrast! POTUS will look like the lying, insecure,  orange clown that he is-- while Biden will look like the distinguished, Presidential, intelligent and educated gentleman that he is. I cannot think of a greater compare/contrast. EASY for Biden.
üòÜüòÜüòÜ trump has the mental issues. Not Biden. And we are sick of hearing nothing but lies and big-headed talk that mean NOTHING. But if Biden agrees to that, I will happily watch Biden slam trump on every single issue as well as watch Biden confront trump on his lies.
The debates are a trap. The best that Biden can hope for is to maintain his strong standing coming out of them, in the face of a media that will be invested in seeing him slip, in seeing him bleed.
They are going to be manufacturing moments, massaging messages, working the refs as they always do and playing on the low expectations for Donald and the high expectations for Biden, the hunger for a horse race and the need for reversals in the media narrative.
Second, all Trump and his team are looking to do is build a library of clips and sound bytes where their guy looks strong and decisive (even if it's to his fans and no one else) and where Joe Biden seems confused or unsure or weak or hypocritical.
Joe Biden has an enormous pool of talent to vet and choose from. He doesn‚Äôt need to settle on a voiceless lackey like his opponent picked to protect a fragile ego! Joe Biden wants someone that America can depend on to be a strong Presidential adviser and a Congressional leader.
So you are afraid that Biden will force you to have an abortion? Or is it that you feel that you have a right to own a women‚Äôs body like a slave?
Right... like the racial jungle Biden didn‚Äôt want... like the crime bill he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt write‚Äù  The deportations him and his boss (the reporter in chief) handled.... more good huh?
Joe Biden is a treasure. His wisdom, his charm with woman and girl children is just so heartwarming. Watching the faces of those he compliments by giving them a quick sniff says it all. It gives me chills to think about how nice he must be to them off stage
Yeah, thats why america is voting for biden!
43 years in politics, what has Joe Biden done?
Joe Biden can‚Äôt form a sentence or stop sniffing kids....
Think about THIS for a moment .. Joe Biden could potentially go down in history as being the VP to the first black president, Become president and choose a Black women as his VP and nominate a Black women to the supreme court... TALK ABOUT A LEGACY ...
A loser goes to using fear tactics as a last resort. Biden is raising taxes but he‚Äôs doing it on the wealthy!!! People like trump who pay no taxes!!! Close the real estate loopholes and don‚Äôt allow the owners to dictate property values!!!
I would rather see Biden smack his ass in the election and watch GOP get swept out in a Big Blue Wave!
Cameron, the third party peeled away democratic votes!!!! People who didn‚Äôt want trump but preferred Bernie decided to vote third party! This section will peel away black voters and evangelicals that would otherwise vote for Biden.
A vote for the third party is peeling away votes from Biden. Third party will never be elected. One in today‚Äôs society has to thing democrat or Republican and decide which is the lesser of two evils. Why do you think Trump is comfortable with Kanye running?
Allison, it is a vote for Trump if you vote third party. Third party hasn‚Äôt a chance of winning but Trump applauded Kanye for running and why? Because he wants Kanye to peel away voters for Biden. Third party is always the deciding vote for the republicans running
For Trump to decide that beating Clinton or Biden "counts as" beating President Obama is par for the course for him. Or possibly three over par, but who's counting?
Politically it was useful to portray Clinton's potential presidency as Four More Years of Obama, and the same applies to Biden, but even more than that, Trump would rather defeat him than either of them.
Donald Trump isn't confused about who his opponent was last year; he just finds it more useful politically and for his ego to pretend President Obama was and is the mastermind behind both Clinton and Biden's campaigns.  The "He worked harder than Crooked Hillary" is key there.
I mean, we all know Pelosi's not radical anything, right? And Biden isn't in any way radical, and even Bernie isn't very far to the left, but the GOP needs and wants and gets a world in which every Democrat is in the superposition of Establishment Corruptocrat and Left Anarchist.
Whoever Joe Biden picks for vice president will be the worst possible person, the worst possible pick. Not because he made the wrong choice. But because in choosing her, he moved her into the position where she needs to be the worst. They will make her the worst.
I hope so to. I can assure you that Muslims will have more support with Biden than trump
Another celebrity endorsement for Joe Biden!
Donald, get a fucking life!!! You know that Biden is going to kick your ass on Election Day!
Did anybody see Michelle Obama or Joe Biden at John Lewis‚Äôs funeral?  Me to wife: Michelle‚Äôs probably with Joe talking about being his Vice President.  Wife to me: Michelle‚Äôs NOT going to be VP. Give it up!
Obama got me ready to go through a fire, to vote for Biden right now!!!!
He gives them more opportunities to do something for themselves. What has any other President done for this country in the past 40 years. Which Biden has been in office what has he done good for the American people
It‚Äôs funny when I never called u racist I said a fact that Biden is racist. And for to call someone else racist without facts just show what kind of a person u are
Might be in ur neighborhood but that‚Äôs the first time I heard that. What that‚Äôs got to do with Biden actually saying it.
I think Biden is going to tromp the crap out of Donald Trump in November. Donald is finished! The majority of America sees him for the fraud, liar and criminal he is. #BidenLandslide2020
Hi yes, please don‚Äôt vote for trump or Joe Biden. Ones an accused rapist and pedophile and clearly a racist and the other one is a straight fucking pedophile. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
THIS should be headline news not Trump suggesting he might delay Presidential election despite not having Constitutional authority he claims he has he does not.  On endless loop Biden predicting Trump would get desperate &amp; call for election delay w/every GOP saying Trump wouldn‚Äôt

Prove what Biden is racist. Just look at the facts through is 40+years. It‚Äôs all there or that Obama can make laws with out congress and get away with it or the fact that they both was spying on the Trump campaign and then after he got elected. Wait until the investigation over.
They always go back to Russia lol they can‚Äôt get anything else to argue about. Are they ok with Obama being the most corrupt president ever and Biden being the biggest racist in the country today. U ain‚Äôt black if u don‚Äôt forget Biden lol
Yes- and if he loses, in his anger and madness, what will he do until Biden takes over?
Yes. trump is in very bad territory. I worry what will happen if he somehow got reelected. I don't trust him and hate what he is doing to U.S. and our allies. He is not to be trusted. Allies must protect themselves. Hope Biden is elected. If not, Americans may have to fight.
If trump is re-elected? Yes. But not if we get Biden in office.
I really hope we vote his orange ass out in November. Whether you like Biden or not, he would never resort to openly abducting people on the streets.Awesome!  China will intervene to help Biden and Russia will help Trump.
Well this clears things up. If you vote for Biden you're on team China and Iran. If you vote for Trump, you're on team Russia. Choose carefully! #Election2020 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Joe Biden has started a campaign on Twitter whereby he asks us to do him a ‚Äúfavor,‚Äù supporting his campaign. It is as if he is borrowing a cup ‚Äúsugar.‚Äù He should do us a favor, drop the Presidential campaign.
For 47 years Joe Biden served in government without a signal accomplishment of note. Running for President he is dead silent so the media instead of pointing out his lack of leadership attacks the President. The strategy will not work.
Don‚Äôt need to attack- Biden‚Äôs doing that all by himself-you FAKE NEWS hack.
Actually, Biden wants to give more money to police.
Still on the fence? How is that even possible for a thoughtful reasonable adult?  Biden could throw a turd in a ziploc baggie and call it his VP pick and I'll still be voting for him.  A crazed Biden beats what we have now hands down.
For the love of Mike! WH is worrying now about Trump looking corrupt? That's funny. GOP is insane if it nominates him again. Of course, Dems are giving someone the nomination because it is their turn, because that worked so well in 2016, 2004, 2000, 1984.

why? its legit observation. We've got Cubans Mexicans  Guatemalans Brazilians El Salvadorians etc. Most Blacks are dems but Hispanic com. is split.. My ex is Cuban and his circle in miami love trump. TRUMP IS A LIAR yet we should feel shame whenever Biden says something?? Fuckoff

They didn't think they needed a "stop Trump" think tank. The party thought there was no way he could win. It was a disastrous and deadly mistake, and voting for anyone but Biden in November would also be a disastrous mistake.

No, he will just accused Biden of killing God! Sick.
Honestly Trump makes Biden sound much cooler than he actually is
Climate communist: "We just simply cannot meet our near-term and certainly our long-term climate goals unless we address the land use question."   is right.  If Biden can't stop suburbia, he will trash it w/'affordable housing' mandates.

Could be an Anchorman slip up and someone wrote the wrong words on the screen and Biden just read it. Thats all I got.
I prefer Biden to be elected because Trump is so atrocious, but he gets no honeymoon and all progressives better bring a world of pressure on him day 1
That Biden car ad is good and will appeal to normies
joe biden will never get my endorsement lmao i truly do not care
he's just tiring, come on Biden take the wheel you goofy bastard.
Reminder:  'Environmental justice' is a fraudulent notion.  Nothing in the environment harms minority communities.   EJ only denies good-paying jobs to poor communities.  Being poor sucks. EJ just locks that in.
Are they aware of the projection they put out when they do this? It‚Äôs as if they find everything with Trump and apply it to Biden, or another Democrat.
Biden totally looks like a man who can lift a glass of water to drink it, or recite five words on a 4th grade pop quiz.
I know enough about you right now to make me want to vote for Joe Biden.

So maybe thats what Joe meant when he said vote for the other Biden

It's crazy isn't it? I don't think I've seen one tweet from a Republican that holds any truth whatsoever.   They make us out to be evil sorcerers that aim to take their guns, jobs, savings, best friends, dogs and frozen pizza once Biden is elected. That's some voodoo shit.üò≥üòÇüòÇ

He closed travel from the China in JAN, and created the COVID task force in JAN, while no Dem-leaders were taking COVID seriously until March. The USA has tested more than all other countries in the world COMBINED thanks to Trump. You think dementia Biden would‚Äôve done better? üòÇ

We already have had progressive presidents. Obama, for example. What you are asking for is a Socialist president. Unfortunately right now we have a regressive president. There's why we need to elect Biden in November.
Biden won‚Äôt even go on Fox News Sunday.  He‚Äôs afraid.  Sad üò≥üò≥
For 47 years Joe Biden served in government without a signal accomplishment of note. Running for President he is dead silent so the media instead of pointing out his lack of leadership attacks the President. The strategy will not work.
I don‚Äôt think the path forward here is less fundamentals of a normal presidential race. We‚Äôre already in wonderland. Acknowledging that these may not be historically great debates, but we need to see these candidates take each other on directly. I think the Biden-sanders...
It‚Äôs going to work, because Biden surrogates will now get endless questions about if Biden wants to debate, which only validates notion that not debating was at least brought up. That‚Äôs a win for them.
When you say Biden is in a basement, do you mean the one at his house in Deleware, or the one at Comet Ping Pong?
GOP is obsessed with basements. Whether its the one at Comet Ping Pong, or one at Biden's house, where he's "hiding", a basement is always involved.
So I assume you‚Äôre not voting Biden either?
This hashtag had about as much success as Biden will have in November lmao. Spoiler Alert - there isn‚Äôt going to be an election

I'm confused.  Is the grad student a paranoid leftist? Is this a type? Is Biden putting people in camps a thing? Most grad students I've known are just tired and busy. Is this a mentally ill grad student?
Great piece.  Nailed it w/advice to Biden.  When DJT attacks, don‚Äôt worry about defending your family, defend American families depending on getting out from under the chaos of this Administration.  Looking forward to the book!
No, actually. Trump is down 9 points to Biden, nationally, losing most swing states to Biden and even down in RED states. And the number 1 issue for voters is COVID...and with the way the GOP is handling that it‚Äôll only get worse. I‚Äôm happy as can be. You?
I laugh at people who are shocked at Donald Trump‚Äôs interviews. Joe Biden is hiding in the basement because he can‚Äôt put a sentence together, yet you‚Äôre laughing at trump who put himself out there.
I cannot wait to vote for Joe Biden. He doesn't need to say another word as far as I'm concerned.
Typical Trumper. Turn a blind eye to blatant lies, hypocrisy, criminal activity and racial slurs only to make baseless claims about Biden. Same tired old story. You‚Äôve been duped by Donnie ‚Äîtime to admit that and move on with your life
Democrats are anarchists that want to defund the police and Biden is a decrepit puppet of the left: that‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs campaign strategy? Too little too late.

'Environmental justice' is worse than just a HOAX.  It drives away good-paying jobs from poor minority communities.
None of this is a good enough reason to hand the election to Trump by trying to convince people to vote Green. Voting for anyone other than Biden is the wrong choice because of Trump, and you will not convince me otherwise.

Interesting map. I can see Biden, Sanders, and Bloomberg voters, but unless I'm not understanding the coding, not Warren voters, even though she got 2% more votes than Bloomberg. Yellow shading to gray is Sanders, and solid gray is no votes, correct? So no Warren votes?
Biden 65% Trump 35%
The time is right when we could actually get it passed in the House and Senate. Perhaps if Biden wins, in a few years, he could be convinced to change his mind, but it doesn't matter if we (Dems) can't win the Senate and hold the house.

Trump is not a unique threat to our society. How will Joe Biden prevent another Trump in the future?
If Biden wins and the Senate is 50-50, do the Republicans control the Senate until January 20th? They could ram though a new Justice? I assume at least ONE of the 50 Republicans left would object. Am I too naive?
Biden has the upper hand. Trump needs the debates so Biden can play hardball. That is what Trump would do.
None of Biden's #GreenNewDeal will improve the environment; it will only decrease your standard of living.
Raising taxes is necessary to avoid the economic collapse that the GOP set us up for. Biden is pro-coal, like the GOP, so I don‚Äôt C how he‚Äôll ruin the energy sector. And tax-payer funded health care for all should happen. It‚Äôs unfortunate that may include illegals. But necessary.
Grow up and think. Your choice is Biden or oblivion. As I explained in this thread, the US electoral system makes third parties almost impossible. If you want to develop a third party, you must start at the local level progressing upward through the hierarchy.
What is wrong with you saying, IF Biden becomes President and dies during the term. What kind of person are you, no anchor has ever said anything like that. Maybe you need another job. You're just showing that your a Republican.

Biden did the best in the contested primaries (people with no extra time to devote to long sometimes far away caucuses) among people beyond the range of degree getting (30+ with no degree.
I mean sure suburban anti-Trump moderates took advantage of the open/semi-open primaries Bernie supporters were praising and demanding just a few years ago and voted for Biden in droves, but hey that‚Äôs democracy for you
This map was about the activist petit bourgeoisie who did indeed like Bernie, people with no extra $ to donate to campaigns liked Biden though that‚Äôs all there was to it
Biden raised way less than Bernie his supporters were pretty much all less stridently activist working class people
Actually I‚Äôm being too modest here I think. Biden was ahead nationally before the Iowa caucus and Buttigieg and Klobuchar would‚Äôve had to drop out way earlier with a national primary happening, Biden still wins at least a plurality
I stand corrected. Biden would‚Äôve had a narrow plurality and would‚Äôve likely won at the convention after Bloomberg threw his support to him lol
Hillary was never up by 9 points nationally and at all in RED states like Biden is.
The Genius of our founding fathers. The people of PA have 9 times the voting power of 35 states combined. Yes, I know it isn‚Äôt exact. But Biden would give up 3 million votes in California for  50,000 votes in PA.

FDR had fireside chats, Biden has Basement Zooms

I know it's unrelated, but I'm wondering, how do you feel about the Biden Vette video?
I know you have serious issues with Trump but he is definitely more of a defender for religious freedom than Biden. Your beliefs will be as much as in danger as the other believers, conservative or liberal.
Absolutely- Biden don‚Äôt know what country he‚Äôs running forüòâ
Calm down! Y‚Äôall ppl make errors! I do a lot of shoutouts! Relax! Be patient and understanding! No need to bring me down thank u
I wrote down the handle wrong! I‚Äôm human and it happens!
What if there's only an overwhelming landslide for Biden with a long tail that takes out a lot of Republicans in Congress and a few malcontents whining some of whom try to create chaos.   A patriot would condemn those few people. Where will you come down? I can guess.
Jesus... the DNC wants me to vote for this bozo but I'm going to need them to address this racism. Mayor is defending the pure hatred that exists behind what segregationist Biden said.

We are on the same team homie. I‚Äôm just extra defensive over Biden as of late, I think he is a great human being and well respected across both parties. He is also moderate which could help bridge the gap between the divisiveness created by Trump.
#Biden...always an idiot and having to backtrack. What a joke üòÇ
Dude, if you hope is that the left will swallow their pride and vote Biden, antagonizing them just hardens their resolve to do the opposite. You are asking them to do something they consider potentially immoral or shameful. If they make that decision, it will be in private.
B/c they're prepping for a Biden term.
I agree those are doable. And they are all platforms that Biden supports. Generally speaking, his voting record from the 80‚Äôs is hard to criticize, it was very different times. What only matters to me is what policies are going forward.

Wow did I say anything about Trump or Biden? No, I believe I said the parties. However, both men are old, rich, white men who don‚Äôt actually care about the American people and want to capitalize on our misery so it benefits them on the backend.
It‚Äôs fucked. I swear if you compared the statements and awkwardness of Biden interacting or speaking about or to black people and Trumps statements, they‚Äôre equally as bad.
Newsflash: You can dislike/hate Trump and still know that Biden has dementia, COVID is being blown way out of proportion, and the government has too much control over our lives. All things can be true.
Wait what about when Biden takes God down? Your words, not mine.
If God is ‚Äúhurt‚Äù it‚Äôs by an antichrist-like figure doing pure evil in his name. He holds a Bible upside down while attacking peaceful protesters. Does he need to hold a black mass? Meanwhile Biden is a Catholic, and Catholics are breaking away from Trump

Biden apologizes for comments on diversity among Black people
They know people won't vote for West because of his race. They are putting him on in Wisconsin to give people there a recognizable name. The next step is to attack Biden on his crime bill. They don't need to get many people (30k?) who would never vote trump to vote 3rd party.
Swing state polls are less frequent, and tend to have a larger spread.   The real thing is still -  1. assume Trump has a 2-3% advantage in the electoral college.  2. Look at the national polls and see if Biden is leading by more than 2-3%.
Also keep in mind that if Harris is Biden's pick and the Orange Blob dumps Pence for Haley, we will also have our first veep of South Asian ancestry (Harris's mother is from India).

Wait a minute. Trump is criticizing Biden for misspeaking? Really?
From a completely anecdotal standpoint: suburban voters  still have a huge sense of inevitability have about a 2nd Trump term and aren't even considering a President Biden as the most likely outcome - let alone a check on him
That might cause turnout problems for Biden if the Bible burning base of the Democrats stay home.
Answer your own tweet calling Biden terrible and putting him on the same level as Trump. How about that.

1.  If the kids don't show up, what's the future of the part looking like?  2.  Biden's worst enemy seems to be Biden and I don't know if he can afford to piss away votes anywhere.
Yes, Biden has a tendency to say some dumb, off-color things. But it feels so ridiculous scandal-monger when it‚Äôs 1/100th as crazy as what Trump says every single day. The media does not know how to handle this dichotomy, and as a result, we‚Äôre back in #heremails territory.

Yep and Biden should be first.
Good for you.  I am a Republican but I have voted Democrat when I thought he would be better for our country than the Republican. But your husband is right. They cheat, connive, dishonest, lower than scum &amp; want 2 ruin our country. I am sick with worry that idiot Biden will win.

Biden has literally told people that asking for universal health care in a pandemic is an insult to his son.  Biden and Trump are almost identical on policy. And Biden didn‚Äôt sit down with Ady Barkan or AOC so.  Corporate Dems entire job is to beat the left wing in the primaries.
It‚Äôs going to be funny when biden doesn‚Äôt pick your fav. Gonna have a tantrum?
I thought your deal was that facts mattered.  No one has pushed us more to corporate oligarchy in the current Dem ranks more than Pelosi/Biden. They‚Äôre a plague on the ‚Äúleft‚Äù party.  Biden‚Äôs base is people who were okay with another rigged primary &amp; not actually trying for more.
In the age of twitter, such clarifications are necessary -- because people jump on words and over interpret them -- but also rare. The fact that Biden makes an effort to correct statements that don't accurately reflect his thinking is one of many signs of his integrity.
Love ya my sweet friend! You always lift me up! Must be that Pittsburgh connection!!
Biden -- principled response to an unprincipled reckless attack.  I admire that he exercises restraint here, and does not question Trump's faith.  I won't either.  We can all evaluate the character of the two candidates for ourselves.

Well, considering Hillary gave us Trump, Biden being installed is just par for the corrupt course.  My choice is 5% for an ACTUAL left party so no matter what absolute knobs like you do, we‚Äôll be able to actually hold a Biden regime to account (minus the trials at The Hague)

When you hurt God, by extension you hurt the bible.  Hurting God is not a good idea.  Not only is it just plain mean,  God might get mad at all of us!  Biden needs to be stopped from being mean to God.  Obama too! (obviously)
A distinct difference between Biden and Cheeto is that Biden has a strong team surrounding him so I don‚Äôt blow a fuse when/if he messss up, because at least with Joe, I can sense he desires to learn from his mistakes and will take ownership of his actions. #ImWithJoe #Biden2020

West, who has never voted before, laid out a platform for his ‚ÄúBirthday Party‚Äù: a pro-life plank that alleged that Planned Parenthood was placed in cities by white supremacists, a management style patterned on the fictional country of Wakanda
Biden is a racist.  Trump is a racist. The left is a diversified party. The right is an almost all white male party.  I deserve representation... don‚Äôt you?
Biden should run with the claim that he can harm God.
Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
The president has also just revealed to us all that Biden (and Obama) are going to "hurt God."  That is a very mean thing for those two to do!  He's also going to hurt the bible and guns.  He is a fiend! I say Drat, and curses!!!
So you are ok letting this madness continue, if Biden‚Äôs VP pick is too liberal?  Biden is a grown-ass man, any decisions he makes are his own, regardless of his VP.  If he dies in office, the congress and senate will still be moderate enough to keep a raging liberal in check.

he's out of it...bonkers.  I hope his black VP has read up on all of the factual bigotry associated with Biden in his lifetime.  It will be the ultimate Pandering Job ever done for the one who accepts.
Another one taken out of context. He is implying Biden is siding with the radical left. Which he is being forced to do. But what Biden said today was ok? I guess Bidens comments were out of context as well. You are blinded by the hatred of Trump.
I‚Äôm sorry but if you‚Äôre not voting For Biden and whom ever intelligent, respectable, human being that he picks as his VP, then you are part of the problem. There will be no America if Trump is not defeated.
No matter who Biden picks, Trump will still be an incompetent, lying, corrupt bigot.
If it‚Äôs a vote for Trump, it‚Äôs also a vote for Biden. Except it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs not a vote for either.    It‚Äôs a lost opportunity, definitely.  But it‚Äôs not a vote for Trump.  I know that because it‚Äôs much much worse if she actually votes for Trump, and we wouldn‚Äôt encourage that.
Joe ‚ÄúAll Black People Are The Same‚Äù Biden
Like Chuck Norris jokes, but with Joe Biden.
"He‚Äôs against God. He‚Äôs against guns. He‚Äôs against energy, our kind of energy. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to do too well in Ohio,‚Äù Pres. Trump said about Joe Biden, speaking in Ohio today.
Biden has more kindness, compassion and empathy in his little finger than Trump has in his whole body. Trump is the antithesis of the goodness of God.
The problem is Trump.  If you vote for anyone besides Biden you are increasing the likelihood of the problem remaining.  If Biden's VP ascends to the Oval Office, that person is still less of a problem than the current occupant.
For everyone ignorantly assuming this would siphon black voters from Biden, the first group I thought of was white male millenials (not all, obviously, but feel the need to disclaim here b/c, hey, Twitter)
I'm sorry, I just found out Biden could "hurt God" if elected. I'm suddenly a lot more enthusiastic about this election.  Plans for the next 4 years: Break down the gates of heaven, mortally wound God, occupy the kingdom, and enforce an open borders policy
Biden needs to hurry up and announce President Kamala Harris as his running mate...because I just about had enough üòí
So I guess Biden isn't senile if he's still competent enough to hurt god?

Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?
As many racist things that Donald Trump does daily? And I doubt that Biden would allow black and brown people to die or sic the little green men on them.
And Joe Biden is the one who is going to "hurt God". How does anyone give him money
Joe "Crime Bill" Biden true colors coming out now. Hope you Democrats happy.
I mean it‚Äôs not sexy, but one of the most important reasons to vote for Biden is that  will just handle this role and it will make a huge difference.
Biden ‚Äúwould hurt the Bible, hurt God‚Äù Trump said today. What does that even mean? Incoherent, desperate and insane. He is decompensating before our eyes
"I am not committed to naming any (of the potential candidates), but the people I've named, and among them there are four Black women," Biden told MSNBC's Joy Reid on "The ReidOut."
I just find it hard to believe that there is someone out there that was going to vote for Biden that is now going to wait in line to vote for Kanye. But a black voter that was going to vote for Trump ... hmmm

That's the radical left, they're pathetic middle-class lazy cowards who think things are so simple and easy.  But Biden doesn't support that.
Fuck You Biden
Hey listen if Biden has that power then we really need to elect him, no??
Joe Biden a ‚Äúpolite‚Äù racist. Trump and everyone in his camp a outward racist and bigot. Kamala don‚Äôt care about black people. And that‚Äôs why I stay out of politics cause it‚Äôs all a L if you ask me

Joe Biden has, in fact, shown when he is pushed that HE GETS MORE SET IN HIS WAYS.  See also: his response to M4A in the middle of a pandemic.  Yeah, Biden cares about my agenda, that‚Äôs why he flew out of a climate change town hall on a private jet to go to a fracking fundraiser.
If you want to eliminate Trumpism, stop voting for dividers &amp; corrupt liars like Joe Biden.

Why would Biden agree to debate this guy? If you still support 45 now, nothing will change your mind.
Pretty sure that Biden is so catholic that he does the sign of the cross when a firetruck or ambulance passes in traffic. I know I do.

What kind of weak ass god do you worship if Joe Biden could hurt it? #HurtGod
Biden regularly attends mass and has done so for most of his life. He also has lived a scandal-free life and demonstrates care and concern for others. And mf Trump of all people is passing judgment on him and his relationship to God?

Hi. I‚Äôm a Joe Biden brain cell. I am laying low because the Russians are destroying us with control over social media. Remember to report misinformation to big brother.
Smear campaign? Are you saying that Biden has not said and done destructive things to Black People? This was just another statement that everyone is trying to do damage control about. He's a horrible candidate to sell to Black People, get over it or prove me wrong.

Biden is just out of it man, feel bad for him honestly lol
One of the most 2020 things ever is that we're sitting around telling Biden to just STFU... when we could have easily had one of several candidates that we couldn't wait to hear speak... all because of america's addiction to old ass white ass men.
i have nightmares about a Biden win, because think of all the of the John Ossofs and Mayor Petes the DNC is going to be throwing at us for years afterwards.
I'm not a religious person but I know that Joe Biden is and he doesn't trust you lip service to his beliefs. He believes in a Christianity that up holds empathy and compassion and love and kindness as values.

You don't understand or maybe you do, how the American media has/is being used. There could be some truth to this but they threw us in there to take pressure off the racist Biden comments. Stop looking on the surface and let go of the Trump bias because I'm not on his team.

lmfaooo  now please, just for moment, imagine trump saying this, imagine the media shitstorm afterwards, and sit and watch as that exact same media just pretends this clip of Biden doesn‚Äôt even exist. even better, watch them justify it
If any footage of Biden makes him looked diminished, why does Team Trump need to Photoshop pics of him? And why do they keep using pics of Biden praying and then adding some stupid caption to it? This is an actual #hoax.
Brett, trump is 1000x worse and you know this. Yes, Joe Biden is a gaffe machine but trump is a complete dumpster fire. Quit this bullshit false equivalence.
Ight. Time to get Joe Biden tf out of here too. Who's running third party?

Donald continues to bare false witness against  Biden for his own selfish greed. He quotes the second amendment rather than a scripture. He lives by the seven deadly sins rather than the Ten Commandments. Donald Trump has tried to find dirt on Biden and has failed. KARMA AWAITS.
Hurt him? If elected, Joe Biden will give God a swirlie and double rear admirals every single day. Just like he did when they were in high school.
Joe Biden Pr team need to just tell him stfu sometimes

Now that I know that Joe Biden is gunning for both god and the bible, I obviously can't vote for him. Thanks, Dear Leader, for showing me the light. #TrumpIsALaughingStock
Kamala Harris was tough on Joe Biden in the first debate. But so what? That's holding him accountable, and Joe is the kind of guy who would want his VP to hold him accountable and, if she disagrees with him, confront him in private.
I prefer my Presidents to have actual national security experience BEFORE they become President -- mistakes and all.  One learns by doing.  One my greatest concerns about Obama was his (relative) LACK of foreign policy chops...which is why I was so pleased when he picked Biden.

‚ÄúBut whatever the short-term dangers of being honest about Biden‚Äôs shortcomings, they are rivaled if not surpassed by the long-term perils of continuing to squelch all criticism of [Biden] in name of political expediency.‚Äù   Not mentioning all his opponents is squelching dissent.
C'mon. You provided no rationale for being OK to vote Biden if he chooses one woman but not OK if he chooses the other. Why? What is your reasoning?
Mike Pence is a sexist and a bigot. Joe Biden could pick Kamala Harris, Susan Rice or Karen Bass, it wouldn't matter. All three would be a massive upgrade over the current vice president.
Joe Biden's a modest candidate with modest goals: 1. win the 2020 presidential election 2. drain the world's oceans so he can find and kill god
ALL of the candidates Biden is considering for VP are at least nominally qualified to be President, while Trump is (as you admit) demonstrably unfit for high office. I'll be voting for Biden if his VP choice has a pulse. I find it curious you single out Susan Rice for criticism.
The Democratic primary electorate thought people like you would join us if we nominated moderate old white guy Joe Biden. We kept our end of the bargain.
Biden is against God and everything
It's almost like when you meet a woman and then you start talking and you can feel your opportunity slipping away so you just shut up .... That's what Biden needs up do
I said this earlier. Biden definitely needs to just be quiet sometimes but he's still light years away from being trump
You are not willing to have a dialogue which is sad. Communication is the key to understanding. Today Biden said that the Black community lacks diversity. That is an example of poor communication. After 50 years of politics, he doesn‚Äôt understand the vast diversity.
Biden‚Äôs media is all free though.  A lot of free propaganda coming his way so he doesn‚Äôt need to raise as much.  Also the whole not leaving your basement thing saves a lot.
writing in a name other than Biden is effectively a vote for Trump...so while I can certainly agree that the VP pick is important -- perhaps MORE important for Biden than for Obama, due to Biden's age -- it strikes me as absurd that the VP's credentials could sway your choice.
It‚Äôs almost as if the Dems are saying, ‚ÄúVote for Biden. He promises to fix nothing.‚Äù

If Joe Biden want my vote he better chose his running mate from the women who were presidential candidates cause they have been tested and tried by the public; but someone who had no interest in leading us should not be brought in the leadership as VP. (I mean, come on man.),
Joe insulting the black commercial
Joe speaks the truth.  Blacks have voted in lock step for Democrats for decades.  That does make them sheep which is what Biden seems to be implying.  Will be curious to see what Morgan Freeman (I assume in the mind of Biden he is the spokesperson for all blacks) thinks?
This does not mean that Biden is especially "good" on the concerns of Christians (progressive or otherwise). It is a solid indication that he at least thinks he ought to learn about a group's norms of he is going to pander to them.
Anyone who says this never intended to vote for Biden anyways. Sheesh.

Once again, for those who didn't pay attention in Christology class, Joe Biden cannot hurt God in His divinity, only in God the Son's assumed humanity. But since He is now glorified, even God's humanity has been infused with properties and cannot be hurt.
Absolutely. If this looks like Biden specifically going after his predecessor, that‚Äôs bad news. People sometimes say Dems need to go after Trump criminally and also that it‚Äôs bad that Trump has politicized Justice, and those two things don‚Äôt sit well together.
Biden taking stock of tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and underscoring lessons to be learned: we must engage in meaningful arms control with Russia, stop spread of nuclear weapons, salvage/strengthen JCPOA with Iran, and convince dprk to take REAL steps on denuclearization.
Well, maybe lying about love of and reading the Bible is not "against God". You will have to give evidence that Biden is "against God", without it you are just lying about your relationship with God. Do I believe, #NotThisCatholic #TrumpLies &amp; Lies

Biden will storm Heaven itself and wrest the Creator of All from His Throne. He will will pillage the gold from Heaven's streets and bring it to Earth to redistribute amongst the sinners.
Biden needs to "debate" Trump, like today, after Trump's first rant  Biden needs to turn to the moderators and ask if there is a Dr. available, because Mr. Trump seems to be suffering from a stroke or other medical condition.
If Biden plans to hurt god, I dunno.  I might vote for him just to see that Final Fantasy play out.
Biden's campaign managers right now.
What I‚Äôm hearing is that Joe Biden can go toe to toe with God.
Correct but Jim Crow Joe has a past that can only rival Slave owners. Take a look and research Biden for a little bit and you'll see why his approval is way down in the Black community and why he's hiding from cameras.

Biden is not an option for many people who feel like both options are a vote for evil. And some are refusing to vote because they no longer want to participate in the madness.
Once again I am not a Trump supporter, but you heard me say that the first time. Let me know when you're ready to discuss Biden's political record as Senator since the 70's. Then I want you to tell me why he should get our vote.

Im arguing with someone who thinks wearing a mask is having our rights taken away and called me a sheep, I told him he probably doesn‚Äôt even know who julian assange or edward snowden is and said im starting to sound like Joe Biden.. Fucking idiot.
Are you kidding? Trump pointed to a guy at a rally and called him ‚Äúmy African-American.‚Äù He says racist things all the time and it doesn‚Äôt hurt him. Biden is very problematic, but he was talking about voting patterns in his clip.
This is not about Trump, it's about Biden's racist ass and how him and the Democrats have sabotaged Black Families for decades. Stay on topic or blindly support a party that has created policies to oppress Black children and their families since the Civil Rights Act was passed.
It‚Äôs cute when I don‚Äôt vote for Biden tho
Trump Ads have already done that. I‚Äôve seen it and now he‚Äôll know how it feels. Sometimes ‚Äúwhat goes around comes around‚Äù.  But now Trump Ads are using false background with Biden and adding an image that has been tampered. He approves of that political machine...false ads claims
Maybe I'm selfish or misguided... but THIS is why I kinda hope she's not selected to be on Biden's ticket. Not because she wouldn't be an outstanding VP... but because she would leave a major void in the Senate. She is DAMN good at this right here... this is where she's needed.

Sorry Mr President but if Biden does agree to debate you that would be a suicide mission by Biden, and we all know Biden‚Äôs handlers won‚Äôt let the debates go on because it most surely be a disaster on Biden‚Äòs heart
As our great President said re: Biden...what a stupid thing to say.
Yes they are! Classic merry go round. Republicans ruin the economy Democrats clean it up by taking away programs needed for the needy. This time its worse than ever. Joe Biden will have a big job ahead.
Trump thinks so highly of black voters that he thinks they‚Äôre dumb enough to:   1. Vote for Kanye West.  2. Abandon their 50 year allegiance to Democrats because of a manufactured Biden ‚Äúgaffe.‚Äù
In Biden trying to get the Latino vote, once again he insults the Blacks again. *Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity
When I say Biden's tweets and Ads are really dumb it's because it does not resonate with me whatsoever. But obviously someone has determined it should be effective and also obviously I'm not actually qualified to dispute that

WGAL is at it again with their Trump campaign commercials. This time the one with a thuggish fracker disparaging Biden. America First Action PAC is behind this one. This PAC has a racist past along with supporting Nazis.  Been in trouble before. Really WGAL...NAZIS? Shame on you.

Individual-1 is pushing for an earlier debate... for what its worth, this isn't a out of bounds idea... since the first debate isn't scheduled till after some of the first mail-in ballots go out. That said... FUCK HIM. Biden campaign should not agree.
Unfortunately, Trump will lose in Nov. Biden has dementia &amp; his running mate will be a radical, but this is a referendum on Trump. Fair or unfair (mainly unfair), Trump is unpopular. Dems will look to consolidate power, and kill GOP/conservatism. Where does GOP go from there?
Sally Yates is not being considered &amp; Kamala as choice has been an open secret for months. Biden's politically smart. He's going to do the proper vetting &amp; he's not going to disqualify anyone while that's happening - and still putting his alliances together. But don't be obtuse
Biden thanks all blacks are the same.
What in the literal fuck are you on about.  Are you arguing that Biden was VP in the 50s?

As it should. It's prety obvious the democrats know they have an extremely weak candidate in Biden. This is why theyr'e pushing so hard for mail-in ballots because they know they're highly succesptable to fraud. And they also know Biden will get humiliated by Trump in the debates
Not a popular opinion, BUT, unless Biden plans to resign next spring, i think her talents and expertise would fair better as Attorney General.   I personally liked Abrams.  All in all, she'll look fly in whatever she wears.
At this point, it‚Äôs sad that he‚Äôs so much better than Trump but like...I‚Äôm emotionally numb to Biden‚Äôs gaffes. Mainly because of Trump.

It never ceases to amaze me how Trump's vocabulary is just a basket of terms that he understands--on a base level--will trigger a dopamine response in his fans if he correctly pairs them with "for" or "against."   Biden is "against the Bible" !  Catholics are "for the pro-life" !
Your criticism of Dems is so over the top (war on America?) you lose the chance to target on real weaknesses. Try moderating your criticism instead of caving in to the divisiveness inherent in conservatism. Biden can‚Äôt be made to seem the avatar of radicalism.
It is solely up to Biden to prove this wrong... and not by calling other people coke heads... by debating at a reasonable time.
Joe Biden is a blatant racist. I am well aware that many black people come from a plethora of countries each with their own rich diverse culture and background. How totally tone deaf, Joe.
Not sure if Biden‚Äôs racist but he sure does think a lot less of black people.
Joe Biden stop doing interviews challenge
Yosemite is a word he didn't quite have. Totalitarian is another word he sort of lost in usage. These are because he was simply not educated normally. Huge gaps in his vocabulary which shows he stopped learning at about 12 years old. Biden over came a stutter.
Bruhhh he is cominggggg for all these criminals and I‚Äôm so excited!!! Obama, Clinton, Biden and Podesta.. all fucking SICKOS- I hope he nails their asses to the wall !!
Insisting Black people to vote for Biden to ‚Äúsave this country‚Äù is racism at this point.

üò° In the debate, when Trump brings up the Bible (somehow he will), Biden should say ‚ÄúI challenge you to quote one verse from the Bible and explain why that‚Äôs important to you‚Äù and watch him squirm. I bet he wouldn‚Äôt be able to quote even a single verse.
Trump won‚Äôt talk about real issues. He‚Äôll just try to insult him or call him names and you better believe he‚Äôll bring up the Hunter Biden each debate. Trump is a clown
Obama and Biden didn't turn on their own country. They didn't put up with Putin's crap which Trump invites at any expense.

They are making a choice between Trump and Biden. Trump has undermined our democracy in every way possible and has corrupted the office of the presidency. Any Republicans who sign off on Trump aren't really Republicans, either. They are Trumpers.  #CountryOverParty #AmericaWakeUp

I agree!  Susan Rice is the VP Biden needs (Opinion)
He clearly was Doing Zoom or something equivalent, did you notice the camera lights? Your father has less of an IQ compared to Biden.
"...engaged in bigotry. But useful nontheless" This is the best description I've ever heard of Johnson and gives language to feelings about other Presidents that white Americans think Black people should fawn over.   Looking at you Lincoln, Kennedy, potentially Biden?

Election 2020: Trump vs. Biden on tax policy
#Biden supporters are probably too young to understand this.
I don't expect to live long enough to witness the elimination of all nuclear weapons, but I want a President who understands his grandchildren should be given a chance to live in that world. Biden knows nuclear nonproliferation. It was a centerpiece of his 36 years in Senate.
Why We‚Äôre Demanding No Cops for Veep
Biden gets that world must never again see nuclear weapons used in war. To get there, we must stop the spread of nuclear weapons, shrink global arsenals, and eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons. Trump is moving in the opposite direction: proliferating, expanding, testing.
KT McFarland dismisses Yates claim Obama, Biden never directed Russia investigation: 'Somebody did' - Fox News
In "How Soon They Forget" category....Americans should remember Obama-Biden commitment to nuclear nonproliferation, demonstrated by four nuclear summits to reinforce goal of global zero, successful arms control talks with Russia, and JCPOA to prevent Iran nukes.
This is actually sad and Jill Biden should be in jail for trotting him out like this

Joe Biden has been saying so much crazy incoherent things lately that you forgot about how much of a pervert he is!
So VP Biden knew more about the Flynn meeting with Russia than VP Pence.
Which means that VP Biden knew more about what Flynn discussed with the Russian government than VP Pence.
Have either of you even listened to Joe Biden speak over the last 40 years?  The man speaks like a plantation owner.
Remember when Joe Biden said that Barrack Obama was the first, yes, he said first African American, who was articulate, and clean, and good looking guy, this is a storybook man! No, that ain‚Äôt racist?! Wake up! C‚Äômon man!
This is you 9 days ago.
So it‚Äôs the first week of August. Today is Thursday, the week halfway over, and Joe Biden still hasn‚Äôt announced his running mate.
stuff, it‚Äôs running to ask Biden about his cognitive abilities rather than asking why Trump was administered a MOCA. For this 4th debate, it‚Äôs now not 1st asking whether Trump has even agreed to the 3 debates already set while Biden has. It‚Äôs insane when this is a pres election.
Every thing is chased after &amp;  framed as Trump puts it out there. During impeachment, they all went to Biden with the ‚Äúwill you testify for an exchange?‚Äù BS, when the Q should have been to the Rs ‚Äúyou have 53 votes, so why don‚Äôt you do it if you want Biden? For the cognitive...
If you took a deck of cards, and spread them out face down, and did the matching game. My 4 year old grandson could beat Joe Biden. I know you‚Äôre thinking, but he truly is smart! You would be right, my grandson is very smart.
Why grant a debate, when Biden produced his tax returns. Where are trumps? I wouldn‚Äôt debate without the tax returns handed over. Do townhalls instead.
When the left talks about racist, white entitlement, and white privilege, this does not pertain to Joe Biden. üò≥üôÑ The irony is, if their claim would be true, the face of that example would be Joe Biden! Or John Kerry, or John Edwards, or Ted Kennedy, or Bill Clinton, or .......
Funny. I haven't seen a Biden sign at all where I live.
He found out Biden is in his basement
Flynn was fired by Trump for not telling the VP Pence about the meeting with the Russian government. So VP Biden actually knew more about what Flynn was discussing with Russia than VP Pence.

We aren‚Äôt grading for president of the United States on a curve.  The standard is still out of 100. Joe Biden‚Äôs failing grade has NOTHING to do w/ Trump‚Äôs failing grade, aside from where they agree (war, tax cuts for the rich, fossil fuels)  This is why I‚Äôm voting third party.
Biden is toast and Dems know it.  I'm pretty sure if he gets elected Obama will be the shadow president.  Humm, Obama's 3rd term? We know Soros is the puppeteer running Obama.
And maybe, it‚Äôs 2 generations of bad decisions from people like you &amp; your peers that have led us into two elections where we‚Äôve had Hillary Clinton ü§Æ, Joe Biden ü§Æ, and Donald Trump twice (Thanks HRC!)  Maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm voting third party. These two are trash.
Maybe there‚Äôs an entire generation of kids who won‚Äôt ever be what they could be because Barack Obama and Joe Biden preferred the quarterly returns of GM shareholders to keep going up because of the bailout they cut (perverse incentive) while letting people drink the dirty water.
After 40+ years of "working for the American people" this is all you get from Biden, a plan, some else's plan at that! In 3 years Trump has done more than the previous 4 administrations combined that's 28 years of nothing! Biden was party to that too.
brilliant videos from the Daily Show contrasting Fox commentators accusing Biden of cognitive decline with new videos of Trump‚Äôs phonetic aphasias that show real cognitive decline. #morningjoe
The real answer is PA/MI/NE-2/ME-2.  Biden can win by winning the first two and either of the last two.
I will proudly mail in my ballot for Joe Biden from the great State of Dimentia.
He did not say that Biden was ahead in all 13 keys. The original video from the NYT is only 7 minutes long, you should watch it.
Like, let‚Äôs say Joe Biden wins this year.   Is he running again in four years? He be getting sworn in at 82.   Or, does he step down and Warren runs at 75? That‚Äôd be three 70+ POTUS‚Äô (Trump, Biden, Warren).  Looking ahead, Rice or Warren would be better in that regard. But idk..
Very cool ad. Shows Biden is a regular car loving his car and bringing the auto industry back to the U. S.
I hope I live to see this change. I fear that, even if Biden wins, the Left will be encouraged to take the narcotic that put them to sleep (or dulled their senses) during eight years of Obama.

It's different this time because Biden is extremely unlikely to serve his whole term. Biden put himself in a box with his WOC pledge. He needs to pick Kamala. Rice was deeply involved in the Russia fiasco, among other misadventures.

Glad to hear it. But of course voting is not enough. The mass organizing and peaceful protests are also critical. If sustained and focused that will push politicians like Biden to act in our favor.  Didn‚Äôt really have that under Clinton. But that‚Äôs my generations fault!
Well I just hope you young folk will go to the polls and vote out Trump! You don‚Äôt have to like Clinton, or Biden for that matter. But I hope we agree that we need to get rid of Trump!
Republican‚Äôs are backing Kayne‚Äôs presidential run in key states that tRump narrowly won in 2016 trying to take away enough votes to hurt Biden. People are showing themselves not to be the smartest so who knows it could work Vote n numbers to Big to Rig.

Buck, I‚Äôm not enthusiastic at all about Biden. Blah. But I would sooner vote for a jar of roaches than Donald Trump. The absolute disdain and abhorrence people hold for Trump more than makes up for the lack of passion for Joe Biden.
Trying to find a silver lining here: the national profile of all these amazing women has been significantly raised by the VP question. I'm hoping to see all of them go on the greater and greater successes, whether in the Biden admin, at the State leadership level, or in Congress.

Biden's indecisiveness is a made up story. He's doing what all nominees do. Dem voters are OK with that. We're too concerned abt 155,000 dead, joblessness, hunger, evictions, despair to worry abt the PROCESS of his decision.
Debate trump on what exactly and for what? Presidential debate are auditions and we've seen a disaster of an audition for one guy. Biden doesnt need to debate him.
A handful of people really know what Biden is thinking. The rest of this is just gossip and nonsense.

I think biden is easily convinced and doesn‚Äôt go w his own ideas he goes w voters and dem consensus. Get the house and senate to pass marijuana legally and there‚Äôs no way in hella he‚Äôd veto it. So I see no issue.
I mean for normal people like me biden seems like a super fun dude whose lived a cool life and would prolly knock down some shots and beer. Might even get him to smoke a blunt w him cause u know he can be easily convinced.

Dems took the house in 2018 by telling the American people they were more centrist politically, were not going to impeach Trump and concentrate on legislation.They lied! By using Biden they‚Äôre doing the same, misleading Americans into thinking they‚Äôre getting a centrist but not.
Joe Biden has long history of plagiarism and lying to the American people. Data shows he‚Äôs guilty of corruption via proxy with China and is owned by China. Read book by investigative reporter Peter Schweizer Secret Empires.He will not fight for America instead send jobs to China!

Lmao, what?!  Like Biden saying ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for me‚Äù wasn‚Äôt racist af? Y‚Äôall are completely deluded... half of the country is not racist. These damn old wealthy politicians might just be racist, that‚Äôs different.
Defund is being floated by their leadership and some hard left Liberals. But the Establishment Dems aren't on that Bandwagon. Keep in mind. Trump is running against Biden..He is a Centrist Establishment Democrat. It won't happen with him in office.

Even if the majority of people vote in 2020 the voters aren‚Äôt ideologically motivated they just hate trump or hate Biden. Or hate one more/less then the other. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre democrat, socialist, anarchist or liberal. Just like how not all trump voters are racist.

Agreed. Biden is establishment, not progressive. Despite wide support in the Democratic base, progressives have been locked out again.
The penultimate point is that Biden should not ignore the conduct of the bishops toward Catholic politicians on this issue. I believe, as one of these, that he has an affirmative duty to his fellows to explain one, that they are caught in bed with Trump (try to purge that image)
Marist (top rated pollster) has Biden up even more.
Aw! How much you deeply care about the wellbeing of Joe Biden really shows! üôÑ
If the bishop does say something, Biden has the right to process because the case is public. Period.  Does any Catholic politician's opinion matter as to the ability of legislature, Congress or state to ban abortion or even enact an undue burden. No. Period.
There are a few questions to unpack. The first is whether any stray priest can create scandal by denying Biden Communion Canon Law is clear. No. HIs and only his Ordinary can direct that and he has not. It is in the Canon Law and Canon Law trumps Catechism period.
I plan to vote for Biden to restore our Democracy.
How much you want to bet that Trump will declare victory in Election Night and claim all sorts of problems as the mail in votes shows that Biden wins. It will be important to fire up his base so he can make money from the MAGAs in the future.
I'm voting for Joe Biden b/c he represents my values and will do a good job as president.  I'm voting against Trump b/c he is a callous incompetent who is destroying our Democratic Republic.  Not giddy. Not enthusiastic. Determinec.  Any questions?  Now go away.

Dignitatis means that there is no Catholic religious test to hold office, nor a requirement to subvert constitutions. Biden should (if elected) explain this and how equal protection can never mean that abortion can be banned, nor will it be. Nor can USCCB OPLA work with GOP.

Sean, the DEMs true plan stated in Lance Wallnau video. Biden is going to withdraw due to health just before debates, so staying in basement till then. Harris will become presidential nominee by default. Her plan is to revers all of Trumps actions to redeem Obama!!

I think that's kind of what you missed that she does mostly appeal to the base but that's a good way to balance the ticket, excite people, and raise money.  Since Joe Biden is running for president she does a good job of activating the base which is also important.

Trump can't even talk with his whole face get out of here.  He's gonna get on stage and pee his pants and Biden will LAUGH at him until he cries.
Very Good. The Dems don't realize what America will be like if Biden wins! The MASKS mean OBEY Trial Run!
I felt that Biden/Harris will bring civility to the political discourse and restore transparency to the democratic process.
You are correct. Joe Biden and Donald Trump are identical twins. I feel so foolish that I never noticed it before.  I now know that tax policy and settling fraud suits mean absolutely nothing.

Joe Biden possibly has early onset dementia. So it it Kamala who would actually be the President if this ticket wins.  But if Democrats wanted Kamala as President... she wouldn‚Äôt have flamed out of the Dem Primary with 1% support.
Joe Biden supporters very much have "America was always great" vibes.
But it does have incumbents who are not voting the wishes of their district; so they must be voted out in November. 2Rs lost in 2018 that way. No, Texas is not a swing state ‚Äî yet
You won‚Äôt be happy with any of the Biden proposals but you will probably have no problem with the laws passed if the Dems have 51 or fewer Senators.
Texas is a swing state in the Trump era. He cannot sack Dr. Marks, but Pence or McConnell need to sack Trump for his stupidity, his temper and his attachment to Putin. Trump claimed he was like Biden. Trump lied.

Donald, you there? I just watched the Biden/Harris announcement. Joe is going to ride over you like he was on his bike the day that  made an ass of himself. Tell  to have Mother nearby when he debates  because Harris' gonna break her foot off in his ass.
I feel like relative moderates like Biden and Harris operate within the reasonable realm of the politically possible. I'm not holding my nose with this vote. #BidenHarris2020

Joe Biden has already shown that he is the better person.  would never choose a woman as v.p. His dumb ego wouldnt allow him too. Thats why he picked a sucka like pence. Nothing like an enabling yes man!!
A¬†similar poll from BlackPAC¬†in April found 55 percent of African-American voters would be more excited to turn out for Biden if he choose a Black woman like Harris to be his running mate.  Stop acting like you understand the mindset of African Americans b/c you don't. U r a ü§°
You are clueless. Black voter turnout will be like 2012. A July poll from the African-American Research Collective found that strong majorities of Black voters would be more likely to encourage friends and family to vote for Biden if he picked a Black or African-American woman.
What she means is we have power as a cohesive progressive group. Not patty cakes with Biden. If we splinter, which is what they want - we lose what little power we have.
I predict that IF Wisconsin is the state that would put Trump over the top that the legislature is going to elect the Trump delegates even if Biden eventually gets the most votes. It will be the biggest crisis in US history and I will die protesting Trump‚Äôs illegal Re-election.

Vote for Biden.  They are not morally equivalent.
The reality is that  #JoeBiden will enable things to continue as they are, it will allow  most of the center-left not comfortable with #donaldtrump dog whistlening to go to sleep and for those same people to die anyways. In the long run a Biden victory means they die in vain.
Also, what your saying will occur under a #JoeBiden #POTUS as well.  Little about biden is on the left. In addition, he has every intention on filling his cabinate with #neoliberals that set the stage for 2008. He'll be just as inattentive. His messaging is just softer.
That's correct,  but here is the issue... They Don't  Agree. Lol. It doesn't matter if theyre  democrats or not. At best they are "socially liberal" and that's a super huge stretch for Biden considering his policies. They just have a softer message now so they can get elected.
Actually no but thinking about this in pure terms of trump v Biden is faulty logic. The Dems told us to go  Ourselves. Also it prevents them from self dealing which makes them less money. Rewarding them this year sends the message to keep screwing  progressives.

American politics are the most embarrassing thing about our country. The election is in 4 months and I don‚Äôt know what joe Biden or Donald trump supports. It is just a drama show watching the news about them bashing the other person.

I think the ticket is hypocritical and it‚Äôs identity politics at its finest. I‚Äôd compare this to the same thing that the RNC and McCain did with the Alaskan Queen. Harris is supremely more qualified than Palin, but Biden tabbed her for her sex and race. In the post-BLM climate

And just in case you don't know where she stands on stuff, here's a handy primer. She's a bit left of center, but as we've seen with Biden, this administration is aware that its base is getting more and more progressive.
1) Did white Joe Biden tell a black American ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black?‚Äù and support segregationist leaders like Kamala accused him of in the debates? 2) Did Kamala Harris throw black men into prison in California for crimes she knew they didn‚Äôt commit while raising taxes? #VoteTrump2020

Biden said he'd announce VP by Aug. 1. Missed that deadline. Then said it would come first week of August. Missed that deadline. Bad look to keep missing your own self-imposed deadlines.

Oh c'mon, like Biden uses DPJ. I bet he's a Jetsuite X guy. Or Wheels Up, lol
Either or... Biden will have my vote regardless
Wholeheartedly agree. Biden won headlines and praise for that decision when he announced it in a debate in March, but now he's picking from a pool half the size of what it should be.
All of Biden's VP candidates have baggage, Klobuchar included. It's down to Harris and Rice. I'll be shocked if it's not Harris.

TO HELL WITH SUSAN RICE AND BIDEN! YES, BENGHAZI WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN! WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN YOUR LIES ABOUT PRES TRUMP AND INVESTIGATIONS OF GEN FLYNN AND THE IRAN MONEY AND CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY AND YOUR HATE OF AMERICA!
Where‚Äôs Hunter ? You ain‚Äôt black Biden is a bobble head that is a Trojan horse and empty vessel for Sanders and AOC and quid pro quo pelosi and Schumer and Robert Francis (beto) bozo Orourke !
Please when Biden says something stupid let it go let the focus be on how stupid he is but when you chime in now they‚Äôre all talking about you so just let it go when he says something stupid
You ain‚Äôt black Biden is a bobble head and Trojan horse and empty vessel for Sanders and AOC and quid pro quo pelosi and Schumer and Robert Francis (beto) bozo Orourke and rode a bike WITHOUT a helmet....
I don't care what her approval rating is she can't be VP , not this time.  Look I like her I think she has potential but we are not voting for Biden n will stay home if KH not VP. We put Biden where he is. He owe us

Gingrich: Biden embraces Chinese dictatorship |
so when Trump loses the election his cult can try to say that Biden is causing incredible tax hikes.
Biden went after Obama hard - part of the reason Biden was selected was to show Obama didn't hold grudges!  '08 was a long time ago, but it wasn't that long.
This is just the beginning of the unbelievable horse shit that Biden's VP is going to have to put up with.
You ain‚Äôt black Biden is a bobble head and a Trojan horse and an empty vessel for Sanders and AOC and quid pro quo pelosi and Schumer and Robert Francis (beto) bozo Orourke !

BIDEN DOES NOT GO TO CHURCH! HE IS IN BASEMENT!
How I read this:  Joe Biden 51% Donald Trump 40% also Donald Trump 9%  too close.
Kamala Harris is the most logical VP choice for Joe Biden. Susan Rice makes sense as part of the administration, just not as vice president.
PRES TRUMP IS DEFEATING THE FAR LEFT! HE HAS THE TOOLS WITHOUT TWITTER AND FACEBOOK! HIS RALLIES AND THE FLYING ROOSTER HAS THE DEMS ON THE RUN AND THEY ARE QUAKING IN THEIR BOOTS. BIDEN IS SO AFRAID THAT HE SPEAKS AGAINST BLACKS AND HISPANICS!
BIDEN WILL HAVE TO EXPAND BASEMENT TO LIVE IN AND BS IN WITH OBAMA AND RICE. IF HE CAN REMEMBER WHERE THE DOORS ARE.
Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt picked a VP yet because his aides have to continually talk him out of picking Sarah Palin.
If you guys think Trump is a bad speaker uhhh have you heard Biden talk yet ?
Biden didn‚Äôt beat Harris, (fear of) Sanders did.

Well that's not an answer to my question. DOMA was non-inclusive to gay people, and you're defining inclusivity and masculinity together, so are JRC and Biden more politically masculine than Bernie for supporting it? Those are your criteria, evaluate this event.
So Bernie sanders's insufficiently inclusive attitude towards queer identities is a "masculine" trait. Then, for instance, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden must be considerably more masculine than Bernie because they supported the tremendously anti-inclusive DOMA law
I don't care if his Veep pick is a loaf of bread, I'm voting for Biden.
Is it Rashida Tlaib you're talking about in terms of the anti-queer left then? She's certainly less compromising when it comes to policy, and she won't even endorse Biden.  But more importantly, what's Bernie's "violent" approach? What violence has he done?
Even the people dumb enough to support Biden know that he didn't write this
I know there‚Äôs no bottom, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll get worse. But for somebody with such a questionable relationship with the Bible to something like this. There are few things more gross.
Oh BTC, I fear that I will vote once more, not not for my choice but for the lesser of two evils. I wish I could trust Biden. I know I can‚Äôt trust Trump
I've had several arguments on here about whether Biden actually wants to accomplish anything, and I'm feeling better about falling hard on the "no" side

Screw the election. I say they have a trial by combat! tRump in one corner Biden in the other. In fact once we have candidates selected from primaries this is how it should be from now on.
Go Biden/Harris. America is waiting for you.
üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èKamala was my first choice in the primaries.  Biden's been my choice every time he ran for anything.  From the get-go I thought they'd make an excellent ticket!  Been calling for her to be his VP choice for months! #BidenHarris2020
Calling it right now. If Biden wins the election, he steps down in late 2021 citing health concerns, making Kamala Harris the first female president.
Only if the vote is ridiculously one sided in support of Biden/lHarris.  As Hans Solo warned the young man who had the force, and didn't yet know it, "don't get cocky."

Who cares if HRC won the popular vote? That‚Äôs not how we elect presidents. Trump won 84 percent of the counties. That also doesn‚Äôt matter.   For Biden to win (and he‚Äôs probably going the popular vote by 10M but again, who cares?) he‚Äôs got to flip 3 or 4 states.
Biden doesn't take any questions at all...
Trump consistently takes questions from the media lol. If Biden wants to replace Trump don't you think he would at least act like a president?
You're right, the government has no authority to tell you how to breathe.   So why not try what Biden suggested and just be responsible.  Is that asking so much?
You sound like Biden. You ok?
You made a Terrible Statement today about Joe Biden! You should be fired!

Arbitrarily mandating mask wearing is not within the purview of the President. By what authority does the federal government mandate masks?  Those little cotton masks Biden wears do nothing. They barely keep out dust.
Sure, no one would have died if Biden had been in office, wearing his little cotton masks that he fingers all the time.  They're ineffective.  They are a placebo to make you feel good.

So Biden admittedly picked the person for the 2nd highest position of power in the US based solely on their gender and race, for political gain, and we are supposed to trust his judgment and her qualifications?
Isn‚Äôt it cute how you are trying to spin the fact that there are so many talking points and valid claims as to why a Biden/Harris WH would be disastrous for out country specifically black and brown people. Just ask all those in CA.

Does anyone else dream about Obama and Biden walking into the Oval Office. Smacking trump on the head, they take off the sunglasses but leave face masks on and they tell Trump to LEAVE. The bosses are back!
I guess he is ignoring the fact that Obama - Biden inherited a 10%+ unemployment and dropped it to 4%.
The morning after the amazing night before. While the Biden/Harris ticket is amazing &amp; will charge up the base of those with hearts, empathy and the need for change. It is only a matter of time until the party of complicity with racism &amp; hate cut loose on their only target. VOTE!
Do you think the Biden camp would be smart to debate Trump and Pence.  Seems counterintuitive to me; Trump is such, that one can‚Äôt have an intelligent debate or conversation with him - Pence is little better.
Biden and Harris kicked ass and were smart, informed and articulate! üòÄüòÄ  The POS is still president and his on-camera ramblings are incoherent...ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ  Other than that nothing new...
I live next to a Trump supporter and will be acquiring many "Biden - Harris 2020" signs for my yard.
Yes, I am THRILLED that Biden picked Kamala Harris - he made the right choice to help unite American &amp; to defeat the Trump virus!  #BidenHarris

No lockdown no Biden.
This is coming from Joe "I wrote the Crime Bill" Biden.
Remember the timeline of all this though. In May Bernie was the front runner not Biden. Biden didn't get the lead until after the lockdown and all campaigns stopped. The media was the sole source of truth.
That should be a real treat. How much will Biden get from Ukraine this time?
It was so good to see you with Joe Biden. You delivered a great speech. Very powerful, very hopeful for pit and our children‚Äôs future.
Kamala Harris Is the Future, So Mike Pence May Well Be History
Vote all you want. The people have spoken. It‚Äôs Biden and Harris! A no brainer for those of us with a brain.
In a Biden world, Europe. Trump re-elected, SC.
I've helped numerous folk sun elections and none of them who followed my advise has ever lost. In the age of covid19 the strategies Biden should utilize are simple but they will be effective in reaching the people by over coming their fears
I've worked behind the scenes for decades and would have national name recognition but I turned down many request for interviews which I now regret. I could assist Biden in his efforts to become president of the United States.
This sounds like a Russian propaganda talking point, trying to paint Biden as frail and spook the Republican base into visualizing Kamala Harris as President.  As if that would be a bad thing. &gt; Fox News is State News &lt;
You didn‚Äôt hear? She talked Biden into supporting Medicare for All..
Right! And I hope both Biden and Kamala will remind American voters about it during this campaign.
I think that comment was addressed to those calling themselves leftists/progressives who are saying they won't vote for Biden in part because they think letting Trump make things worse for 4 more years will force the country to swing hard left in 2024. If we make it that long.
I bet he wasn‚Äôt happy with who and his VP will be facing during debates. Neither Trump nor Pence can handle the power and eloquence of Biden and Harris.
Your not pro-liife Mr Kasich if you support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Your not conservative. Your a traitor, and you betray everyone who helped you get into Office.  Go home, and stay out of politics. Your making a fool out of yourself, and your betraying your country.
More Biden shade.
Joe Biden is a dog face pony soldier.
You are talking about a medical doctor.  There are doctorates offered in many different fields. And Jill Biden happens to have earned one, making her a doctor.
Biden is delivering an awesome speech. Very powerful, very eloquent, very promising and full of hope for a great future.
Steve just a friendly reminder Joe Biden is not a Baby Boomer. Keep up the good work!
She's not far left to the uninformed who will believe anything Wallace says. However, she is far left, as is Biden. There are no moderate Democrats anymore.
What?  Shocking.  Didn't he reverse everything Obama did?  Yep, he did.  And Yes, Biden will reverse everything Trump did to take this country off the rails.
I agree with that. Racism is stupid. But I don‚Äôt think Trump or Biden will/can do that. It‚Äôs going to take a lot more than a president. We need time, action and patience. But what do you mean by systemic?

You do realize how many innocent people kamala put in jail right? Biden/Harris get support to get back at trump. But y‚Äôall have done no research on what they actually stand for... Trump is no where close to perfect either. But make sure you know what you‚Äôre supporting.
I think that Biden was trying to convince Harris to join his ticket. Not the other way around.
I'm calling it now, on Biden's first day he steps down and Kamala becomes president
No KellyAnne no one is ruminating over Hilary except you and Trumpeters who can't seem to move out of 2016. It's 2020 and Biden/Harris will wipe the floor with Trump. Bye bye Trumpdom! Don't let the door kick you in the arse!
Don‚Äôt forget Reagan and Bush Sr. let the CIA flood American cities with cocaine in the 80‚Äôs. Pretty sure Biden and Kamala didn‚Äôt do that lol
Some white politicians actually care about black people, would you rather have another white Vice President? At least it‚Äôs some kind of progression, Kamala is like 4 different races. Much rather have her and Biden over Trump and Pence any day
DONALD TRUMP IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED OF THE BIDEN-HARRIS TICKET.
I thought it might be a visual on the excitement of a Biden/Harris ticket.
Hey progressives: Your dude is telling you to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚úÖ
Sorry honey. YOU are not a moderate if you are choosing Biden/Harris.  Biden is an empty suit being filled with extreme Left values.  If you love them so much, why not move into one of those lovely cities being plagued by rioters?  That‚Äôs the life you are choosing for your family
Where do you get the impression that Biden and Harris want to murder and incarcerate all black people? Thought that was Trump, Bush and Reagan?
you are a total disgrace.Other countries are laughing at you. Stop name calling, playing golf, bragging about yourself and take care of business. Want to talk about bankrupting casinos? Biden/Harris all the way! #WeHaveHerBack #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
I haven‚Äôt been this excited since I voted for Obama/Biden, the first time around. I wish team Biden/Harris much success. You have a chance to make history. You can only go in one direction, and that‚Äôs up.  #WeHaveHerBack
Biden doesn't plan to run in 2024.
The biggest thing Biden has in his favor is that he is not Donald Trump.
Ohh sh you are in trouble now. I suspect you will begin to go lower than low at this point. I doubt team Biden and Harris will drop to your level so I will do the dirty work for them. #WeHaveHerBack

Because if we end up getting 4 more years of trump or if we get the first four years of Biden I hate to break it to you but we are all going to be screwed anyway that's the truth neither of these ass clowns don't care about you or this country's future
Why did they bother retracting this story in July?
If  really believes in Joe Biden and the potential of his campaign, she should resign her Senate seat before the election.   If she doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôll tell us all we need to know about her confidence in Biden.
Biden / Harris stronger than petty pence and don, the president of and for CONS!
I know not what the days up to Nov. 3 hold for any of us, but I feel a sense of peace tonight hoping that with Pres. Biden &amp; VP Harris our democracy is going to be ok, not that the path of the next few days &amp; months will be easy, but that there is a path forward. We needed it. :)
"She was very very #nasty, to ‚Äî one of the reasons that surprised me, she was very ‚Äî she was probably nastier than even #Pocahontas to Joe #Biden. She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden, and it's hard to pick somebody that's that disrespectful." - #Trump

‚ÄúIf and when Biden decides to step aside‚Äù   Joe Biden is a trojan horse. Unbelievable.
Joe Biden has officially chosen Kamala Harris as his running mate in the 2020 Presidential Election
Biden are you absolutely lost your mind  with this pic.
Token woman of color so suburban neoliberals can say "see? Biden IS woke. Forget the crime bill and his own voting history as well as Kamala's history as a prosecutor, we got our token so if Orange Man wins again it's on those silly progressives! Anyway, back to brunch!"
Awesome! Go for it Biden-Harris.
Is it really just tokenism, celebration for no other reason than Biden/the DNC selecting a biracial woman to try and look woke? Or is it that the arguably the worst VP pick in response to the distaste with cops across the country is good because, BLM is just an "annoyance"?
Honest question, what about her is amazing? She's most well known for A) being at best an incompetent and at worst dirty DA/State GA covering and helping dirty cops/letting innocent people rot and B) saying she believes Biden's accusers and dropping out before the primaries began
And I‚Äôm not even sure a Biden Harris ticket will beat trump
Whats up with the Trumps donating to her campaign? I knew any Biden pick wouldn't be as progressive as I would like - but now I'm suspicious
Actually it's on the dems for propping up a racist+senile rapist who's platform is just "I'm not Trump but I'm also for every conservative position I can be while still being referred to as a lib" and adding the cop-enabling DA that said she believes Biden is a rapist AND racist
"The senator from California fulfills Biden's pledge to name a woman and responds to the expectation that he would pick the first woman of color ever to serve on a national ticket."  I'm very happy ‚ò∫Ô∏è with #KamalaHarris as #VPHarris

It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see when we are going to hear from Joe Biden again. Now that Officer  is getting all the attention, she is the de facto candidate #BidenHarris
She has the potential to have two terms separate from Biden. Say what?

Their obfuscatory wording aside, "racists now less likely to vote for Biden" is a fine problem to have, as far as I'm concerned. The more clear it is that there's no potential benefit to chasing their votes, the better off the party and the rest of us will be.
There would have been millions die if we would have listened to Joe Biden. He would have let all flights come in from China.
Heard right wing radio speculating Biden may skip a Presidential debate painting alleged possibility as something really bad ignoring reality Trump skipped Primary debate 2016 for a veterans‚Äô fundraiser. Veterans ever get $? We know Trump used his charity as personal slush fund.

Note ‚Äújobs created‚Äù Pence bragged were already existing jobs not jobs created with people put back to work by businesses as condition of their getting COVID-19 bailout as well as 1m+ added to unemployment rolls each week + Obama/Biden had longest stretch of job growth in history.
Herman Cain is dead b/c of attending a Trump rally and you are calling Biden/Harris nuts..tweeting from a deceased mans account however vile he was while living is disgusting..Shame on you
They never have reciepts. In this instance, it is a projection. This is what the so-called ‚ÄúProgressives‚Äù were hoping for when the thought Warren had a realistic chance if being the VP choice. That or using the 25th on Biden to force Warren to the Presidency.

Wonder what 18-29 vs over 65 would say about enthusiasm for protesting. Both over 65s &amp; 18-29s now polling for Biden over Trump. Cynics might say Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù let them (old) caused 65+ shift but maybe they remember who they were in 1960s protesting for civil rights.

Another sad day for the Democratic Party. We need lower taxes and less regulation to get more jobs.  The Biden/Harris ticket wants more taxes and more regulation.  They don't seem to care about the American worker or the families they support.
Donald is doing his damndest to discredit a great man like Biden because Sonald Trump doesn‚Äôt have shit to offer America after his destructive and ineffective leadership over the last 3 1/2 years in office. Don is a disgrace that needs to be thrown out! DUMP THE TURD NOVEMBER 3RD
Respectfully, my screen shows you ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù Bishop Thomas Tobin.  From what I‚Äôve read of you I‚Äôm surprised because he tweeted Biden/Harris ticket is first time in long time a Catholic hasn‚Äôt been on dem ticket.   Odd. Since Biden is Catholic.  Was this account hacked?
The Race For The White House is being run by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  The Racist for the White House is what the Republicans do.
It sure won‚Äôt be Joe Biden.
Biden and Harris are anything but change, they‚Äôre Democratic status quo ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I‚Äôm all for people not supporting trump, but Tulsi was the better democratic candidate to choose and Jo Jorgenson is the best candidate in this election
#resist #Resisters #Resistance   I‚Äôm ready for this November‚Äôs new blockbusters:  ‚ÄúA True Hope‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe Empire Lies Smack‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe Return Of The Qualified‚Äù  Remember, the ‚ÄúFierce‚Äù is strong with Biden/Harris!
Harris isn‚Äôt perfect. Neither is Biden. No candidate is. Everyone has flaws. But, that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt fight like hell to get Biden/Harris elected
Any Klobuchar would have been an excellent choice! Joe Biden had an amazing pool of talent to choose from. I think Biden made the best choice, I‚Äôve like Kamala Harris from the start, but, there were truly no wrong answers on this one.
Should the Biden/Harris campaign play James Brown‚Äôs ‚ÄúMashed Potatoes, USA‚Äù to remind us of tRump‚Äôs daddy issues?
i don‚Äôt even smoke but this close to elections trump or biden need to push for legalization of Marijuana if they want the edge over for votes.
Tucker Carlson calls Biden-Harris the 'first entirely hollow presidential ticket in American history'   As much as Carlson has sold out America with his one-sided bias reporting, he really shouldn‚Äôt refer to anybody as ‚Äúhollow‚Äù. What a POS you are Tucker!!
I would have if I could have. But since Biden is just about to take over, I'll stay a while.
So I asked Joe Biden if he had and#y advice for me after they dragged me out of the Oval Office and I think he said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fro the Soap‚Äù! What do you think he meant?
Yeah, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are really "far left". Be honest: you guys had this tweet ready to go no matter who was picked. You got nothing. You're stuck backing the worst president in history, and you have nothing to offer the American people.
It makes them less bad than trump? What do you mean? Vote Biden, or get ready to deal with trump for 4 more years
Do you honestly think Biden is afraid to debate Trump üòÇ have you seen all of the dumb üí© Trump has said just in the last 24 hours..
And Biden isn't intimidated by it.   Trump's thin (orange) skin couldn't handle a valid criticism (or figure out how to grow from it).  Trump's comment speaks volumes to the difference in character between the two presidential candidates!
18-39 age group historically least likely to vote will win for Biden along with white suburban women who don‚Äôt like being misogynistically stereotyped as ‚Äúhousewives‚Äù by Trump any more than as racists not wanting low income housing. For 1st time more Americans under 39 than over.
Biden/Harris 2020  #BlueWave2020  They'll never know what hit 'em!
I don't have a lot to say about the VP pick because there is no one he could have reasonably picked I wouldn't have liked better than I like Joe Biden.  My plans to vote for the Democratic candidate to unseat Donald Trump weren't going to change based on his pick.
It's also fully possible that Senator Harris will speak both in the designated VP nom spot *and* speak before Biden? She might want a chance to speak for herself and then bring it more towards unity and hyping up the candidate towards the end.

Great pic of you both. Congrats Kampala - I have to tell you I was hoping that VP Biden would pick you. Good Luck and I for sure will be voting for you.
I kinda expected Biden to shock the world and say he was going with his gut so choosing a woman nicknamed Mustang Sally or Rizzo from Grease as his VP.
Biden: *announces anyone as his VP*  The right: that is the worst mistake he could make
I am THRILLED with the choice of Kamala Harris for Biden‚Äôs VP! #BlueTsunami2020
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate  via
I am going to have to warm to her; but I trust Biden's judgment.
If Biden dont hurry tf up
Person needs to think of Biden as bus not candidate. If goal is get further left than Joe is going best to get on bus with Joe &amp; go as far left as Joe is going.  Why?  Because not going left not voting Joe allows Trump to take country and this person opposite way from their goal.
That ‚Äúnerdy ass‚Äù is a lawyer, and has more qualifications to speak on politics and laws than most people you probably site or follow.   Can‚Äôt call his followers braindead or ‚Äúwashed‚Äù when you‚Äôre ‚Äúridin with Biden‚Äù who‚Äôs campaign promises are ‚Äútrump, but ‚Äúbetter‚Äù‚Äù
In contrast, all of the women in consideration to be Biden's VP are capable, accomplished, intelligent women.  Sarah Palin is none of those things. This is why she no longer has a political career. Where does Sarah Palin go to recover her career? She doesn't.
A pretty accurate alessay on the choice we face this November... Why I Want Biden to Lose More than I Want Trump to Win
JOE BIDEN BABY!!!! FLUSH THE TURD NOVEMBER 3RD!!!! #BidenLandslide2020
To Ben, ‚ÄúBiden rode a bike‚Äù is a bad comeback, but ‚Äútrump can remember five words‚Äù is a good reason to re-elect him
Guys I already know I tweet WAY TO MUCH ... HOWEVER, when Biden announces his VP this week ...lets just say there will be no hard feelings from me if you unfollow me lmao
Just this week your daddy pronounced Yosemite ‚ÄúYo Semite‚Äù and Thailand ‚ÄúThighland‚Äù. Yeah, Biden is the one having issues. The last thing your dad rode was Stormy Daniels, Biff.
My husband supports Donald Trump and I support Joe Biden.  Makes for an interesting house sometimes.  Anyone else have this in their house? Not good.
Here in Gettysburg PA it‚Äôs about even. Biden is concentrating resources in key states
If biden gets elected. November 4th. If Trump gets reelected 4 more yrs!
Its been six yrs since Obama/Biden decided to turn their backs on law enforcement agencies causing officers to become targets all over the false "hands up" bullshit!
You have to be delusional and just plain stupid if you even think about. Voting for Biden! Come on be real!
Ummm Obama/Biden was the one to enact the veterans choice not him she called him out and he can‚Äôt stand it
I‚Äôm guessing this was just another ‚Äúslip of the tongue‚Äù   Just like his ‚Äúpoor kids are just as smart as white kids‚Äù
‚ÄúBiden and trump aren‚Äôt the same‚Äù  *copy and pastes trumps econmonic policy* ü§£ü§£

And i thought football players were tough??? I work in healthcare , if I didn‚Äôt show up, i would be fired!!! In the famous words of Biden, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon man!!‚Äù
Yeah, you just did it. I posted something about Biden. You ran back to trump.

No deflecting is   Dems- ‚ÄúTRUMP IS BAD VOTE FOR BIDEN‚Äù  R‚Äôs - ‚Äúummm Biden is bad too‚Äù   Dems - ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just defending trump‚Äù  R‚Äôs - ‚Äúand you‚Äôre just defending Biden‚Äù   See how it goes in circles? Meanwhile independents (me) are telling you they both suck and are =
Deflecting is when someone asks why you vote for Biden and all of your answers contain trump
Btw, here‚Äôs what democrats think about y‚Äôall
Seriously?  Republicans are busting on Joe Biden because he made a mistake and has apologized,when they have Trump as their candidate?  I have looked most of you up.  You never supported Biden. F off!
I think u are a great person even though I would never vote for Biden. But u doing what u think is right for ur kids future while being ill , that is amazing.
Trump never said to put disinfectant up the butt... he said the virus would ‚Äúgo away‚Äù because literally every virus ever has... Putin ‚Äúguides‚Äù him? Biden was spreading Chinese propaganda at the beginning of covid... where have you been?
Some nerves talking about Trump being a traitor. Biden is a proven traitor along with Obama and many others in office. What‚Äôs funny is you think it‚Äôs ok for some but not others. If anyone is a traitor they should be gone!!!!!!! No matter who it is.
Biden says racist, and pedophile like üí© all the time but the media would have you convinced otherwise. Like I‚Äôve said, I‚Äôm not the biggest trump guy, not even gonna vote for him, but to act like Biden is better... is just a lie you have to keep telling yourself to feel better
Right, Biden didn‚Äôt help write the crime bill (called a racist bill) didn‚Äôt say he didn‚Äôt want his kids to grow up in a ‚Äúracial jungle‚Äù   Also didn‚Äôt just say the African-American community is not diverse and all think the same lol
Then we'd better hope Senate Republicans are voted out so that when he gets impeached right away the Senate won't keep him in office. But-- far better for everyone to vote him out and not just assime Biden will win or others will go vote trump out.
Biden isn‚Äôt better than a ‚Äúracist‚Äù mainly because he is also one ü§£
It is indefensible, it‚Äôs also indefensible to put in a 77 year old man with a checkered past, signs of dementia and who‚Äôs teeth fall out when he talks. Biden is JUST as bad. But everybody‚Äôs defense of why we should elect him, is Trump ü§£
Biden could pick my high school bully and I‚Äôd still vote for him before the orange blob.
When did I tell anyone to vote for trump? Plus, if trump is a racist Biden is JUST as racist lmao
No the people running his campaign claim they do. Biden‚Äôs healthcare plan is just to re-establish Obamacare and that caused the middle class to go without healthcare or pay an insane premium while poor people just reaped the benefits
Biden‚Äôs message is anything but clear
Oh please show me where Biden is this great noble candidate to be president. Please show me without saying ‚Äúbut trump‚Äù
An idiot who says dumb üí© but can form a sentence and knows where he‚Äôs at. Biden hides in his basement talking in circles lmao.
Biden is the definition of ‚Äúunfit for president‚Äù
Yes, Biden is against God.  That's why he has a cross on his forehead every Ash Wednesday and the Godly Trump is on the golf course most Sundays.
Trump: Joe Biden &gt; GOD
In the grand scheme of things, I don't think Biden can say anything worse than the "You ain't black" gaffe lmao so this to shall pastJoe Biden has no power to change that, nor does Trump.

Agreed. Biden is establishment, not progressive. Despite wide support in the Democratic base, progressives have been locked out again.
The penultimate point is that Biden should not ignore the conduct of the bishops toward Catholic politicians on this issue. I believe, as one of these, that he has an affirmative duty to his fellows to explain one, that they are caught in bed with Trump (try to purge that image)
Marist (top rated pollster) has Biden up even more.
Aw! How much you deeply care about the wellbeing of Joe Biden really shows! üôÑ
If the bishop does say something, Biden has the right to process because the case is public. Period.  Does any Catholic politician's opinion matter as to the ability of legislature, Congress or state to ban abortion or even enact an undue burden. No. Period.
There are a few questions to unpack. The first is whether any stray priest can create scandal by denying Biden Communion Canon Law is clear. No. HIs and only his Ordinary can direct that and he has not. It is in the Canon Law and Canon Law trumps Catechism period.
I plan to vote for Biden to restore our Democracy.
How much you want to bet that Trump will declare victory in Election Night and claim all sorts of problems as the mail in votes shows that Biden wins. It will be important to fire up his base so he can make money from the MAGAs in the future.

Because half of the nation wants Trump to win. The other half is 50/50 on whether or not they think Biden is capable of a 40 hour work week (including
After learning how many people Kamala Harris put in jail (especially black people) for non violent offenses, it makes Biden‚Äôs ticket as evil as Trumps. I did some research after seeing Tulsi go at her in the primary, it‚Äôs worse than I anticipated üò¢
Give me 3 non-emotional, non anti-Trump reasons to vote FOR Biden.  Actual policy considerations, not BS
stop demonizing ppl in safe blue/red states for their discomfort in voting for biden/harris and consideration for voting third party &amp; redirect that energy towards reaching the groups that clinton lost in 2016 lol
Dignitatis means that there is no Catholic religious test to hold office, nor a requirement to subvert constitutions. Biden should (if elected) explain this and how equal protection can never mean that abortion can be banned, nor will it be. Nor can USCCB OPLA work with GOP.
Vote Biden to save our Democracy.

Ari, watch Dem plan by Lance Wallnau. Biden to drop out for health reasons for debates, Harris steps in as Presidential Nominee, Beto might be VP, We are about to be blindsided. Obama, Soros, Carvelle and the like paying for DEMs to take over. It‚Äôs a set-up!! They are dirty
We aren‚Äôt really sure when the boom ended. Harris is a really young boomer or a really old Gen Xer. Biden isn‚Äôt a boomer.
trying to get someone‚Äôs attention. The Dem playbook mentioned by Lance Wallnau. Biden to drop out before debates for health reasons, Harris moves in as presidential nominee, Beto might be VP.. I believe they had this plan all along. Warn Trump campaign.
dem team cont‚Äôd. Bozo Beto to be VP nominee to get our guns.. it is clear if you think how they hide Biden.. hoe Beto stepped back.. and the black female to change our country. Big monies, Sorro, Carvelle, Obama funding all this! Important, watch video from Lance
Sean, the DEMs true plan stated in Lance Wallnau video. Biden is going to withdraw due to health just before debates, so staying in basement till then. Harris will become presidential nominee by default. Her plan is to revers all of Trumps actions to redeem Obama!!

I for one could not morally vote for someone like Biden, unless maybe he admits it and owns up to all the racist things he‚Äôs said over the years.
Notable that the only criminal guilt to come from the substance of Russiagate is an FBI agent working for Obama/Biden/Clinton/Deep State.   #FoxNews
So Biden is good since he just fingered his female staffer?
Find it hard for a Trump supporter to insult Biden for repeating the 3rd grade, considering that many of them barely finished it and any grade beyond that
Kira Davis: Maybe It's Time to Admit Joe Biden Doesn't Think Very Highly of Black People
I think that's kind of what you missed that she does mostly appeal to the base but that's a good way to balance the ticket, excite people, and raise money.  Since Joe Biden is running for president she does a good job of activating the base which is also important.
Just look at voting as a peaceful protest against the person you aren‚Äôt voting for. Kamala should win in a landslide. I mean Biden.
If you are truly a concerned citizen than voting  is easy. Biden is owned by CHINA
Has nothing to do with 2020 if we really want to talk about history there is a long list of Democrats and racism. Dont forget if you dont vote Biden you ain't black üòÇüòÇ
Maybe Biden could tell what his policies would be if he could put together a complete coherent sentence. Come to think of it, you sound a lot like him. #TermLimits
Biden is going to be the first Oreo President.
I recall the China travel ban being labelled 'racist' by Biden.
Mentioning abortion is something to be done in the primaries, not the general election. AFTER the election, a President Biden has the moral duty to quietly correct the bishops on their misreading of the Constitution and on Dignitatis Humanae, which neither they,

With every new poll I see showing how far ahead Biden is, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that it means nothing. Looking at the example of Belarus, a stark reality surfaces that fighting the gutter with polls doesn‚Äôt work. The Dems better find an alternative more vicious path.
Yeah this one is gonna get flagged. LOL. Lets just hope the Biden campaign is smart enough not to retweet it.
You completely miss the point its about holding politicians accountable and wanting acrual progressive legislation that is massively supported hell even by people in the same party and with Biden and Kamala history and voting track record its unlikely anything will change
Overconfidence.  There is plenty of support for Biden.  Just went through parts of my old neck of the woods in Southcentral PA, a conservative part of the state... saw more Biden signs, but very few signs overall.

Overall, his record is well worth giving him a second chance. Mostly Covid19 jobs were lost but more jobs &amp; lives would have been lost under Biden.
Based on records:   Biden will lock them up or deport them.  Harris will go after the parents for truancy.
At least one former Iowa Congressman has had his meat cut (Chelsea Clinton‚Äôs father law); as far as I know it was not performed by Joe Biden though

Biden and Harris set for briefing and speeches on coronavirus pandemic Thursday
Harris just showed why Biden chose her
Because we have a Senate majority who is enabling this mess.  Pray for a Biden/Harris victory; otherwise, turn the lights out and close the door.
She‚Äôs not African American. Her ancestors were not slaves. The black vote won‚Äôt go to Trump, but it‚Äôs sure as hell not going to Biden now
Joe Biden possibly has early onset dementia. So it it Kamala who would actually be the President if this ticket wins.  But if Democrats wanted Kamala as President... she wouldn‚Äôt have flamed out of the Dem Primary with 1% support.
Joe Biden supporters very much have "America was always great" vibes.
The Biden boat momentum is building.
But it does have incumbents who are not voting the wishes of their district; so they must be voted out in November. 2Rs lost in 2018 that way. No, Texas is not a swing state ‚Äî yet
The reason why a lot of people don‚Äôt support Biden‚Äôs choice on Harris as VP is cuz they don‚Äôt want to have a black female running for that position. They ain‚Äôt ready for it cuz Obama did a better job as president than anyone else especially Trump
You won‚Äôt be happy with any of the Biden proposals but you will probably have no problem with the laws passed if the Dems have 51 or fewer Senators.
Texas is a swing state in the Trump era. He cannot sack Dr. Marks, but Pence or McConnell need to sack Trump for his stupidity, his temper and his attachment to Putin. Trump claimed he was like Biden. Trump lied.

People are more likely to comment if they have something negative to say. I wouldn't have chosen Harris over some other options but she's a solid choice. When Biden is president things will be better than they currently are under Trump, and that's all that matters
Joe Biden says he would prevented all this by consulting Anthony Fauci.  Wow... who would have thought of that?

Joe Biden likely has early onset dementia, so Kamala Harris would be the actual President if they won.  Even Dems didn‚Äôt want her... that‚Äôs why she dropped out of the race with effectively zero percent support.

Biden/Harris One is senile, the other is a lunatic
To be fair, that wasnt his argument. Democratic voters seeing all the same issues (inequality, the drug war/PIC,  the MIC) persist under Biden would potentially move THEM towards socialism.   I think more people will move left regardless, due to **gestures vaguely at everything**

Are people overlooking joe biden and kamala Harris‚Äôs imperfections and voting for them bc there is a black person on the ticket? I want to know.

Ukraine is Biden's burden to prove innocence. I don't recall the detail that Trump did not violate anything.  He has lost millions of dollars in business ever since. Obama &amp; Clinton made millions of dollars since.
That adds to the election suspense. People will be jumping at the bit to tell their side of the story once Biden is elected.
I'm too stupid to look anything up so I'm gonna continue to shout into the void that is the morons I interact with that Biden is the worst thing ever.
I can't say what I want under Dem's cancel culture. I don't think Trump is collaborating with Putin at all. I firmly believe Biden will give our national interest to Xi. He can kneel to the mobs, he will also bow to Xi.
Biden chose a running mate only to fit the radical left political correct narrative. He picked Kamala for her RACE and GENDER, not for her character or resume. She has none. Identity politics is the CORE of Dem. Without it, Dem can't breathe. It's a divisive &amp; dangerous ideology.
why is the biden campaign not engaging with america's top hatters to come up with a truly inspirational hat? why have we completely ceded the hat game to trump?
Biden nor harris seem to want to take any questions from the press.         My first question to each of them would be, Joe how would you bring our jobs back from China. And harris are you sleeping with joe to be his running mate???
Biden repeatedly told leftists not to vote for him while the Democratic Party was mobilizing to destroy Sanders and write a platform that rejects the left agenda. Why don't you go lecture the Democratic Party and the Biden campaign about that instead of scolding leftists?

This part especially. Y'all are decrying Biden as offering nothing in his plan, when his platform states he will forgive the debt of PUBLIC school graduates, and private HBCU and MSI grads, who are making less than $125,000.  That seems like millions of people will get relief.

No concessions just have the post office funding reinstated and walk away. Joe Biden will handle the rest after November 3rd
Since NEITHER of these bastards supports my agenda, why would I vote for them?  And since the very things Trump does were allowed to happen by Biden and his ilk, I‚Äôm very comfortable voting for 5% and an actual left party that supports my interests this time around.
To be honest. A vote for Biden will only embolden the crony establishment. You are better off voting for someone the establishment hates. If Trump wins, we could see a collapse of establishment. GOP is already transforming, Dems need to do the same. Pelosi will be gone.
Quick aside: John McCain is my favorite elected official of my lifetime. I revere him like I revere my grandfather. I still grieve their passings.  McCain knew that President Obama loved this country. He knew it of Obama‚Äôs VP, Joe Biden, firsthand through genuine friendship.
Wait, are you fuckers saying Biden is going to die?  What the hell
You support Trump and think Biden is the mentally incompetent one? Trump thinks the 1918 flu pandemic happened in 1917 and ended WW2. He can't ride a fucking bike or walk down a ramp. He's mentally and physically unsuitable to be president,  which is one reason he's so bad at it.
So at this point, it's the principle for me. I still want/need more info, but just know... even though I'm no KH stan, I do stand for black women. And my vote for her and Biden on Nov 3 is a direct smack back at everyone who doesn't.

You are so right!! Got my Biden cap the other day and will proudly wear it in front of the egg heads!!

The US postal service is not the only path to a Biden/Harris victory.
It's not either Trump's authoritarianism or socialism. Biden isn't pushing for public ownership of the means of production, or anything like it, and that's the definition of socialism.

Oh, you mean The Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014? &amp; the bipartisan FUTURE Act? Biden was in the room when they took down Bin Laden.

1/ I am going to vote for Biden/Harris. You should too. They do not have all of my policy wishes, and after they are elected I will continue to push them to be more progressive. Some will say they will sit this out because they aren‚Äôt excited about Biden/Harris #Election2020
Vote Biden. This is not about loving Biden it‚Äôs about getting Trump out of office. Any vote other then Biden is for Trump. Biden has compassion and his VP will not be in the background. Trump is a danger to our future and present so it seems.
I think today I will post dumb shit on the internet  [Sits at kitchen table, opens laptop, logs on to Twitter, takes a long sip of coffee while staring out at the clear morning sky]  Ah, what a wonderful day to be a Biden supporter
Who wouldn't since Biden can't even string a sentence together and looks like he has early stages of Dementia
I spoke with  During her campaign, Kamala Harris called to ban #Fracking. We're hopeful her addition to the ticket will make a Biden Admin stronger than would otherwise be. And we'll work hard to make sure it happens.
Sanders favorability is high among Dems. Polls suggest voters thought Biden had a better shot at beating Trump. Again, that's what the Dem est. presented on the Monday before Super Tuesday. Twitter isnt RL. Only 7% use it, and a fraction of that is on political twitter.
She was picked because she's qualified! Biden promise to choose a woman because for too long highly qualified women have not had the opportunities afforded to men in our patriarchal society especially privileged white men.
If there‚Äôs as much of an imbalance between D and R voting by mail as polls have indicated, I don‚Äôt think people fully grasp how little of the mail in vote needs to be delayed into rejection to swing a close Biden state to a close Trump state.
We don‚Äôt know their plan....Harris and Biden not answering questions from reporters so far. They pop out and say ‚ÄúTrump is bad‚Äù and run back to their hiding places. If anybody is going to talk, for any length of time, it‚Äôs only gonna be Harris, Biden couldn‚Äôt hold it together.
It's about time. And hopefully more to come. We deserve better than the Obama/Biden cabal's effort to weaponize the State against political opponents.
THATS YOUR FUCKING FAULT!!! JOE BIDEN WANTS TO FIX THE SHIT THAT THE REPUBLICANS FUCKED UP!!!!
New poll: Biden expands lead over Trump to double digits.  #FridayFeeling #FridayThoughts #FridayMotivation #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #VoteOutTrump #TrumpisLosing #TrumpIsaLoser #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica #BlueTsunami2020
Exactly- and just wait till after the election-  If we win- trump will go on a demolition rampage through government agencies  And if we lose? Or if he -WHEN he contests Biden win? I‚Äôm truly terrified
Id argue that refusing to peacefully transition power is probably one of major sticking points of a government falling into fascism and since biden didnt do that in 2016   I cant call him a facist.
By then I think they will have basically conceded the election and be working to sabotage the early days of the Biden admin. If they do happen to win, then it wont matter anyway.
And don't forget how racist Biden is too! They're really a pair, aren't they?
Im honestly confused with this argument.  One of the arguments made for bernie is that he would appeal to those disillusioned republican voters and that would carry him to victory and now when Biden is doing it somehow becomes a flaw?
You seemed to have skimmed over my specifications. Establishment dems are going further right- Biden is proof ie voting/bill history and how recently his stances ‚Äúchanged‚Äù (hard to believe bc it‚Äôs always an empty promise with others) voter dems are going further left
So does Biden.

How hasn't Biden made outreach to the progressives?
it‚Äôll be interesting if biden/harris get elected because I feel like both progressives and conservatives will be attacking them, but for completely utterly different reasons.
questions like this make me think about how administrations shift rightward once elected and no one has held kamala or biden accountable up to this point  how has pushing ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù like mosby left worked so far?  but what do i know i don‚Äôt have any letters after my name
Who is we? Another one with multiple personality disorder.  Forget Biden's cognitive test. His voters need mental health checks like now.
#Deplorables have to vote in droves to fight back the corruption of #FakeNews the Democrat mouthpiece as well.  #KamalaHarris distorts and lies just like #Kavanaugh hearing.
Now, who's the corrupt ones? Then you have Biden that has been blatantly racist and involved in obvious corruption with Ukraine, and Harris who has incarcerated more people for minor drug crimes than any prosecutor in the country. And laughed about if she ever smoked weed herself
Yo, where my ‚ÄúDems are just as bad / Hillary and Biden are warmongers‚Äù lefties at?
You do know what "accused" means, right? WTF are you talking about "programmed" to have common sense? And not use the ramblings of some hysterical internet troll as my "evidence"? You address Biden by talking about Trump. That's how desperate you are to make a point.
Latest says 4000 more just before the election (political pawns, great way to use troops) the remainder maybe in April. (possibly moved up to February if Trump loses (to deny biden the credit)
I saw it in real time so unfortunately no evidence. It was around this post with a selfie with Biden saying something like ‚Äúlove Biden!‚Äù And ended it with ‚ÄúAnd of course Bernie Sanders is nowhere to be seen!‚Äù But literally Bernie was campaigning in low income neighborhoods then
Queer Eye isn‚Äôt the same once I found out Karamo was a die hard Biden supporter for the last year and continuously bashed Bernie for not showing up to fundraising rallies
Bernie was turned against because of his followers when Biden/Harris supporters have been way worse. That was the ONLY reason everyone was so against him. You should maybe talk to Karamo about this too. He‚Äôs been bashing Bernie and praising Biden since before Super Tuesday
finish the job???  He hasn't started yet.... Biden 2020
Biden is mandating wearing a mask from the time you leave your home if elected. Including outdoors. Tsk 2 ur buddy to figure out critical thinking skills That means all day everyday from the time you leave home. Stop being so eager to give away your freedom.
I feel good about Biden/Harris 2020. Good enough to donate some üí≤üí≤.
But supporting Biden is smart? And he been in politics for how long? At this point I dont think anybody on here actually research. Yall watch the news and believe it
we're failing at (1) and (2), which all but guarantees a decade of recession again, as far as I can tell. Even Biden and a democratic majority in the senate is likely far too late to not cause further, deep,  irreparable harm.

Spot on. In states where true margin is close for Biden (1% or so), USPS slowdown needs only keep 4% of mail ballots from being counted to swing to Trump, at current polled rates of D v. R mail voting. Mail ballots already rejected ~1%, disproportionately among D leaners.
The majority of Trump Supporters already enjoy Social Security and Medicare. They oppose the Biden Liberal Agenda, yet none of them will return their SS Checks, and not whip out that Medicare Card to have their Toenails Clipped.
You know nothing about me except I prefer Trump to Biden. What makes you the sole authority on right and wrong that is between me and God. Once upon a time in America you could have opposite points of view and not have the other side denigrate and try to destroy you
They‚Äôre not worried about that. They expect  to be POTUS within weeks after the inauguration. Wait for the leaks about Biden‚Äôs aloofness in meetings etc
As a (OK) Boomer whose 1st opportunity to vote was during the Reagan era, I‚Äôve voted AGAINST a candidate by voting for his or her opponent many times. Was Biden my 1st choice? No. Was Harris my 1st VP choice? No. But I will happily &amp; proudly support them because...well, tRump!

If the paw fits...treat her no different than any man..isn't that what you snowflakes want? At least I put my name to my tweets and don't hide behind some liberal propaganda handle. Trump cares more about this country and the American people than Biden who only cares money.
Really? Read what joe plans for you!
I don‚Äôt care if you have to hold your nose..  think what‚Äôs best for the country. Vote for the person who will surround himself with brilliant people. Biden/ Harris
If Biden gets his way, I have to watch professional athletes play sports without a mask. Yet I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go on a walk outdoors without a mask. Logic?
pissing off some of the only young people who actually want to vote for Biden seems like a dumb move
It appears that way but who knows what happens if Pete and Klobachar drop out without them and Beto O‚ÄôRourke endorsing Biden the day before Super Tuesday. The party did engineer Sanders going up against establishment Voltron while splitting the vote with Warren.
Vote For Biden-Harris!
Sure, the GOP equals ISIS even though we took it out after #Biden &amp; #Obama let it reconstitute itself after not getting a status of forces agreement with/Iraq, which Leon Panetta said was there for the taking.  And, then of course, they couldn't get rid of it.
Wow! The diversity pic trumped policy again. So much for policy or integrity. Biden wrote the Clinton Crime Bill that locked up milluons if non-violent drug offeners most of them Black men. Like my late crack addicted father.
The thing is, if they weigh by education and accurately weigh by race, Biden still leads, but it‚Äôs more like 7 or 8, which is in line with averages. Don‚Äôt know why they just won‚Äôt do that!
Loook at the privileged! They can play basketball without a mask but Biden says we can‚Äôt take a walk without one!!!!!!! ü§¨ you

Since it (trump) will not attend the inauguration voluntarily, it will try to block the inauguration entirely, trump should be arrested immediately after Biden and Harris have sworn the Oath of Office.
My takeaway: we have a deep, deep bench.  How Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries
A big part of Biden‚Äôs strategy seems to be this mask thing. Seen a long commercial about it in North Carolina. we don‚Äôt need a Federal Mask Mandate. States can do their own thing and would set a horrible precedent
Everyone should retweet this with a message to retweet to others, too, as this is frankly very worrisome and disturbing.  I never heard this b4, and it's Biden speaking, while politics aside this is truly a mental health issue;-(
We'll add you to the Biden column
I was going to vote for Biden, but this intelligent appraisal of the zeitgeist has changed my mind, boy howdy!
Biden was only able to to do those things because of the overtine window at the time.... Trump doesn't follow that window at all....biden does...we are now going to push it farther left. BLM - Justice Dems - we are coming out in force to push it and keep it. We will get our power
Twitter poll should have Biden by a landslide since most of us are liberal on here. Scary it‚Äôs that close. Vote
Damn! That is a generous donation! I donated 50 yesterday and bought a Biden/Harris hat. Been waiting for the announcement to get the merch and now it's finally here.
Well that is because Trump only has 4 years..I don't support Biden however, what would a 40 year record of Trump look like vs Bidens 40 year record?
Biden voters don't just want your vote they want you to somehow be excited about Biden/Harris for some reason. Like damn since when is enthusiastic consent so important to yall?
Do you believe that at the end of Biden's term he would give up power and allow whoever was elected in 2024 to take the office?
He has been doing 3-hour press conferences for weeks, if not months.  Let ME stand and ask Joe Biden in an open press conference "Why did you lie about your son getting kickbacks from a foreign country?"

Here's a campaign idea  take the Biden/Harris bus down to Mitch McConnell's house, camp out there with  and demand the Senate reconvene and vote on the house-passed HEROES act. I feel like that would play well.
Twitter commentary is not journalism, even coming from excellent investigative journalists like Ms. Webb.  They do have every right to comment, as as do I.  Biden wasn‚Äôt my first choice, but he‚Äôll certainly manage the pandemic better, and fewer will die.  Why trash him now?
At this point I cant see me voting blue. 60 years of failed policies for black Americans meanwhile pushing for more immigration. Both Biden and Harris oppose #Reparations. Based on their track record, both are anti black. Fuck em both.
I deactivated Facebook because the last thing I want during a pandemic is a news feed filled with terrible takes from Democratic voters who obviously learned nothing from 2016. They're already practicing blaming progressives/leftists for a Biden/Harris loss, and I just can't.
What are you talking about? It wasn‚Äôt Trump vs Obama remember. It was Trump vs Clinton. So because I think Trump and Biden are terrible candidates and we can do better - I‚Äôm a racist, white privileged KKK supporter??  Dude - you lose credit to your cause when you start grasping.

Just watched  speaking, and saying that Joe Biden ‚Äúignored the doctors and scientists, and instead, made decisions based on politics.‚Äù I literally had to check my pulse to be certain I hadn‚Äôt entered some alternate universe!
So in a state where Trump was heading to 60-40 defeat, and 78% of his 40% votes in person and 28% of Biden‚Äôs 60%, Election Day results look like 65% Trump. Still 52% of the vote outstanding. But that 52% is 83% D. If These measures stop 1/4 of mail ballots, Dems don‚Äôt crack 50%.
Am I the only one who remembers how sure everyone was that Trump couldn‚Äôt possibly win in 2016?  Anyway, Dems in office don‚Äôt actually care. If Biden wins, great. If Biden loses, they get 4 more years of fantastic fundraising while pretending to maintain ‚ÄúThe Resistance.‚Äù

That's creepy joe Biden for you !
And before people say that Biden/Harris do have a climate change plan, I'd like to just point out that it is not factually good enough to stop the inevitable doom that is our Earth becoming a hellscape. If you refuse to listen to the facts and admit this, you might as well-
Just to be clear, Biden/Harris are so far stuck up inside Wall Street's rectum that I have very little hope that they will reduce fossil fuels to the extent we actually need to save our planet, but they believe in science, they just refuse to listen to it.
My first and foremost concern is the environment. And Biden/Harris will ultimately fail us, but the GOP think solar panels and windmills cause cancer. They don't. So...

Well, he was under oath, and it‚Äôs almost a statistical certainty that he lies less than his former boss?  Also I just like to point out that the dystopian future that is alluded to under a Biden administration by Trump is the one we‚Äôre living in right now while Trump is in power

Number  Biden is not our President. It was not his job to protect us nor did he have any authority in the present administration.He wore a mask spoke out on what he could. With the power to unite the people Trump chooses to let the virus mow us downNo help,no empathy,just death.
Biden chose a running mate only to fit the radical left political correct narrative. He picked Kamala for her RACE and GENDER, not for her character or resume. She has none. Identity politics is the CORE of Dem. Without it, Dem can't breathe. It's a divisive &amp; dangerous ideology.

I would be willing to bet that "most" female politicians don't bow down, just that most of the ones we see (ie. those who are elected) do because they are rewarded for it, and punished for not.   This piece really put that dichotomy in stark terms for me:
I'm definitely watching my boy Bernie and my girl AOC...pass on the rest...mayne Joe biden and see if he gafs or not
Joe Biden Dumb Ass Really Threw the Election away üòÇ
We are going to come out and Vote 45 out of office we support Biden Harris go all the way Baltimore loves you bothüëçüëç
They won't hurt him. People understand MSM better now. And yes I want Trump to beat Biden.
My specific question was about the urgency though.. Because it was being framed that Biden wont do meaningful police or healthcare reform, which is of critical importance to millions.. This true, but neither will Trump, and voting green wont get those policies in either.

How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: A search that forged new stars, friends and rivalries
Biden chose a running mate only to fit the radical left political correct narrative. He picked Kamala for her RACE and GENDER, not for her character or resume. She has none. Identity politics is the CORE of Dem. Without it, Dem can't breathe. It's a divisive &amp; dangerous ideology.
Hahahaha, okay. You've joined Gege abi. All I know is o don't like Biden
Huge WW admirer here but I sure wish you‚Äôd hold your fire on Biden until 11/4.  Hard to see a positive risk/benefit ratio for criticizing him now.
Lol back it up with a news source... I can when I say kamala is a dirty prosecutors and sell out like biden.
Do they think Biden will not seek a 2nd term, or that he will not  have/complete a 1st term?
We will react with our Vote in November Biden Harris all the way üëçüëçüëç
Precisely!  Just look at what former VP Biden has accomplished in his nearly 50 years in Congress.  He did so much, now he has to get to the White House to fix all of it.
I get the urgency, but isnt voting green also a long term play? Neither Biden nor Trump will pass M4A, so I dont really get that.  I'm not about vote shaming, Biden and Harris are corporatist shills. I just think they are more likely to bend to Justice Dems than Trump.
He is.   will never get over Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.  He fears strong women (Hillary, Kamala, Nancy) and he‚Äôs a bigot (Obama, Harris, M. Waters).  He‚Äôs so afraid of Biden that he tried to bring in another country and is undermining our postal service.
It hurts that my parents actually like biden
Biden/Harris have already won the election on who can run the U.S.  They better start dealing with the cheating the GOP has set up and deal with it RIGHT NOW!!!
omfg looking at all the responses to this tweet and this is what I see:  1. Let's have 50 speakers 2. Let each person have at least 15 minutes 3. Dump everyone over 50 4. Make Biden commit to #M4AllNow or I'm not voting 5. Make Biden commit to #GreenNewDealNow or I'm not voting
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô Biden-Harris "are labeled as the most pro-abortion presidential ticket in the history of our nation."

Interesting. You rarely see HRW, ONU, even Bergoglio raising their voices against the atrocities committed by this narco Communist Regime. Why now? Too little too late. Now we have Biden promising the dictator Raul Castro all kinds of things. Bad news for the US.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
First, the Biden/Harris platform offers me nothing and they can‚Äôt be bothered to seek my vote, so why should I bother? Second, if the corrupt corporate neolibs could offer JUST ONE progressive policy, I‚Äôd be Ok with them.
Biden himself promised to pick a female candidate for VP no matter what. So yes his decision was gender based. Kamala just alllowed Sleepy Joe to check another box
I hope Biden and Harris lose
That‚Äôs how Trump got in there in the first place oh wise one. People were voting against DC. Against the career politician. Not for Trump. All I‚Äôm saying is we need be better than Biden or Trump. Just my opinion. No need to get shitty about it. Not exactly mature.
#Biden #Harris. Let‚Äôs fucking do this!
same here...it's pretty incredible how many previous DEM supporters I know who have either left the DEM party or are just voting RED because they are sick of the liars.  Biden won't be around much longer, certainly not 4 years from now and people despise them both.
We knew Trump would do this. It was only a matter of time, and in this case it was the day after announcing that Kamala was Biden‚Äôs choice for VP. You know he was DYING to cast that disgusting doubt on her fitness for office-he he only totally unfit POTUS ever.
Kamala is 10x more competent than Biden and Trump combined.  I don‚Äôt understand all the animosity towards her as a former prosecutor when the opposition is a whiny man child

And yet Biden clinched the nomination because of the support of Southern Black voters.   He's not without fault.  Not by a longshot.  But he's nowhere near as bad for the country as Trump.
Not just Pelosi.  &amp;  called Boomers "selfish" for voting for Biden.  Also suggested that the black people in SC who helped turn the tide for Biden were "centrists" who were too stupid to know what's good for them.
I absolutely can point to things to defend Biden on but both you and Johnny immediately dismiss them as "him lying about it".  But you do you.
Hopefully, you‚Äôre talking about Trump. I don‚Äôt have to agree with everything Biden stands for to vote for him. But Trump stands for everything I am against. That makes it simple and easy to decide.

AZ Republicans are so angry with Trump they have formed a group to get Trump out. They are voting for Biden and ethics. They should get candidates who believe in ethics for all.

Ooooohh. Revenge is a dish best served cold. Great fantasy. But Hillary would have to recuse herself as AG. With her skill set I think Biden will find a good vehicle for her talents.

Biden, IF you can't express yourself in YOUR OWN WORDs then you are NOT fit to be POTUS!    Any JackA$$ can quote someone else.  It takes a REAL Statesman to put his thoughts in his OWN words!  That is ALL that is believable. GET IT???  When will we hear actual policy!

At first glance I felt disappointed to see leaders/influential figures co-sign Biden/Harris but taking a step back, choosing them means we‚Äôre acknowledging they‚Äôre the ‚Äúbest‚Äù (better) choice, then we keep showing up to hold them accountable to do what WE want from them

Biden's campaign has a generic "save the post office" page that cites no specifics. My guess is they'll save it via private sector integration... maybe replacing mail carriers with gig employees. Something app based. Maybe include the word "blockchain."

Choosing whether to vote for Biden or not is a subjective cost-benefit analysis.   Prioritizing 3rd party votes and sending a message to establishment Dems is valid. Prioritizing beating Trump is also valid.  #NoComradesUnder1k

You've created nothing. Blue States coming out of your cesspools of covid have reopened jobs that your lack of leadership caused to close. Obama &amp; Biden brought us out of a recession &amp; a pandemic that started with 10% unemployment &amp; lowered that to 4.9%. You took us right back.

Oh, look! Dr. Biden is smiling and VP Biden isn‚Äôt even looking at her.
Oh please,  what do you think is going on now?  You have already done the damage and we need Joe Biden to fix it all.
I don't see why we can't acknowledge that Kamala did a lot of bad things and we'd obviously rather it be a different person on the ticket but we also desperately need her and Biden to win
But 71% are voting for Biden?  Sorry. That makes absolutely no sense lol
If this were the only example, one might argue it was how the camera caught his gaze. But it's not the only time. There are dozens of examples.  Imagine the outrage if Trump had been caught doing this just once?  Biden's got so much baggage, he'll sink like the HMS Titanic.

People on the left comment that Biden and centrists need to earn their vote all the time. All. The. Time. I get it.  I get it because I‚Äôm far left and Bernie Sanders never earned my vote, in 2016 or 2020. I‚Äôve identified as a socialist since 2000 and he never earned my vote.
That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre voting for her.  Kavanaugh was a joke, and you old white men rammed him through.  Now pay the price. Biden/Harris!

Does anybody remember the article about women whose husband's voted for Trump who were d/l volunteering for Dem candidates? I can't find a link and don't remember the publication/author. But I actually think that's a lot who Biden/Harris will galvanize.
Even in the midst of everything else Trump is dealing with he‚Äôs running our country fabulously.  Biden on the other hand doesn‚Äôt care about peace in other nations.
I know Trump‚Äôs ego would not allow his attendance at the inauguration, but I have this vision of Trump being led off in handcuffs immediately after Biden &amp; Harris are sworn in.  BTW, I know I have to work hard to ensure that happens.
how is biden a socialist, let alone communist? Biden &amp; Harris are both conservative leaning  I get you‚Äôll miss the trump pump, but the stock market is NOT the economy. u want to get rich while the rest of americans suffer. stop fear mongering. many in wall st are fine with biden
Nope. The recovery will begin Biden/Harris 2020 on November 3rd. Jobs Jobs Jobs. 1million jobs a quarter

I hope Biden &amp; Harris have subpoenas and arrest warrants ready upon their inaugurations.  Thank goodness Biden operates with a team approach.  He‚Äôll need the biggest one for the pandemic, one for the post office, election interference, etc.
My point is. Don't do that shit now. Work towards getting trump out. And when Biden is officially in, crank the criticism and pressure up to fucking 11 and let's make some real change with the next Admin. Trump has shown he wants us mad and disenfranchised, he feeds on it.
Seems they can do just about anything they want unless we stand up to them.  If Biden wins the election we may as well move to China because Kamala will be our President and she has ideas of Dictatorship.  Biden was bad enough but she‚Äôs another AOC. They want to burn us down!
I'd love to tell people to vote Biden/Harris but it gets sandwiched between two tweets that say "BIDEN HAS LOCKED UP EVERY BLACK PERSON IN PRISON TODAY... HARRIS IS A SELF HATING BLAH BLAH BLAH"  I mean keep doing it if you don't care if Trump wins again.

Joe Biden Kamala Harris Donald Trump and Mike Pence can all suck a dick in my opinion, all equally as huge pieces of shit that don‚Äôt deserve a vote
So, a  host #JudgeJeanine issues a new conspiracy theory the Joe Biden won't live to become the next #POTUS? Is the Secret Service going to investigate this threat to the former Vice President of the United States?
The fact that people can see Trump is literally attempting to dismantle our democracy and still want to find reasons to vote against the Biden/Harris ticket is extremely frustrating.
Why is the GOP trying so hard to get me to vote for Biden-Harris when I‚Äôm already doing it?!
By choosing Kamala Harris, Joe Biden has made his agenda to Americans clear: higher taxes, no more will become a thing of the past. We need to get these socialists far away from the White House! #ampFW
you are so wrong!  #Biden and #Obama were lining their pockets and spying on #TheBestPresidentEver45 .  #Obama was the most corrupt president, AND he covered for #Pedowood and #Pedophiles while #TheBestPresidentEver45 is taking them all down.
But not before Biden has repaired Trump‚Äôs destruction of our country.  The remaining Republicans will fight Congress and Biden tooth and nail as they put into place new laws and/or policy. Biden may have to invoke presidential powers for the sake of expedience.
Not gonna lie Settle for Biden is hilarious.
Is he confusing Biden with the zombie Twitter account of Herman Cain?
Yes but I am voting for freedom and NOT going backwards nor voting like other failed countries for socialism. Nor am I allowing myself 2 be used for a vote and then discarded after election like Dems do. What did Obama/Biden do for the blacks...jobs? Look at Dem run states..crime
Okay.   I can‚Äôt tell if folks are upset so they won‚Äôt vote, or if they‚Äôre upset because they think Biden/Harris can‚Äôt win?
I have seen a few attempts to defend him, but most are either "Biden would be worse" (e.g. bc abortion) or insane (I once got into an argument with someone who said he thought Trump was a much more competent manager than Obama, which, um, no.)
The blatant timing and dismembering of the USPS around the upcoming election, Kushner‚Äôs blue state Covid wash-through strategy, his meeting with West to bleed votes from Biden, Barr‚Äôs best Roy Cohn depiction all speak to a nightmare of corruption and malfeasance.
Dont worry we can still burn down every police station after biden and kamala are elected
Pirro‚Äôs subliminal gesture about Biden is not surprising. There‚Äôs an inherent reflexive response to any threat to privilege and power. Not to open old wounds, HC alledged the same thing about Obama, Trump said the same thing about HC, and now his synchopant Pirro about Bidenü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate
Wow, I didn't know we'd moved Harris to the top of the ticket.   I'm ok with that...  Ok with Biden too...
so what‚Äôs the plan ? like honestly i‚Äôm all ears b/c it‚Äôs giving move to a different country . i‚Äôm not gonna pretend i know ALL their history but trump is an actual fucking idiot and is so offensive and disgusting i‚Äôm hearing biden is a creep too so ?? i‚Äôm open minded
He is still an anomaly, and he often says things that give the Left fodder for their anti- Trump fire. But Biden is Obama‚Äôs 8 year globalist protege. Kamala would make any deal that adds to her power..
Do the anti-anti-Trump people out there care that the he is admitting to sabotaging the election or is it somehow on par with when Biden told the Corn Pop story or something?   #bothsides

"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware"
He has been in office 50 years &amp; 8 of those yrs he was VP. He nor Biden did anything 4 our country but let us pay the way. They know nothing about business and it showed. You want 10th graders able 2 vote? Kamala does. High taxes? They do. Take away our sources 2 be independent?
Why are you using your Twitter account to give a huge boost to Biden/Harris this morning?
I am with you Biden and Harris will strip our Military down to the bare bones tax hikes open boarders everything our country doesn‚Äôt need they‚Äôll do it I believe the silent majority is listening and watching and won‚Äôt let those two buffoons near the White House
Perfect. Love it. Biden-Harris all the way!!

I wonder what right wing media will so if Biden gets voted in and then the left immediately starts protesting his dumb ass too
I thought it didn‚Äôt matter whether Joe Biden picked a Black woman. And then it happened.
No need to call people names especially when you know nothing about them except whom they support.  While some innocuous figures who you label "Trump Cultists" are responsible for #Harris outing #Biden as a #segregationist?
Sure. But he could have done that with Biden too. Do we have any proof that every single one of Joe Biden's post-colonial ancestors was born to parents who had been naturalized. Hell, he could do it with Trump.
Predicting right now, whether it‚Äôs Trump or Biden is a wild guess. This pandemic has caused a huge shift in all ways. Tragically, there will be despots who will look to benefit.  Iran looks weak right now, Lebanon is in shambles, apparenting Putin‚Äôs daughter is inoculated?...
He chose not to listen to Rendell and Dodd. He chose to listen to those who suggested Kamala. Hopefully that voice was already inside Biden.
Black Catholics laud Harris pick; others scrutinize past record  #KamalaHarris #BlackCatholics #Biden_HarrisTicket
I do not give a rat's ass, but 4 some reason Dems are denying she is black, when she, herself, said she was black when debating that racist Biden.  I know what the Dem party did &amp; R doing. They R using black people 4 votes 2 win when he twice made racists remarks against blacks.
So you know, Alyssa makes it so us people of sense can only comment on some, but not all posts.  While the #Biden pick makes little sense given #Harris has a lower standing than most blacks with POC and she outed Sen. #Biden as a segregationist, etc.

There is more dirt on Trump and his cronies than her, Obama, the Clintons, and Biden combined....
I‚Äôll bite. It‚Äôs fascist vs. fascist.  But we do it on live stream and all proceeds get to go to   I‚Äôll tell you why if you want progress sometime in this generation, voting for Biden is anathema to it. They‚Äôre already planning to take your choice away in 2024.
Biden‚Äôs cabinet is going to be amazing. I don‚Äôt love Uncle Joe as the Democratic nominee but his cabinet has me feeling things.
That is not the point. In fact Biden is USING her because of her skin color. U think she would have been chosen if she were white? Hell she dropped out of the primaries early because of 2 % voting. She believed Biden over sexual charges from female &amp; Dems quickly covered it up.
Barr may try to arrest  or someone Biden adjacent? Will republicans be okay with this level of election interference? Will media both sides this.  #morningJoe
Unless it‚Äôs ‚Äúmake sure your dissent isn‚Äôt skipped over based on stupid state laws (write ins that don‚Äôt count etc) i don‚Äôt see the point.  After HRC, Trump 2x &amp; Biden, a competent new option isn‚Äôt too much to ask.
You don't know what U are talking about. You watch too much liberal news. Trump put this country in great shape with less unemployment, helped the Latinos &amp; blacks, making our country stronger, got out of bed with China. Biden has been in office 50 years &amp; NOTHING to show 4 it.
I suspect a lot of that is her being a former prosecutor, and him thinking this means Biden will prosecute him, b/c he has no idea how the system actually works and who would actually do the prosecuting.
Does Biden lather you up?
AOC will get to speak 20 seconds less at the DNC than Joe Biden did in the video he made talking about how his dad could drive a car
I am gladly and proudly,  voting for the Biden/Harris ticket. ‚úã
I‚Äôm really not enthused with the Biden/Harris ticket, but I think of things like getting Betsy Devos out and appointing a SC judge that won‚Äôt have the morals of an 18th century priest, and I feel a little better.
Isn‚Äôt that the kind of same thing Biden said before the crime bill was passed? I mean it‚Äôs so super obvious, I don‚Äôt understand why people can‚Äôt see it.
Read this! How Nancy Pelosi will become president if Biden is elected.
Jeanine Pirro said forget making it through four years, Joe Biden isn't even going to make it to November. Immediately, deranged leftist supporters of actual violence (Antifa, BLM, Hamas) claimed what she said was a threat of violence. Cannot make this up.
So you think people who are voting for Biden don't know he carries with him the racism of a 70 year old rich white guy?  Hilarious.  Trump is basically a klan member who forgot his robe at home.  Easy choice

I mean yeah after Biden takes over sometime next year it may dissipate.
The hell it is not about race. They are trying to win back the black votes they have lost due to Biden's racist remarks. Mr. Terrell, a black Civil right's attorney is voting for Trump cos he knows the Dems are using black people &amp; are bad 4 this country. He is a Democrat

Wow - that swing toward Biden when undecideds have to choose is insane. Now we just have to donate, phone bank, and VOTE like we mean it!
Joe and Mika laughed at Trump‚Äôs press conference where he acuses Biden of mental decline and then says all the ‚Äúfatillities‚Äù are among adults. This is REAL organic mental decline. We will all look back and realize our president was mentally ill and demented
She is black. She is Jamaican who migrated from Africa to Jamaica. She admits she is black to Biden in the primaries.
#FACT Oh, the irony of picking racist Biden whose 1994 Crimes Bill put a record number of blacks in prison, and the Attorney General of California Kamala Harris who put more blacks in prison than any other CA attorney general!

Kamala chameleon: the many faces of Biden‚Äôs running mate
If only people knew the real Biden, and what Harris really thinks of him, rather than the almost total media revision.
Come on. Biden has gotten more progressive over the campaign, the party is more progressive than it was a decade ago by far. Kasich is not influencing policy. He is there to reach out to conservatives who still care about our democratic institutions being threatened.
She's just an obvious opportunist, and that will get highlighted.  Her plan, is to try and help Biden get elected, and then as soon as possible push him out on health grounds.

Yes, there was a lot more volatility in 2016 than people remember. And a lot less so far in 20, since Biden was consistently ahead before COVID. That said, a puncher's chance...
Biden was consistently up before COVID, though the pandemic has obviously helped his numbers.
A vote for Biden is a vote for the fundamental transformation of America from a thriving capitalist nation to socialist misery, this time for good. Finishing #ObamaGate job.

I‚Äôm voting for Biden-Harris.
President Trump fights for the working class! He is on our side. Biden fights for the rioters, criminals &amp; mobs. He is on their side, not ours.
In character, not policy, I find Biden to be incredibly humble, kind, caring, and down to earth. The way he treats folks, and the stories people have shared about private encounters with him are fundamentally decent.   There‚Äôs a character test for me. Politics is sticky.
Good cop/bad cop routine so to speak. Biden doesn't like attacking &amp; it's not his strength anyway, so he gets to be the optimist. Kamala is a career prosecutor &amp; is pretty good at playing offense.
I am a Dem for Biden. I get a lot of texts from the Biden campaign asking what issues are most important should he take office. I always say gun control #1 even before Medicare (which I am on)because I think of your daughter Jaime.

A status quo pick of  more of the same or an unmitigated disaster the country may not survive. By not voting for Biden you‚Äôre enabling Trump.

I don‚Äôt think Biden/Harris will repeat same mistakes Clinton made. Now if your view was Bernie or bust, I see your point. But Bernie is now supporting Biden/ Harris. His wise supporters will too. Anyway, good chatting with you. Have a nice eve.
Black voters definitely afraid of Trump, with good reason. He is a White supremacist!  They were afraid Bernie couldn‚Äôt win, rightly or wrongly, so opted for safer choice. But BLM can push Biden just like Civil rights movement pushed LBJ. So hopefully BLM will continue to grow.
OMG he did NOT just say Biden was ignoring scientific evidence hahaha!! Hes doing same thing as before! What ever they  about him he turns it around and says the SAME thing about them lol God he's such a child!
It‚Äôs clear to me Biden knows he‚Äôs not up to the task. Pres.Trump has shown strength and patiently developed a path for this peace agreement and others may follow.The Middle East wants peace.
The issues will go unaddressed if people just elect Biden and go home!  But it takes more than that. Our history demonstrates it.
LBJ signed the civil rights and voting rights acts. Pushed them through the Congress. Nothing in his past suggested he would.  But the movement led by Dr. King forced him to move this country forward. That is the model we need to follow with Biden.
No serious activist can think the movement for racial justice will be advanced re-electing Trump. He considers BLM a hate group and will use power of government to crush it. Biden/ Harris, like LBJ many years ago, can be moved by the mass movement of the American people.
One final point on Kamala, Biden. What they do really will depend on how much pressure is brought to bear by BLM and others who need to vote, and then hold them accountable, stay in the streets, keep mobilizing.  Their past positions aren‚Äôt nearly as relevant as people think.
The minute Biden wins, TLP and others will roll out their "Democrats let this happen!" and "Why aren't Dems fixing things faster?" pro-Republican campaigns for the midterms and 2024. They will have had lots of practice honing their messages and targeting their audiences.

Not American politics - Republican politics. Don‚Äôt both sides this. And yet, you‚Äôre still not sure you‚Äôll vote for Biden knowing damn well that is the same as voting for Trump. You talk out both sides of your face. Just stop pretending.
Biden couldn‚Äôt have done this,by moving US Embassy to Jerusalem &amp; ending Iran deal Trump established a trusting relationship Obama/Biden could never imagine. Itallowed Israel&amp;UAE to enter this agreement &amp;eventual PalestinianState.Splitting Jerusalem would be like east-westBerlin.
OK forgot the fact that she is not black and is pretending to be black. She and Biden are responsible for putting the most black men and women in prison for the past 50 years and she declined to prosecute Steven Mnunchin. Plus don't forget Mitrice Richardson.
Who in their right minds would put Biden in the presidential seat over someone like Bernie Sanders? It's just strange. His faculties aren't even there.
This for any of you dipshits stupid enough to even consider voting for Kanye.   He and Trump are working together to take votes from Biden. Congrats on your vote for Donald Trump

Derwin, I respect you, but I guess my response is, where did the pro-life comment come in? Contextually, that wasn't even mentioned by Biden. #fellowprolifepastor

i feel like this biden stuff is lowkey a plan to keep trump in office .. in one way or another.
Hope  &amp; Biden watch &amp; TAKE actions rather than funnnel billions of dollars into Israel‚Äôs coffers.
We Got a Black Woman on the Ticket. At Last.
Trump Just Tweeted a Video on Biden's 'Racism Problem' That Is BRUTAL
I agree with you but it‚Äôs bigger than that. not voting for him is a vote for Trump and honestly it‚Äôs bigger than presidency, people like Betsy Devos over education need to be out and that can be done by getting Biden in office
All of a sudden, Puny Pence has a voice...scared?  From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I rather have Biden/Harris at the helm than Trump. Not dismissing either one of there discretions, im sure they‚Äôll dig up a ton of dirt on Harris in the weeks to come. Trumps needs to go. This country needs to make a turn around fast.

President Trump does not know what he is talking about. Complete and utter nonsense. Cannot wait to vote him out of office. Biden/Harris 2020
You thought Trump was racist as hell before Kamala got picked to be VP? You just wait...it‚Äôs about to get a whole lot worse! #nastywoman #Biden
I so agree ‚Äòcause the current POTUS is gonna go 5th grade on us and play the dozens, which is too much credit üòì, wherein the VPs won‚Äôt go petty given their moral compasses won‚Äôt tolerate it but hey üòÅ at the moment, I‚Äôm so thrilled about the Biden/Harris possibilities. üá∫üá∏üóΩüá∫üá∏üóΩ

The campaign has begun. I know you wanted an African American VP but the Governor of Michigan might have one you more than one battleground states. Biden, like Obama, takes the safe route so I now feel more confident Trump will win. Ed
My question will Biden make it to Election Day? If not what happens next? Ed
how this Biden/Harris combo got me feelin
it's okay to acknowledge that the biden/harris ticket is better than the opposition. it's also okay to call the biden/harris ticket terrible due to the merits of the two candidates. and it still okay to vote for a less violent cop than the more violent and racist one.

Just donated $55 to the  for VP campaign.  I was always going to vote for Biden, but I‚Äôll be voting for the Biden-Harris ticket with joy. Let‚Äôs do this election!
President Trump rips Biden VP pick Kamala Harris
Well I tbink it was more the entire congress and city communities who pushed the bill. Biden‚Äôs name was just at the top. At the time it was a hugely popular idea none of us have really lived through 300 homicides a month being normal.
It‚Äôs the legislators we need to focus on to push a progressive agenda. If the laws we want are there, people like Biden and Harris will enforce those laws. But without those laws, there isn‚Äôt much they can do to push to the left.
Kamala Harris Is Biden‚Äôs Choice for Vice President
And I suppose the most radical BLM protesters in the street were not gonna vote anyway. Biden hoping to peel off moderate GOP soccer moms in Pa., Indiana, NC, Michigan, Wisconsin.
I don‚Äôt see why reporters feel the need to repeat Trumps non sensical talking points.  Biden/Harris vision of a diverse, inclusive America is diametrically opposes to Trump/Pence vision of white supremacy.  That is the main point to be made.
Y'all not going to sit here and act like Biden and Harris are the same as Trump and Pence. Do not allow your "wokeness" to reach new heights.
Really looking forward to people not liking Biden but only attacking Kamala Harris. You guys are the real MVP's.  Misogynistic Vicious  Patriarchy humpers  #BidenHarris2020
I‚Äôm gonna vote for Biden but i wish he just wouldn‚Äôt talk because i feel like everytime he opens his mouth he says something dumb

Watch SE Cupp's reaction to Biden's VP pick
I mean everyone is entitled to have their own opinion or views about the election candidates. But, I strongly think that Condoleezza Rice would have been the perfect candidate as the vice president. I really think Mr. Biden should have chosen Mrs. Rice. No other words. ü§êüò∑
I really don‚Äôt know how someone supporting Donald Trump, who retweets ‚Äúwhite power,‚Äù lied about Obama‚Äôs birth, defends confederate memorials, and is basically the candidate of white supremacy could criticize anything Joe Biden has said on race. You live in a different world.
Bringing the popcorn. Wish she could stand in for Biden during his debate too!
Same!! Am surprised at how I feel. Biden-Harris is a power team!
Perfect pick. The men who were raised by strong Black women are ready to work with you. We are one! Biden-Harris
You were my choice!  However now that VP Biden has made his choice I would love to see you Secretary of Department of State.

As usual Biden chose what he thought was the safe path, but that means he‚Äôs weak and our adversaries will take advantage of it. Ed
Well Biden is not exactly equivalent to our Pope. Ed
At this point I just don't care. If I remember to go to the polls in November, I'll vote for Biden I guess
If Biden wins the Marxists will take over.Neither Biden or Harris are strong, but they like each other. If the Marxists take over first thing is to erase history. So libraries better start now distributing all books,species DNA now electronic around the world hidden from them.

Do Trump supporters really want to talk about Biden‚Äôs cognitive abilities when Trump is an absolute imbecile?
But we already got a man with neurological issues in the white house. At least Biden on a good day is 100% better than Trump.
My wife said, "James, Joe Biden is going to select a Black woman. What if all of the vetting of the candidates is a smoke screen for someone he's already selected for the position:  MICHELLE OBAMA?"  Don't think that's the case, but . . . what if . . .
Exactly. I will not be happy if Biden doesn‚Äôt pick Senator Harris. Pissed in fact. But I‚Äôm voting for Biden because Trump needs to go.
Obama/Biden $80B green energy plan was a complete failure. Obama was a good talker but didn‚Äôt know how to follow through. Trump knows how to get things done. Ed
I'm a politically active black woman in a majority minority CD, volunteer on Biden campaign. Most of the volunteers are black women. I just don't hear this. Most want Biden to pick someone who will help him win. If a black woman, it's a plus not a necessity

The Michigan poll seems off. If it's that close, not good news for Biden
Do U know how out of touch this sounds?  Black &amp; brown communities are being decimated by COVID &amp; its effects, e.g.15% unemployment. We're not looking to be excited by VP pick. We're not excited by Biden. We're voting for him anyway. For VP just do no harm
This year, Dems don't care about gaffes or enthusiasm. I'm a 68 yr old live long Dem. I'm not enthusiastic about Biden but Im volunteering for his campaign, I've donated money, and I will crawl over glass to vote for him. Everyone I know feels the same way.
The President is on the offensive, so don‚Äôt be surprised he rolls over Biden in the general election. I talk to people, most aren‚Äôt talking and likely scared. But in ballot will vote for a law and order America, a strong economy and a strong National Defense. Ed
I just volunteered for Biden campaign to make calls. Also signed up with Swing Left to help take bake the senate!! Let‚Äôs do this!!! ‚úä
Depends:  Biden wins: THANK GOD!! Respectability will be restored  Trump wins: Da f*ck??? That sob, mfer? ETC, ETC, ETC.
Okay, so she doesn‚Äôt like him, but unlike the other guys he knows how to get things done, people who stayed in stock market made a lot of money last month, and he‚Äôs one of the few President‚Äôs who knows how to run an economy. Biden gets confused when talking about numbers. Ed
A dozen women, mainly national activists, may not be representative of rank &amp; file blk women Dem voters. I'm a local activist, a black woman, a senior in maj/minority district. I want Biden to pick a black woman but most I know not demanding it.
The same people who think Republicans will come back to the table to cooperate with a Biden administration
U mean u want her to fo the opposite of what u are doin now? She Has, and she is doing nothing different than Biden. Misogynistic anytime
So what did your Obama/Biden administration do about it? Ed
Biden has already kneeled to the mob. Ed
Indeed but it‚Äôs just funny coming from the side that screams voter fraud when unless an election was within 10 votes it wouldn‚Äôt matter. Biden‚Äôs gonna win the pop vote trump prolly the electoral. Everyone just needa shut up.
I hope Biden/Trump get bit by one of these things
Where‚Äôs the intelligence for this? I‚Äôd think they would prefer a weak President like Biden so they could be more aggressive in Ukraine etc. Don‚Äôt forget Trump is the one who provided anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, while Obama/Biden were afraid to do so! Ed
Joe Biden cannot do math. Ed
In other words, "Pick me, pick me Mr. Biden sir, I want to be v.p."
In 3.5 years with all the democrats trying to stop President Trump achieved more than the 8 years of the Obama/Biden Presidency. Furthermore, Trump is the most prolife President we‚Äôve ever had while Obama/Biden were part of the culture of death St John Paul II talked about. Ed
You know, I didn‚Äôt wanna vote for Biden. But it ain‚Äôt gon be trump so  Basically what I‚Äôm saying is..  #Biden2020
I mean, I guess Biden is extra worried about dying in office (or at least people being worried he‚Äôll die in office), but like... that‚Äôs why you build a complete team of advisors!!!
My understanding is she was more or less knocked out because ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have enough foreign policy experience,‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs nearly the gotcha Biden seems to think it is
I genuinely can‚Äôt fathom why Stacey Abrams isn‚Äôt being named as one of Biden‚Äôs VP finalists, especially in a year when Georgia is possibly in play and has TWO competitive Senate elections.
obama and biden did it? has the right wing nutbag press gotten wind of this? next biden secret gay lover of obama. i can hear rush windbag chortling now
They will do literally anything to retain power. As Rachel said, we all better buckle up. I hope Biden and Democratic Party are ready.

He's running an amazing #DnD campaign. I guess that Biden is headed to the Outer Planes
But if what you want is "NOT TRUMP" and you vote for Justin Amash, you weaken the chances of getting someone who is not Trump because Amash doesn't have the size of base that the GOP and DNC have.  If you want NOT BIDEN and you vote for WTF the Green candidate is... same thing
It depends on what your preferences generally are.  I don't think you'll find many people who are genuinely in the camp of Trump=Biden.  I think that you'd struggle to find anyone who can look at facts and come to that conclusion
