Soon as one of his 'failing' publications says something positive about him... He quotes them  .. For trump everything printed must be about how great he is. Same goes for his cult members.
Who ever said Trump had to actually be 1st ~ to report that he was~  ? Probably the same people, who said ‚ÄúWhen in court asking a Judge to find a particular thing unconstitutional, you shouldn‚Äôt put that thing into your new plans.‚Äù Makes passing a cognitive test, a bit doubtful!

No, that's not what trump means! He's specifically divisive... every speech of his is based on 'us and them'  His MAGA is where America consists of only those Who love and praise him.
Tgat's because trump-stooge barr fixed it for trump by changing mueller findings saying trump was exonerated when mueller report clearly stated that he was not. Mueller wrote barr to protest.  But what the hell ..trumplings dont care if he's a traitor.
Well you don't ride in a plane either, you must have the same doctor as Trump.
And the stupid trump supporters eat it up.
Ooops not Clinton...... trump and family are  banned from running any future charities after looting the ones they were running.
Don't blame Trump. Falwell Jr. was probably doing this stuff years ago, before 2016. He just now got caught.
You also presumably love trump too.. Got a thing for criminals, traitors ??
Barr has so far let flynn, stone, trump and himself escape justice.
You noticed.. only repubs get indicted. (Most of them close associates of trump) Wonder why that would be??
Barr is too busy letting trump friends out of prison to worry about all that law and order stuff.. just an occasional handshake to make it look like he gives a dam. Punish traitors?? Come now, is he likely to indict himself and trump?
are the trump people just ignoring the fact that donald trump has called ghislaine maxwell a fine woman and has wished her well multiple times or does that just not fit their narrative

Let me get this right, Washington stood by while things happened, I take that to include Trump!
Your kidding, right?  Trump was signing Bibles .... as in writing his name in them?  I haven‚Äôt heard anything about that, please share!

Make no mistake I am not a blind Trump supporter, I just think that he is better than Old Joe. I wish the Democrats would promote someone worth my vote.
Only if Trump wins again. If Biden wins, we will probably start losing double the current number because no one can do as good a job as Trump in protecting the American people.
And your 'research' items always turn out to be some form of conspiracy theory junk or twisted versions of events. Prefer to seek my own sources and simply watch trump stumbling along.

If Dems see Biden not be able to complete a sentence in a debate it could definitely change some people's minds and influence the election . I still hold out some hope that some Dems may  have common sense. But after watching their behavior since the night Trump  won maybe not.
So Biden has told the truth his whole 40 plus years in politics?? The whole previous administration is the most corrupt to ever hold office. So stop with the lying digs at Trump. Their has never not been debates for presidential elections. Why should Biden get a pass.

I also recommend that Biden refuse to engage with Trump at all until he releases his tax returns.
I recommend that we cancel presidential debates this year.  Why should Trump be given another forum in which to lie.  I say hold individual sessions where each candidate is asked the same questions.

Cool! Two Inaugurations! We'll be having twice the fun, 'cause two is better than one! One question, though...what's Trump being inaugurated as? I'll be at the Biden one, where Chief Justice Roberts swears in Joseph as our new prezie, but I might make it to both, if I can.
Trump has--&amp; has never had -- any intention of debating. That's what all the posturing is about now.
TRUMP RALLIES ...YOU FORGOT ....AND YES HE SHOULD PUT THEM IN CAGES   HE DOES WITH CHILDREN ON THE BORDER !
For Trump -- name all your kids. Sure he'd miss Tiffany/Barron.
Now Trump needs to endorse American first candidates like Lauren. We need to take this country back!!
I read the article and nowhere is a quote from Trump saying this. So Chris (or as Biden calls him, Chuck) is passing an opinion as fact.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA üòÇ "radical leftist". Why? Cause he's black? You know as well as we do that Trump is blackmailing Lindsey. For whatever reason, it's enough to vote him out. Get a grip, Karen. üôÑ
I think NY going after the corrupt NRA is a good thing. I am concerned with the timing.  A lot of people will see this as a second amendment issue and not about their corruption. Trump campaign will hammer this and unfortunately most people don‚Äôt look deeper than the headlines.
Hello Trump????
I agree with what you are doing. I am only concerned,by doing this now, it will only help trump and his re-election. The majority of people will look at this as a second amendment rights issue and not see it for what it really is about. The RNC will run with this and distort it
Hey linds any thoughts on trump saying your former friend wants to ‚Äúhurt the Bible‚Äù whatever the fuck that means. And that he wants to ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù ?  I mean if Biden is powerful enough to hurt God he should be president
So it was OK the past few years? Nothing to do with trump being butt hurt about them destroying him on there?
Of course!  Stoked by TRUMP!  He personifies CHAOS!
you‚Äôre playing right into Trump‚Äôs strengths. Big money bribes, double crosses, and twisting any deal into a symbolic loyalty pledge is the oxygen he breathes‚Äîthe art of the deal‚Äîtake the money and destroy publicly your enemies.
Yes we know, you all want 4 more years of trump, we get it.
Could Trump bring attention to something less important? Perhaps he has a health plan? Covid plan? You know stuff that we need and should be addressed...
Kynan Bridges' SHOCKING Dream About President Trump (Must Watch!)  via    This is what I listened to yesterday.  Brings more insight for me what is going on now.
Of course we don‚Äôt punish them just for having opinions. But we‚Äôll pass a law that that says anyone who supports Trump or Barr was guilty of crimes against humanity. Our new judges will rubber stamp it. And bye bye!

does Trump have a health plan yet? Promised years ago. Did he ever show his taxes? Promised years ago. Does he have a covid plan? Promised months ago. Has he purged the swamp? Promised years ago. Has he cleaned our cities? Promised years ago. MAGA? Countries laugh!
Dude that pretty much sums up Trump's life, just sub cocaine and Adderall for booze, ahhh but little Johnny already knew that too, and stuck his head in the sand, but it didn't smell like sand did it little Trumpkin?
The truth is that President Trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic‚Äîit's obvious he still hasn‚Äôt learned his lesson. He continues to ignore the warnings of health experts and we're all paying the price.

Once again, Moscow Mitch McConnell, Trump and a lot of other allies and supporters of Trump are proving how greedy and selfish they are when they only care about themselves and only lookout for their best interest.
Again, it is about time someone stood up to the NRA because the NRA is a corputed organization that claims to be a "non profit organization" when that is a lie because they spend their money on themselves, donate to "charitable political events" and to Trump.
ok sweetheart if you say so!!!  in that case you should be replacing Trump with a better president not the one with dementia it wont do you any good !!!  7 figures my ass and i am kayne west

I see Biden‚Äôs gaffe / regurgitation of wrong received wisdom on African Americans was immediately overshadowed (in my bubble) by Trump claiming Biden would hurt God.

If you took both Presidential nominee‚Äôs personality out of the picture and people voted on policy and ideology only , Trump wins in landslide. Most voters do not want a welfare state, dismantling of 2A, riots in the street, wars, regime change or all our jobs going to China.

The reason Wall Street continues to set records some 85 days from the election is because they ALREADY KNOW Trump will win.  The market is a very accurate forward looking indicator with some of the smartest people in the US.  A Biden win would crater the market.
One issue voters is what got us the sinner Trump. If Republicans were serious about abortion they might have done something to support the women that were contemplating one but they just don‚Äôt care about fixing things just votes.

According to at least 25% of people polled, they believe the Sacred Service is who protects Trump already.
Most of us know that VP Biden is a life long, devout Roman Catholic. And if you didn't know it before his son's tragic death, you know it now. This was possibly one of the most despicable things Trump has said yet. He should seek God's forgiveness.
When Biden said the line about if an African American votes for Trump ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù, it wasn‚Äôt a random weird set of words. He really thinks that.
Oh, ho!
Except when it's China since trump prefers to buy Chinese, right?
We really stuck between biden and trump to cap off 2020.
Thank you I was just going to say this very thing.   Trump as we all know is high at looneyville today.
Thighland? Ah, that's where we got Trump's favorite quote "Don't fire until you see the whites of their thighs."
I didn't even have to click "Thighland" to know that it must have been something Trump actually said.
Before Trump changed the law, a donation was actually tax deductible, so I assume the language has just carried over from those years pre-Trump.

Let Trump win the toss up states here, who cares.  Biden still gets the electoral college win easy
Great example of white grievance crowd that is the Trump crime syndicate's base still having a hard time grasping reality that their guy won in 2016. Guess the thinking is he's made impotent/ineffective by the Deep State and is not owning the libs?
Oh so you would rather have 4 more years of crooked Trump?? Trump lies and doesn‚Äôt give a damn about anyone but himself and the rich so don‚Äôt fool yourself! Biden is for everyone and that‚Äôs where my vote is going and I hope and pray everyone else‚Äôs is too!
I didn‚Äôt make up shit, Putin put 100k bounties on American soldiers heads and Trump just disregarded it. Also this and more.     Im done discussing this tho
You don't "have to" do anything, but if a third party candidate wins, I'll eat my hat, so in effect it's giving Trump a better chance to win.
All of those also describe 45. I‚Äôm not a big Biden guy, I agree he‚Äôs creepy, but he‚Äôs got a much more level head. Also he is about as right as a democrat can be, and he actually cares about common people. Trump does not give a fuck unless you‚Äôre rich, and that is not arguable
The Trump Foundation is back in the news ‚Äì and Donald Trump is going to hate it  via
That would require logical thinking.  Trump supporters don't have that.  It ends with 'biden or God', thats the choice they hear.
Trump‚Äôs push to reopen schools and colleges is going to backfire spectacularly and cost him any chance of winning re-election.   Unfortunately, it‚Äôs also going to get a lot of people killed. I weep when I think about the totally unnecessary price we‚Äôre about to pay.
Bashing Trump is a perfectly good reason for voting for Biden tho. What you‚Äôre saying is ‚ÄúWould you rather get punched in the arm or punched in the dick? If the arm, explain to me why without mentioning the dick‚Äù ... the reason I‚Äôm choosing the arm is because the dick is worse

Ohio Gov. DeWine tests positive for coronavirus ahead of Trump's visit

If I were DeWine, I would fake it to distance myself from Trump.
Did he really, or did he just want to get out of being near Trump, so he just said he was positive?
If trump had conviction in his beliefs, he would give the gov a big bear hug
Not a trump fan, looking at your page tells a different story. Btw you have stock don‚Äôt you?
I can‚Äôt get over the fact that Dems hate Trump so much but the best they could come up with to defeat him was Joe Biden. He‚Äôs SO BAD, like parody bad, that it feels like Dem establishment secretly want four more years of Trump to complain about.
You mean the very same way Trump and the NRA don't care what you think either? They're just happy to steal your political donations and membership money, and you seem fine with them doing it. So there's that.
I see this groundswell of social change/reform sometimes on Twitter. #BlackLivesMatter, the NRA and Deutsche Bank being looked into, Trump on the run and fading in the polls. Voting rights being discussed and young people looking to make changes. Again, it gives me some hope...
Trump's censored statement seems roughly accurate.    Kids are not immune. That's why he said "almost".  CDC data: 45 kids under 15 died of COVID. Compares to 13,133 who died of other causes in same period:   Censorship could lead to needless school closure
2 word meaningless slogans, these could mean anything. Trump is a snake oil salesmen and you conveniently filled in the gaps for him. Trump supporters live the propaganda, but couldn't tell you shit about policy.
Trump won't be removed .... Lol
I waited in line for 2 hours to vote for Obama. I hate Trump at least 4 times more than I love Obama.

I'm afraid since tens of millions of ballots are being sent out &amp; Trump and the Republicans are allowing this to happen... we have already lost. America will be destroyed - I never thought this possible.
Sending tens of millions ballots across the country will guarantee the death of America. The election will be stolen at this point. Why isn't Trump and the Republicans putting an end to this?
Honest question, do you think Trump has had a flawless presidency so far?
If Biden refuses to debate Trump, Trump should debate Jorgensen. This would benefit both Trump &amp; Jorgensen. It would show the anti-Trump crowd that they don't need to vote 4 Biden, thus splitting their votes &amp; helping Trump. The real loser would be Biden.

These are also, 2 idiots that Trump (who is also, a idiot) hired who have absolutely no clue and no idea on what they are talking about.
Delaware and Yes TRUMP , And unfortunately we are a blue state!
That‚Äôs too bad because Israel loves Trump.
As far as I am concerned about our foreign relations with Russia, Syria and Turkey, is that I don't trust Trump, Valdmire Putin, Bashan Al - Asad and Tayyip Erdogan.
Trump had US ambassador press UK for golf deal: former diplomat  via
Trump is around 45% approval give or take which is well within the statistical margin of error in today's survey methods.  Because most surveys that are conducted today are done through social media which is heavily skewed leftist progressive.
As far as our foreign relations with China are concerned, is that I don't trust both Trump and Xi Jinping.
Ya wanna know how I know there's no deep state agenda against Trump? Well, originally, he won. But he is also unbelievably pompous, and ignorant, that it would have already succeeded in whatever it was set out to do.
As a Democrat, I welcome any Republician who is willing to vote Trump out and support Former Vice President Joe Biden.
Hopefully we‚Äôre tweeting about trump in Rikers island, this time tomorrow.
But, I don't think it will help Trump at all in November during the election because he already dug himself in a hole that he most likely won't get out of.
Facebook and Twitter have taken action against Donald Trump over a video in which he claims children are 'almost immune' to #coronavirus.  Both social networks say the clip contained 'misinformation'.
Once again, Trump has absolutely no clue and no idea about what he is talking about (especially, about the reality and the truth about the ongoing Coronavirus and the COVID 19 disease pandemic).
He sounded intelligent, with the ability to comprehend the English language. He sounded like he had the bare minimum grasp on reality. Trump sounded like a third grader, high on mescaline, reading Clifford.
‚ÄúIt has become the norm for US officials to quietly correct the thicket of mistakes and lies embedded in Trump‚Äôs daily discourse.‚Äù
You‚Äôre going to wish you never supported trump in a few days....   Duetch Bank 8-5-2020 Wednesday, gave the state AG of NY trumps bank records.  Here we go!  It‚Äôll prove  You‚Äôre a traitor for trump!
Exactly.   Also he lies about a virus that can get Americans killed.   Twitter isn‚Äôt allowing it.  Why?  They‚Äôre protecting the American people. That‚Äôs a true patriot.   Twitter is more credible than trump.  That‚Äôs sad! He is Done and he knows it.
Trump is giving false information about a virus that kills people.   Are you really this brainwashed, lady?
It‚Äôs not censorship!    Trump giving false information about this virus gets people killed.   It‚Äôs holding the president credible.   It matters, they should be given an award for saving lives!   They‚Äôre patriotic when it comes to Americans safety. Crazy we dot have a pres who is!
Is Trump responsible for the overwhelmingly high number of black men being shot every day and night cities with democratic leaders?
That was just her Trump Derangement Syndrome.
Ok well each governor was in control of their state. With that logic, governor Cuomo wins with over 34,000 dead. And how did Trump neglect any of these things
Not enough. $ crimes Trump sex. Sex is a misdemeanor in MAGAt language. F~‚Ç¨k w/$ go to jail, directly to jail.
#LincolnVoter I used to consider myself a fiscal conservative and social liberal.  Since W, it‚Äôs clear that the R‚Äôs are no longer fiscally conservative and too entwined with the religious right on social issues.  Trump is just an embarrassment on every level.
Exactly!  He‚Äôs in trouble   BREAKING NEWS: State Of NY has his back records from Duetch Bank! 8-5-20  Trump is so fuckt!
Gaslighting someone is the ultimate fvck you &amp; arrogant to assume that if you don't vote, it's a vote for Trump. If not voting is a vote for Trump, then not voting is also a vote for Biden. Why is it exclusively a vote for Trump? Not voting is a vote for Biden, just as easily.

Because he‚Äôs the main player.   That‚Äôs what these pedophiles do, point the finger at someone for what they‚Äôre guilty of.   Epstien/Maxwell sex trafficking-pedophile case - one name keeps popping up, over and over, trump! Trumps name, like the Russian probe, trumps name pops up!
Russian Probe: investigation into Russia hacking our election, trump&amp;his men names kept popping up all over the place in that investigation.   Epstien/Maxwell-  Sex trafficking-pedophile case, again, trumps name keeps popping up all throughout the probe, trump, trump! Guilty Fact

To arrest tRump? Great idea, Matt!!
Why doubtful? Trump ran to drain the swamp. He didn‚Äôt want compensation. He‚Äôs not your typical politician. He shouldn‚Äôt be judged by how decades of corrupt and feckless politicians behaves. Trump won‚Äôt stop until Crooked &amp; Obummer are in jail!
Obviously Trump is showboating in front of the cameras, pretending to love America. His smile is so fake.
Trump family crime in Gotham City.

If anyone you know says they are actually going to vote for Kanye West, for the love of our country convince them not to.  Voting for someone who actually isn‚Äôt in it to win it is not funny and it‚Äôs not a joke.  A vote for Kanye is a vote for Trump.

That's a very scary thing. If and I do mean "IF" by some quirk you do win, BOTH OF YOU WILL DESTROY AMERICA - by selling out giving China, Iraq and other countries. Biden &amp; Obama decrease our military. Selling our jobs to China &amp; more to make USA a 3rd world country.
Just as an FYI about Sleepy Creepy Joe ...around his town of Centerville, Delaware he is known as DeadBeat Joe.  The family is NOTORIOUS for not paying their bills.  Most local businesses will only accept cash from them.  Deadbeat Joe Biden.

I do not lie. I started in politics in 1960 as a Democrat. Check Kamala Harris' voting record. How far left can she go? Anti-freedom! Pro-Antifa, bail them out! BLM has raised $billion. Where does it go? You heard her support them? Biden has been co-opted by the FAR LEFT!
Umm..I believe Plan A, B and C is to get behind Biden and Harris, even though progressives don't agree with them, and get Trump out of office.
Then why lie about Biden and suck up to trump?  You need serious mental help!
Biden all the way. trump= failure=death!  For the love of God, open your eyes, trump has brought this great country to its knees.  Trump is nothing but bigly failure!
When is the last time Biden answered a question from the press?
A major plank in his platform is that his rich donors will not suffer under the Biden administration.
They did you a favor. Biden adding Harris to the ticket assured Biden can't win. Someone needs to check him out for Alzheimer's and dementia. No way if he won, that he could hold the position for even a year. DNC should be ashamed for parading this man around the country.
Keep up the good fight. The Dems should be ashamed of themselves. Advice sir, stay out of the mask conflict. Many millions of your supporters believe the masks can help to slow the pandemic. Biden choosing Kamala Harris as his VP running mate is horrible. Less is more. Good luck!
"We are fighting liberalism, except now it has unabashedly and proudly opened up to full Marxism and communism. No matter the phony moderate record of team Biden, the fact is, the Democrat Party is now home to the domestic equivalent of the old Soviet Union." - -- Rush Limbaugh
Biden on Harris: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a big week for us. I‚Äôm very proud that Sen. Kamala Harris is at my side now. She‚Äôs a proven fighter. She knows how to govern and how to make some tough calls. She‚Äôs ready to do the job. And we‚Äôre both ready to get to work rebuilding the country.‚Äù
Kamala Harris, in her first interview as Joe Biden‚Äôs runningmate:
Of course no amount of money can replace the loved ones lost because you believed China and Joe Biden said you could not trust them and should have Americans on the ground to see what really was going on. But you didnt want to ruin your GREAT TRADE DEAL or Ivanka's patents.....
My colleagues    &amp;  are completely right about  plan to lift up our nation‚Äôs Black farmers and give them the support they desperately need.

Biden will end fracking. This will put up to ten million people out of work. Double gasoline prices &amp; natural gas prices. It will end America as an Energy Independent Country and an energy exporter. It will cause a recession. His other programs will hurt Americans just as bad!
Biden voters are fools.
You make no sense to me. Biden will destroy the freedoms that so many Marines died for. I think you are a liar!

Is critical thinking a strong point for Biden/Harris supporters? Most people miss it - Harris‚Äô father‚Äôs ancestral pride. It isn‚Äôt different from Southern pride in Dixie heritage. Certainly, neither advocate slavery and neither are culpable for it.

Wow. Biden managed to pick a running mate who is wrong about LITERALLY EVERYTHING. And yes...she is a totalitarian Communist.
You know what instead of debates how about twice a week we have Biden and Trump just cut WWE style promos. Just unedited, unscripted, no-holds-barred promos. Profanity and all. Trump on MNR and Biden on SDL.. no one gives a fuck about policies anyways. Make it entertaining.

Joe Biden has rolled Fox twice in a week.  First they show parts of his ad driving a corvette, then they show him riding a bike in Rehoboth.  Those essentially undo millions spent by Trump trying to show how feeble Joe Biden is.  Meanwhile Trump explains his walk down a ramp...
The only reason they want to scrap the debates is biden don't have a chancebecause he's a idiot.
Biden will jack up your taxes!
You forgot to mention that the Obama/Biden recovery was due to REPUBLICANS crashing the economy.
If we go back to 1972 when Joe Biden ran against Caleb Boggs for US Senate ‚Äî the answer is still ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. I never considered voting for Biden.
Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúdementia‚Äù doesn‚Äôt much matter because, if elected, he will resign for health reasons after being sworn in, else the Democrats will sorrowfully and prayerfully remove him through the 25th Anendment. I expect the identity of his VP choice will confirm that‚Äôs the plan.
Trump is a problem but only a fool would think Biden is the answer.
I say too little, too late. He hasn't changed...he just says more things, more often now. Joe Biden is racist!
I have been thinking Biden is only a puppet for months now. There is definitely someone in the shadows on the left who will be pulling the strings for Biden if he is elected and people can take that to the bank cause Biden isn't able mentally able. God help us is he wins. #KAG
After 3-1/2 years of a coup based on phony Russia Collusion claims, who blames Russia for hostility to the Democrats and Biden? As long as they don‚Äôt try to influence our elections more than we do theirs and other countries‚Äô elections, it‚Äôs ok. Ditto, China‚Äôs support for Biden.
I completely agree with you. There is no way I would consider voting for Biden. I don't believe that the man could hold the position for a year even if he somehow wins. Him getting the democratic nomination shows how weak the democrats are currently.
This video shows a fit and toned person who resembles Biden. Are body doubles common political practice?
Not a single person voting for Biden.
Biden can't win fair and square so he's resorting to scaring people into voting for him. Your SS is safe. Stop listening to lying Democrats.
Joe Biden is SO racist. In 2008 he said "you can't go to a 7-11 store or a Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent". He's an embarrassment!
Give Joe Biden credit. He apologized to the black community for saying that all blacks think alike. And he no longer opposes busing to achieve school desegregation. And it‚Äôs been several years since he eulogized any segregationist at his funeral. The new Joe is greatly changed.
Bill biden isn't picking any one  pelosi and. the dnc are doing the picking.

Biden wouldn't be my choice.. Would like to see a younger man/woman in the running.. But  he is still  so much better equipped than trump to do the job. Trump is just so infantile and sensitive.. can't handle the heat.
Interesting. Russia wants Donny to win. China wants Biden to win. Either way somebody is going to claim it‚Äôs a rigged election‚Ä¶  ugh.  #failure

Anybody helmet shaming Biden for not wearing a helmet on a MUP that goes between the cape henlopen park and the rehoeboth boardwalk is catching a block.
Joe Biden figured any reporter who asks him anything other than a cream puff question must be a Trump supporter. And as Joe always says, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre for Trump, you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù So I figure Joe just couldn‚Äôt tell the reporter was black.
If we let Biden win?  Rand Paul is just one more R Senator manipulated by the Russians. Put another way he‚Äôs a useful idiot. Or more succinctly an idiot.

Here's Biden talking about his Crime Bill:
Harris is an opportunistic, nasty woman. She accused Biden of racism and said she believes the women who accused Biden of sexual assault. Despite these FACTS she decided to accept the VP position just for the power. She will sell any American down the river for more power.
The way I see it, and again, I'm far left here, Trump is a symptom of America, and Biden is an architect of the system that elected and supports him.   Biden will solve nothing.    Also, Black Lives Matter began while Biden was VP.  Just a point that gets lost.
So, I was never going to vote for Biden.  Adding a cop as his VP definitely will make me not vote for him harder. üòÇ
I'm a leftist, meaning I support social programs, universal healthcare, environmentalism, etc. Both Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris have spent their careers locking people up for things like marijuana use. Add Biden's war mongering &amp; sexual aggressiveness to that- Trump, but effective.
You really can't. We've played this game before. We are ignoring the problem while only post pining the inevitable gop fascist take over, and telling us voting biden will stop it is laughable as biden spent his whole career siding with the Republicans.
this is the dumbest take. trump literally has no policy, he uses the GOP platform that still says they need to get obama out of office. biden has extensive and detailed policies. google would tell you this
SORRY, fracking would continue under Biden. Just no new permits. STOP THE LIES!!
Biden and Harrris May need to cut the meat of the Republicans since they a bunch of cry babies! #BidenHarris2020
Honestly I dislike Trump and Biden it really feels like another repeat of Hillary versus Trump both choices are terrible
Kinda like our H1N1 outbreak? Yeah... an estimated 150, 000 to 575,000 people died so tell me again how great Biden did üôÑ
Hillary will be helpful to Kamal-toe when Biden commits suicide.
And another ones bites the dust.  Blocked after months of mufo-ship, with no answer about Joe Biden's policy issues.   Uh huh. üòÇüòÇ
Biden called Trump a xenophobe for banning Chinese nationals. üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ

Deport Biden to deep space!
Never mind the racist shit Biden says.
Umm, Ridin with Biden will definitely be bought and worn ironically for SURE
Won‚Äôt matter. Joe Biden will be President regardless of where he is. But I would like Trump and company out of my house.
Joe Biden the White Obama a true dictator.  (wherethenewsis com)
No he doesn't. Biden does not want to take anyone's guns.  How did your daddy feel after today's press conference, Junior? A little rattled?  Tell him that millions of us are still waiting on him to answer that question.
Biden confirmed Zionist on multiple occasions. While trump actually offered. Foreign media runs on a different filter. Seek the truth
When is the televised Trump - Biden debate?  We the people need to be informed.
You need to get ready for 4 more years of #TrumpDerangementSyndrome because dementia riddled Biden and totally unqualified, unimportant and irrelevant Harris will NEVER be elected! Dems LOSE! #Trump2020LandslideVictory

Goddammit.  Middle America hates the clintons so much trump is president. Please stay far away from this. Biden is barely above a wet paper towel holding its max weight in washed grapes, and Clinton could be the grape that makes it give out.

I'm sorry, FUCKING WHAT?  Biden isn't the President, and he won't be officially until January.  I don't know if you accidentally put "Biden" instead of "Trump" or if that was a legit Freudian slip. Either way, Trump has been in charge, so it's HIS failure.
Biden‚Äôs choice for VP, is Sketchy at the least. Harris was dating Biden‚Äôs son and spent a lot of time with Biden in his home. It‚Äôs awful funny he‚Äôd pick her for this position. Skeptic are wondering if she has some dirt on him or what is she dating him and his son. Time will tell
Woooowwww. The projection with this is just on another level. Or did we already have the election and Biden is president? Seriously can the gop be this stupid? How is that possible?
Talking about Biden during a press conference? That's not a press conference, that's a campaign rally. Is there no line this president won't cross?

Everyone watch Kanye and miss the USPS vanishing. If Kanye was a Dem, the Republicans would have him in jail and testifying with Hunter Biden. I'm 110% in for Joe, but dammit, the Dems are coordinating on stupid.
Let us see your work,  you have not done your homework.
Remember. If you aren‚Äôt voting for Biden, then you ain‚Äôt black!! That doesn‚Äôt all imply that Democrats are using the black community for votes.

Obama/Biden economy was the worst since Jimmy Carter.  The REAL TRUTH is Trump inherited a total mess and got things cleaned up in light speed!  Kamala please stop the lying.  We all know the truth and it not going to work!

Also a weird metaphor when you consider Biden's association with trains.  Dunno, this seems very 5 year old boy in playground-esque.
Well now lets take a look at our future under Biden! No police, no jobs, more taxes which means a lower standard of living for all Americans, open boarders means a higher standard of living for non-americans who will receive all the perks from Gov. Now tell me why vote for JOE.
Biden said he would of never closed the boarders or shut the country down. Everyone would be dead if he dealt with covid.
It‚Äôs too late and no longer matters. We‚Äôre looking to the Biden administration.
Don‚Äôt vote Kanye. Don‚Äôt vote trump. Don‚Äôt vote Biden. There are more candidates that don‚Äôt have a weird ass history, and even if you don‚Äôt agree with, for example, a libertarians views 100% I‚Äôm so confident they‚Äôd be better than the ones getting the media‚Äôs attention.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will deliver their convention speeches at the Chase Center in Wilmington next week, the Biden campaign said Thursday.
The hard facts, are that until we get this pandemic under control, nothing is going to get better. That should've been the focus from day one, but it wasn't. Trump talked miracles and hoaxes instead.  That is the first step, get Covid under control. Biden &amp; Harris will do that.
Personally though, I'd close down all of campus/most of Newark and put him on the steps of memorial hall at  (like the "Welcome Back Biden" Event) or shut down a chunk of Wilmington and do it in front of the Wilmington Train Station.
No matter how you feel about the presidential or vice presidential nominee, it's pretty incredible to consider how much history is *still* being created in Delaware.
Consistently voting for the lesser of two evils just brought us closer to evil.  If Joe Biden's brand of racism and sexual assault and anti-choice is polite enough for you to vote for him over Trump, fine.  Go for it.  It's your vote.    My morals won't allow me to.

He's just trying to get some air. He never thought Biden would pick Harris. He was counting on Warren.   It's why his game plan is nada  Just carrying over the 'nasty' from 2016 ... ho hum

I'm seeing less Biden support than I was for Hillary, locally.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
A little late on the draw here, CBS. She‚Äôs been in Delaware for hours

Wouldn't that be much closer to your preference for voluntaryism than Biden or Trump?  Most liberty "spectrum" people would argue smaller govt and less war increases liberty.
You think it won't be divided if Biden and the cop get elected?
Is this Joe Biden admitting He can't lead?
Joe &amp; Kamala kicking off their run together in my great state. ‚ù§Ô∏è I love you, Delaware.
Same in Delaware. It‚Äôs all about Biden.
Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's VP pick, arrived at the Hotel Du Pont in Wilmington at about 12:45 p.m. Harris and Biden will appear together at A.I. du Pont High School Wednesday afternoon.
Raining here in Wilmington but I an still determined to see Biden &amp; Kamala. Good thing I have a rain jacket in my office!
Bit of a downpour in downtown Wilmington but spectators (+press) are still huddled trying to see Kamala Harris when she leaves Hotel DuPont to go appear with Biden.   This tweet was half typed by raindrops
I am pretty sure that anyone crazy racist wouldn't be voting Biden anyway, since he gratefully served under and in support of Obama. To the people to whom it might make a difference, I suspect that is unforgiveable. Those people are ridiculous, but... here we are in 2020.
That doesn't matter. Because the next election it'll just be the same problem. Because the democrats won't push for progressive policies. We aren't going to stop the gop from putting up another trump just by beating him with biden now. And biden won't win anyway
Our latest:  has arrived at the Hotel du Pont
Hello from #Greenville, where a handful of #Biden supporters have gathered outside A.I. Dupont High School ahead of an anticipated appearance with running mate Kamala Harris. #NetDE #Election2020 #GreenvilleDE
Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and his running mate Kamala Harris will deliver remarks this afternoon A.I. duPont High School in Greenville.
DNC speakers include Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Jill Biden, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, AOC, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and John Kasich.
Harris said she believes the women who accused Biden of sexual assault. Kamala was the worst choice for Biden.
America a civil war soon.  Joe Biden the white Obama.  (Wherethenewsis com)

Vice President Biden and to Rep Harris I congratulation to both  of you the two of you are going to compliment  the ticket üé´  as a added note I am so Happy you will make the announcement At AI high school. I was the very first person to graduate with a disability back in 1978 I
That's irrelevant. Biden won't get turnout. People don't want someone to vote against they want someone to vote for. The states Biden did well on during super Tuesday will all go to Trump.  We also need to acknowledge that we didnt do anything about gerrymandering &amp; interference
Time to rock this  I live in Biden country. PA near Delaware in Chester county. We are team Biden/Harris.

Waste of a Vote
In a small state like Delaware, seems like everyone has a Biden sighting. Do you have a photo with Joe or Jill? Share it here!
also, you underestimate the people who didn't vote for Hillary because they weren't enthusiastic who now, despite not being enthusiastic for Biden (bc honestly why should they be) will vote for anyone bc they hate trump so much, hence "silent majority"
Reminder that  is still trying to exclude our digital producer Verna and video strategist Jenna from our guild, even though both are hard at work on our all-hands coverage of Biden in Delaware today. Do the right thing. Stop excluding your workers. Recognize
GOP are a bunch of traitors. Selling our country out to Russia. Biden and Harris are the true patriots.
I was about to post a satire thing about Harris standing in for Biden in at least one of the debates with Trump.  Then I thought, that may not be satire for long.
Biden‚Äôs Choice   #progress #politics #blacklivesmatter
Stephen,besides being a bum you don‚Äôt know the real Joe Biden. You might actually have to visit Delaware to meet Joe if he ever gets out of his basement.
Joe Biden needs to tell the American people how his idiot son Hunter got rich taking money from foreign countries with your help! And God forbid if you are elected what do we have to look forward to from Hunter and you other then more corruption!
In the current climate where people are massively protesting police, Kamala was probably the worst choice he could have made. Her cop past is exactly why her campaign flunked, I saw no chance for Biden to beat Donald and it just got even worse with Harris as vp.
Prolife Delawareans! Join us to protest Biden for his stance as pro-abortion ‚ÄúCatholic‚Äù TODAY at press conference. Working on location/time.
Biden doesn't stand a chance, he was put in place by the dnc to stop bernie, who actually had a decent chance to beat trump, biden is going to lose. We can't keep voting for the dems just for them to do nothing.
NEW:  has left D.C. and is headed this way to meet
Biden has been in office longer but nice try
Let me translate this tweet:  "The average, middle-class white woman will be voting for me, just like her husband has told her to do. They want safety from POC &amp; to keep their suburbs as white as possible. Biden is for equality, and would end my racist segregation tactics."
In the moment's leading up to¬†Joe Biden announcing Kamala Harris as his running mate, his campaign built the suspense.

Joe Biden supports not only abortion but LATE TERM Abortion.  Ask the Pope if this is acceptable for practicing Catholics who attend church regularly.   There is NO confusion as to where the Catholic Church stands on Abortion. #AbortionIsMurder
Now you want to cancel a Bishop because he feels &amp; believes differently than you? Look in the mirror.  Biden supports abortion &amp; LATE TERM Abortion.  There is NO confusion as to where the Catholic Church stands on Abortion. #AbortionIsMurder
Right?  said it best when he said trumpers trying to come up with some bullshit on Biden and Harris was like laser tag in a hall of mirrors. Can't think of a better analogy.

Actually he's a really bad Catholic.  Joe Biden supports not only abortion but LATE TERM Abortion.  Ask the Pope if this is acceptable for practicing Catholics who attend church regularly.  There's NO confusion where the Catholic Church stands on Abortion. #AbortionIsMurder
I think Biden makes up his own tenets of Catholicism to follow. His stance on abortion is condemned by the church. He shouldn‚Äôt  receive communion, if and when he goes to mass, in my opinion. A lapsed Catholic (CINO).
You guys push that dementia card hard boy but your guy was just up on stage talking about the flu of 1917 that ended ww2 while Biden was out exercising. Might want to sit this one out, just makes you all look stupid, I know it doesn't take much but still...
Oh I'm voting for Biden - there's no way I wouldn't - I'm just very dissapointed in his VP pick and in Biden in general since Biden is basically a republican. No other options that I have seen sadly.
This does: Joe Biden supports not only abortion but LATE TERM Abortion.  Ask the Pope if this is acceptable for practicing Catholics who attend church regularly.   There is NO confusion as to where the Catholic Church stands on Abortion. #AbortionIsMurder

Kamala Harris Is Biden‚Äôs Choice for Vice President
Trump is so bad that we have to vote for the person most responsible for Trump's rise in Government, Joe Biden with his establishment corporatism, DC elitism and Dem neoliberalism?¬†Short sighted. Vote policy, not party. Both parties cannot be fixed unless we get $$ out politics
Delaware is the place to be today. I won‚Äôt be there but I am a Delaware resident and am so proud of Joe Biden and welcome Kamala Harris with open arms to our state.
On Wednesday, Biden and Harris will make their first in-person appearance together as running mates, beginning mid-afternoon when they speak in Greenville.
There‚Äôs no more room. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, there‚Äôs just no more room in that pee brain for anybody else.
Are you old enough to remember Biden telling people they aren‚Äôt black if they support Trump?
Joe Biden‚Äôs mind is slipping. He forgets where he is; he stumbles and seems confused. It‚Äôs sad. Kamala Harris also had about zero support and dropped out early. She‚Äôs a terrible candidate who will excite nobody.
It‚Äôll haunt him when they impeach him after the Biden/Harris win.    They‚Äôll pull this out and have the evidence that he did talk about the Mueller probe.
A lot of Libertarians and (l)ibertarians seem like they are looking for any reason whatsoever to not vote for the Libertarian candidate.  SMH.  Not voting for POTUS at all can be defended, but voting for Trump or Biden over Jorgenson seems intellectually inconsistent.  Comments?
I‚Äôll be updating this #BidenHarris2020 story throughout the day, so keep checking back.  Meanwhile, we have these reporters and photogs out and about today:
On 1/21/2021 Harris would assemble the cabinet to vote to remove Biden. The 25th amendment provides that a President can be removed if the VP and a majority of the cabinet determine the President is ‚Äúunable to discharge the powers and duties‚Äù.
Biden is racist. Voted against black people constantly, incarcerated them at higher rates, worked to help crrate their all time high unemployment rate (under obama nonetheless), openly opposed the LGBTQ community, asked a black reporter if he‚Äôs a junkie and uses POC for votes.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to host two events in Wilmington on Wednesday
Manipulated. Biden was quoting someone else. I am reporting this.
Under biden as vp, we got kagan in the supreme court. Under trump we got kavanaugh.  Hear that you guys! They're totally the same! I know one is a respected intelligent woman and one is an alcoholic rapist, but theres no difference between them because "BoTh sIdEs aRe ThE sAmE."
Isn‚Äôt Biden a Catholic? Either way it‚Äôs an odd statement.
Governor John Carney, a former Biden staffer, reacts to the selection of Kamala Harris as the former Vice President's running mate.  8/12/20
Not impressed.  Her ‚Äúmoment‚Äù was ridiculously implying that Biden was a racist and beyond that I just didnt see a lot there.  Still at the end of day will Biden-Harris take the virus more seriously than Trump-Pence?  Of course, so not problematic enough to stray from #NeverTrump
No.  Biden is solid man.   He didn‚Äôt say, the 1917 flu ended world war 2.  Trump did. Trump said that.  Biden will win.
It‚Äôs bad enough he is tweeting politics, even worse he missed the fact that Biden is Catholic #fail
Everybody got all this shit about Biden and Harris but who‚Äôs the alternative? Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll wait
Harris couldn‚Äôt get a single vote when she was running in the primary. She isn‚Äôt going to help Biden.
Just to clarify. Biden ran against Castro, Harris, Buttigeg and many others. All represent some form of minority in politics. (POC, gay, women) So if he cared so much about equality, why didn‚Äôt he step aside and endorse any of them? Answer: because he doesn‚Äôt care.
A decisive victory by Biden/Harris is something to look forward to. Not much else I know, but it might rattle the dark triad kleptocrats. All is not lost, James T. Kirk would never give in, so nor will I. üòé
Am I the only one who sees the irony in Biden selecting a ‚Äúblack‚Äù women  to serve under him? Why not step aside and be her VP? Answer: because he doesn‚Äôt really care about POC. This is all about votes. This is race baiting at it‚Äôs finest.
Trump's goon are literally kidnapping protestors in unmarked vans and teargassing priests. Remember when biden did that as vp? No?
