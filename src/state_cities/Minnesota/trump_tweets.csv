Mask-hating Trump supporter banned from local store after she ‘rammed someone with a cart’: report #SmartNews
Wholeheartedly Agree. Furthermore, Trump is not worthy of the vote from any man who respects, cherishes, honors and holds-up women.
#ExecutiveOrder Trump can sign whatever piece of paper he wants, but he has no power of the purse. Only Congress can appropriate money. Trump's EO's are like him, useless.
Trump’s partial solution to the economic crisis is to end the payroll tax. How does this help the 32 million unemployed? If you’re not getting a paycheck, you get no benefit. A very stupid plan—doesn’t do shit for them. But business gets a windfall with temporary tax holiday.
So true. Makes no sense for veterans to support Trump. He’s stood idly by as Putin pays bounties for dead American soldiers. He’s blasphemed Gold Star families &amp; mocked disabled veterans. He’s driving the VA into the ground. And, Trump’s a fucking unpatriotic 5-time draft dodger.

TRUMP ECONOMY FACTS: a) 32.1 million Americans still unemployed; only 16 million receiving assistance; b) 51% of households w/ lower incomes; c) 27% of families go to bed hungry; d) pandemic unemployment/eviction assistance expired. TRUMP’S ECONOMY SUCKS.

I’m sorry Meghan, but you are dead wrong: Never Trump does in fact mean never Republican. Every single Republican on the ballot this November should be booted out of office. They’re all Trump sycophants. The party has lost the right to exist — and should be burned to the ground.
As the father of a daughter and grandpa to two granddaughters, here’s what I’d want asked of Trump: • “Why is it you always seem to be so intimidated by strong women; and when you are, why do you attack them by body shaming or giving them sexist or other demeaning nicknames?”
Compare that to the head of the Republican Party Donald Trump who owns none of his past. All of us have a past. Right Amy.
THE TRUMP ECONOMY: • 32.1 million unemployed.  • Only 16.1 million receiving assistance. • 55.2 million have a appplied for unemployment the past 20 weeks.  • 51% of families with lower income.  • 27% of families to go to bed hungry.  • Eviction/small business aid dried up.

Let's just stick with helping the people, $1 trillion for state and local governments who spent wildly on pensions??? No thanks, Pelosi needs to bring her numbers way, way down (below $1.5 trillion) before Republicans will do a deal. Otherwise Trump will likely act unilaterally.
The people who need help will get it and the courts will rightfully remove the power of Trump to act unilaterally but by then there will likely be a vaccine or at least a viable antibody treatment.
Sure, but Schumer is literally holding things up to get the SALT deduction limit removed (which only helps the richest)! I hope Trump does somehow do all this through executive action and it takes 6 months or a year to go through the courts which strike him down.

Kare11 are you going to ask sunrisers what they think of Biden’s incredibly racist comments yesterday?   Or does that not fit your narrative?   If trump said these words I can only imagine.....,.
Willing to lie to Congress. Guess he’s qualified to serve in the trump administration. Vote for Biden and get rid of all of these guys.
He does realize that people will not vote for even if it means 4 more trump. He acts like we have to vote him or else.
He has his faults but please admit panda bear that trump is not good and the Republican Party needs to find an intelligent moderate candidate in a the future.    Trump is really dumb... for real
Trump is bitter about the Tulsa rally where his campaign team got played by the  younger TikTok crowd. The is about vengeance and having to do it before the election. He can’t have a repeat, and needs to control the younger crowd from using this platform for getting out to vote.
Compare that to the head of the Republican Party Donald Trump who owns none of his past. All of us have a past. Right Amy.
Cause of Trump that creates division.
Those who know nothing reside in or work in Hollywood.  Trump cares about this country.  Hollywood cares about protecting pedophiles.

Why won't one single Democratic "So Called" leader stand up and denounce the violence going on in US streets where people are dying??? Why as acommon sense human being would you ever vote democrat again? TRUMP 2020!!! STOP THE TERRORISTS IN OUR STREETS!
Tough topic, no denying, but Trump has yet to address Russian Bounty-Gate with Putin which possibly killed US Soldiers, Taken Zero Action on COVID = 140k Deaths and stating "It is what it is". When George Floyd was murdered by a cop, he condemned #BLM &amp; gave cops $69 Million
Trump indicted
I worked for Bernie's campaign and i am a Democratic socialist, but I can see past my privilege to know what 4 more years of Trump will do to us.  I don't like Biden, but we have 2 choices, and Biden will bring a respectable cabinet and jurors with him. We need that.

Yea it would be worse. We would have millions dead to the pandemic because she wants to be politically correct. We would be at war with North Korea and Iran and China and especially Russia. We would still be in Afghanistan only more bombs would be dropped than Trump.
2 days ago: Trump: "Mail-in voting is evil and fully corrupt!"  Today: "If a state has Republican governor, it's all good and safe! If it has a Democratic governor, it's ripe with FRAUD AND DISASTER!"  It's funny to watch his lies morph in real time.

Everything is a culture war to Trump and his supporters. It’s toxic as hell and people are literally dying because of it. I hope everyone who is put off by this nonsense registers to vote so they can go vote this lunatic and his followers out of all the offices that they hold.
Not because of covid. It’s because of trump. 100%
The mistakes he is attributing to Trump were his on the test he took.
Sorry but I’d still rather have Biden than Trump.  He’s 100000000000 times worse
It’s honestly ridiculous. No reason it should have taken this long anyway. Could have had his full team assembled and confronting Trump as a quasi-govt all summer.
My God, you are SOOOO ignorant. Trump is also very against blanket mail-in voting.  He is fine with absentee ballots, which have to be requested, but sending ballots to everyone? When dead people in Nevada have their radical children vote for them it's going to be an epic scandal
Then asked trump for money to rebuild the city after he declined his help to calm riots,  he’s as incapable as they come
#Covid19 I guess to Trump, all the people dying from Covid are merely background noise....just incidentals...collateral damage.
ThAt was so painful to watch. Trump didn’t answer a single question. He can’t stay on topic.   is awful.
Trump has no ability to do so but election officials in a few red states will give it a try. Watch Florida, Georgia, and Texas in particular.

🤔this is easy! I love America and our freedom and rights! Trump 2020
He was never called a racist until he ran for president?  In October 1973, the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump charging that African-Americans and Puerto Ricans were systematically excluded from apartments.  Care to rebut?
"When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, they would order all black people off the floor,” a former employee of Trump’s Castle, told The New Yorker. Trump embraced “birtherism,” the false charge that the nation’s first black president, Barack Obama, wasn't born in the U.S.
In the years since then, Trump has assembled a long record of comment on issues involving African Americans as well as Mexicans, Hispanics more broadly, Native Americans, Muslims, Jews, immigrants, women, and people with disabilities.
This is nothing new for Trump. The very first time Trump appeared in the New York Times, in the 1970s, was when the US Department of Justice sued him for racial discrimination. He has repeatedly appeared in newspaper pages across the world as he inspired more similar controversy.
Journalists, friends, and former employees have accused him of fueling racism in the United States and some scholars have placed Trump's rhetoric and performance in the context of white supremacy.

I hear you. I've got no representation in DC other than Trump. Both Senators and my Congressman are all libtards, it's pathetic.
We actually are. Trump and his party have, no surprise, prioritized money over human lives. But they've been doing that since Reagan. It's enough to make anyone with a soul cry.
Given that it is the most sophisticated ever, like nothing we've seen before, how long will it be until Trump takes credit for this too.
I'm just wondering now that Trump is banning TikTok and having White House staff rewrite COVID statistics when he'll begin banning modeling. Because this is terrifying and likely to get worse the more schools he forces to open.
Like everything managed by Liberal Elites, such as our universities, the behavior being exhibited is a lie! To be honest, the signs should read’ “We don’t want Trump for President.” Instead, they have been taught to lie, cheat and claim this is about a virus. Defund Universities!
During the Swan interview, tRump said he was never briefed inre to bounties on US troops. If tRump had been briefed, he said he "would have done something about it".  He then said many ppl didn't believe the report was true. So why would he act on a false claim?

You know, I agree. Trump has devolved beyond any point of reason. He won’t debate, he’ll filibuster just like he does at rallies and press conferences. He won’t answer questions, he’ll just lie. Joe will win anyway, nothing to gain in a debate.
was brilliant tonight. Trump’s classifying his violation of the Hatch Act, another crime. Then the crass theft of $64 million by NRA officials and the suit to dissolve them. When we talk about equity in wealth distribution, these are reasons why. Grifters gonna grift. 😡
So, let me get this straight.. On one side... Universal healthcare. On the otherwise, let's burn this motherfucker down so Trump can make more money. I don't see how there is a choice.

Furthermore when Trump was here, estimates were that at least 20% of the crowd was registered Democrats. The only way Democrat’s win this time is a very significant increase in voter tourn out that goes unmatched by the right.
The thing about this is, it’s nearly impossible that Trump does not have at least the same level of support he had 4 years ago. Factor ipeople here were afraid of him and didn’t vote/voted 3rd party/wrote in.. Some are all in now. Then the D hard left turn.. It’s at least 50/50.

Trump types of friends! The majority of friends he has are pedophiles, raping child molesters, tax fraud _  money laundering felons!
Lay off the crack.  You seriously believe that facebook supports the alt right or google does.  How ficking stupod are you? Over 1500 friends on Facebook and be get "jailed" simpley because we support Trump. Trump 2020.
Trump tells No truth!
Serious question: Does this mean he'll force them to come out with something dangerous and/or ineffective?  Trump Says He Aims For A COVID-19 Vaccine ‘Right Around’ Election Day  via
Oh, evangelicals eat this shit up. They’re far more political than they are religious, and the appear to feel that Trump was sent to them by God.
Trump 2020!
Okay it's a correction, but just for a second, I was laughing like crazy, because if anyone deserves Twitmo or a permanent ban it's Trump. Maybe after he's kicked out of D.C. One can dream. Or at least one can if white and not in danger of deportation.
That's Trump's response to every investigation into his illegalities. Witch Hunt. Well, it should be Warlock hunt, but I won't quibble with that. I will though object to his getting away with anything he's done, including the information  presented last night. Damning info
What I admire most about President Trump is his subtlety
You can't talk about obstruction. The Heroes Act is what we need. Pass that. You've already said you will obstruct everything if the Senate remains in your control. You're as big a hypocrite as Trump. Remember Merrick Garland? I do. That's what obstruction is, you dolt.
Correct. They are dinosaurs! Big bird is using to fool you so they don't lose their business. They are also in cahoots with the anti-vaxxers and after funded by the lizard people. Trump appreciates then but doesn't outwardly support the lies of big bird
Does that mean trump and his family will only manufacture all their shit in the USA?  I highly doubt that because they are some of the biggest hypocrites in the world.
Advertisement and the actual programming don't work together at all - a network can run a piece on something stupid Trump said or an overpriced drug and then the ad pro ad for them could play because that's just the way it legally works. Networks LEGALLY have to run politcal ads
Trump wants it gone for good as well as the IRS. That’s the ultimate goal. End the FEDERAL RESERVE and IRS. See the price of gold as proof of ending the petro dollar soon
it seems Putin will have to be use facebook more as his investment payment service towards trump campaign. More rubbles that Mark Zuckerberg will deny was even on the books. #NRA is under the microscope She gave a hint of possible criminal charges as well, false info to IRS &amp; AG

Do you think it will ever dawn on them that they got played by that tweet about moving the election?  Trump pulls that like he’s playing reverse psychology with a 4 year old and they keep taking the bait.
I can't speak for anyone else, but I can tell you Trump and his party are people I have opposed my entire life. I spent 45 years in public service. I saw systemic racism, generational poverty up close. I believe all people are created equal. Trump is not that. That's why, for me.
This is the equivalent of Bugs Bunny certifying Wile E. Coyote as cognitively advanced and has just as much meaning. Sad when doctors sell their souls. Guessing this guy was NOT at the top of his class.
It will be fun to watch another Maddow meltdown when Trump is re-elected.
I hearken back to that great republican in the sky who said 'You can fool all of the people, some of the time, and Some of the people all of the time, but only Trump believes you can fool all of the people all of the time."

Peter Navarro just called Donald Trump a "working class President" and a did a spit take.
I loved Trump talking about doing acceptance speech in WH to save money.  Seriously?  How many trips to Trump properties were to save money?  Save money, my butt!  Wants in WH because of great optics - looks presidential not political, which it certainly would be.
Exactly, odds are it has nothing to do with tRump.  Of course I will be tuning in to watch but trying not to think about it.
Trump has strong willingness

If it wasnt for Covid19 and your Dem leaders lying over and over this economy would still be smoking hot,you are unfit to be President Mr Biden,the economy will crash,they will replace you with your VP as soon as you get sworn in because you cant handle the stress that Trump does
This is ridiculous! Trump has turn people against their own interests. Sad
Delusional. Trump believes his own fantasies.
I agree. Trump despises those reporters who stay on point and keep asking the tough questions. Acosta is the  of these times. He earns his stripes every time he has the floor.

Thats actually incorrect, but you voted to allow Trump to investigate his political opponents. So, you're fine with Trump actually doing it, but you're furious when Obama actually didn't do it,  but was accused of it by the gop?
failed our nation. But we will not fail as a nation. We have weathered many storms and may encounter more. The storms trump has created will pass and we will be stronger because of it. But we will never forgive or forget. #mkdreads
I guess they didn’t learn from this gem.
Trump is also wanting to defund the USPS, as well as try to tamper with the mail-in voting process.  If this is all happening, I have no choice to vote in-person at my polling station. I will just do that, and count my vote in for Biden.  Don't let this man tarnish your vote.
What a glorious thing it would be. Trump getting schooled. They will show him so much love on that schoolyard. Yah think?
Fat dumb con man. The trump brand is a total hoax. Never give money to this puke
I suppose the Trump kids could be put in cuffs first... Then wait for DonTheCon later
What if he offered to let anyone in danger of eviction live in Trump Tower rent-free until they could find a job?
It’s really not that brazen. Not one of Donald Trump’s supporters will a) bother to check this, or b) care at all that it is a lie.
The Donald John Trump school of spelling and pronunciation.
Easy and actionable, in rapid fashion. Responsibly done, these are all great ideas. We CAN make America great again, we need to after what the republicans and Trump have done to it.
That was an atrocious interview, he showed his true colors throughout. I'm betting heads will roll over allowing him to actually do it. He won't take responsibility, he never does, but he'll have to blame someone. We'll blame him.
Adding to the rapidly growing evidence that support from  is really a kiss of death to candidates. This pretend president has no coat tails. So, republicans are distancing themselves but it won't work. We see what they've done. We see them.
Trump is picking tiny points from her testimony and declaring that ALL he did was just fine. Declaring victory and  that what happened was the crime of the century. Of course, this means he is watching tv again instead of governing, but that's par for his course. Liar in chief.
Can we stop waiting for the magical moment of Trump “getting it”? It ain’t happing folks and it won’t happen in his supporters either.
Kanye West isn't a serious candidate for President. He's a novelty candidate designed to siphon votes of the young, casual, uninformed, &amp; first time voters. A vote for him is a vote for Trump. The republicans &amp; Trump are counting on that. Don't get conned again America.
And yet, pretty benign compared the terrible words that come out of Trump's mouth on a daily basis (that conservatives have turned a blind eye on for 3 1/2 years now...)
Trump has ruined a great economy like he ruined everything else in his despicable life.

I don’t like Trump. Never have. Didn’t and won’t vote for him. I don’t even really disagree with what he implies here, but does anyone really think throughout his career that Rather reported the news straight and without bias? The guy is and always has been a Democratic hack.
We should all set our DVRs if he does debate President Trump because we’ll want to watch the comedy for years.
Zero in Minneapolis suburb. Honestly I haven’t seen any for Trump either.
get ready bitches, Trump ain’t going nowhere!!!!
He thinks he's Tom Brady, 4th quarter 2 secinds to go frim midfield.  Calls the play that leaves his teammates with her head scratching.  Ball gets hiked and he takes off and runs with it expecting to score from 50 yards out with 42 year old legs... Trump you better add 30 yrs on
Trump could win if  thing.  Show hard evidence that what the media puts out there is FAKE.  Think how many people would swing.  But he doesn't have it so he diverts your attention to try and get you to believe because he can't prove with facts so he makes stuff up, that simple
Trump supporters - the case numbers and death totals come straight from the federal govt now.  Trump doesn't want to announce IT.  So then the media does and he calls them FAKE. He doesn't show numbers that were sent to them contradicting. Wouldn't you think you would if FAKE?

hope you are right. I think there are traps. Even if Trump does expose that Joe is senile which he undoubtedly will, there’s going to be a fine line between beating him politically vs abusing a feeble old man. We can run ads to show the senility. Bad risk/reward ratio.
Oh, Trump is ready to send anything Beirut needs.  Apparently willing to send them anything, but fuck the blue states who are really struggling with their budgets.
Jonathan Swan was AWESOME! He challenged Trump at every turn!
Im not sure. Biden has nothing to lose. Trump does. It’s like a #1 college football team playing a trap game. No upside. #1 team wins, they didn’t prove anything. Bad team scores, does well, God forbid wins, then the sky is falling. Add moderators. Spin. Newscycle. Not worth it.

He puts an idiot in charge, he cuts funding, then he says the Post Office can't do the one job it has, deliver the mail. All so he can run a false narrative about the coming election. This is what certain knowledge you're going to lose looks like.

Ask yourself why you allow Trump to use partial truth and you won't let anybody else.  Because all you care about is a Republican party not the candidate, who people know is a liar.  That's why I'm not voting Republican.  Not because of another party

Karma will be sweet when his Azz and his adult children end up in prisons. Mean while Clinton was cleared long ago my the trump administration And today, the FISA's were cleared as valid and proper
Trump has pardoned more people that he's friends with since he took office then those he isn't friends with.Good for MSNBC! No more free press for Trump, every news channel should boycott him! Why have we not learned trump just wants attention. Don’t make the same mistake as in 2016! It’s not the scoop now, it should be saving our people, our country, our lives, &amp; our democracy!
That Trump has been able to do what he’s done for the past 3+ years with no checks and balances tells me that this country’s political system not only sucks, but is grossly ineffective and broken. What an absolute shit system of govt we currently have here in the U.S.   Fact.

They are responsible for the botched response, somehow I think he has done it on purpose! Bottom line, it’s time that we as a nation ALL do the right things to get a grip on this, don’t wait for the Trump and the trumplicans to solve it for us. Mask up, social distance, be smart!
Trump is afraid the kids will cause him more problems with Tik Tok. Keep at it kids and God Bless you all! 😌
Oh I can't just pick out part of it and spew that to push my agenda...sounds exactly like what Democrats do to Trump.
Nope voted for Obama bud.  Which was a mistake.  People are sick of what is happening. I had my best year of business in 20yrs last year. It was thanks to how the government was being run as a collective, not just Trump.  I have a lot of Democrat friends and they see this too.
Also show me the exact legal documents showing "Trump" not anyone else,  that he colluded with Russia.  If you say his associates were charged, then you prove in this picture that Biden is a Racist by association.
Explain why Biden is holding hands with a known racist.  Are you so 🧠 washed you cannot see?  This is a what is wrong with the left.  If this were Trump holding hands with the KKK you would never hear the end of it.  You haven't addressed the picture that is clearly relevant.
Mixed up I'm from Minnesota.  Not a troll, just a Patriot!  This picture speaks for it self.  You must be apart of the herd of 🐑 that came up empty trying to connect Trump to Russia and failed in the last 4yrs.

3) Census and redistricting. Trump has already worked to fuck up the census. We only get them every 10 years. You want to wait until after 2030 to fix gerrymandering?   4) Hundreds of OTHER agencies, thousands of political appointees, all working to help us or fuck us.   SMDH!
It’s the Democrats who are assuming black voters will vote for him because he’s black, that’s why they’re worried, Kanye is normally a Republican so he could honestly take some Trump votes and it makes sense why some Republican “operatives” are helping him
Democrats want you to vote for an old guy with dementia, and they want to stop a black guy from running so that no black voters can vote for him (suppressing their vote), also Kanye decided to run on his own, no one’s forcing him and some republicans support him over Trump

Why bother debating Trump at all? Seems like very little upside for Biden and a lot of downside considering Biden can't spend the whole debate fact checking the president.
Sorry, I won't be complicit with Trump, but based on the Democrats corrupt action for the last 4 years, I won't be voting for any Democrats either.
Trump was ambitious too and did anything and everything he could to win the presidency. He could also attack effectively. Is that the kind of politician we want? Do anything for politics? There is a way to challenge someone that is based on respect and Kamla lacks that.

Allowing Trump to win is a fast track to a worse world. Dreaming the impossible dream will not only increase the risk, but if you were to succeed in making some small, meaningless dent in Biden's support could almost assure it.
I’m sorry.  I just can’t get past reading “Trump” and “plan” in the same sentence.  For the record, I have gradually (slower than I’d like to admit) come to the conclusion that we need universal healthcare, covering all conditions.

You realize Trump gets America to pay for his golf outings at his own course. Essentially making his business money, 100% profit, that goes back into his portfolio.
If North Korea made a shittier version of the Yugo, with extra pollution, that would be Trump.
Again, feel free to stop bringing up the previous president and the future president to change the subject. When Trump golfs, do you think he is paying for all of that on his own? The taxpayer money goes to his own resort. 🤦🏼‍♂️

This is basically me every time I see Trump or his enablers speaking, nay, lying once again as they do on a daily basis... Our love will conquer their hate. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Lmao 600k followers of trump haters and you’re mad your poll still didn’t end the way u wanted it 😂😂
And its the democrats that wont do anything not trump
2) Racist smears of a Texas doctor show the hypocrisy of TDS Democrats. Her expertise as a physician is proven by her medical degree and license to practice medicine in Texas. Christians believe that a spirit impregnated the Virgin Mary. TDS Democrats call Trump a racist?
Well many ppl aren’t safe in Trump’s America, so we’ll take our chances.
Sometime this fall, there will hit 250,000 deaths. This administration failed to plan for an inevitable pandemic, recognize it when it appeared, marshall resources needed to fight it and plan for effective controls to end it.  By time Trump gets booted out of office 500,000 dead!
#MeanMictchMcConnell couldn't even get his own party to agree on a bill. And believe me, if the  controlled Senate can't stand the stink of his and Trump's garbage bill, then the #Democrats won't even want to get close to it.
Which is a pretty shitty thing to do since court records back up Terra. I like a politician who can follow the law when it comes to rapists and pedophiles. Both of which Joe Biden and Trump both appear to be. Great choice...get some moral values.
Cain is responsible for being stupid enough to skip wearing a mask to suck up to Trump.  Trump is an accessory.
Trump puts smelling his own farts first.

Trump, that is
And shout out to the  for getting it here on the hop. Don’t let trump kill and privatize the Post Office!!  #protecttheusps
You mean republic ballot harvesting. That is more historically accurate and would make more sense since trump would have so few votes.
Is that a euphemism for running into Trump?
I think Trump supporters should vote - but in December or January. Should be safer then.  The rest of us can vote right up thru Nov 3.
Trump floats idea of delaying election, congressional Republicans reject idea
Acck acck acck. I will get you trump
“The court will stop him...”  And, if he says, “The court has made its decision, now let them enforce it?”
You realize that Democrats want to vote, it’s Trump saying that maybe we shouldn’t... 🤦🏼‍♂️
Do you support Trump’s plan to delay the election because it’s too unsafe to vote?
We were saying the beginning, its Trump's white supremacists that turn peaceful protests into riots. Police: Hell's Angel set on inciting "discord and racial unrest" sparked Minneapolis riots Over George Floyd's death
Trump says something crazy... wonder what he doesn't want us focusing on now?  😱
Meanwhile, the Trump Administration has shrunk the economy by 33% in the last quarter, while killing 150,000 Americans.  Piss off, traitors.

Trump is literally going out of his way to take away something we all use and enjoy, making our lives worse. Yet, his supporters are so toxically brainwashed that they don’t even care.
Yeah Trump'll get right on that.. When hes done golfing for corpses.
It’s all been a mispronunciation on Trump’s part, just like Thighland. Trump has actually been saying that he’s a be-lying-aire this whole time
Here is trump, sending planes full of doctors and nurses, food, medical supplies and more help to Lebanon, yet people are reacting to it in a bad way? Come on, get over yourselves
My one thing with this is that he appears to be running on a conservative platform. How will that be an asset to trump?
Live: Trump holds news conference  via
Translation: Trump will be holding a televised MAGAt rally. He will say that hes doing a great job on the virus and the economy. He will then blame a country that doesnt praise him alot for the Beirut explosion. Oh, and it will also be a free commercial for one of his properties
If you’ll excuse me— that doesn’t appear to be true. Trump and other Republicans are able to slough off any legal challenges with nothing more than a dismissive sneer
"Can't compare numbers because then Trump's numbers look bad."
Working for Trump and Putin now, I see.
If anyone can donate a ”DOLLAR” to Jamie Harrison or Amy McGrath please help them, us, America to out these tyrants from our government along with voting trump out!
Can our "Spy Agencies" do anything about it? Or is their mission ended by reporting it? Or is this decision controlled solely by Trump and his band of cheaters?   Can ANYONE protect us? #VotePeople #UnTrumpOurCountry  #UnMagaAmerica #PleaseVoteVoteVoteVote

Fed a Trump campaign survey by in-app advertising. Completed it to give them negative feedback. (And what a whiny bunch of questions it was about how “unfair” the media is!)  I was then hit with texts to join pro-Trump and pro-GOP lists.  Should this work as an “unsubscribe?”
Did you post this photo of an adult kissing their daughter in hopes it’d get Trump’s attention?
WTF? You elitist PoS. Most Trump critics I know are better educated than Trump, well traveled, much more cosmopolitan. I include myself in this.  For someone with his advantages in life, I am stunned at Trump's narrow and provincial world view. And that he eats such crap.
It will only last until Democrats get back in office.  Trust me on this.  President Trump should also have a line item veto power for budget purposes to control spending like other can governor... conversation of states is shooting for.
Another in a long series about the stupidity and selfishness of the Trump Cult that we’re calling— Dipsh*ts On Parade!
Real Americans need to vote Biden no matter who he chooses. The alternative is an unchecked Trump, who will only get crazier, more ruthless, lie more, and become more corrupt.
Donald Trump's following the Goebbels playbook.
Trump doctrine- never speak to those who know the facts.  #Factsdontmatter
Trump thinks black voters are idiots.
A joke right bc how could a woman vote for a man like tRump.

I also live in MN-in Duluth. I literally see NO Biden signs but I see trump signs on more and more cars but no one wants to put them on their yard. Except a few people. I’m trying to figure out how I can start something to get our governor out! Or how to start impeachment!
They did it and are doing it to Trump too. He’s sick and flailing and should be under a doctor’s care. In jail. A jail doctor.
Trump pushing this idiocy so hard only proves that its horseshit. 🤣🤣🤣 He thinks his Jedi mind trick works on the African American population now. Im pretty sure the world knows Trumps vs Bidens views on race relations.
Don't bother Donald Trump, he's taking another 3 day golf vacation at taxpayer expense.
Trump's invasion of mexicans from 2018 is now the coronavirus vaccine of 2020.
Trump is a bigot, talking about biden now. First Hillary, now biden.
Trump must be spending on frivolous travel 10 times what Wayne LaPierre looted from the NRA for similar reasons.
Biden could go the distance. If we help him he could very well help us. I see a lot of potential there.   Dump Trump!
Lmaoo if trump thinks getting rid of tik tok is going to keep youth from not voting for him then he’s underestimating all of the CS majors from liberal arts campuses ready to code the carbon copy of Vine to talk shit about him

When did Biden withhold money? And Trump blocked dozens of people testifying, which made for a completely unfair trial. And even further, a few people did say in as many words that he withheld money in exchange for political dirt. Biden wasn’t guilty, so he didn’t block anyone.
Yes, PLEASE make America again, RESIGN, and let this great country have normalcy, dignity, HONESTY and RESPECT again!  If you Mr. Trump really cared about this country you would resign immediately.
Haha all I’m saying is he’ll be in his 80’s when his 4 years is up. I’m sure he’ll win but I don’t think he makes it all 4 years. Just a few weeks ago he said Arizona is an important city 😂 and I feel bad that Trump will get the pleasure to pick on him during these debates
Lol no it was a legit video where he was talking in front of South Carolina voters. Hopefully he won’t get too confused when he has to debate Trump. I’m sure Trump will bully him
*Downloads TikTok purely for spite.*
Bank complies. Trump's financial report?
Trump wants to ban Tik Tok becuase the “Tik Tok teens” spoiled his stanky ass rally at Tulsa. Not surprise here besides being a pedophile he is also “counterpuncher”.... of 12-year-old children nonetheless. #TrumpleThinSkin

Supporting Trump.
He already has... Anyone that thinks he's substantially better than Trump is delusional. And if the best we can do is slightly better than TRUMP... we deserve to fail.
Joe Biden wasn’t my first (or even fifth) choice, but I’ll gladly vote for him to put an end to Trump’s presidency.  If you can’t bring yourself to do that, I don’t even care to know who you’d prefer.
I thought they were smarter but Barr came across as an absolute idiot at that last hearing. Starting to feel I overestimated him. I wish I knew what made Barr want to jump in front of a speeding train for Trump and risk his 7 figure salary...
I’m remembering back in March, when we were all horrified by Trump saying that 200k deaths from COVID would be a success. Now it looks like it would be an absolute miracle if the year total is that low
They already have risked their futures for him. They may not be as smart as you give them credit for. That being said, when the time comes, they will ALL throw Trump under the bus...
Trump lies You spread his lies.  The GOP has run from the truth. Shame on all of you

Trump Makes Up A Lot Of Things
WATCH: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand In The Way Of A Trump Prosecution
I am personally calling trump out of office.   Worst president in all history! #DumpTrump2020
Don fucking trump how dare you use the words children and immunity related to COVID-19.    How BLEEPING STUPID ARE YOU!
Here's a hot take: Biden might be dumber than Trump.
Whenever Trump brings up religion, I start to see red.
COVID-19 POSITIVE: Gov. DeWine's office says he has no symptoms but will be returning to Columbus before Trump arrives to the state of Ohio.
One thing diminishing my faith is that Donald Trump hasn’t burst into flames or been struck by lightning when he says things like this.
Biden makes clear Trump wouldn't get any special favors to avoid criminal prosecution
CHANGE OF PLANS: Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine tested positive for COVID-19 today ahead of President Trump's visit to the state.
So? And on a side note..  what made you such a cvmswallowing Trump worshiper?
And you think Trump is coherent?
Unless Trump is talking about shots of disinfectants again? There is no company out there that will be ready to offer vaccinations to the American public by November 3rd or this year.
Focus on Trump's police in Portland.
This is reckless  Trump says coronavirus vaccine possible before Nov. 3
Honest question: do democrats actually like Biden? Or are they just waiting to pick his running mate so they have someone they actually want in office once they can deem him unfit for office if he wins?   Whats the Biden appeal other than "he's not trump?" Not being snarky.
So you'll vote for Trump? Young Black Americans not sold on Biden, the Democrats or voting - Biden is courting the Black vote – but fewer than half of young Black Americans surveyed in battleground states say they will vote for him  via
Bad news guys so Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine tests positive ahead of Trump visit (from ⁦
This action might be well-deserved, and will admit I have always believed “it’s never the wrong time to do the right thing.”  But it concerns me that during a presidential election year this could stir-up right-wing voters in states Trump needs to win for the Electoral College.
🤣what a joke. Biden doesn’t lead trump in ANYTHING!  Do you really think the American people want a coward in the basement to be running our country??? HELL NO!
Thinking back, it was probably so hard for Trump to even share a stage with that nasty, vile woman knowing what he knows about her.
You know his is Trump blowing shit out his ass, not gonna happen, most projections say at the earliest it will be available in 2021
before the last presidential debate between Trump and Hillary they had Trump down 11? unless Trump really F’s up i think he’ll win by a landslide
Give me a break. Trump is so desperate to be re-elected (though it beats me why) -- he will probably order ppl to be injected with liquid bleach and claim it's the new vaccine. I say whatever "vaccine" he claims is available by Nov. 3-- he and his family PUBLICLY take it first.
God I miss Obama as my president. Trump is a buffoon
Pete and Trump basically  the GOP are literally trying to Jedi-mindtrick Americans into believing that we're not dying and go about your daily business as usual. Bad idea Pete.
Sounds like what Trump did after the Obama's moved out.
Thank you  Donald Trump for promoting this kind of bad behavior.
Ask if they're sold on Trump.
It would be a mistake on anyone's part to set Trump and his supporters up with anything that lets them play "victim" at this point.   He and his Senate lickspittles must be seen as the ones in power and at fault for this mess. Indictments or impeachments now are counterproductive
When I make anti-trump tweets every once in a while they will attract a troll  When I mention George Floyd, they come out of the woodwork  Does this happen to you?
because of the “illusion of truth” wouldn’t it be better to state the truth followed by trump’s lie (with an attempt not to restate the lie)?  Shouldn’t this be a policy of all fact checking organizations because restating the lie gives it the veneer of truth?
Good. Lord.  Scroll this thread to see just how sloppy, unprofessional and desperate is the  effort to get Kanye West on the ballot in Wisconsin as an independent.  If entire pages of voided signatures don’t have “Trump Op” written all over them, nothing does.
In a normal election cycle this would be quite troubling for Biden.  But since the primary purpose of Trump’s campaign is the grift, a significant percentage of that $165 million is getting laundered through hotels, golf courses and fellow crooks rather than used to defeat Biden.
The difference my guy, is that Trump withheld money from Ukraine to get that investigation.   The NY AG is doing an investigation she’d normally be doing. Without holding military funding or anything else in order to do so.
Like most Trump statements, this scarcely coherent. But my facepalm moment?  “I saved the Second Amendment. ... Without me you wouldn’t have a Second Amendment.”
President Trump can do it &amp; should just because Pelosi doesn't want him too. The President won't if anyone complains &amp; he said that!  Pelosi blasts Trump for saying he may deliver convention speech from White House: 'He can't do that'
Trump is in trouble!
I’m guessing Trump didn’t block that because they are lies or falsified and don’t make him look bad, without his full taxes.
Seems a bit too fast to be talked to Trump taxes.
If it is "state charges" they COULD aim directly at him, right? There is no pardoning. If it is Trump org, could be the whole gang, right? Would NY AG be working with our IC in bringing the charges? Any hints there?
I would be happy with a Giuliani! Trump is the ultimate prize though. If they want to squeeze him more, I will bear with it...
I think it’s funny some of the journalists that are tweeting this. When someone other than a Fox reporter gets to interview Trump you have to have all brain cells firing and you need to ask the tough questions. #journalismmatters
Hopefully it winds up falling on Trump's Toadstool... 😉
Me: *Begins reply to Trump supporter on this site.*  4yo: Who are you texting?  Me: (Mumbles) Somebody dumb.  4yo: What?  Me: I said “somebody dumb.”  4yo: Why?  Me: Uh, because that’s basically what Twitter is.  4yo:

Wow. You people will believe anything. They were talking about Biden and whoever made this, put in Trump where they originally had Biden. Lol.
Makes you wonder if trump also believes that Santa Claus really DOES deliver all the nation's Christmas presents? 🤔🙄 I'm quite sure the USPS can handle some extra envelopes...as long as trump's hatchet-man, DeJoy, doesn't complete the destruction job he was sent to do.
So you really don’t care about Biden, it’s just a ‘well he’s not Trump’ and that’s it? I asked pretty simple questions and your response is basically ‘I’m mad at you for asking questions’. Be prepared for Biden to win less votes than Clinton did, as that’s a distinct possibility.

Always do the opposite of what any Trump says.
Gut the White House as Truman did in the 1950's.  How else will we get rid of the Trump stench?
Donald Trump is a traitor and has zero credibility.
Trump and his admin have absolutely zero credibility. Only one on that WH Task Force I trust is Dr. Fauci.
Way to confirm good reporting and that Donald J. Trump is a lying sack. Now do the Healthcare bill signing ceremony that wasn't held on Sunday the 2nd now to be on the 31st of August? If he's lying about that, demand he resign.
Myself included. Biden is a PRIME example of blues that have no business ever touching power again. Him and his buddies are why we got Trump. Failed rightwing policies spun as "leftist policies". Great job.
What even is this propaganda bullshit? You all set yourselves up for failure by repeatedly posting about how you'd vote for a bag of shit over Trump. Now that's what we have. Remember, a lot of people were never about the BNMW motto, myself included.
Trump- "4 months ago Obama didn't have a test for the Coronavirus".  Jonathan Swann- "4 months ago there was no Coronavirus".
The more Trump rants about fake reporting, the more I trust the subject of those rants. Keep us informed of the facts  👍🏼
yeah. Don’t knock on my door during a pandemic, dummy.
If it was just trump, he’d break like a cheap glass straw.  The real threat comes from the herd of insatiable pigs standing behind him over the tax-payer money trough. They have every kind of incentive to prop him up by any means - legal or otherwise!
Respected by who? Trump is delusional.
Why would Donald Trump have an interview with a real reporter?  Were they that arrogant that he could  convince Jonathan Swann that he isn't a psychopath?
Fake President Trump is cheating and lying as always
GUT THE WHITE HOUSE, whenever the fuck we kick Trump out.
Trump just implicitly on national television threatened Ghislaine Maxwell not to spill the beans. Trump is unfit and should resign.
And really she’s a street-level-staffer to Trump, using Kanye in a desperate bid to siphon votes from Biden.
This is like Pablo Escobar donating to anti-drug efforts. The Trump Modeling Agency still bringing teens into NYC?
In this time of Covid, where are the children trump kidnapped and put in cages?
and  both committed  voting where they didn't live,  in FL and Trump in NY when he lived in the White House.
Fuckin Embarrassing 🤦
But her emails and Karen Bass are much more important than Trump's running a human trafficking operation?
Monarchies usually end up dead and not by their choice. No one likes you and especially not any of your children. Only Trump anyone would elect is Mary.
I honestly think you are wrong about that.  Filling your head with disinformation is not good. I get the “ hear all sides” thing but if you know it’s lies, then why listen? Also, why would trump and Barr bring this to light and have Maxwell arrested if they were part of it?
Trumpists: Probably still Trump  I don't think the Kooky Evangelicals have a leader this time but they could probably run Rick Santorum again

Karen Bass or Hillary Clinton, more highly reported on and analyzed than every Republican, ever. Imagine if someone would have looked into Donald Trump or McConnell with just half the effort used de-boning Karen Bass? It would have saved 150k lives.
Trump is not going to win with current behavior, I guarantee it!!
How come with all these socialism country's we aren't jailing more spies? Here nothing on the news are we going soft? Their has to be all attacks on president trump.
Good analogy. Trump has killed thousands of Americans with just his jawboning of the truth.
I can't believe  kept it together during that interview with Trump.
So the great negotiator took a 2014 order for 10,000 ventilators at $10K per ventilator due to arrive 11/2019 (last year) and renegotiated to get 10,000 ventilators delivered in 2022 for $50K per ventilator. Talk about a day late and half a billion short.
No worries.  Trump wouldn't know or understand that anyhow.
Or maybe you're not getting Trump’s feed?
Trump next week, probably: "Nobody knew this would happen, how could we have known?"  Angry Narrator's voice: "Everybody knew this would happen." 🤬
What's amazing is that Trump is essentially patting himself on the back over the fact that we have such a metric shit-ton of corona cases due to his epic mismanagement that a whole lot more people should have died (but didn't).
What did Trump expect, doing a non Fox interview? Was he that egotistic, thinking he could con a real reporters with charts?
But we know that will never happen because he's a constant source of easy content.  "You won't BELIEVE what Trump did this time!"
Time the Trump has the best words again.  It's 20,020.

I am not a Biden fan either but 3rd party vote only helps Trump.  I am all for 3rd party but not in this election.  Trump is dangerous.  Biden isn't.
But this.... I mean #itiswhatitis
It only works if we can have a reasonable discussion.  Too often in these times nothing is reasonable.   Most of the Trump supporters I know either go on attack or go to blaming Hillary or Obama!
What a petty, small man  is. Just like his parents as we find out in Mary Trump's book.
This would be great comedy if it weren't real.
I am not happy that no one is running this country so all the ppl around the idiot in the White House are robbing American taxpayers blind while people are suffering and dying. Because Trump is in over his head. There is no one in charge.
This is bullshit!  Debates are a tradition in this country and if the dem candidate can’t debate, then he should have to drop out of the race!!! Do you think the dems would EVER let Trump get away with that??? HELL NO!
Even if Biden were as willfully ignorant and cognitively impaired as Trump — and he isn’t, but for the sake of argument let’s assume he is — Biden is NOT an inherently evil, selfish, egomaniacal sociopath incapable of a moment’s self-reflection or deference to others’ judgment.
Is Trump Russia’s personal world defense attorney?
They’re talking about Trump here, right?
This is incredible. Swan is excellent and really holding Trump accountable for what he’s saying in the interview.
I love how the interviewer keeps stoping Trump when he tries to make it about himself. Hilarious. Interviewer wasn’t haven’t that BS. AWESOME.
Wow, the level of incompetence is otherworldly. Trump is truly dumb on another level.
A Trump supporter argues against Obama as "The most radical agenda in a century?"  Gonna start a GoFundMe to get this guy a watch.
That's why Trump only has like 50 people to choose from for his 1000's of vacancies... and most of them wind up being filled by Kushner.
I will point out once again that Candidate Trump denounced the last Presidential election as "rigged" (he was right), and was kinda baffled when he won.
Your husband and you are the biggest liars, frauds and demons this world has ever seen. So for you to say that Trump did a bad job with covid is hilarious! Did you do a good job with Benghazi??? #BenghaziAintGoinAway #Killary

I wonder how much Trump has cost United States? No salary, but riding a money tide towards his shore.
Would you still champion the art of listening if Donald Trump was still on his mask?
Exactly! And he had set himself up to be Trump's main obstruction guy... Mueller was his buffer and his attempt at saving his own ass. Rosenstein is a survivor.
Meanwhile TRUMP is tested every fucking day!!!
Also take away Trump/Barr's talking points (not that this will stop them.) 🙄
There is a 90 day window used as a guideline so as not to interfere with the election. That just happens to be this week! Anything comes out after this week and Trump will cry how it is trying to "interfere with the election". What a goddamn snowflake... 🙄
You’ve lost a friend to the Trump Cult virus. My condolences.
I've been ready  the vote with 90% of Donald Trump's hometown since November 2016.
Maybe if Trump is reelected we will have to pay a licensing fee to the Trump Org in order to participate in interstate commerce.
Why don’t you just blame it on Trump...you blame him for everything else 😜🤣🤣
I wouldn’t say Trump is any less demented. He claimed that the last five questions in the dementia test were “very hard.”
Trump will only not take down TikTok if a US company buys it, and pays the federal government a part of money.   So he’s saying if he doesn’t get money he’ll shut down a multimillion dollar public company. That sounds sus ngl even with the security concerns
So you’re still gonna ignore trump and Epstein. Fun. What do you think he was doing at those parties, leading a fucking prayer circle? 🤣
This is Texas from the Economist's model. While the trend line is showing a slight trump lead (call it 1.5%) the majority of recent polls in Texas actually have Biden winning. The Economist is giving trump a boost to account for shy voters, if the pollsters are too, Biden wins.
I don’t want to see them. You can’t really debate with a psychopath any more than you can argue with a Trump Cult member. Biden’s strength would be in calmness and reason not the needed frontal assault for lies and failures.
While  screams and yowls his lies about more testing causing more cases, in HIS house, you get tested when they tell you, or else.  Trump is tested 2-3 times a day.   #Republicans, #Qtards, #Conservatives, #Tcot you're all being played.

It's amazing when Trump people call Biden a pedo when Trump was BFFs with Epstein and has so many rape allegations against him, at least one of which was by a child, that I had to stop counting.
No, Biden's ahead of trump by about 7 percentage points. The worst case polls in 2016 were off 3 to 5 points and they're looking for/adding in shy trump voters now so Biden's lead may actually be higher. As long as people turn out to vote it's going to be a lopsided election.
From Trump at West Point.
I think Trump is holding one end of the scarf and gives it a tug when she is about to speak. If she decides to go full Fauci, he will Epstein her on the spot! I like your theory too though, that is a great story... 😆
Trump's delay in addressing Russian Bounties to kill US troops with Putin worries me...
Those stupid can get on the tRump virus train. Problem solved
Better yet. Donald Trump lied about a comprehensive healthcare bill signing ceremony on Sunday August 2nd. He lied about the cost, availability,  coverages of a healthcare bill during a pandemic.
That post is referring to Trump. You need a new hobby besides obsessively searching thru someone's year old posts.

Trump - he would always talk in the third person.   Even though he hasn’t done it before, he has some real ‘represents self in court’ energy.
I'm not sure how you could possibly have misread that.   When we, progressives, criticize Biden, democrats screech that we must be supporting Trump.   There is no room on the Democratic party for criticism of the candidates.
Trump is obsessed with putting his name on things..  I am honestly surprised he hasnt commissioned a memorial to himself.   I hope Biden erases the Trump legacy from the White House and all documents like, you know, Trump did to Obama.
There never was a plan.. There will be no plan..  anything Trump does at this point will force him to admit he was wrong... that he is flawed.. that he caves under pressure. I think we all know whats more important to him. #TrumpHasNoPlan #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
The 2016 clown hysteria is a recognized panic. I've always felt there is a Facebook employee who knows alot about ways to drive some people to near madness. Drive them blind with fear to vote for Trump.
Just feel we should all know about the religious cult Falun Gong's relationship to tick tock and the Trump organizations' propaganda.  Is a tick tock countdown a no tick tock tick tock? Happy healthcare bill signing day!
Please ! This is happening in Dem fool America ! Trump is a patriot !
If Biden wins, we're going to know fairly early on the evening of November 3rd. To win, Trump must sweep FL, GA, NC, OH, and PA. If Biden wins just one of those 5 states, trump has no clear path to victory. He'd have to win WI or MI plus 4 of the previous 5.
Just lie about what you've done or intend to accomplish like Donald Trump.
Idk. Found an article from 2017.
Who said this? Machiavelli? Goebbels? Karl Rove? Every Trump operative? Answer: All of the above.
It’s an old picture. Found a 2017 article with it.
Trump's EPA is waging an all-out assault on clean air protections in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis. Now, they're refusing to act on a critical air pollution issue. Urge them to reverse course via
He’s such a fast-talking liar. Good job by the interviewer; he’s in so deep with Trump and he can’t talk his way out. I liked her question about how much time he’s been spending on Burisma vs. COVID. Even he knew his focus on smearing Biden didn’t look good.
And that’s why President DONALD TRUMP is perfect for the job!
It's ridiculous because...? We the taxpayers are shouldering an obscene amount of burden to pay for the current president's golf trips. We're also paying for secret service and others to stay at Trump's hotels. You all bought into him giving up the presidential salary but... lol
That anyone  could choose as a running-mate would be a better successor than Pence, so people shouldn’t make that a deal-breaker.  Biden-Ham Sandwich &gt; Trump-Pence
Who would notice with the radioactive hurricane of dumpster fires swirling around Trump?  BTW, the Pinto was a fine practical car for a family on a budget.
If Trump had let science and doctors handle this pandemic, instead of Jared, people would go back to work and to school.
TW for NSFW language and violence.  But my favorite part of the reporting: “A bystander in a light cyan shirt tries to lead him off.”  LIGHT CYAN?  Is the crime reporter on vacation and the fashion editor filling in?
Our bestsellers of July! No surprises here. People have been stopping in and asking for books to educate themselves on race and white privilege. Also some of our favorite authors are hidden in this stack. And of course Mary Trump swept the board. Which have you read? #indiesfirst
I will vote for a ham sandwich before I vote for trumpTravel ban from China was inadequate; COVID was already here.  Compare what POTUS did vs leaders in Canada, New Zealand, Norway, etc. Trump did little nationally because he thought it was going to hit Blue states the most. He figured let the individual governors take the blame.
Not well.  If Trump wins in Nov, you might see a lot of folks at your southern border submitting urgent immigration requests.
Trump is starting up more trade-war nonsense with Canada.  A worldwide pandemic with 1000 people dying a day, and he finds time for an ill-conceived fight with with our neighbors!   #CantWaitUntilNov3
Didn't Trump just sign an executive order to do that himself???
Trump. Tariffs have devastated  American farmers too. Trump doesn't know nothing about economics. Trump.  Made sure when he chose his administration that they would be loyal and incompetent just like himself!
Perfect evidence that Trump has no idea what ObamaCare covers and no idea why he is challenging it in court.  BTW, the hurriedly-scheduled "Press Conference" was held at a Trump golf club and began with the playing of "Hail to the Chief."  #DidISlipIntoAParallelUniverse
Trump wants a Prime Time TV show alright.  But I want to believe he'll be too busy with his lawyers preparing to defend all those state and federal charges that he should be facing.
You know that the Republicans didn’t agree because they knew they would make Trump look good before the election. Democrats May have just lost November... He’s gonna eff this royally.
Trump could sign an executive order granting the right to bear arms, and his followers would applaud.  #CultOfPersonality
What kind of parallel universe have we slipped into?  Dr Fauci should listen to Donald Trump?????
Yeah...and added applause by his followers after Trump signs an executive order granting all citizens the right to bear arms.
Such ignorance!  Trump and Company have no clue what provisions are in the ACA.  They are not policy guys.
America.  Now that Kanye West is entering the presidential race all the Republicans should vote for West over Trump! He'll make a better president!
Trump never had a clue what the ACA covered or didn't cover.  Appears even his spokesmen aren't big on details.
The administration is already struggling to deliver the mail.  How is centralizing power around the Postmaster General (who got the job because he was a Trump donor) going to help get the USPS ready for an increase of vote-by-mail business this fall?
When Trump says he'll defer "payroll taxes" through yearend, it effectively "defunds" Social Security. The GOP will then want to reduce benefits because they'll say SS funding is inadequate. There are better ways to give the American people a financial break during this crisis.
Sadly, there are people out there who will think Trump actually did something substantial here.
Trump.  Think that when he does an executive order. He'll be the savior that swooped in and saved the day! So , remember America.  When you come up short on rent or mortgage. It's all Trump fault. Stop supporting fools like Trump and the Republicans leadership!
Trump.  Supporters must realize that the Republican failed policies affect them too. Why support a political party that have chosen to let your family starve.
If Trump cared about security measures in the USPS, he'd order the Postmaster General, whom he appointed, to get things in order.  DJT promised he alone could fix things.  If the administration can't deliver mail, how can it manage far more demanding responsibilities?
There have been so many great Time covers during the Trump regime.
Dozens of Trump's Bedminster club patrons in their shorts and golf attire in the room.  Probably held more for their enjoyment than to deliver substantive news.  They even began by playing "Hail to the Chief."
Trump has no clue what's in the ACA.  He's just against it because Obama was for it.
Forbes: Gaming Stocks Plummet On Trump Executive Order Scare.   via
Teri Ann, it's being pitched as a "press conference" and the Press has been called in.  But clearly it's a Trump performance for golf club friends.
Tbf, Biden's main platform is "I'm not Trump" so they're both doing it
Cult of personality.  Trump's supporters aren't listening, evaluating, considering alternatives, etc., the way you and I might form an opinion.  That's why arguments, charts, statistics, and facts won't sway them.  He's their guy and that's all there is to that.
Giving a speech or news conference from a Trump resort is illegal and definitely a conflict of interest! Trump must pay for his own TV. time . Not on the  taxpayers dime.
America.  No matter how many gaphs Biden might make his heart will always be in the right place. Trump.  Is a cruel and evil man and so are his supporters. They all need to be brought down a notch! ROME IS BURNING!
The Republicans created the Trump movement. They tried  to illegitimize Obama and legitimize Trump for years.  The Birther movement, the republicans did nothing. All that racism for a racist to takeover over the republican party. ROME IS BURNING!!
Friday.  Someone in the Trump Admin should be “resigning” any moment.
America. Are we to believe that a stupid  and irresponsible man , like Trump could bring  down democracy all by himself? Not possible.  Trump.  Have plenty of help to become dictator of a country that he have little heritage in being a part of. ROME IS BURNING!!
If Trump truly believed the vote-by-mail process was flawed, he'd call the Postmaster General he appointed into the Oval Office and have him fix it.  DJT is always talking about all the power he has; let him flex a little with Mr DeJoy.
😂🤣😂😂  Not only are you a miserable person, but you're extremely delusional too!  Biden has a much better chance of winning 40 states than Trump.
Trump.  Is having a hard time attacking Joe Biden on any issue. But the Trump campaign is waiting to attack who Biden VP choice. Trump.  Have no plan!
Ain't Got No Home - The Ballad of Old Man Trump  via
He described Trump supporters perfectly!
Trump took office during a time when much of the world was experiencing growth. The growth continued until the pandemic hit causing a significant rise in unemployment over the past 6 months.    This graph inappropriately suggests the president has a causal effect on employment.

These numbers are people being rehired back after losing their job. We still have over 30 million on Unemployment.  So no, Trump is NOT the Jobs president.  #buyabrain
Russians paid to kill American soldiers and Trump says and does nothing. But TikTok needs to be restricted due to national security issues??
It's tiring to see certain news networks.  Like fox news and others. Try to normalize Trump and his administration.  There's nothing normal about the bullshit that the American people are going through, with these crises that's  going on!
Trump.  Presidency is over. There's no re-election,  so why waste the time campaigning you only making things worse for yourself and the country! GOLF ANYONE!!
I just saw someone post the other day that went along the lines of "You need to vote democrat if you normally vote third party, because voting Trump out is more important than voting for your ideals."  Oof.
I do both. It's just easier to drag Trump since he's in office right now.
And also that they can attack Biden for "being senile". There are tons of other things that are WAY more valid to attack Biden on. Plus Trump's insistence that the 1918 pandemic was in 1917 is just... Weird.
America.  Trump . Is breaking all the election rules. There's too many violation to count. There got to be someone to watch over all these violation.  Democracy can't be that weak and out of touch! ROME IS BURNING!!
Kanye West.  Is trying to obstruct an election in favor of Donald Trump. He's must be getting paid for his efforts.  West doesn't have a platform that he's running on at all. An investigation is in order!
Wherever Trump goes the virus will follow. People are gathering together just to see you pass by for a rally parade.  Irresponsible president! The Trump virus keep on spreading.
Trump. Is giving campaign speeches during work hours. What's this country coming too! How unfair is that. Using taxpayers money to hold a Trump rallies, is a campaign violation! Where's the republican outrage! Cheaters.
America.  If Trump would've never gave that rally in Tulsa.  Herman Cain would still be alive! RIP.
Joe don't blow it. That's what Trump is counting on. A desperate man will jump on every opportunity to take you down, and Trump is an opportunist!
Thanks, Mark, for the link to the full Axios interview.  DJT  talks about his ratings as if we're all just living in a Trump reality show.  He gets a kick out of watching us go crazy over his ludicrous answers. You called it:  "willful ignorance."  😷🌊

Trump.  Never made a comment about the Russians putting bounties on US soldiers,  but when it comes to the NRA, committing illegal activities, Trump . Jump right in obstructing justice.  Trump. Is the lawless and disorder president!  ROME IS BURNING
Karla, I hope those you love recover completely.  💔 As for Trump, make sure everyone you know is registered to vote.  Talk about the election to 18-21 year olds.  Remind them they have the power to oust Trump with their very first vote.

He’s right. Majority of black people will never vote for trump. I don’t know many who will. Know some that get upset when another Black person does too. Overwhelming majority. Look at polling in the last election. Latino vote is not as one sided.
Baldwin to Trump: The numbers are strong? Look at this
hey Pete, Biden wants to get rid the 2nd amendment?  He is a gun owner right now. Has Trump ever been a fun owner?
The pre-gloating from the left yesterday on the assumption that the New York AG was going tp  be releasing Trump's taxes must've been a YUGE letdown Ahahahahahah
I hope SC defeats Trump and Graham, but even if you don't in 2020, it is crucial that you *try.*  Dems will never break through in red states until we're seen putting up a fight.  Gotta get visible in the public square.  Be brave; be safe.
James, Get somebody busy with the 18-22 cohort!  Fresh new voters who can say forever that they helped oust Trump the first time they voted.  I live in MN, but I just sent your Democratic Party a little $$ to help. Hope others will, too.
Hate him all you want, he's not trump. Just remember that.
If another supreme justice has to step down for whatever reason that's one more person dump gets to pick and need I remind you his last one was a rapist who day one made it clear he supports trump (which those on the Supreme Court are NOT suppose to do)
I hate Biden but I'm still going to vote for him. Why? Because its going to be biden or trump and I for one don't want another 4 years of that walking shitstain destroying this country.  Also keep in mind its not just biden we are voting for -c-
Trump.  Is failing miserably in his re-election bid. He yelling out conspiracy theories and foolish lies. Even most of his supporters aren't falling for his shitless behavior anymore. ROME IS BURNING!!
People need to stop posting things about the shitty stuff Biden has said or done. Yes, we get it, he is not great by any means but crap like that is going to convince people to just not vote and every single vote not for Biden is one less trump needs to worry about.
It's obvious that the Trump administration want to hurt the school system, kids and their parents, by allowing schools to reopen. The most irresponsible president that ever sat in the oval office, only cares about his own self interest and those around him! ROME IS BURNING!!
Wherever will Russia launder it's money after the NRA and Trump Org are shut down....
Can you discuss Trump, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve Bank relationship?  My concern is that the Treasury is buying and inflating the stock market with ETF'S.  The Federal Reserve Bank is funding the Treasury purchases or making direct ETF purchases. Trump loss = crash.
Don’t make Donald Trump look like the hero...
I’d wait in line for weeks to vote Trump out
Marc, I’m distressed about all the folks willing to vote for Trump, too.  We just *must* turn out every Biden voter.  Remind your friends to vote for “down ballot” races, too.  Can’t fix everything without Congress &amp; State Houses on board.  🌊
Pence.  Is a disgraceful vice president.  He's done nothing to reel in Trump from making changes in their administration reckless behavior and policies. Pence and Trump. Must resign, that would be best, for America. Their carnage have devastated the American people!

Just another reminder that as long as Trump is in office, his first and main concern when it comes to foreign policy will always be lining his own pockets. The American people and national security are far down the list.
You're not trading democracy tho. Just show up to the voting booths. Have early times reserved for the elderly. Voting is as essential as walmart. Trump is right that mail in ballots are more subject to fraud and it is av legitimate concern
Yes.  Especially Moscow Mitch, Trump's #1 enabler.  Everyone who can needs to support  (either in the ballot box if you live in KY or with a campaign contribution for those of us who live in another state).
I still think about the  article from last week that described a White House willing to abdicate all responsibility for COVID-19 to the governors, because they thought Blue States would take the hit.  Trump is still in an #AintMyProblem mode.
Dear Republican Party leaders:  This pandemic has unnecessarily led to a large number of deaths due to your incompetence and bullshit political agenda (trying to make the economy look better to save Trump’s job).
Jesse, those 7900 deaths per day didn't bring our economy to a grinding halt or stress out our medical and hospital communities.  COVID has.  To compare normal life span events to the morbidity and mortality spikes due to the negligence of the Trump administration is misleading.

Trump has been asked repeatedly what’s on his to-do list for the next 4 years.  He still fumbles to find an answer.  Times up for the guy who’d clearly rather be golfing.  Vote Blue.
Damn straight.  Opinion | Val Demings: Remember Senate Republicans who dismissed Trump’s wrongdoing — and show them the door
Truly ridiculous. Because he’s trying to help the country against a virus? They think it’s some elaborate plot to destroy Donald Trump and will swear by that and call people fools who don’t agree. Who’s the fool? What sane person thinks a worldwide virus is a plot to stop Trump?
I’m not a disenfranchised Republican but I am a #LincolnVoter because NOTHING is more important than making Donald Trump a one term, ineffectual ‘president’
He is trying to run out the clock.  Strategy seems to think that trump is going to beat himself.  For all trumps flaws exposed by a relentless media. This is exactly the same trump that ran in 2016.  There have been no surprises. Biden will need to stand up to beat him.
Campaign $$$ has one main purpose: spend, spend, spend at Trump properties.
Black Total Level approvals strikes me as high for a GOP president.  Are there comparisons for other GOP presidents from Rasmussen?  If the African American vote shifts to Trump, by 5 percentage points or more, it seems like a no win for Biden.  What can Rasmussen share?
"Let's open all schools! Get the kids in the schools. They learn better there. They will be fine."  This is not a joke. If/When a child or teacher die, that life will be directly on Trump and other local leaders who pushed for this.

Who’s trump gonna lose to? That bumbling geriatric Biden? Lmfao k.
Last week POTUS wanted to ban TikTok.  Today, claiming "It’s an amazing thing, whatever it may be," Trump is happy for its purchase by Microsoft as long as the government gets a "piece of the action" (sounds like a bribe, no?).
Man, that Axios interview of Trump just decimates the POTUS, and it's mostly self-inflicted.
What a crybaby. "WHAAAAA HE DIDN'T COME TO MY PARTIES!!!"  Trump will never amount to anything close to Lewis.
I haven't been to either, and I know how to pronounce the words.  Trump is an idiot.

Trump on Covid death toll: 'It is what it is'
Can that Jonathan guy interview trump every time. I would enjoy that.
Also,  earned a follow. His ability to concede small, little, non-material wins to Trump to boost his ego leading into the next bombshell question is great.
I mean, I didn't need to see this HBO interview to know how deplorable Trump was at being a President, let alone speak at a 5th-grade level. But this somehow, incredibly, is next level. Wow.
Here's an example...  Trump: "Many people are saying we're doing a great job."   "Who's saying that?"   Trump: "Many people."   "Right. But who exactly? Can you give me names?"   ☝️ That's the level hardly anyone reaches. But he has no answer if the interviewer gets there.
What's true about that Trump  interview has been true all along. 2-3 levels of follow up to a single issue or answer reveals the emperor has no clothes. And "who" "what" "how" and "why" are most effective to get there. (1/2)

Trump.  Still trying to defend his incompetence and the administration botching of covid19.  America is headed down the wrong path with Racist Trump and Moscow Mitch leadership!
Trump wasn’t the president of the United States at the time. Bill was.
Trump is so totally out of his league. Of course, we need to hear him, but why do his handlers let him go out in public?  was well prepared and just carried on despite the incoherent nonsense that flowed from DJT. Can you get a Pulitzer for an interview?
Most of us know the limit of our expertise.  Trump, though, is willing to go out and make a fool of himself anytime, anyplace, on any topic.  You and I know he’s out of his league, but what’s frightening is that 38% of the country thinks he makes perfectly good sense.

I'll try not to hate, but Mitch McConnell bears much of the guilt for the mess we're in.  I'm not trying to absolve DJT of anything, but a good portion of Trump's agenda would have fallen into oblivion if we had a Senate Leader willing to provide appropriate checks and balances.

Trump’s Axios Interview: His 9 Wildest Answers, Ranked
What makes Trump think he can do this by exec . . . oh, never mind.
Trump: I will be singing an executive order today that orders the sun to rise in the east within 45 days or it will have to begin to pay a tariffs for the use of our skies.  🤦‍♂️
Drug dealers don't vote for Trump
And everything else Trump touched. Let's see if karma is real.
Trump: today will be signing an executive order that makes grass green.
What do think the Maga cult is to trump? Just out of curiosity...
Wow! Antone Melton-Meuax’s public and (now) infamous criticism of #BlackLivesMatter is the same as Donald Trump’s criticism of #BLM in the #AxiosTrump interview (31 minutes in). #MN05
Funny so calling a true #ResistanceUnited member a karen because I can't buy there #GreenParty  thing. I believe in reality. Reality is we need to remove trump. Dream of the green thing in the future. But for now lets get our country back first. VoteTheRedOut. Simple as that.
Trump: I'm signing an executive order today that will make all stop signs say "stop"
Anyone involved in this from the Trump campaign had better lawyer up and fast. There are going to be indictments come February. Lots and lots of them.
I came to Twitter to watch Trump implode. So far it's been a big success. The side benefit is the camaraderie and reading posts from really well informed people. My big secret is that my granddaughter opened this account. Fishy and Jacky are her cats.
We could work backwards on Trump's failures, but COVID is the most acutely dangerous, so serious people are focused on that.
Forthcoming is a DNI statement “only candidate Trump is receiving help at his request for Russian influence and has actively sought foreign influence from other adversaries of the United States of America.”  Where’s  statement regarding vote by mail sabotage at USPS?
Didn't Trump just sign an executive order to do that himself???
What a difference a crippling campaign makes. Though I bet the amount is not the $600.00 the Democrats were fighting to keep.
guys stan my mom, she said she hopes trump gets covid and dies, so inspiring 😻😻😻
Not much else to report from the #AxiosTrump interview except, why does Trump always talk with his hands like that? I mean, like he’s super ready to receive a hiked football.
Trump: If biden wins, antifa and other leftist thugs will celebrate with all Suburban mothers who used to support me, but hate me today. They paint smiley faces and on the streets and plant flowers in their yards.
(Donald Trump) &amp; the (CDC) Recommend that all (Americans) should Wear this (Exact Mask) Daily when out in Public...😎🐱🦊🐱😎
So, Trump's healthcare plan he told us a couple weeks ago he was gonna announce last weekend is an executive order for insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions, which Obamacare already requires, and which Republicans are trying to end with a lawsuit before SCOTUS.
(Donald Trump) &amp; the (World Health Organization) Approved of this Message...😎😋🥣🧀🥓😋😎
Trump: If Biden wins, he'll be controlled by leftist thugs who want to eat, raise a family and not die because of morons like me ... oh, wait 🤦‍♂️
my grandma really got sad today seeing on tv que “trump le está quitando tik tok a Astrid” bc my mom messed with her into thinking I need tik tok for school 🙃
1) You're right  2) I want you to know the impact your book "Unholy" had on my mentor in ministry. He's a brilliant guy in his 70s and is suffering slings and arrows from his circle for coming out against Trump. He said your book was devastating. He was shaken by reading it.
Normally I wouldn't be rooting against my country, but at this point I support any country or leader who is willing to stand up to trump in any way.  Keep up the good work, Canada.  🇨🇦  Also, if y'all could renew Anne With An E that would be great.  It's my favorite 🇨🇦 export! ❤
right advisors. People see Biden as a safe bet. While Trump is volatile.  All that I’m trying to say is that people across the spectrum are just exhausted with Trump/Trumpism and that’s been reflected by the way people feel about Biden and this upcoming election.
BreKing news- Trump has ordered the Earth stops rotation
A year ago, I kept hearing that we had to impeach Trump because baby cages.  I said impeachment wouldn't stop baby cages.  We impeached. Baby cages didn't stop.  But we stopped hearing about them.  I wonder why?  .
I mean he was also Barrack Obama’s Vice President...so that carries some weight.  It’s worth mentioning that while Trump hasn’t explicitly said some of the things that Biden has said, he’s said some other awful shit and I mean think Biden’s competent enough to serve with the
I'm looking it up...its not a Trump wine is it? lol
I think I would vote for him for 50k. The US is a failed state and the worlds fucked anyway. At least I could live out my last days without worrying about bankruptcy. Fuck Trump. 🏡🏝🍺🍔🚬lol
Um, you just confirmed everything Trump tweeted... they sent a 3 trillion bill ballooned with trash spending... the democrats trying to blackmail the country... give us socialism and we’ll give you a little stimulus... Liberty isn’t for sale
Thanks  Here’s Trump trying to take credit for a law you already put in place. #obamacare
And now I learned that Kanye has admitted that he is trying to help Trump win.
Retweet this of you want more healthcare, and less Trump lies.

#AxiosTrump Trump sounds and looks like a kid who’s been busted and sent to the Principal’s office. Except there’s this weird power dynamic... like the kid’s holding a gernade.
Biden should not debate trump. He doesn’t need to because so far he seems to be doing well in the polls. Only trump stands to gain from a debate regardless of how awful and stupid he acts.
Trump can’t even acknowledge that people have died because of COVID-19. Instead, in his deranged Trump-Latin, he says “We have a 140,000 people at this moment. This is a very very serious situation.”
Trump Virus - you own this mess.
They should thank Trump for the $600/wk in enhanced unemployment benefits they got so the could sleep during the day and riot at night.  Ops money ran out on July 31sr lol. Doh!
If Trump gotadollar for each vote and have one away for each he loses.  Bankruptcy all over again, again, again again, again,again and you guessed it...again
I sometimes wonder if Trump intentionally mispronounces things to distract from his abysmal mismanagement policies.  Mostly I don't think he is sharp enough to be doing it intentionally, yet nonetheless the distraction factor persists.  #WaggleTheDog
Yep. No one who votes for Trump in 2020 gets forgiven. It will be on the pop quiz before you hang out with my daughter.
People actually voted for this guy, right?
The slow down is due to new leadership appointed by President Trump.
Then Trump should go to church and pray.
(Donald Trump) Ordered (*Baby Moose Legs*) for his *Dinner* at the (White House) tonight...😭🤬🐂🦌🐂🤬😭
no worries, I'm blaming Trump for not putting a travel ban on them
incumbent. Traditionally incumbents try to expand on the base but Trump hasn’t done that at all and he’ll be playing defense in most of the states that he won in 2016.
Finally watching the Trump on Axios interview. I think his insistence on misremember the “1917” flu is actually a secret wink to the far-right Allah the Russian Revolution(s) of that year.
Let me get this straight...if he can't kill America's seniors and disabled with Coronavirus...payroll taxes pay Social Security and the disabled. Two groups Trump hates.  Trump says will unilaterally suspend payroll taxes if no deal on coronavirus aid
I read an article on fb about rona reaching my trump thumping home town Then I read the comments Then I had a stroke Then punched a hole in my wall At this point I don’t know if Marky here is being sarcastic or not but I think Steve is onto somethin
I’m sure that’s true but based off of polling, even with the recent slip, Biden is doing really well. Yes I realize that polling isn’t everything and the pollsters got it wrong in 2016 but 2020 is different and Trump is running a 2016 base turnout campaign that won’t work as an
I love that u keep calling me a troll, and I love that when I decline to bet money I don’t have because I work a minimum wage job you’re going to call me a troll again. you’re being willfully blind if you don’t think trump is a rapist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic dictator
We've been living at our lake house in small town (3k ppl) North MN. Trump signs everywhere, 2 Biden signs in town. I've counted 16 Trump flags on docks; here's mine.   Haven't been back to house in MPLS for 3 weeks, so not sure about there. But I do have a Trump sign on my deck.
I don’t disagree that obama built those cages, he’s a war criminal and did so many shit things, but the way trump speaks encourages the separation of this country, we’ve NEVER been more divided than we have now. he’s the worst president we’ve ever had.
Was never where? You’re the only one calling victims liars here. There are dozens of women coming forward with claims against trump and you’re calling all of them liars, why?
You support a liar a grifter and a traitor, a man so deprived he would fail to support our troops, our own sons &amp; daughters in the field, to even question reports that the Russians put bounties on them for fear of losing Putin’s support in the elections.
I get it. My daughter and her fiancee fled Frisco TX in 2017, and never looked back. His Trump-loving mother convinced (emotionally blackmailed) them to move down there from Portland, OR. And our family is ALL DEM ALL THE WAY! No blue dogs here...
Another state given something for votes....most of that money is probably going to Trump Towets anyway.
TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸
I can't believe it's not a foregone conclusion. I mean, seriously. LIFE SUCKS NOW because of Trump.
I’m against religion and want to hurt God. Biden has my vote, thanks Trump!
Perfect evidence that Trump has no idea what ObamaCare covers and no idea why he is challenging it in court.  BTW, the hurriedly-scheduled "Press Conference" was held at a Trump golf club and began with the playing of "Hail to the Chief."  #DidISlipIntoAParallelUniverse
Trump already turned them down.  No money for Minneapolis.  And I live here.
"Did you vote for Trump in 2020?" will absolutely be a question asked before anyone is allowed to physically interact with my child
And Trump is no different? Lol. I know I’m whatabouting here but my honest opinion is that Biden will only serve one term and even with his gaffes, he has a lot of support(even if it’s just a lot of people who will vote against Trump). I’m gonna vote for him and I know a lot of
That’s already the law of the land. In fact, tRUMP is in court trying to overturn it. Stop lying to Americans.
Why is the media so surprised when Trump tries to take credit for something he actually opposes? He's been doing this his whole life.
Trump just ordered her a get well card, shipped her a case of hydroxychloroquine and a personalized “Trump 2020” rectal laser light.
I know that grudges aren't healthy, but I want every person who votes for Trump in 2020 to die alone.
Trump has denied federal aid to Minneapolis after the riots as well.
So what if aha had it?  You have complain about the trump actions and he addressed it. Your point is meaningless.
I virtually stopped speaking to my younger brother when he accused me on Facebook of having "drunk the Kool-Aid" for expressing my fears about Trump after 2016. We've reached a rapprochement of sorts since. But guess what! He's a postal carrier!
And YOU ARE... Clansman Trump???
My words aren't going to put any one in or keep anyone out of Heaven.   If your God is cool with you voting Trump, I can't argue against it, but that sounds like a shitty god.
Who da man? Trump da man!
I believe in atonement.   I do not believe that many Trump voters seek (or will seek) atonement.
And why’s that? I’m not a trump supporter but obviously everyone can see both sides 🤨
If you're okay with Trump getting reelected if Biden doesn't pick the right vice president, then you'd be fine with crashing the plane because the co-pilot doesn't wear Armani.  5/10
If you don't want to vote for Joe Biden over Donald Trump because of any reason that starts with the phrase "both parties", then you've never understood the difference between a steak dinner and a bowl of maggot-flavored cyanide.  2/10
A quick guide for responding to people who claim to want to defeat Trump, but who tell you they don't want to vote for Joe Biden.  A thread.  These are a bunch of previous tweets strung together.  0/10
So true. I filed an adjustment of status in February right before the Trump public charge went into effect, but it’s August and still ..... nothing 🤷🏾‍♂️ I hope everything works out well for you, good luck !
I thought about typing "everyone who voted for Trump" but I have a tiny bit of forgiveness in me.   But if you, in 2020, support Trump, you're going to have to convince me that I shouldn't wish you were dead.
I know I'm not supposed to say this, but I can't wait until everyone who still supports Trump is dead.
BIG NEWS Trump three weeks ago said in two weeks he would reveal a new healthcare plan.   BIG NEWS: it’s Obamacare!
(Donald Trump) &amp; (Joe Biden) Approved of this Message...😎🐸🐧🐸😎
Well..there was birtherism/the Central Park 5. Oh and Trump was defending the confederate flag not 3 weeks ago...I think what Biden shows with this apology is that he can at least account for his actions.
And Donald Trump is never going to walk out of the Oval Office. We will need a military coup to overthrow him. But likely the military will cave to him if it comes to that. Because of a list for power. Anyway. Just spend time with your family and spread love.
I would call Mr Wolf up if I had a problem: Trump's got Rudy🤦‍♂️
Wholeheartedly Agree. Furthermore, Trump is not worthy of the vote from any man who respects, cherishes, honors and holds-up women.
Trump said the USPS needed to raise its rates.
Family size sounds about like mine but I still have a 1/3 or more that are trump supporters.  Still cannot figure out why they back someone like him.
via    "It doesn't matter how I feel.  Doesn't matter if you like Biden or not; that's your personal feelings. -no one cares. What people care about is what happens to the world.  Get rid of Trump.  Keep pressure on Biden. Politics is activism."
Question is if you believe any of the current party members are complicit in Trump's message and antics... those who are, need to go too.    are just as bad of eggs, or worse, than Trump...
2-3% of folks vote for Kanye as a joke, maybe serious, 10% of mail in ballots dissappear, large urban cities have minimal voting stations, and there you have your Trump victory.
trump's hush money payments to his attorney, Cohen. Cohen went to prison this.
You’d be surprised by the blowback the Wild got from switching it TO ‘Let’s go crazy’.  Bunch of Wonder bread, trump loving surburbanite season ticket holders were pissed they couldn’t go ‘WOAH OHOHOH’ any longer.  True story.
Trump wants a Prime Time TV show alright.  But I want to believe he'll be too busy with his lawyers preparing to defend all those state and federal charges that he should be facing.
Ilhan Omar has an immigration agenda—and it’s the opposite of Trump’s.  by
Both Sanders and Warren? Those were just terrible. So, now all I am hoping for is undoing Trump’s damage...but real change for the better? That ship sailed.

Trump is looking at perp walk in Jan 2021 and he will "thigh land" and "YO-semite" and hiss like snake to keep those ratings away.
It's because Trump is going to sign the new relief package, so they have no leverage anymore.
Not trump.
Man I can't wait to see how insurer's react to this one! Trump is really sticking it to them. They have NO IDEA what is coming. All to help his fellow Americans, such an incredible leader.
Yes, indeed it does. But the rest of Obamacare is an absolute catastrophe. Trump is saying that he’ll get rid of that travesty and replace it with something that ISN’T intended to destroy, and that the new plan will cover pre-existing conditions.
Trump is completely in competent.  He is corrupt beyond belief.   Everything he does is corrupt.
Thank you Eric!!! I love Victor, but I love your principles too! It's so true that people need to wake up, and see what is happening, right in front of our noses! Which is to say, the US going down the drain, thanks to Trump!
Lie, cheat and ruin the postal service, the only way Trump knows how to play.
Trump’s partial solution to the economic crisis is to end the payroll tax. How does this help the 32 million unemployed? If you’re not getting a paycheck, you get no benefit. A very stupid plan—doesn’t do shit for them. But business gets a windfall with temporary tax holiday.
I think picking an all male ticket would’ve been a bad decision. Not having a woman help beat Trump after what happened to Hillary would’ve put turnout at risk.   Though I do think he needs to pick a woman of color.
unindicted co-conspirator with Cohen is trump ...   Here's the proof
It also feels like the GOP was supposed to come away with nothing accomplished so Trump can swoop in with executive order and look like he solved everything.
Bwahaha, hes so dumb  "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
only if I wanted to survive .... and I didn't have trillion$ of reason$ not to  go ahead, keep asking questions like this and see if pig 🐽 jack and his turquios-haired militants don't ban you 🤣😂🤣👍  Trump 2020! KAG 🇺🇸
You know that the Republicans didn’t agree because they knew they would make Trump look good before the election. Democrats May have just lost November... He’s gonna eff this royally.
Trump politicizing COVID is why so many people like this have died and will die
These woman are waiting on you, Trump...
Trump could sign an executive order granting the right to bear arms, and his followers would applaud.  #CultOfPersonality
Oh goid grief!  Look at EVERYTHING Trump has said and done and leave Joe alone!  Joemeant no harm, he apologized and yet the media is crucifying him!  Build the man up and stop making this negative!  Go after the racist Jerk in the WH😡😡😡
I can’t prove it yet, but I’m quite sure this is Trump’s fault.
The short little guy with purple shorts is a Trump supporter....
This is already in the ACA you dolt. Thanks to Obama. Pssst...tell your peeps. Trump just endorsed the law. SMDH
Just having a trending hashtag with the name Trump means he's still more popular. Lol #ThingsMorePopularThanTrump
After 2016 I’ll never trust polls again.
Although the two clowns are disappointing, the future of our country is at stake with another trump presidency. Voting third party is just a vote that isn’t defeating trump
You're. Comparing. Trump. To. Lincoln. Turn in your "I'm an idiot" card in at the desk and just go away.
There's Something About Mary Trump #MorePoliticalRomComs
I think it could be working! tRumps response to COVID deaths "it is what it is" displays pure evil. I think tRump is Satan.
People are pissing me off big time. Green party Bernie bros Kon man west Pull your head out of trump and Putin's ass. Give it a god damn rest a be Americans. Your weak bullshit is a copout.
Since when aren't masks recommended at a protest? Trump is again going against the recommendations. SMDH
Trump dishonors the dead.   He dishonors all those, who’ve given their lives to sustain our country.
What kind of parallel universe have we slipped into?  Dr Fauci should listen to Donald Trump?????
Remember, the #WhuFlu doesn't spread if you riot and vote Blue.  But if you're red, and go to work or a trump rally you'll 100% catch it.
I'm am more smacking my head about Trump trying to pass one , that already is law.   Did no one tell him, or they know and just think their voters are dumb as rocks and won't notice.
How could any Trump victory in November be accepted as legitimate at this point?  If he wins, we'll have but two choices: 1) accept despotism and await our stolen country's inevitable collapse or 2) begin an interregnum on our terms &amp; hope its survivors create a new republic.
There are many ways to skin a cat, but you first have to agree the cat needs skinning.  Problem is, Mitch McConnell has ceded all his authority to Trump Administration and Donald went golfing and Mitch has been solely Laser focused on changing the courts into kangaroos.
I love journalists who take random potshots at us, instead of actually being strong and resolute against Trump.
great🤣😂keep saying sensible things.. and the rotten puke in SDNY is going to demand hidin' biden's financials 🤣  just kidding, that NY hack is a dem establishment... puke graham will do REAL subpoenas before 'they' look at any dem traitor  TRUMP 2020! sick of the establishment
Don't believe it for a minute.  Hillary was projected over 300 in August too. We all know how that went. Polls still aren't adequately representing Trump supporters
Another Friend of Trump.  I think we’ll better understand all of this upon reading Michael Cohen’s book.
Yeah...and added applause by his followers after Trump signs an executive order granting all citizens the right to bear arms.
OR they are worried about the possibilities of what he could do. Not as in “Trump will get the US in a war with China/Iran” but more so Trump is taking back what America has given up. Manufacturing? Oil? I honestly don’t know. But it does make me think.
Ok, so now what? I haven’t been a huge Trump supporter(he needs to learn to shut up) but to me this says something. It says that a “formerly” communist country and a country that is unsafe for travel from the US are worried about what Trump has done already for the US.
Perhaps Trump himself will vote for Biden. That way it can be unanimous.
So true. Makes no sense for veterans to support Trump. He’s stood idly by as Putin pays bounties for dead American soldiers. He’s blasphemed Gold Star families &amp; mocked disabled veterans. He’s driving the VA into the ground. And, Trump’s a fucking unpatriotic 5-time draft dodger.
I know whatsboutism is a losing game, but my son and I were saying tonight: imagine if Trump had said one of the things about black people that Biden says regularly.  The media would 24/7 bear Trump to a pulp.
What does supporting Donald Trump have to do with your qualifications?
Opinion | We are only beginning to suffer the consequences of Trump’s failures
Can Trump sign the $1,200 checks too?  Does Nancy realize that if this goes through she specifically stepped on the thing that would legitimately help the most people?
“You’ve got more questions?” Biden said in May. “Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”
Trump Admin lawyers are in court right now trying to strike the pre-existing condition protection from the law, dodo.
Such ignorance!  Trump and Company have no clue what provisions are in the ACA.  They are not policy guys.
Trump is so sick in the head.
Only by 50? That means 25% support Trump. Seems awfully high.
Of course he’s not worried about their legality. That’s Trump’s M.O.
Trump is a traitor that does not belong in the White House let alone allowed to stay in this country!  But I do want to him and others go to prison...I can’t wait!
Somebody needs to do something about Trump.
It’s laughable how badly he’s doing but luckily Trump is far worse 😅
This is what Trump would do if he could to his enemies.
Trump is that one person who hasn’t contributed to the group project, but nevertheless wants credit for it.
Trump LIES
Yeah but trump wants the help so.  Quandary
Breaking News: Trump invents Obamacare after spending years taking it down. What a visionary
America is waging war on Trump and the republicans!  We’ve had enough if their lies, greed, and corruption!  Vote blue straight down the ticket on 11/3/2020 and we’ll WIN our country Back!
Trump supporters are gullible and stupid!  They just eat up everything he says whether it’s true or not!  That’s very disturbing!
tRump, that's who.

Chris Cuomo asked me about Trump’s saying he would signing an executive order to “give” people pre-existing condition protections.  Here’s what I should have said: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
[in my voice] In that sense Operation Slow Mail is kind of weird, like lots of people are gonna get mad, but how does that help Trump? As  put it "this thing that used to work well now doesn't" is not what an incumebent would want to run on.
Trump never had a clue what the ACA covered or didn't cover.  Appears even his spokesmen aren't big on details.
Trump gonna go to prison!
This my friends is a damn good tweet. It needs to be a #Retweeted and #Repeated. #TrumpMustBeStopped #TrumpMustGo  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace  #TrumpIsKillingUs  #AmericaIsBeingRippedApart  Remember #WeThePeople ?????? Trump is the new Hitler happening before our very eyes. STOP.
Trump barred Epstein over a real estate deal. Not for recruiting on Mar-a-largo property.  But I m sure that Trumpers know this, which is why they refuse to talk about it.  Cowards.
Oh, dear!   The only place for this loser to go would be to trump’s cabinet!!   Probably to lead the country’s morals!    😂😂😂
😂  It is funny, you think that trying to insult people by pointing out they are angry with Trump is hilarious.   It also shows that you don't GAF about pedophiles or trafficked children, you just want to use these victims to attack politically, which is the most cowardly of all.
That's a sparse crowd for just any  place. Especially your own club. If that's Trump's, that place should be packed to the rafters. Looks like they scraped a few suckers having dinner, and some late foursomes from the bar. Sorry guys. You gotta listen to  Ouch.
You've a bunch of unprofessional whiny babies who have lost their way.  I can't wait to see who Trump picks for his next two SCOTUS picks.  I will celebrate your loss with each landmark he makes.
If it’s named for Donald Trump, the cargo hold should be searched for hookers and cocaine.
Trump is a WAP
He literally said 'If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black'.
Trump is the product of white male backlash against Obama and Hillary. Men who are so obtuse and so insecure they feel that because Trump is a white male, he somehow represents all white males and is thus inexorably representative of their identity and value as humans.
That would still be 3 million + Americans you and trump are on the road to killing!
I also don't understand why he keeps defending and wishing a pederast pimp "well".  It baffles me that Trump is so protected by his followers as he is DIRECTLY implicated in pedophilia.
Oh, I believe that as well, which is why he dies in Trump's DOJ custody and all the footage was erased after Barr visited him. Burn all the pederasts, no matter politics, that includes Trump, who was accused of raping a 13 yo girl WITH Epstein.
So Trump is using a executive order to stop himself from removing coverage for pre-existing conditions?🤔 #TrumpHasNoPlan
If the USPS is good enough for the Trump “signed” stimulus checks, it’s good enough for mail-in ballots.  #EndTheNightmare
Define irony:  President Trump trying to take credit for protecting pre-existing conditions, that were put in place by Obama, while his administration asks the Supreme Court to end pre-existing conditions by overturning Obamacare.
Uh, those with the face masks...please step to the back of the room... you're ruining  optics. He needs folk willing to risk a little #coronavirus, especially with their young kids, for the privilege of seeing their president for $350K. Is Trump worth it? Uh, no
Trump's Idiotic (and Dangerous) Response To Beirut Explosion  via    #UnfitForOffice #GrifterInChief #idiots #gop
Frankly, when has Trump told the truth? Why can’t we just assume he’s always lying (or doesn’t know what he’s talking about)?
This is truly a reflection of Trump’s America.
promised a substantial amount of capital to unseat Trump. I haven’t heard much about that. Not that anyone would need to advertise how badly this administration is doing. I can only assume he is saving his war chest to pay for the postal service to keep running.
The administration is already struggling to deliver the mail.  How is centralizing power around the Postmaster General (who got the job because he was a Trump donor) going to help get the USPS ready for an increase of vote-by-mail business this fall?
Who cares? Didn't you see trump tonight? That was an abuse of power and we should be demanding an investigation!
She has reported nothing about president trump multiple false claims he made during "white house" presser  his own golf club house national tv.
It's like Trump got a huge bingo card of every type of human and one by one is throwing a dart thru each one. His latest weaponizing of the military against peaceful protesters and letting Putin murder them... nobody is safe. Not even those required to wear a gun. Sad. #Maddow

And for the love of all that is holy, if you are planning on voting absentee and haven’t put in your application yet, apply NOW.   Think of every day you don’t have a clear voting plan executed as an endorsement of Trump, cause that’s what it is.
Hahaha. Coverage of preexisting conditions = OBAMACARE, also known as the ACA, which trump gov is suing to eliminate. You make us laugh.
I'm sure you realize that Trump is going to step in and use exec orders to give US very little of what we need but he'll play there hero and people will believe him bc we're desperate for anything right now! This is bad
When Trump says he'll defer "payroll taxes" through yearend, it effectively "defunds" Social Security. The GOP will then want to reduce benefits because they'll say SS funding is inadequate. There are better ways to give the American people a financial break during this crisis.
We the people will not be censored. Social media will continue to favor Trump because it's not in their financial interest to do otherwise. Right   ?
America is sick of Trump. America needs to get their act together and elect Joe Biden who will once again treat Canada like the best friend that they have been for over a century.  We have a moron right now who thinks Canada burned down the White House.  We can do so much better.
Whats this guys point? Trump Speaks the Truth 👇
Trump is as cosmopolitan as a 10 piece chicken nuggets with ketchup is gourmet.
The uk. But that’s because they are run by pale trump.
tRump is a lying con man  He’ll do and say anything to get re-elected  As the date gets closer  tRump will get dirtier
same for many of us... Also found out that Trump is basically saving the planet. #Itsaboutthechildren
You mean the part of Obamacare that trump is currently suing to get rid of? That part?
Lolz of course he’s lying. Anyone supporting Trump is a liar by nature. Generalization, I admit, but damn prove me wrong.
Sacrifice your lives for the economy! Sacrifice your children! Sacrifice their teachers! Sacrifice their families! You all must bleed for our god, The Market. This is the opposition to Trump’s proto-fascism. The system is all going to come apart.
I could vomit. Trump ignores Russia wanting to pay for dead American soldiers. That could be my neighbor, my son.  #RussianBountiesOnOurTroops

The thing about criticizing Biden is that nothing he’s done hasn’t already been done to the Nth degree by trump
A lot of that was the myth of electability. And I stand by this... had 2020 not been slammed by protests and a pandemic? Trump would beat Biden. The pandemic, massive BLM protests (with Americans starting to side with BLM more) &amp; the economy tanking are what pushed Biden higher.
Trump wants a white ethnostate. There’s no other reason to do this.
Faint but present and proud. The brief storm delivered a rainbow over this non-mask-wearing, Trump-banner-promoting, South Dakotan crowd and we felt the love.  ❤️❤️❤️
So maybe Trump will issue an executive order throwing out the election.
but Trump approved it anyway... which is why neither Popeo or he are saying absolutely nothing at this point #TrumpKillsUSTroops
I mean, on the one hand good that Trump has finally learned this is important (sad it took so long and so much fucking damage to the country). On the other hand, it’s already law so... has a president ever tried to sign an EO on something *already law*?
Is #MoscowMitchMcConnell intentionally screwing over the American people in a desperate effort to make #tRump look like a hero with executive action?
Something tells me a decent % of Trump supporters believe that pre-existing conditions weren’t protected until Trump’s executive order. They didn’t know that pre-existing conditions were already protected with Obamacare.
Trump campaign:  “If Trump wins, he will do all of the things he promised to do in 2016. We need four more years because we couldn’t govern for the first four years... we never learned how.  If Biden wins, however, things will be just as terrible as they are now.”
BREAKING NEWS: Trump announces that he will require all stop signs to be red.
Considering  has lawyers accompanying Kanye’s paperwork to file, that’s a big yes. Just another way Trump is working to undermine the election.
And she’s pedaling the Trump line - pure nonsense - that mail-in-voting, on a scale necessary to shield voters from the virus in this time of a pandemic, will lead to voter fraud. Simply shameful.

Trump Republicans are pretty damn racist to even do this.
Trump wants to rule the free market through fiat.  And Trumpers cheer that, with 0 irony.
Trump is trying to destroy the USPS within because he knows he is going to lose. He is trying to delay the inevitable.
I like that "twitter docs" are chiming in.  I also like how Trump fans are all about a president influencing the free markets through fiat...I am sure that you will continue believing that with Joe Biden, right?
Trump’s executive order will create a retroactive payroll tax cut. Payroll tax cuts rob Social Security of its funding and push it towards benefit cuts.   #NoPayRollTaxCut
Someone needs to say to trump “you’r fired”
If he were 20 years older, and if his cheeks weighed 20 pounds, and if his eyebrows were 'drawn' to the top of his forehead ..we could call him pelosi  ..but he didn't spew commie ideals and he didn't slur 👍  He's Donald Trump, President of the United States of America 🇺🇸 KAG
I have enjoyed how  has slowly turned Trump press conferences into FJM columns.
This was 6 weeks ago.  Trump signed an executive order to protect preexisting conditions.
Trump's EO isn't enforceable. That's what is just pathetic.

Look... you vote a guy like Trump into office and of course he's going to treat his power like a concierge service.
The Secretary of State doesn’t send out ballots, county officials do. Second, the slow delivery of mail has nothing to do with the Secretary of State or county officials, but is an exec agency. Trump’s just fired the top two officials at USPS.
I said violations of the Constitution will be rejected. Do you not realize we live in a Constitutional Republic? Have you no concept of States' Rights? Oh, man, if Trump had done that, guess who'd be screaming "Dictator!" and trying to impeach him for it?
Genius Trump. First Grande Generilisimo not taking orders from his wife. Breakthrough.

LOL! Well, then I am waiting for the uproar from Trump and his followers to go after the Bundy's, you go ahead and let me know when that happens...
Remember in C-Ville when a RW terrorist killed a woman and Trump said they were very fine people? I do.
Also guaranteed coverage alone is bullshit and will mean that a lot of people with pre existing conditions pay more for insurance than if Trump left the law alone.
So, Trump went and tried ruling via fiat. His EO is about as worthless as everything else he does.
Well - there goes tRump taking credit for a law Obama put into place!!!  Nice try little orange man...
Trump is trying to take credit for President Obama’s achievements.
We don't need Russian intel on how fucked up trump is: he opens his mouth everyday and the entire world can see it.
I like that “Half-Whit.” Trump would not approve and that makes her #1 in my book.
If Trump cared about security measures in the USPS, he'd order the Postmaster General, whom he appointed, to get things in order.  DJT promised he alone could fix things.  If the administration can't deliver mail, how can it manage far more demanding responsibilities?
This is concerning about the USPS. Another institution Trump is trying to destroy.
Can you provide one single reason to vote for Biden without mentioning Trump? I wonder
You're no Anderson Cooper, that's for sure. 😹😹😹😹
That is mind numbing. The plotting and the greed is truly unbelievable. Glad Trump has 900 Trillion in the 5 Star Trust.
In a recent article by John Wesley Reed, he argues that Christians can &amp; should vote for Trump because it's abt policy over character.  Which to me means "hey, we know he isn't a Christian, but we are getting what we want". It's all an act.

Then he said something about peaceful protests also being exempt, which sparked a lot of laughter, and then Trump looked really confused.
Someone asked a question about the lack of people wearing masks in the press conference room and there was a round of boos. Then Trump explained they're exempt because it's a political event.
That would be members of his golf club. That’s trump - keepin it classy
LOL "Trump says."    This was always the dream, that he was so unbound by rules that it somehow would benefit normal people.  Stop falling for it, he's not doing any of this.
Trump can't even stoop without falling over, he ain't gonna swoop
With Tiger pretty much shooting himself out of contention, I would like to see Haotong Li hang on and win because I'm sure it would piss off Trump. #PGAChamp
How's about answering my question?  Trump rallies are the Federal gov't encouraging people to gather in large groups w/o following safety protocol. That's a very different situation from individuals choosing to march in the street. Rallies= state action. Protests= private. See?
There should be a fleet of reporters tracking disruptions to: Prescription meds delivery Business payments delayed Mishandled critical documents like driver's licenses So that we see ALL the terrible impacts of Trump's corruption
Check the death rate and get back to me. Positive test cases don't count. Then tell me what you think Trump should be doing that he isn't already. Solutions involving violations of the Constitution will be rejected.

Is there anything you’d miss about Trump if he were to lose the election or say, you know, disappear without a trace?
Yes because close to 75% of Trump’s “followers” are bots from Russia - the same bots that interfered in the 2016 Election and got Trump elected
Great example of  point that Trump "lies like the proverbial used car salesman" that is all politicians fudge stuff but they generally want to build real relationships with voters, the press etc so don't go crazy  Trump just says whatever to "move the lemon off the lot"
I have a feeling with Trump saying that Biden is against God and who will hurt God is going to bring out his anti-Muslim bigotry with the election coming up.

Trump said he'll sign an executive order stopping the IRS from collecting the payroll tax that funds Soc Sec and Medicare.  Don't worry about it. He can't do that. He's just trying to distract from what an incompetent and narcissistic asshole he is.
There have been so many great Time covers during the Trump regime.
Trump Hat?
A silver lining to this Trump disaster is that his Presidency has exposed the weak and the strong among us. I'm not going to define who are the weak and who are the strong. You already know the answer. Do your thang on November 3rd, whatever that may be.
Dozens of Trump's Bedminster club patrons in their shorts and golf attire in the room.  Probably held more for their enjoyment than to deliver substantive news.  They even began by playing "Hail to the Chief."

No no no!  Congress must enact this, if at all.  Trump must not lower himself to Obama / Walz El Supremo behavior.

If tRump wins this fall will you stay in the US or leave for another country? Which country?
Trump can't reduce the payroll tax all by himself.
Repeal and Replace trump's executive order.
Are you joking? Not only does Obamacare already have this, but Trump supports a lawsuit that is trying get rid of this. As we speak.
Trump has no clue what's in the ACA.  He's just against it because Obama was for it.
When Trump wins I may cry tears of joy for the first time in my life! 🥳
Never Trump actually Never Drain the Swamp!
If I understand correctly, Trump just gave Americans Obamacare, which they already had

Wow... Trump must be at one of his resorts this weekend.... he had supporters in the room. They booed one reporter’s question and cheered as he left the stage.
The lineup already has me thinking of buying some tickets maybe have something to look forward to hopefully an end to the nightmare we have been living since Trump became president from COVID-19, police brutality, racism, murder, cover ups, etc it's time we have peace &amp; some fun
between the dudes at trump's golf resort and sturgis we're doing literally the opposite.
Are your referring to Pres Trump?
I recently had an MRl of my brain and they found some concerns, so tomorrow I go for some neuropsychological testing. I suspect at least part of this will involve the same test that Trump “aced”. I’m scared guys, what if I can’t remember “person, woman, man, camera, TV”?
Trump says he's issuing an executive order requiring insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions.   Can someone on his staff remind him that since 2010 that’s been the law of the land thanks to OBama’s ACA. Trump tried repeal it for years.   He is nuts
Trump Crony: “Mail delivery? We don’t need no stinkin’ mail delivery...”

Trump doesn’t believe in trials.  He should just be assumd guilty and given life imprisonment without parole or worse.
Is the collapse by design?  Trump is struggling in the polls an EO would give him the opportunity to claim he is doing for the people what congress couldn’t.
Trump pronounces the "t"
I saw lots of the state’s mandate being blatantly violated by club members a d blatantly not enforced by club owner (trump)
God help us if one debate or even three convince enough people to re-elect Trump. It’s been a disaster by any measure.
Is something HUGE about to happen that caused trump to create such a bizarre distraction?
Agree or disagree with Trump... He throws out curveballs, ad-libs and one-liners that make it impossible to turn away from his pressers. You can’t predict him.
So basically, many of the things that POTUS refused to comcede to Democrats in negotiations, Trump is unilaterally imposing.

I dunno if you meant to tag me in this or not. I'm a democrat. I'm not a huge fan of Biden. I feel like Biden was really the LEAST we could do when it comes to progressive candidates, so I as a Dem really am kinda like whatever. I think its more interesting for no trump repubs.
So it's Russia vs China/Iran over who leads our country. 😕  U.S. intel: Russia trying to hurt Biden, but China, Iran don't want Trump
The election will take place largely through the mail, so Trump has suddenly moved to take control of the mail. Dictator stuff.
Trump blathers a lot so I don't know if this matters....but it could matter (if the Trump Admin dropped their lawsuit about taking away people's health care that would be a big deal!)

You should be asking why the democrats are using republican dark money groups like the Lincoln project to attack trump while they capitulate with every demand from the trump administration. You are being gaslit by friendly fascism.
POTUS Trump holding Friday night 7:30p ET presser.  Ok, I’ll switch from the Truck race for this.
Meadows blocked all of this so that Trump could grandstand on orders that may not even be able to take effect. Oh. And somehow the Tennessee Valley Authority worked it’s way into this mess too.
Trump just stated once again that half of American counties had less than 20 cases last week. There are counties in Minnesota that probably only have 20 people.
I will donate $100,000 to the NRA and $100,000 to the NAACP if someone can get Trump  and Pence buddied up on The Amazing Race.

Trump has succeded at making us a sh*thole county.
Cult of personality.  Trump's supporters aren't listening, evaluating, considering alternatives, etc., the way you and I might form an opinion.  That's why arguments, charts, statistics, and facts won't sway them.  He's their guy and that's all there is to that.
I’d be willing to bet 9/10 the person against the mask is a Trump supporter.
One NY county had 85k votes not counted in June primary (all mail in voting).  Margin of victory for trump in2016:  WI 23k, PA 44k, MI 11k.  You need to reconsider how we could possibly consider mass mailings voting this election cycle.  Nowhere near ready for that as a country.
This is absolute madness. 160,000 Americans are dead. More than a thousand Americans are dying everyday. Trump can’t even fiddle, just a cocktail hour as America burns.

For me, it’s day four waiting for covid test results, no word yet. Trump has slowed down the testing, that is his plan.  If we base school openings on Covid test results, and the test results take a week or longer:   Then it is Not responsible to send your kids to school.
I read this as “pool” having a totally different meaning and thought “thank goodness. 2020 can’t handle Trump by the pool.”
I've listened to his speeches after they were chopped up, then the originals. He talks just fine &amp; much better than tRump. 😼😼😷
We will be in the streets under the Democrats just as hard as the right. Liberals are  a far right party run by the same money that put trump in office.  Friendly fascism is here and we must resist it at all costs.
And the level of irony of Trump challenging anyone’s faith in anyone or any being.  He didn’t know what a Bible was before he ran on the Christian Right.

Actually if your fans of cop's and Trump you are the one with low IQ since that batch of people have literally no brain's or education and like Trump they pay to have other's take tests for them in order for them to pass get some other people to look up too LoL 😂
So he issued an order that doesn’t have any teeth because nobody knows what’s in it, and he’s complaining about ads nobody’s seen because they don’t exist? This is peak Trump.
...need to dump Trump, and the GOP from top to bottom. 88 days...
The reason Republicans don’t like Trump is because he makes them look like Democrats.
Trump has pumped so much money into cooperations  they don't need it anymore , I'm in banking so I know, they still have billions left from the first Stimulus ,that money should go to States ASAP to help those in need, this is bullshit, there I said it'

If you don't want to vote for Joe Biden over Donald Trump because of any reason that starts with the phrase "Both parties", then you've never understood the difference between a steak dinner and a bowl of maggot-flavored cyanide.
Because the alternative is Trump. That's it. That's my entire answer.
I find that I cannot even listen to a report of what Trump said in his last mindless, ranting, speech. If this keeps up, I will have to leave the country to stay sane.

Trump will either run out of excuses in 4 yrs and change, or just die from old age.   Either way, the US must have nothing less than punitive, retributive justice on every single collaborator and traitor involved in his crimes.  Make room in Supermax and Leavenworth.
calling it the Trump Republican Party says it all. Pull your head out of his ass.
That entire joke of a university is as fake as Trump’s was, right out of the Handmaid’s Tale mindset. Fire him, disband the school, send the kids to a real one. When it’s safe to do so.
If Trump wants more help. I know a few patriots. They will call Raytheon.
Amazingly, just received an "executive member" card from the Trump campaign, addressed to to an apartment number at our single family home (huh?) for someone who has never lived here. Top notch operating they are running.

Most likely true but Trump is currently at the resolute desk

Appparently the running theory on Twitter is that China wants Trump to lose, that’s why he wants TikTok banned. It’s WAY more complicated than that.
This should make Trump and the gang proud, what other Country can boasts they have 5 millions confirmed Covid cases,  Latest coronavirus updates
Well, I don’t love either; however, at least Biden actually has a solid written plan on issues such as LGBTQ rights, Climate Change, and improving health care to some degree. When we equate Biden with Trump, we accept them as equals, when one is clearly better.
In the wake of the Jerry Falwell Jr. news: every student journalist should read this article about what Liberty's student paper has become under his reign. (i've shared this before but it's a reminder of how important independent student news is!!!)
Trump is A un-fit miss-fit for the office of Pres, of the United States, he's A traitors who's only interested in his own personals gains. he knows the Russians R on their way,  Drakicus has shared content with you from MSN
Trying to convince the U.S. that Biden is too old and racist but also a Communist since '78 and a Trojan horse for the social justice left is hilarious... while offering that Biden is more consistent than Dem-to-Republican-to-Reform-to-Dem-to-indie-to-Republican President Trump.
Apparently, he continues to try to legislate through executive order, although he hasn't published it so who knows what is says...
"The media entered into a fragile agreement not to publish the infamous Steele dossier. Buzzfeed broke the agreement which ended the anti-Trump whisper campaign as the Steele fairytale could be subjected to the disinfecting sunlight of public scrutiny.”

should ask Trump if he’s seen the new cover of Time, that he’s on it. Then show him when he’s all excited. 😈
Sorry, we need that money to renovate the White House and protect Trump hotels from competition.
I'm trying to remember which trump advisor wrote the article that said, "Democracy was a threat to the Capitalism." I can't remember the specifics and was trying to find it.
This is what conservatives do they really despise our troops they really despise Americans that are anything less than millionaires  We watched them cheer as Trump denigrated a Vietnam POW who Republicans had previously held up and praised but I guess that was just to get votes
When Trump is asked why he should be reelected, the best answer is “without me and my team, there’d be no humor left”. 😂😂
Falwell Jr subscribes to the Donald Trump school of graft and embezzlement. They’ll do time together soon enough at a Federal prison camp. Cell mates.

Where did Trump get his degree from again?
Paul Krugman says he’s done the math — and the risk Trump and McConnell pose to the economy is ‘terrifying’
And not one word from Trump on what he plans to do about this! He’s swept it under the rug hoping we will forget. Just like he does with all of his corruption, gaslighting!
Major fail on the republicans and Trump!  We know how they do things...the wrong way for the wrong reasons!  I hope people get relief that need it but Trump nor the republicans will get the credit!
Because he has control over Trump
What people need and want is to see the candidates in a live debate but  won't do it.  Why not start having these debates and let the candidates present their platform in person and also debate each other?  Dean have called the Joe Biden camp to request he debate Trump?
Nothing!  Trump has no idea what being a Christian means!  He has no idea who Jesus is and even God which is sad!  There are a lot of people who follow Trump, call themselves Christians but yet have no idea who Jesus is and what the word of the Bible says!

Uninformed.  That tweet went right over your head.  Ya see, the fbi wanted, and were approved to move to a new location. Trump stopped that.  Result? A hotel developer couldn’t by the vacate spot they were in, and compete with don.  Genius right? So spend to refurb - same result.

Covid was Trump’s fault?
The congress should have known in December or January, Trump should have done some thing in February.. then they throw Jerod kushner a bone in March and april rather than someone like Fauci... and Kushner becomes a bilionaire selling 3,000$ vacines and test kits until 2022

Well, Im thinking they don’t want to play with Trump’s balls.  And is also why Trump now hopes to blame China for HIS failures and ignorance.  When Trump needs a fall guy whether it be USIC, the Generals or a foreign adversary or foe, Trump will find him whether any truth or not.

Nothing had to be this bad it's amazing how Trump was able to put us on course to destination f***** at all these different level  It's amazing he could screw everything up far worse than anyone else who tried to do it on purpose
No surprise here. The Russians hate NATO and the Chinese hate Trump. The Russians fear a return of the pro-Trump foreign policy establishment while the Chinese long for it. . .
It seems likely. However, trump* will have ample opportunity to be trump* between now and Nov. It's not like he's suddenly going to be competent. Or coherent.

Because he’s crazy off the charts. Not for the very reason Russia want Dictator Trump in. That Russia controls a Trump.
The question you should be asking is, "what does the market see that the rest of us do not". Investors are are enthused by the possibility of a regime change in the US. Removal of uncertainty creates a more hospitable business environment. The market has priced in Trump's defeat.
The people who hate Trump would vote for this.
When Trump refer to the silent majority, that's who the little big man is referring to Russia,

It also provides an option for Trump to accuse China of having stolen the election in November. He could ratchet up tensions even more and create chaos during the transition period.
I have an idea. Let’s let all Chinese citizens and all Russian citizens vote this November. It’s the only way tRUmp is going to get more than 60 million votes.
why did you stop referring to President Trump as impeached President Trump?    Did you polling tell you that was a loser?

It remains wild that the Trump Administration position is to *limit* relief in the run up to an election.
This year is going to be crazy because of all of the mail in voting. The expectation is that they won’t know a winner for several days after the election. Trump will be tweeting the ENTIRE time.
The people who need help will get it and the courts will rightfully remove the power of Trump to act unilaterally but by then there will likely be a vaccine or at least a viable antibody treatment.
This also assumes accurate polling with equal amounts Dem and Rep respondents. Also assumes that conservatives would truly admit to voting for Trump which most won’t.
Sure, but Schumer is literally holding things up to get the SALT deduction limit removed (which only helps the richest)! I hope Trump does somehow do all this through executive action and it takes 6 months or a year to go through the courts which strike him down.

Trump is a socialist for the rich. If you are not in the top 5% you are being used by the GOP. If you have any concerns of racism you can’t vote GOP and think it’s somehow better than an out of touch Centrist boomer. A vote for Trump is a betrayal to America.

My apologies for making the obvious statement...Can you imagine if President Trump was just 50% of what Biden is doing &amp; saying? The media would be all over this and yet nothing is being said for a man who clearly has something wrong!
I don’t think we’ll ever return to normal &amp;in some ways (more appreciation for restaurant waitstaff, grocery workers, teachers &amp;presidents who aren’t trump) that’s a good thing.  However, w/ all the damage of the last 4yrs, we’ll have to work v hard to return to a better place.

I live in a magazine and it has more character than this...this is just wrong.  It’s like Trump died and Ivanka decided to strip out the 1980s brass and redo things “her way”
If Trump is your idea of a cosmopolitan, you have led an extremely boring life in a 6’ x 6’ white box, only eating Miracle Whip and baloney on Wonder Bread with an occasional dollop of Cheez Whiz for spice. He might be a billionaire if you are converting dollars to yen.

Parody. The sad, sick joke on America that is the Trump admin.
Can’t wait till November 3 and President Trump wins again
Trump cult. No one ever said they were a classy bunch and def not the smartest people. I still think they have Neanderthal brains and never evolved with the rest of us. Lol
Trump campaign garbage all made in China. Building  materials  for golf clubs. Purchased  from China. So what are you saying?
Trump is a Communist. He hates your democracy. America's Communist Dictator. One Party rule.
Trump is Satan.
Bingo, you just described Trump. Running a failing business, that’s his m.o. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

I disagree 100% with this meme. Barr would be Curly, McConnell would DEFINITELY be Moe. Trump would be...Shemp. Maybe Joe.

Thank God for President Trump who always puts America first
Because they are all week in comparison to President Trump
Remember Lindsey, they weren’t all-powerfull when it first started, but pretty well went to hell  quickly, kinda like what you’re promoting here with Trump.
who is left with tRump: Putin and the Russians, the Kool aid drinkers and the people of verndale and the ship is sinking folks and tRump will dress as a lady to get in the lifeboat.
what is your evidence for that, maybe a few die hard Bernie bros, but most left leaning (I for one) and far left folks I know despise tRump and the cancer removed. What is your reasoning for saying that.
Trump is right, no one can control a virus from spreading. Viruses spread and always have. No one can stop that. The fact that people blame a president for a virus spreading is absolutely ridiculous. Plus these people are dying from pneumonia not COVID.
Had a dream that I couldn’t find the office for my therapy appt with Beyoncé and ended up on a rubber water raft ride with a bunch of Trump supporters and all I can say is WTF, life. W.t.f.
Let me guess... Ann “If Trump wouldn’t have insisted on this stupid wall a man wouldn’t have died” “If Trump hadn’t made the wall so big a man would be alive today” “Trump says he’s pro life-obviously not” “Trumps a racist-of course a migrant fell of the stupid wall” Etc etc🤣
Where are all the disenchanted former pro-Trump republicans? If anyone could make an impression on the current card-carrying fascists, it would be the ones who used to be like them until Trump's irresponsibility destroyed their lives. We need to start hearing from them folks!

My favorite line from the piece: “This, by the way, isn’t written out of any concern that Donald Trump will prevail over Joe Biden in the debates; Mr. Biden has done just fine in a long string of such contests.” Sure.

It took Donald Trump for me to be embarrassed to be an American.
Trump will lose in November. And he will die in prison.
Too funny, but Trump does get blamed for everything.
Ugh except Trump will end up the new Robert E. Lee

That’s because the Trump cult is a bubble.
There's 65 million and that number is growing  daily that know  our enemy  is trump.
The longer he waits, the longer Trump doesn't have a sentient person to run against
This is for all the Trump cultists out there. Are you prepared to answer to god when he asks you why you liked this horrible human being? He still has an open trial going with him and Epstein raping a 13 year old with a witness.
Anyone who says Trump is an analytical person who’s good with the data is obviously lying.
Trump said Friday the Chinese-owned video app TikTok will be banned in the U.S., which he said he can do through emergency economic powers or an executive order.
“Trump keeps promising [abc...xyz] that never arrives.” &lt;== It’s called being conned, folks and the one thing people hate more than being conned — is admitting they’ve been conned. It’s what keeps the con going.
Thank God for President Trump!!!
At least it's distracted for awhile. Dreaming  of the mighty trump Space force, playing space man with a gold fish bowl over his swollen  head.
You have a hell of a nerve asking Speaker Pelosi about a plan for testing! You have been nearly silent about telling a Trump to get a testing plan. You are simply a SOB who needs to leave in November. #RepublicansAreTheProblem
Well, Trump is in the White House making real decisions while you can’t even figure out who you’re talking to or what day it is, so... There’s that.
lmao WHAT  Even for the mentally handicapped Trump / COVID conspiracy theory crowd, that's a low-effort claim
This is a throughly stupid tweet even for a Trump.  Whose child are u writing off?
Thank God for President Trump who always puts the American people first
I feel like when Trump talks about God and the Bible etc., that it could be for “show”, I don’t sense any real passion about it. However if I end up being wrong about that I am very sorry! I’m just telling it like I see it. But only God knows the man’s heart!
Private school attended by Barron Trump prohibited from in-person learning until October as President pushes openings - CNNPolitics
And way to deflect from the fact that Dershowitz is a Trump ally. He’s not a real Democrat.
I’m referring to Trump Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta.
It’s not better though because Trump likely knew about it before he hired him. At least, he should’ve, if his administration was competent.
94 days my friends....we can through the vote end this 3 plus year nightmare, but it must be a landslide. in 2016, 2/3 of eligible voters did not vote and by doing so voted for tRump. vote like your life depends on it: it clearly does!
Ah, the old “checking for corruption” excuse. Ignoring the fact that the DoD has already determined that Zelensky and Ukraine had made sufficient anti-corruption progress before Trump withheld the aid in the first place.
Those  trump supporters are a crazy bunch.
a non vote is a vote for tRump, 2/3 of eligible voters made the choice you are making.
Only because Trump got caught.
Other countries WERE helping Ukraine. The EU gave Ukraine most of its foreign aid.  Again, all of the excuses Trump gave are easily debunked. Pay attention.
August 12- whistleblower complaint filed  September 9- Schiff and Nunes are told of the complaint  Also September 9- House committees launch probes into Trump’s actions   September 11- aid finally released
Let’s all prank call Trump hotels and say, “asshole!” Or like a Stormy joke.   Like, “hey I was wondering how the weather is going to be when I’ll be in town, do you know if it’s supposed to be Stormy?”  Or ask for some orange skin cream or soemthing.

So just like Trump then.
Nope, a Trump appointee, who did this before Obama was even President.  Next time, do some basic research before replying.
And actually, he didn’t even need the dirt. All he wanted was the announcement of an investigation because he knew that’d be enough to hurt Biden.  Which is why Zelensky was ready to make that announcement until Trump got caught and was forced to release the aid.
Trump 2020, is the only answer to a strong America
Gee, Linda, thanks for your input.  We’re all well aware of that. But that makes it even worse for Trump.  He happily hired the guy who let Epstein off.
Thank God for President Trump who always puts America first
Fucking hilarious. How about you fuckers redirect yours into mine. Thanks to Trump, I have almost nothing left
Nice deflection! Let me try.  At least Obama never laughed about the Benghazi attack.
As soon as the PUBLIC found out, he was out the door. Gotta save face. Any competent administration would've known about it already. Especially one headed by a man who used to have ties to Epstein himself.  There's no way to make Trump not look bad here.
Well he later became a Trump official, so corruption is pretty likely.
I wish a former member of Trump's administration had spent less time giving Epstein the easiest deal ever to essentially get out of his last conviction.
The evidence in Trump’s Ukraine scandal was clear and overwhelming.  Every excuse he gave was shot down immediately.
That's the only chance the Dems have at beating Trump in November. Disgusting
Omg, I accidentally watched FOX news on YouTube and now I’m traumatized. They really don’t know how to recognize false news. They keep coddling trump 🤢
facing our country, we also understand that we must come together in order to defeat Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history.  “Though the end result is not what I or my supporters would have written alone, the task forces have created a good policy

If he did catch the virus at Trump’s rally, then yes. Trump definitely shares some of the blame for holding a rally like that in the middle of a pandemic. It was a dumb thing to do, and we all knew people would likely die from it.
if we can have an election in the middle of a civil war (1864) and the world war (1944) and a Cold War (1968) then we can have an election during a pandemic (covid-19) and a national cancer (tRump) (11/3/20)
Thank God for President Trump
Trump's Tulsa Death March took Herman Cain...
Voting by mail is good enough for him and most of the people in his administration, but when he is getting trounced in the polls it is suddenly a crisis requiring a delay? The only way he can be more openly fascist is to literally burn down the House.
“Delay the election” - Trump
Trump made his suggestion during a series of tweets in which he again protested proposals to allow mail-in voting, saying that system is too vulnerable to fraud.Hell hath no fury like a President scorned. I smell lawsuits, rage tweeting, "rigged election"'..blah blah blah. Trump will be like a child throwing one long ego filled tantrum.
Funny so calling a true #ResistanceUnited member a karen because I can't buy there #GreenParty  thing. I believe in reality. Reality is we need to remove trump. Dream of the green thing in the future. But for now lets get our country back first. VoteTheRedOut. Simple as that.
We could work backwards on Trump's failures, but COVID is the most acutely dangerous, so serious people are focused on that.
Then Trump should go to church and pray.
This is already in the ACA you dolt. Thanks to Obama. Pssst...tell your peeps. Trump just endorsed the law. SMDH
People are pissing me off big time. Green party Bernie bros Kon man west Pull your head out of trump and Putin's ass. Give it a god damn rest a be Americans. Your weak bullshit is a copout.
Since when aren't masks recommended at a protest? Trump is again going against the recommendations. SMDH
It’s laughable how badly he’s doing but luckily Trump is far worse 😅

With his big mouth Not a chance, I would give Putin a week tops before trump was introduced to a balcony or bridge
What is with the "audience" at Trump's country club press conference? Millions are unemployed and facing homelessness and Trump is at his COUNTRY CLUB! WTAF? Can he be any more elitist? Why isn't he in DC fighting for Americans? #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
One NY county had 85k votes not counted in June primary (all mail in voting).  Margin of victory for trump in2016:  WI 23k, PA 44k, MI 11k.  You need to reconsider how we could possibly consider mass mailings voting this election cycle.  Nowhere near ready for that as a country.
The Dems had a bill in MAY sitting on McConnell's desk!! The GOP waited until the F'ing last minute to debate?? Dems want money for Americans and the GOP want money for a new FBI building to help Trump's hotel across the street. WTAF?
That entire joke of a university is as fake as Trump’s was, right out of the Handmaid’s Tale mindset. Fire him, disband the school, send the kids to a real one. When it’s safe to do so.
Trump is going to be a favorite with the other inmates They will pass him around every night
Sorry, we need that money to renovate the White House and protect Trump hotels from competition.
Indeed Trump has a bunch of little sheep heading up all the intel agencies that have been raising the red flags over the months and years that putin loves trump Congress was updated in the past week that putin is hard at work Even today trump's own intel put out a warning idiots
There blood on the Trump family’s hands
It wasn't Trump.  It was his CAMPAIGN.  THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. Do you think we're all dumb?
And the Trump enablers need to be ousted.
There are over 160K Americans dead, millions unemployed, we have an economy worse than the great depression and this is ALL under Trump's Administration.  Based on his words and actions, He's clueless to what Americans need. It's all about him! I'm done. #Biden2020
Trump only pretends to be a Christian.
How many of Trump Enviromental Regulation Roll backs with cause the River to Catch Fire, AGAIN?
Trump does not need Media Platform. He can say stupid shit and the National News Corps will cover it.
I don't think that trip to Ohio is going to give him the boost he expected given the unhinged rant he unleashed against Joe Biden's faith and his ludicrous misunderstanding of how the constitution is amended. This man HAS no God but money.
I agree. I never go after unless they say terrible things about BIDEN. BIDEN is a devout Catholic. I am too. trump isn’t even Christian
Trump just can't tell the truth about anything. Just another example.
It’s not Biden it is trump and the trumpthugs
trump has a huge following saying he is god.  I have to fight. Blasphemy’s
I would but trumpthugs just said BIDEN will hurt God. Fake evangelists say trump is god. They started it
We would not of lost jobs if trump would have been a decent human. He has caused the worst economy since the depression. The Feds not trump are currently holding up the stock market. Not trump. He hates the Feds. Complains about them all the time.   He has created no new jobs
We actually are. Trump and his party have, no surprise, prioritized money over human lives. But they've been doing that since Reagan. It's enough to make anyone with a soul cry.
The Russians have had bounties on our military and once again trump says a hoax. Why hasn’t he gone after Tussia about this???
I cannot wait to see how many people show up for BIDEN than trump
Given that it is the most sophisticated ever, like nothing we've seen before, how long will it be until Trump takes credit for this too.
I'm just wondering now that Trump is banning TikTok and having White House staff rewrite COVID statistics when he'll begin banning modeling. Because this is terrifying and likely to get worse the more schools he forces to open.
Trump is singing this tune, not knowing a thing about how the Constitution gets amended since he's never read it and doesn't follow it. He and his party should go down with the  faster than the Titanic.
Any write in vote is a vote for Trump. Is that what you want?
Once again Trump is doing a touchdown dance over a jobs number that is the equivalent of scoring in the forth quarter when you are down by 40 points
I appreciate what they're doing, but I never, ever, lose sight of that fact. When Trump is gone, we'll be on opposite sides of what the country needs. Again. But for those who've undergone a true conversion and realize they've been wrong since Reagan. That number's not large.
Trump has done his best to destroy my country, and everyday it gets worse.
Trump and his parasites are sitting up and saying. Huh!!!
Please stop saying "added jobs", these are readded jobs, people going back to work, not brand new off the shelf, never seen before jobs. Saying the jobs were added allows Trump to claim credit. He did NOT create jobs.
And how is that Trump vote working out for you?
Like we have now. Although I believe trump is broke
After yesterday's statements Dumpy Donald Trump is no longer worthy of ANY believer in any faith tradition. After this year's performance, Dumpy is no longer worthy of the vote of anyone in America having ruined the economy, botched the pandemic and killed 160,000 of us.
I wish they'd stop saying "added jobs", these are readded jobs, people going back to work, not brand new off the shelf, never seen before jobs. Saying the jobs were added gives Trump the chance to claim credit. It's not his work that did this. At all.
trump and dunce are so far below the curve for leadership. Our country is in peril. Neither can figure out what to do to stop the insanity
Well I always ask how they feel about trump before the date. So far so good very few like trump
Trump should implement a draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters run to Canada.  😂😂
Apparently Trump is slightly smarter than Dinesh.
This sounds like a parody of what someone who is super far up Trump's ass would say.
You know, I agree. Trump has devolved beyond any point of reason. He won’t debate, he’ll filibuster just like he does at rallies and press conferences. He won’t answer questions, he’ll just lie. Joe will win anyway, nothing to gain in a debate.
was brilliant tonight. Trump’s classifying his violation of the Hatch Act, another crime. Then the crass theft of $64 million by NRA officials and the suit to dissolve them. When we talk about equity in wealth distribution, these are reasons why. Grifters gonna grift. 😡
Trump's narrative is the most racist,  ignorant and selfish I have ever heard. He has NEVER apologized for anything. You're character will speak for itself.  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

Your late show Trump bashing is sick, divisive, hatefull, disrespectful and treasonous.  Get a real job.
Why on Gods green earth would I trust trump with anything??
This will not hurt BIDEN. you assume all black people will follow you you assume black people are stupid. You underestimate the Black Community. They know what it is going to take to take down trump
Watch trump try to do this anyway. I am not sure she would do this. She cannot be that dumb. It could ruin any future she might have
While Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans abrogate their constitutional responsibility and sit on the sidelines waiting for Trump to tell them what to do
He faked it to get out of meeting with Trump.
Some of the putin useful idiot replies is hilarious  Last week the house was updated about the Russians and the election This week the senate was updated of what Putin is up to This was all mostly classified. But in resent months and years the TRUMP admin Intel reports its true

Y'all are going to go down with the Trump ship if you keep this up.  Y'all know that, right?

Trump Loves Russian Money
She posed nude abd landed on here. Not the behavior of a First Lady. Let’s face it trump et al have no class and never will
Wrong.  Trump could not have done so much damage, without the  enablers.
Trump has no shame.   A Christian he will never be.
Furthermore when Trump was here, estimates were that at least 20% of the crowd was registered Democrats. The only way Democrat’s win this time is a very significant increase in voter tourn out that goes unmatched by the right.
The thing about this is, it’s nearly impossible that Trump does not have at least the same level of support he had 4 years ago. Factor ipeople here were afraid of him and didn’t vote/voted 3rd party/wrote in.. Some are all in now. Then the D hard left turn.. It’s at least 50/50.
Talk about grasping for straws???  Only losers follow trump

Trump will say "I've created the best vaccine. Better vaccine than anyone has ever imagined.  Scientists are amazed that I was able to develop it so quickly.  Quicker than anyone ever in the history of vaccines.  It's a great vaccine.  Tremendous vaccine. Will be a huge success!
Okay it's a correction, but just for a second, I was laughing like crazy, because if anyone deserves Twitmo or a permanent ban it's Trump. Maybe after he's kicked out of D.C. One can dream. Or at least one can if white and not in danger of deportation.
That's Trump's response to every investigation into his illegalities. Witch Hunt. Well, it should be Warlock hunt, but I won't quibble with that. I will though object to his getting away with anything he's done, including the information  presented last night. Damning info
Now do Germany, France and the UK.  Please also address Trump's Slamming of NATO
Gov. Dewine COVID-19 positive. Another close call for trump. It is getting closer and closer. How long can trump keep dodging this virus?  I don't see Donny as a Good Hand Hygiene practitioner.
You can't talk about obstruction. The Heroes Act is what we need. Pass that. You've already said you will obstruct everything if the Senate remains in your control. You're as big a hypocrite as Trump. Remember Merrick Garland? I do. That's what obstruction is, you dolt.
They didn't silence Trump. They silenced the CAMPAIGN.  Honest mistake on your part, Matty, since all he knows how to do is campaign.
it seems Putin will have to be use facebook more as his investment payment service towards trump campaign. More rubbles that Mark Zuckerberg will deny was even on the books. #NRA is under the microscope She gave a hint of possible criminal charges as well, false info to IRS &amp; AG
Donald Trump openly uses “official” White House events for campaigning – meaning that if you pay federal taxes, you are helping him get reelected  via
But he's trying to do a Jill Stein move in the swing states. Pull enough votes away from Biden so Trump can chat and win. This is a farce and Mr West is a pawn in Trump's twisted plan to cheat. If he gets on ballots, this thing could get legs. We have to pay attention.
Do you think it will ever dawn on them that they got played by that tweet about moving the election?  Trump pulls that like he’s playing reverse psychology with a 4 year old and they keep taking the bait.
I can't speak for anyone else, but I can tell you Trump and his party are people I have opposed my entire life. I spent 45 years in public service. I saw systemic racism, generational poverty up close. I believe all people are created equal. Trump is not that. That's why, for me.
This is the equivalent of Bugs Bunny certifying Wile E. Coyote as cognitively advanced and has just as much meaning. Sad when doctors sell their souls. Guessing this guy was NOT at the top of his class.

Why am I *not* surprised that Cheater-in-Chief tRump endorses this piece of hypocritical misogynistic dick cheese...ugh.
failed our nation. But we will not fail as a nation. We have weathered many storms and may encounter more. The storms trump has created will pass and we will be stronger because of it. But we will never forgive or forget. #mkdreads
I guess they didn’t learn from this gem.
What a glorious thing it would be. Trump getting schooled. They will show him so much love on that schoolyard. Yah think?
Trump has always and consistently viewed himself as above the law.
trump has never been to our Federal Lands or Federal parks
You're delusional.  This is a Trump stunt. And you ask who TF I am? I'm an American who has eyes wide open to the Trump corruption train.
I suppose the Trump kids could be put in cuffs first... Then wait for DonTheCon later
Of all the monstrous things Trump has done, spreading the lie that children are immune from Covid-19 infections for potential electoral gain is probably the worst and something I’m convinced history will be a harsh judge of.
trump. I pray everyday for God to take trump away. So far God has said I am working on it
Apparently young black voters. He can take enough voters away from Biden to help Trump in swing states.  The cheating is beyond anything I could make up in my worst nightmares.
Well OBAMA and BIDEN NEVER HID IN THE White House bunkers. Baby trump!!!
I have an adorable Havanese I will register. trump is a loser
Couldn’t hurt. trump will follow him around the stage and hatred NIDEN
I want them to debate. It will only show Americans how unfit Trump is for office.  Trump can't answer a question intelligently. If the Axios interview is any indication...I would love to see Trump publicly fall on his face.
This is your America Mr Trump and you have failed miserably!
Trump is doing #anythingtowin. How can the US accept the results of the election when all he is doing is cheating? Now the Kanye West curveball. Don't fall for it people.  A vote for anyone other than Biden, helps Trump. #cheaterinchief

Trump is going to lose...bigly!

The Donald John Trump school of spelling and pronunciation.
This guys crazier than trump
Easy and actionable, in rapid fashion. Responsibly done, these are all great ideas. We CAN make America great again, we need to after what the republicans and Trump have done to it.
That was an atrocious interview, he showed his true colors throughout. I'm betting heads will roll over allowing him to actually do it. He won't take responsibility, he never does, but he'll have to blame someone. We'll blame him.
Adding to the rapidly growing evidence that support from  is really a kiss of death to candidates. This pretend president has no coat tails. So, republicans are distancing themselves but it won't work. We see what they've done. We see them.
Trump is picking tiny points from her testimony and declaring that ALL he did was just fine. Declaring victory and  that what happened was the crime of the century. Of course, this means he is watching tv again instead of governing, but that's par for his course. Liar in chief.
Then tell Trump to stop lying.
Who wrote this for you??  trump does not have the brains. We liberal cities believe in freedom of speech and news. Republicans believe we should invade states and that the news , all if it, should be silenced
Absolutely. Would never trust trump
Trump will try to force kids back to school physically, cut Covid testing resources, hide Covid data, and destroy the USPS—he has a single goal of re-election and no one and nothing else matters.
Kanye West isn't a serious candidate for President. He's a novelty candidate designed to siphon votes of the young, casual, uninformed, &amp; first time voters. A vote for him is a vote for Trump. The republicans &amp; Trump are counting on that. Don't get conned again America.
159,000 + DEAD. Trump has a Desth Cult.
Send it back and say it is what is just like tRUmp
“It is what it is.” Donald Trump is a Moronic Lying Racist Mentally Ill Criminal. “It is what it is.”
When Trump says someone has 0 credibility, that persons credibility automatically jumps a couple scores
Opinion: When it comes to literal life and death national security issues, Trump continues to cling to a transparent and jaded ignorance-is-bliss card. What he fails to realize is that he's just broadcasting his own gross negligence.
Deaths are at the hands of the state governors.  Trump has no power to shut anything down at state level.
Trump trashes Obama's Lewis eulogy that pressed for voting rights
Watch President Trump's Axios interview.  Have fun.
Trump will be laughed out of court with his claims. What a buffoon!
Trump literal Covid-19 Plan is to seal himself in a testing bubble, play golf, blame others, and wish it away.
Ya'll know Trump is a Liar, right?
This RD must be a parody.  No one could be this dumb and not be Donald Trump
Just in case y’all forget, FUCK DONALD TRUMP, and if you support him go fuck yourself
So many Trump people in my orbit are OBSESSED with child trafficking and pedophilia, and they think Trump is also the Second Coming, but when they see this it’s like it never happened. This makes my brain hurt.
No thanks. We love President Trump.  You can go away, however.
WOW! Watch the full "Axios on HBO" interview with President Trump - Axios
So let me get this straight..Trump is stopping the census count early so he will have the numbers by end of year? The census work is behind due to COVID and the most difficult people to count (homeless, transient etc) won't be counted and thus won't be represented for a decade!
Opinion: The plague of Donald Trump /via
At this point Trump will probably refuse to do any debates, then put out ads saying Biden didn't want debates.
Trump either maintains real fantasies about being president for life or thinks it's funny to troll that he would try to violate the Constitution.  Both are disgusting and beneath his office.  He's truly the most vile person to serve as president.
You'll need a lot of room for mass incarnation after The Trump administration is out of office!
Trump's health plan did pass?
Trump's like a grade schooler trying to BS his teacher on his failure to pass a test by trying to change reality
I was around back then Mr Trump and your no Lyndon Johnson when it comes to civil rights sir!
What has trump done for these people??  what has trump done for Puerto Rico??  narcissistic jerk has no feelings for all the suffering going on
Yes Iam sure that when people look back at the Trump presidency that's the first thing that well come to everyone's minds what a great civil rights leader he was! And after they've all stopped laughing they'll think of all his other failures and criminal acts!
You're doing the same thing Trump does trying to turn reality around by lies to fit your agenda your the one who have kept the American people waiting while slashing aid to the American people who desperately need it to survive while you and the Republican Senate went on recess
I am aware of the amount. If trump stops the money coming in like he is talking about. There will be no more SS
trump was also losing in Kentucky until now
One of Facebook's official third-party fact checkers is sending fundraising emails for Trump:
Per capita in the USA there are more dems than Repubs. Not sure about Florida. The fact that trump wanted the elderly to sacrifice their lives for the economy might be a sticking stone for trump.
Trump Hangs out with A Sex child trafficker. Let that sink in.
He couldn’t do worse than trump. I wonder if trump will follow Biden all over the stage. I for one would be cheering for him to fall
If you think trump will grandfather anything you are nuts. Good luck with trying to eliminate ss.  Everyone is paying in and that is what refills the pots. No refill no pay out
hope you are right. I think there are traps. Even if Trump does expose that Joe is senile which he undoubtedly will, there’s going to be a fine line between beating him politically vs abusing a feeble old man. We can run ads to show the senility. Bad risk/reward ratio.
Im not sure. Biden has nothing to lose. Trump does. It’s like a #1 college football team playing a trap game. No upside. #1 team wins, they didn’t prove anything. Bad team scores, does well, God forbid wins, then the sky is falling. Add moderators. Spin. Newscycle. Not worth it.
Completely agree and trump will go nuts
A reminder that the Trump Administration is evading the Constitution by the widespread use of acting officials because they are so terrible they cannot even be confirmed by a REPUBLICAN-controlled senate
Published reports said that Kolomoisky had refused to set up a meeting with President Donald Trump’s ally Rudy Giuliani and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in an attempt to dig up dirt against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden last year.
I hate Trump, but that was mistaken context because of them talking over each other.
I can no longer read Yosemite with out hearing it the way trump pronounced it yo-semITE.
Well, there's a first for everything. She's right about this, only Trump could have done this as badly as he has.
This is one of the reasons John Oliver continues to win awards. He shies away from nothing, he tackles hard topics every week on his show, he exposes the ugly underbelly of American, and his native UK, with savage truth and humor. A weekly must watch.
He puts an idiot in charge, he cuts funding, then he says the Post Office can't do the one job it has, deliver the mail. All so he can run a false narrative about the coming election. This is what certain knowledge you're going to lose looks like.
So Sick of the Trump's Grifting
Never regulation of the 1st amendment. Nixon tried and thank God he lost we do not beed any changing of the first amendment first step to Nazism. Just what trump wants
Gawd. This fool is literally insane. He's so out of touch with reality he ought be in an institution, or jail, either works. He has meetings 2 or 3 times a week? Real presidents have meetings all day long. Unbelievably awful that this fool is president.
Here's what I know about Trump...he's the opposite of impressive
Where is the National Covid Plan, where e is the awesome healthcare plan Trump said was going to be signed this week.  Nothing, Zip, Nada.
It's actually to save Trump's hotel across the street. That is what I heard.
Um...your President was a close friend of Epstein and is accused of assaulting minors. This is way of deflecting from the truth. The Maxwell bird will sing and I bet Trump is on the client list.
I thought about this at first, but all of his children have proven to be incompetent idiots. Even the Republicans know this would be a really bad decision. The Trump family is over.
Trump is delusional
trump and dunce. dunce would be a scarry President
Dr Fauci. It will put trump over the edge
trump will never be less embarrassing
A Child Sex Trafficker and Donald Trump.
Uh...Really?
I know.  Tell Johnson that achievement is impossible. Nobody can be as bad as trump
Wtf are you smoking?  Trump is now a friend of the wilderness😂😂😂
Our economy was on a 10 year upward trend. Stopped at trump worse fall in gdp history
Were these kids tested before entering the building? Would trump go there?
I know. Think someone should tell trump???
trump be NaziFunny so calling a true #ResistanceUnited member a karen because I can't buy there #GreenParty  thing. I believe in reality. Reality is we need to remove trump. Dream of the green thing in the future. But for now lets get our country back first. VoteTheRedOut. Simple as that.
We could work backwards on Trump's failures, but COVID is the most acutely dangerous, so serious people are focused on that.
Trump said the USPS needed to raise its rates.
People are pissing me off big time. Green party Bernie bros Kon man west Pull your head out of trump and Putin's ass. Give it a god damn rest a be Americans. Your weak bullshit is a copout.
This my friends is a damn good tweet. It needs to be a #Retweeted and #Repeated. #TrumpMustBeStopped #TrumpMustGo  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace  #TrumpIsKillingUs  #AmericaIsBeingRippedApart  Remember #WeThePeople ?????? Trump is the new Hitler happening before our very eyes. STOP.
With his big mouth Not a chance, I would give Putin a week tops before trump was introduced to a balcony or bridge
That entire joke of a university is as fake as Trump’s was, right out of the Handmaid’s Tale mindset. Fire him, disband the school, send the kids to a real one. When it’s safe to do so.
Trump is going to be a favorite with the other inmates They will pass him around every night
Sorry, we need that money to renovate the White House and protect Trump hotels from competition.
Indeed Trump has a bunch of little sheep heading up all the intel agencies that have been raising the red flags over the months and years that putin loves trump Congress was updated in the past week that putin is hard at work Even today trump's own intel put out a warning idiots
Trump can't even win a debate against himself.
There blood on the Trump family’s hands
It wasn't Trump.  It was his CAMPAIGN.  THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. Do you think we're all dumb?
And the Trump enablers need to be ousted.
Trump only pretends to be a Christian.
How many of Trump Enviromental Regulation Roll backs with cause the River to Catch Fire, AGAIN?
Trump does not need Media Platform. He can say stupid shit and the National News Corps will cover it.
I don't think that trip to Ohio is going to give him the boost he expected given the unhinged rant he unleashed against Joe Biden's faith and his ludicrous misunderstanding of how the constitution is amended. This man HAS no God but money.
I completely agree with this. I've been saying this for months. They need to be destroyed. I'm just saying I wish we could run on that instead of *just* beating Trump. I want to run on "give no quarter" and taking our country back from the brink of fascism.
Trump just can't tell the truth about anything. Just another example.
We actually are. Trump and his party have, no surprise, prioritized money over human lives. But they've been doing that since Reagan. It's enough to make anyone with a soul cry.
It would be one thing if we had any kind of messaging from Democrats that it was the case, but instead we hear "we just have to beat Trump in November." That's not it, the work doesn't end there and we shouldn't pretend that it does.
It's not about Trump for me, it's about democracy. The point of what I'm saying is that I want that to be the message for Democrats. It has to be bigger than Trump for *everyone,* and centralizing the message around Trump and not what brought him to be makes that goal difficult.
Given that it is the most sophisticated ever, like nothing we've seen before, how long will it be until Trump takes credit for this too.
I'm just wondering now that Trump is banning TikTok and having White House staff rewrite COVID statistics when he'll begin banning modeling. Because this is terrifying and likely to get worse the more schools he forces to open.
We need to root out the corruption in both parties after Trump. We need to clean out government from the ground up. Government shouldn't be an opportunity given by the people to make your friends rich.
Trump is singing this tune, not knowing a thing about how the Constitution gets amended since he's never read it and doesn't follow it. He and his party should go down with the  faster than the Titanic.
Once again Trump is doing a touchdown dance over a jobs number that is the equivalent of scoring in the forth quarter when you are down by 40 points
I appreciate what they're doing, but I never, ever, lose sight of that fact. When Trump is gone, we'll be on opposite sides of what the country needs. Again. But for those who've undergone a true conversion and realize they've been wrong since Reagan. That number's not large.
Trump has done his best to destroy my country, and everyday it gets worse.
Please stop saying "added jobs", these are readded jobs, people going back to work, not brand new off the shelf, never seen before jobs. Saying the jobs were added allows Trump to claim credit. He did NOT create jobs.
Tell Facebook to stop allowing right-wing politicians to spread lies and misinformation!
After yesterday's statements Dumpy Donald Trump is no longer worthy of ANY believer in any faith tradition. After this year's performance, Dumpy is no longer worthy of the vote of anyone in America having ruined the economy, botched the pandemic and killed 160,000 of us.
I wish they'd stop saying "added jobs", these are readded jobs, people going back to work, not brand new off the shelf, never seen before jobs. Saying the jobs were added gives Trump the chance to claim credit. It's not his work that did this. At all.
Trump should implement a draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters run to Canada.  😂😂
Apparently Trump is slightly smarter than Dinesh.
This sounds like a parody of what someone who is super far up Trump's ass would say.
You know, I agree. Trump has devolved beyond any point of reason. He won’t debate, he’ll filibuster just like he does at rallies and press conferences. He won’t answer questions, he’ll just lie. Joe will win anyway, nothing to gain in a debate.
was brilliant tonight. Trump’s classifying his violation of the Hatch Act, another crime. Then the crass theft of $64 million by NRA officials and the suit to dissolve them. When we talk about equity in wealth distribution, these are reasons why. Grifters gonna grift. 😡
Is Trump labeled as "Republican Party affiliated yet?
That's true, although not out of the realm of possibility with Trump.
There's absolutely no way that Trump doesn't go down instantaneously as the worst President we've ever had, right?
He faked it to get out of meeting with Trump.
Some of the putin useful idiot replies is hilarious  Last week the house was updated about the Russians and the election This week the senate was updated of what Putin is up to This was all mostly classified. But in resent months and years the TRUMP admin Intel reports its true
Trump Biblically challenged. 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈 He is.
Trump fans, insulting people. Typical
Y'all are going to go down with the Trump ship if you keep this up.  Y'all know that, right?
I believe  about his faith which is why I find it so odd that #prochoice folx are ready to accept his flip-flop on abortion.
Trump should start a draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters run to Canada
Trump Loves Russian Money
Wrong.  Trump could not have done so much damage, without the  enablers.
Trump has no shame.   A Christian he will never be.
He's telling us so we know how desperate Trump is to win including helping West take away votes from Biden. #CrookedTrump
Furthermore when Trump was here, estimates were that at least 20% of the crowd was registered Democrats. The only way Democrat’s win this time is a very significant increase in voter tourn out that goes unmatched by the right.
The way Trump treats people, he is the one against God.
The thing about this is, it’s nearly impossible that Trump does not have at least the same level of support he had 4 years ago. Factor ipeople here were afraid of him and didn’t vote/voted 3rd party/wrote in.. Some are all in now. Then the D hard left turn.. It’s at least 50/50.
Trump the heathen can gfh.
We deserve better than Trump &amp; Biden! #UNITY2020 is on a mission to draft a President &amp; VP to unite the country. This is neither a spoiler campaign nor a 3rd party ticket. Learn more and get on the email list here:  Let's take back our republic!
Lay off the crack.  You seriously believe that facebook supports the alt right or google does.  How ficking stupod are you? Over 1500 friends on Facebook and be get "jailed" simpley because we support Trump. Trump 2020.
Did.  When Did tRump get his Lobotomy.
Okay it's a correction, but just for a second, I was laughing like crazy, because if anyone deserves Twitmo or a permanent ban it's Trump. Maybe after he's kicked out of D.C. One can dream. Or at least one can if white and not in danger of deportation.
That's Trump's response to every investigation into his illegalities. Witch Hunt. Well, it should be Warlock hunt, but I won't quibble with that. I will though object to his getting away with anything he's done, including the information  presented last night. Damning info
Now do Germany, France and the UK.  Please also address Trump's Slamming of NATO
What I admire most about President Trump is his subtlety
Gov. Dewine COVID-19 positive. Another close call for trump. It is getting closer and closer. How long can trump keep dodging this virus?  I don't see Donny as a Good Hand Hygiene practitioner.
You can't talk about obstruction. The Heroes Act is what we need. Pass that. You've already said you will obstruct everything if the Senate remains in your control. You're as big a hypocrite as Trump. Remember Merrick Garland? I do. That's what obstruction is, you dolt.
They didn't silence Trump. They silenced the CAMPAIGN.  Honest mistake on your part, Matty, since all he knows how to do is campaign.
it seems Putin will have to be use facebook more as his investment payment service towards trump campaign. More rubbles that Mark Zuckerberg will deny was even on the books. #NRA is under the microscope She gave a hint of possible criminal charges as well, false info to IRS &amp; AG
Donald Trump openly uses “official” White House events for campaigning – meaning that if you pay federal taxes, you are helping him get reelected  via
Do you think it will ever dawn on them that they got played by that tweet about moving the election?  Trump pulls that like he’s playing reverse psychology with a 4 year old and they keep taking the bait.
I can't speak for anyone else, but I can tell you Trump and his party are people I have opposed my entire life. I spent 45 years in public service. I saw systemic racism, generational poverty up close. I believe all people are created equal. Trump is not that. That's why, for me.
This is the equivalent of Bugs Bunny certifying Wile E. Coyote as cognitively advanced and has just as much meaning. Sad when doctors sell their souls. Guessing this guy was NOT at the top of his class.
Peter Navarro just called Donald Trump a "working class President" and a did a spit take.
You enabled this Virus Spread. You Enabled Trump.
Pro-Life? 159,000+ COVID DEAD   TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FAILED AMERICA
Trump should implement the draft and half of Biden's voters would go to Canada
Was is Every Trump campaigning? To keep their spouses from going to prison?
If it wasnt for Covid19 and your Dem leaders lying over and over this economy would still be smoking hot,you are unfit to be President Mr Biden,the economy will crash,they will replace you with your VP as soon as you get sworn in because you cant handle the stress that Trump does
Delusional. Trump believes his own fantasies.
I agree. Trump despises those reporters who stay on point and keep asking the tough questions. Acosta is the  of these times. He earns his stripes every time he has the floor.
failed our nation. But we will not fail as a nation. We have weathered many storms and may encounter more. The storms trump has created will pass and we will be stronger because of it. But we will never forgive or forget. #mkdreads
Trump would not attend Joe's inauguration.
I guess they didn’t learn from this gem.
What a glorious thing it would be. Trump getting schooled. They will show him so much love on that schoolyard. Yah think?
Trump has always and consistently viewed himself as above the law.
I suppose the Trump kids could be put in cuffs first... Then wait for DonTheCon later
Of all the monstrous things Trump has done, spreading the lie that children are immune from Covid-19 infections for potential electoral gain is probably the worst and something I’m convinced history will be a harsh judge of.
The truth has no place in Trump land
keep blowing smoke but Trump doesn’t know anything of what’s happening and too many people have died and when he is out of WH you are out of a job
The Donald John Trump school of spelling and pronunciation.
This guys crazier than trump
Easy and actionable, in rapid fashion. Responsibly done, these are all great ideas. We CAN make America great again, we need to after what the republicans and Trump have done to it.
That was an atrocious interview, he showed his true colors throughout. I'm betting heads will roll over allowing him to actually do it. He won't take responsibility, he never does, but he'll have to blame someone. We'll blame him.
Adding to the rapidly growing evidence that support from  is really a kiss of death to candidates. This pretend president has no coat tails. So, republicans are distancing themselves but it won't work. We see what they've done. We see them.
Trump is picking tiny points from her testimony and declaring that ALL he did was just fine. Declaring victory and  that what happened was the crime of the century. Of course, this means he is watching tv again instead of governing, but that's par for his course. Liar in chief.
Then tell Trump to stop lying.
The bottom line is that if all the LP and Never Trump Republicans want to do is get rid of Trump, then we're not on the same side. The problem isn't Trump, it's *all* Republicans.
Trump will try to force kids back to school physically, cut Covid testing resources, hide Covid data, and destroy the USPS—he has a single goal of re-election and no one and nothing else matters.
159,000 + DEAD. Trump has a Desth Cult.
Send it back and say it is what is just like tRUmp
Trump literal Covid-19 Plan is to seal himself in a testing bubble, play golf, blame others, and wish it away.
Ya'll know Trump is a Liar, right?
That has never happened to me (to my knowledge).  If anyone ever sees that I've liked a Trump tweet, please kick my ass!😃
WOW! Watch the full "Axios on HBO" interview with President Trump - Axios
Every day this man gets more stupid.... #TrumpIsACompleteFailure Twitter Users Mock Trump For Mispronouncing Yosemite
At this point Trump will probably refuse to do any debates, then put out ads saying Biden didn't want debates.
Trump either maintains real fantasies about being president for life or thinks it's funny to troll that he would try to violate the Constitution.  Both are disgusting and beneath his office.  He's truly the most vile person to serve as president.
You'll need a lot of room for mass incarnation after The Trump administration is out of office!
Trump's health plan did pass?
Trump's like a grade schooler trying to BS his teacher on his failure to pass a test by trying to change reality
I was around back then Mr Trump and your no Lyndon Johnson when it comes to civil rights sir!
Yes Iam sure that when people look back at the Trump presidency that's the first thing that well come to everyone's minds what a great civil rights leader he was! And after they've all stopped laughing they'll think of all his other failures and criminal acts!
You're doing the same thing Trump does trying to turn reality around by lies to fit your agenda your the one who have kept the American people waiting while slashing aid to the American people who desperately need it to survive while you and the Republican Senate went on recess
Trump Hangs out with A Sex child trafficker. Let that sink in.
hope you are right. I think there are traps. Even if Trump does expose that Joe is senile which he undoubtedly will, there’s going to be a fine line between beating him politically vs abusing a feeble old man. We can run ads to show the senility. Bad risk/reward ratio.
Jonathan Swan was AWESOME! He challenged Trump at every turn!
Im not sure. Biden has nothing to lose. Trump does. It’s like a #1 college football team playing a trap game. No upside. #1 team wins, they didn’t prove anything. Bad team scores, does well, God forbid wins, then the sky is falling. Add moderators. Spin. Newscycle. Not worth it.

Gawd. This fool is literally insane. He's so out of touch with reality he ought be in an institution, or jail, either works. He has meetings 2 or 3 times a week? Real presidents have meetings all day long. Unbelievably awful that this fool is president.
Here's what I know about Trump...he's the opposite of impressive
Swan: South Korea is doing well.  Trump: NUH UH  We have a toddler as a leader.
Where is the National Covid Plan, where e is the awesome healthcare plan Trump said was going to be signed this week.  Nothing, Zip, Nada.
Trump is delusional
A Child Sex Trafficker and Donald Trump.
Wtf are you smoking?  Trump is now a friend of the wilderness😂😂😂
Were these kids tested before entering the building? Would trump go there?
Don't worry, everybody is trained to see exactly what they want to see in that interview, like everything else Trump does or says.
Defund Trump!
I find it somewhat surprising that the trump cult is not in favor of more LGBQT rights considering they enjoy being stroked by the likes of a  &amp;  This #trump cult seems to get worked into a frenzy over nothing burgers Maybe it's just that stroking 🤣
3.5 years of Trump's stupidity  Enough.
Trump has absolutely no business being involved in this discussion. It's like me asking my kids about our household spending habits. They just aren't involved in that sort of work.
Holy shit, at this point it's a race between Senate Republicans and the White House to determine how many deaths is too many. If Donald Trump wins that race, we're all dead.
yes I know they are fishing again to distract all the trump GOP  failures State Department probe of Clinton emails finds no deliberate mishandling of classified information. Justice Dept. winds down Clinton-related inquiry once championed by Trump. It found nothing of consequence
while #fox news talks about this, they should also tell the audience Hillary Clinton was also cleared in 2019 by the trump administration. That release was a late friday dump  Right, they rather keep the cult clueless about the facts
Never underestimate Trump’s ability to saw a tree limb out from under his staff!
Karma will be sweet when his Azz and his adult children end up in prisons. Mean while Clinton was cleared long ago my the trump administration And today, the FISA's were cleared as valid and proper
#Trump cult including the Republican ain't going to like this The FISA applications were legal and valid.  Only 2 material errors and found that all of the applications contained sufficient basis for probable cause
on this twitter machine I can send my thoughts to trump and his redcap fun bunch any time I want.... he never replies though....probably my tone, or my breath
i suggest they hold a trump cult rally and give free shots The sooner the better.... maybe they can mix in some bleach &amp; lysol as a backup plan
Again, Trump voters are racists or don't find racism a deal breaker.
I'm just of the mind that we need to start thinking about what we want life to look like after Trump, and many of these political marriages of convenience are going to give way to big fights in the Democratic Party.
We can't keep using Trump as the bar with which we determine how we hold our elected officials accountable. If Biden doesn't pick any progressives, we should demand better. That doesn't mean withholding votes, it means demanding better. Conflating the two isn't a good thing.
Sounds exactly like ANY Trump speech, press conference or talk by a helicopter.
The Trump kids will come in with some tool belts and try some DIY and pocket the cash.
Great question. Might be because Trump likes to invoke the name, improperly as he doesn't understand what Lincoln did nor that the party he leads today is NOT the party that Lincoln led.
I don't disagree, I think our best weapon is Trump himself. I'm just eager to hear our platform, give us all time to get behind it, we've shot ourselves in the foot so often squabbling over it and I don't want that to get in the way this year. We're our own worst enemy too often.
We can handle that, if we just unite behind Joe's choice and keep the focus on all Trump has done wrong, is doing wrong. They'll attack, but they've nothing new, nothing we can't counter with better ideas for all of us. I really believe the nation is ready for major changes.
I agree. This isn't a traditional election, we really need focus on uniting against Trump, not sniping at each other over what is  choice. Democrats do more harm to each other every election than republicans do to them. Please, just get on the same page. It's critical.
I think it is a shame that an elected representative has so little faith in our Constitution and history. If Trump loses the election he will be removed if he tries to stay by our military who will honor their oath, anything less is a coup. Not here.
My concern is that this is not a traditional election. I'd like to see Joe and his pick on the road, on social media, everywhere, fighting Trump and the republican party, uniting Democrats as soon as possible. There's so much at stake, it feels like there's not a moment to lose.
Wow, Trump lie? He never does that!  Seriously, he doesn't care about Americans getting sick and or dying.
Can’t help but feel   is partially responsible for the out of control pandemic. So afraid of appearing biased that he became biased. If he would have told us what they were looking at with Trump/Russia we may have avoided this. #ButHerEmails
So much wrong with this.  Trump is stealing Tax money to prop up his businesses.  Plus, What deal has Donald made to benefit solely the American People?  It's all about Donny.
Anyone can get a pass for 2016...  Unfortunately now, simply too much info/evidence to showcase trump's narcissism, white nationalism/racism, and sexism.   No more passes.  Support trump? A choice w/ very real consequences - including broken relationships
No debates needed. We know about the Trump Dumpster Fire Administration .  Enough with that mess.
Donald John Trump. He should become as famous as Murphy for this one. Eventually, when we can speak his name again in century or so.
As if he had a choice. Even his own party, the most odious of them, turned on him immediately after this latest gaffe. It should also tell him clearly this is NOT 1930's Germany and he's not going to be able to slowly kill our democracy by anyone.
Never underestimate Trump’s ability to saw tree limbs out from underneath his staff.
Just wait until Joe makes her the next AG  The trump cult will learn what Law &amp; Order really means with a lot of Justice added in...
Trump is a fake President!
Is the Trump campaign going to play 36 holes a weekend?
I never watched it either. Trump was always creepy to me.
Passing a law is the opposite of a coupe.  And Trump and McDaniel have both repeatedly voted by mail. They just don’t want you too.
Wait, TikTok has 100,000 US users? That means TikTok videos are getting way more play on Twitter in the US than TikTok. How did Vine fail again?
Yes and also if you want the pandemic virus to just disappear puff like that! One of Trump's great medical theories
Are you talking about Trump's traveling medicine show?
Because it's a Trump cult that believes his dog and pony act and his traveling medicine show theories about the pandemic virus pure con artist BS that comes out of his mouth every time he opens it
Well it wasn't Trump he already covered that it it it was Obama who soiled his pants ya that's it it was Obama who pooped his pants
If Trump opens his mouth it's a lie
Trump's plan what plan?
Yes your right if you're talking about how much damage he's done to our country well Yes I completely agree with you For a moment there I thought you were one of those cult like supporters of Trump who so adore his con man babbling and fall for it
You must be one of the cult that adores Trump no matter how much damage he has done to our country
Biden is nothing compared to what Hillary was.... so this is a easy victory for Trump. Trump 2020
Now you've got it! And by Trump and Senate majority leader Mitch multi millionaire McConnell and the rest of the Republican Senate and Congress working tirelessly for the rich and powerful and corporations they get rewarded handsomely now you see how it works ?
And also that's not who they represent they represent and work tirelessly for the rich and powerful and corporations thus getting rewarded by the rich and powerful and corporations Trump Mitch multi millionaire McConnell and the Republican corrupt cronies
No no no we need these people to pay taxes that pay for Trump and Senate majority leader Mitch multi millionaire McConnell and the rest of his Republican cronies in the Senate and Congress to represent the the rich and powerful and corporations so they can have more power
Yes but you miss the point Trump and Senate majority leader Mitch multi millionaire McConnell and the rest of his Republican cronies in the Senate and Congress still have a job with wonderful benefits and really isn't that much more important than these people you speak of ?
Yes but you have to give them credit The great orange one Trump and Senate majority leader Mitch multi millionaire McConnell and his Republican cronies in the Senate and Congress are doing a  great job at helping them selves at the American people's expense !
Yes well in defense of Trump he's got plans to go golfing
Trump has in many cases followed a play by play account of what another dictator did in WW2  in Germany to gain and sustain power Adolf Hitler and has read his book and is a big fan
Trump supporters don't support him because what he does for them but what he does against people they hate. #racism #GOP  #votehimout #TrumpFailedAmerica
Did he miss the official Trump shitter while tweeting and stain the floor?
Like I've said before, Trump voters are racists or his racism isn't a deal breaker....
It's a cult if they would get there heads out of their ass's they would see and rewrite their slogan to say rescue us from Trump the most corrupt  disgusting person ever to be the president of the United states
At Least Russia didnt Shoot them down. Trump would have to Ignore this also.
**brb...going to find the video of Trump stating that mail-in voting is a great idea.
He can't help himself, nor anyone else, the lies keep getting bigger, the failures more spectacular. He cannot legislate by executive order, that's unconstitutional, and all money bills must begin in the House, that's required. He failed - again.
Are you suggesting the China government  owes the American people an apology for the lack of Republican leadership battling this worldwide pandemic?  Heck, their government took it serous when they &amp; the rest of the world understood the dangers The #GOP and Trump still haven't#ExecutiveOrder Trump can sign whatever piece of paper he wants, but he has no power of the purse. Only Congress can appropriate money. Trump's EO's are like him, useless.
"Trump says, 'in the not too distant future,'"  And I say, "Next Sunday A.D."?
#IntelligenceReports So Russia is working against Biden. China is working against Trump. Guess which one Trump will do something about.
You wouldn’t even ban China like trump did yet it’s his fault an airborne virus from China is killing people? Can’t hide from it, COVID is life now. Life is risky, hide in your home and go broke or take a risk and live life. Either way you could get it. Vaccines take years...
Trump is a democrat now!?
Here come comments trying to blame trump for COVID + anything else people don’t like about their lives today.
What about the guy who predicted all but one correct, including correct about trump beating Clinton and Biden now?
Thats not the olny one Trump will win.  should win 50 states but will probably win olny 30-35. Either way, Trump will get #FourMoreYears
Trump has made today’s GOP “enemy of the state”.
Sure! People don't have jobs. Or housing. Or childcare. Or access to food. The tax cuts Trump passed was throwing yachts to those who already had catamarans. The question is: are they going to throw life jackets or anchors to those who are currently drowning?
#Election2020 Is Trump saying that Biden wants to put God on the disabled list?
Remember, the Trump Tax Cuts cost $2.3 Trillion and predominantly cut taxes for the absolute wealthiest people in this country.
Nah, there really wasn't. This is like saying there's a better-than-zero chance that I'll speak at the RNC but Ivanka Trump won't.
this is why Trump should put Antifa down, instead of arresting them.
It’s clear the Democrats are going to accuse Trump and republicans of everything the Democrats are actually doing ONCE AGAIN.  Remember Jerry Nadler saying mail in voting is too susceptible to fraud when Obama was running? Why is it safe now? Right...#DementiaJoe
How do people blame this on trump!? It’s China virus for a reason. We all can’t lockdown and hide from it forever! We have to live life. Life can be risky. Take a chance or hide at home, up to you, don’t blame trump. China and the state = virus and lockdowns...
Compare that to the head of the Republican Party Donald Trump who owns none of his past. All of us have a past. Right Amy.
One of the reason this falls apart is that Trump -- who is an atheist, let's not pretend -- has no understanding of the language of faith. No Evangelical believes that Biden can hurt God, for God's sake.
Those who know nothing reside in or work in Hollywood.  Trump cares about this country.  Hollywood cares about protecting pedophiles.
This is what trump does to people.
Like trump, stealing everything he can.
Trump and Republican have been synonymous for a few years now.
Why won't one single Democratic "So Called" leader stand up and denounce the violence going on in US streets where people are dying??? Why as acommon sense human being would you ever vote democrat again? TRUMP 2020!!! STOP THE TERRORISTS IN OUR STREETS!
Just this week Trump has talked about Yo-Semite and Thighland.
Didn’t he say that about the MLB? Maybe he said it for all sports I don’t know,  but yeah why would he even think trump would watch the NBA, especially now 😂
Trump said Beirut was a bomb and that kids are immune to COVID-19 so I wouldn't listen to what he says.
While still about 50 points too high, this is actually a catastrophically bad number for Trump.
If you're trusting Team Trump to tell the truth, hi sucker.
I call it Trump virus... #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
#TrumpIsACrook New York is going to be a legal nightmare for Trump and all of his allies.
#Covid19 Trump is going to Ohio - today the Gov. of Ohio tests positive for the virus. #CurseOfTrump
Normal humans admit when they are wrong. Trump is not a normal human.
Up Trump’s Ass.  Duh!  Right next to you!!
Hey, I won't claim to know the future. Biden is terrible, so despite how bad Trump is, he could still win.  That said, Trump's approval is plummeting, and he is losing in the vast majority of polls. Not just by overall percentage, but state to state he is losing.
Also...(Fauci) 1) I funded the lab in Wuhan 2) I'm a joke (Trump muzzles me on purpose) 3) I threw a worst first pitch than 50 Cent (impossible) 4) I still don't wear a mask, but tell all of you to do so 5) And HCQ works miraculously..I knew so 15 years ago  This guy is THE VIRUS
Donald J Trump IS the Swamp
Stupid fricken brainwashed Trumpers! No nothing about how the economy works! If they did they know the stock market will crash as fast as this economy that Trump inherited and has totally abolished! Balling out the stock markets to make for a smoke screen!  Wait and watch!
Make America Great Again. Indict a Trump
Drain the swamp! Trump and he’s cronies are the swamp! Please America get the impeached! Idiot out of office! Drain the menace that has failed our country of corona virus! 160,000 that’s over a 1000 per day for the last 10 days! He has caused this with his denial! Bad tests! Bad
Trump that old faithful was Yosemite Park! Old faithful is in Wyoming and Yosemite is in California! U would think a President would know that! But he doesn’t! He don’t even know how to say it! No wonder he was given a dimentia test!! R we sure he even passed it! I wonder?
This is the biggest fake news every put out! The only ones that won’t go peacefully is paranoid Trump! Full of more conspiracy Theories than any cult leader I’ve seen! He’s fake news!! That’s a smoke screen! To hide Trumps truth! He’s the Stupidest person to ever be office
Yea it would be worse. We would have millions dead to the pandemic because she wants to be politically correct. We would be at war with North Korea and Iran and China and especially Russia. We would still be in Afghanistan only more bombs would be dropped than Trump.
I love how everyone blamed trump when obama was doing this shit in 2015.
Not because of covid. It’s because of trump. 100%
The mistakes he is attributing to Trump were his on the test he took.
Trump-pence  Trumpets 🎺🎺
#Covid19 I guess to Trump, all the people dying from Covid are merely background noise....just incidentals...collateral damage.
You support Trump, whose policies have been so bad that he is losing terribly to a man that can barely speak, and you’re surprised she’s popular? Maybe take a look at your beliefs my dude.
ThAt was so painful to watch. Trump didn’t answer a single question. He can’t stay on topic.   is awful.
One final thought on the Axios interview: If there is one thing history will neither record nor remember about Rep. John Lewis, it will be the fact that he skipped Trump's inauguration.
I honestly want Trump to give his acceptance speech from the White House. Nothing more accurate than him literally breaking the law as he accepts the GOP nomination.
Please next tweet about trump hotel and the emoulments to be fair and balanced.  I'll wait.
All the comments are quick to blame trump 😂 Remember Frey and Walz denied help for three weeks. This is on our Democrat mayor and governor, trump ended the chaos here.
This was the most frustrating thing I think I’ve ever watched. —&gt; Watch the full "Axios on HBO" interview with President Trump
This is my husband when he talks about Trump...he gets so rattled that he never actually finishes a thought.  And yet, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HES TRYING TO SAY
you could show a trump supporter physical proof of something he’s been accused of and they’ll just say “that’s just what the media says”
If the Democrats nominated whatever our equivalent of Trump would be -- Sean Penn with a head wound, prolly -- and the GOP nominated Jeb, I would vote for Jeb, because I actually care about my country.
But trump flags and propaganda is acceptable🤢
I love when Trump tries to use facts. It’s a nice change from the usual unsubstantiated ramblings (i.e. lies) but never ends wells.
It's like just a statistic to trump, nothing more.
His facial reactions to Trump talking are PRICELESS! 🤣🤣🤣
I just road bike 1200 miles in MN WI IA and IL, saw 100's of Trump signs! 2 Biden signs. Talked to 100 people at business and rally's NOT 1 Biden supporter ALL TRUMP 2020!
What Trump has done to ruin the United States' relationships with it's allies is incalculable, insulting, and just straight up embarrassing.
Eric I long for an America where the corruption of your family is gone. If I get two answers then I also long for an America where you and the entire Trump crime family is in prison. How about you?
Trump voodoo dolls
It also makes me wonder which pieces of reporting are actually presented to Trump. For example, I wonder if his adminstration only presents him with positive sounding charts and graphs for fear of lashings from Trump.
All the boomers and the trump supporters on here saying how bad tiktok is but still use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Let’s be honest they all steal our data, especially google.
Been waiting 5 years for a reporter to sit 4 feet away from Trump and give him this look
#Covid19 Trump says you have to use the statistics that make me look better. You can't use real ones.
Trump wishing Ghislaine Maxwell well *again* is the moment he became president.
Honest to God, Trump would look so much better without the makeup. The weird line puts him in the uncanny valley.
Yes, Fred Willard would have nailed that exchange as Trump. RIP.
How many black women did Trump consider?
Only tRump doesn’t get it because he’s an idiot.
Evidently you didn’t watch the last debates.  Trump was the only one on stage who answered the questions asked.  Everyone else veered off into prepared talking points.
Just like Trump to love to tear down the constitution! Something he’s done every sense he’s been in the White House! Calling Protesters Antifa! Just another name calling bully tactic! If u stand for this behavior! Your part of the problem! Trump is promblematic! Needs help!
A little over a month ago, Trump urged SCOTUS to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and kick 130 million people off health insurance. Also to allow insurance companies to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions. Technically, that *is* an overhaul.
I had 66 who liked trump and only 5 for Biden
I’m not defending Trump or Biden though? Lol
Sure, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna cheat. It just means that Trump may start imprisoning his political opponents.
And trump is giving it all away to Putin.
So, these cops for trump are corrupt cops? Cops for Criminals!
Please do tell me why I should vote for Biden. You can't mention Trump, Republicans, or anything else related. Only describe his platform, and how it would benefit America. Go ahead.
Mostly due to Democrat governors and mayors. But go ahead, continue blaming Trump for everything.
Trump will want to ban Twitter comments next. #hegone
The thing I don’t get is that, even if he wasn’t a scummy corrupt racist, Trump seems like a genuinely awful person to spend four hours with!
If you think that big tech, the Chineese, And the Democrats are not working to destroy this country, You are a dillusional socialist communist sympathizer. Regular Americans and Preaident Trump must start fighting back against this. This lunacy must stop!
Look forward to Rose Twitter declaring that Trump has outflanked us again.
4 more years for Donald Trump
I remember when Trump beat John F. Kennedy in 88’. Classic.
#TrumpIsAnIdiot When you have more testing you find more cases that are already there. Testing doesn't create cases, it helps us identify what is already infecting us. Why is that so hard for Trump to understand? And is this why we have always had a testing shortage?
Someone please stop me from going off on my Trump/Fox News loving cousin’s FB post
Trump was never there.  He kicked Epstein out of Mar a Lago.
Trump hasn’t done anything wrong.  You need to educate yourself.
#ChinaChina I think Trump is banning TikTok to slow the spread of Sarah Cooper's lip syncing.
And cue the rioting middle Schoolers. --------- Trump plans to ban TikTok in the U.S.  via
Guess I don’t know what he did or say, or who he is! If he supports trump, he’s no one to like. Too many people are blind to the fact trump is 21st century Hitler.
Not sure where the  gets its data, but if the calls and texts are any indication, they have no idea what congressional district I live in.  So much spam...  Oh, and if they align with Trump, that's an automatic no vote this year.  A conservative independent voter...
#mnleg #MNGOP is sending this out as some kind of indication that Trump is doing well in MN - but you might want to look at the other numbers....
UK had no lockdown - Johnson used the Trump method.
Well, then what about our graphs. Trump says we are doing great. You buy that?
Yup. Lujan Grisham might not be the VP nominee, but she's still in the mix. Anyhow, I'm sure Trump's very Latino VP Mike Pence will win over the Latine vote.
Because of the way the Senate elections are this year, the Democrats would have a majority in the Senate and Patrick Leahy becomes President on January 20. There is no scenario where Trump can tie this up in litigation and remain president, and the military hates him, so no coup.
Sweden does not have herd immunity and they started that at the beginning. And if we would have had a national mandate for that 2 week lockdown, a full complete lockdown, we probably would be better off right now. Unfortunately, Trump is all over the map on guidelines.
I’m more worried about the location of Pence...are they keeping him safe so when Trump implodes he can take over as Pres, or did they just forget to unplug him from his charging pod again?
“Virus wipes out” is a funny way to describe Trump. Not inaccurate though
I bet it will be contested due to mail in fraud and drawn out with rioting nobody who wins it’s a sham.  Trump may be our last true president. #Trump2020
#Covid19 I think we might as well assume that Trump's calls to Putin are to find out what Putin wants Trump to say for propaganda. Trump is Pravda.
Because you're in your own community that shares what it wants to see. Everyone does this. If you took yourself out of that bubble though, and looked at the whole picture. Sorry, Trump is not winning Cali. I'll record myself eating my shoe and send it to you if he wins the state.
I hate Biden, I'm not voting for either tbh. That said, if you think Trump has any chance at winning if the election was held tomorrow, you don't understand what people are going through. He has failed, and people are angry.
Sane people would see what the average American is going through, and demand the govt to do more for them. This isn't their fault, its the govts. fault. And since Trump is president, I would be worried about his re-election if I were you.
If you don’t even make $600 a week you should have never gotten an extra $600 a week, what a joke of a program. How is that helping anyone go back to work?  Trump should drug test EBT recipients as well.
Yes, really it’s a matter of who wins Wis, Fla, Penn, Mich and maybe a couple others. It was close last time with misogyny as a factor. Now that it’s a boring old white guy and Trump has had three years to show his total incompetence I have to think that’s enough to swing.
It was Obama's economy... but you break it, you buy it...  Trump now owns it.
Trump killed Herman Cain.
Yup. It won't keep Trump in office. It will motivate some of America's worst people.
Look I don't know if you know this but Donald Trump is a 33ﾟ Freemason and a Jesuit who has been knighted he has had ties with Israel for years he loves Israel more than America that's apparent he is on to of israel's coins wake up. Trump is one of them NOW research what I wrote
I have engaged in conversation with some of the 'allLivesMatter' crowd and have been told that Trump makes them feel special... That people are talking about everyone else but them... My response is... You do know you're white right?  Your level of privilege is extremely high!!!
They're literally the same thing. Also, Trump has no power to delay the election, it's hard-wired into the Constitution and run by the states. And if you think Trump doesn't know he's losing...he clearly knows he's losing.
Seems like the pedocrats are getting ready to start a war or remove trump before they lose their sham of an election this year. If they do lose with this much cheating I’ll be very impressed. Many already know they want war,it’s just they want their voters to do it. #DNCisCorrupt
So now the Acorn pimp-video kid is “making” videos of Trump saying terrible things in hopes that liberals will retweet, just so he can reveal that they are spreading fake news?  Wow...genius...🙄
The left was the party of tolerance at one point, now trump is a racist because he disagrees with their opinions. Party of hatred is the #dnc now. Lots of Latino and black white supremacists voting for #trump2020No, seriously...what the fuck did Trump mean when he said, “Drain the swamp”?
Hey MAGATS.....DOESN'T it give you pause that your beloved tRump is being helped by Russia?
BIG NEWS Trump three weeks ago said in two weeks he would reveal a new healthcare plan.   BIG NEWS: it’s Obamacare!

Chris Cuomo asked me about Trump’s saying he would signing an executive order to “give” people pre-existing condition protections.  Here’s what I should have said: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Define irony:  President Trump trying to take credit for protecting pre-existing conditions, that were put in place by Obama, while his administration asks the Supreme Court to end pre-existing conditions by overturning Obamacare.
Trump tries to muscle through changes in presidential debates to gain advantage ⁦ ⁦ ⁦
So maybe Trump will issue an executive order throwing out the election.
Pure bullshit from the elderly Trump whose dementia has been acting up again.
You're no Anderson Cooper, that's for sure. 😹😹😹😹
Do you think China is right now saying that the racist US President is going to have a news conference about the Trump virus?
🚨 Alternative Headline 🚨   Trump signs executive order strengthening key provisions of Obamacare.
If tRump wins this fall will you stay in the US or leave for another country? Which country?

Trump is no way no how “ cosmopolitan” he is trailer park trash. No matter how much money he has.
There’s a lot of money to be made in masks too. I mean nurses need them badly so I bet they would pay a lot.  Small businesses, college students &amp; others joined the PPE free for all as the Trump Admin eases regulations.  $2 masks began selling for $5. 13/

Donald trump send them pics
NO, DR FAUCI IS A EXPERT ON THE VIRUS AND trump KNOWS SHIT ABOUT IT AND IS JEALOUS OF DR FAUCI SO trump ATTEMPTS TO BRING A CLASS,ACT LIKE DR FAUCE DOWN INTO THE GUTTER WHERE trump LIVES.
Let's just stick with helping the people, $1 trillion for state and local governments who spent wildly on pensions??? No thanks, Pelosi needs to bring her numbers way, way down (below $1.5 trillion) before Republicans will do a deal. Otherwise Trump will likely act unilaterally.
The people who need help will get it and the courts will rightfully remove the power of Trump to act unilaterally but by then there will likely be a vaccine or at least a viable antibody treatment.
Sure, but Schumer is literally holding things up to get the SALT deduction limit removed (which only helps the richest)! I hope Trump does somehow do all this through executive action and it takes 6 months or a year to go through the courts which strike him down.
Well, they won't go Trump, and they won't write Bernie in this time. I say this is a Bernie write-in voter during the last election.
Watched a hour of the fake news network   today and never saw a peep about his racism remarks yesterday. If that was trump we would be watching  around the clock coverage
THATS WHY trump IS GOING TO DO HIS BEST. WITH THE HELP OF THE CHICKENSHIT SCOTUS  AND THE  A-KISSING BARR /DOJ AND THE FRICKIN BRAIN DEAD IGNORANT GULLIBLE LAPDOG LACKEY GOP TO CANCEL OR,AT LEAST DELAY THE ELECTION.
tRump is a traitor!
JUST WONDERING, HAS trump LEARNED HOW TO CLOSE A UMBRELLA YET?
No way could Biden spell monolith or provide a definition.  Dementia Joe hasn't written a single tweet in the last year.  When he has to meet Trump on stage without a teleprompter, ear piece, or notes, it will be  GAME OVER!
OH YOU MEAN trumps BULLSHIT CLAIM TO STOP N. KOREAN NUKE PROGRAM?        WASN'T THAT ABOUT THE SAME TIME trump BULLSHITTED ABOUT RELEASNG HIS TAX RETURNS?
TRUE, TRICKY DICK NEVER SOLD OUT THE COUNTRY TO RUSSIA LIKE trump IS DOING. NIXON NEVER ACCEPTED BREZHNEV'S WORD OVER USA INTEL. RUSSIA NEVER HELPED ELECT NIXON  BREZHNEV WASN'T PAYING TO HAVE AMERICANS KILLED NIXON DIDN'T WITHDRAWL TROOPS AFTER PRIVATE PHONE CALL WITH BREZHNEV.
How do you propose we go about the investigation??  You want to subpoena Putin?  You think the CIA isn't looking into it?  Is this just one more thing you want to blame on Trump??
1.8 million jobs created in one month?  How many jobs did Obama ever create in a month?  By your logic, Trump has chopped down Mt Everest 6% in a month; about the mass of all the buildings in New York.  That's one hell of an ice pick!
Apparently it is, to him! I would like to introduce him to Trump's critics...some of whom are better-educated than him, and others who did not have (or want) that opportunity and are wonderful and significant people. Equating education with intelligence or worth is dumb.
JUST SAVE A LOT OF TIME AND SPACE AND SIMPLY SAY I AM SICK IF trump.  BUT REMEMBER IT IS WHAT IT IS

BECAUSE THAT 5 TIME DRAFT DODGER COWARD  trump  IS CURRENTLY UNFORTUNATELY THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
The courts only matter to people who are willing to listen and enforce what the courts say.  Trump will just exercise his legal rights to bring up non-material items to keep dragging this out and not comply.  It is a basic flaw of our judicial system that is accepted.
Trump not liking TikTok makes it that much more rewarding to have open on my phone for like 3 hours a day
BULLSHIT.POSTMASTER GENERAL IS A trump "BOY" AND WILL DO WHATEVER POSSIBLE TO RE-ELECT HIS GRAND HIGH N MIGHTY ORANGE ONE.       LIKE THE  ORANGE SLIME BALL BASTARD 2-BIT G-D MFinPHONY, YOU CAN'T TRUST/BELIEVE ANY OF HIS "BOYS". THEY WILL SAY WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE SAID. BUT DO IT?
Of course they are deleting comments. Certainly can't have people questioning the sanity of something so dangerous. This is 'merica where we ignore reality and follow Trump off a cliff like lemmings.
The incompetence of the Trump administration is staggering.

Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes
Check this article:   OKAY...OKAY...BUT what does President Trump have to say about this? #TrumpIsALaughingStock #WeathermanTrump #IsItRainingDonny
........And the Trump cult members will believe his BS.
Hi I’m so excited for you to be the next president what trump has done to us is a shame my family is voting for you from Minnesota ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Imagine if trump said this.......
Kare11 are you going to ask sunrisers what they think of Biden’s incredibly racist comments yesterday?   Or does that not fit your narrative?   If trump said these words I can only imagine.....,.
Willing to lie to Congress. Guess he’s qualified to serve in the trump administration. Vote for Biden and get rid of all of these guys.
He does realize that people will not vote for even if it means 4 more trump. He acts like we have to vote him or else.
He has his faults but please admit panda bear that trump is not good and the Republican Party needs to find an intelligent moderate candidate in a the future.    Trump is really dumb... for real
No, never Trump doesn’t mean never conservative! The current Republican Party is a disgrace with no backbone and no integrity! They have turned their backs on what’s best for Americans, forgot to do their jobs to keep their jobs, so they should lose those jobs now!!!
Oh, you mean the party that has allowed Trump to piss all over the memory and legacy of your own father? Is that the one?
Trump is bitter about the Tulsa rally where his campaign team got played by the  younger TikTok crowd. The is about vengeance and having to do it before the election. He can’t have a repeat, and needs to control the younger crowd from using this platform for getting out to vote.
You’re being quixotic: A vote for anyone else is a vote for Trump.

He’s super Catholic, but yeah I’m sure he’s against GOD. What a terrorist trump is. Seriously.
Tough topic, no denying, but Trump has yet to address Russian Bounty-Gate with Putin which possibly killed US Soldiers, Taken Zero Action on COVID = 140k Deaths and stating "It is what it is". When George Floyd was murdered by a cop, he condemned #BLM &amp; gave cops $69 Million
That’s really not very nice to show this picture (i mean to the viewers. I don’t give a shit about Trump’s feelings).

What isn’t working is the vision of cutting taxes &amp; shrinking Medicaid and Medicare that Trump and McConnell and McCarthy push.  Trump is hoping the ACA will be overturned in the courts in which case 23 million more lose coverage &amp; pre-ex conditions aren’t covered. 12/
We had some mechanisms in place Trump decided to ignore.   The ACA created insurance exchanges &amp; Medicaid expansion to cushion the blow for people losing converge.  The Trump Admin refused to allow them to be used &amp; GOP governors refused to expand Medicaid. 5/

2 days ago: Trump: "Mail-in voting is evil and fully corrupt!"  Today: "If a state has Republican governor, it's all good and safe! If it has a Democratic governor, it's ripe with FRAUD AND DISASTER!"  It's funny to watch his lies morph in real time.
Everyone remember that the Republicant covid relief bill includes funding for a new FBI building across the street from Trump's hotel. He wants this new building built so that a competing Hotel can't be put there. Plus there's all kinds of funding for military spending.

My God, you are SOOOO ignorant. Trump is also very against blanket mail-in voting.  He is fine with absentee ballots, which have to be requested, but sending ballots to everyone? When dead people in Nevada have their radical children vote for them it's going to be an epic scandal
Hunter had a job with a private company. Was he overpaid ? Probably. If that is illegal we would have to arrest most of the CEO. ‘S in the country. The trump spawn on the hand....

“Saving 75,000 lives is not as important to him as his self-image, his lifelong mantra of never admitting mistakes, and his desire to avoid even the hint of accountability for whatever we need to do.”
Swan: “Mr. President, Ghislaine Maxwell has been arrested on allegations of child-sex trafficking.”  Trump: “You don’t know that.”  Trump continues, “Good luck. Let them prove that somebody is guilt.”
Trump's actions make clear he believes Latinxs should be treated as second-class citizens.    knows when the Latinx community succeeds we all succeed. His agenda will empower Latinxs in Minnesota and make them true partners in charting our future.
Trump has no ability to do so but election officials in a few red states will give it a try. Watch Florida, Georgia, and Texas in particular.

Dude, Trump is like 2 1/2 years younger. I’m not gonna worry about it. What Biden has going for him, however, is that he’s not a fascist piece of shit.

That's my plan if Trump wins another term. I can cross the Canadian border with a car full of Dot's Pretzels, right?
Classic trump behavior. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

Trump, a buffoon: voting for a Catholic who rejects Catholic teaching hurts God....errr, not exactly right.  Biden, who should know better: performs gay “marriage” ceremonies and is cool with Abortion, including the kind that is literally torture.
Lol, I love it when Democrats lose their shit when Trump says something stupid. We don’t really care cuz we put not our trust in [princes]...

There has never been a communist government but in name only. Communism does not work for humans. All attempts at communism have ended in totalitarianism. All. God help us rid the world of all forms of totalitarianism. God help us from tRump. If there is a god in this chaos.
Actually, Trump said everything would be back to normal by Easter and Jared followed by saying we'd be rocking by July 4. We seem to have missed those marks.
Let me get this straight. ⁦ ‘s Chief National Security Correspondent writes a book about ⁦ calling him a madman.  Real objective! How could this “journalist” ever be seen as anything other a Trump hating hack?  Fake news sources too
Trump is ramping up his ad buys on #Facebook. His ads have included false content. Facebook can't be trusted to do the right thing. Feds must investigate and act!

If you thought trump couldn’t be any dumber pls watch this
he should still be allowed to greet Trump imo
Or... if you want to look closer to home, think about all the many consumer products that have been recalled because of lack of safety or possible illness or death since Trump stole office.
Oh but i do. Biden's a fucking trainwreck. Trump's a fucking dumpster fire. What i don't get is how people can be excited by EITHER candidate
Trump people...smdh.
With 'Trump' Republicans you are either with them or against them. They don't care about the United States, they care about their party only. Cowards.

I’m not sure any of them are ever qualified. Position has gone to supporters of the elected in past. The education system was screwed up well before Trump or Devos came and unfortunately, it will be just as bad when they leave.

And yes, I said without looking up. Don’t come back to me with a name. I am completely disappointed with the education system but it sure didn’t start with Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton etc.  they are all to blame.
If you can tell me who the last 3 secretaries of education were before Betsy Devos, I’ll buy into it. The facts are, you can’t. Sure, you can look it up but BS if you can name them. My point is, nobody cares (unfortunately until Trump chose) who sec of Ed was

Why most of these trump supporters be talking like they on FaceTime 25/8 wit Trump himself😭
What she said is that voter fraud is statistically insignificant.  The odds of voter fraud is 0.00006%.  You have better odds of getting hit by lightning than voter fraud.  Plus you and trump aren't even quoting the nevada law correctly.  Get your facts right and stop lying.
He’s staying quiet so all the focus is on the idiotic things Trump is saying. He doesn’t even have to try to win at this point.
They will go down with the tRump ship and continue  gurgling their support for their orange fuhrer
At this point, I am wondering if Trump is working for CoVid instead of Putin
Trump has a foundation line and I just can’t
There is this app or whatever that supports Trump or something it's called Parler.

Of course Biden is in mental decline...he's a terrible candidate to run for POTUS.  Which is WHY Trump should be ahead in every poll, but he's not.  The handling of COVID will play a big factor in determining this election, whether Trump fans want to admit it or not.
Trump has turned them into a cult. My  replies been flooded since last night because I simply said Biden is probably going to win.  They have to be blind to see they are jeopardy of losing in Nov.
Trump's Schick is his constant bragging and self praise.  We've been dealing with a pandemic for months now, with no end in sight.  Let's get rid of COVID, before we brag about "poll numbers". That's what turns ppl off.

How’s that Trump healthcare plan coming along? He said it would be ready in a few weeks several months ago. All that time he spends watching tv could be time better spent. I get it there is no plan, never was, never will be.
No, Trump doesn’t have any qualifications either. That’s why the country’s gone to shit.

Sorry but U.S. Politics is a two-party system. A no-vote is just as good as a vote for someone who supports abortion up to the point of birth. Trump may not be a stand-up guy..But abortion has no grey area. So every prolife person can either choose a vote for life or for murder.
being a black muslim in texas during the trump era really does some shit to you

Can you admit Cuomo had a horrible response as well as Trump, because I can
Just another Trump supporter trying to make everyone question the election results this November. If we lose faith in our elections, then there is no USA. This is exactly what our adversaries want and we have people in the U.S. doing their work for them.
My thoughts as well, there are enough things to hit Trump with, this ain't one of them
I have no idea where people come up with the idea that Trump will "destroy" Biden in a debate. Trump says stupid and insane 💩 repeatedly and almost every day.
The even cringier part of that is when he says he will let the American people judge his "physical and mental fitness" and can't even get the words out of his mouth with bumbling. It's even worse that Trump isn't much better.
Donald Trump interviewing himself. Incredible!
President Trump Names Pro-Life Leaders to Panel Investigating Aborted Baby Part Sales
You won't be laughing when Biden wins.    and before you call me a "libtard", I voted for Trump and I support a lot of his policies, ie: 2nd amendment, lower taxes, less govt restrictions.  Unfortunately, his schtick got old a while ago.  The support is gone.

Biden should refuse to debate Trump.   How can you debate someone who lies constantly and refuses to engage in any reasonable or coherent dialogue..  Biden should just stay on his own course of rebuttal to Trumps BS and provide direct feedback to honest journalists.
I hope China calls in the loans that Trump owes them. He'll start a nuclear war to not repay them.

Anyone involved in this from the Trump campaign had better lawyer up and fast. There are going to be indictments come February. Lots and lots of them.
I came to Twitter to watch Trump implode. So far it's been a big success. The side benefit is the camaraderie and reading posts from really well informed people. My big secret is that my granddaughter opened this account. Fishy and Jacky are her cats.
Forthcoming is a DNI statement “only candidate Trump is receiving help at his request for Russian influence and has actively sought foreign influence from other adversaries of the United States of America.”  Where’s  statement regarding vote by mail sabotage at USPS?

1) You're right  2) I want you to know the impact your book "Unholy" had on my mentor in ministry. He's a brilliant guy in his 70s and is suffering slings and arrows from his circle for coming out against Trump. He said your book was devastating. He was shaken by reading it.

right advisors. People see Biden as a safe bet. While Trump is volatile.  All that I’m trying to say is that people across the spectrum are just exhausted with Trump/Trumpism and that’s been reflected by the way people feel about Biden and this upcoming election.

Biden should not debate trump. He doesn’t need to because so far he seems to be doing well in the polls. Only trump stands to gain from a debate regardless of how awful and stupid he acts.
Trump can’t even acknowledge that people have died because of COVID-19. Instead, in his deranged Trump-Latin, he says “We have a 140,000 people at this moment. This is a very very serious situation.”

I sometimes wonder if Trump intentionally mispronounces things to distract from his abysmal mismanagement policies.  Mostly I don't think he is sharp enough to be doing it intentionally, yet nonetheless the distraction factor persists.  #WaggleTheDog

I’m sure that’s true but based off of polling, even with the recent slip, Biden is doing really well. Yes I realize that polling isn’t everything and the pollsters got it wrong in 2016 but 2020 is different and Trump is running a 2016 base turnout campaign that won’t work as an

I don’t disagree that obama built those cages, he’s a war criminal and did so many shit things, but the way trump speaks encourages the separation of this country, we’ve NEVER been more divided than we have now. he’s the worst president we’ve ever had.
Was never where? You’re the only one calling victims liars here. There are dozens of women coming forward with claims against trump and you’re calling all of them liars, why?

Well..there was birtherism/the Central Park 5. Oh and Trump was defending the confederate flag not 3 weeks ago...I think what Biden shows with this apology is that he can at least account for his actions.
And Donald Trump is never going to walk out of the Oval Office. We will need a military coup to overthrow him. But likely the military will cave to him if it comes to that. Because of a list for power. Anyway. Just spend time with your family and spread love.

Yes, indeed it does. But the rest of Obamacare is an absolute catastrophe. Trump is saying that he’ll get rid of that travesty and replace it with something that ISN’T intended to destroy, and that the new plan will cover pre-existing conditions.
Trump is completely in competent.  He is corrupt beyond belief.   Everything he does is corrupt.
Thank you Eric!!! I love Victor, but I love your principles too! It's so true that people need to wake up, and see what is happening, right in front of our noses! Which is to say, the US going down the drain, thanks to Trump!
Lie, cheat and ruin the postal service, the only way Trump knows how to play.
Trump’s partial solution to the economic crisis is to end the payroll tax. How does this help the 32 million unemployed? If you’re not getting a paycheck, you get no benefit. A very stupid plan—doesn’t do shit for them. But business gets a windfall with temporary tax holiday.
I think picking an all male ticket would’ve been a bad decision. Not having a woman help beat Trump after what happened to Hillary would’ve put turnout at risk.   Though I do think he needs to pick a woman of color.
unindicted co-conspirator with Cohen is trump ...   Here's the proof
It also feels like the GOP was supposed to come away with nothing accomplished so Trump can swoop in with executive order and look like he solved everything.
Bwahaha, hes so dumb  "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
only if I wanted to survive .... and I didn't have trillion$ of reason$ not to  go ahead, keep asking questions like this and see if pig 🐽 jack and his turquios-haired militants don't ban you 🤣😂🤣👍  Trump 2020! KAG 🇺🇸
Trump politicizing COVID is why so many people like this have died and will die
These woman are waiting on you, Trump...
Oh goid grief!  Look at EVERYTHING Trump has said and done and leave Joe alone!  Joemeant no harm, he apologized and yet the media is crucifying him!  Build the man up and stop making this negative!  Go after the racist Jerk in the WH😡😡😡
I can’t prove it yet, but I’m quite sure this is Trump’s fault.
The short little guy with purple shorts is a Trump supporter....
Just having a trending hashtag with the name Trump means he's still more popular. Lol #ThingsMorePopularThanTrump
After 2016 I’ll never trust polls again.
Although the two clowns are disappointing, the future of our country is at stake with another trump presidency. Voting third party is just a vote that isn’t defeating trump
You're. Comparing. Trump. To. Lincoln. Turn in your "I'm an idiot" card in at the desk and just go away.
There's Something About Mary Trump #MorePoliticalRomComs
I think it could be working! tRumps response to COVID deaths "it is what it is" displays pure evil. I think tRump is Satan.
Trump dishonors the dead.   He dishonors all those, who’ve given their lives to sustain our country.
I'm am more smacking my head about Trump trying to pass one , that already is law.   Did no one tell him, or they know and just think their voters are dumb as rocks and won't notice.
How could any Trump victory in November be accepted as legitimate at this point?  If he wins, we'll have but two choices: 1) accept despotism and await our stolen country's inevitable collapse or 2) begin an interregnum on our terms &amp; hope its survivors create a new republic.
There are many ways to skin a cat, but you first have to agree the cat needs skinning.  Problem is, Mitch McConnell has ceded all his authority to Trump Administration and Donald went golfing and Mitch has been solely Laser focused on changing the courts into kangaroos.
I love journalists who take random potshots at us, instead of actually being strong and resolute against Trump.
great🤣😂keep saying sensible things.. and the rotten puke in SDNY is going to demand hidin' biden's financials 🤣  just kidding, that NY hack is a dem establishment... puke graham will do REAL subpoenas before 'they' look at any dem traitor  TRUMP 2020! sick of the establishment
Don't believe it for a minute.  Hillary was projected over 300 in August too. We all know how that went. Polls still aren't adequately representing Trump supporters
Another Friend of Trump.  I think we’ll better understand all of this upon reading Michael Cohen’s book.
OR they are worried about the possibilities of what he could do. Not as in “Trump will get the US in a war with China/Iran” but more so Trump is taking back what America has given up. Manufacturing? Oil? I honestly don’t know. But it does make me think.
Ok, so now what? I haven’t been a huge Trump supporter(he needs to learn to shut up) but to me this says something. It says that a “formerly” communist country and a country that is unsafe for travel from the US are worried about what Trump has done already for the US.
Perhaps Trump himself will vote for Biden. That way it can be unanimous.
So true. Makes no sense for veterans to support Trump. He’s stood idly by as Putin pays bounties for dead American soldiers. He’s blasphemed Gold Star families &amp; mocked disabled veterans. He’s driving the VA into the ground. And, Trump’s a fucking unpatriotic 5-time draft dodger.
What does supporting Donald Trump have to do with your qualifications?
Opinion | We are only beginning to suffer the consequences of Trump’s failures
Can Trump sign the $1,200 checks too?  Does Nancy realize that if this goes through she specifically stepped on the thing that would legitimately help the most people?
“You’ve got more questions?” Biden said in May. “Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”
Trump Admin lawyers are in court right now trying to strike the pre-existing condition protection from the law, dodo.
Trump is so sick in the head.
Only by 50? That means 25% support Trump. Seems awfully high.
Of course he’s not worried about their legality. That’s Trump’s M.O.
Trump is a traitor that does not belong in the White House let alone allowed to stay in this country!  But I do want to him and others go to prison...I can’t wait!
Somebody needs to do something about Trump.
This is what Trump would do if he could to his enemies.
Trump is that one person who hasn’t contributed to the group project, but nevertheless wants credit for it.
Trump LIES
Breaking News: Trump invents Obamacare after spending years taking it down. What a visionary
America is waging war on Trump and the republicans!  We’ve had enough if their lies, greed, and corruption!  Vote blue straight down the ticket on 11/3/2020 and we’ll WIN our country Back!
Trump supporters are gullible and stupid!  They just eat up everything he says whether it’s true or not!  That’s very disturbing!
tRump, that's who.
😂What? Why? Who...? Yeah, of course more popular than Trump but who would do such a thing 😯 🌭 🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭
[in my voice] In that sense Operation Slow Mail is kind of weird, like lots of people are gonna get mad, but how does that help Trump? As  put it "this thing that used to work well now doesn't" is not what an incumebent would want to run on.
Trump gonna go to prison!
Trump barred Epstein over a real estate deal. Not for recruiting on Mar-a-largo property.  But I m sure that Trumpers know this, which is why they refuse to talk about it.  Cowards.
Oh, dear!   The only place for this loser to go would be to trump’s cabinet!!   Probably to lead the country’s morals!    😂😂😂
😂  It is funny, you think that trying to insult people by pointing out they are angry with Trump is hilarious.   It also shows that you don't GAF about pedophiles or trafficked children, you just want to use these victims to attack politically, which is the most cowardly of all.
That's a sparse crowd for just any  place. Especially your own club. If that's Trump's, that place should be packed to the rafters. Looks like they scraped a few suckers having dinner, and some late foursomes from the bar. Sorry guys. You gotta listen to  Ouch.
You've a bunch of unprofessional whiny babies who have lost their way.  I can't wait to see who Trump picks for his next two SCOTUS picks.  I will celebrate your loss with each landmark he makes.
If it’s named for Donald Trump, the cargo hold should be searched for hookers and cocaine.
Trump is a WAP
He literally said 'If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black'.
Trump is the product of white male backlash against Obama and Hillary. Men who are so obtuse and so insecure they feel that because Trump is a white male, he somehow represents all white males and is thus inexorably representative of their identity and value as humans.
That would still be 3 million + Americans you and trump are on the road to killing!
I also don't understand why he keeps defending and wishing a pederast pimp "well".  It baffles me that Trump is so protected by his followers as he is DIRECTLY implicated in pedophilia.
Oh, I believe that as well, which is why he dies in Trump's DOJ custody and all the footage was erased after Barr visited him. Burn all the pederasts, no matter politics, that includes Trump, who was accused of raping a 13 yo girl WITH Epstein.
So Trump is using a executive order to stop himself from removing coverage for pre-existing conditions?🤔 #TrumpHasNoPlan
If the USPS is good enough for the Trump “signed” stimulus checks, it’s good enough for mail-in ballots.  #EndTheNightmare
Uh, those with the face masks...please step to the back of the room... you're ruining  optics. He needs folk willing to risk a little #coronavirus, especially with their young kids, for the privilege of seeing their president for $350K. Is Trump worth it? Uh, no
Trump's Idiotic (and Dangerous) Response To Beirut Explosion  via    #UnfitForOffice #GrifterInChief #idiots #gop
Frankly, when has Trump told the truth? Why can’t we just assume he’s always lying (or doesn’t know what he’s talking about)?
This is truly a reflection of Trump’s America.
promised a substantial amount of capital to unseat Trump. I haven’t heard much about that. Not that anyone would need to advertise how badly this administration is doing. I can only assume he is saving his war chest to pay for the postal service to keep running.
Who cares? Didn't you see trump tonight? That was an abuse of power and we should be demanding an investigation!
She has reported nothing about president trump multiple false claims he made during "white house" presser  his own golf club house national tv.
It's like Trump got a huge bingo card of every type of human and one by one is throwing a dart thru each one. His latest weaponizing of the military against peaceful protesters and letting Putin murder them... nobody is safe. Not even those required to wear a gun. Sad. #Maddow

trust is a funny word 😂  you're saying you're not making hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars "trusting" bill gates and his tax-exempt org?  fauci, on the other hand ... I've wondered  Trump 2020!
And for the love of all that is holy, if you are planning on voting absentee and haven’t put in your application yet, apply NOW.   Think of every day you don’t have a clear voting plan executed as an endorsement of Trump, cause that’s what it is.
Hahaha. Coverage of preexisting conditions = OBAMACARE, also known as the ACA, which trump gov is suing to eliminate. You make us laugh.
I'm sure you realize that Trump is going to step in and use exec orders to give US very little of what we need but he'll play there hero and people will believe him bc we're desperate for anything right now! This is bad
We the people will not be censored. Social media will continue to favor Trump because it's not in their financial interest to do otherwise. Right   ?
America is sick of Trump. America needs to get their act together and elect Joe Biden who will once again treat Canada like the best friend that they have been for over a century.  We have a moron right now who thinks Canada burned down the White House.  We can do so much better.
Whats this guys point? Trump Speaks the Truth 👇
Trump is as cosmopolitan as a 10 piece chicken nuggets with ketchup is gourmet.
The uk. But that’s because they are run by pale trump.
tRump is a lying con man  He’ll do and say anything to get re-elected  As the date gets closer  tRump will get dirtier
same for many of us... Also found out that Trump is basically saving the planet. #Itsaboutthechildren
You mean the part of Obamacare that trump is currently suing to get rid of? That part?
Lolz of course he’s lying. Anyone supporting Trump is a liar by nature. Generalization, I admit, but damn prove me wrong.
Sacrifice your lives for the economy! Sacrifice your children! Sacrifice their teachers! Sacrifice their families! You all must bleed for our god, The Market. This is the opposition to Trump’s proto-fascism. The system is all going to come apart.
I could vomit. Trump ignores Russia wanting to pay for dead American soldiers. That could be my neighbor, my son.  #RussianBountiesOnOurTroops
The thing about criticizing Biden is that nothing he’s done hasn’t already been done to the Nth degree by trump
A lot of that was the myth of electability. And I stand by this... had 2020 not been slammed by protests and a pandemic? Trump would beat Biden. The pandemic, massive BLM protests (with Americans starting to side with BLM more) &amp; the economy tanking are what pushed Biden higher.
Trump wants a white ethnostate. There’s no other reason to do this.
Faint but present and proud. The brief storm delivered a rainbow over this non-mask-wearing, Trump-banner-promoting, South Dakotan crowd and we felt the love.  ❤️❤️❤️
but Trump approved it anyway... which is why neither Popeo or he are saying absolutely nothing at this point #TrumpKillsUSTroops
I mean, on the one hand good that Trump has finally learned this is important (sad it took so long and so much fucking damage to the country). On the other hand, it’s already law so... has a president ever tried to sign an EO on something *already law*?
Is #MoscowMitchMcConnell intentionally screwing over the American people in a desperate effort to make #tRump look like a hero with executive action?
Something tells me a decent % of Trump supporters believe that pre-existing conditions weren’t protected until Trump’s executive order. They didn’t know that pre-existing conditions were already protected with Obamacare.
Trump campaign:  “If Trump wins, he will do all of the things he promised to do in 2016. We need four more years because we couldn’t govern for the first four years... we never learned how.  If Biden wins, however, things will be just as terrible as they are now.”
BREAKING NEWS: Trump announces that he will require all stop signs to be red.
Considering  has lawyers accompanying Kanye’s paperwork to file, that’s a big yes. Just another way Trump is working to undermine the election.
And she’s pedaling the Trump line - pure nonsense - that mail-in-voting, on a scale necessary to shield voters from the virus in this time of a pandemic, will lead to voter fraud. Simply shameful.
Do they have any AI weapons we can't defeat?? 🙏 Praying for Trump and his patriots in the inner circle
Trump is going to pull a George Costanza: show up for "work" despite not working there..

Ahh, Thighland as Trump might say.
Trump wants to rule the free market through fiat.  And Trumpers cheer that, with 0 irony.
Trump is trying to destroy the USPS within because he knows he is going to lose. He is trying to delay the inevitable.
I like that "twitter docs" are chiming in.  I also like how Trump fans are all about a president influencing the free markets through fiat...I am sure that you will continue believing that with Joe Biden, right?
Trump’s executive order will create a retroactive payroll tax cut. Payroll tax cuts rob Social Security of its funding and push it towards benefit cuts.   #NoPayRollTaxCut
Someone needs to say to trump “you’r fired”
If he were 20 years older, and if his cheeks weighed 20 pounds, and if his eyebrows were 'drawn' to the top of his forehead ..we could call him pelosi  ..but he didn't spew commie ideals and he didn't slur 👍  He's Donald Trump, President of the United States of America 🇺🇸 KAG
This was 6 weeks ago.  Trump signed an executive order to protect preexisting conditions.
Trump's EO isn't enforceable. That's what is just pathetic.
Trump smashes wheel to invent wheel.
A fake account used to go at Trump. Let me guess you are old man rivers account above us. SJWs= anyone that disagrees with us is a bot. Yet y’all make fake burner accounts😂
Newsflash- Wisconsin is going to slam Trump in 3 months. #Maddow
Its so weird Trump claims liberals are snowflakes.#maddow
Look... you vote a guy like Trump into office and of course he's going to treat his power like a concierge service.
The Secretary of State doesn’t send out ballots, county officials do. Second, the slow delivery of mail has nothing to do with the Secretary of State or county officials, but is an exec agency. Trump’s just fired the top two officials at USPS.
I said violations of the Constitution will be rejected. Do you not realize we live in a Constitutional Republic? Have you no concept of States' Rights? Oh, man, if Trump had done that, guess who'd be screaming "Dictator!" and trying to impeach him for it?
Genius Trump. First Grande Generilisimo not taking orders from his wife. Breakthrough.
Federal Troops Tear-Gas Yankees Off Field So Trump Can Throw Out First Pitch
LOL! Well, then I am waiting for the uproar from Trump and his followers to go after the Bundy's, you go ahead and let me know when that happens...
Remember in C-Ville when a RW terrorist killed a woman and Trump said they were very fine people? I do.
Read your column and I want what you’re smoking.  Instead of reinventing the GOP, why not let independent Republicans create a new party separate from Trump and anyone like him.  New party, new people, new ideas.
Also guaranteed coverage alone is bullshit and will mean that a lot of people with pre existing conditions pay more for insurance than if Trump left the law alone.
So, Trump went and tried ruling via fiat. His EO is about as worthless as everything else he does.
Well - there goes tRump taking credit for a law Obama put into place!!!  Nice try little orange man...
Trump is trying to take credit for President Obama’s achievements.
We don't need Russian intel on how fucked up trump is: he opens his mouth everyday and the entire world can see it.
I like that “Half-Whit.” Trump would not approve and that makes her #1 in my book.
This is concerning about the USPS. Another institution Trump is trying to destroy.
Can you provide one single reason to vote for Biden without mentioning Trump? I wonder
That is mind numbing. The plotting and the greed is truly unbelievable. Glad Trump has 900 Trillion in the 5 Star Trust.
SHAME: Thanks to Trump, McConnell,  Senate GOP lackeys, we’re sliding into an economic depression that will be worse than GOP Pres. Hoover’s 1929 Great Depression. — “Avoiding Hooverville: Why We Need to Extend and Reform Pandemic Unemployment Insurance”
Then he said something about peaceful protests also being exempt, which sparked a lot of laughter, and then Trump looked really confused.
Someone asked a question about the lack of people wearing masks in the press conference room and there was a round of boos. Then Trump explained they're exempt because it's a political event.
That would be members of his golf club. That’s trump - keepin it classy
LOL "Trump says."    This was always the dream, that he was so unbound by rules that it somehow would benefit normal people.  Stop falling for it, he's not doing any of this.
Trump can't even stoop without falling over, he ain't gonna swoop
With Tiger pretty much shooting himself out of contention, I would like to see Haotong Li hang on and win because I'm sure it would piss off Trump. #PGAChamp
How's about answering my question?  Trump rallies are the Federal gov't encouraging people to gather in large groups w/o following safety protocol. That's a very different situation from individuals choosing to march in the street. Rallies= state action. Protests= private. See?
There should be a fleet of reporters tracking disruptions to: Prescription meds delivery Business payments delayed Mishandled critical documents like driver's licenses So that we see ALL the terrible impacts of Trump's corruption
Check the death rate and get back to me. Positive test cases don't count. Then tell me what you think Trump should be doing that he isn't already. Solutions involving violations of the Constitution will be rejected.
Donald Trump? A lame fuck? Of course. He's been a lame fuck his entire miserable life. Just ask Stormy.  What? Lame DUCK? Oh. Yeah. That too.  #DumpTrump #GoWithJoe #VoteBlue #VoteBlue2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Trump history ... George Washington crossing the Delaware river.
Is there anything you’d miss about Trump if he were to lose the election or say, you know, disappear without a trace?
Yes because close to 75% of Trump’s “followers” are bots from Russia - the same bots that interfered in the 2016 Election and got Trump elected
Great example of  point that Trump "lies like the proverbial used car salesman" that is all politicians fudge stuff but they generally want to build real relationships with voters, the press etc so don't go crazy  Trump just says whatever to "move the lemon off the lot"
I have a feeling with Trump saying that Biden is against God and who will hurt God is going to bring out his anti-Muslim bigotry with the election coming up.
i agree with trump ending this terrible fucking facade of "SJW". but this Twitter account should not be this fucking biased. It's the goddamn White House. not Republican House.

The palpable reek of Trump's desperation...
Winner! 😆👍 Meanwhile libs will walk around saying Trump hasn't done anything for them.
Where are the closed captions for those of us hearing disabilities?  Trump mumbles too much to accurately read his lips.  #HearingLoss #HearingDisabled
Trump said he'll sign an executive order stopping the IRS from collecting the payroll tax that funds Soc Sec and Medicare.  Don't worry about it. He can't do that. He's just trying to distract from what an incompetent and narcissistic asshole he is.
Trump Hat?
A silver lining to this Trump disaster is that his Presidency has exposed the weak and the strong among us. I'm not going to define who are the weak and who are the strong. You already know the answer. Do your thang on November 3rd, whatever that may be.
Gotta keep spreading the word. They will switch sides. Give them time. Trump knows what he's doing with these executive orders.
No no no!  Congress must enact this, if at all.  Trump must not lower himself to Obama / Walz El Supremo behavior.
Like Trump?
nearly four years of "THE BI-PARTISAN ESTABLISHMENT' shenanigans and theatrics.  Now, in Aug 2020, productive PATRIOTS put hope in DOJ's guy durham 🤣😂🤣  In Borat's immortal words: "Ich don't think so."  100% Trump 2020! to hell with rotten gop dnc .. not with the curse
Yeah it did. Democrats are directly responsible for every death they blame Trump for.
trump is gone ... the senate on the republican side looks like a bunch of dead men walking
He and trump will be able to attend the same .... well u know .
They think Kanye is going to take votes from Biden. Nope. He’s going to get the freak burn-it-down vote that Trump got last time.
Trump can't reduce the payroll tax all by himself.
Are you joking? Not only does Obamacare already have this, but Trump supports a lawsuit that is trying get rid of this. As we speak.
When Trump wins I may cry tears of joy for the first time in my life! 🥳
Never Trump actually Never Drain the Swamp!
If I understand correctly, Trump just gave Americans Obamacare, which they already had
💯❤our Freedom loving President Trump!!  STOP CORONA FEAR. #TrumpLandslide2020
Donald Trump Will Protect God from Joe Biden!!  via
More and more #FemaleVoters, including increasingly Republicans, are concluding Trump and his failed leadership cannot receive a second term.
Thing is, Republican Allie’s against Trump are not really allies against anything else. They are not useful beyond attacking Trump. So let them do it. Just don’t lend them support.
Transfer student who didn’t mix with others. BA in real estate. No awards, publications, honors. Has always lived in Trump cocoon.
Exactly!! I am glad you see this too, but people who follow tRUmP want to blindly believe that he is magically fixing everything in their favor.. making their lives better.... it is just re-election gravy to cover up the chaos he has created. They believe the lies #DumpTrump2020
The lineup already has me thinking of buying some tickets maybe have something to look forward to hopefully an end to the nightmare we have been living since Trump became president from COVID-19, police brutality, racism, murder, cover ups, etc it's time we have peace &amp; some fun
between the dudes at trump's golf resort and sturgis we're doing literally the opposite.
Are your referring to Pres Trump?
Trump says he's issuing an executive order requiring insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions.   Can someone on his staff remind him that since 2010 that’s been the law of the land thanks to OBama’s ACA. Trump tried repeal it for years.   He is nuts
Trump Crony: “Mail delivery? We don’t need no stinkin’ mail delivery...”
Journalist points out how many people are dying from COVID and people aren't wearing masks, Trump attacks him to cheers from the rich people audience.  And we're done.
trump gives the game away pushing the China, Iran part of the warning from #ODNI. This shithead is a Russian plant and our intel community is compromised. #trumppressconference #trumppresser #Bedminister
Trump's dismissed Congress and will govern by executive order going forward.
This is really the hill you're going to die on? What the fuck is the matter with you? NOBODY - even people who hate Trump - CARES.
Fine the club members who are violating the state mandate. Punish the club owner (I guess that would be trump) for not enforcing a state mandate (shut the club down).
That is the Trump base....
Remember just because Donald Trump says something doesn't make it true.  Often it is not.   Listening now to him speak at Bedminster for example.
If you want to keep watching President Trump, tune into  since FOX just went back to programming.
Trump doesn’t believe in trials.  He should just be assumd guilty and given life imprisonment without parole or worse.
Is the collapse by design?  Trump is struggling in the polls an EO would give him the opportunity to claim he is doing for the people what congress couldn’t.
Trump pronounces the "t"
I saw lots of the state’s mandate being blatantly violated by club members a d blatantly not enforced by club owner (trump)
God help us if one debate or even three convince enough people to re-elect Trump. It’s been a disaster by any measure.
Is something HUGE about to happen that caused trump to create such a bizarre distraction?
So basically, many of the things that POTUS refused to comcede to Democrats in negotiations, Trump is unilaterally imposing.
holy shit the Destiny vs Kim Iversen debate was so embarrassing. Imagine claiming to be an environmentalist and saying Biden wouldn't be better than trump. mask off baby lmao 🤡
Fearing coronavirus and missed classes, many parents prefer mixing online and in-person school, poll finds
Trump now turns to #portland
I dunno if you meant to tag me in this or not. I'm a democrat. I'm not a huge fan of Biden. I feel like Biden was really the LEAST we could do when it comes to progressive candidates, so I as a Dem really am kinda like whatever. I think its more interesting for no trump repubs.
So it's Russia vs China/Iran over who leads our country. 😕  U.S. intel: Russia trying to hurt Biden, but China, Iran don't want Trump
The election will take place largely through the mail, so Trump has suddenly moved to take control of the mail. Dictator stuff.
Trump blathers a lot so I don't know if this matters....but it could matter (if the Trump Admin dropped their lawsuit about taking away people's health care that would be a big deal!)
Fewer Trump voters come November 3...
Trump’s buddy is running the United States Postal Service now and is slowing down the mail. He is trying to destroy publc confidence in that important institution.
That is the sexiest lineup of beer belly’s I’ve seen since the State Fair.  You think any but those goombas are bragging about being members of Trump National.

Trump may be promising to extend unemployment till end of 2020 (though I don’t think he can do that) but I’ll fall over if that means any additional money for anyone.
Trump comes out for covering pre-existing conditions, this is interesting, he's the administration is currently suing to have SCOTUS throw that out.
Meadows walking away gives Trump the opportunity to do his EO and claim he’s doing something.
Thank you   for not showing Trump’s “presser” live. Much appreciated. Also...I LOVE your new show - congrats!!!
Look at it this way: Fewer Trump voters come November 3rd.
Just so we’re all on the same page, COVID isn’t going away, and Trump is holding the country hostage because he doesn’t want states to be able to pay first responders.
Trump seems like a man out of gas, like just exhausted.
Would be interesting to know Trump's concept of God. I think it's this: 💲💲💋💋🍗🍗🍫🍕🍩🐱🐱
Best line: “extending eviction moratoriums until there are no mor evictions”. I think Fred Trump’s dead carcass just exploded.
Trump announcing: -Payroll tax relief for the rest of the year retroactive to 7/1 -Extend unemployment through 2020 -Defer student loan payments until?? -Eviction moratorium  Sounds like this is a forthcoming exec order?
You should be asking why the democrats are using republican dark money groups like the Lincoln project to attack trump while they capitulate with every demand from the trump administration. You are being gaslit by friendly fascism.
Meadows blocked all of this so that Trump could grandstand on orders that may not even be able to take effect. Oh. And somehow the Tennessee Valley Authority worked it’s way into this mess too.
Trump just stated once again that half of American counties had less than 20 cases last week. There are counties in Minnesota that probably only have 20 people.
I will donate $100,000 to the NRA and $100,000 to the NAACP if someone can get Trump  and Pence buddied up on The Amazing Race.
I hold fast that being on the right side of history matters. As future generation look back  this the very dark period of trump's presidency wouldn't you be saddened that no one exposed the gop party betrayal to US Constitution &amp; upholding their Oath to public office?
Trump is rambling again
So it's Trump for another 4 years? Is that what's trying to be accomplished here?
Trump has 17 supporters left, don't worry about it...
I don't reguarly watch these but Trump seems kind of out to lunch.  Also did he just say unemployment payments will be extended? Someone please tell his party in Congress.
Trump slammed for hypocrisy after saying Biden is 'against God' - U.S. News -
YAAAAYYYYY! Fewer Trump voters come November 3rd!
After Trump said that about enemies. I get worried about watching him now.
Complete opposition book against Trump posted online .
Yea the whole world is in on this big hoax to help stop trump. Lol seek help!
Since when are Trump's critics "poorer, less educated, and ... have not left their home states?" I thought his critics were supposed to be all coastal elites. D'Felon is not just wrong, he's not making any sense.
Trump will be the first president to go to fucking prison, and he should, because he is a fucking criminal....

I find it weird that they listed Trump as President Trump, but they simply gave names without titles to all the others
How convenient that Trump appoints another crooked crony this close to election.  Unbelievable that the nonstop corruption is being allowed.

i.e. it's not that Trump lies all the time - it's that what he says is only related to the truth insofar as it serves him.
I like how his lyrics have so thoroughly confused you, that you can't see the conflict in being a trump supporter and listening to his music. Is Rage Against The Machine your second favorite band?
At $100 bucks a head ($50 for kids) Trump has made some serious bank for the US Treasury. Yeah, who am I kidding, he's already got the money stuffed in a bowling bag. True Mobstah style!

Where everyone gets  President Trump wrong.  Almost every politician I know pretends to be nice in the public and they are a complete jerk in private.  President Trump is the opposite.   He pretends to be a jerk in public, and he would give you the shirt off of his back.
Sounds right. California having trouble under Trump, so let’s re-elect him! Maybe California will get help in 2025...
Is this “Thighland” business with Trump a Hillary cheap shot? Wouldn’t put it past him.

tRump's incompetence killed 160K Americans and ruined the economy, pushing millions into poverty. He is working hard to ruin the landscape and decrease the quality of air and water.  needs to go away.

You're absolutely right. We're concerned with the Trump Virus.
But, according to Trump: "It is what it is."  Over the last 7 days, "a grim new COVID-19 calculus has emerged: one person died every 80 seconds from the coronavirus in America.  "And the pace at which those 7,486 people died appears to be accelerating."

For me, it’s day four waiting for covid test results, no word yet. Trump has slowed down the testing, that is his plan.  If we base school openings on Covid test results, and the test results take a week or longer:   Then it is Not responsible to send your kids to school.
I read this as “pool” having a totally different meaning and thought “thank goodness. 2020 can’t handle Trump by the pool.”

We will be in the streets under the Democrats just as hard as the right. Liberals are  a far right party run by the same money that put trump in office.  Friendly fascism is here and we must resist it at all costs.

Well, I don’t love either; however, at least Biden actually has a solid written plan on issues such as LGBTQ rights, Climate Change, and improving health care to some degree. When we equate Biden with Trump, we accept them as equals, when one is clearly better.

Apparently, he continues to try to legislate through executive order, although he hasn't published it so who knows what is says...

It also provides an option for Trump to accuse China of having stolen the election in November. He could ratchet up tensions even more and create chaos during the transition period.

Just this week Trump has talked about Yo-Semite and Thighland.
Didn’t he say that about the MLB? Maybe he said it for all sports I don’t know,  but yeah why would he even think trump would watch the NBA, especially now 😂

Trump said Beirut was a bomb and that kids are immune to COVID-19 so I wouldn't listen to what he says.
While still about 50 points too high, this is actually a catastrophically bad number for Trump.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 he’s against god and he’s against guns... I love how Trump took all the dumb dog whistles and stupid lines the GOP spent decades crafting... then he just dumbed them down so much he’s just saying what he wants people to believe

Hey, I won't claim to know the future. Biden is terrible, so despite how bad Trump is, he could still win.  That said, Trump's approval is plummeting, and he is losing in the vast majority of polls. Not just by overall percentage, but state to state he is losing.

Make America Great Again. Indict a Trump
You’re right to an extent. Polls can be misleading and it’s foolish to rely on them alone; however, Trump’s approval is about 41-42% right now. For him to win with that low of an approval rating would be historic. For contrast, he has 45% approval when he entered.

Yea it would be worse. We would have millions dead to the pandemic because she wants to be politically correct. We would be at war with North Korea and Iran and China and especially Russia. We would still be in Afghanistan only more bombs would be dropped than Trump.
2 days ago: Trump: "Mail-in voting is evil and fully corrupt!"  Today: "If a state has Republican governor, it's all good and safe! If it has a Democratic governor, it's ripe with FRAUD AND DISASTER!"  It's funny to watch his lies morph in real time.

My God, you are SOOOO ignorant. Trump is also very against blanket mail-in voting.  He is fine with absentee ballots, which have to be requested, but sending ballots to everyone? When dead people in Nevada have their radical children vote for them it's going to be an epic scandal

One final thought on the Axios interview: If there is one thing history will neither record nor remember about Rep. John Lewis, it will be the fact that he skipped Trump's inauguration.

Jason doesn’t have any policies, he copies them all from Trump.
It's only scary to me that someone who seems reasonably intelligent like you can actually buy in to all the media propaganda. Trump had done an amazing job with the economy until the virus hit.  His running the country like a business has been successful, and yet, you want Biden?
The Republicans have always supported the rich and big corporations while the Democratic’s care about the people! This GOP along with Trump support Putin!

Only until Biden’s inauguration. I fear what Trump will try to do to punish Americans after the election and before he gets dragged out of the White House
I love when Trump tries to use facts. It’s a nice change from the usual unsubstantiated ramblings (i.e. lies) but never ends wells.
What do you want proof for, moron?  I stand with Trump for self-reliance, small government, rights of the unborn (mostly minority) babies, strong trade deals, and strong national defense.  You stand with democrats to get "free" stuff.
It's like just a statistic to trump, nothing more.
Okay idiot.  AFO is a 747.  Trump's personal 727 is being used by his company while he serves the country.

Trump NEVER filed PERSONAL bankruptcy. Filing a bankruptcy for six of his dozens of LLC's over several years is a common business practice. Attempting to expand your brand (like My Pillow towels...) is also a common practice.  Trump has forgotten more about business than you know
What Trump has done to ruin the United States' relationships with it's allies is incalculable, insulting, and just straight up embarrassing.

America was already divided before trump came into office, you can thank Obama for that. Secondly, between the two candidates trump is the only one who has an ounce of patriotism or have you forgotten that Biden signed the death warrants of the entire unit of SEAL team 6.
YOU said the rich get richer and the poor get nothing.  That has nothing to do with the current Chinese virus killing people or resulting unemployment numbers, but Trump will bring the country back in a way Joe has NO CLUE how to accomplish. GOP only blocked socialist legislation
Actually Obama appointed her, I'm sure she's afraid she'll lose her job if she contradicts Trump though. Self preservation rather than dokng the right thing.
Since Robin Williams, Don Trump has hands down been the best comedian ever!

I have enjoyed how  has slowly turned Trump press conferences into FJM columns.
In a recent article by John Wesley Reed, he argues that Christians can &amp; should vote for Trump because it's abt policy over character.  Which to me means "hey, we know he isn't a Christian, but we are getting what we want". It's all an act.
I recently had an MRl of my brain and they found some concerns, so tomorrow I go for some neuropsychological testing. I suspect at least part of this will involve the same test that Trump “aced”. I’m scared guys, what if I can’t remember “person, woman, man, camera, TV”?
America is broke, jobless and can’t pay their rent. Trump has a press conference at his country club with club members there to ....cheer him on?!? This scene is appalling.
I mean, seriously? This guy had to believe he was Teflon. To actually Tweet that Pervy Photo out is not just a bad judgement call, but....wait. Doesn't he support Trump too?
The red rash on my ass is called Trump virus, can we have a news conference on that? #DonnyDumbass

US reaction to this virus and future ones is all about Trump - and defeating him.    On second thought - maybe it is left / totalitarian opportunity to completely control our  lives and drive us to socialist secular humanism and enviro extremism. Scary if true.
This also assumes accurate polling with equal amounts Dem and Rep respondents. Also assumes that conservatives would truly admit to voting for Trump which most won’t.
Trump must be responsible for this

I hear you. I've got no representation in DC other than Trump. Both Senators and my Congressman are all libtards, it's pathetic.
You'd think Trump would've made people allergic to anyone who starts sentences off with "A lot of people are saying ..." But we still see pundits on both sides do this all the time.
Like everything managed by Liberal Elites, such as our universities, the behavior being exhibited is a lie! To be honest, the signs should read’ “We don’t want Trump for President.” Instead, they have been taught to lie, cheat and claim this is about a virus. Defund Universities!
During the Swan interview, tRump said he was never briefed inre to bounties on US troops. If tRump had been briefed, he said he "would have done something about it".  He then said many ppl didn't believe the report was true. So why would he act on a false claim?

EXACTLY, I was confused to read how it was possible to be for anyone to be confused here?! Obviously, the blond is a flag-waving, God-fearing Trump lady, who treats wearing a mask with ironic disdain!
And Obama has no hand in the economy handed to him, but yet you blamed him. Trump spent 2 trillion in debt driven tax cuts for the 1% BEFORE Covid
Can we stop waiting for the magical moment of Trump “getting it”? It ain’t happing folks and it won’t happen in his supporters either.
And yet, pretty benign compared the terrible words that come out of Trump's mouth on a daily basis (that conservatives have turned a blind eye on for 3 1/2 years now...)
He Predicted Trump’s Win in 2016. Now He’s Ready to Call 2020.
Trump has ruined a great economy like he ruined everything else in his despicable life.
I will hand deliver my ballot if necessary.
My point is he's not broke Barry and I know he doesn't give a shit, but I'm sure he'll donate to Trump's reelection fund. Feed the rich kill the poor ☹️

He thinks he's Tom Brady, 4th quarter 2 secinds to go frim midfield.  Calls the play that leaves his teammates with her head scratching.  Ball gets hiked and he takes off and runs with it expecting to score from 50 yards out with 42 year old legs... Trump you better add 30 yrs on
Trump could win if  thing.  Show hard evidence that what the media puts out there is FAKE.  Think how many people would swing.  But he doesn't have it so he diverts your attention to try and get you to believe because he can't prove with facts so he makes stuff up, that simple

Maybe because Obama wasn’t an sob. I think that Trump proves his disdain for all Americans every day. I can’t applaud your pride in restraint on this one.
Oh, Trump is ready to send anything Beirut needs.  Apparently willing to send them anything, but fuck the blue states who are really struggling with their budgets.

So Dumb Donald Trump' said horrible things about Americans threatens violence because they peacefully protesting peacefully, called them thugs and criminals. Did nothing even addressing a rising death toll due to the Trump Virus.  In order to combat him show him vote Biden
One wonders if Trump's favorite part of the job — indeed the part of the job that he wishes were the whole job — is a part of the job that actually isn't part of the job at all, which is commenting on television ratings.
Crime is increasing in major cities in the Summer 2020, but no need to worry about that because this is an election year and defeating Trump is important!!!  I honestly think it is important, but the Democrats aren't good at multitasking so we probably will only hear tidbits!!!

I'm looking it up...its not a Trump wine is it? lol
They should thank Trump for the $600/wk in enhanced unemployment benefits they got so the could sleep during the day and riot at night.  Ops money ran out on July 31sr lol. Doh!

i follow trump and kaitlin bennet for MEME PURPOSES ONLY i swear omg please dont think badly of me lmaoooo
US reaction to this virus and future ones is all about Trump - and defeating him.    On second thought - maybe it is left / totalitarian opportunity to completely control our  lives and drive us to socialist secular humanism and enviro extremism. Scary if true.
This also assumes accurate polling with equal amounts Dem and Rep respondents. Also assumes that conservatives would truly admit to voting for Trump which most won’t.
Kanye West should be ashamed to support a xenophobic racists! He evidently believe in the kkk theories that God made them superior to all others! That is absolutely  Asinine! He supposed to be a preacher_Really!?

I hear you. I've got no representation in DC other than Trump. Both Senators and my Congressman are all libtards, it's pathetic.

Correct. They are dinosaurs! Big bird is using to fool you so they don't lose their business. They are also in cahoots with the anti-vaxxers and after funded by the lizard people. Trump appreciates then but doesn't outwardly support the lies of big bird

it’s the “not being a trump supporter” but still planing on voting for him because you refuse to vote blue for me
One wonders if Trump's favorite part of the job — indeed the part of the job that he wishes were the whole job — is a part of the job that actually isn't part of the job at all, which is commenting on television ratings.
Crime is increasing in major cities in the Summer 2020, but no need to worry about that because this is an election year and defeating Trump is important!!!  I honestly think it is important, but the Democrats aren't good at multitasking so we probably will only hear tidbits!!!
Biden is too chicken to tell this directly to Trump in the debates.
It’s amazing to see the amount of questioning a BLK women goes through. Pence, Trump liars and no one goes in for the truth.

We’re going to impeach the President. Shit! That didn’t work. We’ll blame COVID results on Trump. That isn’t working! What’s next?
Actually, I don't affiliate with either side. I do agree more with the left currently but Trump has done a couple things I agree with such as increased military spending and transparency in medical bills...
Patriotism does mean standing by the President and secondly, I may be wrong but I believe Trump will win this year and YOU are pissin’ into the wind.
Exposing the blood to ultraviolet light isn't putting lights on the inside of people...lol Trump's answers to questions about the Stormy affair were lie after lie after lie regardless of Avenoti. Honestly, anything Trump says has to be checked...that's just a fact ☹
Schmidt is a weak sister! So glad he wasn’t my dad since he has no core principles and is easily manipulated by teenagers. He’s not teaching younger ppl anything but give up—give in. Just like the Dems &amp; lefties &amp; anti-Trump ppl have done with CCP,Iran,NKorea—all these years!
Both. I agree with most of the actions taken by the Trump Administration. Further, I don't know how anyone of good conscience can reward the Democrat party for, among other things, the Russia collusion fraud by voting for their candidate.
I'm referring to Trump's flat out lies...that are too many to count 🙄 I guessing you believe everything he says...like most Trump supporters? ...and I know Obama isn't without any lies, he's a politician, they all lie.

This is the first time that Facebook has removed a post from Trump entirely.
Think you should be more worried about what trump is going to do with you
How is Biden a liability. Biden is 77 and Trump is 74. If ones a liability then so is the other one. Got to blame the voters for not endorsing a younger candidate during the primaries. It would be nice to have a President that can't get AARP.
Hope the trump spends ample time in prison
In an abrupt reversal, President Donald Trump is encouraging voters in Florida to vote by mail after months of criticizing the practice — and while his campaign and the GOP challenge Nevada over its new vote-by-mail law.
Trump has destroyed us in so many ways. If Trump wins again America will be so destroyed that we cannot fix it ever. Do not vote Trump. Vote for fixing America that means NOT Trump. Look all the 4 years of destruction.

Trump's base are the only people who take him seriously. The rest of us tune him out except mostly to make fun of him. So his claiming that vote by mail is fraudulent will hurt GOP turnout. This has apparently occurred to someone with the president's ear.

Well, rub my nipples and call me Sally...  P.S. - Dont we’ll both end up regretting it and crying in the fetal position by tomorrow   NY prosecutors say Trump investigation extends beyond hush money payments
This is about Biden’s faculties. There is no doubt his heart is in the right place.. but, just as much as Trump has baffling, narcissistic quotes, some videos of Biden are he can’t finish his train of thought. Like, he is really losing it. His VP candidate will be important.
And like I myself would discourage people from donating to the Lincoln Project or any candidate who primaries Trump (back when that was happening.  Signal boosting is fine but I dont because I’m afraid people will actually donate to them.  Real world politics is complicated.
I’ve been thinking of this myself. Plenty of people on the left spread really nasty lies and smears against just about every dem candidate and politician this past year.  Then they get mad when dems come out and like moderate Republicans who actually spend time attacking Trump?
Like we got trump out here talking about it

Sure.  Let’s not do what the rest of the world did to slow the virus.  You totally owned the libs by doing the opposite making the virus worse.  Can’t wait until you find out what happens when trump attempts to postpone the election
I agree. But I also think Dems are often too busy fighting each other to focus on the real problem. Even before Trump. Republicans otoh find a common enemy &amp; are unrelenting in their attack. Trumpists went too far defending IMPOTUS &amp; now find themselves on the receiving end.
Are the Democrats doing anything this good? If we get Trump out of the White House, we will owe it to Republicans of conscience. I only wish there were more of them:
Remember when one party wanted oversight on where the money went and trump had a trump fit and threatened to take his ball home?
Lawmakers reported progress on a huge coronavirus relief bill Saturday, as political pressure mounts to restore an expired $600-per-week supplemental unemployment benefit and send funding to help schools reopen.
Trump will not cancel the election but expect him and republicans to use all the skeasiest voter suppression means possible.  Chaos will be enemy number 1 going forward.

I always said he never wanted to win in 2016 either.. and would say stupid stuff going "They will never vote for me now"..  well they did..  who knew.. but remember there is a hidden Trump vote out there, so be leary of the polls if Trump is within 5% of Biden in any poll.
That is not leading. That is doing nothing. They could just eliminate her position. She is a Trump lap dog.
The most amazing thing about Trump handling Coronavirus is that if he just followed what other countries did and we were out of it by now, his poll numbers would have skyrocketed. Handling tragedy always boosts numbers, and he still couldn’t even do that.

Is it allowed under the USMCA?  I thought it wasn't... which would mean that Trump just violated his own trade agreement, which he has touted as how crowning achievement...

It's because Minn. came closer to red in 2016 than we had in years. I live in a St. Paul suburb and my neighbor lady - Boomer, no college degree, white - is a Trump fan. She also has not let COVID-19 alter her lifestyle one bit. Her family and friends are same. Red MAGA hats.
nope, but Obama did.  While the world was in lock down he went out and golfed.  Trump has golfed a few times but not during the lock down...it's called exercise.  How can you blame the virus on Trump?  He was called a racist when he tried to keep it out of the country by Biden.
This is not a fact yet.  Though I agree with your statement on Trump.   The simple truth its too early to say what happened.
Trump treats all women dismissively. He has some real mother issues.
Trump can’t stray too far from his panic bunker. And DC should have the police and national guard out in force to protect the massive protesters against Trumps secret police.
The Trunp organization taxes will show where he spent his money. And if there are other Cohens out there he is reimbursing. Those people are the ones with the direct payments. The National Enquirer has a safe full of Catch and Kill stories they held onto.
Cohen responded to The New York Times on February 13 that he paid Daniels the $130,000 from his own pocket, that it was not a campaign contribution, and that he was not reimbursed for making it by either the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign

I agree, I watched the Maria Farmer interviews with Whitney Webb and with Shaun Atwood and all Maria Farmer said about Trump was that he eyed her legs and she only saw him the one time at Jeffrey’s office.

We're not the only 2 country's that do.
Since everything in the MSM is fake to tRump and his supporters. I have an idea, what if the MSM started saying that he's a great President 🤣? Maybe they'll vote for Biden. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Trump has a MASSIVE  clusterf*** on his hands. COVID out of control. Schools in chaos. BLM protests everywhere. He has NO idea what to do. Vote him out.
Are you suggesting that there is a global conspiracy to cover up the spread of COVID-19 for the purpose of… making Trump look bad? Such a cover-up would exacerbate the spread in those countries. You're saying they are deliberately helping kill their own populations for politics?
7 minutes into the interview he tells trump 1000 are dying per day.  Trump: "They are dying its true but it is what it is"
Because trump is a degenerative piece of shit.

Biden was my LAST choice of the Dem candidates. But a boil on Biden's ass would be a better president than Trump.
He did a photo op at Walter Reed a month ago.
When the results do not match the exit polling he will get his folllowers in the house and senate to not certify the election (which has never been done before).  He may try to get the SCOTUS involved like W did. Or he could just start Trump TV on Jan 21st. It’s easy to criticize
You mean how the guy who just took over the postmaster general donated to Donald trump? The same Donald trump trying to push back elections? I repeat, you want to act like the postal union endorsing Biden is bad while ignoring that the guy in charge of mail supports corrupt trump

And Wiener is a known scumbag, and has been since long before your anonymous supposed soothsayer came along. Trump is also a known, lifelong scumbag, but, due to obvious mental deficiency, you gave him a pass.
He is just one in a very long line of Trump sphincter-polishers.

Yes. Neither Biden nor Trump is articulate, but Biden isn't a racist, xenophobic, misogynistic fascist.
I wish NOBODY was guilty of this. It'd be super great of the world weren't lousy with rich, powerful predators. Maybe Trump shouldn't have been so public with his admiration of Epstein.

tRump's ordered his Post Master General to slow down the mail because he's afraid of mail in ballots. Can those who get Meds in the mail file an injunction againts this Tyrants orders?
Yes.  Absolutely. Although I highly doubt Joe would be the one to refuse since he has a great respect for convention and tradition.  Not to mention the fact that he'd mop the floor with trump!
Trump has managed to kill far more Americans than he did.
trump’s priorities are Shit.
Since he never planned on actually winning he was right. I think he wanted to be the voice against hillary on Trump TV. Instead every president can say the they are doing better than Trump.
I loved my Constitutional and Administrative law classes taught by Professor Bosworth at Winona State University. The demand of the Supreme Court right now is imperative with Trump in office. Looking forward to listening to this new podcast Strict Scrutiny!
😂. Good one.  Saw this video of a Trump supporter playing hockey...
He has his own plane. If Epstein's plane can land on the island, so can Trump's.
First Callen’s show schooled cancelled now this happening to him, all after he blasted the Liberal Left and said he would vote for Trump on the JRE fight Companion
MSM yesterday: "There are no riots. There are just peaceful protesters being brutalized and disappeared by Trump's secret Nazi soldiers!"  MSM today: "Okay, fine. There are riots. But..umm...uhh...Nazis did it!"
He’s a liberal troll trying to make Trump supporters look bad.
I lv President Trump n will always support him. But madam chairwoman plse pay attention to RACES around d country n don't allow GOP candidates 2 lose. In this climate, there is no reason a GOP C should lose. Peop hate Dems policies,  know they cannot lead, etc so, take advantage.
Do you realize spawn of Trump that most NHL players are not US citizens.   Also very few black players that hail from the US that are affected by the issues that are being protested.
When Reagan was President the wall came down in East Berlin. Trump put one up around the White House.
I’m proud to be endorsed by Vice President   While in Congress I worked with the Trump Administrstion to bring meaningful change to ALL Minnesotans!  But the work is not done, it’s time to retire  and deliver for the people of MN!
2020 COVID under Trump - Republican response ‘NO BIG DEAL .. 150,000 dead .. NO BIG DEAL’  2014 Ebola under Obama
I really wish Trump would contract COVID-19 and die from it but I also just want him to live in embarrassment for the rest of his lame ass life. I’m truly in a pickle ...
Oh I don’t know. Election night 2016 was pretty magical and I didn’t even vote for trump. Lol
Trump was impeached and left the White House 5 months from now.
Trump changed his party affiliation to Democratic. In September 2009, Trump changed his party affiliation back to the Republican Party. In December 2011, Trump changed to "no party affiliation" (independent). In April 2012, Trump again returned to the Republican Party.
Like his wives - he changes political affiliation. Trump registered as a Republican in Manhattan in 1987 and since that time has changed his party affiliation five times. In 1999, Trump changed his party affiliation to the Independence Party of New York. In August 2001,
Trump is literally only 4 years younger than him
Bet you $$ the fucker still votes for Trump. Republicans are all fascisistic fetishists.

I know. I see a lot of tRump in my ex Son In Law.
No. But tRump works a hell of a lot less than the average American.
It's now the TOP. Trump's Owned Party.
We didn’t call the other countries shithole countries We didn’t want that raggedy ass fence We didn’t even want trump’s stupid ass. I’m not about to let the rest of the world disrespect and shit on me or feel less than because of this fucked up goberment.
trump can F_ _k  up a wet dream!
Was a senior in college. Class, bar, tacos, beers, voted for the Body. Not pround in retrospect.   He was similar to trump though, in that they lack the self awareness to understand they were/are Fing up
BOTH THE TRUMP BOYS ARE MURDERS!! NOW THEY'RE KILLING ANIMALS THAT ARE GOING EXTINCT!! PIGS!! 🐷🐷💩💩
How about you give your opinion on his attempt to seed the ground to stop the election? You won’t. You and those like you are so far gone that there is literally nothing trump can say or do that would make you say anything about it.
This is how fucking incompetent Trump is. Even if there is no election his. Term. Still. Ends.  The only hard deadline spelled out in the Constitution is the end of a president’s term and a vice president’s term on January 20 of the year following a general election.
O MY GOD YOU ARE NUTS trump! LOL
If you happen to see the Trump tweet about delaying the election.  Report it.  Twitter has an option to report tweets that are harmful to the election and/or mean to suppress voting. ~my dope english teacher with a priv acct so i cant retweet from him directly.
tRump.
Sadly a lot of liberals I know think all the evil shit he does is a conspiracy theory and they all believe dr fraudchi and gates smh they don’t trust hydroxy and they blame trump when he sends in feds it’s insane how brainwashed people are it’s hard to even talk to them
I didn’t blame it on trump i blame it on someone who didn’t take the virus seriously and it cost him his life. Trump supporter or not.
Trump  John Lewis funereal is today why didn't you go?
trump is one sick  puppy!:
Trump wants to delay elections but open schools? How does that make sense?
No. No no no no. Goddammmit. This is so wrong, everything about this is wrong. DeJoy is Trump's lackey and they are running with Plan B.
96 days left. Trump wants to delay the election. Contact your representatives and senators and let them know this should NOT happen.
What the fellow from Utah fails to grasp is that the election would not be 'rolled out nationally' - each location would have their own local election. So if Utah can do it, any place can do it. And this article fails to mention the zinger - TRUMP VOTES BY MAIL! Safer that way.
Herman Cain, RIP. His death sits squarely on Trump’s shoulders.
And there it is. Dictator TRUMP. You are going down this November. I hope you have to be dragged out of office. 150,000 dead, millions unemployed, no consistent leadership, and an economy in the tank. How much more winning can we take? None under your watch hopefully.
This op ed by Stuart Stevens really hits home.
Trump your full of S*IT!Travel ban from China was inadequate; COVID was already here.  Compare what POTUS did vs leaders in Canada, New Zealand, Norway, etc. Trump did little nationally because he thought it was going to hit Blue states the most. He figured let the individual governors take the blame.
One would think so!  But there are too many cult followers and idiots out there who follow Trump's every word.  It's just so sad.  And aggravating.
Not well.  If Trump wins in Nov, you might see a lot of folks at your southern border submitting urgent immigration requests.
Trump is starting up more trade-war nonsense with Canada.  A worldwide pandemic with 1000 people dying a day, and he finds time for an ill-conceived fight with with our neighbors!   #CantWaitUntilNov3
Didn't Trump just sign an executive order to do that himself???
Trump. Tariffs have devastated  American farmers too. Trump doesn't know nothing about economics. Trump.  Made sure when he chose his administration that they would be loyal and incompetent just like himself!
Perfect evidence that Trump has no idea what ObamaCare covers and no idea why he is challenging it in court.  BTW, the hurriedly-scheduled "Press Conference" was held at a Trump golf club and began with the playing of "Hail to the Chief."  #DidISlipIntoAParallelUniverse
Trump wants a Prime Time TV show alright.  But I want to believe he'll be too busy with his lawyers preparing to defend all those state and federal charges that he should be facing.
You know that the Republicans didn’t agree because they knew they would make Trump look good before the election. Democrats May have just lost November... He’s gonna eff this royally.
Trump could sign an executive order granting the right to bear arms, and his followers would applaud.  #CultOfPersonality
What kind of parallel universe have we slipped into?  Dr Fauci should listen to Donald Trump?????
Yeah...and added applause by his followers after Trump signs an executive order granting all citizens the right to bear arms.
Such ignorance!  Trump and Company have no clue what provisions are in the ACA.  They are not policy guys.
Yeah but trump wants the help so.  Quandary
America.  Now that Kanye West is entering the presidential race all the Republicans should vote for West over Trump! He'll make a better president!
Trump never had a clue what the ACA covered or didn't cover.  Appears even his spokesmen aren't big on details.
The administration is already struggling to deliver the mail.  How is centralizing power around the Postmaster General (who got the job because he was a Trump donor) going to help get the USPS ready for an increase of vote-by-mail business this fall?
When Trump says he'll defer "payroll taxes" through yearend, it effectively "defunds" Social Security. The GOP will then want to reduce benefits because they'll say SS funding is inadequate. There are better ways to give the American people a financial break during this crisis.
Sadly, there are people out there who will think Trump actually did something substantial here.
Trump Republicans are pretty damn racist to even do this.
Trump.  Think that when he does an executive order. He'll be the savior that swooped in and saved the day! So , remember America.  When you come up short on rent or mortgage. It's all Trump fault. Stop supporting fools like Trump and the Republicans leadership!
Trump.  Supporters must realize that the Republican failed policies affect them too. Why support a political party that have chosen to let your family starve.
If Trump cared about security measures in the USPS, he'd order the Postmaster General, whom he appointed, to get things in order.  DJT promised he alone could fix things.  If the administration can't deliver mail, how can it manage far more demanding responsibilities?
In a recent article by John Wesley Reed, he argues that Christians can &amp; should vote for Trump because it's abt policy over character.  Which to me means "hey, we know he isn't a Christian, but we are getting what we want". It's all an act.
There have been so many great Time covers during the Trump regime.
Dozens of Trump's Bedminster club patrons in their shorts and golf attire in the room.  Probably held more for their enjoyment than to deliver substantive news.  They even began by playing "Hail to the Chief."
Repeal and Replace trump's executive order.
Trump has no clue what's in the ACA.  He's just against it because Obama was for it.
I recently had an MRl of my brain and they found some concerns, so tomorrow I go for some neuropsychological testing. I suspect at least part of this will involve the same test that Trump “aced”. I’m scared guys, what if I can’t remember “person, woman, man, camera, TV”?
Repeal and Replace trump's executive order !

Teri Ann, it's being pitched as a "press conference" and the Press has been called in.  But clearly it's a Trump performance for golf club friends.
Tbf, Biden's main platform is "I'm not Trump" so they're both doing it
Cult of personality.  Trump's supporters aren't listening, evaluating, considering alternatives, etc., the way you and I might form an opinion.  That's why arguments, charts, statistics, and facts won't sway them.  He's their guy and that's all there is to that.
I mean, seriously? This guy had to believe he was Teflon. To actually Tweet that Pervy Photo out is not just a bad judgement call, but....wait. Doesn't he support Trump too?
Giving a speech or news conference from a Trump resort is illegal and definitely a conflict of interest! Trump must pay for his own TV. time . Not on the  taxpayers dime.
America.  No matter how many gaphs Biden might make his heart will always be in the right place. Trump.  Is a cruel and evil man and so are his supporters. They all need to be brought down a notch! ROME IS BURNING!
The Republicans created the Trump movement. They tried  to illegitimize Obama and legitimize Trump for years.  The Birther movement, the republicans did nothing. All that racism for a racist to takeover over the republican party. ROME IS BURNING!!
Friday.  Someone in the Trump Admin should be “resigning” any moment.
America. Are we to believe that a stupid  and irresponsible man , like Trump could bring  down democracy all by himself? Not possible.  Trump.  Have plenty of help to become dictator of a country that he have little heritage in being a part of. ROME IS BURNING!!
If Trump truly believed the vote-by-mail process was flawed, he'd call the Postmaster General he appointed into the Oval Office and have him fix it.  DJT is always talking about all the power he has; let him flex a little with Mr DeJoy.
Trump.  Is having a hard time attacking Joe Biden on any issue. But the Trump campaign is waiting to attack who Biden VP choice. Trump.  Have no plan!
You'd think Trump would've made people allergic to anyone who starts sentences off with "A lot of people are saying ..." But we still see pundits on both sides do this all the time.
I'm sure as hell not voting for Trump but I'm not convinced Trump beating Biden would absolutely be the ultimate end of America. We are stronger than that, if we have to live through 4 more years of orange, it'll suck, but we will prevail.
Ain't Got No Home - The Ballad of Old Man Trump  via
He described Trump supporters perfectly!
Trump took office during a time when much of the world was experiencing growth. The growth continued until the pandemic hit causing a significant rise in unemployment over the past 6 months.    This graph inappropriately suggests the president has a causal effect on employment.

These numbers are people being rehired back after losing their job. We still have over 30 million on Unemployment.  So no, Trump is NOT the Jobs president.  #buyabrain
Russians paid to kill American soldiers and Trump says and does nothing. But TikTok needs to be restricted due to national security issues??
It's tiring to see certain news networks.  Like fox news and others. Try to normalize Trump and his administration.  There's nothing normal about the bullshit that the American people are going through, with these crises that's  going on!
Trump.  Presidency is over. There's no re-election,  so why waste the time campaigning you only making things worse for yourself and the country! GOLF ANYONE!!
I just saw someone post the other day that went along the lines of "You need to vote democrat if you normally vote third party, because voting Trump out is more important than voting for your ideals."  Oof.
I do both. It's just easier to drag Trump since he's in office right now.
And also that they can attack Biden for "being senile". There are tons of other things that are WAY more valid to attack Biden on. Plus Trump's insistence that the 1918 pandemic was in 1917 is just... Weird.
Vote Trump and watch the black community prosper!  The Dems want to keep the black community suppressed because it buys them votes.   Wise up and climb out!! Vote Trump!

America.  Trump . Is breaking all the election rules. There's too many violation to count. There got to be someone to watch over all these violation.  Democracy can't be that weak and out of touch! ROME IS BURNING!!
Kanye West.  Is trying to obstruct an election in favor of Donald Trump. He's must be getting paid for his efforts.  West doesn't have a platform that he's running on at all. An investigation is in order!
Wherever Trump goes the virus will follow. People are gathering together just to see you pass by for a rally parade.  Irresponsible president! The Trump virus keep on spreading.
Trump. Is giving campaign speeches during work hours. What's this country coming too! How unfair is that. Using taxpayers money to hold a Trump rallies, is a campaign violation! Where's the republican outrage! Cheaters.
America.  If Trump would've never gave that rally in Tulsa.  Herman Cain would still be alive! RIP.
Joe don't blow it. That's what Trump is counting on. A desperate man will jump on every opportunity to take you down, and Trump is an opportunist!
Thanks, Mark, for the link to the full Axios interview.  DJT  talks about his ratings as if we're all just living in a Trump reality show.  He gets a kick out of watching us go crazy over his ludicrous answers. You called it:  "willful ignorance."  😷🌊

American's can still help even if trump is incapable.

Karla, I hope those you love recover completely.  💔 As for Trump, make sure everyone you know is registered to vote.  Talk about the election to 18-21 year olds.  Remind them they have the power to oust Trump with their very first vote.
Don the draft dodger certainly qualifies as a true American patriot. Too good for the draft. I might have been the one that replaced him and I was wounded in combat. Fortunately, the last person I would have wanted in combat with me would be Don Trump.
Biden easily. Trump just says insensitive shit. Biden legit has a racist past.
When Trump's father was in the early stages of Alzheimer's (&amp; Donald deeply in debt), Donald contrived to have a codicil to his father's will drawn up that would give Donald total control of his father's estate.  Fortunately, Fred refused to sign &amp; the scheme was uncovered.

I hope SC defeats Trump and Graham, but even if you don't in 2020, it is crucial that you *try.*  Dems will never break through in red states until we're seen putting up a fight.  Gotta get visible in the public square.  Be brave; be safe.
James, Get somebody busy with the 18-22 cohort!  Fresh new voters who can say forever that they helped oust Trump the first time they voted.  I live in MN, but I just sent your Democratic Party a little $$ to help. Hope others will, too.
Sincere question. At what point does a reporter covering the Trump administration begin to fantasize about catching Covid19 as opposed to having to hear him speak one more time?
Hate him all you want, he's not trump. Just remember that.
Unless I'm missing something, isn’t the GOP's effort for Kayne a full-on demonstration of racism? To help trump win, the GOP thinks it can play/dupe Blacks into voting for a Black guy that’s just not qualified. Blacks can vet candidates beyond just skin color. Disgusting. Come on
If another supreme justice has to step down for whatever reason that's one more person dump gets to pick and need I remind you his last one was a rapist who day one made it clear he supports trump (which those on the Supreme Court are NOT suppose to do)
I hate Biden but I'm still going to vote for him. Why? Because its going to be biden or trump and I for one don't want another 4 years of that walking shitstain destroying this country.  Also keep in mind its not just biden we are voting for -c-
Trump.  Is failing miserably in his re-election bid. He yelling out conspiracy theories and foolish lies. Even most of his supporters aren't falling for his shitless behavior anymore. ROME IS BURNING!!
People need to stop posting things about the shitty stuff Biden has said or done. Yes, we get it, he is not great by any means but crap like that is going to convince people to just not vote and every single vote not for Biden is one less trump needs to worry about.
It's obvious that the Trump administration want to hurt the school system, kids and their parents, by allowing schools to reopen. The most irresponsible president that ever sat in the oval office, only cares about his own self interest and those around him! ROME IS BURNING!!

Yes.  Especially Moscow Mitch, Trump's #1 enabler.  Everyone who can needs to support  (either in the ballot box if you live in KY or with a campaign contribution for those of us who live in another state).
I still think about the  article from last week that described a White House willing to abdicate all responsibility for COVID-19 to the governors, because they thought Blue States would take the hit.  Trump is still in an #AintMyProblem mode.
No doubt. Number 1 on my list that trump posted!
Jesse, those 7900 deaths per day didn't bring our economy to a grinding halt or stress out our medical and hospital communities.  COVID has.  To compare normal life span events to the morbidity and mortality spikes due to the negligence of the Trump administration is misleading.

Again he is projecting. Why would Democrats view this as a political win? People want their kids to be able to go back to school - safely.   The agenda is an R one. They think it will help reopen the economy &amp; reelect Trump. He just cannot grasp that a virus is kicking his ass.

Hugh, how have you bought into Trump? You used to have some decency.

Truly ridiculous. Because he’s trying to help the country against a virus? They think it’s some elaborate plot to destroy Donald Trump and will swear by that and call people fools who don’t agree. Who’s the fool? What sane person thinks a worldwide virus is a plot to stop Trump?
This is exactly the argument that several of my old college friends have used to explain why Trump &amp; the Rs "aren't that bad" becuz our lives aren't impacted. They are  white males who claim to be Christian, &amp; are incredibly selfish &amp; greedy. I can't be around them.
It'd be neat if that visual was aligned with reality. Were it to be a more accurate reflection, it would show Trump listing off a long list of things he wants with Pelosi following in her notes, "yes sir! right away sir! i'll approve that one immediately mr prezident!"
They didn’t, you know when someone takes that test it’s usually the people around that person that are concerned... trump asked Biden take one... by the way I am sure he already took one anyway...
He is trying to run out the clock.  Strategy seems to think that trump is going to beat himself.  For all trumps flaws exposed by a relentless media. This is exactly the same trump that ran in 2016.  There have been no surprises. Biden will need to stand up to beat him.
Black Total Level approvals strikes me as high for a GOP president.  Are there comparisons for other GOP presidents from Rasmussen?  If the African American vote shifts to Trump, by 5 percentage points or more, it seems like a no win for Biden.  What can Rasmussen share?
"Let's open all schools! Get the kids in the schools. They learn better there. They will be fine."  This is not a joke. If/When a child or teacher die, that life will be directly on Trump and other local leaders who pushed for this.

I will hand deliver my ballot if necessary.
My point is he's not broke Barry and I know he doesn't give a shit, but I'm sure he'll donate to Trump's reelection fund. Feed the rich kill the poor ☹️

America. Everything that Trump said with that sit down interview with HBO was an entire lie! Trump has a permanent script inside his brain, that unshakable. Which makes him a very dangerous man! ROME IS BURNING!!
Obama rebuilt the economy. Instead of using that economy and paying down debt, Trump increased it. He gave a tax cut to the 1% and paid for it with 2 trillion in debt. Yeah stimulus will heat up the economy...temporarily
...of course. Jumped on the trump train after I voted for Hillary in the last election.   I’m blown away at how much Trump gets done.
Trump will never ever be on the same level as Obama. Obama has intelligence,  empathy,  a soul, a heart....Trump is SO jealous of Obama.

It's a meme, but god damn was that axios interview good. Good in the sense that Jonathan Swan did a fantastic job exposing trump on his lies by stroking his ego just the right amount to keep him in the chair for the interview.
Last week POTUS wanted to ban TikTok.  Today, claiming "It’s an amazing thing, whatever it may be," Trump is happy for its purchase by Microsoft as long as the government gets a "piece of the action" (sounds like a bribe, no?).
Man, that Axios interview of Trump just decimates the POTUS, and it's mostly self-inflicted.

Can that Jonathan guy interview trump every time. I would enjoy that.
That is the goal of the trump administration is to devalue real estate and then have the banks and private groups buy up the city for cheap... they are ghouls at the White House...
Also,  earned a follow. His ability to concede small, little, non-material wins to Trump to boost his ego leading into the next bombshell question is great.
I mean, I didn't need to see this HBO interview to know how deplorable Trump was at being a President, let alone speak at a 5th-grade level. But this somehow, incredibly, is next level. Wow.
Here's an example...  Trump: "Many people are saying we're doing a great job."   "Who's saying that?"   Trump: "Many people."   "Right. But who exactly? Can you give me names?"   ☝️ That's the level hardly anyone reaches. But he has no answer if the interviewer gets there.
What's true about that Trump  interview has been true all along. 2-3 levels of follow up to a single issue or answer reveals the emperor has no clothes. And "who" "what" "how" and "why" are most effective to get there. (1/2)
Anti-Trump Republicans take the president’s newest campaign ad and throw it back in his face
Actually the most important election of our lifetime was in 2018 when a congress was elected that was able to put the breaks on the trump/gop crime syndicate. It's bad now but imagine where the USA would be if the majority in Congress hadn't flipped.
Trump.  Will never get on a debate stage with Joe Biden. Trump campaign is scared to death. They know Trump will fail miserably!
But let’s be honest, everyone on the campaign wishes Trump would stop talking because every interview provides endless footage for Biden and Lincoln to use in their ads
Trump.  Still trying to defend his incompetence and the administration botching of covid19.  America is headed down the wrong path with Racist Trump and Moscow Mitch leadership!
Nobody says bill gates is a doctor, trump is the one praising epstein and maxwell
Swan: Do you find (John Lewis) impressive? Trump: I can't say one way or the other.   Seriously?
Trump wasn’t the president of the United States at the time. Bill was.
Trump is so totally out of his league. Of course, we need to hear him, but why do his handlers let him go out in public?  was well prepared and just carried on despite the incoherent nonsense that flowed from DJT. Can you get a Pulitzer for an interview?
Most of us know the limit of our expertise.  Trump, though, is willing to go out and make a fool of himself anytime, anyplace, on any topic.  You and I know he’s out of his league, but what’s frightening is that 38% of the country thinks he makes perfectly good sense.
Investigating Trump.  Should be easy. Since he has been sued for fraud many times. In fact he's a fraud and his presidency is too!
Trump. Plan on immigration and DACA.  Is to have immigrants arrested and displaced out of the country. Trump. Plan for healthcare. Take it away and replace it with nothing! ROME IS BURNING!!
The Trump administration. Is becoming a real live creepy show. It hard to believe that Trump and the Republicans represent the worst of America! ROME IS BURNING!!
Trump.  Is in a dead zone.  He have lost his desperate mind. Trump.  Continue to abuse his power and misleading the American people, with false information. The Hypocrites of the republican party are helping him do it! ROME IS BURNING!!
I'll try not to hate, but Mitch McConnell bears much of the guilt for the mess we're in.  I'm not trying to absolve DJT of anything, but a good portion of Trump's agenda would have fallen into oblivion if we had a Senate Leader willing to provide appropriate checks and balances.
Trump.  Also said that he'll reveal his tax returns. Trump have lied over again about a healthcare plan, but never came up with one!  Trump.  Will lie about healthcare all the way up to election day! ROME IS BURNING!!
If the election gets delayed people must understand Trump’s term does not get extended:   To explain simply: Essentially with no election there is no HoR, giving the Pro Temp of the senate presidency.  With no election Dems have majority making Patrick Leahy of Vermont (Dem) prez
Don’t be afraid of Trump. We will wake up from this bad dream.
In his first address to Congress in Feb 2017 Trump promised to "increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare."  Instead, we got "American carnage."
I'm more worried about my ballot getting lost in the mail. Especially since Trump installed his guy to manage the post office!!
Trump lied.  What say you who proclaim to be a Christian??
Trump. Doesn't care about the soldiers in Afghanistan.  He have allowed Putin to put up bounties on US SOLDIERS! And no one has done nothing to stop Trump! ROME IS BURNING!!
Trump.  Gave Rush Limbaugh the Medal Of Freedom, for being a racist! That's all that Rush have ever done for society! ROME IS BURNING!Fam. Kanye west ALONE is helping Trump win. Biden finna get HUMILIATED n he deserve it. I truly wish we had better candidates in GENERAL!

Trump only wants to ban TikTok because the majority of the users on there hate him. That’s it. All the other stuff he’s telling you is bullshit. He’s a big baby. We know this.
“Trump utilizes fear-mongering in recent speech”
In carrying out Russia’s active measures, tRUmp is not allowed to criticize or challenge Putin directly. That is why he never has and never will.

Drug dealers don't vote for Trump
What a difference a crippling campaign makes. Though I bet the amount is not the $600.00 the Democrats were fighting to keep.
1) You're right  2) I want you to know the impact your book "Unholy" had on my mentor in ministry. He's a brilliant guy in his 70s and is suffering slings and arrows from his circle for coming out against Trump. He said your book was devastating. He was shaken by reading it.
And now I learned that Kanye has admitted that he is trying to help Trump win.
We've been living at our lake house in small town (3k ppl) North MN. Trump signs everywhere, 2 Biden signs in town. I've counted 16 Trump flags on docks; here's mine.   Haven't been back to house in MPLS for 3 weeks, so not sure about there. But I do have a Trump sign on my deck.
You support a liar a grifter and a traitor, a man so deprived he would fail to support our troops, our own sons &amp; daughters in the field, to even question reports that the Russians put bounties on them for fear of losing Putin’s support in the elections.
I’m against religion and want to hurt God. Biden has my vote, thanks Trump!
Trump just ordered her a get well card, shipped her a case of hydroxychloroquine and a personalized “Trump 2020” rectal laser light.
So true. I filed an adjustment of status in February right before the Trump public charge went into effect, but it’s August and still ..... nothing 🤷🏾‍♂️ I hope everything works out well for you, good luck !
2-3% of folks vote for Kanye as a joke, maybe serious, 10% of mail in ballots dissappear, large urban cities have minimal voting stations, and there you have your Trump victory.
Ilhan Omar has an immigration agenda—and it’s the opposite of Trump’s.  by
Man I can't wait to see how insurer's react to this one! Trump is really sticking it to them. They have NO IDEA what is coming. All to help his fellow Americans, such an incredible leader.
Thank you Eric!!! I love Victor, but I love your principles too! It's so true that people need to wake up, and see what is happening, right in front of our noses! Which is to say, the US going down the drain, thanks to Trump!
I can’t prove it yet, but I’m quite sure this is Trump’s fault.
Just having a trending hashtag with the name Trump means he's still more popular. Lol #ThingsMorePopularThanTrump
You're. Comparing. Trump. To. Lincoln. Turn in your "I'm an idiot" card in at the desk and just go away.
Trump dishonors the dead.   He dishonors all those, who’ve given their lives to sustain our country.
I'm am more smacking my head about Trump trying to pass one , that already is law.   Did no one tell him, or they know and just think their voters are dumb as rocks and won't notice.
I love journalists who take random potshots at us, instead of actually being strong and resolute against Trump.
Trump is a WAP
Trump is the product of white male backlash against Obama and Hillary. Men who are so obtuse and so insecure they feel that because Trump is a white male, he somehow represents all white males and is thus inexorably representative of their identity and value as humans.
promised a substantial amount of capital to unseat Trump. I haven’t heard much about that. Not that anyone would need to advertise how badly this administration is doing. I can only assume he is saving his war chest to pay for the postal service to keep running.
She has reported nothing about president trump multiple false claims he made during "white house" presser  his own golf club house national tv.
It's like Trump got a huge bingo card of every type of human and one by one is throwing a dart thru each one. His latest weaponizing of the military against peaceful protesters and letting Putin murder them... nobody is safe. Not even those required to wear a gun. Sad. #Maddow
Trump’s executive order will create a retroactive payroll tax cut. Payroll tax cuts rob Social Security of its funding and push it towards benefit cuts.   #NoPayRollTaxCut
Its so weird Trump claims liberals are snowflakes.#maddow
Well - there goes tRump taking credit for a law Obama put into place!!!  Nice try little orange man...
This is concerning about the USPS. Another institution Trump is trying to destroy.
Then he said something about peaceful protests also being exempt, which sparked a lot of laughter, and then Trump looked really confused.
Someone asked a question about the lack of people wearing masks in the press conference room and there was a round of boos. Then Trump explained they're exempt because it's a political event.
That would be members of his golf club. That’s trump - keepin it classy

Donald Trump Will Protect God from Joe Biden!!  via
More and more #FemaleVoters, including increasingly Republicans, are concluding Trump and his failed leadership cannot receive a second term.
The lineup already has me thinking of buying some tickets maybe have something to look forward to hopefully an end to the nightmare we have been living since Trump became president from COVID-19, police brutality, racism, murder, cover ups, etc it's time we have peace &amp; some fun
between the dudes at trump's golf resort and sturgis we're doing literally the opposite.
Trump's dismissed Congress and will govern by executive order going forward.
Remember just because Donald Trump says something doesn't make it true.  Often it is not.   Listening now to him speak at Bedminster for example.
I dunno if you meant to tag me in this or not. I'm a democrat. I'm not a huge fan of Biden. I feel like Biden was really the LEAST we could do when it comes to progressive candidates, so I as a Dem really am kinda like whatever. I think its more interesting for no trump repubs.
So it's Russia vs China/Iran over who leads our country. 😕  U.S. intel: Russia trying to hurt Biden, but China, Iran don't want Trump
Trump may be promising to extend unemployment till end of 2020 (though I don’t think he can do that) but I’ll fall over if that means any additional money for anyone.
Thank you   for not showing Trump’s “presser” live. Much appreciated. Also...I LOVE your new show - congrats!!!
Trump just stated once again that half of American counties had less than 20 cases last week. There are counties in Minnesota that probably only have 20 people.
I will donate $100,000 to the NRA and $100,000 to the NAACP if someone can get Trump  and Pence buddied up on The Amazing Race.
I hold fast that being on the right side of history matters. As future generation look back  this the very dark period of trump's presidency wouldn't you be saddened that no one exposed the gop party betrayal to US Constitution &amp; upholding their Oath to public office?
Since when are Trump's critics "poorer, less educated, and ... have not left their home states?" I thought his critics were supposed to be all coastal elites. D'Felon is not just wrong, he's not making any sense.
Thank you for not airing Trump's entitled entourage live! #ReidOut
Man of God right there. Just like Trump.
At $100 bucks a head ($50 for kids) Trump has made some serious bank for the US Treasury. Yeah, who am I kidding, he's already got the money stuffed in a bowling bag. True Mobstah style!
hey trump supporter..."I just grab 'em by the pussy" sound familiar???
Its the point that the "journalist" only decided to point our that russia may be working against Biden behind the scenes, and purposefully ignoring that fact that China may be working secretly to hurt Trump relection chances. The ethical reporter would cite both sides.
Sounds right. California having trouble under Trump, so let’s re-elect him! Maybe California will get help in 2025...
The SDNY is salivating w/Trump org info dredged up thru the Mueller investigation. Just like last time, he doesn’t want to be president, but this time, it’s serious.He’ll go to any length possible to secure a win.Completely agree. He’s boxed in, like a wild animal. Very dangerous
Oh and FYI I'm not voting for Trump or for the Demokkkrats.  My vote is wasted either way, so I'll waste my vote on Kanye since hes the only black candidate.
I read this as “pool” having a totally different meaning and thought “thank goodness. 2020 can’t handle Trump by the pool.”
And the level of irony of Trump challenging anyone’s faith in anyone or any being.  He didn’t know what a Bible was before he ran on the Christian Right.
Thanks...also have an Air Force flag flying on my deck 😉  I have a lot of boats go by and shout "Go Trump"
Actually if your fans of cop's and Trump you are the one with low IQ since that batch of people have literally no brain's or education and like Trump they pay to have other's take tests for them in order for them to pass get some other people to look up too LoL 😂
Words I would pay to watch Trump try to sight read out loud:  Coccyx Isthmus Anemone  Bonus Bucks for him to use them in a complete sentence.
Trump has been “dining out” on his Wharton degree for decades. He reveals his lack of credibility as any kind of intellectual on a daily basis, whatever your pardon may say.
China doesn’t mind Trump torpedoing the U.S. for another 4 years.
Workers and businesses are clawing jobs while the tRUmpvirus continues to worsen....and GOP acts like this is a tRUmp accomplishment? Who falls for this bullshit?
This is what conservatives do they really despise our troops they really despise Americans that are anything less than millionaires  We watched them cheer as Trump denigrated a Vietnam POW who Republicans had previously held up and praised but I guess that was just to get votes
If I have to apologize to trump to get there, it means I’m going to the wrong forking place.
Astounding comment by this reporter - giving Trump benefit of the doubt, with no acknowledgement of possible collaboration with Putin. Lazy?

Nothing had to be this bad it's amazing how Trump was able to put us on course to destination f***** at all these different level  It's amazing he could screw everything up far worse than anyone else who tried to do it on purpose
Tweets from 2016. Why the worry tho? According to your “reporting” Trump has already lost.
The people who hate Trump would vote for this.
clarification - Mueller didn’t actually find/conclude that Trump campaign didn’t collude w Russia. He found insufficient evidence to *prove* that it did. &amp; noted that significant reason he couldn’t prove it was because of extreme stonewalling &amp; lying by witnesses
History professor who has accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Trump will lose
It also provides an option for Trump to accuse China of having stolen the election in November. He could ratchet up tensions even more and create chaos during the transition period.
I have an idea. Let’s let all Chinese citizens and all Russian citizens vote this November. It’s the only way tRUmp is going to get more than 60 million votes.
why did you stop referring to President Trump as impeached President Trump?    Did you polling tell you that was a loser?
Can't help but remember all of the cocky "We survived Obama, you'll survive Trump" bragging and memes I saw after the 2016 election.   160,000 Americans *and counting* would beg to differ. #TrumpVirus

Almost as stunning as your turn from disliking to liking Donald Trump.  Shocked to see you are a political sellout too.
Confirming tRUMp's criminal negligence:
This is the lobby of the first Trump Hotel to be remodeled by Ivanka after his death...the one where she decides to strip out the 1980s brass/“gold” and do things “her way”.
I always thought double digit unemployment is bad. The Trump recession/depression is so big like nothing anyone has ever seen. No one even knew it could be this bad.
I live in a magazine and it has more character than this...this is just wrong.  It’s like Trump died and Ivanka decided to strip out the 1980s brass and redo things “her way”
Only a trump can celebrate the return of low paying hospitality jobs he was responsible for losing in the first place.
Ivanka got 28 patents while Daddy was in office. Is that standing up to China? US taxpayers PAID farmers $32B because Trump blocked food shipments to China... we sure are winning
I predict 'Biker's for Trump' will get a LOT smaller in the coming months.
I don't care who you vote for, it's your right. I personally refuse to vote for him  I asked you a question you didn't answer.  How much mass incarceration policy has Trump drafted?
My guess this wasn't Kanye's idea on his own. I think he got by with a little help from his friend.  Boycott? Easy, I have never supported this family to begin with.  Trump must really be after of Joe, to back this idea. #ByeKanye #Kardashians #TrumpIsALaughingStock
Biden isn’t President. Biden didn’t call it a threat, because he can’t as a US citizen, not a public official. Trump called it a National Security threat and let’s it sit for 45 days...
Can you imagine the coverage if she was accusing Trump?
Hackers are defacing Reddit with pro-Trump messages  via  &amp;
If you are an atheist, then this message wasn’t for you. It wasn’t for Trump, either. It was for people of faith.
Why would it matter if he's voting for creepy old Joe or creepy old Trump? They're both terrible choices IMHO.
Even if Trump one all 4 of those toss-up states, that only gives him 204, not enough to win.
They’d vote for anyone/anything other than Trump. No logic, no reason, strictly emotional decision.
WOW! Spreading COVID-19 by packing a room and not following guidelines. Why are you promoting this? They won't be re-electing trump if they are dead or too sick to vote...
We thought that about Hillary too...just saying. But also the sexism was rampant against her, esp this close to the election. So that maybe might have impacted her chances.../s  My point: fuck the patriarchy and don't be complacent  Register and #vote
Trump bans dealings with Chinese owners of TikTok, WeChat
Has anyone had luck trying to explain to family/friends why Trump is so dangerous? It is maddening. I know I shouldn’t give up - but Trump supporters are in no mood to ever hear anything bad about Trump. If anyone has had success - please tell me how!  Thanks! #AmericaOrTrump
Actually, you described Trump supporters.
Don't stop it because it's the moral thing to do. Lol. Stop it because it helps Trump. Nutter butters.

They worry DeJoy’s plan will slow election mail in November. Democrats also worry DeJoy has been a top fundraiser for President Trump and the RNC.
In some ways, this is an extraordinary article, written by a man who has had the intellectual equivalent of a bucket of ice water unceremoniously dumped over his head, who was suddenly jolted out of a collective delusion.
Should t is be the America virus by now?  #Trump f’d this up silo badly that we’re the reason it’s not yet eradicated.    Another reminder of how truly worthless this president is as a president and of course human.
And Trump thought it was the year 220 and that we have a national park named “Yo Semites.” What’s your point?
Trump's base has demonstrated remarkable agility in changing core beliefs as needed.
That is not the point. What this video shows is the hypocrisy of Fox News. All of the Fox clips were statements against Biden. If Fox wants to make juvenile jabs at speaking blunders, they should be fair and make the same jabs at Trump.
Also, I can assure you myself and most every vet I served with agree, Trump can NEVER claim to support the military again, not when he’s too afraid to stand up to Putin for putting bounties on our troops bc he doesn’t want to lose his supt in the election.
Brilliant!  A few weeks ago, we took a back road to avoid 94 and there was a Trump store in Buffalo!
Cripes, that Dinesh D’Souza is as dumb as a box of Trump bobbleheads.
Not being mentioned so much in response to the claim that Biden will hurt God is Trump’s assertion that under Biden there will be “no anything.” Just complete annihilation of all that exists. Gotta say, I still prefer the taco trucks on every corner but I do see some upsides.
I love watching &amp; listening to  He is a hard working, smart reporter that gets under  's skin without even really trying. He deals with Trump's BS &amp; MAGATS shouting at him in a calm, unwaivering way &amp; is a total professional. Well done Jom Acosta!!
Look  all the House's Bills sitting  #MoscowMitch 's desk, not working day &amp; night to finish a relief package, &amp; their silence on trump using unknown HHS military personnel, tear gas &amp; rubber bullets on peaceful protestors. Now, 160,000 death toll is not enough to gop to change
I always said he never wanted to win in 2016 either.. and would say stupid stuff going "They will never vote for me now"..  well they did..  who knew.. but remember there is a hidden Trump vote out there, so be leary of the polls if Trump is within 5% of Biden in any poll.
By the time his term is up tRUmp will have spent nearly 350 days—1 of 4 of his years in office—on a golf course.
OK I’m definitely not voting for Trump, but who the fuck is Joe Biden’s vice president? How the fuck is he announcing it 2 weeks before the election? Reps Dems libs, etc need to come together and stop letting our government abuse us like this. It’s fuckn insane!! #TheHumanParty
That is not leading. That is doing nothing. They could just eliminate her position. She is a Trump lap dog.
Do you have any Trump masks?
Do you have any Trump masks?
The most amazing thing about Trump handling Coronavirus is that if he just followed what other countries did and we were out of it by now, his poll numbers would have skyrocketed. Handling tragedy always boosts numbers, and he still couldn’t even do that.
Thanks, Senator, for drawing attention to this important day. While you’re at it, can you also draw attention to the fact that tRUmp continues to allow Vlad Putin to get away with paying the Taliban to execute US troops? Do it for Purple Heart recipients and all who serve.

Donald Trump, in every speech he's ever given. I would say for 'his' book, "The Art of the Deal", but he didn't actually write that book (although claims he did - once again proving his hand at fiction).
If it’s a tRump appointee, it lies. It is known.
Outside of him calling black people dumb last night, and saying they aren’t black if they vote for Trump.  Yeah, I’d agree.
Factually inaccurate. If ur not a troll, if u r one of us, please inform urself. U couldn’t b more wrong. Here’s a website that explains it with numbers:  Basically, u might b racist if u think Trump did a better job 😐. The first chart below, is PRE-covid.
People have been showering  with a lot of deserved praise for his Trump interview, but his Larry Kudlow interview is just as good. Kudlow: Like I said, we're not hiding anything.  Swan: Well right now you are.
But theyre the biggest thieves, pervs and murderers in the history of history! Foh. Hedge Clippers? Is this an Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence movie?? So sick of it. Pretty sure Trump’s son stole from kids with cancer to give to his father. Can they go down for life now 2?
Hmm... Based on that little bit of info, I suspect we may have some similarities in how we think/process culture. I'm looking forward to reading it. I need to get this dumb little book about Trump done that I'm writing, so I can move onto things that are more life-giving.
“Trump supporters are more likely to be clustered in the outlying, more heavily white suburbs, and Democrats are making real inroads into the communities with more heterogeneity and better-off whites.” #mustRead
Testing, testing, testing; a national plan;  and honesty from Trump admin re the pandemic would be an incentive to return to work and school,
Did he really try and bring up the 2000 election when you asked him about Trump potentially lying about this election’s results?
Even if it doesn't matter that much, I do think Biden should wait on an announcement until Trump has committed on Pence.
Do Not Pledge To support This feeble Unelectable Racist. Biden cant beat trump  We cant afford to lose so we cant afford to nominate feeble joe
You r fighting for Donald trump only! You will USE GOD and anyone else to get what you want! No different than a dictator!🤮🤑☠️
You cannot be a Christian and a Trump licker.Travel ban from China was inadequate; COVID was already here.  Compare what POTUS did vs leaders in Canada, New Zealand, Norway, etc. Trump did little nationally because he thought it was going to hit Blue states the most. He figured let the individual governors take the blame.
One would think so!  But there are too many cult followers and idiots out there who follow Trump's every word.  It's just so sad.  And aggravating.
Not well.  If Trump wins in Nov, you might see a lot of folks at your southern border submitting urgent immigration requests.
Trump is starting up more trade-war nonsense with Canada.  A worldwide pandemic with 1000 people dying a day, and he finds time for an ill-conceived fight with with our neighbors!   #CantWaitUntilNov3
Didn't Trump just sign an executive order to do that himself???
Perfect evidence that Trump has no idea what ObamaCare covers and no idea why he is challenging it in court.  BTW, the hurriedly-scheduled "Press Conference" was held at a Trump golf club and began with the playing of "Hail to the Chief."  #DidISlipIntoAParallelUniverse
Trump wants a Prime Time TV show alright.  But I want to believe he'll be too busy with his lawyers preparing to defend all those state and federal charges that he should be facing.
You know that the Republicans didn’t agree because they knew they would make Trump look good before the election. Democrats May have just lost November... He’s gonna eff this royally.
Trump could sign an executive order granting the right to bear arms, and his followers would applaud.  #CultOfPersonality
What kind of parallel universe have we slipped into?  Dr Fauci should listen to Donald Trump?????
Yeah...and added applause by his followers after Trump signs an executive order granting all citizens the right to bear arms.
Such ignorance!  Trump and Company have no clue what provisions are in the ACA.  They are not policy guys.
Yeah but trump wants the help so.  Quandary
Trump never had a clue what the ACA covered or didn't cover.  Appears even his spokesmen aren't big on details.
The administration is already struggling to deliver the mail.  How is centralizing power around the Postmaster General (who got the job because he was a Trump donor) going to help get the USPS ready for an increase of vote-by-mail business this fall?
When Trump says he'll defer "payroll taxes" through yearend, it effectively "defunds" Social Security. The GOP will then want to reduce benefits because they'll say SS funding is inadequate. There are better ways to give the American people a financial break during this crisis.
Trump Republicans are pretty damn racist to even do this.
If Trump cared about security measures in the USPS, he'd order the Postmaster General, whom he appointed, to get things in order.  DJT promised he alone could fix things.  If the administration can't deliver mail, how can it manage far more demanding responsibilities?
In a recent article by John Wesley Reed, he argues that Christians can &amp; should vote for Trump because it's abt policy over character.  Which to me means "hey, we know he isn't a Christian, but we are getting what we want". It's all an act.
There have been so many great Time covers during the Trump regime.
Dozens of Trump's Bedminster club patrons in their shorts and golf attire in the room.  Probably held more for their enjoyment than to deliver substantive news.  They even began by playing "Hail to the Chief."
Repeal and Replace trump's executive order.
Trump has no clue what's in the ACA.  He's just against it because Obama was for it.
I recently had an MRl of my brain and they found some concerns, so tomorrow I go for some neuropsychological testing. I suspect at least part of this will involve the same test that Trump “aced”. I’m scared guys, what if I can’t remember “person, woman, man, camera, TV”?
Repeal and Replace trump's executive order !
Forbes: Gaming Stocks Plummet On Trump Executive Order Scare.   via
America is broke, jobless and can’t pay their rent. Trump has a press conference at his country club with club members there to ....cheer him on?!? This scene is appalling.
Teri Ann, it's being pitched as a "press conference" and the Press has been called in.  But clearly it's a Trump performance for golf club friends.
Tbf, Biden's main platform is "I'm not Trump" so they're both doing it
Cult of personality.  Trump's supporters aren't listening, evaluating, considering alternatives, etc., the way you and I might form an opinion.  That's why arguments, charts, statistics, and facts won't sway them.  He's their guy and that's all there is to that.
I mean, seriously? This guy had to believe he was Teflon. To actually Tweet that Pervy Photo out is not just a bad judgement call, but....wait. Doesn't he support Trump too?
So he issued an order that doesn’t have any teeth because nobody knows what’s in it, and he’s complaining about ads nobody’s seen because they don’t exist? This is peak Trump.
Please stop playing The Great Commandment all the time,  It’s a god awful song from an insignificant band that reminds me of Depeche Mode’s Trump-loving uncle.
Friday.  Someone in the Trump Admin should be “resigning” any moment.
If Trump truly believed the vote-by-mail process was flawed, he'd call the Postmaster General he appointed into the Oval Office and have him fix it.  DJT is always talking about all the power he has; let him flex a little with Mr DeJoy.
You'd think Trump would've made people allergic to anyone who starts sentences off with "A lot of people are saying ..." But we still see pundits on both sides do this all the time.
I'm sure as hell not voting for Trump but I'm not convinced Trump beating Biden would absolutely be the ultimate end of America. We are stronger than that, if we have to live through 4 more years of orange, it'll suck, but we will prevail.
Ain't Got No Home - The Ballad of Old Man Trump  via
He described Trump supporters perfectly!
Trump took office during a time when much of the world was experiencing growth. The growth continued until the pandemic hit causing a significant rise in unemployment over the past 6 months.    This graph inappropriately suggests the president has a causal effect on employment.

These numbers are people being rehired back after losing their job. We still have over 30 million on Unemployment.  So no, Trump is NOT the Jobs president.  #buyabrain
Compare the words and actions of Jesus with the words, actions, and policies of Trump...could there be a more anti-Christ candidate?
Russians paid to kill American soldiers and Trump says and does nothing. But TikTok needs to be restricted due to national security issues??
I just saw someone post the other day that went along the lines of "You need to vote democrat if you normally vote third party, because voting Trump out is more important than voting for your ideals."  Oof.
So is trump pass it on
I do both. It's just easier to drag Trump since he's in office right now.
And also that they can attack Biden for "being senile". There are tons of other things that are WAY more valid to attack Biden on. Plus Trump's insistence that the 1918 pandemic was in 1917 is just... Weird.
Vote Trump and watch the black community prosper!  The Dems want to keep the black community suppressed because it buys them votes.   Wise up and climb out!! Vote Trump!

Thanks, Mark, for the link to the full Axios interview.  DJT  talks about his ratings as if we're all just living in a Trump reality show.  He gets a kick out of watching us go crazy over his ludicrous answers. You called it:  "willful ignorance."  😷🌊

American's can still help even if trump is incapable.
Karla, I hope those you love recover completely.  💔 As for Trump, make sure everyone you know is registered to vote.  Talk about the election to 18-21 year olds.  Remind them they have the power to oust Trump with their very first vote.
Don the draft dodger certainly qualifies as a true American patriot. Too good for the draft. I might have been the one that replaced him and I was wounded in combat. Fortunately, the last person I would have wanted in combat with me would be Don Trump.
Biden easily. Trump just says insensitive shit. Biden legit has a racist past.
When Trump's father was in the early stages of Alzheimer's (&amp; Donald deeply in debt), Donald contrived to have a codicil to his father's will drawn up that would give Donald total control of his father's estate.  Fortunately, Fred refused to sign &amp; the scheme was uncovered.
Why is this so hard for you? The same people who told you Trump colluded with Russia and Kavanaugh had drunken orgies just might have a tendency to lie about the NRA...

The pre-gloating from the left yesterday on the assumption that the New York AG was going tp  be releasing Trump's taxes must've been a YUGE letdown Ahahahahahah
Trump speaks a lot more but who is saying Trump speaks well lmao. It’s better than Biden tho
I hope SC defeats Trump and Graham, but even if you don't in 2020, it is crucial that you *try.*  Dems will never break through in red states until we're seen putting up a fight.  Gotta get visible in the public square.  Be brave; be safe.
James, Get somebody busy with the 18-22 cohort!  Fresh new voters who can say forever that they helped oust Trump the first time they voted.  I live in MN, but I just sent your Democratic Party a little $$ to help. Hope others will, too.
Sincere question. At what point does a reporter covering the Trump administration begin to fantasize about catching Covid19 as opposed to having to hear him speak one more time?
Hate him all you want, he's not trump. Just remember that.
Unless I'm missing something, isn’t the GOP's effort for Kayne a full-on demonstration of racism? To help trump win, the GOP thinks it can play/dupe Blacks into voting for a Black guy that’s just not qualified. Blacks can vet candidates beyond just skin color. Disgusting. Come on
If another supreme justice has to step down for whatever reason that's one more person dump gets to pick and need I remind you his last one was a rapist who day one made it clear he supports trump (which those on the Supreme Court are NOT suppose to do)
I hate Biden but I'm still going to vote for him. Why? Because its going to be biden or trump and I for one don't want another 4 years of that walking shitstain destroying this country.  Also keep in mind its not just biden we are voting for -c-
People need to stop posting things about the shitty stuff Biden has said or done. Yes, we get it, he is not great by any means but crap like that is going to convince people to just not vote and every single vote not for Biden is one less trump needs to worry about.

Yes.  Especially Moscow Mitch, Trump's #1 enabler.  Everyone who can needs to support  (either in the ballot box if you live in KY or with a campaign contribution for those of us who live in another state).
I still think about the  article from last week that described a White House willing to abdicate all responsibility for COVID-19 to the governors, because they thought Blue States would take the hit.  Trump is still in an #AintMyProblem mode.
No doubt. Number 1 on my list that trump posted!
Jesse, those 7900 deaths per day didn't bring our economy to a grinding halt or stress out our medical and hospital communities.  COVID has.  To compare normal life span events to the morbidity and mortality spikes due to the negligence of the Trump administration is misleading.
His buddy died and he slowed down for a few days.  Now he’s having a huge money fundraiser at that guy’s house.
My favorite Trump tweets are the ones that get taken down.

We cannot let Trump get away with this. The White House should NOT be used this way.

Donald Trump is under criminal investigation by the Southern District of New York. He’s a con and a cheat. He’s loathed worldwide and by over 60% of Americans.

Again he is projecting. Why would Democrats view this as a political win? People want their kids to be able to go back to school - safely.   The agenda is an R one. They think it will help reopen the economy &amp; reelect Trump. He just cannot grasp that a virus is kicking his ass.

Damn straight.  Opinion | Val Demings: Remember Senate Republicans who dismissed Trump’s wrongdoing — and show them the door
This is exactly the argument that several of my old college friends have used to explain why Trump &amp; the Rs "aren't that bad" becuz our lives aren't impacted. They are  white males who claim to be Christian, &amp; are incredibly selfish &amp; greedy. I can't be around them.
It'd be neat if that visual was aligned with reality. Were it to be a more accurate reflection, it would show Trump listing off a long list of things he wants with Pelosi following in her notes, "yes sir! right away sir! i'll approve that one immediately mr prezident!"
They didn’t, you know when someone takes that test it’s usually the people around that person that are concerned... trump asked Biden take one... by the way I am sure he already took one anyway...
He is trying to run out the clock.  Strategy seems to think that trump is going to beat himself.  For all trumps flaws exposed by a relentless media. This is exactly the same trump that ran in 2016.  There have been no surprises. Biden will need to stand up to beat him.
Black Total Level approvals strikes me as high for a GOP president.  Are there comparisons for other GOP presidents from Rasmussen?  If the African American vote shifts to Trump, by 5 percentage points or more, it seems like a no win for Biden.  What can Rasmussen share?
And Obama has no hand in the economy handed to him, but yet you blamed him. Trump spent 2 trillion in debt driven tax cuts for the 1% BEFORE Covid

I will hand deliver my ballot if necessary.
My point is he's not broke Barry and I know he doesn't give a shit, but I'm sure he'll donate to Trump's reelection fund. Feed the rich kill the poor ☹️
Meanwhile Trump goes to his golf course, taking money from tax payers and putting it into his business. Oh, but he can remember 5 words.

You're being exactly what the problem is. You're painting a huge group of people with the same brush. They left Trump to support Yang, but now Yang is out. Who cares if they support Trump? Enough of the "if they don't agree with me they're evil" attitude.
Obama rebuilt the economy. Instead of using that economy and paying down debt, Trump increased it. He gave a tax cut to the 1% and paid for it with 2 trillion in debt. Yeah stimulus will heat up the economy...temporarily
...of course. Jumped on the trump train after I voted for Hillary in the last election.   I’m blown away at how much Trump gets done.
Trump will never ever be on the same level as Obama. Obama has intelligence,  empathy,  a soul, a heart....Trump is SO jealous of Obama.

You are very good. That's why I had to check to make sure this really wasn't Trump. A little over-the top (though not by much) and creepy.
Republicans (i.e., in Congress as well as in State Houses across the country) rolled over and abdicated their role of checks and balances. Instead, they became facilitators for every crazy, dangerous, or un-American action Trump wanted to put forth. Vote Blue in all contests. 🌊
It’s just another thing that shows the world that a moron is running the U.S.  Dismissive of Americans who make history. Ridiculous and awful. Trump must BECOME history.

It’s commonly known that republicans are wealthier not sure how u don’t know this. Had to use 2012 election but it would be similair for Hillary vs trump.
That is the goal of the trump administration is to devalue real estate and then have the banks and private groups buy up the city for cheap... they are ghouls at the White House...
Here's an example...  Trump: "Many people are saying we're doing a great job."   "Who's saying that?"   Trump: "Many people."   "Right. But who exactly? Can you give me names?"   ☝️ That's the level hardly anyone reaches. But he has no answer if the interviewer gets there.
What's true about that Trump  interview has been true all along. 2-3 levels of follow up to a single issue or answer reveals the emperor has no clothes. And "who" "what" "how" and "why" are most effective to get there. (1/2)
Anti-Trump Republicans take the president’s newest campaign ad and throw it back in his face
Actually the most important election of our lifetime was in 2018 when a congress was elected that was able to put the breaks on the trump/gop crime syndicate. It's bad now but imagine where the USA would be if the majority in Congress hadn't flipped.
But let’s be honest, everyone on the campaign wishes Trump would stop talking because every interview provides endless footage for Biden and Lincoln to use in their ads

Trump is so totally out of his league. Of course, we need to hear him, but why do his handlers let him go out in public?  was well prepared and just carried on despite the incoherent nonsense that flowed from DJT. Can you get a Pulitzer for an interview?
Most of us know the limit of our expertise.  Trump, though, is willing to go out and make a fool of himself anytime, anyplace, on any topic.  You and I know he’s out of his league, but what’s frightening is that 38% of the country thinks he makes perfectly good sense.
I'll try not to hate, but Mitch McConnell bears much of the guilt for the mess we're in.  I'm not trying to absolve DJT of anything, but a good portion of Trump's agenda would have fallen into oblivion if we had a Senate Leader willing to provide appropriate checks and balances.

Part of the reason Trump won. Everything Trump did she followed up with “but Hillary’s emails”. Total failure on Andreas part.
Nuanced look at the TikTok issue. 👇
, I don’t like pardons either, and indeed Trump has made a mockery of them. I’m just so worried about what he &amp; Barr could do before Jan 20. Would prefer him out of office even if deals had to be made. That said, if DJT doesn’t resign, charges should be filed Jan 21.

Yes, Nixon's underlings were prosecuted expeditiously, but not Nixon. Trump would litigate and appeal until he died of old age.  He can do too much damage between now and Jan 20.  Get him out NOW.  If Trump resigns now, *Pence* would pardon him.
Dr Birx and Fauci, please quit Trump and just do PSAs for the health and safety of the American people going forward. He does not care about the truth, or us.
Fred, whatever happened with all the talk a couple of years ago about the NRA being a conduit for illegal foreign contributions to the RNC?  Any chance that *many* Repubs benefited from those donations?  Is that why virtually none speak out against Trump?

Let's just stick with helping the people, $1 trillion for state and local governments who spent wildly on pensions??? No thanks, Pelosi needs to bring her numbers way, way down (below $1.5 trillion) before Republicans will do a deal. Otherwise Trump will likely act unilaterally.
The people who need help will get it and the courts will rightfully remove the power of Trump to act unilaterally but by then there will likely be a vaccine or at least a viable antibody treatment.
Sure, but Schumer is literally holding things up to get the SALT deduction limit removed (which only helps the richest)! I hope Trump does somehow do all this through executive action and it takes 6 months or a year to go through the courts which strike him down.

Willing to lie to Congress. Guess he’s qualified to serve in the trump administration. Vote for Biden and get rid of all of these guys.

yes. a few. but in general, I don't think Trump has lost much support overall. His supporters are believers. On the other hand, I don't think he has gained any support. So that could be his downfall.
Thank you Donald Trump.  This is your base. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

Donald Trump is under criminal investigation by the Southern District of New York. He’s a con and a cheat. He’s loathed worldwide and by over 60% of Americans.

Everyone remember that the Republicant covid relief bill includes funding for a new FBI building across the street from Trump's hotel. He wants this new building built so that a competing Hotel can't be put there. Plus there's all kinds of funding for military spending.
It’s going to baffle me for the rest of my life how Trump saying he’s done more for Black Americans as President wasn’t questioned to his face until an Australian did it.

I have enjoyed how  has slowly turned Trump press conferences into FJM columns.
In a recent article by John Wesley Reed, he argues that Christians can &amp; should vote for Trump because it's abt policy over character.  Which to me means "hey, we know he isn't a Christian, but we are getting what we want". It's all an act.

If tRump wins this fall will you stay in the US or leave for another country? Which country?
I recently had an MRl of my brain and they found some concerns, so tomorrow I go for some neuropsychological testing. I suspect at least part of this will involve the same test that Trump “aced”. I’m scared guys, what if I can’t remember “person, woman, man, camera, TV”?
I mean, seriously? This guy had to believe he was Teflon. To actually Tweet that Pervy Photo out is not just a bad judgement call, but....wait. Doesn't he support Trump too?
The red rash on my ass is called Trump virus, can we have a news conference on that? #DonnyDumbass

So he issued an order that doesn’t have any teeth because nobody knows what’s in it, and he’s complaining about ads nobody’s seen because they don’t exist? This is peak Trump.
Yeah I wanna be one of those serious Christians like Trump! Or Falwell!

Well, they won't go Trump, and they won't write Bernie in this time. I say this is a Bernie write-in voter during the last election.
When Trump gave out them Covid checks. 😂😂
Apparently it is, to him! I would like to introduce him to Trump's critics...some of whom are better-educated than him, and others who did not have (or want) that opportunity and are wonderful and significant people. Equating education with intelligence or worth is dumb.
You'd think Trump would've made people allergic to anyone who starts sentences off with "A lot of people are saying ..." But we still see pundits on both sides do this all the time.
During the Swan interview, tRump said he was never briefed inre to bounties on US troops. If tRump had been briefed, he said he "would have done something about it".  He then said many ppl didn't believe the report was true. So why would he act on a false claim?
Looks like the original was taken down.

yes. a few. but in general, I don't think Trump has lost much support overall. His supporters are believers. On the other hand, I don't think he has gained any support. So that could be his downfall.
Let us not forget how great the economy was back in February before all this craziness started. That was a result of good policies by our president and we can get right back to that ONLY if we vote Trump!
Exactly. I want Tish to be the one to take him &amp; the kids down for obvious reasons, but she is doing her job. Once we dig out Trump, maybe our collective brains will reset to NO Trump 24/7.
Thank you Donald Trump.  This is your base. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
I hearken back to that great republican in the sky who said 'You can fool all of the people, some of the time, and Some of the people all of the time, but only Trump believes you can fool all of the people all of the time."

His buddy died and he slowed down for a few days.  Now he’s having a huge money fundraiser at that guy’s house.
My favorite Trump tweets are the ones that get taken down.
We cannot let Trump get away with this. The White House should NOT be used this way.
Trump supporters would ABSOLUTELY attack leading epidemiologist as he fights this pandemic. It’s RIGHT up their alley.
Donald Trump is under criminal investigation by the Southern District of New York. He’s a con and a cheat. He’s loathed worldwide and by over 60% of Americans.
Trump says it is legal for him to deliver his Republican nomination speech from the White House and that the Hatch Act doesn’t apply to him as president: “There is no Hatch Act because it doesn't pertain to the president." -Trump.THOUGHTS, Jason?  Here’s mine: fascism, delusion.
Again he is projecting. Why would Democrats view this as a political win? People want their kids to be able to go back to school - safely.   The agenda is an R one. They think it will help reopen the economy &amp; reelect Trump. He just cannot grasp that a virus is kicking his ass.

Donald Trump’s greatest achievement is making Joe Biden look like an accetable choice for President.
As long as Trump brings his tax returns.
What if he offered to let anyone in danger of eviction live in Trump Tower rent-free until they could find a job?
bad take.  As a never-Trumper, I held my nose and voted HRC. I voted for the one with, at least, a brain.  Trump voters don't have that requirement.
Everyone remember that the Republicant covid relief bill includes funding for a new FBI building across the street from Trump's hotel. He wants this new building built so that a competing Hotel can't be put there. Plus there's all kinds of funding for military spending.
It’s really not that brazen. Not one of Donald Trump’s supporters will a) bother to check this, or b) care at all that it is a lie.
It’s going to baffle me for the rest of my life how Trump saying he’s done more for Black Americans as President wasn’t questioned to his face until an Australian did it.
This is exactly the argument that several of my old college friends have used to explain why Trump &amp; the Rs "aren't that bad" becuz our lives aren't impacted. They are  white males who claim to be Christian, &amp; are incredibly selfish &amp; greedy. I can't be around them.
Based on past experience, we have every reason to believe Trump will do nothing to protect American citizens.
EXACTLY, I was confused to read how it was possible to be for anyone to be confused here?! Obviously, the blond is a flag-waving, God-fearing Trump lady, who treats wearing a mask with ironic disdain!
And Obama has no hand in the economy handed to him, but yet you blamed him. Trump spent 2 trillion in debt driven tax cuts for the 1% BEFORE Covid
The difference between #Trump and #Obama, and their supporters. Obama talked tough, drew red lines, and failed to act. Trump didn't threaten, he acted.  And  whines, then deleted his tweet when  eviscerates his position.
And yet, pretty benign compared the terrible words that come out of Trump's mouth on a daily basis (that conservatives have turned a blind eye on for 3 1/2 years now...)
He Predicted Trump’s Win in 2016. Now He’s Ready to Call 2020.

Oh, Trump is ready to send anything Beirut needs.  Apparently willing to send them anything, but fuck the blue states who are really struggling with their budgets.
Trump has led his followers to believe we have to do nothing to get rid of this.  He has asked nothing because he is willing to do nothing. 6/

Your president has officially declared war on the service which people I love rely on for political reasons. You have proven yourself loyal to Trump over American citizens who need support during a pandemic, and your kind have inspired me to devote myself to Biden’s campaign.
Most of the establishment democrats are in bed with pharmaceutical companies, including Joe Biden because he has been saying his whole political career he wants to cut Medicare and Medicaid and social security.
Love their claim that Biden can’t speak off script...do they just tune out all the things Trump has said off script?  Injecting bleach?  Attacks on every person who’s ever said a negative word about him?  Pandemic of NINETEEN SEVENTEEN?  Airport attacks during the revolution?
Biden is just politicizing this, he isn't actually thinking this is the right way to handle it.  No, we shouldn't mandate from the federal government.
Wonders, since she’s Biden’s new assistant, if she’ll have to change his depends and wipe his ass..
I understand that POV, however, I think I’m just more optimistic. Parties move with public opinion, and public opinion on climate change action, health care, and other topics is shifting drastically. If Biden doesn’t act on his promises, I promise in 2024 I’ll be on your side.
Wonders, since she’s Biden’s new assistant, if she will have to change his depends and wipe his ass..
I personally think the way to go about it isn’t a hashtag that will fall off the trending tab by morning. I believe the way to do that is to get a man willing to change into office (Biden in this case), then use the power of our base to get change done.
Wonders since she’s become Biden’s assistant, if she will have to change his depends and wipe his ass..
Well, not all politicians are the same. Politicians are receptive to ideas which fit with their party. Biden was receptive to change in terms of Gay Marriage, Criminal Justice, Climate Change, and Health Care. Trump wouldn’t capitulate on any of those issues no matter what.

Every news outlet should be surrounding FOX news HQ to determine if their employee is plotting to kill Joe Biden. How is the  not banging on doors? This was a threat against Joe Biden.
If Joe Biden is allowed to bring up the past then Trump should bring up that Joe Biden has been saying he wants to defund social security, Medicare and medicaid his entire political career.

I voted for you. Thanks for all the ways you continue to fight the good fight. All in now for Biden/Harris.
The president just gave us notice we’re going to have to learn Chinese if Biden wins. It’s never too early to start learning!  加油拜登的！
Sorry, but Kamala nor Biden are transphobic, I’ve done extensive research on their lgbtq stances, and I can say with 100% certainty they will protect transgender rights and appoint Supreme Court justices which fight lgbtq discrimination
This is where we differ, because I’m a bit more optimistic. I’m hopeful that with a different cabinet, a president that is quite liberal compared to previous ones, and public pressure from BLM, we could actually see some change. And if they don’t, Biden will be gone in 4 years.
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Tulsi Gabbert wipes her ass with Kamala Harris. Harris is a true leftist suck up and is poster child for drama and for nearly destroying a justice's life with spite. She is just as dangerous as Biden, And will destroy this country, Mark my words. Tulsi has more class any day.
Very on brand for Joe Biden to be holding his phone upside down. 🤣🤣🤣
Kamala Harris was the right pick for the Biden campaign. It’s the safe pick. They didn’t overthink it. I’m thrilled to see a woman and POC on this ticket. I’m also glad republicans can’t relitigate Benghazi/Tarmac/Hillary for the trillionth time if they’d picked Susan Rice. Happy

Whatever happens, I’m voting Biden 2020. I’d rather vote for the dude who has a plan for supporting our transgender brethren than the dude who actively antagonizes them.
Once more, with feeling: Biden can announce he's running with an inanimate carbon rod and it will not affect my support of him. As long as it isn't Tulsi Gabbard or Joe Lieberman, I'm fine.
Just donated an extra 25$ to Biden’s campaign. Have a good night :)
Of course, one might not expect the candidate to appearing with Biden in the same place at all. Good ol' 2020.
Yea but these riots started under Obama same with the kids being in cages. Syria's civil war was also started under Obama's watch as well. Not to mention Joe Biden wants to defund social security, Medicare and medicaid the proof is in his entire political career. Look it up.
Joe Biden is such a racist that he doesn’t know when he’s making a racist statement..
Do you have any evidence that Trump’s policy is better for the black population that Biden’s? Biden has dozens of pages of carefully thought out antiracist policies on his website. Trump has nothing I could find. Quotes don’t matter, policy and goals do.
This letter doesn’t advocate for a particular Black woman. We are not interchangeable! Do I want to see Black women lead? YES! Do I want Black women in positions of power? YES! But this further tokenizes the Black women Biden IS considering.Its not the solidarity they think it is
If the states are so independent, then I’m sure Biden would have no impact on the unrest if he was elected.
Donate to Biden campaign
Joe Biden has been saying he wants to defund social security, Medicare and Medicaid and disability his entire political career. So whats your point? How will things get any better with Joe Biden when he is just part of the problem? If you don't believe me do some research.
Lmao did you know that Joe Biden also wants to defund Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Yet you sheep still believe he will change our country for the better. Face it the two party system isn't working. Also the proof is in Joe Biden's entire political career.
Biden has no policy? Dude, check his website. He has hundreds of pages of plans and policies he would implement. I won’t continue arguing unless you can admit to basic truths of reality
Hopefully trump wins because if Joe Biden wins we will lose social security and Medicare and Medicaid because he wants to defund all 3 of them to pay for his illegal immigrants and their votes. The cartel problem will only get worse with a Democrat in office.
Whenever I hear someone calling Biden a racist, it’s always because he said something stupid. He isn’t a good speaker, and he has a stutter; however, those embarrassing moments don’t define his worldview. You’re waist deep in the water and acting like you’ve explored the ocean.
This is exactly what I’m talking about. Have you ever looked at Biden’s policy? Have you ever listened to what he wants to do without looking through a tinted lens? Have you stopped looking at the juicy snippets and looked into his current states beliefs?
Joe Biden is more corrupted than Trump will ever be. He also wants to defund social security and Medicare and Medicaid. He has been saying that for most of his political career.
Y’all talk about his deep past, but never about his recent history with racial ideologies. I wonder why I’ve never seen a Trump supporter judge Biden’s policy 🤔
Joe Biden is unfit and a terrible canidate for president.  Change my mind, oh, and you can't use the word Trump
He doesn’t have to accept the results, like we give a damn, but he WILL HAVE TO GET HIS BIG ASS UP OUT OF THE PEOPLES HOUSE! President Biden already confirmed after his inauguration the IDIOT would be drug out the WH kicking and screaming like the coward he is if he try’s that BS

The most frustrating part is that they agree that Biden is trash and still think that he deserves their vote. My hardest lefty friend even agrees with me that Obama sucked. Yet somehow still thinks Trump is worse.
Yep, they did it deceptively to make it sound worse than it was because trust me, they won't report the Q3 numbers the same way; although they will report the Q4 numbers to make them look ridiculously good if Biden wins.

So if everything needs changing why hasnt career politician Joe Biden done anything??   Why is it Trumps fault career politicians haven’t been successful?  Maybe because they have other agendas?  Hmmmm.
Nah, he'll just use the Obama strategy and only hold pressers every 3 months.  But he handles the hostile media pretty well, and when he has a stroke it will be long after his second term.  Biden may have already had one.
Maybe Trump should adopt the Biden model:  only call on friendly press with pre-approved questions.  No, Trump is smart enough and courageous enough to take this shit from a hostile media on a daily basis.
I'd like to hear Biden answer ANY tough question.

Politicians campaign where they have a chance of winning.  To do otherwise would be a waste of time and resources.  Do you think Biden will campaign in Alabama or Mississippi?  It's not a matter of caring.  It's a matter of getting to 270 electoral votes.
First, it's Aryan Nation.  Second, it's the democrats who founded the KKK and fought for segregation (Biden supported Ayran  views).  Third, the left has been screaming RACIST! at conservatives for decades as a political tactic.  Read Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals.
Joe Biden touches young children, has a new racist comment almost weekly, has failed in office for 45 years and rarely can complete a full sentence. I'll pass on his advice
Yeah but Biden can't survive 4 years of Biden.
The Trump administration got rid of a bloated team of bureaucrats, but once we knew that China and the WHO had been lying to us, in a week he put together a stronger team of medical professionals and dealt with the pandemic better than Hillary ever could.  Biden would be lost.
Nice try using the democrat talking points (aka Excuses).  Listen to Biden talk from 10 years ago and it is obvious he has lost it.  Even democrat leadership knows it. You can keep up the illusion, but only until the first debate.  Then it's GAME OVER.
All the Biden followers running to get a mask
If ur in support of #BLM and #ACAB and ur going to vote 4 Biden/Harris, ur a hypocrite.  If you are not going to be part of the #generalstrike due 2 the govt not completing the stimulus package and supported Sanders, ur also a hypocrite.
Any chance Open Skies survives or resumes under a Biden presidency?
I just oppose Biden
A smart candidate doesn't care about the popular vote.  It's the electoral college that determines the winner, and that made Trump brilliant and Hillary...home.   Trumps base will walk through fire to vote this time +12M, and probably more after reasonable dems hear Biden debate.
Not that arguing with a Karen will change your gullible little deranged mind.  But when Biden steps onto the debate stage with Trump it's GAME OVER.  Then your hate will really consume you.  Have fun screaming into your pillow on Nov 4th!

Biden can't remember his name without a teleprompter.  People will feel sorry for the poor old guy when Trump shreds him in the debates.  CNN will accuse Trump of Elder Abuse! But it will still be GAME OVER for Biden.

I popped this list in a thread yesterday as potential targets for blame should Biden lose:
Bernie fell back in line fast enough that I don't think he'll be the target of Team D's ire should Biden lose.
If Joe Biden is allowed to bring up the past then Trump should bring up that Joe Biden has been saying he wants to defund social security, Medicare and medicaid his entire political career.
I hope somebody or somebodies crash the crap out of it.  Well...  that is unless Team D crashes it without any help.  Which if Biden's streams are any indicator is highly likely.
Shouldn’t that be Biden?

that’s the argument that my sister-in-law used when talking to my wife tonight. Voting for trump because “Biden couldn’t do any better”. trump will get the majority of votes from this devout evangelical &amp; her circle of friends. Can’t have fact based conversation. Tone deaf.
Translation: White Woman will be submissive to their White Husbands in knowing, I'll keep Blacks &amp; Mexicans away from their neighborhoods. Also don't vote Biden because he'll allow a Black Man to allow fair opportunities to all races.   Trump's racism is so blatant &amp; disgusting!!

It feels so good having Biden/Harris as a team. They will bring ethics back to government. They will bring back empathy. They will bring back fairness. And so much more.
At least Biden will try and hide the bad things his team does and not kill the gays. Harris will just try to lock up the trans folks though.
Biden/Harris will win. #BidenHarris
How should I respond to a R who asks about Kamala’s response to the sexual harassment allegations against Biden?
I will crawl over broken glass to vote Biden/Harris and dem up and down the ticket. Still, Senator Warren, I just want to say you brought humanity, intelligence, wit and more to this campaign, and I just can’t thank you enough for all you do and all you are.
“Nasty to Kavanaugh”...is Trump campaigning for Biden/Harris now cause this sounds like a great endorsement?
Harris was my favorite, but all the women up for VP were good. Please people vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. They are a great team.
Hey, I hate that Biden is the Dem nom as well. He's incredibly problematic. INCREDIBLY. BUT...still going to vote for him over Trump in Nov. Because that's what we got. And if you don't because your upset about Biden, them congrats, you've contributed to four more years of hell.
He picked her bc she is smarter than Trump and Biden combined, is a huge badass, and is entirely competent.  The black community isn’t a huge Kamala backer, so your point is moot
Actually this is a photo op.  The difference is Biden didn’t need to shoot and gas peaceful protestors to hold a Bible upside down. He just rode a bike instead while Trump can’t even walk down a ramp.
Biden ain’t slick
To all who complain that Kamala Harris is not progressive enough or that she was a prosecutor, you should read this. She will be a fantastic progressive Vice President. Biden/Harris 2020!!!  55 Things You Need to Know About Kamala Harris  via
I voted for you. Thanks for all the ways you continue to fight the good fight. All in now for Biden/Harris.
The president just gave us notice we’re going to have to learn Chinese if Biden wins. It’s never too early to start learning!  加油拜登的！
Yeah, that's the main thing. It's the default call, and we'll, that's Biden in a nutshell  I'm not thrilled but not worked up either
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Tulsi Gabbert wipes her ass with Kamala Harris. Harris is a true leftist suck up and is poster child for drama and for nearly destroying a justice's life with spite. She is just as dangerous as Biden, And will destroy this country, Mark my words. Tulsi has more class any day.
* Why are you CONSPIRING with Russia &amp; Putin against Biden??? SHAME ON YOU.      #BillBarr    #gop
Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP is just more proof that cops and klan go hand in hand.
Very on brand for Joe Biden to be holding his phone upside down. 🤣🤣🤣
Those people were going to vote for Biden no matter who he picked for VP.  She doesn't sway a demographic. She doesn't bring a better chance of winning any States. She instead of mitigating some of Biden's biggest problems, amplifies them.  Picking Harris is tactical idiocy.
Kamala Harris was the right pick for the Biden campaign. It’s the safe pick. They didn’t overthink it. I’m thrilled to see a woman and POC on this ticket. I’m also glad republicans can’t relitigate Benghazi/Tarmac/Hillary for the trillionth time if they’d picked Susan Rice. Happy
Biden/Harris 2020!! Let's Go!!
If Biden wins corona will be the least of our problems
I’m thrilled. Vote Biden-Harris.
Congrats on your pick!! I was SO hoping you would pick Kamala Harris! You two will make a great team! "Ridin' with Biden!"
So Kamala, who did you sleep with to get to be Biden’s running mate? We are gonna have some fun with this! BJ and the hooker! What a team!
#VPPick Well, now the dems will at least win California.  LOL  Harris is the pit bull they need to fight the fights Biden can't handle, which is all of them.
Kamala Harris for VP, a great choice, vote Biden Harris. 🌊🌊🌊😄😸😊😂
BIDEN HARRIS 2020 LETS GO!!!!
How nice for  to finally tell Joe Biden who his running mate will be! #BidenVP
I asked one of my buddies, what’s the worst thing about Trump. He said that he lies. He says he’s voting for Biden. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Scary thought: when Biden wins the election trump can start running for 2024.😳
Raging Endorsement, :`)  Why I Want Biden to Lose More than I Want Trump to Win
I’d vote for Biden if he named a cabbage as running mate. Fortunately there aren’t any cabbages on his short list.
So crazy how much I bought into her bullshit and how quickly I forgot she existed after she endorsed Biden. I would say it was a good 2-3 months where I didn’t see anything about her on here. And then shocked at myself for how quickly I forgot about her.
That dude would have mopped the floor with old man Biden.
Yea but these riots started under Obama same with the kids being in cages. Syria's civil war was also started under Obama's watch as well. Not to mention Joe Biden wants to defund social security, Medicare and medicaid the proof is in his entire political career. Look it up.
This letter doesn’t advocate for a particular Black woman. We are not interchangeable! Do I want to see Black women lead? YES! Do I want Black women in positions of power? YES! But this further tokenizes the Black women Biden IS considering.Its not the solidarity they think it is
Donate to Biden campaign
Dude, who are you going to vote for them? All this hate you spew for Biden only helps Trump... you don't see this??
10,000 times as often and worse.  Get used to it Biden voters.  We can do this for four years too... if you get that lucky.
The only reason that I plan to watch the conventions is that I'm expecting both to be a spectacular comedy of technical errors.  If Biden's streams are any indicator, the Team D one is almost guaranteed to come apart at the seams.
Joe Biden has been saying he wants to defund social security, Medicare and Medicaid and disability his entire political career. So whats your point? How will things get any better with Joe Biden when he is just part of the problem? If you don't believe me do some research.
Lmao did you know that Joe Biden also wants to defund Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Yet you sheep still believe he will change our country for the better. Face it the two party system isn't working. Also the proof is in Joe Biden's entire political career.
Hopefully trump wins because if Joe Biden wins we will lose social security and Medicare and Medicaid because he wants to defund all 3 of them to pay for his illegal immigrants and their votes. The cartel problem will only get worse with a Democrat in office.
Joe Biden is more corrupted than Trump will ever be. He also wants to defund social security and Medicare and Medicaid. He has been saying that for most of his political career.
As a hard working American I can't handle 1 day of Joe Biden
He doesn’t have to accept the results, like we give a damn, but he WILL HAVE TO GET HIS BIG ASS UP OUT OF THE PEOPLES HOUSE! President Biden already confirmed after his inauguration the IDIOT would be drug out the WH kicking and screaming like the coward he is if he try’s that BS
Biden won't be their candidate come election time anyway.
very sad that biden is the democratic nominee. we coulda had bernie
Joe Biden the Pander 🐻

#IntelligenceReports So Russia is working against Biden. China is working against Trump. Guess which one Trump will do something about.
#Election2020 Is Trump saying that Biden wants to put God on the disabled list?
No way could Biden spell monolith or provide a definition.  Dementia Joe hasn't written a single tweet in the last year.  When he has to meet Trump on stage without a teleprompter, ear piece, or notes, it will be  GAME OVER!
Here is the fact. Biden will select the person who he thinks will help him win the election. I’m completely satisfied with all of the women currently on the short list. I’ll support whoever is selected. That said I prefer Sen Harris.
Read this whole thread. I’m not going to comment on the content, but simply that Joe Biden does not write his own tweets lol.
People are working for money! This is Biden and Obama’s biggest night mirrorBiden is the most cowardly candidate for President that I've ever seen.
Didn't Biden's boss claim that we needed a 'magic wand' to bring manufacturing jobs back?
Take a Statistics class. I can guess that you're a Biden supporter, right?
When will Biden show us his cognitive test results?
Please just do the same thing for Joe Biden, Mike Pence and Donald Trump.   So simple...yet...somehow this basic concept seems to escape the mass media these days.  Why is that?
Biden's not all there Taylor, come on man.
Something Biden is too afraid to do.
I was so happy to read the National Association of Letter Carriers (a union that has over 300,000 members) has endorsed Biden\Harris!
The Biden/Harris combo is a loser.
I read that Biden was trying to take credit for the Israel/UAE peace deal that Trump negotiated, Lmao
She seems to forget how corrupt the Biden's are: Where's Hunter?
You really are low life. How about you start with Obama and Biden and then work your way up.
I just hope that if Biden wins, we can put him in an orange jumpsuit!
Hey, I just filled out my request for an absentee ballot so I can legitimately mail my vote in. You are a con artist Mr. Biden.
So Trump campaign tweeted out mugshots of black people out on bail to scare people as though Biden will be letting out every black person in prison to terrorize white folk.  How about tweeting out pics of Trump in prison stripes?  That's where he should be.
Vote for Biden &amp; Kamala Harris For sure better than TRUMPster fire
It turns out that "Dr." Jill Biden is NOT a medical doctor!
Followed all I wasn't already. Nice to meet you all. I do block people who are saying they won't vote Biden/Harris for any reason. ABirkshire, for example. Was warned last night, checked, pinned tweet saying so. This is too important to not support this ticket. We must unite.
How can any Roman Catholic support Biden/Harris? Outrageous support for pro-abortion candidates!!
I think it is hilarious that the first question about Biden's proposed mask mandate is "under what authority could a President order that?"
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  vía
This Minnesotan agrees wholeheartedly with you. And we were looking forward to a visit. Hopefully next summer after Biden/Harris win!
If you notice your mail has been delivered later than usual, this is done on purpose to rig the election in favor of Trump and the GOP.  Don't vote for them, vote for Biden and democrats. More better if it is progressive democrats.
Voting for Biden sucks, not voting sucks, and voting for trump is not possible  No good choices 😔
Who does Biden think he is, he isn't part of the Govt and he isn't a doctor, he's garbage!
Biden/Harris campaign offices:
Biden's not all there, he's not playing with a full deck.
Poor Democratic leadership on display!  A vote for Biden is a vote to give up your freedoms! Vote Red! 💪🇺🇸
Admittedly an improvement for Biden in his raw number. That being said, Biden will win MN by more than he wins WI, I believe.
Nope!  No questions or solutions!  If you vote for Biden you are not an American!
SO DID BIDEN!
They can criticize her all they want but unless they want four more years of #45 they had better vote Biden/Harris.
so what, Biden and Camela will lose, so who cares/
You are so Full of $hit Even without the covid losses &amp; few gains You still haven't match Obama &amp; Biden They stepped into office after the last #GOP failure w/ 10's of thousands losing work &amp; homes You &amp; #trump blew a record continuous growth that was left for you God hates liers
Who will be the actual power behind Biden/Harris really running the country? That’s the true info needed. Dr Jill Biden? Chief of Staff? These concerns make US look like a crummy  dictatorship. NOT WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR NATION.
Unfortunately, it won’t work until there’s a national testing/tracing plan in place. Maybe if/when Biden wins, things will be good by March?
I say feel free to ban tiktok  It's so toxic With a trump supporters in the Biden supporters
I might take a break from all social media tiktok, Instagram and Twitter cuz all people talk about on tiktok  Biden and trump can app go back to sexy females twerking video game clips and funny videos please
Biden names Kamala as his VP, now Black Americans are tweeting about how Obama didn't do anything for the black community!  Rest abeg

Kamala knee pads Harris will sink the HIDE'n BIDEN  ship . Save those tears for Nov. IT's sad you are in support of a no moral , child abise hiding , career activity sealing sleeze. She's is a disgusting pock for VP
Let's talk about the Biden Harris campaign and what it means for us....  via
Gosh, apparently Biden needed to seek advice from Trump: "Kamala Harris is the meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful, MOST LIBERAL of anyone in the U.S. Senate, and I cannot believe that Joe Biden would pick her as his running mate."  (Trump e-mail)
If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America
Joe Biden is a stanch Catholic. Educate yourself.
Nothing against Biden, but can she step in for one of the debates? Would love to see her destroy Trump face to face.
My head just freaking exploded from Biden’s Lies!
Okay. So when Joe has to resign in 18 months due to mental health concerns, Kamala Harris will be President. In other words, Kamala Obama. I suppose China will love her as much as Joe Biden. She will be a good puppet for Leftist Elites (Globalists).
Good thing you like her since she’ll be POTUS. Biden won’t remember who she is by November.

If I were to vote it would be for Biden.  Trump is a liar and a divider.  So is Biden and he might be senile, so I might just be sitting this one out my Lloyd!!!  Minnesota will go blue I am pretty sure so I am just a human in this state
Indeed, Sad part about people saying vote for Biden is that they’re forced to say it because he’s the only other candidate to vote for lol we’re fucked either way. 😞
Politics are poisonous.   They will have you arguing with your friends and family over 2 candidates that don’t give 2 fucks about us. Ain’t that crazy? Poc are arguing over Trump and Biden... 🤦🏽‍♂️ so this where we at huh
Predictable. A certainty actually. The nastiest man on the planet, or at least in this country, attacks a woman in this way. It lays bare his character. It will have, I think, a boomerang effect. Because try as he will, he can't sully her character at all.
Thinking he hasn't got much support from any color. He may not win his household even. And I don't care, I don't think his name is even going to be on the ballot in most states. So, I'm not reading anything more about him. He's not the news for me. Biden/Harris is.
The rioters, looters, and arsonists who are destroying our cities are Democrats, Biden supporters.

Wow! I think we found Hunter Biden! I knew he had to surface sooner or later. #HunterBiden
There’s a lot of fundamentals (and 22% uncertainty) built in.  Someone else pointed out that as the election gets closer, if things remain the same, Biden’s chances will increase.  If that’s true, I can understand why the model is where it is right now.
So all Trump campaign has is name calling.  All they have otherwise they'd have to bash policies the majority of Americans favor.  Oh, so they'll go with extreme policies that Biden/Harris don't even believe in.  Name call &amp; scare ppl.  I'm going to hate the next 80+ days.

Biden won't be elected, Trump doesn't lose
I am done responding. I'm sick of you trying to say "you think/do this horrible thing" when I clearly don't. I never said the fight ends when Biden is elected
no one in this convo is saying you should be grateful for the LGBTQ+ situation in the US right now. It's still bad. We're saying that it's better than it was 40 years ago and could get WORSE under Trump, while it won't under Biden
I simply think getting Trump out should be top priority. Then young people can start to put pressure on Biden and the Dem establishment
idk where in this argument you got the idea that this is "fun" for me? I'm sorry about the situation you're in. I understand that I have very little skin in the game (i'm a white guy). I just see what Trump is doing and know that four years of Biden would be not as bad
Has Biden recently turned Catholic? I’m curious as to why it’s trending now when he’s probably been a catholic this whole time? It’s just political season so anything goes I guess, I’m surely excited to vote now. 😒
And if Hillary had won in 2016 Biden probably wouldn't have felt the need to run this year. Good job!
Think of it this way, Nate’s model has Biden winning 93% of the time if the election were held today, Elliot’s is at 88%.  Slight variation.
i'd call "we need to elect Biden because Trump is worse" pragmatism
and mfers like you are the reason Trump won in 2016, no offense. Look at how all of you people abstaining did in the next election cycle. No more progressive but at least we have Biden!
In no way do I enjoy the fact that Biden is the nominee. I simply understand that 4 more years of Trump would be much worse than that of Biden
"Hey guys maybe we should finally let black people vote" is to the left of "Hey we need to break down systemic racism" I guess? And that's not Biden i'm quoting but the main line of the Democratic party, whether or not it's older members actually mean what they say
Here we go! So happy that VP Biden picked Kamala Harris! I am energized!
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Join Seniors for Biden” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
my point is that you're ignoring the actual difference in their political stances. Biden may very well be a rapist. It sucks that the Democrats forced him on us. But to say Biden as a presidential candidate and Trump as a presidential candidate are the same thing IS ridiculous
You're reaching Trump supporter levels of simplification here. I very much dislike Biden. I wish Bernie (or even Warren) was the nominee but to ignore all the differences between Biden and Trump's platform and just say they're both equal "racist rapists" is ridiculous
I am meh but still going to vote Biden
Biden isn't all there.
The problem in this case is that Kamala is suppposed to be the appeasement to the left wing because Biden is already far enough to the right.
The Biden-Harris Ticket
No but you attacked Biden, who everyone knows isn’t perfect. But the more you and your berniebro friends focus on criticizing Biden over getting trump voted out, the more likely it gets that trump is gonna get re-elected. And for what? Because you can afford it.
You’re actively dulling what the focus is supposed to be on for Twitter woke points while children are sitting in cages and over a hundred thousand are dead. I don’t like Biden either but there’s a time and place and it definitely isn’t election season.
Must be nice having the privilege to try and equate Biden to trump without worry lmao
I was LIVING when Kamala called Biden out in multiple debates, mainly for his support of segregation. Kamala definitely has the ability to hold Biden accountable.
I wish Biden would’ve chosen Stacey Abrams
If you are reading this  stay clear of Biden’s nursing home.  #CuomoKilledGrandma
Sorry. Let me clarify, as anti Kamala I may seem.. please vote for Biden. Kamala and Biden both have their flaws, but are no type of evil when compared to Trump. VOTE, this is not the lesser of two evils but defeating the evil who has proven...
#CuomoKilledGrandma Better run Biden ...he’s after your age bracket!!!
These mfs voting for Trump over Biden because they never had 1k before him 🥴😂
Lots and lots of grandmas and grandpas.  Come to think of it Biden should be terrified around this crowd.      stay away from Joe’s nursing home dammit!!!!
Nice try, At least Trump has better taste  than Biden.  #TaraReade.  Yuck.  Biden should pay her btw .
Everyone, even Republicans, are getting sick of what the pandemic has done to them.  Trump's done nothing for them, but give them crumbs.  Vote for Biden for this madness to be better.  If you don't, I can assure you this will continue for even longer.
your daughter supports Biden/Harris...why can't you be a little like her?
And the Biden family too got rich, hmm hows Hunter and his crack pipe doin’ nowadays.
I think I had forgotten what hope had felt like until it was restored today. Biden/Harris... let’s go!
Both Biden &amp; Harris are moderates and you don't have anything that even comes close to labelling them as radical left.  They are so moderate that many conservatives that are sick of trump will feel at ease that a vote for Joe is a vote for moving America forward out of the gutter
Biden was a senator for a long time and is known as a super genial, get along guy. He’s going to want to work with the other side and make deals. What Trump should have done.
is voting for joe Biden strictly for kampala Harris
Just like we were last election right?  😂😂😂😂😂 Biden already had no chance and this made his chances even worse 😂😂😂 Dems don’t even want to vote for him 😂😂😂
- Joe Biden will be a great running mate.
By the end of January with Biden/Harris there will be....for the good of the nation
All the Sander voters that vote Biden will get nothing they hoped for. This is all a set up from top Dems. You can bank that!
I never said I was for Trump? What I said is I thought Biden would pick Rice and the Dems would move Biden out and Harris would be VP. NOW I just say swap them around. I do like any one of these lady’s more than Biden. He will never make it through his 1st year.
democrats are so fucking stupid as usual.  I’ll vote for biden because he’s not trump- but kamala is hillary level bad.  idiots.
Trump saying that the Spanish flu probably ended WWII was either a cognitive slip (dementia) or willful ignorance. He said it within the last day or so. That you think Trump's statement has no equivalency with cracks about Biden having dementia is laughable.

Bigger Harris/Biden numbers coming in November!
Every time Trump or surrogate talks about Biden gaffes they should just play Trump talking about 1917 flu and it ended WW II.
The only presidential candidate we were ever globally comfortably voting for was Obama. Them days are over with. Don’t just expect poc to pick between biden &amp; trump, it’s all fucked up.
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's running mate: Live updates. Yes!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Biden made the right choice asking Harris to be his running mate. Her debates with Pence should be good.
Congratulations!!!  I am excited to vote for Biden/Harris!!!
I really don’t like Biden or Kamala Harris but I hate trump lol
Biden has picked Harris to be his VP. This ticket will be responsible for putting more black folks in chains than pre civil war
Biden/Harris 2020!  I'm feeling very positive! :)
With Biden being so pro cop and prison..... and with Kamala’s resume.... I’m a tad afraid
Great pick!!!  Can't wait to vote for Biden/Harris!!!!!  #BlueWave
Biden picks Kamala Harris for VP running mate.  better get ready! #snl
Didn't Harris pretty much accuse Biden of being a racist at one of the Dem debates?
And that was the final Nail in Biden’s chances 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If the pick is truly in, Biden should make the announcement ASAP. The longer he waits, the greater the probability that the VP choice will be leaked.
Rice will make history 1st woman VP and President and wait! history yet again A WOMAN PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT RUNNING THE UNITED STATES. PRESIDENT RICE AND VP HARRIS. this is already the setup if Biden wins and the Dems will close there eyes to Biden family Ukraine deals.

A vote for Biden is a vote for PRESIDENT RICE and VP to be announced at later date maybe Harris. Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.
Rice would be the best pick for Biden. And Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.PRESIDENT RICE VP to be announced at later date maybe Harris

Big unemployment numbers! Big TRMPVD19 numbers! Big death toll numbers. Big Biden poll numbers!
Could we try not to put the cart before the horse? Trump made a similar statement prior to the election in 2016. This is a given, I'm not sure stating the obvious out loud is going to persuade people to vote Biden, in fact, it may cause some to not.
I am hoping that it will be former U.S.ambassador Susan Rice (  ; with Senator Kamala Harris ( as my second choice.
That sounds like a Trump campaign ad. "This is the America Joe Biden wants!"
Trump doesn't lose, so whoever Biden picks as VP is irrelevant.
I will cancel your vote for Dementia Biden

Kamala But I'm down with Bass as well. It's his choice and I'm going with Biden's choice.
Thank you sir. President Biden.
Joe Biden as a Muppet? Now there’s an idea! Thank you Raymond Arroyo on Laura Ingraham. #FoxNews
He promised a woman. We’re getting a woman. Pete is trending because, I believe there was a chartered flight from South Bend to Biden’s regional airport (because, you know, #ElectionTwitter is 👀). Secretary of State offer?

Joe Biden owns Fox News reporter during morning bike ride
I read someone’s comment that said he’s probably calling everyone in and giving them a face-to-face “Thanks for your participation. It’s not you” talk ..   Sounds like something Biden would do ...
The media is giving Biden a pass for his cognitive decline and his obvious racist point of view.
Biden’s Choice
Mooch, you need to see someone about your ”sour grapes” jealousy and anger. Either you were never a Republican or you are as crazy as the rest of the #NeverTrumpers. No true Republican would support Biden he has become a toxic radical. Win Trump win!
That Biden will drop out of the race...
After the election the Covid hoax will end, and Biden and the DemocRATs will scamper back into their rat holes.
Biden and Trump are not the best our country has to offer.  There are other options and we NEED to acknowledge them to break this broken two-party system.  #LetHerSpeak
It’s political. The more things they can shut down the better for Biden. Next will be Halloween!
Biden sold our manufacturing to the Chinese, the same country that caused the DemocRATS to scare our country into shutting down!1
If you support Trump, please unfollow me. Seriously...I pointed out on a thread (on FB) about Biden having a stutter (aka a disability) and someone used the "laugh" emoji. Really??  REALLY?  Deplorable much?
60-40 is actually really good for Democrats in Hartland (I know, I know...yard signs don’t translate to votes). Looks like Trump won 61-32 in ‘16. Honestly, I wouldn’t expect to see any Biden signs out there.
Ok this might be the level of tweet I can expect Biden to have actually sent

Biden claims that Black people are all alike, just more proof that #RacistJoe is racist.
You are absolutely right his run for the office is just a ploy just ignore him and vote for Biden
Biden and Obama raided Medicare to pay for a failed program called “Obamacare.” They cheated us! This program was supposed to bring down healthcare costs for all American citizens. That’s one of the most infamous lies of the century!
Trump sets the debate rules, not Biden.
I heard them dissecting Biden's gaffe. I had to shut it off. Yesterday, Trump said he created an executive order to force insurance to cover pre existing conditions; something the ACA already does, but they're focusing on a Biden misstatement, already explained &amp; apologized for.
I'm much more concerned about the money men, the people like Sheldon Adelson who are the source of all that dark money pouring into Kentucky to keep Mitch and others like him than the noisy, but dumb Fox - saw a clip yesterday where they thought Biden really said he'd chosen a VP
Biden couldn’t even come up with the words to say that. Oh, well he could with 2 hrs of prompting. He’s just a puppet on a string.
I’d pay thousands of dollars for a front row seat at the Bible quiz contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump! 😂 #TrumpIsNotAChristian #TrumpIsDefinitelyNotEvangelical #SexWithPornStarsIsNotChristian

Here’s a new one. My niece said her FIL sent a message to my niece’s daughter, saying that if she voted for Biden, he’d disinherit her. She’ll be a first time voter. She told him to go ahead and do it! 🤣🥰 Proud of her!
“You’re not Black if you don’t vote for me.” I don’t know about anyone else, but I would never let Joe Biden define me no matter what color I am. A 47-year political failure like Joe “China” Biden, has no game whatsoever. Accept maybe making his family rich on taxpayer time.
Thank you.  I was just going to tweet how this is a further move to dictatorship if EO is allowed to go forward.  If, as I hope, Trump is not re-elected, Biden is going to have a real task in putting the Constitution back together from the shredder.
I never seen those quotes man. Guess I should've googled all the racist shit Biden spewed beforehand huh? My bad
What, you think Biden has a solution? Let's hear it!
No cozy bear. It's quite alive and well.
To tell you the truth, I think that Biden is too far gone to win. My concern is losing the House and Senate.
Biden's plan is the Green New Deal, which is unacceptable, face it, Biden is a loser!
If Twitter calls out fake information then why doesn’t this get flagged as a lie because Biden couldn’t possible send a tweet.  His handlers should have to admit authorship to make this a true tweet.
I guess it’s about the Biden’s (and others’m) involvement with Barisma.  Sounds like our money was stolen then laundered initially through Barisma and back to America possibly sitting within one or more construction companies.  Criminal charges means there’ll be a jury.
Biden wants to stop all oil exploration drilling, fracking, and wants to shut down coal power plants. The guy is a clown!
Exactly. I am convinced the "pick is in".  It would be a glorious weekend for many if Biden made his pick known today.I hope you are tweeting about what a shitty candidate he is AND how he was NOT the one we nominated! Obama chose Biden. Obama is not our friend!
And We should be LIVID! Biden=gag
As long as you anti Biden we good
Quite the read
Bernie was #1, Biden was #4...Obama pulled a coup. He had everyone drop out. Bernie refused to. So, he was threatened.  Obama still thinks he's in charge, as do the Clintons. Electoral College could be absolutely brilliant and name Bernie Sanders president.

If he’s gonna accuse him of lying then he should ask him specifically about 1 or 2 “lies”, it’s like asking Joe Biden “Your plans are terrible, aren’t they?” Biden asks what plans in particular, “Your plans”, can’t blame someone for not answering an actual question

Frankly, this former Republican is excited and enthused.  I’ve made a donation to the Biden Harris campaign.
Thank you for accurately writing about Biden’s Catholic faith. He is being disingenuous; it’s sad to see him deceived. His actions don’t follow Catholic teachings. Although he ‘feels comfort’, many Bishops are trying to discomfort/save him by refusing him Holy Communion.
Tara Reade: Media Should Challenge Kamala Harris on Biden Accusers  via
Should compare current polls to 2016 results, we saw in that election how Trump got less votes than Romney in certain states like Wisconsin, but Trump ended winning the state anyways, I doubt the turnout for Biden will be as high as Obama
Sorry, what now?
ahhh as usual, it always come back to mentioning Trump :) Taking credit for other's work huh? So like, Biden's entire economic plan?
Biden: “I’m the fourth Catholic, presidential nominee.”  Also Biden: “Abortions are an essential service!”  Umm, you can’t have it both ways.

2 reasons I like the Kamala Harris as VP pick 1. Bad candidate that’ll hurt Biden’s chances 2. More Maya Rudolph as Harris on SNL, her impersonation is hilarious
Biden and Kamala as a “progressive” ticket is LOL  I wonder how many incarcerated black ppl they’re responsible for combined
Who was the last Catholic on a Democratic ticket? Since you’ve excommunicated Biden sub silentio, surely no other Democrat can have qualified.
Okay, so if you have a problem with Kamala for being complicit in a culture of mass incarceration, you probably weren’t gonna vote for Biden anyway (because he is absolutely complicit in that same culture). If you were on the fence and Kamala is the dealbreaker... that’s dumb.

In 2008, the VP night (Wednesday) had a slot for "Vice Presidential Acceptance Speech" and also slots for 4 of the people on the shortlist for the spot - Biden, Bayh, Richardson and Senator Reed.   They've filled the hole before.
When they announced the 2008 speakers (11 days before Biden was announced), the Wednesday night line-up listed "Vice Presidential Acceptance Speech" and also speeches from 4 of the people believed to be on the shortlist for VP (Biden, Bayh, Richardson and Reed).
Here’s the press briefing book for the 2008 DNC for the third day. Note that there’s a slot for VP and also one for Biden.   This came out August 12, 2008, 11 days before Biden was announced.   So, it’s probably not a leak.

And if Bernie can't win without moderate support? Sadly, too many Americans still fear socialism.  I came from Canada. Grew up in a Social Democracy. Majority of Americans have no idea how good it can be. They are not ready. Which is why Biden won.
Biden or Trump as president!
Do you realize Obama picked Biden on August 23, 2008, when his convention started August 25?   I think it’ll be okay.
Looking at a different model, maybe?  Aug. 23, ‘08 - Obama picks Biden. Aug. 11, ‘12 - Romney picks Ryan. Aug. 29, ‘08 - McCain picks Palin. Aug. 8, ‘00 - Gore picks Lieberman Aug. 10, ‘96 - Dole picks Kemp. Aug. 16, ‘88 - Bush picks Quayle.
Right. Biden is just saying anything he can to make trump look bad cuz biden knows he does not have a chance to win this thing
NOBODY wants a Biden presidency...at least not anyone intelligent.
When Biden wins
Not to mention burn down and steal from businesses, kill and mame police, riot and set up camps, ummmm oh and have biden rallies, oh wait. No one goes to those
Joe biden has not condemned these riots. Trump had to send in troops to gaurd FEDRERAL PROPERTY. It is the democratic leaders in these states to stop these riots in their states and clearly they dont want to.
Ya. Thats what he is doing. In other news joe biden doesn’t lie. Stop with the ignorance

Also show me the exact legal documents showing "Trump" not anyone else,  that he colluded with Russia.  If you say his associates were charged, then you prove in this picture that Biden is a Racist by association.
Explain why Biden is holding hands with a known racist.  Are you so 🧠 washed you cannot see?  This is a what is wrong with the left.  If this were Trump holding hands with the KKK you would never hear the end of it.  You haven't addressed the picture that is clearly relevant.Rural Minnesota depresses me.

Kamala Harris is probably the least genuine out of every woman on Biden's VP shortlist. And while I don't think that helps against Trump, I'm personally happy about this because it means that she has already alienated progressives and will be much easier to primary in 2024
Biden would be pleased 😉

It’s like every critical thought against Harris when she was up against Gabbard and Warren has been forgotten as the collective mass of Democrats are dropped on their heads for Biden’s success. Don’t we remember how artificial this woman was in interviews?
That was painless. I think Biden hit a home run. You?
I feel we will all be pretty goddamn tired if trump wins again.  You want to hold Biden/Harris’ feet to the fire when they get elected?  Great.  Do that.  But we will not have any fucking accountability if we let the current administration back in.

Oh for sure! The Biden bit in Parks did not age well.

Much of them didn’t even vote for Biden though? They voted for other candidates who all simultaniously jumped ship, then gave their votes to Biden whether the voters wanted or not.

They must get called junkies all the time in order not to care about it!   Biden's 'diversity,' 'Are you a junkie?' gaffes ignored by Sunday morning news shows

Remember when “Biden can’t speak and has dementia?” So does this bitch lmao, don’t use that to say Biden isn’t fit for office when dumbass over here does this same shit
Sorry but i doubt Biden will be able finish to his 1st term as president due to his mental health, he's 80 yrs old! I'm sure the black vice pres know that!   Black male leaders warn Biden ‘will lose’ election if he doesn't name Black female running mate

Sounds like a Threat! Since Biden is a democrat its probably just a joke what can the black males do?  Black male leaders warn Biden ‘will lose’ election if he doesn't name Black female running mate

How if Biden gets rid of Mnuchin's ass?
This is scary, I have a feeling that if Biden wins, Trump is going to wreak as much destruction as he can before leaving White House. The man is evil to the core.
How is it a cheap shot?   She just made a statement that many people were thinking.   Trump hits Biden with lots of cheap shots regarding his age and ability.   People who live in glass houses...............
Unreal huh? Lol  Millions of people in the world and thats all the left has to offer? Dillusional Biden....
Would it kill him to mention Joe Biden? #FuckBernie

Facts:  Only 36 children in America aged 1-15 have died from the Chinese Coronavirus  At least 317 died during the Swine Flu outbreak during the Obama/Biden Administration  I don’t remember the media trying to keep schools closed then What changed?  🤔
Biden is already being told what to do! It will be like this times ten "if" he's elected!  Who will be his manager after Maxine Waters &amp; November, again if he or she wins! Oh I meant he!  Maxine Waters: Biden ‘can’t go home without a Black woman being VP’
The American people will have an October surprise if Barr’s nonsense is overtly unconstitutional or illegal. Arrest Joe Biden? This country will shut down in a national strike.
Isn't this a type of fraud that Biden can use against tRump, if people were mailed ballots or absentee ballots they have the end of December to be counted if they didn't receive it call your clerk of courts take your vote.
Biden should be wearing a bike helmet though!
This is hilarious. Fox News says Biden tells their reporter he’s picked a running mate after Biden bicycles by and answers the question with: “Yeah, I have. ... (It’s) you.”

I am going in person. In a hazmat suit, for ten hours if I must be to vote for Joe Biden. I am going to erect billboards, drive people to vote and anything else I can do to destroy these  Republican Trumpian fascist bastards.
really the only remotely interesting outcome of the Biden vice president thing is whatever makes the khive melt down most spectacularly. put me down for wanting that, whatever it isIf you vote for Trump you ain’t black.   If you vote for Biden you’re a fucking idiot.
Yes on all accounts not a Biden fan but we gotta get rid of Trump.  Damn 2 party system sucks here. Hopefully implement a different system someday when ppl get smarter!
“What’s actually happening”, wtf does that mean. You can drive everywhere and see Trump signs and Biden signs. Doesn’t matter where the fuck you are

Oops I am so sorry.... If Biden &amp; Harris win.
Well ID Niden &amp; Harris win we are screwed period Biden has always been racist, check it out. Why does government allows section eights it ruined the area I lived in. They get a half the price break out in nice suburbs. I am fed cons. Yet lower got changes. David J Harris UTube!!
Does Joe Biden know more than a single health official quoted in this article?
Many here want universal health coverage. Unless we get a Democratic majority in the Senate (or find some long-lost Republican moderates), the bill won't reach Biden's desk. What's important for the election is to flip the Senate. Then we can talk tactics. Need more on Team Blue.
Biden was probably in my top 10, but not too 5.  I definitely agree with this sentiment though.
I’m just so tired of the shit where anyone remotely criticizes Biden or Harris and some lib is like “okay I guess you want trump to win then” as if that’s an argument
Dude liberals really think “at least he’s not Trump” is a good argument for Joe Biden. At best he’ll choose marginally better SC Justices, but honestly pretty sure libs just think trump is obnoxious and mean and think the country would look better with someone else.
For them to embrace to political left is for them to reject the corporate donations that keep them rich and powerful, and that won’t happen, so of course Biden would rather choose Harris and fight for conservative votes than skew remotely to the left.
It makes no sense to say “push Biden left,” because the political left lies on a wholly different spectrum from neoliberalism. That’s why conservative politicians can support trump but liberal politicians won’t support Bernie; Trump didn’t question capitalism and Bernie did.
Or until Nov ... right Biden? I’m pretty sure that’s how this will work
Has there ever been a high profile political figure more ripe for SNL-style satire than Joe Biden?   But they don't ever go there, do they? Even SNL's treatment of him during the debate was very gentle.  Huh. Wonder why that is?  #TCNT

Biden Harris is a good start to clean up the messes created by trump pence and GOP. I state the obvious.
She doesn't need to "walk back" that statment.  She is right on the money.  Biden will NOT be the candidate.  Remember this.... "change of batter coming"
I'm looking for suggestions for the Biden/Harris cabinet.  Ideas?
Ready.  All Blue all the time.  Crucial that Biden had a New Democratic Leader in the Senate.  Cannot get the legislation through that we need without a majority in the Senate and the House.

Biden can lose Florida and still win if he gets Wisconsin and Arizona
Like the dipshit who just asked if Biden should publicly denounce Antifa? WITAF kind of question is that?
is saying #Biden will be killed, or die?   go talk to this Cowardly people who can say this
You're gonna vote for Joe Biden. You support Keith Ellison. You probably supported Al Franken and would again. Drop the Southern belle act.

for me at least i see trump as a symptom of a broken system not him being the cause per se. a lot of how we got to this point is purely because of the tough on crime stance that dems took in the late 80s and 90s (spearheaded by biden) to appeal to conservatives.
i would if i had faith that the same wouldnt happen under biden/kamala esp considering kamala's track record

The Trump Biden comparisons are pissing me off. Have you guys not been paying attention to the world under Trump?? Biden would be miles better and we cannot afford another four years of Trump. What’s not clicking???
I think he was trying to intimate that Harris was so critical of Biden, that Trump wanted her to run with him
To those who think Biden/Harris aren't progressive enough--If progressive legislation is passed in Congress, Biden will sign it.  That's why down-ballot races are so important. Execs set the tone, but Congress is where the work will get hammered out.  Vote Blue in all contests.
Biden selects Kamala Harris as running mate ----&gt; Biden is now "on the clock" and has become expendable.   Hopefully no [187], but these folks don't care.
Republicans are failing to realize.  Kamala Harris isn't running for president! Joe Biden will be the one that'll wipe the floor with Trump!
I figure most of the progressive agenda needs legislative work.  That just makes down-ballot races crucial.  Don’t fret about Biden/Harris. Work hard to get Democrats elected to Congress and state houses.  Pay attention to any judges on the ballot, too.
Biden/Harris 2020 all the way. #DumpTrump2020
Biden/Harris 2020. Make America Sane.
If both #BLM and the #MeToo movements were consistent and not just Democrat voting machines, they would both be opposed to a Biden candidacy. Kamala Harris joining the ticket does nothing to help the credibility of either movement. #TCNT

Campaign for Biden/Harris like they are 10 points behind! Get out there and work your ass off for these two great people...
It’s about to get bigger.
Coulda been a wet rag and I’d still vote Biden.
Ok. So I guess Joe Biden will be on soon. You know. So he doesn’t have politics on one side.
You do realize that Biden is only three years older than Trump? Rightwing polllsters have already given up on polling and realize Biden is going to win. Doesn’t matter, it’s much more important to end Trump’s presidency.
I bet you were all over Joe Biden the other day too. But now, you can say we don’t look at facts and that’s ok? You see that hypocrisy. When it’s good for you, the rest of us can’t comprehend. When it’s bad it’s oh don’t lump us all together. Right??
Anybody who is triggered by my tweets, rest assured, if Hilary or Biden were proving themselves as incompetent, I’d say the same thing. I could care less about right, left, or upside down. This country needs leadership and we do not have it.
Amy called Biden and asked to be dropped from consideration.  She actually told Biden she was withdrawing because she believed the 2020 VP pick should be a woman of color.
Right...they've all done something we don't like.  I'll never forget how Biden treated Anita Hill (in the Clarence Thomas hearings), but that doesn't mean I won't vote for him.
Good grief! And, he and his two sons like to talk about Biden????? #DementedDon
Secure drop boxes are a great idea, especially since we just had an actual *theft* of a mailbox over the weekend.  Who knew mailboxes could be stuffed in a van?  Not trying to unjustly accuse but it doesn't seem like something a Biden supporter would do.
Just listen to yourself.  You sound like a toddler and act like one. How embarrassing for the President of the United States to act so immature. I want a real man as a President and that would be  Biden
Fox news finally admitted that Sarah Palin was a big mistake as John McCain  VP pick. Fox News also think that Joe Biden VP  pick would be something worse than Palin.  Fox news is wrong again! No one can be that horrible! Fox turns on Palin.
The administration.  Is covering for Russian interference , in American elections. They would like people to think , China and Iran want Biden to win. To downplay Russian interference. It's also give Trump an opportunity to say, China and Iran rigged the election in Biden favor!
Trump.  Is going to cry like a naked baby when he loses on November 3rd.  People should vote for Biden just to see that fiasco!
There’s all these things then I hear someone say “Biden seems creepy, that’s why I won’t vote for him”???
I dare you to race Biden on bicycles...winner is President.
What if Biden DID die at some point earlier this year and they DID make a hologram of him to keep up the charade, but in a Star Trek Holodeck-esque mishap, the hologram escaped and HE'S the one running for president. 🤔🤔🤔
Kanye said he wanted to pull votes away from Biden. Which voters do you think are watching Fox?
Tbf, Biden's main platform is "I'm not Trump" so they're both doing it
America.  No matter how many gaphs Biden might make his heart will always be in the right place. Trump.  Is a cruel and evil man and so are his supporters. They all need to be brought down a notch! ROME IS BURNING!
Nothing wrong with saying how we can all do better.  I think the Professor did a fine job of saying how Biden can improve, rather than just identifying his shortfalls. Nuance is a good thing.Biden has to go virtual. If not in a que card he loses it. He is senile
No. If mail-in voting actually works and doesn't result in massive election fraud, the next thing we're going to see is in-home artificial insemination kits. Of course, if the Democrats win, those kits will contain Joe Biden's sperm.
ur right nobody said that either of them were good people but at least biden has taken leadership and has beliefs. just because you are privlaged does not mean that you are the only on in the world luv❤️
Which one of these ladies is gonna outlive Trump and Biden
They only worry about that when there is a Black person in the White House. So, if Biden/Harris win, they will suddenly appear and be super vocal again.
I sincerely hope Biden insists on debating Trump in person and when time comes to shake hands I hope he kisses the bastard.  We need to step up to this, the fight of our lives.
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign raised $48 million in the 48 hours after he selected...
True but in no way ever should trump do a virtual debate. That eould be a massive biden win.
Honestly i will sit out on this one, Doesn’t really matter who wins india should have a good relationship. Modi made a serious diplomatic mistake by telling people to suppot Trump, while Many Indian diaspora support Biden and Kamala and majority of people of color in this country
Nope! If Trump wins they’ll claim fraud with mail-in ballots and if Biden wins they’ll claim fraud with mail-in ballots. Inevitably Stacey Abrams will emerge from the fog as the *actual* victor 😂

I'm glad that Susan Rice won't be VP.  I wish I knew that she won't have another job in the potential Biden administration.
Biden can refuse debates but i dont see how it wont hurt him given he can go to funerals and do events with media present.  Than say no i cant debate in a room with10 people? If thats the case he better stay in his basement from now on or he looks likees a total coward.
More than Biden can say: that asshole can’t even take one question from the press!
More than biden and kamalhoe had.
Just look at a biden rally.
"We" created 90 % of the problems since 1980 in an effort to solve some other problems, and generally made things worse. Law of unintended consequences. The best laid plans of mice and men. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Biden, Harris, and Klobouchar meant well
No he wasn’t.  40,000 entered the US from China after his failed ban. It took him 75 days to do anything.  VP Biden said, shut it down and wear masks in January.   Trump disregarded the pandemic response plan, gave 16 tons of PPE to China in early January.
Lol some people aren't on the left. Last time I checked it's a group of Republicans forming together to vote for Biden and get Trump out for good. So what do you call them?? I'll wait.
I’m socialist and the people making attacking trump for his brothers death need to stop regardless of your opinion about trump death is hard to deal with especially when it’s someone so close, I hope Biden calls on people to stop harassing trump on this.
Ask Biden for a comment hidden in his basement.
Biden is the most cowardly candidate for President that I've ever seen.
What an absolutely false story. What did Biden have to say?  Oh that’s right, we can’t hear him through the basement walls.
Here to say that the cookie poll had Biden in the lead.
Obama Biden White House was the most corrupt administration in our history.
The GOP is for pardoning wrongly pilloried whistleblowers that were appallingly driven from their home country. Yeah, and Joe Biden is for medicare-for-all
The good news for Peterson, is that 2020 *right now* looks like a year more resembling 2018 and Biden is likely to perform more along the lines of Walz or Smith in the 7th as opposed to Clinton's 2016 performance. Over-performing Biden by 15-20 is doable, by 30+ may not be.
Always hot air with no action. Your buddy Carolyn Maloney has a meeting with the scuz Dejoy on Sept 17!! That'll get the job done!! If you guys had an ounce of fight in you, you might win a battle. I'm voting Biden because Trump. That's it.

No Biden’s. It’s very obvious he has a problem. And shame in his family to put him through this.
Really... are you that dense to see Biden has dementia???
Biden’s overuse of adverbs is honestly so offputting. If I have to read “badly” or “deeply” one more time in a statement
Who does he want us to vote for then? I mean, we don’t know if Biden will reduce or stop bombing. We DO know Trump increased it.🤷‍♂️
So...did Trump stop bombings? I mean, I agree it would be great if a vote for Biden would end bombing other countries. But even if he cannot promise that? Right now I have to consider what is going on in my country. With the wanna be fascist. 🤷‍♂️
Trump's virus plan utilized the wonderdul concept called Federalism: let states decide. Democrats, always in love with massive influence by the federal govt, wants to issue orders like a King.  Never ever ever vote for a Democrat
Its over,  Biden is President.  We can just skip voting. The Swifties have been engaged.

THANK YOU!!!
It's 2020 and Biden has no problem calling out and condemning racism and white supremacy. President Pussy Grabber can't bc he doesn't want to lose his racist base. If you admit racism is an issue and don't feel compelled to do something about it, then you're part of the problem.
Biden is going to have to campaign in **New York** to keep Trump from flipping it. That tells me every “Swing state” is already solid Trump. As long as people show up on November 3rd &amp; don’t take my bold predictions for granted, Biden is not going to win.
Your cult leader is a 4x draft dodger but Biden is a coward?  Lmaoooooooo
Trump is asked about the dumb citizenship thing w/Harris. He say's he just heard about it, he didn't know, WOULD NOT be looking into it. So 'I don't care' Framed as he brought it up &amp; that he's trying to push the rumor. Pathetic Biden doesn't need to campaign, media does for him.
We knew exactly what Biden was at the time - a bone tossed to older white folks. We also knew what he'd done and hated it but figured it was a harmless place for him to retire.  Clearly we were wrong.

Mr. Biden,  Tear down that wall!  White House continues to build new 13-foot high 'anti climb' wall.
If they think it's bad for Biden to vote 'yes', (which I can't verify yet) then it's bad for Sanders to do so, too.  If they bring it up, direct them to his vote.
Trump has the Soldiers and the Cops!  Democrats have the Looters and the Russian Bots!
Didn't Biden's boss claim that we needed a 'magic wand' to bring manufacturing jobs back?
Hmmm, Biden says wear masks for three months. About election time I think, hmmm
His response to COVID could’ve been better? I’v heard Biden ride his ass about how terrible his response has been. In Jan. when Trump banned travel to/from China all Biden did was bitch about how racist it was. I’ve yet to hear what he would’ve done differently other mask mandate
Even a mannequin is progressive next to Trump, or the Trump Republicans.  The Biden/Harris ticket has moved further to the left because of progressive input and I expect them to listen even more to all voices.
The votes are recorded at the link below.  Biden isn't on it but scroll down to VT and see Sanders' 'Yes' vote.  Don't let the bros gaslight even more.
Bros are trying to diss Biden by saying he voted for the USPS pre-funding mandate, which was part of H.R.6407 - Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act in 2005-06.  The vote was pretty much unanimous and bipartisan.  I can't find anything about Biden's vote.  Sanders voted aye.
I guarantee you Obama never got these watercraft numbers. I never saw yachts for Hillary or canoes for Biden
Trump has already done things this is not something Biden has actually done.  I asked what HAS he done not what he says he will do.  You didn't answer the question   What has Biden done legislatively for black education in the past 40 years?
You didn't answer the question   What has Biden done legislatively for black education in the past 40 years?
Trump said it would happen. #Democrats planned to steal the election all along. Biden isn't running. Kamala is just outright lying, so it makes sense.
Interesting. If Biden is elected he will have a problem with China because they own him, having financed his brother, other family members business ventures, so it would put China right back in control and America would be at their mercy once again.
No I was trying to find the best way to get this conversation back on topic after you derailed it.  You didn't answer the question. What has Biden done legislatively for black education in the past 40 years?
#EricTrump calls on dopey #JoeBiden to answer for 'very discriminatory' process of picking running mate
No, you used something irrelevant as an excuse to detail the conversation   Now back to my question.  What has Biden done legislatively for black communities in the past 40 years?
Biden's foreign policy platform actually makes the claim that "the world does not organize itself". Messed up on many levels.
I did a 2 year comparison on black education as a way to show Biden has done nothing and you took it as a chance to deflect to comparing Obama and Trump. You were the one who mentioned economy first.  You brought are the one who derailed the entire conversation   I baited you

I'm just wondering why the press hasn't got to ask one question of Biden yet?
Hey Jim, Biden hasn't taken one question from the press. Are you going to start shouting questions at him?
On a 3,000 mile trip from Mn to Yellowstone thru Montana returned thru Wyoming - I saw one Biden sign.
Your strong desire to put Biden in spotlight and everyone’s inability to control the “best brain- stable genius” from saying the most god awful un American things, is so pathetic. You will be remembered as a hack partisan for a failed and treacherous president.
Since Donny doesn’t actually answer questions, he just spews garbage and misleading info and outright lies. So comparison is invalid.  You must really be able to see that trump is not electable.  The election isn’t about Biden, it’s about trump and the future of democracy.
Time for a national Biden ad on this ASAP.

oh and look according to a black college source Trump is doing more for black education than Obama  What has Biden done legislatively for black education in the past 40 years?
Newt honey, you know Joe Biden is Catholic.  And he actually attends church.  As well he didn't bang his mistress before his wife died.  So I am thinking, no, just no.
Exactly, he didn't.  And yet you trust him as somebody who will actually do something.  No wonder Demokkkrats feel so entitled to the black vote Biden can say things like of you don't support him "you ain't black"
Hey Joe? (China) Yes? (Biden). I will trade you one dollar for five. Okay. Lol
this range of debate is a big step forward and market signal!  "She also favors a ban on fracking, a position that could put her at odds with Mr. Biden, who has called for a ban on new leases on federal lands but stopped short of calling for a comprehensive ban."
And yet basement Biden wants them to be controlled as they were in any other area in the county.
Biden didnt draft the fair sentencing act nor was it his legislature. Also the fair sentencing act did nothing to release.  You didn't answer the question. Why didn't Biden do his job and draft legislature to free the people mass incarcerated by his bill?
Biden/Harris hats are made in the USA
My point is that for people in rural America their bubble is real. I’ve driven all over the five state area, and Texas recently, and I didn’t see any Biden signs either. Yes it’s a banjoland take but he’s not wrong about what he see’s in his bubble.

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
I sure do. Biden warned the country in January. "Trump is worst possible leader to deal with coronavirus outbreak"
Trump does nothing but lie and gaslight.  Why do you still report every word he speaks?   "Trump says Biden is a horse" "Harris isn't American" Why even show up at his events?
Biden has been an elected official for 16 years after his crime bill, why hasn't he done his job and drafted legislature to free the black men his bill mass incarcerated?
Say  you know that the Democratic Nominee is  right?  I mean, you can say his name, right?  Is writing Joe Biden just as hard to say as #BlackLivesMatter?   #HRCommunity #HR
Warren used the goodwill built with Biden by not endorsing Bernie to get some of her biggest platform points adopted by Biden. She was arguably the runner up for VP and she’s widely touted as the Party’s policy mind. I will just never understand these paramecium-brained takes.
Talking about any kind of norms and Trump in the same sentence is hysterical. We have spent almost 4 years saying “but precedent is “... then watched Trump blow all that up. So insisting Biden does something cuz Trump does? Hahahahaha!
Because: you can’t take Biden winning Illinois for granted. Voting for a third party is literally going to do nothing to make either of them bend to your views. People need to be smarter in voting than expressing their brand affinity.
Guys, let’s hope he makes the ballot in all swing states .  He will hurt Trump more than Biden.  Both of them are competeing for the same idiots...  Let them struggle with this epic choice of which of these fools to support...
Biden not wearing mask ?
All I can think is the DNC is worried Beto’s passion and dynamic crowd skills will steal the spotlight from Biden. I’m at a loss for any other explanation.
2. Poor districts have struggled to implement. This is about poverty and wealth, pure and simple. Top priority for a Biden administration. One laptop per child.
If you vote for Trump you ain’t black.   If you vote for Biden you’re a fucking idiot.
Biden would put them in cages for their own safety.
Yes on all accounts not a Biden fan but we gotta get rid of Trump.  Damn 2 party system sucks here. Hopefully implement a different system someday when ppl get smarter!
Don’t get your education of political leaders from memes because they are created to incite division. Look at what her current platform is. All I know is anyone other than Biden is a vote for tRump, who has a complete disregard for the black community that far outweighs anyone🇺🇸

I still can't believe anyone thought Biden was a good idea.
I think we are all on the same side here and should come together to find the best way to coordinate our voices so our combined 1,000 followers who are definitely already going to vote for Joe Biden vote for Joe Biden.
Joe Biden is playing on the stupidity of America. Absontee ballots are different then mail in voting.

#HillaryClinton wans to serve #Biden Do NOT let this happen
Joe Biden is Silent Generation and Kamala Harris is technically on the cusp of Boomer and Gen X but Idk how you can look at old pics of her, her fashion, taste in music, or her life story and say she is anything other than Gen X.
Nope. I'm waiting because if Biden wins, the street prices go up.
ok so guys the plan is to pressure biden to the left. but you can't say or do anything to pressure him to the left. tres gauche.
I wonder if we  are putting too much weight on our enthusiasm lead. My wife knows karens who dont like biden but are still voting strickly based on trump hate. Maybe it really doesnt mean much.
For sure nothing will change if we give up. I have faith that he will be thrown out of office, and Biden will be the next president.

Biden speaks the truth so reporters don't need to ask so many questions.  Besides, you are the current President so people have the right to know what you are going to do with the     s%%t storm we are in!
Guess who started racist gun control and currently wants gun control. Demokkkrats Guess who drafted the most recent mass incarceration policy. Demokkkrat Joe Biden Guess who mass incarcerated black Americans for weed. Demokkkrat Kamala Harris.

FLORIDA DUDE POLL.  Arizonap Trump 51%, Biden 40%, and others/undecided 9%.  Lol
Oh yeah I'm with you. Biden drafted mass incarceration policy and Kamala mass incarcerated black Americans.  I intend to vote Kanye so I can screw over Biden without voting for Trump.  Blame your party for screwing Yang.
Bunnies for Biden!
Oh so him naming a woman that mass incarcerated black Americans for weed yet laughed about smoking doesn't lose your vote?  How about Biden drafting the 94 crime bill which contributed to the mass incarcerations of thousands of black Americans.? Oh by the way he defends that bill
Don't be scared. Vote Biden Harris!  Moral of the tweet.... Don't vote Republican!
Had your party not screwed Yang I would have voted for them.  Instead it chose Biden who drafts mass incarceration policy and Kamala who mass incarcerates black Americans.  I'm gonna vote Kanye to screw the Dems without voting for Trump.
Trump's an idiot but I'm not voting for Biden/Harris. Biden drafted the mass incarceration policies of 94 and Harris mass incarcerated black Americans for weed. So honestly I just wanna screw them over.  I'll vote for Kanye to screw Biden without voting for Trump
Biden gets touchy with kids and raped Tara Reade. You are a hypocrite, just stop.

Speaking of truth...  You must be looking at the reports for Biden.   Get your facts straight.
He pretended I  said Biden was my "shelter"  and pretended you said Trump gave you covid. Guys like that just try to waste your time.
Please just do the same thing for Joe Biden, Mike Pence and Donald Trump.   So simple...yet...somehow this basic concept seems to escape the mass media these days.  Why is that?
! Pure inspiration, sharing how teammates unfamiliar w/voting basics weren’t voting-how to register, what happens when one goes to vote?  Amen to  , demanding DNC 2020 walk the walk. Add proper amt of speakers that look like voters who got Biden this far.
The interesting thing about how the Trump Camp is pushing Kanye is their assumption that 2020 will be another nail bitter in the EC. I guess that's possible, but it's also quite possible Biden will just bulldoze them.
We didn’t have a free election in 2016-Obama/ Biden spied on the Trump campaign and you know it!!
“What’s actually happening”, wtf does that mean. You can drive everywhere and see Trump signs and Biden signs. Doesn’t matter where the fuck you are
Great pic for Biden campaign.
No, we don’t; but we’re in shock. We’re not used to this. We need to wake up. History is the bell to ring for this purpose. I ring it with all my strength. Wake up, America. It is high noon. Wake up, Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer. We are beyond polite politics. We are in crisis.
70% of registered voters want a universal healthcare... Do you think Biden actually wants to win?
Far too many of them supported and voted for it (including Joe Biden)!
It’s all about showmanship with #TraitorTrump. Biden should call Trump out as America’s #1 Enemy Combatant!
70% of registered voters want a universal healthcare. If Biden wants to win, he knows what to add to his platform.
Your wife is performing a public service. You've heard of the strategic stockpiles - the ones that Obama supposedly left without any ventilators or cures for Covid-19 (which hadn't occurred yet).   She's stockpiling butter for when Biden-Harris outlaw cows (which Pence claims).
I would prefer you call him President Biden!
No, I don't like authoritarian right-wingers—Biden, Trump, or Harris.
has a lot of bad takes. They all fully supported Trump in 2016.  Can't wait till they beg and steal people's money to turn on Biden. #snakeoilsalesmen
The jaded Bernie bro types would have us believe the ‘evil DNC’ twice stopped Bernie from earning critical African American support in a Democratic primary. That failing is NOT Hillary’s fault, nor Joe Biden’s (nor Elizabeth Warren’s). Bernie can look in a mirror.
Warren has “earned” a place in Biden’s Cabinet. It’s not like  didn’t share her plans on “structural change” policies Biden has put forward. Why do women have to “earn their place” when most of what men do is play w/ themselves to earn it. Try giving birth. That’s work.
Biden's not all there Taylor, come on man.
While you sit &amp; let Trump destroy the USPS to cheat in the Election. The reason Biden will be POTUS is because he is NOT a cruel racist misogynist &amp; alleged sexual predator/rapist trying to destroy our Constitution, the rule of law and our economy. 😊
Who is better for high skilled legal immigrants to resolve GC backlog - Trump or Biden Kamala? EO or CIR? Which is better and realistic? Sorry many questions in one. Thanks!
It’s simple: Biden, or more of the same. Which do you prefer?
Exactly.. and Joe Biden wrote this in January: Trump is worst possible leader to deal with coronavirus outbreak
It doesn't sound good to me.  Biden drafted the 94 crime bill which contributed to the mass incarcerations of many black Americans. Kamala Harris was a prosecutor who incarcerated black Americans for weed.  Sorry, I can't get behind that.  Oh and btw Trump sucks too.
2. He ended up deciding that ending slavery was the best way to do that, but that was not his goal. Biden will face exactly the same kinds of questions, and it will consume his presidency, if he gets one. But Trump and QAnon are not institutions (yet). They cannot be “abolished.”
our problem is that Biden, Trump, and Harris all serve the same interests
Something Biden is too afraid to do.
Did the Biden campaign write this?
WELL, HOPEFULLY IT WON'T BE THAT HARD TO VOTE FOR  BIDEN/HARRIS.       BUT IF trump GETS HIS WAY WHO KNOWS WHAT THE HELL HE WILL DO?      MIGHT BUILD WALLS AROUND POLLING PLACES     LIKE ADOLPH trump MIGHT STATION MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PRIVATE GESTAPO/SS ARMY OUTSIDE POLLING PLACES.
Great article. Trump and his handlers at Fox "News" are viciously launching racist attacks on Kamala Harris. The primary effect of these attacks seems to be increasing support for the Biden/Harris ticket.
What I love is I'm not voting for either candidate.  Trump's an idiot but Biden and Harris are mass incarcerators. I hate mass incarcerators.  So either I will vote for Kanye or if he's not on the ballot, I'll vote for Trump.
The republicans suck but I can't vote for Biden and Harris. The mass incarceration history is the dealbreaker.  I dislike the republicans but I hate the Demokkkrats at this point.  So I'm gonna vote for Kanye to screw Biden. If he drops out I'm voting Trump
The editor's note says Trump did (and is doing) exactly as Biden said he would. Making that headline the focus of the tweet when the real info is that Biden was right does us all a disservice by burying the lead.
The man lies so much you have to dig into the deeper context yourself, and any way you slice it, if you cut entitlements, that includes social security. Biden and Kamala are not wrong here. Stop getting sucked in by Trump's constant deception.
3. But only a root and branch purging of the GOP can forestall it. Biden can’t do that single-handedly. I wonder if even McConnell and House minority leadership could, at this point. If it is beyond them.  “The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.”
Beats anything Trump or Biden are offering. You have my vote!

My Senator Tina Smith, and the woman I voted for in the presidential primary! A great pair. And of course, I’ll be voting Biden/ Harris in the general election too. You’re awesome!
2. This is the unspoken dark subtext of a victorious Biden campaign, that perhaps only the Lincoln Project people are paying attention to. Biden seems to suggest that winning solves everything. It is clear, it does not. Georgia is only the most prominent example.

Joe Biden only serves the interests of wealthy capitalists.
It's higher than 2/3rds. The fact images being shown as what America will be like under Biden are actually America under TRUMP makes almost everything else complete BS.
Biden and Harris are going to win. I wish we could just skip the madness of the next 2.5 months and get on with it.
Once again Republican states. Buy the votes if you have to.. Anything to stay in office. I hope you have to escorted out. I also hope you have long life that you get to spend in front of a camera in a jail cell as they monitor you. #Biden  #TrumpVirus
Trump isn't the cause of our slow journey into fascism. Deteriorating material conditions for an increasing amount of people are. A consolidation of state power by corporate interests is. Massive wealth inequality is. Democratic leadership has helped create this world. Biden too.
...isn't going to end, at least not because Trump. In summary: if Biden wins, boring. If Trump wins: neverending roller coaster of excitement. 5/5
I'm going to admit something that might make me seen like a psychopath. I kinda want Trump to win. Not because I like him or anything. Definitely not enough to vote for him. Just for the entertainment value. If Biden wins, the Republicans will... 1/x
The Biden/Harris combo is a loser.
I read that Biden was trying to take credit for the Israel/UAE peace deal that Trump negotiated, Lmao
"Trump is a fascist so we must vote him out!"  Implies that Biden, an authoritarian that would assume office during a time of capitalist crisis, would not be one.   Fascism is a response to socioeconomic facts, not just a quality of individuals.
This alone is why we vote for Biden.
Dispel with notions that either branch of the neoliberal government will reduce harm. Being blinded by the idea that this current admin isnt simply an extension of the last, and biden wont be an extension of this one is some serious lib shit.
Joe Biden? If you don’t vote for me you ain’t black? Black kids are as smart as white kids?
no, I had one feeling sorry for Biden when she learned about his family tragedies ... "i didn't know that."
WE can admit when people on our side fuck up. Yes, Biden is a racist old man. Just like Trump is!  The problem is you Trump worshippers never call Trump out when he fucks up. Maybe it's because it happens so much that you can't decide which one to choose?
That’s how we Dems know Joe Biden made the right choice.
I agree, but would this be your position if they endorsed Biden?
Any person with even a little sense knows this is stupid. You said all the same things when Obama got elected. Biden is a typical Democrat. He's not going to make any major changes.The fact that you're using hyperbolic hysteria is very telling. You're afraid Trump can't win again
I agree. Its systemic. Trump is just the a very deadly symptom, amongst other deadly symptoms. I just hope people don't stop protesting if Biden does win.
Yeah I'm using my vote on the black candidate with the most pro black platform. Even though Kanye won't win I hope he screws Biden over

I prefer #BidenHarris in the White House. #Biden will bring back some peace of mind for many. Every morning I wake up wondering what did you do overnight, who did you pick a fight with? Keep this in mind, when you go to prison don't pick any fights. #BidenHarris  #Biden
Understanding “what is going on” is not a difficult ask. Neither Biden nor Harris is capable and their handlers and complicit media will do everything to hide that fact.
Two of the three unions endorse Biden!
Agree in principle about off-shoring. OTOH with Biden at least we'd still have a democracy, so I think I'll vote for that. Should have used your checks &amp; balances power to rein in the authoritarian impulses of your glorious leader when you had the chance.

I’m assuming you are savy enough to understand politics is politics.  I’m sure Sanders thought RCV would benefit him, it likely would.  If it benefited Biden,he probably would have supported it.  In Mpls we had to force the change. you want it nationally?  Make it happen
If Kanye drops out I'm voting for Trump   I don't support Trump but I'll do whatever I can to screw Biden over.
It's 2020. Biden has no problem condemning racism and white supremacy. tRump just pretends that he doesn't see a problem or says there are "fine people on both sides", or posts racist dog whistle tweets to his right wing, racist base. But hey, if you like that then vote GOP ✌
Biden cant beat trump. He will never be elected
I'm sick of black Americans still having to feel the effects of Bidens 94 mass incarceration bill.  Trump sucks but nowhere near as bad as Biden.  I'm not voting for either candidate, I'm voting for Kanye West

The Biden-Harris ticket would cuddle Iran and allow it to fully arm.
Kamala incarcerated black Americans for weed and joked about how she smoked weed. She's a racist shit just like Biden.  I'm not voting Trump or Demokkkrat. If either party wants my vote, have a pro black platform  Kanye is my protest vote and I hope he costs Biden the election.
Biden and Harris are coming after your guns.
Look at every democratic run state and city. Like what you see?  If Biden and Harris get in that is America.
So then why are all the Biden people trying to skip out on the debates? Face the music, Biden is senile, will be embarrassed within the first 10 minutes.
Biden and Harris well one is old and has dementia and they other is a liar.  Both are evil.
It's So FUN to be constantly oscillating between voting for Joe Biden to be a "good" person and being an actual good person.
You really are low life. How about you start with Obama and Biden and then work your way up.

How many questions did Biden answer this week?
Are you shocked? One side is calling for them to be defunded, they have lively hoods. Let me guess USPS is supporting Biden. This narrative is tired.
Just be honest for fucks sake. Biden and Harris are trash and Trump is a bigger piece of trash, but everyone is trash. Stop pretending it's a fight between good and evil because it absolutely is not.
If you're going to use voting as harm reduction, the least you could do is also be honest about our choices. Yeah Biden has "only" sexually assaulted one woman as opposed to Trump's dozens of victims, BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM A GOOD MAN OR A GOOD CANDIDATE.
Pence did the same thing for trump. At least Biden has a woman.   Trump should try it.
I see nothing but crap on both sides.  Biden drafted policy that contributed to many mass incarcerated blacks. Kamala was a prosecutor who mass incarcerated black Americans for weed.  Trump sucks I'm not voting for him. I'm just gonna vote Kanye to screw the Dems.
Biden has dementia and a racist, authoritarian record. Harris is a tough-on-crime (except against cops) former prosecutor brought on the ticket at a time of unprecedented upheaval against a systemically flawed criminal justice system. Don't expect a #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
What did Biden do to fix any of this when it was happening under his and Obama's watch?
Why didn't Biden fight to get them closed when he was vice president to Obama?  He's the current Dem nominee

Racist comments aren't exclusive to Trump. According to Biden, black voters who don't support him "ain't black"  Biden still defends his mass incarceration policy.  What's worse. Trump's racist comments or Bidens mass incarcerations?
In case you're thinking of not voting for Biden. #SettleForBiden
This is so true
Just how many federal crimes can he be charged with by the Biden Administration?
It's funny how you are playing whataboutisms to try and deflect   Biden caused thousands upon thousands of black americans to be mass incarcerated and Harris incarcerated black Americans for weed.  Any whataboutisms you try to make are lesser, so give it up
And a vote for Biden is a vote for mass incarcerations of black Americans. Sorry can't do that one buddy
My favorite part of this will be watching Trump grift and pander to the left of Biden. Similar to 2016. And watching neoliberal Dems get overconfident and still not having fucking clue how to respond. Build. Back. Better. 🤦
You realize Kanye isn't gonna win and is only here to take votes from Biden?

the only earnest reason for Biden is that you won’t have to hear about him more than once a week. i’ve found any other argument falls on deaf ears for people who are justifiably politically disengaged

Trump is destroying the United States Postal Service as we speak, trying to literally steal an election, but continue your biden outrage.
I like Biden, but I don't like him that much to do something like this. And to be honest, this is actually concerning.
Those that fight for the cause should show your support and give their house.  Practice what you preach.  It’s easy to tell everyone else.... but anyone voting for Biden... come on... give your house

Politics just got so much more sneaky in America... using Biden as a shield for the real presidential candidate is genius. On the right, strong candidate with weak vp on the left weak candidate with a strong strong vp
Finally asked how she could call Biden a racist on stage and now be on the same ticket, Kamala replies:  “It was a debate. A debate.”  “So you didn’t mean it?”  “Debate. Debate!” Amid strange laughs.  Exhibit 8B of why she was not a good choice for Biden.
But Biden/Harris calling for a national mask mandate is totally the authoritarian ticket in this election
Ok we get it Kamala Harris is a Narc. Her and Biden are a reunion tour of the crime bill. It sucks.....but let’s be real y’all stop playing and tell people to vote for them before we get stuck with homeboy again 🙄
My father was a Navy Vet of the Korean War. He and his group of Vets of the Local VFW all Trump voters. They were all Wartime Vets. Proud of their service, proud of their President who appreciates them and fights for their rights that the dirtbag Biden doesn’t care  1 bit about
i dont understand how people will "Hold his feet to the fire"  this entire election cycle has proven they can just do whatever, whenever and people will fall in line. a fucking cop as VP in 2020 and people are lapping it up. biden don't care what anybody thinks
What if after they were elected, Biden was unable, and then we find that Kamala is not legit... guess who gets to take over? Nazi Pelozi! It's an excellent eEeeEeEvil plan!
Cant help but think #Biden is the corp overlords, forcing ppl to work slave wages while #Kamala is the thin blue line, killing us telling us “im not gonna do something that only benefits black ppl” while #Trump is the feds, breaking laws/shredding civil rights  #FuckTheDuopoly
well, those challenges will take quite some time. good thing Biden and Harris will be the running the show in the meantime.

The most frustrating part is that they agree that Biden is trash and still think that he deserves their vote. My hardest lefty friend even agrees with me that Obama sucked. Yet somehow still thinks Trump is worse.
And you want big brother Biden (I couldn't pass on the alliteration) telling you how to think. You know, honored sir, we have more in common than what you may feel comfie with.
No, but I do think they seek power, and will do so within the Democratic Party if they can. And the Biden wing of the party may be too quick to welcome them.
Now we know why USPS is making headlines fueled by DNC. There is a vested interested in helping Biden win.
That Wallace/Trump interview was disastrous for Trump. Almost as bad as the one after that. Biden can just sit back and watch this clown self destruct.
Biden can’t be worse - Trump’s already proven he’s in way over his head and with disastrous results.
Fuck You  I Will Stand In Line ALL FUCKING DAY With My Covid Gear On To Vote Your Corrupt Ass Out Of Office! Robbing The USPS Isn't Stopping Me From Casting My Vote!! #BIDENHARRIS2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide #Biden
YUP, Biden landslide
Warren &gt; Biden   Lol y’all fucked up
So since you don't think Biden can handle the situation, you can admit that you're not actually thinking of voting for him, right? You're saying that he's weak on crime and you wouldn't want a radical Democrat in the White House, right??
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are far from perfect but it is a vote to get trump out, secure RBG’s Supreme Court seat, and restore all minorities &amp; LGBT+ rights that have been demolished by trump supporters. It’s not about those 2, it’s about all of us saving our lives from trump
Chances that The Robert's Court will care about lawsuits brought that claim rulemaking is void since the acting heads are in violation: Zero, as long as Trump or other Republican is Potus. Chances that the Robert's Court would have different findings under Biden, Harris? Not zero
And Biden's AG will head that investigation!
Or maybe the USPS endorsing Biden. The people charged with delivering all those mail in ballots. Hmmm,  what could go wrong there? DA
Do you losers get in a room to agree upon Obama/Biden/Comey cabal?
Does anyone else notice they aren't even trying to hide their lies and thievery?  Are we going to be able to try them when Biden is in? The insider trading from meetings prior to the #TrumpVirus, etc.
There's an organized group on here: Mangy Jay, Jeff Fecke, that Wilson Valdez account, etc. They have a DM or something and organize little micro-swarms in defense of Pelosi, Biden, etc. In their spare time they complain about Bernie and the Intercept a lot. It's a shtick
The argument is not Biden himself is going to save lives. The argument is that Trump’s and the goals of his party, are authored with the  explicit intent of harming a lot of vulnerable people. Of course work on the ground is most important. Trump is a deep impediment to that tho.
Biden has known her for years and he isn't a vindictive a-hole. He chose wisely.
Vote Biden.  We need to climb out of this pit.
There are a ton of them trolling Biden, acting as if they are concerned liberals.
California is in play? Biden is polling 30 points ahead there. He's polling 25 points ahead in New York.
People I won’t be voting for in November... #Trump #Biden
Well biden has a pulse . Not much of one but it ticks a little
Will you effectively be President Mr./ Mrs. Biden’s twitter writer? You seem smart enough I suppose.
Yep, they did it deceptively to make it sound worse than it was because trust me, they won't report the Q3 numbers the same way; although they will report the Q4 numbers to make them look ridiculously good if Biden wins.
My thinking is informed by Joe Biden's record. His past performance.   I expect him to repeat the same policy preferences that minimizes us, and maximizes his big donor friends.
Or to put it another way, the case that the race could dramatically change due to a Biden scandal or some sort of decline in COVID was far stronger in May than it is two weeks before Labor Day (after which lots of voters will start paying much more attention)
Good summary of the reasons why Biden is likely to win (yes there is still time for things to change but time keeps ticking away)
Anyone who supports Biden is betraying the working poor. Because that is what biden did as senator and as VP.   Biden is a war-making, deregulator funded by the financial industry, who expanded unconstitutional executive power, wars, mass incarceration, fossil fuels and misery!
Biden’s response when his hidden ear piece malfunctions at the debates.
Again,  hilarious someone backing Trump tosses out sexual assault allegations as criticism of Biden.  Everyone’s seen the law suits  has been involved in and had to pay millions to make go away.  How can you point at Biden, yet support a man that’s much worse?
I'm am saying the donors of the common people is who I want my candidate influences by.   I'm saying who funds the campaign matters!  That exactly what im saying.   Joe biden is funded by vile corrupt people and he cares about them!
Again Biden was propped up by big donors, dark money, pacs, and super packs funded by the big donors.   He did not depend on small donors.  You are in serious denial.   Sanders depended on a million small dollar donors. Biden depended on the plutocracy.   It's not the same thing.
I just hope that if Biden wins, we can put him in an orange jumpsuit!
You are comparing the kind of influence our revolution has on Bernie Sanders to Biden's financial supporters and groups?   It's willful ignorance to suggest Biden's dark money donors are the same kind of people who donate to our revolution!
Just as it takes one hip hop star - suffering from mental illness - to sabotage the Black vote for Biden. Smh 🤦🏾‍♀️ 🤯
U seen Biden old ass 👀
Tr*mp supporters don’t know we are losing with biden because Bernie is the only change maker.  We are being considerate when they call us names and we do not call them names back. There is a reason to be angry with them though because he is so rude!
Okay it’s time we talk about how the FUCK did BIDEN and CLINTON get those nominations over BERNIE? Not even just looking at their political stances, but at their ACTUAL supporters. There has GOT TO BE people working actively against him being in office. Send tweet.
Biden supporters launched Dark money groups, I do over simplify Super Pacs into the dark money phrase.   It's willful ignorance on your part to not understand that how Joe funds his campaign, effects how he will govern.   Biden is a puppet to the big donors.  He served them!
My thoughts exactly, and this should be implemented day one of the Biden/Harris term
I can't wait to hear Biden pronounce Mykola Zlochevsky.
I’m white. I went to trade school. I’m voting for Biden. Also who are these people being polled? No one has ever asked me🤔
Joe Biden-"I just voted to make gay marriage illegal"!
Go vote for the other Biden then, Jack!
The question is: will media allow Biden and Harris to continue not answering questions? You would think that some ethics might still be relevant for journalists - this far those seem to be lacking. A major party candidate has been in a hidey hole for 3 months and media takes it.
Moreover they are extreme-right. E.g. Biden's closer to, say, Milton Friedman's views than the actual center.
Super Pacs funded by the financial industry. Are what I call dark money.  Sanders was largely funded by a million small donors. He did not depend on Super Pacs, or meet with big donors to reassure them "Nothing would fundamentally change".  I agree Biden didn't rely on grassroots
Alicia Mendoza, do you understand the difference between voting at the Democratic National Convention next week vs a vote in November General Election? Bernie wants his delegates next week to vote for for Bernie. Then he wants his supporters to vote for Biden in November!
What the fuck even was that conversation. She also had a totally incorrect timeline for when people were dropping out and endorsing Biden, and had totally the wrong idea about how people were doing in actual delegates and votes before that happened.
I agree Biden is not the choice if you want personal freedoms, but literally any mainstream candidate isn’t either. To enforce these laws they support massive police forces and funding and nobody wants it to stop since it’s lining there pockets 🤷🏼‍♂️
Me too.  I think Biden has been anal probed by many aliens
I am voting for Biden and Harris. I'm doing this without reservation. I will mark their names on the ballot gleefully and of my own sound mind. I totally and fully support them.  But goddammit, we missed an opportunity with Warren.
my problem with Biden is that he's too similar to Trump
The country in its current state existed before Trump and will continue exist with Biden.
Another disadvantage of tweeting under your real name: it’ll be easier for the #tRUmpstapo to find you.
She was an Attorney General that prosecuted violent criminals. How many violent criminals that Mike Pence put behind bars? Trump and his allies should just drop the anti-cop trope against Biden because it sounds freaking stupid at this point.  The anti-cop folks hate Harris BtW..
Again, without DARK money and a corrupt media propping up Joe Biden, he would not be the presumptive nominee.  Also, Biden was funded by the plutocracy, Sanders was funded by the people. I guess you can't tell the difference?
To clarify, I don't think Biden will "save" anything or anyone  But if he somehow doesn't ratfuck labor and delivers on his positions, he'll be giving us the tools to move past him
It sucks, and I'm never gonna do the whole Blue Vote Browbeat. But Biden at least has a few appeals to pro-labor policies as opposed to Trump trying to trample them, and I trust the ability of a union to throttle the economy more than any elected right now, so
I thought for sure you were JFK Jr.!
I had been expecting a major drop in the stock market as a result of congresse's stimulus failure. So far that hasn't happened. It could be that the markets are already anticipating Trump leaving office &amp; speculating on a more stabil &amp; predictable economy under Biden.
Biden/Harris - Pro Unbridled On Demand Abortion Paid for by us - taxpayers 😡

Kamala and biden have told more lies in three days than Trump has told in his almost 3 years. Keep talking Bette. Conservatives love you! 🤭🤣

Friends, if Joe Biden was not propped up by dark money and a corrupt, corporate media, Bernie Sanders would likely win!
“In the context of Biden’s words, this is evident. Clearly some, including those without that context, have wrongly attributed Biden’s words to Johannes, and in doing so have attributed abhorrent and inaccurate motives to him.” 👍👍
Hey, I just filled out my request for an absentee ballot so I can legitimately mail my vote in. You are a con artist Mr. Biden.
Even Joe Biden has stated this won't be an easy transition. tRump's going to do all he can to lie &amp; cheat his way into staying #FakePresident. The only thing I see that will stop him is the continuation of his Impeachment, w honest members &amp; changing of laws. 😾😾😷
Thats great. The dems now Fascists won't be able to cheat. POTUS cares about this country and its not looking so good with an unlikeable wench and a biden that does not remember who his is running agaisnt. Tell the truth

I don’t even want to visit with my relatives who are conservative.. republican.. you know 😒 just saw a fb post “if you think Biden will change anything, you’re an idiot” from my fam so..just tired of it. Unfollowed.
Biden’s not the one taking cognitive testing. Who brags about remembering 5 words in a row?  It’s absolutely laughable.  You can make stuff up all you want about Biden...we’ve got the Truth to look at about  He thinks remembering 5 words is an accomplishment. Lol
Agreed. I think we all need to be careful about despair turning into inaction. There are LOTS of ways u can help with elections efforts (volunteering, donations, just texting the Biden supporters in your life) and your words may encourage others to dismiss this as “wasted time.”
(Also, people who would need to be shamed into voting for Biden are probably not following any of us on Twitter)
So You’re voting for Trump then because..... ? Kanye is a fuckin joke so you either swallow your pride and vote Biden or vote Trump to support hatred and racism
This Sedaris quote has been around since 2008. Let’s consider updating: Biden is the shit-glass; Trump is a bullet in your brain.  Analogies. You can do whatever you want with ‘em!
That "plan" also requires 2 more democratic presidents in succession following Biden to accomplish. We saw the damage Trump has done to healthcare in one term, yet you still want to take that risk on behalf of poor / underinsured Americans?

After 32 yrs of campaigning, donating, volunteering for Dems, I'm done. They pander to Republicans. They have PAC money from BUSH OFFICIALS (war criminals). These Repubs pushing for Biden want something in return and I'm not willing to go any further right to vote for them.
But she should really be addressed as Senator Harris, with respect. Until she’s Madame President, that is (I don’t see Biden finishing the term).
Unsure, but boy do people get mad when the left brings up Biden's decades of right wing policies or Kamala leaning into Tough On Crime
Biden was VP for the first Black president in American history. Obviously super racist lol
It's 2020 and Biden has no problem condemning racism and white supremacy. President Pussy Grabber just says there are fine people on both sides.
President Biden &amp; Vice President Harris 🇺🇸💙
So if everything needs changing why hasnt career politician Joe Biden done anything??   Why is it Trumps fault career politicians haven’t been successful?  Maybe because they have other agendas?  Hmmmm.
You are actively doing the opposite of holding the moderates feet to the fire
Your president has officially declared war on the service which people I love rely on for political reasons. You have proven yourself loyal to Trump over American citizens who need support during a pandemic, and your kind have inspired me to devote myself to Biden’s campaign.
If you had told me in high school that I'd still be forced to listen to what Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and Marge Simpson think about things in my 40s, I would have paid more attention in science class and shot myself into the sun.
Biden is not in a position of authority to order anyone to do anything.  Just because he is running for president doesn’t give him any power to order everyone to wear masks until November 3rd.  I’m pretty sure its the exact date he’s going for.
Quite a headline, when it is 46 states

Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He’s the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes     Democrats didn’t pick Mr. Biden because he’s moderate, they picked him because he’s weak

I'm not convinced it matters if you admit you'll vote for Biden or not. They don't care about our votes. They don't want people like us to be anywhere near their party. Someone like Biden in particular will never genuinely move left on anything of significance.
My life does depend on it which is why I'm voting for Biden and Harris, you washed up second rate has been.
It’s definitely important to identify and critique Biden/Harris *once we get them in office*. Right now those critiques are only serving to discount the campaign and give Trump leverage. Yes it’s a broken stupid system. We can’t fix it til we ax Don

The bots that run the Biden/Harris campaign are not very intelligent. They continue to spam us without keeping track of whether or not we have endorsed or given (I've done both). I know, spamming is part of the game; but when it happens via text message it gets annoying.

Exactly. If Kanye drops out I'm voting for Trump.  I hope he costs Biden the election. The Dems shouldnt have screwed Yang.
True bit given all this either the polls are even that much further offor people are dumb. Biden shoyld be down 10 points
The audacity of Biden voters telling non-supporters to check their privilege lmaoo
Yup, and if Biden had won the nom and lost we would be reading takes about: How could the Democratic establishment have been so STUPID as to nominate a boring old white man with a lot of baggage rather than the most qualified candidate woman candidate ever! etc etc etc
Funny how they have nothing to say about Trump's father buying his way into University and the fact he had to PAY SOMEONE ELSE to even get his scores up high enough.  But yeah, Biden in 3rd grade.
Where were u when Biden was Being Falsely Accused?
There's absolutely no room for doubt. Every problem we have with Biden and his administration can be handled because they respect the process, the same can't be said for Trump.
Nah, he'll just use the Obama strategy and only hold pressers every 3 months.  But he handles the hostile media pretty well, and when he has a stroke it will be long after his second term.  Biden may have already had one.
I cannot think of a more perfect encapsulation of King Trump's presidency:
Maybe Trump should adopt the Biden model:  only call on friendly press with pre-approved questions.  No, Trump is smart enough and courageous enough to take this shit from a hostile media on a daily basis.
Joe Biden should’ve made Dr. Umar VP

He sent Giuliani to Ukraine during his trail to get the fake dirt on Biden that they are currently using in bs senate and congressional investigations into Hunter and Joe Biden but sure he was totally demurred by impeachment. These folks rewriting history...
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia  via
"If an alleged rac(p)ist is going to be in charge, at least vote for the experienced one!" Pretty much my whole TL trying to convince people to vote for Biden
Biden drafted mass incarceration legislature and Harris locked up black men for weed while joking about doing it herself.  Furthermore Demokkkrats have done nothing but pander to black voters and make empty promises for over 30 years, sorry if I don't believe them.
Okay look, I know better than to expect any kind of sense from Shiny Paste and Polyester, but tweeting out this lovely photo is as dumb as when whatsisname tweeted that adorable pic of Biden with his little boy and was like “BURN amirite”
Not to equate them more deeply, but in terms of public posture and confidence, this is so like our president and Joe Biden.
Vote for Biden. First we deal with the threat to our very democracy, then we deal with the other party.
I disagreed with Obama’s decision not to investigate/prosecute the decisions to torture, the bank meltdown, etc. It enabled the GOP &amp; the prez to demolish norms and institutions. Biden would shy away from it, but there needs to be some kind of Truth &amp; Reconciliation comission.
This week from Washington, Omar and Fischbach win their primary races, USPS gets a threat and Kamala Harris is the VP pick for Joe Biden. Let’s get on with this:  by
We are better than this moment.  New video by the Lincoln project.  We cannot take four more years.  Vote for Biden.
The science also doesn’t call for a national mask mandate that includes every citizen to wear masks inside and outside...will you point that out to Mr. Biden. Also, you’re on record that Hydroxychloroquine helped your spouse - is that science then? Thank you.
I was up in the Alexandria area last weekend-only saw Trump 2020 signs-nothing for Biden
Kamala Harris Climate Record: Where Joe Biden's Running Mate Stands - Bloomberg
Remember how left-leaning news ran with a narrative that Biden was the "most-electable" candidate?  Like that.
I hope she still will! She is a treasure that can rock a top position in the Biden administration, we need her!
Haha civilized human being , Biden doesn’t even know where he is most days or what is actually coming out of his mouth.
Because Biden is not in control of anything he says. This is the far left telling him what to say.  Unbelievable
I was voting for Biden no matter what, from the grave, if necessary
Politicians campaign where they have a chance of winning.  To do otherwise would be a waste of time and resources.  Do you think Biden will campaign in Alabama or Mississippi?  It's not a matter of caring.  It's a matter of getting to 270 electoral votes.
The process of how Biden arrived at selecting Kamala Harris. via
This is skewed by what the poll considers "white Christians". They should have a category for so called "evangelicals" because I was Methodist now Lutheran and ALL white Christians I know support Biden.
Ha! ^ Good take Danny. You seem ALL IN on Kamala or “don’t matter, anyone but Trump”? It troubling how she called Biden a segregationist, suggested he drop out, believed accusers, but now all good 🤷‍♂️ - phony? We think a mistake it’s not Amy. Is this our winning ticket? Ughh 🥴😩
I really hope Biden wins just so we can bring back “hi I’m in Delaware”
Just saw a biden ad where he talked for 20 seconds about a desk and then concluded with "it's not about the desk, it's the person behind it" and like damn, huge if true
He's worse Nixon tried to pass UBI before the Democrats stopped him, he also believed in socialized medicine. So Biden is actually to the right of Nixon, as is most of the Democratic party.
#VA05 Dem internal has Good up 44%-42% and Trump up 47%-45%.  Pretty solid number for Biden in a district Clinton lost by 11.
Followed all I wasn't already. Nice to meet you all. I do block people who are saying they won't vote Biden/Harris for any reason. ABirkshire, for example. Was warned last night, checked, pinned tweet saying so. This is too important to not support this ticket. We must unite.
. is a top notch diplomat. Love to see her return to a foreign policy/national security role in the #Biden administration. Imagine a thoughtful, competent administration filled with folks who truly want to move our country forward. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Not to mention, no talk of how many delegates Biden received in 2008.
Mainly my point is biden was instrumental in building the circumstances we find ourselves in, and effectively gave us trump. Handing him the reigns is like asking OG dark lord to have another shot
Why are we talking about bernie  Biden seems okay to people that think obama did things that made stuff seem ok when obama was an imperialist war monger riding the final years of "functional" neoliberalism. Biden is an authoritarian that will enter office during cap in crisis
Jude Winneski &amp; the 2 Santa Claus theory.  Google it. This is the  playbook for the last 40 years. They will continue to use this in the future-unless WE stop em. #Biden #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I know the parties are ruled by donors and $$$, but imagine a parallel universe where Biden and Harris made an announcement that the pandemic has caused them to reassess his position on M4A. Make her the point person, she sells it well.  Devastating weapon against Trump and GOP.
Long story short? The states likely to see a breakdown over mail voting are isolated. And the states Biden likely will win with have well-run vote counting. (ie Biden is at 289 electoral votes with states that are Low/Moderate "post office risk.")
I suspect Biden will have a lot of progressives on board. But he needs to win first.

Biden equals 77.5 percent increase in taxes. Batten down hathes .
Im not sure of what means of production he privately controls to earn profit, but bernie did reveal himself to be a liberal by endorsing joe biden, architect of the american police state and arch-defender of capital
I saw more Biden signs than Trump signs on a recent drive through rural Central Wisconsin.
So Biden/Harris is a 2:1 margin?
Indeed. Trump and his allies, such as the DC examiner are trying to simultaneously paint a picture that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are far left and then post articles about how the far left don’t like them.
More like letting morgoth have the one ring   Biden engineered the world that gave us trump
A “peace deal” between two secret allies who do not have adjoining borders, are not at war, and haven’t threatened war with each other?  Meh.  By the way,  is a con and a grifter.
Democratic Party sets rules for criticizing Joe Biden's VP pick Kamala Harris - Washington Times
and look, I have no love for Biden. But centrism is NOT the same as someone who wants to consolidate far right power and make sure no left policies can pass under a far right supreme court. I’m tired of intellectually lazy false equivalencies.
If Joe Biden and Kamala are “far-left”, why does the far-left hate them so much. 🤔
Biden says nuns inspire him to run, plans to sue Little Sisters of the Poor  via
Just an observation - a lot of folks in this "Biden crime bill &amp; the crack era" debates were KIDS -not adults, not teens, but KIDS -back then when all this happened.  And I think that knowledge - what they saw as kids - is shaping their argument.
Under any admin that wants to perpetuate a capitalist-in-crisis mode, fascism will rise  "Biden is the slow fascist" is a pointless sell and you should be using your energy in non electoral ways to prepare for what is now inevitable

happy friday joe biden sucks
Fascism is capitalisms immune response to its own contradictions. It will happen unless these contradictions are addressed. A biden ticket will just maintain the status quo, and thus fascism will continue to rise.
DYK: Biden was against the Iraq war? lmfao
How can any Roman Catholic support Biden/Harris? Outrageous support for pro-abortion candidates!!
How long until President Projection claims Biden would put the USPS out of business?
If you think the rapist label applies to Biden and not only Trump I would encourage you to research it more, that accusation was full of contradictions and suspect ties to Russia
First, it's Aryan Nation.  Second, it's the democrats who founded the KKK and fought for segregation (Biden supported Ayran  views).  Third, the left has been screaming RACIST! at conservatives for decades as a political tactic.  Read Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals.
You think Trump has a 1 in 5 chance of winning the popular vote? That seems VERY generous if you look at the 2016 election, Trumps approval numbers throughout his presidency, the popularity of Biden vs Hillary and the enduring failure of Trump’s COVID response.
Donald Trump can’t run on his record, so the focus is on attacking Biden.
🤣🤣🤣 YOU'RE EATING BULLSHIT  TRUMP: 7.8 million jobs lost including 7,100 coal mining jobs &amp; 274,000 manufacturing jobs. Unemployment highest level since World War II  OBAMA/BIDEN Gained a net 11.6 million jobs, unemployment rate dropped, salaries up for all workers 4.2%

They're laughing at us now; they'll stop laughing when Joe Biden takes office!
I think it is hilarious that the first question about Biden's proposed mask mandate is "under what authority could a President order that?"
Biden ('s handlers) are liars to the bone!!  Kamala fits right into that crowd!
Ralph Nader is responsible for the Iraq War, but Joe Biden, who voted for it, is not
Keep watching. The more you lie and support liars the more they will slip in the polls. Biden and Kamala havent told the truth once yet and neither have you.
No! JOE BIDEN did advocate for a national mask mandate BUT of course, he is playing on the fears of his voting minions, who seem to be afraid of their shadows!!
So… If Biden/Harris were president, they wouldn’t have shut down the economy?  I’m sure Harris knows that’s not true.  I’m pretty sure Harris’s target demographic doesn’t.
Friday 5 Anti-Patriots 1. Darius Sessoms-black-shot Cannon Hinnant, white 5-YO boy. 2. Biden-masks outside for 3 mths? 3. BLM demands whites give homes to blacks. 4. BLM in Chicago claims looting is reparations. 5. Kamala Harris jokes about MURDERING Trump/Pence on the Ellen Show

I suspect voter fraud will allow the Dems to claim victory. Or are they seriously thinking the anti-American platform is what all of America wants? It’s Friday. Is Biden still among the living?
No. It might just keep him in some sort of check until Biden's inauguration.
Biden-Harris looks like a ticket content to sit on its lead, the way Governor Dewey did in 1948. Though rivals in the primaries, the running-mates have similar anti-crime records, even though their base demands an end to policing.  Patrick Buchanan writes:
Immediate block of anyone who suggests AOC, Buttigieg or Yang as members of a Biden cabinet.  I can't deal with anyone who's that stupid.  Also, I unfollow/mute/block anyone who defends any JD, especially a member of the 'squad'.  No JD is an ally, even if you may think otherwise

Yeah, I’m sorry. It’s a fucking no brainer. Biden and the Democratic party are shit, but the false equivalency people have made is fucking baby brained.
Everyone is afraid of the traitor and his moods!   Someone with balls needs to take the lead.  ?Biden/Harris?
No I'm voting Kanye even though I know it helps Trump. Biden is responsible for many mass incarcerated black men with the 94 crime bill. Kamala is too from her days as a prosecutor.  Say what you want about Trump but I'll take him over Biden any day.
Flashback: #KamalaHarris said she believed women who accused #JoeBiden of inappropriate touching.  #SleepyJoeAndTheHoe2020
For sure, Biden did tweet about how we need to fund pandemic prevention back in October 2019 and I think I can safely say we would have less deaths if he were at the helm. No way his admin would be shitting on Fauci.
I can’t even imagine how out of touch you have to be to think that people who are unhappy with Biden and the Dem establishment are Russian bots or sympathizers
Biden is just politicizing this, he isn't actually thinking this is the right way to handle it.  No, we shouldn't mandate from the federal government.

When Biden is our President, things will get better!
But when someone says I’ll take him out behind the shed and beat the crap out of him it’s totally cool? Just gauging your outrage here.
Biden. That seems obvious.
I wait and wait for Biden, Harris or any other prominent Democrat to stand up and condemn the violence we are seeing in major cities.  Instead, they are excusing or denying that it exists.  How can they save the country if they won’t look at reality?
Actually, I haven’t seen pictures of him touching young girls inappropriately.  It is rather interesting that instead of defending Biden, you jump to accusing Trump.  If you “know” Trump is a molester, how do you feel about Biden’s public groping of young girls and women?
Jim you know that’s a complete lie.  Joe Biden is not qualified to be the president either and you know that as well!!!!
Are you writing this same shit about Biden or Trump or Pence? Or is it just the woman’s choice in clothing that will be scrutinized?
I’m going to share this again. This is just one person, but there are many more like him. We are screwed if people like him vote so carelessly. He won’t vote Biden because he doesn’t like Harris. He feels no pain, because he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. Selfish...
We are here because of too many Americans are still complacent. I have many friends who don’t pay any attention at all. In fact I had one tell me the other day he wouldn’t vote for Biden since he picked Kamala. He will write in Bloomberg! WTF

Here’s the Democratic convention info- it starts Dec. 17th. My main feeling about it right now is disgust. The DNC shut down the process back in Spring when they picked Biden. Half the states never got to vote with the full slate of candidates.
actually it has a higher approval rating than Trump and Biden

That is what Trump called Hillary in the 2016 campaign.  So it was a way for people who supported Hillary to turn his words around with sarcasm to show their support for her.  He called Harris a nasty woman within hours of Biden announcing her as his choice for running mate too.
Joe Biden called for a nationwide mask mandate, citing experts’ predictions that it could save 40,000 lives from COVID-19 in the coming months.  #Sunrisers, would you support a nationwide mask mandate?

Biden will be a fast death of America
I think 2 things can be true at once  Conservatives are wrong for assuming Kamala is in the position she is in because of her gender/skin color. She worked her way there.  Biden specifically said he was going to pick a woman of color.  Both are disgusting and racist
“The rapid expansion of executive and unchecked power has brought us to the brink of authoritarianism. And this would not be possible without the complicity of Republicans in Congress.” #VoteBidenHarris2020  What Republicans still don't understand...
Yeah I saw something along those lines too yesterday. Apparently it’s all an intricate plot to have Biden declared incapable, the Kamala would be ineligible to take over, leaving Nancy Pelosi as President.

So the woman who called Biden a racist is now his vp candidate. Makes sense
Got it. Joe Biden is sent by God. Interesting narrative to push, Bill.
I love the Harris pick. It reminds me of how I felt when Christian Ponder successfully threw one away. Seemed like Biden had the chance to mess this up and didn't!
The Biden campaign has already committed to 3 debates. Where have you been?
Here's what Sen. Amy Klobuchar had to say about Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate.
Does Kamala Harris still believe Joe Biden is a racist?
I wanted Bernie/Warren but Biden/Harris is pretty awesome too! 🥳 #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has announced California Sen. Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate for the 2020 election.
Democrats, especially the administration that Biden was a part of, gave Trump most of that economy.  Without Obama’s turnaround from the recession for him to build off of, Trump’s economy wouldn’t have been anything special.
I remember when kamala Harris called Biden a racist during the debates. Seems she has changed her tune. Both sides do this
Nobody is saying Biden is a genius. Don’t resort to straw man arguments.   You can (and smart people do) think that Biden is a terrible candidate while still understanding that he’s 100x better than 4 more years of Trump would be.
who is doing your ads ? No offense but they suck. Why not contrast your executive order with Obama/biden or show Nancy's support of the payroll tax break.
I've had this idea in my head for my talk radio station of doing a Joe Biden sound board, where at the click of a button, the producer should air a Joe Biden gaffe on command. But there's so many and I'm so far behind 😂
Biden could do a good thing for himself and nominate Condoleeza Rice as his running mate.
And they're questioning Biden's competence?
Lol thats funny u say trump is racist but yet your voting for Joe biden who said "if you vote for trump then your not black" makes total sense.

BIDEN does not get on TV and say ignorant stupid things. You do this everyday
Indeed, Sad part about people saying vote for Biden is that they’re forced to say it because he’s the only other candidate to vote for lol we’re fucked either way. 😞
Politics are poisonous.   They will have you arguing with your friends and family over 2 candidates that don’t give 2 fucks about us. Ain’t that crazy? Poc are arguing over Trump and Biden... 🤦🏽‍♂️ so this where we at huh
Predictable. A certainty actually. The nastiest man on the planet, or at least in this country, attacks a woman in this way. It lays bare his character. It will have, I think, a boomerang effect. Because try as he will, he can't sully her character at all.
Thinking he hasn't got much support from any color. He may not win his household even. And I don't care, I don't think his name is even going to be on the ballot in most states. So, I'm not reading anything more about him. He's not the news for me. Biden/Harris is.
I am done responding. I'm sick of you trying to say "you think/do this horrible thing" when I clearly don't. I never said the fight ends when Biden is elected
no one in this convo is saying you should be grateful for the LGBTQ+ situation in the US right now. It's still bad. We're saying that it's better than it was 40 years ago and could get WORSE under Trump, while it won't under Biden
I simply think getting Trump out should be top priority. Then young people can start to put pressure on Biden and the Dem establishment
idk where in this argument you got the idea that this is "fun" for me? I'm sorry about the situation you're in. I understand that I have very little skin in the game (i'm a white guy). I just see what Trump is doing and know that four years of Biden would be not as bad
And if Hillary had won in 2016 Biden probably wouldn't have felt the need to run this year. Good job!
i'd call "we need to elect Biden because Trump is worse" pragmatism
and mfers like you are the reason Trump won in 2016, no offense. Look at how all of you people abstaining did in the next election cycle. No more progressive but at least we have Biden!
In no way do I enjoy the fact that Biden is the nominee. I simply understand that 4 more years of Trump would be much worse than that of Biden
"Hey guys maybe we should finally let black people vote" is to the left of "Hey we need to break down systemic racism" I guess? And that's not Biden i'm quoting but the main line of the Democratic party, whether or not it's older members actually mean what they say
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Join Seniors for Biden” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
my point is that you're ignoring the actual difference in their political stances. Biden may very well be a rapist. It sucks that the Democrats forced him on us. But to say Biden as a presidential candidate and Trump as a presidential candidate are the same thing IS ridiculous
You're reaching Trump supporter levels of simplification here. I very much dislike Biden. I wish Bernie (or even Warren) was the nominee but to ignore all the differences between Biden and Trump's platform and just say they're both equal "racist rapists" is ridiculous
Kamala is the law and order candidate for the party of #dismantlethepolice. Clarity. Vision. Sound judgement. Textbook #biden

I think I had forgotten what hope had felt like until it was restored today. Biden/Harris... let’s go!
Both Biden &amp; Harris are moderates and you don't have anything that even comes close to labelling them as radical left.  They are so moderate that many conservatives that are sick of trump will feel at ease that a vote for Joe is a vote for moving America forward out of the gutter
To be clear, Biden is far better than Trump (or Sanders) on trade

Yea agreed. Was jus checking .  Idk how you could put biden under trump. And Biden is a dipshit, but standing next to trump he look like a genius
is voting for joe Biden strictly for kampala Harris
Bob Avakian the leader of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA (RCP) has praised mass murderers Mao Zedong and Joesph Stalin. Now he’s praising Joe Biden. Shocking Biden endorsement announced  via
Just like we were last election right?  😂😂😂😂😂 Biden already had no chance and this made his chances even worse 😂😂😂 Dems don’t even want to vote for him 😂😂😂
There's lots of things I want too,  but at this point it isn't about what you want anymore. You have two options Trump or Biden, if you don't support biden then you're supporting trump and if you don't get that then you deserved to be scolded by people
Biden studders, he has had a studdering issue since he was a kid. I bet he knows when World War 2 ended though, unlike Trump who said yesterday that the Spanish Flu of 1918 ended the Second World War
So if Biden wins, you will be to vote for: Women for CIA Director  Women for Education Secretary  Black man for HUD  Gay person for ambassador to Germany   You and Tina Smith voted against in past.  Wow, who are you for?  Oh ya open borders.
I haven't been on a date for 16 yrs, our reps grab, poke, squeeze anyone they can get their hands on, omar's at the top of that list.  Could Kamala Harris's Racy Sex Scandal Sink Her AND Biden's 2020 Campaign [VIDEO] -  via
I'm so happy VP Biden chose you. You are going to be a great team! Now the party is cooking!!!
Biden will do just fine debating Trump. All Trump will day is Sleepy Joe and China over and over again
Bigger Harris/Biden numbers coming in November!
Nothing to do with Joe Biden is good news.
The only presidential candidate we were ever globally comfortably voting for was Obama. Them days are over with. Don’t just expect poc to pick between biden &amp; trump, it’s all fucked up.
Didn’t she call Biden a racist to his face on national tv?? 😂😂😂
I really don’t like Biden or Kamala Harris but I hate trump lol
And we will move heaven and earth to get them elected!
Very excited that Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate.  Shes smart and tough.
And that was the final Nail in Biden’s chances 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope it’s  but if it’s not I will still crawl through glass to vote for the Biden ticket!
Why did Whitmer interview with Biden
Could we try not to put the cart before the horse? Trump made a similar statement prior to the election in 2016. This is a given, I'm not sure stating the obvious out loud is going to persuade people to vote Biden, in fact, it may cause some to not.
That sounds like a Trump campaign ad. "This is the America Joe Biden wants!"
Kamala But I'm down with Bass as well. It's his choice and I'm going with Biden's choice.
Thank you sir. President Biden.
Lieing POS!!!BIDEN SUCKS!!!
Don’t care about the VP. voting Biden no matter what❤️
Joe Biden owns Fox News reporter during morning bike ride
RINOs queueing up to vote for Biden
What the hell has Trump done to help America? Millions are out of work, the economy is in the toilet. His response to the virus is beyond laughable! He's a colossal failure! Biden and Obama saved this country after another Republican crashed the economy!
It’s political. The more things they can shut down the better for Biden. Next will be Halloween!
I wouldn't consider any public plan that has so much cost sharing built in it's unaffordable 'lucky'. That's Biden's tokenism, nothing more. #NeverBiden #M4A 🌻
Face it, people, the guy is crooked and knows how to get money out of people. You don’t really think all those campaign donations are going to bumper stickers and lawn signs do you?
I'm much more concerned about the money men, the people like Sheldon Adelson who are the source of all that dark money pouring into Kentucky to keep Mitch and others like him than the noisy, but dumb Fox - saw a clip yesterday where they thought Biden really said he'd chosen a VP
Biden couldn’t even come up with the words to say that. Oh, well he could with 2 hrs of prompting. He’s just a puppet on a string.
Lol x 1000.  I have someone at work that has numerous anti Dem stickers. I will try to add a Biden sticker
Trump should implement the draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters leave the country for Canada
Only if Biden wins and the Trump crime family doesn't cheat on the election! If the orange slime ball wins, we are screwed.
I will vote for Biden but if you refuse to vote, Trump will become another 4yrs president.  Please share
I will vote for Biden but if you refuse to vote, Trump will become another 4yrs president.  Please share
Thats just either defunding Social Security or giving you a big bill that you'll have to pay once Trump loses and the Republicans will blame Biden because nothing matters anymore.
Trump should implement a draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters leave for Canada.  Gone in 60 seconds
Trump should implement a draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters leave for Canada.I never took the 'public option' seriously. It has always felt like it's little more than disingenuous &amp; diversionary rhetoric. That sentiment is receiving more &amp; more validation.     🌻 #VoteGreen #M4A #MedicareForAll
Warren used the goodwill built with Biden by not endorsing Bernie to get some of her biggest platform points adopted by Biden. She was arguably the runner up for VP and she’s widely touted as the Party’s policy mind. I will just never understand these paramecium-brained takes.
Please just do the same thing for Joe Biden, Mike Pence and Donald Trump.   So simple...yet...somehow this basic concept seems to escape the mass media these days.  Why is that?
you are f-n sorry as puppet for Biden - go suck your own ass
Vote Biden.  We need to climb out of this pit.
I just hope that if Biden wins, we can put him in an orange jumpsuit!
There's absolutely no room for doubt. Every problem we have with Biden and his administration can be handled because they respect the process, the same can't be said for Trump.
A real Patriot sees what Trump has done and is doing to destroy our democracy. So “not crazy about Biden” makes voting for Biden a no brainer.
In an ideal world, I agree, but I have doubts that a Biden administration would eliminate the department.
What is the issue?  Do you want to go another 4 years of this.  Biden is 1000 times better on any given day than the orange maggot!
Because Biden is not in control of anything he says. This is the far left telling him what to say.  Unbelievable
Followed all I wasn't already. Nice to meet you all. I do block people who are saying they won't vote Biden/Harris for any reason. ABirkshire, for example. Was warned last night, checked, pinned tweet saying so. This is too important to not support this ticket. We must unite.
I think it is hilarious that the first question about Biden's proposed mask mandate is "under what authority could a President order that?"
Joe Biden isn’t the main player because Joe doesn’t have the strength it takes to be this nation’s leader, stupid,  will be ultimately voting for is Kamela, an unknow candidate that the puppeteers will control, the woman who stupid want to shove in the good American’s troughs.
This Minnesotan agrees wholeheartedly with you. And we were looking forward to a visit. Hopefully next summer after Biden/Harris win!
How can all of you Kamala lovers just so easily look past how contradicting she is. That's not a party thing that's a her thing. She only got 2% of her parties vote and was destroying Biden who she now kisses his ass. #thirdparty
Poor Democratic leadership on display!  A vote for Biden is a vote to give up your freedoms! Vote Red! 💪🇺🇸
Nope!  No questions or solutions!  If you vote for Biden you are not an American!
Joe Biden says he'll make it a federal mandate
If I were Biden I'd say no debates until Trump releases his taxes. Biden doesn't need the debates to win.
You are so Full of $hit Even without the covid losses &amp; few gains You still haven't match Obama &amp; Biden They stepped into office after the last #GOP failure w/ 10's of thousands losing work &amp; homes You &amp; #trump blew a record continuous growth that was left for you God hates liers
Our only hope for progress at this point is electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. If you can't see that it's the only way forward, then you are lost. We can't have progress if there is no nation to move forward.
Unfortunately, it won’t work until there’s a national testing/tracing plan in place. Maybe if/when Biden wins, things will be good by March?
I say feel free to ban tiktok  It's so toxic With a trump supporters in the Biden supporters
I might take a break from all social media tiktok, Instagram and Twitter cuz all people talk about on tiktok  Biden and trump can app go back to sexy females twerking video game clips and funny videos please
I'm just making the observation that there's a whole lot of Democrats that want to reach out to the right before they reach out to the left. Thankfully Biden isn't one of them, based on his actions so far.
I don't blame Biden for this. But it's clear where the priorities for the DNC are when John fucking Kasich gets to speak and AOC gets one minute.
Why can't people let us move on at our own pace? Like I'm good, I'm voting for Biden, but I don't want to pretend like I'm happy.
Predictable. A certainty actually. The nastiest man on the planet, or at least in this country, attacks a woman in this way. It lays bare his character. It will have, I think, a boomerang effect. Because try as he will, he can't sully her character at all.
Thinking he hasn't got much support from any color. He may not win his household even. And I don't care, I don't think his name is even going to be on the ballot in most states. So, I'm not reading anything more about him. He's not the news for me. Biden/Harris is.
I think the thing that hurts the most for me is that as millions of Americans don't have reliable work, don't have enough income, are at risk of losing their housing, and have no savings, Biden went with the Wall Street VP pick.  I think more than anything that stings.
The problem in this case is that Kamala is suppposed to be the appeasement to the left wing because Biden is already far enough to the right.
Kamala is the law and order candidate for the party of #dismantlethepolice. Clarity. Vision. Sound judgement. Textbook #biden
I think I had forgotten what hope had felt like until it was restored today. Biden/Harris... let’s go!
Let’s just get Biden in office so we can primary every centrist up for re-election in 2022.
Both Biden &amp; Harris are moderates and you don't have anything that even comes close to labelling them as radical left.  They are so moderate that many conservatives that are sick of trump will feel at ease that a vote for Joe is a vote for moving America forward out of the gutter
Just like we were last election right?  😂😂😂😂😂 Biden already had no chance and this made his chances even worse 😂😂😂 Dems don’t even want to vote for him 😂😂😂
So if Biden wins, you will be to vote for: Women for CIA Director  Women for Education Secretary  Black man for HUD  Gay person for ambassador to Germany   You and Tina Smith voted against in past.  Wow, who are you for?  Oh ya open borders.
As someone who lives here and speaks with people from all walks of life and parts of the state:  Biden's winning Minnesota. It might not be close.
I think Joe Biden is a decent man. I don't think he was the best choice, but he is the choice and he will benefit from this.  But make no mistake, if he gets into office and starts forgiving people, I am the first person who will line up to offer opposition.
I want to be really transparent: Biden being the President is immaterial to me. It is the most likely outcome of the goal. I want to see the Republican Party incapacitated. I want them gone from the political lexicon of modern America.  That's my goal.
I'm so happy VP Biden chose you. You are going to be a great team! Now the party is cooking!!!
Trump saying that the Spanish flu probably ended WWII was either a cognitive slip (dementia) or willful ignorance. He said it within the last day or so. That you think Trump's statement has no equivalency with cracks about Biden having dementia is laughable.
Bigger Harris/Biden numbers coming in November!
Warren is too! Nearly outraised Obama for Biden!
And we will move heaven and earth to get them elected!
Very excited that Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate.  Shes smart and tough.
And that was the final Nail in Biden’s chances 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope it’s  but if it’s not I will still crawl through glass to vote for the Biden ticket!
Why did Whitmer interview with Biden
I don't know that Duckworth brings Biden anything he doesn't have. I should say that I'm not saying choosing someone other than my preference is a deal breaker by any stretch, but I don't see what she adds to his strengths or how she fortifies his weaknesses.
Could we try not to put the cart before the horse? Trump made a similar statement prior to the election in 2016. This is a given, I'm not sure stating the obvious out loud is going to persuade people to vote Biden, in fact, it may cause some to not.
Lmao I think  was right. If they cancel SEC football, write GA in for Biden.
Kamala But I'm down with Bass as well. It's his choice and I'm going with Biden's choice.
Thank you sir. President Biden.
Mooch, you need to see someone about your ”sour grapes” jealousy and anger. Either you were never a Republican or you are as crazy as the rest of the #NeverTrumpers. No true Republican would support Biden he has become a toxic radical. Win Trump win!
It’s political. The more things they can shut down the better for Biden. Next will be Halloween!
I wouldn't consider any public plan that has so much cost sharing built in it's unaffordable 'lucky'. That's Biden's tokenism, nothing more. #NeverBiden #M4A 🌻

Dear fake christians. What is so Christian,noble oh and non racist about Joe f'ing Biden? #thirdpartyAnd by "you," I mean "you and the dead-enders." The vast, vast majority of Bernie supporters are voting for Biden because they aren't petulant children.
Maybe Biden-Harris taking away the country's meat won't be such a bad thing.
Is your ordering, or at least condoning or accepting, of the reduction of processing capacity by the USPS your acknowledgement that Biden stands a good chance of beating you this fall? Asking for a democracy.
A recent Pew Research Study found that ONLY 9% of Biden supporters are voting for him because of his policies  We could a had Yang. Over 150 well thought out policies for the future.  #YangGang  #howdidwegethere
Trump vs Kanye vs Biden hologram 😂. Hologram will be controlled by a group of people and will sound like Joe 🤣
😂 Keep retweetikg please. People are sick of every news channel chanting the same mantras. Fox News has bad reporters as well, this ad is hilarious. Joe Biden is doomed, Fox News is even crushing NBA ratings. GJ helping Fox News get more popular 🤣
😂 “How Biden chose Carmelo Harris”. He’s racist and sexist, that’s why. Nothing else. If she were a man or white karmel Harris wouldn’t have been picked. #dnc proving once again they are the real racists/sexists.
Want to know what’s actually happening in the suburbs? HOMEMADE Biden/Harris signs! This one went up today a few doors down from  and me in Apple Valley, MN #BidenHarris2020 #Suburbanhousewife
Also, and I think this is important to note, there have only been four Boomer presidents -- Bill Clinton (born 1946), George W. Bush (1946), Barack Obama (1961), and Donald Trump (1946). Joe Biden is part of the Silent Generation.
Why, it's almost as if Biden's plan is really popular.
Most of the establishment democrats are in bed with pharmaceutical companies, including Joe Biden because he has been saying his whole political career he wants to cut Medicare and Medicaid and social security.
Love their claim that Biden can’t speak off script...do they just tune out all the things Trump has said off script?  Injecting bleach?  Attacks on every person who’s ever said a negative word about him?  Pandemic of NINETEEN SEVENTEEN?  Airport attacks during the revolution?
Nobody cares what you believe you liar. Dems sure are worried about trump “not leaving after he loses”. Bet you anything the election will be contested due to mail in fraud, then they’ll just say enough is enough and try to put Biden in. Obviously they are planning on losing.
How many times does the Coons family need to tell you this before you fucking get it?
It's tough listening to the BBC and still hearing 20 minutes about Trump. I so hope Biden will win.  Our nation will still be screwed for a while, but at least that eliminates one problem I won't have to hear about.
Why isn’t anyone talking about Tara Reade?! The woman that Biden allegedly sexually assaulted. You people confuse me some times.
It is going to be brutal listening to Biden-Harris until Nov 3rd.  If they are talking they are lying. I can't imagine having to listen to 4 years of it that will be as bad as the 8 years of BHO's lying. I am sick of it already. They are not going to do anything they say.
Joe Biden mispronounce her name right after to save trump, Joe Biden to the rescue 😂
#Election2020    Trump says of Biden/Harris: “They don't want to have cows, they don't want to have any form of animals."  Major disagrees....
If Joe Biden is allowed to bring up the past then Trump should bring up that Joe Biden has been saying he wants to defund social security, Medicare and medicaid his entire political career.
I’m so glad that u didn’t lose your power over Covid! Your fighting for the people! I’m so tired of Republicans trying to push u out! Thank god democrats blocked there vote! Thank you for all u do! And all u stand for! Minnesota’s a blue State! Vote blue!Joe Biden! Kamala Harris
Come on  Biden is spreading false information.   Enforce your own rules!
This is a complete lie and easy to verify.  Biden thinks dem voters are idiots and easily influenced.  In most cases, he’s right.   They are...
Omg. Listening to Biden. Tears. Hope. Please help fire tRump. #trumpyourfired #FireTrumpInNovember #BidenHarris2020
Someone needs to remind Joe Biden...about 10 times a day!
You do realize that Biden has ties with Epstein also, right?
yes and a Republican would never get elected again! Now Biden can pick the rest of his cabinet mayor of Seattle Chicago New York...
This was true of Joe Biden in 2008, and we never heard from him ever again.
I sure hope so too. I’ve met a couple of black dudes who are normally Democrat but voting for Jo in the elections. Honestly though black people my age or so don’t even like Biden. They realize that he is not here to help us at all.
But correct. Biden is still going to get the majority vote of 90%+ but may be a point or two lower because of Harris. Where that vote is going? I have no idea.
Black people are most definitely voting for Biden in overwhelmingly high numbers. But, I don’t think it’s going to be a few percentage points lower than usual just because of Harris.
Build Back Better. Biden 😅🤣😂
Not according to Biden.
You do realize that you're running against *Biden*, right?
"Did Joe Biden announce his pick too quickly? Twitter discusses."
Biden doesn’t teach abortion is good. He just thinks women should make the decision  How do you feel about a Bishop that knows of child sex abuse in the church but refuses to do anything about it because it’s not his department.
Honestly, both Biden and Harris are well positioned to "Nixon Goes to China" this. Will they? We'll see.
Looking like Sen. Kamala Harris might be Biden’s VP pick. I’ll let you know when it’s confirmed.
I was actually hoping for Susan Rice for vice president, but Harris is probably the right choice for Biden.
Joe Biden is humble in the best way. He doesn't think he knows best. He doesn't hate you if you tell him he's wrong. He is willing to listen and learn. He is the opposite of Donald Trump.
I voted for you. Thanks for all the ways you continue to fight the good fight. All in now for Biden/Harris.
The president just gave us notice we’re going to have to learn Chinese if Biden wins. It’s never too early to start learning!  加油拜登的！
Biden is going to get way more votes, including way more mail-in votes, and then Trump is going to claim that makes the results rigged and illegitimate. Can we all acknowledge this now so no one claims to be surprised later? 1/2
Tulsi Gabbert wipes her ass with Kamala Harris. Harris is a true leftist suck up and is poster child for drama and for nearly destroying a justice's life with spite. She is just as dangerous as Biden, And will destroy this country, Mark my words. Tulsi has more class any day.
Kamala as Biden’s VP won’t stop the fact that you have to, for as long as you live, live with the fact that you knowingly and willingly voted for a Racist Rapist.
What an awful, awful choice by Biden. In a time where criminal justice reform is so important to our country..he picks one of the few people with a worse record on it then himself...Please, someone get me  to end this #kamalaharris garbage ASAP.
One thing about the Harris pick is that Biden, like any competent politician, knows that a sharp attack in a debate is part of the game, and that you don't take it personally, *especially* when you're on the same team.
Gonna be hilarious when Biden posts [insert joke name here]. People will laugh and laugh. [NOTE: DO NOT POST THIS JOKE TEMPLATE WITHOUT REVISION.]
You misspelled Biden
Pence locked down conservatives.  Cheney &amp; Biden locked down experience.  Duckworth...national security?
Biden is the one I have heard say those dreadful words.
#BlackLivesMatter #antifa Joe Biden has been in office over 40 years. He was Vice President for eight years. Why didn’t he get rid of the “systemic racism” then, and why would he now? You are voting for Obama again but worse basically.
I though 2020 was racist. Now that you picked Biden’s VP for him as a woman, back to 2016 me too gender wars!? 😂 didn’t see this coming!
Yea but these riots started under Obama same with the kids being in cages. Syria's civil war was also started under Obama's watch as well. Not to mention Joe Biden wants to defund social security, Medicare and medicaid the proof is in his entire political career. Look it up.
Biden-Buttigieg, the ticket everyone expected.
24. #TrumpPressConference  Says China will own this country if Biden wins.
Pocket change for the corrupt Biden's!
He’s more delusional then Joe Biden.
This letter doesn’t advocate for a particular Black woman. We are not interchangeable! Do I want to see Black women lead? YES! Do I want Black women in positions of power? YES! But this further tokenizes the Black women Biden IS considering.Its not the solidarity they think it is
I've long believed that Biden voters are more likely to vote. Nothing has changed my mind.
Donate to Biden campaign
Yup. Democrats are using social media and every other platform to censor and steer the election. That and including China and Iran with election interference helps them even more. Don’t forget Russia, they wanted Hillary and want Biden...
Waiting for Biden to announce his VP pick like...
Joe Biden has been saying he wants to defund social security, Medicare and Medicaid and disability his entire political career. So whats your point? How will things get any better with Joe Biden when he is just part of the problem? If you don't believe me do some research.
Lmao did you know that Joe Biden also wants to defund Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Yet you sheep still believe he will change our country for the better. Face it the two party system isn't working. Also the proof is in Joe Biden's entire political career.
Hopefully trump wins because if Joe Biden wins we will lose social security and Medicare and Medicaid because he wants to defund all 3 of them to pay for his illegal immigrants and their votes. The cartel problem will only get worse with a Democrat in office.
Joe Biden is more corrupted than Trump will ever be. He also wants to defund social security and Medicare and Medicaid. He has been saying that for most of his political career.
Biden won't be their candidate come election time anyway.
You must have mistaken Trump for Biden.  Where’s Hunter?
You know it. And expect them to refuse to cooperate in any way with a Biden administration.
That is just a little pocket change for the corrupt Biden family.
I can never understand what Biden is even trying to say, and the rate times I do it’s something stupid or racist 😂. If Biden talks he will lose basically, GW2.0
At that point, they move on to.... 🌹: Oh, well if Biden isn't going to give free college to everyone making any amount of money then HE MAY AS WELL NOT EVEN DO IT.
Here you go.
They can't. And if they can, Joe Biden can fund Medicare out of Defense, so good luck.
#IntelligenceReports So Russia is working against Biden. China is working against Trump. Guess which one Trump will do something about.I’m socialist and the people making attacking trump for his brothers death need to stop regardless of your opinion about trump death is hard to deal with especially when it’s someone so close, I hope Biden calls on people to stop harassing trump on this.
I don't think they'll need any help crashing it if Biden's virtual things are any indicator  😂
Mr. Biden,  Tear down that wall!  White House continues to build new 13-foot high 'anti climb' wall.
WANT 2 SEE BIDEN/HARRIS N  DEMOCRACY  N TRUTH N HONESTY N RESPECT N HONOR RETURN 2 THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER BEING GONE FOR 4 YEARS BE SURE TO VOTE FOR  BIDEN/HARRIS.       DON'T LET POLLS/OPINIONS MAKE U THINK UR VOTE WON'T MATTER. POLLS OPINIONS DON'T WIN ELECTIONS,  ONLY VOTES DO
My point is that for people in rural America their bubble is real. I’ve driven all over the five state area, and Texas recently, and I didn’t see any Biden signs either. Yes it’s a banjoland take but he’s not wrong about what he see’s in his bubble.
Don't be scared. Vote Biden Harris!  Moral of the tweet.... Don't vote Republican!
WELL, HOPEFULLY IT WON'T BE THAT HARD TO VOTE FOR  BIDEN/HARRIS.       BUT IF trump GETS HIS WAY WHO KNOWS WHAT THE HELL HE WILL DO?      MIGHT BUILD WALLS AROUND POLLING PLACES     LIKE ADOLPH trump MIGHT STATION MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PRIVATE GESTAPO/SS ARMY OUTSIDE POLLING PLACES.
Think again
Obama 2008: Yes, We Can Biden 2020: Come On, Man
So, what you are saying is that you do not care that she was deliberately lying about Biden? Or do I misunderstand you?
The most frustrating part is that they agree that Biden is trash and still think that he deserves their vote. My hardest lefty friend even agrees with me that Obama sucked. Yet somehow still thinks Trump is worse.
Yep, they did it deceptively to make it sound worse than it was because trust me, they won't report the Q3 numbers the same way; although they will report the Q4 numbers to make them look ridiculously good if Biden wins.
Just as it takes one hip hop star - suffering from mental illness - to sabotage the Black vote for Biden. Smh 🤦🏾‍♀️ 🤯
But she should really be addressed as Senator Harris, with respect. Until she’s Madame President, that is (I don’t see Biden finishing the term).
So if everything needs changing why hasnt career politician Joe Biden done anything??   Why is it Trumps fault career politicians haven’t been successful?  Maybe because they have other agendas?  Hmmmm.
Nah, he'll just use the Obama strategy and only hold pressers every 3 months.  But he handles the hostile media pretty well, and when he has a stroke it will be long after his second term.  Biden may have already had one.
Maybe Trump should adopt the Biden model:  only call on friendly press with pre-approved questions.  No, Trump is smart enough and courageous enough to take this shit from a hostile media on a daily basis.
I'd like to hear Biden answer ANY tough question.
Does your daughter need a lock?  Sounds like she already has one on Biden-Harris 2020!
convince me to vote for Biden/Harris without mentioning Trump.
Politicians campaign where they have a chance of winning.  To do otherwise would be a waste of time and resources.  Do you think Biden will campaign in Alabama or Mississippi?  It's not a matter of caring.  It's a matter of getting to 270 electoral votes.
First, it's Aryan Nation.  Second, it's the democrats who founded the KKK and fought for segregation (Biden supported Ayran  views).  Third, the left has been screaming RACIST! at conservatives for decades as a political tactic.  Read Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals.
Joe Biden touches young children, has a new racist comment almost weekly, has failed in office for 45 years and rarely can complete a full sentence. I'll pass on his advice
#OhGoodShotMaam!  Just remember, #Biden and #Harris will kill them for the good of the world, rather than make peace from selfish, political motives like  #OrangeManBad!!!  #SnarkIsAnUnderappreciatedArtForm
Yeah but Biden can't survive 4 years of Biden.
The Trump administration got rid of a bloated team of bureaucrats, but once we knew that China and the WHO had been lying to us, in a week he put together a stronger team of medical professionals and dealt with the pandemic better than Hillary ever could.  Biden would be lost.
Nice try using the democrat talking points (aka Excuses).  Listen to Biden talk from 10 years ago and it is obvious he has lost it.  Even democrat leadership knows it. You can keep up the illusion, but only until the first debate.  Then it's GAME OVER.
All the Biden followers running to get a mask
If ur in support of #BLM and #ACAB and ur going to vote 4 Biden/Harris, ur a hypocrite.  If you are not going to be part of the #generalstrike due 2 the govt not completing the stimulus package and supported Sanders, ur also a hypocrite.
BIDEN/HARRIS, A CLASS ACT!!  AMERICA HAS A CHANCE TO RECLAIM ALL THAT IT HAS LOST.  trump/dense NOTHING BUT THE MOST PATHETIC PITIFUL INEPT INCOMPETENT DISGUSTING DEPLORABLE DECEITFUL DESPICABLE REPUGNANT REPULSIVE VAIN CONCEITED ARROGANT EGOTISTICAL  CLASSLESS ACT EVER!!!
Any chance Open Skies survives or resumes under a Biden presidency?
I just oppose Biden
A smart candidate doesn't care about the popular vote.  It's the electoral college that determines the winner, and that made Trump brilliant and Hillary...home.   Trumps base will walk through fire to vote this time +12M, and probably more after reasonable dems hear Biden debate.
Not that arguing with a Karen will change your gullible little deranged mind.  But when Biden steps onto the debate stage with Trump it's GAME OVER.  Then your hate will really consume you.  Have fun screaming into your pillow on Nov 4th!
Do you have ANY evidence for a corruption charge? Nope, just a bunch of CNN propaganda.  Biden, however, has documented incidents of enriching his family through corrupt deals.  And you want HIM negotiating with China?  China owns the Bidens!
Biden can't remember his name without a teleprompter.  People will feel sorry for the poor old guy when Trump shreds him in the debates.  CNN will accuse Trump of Elder Abuse! But it will still be GAME OVER for Biden.
Honest question are u voting for Biden after what he said last week regarding African Americans and the history of his running mate?
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
I popped this list in a thread yesterday as potential targets for blame should Biden lose:
Bernie fell back in line fast enough that I don't think he'll be the target of Team D's ire should Biden lose.
You think Kristol has beclowned himself to the max, and he proves you wrong.  Did Joe McCarthy run for President against Truman? Did Robert Welch run against Ike? No.  But Bill will ride the Good Ship Biden into the water, confident his "conservative" donors will rescue him.
.It redirected to the Biden campaign, until about 12-24 hours ago. Now it redirects to "site unavailable."
I just donated $200 to Biden Harris in order to match the amount my son sent in today
I hope somebody or somebodies crash the crap out of it.  Well...  that is unless Team D crashes it without any help.  Which if Biden's streams are any indicator is highly likely.
Shouldn’t that be Biden?
that’s the argument that my sister-in-law used when talking to my wife tonight. Voting for trump because “Biden couldn’t do any better”. trump will get the majority of votes from this devout evangelical &amp; her circle of friends. Can’t have fact based conversation. Tone deaf.
BIDEN IS EVERYTHING trump ISN'T.
Translation: White Woman will be submissive to their White Husbands in knowing, I'll keep Blacks &amp; Mexicans away from their neighborhoods. Also don't vote Biden because he'll allow a Black Man to allow fair opportunities to all races.   Trump's racism is so blatant &amp; disgusting!!
I didn’t know  was campaigning for Biden now.
Is Biden rocking a mullet?
But smear ads that center around Biden’s failing mental state aren’t nasty...makes sense to me.
i am closer to biden ideologically than jorgensen so no thanks
I listened to your podcast,which was  thing I believe is that we need to o encourage the Biden voters to vote early, whether by mail or in person.Then their votes will be counted earlier too.
Veteran Republican strategist  disagreed.  "I think that messaging will work," he said. "Middle America -- the moderates and the indepdendents -- are certainly not looking for an adminstration that's going to be beholden to the far left."
I can understand not wanting to vote for Biden/Harris if you dislike their records. But acting without a focus on the results may still result in harm, and your intentions will provide little solace to those harmed. Effects matter more than intention, IMO.
trump KNOWS HE IS GOING TO LOSE THE 2020 ELECTION AND WILL DO WHATEVER TO NOT HAVE TO GIVE UP THE POWER N ATTENTION HE HAS.      KANYE WEST IS NOTHING BUT A INEXPERIENCED UNQUALIFIED NO CHANCE OF WINNING  trump TOY USED TO HOPEFULLY  DRAW VOTES AWAY FROM THE BIDEN/HARRIS TICKET.
AMERICA, IN A COVID19  CRISIS WHO WOULD YOU RATHER LOOK TOO FOR LEADERSHIP? BIDEN/HARRIS--PEOPLE YOU CAN TRUST IN WHAT THEY SAY trump/dense-- 2 GD MFin LYING SACKS OF ORANGE SHIT YOU COULDN'T TRUST FOR SHIT YOUR ANSWER WILL TELL A GREAT DEAL  ABOUT AMERICA AND IT'S FUTURE.
.I am. I think she'll be a bad candidate for #Biden and the #Democrats. I know he had to pick a black woman, but I didn't expect her. She's a loser.
WITH BIDEN/HARRIS AMERICAN WILL  FINALLY CORRECT/RIGHT IT'S ROYAL 4 YR F#CK UP KNOWN AS THE trump/dense RESIDENCY.
RIGHT ON HOLLY, TELL IT LIKE IT IS. trumps A COMPLETE ORANGE MORON AND ALL AMERICA SHOULD VOTE FOR BIDEN/HARRIS
Joe Biden's platform is the most progressive platform of a nominee in decades.  So mission accomplished? Let's restore humanity by voting Biden/Harris.  (And protect literal human lives from Trump's harm)
Fair point. So look at the platform being put forth by the Biden Harris campaign. Look at the anti-lunching law Harris put forth. Look  her policies on abolishing mandatory minimums and legalizing marijuana.
Or maybe they figure no one can possibly hide it any longer. It isn't as if Biden's breakdown is obscure.
Lies and fear-mongering. That’s all you got. Biden and Harris will restore hope, dignity, honesty, and democracy. Trump will continue to tear this country apart while he steals from us and lets us die while he plays golf.
I keep seeing repostings of Obama’s endorsement and congratulatory statement to Biden and Harris like thats supposed to mean something 🙃🥴 or we’re supposed to be relieved. He was symbolic (which is fine) in the same way Kamala being VP is (also fine). Both moderate af lol.
She is certainly qualified at 55.  Can she garner the votes Biden needs for the win?
No it’s an old picture. Biden was in Delaware all day and Harris was in California all day. They’re going to be together in Dover Delaware tomorrow.
It feels so good having Biden/Harris as a team. They will bring ethics back to government. They will bring back empathy. They will bring back fairness. And so much more.
At least Biden will try and hide the bad things his team does and not kill the gays. Harris will just try to lock up the trans folks though.
Biden/Harris will win. #BidenHarris
How should I respond to a R who asks about Kamala’s response to the sexual harassment allegations against Biden?
I will crawl over broken glass to vote Biden/Harris and dem up and down the ticket. Still, Senator Warren, I just want to say you brought humanity, intelligence, wit and more to this campaign, and I just can’t thank you enough for all you do and all you are.
“Nasty to Kavanaugh”...is Trump campaigning for Biden/Harris now cause this sounds like a great endorsement?
Harris was my favorite, but all the women up for VP were good. Please people vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. They are a great team.
Hey, I hate that Biden is the Dem nom as well. He's incredibly problematic. INCREDIBLY. BUT...still going to vote for him over Trump in Nov. Because that's what we got. And if you don't because your upset about Biden, them congrats, you've contributed to four more years of hell.
He picked her bc she is smarter than Trump and Biden combined, is a huge badass, and is entirely competent.  The black community isn’t a huge Kamala backer, so your point is moot
Actually this is a photo op.  The difference is Biden didn’t need to shoot and gas peaceful protestors to hold a Bible upside down. He just rode a bike instead while Trump can’t even walk down a ramp.
Biden ain’t slick

Donald Trump gave us four principled clemency grants (Johnson, Munoz, Hall &amp; Negron) and the 1st Step Act, which is more than people expected given his prior statements. I hope and expect that Biden will use clemency- and you should hope so, too.

* Why are you CONSPIRING with Russia &amp; Putin against Biden??? SHAME ON YOU.      #BillBarr    #gop
Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP is just more proof that cops and klan go hand in hand.
Because both have mixed records on criminal justice, the Biden/Harris ticket needs to take the initiative and talk early, often and specifically about reform. Then, when elected, they need to do it without reservation or deference to the DOJ.
Very on brand for Joe Biden to be holding his phone upside down. 🤣🤣🤣
Great, what I going to do with all the boxes of these Biden/ ghost of Eliza Hamiliton shirts I ordered ?
AMERICA, BIDEN/HARRIS HAVE PLANS TO FIGHT THE COVID19 CRISIS. trump n dense AFTER 7 MONTHS AND 160000+ DEATHS STILL HAVE NO NATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE COVID19 CRISIS. 1st ignored it Called it a hoax Said over by summer It'll just disappear WHO DO YOU WANT TO LEAD AMERICA'S FIGHT
Those people were going to vote for Biden no matter who he picked for VP.  She doesn't sway a demographic. She doesn't bring a better chance of winning any States. She instead of mitigating some of Biden's biggest problems, amplifies them.  Picking Harris is tactical idiocy.
Kamala Harris was the right pick for the Biden campaign. It’s the safe pick. They didn’t overthink it. I’m thrilled to see a woman and POC on this ticket. I’m also glad republicans can’t relitigate Benghazi/Tarmac/Hillary for the trillionth time if they’d picked Susan Rice. Happy
BIDEN/HARRIS,,, AMERICA FINALLY  HAS SOMETHING IT CAN LOOK FORWARD TOO AFTER ALMOST 4 YRS OF PURE ORANGE BULLSHIT N LIES THAT HAS THE WHOLE WORLD LAUGHING AT AMERICA.
BIDEN/HARRIS=PROVEN WINNERS JUST WHAT AMERICAN NEEDS.  trump/dense=PROVEN LOSERS JUST WHAT AMERICA DOESN'T NEED.
trump KNOWS HE'S GOING TO LOSE 2020 AND WILL YRY ANYTHING TO REMAIN IN POWER.     KAYNE WEST IS NOTHING BUT A INEXPERIENCED UNQUALIFIED trump PIGEON SET UP TO DRAW VOTES AWAY FROM BIDEN
I fully agree with you  Warren would have been an amazing President or Vice President. I’m hopeful that Biden will put her in a key position. I also think Kamala Harris is an excellent choice.
The average American voter is not ready for the first female Vice President of Jamaican and Indian immigrant parents.  Dumb move on Biden team.  Smh.
Biden picks Kamala Harris, his former 2020 rival, to be his vice presidential running mate
Biden/Harris 2020!! Let's Go!!
If Biden wins corona will be the least of our problems
"BIDEN N HARRIS" A PRESIDENT N VICE PRESIDENT AMERICA CAN AND WILL BE  BE PROUD OF. THAT WILL BRING BACK THE RESPECT AMERICA DESERVES  trump n dense.  TWO SENILE  BOZO'S AMERICA'S IS ASHAMED/ EMBARRASSED OF. WHO HAVE DESTROYED ANY/ALL REPECT THAT AMERICA DESERVES.
Personally, Tulsi Gabbard. Nobody I know except for “vote blue no matter who” people like Biden even a little bit, and Tulsi undoubtedly has the power to draw in voters from across the line.  Of course, they wouldn’t have chosen Biden in the first place if they wanted to win.
I’m thrilled. Vote Biden-Harris.
Congrats on your pick!! I was SO hoping you would pick Kamala Harris! You two will make a great team! "Ridin' with Biden!"
It’s February 2021.   It is announced that Joe Biden can no longer perform his duties as President, and  takes over as POTUS. #BidenHarris2020
Trump just won a second term. Smh.  Your average American voter is not ready for the first female Vice President of Jamaican and Indian immigrant parents.  Dumb move on Biden team.
Okay honestly folks, Biden isn’t amazing and neither is Kamala but they’re significantly better than Trump/Pence. Like seriously I’m convinced some of you live in make-believe world where you’re still upset your favorite candidate didn’t get the nomination. Come on...
So Kamala, who did you sleep with to get to be Biden’s running mate? We are gonna have some fun with this! BJ and the hooker! What a team!
Senator Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick! Congrats, Senator!
#VPPick Well, now the dems will at least win California.  LOL  Harris is the pit bull they need to fight the fights Biden can't handle, which is all of them.
BREAKING NEWS: Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate!  #BidenHarris2020
Kamala Harris for VP, a great choice, vote Biden Harris. 🌊🌊🌊😄😸😊😂
A Harris-Pence debate will be far more interesting, and informed, than any Trump-Biden debate.
BIDEN HARRIS 2020 LETS GO!!!!
How nice for  to finally tell Joe Biden who his running mate will be! #BidenVP
My blood is boiling! How can we shut him up? Trump says men may be 'insulted' by Biden's female VP pledge #Biden2020

I asked one of my buddies, what’s the worst thing about Trump. He said that he lies. He says he’s voting for Biden. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Scary thought: when Biden wins the election trump can start running for 2024.😳
Raging Endorsement, :`)  Why I Want Biden to Lose More than I Want Trump to Win
I’d vote for Biden if he named a cabbage as running mate. Fortunately there aren’t any cabbages on his short list.
So crazy how much I bought into her bullshit and how quickly I forgot she existed after she endorsed Biden. I would say it was a good 2-3 months where I didn’t see anything about her on here. And then shocked at myself for how quickly I forgot about her.
So-called president drumpf forgets the word virus when he is talking about coronavirus. But yet he says Joe Biden is out of it.

I AGREE. THE DAMN CONVENTIONS ARE JUST A EXCUSE FOR GROWN UPS TO GET TOGETHER TOO  ACT LIKE KIDS AT A UNCHAPERONED  PARTY.     IT'S BIDEN N trump SO WHO NEEDS A CONVENTION? ESPICALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC?
That dude would have mopped the floor with old man Biden.
DAMN OBVIOUS KANYE,  INEXPERIENCED UNQUALIFIED,  JUST AN ATTEMPT BY trump TO TAKE VOTES AWAY FROM BIDEN. ANOTHER EXAMPLE trump KNOWS HE IS GOING TO LOSE AND WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THAT.       SO FAR trump HAS ASKED KAYNE AND PUTUN FOR HELP, IS KIM JUNG UN NEXT?

BIDEN PLANS ON BEATING COVID19. trump IGNORED IT, CALLED IT A HOAX, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT  OVER BY SUMMER, IT WILL JUST DISAPPEAR. AFTER 7 MONTHS N 160000+ DEATHS STILL NO NATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE COVID19 CRISIS.      WHO DO YOU WANT TO LEAD AMERICA'S FIGHT AGAINST IT?
Biden is apparently announcing his VP running mate this week! I won't lie that I'm secretly rooting for Michelle Obama who isn't even on the list!
Dude, who are you going to vote for them? All this hate you spew for Biden only helps Trump... you don't see this??
you must be completely high or drunk or both. in the last few months, have you had the opportunity to watch Joe Biden try to carry/express a thought to completion?
10,000 times as often and worse.  Get used to it Biden voters.  We can do this for four years too... if you get that lucky.
The only reason that I plan to watch the conventions is that I'm expecting both to be a spectacular comedy of technical errors.  If Biden's streams are any indicator, the Team D one is almost guaranteed to come apart at the seams.
As a hard working American I can't handle 1 day of Joe Biden
Hahaha, I’m joe Biden &amp; I forgot I insulted black folks. Not only that I was never ASHAMED of the Mass incarceration Bill; remember African Americans are not socially &amp; “mentally developed” he believed they belong in jail like heynas. Don’t vote JOE!
Oh man, but Trumpypoo said in his sensationalized, overproduced smear ads that Biden is weak and not fit for office! It’s almost like he was trying to divert attention away from his own failing health. 🤯
As another lifelong Republican, I like you am supporting Biden and the Democratic Party 100% with money and my vote! The Republican Party is a disgrace and should all be voted out of office for undermining the rule of law and supporting Trump’s actions.
very sad that biden is the democratic nominee. we coulda had bernie

It does. Now do 46+47= Biden Harris
Bigger than the collapse of Wall Street fix by Obama and Biden, bigger than the Great Depression, bigger than WWI where 116k americans lost their lives. Trump has us on a rocket to break WWII deaths by spring. 416800 is the number of deaths he is tracking and trying to reach. SOS
Fuck biden and trump all we need is ratings   Vote for the Masterater in Novemeber
Almost apple season. How you like them apples? What’s up with you and your willie. Nobody has cared about that for ages lol.  Sit back, relax, the big man, Mr. Biden, is almost in the drivers seat. There could be little turbulence initially but it will smooth out to a nice flight
Pick a poll, any poll. Biden Harris are pulling away with it. America is so tired of all the lies, the torture of anyone’s children, the overt racism and the goose step toward Facist strongman with tiny hands. The crooks he cant get past senate approval and did I mention lies?
Dr.  Do you need a safe space?   Biden hasn’t done a thing in 40’years.  Also do t you think it’s a joke to be in Washington that long.   Maybe term limits?   Notice how I didn’t call Biden names because I don’t agree with his policies.  Maybe try that iapproach.
Saw a MAGAt argue that we can't have mail-in voting because the Postal Workers Union endorsed Biden, the candidate who’s not actively trying to dismantle their organization &amp; hijack an election. This is their twisted logic in a nutshell. #TrumpForPrison2020 #SaveThePostOffice

Postal union endorses Biden candidacy as 'survival' of USPS at stake
BaBye.  46+47=Biden Harris Maybe in 12 years what’s left of the GOP will put up drunky Matt.
Voting for Biden and Kamala is not going to erase the irreparable damage they have already done. It not only justifies their shitty stances but does very little to change systemic problems.
Dude was in some horror movie my grandmother told me about. I’d imagine his aides have his twitter account and goof on some fools. 46+47= Biden Harris
I felt so much hurt though your poem. U can go to any fire station  4 help. 1st begin to love yourself, not just using your left hand because it feels like you are with a stranger, your heart can open to the Biden Harris equation 46+47= USA wins. Even his “ballandchain” feels it
I feel like you didn't read my response since I'm saying I'm not even convinced Biden/Harris is progress if all they do is bring the Dem party to the right; Mass incarceration, pot criminalized, still ICE, no univ healthcare, etc. It's gunna be BS ID politics. Hope I'm wrong.
it would actually slap if Biden could be construed as a socialist in any meaningful way

Internal Documents Circulated To DNC Delegates Hint At Why Biden Picked Harris  via
Biden says all U.S. governors should mandate masks to slow pandemic
Trump is an unmitigated disaster. The GOP should own that. Instead, the Democrats have invited them to headline the DNC, form a superpac to support Biden, rehabilitate their reputations, and pull the party even further to the right than it already was. This is "resistance"?
I'm trying to stay out of political posts but imagine being the person that die hard supports Trump and also posts about Biden making women uncomfortable. I mean c'mon guys and now I'm seeing stuff about Kamala not being from here like where do we draw the line?
Biden says all U.S. governors should mandate masks to slow pandemic
I swear to god if I wind up voting for Biden &amp; he fucking loses or takes the US farther down the shit hole we’re going down, I’m blocking all you “blue no matter who” bitches. Y’all give me the option of pedo/rapist A or pedo/rapist B &amp; expect me to vote with a clean conscious??
I’ll stress Trump 2020 b4 I let Joe Biden run black ppl into da ground.
After watching Hamilton again, I think that Trump and Biden should duel and whoever wins will be our president.
Once Biden defeats you in November, someone is going to cold clock you sooo effin hard 😆 Your fat ass is going to be lying on the ground crying like the little pansy you are 😂 😂
There is an Australian new channel that has done a segment on Creepy Joe’s memory loss. It’s scary! The title is Biden’s cognitive issues can no longer be ignored.
if anything, one of the reasons a Biden win is important is so there'll be some bipartisan support for restricting executive power- the Ds aren't going to do that when a R is in power, that'd be Going Against The Process, but they might vote for it for a D pres for Bipartisanship
Normally I'm not againsts masks but this coming from Biden? No.
no, what happens in 2024 after a Biden win is that the dems go "oh, that worked" and run another conservative.  and we're *getting* four years of GOP, if not in 2021 then relatively soon. if your strategy is "win every time and change nothing", that's bound to fail eventually
Former Vice President and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says he wants a three-month nationwide mask mandate. What do you think?
New IV Words – One Berner to others, I’m asking – again – please do not enable Trump. That means voting Biden/Harris rather than staying home or voting for a 3rd-party, no-chance-in-hell candidate. Read the post:  #environment #ClimateCrisis #TrumpOut2020
Biden is responsible for a lot of hardline criminal justice policies that targeted people of color. He's a VERY oldschool democrat. He's no Strom Thurmond that's for sure but he's not what we're looking for progressively. I'll just tell people i'm voting for Harris.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
I assume you're donating all the profits to the Biden/Harris campaign.
C'mon already. I can't stand the fake judge, but she's obviously echoing Fox's lame talking points about Biden not being healthy/fit for office here.   Can we stop being outraged by the worst bad-faith interpretations of EVERYTHING?!
Biden's campaign is incoherent nonsense.  He's holding a knife to stab religious in the back if elected.
also lots of trump signs obviously but i just mean that in the places where you might think you'd see a biden sign, you didn't
drove across northern minnesota recently and saw lots of blm yard signs and state &amp; local DFL candidate signs but not a single biden sign... makes u think

I’m a Christian.   Please stop talking for all “christians”, if your party is really ‘pro-life’ why the vehement stance against masks, against science &amp; for opening the economy &amp; schools without a plan except “thoughts &amp; prayers”.   Asking for a friend!
If y’all idiots vote for Kanye instead of Joe Biden . Trump will win mark my words 🤦🏾‍♂️
I wonder if Kamala will make that same smug, incredulous look on her face when Joe Biden manages to lose against the most unpopular candidate in history.
Biden &amp; Harris sitting in a tree burning America first came crime then came terror then the branch broke and they were eaten by cannibals
I'm confused. Are we talking Trump or Biden?
Nothing that Kamala Harris has said or done in the past is going to matter at this point. Only thing that matters is what she does and says over the next 3 months. Same goes for Biden, unfortunately.
Joe Biden eats little boys , prove me wrong
Who are you voting for &amp; how do you NOT understand that any vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump? Like it or not, that’s a fact you can rely on. All this talk to organize, overthrow &amp; protest doesn’t change that &amp; is tangential to the election. Takes a multi-pronged approach.
Cancel Biden!
I disagree. It's the moderates and independents that are going to decide this election and getting as many Republicans as possible to disavow Trump is the best way to get their vote. AOC supporters are voting for Biden anyway except for the few Bernie whiners who are sitting out.
Biden &amp;Harris  Obama &amp; Biden  Third term
Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back  via  Trump and company only wish something would happen to Biden.
That train about to run into a wall!!! It's called Biden/Harris.
Well Trump has done more for this country than Biden has and it’s not even close. 3 1/2 years to 50.
It pretty obvious who we’re forced to vote for at this point but people are allowed to air their legitimate grievances with the candidate that’s been forced upon us. I don’t think it’s fair to try to shut down how people feel about Biden.
So people get pissed at Biden
What the hell is wrong with you people? First, Biden is a Catholic.  Second, why would that MATTER???????????
Whoa, boy.  You don't dare go up against Kamala Harris.  She'd eat you alive. As will Joe Biden.  You're failing fast.

wrong.  Biden said he would appoint Beto as his gun czar.  Just google Beto and guns and see what he has said.
David, I can name several policies but in place by the Trump ADM to improve minorities lives.  What policies have Harris and Biden done in their years in the Senate.  Let me save you the trouble  NADA  zero zip   they talk a big game but don't deliver for minorties ever
Pretty simple, Biden and Harris are spend spend spend, open borders, they are both against fracking and cheap energy.   Both are for higher taxes.  Also both are phonies.  Their policies have done nothing to help minorities and Trump has.  Biden has done nada for 40yrs
what actual alternative is there to Biden though, i don't want to vote for the guy but i just see a bad choice and a worse one
Some things, not everything, will get better if Biden wins. Nothing will get better if we give up and let Trump win.
Kamala Harris Is Biden’s VP Pick — Here’s What It Means For The Election And Beyond | FiveThirtyEight
Yes but, if you vote for Biden and live somewhere like California where he's  guaranteed to win, you won't be doing much. But if enough people vote third party, we may see one party adopt their values. This isn't as good as getting a third party president, but it's something.
I seen that lmao plus who use to play footsies with Ghiselle and Epstein!? I am so excited that Biden picked such a strong woman!!! I could tell he was shaking in his  Shoes he took 2 minutes to insult her! It's ok Kamalas a big girl she definitely can handle those twats!
Biden is a practicing Catholic . Please apologize and correct the information.

If Biden wins, it’s going to be deliciously entertaining when Heidi Heitkamp is named ag secretary and North Dakota Republicans lose their minds.
This person is clearly talking about how insane it would be to back Biden right now
Within minutes of the presumptive Democratic nominee's announcement Tuesday, false information was circulating on social media, claiming that Harris had called Biden a "racist" and that she is not eligible to be president.
It's an important and valid question. Joe Biden admitted he probably wouldn't live until the end of his first term. #KamalaHarrisVP #JoeBiden2020
Bill.   What happened to you?    Debates show the difference in policy.  Thinking on your feet.  How you handle pressure.   Only reason you made this idiotic post is yku know Biden would embarrass himself like he did in the Democratic debates and he’s a lot farther gone now
Wow, nothing slanted here from the “impartial media”. She actually says, that it’s likely that Biden won’t be able to fulfill his term. That’s where we are? The left is going to vote for a guy that isn’t going to make it 4 years and will be replaced with a failed candidate.

For some strange reason I read your tweet as saying :”Harris will blow Joe Biden.” Weird.
Along with the fact that she called out Joe Biden on his BS on national TV. also, she is the perfect VP to go against the party of "Law and Order" when those fucks wanna try to be like "she is too harsh in constitutes" when they have LITERALLY BEEN PUTTING KIDS IN CAGES
The turn around dialogue gets everyone farther from reality and the reality is BIDEN VS TRUMP. So, to me, while Biden is a fucking nightmare unto himself, tearing down anything anti 🚽 speaks for itself
During his time as Obama's VP, when did he ever show he was a "Uniter"? When did he ever express an appreciation for the local police forces? Didn't ANTIFA and BLM start their roots under the Obama/Biden administration? Biden is now a tool of the Socialist/Communist Left.

Biden isn't the answer. Both parties are corrupt. Vote 3rd party/green. Jesse Ventura is a perfect example.  #tuesdayvibes #BidenHarris #Trump #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #politics
Biden could just as well have chosen Bernie, since he's adopted Bernie's agenda anyway. They could have made AOC an overlooking presence to secure the young commie vote.
If you're still playing the game that Kamala didn't call Biden a racist than you probably believe Joe had something to do with picking her as his running mate.
Biden just accurately conveyed the basic difference b/w strategy &amp; tactics, and while shocked I'm legit happy when any politician gets it correct.
Curious about Biden's Kamala Harris VP pick? See how she measures up on Rights For All.
Former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has chosen U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American woman on a presidential ticket.
Kamala Harris basically called Biden a rapist and then Joe Biden offered her the vice presidency which she accepted. Huge sellout move on both ends and y’all are eating it up (even though most of you don’t know who Kamala Harris is) because she’s a black woman.
Not sure if Dr. Jill Biden can be Secretary.
Biden doesn't know the difference
We have buttons too!
Trump being a proto-fascist doesn't mean we should allow our leaders to react without scrutiny. Biden could have picked anyone. He picked Kamala Harris.
LET'S GO! #KamalaHarrisForVP
MSG makes more people happy than a Biden/Harris ticket, to be fair
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as U.S. vice-presidential running mate
Democratic presidential candidate Biden taps Senator Kamala Harris as running mate
Biden wrote the 94  crime bill that put massive amounts of black men in jail back in the 90s   Democrats are/were the Dixiecrats in the south who upheld KKK values   Check out Dem. Harry Byrd and his southern manifesto  Shit Carter, Johnson, Clinton.    Both parties are vile
Great not only do I have to vote for Joe Biden, now I also have to vote for Kamala Harris????? Fuck
Not that they aren’t out there   But there’s an agenda and politics is typically straight pandering to black people.  Sadly population is quick to eat it up   They did it with Obama which is the only reason Biden has a chance at all
Here is the famous tweet that ran in conjunction with her challenge during the debate more than a year ago.
Kamala famously challenged Biden's record on opposing legislation that would have desegregated schools with busing policy changes.
Harris, 55, becomes the first Black woman on a major presidential ticket in U.S. history.
Joe Biden has picked California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, fulfilling his promise to ask a woman of color to be his vice president. The former presidential candidate exited the race nine months ago but had a lot of praise among Black voters.
Kamala Harris is Biden's running mate? Hell yeah... she should be president
Huzzah. In a time of growing unrest because of police brutality and the failure of leadership to respond to the people's voice, Joe Biden has selected Kamala "I'm The Top Cop" Harris to be his running mate.  Hey, remember when she pretended she hated him on the debate stage?
unbelievable that biden chose harris
voting for Biden is was easier now with Kamala Haris as VP

I'm predicting it'll be Rice. They need an Obama/Clinton insider to shut down all investigative activities should Biden be elected.
VOTE FOR BIDEN REGARDLESS OF VP PICK. WE SUPPORT ANY FEMALE RUNNING. NO PICK HER APART.
Unfortunately Bernie did not get in, that's what i wanted as well. But if trump gets another term all those things you and i care about will be in even worse shape. Please vote for Biden
Joe Biden is running for President of the United States and hasn’t been asked about lots of things🤷🏻‍♂️

Biden plan for America if elected will destroy America The economy &amp; leave our Taxpayers of now &amp; long into the future with no hope to prosper.
I went from the 20’s to the 80’s. I think 30k is out of reach. Probably the pessimist in me. But it’s still cool to see what your doing. Keep it going. Can’t let Biden win. I didn’t follow you to get a follow back honestly. I just like reading your message and seeing this grow
More than 100 Black leaders and celebrities urge Biden to pick a Black woman as VP"... I don't think these "Black leaders" will vote for Joe Biden; I don't care what the color of the VP is, BUT! if there are plans to hold the WH in 2024 than I think the answer is obvious.
Joe Biden in the morning without his drum of lotion
Biden won't fix anything
How could you have a ballot already? They are not finalised, Biden hasn't pick his vp yet
You think it’s funny they cover up Biden’s coma?
You can not like trump, vote for Biden and still see that he isn't going to be in charge of anything.
Wait, I thought Joe Biden was still camping out in his basement. 😉
Believe in Life After Biden
It’s just a Joe Biden clone, but a little smaller
So Biden is secretly in charge.  Got it.
You damn right fool! We ask questions. We see whats wrong. And let people know, their common sense is is not the problem. Morons voting for Biden with no clue of where he is. That's the problem. Not Trump. Trump 2020!!
as if I would pay money to vote for Joe Biden lmao
Hillary Clinton: Biden has 'great choices' for running mate to help defeat 'wannabe authoritarian'  via
Biden isn’t powerful. He’s impotent. Acting like he is is just deflection
So it’s ok for trump to be racist bc Biden used to be like Trump. Works at a MAGA rallies of the intellectually deprived
Predictably, the "science" won't be taken as fact unless Biden wins
What? I'm saying it will cease to be a story if Biden is elected
The irony is both of those are going to disappear if Biden winsBiden has to go virtual. If not in a que card he loses it. He is senile
No. If mail-in voting actually works and doesn't result in massive election fraud, the next thing we're going to see is in-home artificial insemination kits. Of course, if the Democrats win, those kits will contain Joe Biden's sperm.
ur right nobody said that either of them were good people but at least biden has taken leadership and has beliefs. just because you are privlaged does not mean that you are the only on in the world luv❤️
Which one of these ladies is gonna outlive Trump and Biden
They only worry about that when there is a Black person in the White House. So, if Biden/Harris win, they will suddenly appear and be super vocal again.
I sincerely hope Biden insists on debating Trump in person and when time comes to shake hands I hope he kisses the bastard.  We need to step up to this, the fight of our lives.
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign raised $48 million in the 48 hours after he selected...
True but in no way ever should trump do a virtual debate. That eould be a massive biden win.
Honestly i will sit out on this one, Doesn’t really matter who wins india should have a good relationship. Modi made a serious diplomatic mistake by telling people to suppot Trump, while Many Indian diaspora support Biden and Kamala and majority of people of color in this country
Nope! If Trump wins they’ll claim fraud with mail-in ballots and if Biden wins they’ll claim fraud with mail-in ballots. Inevitably Stacey Abrams will emerge from the fog as the *actual* victor 😂
Seniors in Florida polling for Biden.
Joe’s gonna wipe up the place with you. Biden = bye-Don #slurringdon

I'm glad that Susan Rice won't be VP.  I wish I knew that she won't have another job in the potential Biden administration.
Biden can refuse debates but i dont see how it wont hurt him given he can go to funerals and do events with media present.  Than say no i cant debate in a room with10 people? If thats the case he better stay in his basement from now on or he looks likees a total coward.
More than Biden can say: that asshole can’t even take one question from the press!
More than biden and kamalhoe had.
Just look at a biden rally.
"We" created 90 % of the problems since 1980 in an effort to solve some other problems, and generally made things worse. Law of unintended consequences. The best laid plans of mice and men. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Biden, Harris, and Klobouchar meant well
No he wasn’t.  40,000 entered the US from China after his failed ban. It took him 75 days to do anything.  VP Biden said, shut it down and wear masks in January.   Trump disregarded the pandemic response plan, gave 16 tons of PPE to China in early January.
Lol some people aren't on the left. Last time I checked it's a group of Republicans forming together to vote for Biden and get Trump out for good. So what do you call them?? I'll wait.
Ask Biden for a comment hidden in his basement.
What an absolutely false story. What did Biden have to say?  Oh that’s right, we can’t hear him through the basement walls.
Here to say that the cookie poll had Biden in the lead.
Obama Biden White House was the most corrupt administration in our history.
The GOP is for pardoning wrongly pilloried whistleblowers that were appallingly driven from their home country. Yeah, and Joe Biden is for medicare-for-all
The good news for Peterson, is that 2020 *right now* looks like a year more resembling 2018 and Biden is likely to perform more along the lines of Walz or Smith in the 7th as opposed to Clinton's 2016 performance. Over-performing Biden by 15-20 is doable, by 30+ may not be.
Always hot air with no action. Your buddy Carolyn Maloney has a meeting with the scuz Dejoy on Sept 17!! That'll get the job done!! If you guys had an ounce of fight in you, you might win a battle. I'm voting Biden because Trump. That's it.
Agree, and just like Trumpkins would if it were Biden’s brother.

Correct! And using Twitter which is a form of socialism. Makes you, me, Trump, Biden and everyone that uses Twitter a socialist. Praise socialism!
Why does this dog remind me of Biden
Yeah.....that's Joe Biden....what's your point, troll?
This video is from the BLM protest outside the head of the Minneapolis police union. The poor people this dickhead was yelling at were his neighbors. Just unreal. A vote for Biden is a vote for more of this. They will come to ur neighborhood next.
And don't get it twisted... We. Can't. Wait.  I'm giddy at the prospect of President Dumbfuck debating Biden.  It's not gonna go the way you think, bud.
she just mad that Kamala got picked over her for Biden’s VP spot loooooooooool
Truth. It’s unfortunate because I don’t think Biden is a great choice. But holy fucknuggets just look at the Orange DICKtator is office.
What am I gonna do at the ballot on Nov 3? I’m gonna take a look at it and vote for Biden.
The docile media that will vote 99.998877 percent for Joe Biden their Lord and Savior who will save them from the fiery hell where Trump lives.
That’s the first positive thing I’ve heard about Joe Biden. Passing the public option would be a disaster &amp; when it fails, nobody will ever be able to pass M4A-citing the public option failure.
Biden can do 50 people events but not debate in a room with 10 people? Trump would be a fool to agree to that. A total fool. But i dont think trump is a fool.
a dude in a vote mask AND a biden shirt. guess i'm convinced now!
Two campaign trails emerge in 2020: The Biden campaign goes virtual in Minnesota, while Trump campaign continues in person.
This is where Biden/Harris should campaign. Just go to all these weird buildings.
No Biden’s. It’s very obvious he has a problem. And shame in his family to put him through this.
Really... are you that dense to see Biden has dementia???
Biden’s overuse of adverbs is honestly so offputting. If I have to read “badly” or “deeply” one more time in a statement
Who does he want us to vote for then? I mean, we don’t know if Biden will reduce or stop bombing. We DO know Trump increased it.🤷‍♂️
So...did Trump stop bombings? I mean, I agree it would be great if a vote for Biden would end bombing other countries. But even if he cannot promise that? Right now I have to consider what is going on in my country. With the wanna be fascist. 🤷‍♂️
Trump's virus plan utilized the wonderdul concept called Federalism: let states decide. Democrats, always in love with massive influence by the federal govt, wants to issue orders like a King.  Never ever ever vote for a Democrat
Its over,  Biden is President.  We can just skip voting. The Swifties have been engaged.
Joe Biden, through his support of the “postal accountability and enhancement act “, is just as responsible as Trump for the destruction of the USPS  Privatization of public goods is a pillar of the bipartisan consensus   More info on the
Not gonna happen, but it would be very funny if enough Biden delegates failed to submit their convention ballots for lack of enthusiasm, or unfamiliarity with PDFs.
Biden faces a convention test, to offer a vision beyond beating Trump
THANK YOU!!!
It's 2020 and Biden has no problem calling out and condemning racism and white supremacy. President Pussy Grabber can't bc he doesn't want to lose his racist base. If you admit racism is an issue and don't feel compelled to do something about it, then you're part of the problem.
Biden is going to have to campaign in **New York** to keep Trump from flipping it. That tells me every “Swing state” is already solid Trump. As long as people show up on November 3rd &amp; don’t take my bold predictions for granted, Biden is not going to win.
Your cult leader is a 4x draft dodger but Biden is a coward?  Lmaoooooooo
Trump is asked about the dumb citizenship thing w/Harris. He say's he just heard about it, he didn't know, WOULD NOT be looking into it. So 'I don't care' Framed as he brought it up &amp; that he's trying to push the rumor. Pathetic Biden doesn't need to campaign, media does for him.
We knew exactly what Biden was at the time - a bone tossed to older white folks. We also knew what he'd done and hated it but figured it was a harmless place for him to retire.  Clearly we were wrong.

Nominations for Biden's first actions as president  1. Begin releasing caged children at our border and connect them to their parents. 2. Stop the war in Yemen that is killing so many innocents incl children  3. Restore USPS 4. REVOKE ALL Trump's EO's You?

If they think it's bad for Biden to vote 'yes', (which I can't verify yet) then it's bad for Sanders to do so, too.  If they bring it up, direct them to his vote.
Trump has the Soldiers and the Cops!  Democrats have the Looters and the Russian Bots!
Hmmm, Biden says wear masks for three months. About election time I think, hmmm
His response to COVID could’ve been better? I’v heard Biden ride his ass about how terrible his response has been. In Jan. when Trump banned travel to/from China all Biden did was bitch about how racist it was. I’ve yet to hear what he would’ve done differently other mask mandate
Even a mannequin is progressive next to Trump, or the Trump Republicans.  The Biden/Harris ticket has moved further to the left because of progressive input and I expect them to listen even more to all voices.
The votes are recorded at the link below.  Biden isn't on it but scroll down to VT and see Sanders' 'Yes' vote.  Don't let the bros gaslight even more.
Bros are trying to diss Biden by saying he voted for the USPS pre-funding mandate, which was part of H.R.6407 - Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act in 2005-06.  The vote was pretty much unanimous and bipartisan.  I can't find anything about Biden's vote.  Sanders voted aye.
I guarantee you Obama never got these watercraft numbers. I never saw yachts for Hillary or canoes for Biden
Trump has already done things this is not something Biden has actually done.  I asked what HAS he done not what he says he will do.  You didn't answer the question   What has Biden done legislatively for black education in the past 40 years?
You didn't answer the question   What has Biden done legislatively for black education in the past 40 years?
Trump said it would happen. #Democrats planned to steal the election all along. Biden isn't running. Kamala is just outright lying, so it makes sense.
Interesting. If Biden is elected he will have a problem with China because they own him, having financed his brother, other family members business ventures, so it would put China right back in control and America would be at their mercy once again.
No I was trying to find the best way to get this conversation back on topic after you derailed it.  You didn't answer the question. What has Biden done legislatively for black education in the past 40 years?
#EricTrump calls on dopey #JoeBiden to answer for 'very discriminatory' process of picking running mate
No, you used something irrelevant as an excuse to detail the conversation   Now back to my question.  What has Biden done legislatively for black communities in the past 40 years?
Biden's foreign policy platform actually makes the claim that "the world does not organize itself". Messed up on many levels.
I did a 2 year comparison on black education as a way to show Biden has done nothing and you took it as a chance to deflect to comparing Obama and Trump. You were the one who mentioned economy first.  You brought are the one who derailed the entire conversation   I baited you

Childish,petty, and Trump is trying to intimidate!  He’s picked the wrong person to mess with!  Joe Biden will put Trump in his place and do so with pure class!
I'm just wondering why the press hasn't got to ask one question of Biden yet?
Hey Jim, Biden hasn't taken one question from the press. Are you going to start shouting questions at him?
On a 3,000 mile trip from Mn to Yellowstone thru Montana returned thru Wyoming - I saw one Biden sign.
Your strong desire to put Biden in spotlight and everyone’s inability to control the “best brain- stable genius” from saying the most god awful un American things, is so pathetic. You will be remembered as a hack partisan for a failed and treacherous president.
Since Donny doesn’t actually answer questions, he just spews garbage and misleading info and outright lies. So comparison is invalid.  You must really be able to see that trump is not electable.  The election isn’t about Biden, it’s about trump and the future of democracy.
Time for a national Biden ad on this ASAP.
Great Biden endorsement right there
And just like that, another Biden/Harris campaign ad was born.
What will trend when Biden destroys Trump and his chinless army of MAGA incels? #BooHooCracker
Why do you want Biden who was the vice president involved with the policy that caused our costs to skyrocket?
oh and look according to a black college source Trump is doing more for black education than Obama  What has Biden done legislatively for black education in the past 40 years?
Newt honey, you know Joe Biden is Catholic.  And he actually attends church.  As well he didn't bang his mistress before his wife died.  So I am thinking, no, just no.
Exactly, he didn't.  And yet you trust him as somebody who will actually do something.  No wonder Demokkkrats feel so entitled to the black vote Biden can say things like of you don't support him "you ain't black"
Hey Joe? (China) Yes? (Biden). I will trade you one dollar for five. Okay. Lol
this range of debate is a big step forward and market signal!  "She also favors a ban on fracking, a position that could put her at odds with Mr. Biden, who has called for a ban on new leases on federal lands but stopped short of calling for a comprehensive ban."
And yet basement Biden wants them to be controlled as they were in any other area in the county.
Biden didnt draft the fair sentencing act nor was it his legislature. Also the fair sentencing act did nothing to release.  You didn't answer the question. Why didn't Biden do his job and draft legislature to free the people mass incarcerated by his bill?

I sure do. Biden warned the country in January. "Trump is worst possible leader to deal with coronavirus outbreak"
Trump does nothing but lie and gaslight.  Why do you still report every word he speaks?   "Trump says Biden is a horse" "Harris isn't American" Why even show up at his events?
Biden has been an elected official for 16 years after his crime bill, why hasn't he done his job and drafted legislature to free the black men his bill mass incarcerated?

If we live under a dictatorship there won’t be protests or free speech. My great great grandparents left Germany in the 1800’s to escape their government - they left everything behind to be free
Warren used the goodwill built with Biden by not endorsing Bernie to get some of her biggest platform points adopted by Biden. She was arguably the runner up for VP and she’s widely touted as the Party’s policy mind. I will just never understand these paramecium-brained takes.
Guys, let’s hope he makes the ballot in all swing states .  He will hurt Trump more than Biden.  Both of them are competeing for the same idiots...  Let them struggle with this epic choice of which of these fools to support...

Nope. I'm waiting because if Biden wins, the street prices go up.
ok so guys the plan is to pressure biden to the left. but you can't say or do anything to pressure him to the left. tres gauche.
I wonder if we  are putting too much weight on our enthusiasm lead. My wife knows karens who dont like biden but are still voting strickly based on trump hate. Maybe it really doesnt mean much.
For sure nothing will change if we give up. I have faith that he will be thrown out of office, and Biden will be the next president.

Oh so him naming a woman that mass incarcerated black Americans for weed yet laughed about smoking doesn't lose your vote?  How about Biden drafting the 94 crime bill which contributed to the mass incarcerations of thousands of black Americans.? Oh by the way he defends that bill
Had your party not screwed Yang I would have voted for them.  Instead it chose Biden who drafts mass incarceration policy and Kamala who mass incarcerates black Americans.  I'm gonna vote Kanye to screw the Dems without voting for Trump.
Trump's an idiot but I'm not voting for Biden/Harris. Biden drafted the mass incarceration policies of 94 and Harris mass incarcerated black Americans for weed. So honestly I just wanna screw them over.  I'll vote for Kanye to screw Biden without voting for Trump

The interesting thing about how the Trump Camp is pushing Kanye is their assumption that 2020 will be another nail bitter in the EC. I guess that's possible, but it's also quite possible Biden will just bulldoze them.
Great pic for Biden campaign.
No, we don’t; but we’re in shock. We’re not used to this. We need to wake up. History is the bell to ring for this purpose. I ring it with all my strength. Wake up, America. It is high noon. Wake up, Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer. We are beyond polite politics. We are in crisis.

Far too many of them supported and voted for it (including Joe Biden)!

70% of registered voters want a universal healthcare. If Biden wants to win, he knows what to add to his platform.
Your wife is performing a public service. You've heard of the strategic stockpiles - the ones that Obama supposedly left without any ventilators or cures for Covid-19 (which hadn't occurred yet).   She's stockpiling butter for when Biden-Harris outlaw cows (which Pence claims).
I would prefer you call him President Biden!

The jaded Bernie bro types would have us believe the ‘evil DNC’ twice stopped Bernie from earning critical African American support in a Democratic primary. That failing is NOT Hillary’s fault, nor Joe Biden’s (nor Elizabeth Warren’s). Bernie can look in a mirror.
Warren has “earned” a place in Biden’s Cabinet. It’s not like  didn’t share her plans on “structural change” policies Biden has put forward. Why do women have to “earn their place” when most of what men do is play w/ themselves to earn it. Try giving birth. That’s work.
While you sit &amp; let Trump destroy the USPS to cheat in the Election. The reason Biden will be POTUS is because he is NOT a cruel racist misogynist &amp; alleged sexual predator/rapist trying to destroy our Constitution, the rule of law and our economy. 😊

Exactly.. and Joe Biden wrote this in January: Trump is worst possible leader to deal with coronavirus outbreak
It doesn't sound good to me.  Biden drafted the 94 crime bill which contributed to the mass incarcerations of many black Americans. Kamala Harris was a prosecutor who incarcerated black Americans for weed.  Sorry, I can't get behind that.  Oh and btw Trump sucks too.
2. He ended up deciding that ending slavery was the best way to do that, but that was not his goal. Biden will face exactly the same kinds of questions, and it will consume his presidency, if he gets one. But Trump and QAnon are not institutions (yet). They cannot be “abolished.”
our problem is that Biden, Trump, and Harris all serve the same interests
Did the Biden campaign write this?
WELL, HOPEFULLY IT WON'T BE THAT HARD TO VOTE FOR  BIDEN/HARRIS.       BUT IF trump GETS HIS WAY WHO KNOWS WHAT THE HELL HE WILL DO?      MIGHT BUILD WALLS AROUND POLLING PLACES     LIKE ADOLPH trump MIGHT STATION MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PRIVATE GESTAPO/SS ARMY OUTSIDE POLLING PLACES.
Great article. Trump and his handlers at Fox "News" are viciously launching racist attacks on Kamala Harris. The primary effect of these attacks seems to be increasing support for the Biden/Harris ticket.
What I love is I'm not voting for either candidate.  Trump's an idiot but Biden and Harris are mass incarcerators. I hate mass incarcerators.  So either I will vote for Kanye or if he's not on the ballot, I'll vote for Trump.
The republicans suck but I can't vote for Biden and Harris. The mass incarceration history is the dealbreaker.  I dislike the republicans but I hate the Demokkkrats at this point.  So I'm gonna vote for Kanye to screw Biden. If he drops out I'm voting Trump
The editor's note says Trump did (and is doing) exactly as Biden said he would. Making that headline the focus of the tweet when the real info is that Biden was right does us all a disservice by burying the lead.
The man lies so much you have to dig into the deeper context yourself, and any way you slice it, if you cut entitlements, that includes social security. Biden and Kamala are not wrong here. Stop getting sucked in by Trump's constant deception.
3. But only a root and branch purging of the GOP can forestall it. Biden can’t do that single-handedly. I wonder if even McConnell and House minority leadership could, at this point. If it is beyond them.  “The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.”
Beats anything Trump or Biden are offering. You have my vote!

My Senator Tina Smith, and the woman I voted for in the presidential primary! A great pair. And of course, I’ll be voting Biden/ Harris in the general election too. You’re awesome!
2. This is the unspoken dark subtext of a victorious Biden campaign, that perhaps only the Lincoln Project people are paying attention to. Biden seems to suggest that winning solves everything. It is clear, it does not. Georgia is only the most prominent example.
I have more confidence in mail in ballot than voting machines. I am returning my ballot in person to the country office in Sept. I live in MN, &amp; I believe we are in for a rough fall/winter. #PleaseDontSitThis1Out we need to vote him out, &amp; have a historic vote  #Biden
lol the whole point is that they’re republicans who realize how important electing Biden is...??? so yeah, they’re literal republicans?

There are no standards for trump. Until there are, im fine with biden doing whatever he wants.  In tired of the dems always having to play by the rules while Republicans do the exact opposite
Joe Biden only serves the interests of wealthy capitalists.
It's higher than 2/3rds. The fact images being shown as what America will be like under Biden are actually America under TRUMP makes almost everything else complete BS.
Biden and Harris are going to win. I wish we could just skip the madness of the next 2.5 months and get on with it.
Once again Republican states. Buy the votes if you have to.. Anything to stay in office. I hope you have to escorted out. I also hope you have long life that you get to spend in front of a camera in a jail cell as they monitor you. #Biden  #TrumpVirus
Trump isn't the cause of our slow journey into fascism. Deteriorating material conditions for an increasing amount of people are. A consolidation of state power by corporate interests is. Massive wealth inequality is. Democratic leadership has helped create this world. Biden too.
...isn't going to end, at least not because Trump. In summary: if Biden wins, boring. If Trump wins: neverending roller coaster of excitement. 5/5
I'm going to admit something that might make me seen like a psychopath. I kinda want Trump to win. Not because I like him or anything. Definitely not enough to vote for him. Just for the entertainment value. If Biden wins, the Republicans will... 1/x
"Trump is a fascist so we must vote him out!"  Implies that Biden, an authoritarian that would assume office during a time of capitalist crisis, would not be one.   Fascism is a response to socioeconomic facts, not just a quality of individuals.
This alone is why we vote for Biden.
Dispel with notions that either branch of the neoliberal government will reduce harm. Being blinded by the idea that this current admin isnt simply an extension of the last, and biden wont be an extension of this one is some serious lib shit.
Joe Biden? If you don’t vote for me you ain’t black? Black kids are as smart as white kids?
no, I had one feeling sorry for Biden when she learned about his family tragedies ... "i didn't know that."
WE can admit when people on our side fuck up. Yes, Biden is a racist old man. Just like Trump is!  The problem is you Trump worshippers never call Trump out when he fucks up. Maybe it's because it happens so much that you can't decide which one to choose?
That’s how we Dems know Joe Biden made the right choice.
I agree, but would this be your position if they endorsed Biden?
Any person with even a little sense knows this is stupid. You said all the same things when Obama got elected. Biden is a typical Democrat. He's not going to make any major changes.The fact that you're using hyperbolic hysteria is very telling. You're afraid Trump can't win again
I agree. Its systemic. Trump is just the a very deadly symptom, amongst other deadly symptoms. I just hope people don't stop protesting if Biden does win.
Yeah I'm using my vote on the black candidate with the most pro black platform. Even though Kanye won't win I hope he screws Biden over

She's not running with Sanders she's running with Biden 😆 I thought that was going to be a surprise to the reporter at first. 🙄😬 My undergrad is in journalism, reporters👏🏻your👏🏻homework👏🏻!
The argument is that trump is an existential fascist threat  Joe biden worked to corner and smoke out a whistleblower for revealing the fashy stuff the obama admin was doing   Biden is not harm reduction
I prefer #BidenHarris in the White House. #Biden will bring back some peace of mind for many. Every morning I wake up wondering what did you do overnight, who did you pick a fight with? Keep this in mind, when you go to prison don't pick any fights. #BidenHarris  #Biden
Understanding “what is going on” is not a difficult ask. Neither Biden nor Harris is capable and their handlers and complicit media will do everything to hide that fact.
Agree in principle about off-shoring. OTOH with Biden at least we'd still have a democracy, so I think I'll vote for that. Should have used your checks &amp; balances power to rein in the authoritarian impulses of your glorious leader when you had the chance.
Why should Biden be pressed harder than Trump? The WH press is like a puddle at his feet

No wonder democrats want more money for their #VoterFraud. #Biden is endorsed by #USPS
Oh yes I do. If I didn't exist the Demokkkrat party wouldn't be so upset about people either voting 3rd party or refusing to vote. I will vote however I can to screw Biden over.
In 2019 “Kanye on the ballot is the plan to draw votes away from Biden”.  “GTFO, Biden, Kanye?  You on crack.”  In 2020?
I’m assuming you are savy enough to understand politics is politics.  I’m sure Sanders thought RCV would benefit him, it likely would.  If it benefited Biden,he probably would have supported it.  In Mpls we had to force the change. you want it nationally?  Make it happen
If Kanye drops out I'm voting for Trump   I don't support Trump but I'll do whatever I can to screw Biden over.
It's 2020. Biden has no problem condemning racism and white supremacy. tRump just pretends that he doesn't see a problem or says there are "fine people on both sides", or posts racist dog whistle tweets to his right wing, racist base. But hey, if you like that then vote GOP ✌
Biden cant beat trump. He will never be elected
I'm sick of black Americans still having to feel the effects of Bidens 94 mass incarceration bill.  Trump sucks but nowhere near as bad as Biden.  I'm not voting for either candidate, I'm voting for Kanye West
Biden and his supporters when you ask what his policies are
The Biden-Harris ticket would cuddle Iran and allow it to fully arm.
Kamala incarcerated black Americans for weed and joked about how she smoked weed. She's a racist shit just like Biden.  I'm not voting Trump or Demokkkrat. If either party wants my vote, have a pro black platform  Kanye is my protest vote and I hope he costs Biden the election.
Biden and Harris are coming after your guns.
Look at every democratic run state and city. Like what you see?  If Biden and Harris get in that is America.
So then why are all the Biden people trying to skip out on the debates? Face the music, Biden is senile, will be embarrassed within the first 10 minutes.
Biden and Harris well one is old and has dementia and they other is a liar.  Both are evil.
It's So FUN to be constantly oscillating between voting for Joe Biden to be a "good" person and being an actual good person.

What Trump is doing is pure evil and corrupt. But what are Biden and the Democrats doing to counteract it? Making quippy backhand remarks on Twitter and saying “That will show him.”

Yes. That is precisely what happened. And it wasn’t Biden alone but a whole diplomatic team.

How many questions did Biden answer this week?
Are you shocked? One side is calling for them to be defunded, they have lively hoods. Let me guess USPS is supporting Biden. This narrative is tired.
Just be honest for fucks sake. Biden and Harris are trash and Trump is a bigger piece of trash, but everyone is trash. Stop pretending it's a fight between good and evil because it absolutely is not.
If you're going to use voting as harm reduction, the least you could do is also be honest about our choices. Yeah Biden has "only" sexually assaulted one woman as opposed to Trump's dozens of victims, BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM A GOOD MAN OR A GOOD CANDIDATE.
Pence did the same thing for trump. At least Biden has a woman.   Trump should try it.
I see nothing but crap on both sides.  Biden drafted policy that contributed to many mass incarcerated blacks. Kamala was a prosecutor who mass incarcerated black Americans for weed.  Trump sucks I'm not voting for him. I'm just gonna vote Kanye to screw the Dems.
Biden has dementia and a racist, authoritarian record. Harris is a tough-on-crime (except against cops) former prosecutor brought on the ticket at a time of unprecedented upheaval against a systemically flawed criminal justice system. Don't expect a #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
What did Biden do to fix any of this when it was happening under his and Obama's watch?
Why didn't Biden fight to get them closed when he was vice president to Obama?  He's the current Dem nominee
Im not even voting for Trump but I hope he wins. If the Demokkkrat party hadn't screwed Yang, maybe I'd support Biden   #Kanye2020
Won't happen. This is not a likeable woman. Biden is in the basement. Is this the best you can do? TRUMP2020 Landslide. Here we come
Blame MN AG, Gov &amp; Mayor for letting this start. Blame every leader who allowed un-quelled pandering for votes in massive destruction.  Blame CNN for sewing fake racism, social media, Disney, Soros, &amp; Clinton.  Strangely I don't blame Biden, he has no idea wtf is happening.
Racist comments aren't exclusive to Trump. According to Biden, black voters who don't support him "ain't black"  Biden still defends his mass incarceration policy.  What's worse. Trump's racist comments or Bidens mass incarcerations?
In case you're thinking of not voting for Biden. #SettleForBiden
This is so true
Just how many federal crimes can he be charged with by the Biden Administration?
It's funny how you are playing whataboutisms to try and deflect   Biden caused thousands upon thousands of black americans to be mass incarcerated and Harris incarcerated black Americans for weed.  Any whataboutisms you try to make are lesser, so give it up
And a vote for Biden is a vote for mass incarcerations of black Americans. Sorry can't do that one buddy
My favorite part of this will be watching Trump grift and pander to the left of Biden. Similar to 2016. And watching neoliberal Dems get overconfident and still not having fucking clue how to respond. Build. Back. Better. 🤦
You realize Kanye isn't gonna win and is only here to take votes from Biden?
I would walk through fire in my drawers to vote for Biden/Harris
Have a shot for us.
Joe Biden is straight out idiotic &amp; repulsive. #Trump2020  #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever
Biden train ad has me dying every time I watch it I can’t lie
Biden/Harris = Harris as President. Harris intends to pick Omar or AOC as vice. Squad takes over Whitehouse. Sneak attack on USA, backed by Dems. Biden not fit-they know. Back door takeovers are not free elections. #Operation25thAmend #CredibleElections #DomesticEnemyAwareness
the only earnest reason for Biden is that you won’t have to hear about him more than once a week. i’ve found any other argument falls on deaf ears for people who are justifiably politically disengaged
i do not trust joe biden.  and kamala ?? not a good candidate for america
Trump is destroying the United States Postal Service as we speak, trying to literally steal an election, but continue your biden outrage.
I like Biden, but I don't like him that much to do something like this. And to be honest, this is actually concerning.
Those that fight for the cause should show your support and give their house.  Practice what you preach.  It’s easy to tell everyone else.... but anyone voting for Biden... come on... give your house
For the most part the lockdowns are lifted.    Biden’s going to kick trumps ass.

Politics just got so much more sneaky in America... using Biden as a shield for the real presidential candidate is genius. On the right, strong candidate with weak vp on the left weak candidate with a strong strong vp
Finally asked how she could call Biden a racist on stage and now be on the same ticket, Kamala replies:  “It was a debate. A debate.”  “So you didn’t mean it?”  “Debate. Debate!” Amid strange laughs.  Exhibit 8B of why she was not a good choice for Biden.
But Biden/Harris calling for a national mask mandate is totally the authoritarian ticket in this election
Ok we get it Kamala Harris is a Narc. Her and Biden are a reunion tour of the crime bill. It sucks.....but let’s be real y’all stop playing and tell people to vote for them before we get stuck with homeboy again 🙄
My father was a Navy Vet of the Korean War. He and his group of Vets of the Local VFW all Trump voters. They were all Wartime Vets. Proud of their service, proud of their President who appreciates them and fights for their rights that the dirtbag Biden doesn’t care  1 bit about
i dont understand how people will "Hold his feet to the fire"  this entire election cycle has proven they can just do whatever, whenever and people will fall in line. a fucking cop as VP in 2020 and people are lapping it up. biden don't care what anybody thinks
What if after they were elected, Biden was unable, and then we find that Kamala is not legit... guess who gets to take over? Nazi Pelozi! It's an excellent eEeeEeEvil plan!
Cant help but think #Biden is the corp overlords, forcing ppl to work slave wages while #Kamala is the thin blue line, killing us telling us “im not gonna do something that only benefits black ppl” while #Trump is the feds, breaking laws/shredding civil rights  #FuckTheDuopoly
well, those challenges will take quite some time. good thing Biden and Harris will be the running the show in the meantime.

And you want big brother Biden (I couldn't pass on the alliteration) telling you how to think. You know, honored sir, we have more in common than what you may feel comfie with.
No, but I do think they seek power, and will do so within the Democratic Party if they can. And the Biden wing of the party may be too quick to welcome them.
Now we know why USPS is making headlines fueled by DNC. There is a vested interested in helping Biden win.
That Wallace/Trump interview was disastrous for Trump. Almost as bad as the one after that. Biden can just sit back and watch this clown self destruct.
Biden can’t be worse - Trump’s already proven he’s in way over his head and with disastrous results.

So since you don't think Biden can handle the situation, you can admit that you're not actually thinking of voting for him, right? You're saying that he's weak on crime and you wouldn't want a radical Democrat in the White House, right??
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are far from perfect but it is a vote to get trump out, secure RBG’s Supreme Court seat, and restore all minorities &amp; LGBT+ rights that have been demolished by trump supporters. It’s not about those 2, it’s about all of us saving our lives from trump
Chances that The Robert's Court will care about lawsuits brought that claim rulemaking is void since the acting heads are in violation: Zero, as long as Trump or other Republican is Potus. Chances that the Robert's Court would have different findings under Biden, Harris? Not zero

Do you losers get in a room to agree upon Obama/Biden/Comey cabal?
Does anyone else notice they aren't even trying to hide their lies and thievery?  Are we going to be able to try them when Biden is in? The insider trading from meetings prior to the #TrumpVirus, etc.
There's an organized group on here: Mangy Jay, Jeff Fecke, that Wilson Valdez account, etc. They have a DM or something and organize little micro-swarms in defense of Pelosi, Biden, etc. In their spare time they complain about Bernie and the Intercept a lot. It's a shtick
The argument is not Biden himself is going to save lives. The argument is that Trump’s and the goals of his party, are authored with the  explicit intent of harming a lot of vulnerable people. Of course work on the ground is most important. Trump is a deep impediment to that tho.
Biden has known her for years and he isn't a vindictive a-hole. He chose wisely.
Vote Biden.  We need to climb out of this pit.
There are a ton of them trolling Biden, acting as if they are concerned liberals.

Well biden has a pulse . Not much of one but it ticks a little
Will you effectively be President Mr./ Mrs. Biden’s twitter writer? You seem smart enough I suppose.
My thinking is informed by Joe Biden's record. His past performance.   I expect him to repeat the same policy preferences that minimizes us, and maximizes his big donor friends.
Or to put it another way, the case that the race could dramatically change due to a Biden scandal or some sort of decline in COVID was far stronger in May than it is two weeks before Labor Day (after which lots of voters will start paying much more attention)
Good summary of the reasons why Biden is likely to win (yes there is still time for things to change but time keeps ticking away)
Anyone who supports Biden is betraying the working poor. Because that is what biden did as senator and as VP.   Biden is a war-making, deregulator funded by the financial industry, who expanded unconstitutional executive power, wars, mass incarceration, fossil fuels and misery!
Biden’s response when his hidden ear piece malfunctions at the debates.
Again,  hilarious someone backing Trump tosses out sexual assault allegations as criticism of Biden.  Everyone’s seen the law suits  has been involved in and had to pay millions to make go away.  How can you point at Biden, yet support a man that’s much worse?
I'm am saying the donors of the common people is who I want my candidate influences by.   I'm saying who funds the campaign matters!  That exactly what im saying.   Joe biden is funded by vile corrupt people and he cares about them!
Again Biden was propped up by big donors, dark money, pacs, and super packs funded by the big donors.   He did not depend on small donors.  You are in serious denial.   Sanders depended on a million small dollar donors. Biden depended on the plutocracy.   It's not the same thing.
You are comparing the kind of influence our revolution has on Bernie Sanders to Biden's financial supporters and groups?   It's willful ignorance to suggest Biden's dark money donors are the same kind of people who donate to our revolution!
Just as it takes one hip hop star - suffering from mental illness - to sabotage the Black vote for Biden. Smh 🤦🏾‍♀️ 🤯
U seen Biden old ass 👀
Tr*mp supporters don’t know we are losing with biden because Bernie is the only change maker.  We are being considerate when they call us names and we do not call them names back. There is a reason to be angry with them though because he is so rude!
Okay it’s time we talk about how the FUCK did BIDEN and CLINTON get those nominations over BERNIE? Not even just looking at their political stances, but at their ACTUAL supporters. There has GOT TO BE people working actively against him being in office. Send tweet.
Biden supporters launched Dark money groups, I do over simplify Super Pacs into the dark money phrase.   It's willful ignorance on your part to not understand that how Joe funds his campaign, effects how he will govern.   Biden is a puppet to the big donors.  He served them!
My thoughts exactly, and this should be implemented day one of the Biden/Harris term
I can't wait to hear Biden pronounce Mykola Zlochevsky.
I’m white. I went to trade school. I’m voting for Biden. Also who are these people being polled? No one has ever asked me🤔
Go vote for the other Biden then, Jack!
The question is: will media allow Biden and Harris to continue not answering questions? You would think that some ethics might still be relevant for journalists - this far those seem to be lacking. A major party candidate has been in a hidey hole for 3 months and media takes it.
. wants to mandate every American wear masks OUTDOORS!   hasn’t required that (yet). So when will he denounce this authoritarianism from Biden/  When will the media ask  if she supports a federal mask mandate (that includes outdoors)?
Moreover they are extreme-right. E.g. Biden's closer to, say, Milton Friedman's views than the actual center.
Super Pacs funded by the financial industry. Are what I call dark money.  Sanders was largely funded by a million small donors. He did not depend on Super Pacs, or meet with big donors to reassure them "Nothing would fundamentally change".  I agree Biden didn't rely on grassroots
Alicia Mendoza, do you understand the difference between voting at the Democratic National Convention next week vs a vote in November General Election? Bernie wants his delegates next week to vote for for Bernie. Then he wants his supporters to vote for Biden in November!
What the fuck even was that conversation. She also had a totally incorrect timeline for when people were dropping out and endorsing Biden, and had totally the wrong idea about how people were doing in actual delegates and votes before that happened.
I agree Biden is not the choice if you want personal freedoms, but literally any mainstream candidate isn’t either. To enforce these laws they support massive police forces and funding and nobody wants it to stop since it’s lining there pockets 🤷🏼‍♂️
Me too.  I think Biden has been anal probed by many aliens
I am voting for Biden and Harris. I'm doing this without reservation. I will mark their names on the ballot gleefully and of my own sound mind. I totally and fully support them.  But goddammit, we missed an opportunity with Warren.
my problem with Biden is that he's too similar to Trump
The country in its current state existed before Trump and will continue exist with Biden.
Another disadvantage of tweeting under your real name: it’ll be easier for the #tRUmpstapo to find you.
She was an Attorney General that prosecuted violent criminals. How many violent criminals that Mike Pence put behind bars? Trump and his allies should just drop the anti-cop trope against Biden because it sounds freaking stupid at this point.  The anti-cop folks hate Harris BtW..
Again, without DARK money and a corrupt media propping up Joe Biden, he would not be the presumptive nominee.  Also, Biden was funded by the plutocracy, Sanders was funded by the people. I guess you can't tell the difference?
To clarify, I don't think Biden will "save" anything or anyone  But if he somehow doesn't ratfuck labor and delivers on his positions, he'll be giving us the tools to move past him
It sucks, and I'm never gonna do the whole Blue Vote Browbeat. But Biden at least has a few appeals to pro-labor policies as opposed to Trump trying to trample them, and I trust the ability of a union to throttle the economy more than any elected right now, so
I thought for sure you were JFK Jr.!
I had been expecting a major drop in the stock market as a result of congresse's stimulus failure. So far that hasn't happened. It could be that the markets are already anticipating Trump leaving office &amp; speculating on a more stabil &amp; predictable economy under Biden.

Friends, if Joe Biden was not propped up by dark money and a corrupt, corporate media, Bernie Sanders would likely win!
“In the context of Biden’s words, this is evident. Clearly some, including those without that context, have wrongly attributed Biden’s words to Johannes, and in doing so have attributed abhorrent and inaccurate motives to him.” 👍👍
Even Joe Biden has stated this won't be an easy transition. tRump's going to do all he can to lie &amp; cheat his way into staying #FakePresident. The only thing I see that will stop him is the continuation of his Impeachment, w honest members &amp; changing of laws. 😾😾😷
Thats great. The dems now Fascists won't be able to cheat. POTUS cares about this country and its not looking so good with an unlikeable wench and a biden that does not remember who his is running agaisnt. Tell the truth

I don’t even want to visit with my relatives who are conservative.. republican.. you know 😒 just saw a fb post “if you think Biden will change anything, you’re an idiot” from my fam so..just tired of it. Unfollowed.
Biden’s not the one taking cognitive testing. Who brags about remembering 5 words in a row?  It’s absolutely laughable.  You can make stuff up all you want about Biden...we’ve got the Truth to look at about  He thinks remembering 5 words is an accomplishment. Lol
Agreed. I think we all need to be careful about despair turning into inaction. There are LOTS of ways u can help with elections efforts (volunteering, donations, just texting the Biden supporters in your life) and your words may encourage others to dismiss this as “wasted time.”
(Also, people who would need to be shamed into voting for Biden are probably not following any of us on Twitter)
So You’re voting for Trump then because..... ? Kanye is a fuckin joke so you either swallow your pride and vote Biden or vote Trump to support hatred and racism
This Sedaris quote has been around since 2008. Let’s consider updating: Biden is the shit-glass; Trump is a bullet in your brain.  Analogies. You can do whatever you want with ‘em!
That "plan" also requires 2 more democratic presidents in succession following Biden to accomplish. We saw the damage Trump has done to healthcare in one term, yet you still want to take that risk on behalf of poor / underinsured Americans?

After 32 yrs of campaigning, donating, volunteering for Dems, I'm done. They pander to Republicans. They have PAC money from BUSH OFFICIALS (war criminals). These Repubs pushing for Biden want something in return and I'm not willing to go any further right to vote for them.
But she should really be addressed as Senator Harris, with respect. Until she’s Madame President, that is (I don’t see Biden finishing the term).
Unsure, but boy do people get mad when the left brings up Biden's decades of right wing policies or Kamala leaning into Tough On Crime
Biden was VP for the first Black president in American history. Obviously super racist lol
It's 2020 and Biden has no problem condemning racism and white supremacy. President Pussy Grabber just says there are fine people on both sides.
President Biden &amp; Vice President Harris 🇺🇸💙
You are actively doing the opposite of holding the moderates feet to the fire
Your president has officially declared war on the service which people I love rely on for political reasons. You have proven yourself loyal to Trump over American citizens who need support during a pandemic, and your kind have inspired me to devote myself to Biden’s campaign.
If you had told me in high school that I'd still be forced to listen to what Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and Marge Simpson think about things in my 40s, I would have paid more attention in science class and shot myself into the sun.
Biden is not in a position of authority to order anyone to do anything.  Just because he is running for president doesn’t give him any power to order everyone to wear masks until November 3rd.  I’m pretty sure its the exact date he’s going for.

I'm not convinced it matters if you admit you'll vote for Biden or not. They don't care about our votes. They don't want people like us to be anywhere near their party. Someone like Biden in particular will never genuinely move left on anything of significance.

It’s definitely important to identify and critique Biden/Harris *once we get them in office*. Right now those critiques are only serving to discount the campaign and give Trump leverage. Yes it’s a broken stupid system. We can’t fix it til we ax Don

Also, and I think this is important to note, there have only been four Boomer presidents -- Bill Clinton (born 1946), George W. Bush (1946), Barack Obama (1961), and Donald Trump (1946). Joe Biden is part of the Silent Generation.
Nah, he'll just use the Obama strategy and only hold pressers every 3 months.  But he handles the hostile media pretty well, and when he has a stroke it will be long after his second term.  Biden may have already had one.
Maybe Trump should adopt the Biden model:  only call on friendly press with pre-approved questions.  No, Trump is smart enough and courageous enough to take this shit from a hostile media on a daily basis.
I'd like to hear Biden answer ANY tough question.
Why, it's almost as if Biden's plan is really popular.
Most of the establishment democrats are in bed with pharmaceutical companies, including Joe Biden because he has been saying his whole political career he wants to cut Medicare and Medicaid and social security.
Love their claim that Biden can’t speak off script...do they just tune out all the things Trump has said off script?  Injecting bleach?  Attacks on every person who’s ever said a negative word about him?  Pandemic of NINETEEN SEVENTEEN?  Airport attacks during the revolution?
Politicians campaign where they have a chance of winning.  To do otherwise would be a waste of time and resources.  Do you think Biden will campaign in Alabama or Mississippi?  It's not a matter of caring.  It's a matter of getting to 270 electoral votes.
First, it's Aryan Nation.  Second, it's the democrats who founded the KKK and fought for segregation (Biden supported Ayran  views).  Third, the left has been screaming RACIST! at conservatives for decades as a political tactic.  Read Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals.
Biden is just politicizing this, he isn't actually thinking this is the right way to handle it.  No, we shouldn't mandate from the federal government.
Nobody cares what you believe you liar. Dems sure are worried about trump “not leaving after he loses”. Bet you anything the election will be contested due to mail in fraud, then they’ll just say enough is enough and try to put Biden in. Obviously they are planning on losing.
Wonders, since she’s Biden’s new assistant, if she’ll have to change his depends and wipe his ass..
I understand that POV, however, I think I’m just more optimistic. Parties move with public opinion, and public opinion on climate change action, health care, and other topics is shifting drastically. If Biden doesn’t act on his promises, I promise in 2024 I’ll be on your side.
Wonders, since she’s Biden’s new assistant, if she will have to change his depends and wipe his ass..
I personally think the way to go about it isn’t a hashtag that will fall off the trending tab by morning. I believe the way to do that is to get a man willing to change into office (Biden in this case), then use the power of our base to get change done.
Yeah but Biden can't survive 4 years of Biden.
The Trump administration got rid of a bloated team of bureaucrats, but once we knew that China and the WHO had been lying to us, in a week he put together a stronger team of medical professionals and dealt with the pandemic better than Hillary ever could.  Biden would be lost.
Nice try using the democrat talking points (aka Excuses).  Listen to Biden talk from 10 years ago and it is obvious he has lost it.  Even democrat leadership knows it. You can keep up the illusion, but only until the first debate.  Then it's GAME OVER.
Wonders since she’s become Biden’s assistant, if she will have to change his depends and wipe his ass..
All the Biden followers running to get a mask
Well, not all politicians are the same. Politicians are receptive to ideas which fit with their party. Biden was receptive to change in terms of Gay Marriage, Criminal Justice, Climate Change, and Health Care. Trump wouldn’t capitulate on any of those issues no matter what.

A smart candidate doesn't care about the popular vote.  It's the electoral college that determines the winner, and that made Trump brilliant and Hillary...home.   Trumps base will walk through fire to vote this time +12M, and probably more after reasonable dems hear Biden debate.
Not that arguing with a Karen will change your gullible little deranged mind.  But when Biden steps onto the debate stage with Trump it's GAME OVER.  Then your hate will really consume you.  Have fun screaming into your pillow on Nov 4th!

I listened to your podcast,which was  thing I believe is that we need to o encourage the Biden voters to vote early, whether by mail or in person.Then their votes will be counted earlier too.
I sure hope so too. I’ve met a couple of black dudes who are normally Democrat but voting for Jo in the elections. Honestly though black people my age or so don’t even like Biden. They realize that he is not here to help us at all.
But correct. Biden is still going to get the majority vote of 90%+ but may be a point or two lower because of Harris. Where that vote is going? I have no idea.
Veteran Republican strategist  disagreed.  "I think that messaging will work," he said. "Middle America -- the moderates and the indepdendents -- are certainly not looking for an adminstration that's going to be beholden to the far left."
Black people are most definitely voting for Biden in overwhelmingly high numbers. But, I don’t think it’s going to be a few percentage points lower than usual just because of Harris.
I can understand not wanting to vote for Biden/Harris if you dislike their records. But acting without a focus on the results may still result in harm, and your intentions will provide little solace to those harmed. Effects matter more than intention, IMO.

Biden is going to get way more votes, including way more mail-in votes, and then Trump is going to claim that makes the results rigged and illegitimate. Can we all acknowledge this now so no one claims to be surprised later? 1/2
Sorry, but Kamala nor Biden are transphobic, I’ve done extensive research on their lgbtq stances, and I can say with 100% certainty they will protect transgender rights and appoint Supreme Court justices which fight lgbtq discrimination
Yeah, that's the main thing. It's the default call, and we'll, that's Biden in a nutshell  I'm not thrilled but not worked up either
This is where we differ, because I’m a bit more optimistic. I’m hopeful that with a different cabinet, a president that is quite liberal compared to previous ones, and public pressure from BLM, we could actually see some change. And if they don’t, Biden will be gone in 4 years.

Tulsi Gabbert wipes her ass with Kamala Harris. Harris is a true leftist suck up and is poster child for drama and for nearly destroying a justice's life with spite. She is just as dangerous as Biden, And will destroy this country, Mark my words. Tulsi has more class any day.
Kamala as Biden’s VP won’t stop the fact that you have to, for as long as you live, live with the fact that you knowingly and willingly voted for a Racist Rapist.
Very on brand for Joe Biden to be holding his phone upside down. 🤣🤣🤣
Kamala Harris was the right pick for the Biden campaign. It’s the safe pick. They didn’t overthink it. I’m thrilled to see a woman and POC on this ticket. I’m also glad republicans can’t relitigate Benghazi/Tarmac/Hillary for the trillionth time if they’d picked Susan Rice. Happy
What an awful, awful choice by Biden. In a time where criminal justice reform is so important to our country..he picks one of the few people with a worse record on it then himself...Please, someone get me  to end this #kamalaharris garbage ASAP.
#VPPick Well, now the dems will at least win California.  LOL  Harris is the pit bull they need to fight the fights Biden can't handle, which is all of them.
One thing about the Harris pick is that Biden, like any competent politician, knows that a sharp attack in a debate is part of the game, and that you don't take it personally, *especially* when you're on the same team.
Gonna be hilarious when Biden posts [insert joke name here]. People will laugh and laugh. [NOTE: DO NOT POST THIS JOKE TEMPLATE WITHOUT REVISION.]
How nice for  to finally tell Joe Biden who his running mate will be! #BidenVP
Whatever happens, I’m voting Biden 2020. I’d rather vote for the dude who has a plan for supporting our transgender brethren than the dude who actively antagonizes them.
You misspelled Biden
Pence locked down conservatives.  Cheney &amp; Biden locked down experience.  Duckworth...national security?
Biden is the one I have heard say those dreadful words.
#BlackLivesMatter #antifa Joe Biden has been in office over 40 years. He was Vice President for eight years. Why didn’t he get rid of the “systemic racism” then, and why would he now? You are voting for Obama again but worse basically.
I though 2020 was racist. Now that you picked Biden’s VP for him as a woman, back to 2016 me too gender wars!? 😂 didn’t see this coming!
Just donated an extra 25$ to Biden’s campaign. Have a good night :)
Of course, one might not expect the candidate to appearing with Biden in the same place at all. Good ol' 2020.
Yea but these riots started under Obama same with the kids being in cages. Syria's civil war was also started under Obama's watch as well. Not to mention Joe Biden wants to defund social security, Medicare and medicaid the proof is in his entire political career. Look it up.
Biden-Buttigieg, the ticket everyone expected.
Joe Biden is such a racist that he doesn’t know when he’s making a racist statement..
24. #TrumpPressConference  Says China will own this country if Biden wins.
Do you have any evidence that Trump’s policy is better for the black population that Biden’s? Biden has dozens of pages of carefully thought out antiracist policies on his website. Trump has nothing I could find. Quotes don’t matter, policy and goals do.
Pocket change for the corrupt Biden's!
He’s more delusional then Joe Biden.
This letter doesn’t advocate for a particular Black woman. We are not interchangeable! Do I want to see Black women lead? YES! Do I want Black women in positions of power? YES! But this further tokenizes the Black women Biden IS considering.Its not the solidarity they think it is
I've long believed that Biden voters are more likely to vote. Nothing has changed my mind.
If the states are so independent, then I’m sure Biden would have no impact on the unrest if he was elected.
Donate to Biden campaign
Yup. Democrats are using social media and every other platform to censor and steer the election. That and including China and Iran with election interference helps them even more. Don’t forget Russia, they wanted Hillary and want Biden...
Waiting for Biden to announce his VP pick like...
Joe Biden has been saying he wants to defund social security, Medicare and Medicaid and disability his entire political career. So whats your point? How will things get any better with Joe Biden when he is just part of the problem? If you don't believe me do some research.
Lmao did you know that Joe Biden also wants to defund Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Yet you sheep still believe he will change our country for the better. Face it the two party system isn't working. Also the proof is in Joe Biden's entire political career.
Biden has no policy? Dude, check his website. He has hundreds of pages of plans and policies he would implement. I won’t continue arguing unless you can admit to basic truths of reality
Hopefully trump wins because if Joe Biden wins we will lose social security and Medicare and Medicaid because he wants to defund all 3 of them to pay for his illegal immigrants and their votes. The cartel problem will only get worse with a Democrat in office.
Whenever I hear someone calling Biden a racist, it’s always because he said something stupid. He isn’t a good speaker, and he has a stutter; however, those embarrassing moments don’t define his worldview. You’re waist deep in the water and acting like you’ve explored the ocean.
This is exactly what I’m talking about. Have you ever looked at Biden’s policy? Have you ever listened to what he wants to do without looking through a tinted lens? Have you stopped looking at the juicy snippets and looked into his current states beliefs?
Joe Biden is more corrupted than Trump will ever be. He also wants to defund social security and Medicare and Medicaid. He has been saying that for most of his political career.
Y’all talk about his deep past, but never about his recent history with racial ideologies. I wonder why I’ve never seen a Trump supporter judge Biden’s policy 🤔
Joe Biden is unfit and a terrible canidate for president.  Change my mind, oh, and you can't use the word Trump
He doesn’t have to accept the results, like we give a damn, but he WILL HAVE TO GET HIS BIG ASS UP OUT OF THE PEOPLES HOUSE! President Biden already confirmed after his inauguration the IDIOT would be drug out the WH kicking and screaming like the coward he is if he try’s that BS
Biden won't be their candidate come election time anyway.
You must have mistaken Trump for Biden.  Where’s Hunter?
Well since Biden is such a shoe in. There’s no need for the democrats to get out of their parents basement. They can just sleep in &amp; party on November 3rd..
Analysis | Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’
very sad that biden is the democratic nominee. we coulda had bernie
He better not. Voting will be easier here than in some other places and for every Minnesota farm with a Trump sign in the front yard, there are 10,000 residents in the Twin Cities who will vote Biden.
You know it. And expect them to refuse to cooperate in any way with a Biden administration.
That is just a little pocket change for the corrupt Biden family.
I can never understand what Biden is even trying to say, and the rate times I do it’s something stupid or racist 😂. If Biden talks he will lose basically, GW2.0
At that point, they move on to.... 🌹: Oh, well if Biden isn't going to give free college to everyone making any amount of money then HE MAY AS WELL NOT EVEN DO IT.
Here you go.
They can't. And if they can, Joe Biden can fund Medicare out of Defense, so good luck.
#IntelligenceReports So Russia is working against Biden. China is working against Trump. Guess which one Trump will do something about.
Top GOP senators give Trump the Biden probe he got impeached for trying to force on Ukraine #SmartNews
Well, I don’t love either; however, at least Biden actually has a solid written plan on issues such as LGBTQ rights, Climate Change, and improving health care to some degree. When we equate Biden with Trump, we accept them as equals, when one is clearly better.Biden is the most cowardly candidate for President that I've ever seen.
Didn't Biden's boss claim that we needed a 'magic wand' to bring manufacturing jobs back?
Take a Statistics class. I can guess that you're a Biden supporter, right?
Talking about any kind of norms and Trump in the same sentence is hysterical. We have spent almost 4 years saying “but precedent is “... then watched Trump blow all that up. So insisting Biden does something cuz Trump does? Hahahahaha!
Additional information on #KamalaHarris I hadn't been aware of. (There were so many candidates for Prez that I tuned out the entire campaign!)  Rep. Eric Swalwell: Kamala Harris will be a great VP and help Biden undo harm Trump has caused  #FoxNews
When will Biden show us his cognitive test results?
We didn’t have a free election in 2016-Obama/ Biden spied on the Trump campaign and you know it!!
Biden's not all there Taylor, come on man.
Something Biden is too afraid to do.
Can’t tell if she is worse than Biden or not
The Biden/Harris combo is a loser.
I read that Biden was trying to take credit for the Israel/UAE peace deal that Trump negotiated, Lmao
She seems to forget how corrupt the Biden's are: Where's Hunter?
You really are low life. How about you start with Obama and Biden and then work your way up.
Joe Biden-"I just voted to make gay marriage illegal"!
Hey, I just filled out my request for an absentee ballot so I can legitimately mail my vote in. You are a con artist Mr. Biden.
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He’s the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes     Democrats didn’t pick Mr. Biden because he’s moderate, they picked him because he’s weak
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
So Trump campaign tweeted out mugshots of black people out on bail to scare people as though Biden will be letting out every black person in prison to terrorize white folk.  How about tweeting out pics of Trump in prison stripes?  That's where he should be.

Vote for Biden &amp; Kamala Harris For sure better than TRUMPster fire
It turns out that "Dr." Jill Biden is NOT a medical doctor!
The process of how Biden arrived at selecting Kamala Harris. via
How can any Roman Catholic support Biden/Harris? Outrageous support for pro-abortion candidates!!
“It’s not about your rights, it’s about your responsibilities," Biden said.  Who’s up for a nationwide mask mandate #sunrisers?
If you notice your mail has been delivered later than usual, this is done on purpose to rig the election in favor of Trump and the GOP.  Don't vote for them, vote for Biden and democrats. More better if it is progressive democrats.
Voting for Biden sucks, not voting sucks, and voting for trump is not possible  No good choices 😔
Who does Biden think he is, he isn't part of the Govt and he isn't a doctor, he's garbage!
Biden/Harris campaign offices:
Biden's not all there, he's not playing with a full deck.
Admittedly an improvement for Biden in his raw number. That being said, Biden will win MN by more than he wins WI, I believe.
SO DID BIDEN!
They can criticize her all they want but unless they want four more years of #45 they had better vote Biden/Harris.
- The so called editorial written by John Eastman is a racist letter to those who think a woman of color, born in Oakland, CA is not eligible to run w Biden. I am deeply offended that you would allow this blatant birther piece in your mag. Disgusting #BoycottNewsweek
so what, Biden and Camela will lose, so who cares/
People that he is supposed to lead. I’ve never seen a president spend so much effort into trying to divide the American people and that’s why he needs to go. This isn’t about Joe Biden, this is about the fact that the orange Cheeto puff fuck ball needs to go.
Consensus-building and ability to find middle ground were killed off by gerrymandering and unlimited campaign contributions made through anonymous shell companies.  Be great if team Biden fixed that. But entrenched, self-serving GOP &amp; Dem partisans killed off earlier efforts.
Let's ignore him a lot from now in and concentrate on president Biden and Vice President Harris.
Who will be the actual power behind Biden/Harris really running the country? That’s the true info needed. Dr Jill Biden? Chief of Staff? These concerns make US look like a crummy  dictatorship. NOT WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR NATION.
Are you ok with the fact that Joe Biden voted to make gay marriage illegal?
Trust us-Pence has plenty of material to use against Kamala.  Between her and Joe Biden they sent tens of thousands of African American males to prison needlessly.  And I want to hear her defense of Joe Biden voting to make gay marriage illegal.
Pamala-Kamala Harris wants you to join The United States of California. No more America. Liberal Fascism (Socialism) will be your government. Welcome to The Fourth Reich founded by BLM and Antifa with Harris-Biden paving the way.

Y’all think it’s a coincidence Crime Bill Biden chose Mass Incarceration Kamala? Dems will tell you Trump is a racist but look at ticket’s track record. We are screwed.
Gosh, apparently Biden needed to seek advice from Trump: "Kamala Harris is the meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful, MOST LIBERAL of anyone in the U.S. Senate, and I cannot believe that Joe Biden would pick her as his running mate."  (Trump e-mail)
Nothing against Biden, but can she step in for one of the debates? Would love to see her destroy Trump face to face.
Look, I took some time to think about the argument and I realized that I misunderstood you. I may not agree with you on certain things and I think some of your comments toward Biden and Harris are unwarranted, but I jumped the gun and saw what I wanted to see.
I am wary about this - Biden respected a lot of others bedsides Warren - she was not a serious candidate as it needed to be a woman of color!!
The is a great speech!!  Take down the Orange man and building up America.  Biden/Harris 2020
My head just freaking exploded from Biden’s Lies!
Okay. So when Joe has to resign in 18 months due to mental health concerns, Kamala Harris will be President. In other words, Kamala Obama. I suppose China will love her as much as Joe Biden. She will be a good puppet for Leftist Elites (Globalists).
Good thing you like her since she’ll be POTUS. Biden won’t remember who she is by November.

Wow! I think we found Hunter Biden! I knew he had to surface sooner or later. #HunterBiden
There’s a lot of fundamentals (and 22% uncertainty) built in.  Someone else pointed out that as the election gets closer, if things remain the same, Biden’s chances will increase.  If that’s true, I can understand why the model is where it is right now.
You don’t even know how out of touch you are. You are the ugly past. Biden-Harris is the future.
So all Trump campaign has is name calling.  All they have otherwise they'd have to bash policies the majority of Americans favor.  Oh, so they'll go with extreme policies that Biden/Harris don't even believe in.  Name call &amp; scare ppl.  I'm going to hate the next 80+ days.

Biden won't be elected, Trump doesn't lose
Has Biden recently turned Catholic? I’m curious as to why it’s trending now when he’s probably been a catholic this whole time? It’s just political season so anything goes I guess, I’m surely excited to vote now. 😒
Think of it this way, Nate’s model has Biden winning 93% of the time if the election were held today, Elliot’s is at 88%.  Slight variation.
Here we go! So happy that VP Biden picked Kamala Harris! I am energized!
Joe Biden has a racism problem alright - but he's going to beat it in November.
Indeed. Biden is "American centre" in my opinion, which American left is basically actually centre, so things are all backwards ;-;
I want to start by saying I'm not for Biden/Harris  However, if it is just a comparison of "lesser of two evils", yea Biden/Harris is probably better than Trump/Pence. But we will still be in a shit place with Biden/Harris in place
A great and winning team Biden- Harris 2020!!
I am meh but still going to vote Biden
Biden isn't all there.
The Biden-Harris Ticket
If you are reading this  stay clear of Biden’s nursing home.  #CuomoKilledGrandma

Lots and lots of grandmas and grandpas.  Come to think of it Biden should be terrified around this crowd.      stay away from Joe’s nursing home dammit!!!!
Nice try, At least Trump has better taste  than Biden.  #TaraReade.  Yuck.  Biden should pay her btw .
Everyone, even Republicans, are getting sick of what the pandemic has done to them.  Trump's done nothing for them, but give them crumbs.  Vote for Biden for this madness to be better.  If you don't, I can assure you this will continue for even longer.

STRONG TICKET. I CANNOT BLV KANYE IS.STILL RUNNING, SAYING HE’L TAKE VOTES FROM BIDEN
Biden was a senator for a long time and is known as a super genial, get along guy. He’s going to want to work with the other side and make deals. What Trump should have done.
Ahole Chuck Todd did say something today that resonated with me. He said that Biden's pick of Harris also validated all the women who were considered for VP. A great day for women and for our nation.
Also, I think many of Biden's cabinet positions should be filled ASAP. Put a killer team together to take down Trump and begin the process of recreating the American Dream with decency and equality for everyone!
I guess she no longer believes Biden’s accusers
By the end of January with Biden/Harris there will be....for the good of the nation
All the Sander voters that vote Biden will get nothing they hoped for. This is all a set up from top Dems. You can bank that!
I never said I was for Trump? What I said is I thought Biden would pick Rice and the Dems would move Biden out and Harris would be VP. NOW I just say swap them around. I do like any one of these lady’s more than Biden. He will never make it through his 1st year.
democrats are so fucking stupid as usual.  I’ll vote for biden because he’s not trump- but kamala is hillary level bad.  idiots.

Kamala Harris chosen as the running mate. This is problematic given her voting record and it is not progressive ticket. via
Every time Trump or surrogate talks about Biden gaffes they should just play Trump talking about 1917 flu and it ended WW II.
Turned to Fox just to see what they were saying. Still trashing Biden so quickly switched to CNN. Where is Nicole Wallace? I wanted to see her today.
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's running mate: Live updates. Yes!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Biden made the right choice asking Harris to be his running mate. Her debates with Pence should be good.
Congratulations!!!  I am excited to vote for Biden/Harris!!!
Biden has picked Harris to be his VP. This ticket will be responsible for putting more black folks in chains than pre civil war
Biden/Harris 2020!  I'm feeling very positive! :)
Good Choice. Hopefully when Biden wins Sally Yates for AG and Susan Rice as SOS, have Schumer step aside and make Warren Senate Majority Leader. Let's put some women in charge for a change. It seems to work well in other countries.
Great pick!!!  Can't wait to vote for Biden/Harris!!!!!  #BlueWave
Biden-Harris for the win!!!??!
Biden picks Kamala Harris for VP running mate.  better get ready! #snl
Didn't Harris pretty much accuse Biden of being a racist at one of the Dem debates?
YES!! Joe Biden here. Big news: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate. Together, with you, we're going to beat Trump. #KamalaHarrisForVP
If the pick is truly in, Biden should make the announcement ASAP. The longer he waits, the greater the probability that the VP choice will be leaked.
Rice will make history 1st woman VP and President and wait! history yet again A WOMAN PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT RUNNING THE UNITED STATES. PRESIDENT RICE AND VP HARRIS. this is already the setup if Biden wins and the Dems will close there eyes to Biden family Ukraine deals.

A vote for Biden is a vote for PRESIDENT RICE and VP to be announced at later date maybe Harris. Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.
It's almost like Trump is trying lose by even more than he already is among female voters....
Rice would be the best pick for Biden. And Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.PRESIDENT RICE VP to be announced at later date maybe Harris

Her calling out biden was warranted. That’s the one good thing she did.
Well said. Biden has to pick a VP that will work with him, not the " most popular dance partner".
Just one of the reasons this #nurse is voting for #Biden in Novemember. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Trump doesn't lose, so whoever Biden picks as VP is irrelevant.
Children Are Not Immune
Umm that was Obama and Biden.
But if Biden picks the wrong VP, amiright?
Joe Biden as a Muppet? Now there’s an idea! Thank you Raymond Arroyo on Laura Ingraham. #FoxNews
Do his people really not tell him it’s 1918 not ‘17? Understand that happening one time. We all misspeak. But it’s every dang time. Biden makes an error and fixes it. This guy. Ugh. Is his staff so afraid of his wrath they’re willing to let him embarrass himself over and over?
He promised a woman. We’re getting a woman. Pete is trending because, I believe there was a chartered flight from South Bend to Biden’s regional airport (because, you know, #ElectionTwitter is 👀). Secretary of State offer?
It’s over for Biden.
Lol. Why are liberals so willing to believe anything.   Maybe it’s Putin flying in to conspire with Biden...oh wait, only an uneducated liberal would think that.
Can a reporter ask him where he went to church this weekend and tell him where Biden went?
If they continue to give Trump an hour everyday to basically give a campaign speech they need to give Biden equal time.  Trump just lies and nobody can correct him in realtime.
Donny says Biden will hurt god. Did I miss the part where Joe collected all the Infinity Stones?
Who cares if they can do the job.....just make sure it’s a soul sista! Biden is weak he will wilt I’m sure
The only man I would accept as Biden’s running mate tbh
I read someone’s comment that said he’s probably calling everyone in and giving them a face-to-face “Thanks for your participation. It’s not you” talk ..   Sounds like something Biden would do ...
The media is giving Biden a pass for his cognitive decline and his obvious racist point of view.
I DON'T CARE who it is. I'm voting Biden period full stop. Trump is a cancer that needs to go. ❤
Biden’s Choice
After the election the Covid hoax will end, and Biden and the DemocRATs will scamper back into their rat holes.
Biden and Trump are not the best our country has to offer.  There are other options and we NEED to acknowledge them to break this broken two-party system.  #LetHerSpeak
Biden sold our manufacturing to the Chinese, the same country that caused the DemocRATS to scare our country into shutting down!1
If you support Trump, please unfollow me. Seriously...I pointed out on a thread (on FB) about Biden having a stutter (aka a disability) and someone used the "laugh" emoji. Really??  REALLY?  Deplorable much?
So Biden comes out of his basement for church and grieving for those lost. Trump comes out of bunker for ego trips and golf. No brainer who the better man is here.
60-40 is actually really good for Democrats in Hartland (I know, I know...yard signs don’t translate to votes). Looks like Trump won 61-32 in ‘16. Honestly, I wouldn’t expect to see any Biden signs out there.
Ok this might be the level of tweet I can expect Biden to have actually sent
Biden takes orders from AOC, #PuppetJoe
Biden claims that Black people are all alike, just more proof that #RacistJoe is racist.
Biden and Obama raided Medicare to pay for a failed program called “Obamacare.” They cheated us! This program was supposed to bring down healthcare costs for all American citizens. That’s one of the most infamous lies of the century!
Trump sets the debate rules, not Biden.
I heard them dissecting Biden's gaffe. I had to shut it off. Yesterday, Trump said he created an executive order to force insurance to cover pre existing conditions; something the ACA already does, but they're focusing on a Biden misstatement, already explained &amp; apologized for.
I’d pay thousands of dollars for a front row seat at the Bible quiz contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump! 😂 #TrumpIsNotAChristian #TrumpIsDefinitelyNotEvangelical #SexWithPornStarsIsNotChristian
Joe Biden does not support defunding the  police you dummy
Here’s a new one. My niece said her FIL sent a message to my niece’s daughter, saying that if she voted for Biden, he’d disinherit her. She’ll be a first time voter. She told him to go ahead and do it! 🤣🥰 Proud of her!
“You’re not Black if you don’t vote for me.” I don’t know about anyone else, but I would never let Joe Biden define me no matter what color I am. A 47-year political failure like Joe “China” Biden, has no game whatsoever. Accept maybe making his family rich on taxpayer time.
Thank you.  I was just going to tweet how this is a further move to dictatorship if EO is allowed to go forward.  If, as I hope, Trump is not re-elected, Biden is going to have a real task in putting the Constitution back together from the shredder.
I never seen those quotes man. Guess I should've googled all the racist shit Biden spewed beforehand huh? My bad
😂😂😂😂😂 That’s super cute. You actually think Biden has any say in who he chooses.
What, you think Biden has a solution? Let's hear it!
Peter doocy will be VP running mate.  Biden-Doocy 2020.
Oh please! ODNI has identified Ukrainian Derkach as working with Russia to disrupt the election to elect Trump. You are accepting false information from Derkach to smear Biden in your Senate Committee. Not hard to figure out where you loyalties really lie.
Pray to God Joe Biden wins and we take back the Senate. We'll have to rebuild the State Department and our intelligence agencies. Who knows how many Russian assets are now in the CIA thanks to Trump?
Exactly. Most VP choices are announced just prior to the Convention.  This woman could be President at some point. If they go through rigorous vetting, all the better. A VP is a partner in governance. Regardless of our fave, Biden will need to work w her. It is his call.
Or China is backing up Dumpty's claim that a Biden win means being in cahoots with China, making Biden look corrupt. This is a Through The Looking Glass world now.
Biden isn’t gonna make it-stop obfuscating
This guy is going to make Biden seem out of it?
I know whatsboutism is a losing game, but my son and I were saying tonight: imagine if Trump had said one of the things about black people that Biden says regularly.  The media would 24/7 bear Trump to a pulp.
No cozy bear. It's quite alive and well.
To tell you the truth, I think that Biden is too far gone to win. My concern is losing the House and Senate.
Biden's plan is the Green New Deal, which is unacceptable, face it, Biden is a loser!
How insulting and condescending to #BlackLivesMatter that the GOP believes helping #Kanye get on ballots will lure black voters to vote for him instead of #Biden.  Act of desperation for sure.
If Twitter calls out fake information then why doesn’t this get flagged as a lie because Biden couldn’t possible send a tweet.  His handlers should have to admit authorship to make this a true tweet.Biden is the most cowardly candidate for President that I've ever seen.
Didn't Biden's boss claim that we needed a 'magic wand' to bring manufacturing jobs back?
Take a Statistics class. I can guess that you're a Biden supporter, right?
Talking about any kind of norms and Trump in the same sentence is hysterical. We have spent almost 4 years saying “but precedent is “... then watched Trump blow all that up. So insisting Biden does something cuz Trump does? Hahahahaha!
Additional information on #KamalaHarris I hadn't been aware of. (There were so many candidates for Prez that I tuned out the entire campaign!)  Rep. Eric Swalwell: Kamala Harris will be a great VP and help Biden undo harm Trump has caused  #FoxNews
When will Biden show us his cognitive test results?
We didn’t have a free election in 2016-Obama/ Biden spied on the Trump campaign and you know it!!
Biden's not all there Taylor, come on man.
Something Biden is too afraid to do.
I was so happy to read the National Association of Letter Carriers (a union that has over 300,000 members) has endorsed Biden\Harris!
Can’t tell if she is worse than Biden or not
The Biden/Harris combo is a loser.
I read that Biden was trying to take credit for the Israel/UAE peace deal that Trump negotiated, Lmao
She seems to forget how corrupt the Biden's are: Where's Hunter?
You really are low life. How about you start with Obama and Biden and then work your way up.
Joe Biden-"I just voted to make gay marriage illegal"!
Hey, I just filled out my request for an absentee ballot so I can legitimately mail my vote in. You are a con artist Mr. Biden.
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He’s the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes     Democrats didn’t pick Mr. Biden because he’s moderate, they picked him because he’s weak
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
So Trump campaign tweeted out mugshots of black people out on bail to scare people as though Biden will be letting out every black person in prison to terrorize white folk.  How about tweeting out pics of Trump in prison stripes?  That's where he should be.
Vote for Biden &amp; Kamala Harris For sure better than TRUMPster fire
It turns out that "Dr." Jill Biden is NOT a medical doctor!
How can any Roman Catholic support Biden/Harris? Outrageous support for pro-abortion candidates!!
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  vía
If you notice your mail has been delivered later than usual, this is done on purpose to rig the election in favor of Trump and the GOP.  Don't vote for them, vote for Biden and democrats. More better if it is progressive democrats.
Voting for Biden sucks, not voting sucks, and voting for trump is not possible  No good choices 😔
Who does Biden think he is, he isn't part of the Govt and he isn't a doctor, he's garbage!
Biden's not all there, he's not playing with a full deck.
SO DID BIDEN!
They can criticize her all they want but unless they want four more years of #45 they had better vote Biden/Harris.
so what, Biden and Camela will lose, so who cares/
People that he is supposed to lead. I’ve never seen a president spend so much effort into trying to divide the American people and that’s why he needs to go. This isn’t about Joe Biden, this is about the fact that the orange Cheeto puff fuck ball needs to go.
Consensus-building and ability to find middle ground were killed off by gerrymandering and unlimited campaign contributions made through anonymous shell companies.  Be great if team Biden fixed that. But entrenched, self-serving GOP &amp; Dem partisans killed off earlier efforts.
Who will be the actual power behind Biden/Harris really running the country? That’s the true info needed. Dr Jill Biden? Chief of Staff? These concerns make US look like a crummy  dictatorship. NOT WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR NATION.
Are you ok with the fact that Joe Biden voted to make gay marriage illegal?
Trust us-Pence has plenty of material to use against Kamala.  Between her and Joe Biden they sent tens of thousands of African American males to prison needlessly.  And I want to hear her defense of Joe Biden voting to make gay marriage illegal.
Biden names Kamala as his VP, now Black Americans are tweeting about how Obama didn't do anything for the black community!  Rest abeg
Pamala-Kamala Harris wants you to join The United States of California. No more America. Liberal Fascism (Socialism) will be your government. Welcome to The Fourth Reich founded by BLM and Antifa with Harris-Biden paving the way.
Indeed. Trump wants Biden to get out in public for his friends the Russians to assassinate him. He has been provoking him (basement attacks)

Y’all think it’s a coincidence Crime Bill Biden chose Mass Incarceration Kamala? Dems will tell you Trump is a racist but look at ticket’s track record. We are screwed.
Gosh, apparently Biden needed to seek advice from Trump: "Kamala Harris is the meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful, MOST LIBERAL of anyone in the U.S. Senate, and I cannot believe that Joe Biden would pick her as his running mate."  (Trump e-mail)
If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America
Joe Biden is a stanch Catholic. Educate yourself.
Nothing against Biden, but can she step in for one of the debates? Would love to see her destroy Trump face to face.
My head just freaking exploded from Biden’s Lies!
Okay. So when Joe has to resign in 18 months due to mental health concerns, Kamala Harris will be President. In other words, Kamala Obama. I suppose China will love her as much as Joe Biden. She will be a good puppet for Leftist Elites (Globalists).

If I were to vote it would be for Biden.  Trump is a liar and a divider.  So is Biden and he might be senile, so I might just be sitting this one out my Lloyd!!!  Minnesota will go blue I am pretty sure so I am just a human in this state
Indeed, Sad part about people saying vote for Biden is that they’re forced to say it because he’s the only other candidate to vote for lol we’re fucked either way. 😞
Politics are poisonous.   They will have you arguing with your friends and family over 2 candidates that don’t give 2 fucks about us. Ain’t that crazy? Poc are arguing over Trump and Biden... 🤦🏽‍♂️ so this where we at huh
The rioters, looters, and arsonists who are destroying our cities are Democrats, Biden supporters.

Wow! I think we found Hunter Biden! I knew he had to surface sooner or later. #HunterBiden
So all Trump campaign has is name calling.  All they have otherwise they'd have to bash policies the majority of Americans favor.  Oh, so they'll go with extreme policies that Biden/Harris don't even believe in.  Name call &amp; scare ppl.  I'm going to hate the next 80+ days.

Biden won't be elected, Trump doesn't lose
I am done responding. I'm sick of you trying to say "you think/do this horrible thing" when I clearly don't. I never said the fight ends when Biden is elected
no one in this convo is saying you should be grateful for the LGBTQ+ situation in the US right now. It's still bad. We're saying that it's better than it was 40 years ago and could get WORSE under Trump, while it won't under Biden
I simply think getting Trump out should be top priority. Then young people can start to put pressure on Biden and the Dem establishment
idk where in this argument you got the idea that this is "fun" for me? I'm sorry about the situation you're in. I understand that I have very little skin in the game (i'm a white guy). I just see what Trump is doing and know that four years of Biden would be not as bad
Has Biden recently turned Catholic? I’m curious as to why it’s trending now when he’s probably been a catholic this whole time? It’s just political season so anything goes I guess, I’m surely excited to vote now. 😒
And if Hillary had won in 2016 Biden probably wouldn't have felt the need to run this year. Good job!
i'd call "we need to elect Biden because Trump is worse" pragmatism
and mfers like you are the reason Trump won in 2016, no offense. Look at how all of you people abstaining did in the next election cycle. No more progressive but at least we have Biden!
In no way do I enjoy the fact that Biden is the nominee. I simply understand that 4 more years of Trump would be much worse than that of Biden
"Hey guys maybe we should finally let black people vote" is to the left of "Hey we need to break down systemic racism" I guess? And that's not Biden i'm quoting but the main line of the Democratic party, whether or not it's older members actually mean what they say
Joe Biden has a racism problem alright - but he's going to beat it in November.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Join Seniors for Biden” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
my point is that you're ignoring the actual difference in their political stances. Biden may very well be a rapist. It sucks that the Democrats forced him on us. But to say Biden as a presidential candidate and Trump as a presidential candidate are the same thing IS ridiculous
You're reaching Trump supporter levels of simplification here. I very much dislike Biden. I wish Bernie (or even Warren) was the nominee but to ignore all the differences between Biden and Trump's platform and just say they're both equal "racist rapists" is ridiculous
Indeed. Biden is "American centre" in my opinion, which American left is basically actually centre, so things are all backwards ;-;
I want to start by saying I'm not for Biden/Harris  However, if it is just a comparison of "lesser of two evils", yea Biden/Harris is probably better than Trump/Pence. But we will still be in a shit place with Biden/Harris in place
Biden isn't all there.
The Biden-Harris Ticket
Everyone, even Republicans, are getting sick of what the pandemic has done to them.  Trump's done nothing for them, but give them crumbs.  Vote for Biden for this madness to be better.  If you don't, I can assure you this will continue for even longer.
Who will BLM endorse  Biden and Harris both of whom increased incarceration of POC for low level crimes or Trump who pushed and signed criminal justice  reform..setting  thousands of those same people free?

And the Biden family too got rich, hmm hows Hunter and his crack pipe doin’ nowadays.
STRONG TICKET. I CANNOT BLV KANYE IS.STILL RUNNING, SAYING HE’L TAKE VOTES FROM BIDEN
Biden was a senator for a long time and is known as a super genial, get along guy. He’s going to want to work with the other side and make deals. What Trump should have done.
Ahole Chuck Todd did say something today that resonated with me. He said that Biden's pick of Harris also validated all the women who were considered for VP. A great day for women and for our nation.
is voting for joe Biden strictly for kampala Harris
Also, I think many of Biden's cabinet positions should be filled ASAP. Put a killer team together to take down Trump and begin the process of recreating the American Dream with decency and equality for everyone!
I guess she no longer believes Biden’s accusers
By the end of January with Biden/Harris there will be....for the good of the nation
All the Sander voters that vote Biden will get nothing they hoped for. This is all a set up from top Dems. You can bank that!
I never said I was for Trump? What I said is I thought Biden would pick Rice and the Dems would move Biden out and Harris would be VP. NOW I just say swap them around. I do like any one of these lady’s more than Biden. He will never make it through his 1st year.

Every time Trump or surrogate talks about Biden gaffes they should just play Trump talking about 1917 flu and it ended WW II.
The only presidential candidate we were ever globally comfortably voting for was Obama. Them days are over with. Don’t just expect poc to pick between biden &amp; trump, it’s all fucked up.
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's running mate: Live updates. Yes!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Congratulations!!!  I am excited to vote for Biden/Harris!!!
I really don’t like Biden or Kamala Harris but I hate trump lol
Biden has picked Harris to be his VP. This ticket will be responsible for putting more black folks in chains than pre civil war
Great pick!!!  Can't wait to vote for Biden/Harris!!!!!  #BlueWave
Biden-Harris for the win!!!??!
Biden picks Kamala Harris for VP running mate.  better get ready! #snl
Didn't Harris pretty much accuse Biden of being a racist at one of the Dem debates?
Rice will make history 1st woman VP and President and wait! history yet again A WOMAN PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT RUNNING THE UNITED STATES. PRESIDENT RICE AND VP HARRIS. this is already the setup if Biden wins and the Dems will close there eyes to Biden family Ukraine deals.
Rice will make history 1st woman VP and President and wait! history yet again A WOMAN PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT RUNNING THE UNITED STATES. PRESIDENT RICE AND VP HARRIS. this is already the setup if Biden wins and the Dems will close there eyes to Biden family Ukraine deals.
A vote for Biden is a vote for PRESIDENT RICE and VP to be announced at later date maybe Harris. Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.
It's almost like Trump is trying lose by even more than he already is among female voters....
Rice would be the best pick for Biden. And Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.PRESIDENT RICE VP to be announced at later date maybe Harris
They would be right! and Rice would be the best pick for Biden. And Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.PRESIDENT RICE VP to be announced at later date
Just one of the reasons this #nurse is voting for #Biden in Novemember. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
That sounds like a Trump campaign ad. "This is the America Joe Biden wants!"
Trump doesn't lose, so whoever Biden picks as VP is irrelevant.
Children Are Not Immune
Umm that was Obama and Biden.
Joe Biden as a Muppet? Now there’s an idea! Thank you Raymond Arroyo on Laura Ingraham. #FoxNews
Do his people really not tell him it’s 1918 not ‘17? Understand that happening one time. We all misspeak. But it’s every dang time. Biden makes an error and fixes it. This guy. Ugh. Is his staff so afraid of his wrath they’re willing to let him embarrass himself over and over?
It’s over for Biden.
Can a reporter ask him where he went to church this weekend and tell him where Biden went?
Donny says Biden will hurt god. Did I miss the part where Joe collected all the Infinity Stones?
Who cares if they can do the job.....just make sure it’s a soul sista! Biden is weak he will wilt I’m sure
Joe Biden owns Fox News reporter during morning bike ride
I read someone’s comment that said he’s probably calling everyone in and giving them a face-to-face “Thanks for your participation. It’s not you” talk ..   Sounds like something Biden would do ...
The media is giving Biden a pass for his cognitive decline and his obvious racist point of view.
Biden’s Choice
After the election the Covid hoax will end, and Biden and the DemocRATs will scamper back into their rat holes.
Biden and Trump are not the best our country has to offer.  There are other options and we NEED to acknowledge them to break this broken two-party system.  #LetHerSpeak
Biden sold our manufacturing to the Chinese, the same country that caused the DemocRATS to scare our country into shutting down!1
So Biden comes out of his basement for church and grieving for those lost. Trump comes out of bunker for ego trips and golf. No brainer who the better man is here.

You are absolutely right his run for the office is just a ploy just ignore him and vote for Biden

Joe Biden does not support defunding the  police you dummy
“You’re not Black if you don’t vote for me.” I don’t know about anyone else, but I would never let Joe Biden define me no matter what color I am. A 47-year political failure like Joe “China” Biden, has no game whatsoever. Accept maybe making his family rich on taxpayer time.
Thank you.  I was just going to tweet how this is a further move to dictatorship if EO is allowed to go forward.  If, as I hope, Trump is not re-elected, Biden is going to have a real task in putting the Constitution back together from the shredder.
I never seen those quotes man. Guess I should've googled all the racist shit Biden spewed beforehand huh? My bad

Well you better make sure Biden has his Bonner pills ready so them fast hand of his can go after his vp
Teachers unions endorse Biden. I’m sure this is part of their unbiased lesson plans.  Also, does anyone else see a potential problem with teachers unions - the folks who have a lot of influence over kids - promoting “preferred” candidates for office or is that just me?
Charleston is excited for President  to be in Mankato because he is the Law &amp; Order candidate.  Biden &amp; Democrats like Rep. Nadler call the actions of anarchist groups like Antifa “a myth” and want to defund our police. 🚔   Good boys #BackTheBlue #PupsForTrump
It’s closed in the public and I hear it’s for him to talk shit about Biden and unemployment....
Live in Mankato.  You remember where that is I’m sure.  I sell seed, fert, and chemy to farmers.  Have you done polls on the group you came from?   Guess what, they will vote #Trump2020.  There’s not a single Biden sign anywhere south of Minneapolis.  #FarmersAndRanchersForTrump
"Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum," Biden said.
yes, biden is also a terrible candidate but unfortunately we have to pick the lesser of two evils. even though these 4 years won’t be great, use your voice. it will change the future of our country. #SettleForBiden
biden is also a terrible candidate but we have to settle for the lesser of two evils, please use your voice.
This sounds a lot more like something that would happen to Biden than President Trump
My Minnesota Morning Glory Vines  give me splendid beautiful blossoms every morning! There is glory every morning with hope in my heart for a Biden-Harris administration 💜
It gets weirder when you consider the number of times I’ve seen in the past 24 hours biden and harris being described as center right.
Democrats applaud, Republicans blast Biden’s choice for V-P running mate
Democrats applaud, Republicans blast Biden’s choice for V-P running mate
If you vote for Biden/Harris your voting for #Marism
Praise God for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and a new beginning restoring everything Trump has destroyed. Vote blue!
you must be happy with Biden’s pick, no? I am.
Was never comfortable with Biden in the first place and most people shouldn’t have been. Literally wayyyyy too many videos of him sniffing/touching children. Not to mention the fact that he can barely speak sentences these days without looking like he was having a stroke 🥴
So all Biden fans voting 3rd party now or they gonna hop on the trump train? Such a terrible vp pick for “Democrats” basically sinching a Trump win it looks like.
I travel a bunch all over Southern Mn, not one Biden sign ever seen!   For all those liberal wack jobs and BLM supporters, the suppliers of your food #americanfarmers are supporting
I’m enjoying seeing/hearing the pure joy &amp; optimism of Black women over Biden’s choice. Bernie Bros, if you can’t share that optimism &amp; joy, then try sitting this one out. I promise an unspoken (untweeted) thought won’t kill you.
The most annoying thing about today is that there is no Biden/Harris baseball caps in the official store as that’s the item I want the most right now.
That was based on that clip.. how she talked about the bus... and reminded Biden of his past. That clip is literally the first time I have seen her. I have no idea of her or her policies.
I heard both Biden &amp; Harris are radical left. Are you suggesting I’ve been misinformed?
1. This provides a stark difference between Biden &amp; the GOP candidate. Biden doesn’t oust folks just because they criticize him. 2. This is sexist because we don’t judge men by their likeability. If we did, then we would say that the GOP candidate has a likeability problem.
From 2017?? Do you know what Biden has said in the last week😜😜
I know this is far from the best option, but. We can survive four years of Biden. We cannot survive another four years of Trump. Please vote.
Congrats VP Kamala Harris. I knew it was going to be you! I'm so happy! Please don't forget the indigenous people of America in your role as VP and also remind the soon to be President Biden also of the indigenous peoples' treaty rights. I am giddy with excitement.!
Check out the Biden 2020 boat parade!
Biden/Harris works for me. But then anything other than Tr*mp/P*nce would’ve worked for me.
Would have voted for Biden as long as he didn’t pick Pence for a running mate. However, THIS actually makes me EXCITED!!!
Biden picked Kamala Harris for VP!!
BREAKING: CBS News reports former VP Joe Biden and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has chosen California Senator and former presidential candidate Kamala Harris has his running mate.
Biden/Harris  Trump/Pence  The race is set
Democrats close to the campaign say an announcement is imminent, and could come today
Good reason right there to not vote for Biden!  Fauci needs to go!!
I can't believe Joe Biden picked Oprah Winfrey for his running mate!!!
FYI there are people crazy enough to think Biden will choose her.
Because Trump is a young buck.Trump is 74 and Biden is 77. They are both old and both had speaking difficulties. If you bash one you should also bash the other one for their faults.
2020 Election predictions.. Joe Biden will probably win cuz of how incompetent Trump has been in handling both Covid and the Protests, Trump would probably reject the election results, the Dems won’t have it and the Republicans will just sit back and analyze/commentate as usual.
Like if you think its weird that Biden hasn’t announced a VP yet, that’s probably why.
The great thing is that you can both vote and do direct action and a Biden presidency will make direct action easier than a Trump presidency.
At this point I’m fine with the next president having dimentia. Doesn’t even have to be Biden, just give us a random person from a nursing home, idc.
At this point Biden could pick a homeless woman or man and people would still be okay with it. They would still vote for Biden, might not be a great upgrade over the current President. However the mistakes Biden could make is easier to stomach then Trump's.
I won’t believe anyone but Biden. People are going to try and spread lies just make others angry.
One could argue that bragging about acing a standard cognitive test is concerning for decline as well.  I’ve administered that test and it’s not that hard.  And I’d love to see your dad and Biden go head to head on both a ramp and a bike.
While knocking doors for President  this morning. I came across this great reminder of why the USA is great.  This war didn’t happen so Socialist Joe Biden can tear our country apart.   This is why we need #4MoreYears to protect our history and constitution.Hmmm, Biden says wear masks for three months. About election time I think, hmmm
If Trump steals the election and tries to destroy our rights, there will be a Civil War, no protests, WAR - we will know our enemies because no masks and hillbilly smiles, and Confederate Flags
If we live under a dictatorship there won’t be protests or free speech. My great great grandparents left Germany in the 1800’s to escape their government - they left everything behind to be free
I'm Biden my time.
So then why are all the Biden people trying to skip out on the debates? Face the music, Biden is senile, will be embarrassed within the first 10 minutes.
. wants to mandate every American wear masks OUTDOORS!   hasn’t required that (yet). So when will he denounce this authoritarianism from Biden/  When will the media ask  if she supports a federal mask mandate (that includes outdoors)?
Me too.  I think Biden has been anal probed by many aliens
The msm mentioned this peace deal didn’t say a word or even mention trump and then said Biden and Harris said they will add to this if they get elected typical liberal bs
Biden is a racist. Here he is with Robert Byrd, leader of the kkk and demokkkrats. You should learn something
They can't make a pitch that does not boil down to "not Trump". These Biden Bros are very toxic.
Youre referring to Kamala...referring to Biden, right?
"The Biden campaign is a Trojan horse in the truest sense: it’s an empty vessel through which the Dems are attempting to substitute a portion of the GOP’s base for a portion of their own.
When her Wikipedia page was recently scrubbed &amp; details about her prosecution record started to disappear EVERYONE should have known the "Hollywood" re-write was in motion.  Put Biden in a dog collar now, give him some fruit cup &amp; give "Nurse Diesl" her whip.
This is disgusting. Are you doing anything to stop it?  This will not be forgotten when Biden wins.
Unless Biden sniffs her 3 pack a day smoke smell then he might keal over.
What an endorsement for Biden!
You DO realize not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump who wants to take away Medicare and Social Security.
BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
OMG. I was half joking when I said Biden didn’t mention showers and toilets
Biden and Harris introducing their candidacy on the 3 year anniversary of Charlottesville is beautifully done.
I keep watching Pres Obama and VP Biden but now I don't have to.  #BidenHarris2020  #tRumpForPrison2021
As much as I appreciate West, he may vote Biden.
#BidenKamala2020 Cause I’m NOT Doing Another trump Term PERIOD. I’m not stupid, and I don’t support Everything That either Biden nor Kamala has done... nor ANYBODY for that matter But, I REFUSE even the remote possibility that trump’s stankin ass gets re-elected. My SOUL rejects
The Biden method
Biden needs to worry about white men/women voting for him, not black people 😂
Kamala isn't my first choice but neither was Joe Biden.  Whatever it takes honestly. Kamala is well spoken but that does not excuse her past at all.
Biden chose the cop. :/
C’mon man!!!Joe Biden doesn’t remember what he had for breakfast this morning, let alone what he believes. Or do you mean how black people “ain’t” black if they don’t vote for him? Or how black people, with “notable exceptions”, aren’t diverse and can’t think for themselves?
Biden has no chance #MAGA 🇺🇸
Someone needs to tell Biden that he is running for President.
Biden was my LAST choice, but he's still 1000X better than Trump.
My VP Take:  The fact that Kamala Harris is  considered both “A RADICAL LIBERAL” AND “A COP” means that her positions probably align fairly close to the average American voter  I think it was a smart pick by Joe Biden  #KamalaHarrisForVP #JoeBidenForPresident2020
"I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it," Harris said about Biden’s accusers
Trump is a terrible, disgusting piece of shit.  But the Democrats aren't even trying to win.  In fact, their VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, Kamala Harris, has previously said that she believes that Joe Biden is guilty of multi-time sexual assault:
Remember the beating  gave Biden in the debates?? And she LIKES him.   Pence ... about to be destroyed.
Trump says men are insulted Biden picked a woman VP candidate! Can you get any more misogynist?! Hey Trump, real men don’t get insulted when capable women break the glass ceiling
Excellent #VPPick, Mr. Biden. Trump supporters are probably celebrating today because of this historically terrible pick. 🙄
EXACTLY!! Biden doesn't cry in the bunk house!!
I wonder if the Biden/Harris ticket will use a 2Pac Shakur theme song?
Biden Harris would destroy your business. You will no longer have a business to run under their policies. Good luck to you if you vote blue.
Curious as to what the polls look like now in Biden vs. Trump.
Please vote for Biden/Harris November 3rd. They are the best option we have to lead this country the next 4 years.
Biden-Harris 2020 sounds so much better than Trump-Pence 2020
Senator Kamala Harris is the pick for Vice President! I'm on board for Biden-Harris 2020!   #BidenHarris2020
Waiting for Twitter to break with who Joe Biden announces as his VP pick.
THE PICK IS IN!!!!  Biden to announce soon.
I will vote for Biden if he picks Harvey the Rabbit as his running mate. If something happened to Biden, an invisible rabbit would still be a better president than Trump.
this right here ought to tell the American people who Biden really is .. and, for the record, President Trump does NOT favor Russia, Putin, election interference or any of those things liberal Democrats continually accuse him of.
I will vote for Joe Biden if he chooses my 5 pound Yorkshire Terrier as his running mate! I would prefer Harris, but it's Joe we need!
And Biden has been using her plan. #WarrenVP
Is Biden making his announcement today on VP choice?
I will be happy when these are the jokes we make about the government again.
Who would you put on Biden’s dream team of cabinet members?
Hope you are on Biden Cabinet
Biden does kind of look like Captain Crunch
Polls, can we trust them?
Joe Biden's heretical Catholicism is far  deeper than his abortion stance.Quite frankly, he, &amp;     should all be denied Holy Communion until they publicly uphold &amp; defend the teachings of the church. Bishops: More doctrine less videos #DefendtheFaith
Was Biden president ? 🤣🤣🤣If you vote for Trump you ain’t black.   If you vote for Biden you’re a fucking idiot.
Yes on all accounts not a Biden fan but we gotta get rid of Trump.  Damn 2 party system sucks here. Hopefully implement a different system someday when ppl get smarter!
“What’s actually happening”, wtf does that mean. You can drive everywhere and see Trump signs and Biden signs. Doesn’t matter where the fuck you are
Biden should do an interview with Jonathan Swan. Imagine the side by side
You left out a few more go to’s that you’ve seen on FoxNews so please, continue. Wanna talk about Comey and Flynn too while we’re on the subject of Basketball? Biden? Kamala? What you got
I see much less enthusiasm for Biden than Hillary...
We are better than this moment.  New video by the Lincoln project.  We cannot take four more years.  Vote for Biden.

The world is already laughing.  AT YOU AND YOU ONLY !!!!  THE WORLD IS ANXIOUS TO HAVE JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT U.S. PRESIDENT.
He thinks “mail-in” is any scribbled napkin with Biden’s name on it that gets folded, stamped and mailed.
If you want a national mask mandate, vote for Joe Biden.
Well I've got some red meat for you: We're not going to let Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris cut America's meat!" -------"And we will toss your salad!"
Oops I am so sorry.... If Biden &amp; Harris win.
Well ID Niden &amp; Harris win we are screwed period Biden has always been racist, check it out. Why does government allows section eights it ruined the area I lived in. They get a half the price break out in nice suburbs. I am fed cons. Yet lower got changes. David J Harris UTube!!
Took a hopeful hike to the top of Mt. Democrat and raised a little money for the Biden-Harris campaign, too!       #GoJoe2020 #BidenHarris #Democrats
Does Joe Biden know more than a single health official quoted in this article?
Many here want universal health coverage. Unless we get a Democratic majority in the Senate (or find some long-lost Republican moderates), the bill won't reach Biden's desk. What's important for the election is to flip the Senate. Then we can talk tactics. Need more on Team Blue.
I’m just so tired of the shit where anyone remotely criticizes Biden or Harris and some lib is like “okay I guess you want trump to win then” as if that’s an argument
Dude liberals really think “at least he’s not Trump” is a good argument for Joe Biden. At best he’ll choose marginally better SC Justices, but honestly pretty sure libs just think trump is obnoxious and mean and think the country would look better with someone else.
For them to embrace to political left is for them to reject the corporate donations that keep them rich and powerful, and that won’t happen, so of course Biden would rather choose Harris and fight for conservative votes than skew remotely to the left.
It makes no sense to say “push Biden left,” because the political left lies on a wholly different spectrum from neoliberalism. That’s why conservative politicians can support trump but liberal politicians won’t support Bernie; Trump didn’t question capitalism and Bernie did.
- The so called editorial written by John Eastman is a racist letter to those who think a woman of color, born in Oakland, CA is not eligible to run w Biden. I am deeply offended that you would allow this blatant birther piece in your mag. Disgusting #BoycottNewsweek
Has there ever been a high profile political figure more ripe for SNL-style satire than Joe Biden?   But they don't ever go there, do they? Even SNL's treatment of him during the debate was very gentle.  Huh. Wonder why that is?  #TCNT
It is even scarier that he comes right out and says it!   Trump says fear of 'low income housing' will bring 'the suburban housewife' to his side  via
Well? This would cause me to vote for Biden... #MedicareForAll
How low?  Very low! Herman Cain Twitter Account Shares Posthumous Attack on Biden and Harris
Biden Harris is a good start to clean up the messes created by trump pence and GOP. I state the obvious.
I'm looking for suggestions for the Biden/Harris cabinet.  Ideas?
Ready.  All Blue all the time.  Crucial that Biden had a New Democratic Leader in the Senate.  Cannot get the legislation through that we need without a majority in the Senate and the House.
"They bought their tickets on the Trump Train. It’s time for them to take the ride."  via
Every time I think about the Biden/Harris ticket I just think how hard Leslie Knope would be campaigning for this.
Thank God we might have well spoken leaders in the white house again.. Listening to Harris speak,, actually made my eyes well up,, and my heart to fill with pride again.. Harris makes case against Trump in first speech as Biden's running mate
Under Obama &amp; Biden, there were zero deaths from the bubonic plague.  That’s leadership or perhaps selective history.  H1N1 anybody???????!!!!!!!
Biden can lose Florida and still win if he gets Wisconsin and Arizona
At today’s appearance, Biden and Harris had the state and territory flags as a background. What did they do for the Mississippi flag?
Like the dipshit who just asked if Biden should publicly denounce Antifa? WITAF kind of question is that?
is saying #Biden will be killed, or die?   go talk to this Cowardly people who can say this
Trump or Biden tweet it to me
I can say same thing about u voting for Biden
You're gonna vote for Joe Biden. You support Keith Ellison. You probably supported Al Franken and would again. Drop the Southern belle act.
And I am supposed to worry that Biden might not be a competent leader?
I don't know many conservatives that support Joe Biden.  Oh wait you're talking about the Lincoln Republicans.  I see.  #tcnt
Trump: If Biden wins, Americans will have to learn Chinese  via
‘That’s all they’ve got?’ MSNBC’s Morning Joe and Mika mock Trump’s attacks against Biden-Harris -
for me at least i see trump as a symptom of a broken system not him being the cause per se. a lot of how we got to this point is purely because of the tough on crime stance that dems took in the late 80s and 90s (spearheaded by biden) to appeal to conservatives.
i would if i had faith that the same wouldnt happen under biden/kamala esp considering kamala's track record
biden/kamala is just so fucking bad, biden alone was bad but fucking kamala? w/e i wasnt planning on voting anyways.
The Trump Biden comparisons are pissing me off. Have you guys not been paying attention to the world under Trump?? Biden would be miles better and we cannot afford another four years of Trump. What’s not clicking???
Could you,  , show us the other ads you had already prepared for the candidates NOT chosen by Biden? I know they exist!
I think he was trying to intimate that Harris was so critical of Biden, that Trump wanted her to run with him
To those who think Biden/Harris aren't progressive enough--If progressive legislation is passed in Congress, Biden will sign it.  That's why down-ballot races are so important. Execs set the tone, but Congress is where the work will get hammered out.  Vote Blue in all contests.
Republicans are failing to realize.  Kamala Harris isn't running for president! Joe Biden will be the one that'll wipe the floor with Trump!
I figure most of the progressive agenda needs legislative work.  That just makes down-ballot races crucial.  Don’t fret about Biden/Harris. Work hard to get Democrats elected to Congress and state houses.  Pay attention to any judges on the ballot, too.
Biden/Harris 2020 all the way. #DumpTrump2020
Biden/Harris 2020. Make America Sane.
If both #BLM and the #MeToo movements were consistent and not just Democrat voting machines, they would both be opposed to a Biden candidacy. Kamala Harris joining the ticket does nothing to help the credibility of either movement. #TCNT
Exactly where should Biden be during the #Trumpvirus other than his own home?  Pretty lame Screamer even for you! 🤮💩 #BidenHarris2020
Kamala Harris chosen as the running mate. This is problematic given her voting record and it is not progressive ticket. via
I’m in stand by for hopefully a big old nothing but loving the timeline love for Biden/Harris 2020.
Remember when Kamla Harris thought Joe Biden was a racist? LOL
Campaign for Biden/Harris like they are 10 points behind! Get out there and work your ass off for these two great people...
It’s about to get bigger.
Coulda been a wet rag and I’d still vote Biden.
I'm elated and have tears at the same time !  OMG.  So proud of Biden right now.  What a great choice.  It's an historic day for black women, and women in general !
I would have preferred Duckworth, but Harris is definitely competitant. Also by picking someone that was so critical of him during the primaries, Biden signifies he has thick skin unlike 45.
Well said. Biden has to pick a VP that will work with him, not the " most popular dance partner".
Ok. So I guess Joe Biden will be on soon. You know. So he doesn’t have politics on one side.
You do realize that Biden is only three years older than Trump? Rightwing polllsters have already given up on polling and realize Biden is going to win. Doesn’t matter, it’s much more important to end Trump’s presidency.
I was with you up until the Biden part. The dude never had a lot but lost whatever he had.
I bet you were all over Joe Biden the other day too. But now, you can say we don’t look at facts and that’s ok? You see that hypocrisy. When it’s good for you, the rest of us can’t comprehend. When it’s bad it’s oh don’t lump us all together. Right??
But if Biden picks the wrong VP, amiright?
Anybody who is triggered by my tweets, rest assured, if Hilary or Biden were proving themselves as incompetent, I’d say the same thing. I could care less about right, left, or upside down. This country needs leadership and we do not have it.
Amy called Biden and asked to be dropped from consideration.  She actually told Biden she was withdrawing because she believed the 2020 VP pick should be a woman of color.
Right...they've all done something we don't like.  I'll never forget how Biden treated Anita Hill (in the Clarence Thomas hearings), but that doesn't mean I won't vote for him.
Good grief! And, he and his two sons like to talk about Biden????? #DementedDon
The dropout who tweets about D.J. Trump as a "clown president" hasn't listened well to sleepy Joe Biden. I doubt Joe would be able to mentally survive a four-year term.
* IF* Joe Biden ends up choosing a white female running mate, how will you feel about that?
Secure drop boxes are a great idea, especially since we just had an actual *theft* of a mailbox over the weekend.  Who knew mailboxes could be stuffed in a van?  Not trying to unjustly accuse but it doesn't seem like something a Biden supporter would do.
Wtf?  A vote for any candidate other than Biden is a vote for trump. What about this don’t you understand?
Just listen to yourself.  You sound like a toddler and act like one. How embarrassing for the President of the United States to act so immature. I want a real man as a President and that would be  Biden
Fox news finally admitted that Sarah Palin was a big mistake as John McCain  VP pick. Fox News also think that Joe Biden VP  pick would be something worse than Palin.  Fox news is wrong again! No one can be that horrible! Fox turns on Palin.
The administration.  Is covering for Russian interference , in American elections. They would like people to think , China and Iran want Biden to win. To downplay Russian interference. It's also give Trump an opportunity to say, China and Iran rigged the election in Biden favor!
Very true.  Biden’s thought to wandering out his mouth and that makes the likes of liberals cringe.  You’d have to wheel Biden of the debate stage on a gurney.
Trump.  Is going to cry like a naked baby when he loses on November 3rd.  People should vote for Biden just to see that fiasco!
They’ll wait till the last minute and replace Biden as the candidate with an unknown and I debated candidate.  Last minute Hillary switch?
There’s all these things then I hear someone say “Biden seems creepy, that’s why I won’t vote for him”???
"You have to ask what Biden is doing I don't think he knows what he's doing "
I dare you to race Biden on bicycles...winner is President.
What if Biden DID die at some point earlier this year and they DID make a hologram of him to keep up the charade, but in a Star Trek Holodeck-esque mishap, the hologram escaped and HE'S the one running for president. 🤔🤔🤔
Peter doocy will be VP running mate.  Biden-Doocy 2020.
Pray to God Joe Biden wins and we take back the Senate. We'll have to rebuild the State Department and our intelligence agencies. Who knows how many Russian assets are now in the CIA thanks to Trump?
Exactly. Most VP choices are announced just prior to the Convention.  This woman could be President at some point. If they go through rigorous vetting, all the better. A VP is a partner in governance. Regardless of our fave, Biden will need to work w her. It is his call.
Or China is backing up Dumpty's claim that a Biden win means being in cahoots with China, making Biden look corrupt. This is a Through The Looking Glass world now.
I retired as an engineering executive.  I'd like to say I'm a self made man.  It isn't true.  I had great parents, teachers and learning environment.  We would see more opportunity for success if ALL had the same as I had.  Fund education!  Proud to be a Republican for Biden.
Kanye said he wanted to pull votes away from Biden. Which voters do you think are watching Fox?
Tbf, Biden's main platform is "I'm not Trump" so they're both doing it
America.  No matter how many gaphs Biden might make his heart will always be in the right place. Trump.  Is a cruel and evil man and so are his supporters. They all need to be brought down a notch! ROME IS BURNING!
Nothing wrong with saying how we can all do better.  I think the Professor did a fine job of saying how Biden can improve, rather than just identifying his shortfalls. Nuance is a good thing.Joe’s gonna wipe up the place with you. Biden = bye-Don #slurringdon

Hmmm, Biden says wear masks for three months. About election time I think, hmmm
Trump has already done things this is not something Biden has actually done.  I asked what HAS he done not what he says he will do.  You didn't answer the question   What has Biden done legislatively for black education in the past 40 years?
You didn't answer the question   What has Biden done legislatively for black education in the past 40 years?
No I was trying to find the best way to get this conversation back on topic after you derailed it.  You didn't answer the question. What has Biden done legislatively for black education in the past 40 years?
No, you used something irrelevant as an excuse to detail the conversation   Now back to my question.  What has Biden done legislatively for black communities in the past 40 years?
I did a 2 year comparison on black education as a way to show Biden has done nothing and you took it as a chance to deflect to comparing Obama and Trump. You were the one who mentioned economy first.  You brought are the one who derailed the entire conversation   I baited you
Why do you want Biden who was the vice president involved with the policy that caused our costs to skyrocket?
oh and look according to a black college source Trump is doing more for black education than Obama  What has Biden done legislatively for black education in the past 40 years?
Exactly, he didn't.  And yet you trust him as somebody who will actually do something.  No wonder Demokkkrats feel so entitled to the black vote Biden can say things like of you don't support him "you ain't black"
Hey Joe? (China) Yes? (Biden). I will trade you one dollar for five. Okay. Lol
Biden didnt draft the fair sentencing act nor was it his legislature. Also the fair sentencing act did nothing to release.  You didn't answer the question. Why didn't Biden do his job and draft legislature to free the people mass incarcerated by his bill?
If Trump steals the election and tries to destroy our rights, there will be a Civil War, no protests, WAR - we will know our enemies because no masks and hillbilly smiles, and Confederate Flags
Biden has been an elected official for 16 years after his crime bill, why hasn't he done his job and drafted legislature to free the black men his bill mass incarcerated?
If we live under a dictatorship there won’t be protests or free speech. My great great grandparents left Germany in the 1800’s to escape their government - they left everything behind to be free

Nope. I'm waiting because if Biden wins, the street prices go up.
Guess who started racist gun control and currently wants gun control. Demokkkrats Guess who drafted the most recent mass incarceration policy. Demokkkrat Joe Biden Guess who mass incarcerated black Americans for weed. Demokkkrat Kamala Harris.
Oh yeah I'm with you. Biden drafted mass incarceration policy and Kamala mass incarcerated black Americans.  I intend to vote Kanye so I can screw over Biden without voting for Trump.  Blame your party for screwing Yang.
Bunnies for Biden!
Oh so him naming a woman that mass incarcerated black Americans for weed yet laughed about smoking doesn't lose your vote?  How about Biden drafting the 94 crime bill which contributed to the mass incarcerations of thousands of black Americans.? Oh by the way he defends that bill
Had your party not screwed Yang I would have voted for them.  Instead it chose Biden who drafts mass incarceration policy and Kamala who mass incarcerates black Americans.  I'm gonna vote Kanye to screw the Dems without voting for Trump.
Trump's an idiot but I'm not voting for Biden/Harris. Biden drafted the mass incarceration policies of 94 and Harris mass incarcerated black Americans for weed. So honestly I just wanna screw them over.  I'll vote for Kanye to screw Biden without voting for Trump
Biden gets touchy with kids and raped Tara Reade. You are a hypocrite, just stop.
I don't even like Trump but I can't support Biden or Harris.  When you say attorney, do you mean prosecutor who mass incarcerated black Americans for weed?

The jaded Bernie bro types would have us believe the ‘evil DNC’ twice stopped Bernie from earning critical African American support in a Democratic primary. That failing is NOT Hillary’s fault, nor Joe Biden’s (nor Elizabeth Warren’s). Bernie can look in a mirror.
It’s simple: Biden, or more of the same. Which do you prefer?
It doesn't sound good to me.  Biden drafted the 94 crime bill which contributed to the mass incarcerations of many black Americans. Kamala Harris was a prosecutor who incarcerated black Americans for weed.  Sorry, I can't get behind that.  Oh and btw Trump sucks too.
What I love is I'm not voting for either candidate.  Trump's an idiot but Biden and Harris are mass incarcerators. I hate mass incarcerators.  So either I will vote for Kanye or if he's not on the ballot, I'll vote for Trump.
The republicans suck but I can't vote for Biden and Harris. The mass incarceration history is the dealbreaker.  I dislike the republicans but I hate the Demokkkrats at this point.  So I'm gonna vote for Kanye to screw Biden. If he drops out I'm voting Trump

Trump isn't the cause of our slow journey into fascism. Deteriorating material conditions for an increasing amount of people are. A consolidation of state power by corporate interests is. Massive wealth inequality is. Democratic leadership has helped create this world. Biden too.
...isn't going to end, at least not because Trump. In summary: if Biden wins, boring. If Trump wins: neverending roller coaster of excitement. 5/5
I'm going to admit something that might make me seen like a psychopath. I kinda want Trump to win. Not because I like him or anything. Definitely not enough to vote for him. Just for the entertainment value. If Biden wins, the Republicans will... 1/x
"Trump is a fascist so we must vote him out!"  Implies that Biden, an authoritarian that would assume office during a time of capitalist crisis, would not be one.   Fascism is a response to socioeconomic facts, not just a quality of individuals.
This alone is why we vote for Biden.
Dispel with notions that either branch of the neoliberal government will reduce harm. Being blinded by the idea that this current admin isnt simply an extension of the last, and biden wont be an extension of this one is some serious lib shit.
I agree, but would this be your position if they endorsed Biden?
Yeah I'm using my vote on the black candidate with the most pro black platform. Even though Kanye won't win I hope he screws Biden over
The argument is that trump is an existential fascist threat  Joe biden worked to corner and smoke out a whistleblower for revealing the fashy stuff the obama admin was doing   Biden is not harm reduction
I prefer #BidenHarris in the White House. #Biden will bring back some peace of mind for many. Every morning I wake up wondering what did you do overnight, who did you pick a fight with? Keep this in mind, when you go to prison don't pick any fights. #BidenHarris  #Biden
"Remember the time when the chickens were on their way but hadn't come home to roost? We'll remind you of that time. Biden 2020"
Oh yes I do. If I didn't exist the Demokkkrat party wouldn't be so upset about people either voting 3rd party or refusing to vote. I will vote however I can to screw Biden over.
If Kanye drops out I'm voting for Trump   I don't support Trump but I'll do whatever I can to screw Biden over.
Biden cant beat trump. He will never be elected
I'm sick of black Americans still having to feel the effects of Bidens 94 mass incarceration bill.  Trump sucks but nowhere near as bad as Biden.  I'm not voting for either candidate, I'm voting for Kanye West
Kamala incarcerated black Americans for weed and joked about how she smoked weed. She's a racist shit just like Biden.  I'm not voting Trump or Demokkkrat. If either party wants my vote, have a pro black platform  Kanye is my protest vote and I hope he costs Biden the election.
So then why are all the Biden people trying to skip out on the debates? Face the music, Biden is senile, will be embarrassed within the first 10 minutes.
It's So FUN to be constantly oscillating between voting for Joe Biden to be a "good" person and being an actual good person.
The USPS union has endorsed Biden-Harris.
It’s about as pathetic as impotent Trump blaming Obama for things 1,374 days after the election.  Seriously are you guys this stupid to lob these toothless softballs?    It’s like you’re trying to get Biden elected.
Are you shocked? One side is calling for them to be defunded, they have lively hoods. Let me guess USPS is supporting Biden. This narrative is tired.
I see nothing but crap on both sides.  Biden drafted policy that contributed to many mass incarcerated blacks. Kamala was a prosecutor who mass incarcerated black Americans for weed.  Trump sucks I'm not voting for him. I'm just gonna vote Kanye to screw the Dems.
What did Biden do to fix any of this when it was happening under his and Obama's watch?
Why didn't Biden fight to get them closed when he was vice president to Obama?  He's the current Dem nominee
Im not even voting for Trump but I hope he wins. If the Demokkkrat party hadn't screwed Yang, maybe I'd support Biden   #Kanye2020
Racist comments aren't exclusive to Trump. According to Biden, black voters who don't support him "ain't black"  Biden still defends his mass incarceration policy.  What's worse. Trump's racist comments or Bidens mass incarcerations?
This is so true
It's funny how you are playing whataboutisms to try and deflect   Biden caused thousands upon thousands of black americans to be mass incarcerated and Harris incarcerated black Americans for weed.  Any whataboutisms you try to make are lesser, so give it up
And a vote for Biden is a vote for mass incarcerations of black Americans. Sorry can't do that one buddy
You realize Kanye isn't gonna win and is only here to take votes from Biden?
i do not trust joe biden.  and kamala ?? not a good candidate for america

Go vote for the other Biden then, Jack!
The question is: will media allow Biden and Harris to continue not answering questions? You would think that some ethics might still be relevant for journalists - this far those seem to be lacking. A major party candidate has been in a hidey hole for 3 months and media takes it.
. wants to mandate every American wear masks OUTDOORS!   hasn’t required that (yet). So when will he denounce this authoritarianism from Biden/  When will the media ask  if she supports a federal mask mandate (that includes outdoors)?
Alicia Mendoza, do you understand the difference between voting at the Democratic National Convention next week vs a vote in November General Election? Bernie wants his delegates next week to vote for for Bernie. Then he wants his supporters to vote for Biden in November!
What the fuck even was that conversation. She also had a totally incorrect timeline for when people were dropping out and endorsing Biden, and had totally the wrong idea about how people were doing in actual delegates and votes before that happened.
Me too.  I think Biden has been anal probed by many aliens

She also has the same level of ability to string together complete English sentences as Joe Biden
I'm not convinced it matters if you admit you'll vote for Biden or not. They don't care about our votes. They don't want people like us to be anywhere near their party. Someone like Biden in particular will never genuinely move left on anything of significance.
Exactly. If Kanye drops out I'm voting for Trump.  I hope he costs Biden the election. The Dems shouldnt have screwed Yang.
The audacity of Biden voters telling non-supporters to check their privilege lmaoo
Funny how they have nothing to say about Trump's father buying his way into University and the fact he had to PAY SOMEONE ELSE to even get his scores up high enough.  But yeah, Biden in 3rd grade.
You know Biden is an actual racist, right? Not to mention creep when it comes to children.

Biden and Harris is 4 years of mass incarcerations.  Biden drafted the 94 crime bill which caused mass incarcerations of many black Americans  Harris incarcerated black Americans for weed.  Trump sucks but I'm not supporting Demokkkrats either  I'm voting for Kanye

I'd rather vote for somebody who won't be president than to vote for Biden or Trump.  I personally think black voters should refuse to vote for any candidate that isn't black until we get a totally pro black agenda.
Exactly.  It's hard for me, it's either vote Trump or vote Kanye. I refuse to support Biden or Kamala, it goes against what I feel is right for the community I live in.  The last straw was Bidens " if you aren't for sure if you support me or Trump, you ain't black" comments
Biden drafted legislature which contributed to the mass incarcerations of many black Americans. Kamala was a prosecutor who incarcerated black Americans for weed.  If neither party is going to have a pro black agenda, I'm gonna vote for the black candidate in the race  #Kanye2020
1. He can't unilaterally do this and if any GOPer let's it happen there will be no rules for the Biden/Harris administration (which is bad. But fine). 2. Transparently trying to buy votes.

Okay look, I know better than to expect any kind of sense from Shiny Paste and Polyester, but tweeting out this lovely photo is as dumb as when whatsisname tweeted that adorable pic of Biden with his little boy and was like “BURN amirite”
Vote for Biden. First we deal with the threat to our very democracy, then we deal with the other party.
The science also doesn’t call for a national mask mandate that includes every citizen to wear masks inside and outside...will you point that out to Mr. Biden. Also, you’re on record that Hydroxychloroquine helped your spouse - is that science then? Thank you.
Remember how left-leaning news ran with a narrative that Biden was the "most-electable" candidate?  Like that.
This is skewed by what the poll considers "white Christians". They should have a category for so called "evangelicals" because I was Methodist now Lutheran and ALL white Christians I know support Biden.
Ha! ^ Good take Danny. You seem ALL IN on Kamala or “don’t matter, anyone but Trump”? It troubling how she called Biden a segregationist, suggested he drop out, believed accusers, but now all good 🤷‍♂️ - phony? We think a mistake it’s not Amy. Is this our winning ticket? Ughh 🥴😩

Not to mention, no talk of how many delegates Biden received in 2008.
Mainly my point is biden was instrumental in building the circumstances we find ourselves in, and effectively gave us trump. Handing him the reigns is like asking OG dark lord to have another shot
Why are we talking about bernie  Biden seems okay to people that think obama did things that made stuff seem ok when obama was an imperialist war monger riding the final years of "functional" neoliberalism. Biden is an authoritarian that will enter office during cap in crisis

Long story short? The states likely to see a breakdown over mail voting are isolated. And the states Biden likely will win with have well-run vote counting. (ie Biden is at 289 electoral votes with states that are Low/Moderate "post office risk.")
Im not sure of what means of production he privately controls to earn profit, but bernie did reveal himself to be a liberal by endorsing joe biden, architect of the american police state and arch-defender of capital

So… If Biden/Harris were president, they wouldn’t have shut down the economy?  I’m sure Harris knows that’s not true.  I’m pretty sure Harris’s target demographic doesn’t.
No I'm voting Kanye even though I know it helps Trump. Biden is responsible for many mass incarcerated black men with the 94 crime bill. Kamala is too from her days as a prosecutor.  Say what you want about Trump but I'll take him over Biden any day.
I wait and wait for Biden, Harris or any other prominent Democrat to stand up and condemn the violence we are seeing in major cities.  Instead, they are excusing or denying that it exists.  How can they save the country if they won’t look at reality?
Actually, I haven’t seen pictures of him touching young girls inappropriately.  It is rather interesting that instead of defending Biden, you jump to accusing Trump.  If you “know” Trump is a molester, how do you feel about Biden’s public groping of young girls and women?

Many here want universal health coverage. Unless we get a Democratic majority in the Senate (or find some long-lost Republican moderates), the bill won't reach Biden's desk. What's important for the election is to flip the Senate. Then we can talk tactics. Need more on Team Blue.
I’m just so tired of the shit where anyone remotely criticizes Biden or Harris and some lib is like “okay I guess you want trump to win then” as if that’s an argument
Dude liberals really think “at least he’s not Trump” is a good argument for Joe Biden. At best he’ll choose marginally better SC Justices, but honestly pretty sure libs just think trump is obnoxious and mean and think the country would look better with someone else.
For them to embrace to political left is for them to reject the corporate donations that keep them rich and powerful, and that won’t happen, so of course Biden would rather choose Harris and fight for conservative votes than skew remotely to the left.
It makes no sense to say “push Biden left,” because the political left lies on a wholly different spectrum from neoliberalism. That’s why conservative politicians can support trump but liberal politicians won’t support Bernie; Trump didn’t question capitalism and Bernie did.

i would if i had faith that the same wouldnt happen under biden/kamala esp considering kamala's track record
biden/kamala is just so fucking bad, biden alone was bad but fucking kamala? w/e i wasnt planning on voting anyways.

I think he was trying to intimate that Harris was so critical of Biden, that Trump wanted her to run with him
To those who think Biden/Harris aren't progressive enough--If progressive legislation is passed in Congress, Biden will sign it.  That's why down-ballot races are so important. Execs set the tone, but Congress is where the work will get hammered out.  Vote Blue in all contests.
I figure most of the progressive agenda needs legislative work.  That just makes down-ballot races crucial.  Don’t fret about Biden/Harris. Work hard to get Democrats elected to Congress and state houses.  Pay attention to any judges on the ballot, too.

I would have preferred Duckworth, but Harris is definitely competitant. Also by picking someone that was so critical of him during the primaries, Biden signifies he has thick skin unlike 45.

Her calling out biden was warranted. That’s the one good thing she did.
Well said. Biden has to pick a VP that will work with him, not the " most popular dance partner".
You do realize that Biden is only three years older than Trump? Rightwing polllsters have already given up on polling and realize Biden is going to win. Doesn’t matter, it’s much more important to end Trump’s presidency.
I was with you up until the Biden part. The dude never had a lot but lost whatever he had.
But if Biden picks the wrong VP, amiright?
Anybody who is triggered by my tweets, rest assured, if Hilary or Biden were proving themselves as incompetent, I’d say the same thing. I could care less about right, left, or upside down. This country needs leadership and we do not have it.
Amy called Biden and asked to be dropped from consideration.  She actually told Biden she was withdrawing because she believed the 2020 VP pick should be a woman of color.
Right...they've all done something we don't like.  I'll never forget how Biden treated Anita Hill (in the Clarence Thomas hearings), but that doesn't mean I won't vote for him.
Good grief! And, he and his two sons like to talk about Biden????? #DementedDon
The dropout who tweets about D.J. Trump as a "clown president" hasn't listened well to sleepy Joe Biden. I doubt Joe would be able to mentally survive a four-year term.
* IF* Joe Biden ends up choosing a white female running mate, how will you feel about that?
Lol. Why are liberals so willing to believe anything.   Maybe it’s Putin flying in to conspire with Biden...oh wait, only an uneducated liberal would think that.
If they continue to give Trump an hour everyday to basically give a campaign speech they need to give Biden equal time.  Trump just lies and nobody can correct him in realtime.
Secure drop boxes are a great idea, especially since we just had an actual *theft* of a mailbox over the weekend.  Who knew mailboxes could be stuffed in a van?  Not trying to unjustly accuse but it doesn't seem like something a Biden supporter would do.
Wtf?  A vote for any candidate other than Biden is a vote for trump. What about this don’t you understand?
Just listen to yourself.  You sound like a toddler and act like one. How embarrassing for the President of the United States to act so immature. I want a real man as a President and that would be  Biden
I DON'T CARE who it is. I'm voting Biden period full stop. Trump is a cancer that needs to go. ❤
Very true.  Biden’s thought to wandering out his mouth and that makes the likes of liberals cringe.  You’d have to wheel Biden of the debate stage on a gurney.

Kanye said he wanted to pull votes away from Biden. Which voters do you think are watching Fox?

Nothing wrong with saying how we can all do better.  I think the Professor did a fine job of saying how Biden can improve, rather than just identifying his shortfalls. Nuance is a good thing.I’m socialist and the people making attacking trump for his brothers death need to stop regardless of your opinion about trump death is hard to deal with especially when it’s someone so close, I hope Biden calls on people to stop harassing trump on this.

Because: you can’t take Biden winning Illinois for granted. Voting for a third party is literally going to do nothing to make either of them bend to your views. People need to be smarter in voting than expressing their brand affinity.
WELL, HOPEFULLY IT WON'T BE THAT HARD TO VOTE FOR  BIDEN/HARRIS.       BUT IF trump GETS HIS WAY WHO KNOWS WHAT THE HELL HE WILL DO?      MIGHT BUILD WALLS AROUND POLLING PLACES     LIKE ADOLPH trump MIGHT STATION MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PRIVATE GESTAPO/SS ARMY OUTSIDE POLLING PLACES.

Yep, they did it deceptively to make it sound worse than it was because trust me, they won't report the Q3 numbers the same way; although they will report the Q4 numbers to make them look ridiculously good if Biden wins.

But she should really be addressed as Senator Harris, with respect. Until she’s Madame President, that is (I don’t see Biden finishing the term).
convince me to vote for Biden/Harris without mentioning Trump.
#OhGoodShotMaam!  Just remember, #Biden and #Harris will kill them for the good of the world, rather than make peace from selfish, political motives like  #OrangeManBad!!!  #SnarkIsAnUnderappreciatedArtForm
If ur in support of #BLM and #ACAB and ur going to vote 4 Biden/Harris, ur a hypocrite.  If you are not going to be part of the #generalstrike due 2 the govt not completing the stimulus package and supported Sanders, ur also a hypocrite.
BIDEN/HARRIS, A CLASS ACT!!  AMERICA HAS A CHANCE TO RECLAIM ALL THAT IT HAS LOST.  trump/dense NOTHING BUT THE MOST PATHETIC PITIFUL INEPT INCOMPETENT DISGUSTING DEPLORABLE DECEITFUL DESPICABLE REPUGNANT REPULSIVE VAIN CONCEITED ARROGANT EGOTISTICAL  CLASSLESS ACT EVER!!!
Save you my opinions, but this article does a good job summing up where I (huge Warren and Sanders supporter) stand on the Biden/Harris ticket.
… Nobody cares about your opinion, and Kamala Harris will be a great vice president and a great president. She and Biden will really make America great again.
A preview of Biden’s response to Trump’s animated video last night?
I popped this list in a thread yesterday as potential targets for blame should Biden lose:
Bernie fell back in line fast enough that I don't think he'll be the target of Team D's ire should Biden lose.
You think Kristol has beclowned himself to the max, and he proves you wrong.  Did Joe McCarthy run for President against Truman? Did Robert Welch run against Ike? No.  But Bill will ride the Good Ship Biden into the water, confident his "conservative" donors will rescue him.
Once again  covers for Biden. First covering his criticisms over his senility by calling it "stutters" and omitting his actual seemingly racist comments - how blacks aren't black if they vote against him and saying blacks are less diverse than Latinos. Seriously Phil??
.It redirected to the Biden campaign, until about 12-24 hours ago. Now it redirects to "site unavailable."
I just donated $200 to Biden Harris in order to match the amount my son sent in today
I hope somebody or somebodies crash the crap out of it.  Well...  that is unless Team D crashes it without any help.  Which if Biden's streams are any indicator is highly likely.
Shouldn’t that be Biden?
that’s the argument that my sister-in-law used when talking to my wife tonight. Voting for trump because “Biden couldn’t do any better”. trump will get the majority of votes from this devout evangelical &amp; her circle of friends. Can’t have fact based conversation. Tone deaf.
Outside of merely being a political opponent the reason #Trump is mystified by #Biden picking #Kamala is he cannot fathom receiving criticism, reflecting &amp; reconciling w:the one who brought the critique. It’s not in him &amp; it matters #KamalaHarrisVP #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris
It wouldn’t help it whatsoever. Still need to not only win the Senate but get a strong majority and probably get more seats House as well before M4A can happen. So it’s not happening for the next 4 years regardless. Biden could opt for one term as well.
BIDEN IS EVERYTHING trump ISN'T.
Finally, someone who knows Canada's neighbourliness, eh?  Joe Biden's new running mate, Kamala Harris, is a Westmount High graduate | CBC News
Translation: White Woman will be submissive to their White Husbands in knowing, I'll keep Blacks &amp; Mexicans away from their neighborhoods. Also don't vote Biden because he'll allow a Black Man to allow fair opportunities to all races.   Trump's racism is so blatant &amp; disgusting!!
I didn’t know  was campaigning for Biden now.
Is Biden rocking a mullet?
THIS.  Finally, in 2020 we have Kamala Harris as the running mate to Joe Biden. A woman that looks like many of us who have never held a seat at the table and who have been under represented our entire lives. I shed tears last night. Better late than never 💕.
But smear ads that center around Biden’s failing mental state aren’t nasty...makes sense to me.
i am closer to biden ideologically than jorgensen so no thanks
trump KNOWS HE IS GOING TO LOSE THE 2020 ELECTION AND WILL DO WHATEVER TO NOT HAVE TO GIVE UP THE POWER N ATTENTION HE HAS.      KANYE WEST IS NOTHING BUT A INEXPERIENCED UNQUALIFIED NO CHANCE OF WINNING  trump TOY USED TO HOPEFULLY  DRAW VOTES AWAY FROM THE BIDEN/HARRIS TICKET.
AMERICA, IN A COVID19  CRISIS WHO WOULD YOU RATHER LOOK TOO FOR LEADERSHIP? BIDEN/HARRIS--PEOPLE YOU CAN TRUST IN WHAT THEY SAY trump/dense-- 2 GD MFin LYING SACKS OF ORANGE SHIT YOU COULDN'T TRUST FOR SHIT YOUR ANSWER WILL TELL A GREAT DEAL  ABOUT AMERICA AND IT'S FUTURE.
.I am. I think she'll be a bad candidate for #Biden and the #Democrats. I know he had to pick a black woman, but I didn't expect her. She's a loser.
WITH BIDEN/HARRIS AMERICAN WILL  FINALLY CORRECT/RIGHT IT'S ROYAL 4 YR F#CK UP KNOWN AS THE trump/dense RESIDENCY.
RIGHT ON HOLLY, TELL IT LIKE IT IS. trumps A COMPLETE ORANGE MORON AND ALL AMERICA SHOULD VOTE FOR BIDEN/HARRIS
Joe Biden's platform is the most progressive platform of a nominee in decades.  So mission accomplished? Let's restore humanity by voting Biden/Harris.  (And protect literal human lives from Trump's harm)
Fair point. So look at the platform being put forth by the Biden Harris campaign. Look at the anti-lunching law Harris put forth. Look  her policies on abolishing mandatory minimums and legalizing marijuana.
Or maybe they figure no one can possibly hide it any longer. It isn't as if Biden's breakdown is obscure.
Lies and fear-mongering. That’s all you got. Biden and Harris will restore hope, dignity, honesty, and democracy. Trump will continue to tear this country apart while he steals from us and lets us die while he plays golf.
I keep seeing repostings of Obama’s endorsement and congratulatory statement to Biden and Harris like thats supposed to mean something 🙃🥴 or we’re supposed to be relieved. He was symbolic (which is fine) in the same way Kamala being VP is (also fine). Both moderate af lol.
She is certainly qualified at 55.  Can she garner the votes Biden needs for the win?
Our Republican President couldn’t believe that Biden wasn’t vengeful for her questioning him during debates. Thanks VP Biden for being a bigger person!
No it’s an old picture. Biden was in Delaware all day and Harris was in California all day. They’re going to be together in Dover Delaware tomorrow.
...To another 4 years of Trump. After Gabbard exposed Harris for her hypocrisy she's going to drag Biden down worse than he's doing on his own.
It feels so good having Biden/Harris as a team. They will bring ethics back to government. They will bring back empathy. They will bring back fairness. And so much more.
At least Biden will try and hide the bad things his team does and not kill the gays. Harris will just try to lock up the trans folks though.
“Nasty to Kavanaugh”...is Trump campaigning for Biden/Harris now cause this sounds like a great endorsement?
Harris was my favorite, but all the women up for VP were good. Please people vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. They are a great team.
Hey, I hate that Biden is the Dem nom as well. He's incredibly problematic. INCREDIBLY. BUT...still going to vote for him over Trump in Nov. Because that's what we got. And if you don't because your upset about Biden, them congrats, you've contributed to four more years of hell.
Actually this is a photo op.  The difference is Biden didn’t need to shoot and gas peaceful protestors to hold a Bible upside down. He just rode a bike instead while Trump can’t even walk down a ramp.

* Why are you CONSPIRING with Russia &amp; Putin against Biden??? SHAME ON YOU.      #BillBarr    #gop
Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP is just more proof that cops and klan go hand in hand.
Because both have mixed records on criminal justice, the Biden/Harris ticket needs to take the initiative and talk early, often and specifically about reform. Then, when elected, they need to do it without reservation or deference to the DOJ.
Great, what I going to do with all the boxes of these Biden/ ghost of Eliza Hamiliton shirts I ordered ?
AMERICA, BIDEN/HARRIS HAVE PLANS TO FIGHT THE COVID19 CRISIS. trump n dense AFTER 7 MONTHS AND 160000+ DEATHS STILL HAVE NO NATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE COVID19 CRISIS. 1st ignored it Called it a hoax Said over by summer It'll just disappear WHO DO YOU WANT TO LEAD AMERICA'S FIGHT
Those people were going to vote for Biden no matter who he picked for VP.  She doesn't sway a demographic. She doesn't bring a better chance of winning any States. She instead of mitigating some of Biden's biggest problems, amplifies them.  Picking Harris is tactical idiocy.
BIDEN/HARRIS,,, AMERICA FINALLY  HAS SOMETHING IT CAN LOOK FORWARD TOO AFTER ALMOST 4 YRS OF PURE ORANGE BULLSHIT N LIES THAT HAS THE WHOLE WORLD LAUGHING AT AMERICA.
BIDEN/HARRIS=PROVEN WINNERS JUST WHAT AMERICAN NEEDS.  trump/dense=PROVEN LOSERS JUST WHAT AMERICA DOESN'T NEED.
Biden and Harris will kick your ass.
trump KNOWS HE'S GOING TO LOSE 2020 AND WILL YRY ANYTHING TO REMAIN IN POWER.     KAYNE WEST IS NOTHING BUT A INEXPERIENCED UNQUALIFIED trump PIGEON SET UP TO DRAW VOTES AWAY FROM BIDEN
I fully agree with you  Warren would have been an amazing President or Vice President. I’m hopeful that Biden will put her in a key position. I also think Kamala Harris is an excellent choice.
The average American voter is not ready for the first female Vice President of Jamaican and Indian immigrant parents.  Dumb move on Biden team.  Smh.
Biden picks Kamala Harris, his former 2020 rival, to be his vice presidential running mate
Biden/Harris 2020!! Let's Go!!
"BIDEN N HARRIS" A PRESIDENT N VICE PRESIDENT AMERICA CAN AND WILL BE  BE PROUD OF. THAT WILL BRING BACK THE RESPECT AMERICA DESERVES  trump n dense.  TWO SENILE  BOZO'S AMERICA'S IS ASHAMED/ EMBARRASSED OF. WHO HAVE DESTROYED ANY/ALL REPECT THAT AMERICA DESERVES.
Good Choice. Hopefully when Biden wins Sally Yates for AG and Susan Rice as SOS, have Schumer step aside and make Warren Senate Majority Leader. Let's put some women in charge for a change. It seems to work well in other countries.
Personally, Tulsi Gabbard. Nobody I know except for “vote blue no matter who” people like Biden even a little bit, and Tulsi undoubtedly has the power to draw in voters from across the line.  Of course, they wouldn’t have chosen Biden in the first place if they wanted to win.
I’m thrilled. Vote Biden-Harris.
Congrats on your pick!! I was SO hoping you would pick Kamala Harris! You two will make a great team! "Ridin' with Biden!"
It’s February 2021.   It is announced that Joe Biden can no longer perform his duties as President, and  takes over as POTUS. #BidenHarris2020
Trump just won a second term. Smh.  Your average American voter is not ready for the first female Vice President of Jamaican and Indian immigrant parents.  Dumb move on Biden team.
Okay honestly folks, Biden isn’t amazing and neither is Kamala but they’re significantly better than Trump/Pence. Like seriously I’m convinced some of you live in make-believe world where you’re still upset your favorite candidate didn’t get the nomination. Come on...
So Kamala, who did you sleep with to get to be Biden’s running mate? We are gonna have some fun with this! BJ and the hooker! What a team!
Senator Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick! Congrats, Senator!
I also appreciate that we know she *can* stand up to Biden when appropriate, as well as be a good teammate and work together afterwards.

YES!! Joe Biden here. Big news: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate. Together, with you, we're going to beat Trump. #KamalaHarrisForVP
BIDEN HARRIS 2020 LETS GO!!!!
My blood is boiling! How can we shut him up? Trump says men may be 'insulted' by Biden's female VP pledge #Biden2020
Interesting points
the VP pick could be Hitler's reanimated corpse and I'd still vote for Biden
I asked one of my buddies, what’s the worst thing about Trump. He said that he lies. He says he’s voting for Biden. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Scary thought: when Biden wins the election trump can start running for 2024.😳
I’d vote for Biden if he named a cabbage as running mate. Fortunately there aren’t any cabbages on his short list.
So crazy how much I bought into her bullshit and how quickly I forgot she existed after she endorsed Biden. I would say it was a good 2-3 months where I didn’t see anything about her on here. And then shocked at myself for how quickly I forgot about her.
So-called president drumpf forgets the word virus when he is talking about coronavirus. But yet he says Joe Biden is out of it.
Joe Biden/ Imminent .
I AGREE. THE DAMN CONVENTIONS ARE JUST A EXCUSE FOR GROWN UPS TO GET TOGETHER TOO  ACT LIKE KIDS AT A UNCHAPERONED  PARTY.     IT'S BIDEN N trump SO WHO NEEDS A CONVENTION? ESPICALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC?
DAMN OBVIOUS KANYE,  INEXPERIENCED UNQUALIFIED,  JUST AN ATTEMPT BY trump TO TAKE VOTES AWAY FROM BIDEN. ANOTHER EXAMPLE trump KNOWS HE IS GOING TO LOSE AND WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THAT.       SO FAR trump HAS ASKED KAYNE AND PUTUN FOR HELP, IS KIM JUNG UN NEXT?

Biden is apparently announcing his VP running mate this week! I won't lie that I'm secretly rooting for Michelle Obama who isn't even on the list!
I DON'T CARE who it is. I'm voting Biden period full stop. Trump is a cancer that needs to go. ❤
Dude, who are you going to vote for them? All this hate you spew for Biden only helps Trump... you don't see this??
you must be completely high or drunk or both. in the last few months, have you had the opportunity to watch Joe Biden try to carry/express a thought to completion?
The only reason that I plan to watch the conventions is that I'm expecting both to be a spectacular comedy of technical errors.  If Biden's streams are any indicator, the Team D one is almost guaranteed to come apart at the seams.
They could do virtual debates. Trump would be in Washington, Biden would be in his basement, the moderators would be in New York. One of the debates in 1960 was like that.
Hahaha, I’m joe Biden &amp; I forgot I insulted black folks. Not only that I was never ASHAMED of the Mass incarceration Bill; remember African Americans are not socially &amp; “mentally developed” he believed they belong in jail like heynas. Don’t vote JOE!
Oh man, but Trumpypoo said in his sensationalized, overproduced smear ads that Biden is weak and not fit for office! It’s almost like he was trying to divert attention away from his own failing health. 🤯
As another lifelong Republican, I like you am supporting Biden and the Democratic Party 100% with money and my vote! The Republican Party is a disgrace and should all be voted out of office for undermining the rule of law and supporting Trump’s actions.
As I understand, intel says a Russian agent in Ukraine is feeding bogus info on Hunter Biden to the committee Johnson chairs. No mention of Lindsey. Not quite the same as “being Russian agents.” I think they’re traitors to the bone, but let’s not get in front of the evidence.

My point is that for people in rural America their bubble is real. I’ve driven all over the five state area, and Texas recently, and I didn’t see any Biden signs either. Yes it’s a banjoland take but he’s not wrong about what he see’s in his bubble.
Talking about any kind of norms and Trump in the same sentence is hysterical. We have spent almost 4 years saying “but precedent is “... then watched Trump blow all that up. So insisting Biden does something cuz Trump does? Hahahahaha!
Because: you can’t take Biden winning Illinois for granted. Voting for a third party is literally going to do nothing to make either of them bend to your views. People need to be smarter in voting than expressing their brand affinity.
Additional information on #KamalaHarris I hadn't been aware of. (There were so many candidates for Prez that I tuned out the entire campaign!)  Rep. Eric Swalwell: Kamala Harris will be a great VP and help Biden undo harm Trump has caused  #FoxNews

Can’t tell if she is worse than Biden or not
Two of the three unions endorse Biden!

Joe Biden-"I just voted to make gay marriage illegal"!
Hey, I just filled out my request for an absentee ballot so I can legitimately mail my vote in. You are a con artist Mr. Biden.

- The so called editorial written by John Eastman is a racist letter to those who think a woman of color, born in Oakland, CA is not eligible to run w Biden. I am deeply offended that you would allow this blatant birther piece in your mag. Disgusting #BoycottNewsweek
Save you my opinions, but this article does a good job summing up where I (huge Warren and Sanders supporter) stand on the Biden/Harris ticket.
Consensus-building and ability to find middle ground were killed off by gerrymandering and unlimited campaign contributions made through anonymous shell companies.  Be great if team Biden fixed that. But entrenched, self-serving GOP &amp; Dem partisans killed off earlier efforts.
… Nobody cares about your opinion, and Kamala Harris will be a great vice president and a great president. She and Biden will really make America great again.
Who will be the actual power behind Biden/Harris really running the country? That’s the true info needed. Dr Jill Biden? Chief of Staff? These concerns make US look like a crummy  dictatorship. NOT WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR NATION.
A preview of Biden’s response to Trump’s animated video last night?
Are you ok with the fact that Joe Biden voted to make gay marriage illegal?
Trust us-Pence has plenty of material to use against Kamala.  Between her and Joe Biden they sent tens of thousands of African American males to prison needlessly.  And I want to hear her defense of Joe Biden voting to make gay marriage illegal.
You think Kristol has beclowned himself to the max, and he proves you wrong.  Did Joe McCarthy run for President against Truman? Did Robert Welch run against Ike? No.  But Bill will ride the Good Ship Biden into the water, confident his "conservative" donors will rescue him.

Kamala Harris has more experience than Trump has in his pinky 👉🏼. Are we a little shaken ??? It’s a pretty solid choice that will help Biden considerably ✊🏼.  I can hear the whispers and doubt brewing 🤔
Y’all think it’s a coincidence Crime Bill Biden chose Mass Incarceration Kamala? Dems will tell you Trump is a racist but look at ticket’s track record. We are screwed.
Gosh, apparently Biden needed to seek advice from Trump: "Kamala Harris is the meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful, MOST LIBERAL of anyone in the U.S. Senate, and I cannot believe that Joe Biden would pick her as his running mate."  (Trump e-mail)

My head just freaking exploded from Biden’s Lies!
Good thing you like her since she’ll be POTUS. Biden won’t remember who she is by November.
But smear ads that center around Biden’s failing mental state aren’t nasty...makes sense to me.
i am closer to biden ideologically than jorgensen so no thanks
If I were to vote it would be for Biden.  Trump is a liar and a divider.  So is Biden and he might be senile, so I might just be sitting this one out my Lloyd!!!  Minnesota will go blue I am pretty sure so I am just a human in this state
Trump or Biden tweet it to me
There’s a lot of fundamentals (and 22% uncertainty) built in.  Someone else pointed out that as the election gets closer, if things remain the same, Biden’s chances will increase.  If that’s true, I can understand why the model is where it is right now.
So all Trump campaign has is name calling.  All they have otherwise they'd have to bash policies the majority of Americans favor.  Oh, so they'll go with extreme policies that Biden/Harris don't even believe in.  Name call &amp; scare ppl.  I'm going to hate the next 80+ days.
.I am. I think she'll be a bad candidate for #Biden and the #Democrats. I know he had to pick a black woman, but I didn't expect her. She's a loser.
Has Biden recently turned Catholic? I’m curious as to why it’s trending now when he’s probably been a catholic this whole time? It’s just political season so anything goes I guess, I’m surely excited to vote now. 😒
Think of it this way, Nate’s model has Biden winning 93% of the time if the election were held today, Elliot’s is at 88%.  Slight variation.
Here we go! So happy that VP Biden picked Kamala Harris! I am energized!
Joe Biden has a racism problem alright - but he's going to beat it in November.
Indeed. Biden is "American centre" in my opinion, which American left is basically actually centre, so things are all backwards ;-;
I want to start by saying I'm not for Biden/Harris  However, if it is just a comparison of "lesser of two evils", yea Biden/Harris is probably better than Trump/Pence. But we will still be in a shit place with Biden/Harris in place
I am meh but still going to vote Biden
Or maybe they figure no one can possibly hide it any longer. It isn't as if Biden's breakdown is obscure.

Biden was a senator for a long time and is known as a super genial, get along guy. He’s going to want to work with the other side and make deals. What Trump should have done.
Donald Trump gave us four principled clemency grants (Johnson, Munoz, Hall &amp; Negron) and the 1st Step Act, which is more than people expected given his prior statements. I hope and expect that Biden will use clemency- and you should hope so, too.
Also, I think many of Biden's cabinet positions should be filled ASAP. Put a killer team together to take down Trump and begin the process of recreating the American Dream with decency and equality for everyone!

Kamala Harris chosen as the running mate. This is problematic given her voting record and it is not progressive ticket. via
Every time Trump or surrogate talks about Biden gaffes they should just play Trump talking about 1917 flu and it ended WW II.
Biden made the right choice asking Harris to be his running mate. Her debates with Pence should be good.

I fully agree with you  Warren would have been an amazing President or Vice President. I’m hopeful that Biden will put her in a key position. I also think Kamala Harris is an excellent choice.
The average American voter is not ready for the first female Vice President of Jamaican and Indian immigrant parents.  Dumb move on Biden team.  Smh.
Biden has picked Harris to be his VP. This ticket will be responsible for putting more black folks in chains than pre civil war
Biden/Harris 2020!  I'm feeling very positive! :)
Good Choice. Hopefully when Biden wins Sally Yates for AG and Susan Rice as SOS, have Schumer step aside and make Warren Senate Majority Leader. Let's put some women in charge for a change. It seems to work well in other countries.

A Harris-Pence debate will be far more interesting, and informed, than any Trump-Biden debate.
YES!! Joe Biden here. Big news: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate. Together, with you, we're going to beat Trump. #KamalaHarrisForVP
If the pick is truly in, Biden should make the announcement ASAP. The longer he waits, the greater the probability that the VP choice will be leaked.
It's almost like Trump is trying lose by even more than he already is among female voters....
Interesting points
Well said. Biden has to pick a VP that will work with him, not the " most popular dance partner".
the VP pick could be Hitler's reanimated corpse and I'd still vote for Biden
Just one of the reasons this #nurse is voting for #Biden in Novemember. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Children Are Not Immune
So-called president drumpf forgets the word virus when he is talking about coronavirus. But yet he says Joe Biden is out of it.
But if Biden picks the wrong VP, amiright?
Do his people really not tell him it’s 1918 not ‘17? Understand that happening one time. We all misspeak. But it’s every dang time. Biden makes an error and fixes it. This guy. Ugh. Is his staff so afraid of his wrath they’re willing to let him embarrass himself over and over?
He promised a woman. We’re getting a woman. Pete is trending because, I believe there was a chartered flight from South Bend to Biden’s regional airport (because, you know, #ElectionTwitter is 👀). Secretary of State offer?
It’s over for Biden.
Who cares if they can do the job.....just make sure it’s a soul sista! Biden is weak he will wilt I’m sure
The only man I would accept as Biden’s running mate tbh
I read someone’s comment that said he’s probably calling everyone in and giving them a face-to-face “Thanks for your participation. It’s not you” talk ..   Sounds like something Biden would do ...
Biden is apparently announcing his VP running mate this week! I won't lie that I'm secretly rooting for Michelle Obama who isn't even on the list!
I DON'T CARE who it is. I'm voting Biden period full stop. Trump is a cancer that needs to go. ❤
Biden’s Choice
you must be completely high or drunk or both. in the last few months, have you had the opportunity to watch Joe Biden try to carry/express a thought to completion?
If you support Trump, please unfollow me. Seriously...I pointed out on a thread (on FB) about Biden having a stutter (aka a disability) and someone used the "laugh" emoji. Really??  REALLY?  Deplorable much?
So Biden comes out of his basement for church and grieving for those lost. Trump comes out of bunker for ego trips and golf. No brainer who the better man is here.
60-40 is actually really good for Democrats in Hartland (I know, I know...yard signs don’t translate to votes). Looks like Trump won 61-32 in ‘16. Honestly, I wouldn’t expect to see any Biden signs out there.
Ok this might be the level of tweet I can expect Biden to have actually sent
They could do virtual debates. Trump would be in Washington, Biden would be in his basement, the moderators would be in New York. One of the debates in 1960 was like that.
Hahaha, I’m joe Biden &amp; I forgot I insulted black folks. Not only that I was never ASHAMED of the Mass incarceration Bill; remember African Americans are not socially &amp; “mentally developed” he believed they belong in jail like heynas. Don’t vote JOE!
Oh man, but Trumpypoo said in his sensationalized, overproduced smear ads that Biden is weak and not fit for office! It’s almost like he was trying to divert attention away from his own failing health. 🤯
I’d pay thousands of dollars for a front row seat at the Bible quiz contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump! 😂 #TrumpIsNotAChristian #TrumpIsDefinitelyNotEvangelical #SexWithPornStarsIsNotChristian
Joe Biden does not support defunding the  police you dummy
As another lifelong Republican, I like you am supporting Biden and the Democratic Party 100% with money and my vote! The Republican Party is a disgrace and should all be voted out of office for undermining the rule of law and supporting Trump’s actions.
Here’s a new one. My niece said her FIL sent a message to my niece’s daughter, saying that if she voted for Biden, he’d disinherit her. She’ll be a first time voter. She told him to go ahead and do it! 🤣🥰 Proud of her!
As I understand, intel says a Russian agent in Ukraine is feeding bogus info on Hunter Biden to the committee Johnson chairs. No mention of Lindsey. Not quite the same as “being Russian agents.” I think they’re traitors to the bone, but let’s not get in front of the evidence.
Thank you.  I was just going to tweet how this is a further move to dictatorship if EO is allowed to go forward.  If, as I hope, Trump is not re-elected, Biden is going to have a real task in putting the Constitution back together from the shredder.
Peter doocy will be VP running mate.  Biden-Doocy 2020.
Oh please! ODNI has identified Ukrainian Derkach as working with Russia to disrupt the election to elect Trump. You are accepting false information from Derkach to smear Biden in your Senate Committee. Not hard to figure out where you loyalties really lie.
Pray to God Joe Biden wins and we take back the Senate. We'll have to rebuild the State Department and our intelligence agencies. Who knows how many Russian assets are now in the CIA thanks to Trump?
Exactly. Most VP choices are announced just prior to the Convention.  This woman could be President at some point. If they go through rigorous vetting, all the better. A VP is a partner in governance. Regardless of our fave, Biden will need to work w her. It is his call.
Or China is backing up Dumpty's claim that a Biden win means being in cahoots with China, making Biden look corrupt. This is a Through The Looking Glass world now.
Biden isn’t gonna make it-stop obfuscating
This guy is going to make Biden seem out of it?
#QuestionAskedAndAnswered dept.:  I do, because Biden's VP pick is the Democratic Party's real presidential nominee.  #SurprisedIHaveToPointThisOut  #NextQuestionPlease
What? Bobby Trumper Jindal doesn’t like Biden? WSJ why do U even bother? Why do I?
I know whatsboutism is a losing game, but my son and I were saying tonight: imagine if Trump had said one of the things about black people that Biden says regularly.  The media would 24/7 bear Trump to a pulp.
How insulting and condescending to #BlackLivesMatter that the GOP believes helping #Kanye get on ballots will lure black voters to vote for him instead of #Biden.  Act of desperation for sure.
If Twitter calls out fake information then why doesn’t this get flagged as a lie because Biden couldn’t possible send a tweet.  His handlers should have to admit authorship to make this a true tweet.
Do you suppose he's going to challenge Biden to a Thigh-Q test?
