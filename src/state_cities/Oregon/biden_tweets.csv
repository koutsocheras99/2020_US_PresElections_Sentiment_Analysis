How do we handle this? If he is coming out and saying he's only doing it to "steal" votes away from Biden how does America not come out fully equipped to punish him? This can't be legal.
He's been a top surrogate for the campaign since the beginning of the primary. If Biden wanted to stop him from sticking his foot in his mouth to the press, he could.
We are not done!  We need to be proactive by talking to friends and family about why voting for Biden is so important and actually CASTING OUR VOTE is crucial for the future of our country. Volunteer for local campaigns, phone banks, and you will make a difference! We can win!
Americans know who you are at your core, and we‚Äôre going to elect Joe Biden to remove your racist stench from the Oval Office ... #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Lots of people are talking about how Trump is bad and very few people are being honest about Biden. There are simply more lies to push back on, and more of those lies are coming from sources that need the pushback.
Maybe Biden shouldn‚Äôt have spent the last forty years setting the stage for him, then? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Apparently Biden's dog is named Major, and it is perhaps a prosecutable offense if they are not releasing regular updates regarding this good dog, preferably in his voice, titled "Major News"
I have many political issues with Biden, but I‚Äôve always admired him as a person for how he coped with his stutter. I don‚Äôt talk about mine much (because it‚Äôs my business and no one else‚Äôs), but he hits the nail on the head here.
I think it‚Äôs sexist for Biden to limit his VP picks to only women anyway. It harkens back to Romney‚Äôs #BindersFullOfWomen. And it implies that a woman couldn‚Äôt be VP if competing against men.  It‚Äôs fucked up that this is the not-so-subtle message that Biden is broadcasting.
You could tell that Biden's climate policies were a joke well before they were ever published, but when he leaned into regime change in Venezuela, a goal of the oil industry, and said fracking jobs weren't on the table it became dumb to even pretend like he'd be good on climate.
You do realize the worst thing you ever say about Joe Biden is that you call him sleepy, right? Take a look at the plethora of awful and accurate things people call you.
Now the R's are trying to siphon the support for Biden by attempting to get Kabye West on the ballot. When D's flip the Senate, impeach Donny again and convict him and throw him out of the White House. Donny can spend the rest of his PATHETIC life fighting lawsuits
Pssst...I‚Äôm not a Biden guy either. Both idiots. No matter who is the ‚Äúculprit‚Äù (like this is some fun caper to be solved?), Trump bungled and didn‚Äôt take it seriously. Even he came around on masks (finally). Take it serious at first and jobs would have never gotten to this point
Vote for Biden.
Ummm. If trump thinks a presidential election can ‚Äòhurt God,‚Äô he fundamentally misunderstands the concept of God. For him, religion is just something he pretends to believe in for political advantage. Believe or don‚Äôt believe, but don‚Äôt lie about it

Trump and Biden are every reason we need a viable 3rd party.
When are the Biden deepfakes coming? October?
People who make lists like this think bad Lefty is anyone who doesn‚Äôt put a Biden sign in their yard.
Yes. Just one of the reasons: the GOP work hard getting rid of polling stations in areas they predict Biden votes, just to make this scenario real. #WeWillVote #Biden2020
No, what am I listening to on OPB right now? A bit on Biden's comments on race!?! Ok OPB, give trump equal time ü§£ everytime tRump says anything stupid about race give him that much coverage - 10 mins a day?!?!! Journalist DO BETTER!
What percent of Americans think Biden will be alive come November 3rd?
I dont disagree with your statement on 45. I find him to be very revolting in nearly every aspect. I just hate how people then become blinded to how horrible Biden is as well . Idk where people got the idea i liked trump...

I simply don't agree with that characterization of Biden, he generally handles questions just fine.
Looks like it was all progressives asking Biden to pick Bass so I'm ruling her out
2/2  The only person to blame if Biden doesn't beat the #OrangeTroll in November will be Biden. It's his job to make people want to vote for him.  Online trolls bullying people won't change minds.
And Biden just started opposing the Hyde Amendment in June of last year as he was planning another presidential run, he doesn't give a shit about abortion.
1/2  1. There is a lot less difference between Biden and Trump then people want to admit, and I think a lot of people are in denial about it.  2. She lives in a safe blue state, so it's irrelevant.  3. It only does harm if Biden and other Dems don't listen.
Biden is proposing a return to the Obama era tax rates, taxes that were already significantly lower than those we enjoyed under famed far leftie Ronald Reagan.
If Biden wins, I predict CNN will continue to talk about Trump for the next 4 years.
Sure we will. If we get the Greens to 5% we get matching funds. We pressure the Democratic Party to move left. Biden and Trump aren't the only options, and many votes in "safe" states will be wasted on them, when people could vote Green instead.
Yes, really, he's dealt in nepotism during his entire career in politics, and has taken cash for things like helping elect Republicans since he was VP.
Wow, it's almost like this is why the left really didn't want Biden.  Its almost like we wanted someone who wasn't a renown liar with skeletons in the closet.  Its almost like we remember 2016.  Its almost like BIDEN ISNT THE MOST ELECTABLE CANDIDATE.
'US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election' here:

Russia could hack Biden's campaign and the medias response will be "Why are the dem campaigns so easy to go after? Whats wrong with them?" or "are they in too much disarray?"
since this tweet had like 450 likes and counting I'd like to take this opportunity to tell everyone that even though he's awful and I hate him, you should vote for Biden because no matter how bad he is, he would've handled the past several months better, and you fucking know it.
I personally can‚Äôt wait for the debates...all the people saying Joe Biden can‚Äôt get through a sentence obviously haven‚Äôt been following along. He has ALWAYS gaffed, but he‚Äôs not an incoherent moron like Trump. Biden will crush him as long as he keeps his cool.
Trump aides frustrated by his ‚Äònonsensical‚Äô Biden attacks in Ohio: AP reporter
Same. I really wish more people in solid blue states would abstain from voting Biden. Hilary stans really clung to that 3 mil popular vote after she lost and I feel awful that I contributed to that number.
As a conservative, I must say that this is no longer something to smile about. You are facilitating husband abuse, Jill Biden! STOP IT.
The president has also said we should "look into" using sunlight internally to combat C-19, and that Biden will "hurt God". He retweets video from "doctors" who believe endometriosis is caused by having sex with demons in your sleep, and made up an invitation from the Yankees.
As much as i'm not enthusiastic with Biden, I at least can feel reassured that the american left in 2020 didn't make the mistake the German left did in 1932.
Imagine how the person's hair smells.  That's how Biden is going to choose.  Then again, a bucket of shit is smarter than Joe Biden.

the ODNI has publicly stated today that Russia is actively working on a disinformation campaign against Joe Biden, and a campaign in support of Trump. As a US senator, why are you collaborating with Russia on THEIR campaign.
Nina is just the best. Wish she was the VP. That‚Äôd go a ways towards Biden‚Äôs hemorrhaging of leftie support.
He's also, worse, imo, actively being negligent and just killing civilians. He's so unfit, he's criminally unfit. Biden may prove to be unfit, but he's also trying to be better, and already has succeeded. Donaldo just is selfish and weak willed. Worst American president!
Oh  I want to thank you so much. I've been a bit down today, since  is still occupying OUR Whitehouse, but seeing this gave me the best belly laugh I've had in months.   Thanks so much for the comedy relief.    2020
Every time he opens his mouth he says something racist, classist, or just plain stupid. He's taken positions to the right of Trump on numerous foreign policy issues.  He's barely coherent, and when he does make sense, what he says is offensive. Biden is #BlueMAGA nothing more.
Hah, and there are legions of people who think the virus response is going to be significantly different under Biden.
Every time I see someone post about ‚ÄúBiden/Rice‚Äù I have to take a moment to breathe and consciously reassure myself they‚Äôre talking about Susan Rice and not Condoleezza. Because Condoleezza would be a really believable choice at this point.
Who's really in the bunker?!  Biden... but they run that rhetoric about Trump locked in the basement of the White House...   oops!
Huh? Stray Y chromosome? Like Biden dropped his Y off? I don't get it, what was the question again??? Those are not my shoes....cabbage, never played it before...prunes? where did I get prunes? no, it was a VW bus, on fire, chasing a horse down one of those Seattle like hills...y
I'M BAFFLED! So we're going to wait till Jan, hoping Biden gets elected, before anybody does anything!?!? At least 150,000 ppl that didn't have to die die!?! This is a F'ing emergency! There has to be some kind of emergency action, al la Navy doctor overrides the ships captain?
No. But we can laugh at Biden for being racist though..

Last night I asked my dad if Trump could do ANYTHING that would disturb him enough to stop supporting the maniac &amp; his answer was, ‚Äúno, not if that means a vote for Biden.‚Äù  Guys, that‚Äôs fucking horrifying. Fear tactics work. Trump supporters will stand by him ‚Äúno matter what...‚Äù

The Black turnout for Biden has to be one of the most searing indictments of white supremacy I can think of.  Blacks voted for Biden because they knew whites would be *most likely* to support the most racist candidate in the field. And it‚Äôs an astoundingly accurate calculation.

On the right, we have a bucket of runny shit. On the left, a decent choice. But S.E. won't abandon her bucket of shit unless Biden is perfect. People like that are called Shy Republicans. They don't want to see the disgust their choice produces, so they pretend to be persuadable.
Could‚Äôve had a candidate that was genuinely doing well with Latino voters  because he cared instead of relying on a Contra death squad supporting republican to sway them with an endorsement.
The difference is that Biden would never even contemplate taking help from China to win whereas we know how ‚ÄúRussia, if you‚Äôre listening‚Äù Trump would react.
I agree I would love to see a Biden-Warren ticket!
Oh wow. Thank you! I think that's my first ever  üòä
of all things I am I am a Marine. I don't pull the uniform on anymore at 04, but it is still in me, and I see so many wrongs. how can a democrat sit and know Americans will be slaughtered like animals by animals? I can't grasp the concept and not apologizing for it either f Biden
I feel like i'm on PINS and NEEDLESS every time he speaks. Yes, it's unfair Trump can say whatever he wants and gets away with it but I cannot be holding my breath every time Biden gives an interview.
As a latino, I do not support this couple. They should be ashamed of themselves. They very well know Trump doesn‚Äôt support them yet they support him. Also their ad is trash. They just say Biden is going to be a bad leader, that‚Äôs it! Superficial attacks not worth your time.
Oh boy Putin, you got caught with your hand in the cookie jar didn't you? And we're going to everything we can to make Biden win, and then, you're gonna get slapped like the dwarf bitch you are. And I'll tell you what, your pet troll  is not going to enjoy this.
Please. Who knows when it was taken down and why. Also, why would she still have a 2020 store when Biden's been the nominee for months?  Furthermore, if she's agreed to a cabinet position it would be a different reason to shut it down.
Serious question: Trump is a racist who sexually assaults women. Biden is a racist who sexually assaults women.   How can Russia, China, or Iran possibly make them look any worse as candidates?
True that, Trump blocked Chinese Air travel early on, Getting bashed by the Left "Pelosi/Biden" which they ultimately retracted their comments and praised Trump for quick swift Action. -
Joe Biden needs to commit to this before I vote for him. Day one, close down detention centers Period.
Data ALSO hypothesis "Trump voters won't admit being Trump voters to a live pollster," which, if true, would lead to Biden underperforming live polls, and slightly underperforming or matching computer/robo polls  But we're skeptical of that since it's been wrong many times
Biden smears himself, we‚Äôre just keeping tabs. #BlueDevolution is making fascism real again.
If joe biden could actually hurt god, like cause physical pain and misery to god, I would vote for him twice. Once via mail and once in person.
Biden! Can! Be! Pushed! Left!
Is that why when I bring up his terrible record and weak policies, liberals call me a Russian asset? Putin didn't make Biden do all those bad things. They are just exploiting his weaknesses.
Maine for Biden, and Sara Gideon!
People will do anything to steer votes away from Biden. However, I reeeeally doubt anyone voting to Kanye would be voting for Biden in the first place.
Sigh... Men tell women what they should or shouldn't say is not a good look.   Also his race is relevant. He is a high profile black celebrity. His race and celebrity are being used to siphon black voters from Biden.
I'm like just now seeing the Joe Biden gaffe and it kind of feels like conservatives are trying their hardest to make a huge deal out of this. You can talk to me when BLM protests aren't being tear gassed anymore.
His job is to raise stock prices. If stock prices are going up, he wins. My guess is that the Trump mob is cooking the books on the economic numbers, because they know if there's a stock market crash, Biden wins and the GOP loses the Senate.
The only things denigrating Biden are his record and the garbage leaving his mouth.
joe biden is absolutely dead. we have not seen or heard anything from him directly the dnc is covering it up that man is seriously deceased
They're not just random individuals though, they are people that Biden has chosen to elevate. I agree with Armando, the headline is sensationalistic (and probably not written by Traister) but the content is spot-on.
are you saying sniffing little girls is joe biden's right &amp; not his privilege?
Something I‚Äôve been thinking about re: online influence campaigns is that won‚Äôt they eventually cancel each other out in their influence? If China wants no Trump and Russian wants no Biden, their efforts will appear organic and have no more influence than if they hadn‚Äôt meddled.
Biden‚Äôs public appearances have sure quieted the voices of centrist democrats that have been dragging Sanders and his supporters since March.  Buyers remorse?
Biden doesn't support defunding police. Ask any Portland Protester.
who does biden pick for vp
I hope you aren‚Äôt voting for Biden then.
Trump paraded a lying little pissant in front of the country who mislead and caused a total US shutdown. And now he‚Äôs pushing hard for a fast track vaccine. That bothers me. Biden bothers me more so I‚Äôll vote trump but doesn‚Äôt it trouble your soul a little?
Dude, you're the one saying "minorities wont' vote for Biden." I'm just going on the terminology you're using.
Every time Joe Biden comes out of the basement for an interview, why can't he just be chill and not say racially loaded things? He and his handlers have to know that Trump is losing this election all by himself and Biden should just keep his mouth shut but he can't help it.
Minorities overwhelmingly backed Biden, you lying tool.   I'm not telling you how to vote. You can throw away your vote all you want.  But I am telling you that attacking Biden pre-election only serves to help Trump. This doesn't bother you, of course. You want Trump reelected.
The Democrats have also been suppressing the vote. You‚Äôre not going to get progressive policy from Biden, and you‚Äôre not going to get voting rights from a party that tries to take candidates off the ballot unilaterally.
US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. -

Biden wants to cut SS Biden would veto M4A if he got a bipartisan bill. Biden put in jail many non-violent  offenders and won‚Äôt legalize cannabis.  Those are Biden‚Äôs ambitions.
You're beating a dead horse:   Voting for Biden is a given. It's not an argument. You're trying to create a division where there is none.   We need to talk about what we want, focus on people who will represent us, like  and PUSH corporate DEM's to do the right thing.
lmao you're so fucking mad about being called out on your enabling fascists  again: do all the fucking criticism of biden you want starting the day after the election. Until then, you're just helping Trump
Stop trying to fuck over Biden
I'd be absolutely intrigued to meet a real human being who, a month ago, was done with Trump and was ready to vote for Biden, and then over the course of the past 30 days thought, "Wait, I changed my mind. I like what Trump has been doing lately, and I want 4 more years."
Every white or brown person I know is voting for Biden.
Undermining the only alternative to Trump *is* helping him.  Again: Shut up until November 4, and I'll believe you. But until then, undermining Biden is helping Trump win.
Theory: pollsters nervous about underestimating Trump and being blamed for being "wrong again". They consciously or unconsciously put finger on the scale for Trump.   Worse pollsters have a bigger effect  If true, we'd expect Biden to beat polls in Nov  Can't know until then
President Biden and Congress will be busy, working to repair the damage from this Republican regime.
The vetting is not even close. One has literally walked through the fire of a presidential campaign. The other has not. No one energizes the Democratic Party like Harris. Biden can win with anyone but if he wants to win the house and senate he should pick Harris.
The minorities/poor people who overwhelmingly voted for Biden in the primary, you mean?   How about you shut up until after the election then? And on Nov 4 resume all the criticism you want?  (You won't, since your objective is to make Biden lose / Trump win, of course)
Nope. Joe Biden will build a great admin and HRC would‚Äôve been a really great President !!
Completely agree! I also have a child‚Äôs vision about how politics work and can‚Äôt discern between obvious differences in ideology! You and I are exactly the same! Just like Biden and trump!
Can't wait for all the righteous indignation to erupt when Biden announces his running mate.
idk fam it sounds like you and I agree more on the immorality of billionaires than Joe Biden and I ever will
lmao you'd think that biden supporters would want to FORGET his 1988 campaign
And compared to Biden and Trump, he is easily, clearly the most mentally cognitively capable. He is literally the only one of the three actually capable of doing the job of president!
Yep. It's clear Biden's fixers have reworded and walked back his original comments. Easy to see when you compare what he says unscripted versus what is printed afterwards. What a joke!
What comes out of Biden's mouth and what comes at a trump's mouth, Are not even comparable Anyone's allowed to make a mistake long as they corrected trump never does his mistakes are intentional
You can't even see what's in that photo. Was that picture taken with a potato?  But here is a clear picture of Biden and his KKK buddy.   Leave the memes to the right and we'll leave the lies and insults to the left. Deal?

Biden has a stutter. Otherwise no different from the rest of the political establishment.
I'm not worried about West taking votes from Joe Biden. If I were a Black person I'd be very insulted by all of the people worrying about West. Black people are far too intelligent to fall for West or trump (who is üíØ% behind what West is doing I promise you). Calm down sister.
But - I would not trust him to actually leave And I don‚Äôt want Republicans against Trump to switch their votes from Biden to Pence.
Running interference for Biden. Shame.
Biden attends Mass &amp; takes communion, like many other American Catholics who violate Church doctrine on certain matters, such as contraception. The Right has cafeteria Catholics, too, who consider themselves devout, but, e.g., support the death penalty. Not our job to judge.
Biden could pick Angela Davis as his VP nominee and it wouldn‚Äôt be enough to mask his innate racism, which is deeply encoded into almost every strand of his political DNA.
Just a thought, if Trump's poll numbers are in the tank weeks before the election, does he replace Pence with Nikki Haley?  Especially if Biden picks a very dynamic woman for VP. #Biden2020 #2020election #trump
Yea I‚Äôve been trying to make my husband legal for years. It‚Äôs so expensive and now he‚Äôs finally towards the end where he has to go back to his country and I don‚Äôt trust Trump that he could come back. Biden please fix it so he doesn‚Äôt have to leave us.
Because he‚Äôs deliberately trying to take votes away from Joe Biden
As an avid anti establishment and Biden Critic, I strongly recommend reviewing the records of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Biden isn‚Äôt at all perfect, nor am I a fan, but both records prove that Trump is focused on leadership from the past. Biden is not. #Biden2020 #NotmeUs
the point is that he is the current elected president of the United States. Never said I liked Biden either.

Are you fucking kidding me? Biden could pick a wet rock for all I care. Trump is 100% dangerous so VP pick is meaningless. Why would you ever give Trump any chance by writing in? This is no game anymore.
We can see with our own eyes that Biden isn't well; we should have compassion for him.  My compassion may have to wait until AFTER he stops acting a fool and being a tool to help Trump get re-elected.  Remember Hillary Clinton and the damage she did.  Have compassion for America!
So tRUmp who is an unapologetic bigot and white supremacist thinks Biden doesn't deserve votes from blacks? Seriously, #TrumpIsNotWell
You can‚Äôt even pretend Biden is worth my vote.
Wouldn't put it past them to run obvious hacking propaganda campaigns to make it look like China is meddling in our elections on Trump's behalf to create another 'asset' narrative as a means to embolden more votes against him, since they know Biden is far more pro-China.

I don't know a single Republican voting for Biden. I occasionally heard such but never heard an actual person say that. Seems like only Democrat shills would say that to make us think Biden is winning. Trump will win in landslide. No question.
It almost doesn't matter- best to ignore this spoiler for Biden.  Target demographic for KW is the "disenfranchised extreme left"as a protest vote- but he doesn't have any real plans or policy, just noise and distractions.
Oh yeah, I remember how Biden pushed for the death penalty for the Central Park Five by taking out a full page in a major publication, all who were wrongly accused and jailed. And the litigation for viloatng the Fair Housing Act.  Oh wait, that was Trump, the pillar of diversity
Saying That Joe Biden Is Against God Is Not Only Not True But Is Blasphemous!!!! Donald Trump Holding The Bible Upside Down For A Photo Op Is Sacrilegious?? I Would Bet $1,000.00 That Trump Has Never Read A Single Passage Of Scripture In His Life??? So The Religious Right What??!

I like Felix‚Äôs assessment of the 2020 election choices in latest Chapo episode: we are at the end of American imperial hegemony. Bernie was a negotiated withdrawal, Donald Trump is belligerent denial of reality, and and Joe Biden is beaten acceptance with nostalgia for good times

So who is running against Trump on the democratic side? Biden thinks he has a chance? Unreal.
Damn, this comment's gotta be the most racist thing I've seen since the last time Joe Biden spoke.
Ouch.
I came across an account today that follows &amp; reposts both rose &amp; MAGA feeds, uses sexist &amp; racist language, &amp; claims Biden is not ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù enough. I went to block the presumed Bot &amp; found he has over 3,000 followers. If that ain‚Äôt proof our educational system needs help...
If Trump would shut up for a few hours, Biden gaffs would get more traction. Biden has always been gaff-prone. It seems Biden can say anything because all anyone wants to hear is the latest bs from Trump.
Biden is such a sleepy weakling he can hurt god...
Joe Biden and Clarify, in the same sentence?  That‚Äôs an oxymoron!
Bernie would have at least been able to say I tried and the house democrats and senators stopped me, so we need to replace some of them, Biden will be working in lockstep with house dems and the senate to do nothing.
People hate Trump, and in combination with the pandemic that's likely enough for this election, but structural problems in American lives aren't going away and once Trump is no longer around to blame, that blame is going to fall on Biden and other Democrats if they don't deliver.
This is an incredibly articulate statement. I‚Äôm not a big Biden fan at all. I‚Äôd prefer Kamala as the nominee for President ( or the dream of  ) but I will crawl over glass to vote for Biden. Trump is that dangerous and even more for minorities.
We'll see, Democrats got their asses kicked in 2010 after running on big meaningful change and then delivering a GOP healthcare plan.  Biden isn't even pretending that he's anything other than Obama's third term.
Joe Biden was baptized Catholic, but his actions and voting record say otherwise.
Surely both of these smart capable women will be in a Biden administration one way or another... If I were choosing it would be Harris/VP and Rice /SOS or NSA...
Joe Biden is the perfect personification of what ails the Catholic Church today.
Is that why Biden is more popular with college educated voters? Also are you somehow being classis and racist by assuming Blacks and Hispanics aren't college educated?  Do you have a diagnosis? I mean that with actual concern.
Now he‚Äôs just stringing together random trigger words. Joe Biden is against God? And can hurt Him? Wow. And no religion, too.
Trump said Biden ‚Äòhurt God.‚Äô Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith.
Biden keeps speaking for the Black community (with foot in mouth) and gropes children. #YouAintBlack #HidinBiden #BLM
Biden Tells Staffers To Pick Any Black Person For VP 'Since They All Think The Same Anyway'  via
Honestly, watching Biden repeatedly put his foot in his mouth &amp; coast through his campaign, I think there‚Äôs a high possibility Trump will be re-elected. He‚Äôs awful and dangerous but Biden offers us so little. I‚Äôm voting Biden but I‚Äôll never forgive the DNC for foisting him on us.
"Ana" not "Anna"  "Team Biden" not "Team Obama"  Do better.
This is pretty clearly not referring to every Biden voter as blue maga. It‚Äôs specifically about Biden voters who are claiming Clinton lost because of Stein or some such nonsense.
Also, a man who is using a mentally unstable man (Kanye) to try to manipulate the Black community into voting for him.  It‚Äôs not going to work.  Trump is a racist.  Joe Biden is a good and decent man.
- It‚Äôs Ana - It‚Äôs Team Biden
Is he trying to lose his base to Biden?
Anyone waiting for a candidate to beg...it ain't gonna happen. Isn't stopping fascism enough??!! That's among the billion or so reasons to be Ridin with Biden
Biden is the dead cactus. That‚Äôs exactly why the VP pick matters. I believe Joe to be ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù enough to actually pick a Republican Woman as his VP thus handing the presidency to team R when he resigns due to senility. The VP pick is everything and will be bought &amp; paid for.
Okay Paulie, cite evidence that Biden doesn‚Äôt attend church, isn‚Äôt Catholic, and isn‚Äôt more religious than Trump.

I hate the double standard. Herr Trump is a racist/sexist gaff machine, yet every time Biden misspeaks it‚Äôs time to make hay. Preposterous.
Biden seems to like the walls in his basement....
Pretty sure he‚Äôs a Democrat who‚Äôs worried by Biden‚Äôs slurred, wandering, aggressive speech.  The debates are going to be a national embarrassment.
People way overvalue how important any campaign message was in many elections. Obama didn't win because "Hope and Change" was an uniquely perfect message. He won because Bush got us in two unsinkable wars and crashed the economy. Biden is winning because Trump killed grandma
Hannity: Biden doesn't know what city he's in  via  Hollow Joe is sad &amp; Dimms should be embarrassed to let him continue, but Trump hate drives the Left.
You don‚Äôt have any obligation to defend the dumpster fire that is the Biden campaign.
Joe Biden is not a racist. He merely holds tightly to racist viewpoints, and constantly makes racist comments, and has a history of pushing legislation that disproportionately attacks people of color.
Radical left of Biden- you say! Joke!  Trump‚Äôs a fascist dictator- destroying American founding principles and our democratic republic- be ashamed for spreading dangerous lies. The rich need to pay more taxes!
I would wait days in line to vote for Bernie. I likely won‚Äôt even vote by mail for Biden. My state is safe, and I refuse to reward the  for cheating us yet again of a leader we NEED so they can retain their power and cushy lifestyles.
Liar- Biden doesn‚Äôt stand for the radical left-wing. It‚Äôs just because your a radical right that you want to spread lies and misinformation
Unchristian that this would be used against Biden AND what a deflection from the real racist!
I absolutely agree that Biden is appealing to centrists.  He provides all of the austerity and crushing of the poor that Trump provided, but without any of the embarrassing headlines.
Joe Biden jjust used the N word live on camera. WTF is wrong with him??
Joe Biden offended all blackface Americans with his divisive comments. Shame sham shame on you, Joe.
Thank you Joe Biden for that 1994 crime bill
S.E. Cupp shouldn't try to make voting for Biden some big personal sacrifice. We get that she doesn't agree with everything Biden supports. Neither do I but I'm not voting for Trump or writing in Bebe Neuwirth on my ballot.
You say, with an anti-semitic slur.  (Which is odd, considering that Biden is Catholic. But, you're not known for accuracy).
Luckily Obama isn‚Äôt the signal flagger on who is and isn‚Äôt racist.  Biden is systemically racist and somewhere in between unapologetic and carelessly mistaken regarding every racist idea he perpetuates.  For example, unapologetic re: ‚Äúcrime‚Äù bills / mistaken re: black + latinx
For all the God loving Christians in the back who fear Joe Biden.
You post about Biden saying racist crap and you constantly say "China Virus". This really hurts the Asian Americans and is not safe seeing how your followers believe anything you say. Just call it by it's name, stop spreading hate and do your job.
I can't even fathom why we picked Biden in the first place, so I'm not going to pretend to understand what voters are basing their decisions on.
Biden is backed by Republicans. You‚Äôre most certainly playing their game. Their electoral strategy is to capture both parties, and you‚Äôre not even willing to oppose them.
No Joe Biden isn't racist only 50% of what he says is racist the other 50% doesn't make any sense if he was on his game like you claimed he is he should have no problem debating Trump and Pitkin Trump apart so if he's still on his game as you claim you should be pushing him

Joe Biden did not write this.
It's because Trump thinks he is God. And yes, Biden is going to lock his ass.
People are all "Biden doesn't write his own public statements", and I'm like "has any major presidential candidate in the past couple decades?"
I think Andrea Mitchell didn't reread her tweet before posting. But Obama is helping advise Biden. btw, Obama has no desire for another term. He's happy where he is.

Just like Biden but the left tends to have *slightly* better mental cognition.  C'mon,  C'mon man, you know, the thing, c'mon!
Im black and me and all of my friends and my whole family are voting for Joe Biden.
You do you, but let us know if you change your mind. Can‚Äôt buy it myself. IMHO Biden is just as big a threat as Trump, but will make folks complicit and complacent. I think that‚Äôs potentially even more dangerous. We‚Äôre on a slippery slope and Biden just adds to our speed.
I didn‚Äôt know that Joe Biden had the power to challenge a god.
If Biden elects to run with a corgi, you should still vote for him. Not doing so is actively voting for corruption, bankruptcy (moral and actual) and a 1000 dead Americans a day. Just vote for a human in November.
I think we need to start ranking your lies.  This would rank with the top 10.  Keep trying to find a way to discredit Biden.  Maybe you could try for 30,000 missing emails.  That worked last time.

I think it's a longer shot than 2016, at least as of right now. But debates will change a lot. People who don't watch things like the recent Yahoo News video watch debates, and there's no way Biden pulls off hours of sounding sane.

Id love to blame it on dementia but we all know that Biden is a racist. Not that hard to find his previous racist remarks.
Plagiarism in Joe Biden's 1988 presidential campaign. Now he can't remember. The Trump campaign needs to use this video to show plagiarism Joe Biden!
Typical. Makes a racist remark yet everyone looks away. If trump said this it would be the end of the world. The Dems are hypocritical. Especially biden. He has a rich past of being racist.
I have a hard time believing Biden uses the word "monolith" in a sentence in a coherent way. Someone's writing this for him.

If you‚Äôre on the fence about whether to vote for Biden or just not vote for Trump, please, read this:üëáüëáüëá
And Trump is "pro-life" just because he *says* he opposes it?!? üòÖ Look at his UN-Prolife behavior in other ways! BTW, Biden said previously that he is opposed to abortion, but that he cannot &amp; should not force his beliefs on others. That's democracy whether ppl like it or not.
I am willing to consider donating to Joe Biden‚Äôs quest to kill God, though.
Biden pushed legislature that supported segregation. He supports increasing funds for police.
Remind me again how many guns Obama &amp; Biden rounded up after 8 YEARS?!?
"I'm not a Biden bro I just have a posting career lately that sees me defending Biden in multiple threads for months on end"
I am only getting going! He starts a war to become a war time president, perhaps provoking a conflict with Iran. Again saying that God visited him an a dream. Gets #DisbarBarr to start an investigation in Joe Biden, of course Barr would only be too happy to comply.
Joe Biden's staff wrote that apology/explanation. They recognized his gaffe manufactured a response for him.
Not a surprise. Kanye doesn't want to be president, he wants to help Trump.
LMAO yeah I still think Biden will win, but not by THAT much ffs
These blunders and Freudian slips from Biden no matter how much they try to back pedal them, come from a long standing assumption that the Democrats feel the black community vote is a given. Imho.
Biden‚Äôs going to hurt the Bible?! üòÇ
So according to Trump, Joe Biden, a devout gun-owning Catholic, is both weak yet more powerful than God.  Got it.
Show me on the doll where Joe Biden hurt God.
I mean, I‚Äôm mad about Trump‚Äôs apathy in the face of the pandemic, but biden/pelosi/schumer aren‚Äôt exactly impressing me with the fire in their bellies either.
Biden voters are just MAGA without gym memberships
Twitter doesn‚Äôt tell me which tweet you are answering. So, I don‚Äôt know what I said that might have made you concerned, but I definitely know if Biden is elected, the whole world will feel the negative consequences. If something I said implied differently, apologies.

That‚Äôs nothing compared to what people from spaceships will do to malignant narcissists.  Biden will be informed once the aliens have left our system that they collected a few for study, and left a document saying they knew that we could not do that to other humans, but they can.
CNN has an article about Trumps thinking being impaired but makes no reference to Biden talking about black people not being diverse. Fox legit rips on Trump way more than CNN covers anything negative on the left.
No ‚Äúsorry.‚Äù You know who you are, a racist. üëáüèΩ

45s claim that Biden will ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù is not just a ludicrous statement about Biden...it also implies that in his mind he is ‚Äúhelping God‚Äù...he indeed sees himself as an American savior of sorts. All of this is antithetical to the kingdom of God.
The test isn't necessary.  Nobody credible is accusing Joe Biden of being completely demented.  They only have people who are observed displaying the symptoms of dementia take that test.
Why is he so uniquely special? He‚Äôs doing everything that the Republican Party, with Biden‚Äôs help, has been working on since the 1970s.  Biden has supported and cooperated with that agenda. Why is he better?  If you say ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù in your answer, you lose. Biden kills my wife too.

If Biden is capable of hurting the all-powerful creator of the entire universe, like daaaamn! I thought he was just a bumbling racist egotistical moron!
Nobody and I mean nobody really believes Joe Biden is gonna push a radical left agenda. #weirdstrategy
The classic position of a Catholic like Biden.  Hurt the Bible. Hurt God.
So according to Trump, Joe Biden, a devout gun-owning Catholic, is both weak yet more powerful than God.
He won‚Äôt get away with the predatory rapist stalking that he did during the Hillary debates when he debates Biden.
Anyway, definitely voting for Biden regardless, but I'm not letting go of a feminist woman or man (e.g., Castro) winning the primary and then the presidency in the regular way on the merits in my life.
Yes, for sure! I don't mean to take anything away from her and (perversely) I talked to so many women phone-banking who voted for Biden because they were terrified of seeing their faves destroyed like she was but didn't care if he was.
What we deserved this year was a primary between the candidates of the future where the two geriatric white men stood down rather than sucking up all the air in the room. I am hopeful we can have that in 2024. (and this is not to say I'm opposed to supporting Biden's VP pick!).
Sorry, but ZERO conservatives will be voting for Biden the buffoon.    In fact, no one in their right mind would vote for Biden‚Äôs brain.
Except for when Biden says that black people aren‚Äôt as diverse as Hispanics
Trump has done more for black people since 2016 than Biden has ever done. Biden has always been a true white supremacist
Only the first one was racist. The other two are taken out of context.  The Latin comment was about the various countries they come from (Latin America) which isn‚Äôt the case for many black Americans DUE TO SLAVERY.  Biden saying Americans are racist against Asians isn‚Äôt racist.
the misogyny from the Trump campaign/cartel once Biden names his VP is going to be unreal. on a scale that makes ‚Äò16 look tame. just brace yourselves
Plus the whole rant about Biden taking away the 2nd amendment. And saying with Joe we‚Äôll ‚Äúhave no guns, bibles, no anything‚Äù.  And even though he claims Joe is in cognitive decline, he still says Biden is powerful enough to hurt God. He‚Äôs is down to cult &amp; kin supporters only.
The only person Biden could pick that would change my vote would be Trump.
Say what you will about Biden, at least he apologizes... which really is such a low bar of expectation for the two old white men who are running for the highest seat of power in this country to meet.
Tezlyn says Bernie Sanders is "WEAK" for selling #MedicareForAll pipe dream cos it won't happen under Joe Biden presidency. Trumpy!  68% of Americans WANT #MedicareForAll.  EVERY #ExitPoll Americans said REPLACE #ACA with #MedicareForAll and that was BEFORE #CoronaVirus Pandemic
If you believe that Kamala Harris should not be Biden‚Äôs VP pick because she‚Äôs ‚Äútoo aggressive‚Äù...unfollow me now!   THIS üëáüèºüëáüèº is what America is going to need when WE THE PEOPLE clean out the sewage Trump left behind. #BidenHarris2020
Still lying to your death-cult I see.
other white folks on my tl saying "if you don't vote for biden you don't care about oppressed communities" lmao okay bc he plans to do a lot of good for them
I honestly don‚Äôt know what I want more, Biden to win and trump end up in jail or Trump to win to teach the  a lesson.
"Joe Biden's faith is at the core of who he is; he's lived it with dignity his entire life"...  That's all you have to read. It doesn't take a "woke" person to know this is a bunch of malarkey.

Biden should invite all the accusers to the debate, might not be enough room with social distancing.
'God could my dad drive an ice cream cone. Oof.'  -Joe Biden
No.  Biden is hurting Biden.
wake up.. that's not how Joe Biden got votes.. in fact, Joe Biden earned ZERO delegates from the first 3 contests... then Obama stepped in and put a stop to it because the PEOPLE said they want to replace #ACA with #MedicareForAll and that would have messed with HIS LEGACY.
Biden is the most corrupt public servant of all time and he got caught. Why would we want him as president.
I don't think Biden sleeps with porn stars. Donald is the one that hurts God
What's Bidens record? Name one thing he has done? Why go to such lengths to defend a racist like Biden?
Only fools and opportunists confuse Biden‚Äôs maturity and humility with weakness. No one is perfect, but someone IS a narcissistic, sociopathic megalomaniac, and it sure as heck ain‚Äôt Joe.
One of the issues of the day is that there's a range of political views within the Black community -- as in any community -- but liberals and centrists often privilege conservative Black voices as representing the whole. So that's part of the problem with what Biden said.
I want the bumper sticker...‚ÄùBiden 2020 ‚Äî He‚Äôs against God and Guns!‚Äù
What if Joe Biden shot someone on 5th Avenue would people care then?
I feel we as a party need to be more pragmatic  and less puritanical. Biden's not perfect. Harris is not perfect, but they're who we got and they're better than the incumbent. Simple as that.
And that‚Äôs not even on a policy level (which I disagree a lot with). I dont think Biden is the president to staunch the slow creep of fascism.
üíØ. And I frankly just don‚Äôt think Biden is up to the challenge of this moment.
Let me get this straight.   Joe Biden basically states that black Americans are all the same, on camera, multiple times...  And everyone is worried about how POTUS pronounces words?  ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°üá∫üá∏üíØ

If you vote for anyone other than #Biden it is a vote for #Trump.
No one who votes for him was ever going to vote for Biden
I think it‚Äôd depend on the degree. I‚Äôm dating a Bernie voter as a Biden voter. But neither of us would date a Trump voter or even a Romney voter.
Media needs you to think Biden is inevitable, landslide Joe.
The fake-"progressive" scum on twitter are already losing their collective fake-ass shit over the possibility that Rice will be Biden's VP pick with RawStory's piece about her divesting herself of her Netflix stock.
Biden said ‚Äúno you don‚Äôt need to toot cocaine to have fun at the sock hop!‚Äù and it wasn‚Äôt even his weirdest quote of the day.
Your party's candidate just today said that african americans have no diversity. At least fox news reports that. Your socialist news channels like msdnc won't even report that biden literally said that in an interview
Biden‚Äôs tweets would be way better if they were written like a newspaper issuing a correction.   ‚ÄúEarlier today, Joe Biden made some comments...‚Äù

So sad to see Biden. Why does the Dem party keep pushing poor candidates? Same problem w/A.B.C. (Anybody.But.Clinton) Trump IS still our best choice. Promises kept-he‚Äôs done a great job.
It's obvious why GOP wants a short term skinny bill: if they lose in Nov. and pandemic is still raging, they will do everything in their power to obstruct and sabotage a Biden admin so they can pass blame for their failures to govern.
True, but it's not that clear cut. "Biden...opposed some parts of the law, even while he helped write it. ...he reportedly called a three-strikes provision ... 'wacko' and illustrative of Congress‚Äô 'tough on crime' attitude."
They are hoping he takes votes away from Biden.ü§¨
45 IS INSANE.  Donald Trump claims Joe Biden is 'against God;' Biden aides call Trump a hypocritical divider
So, by trump‚Äôs account Biden is against God and guns as if God is a big proponent of the NRA.
I agree, but at this point I would prefer someone qualified to a fresh face.  Also, when Biden is inevitably impeached/resigns from cognitive decline, I would rather Rice in the oval office than Harris.

To be fair, literal transcripts of most people will make them seem much less coherent than they seem live. Verbal pauses and fillers are everywhere.  But since the context is about whether Biden is slipping, editing out numerous stumbles without comment is an interesting choice.
Actual Biden: "Anyway, I am, uh, I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical and mental fil--my physical as well as my mental fil--fitness..."  Article Quote: "I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical and mental fitness..."
Joe Biden lacks the mental capacity to serve as a president, yet he‚Äôs powerful enough to get rid of God. Okay, got it.
Biden‚Äôs going to get roasted! It‚Äôs not even fair üòÇ
Trump, Biden, LaPierre; STFU!
I worry about that, too. Rice is the best qualified IMO but if Biden wants to win over any of the right, Benghazi will turn them away. I think she‚Äôd be better as CoS or Sec of State.
I hear God is in the ICU. Biden must have got him good.
Joe Biden is so religious that his crime bill expanded the federal penalty for crimes not involving murder....
If closing arguments are: Biden/Rice and Ebola/Benghazi vs Trump and Covid that‚Äôs an easy argument to make. ~10 Americans died between Ebola/Benghazi. It‚Äôll be well over 200k American Covid deaths by Election Day.
i dunno man, according to him, biden's the one out here hurting god
Kanye confirms the obvious: That he‚Äôs trying to hurt Biden &amp; help fellow nutjob trump. But, honestly, anyone dumb enough to vote for Kanye was probably a trumpie anyway.

LaPierre, Biden, Trump; STFU!
Yeah, I‚Äôm honestly not convinced if I‚Äôm one of the candidates that I *necessarily* want to be Biden‚Äôs pick
And at least Biden knows how to use quote marks. You use of them on ‚Äúdumb‚Äù is dumb.
Hmm. I wonder who African Americans favor in the presidential race? 80% Biden and 6% Trump.
As a Man if Latin origin, I am appalled and offended to not be thought of as a homogeneous voting bloc like the rest of black america, Biden needs to step up his racism, how else will I know who to vote for?
Well Crazy Joe Biden did it again. Makes the case for Pat Paulsen or Gais Baltar.
The most I expect of biden at this point is, potentially(!), a semi-competent path out of pandemic purgatory.
Biden could choose Snail for his VEEP and I will still pick Biden!
I'm impressed by the intense editing here to make Biden sound more coherent in the write-up than in the actual video:  Video Biden: "I'm so forward-looking to have an opportunity..."  Article Biden: "I‚Äôm so ...  looking [forward] to have an opportunity..."
Settling for Biden gives zero incentive for the dnc to change their bad behavior and start pushing better people. You have what? 70 million? 80 million? Democrats in this country and the one you‚Äôre expected to rally behind is Biden?
He blocked me for telling him why his entire theory of supporting Biden to push him left was crap.
Your President remains basically clueless in regards to what it takes to change a constitutional amendment. Biden or anybody else ever will get the 2nd Amendment changed. Legislation might limit some guns, Ammo and magazine sizes, but take them away never.
Are you f-I g kidding me??? At this point it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs VP pick that will have you decide to vote against the most corrupt, dishonest, uninformed, destroyer of our Republic ever to hold office?? EAJE THE FUCK UP!
At which point you get to my perspective which is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden but I will anyway because the alternative is so much more terrifying‚Äù
Doesn't want to do this anymore, he's desperately trying to gaffe his way to freedom from evil Democrat handlers. But there's no escape, they'll keep covering for him.  #Biden
Biden is definitely a Catholic, but the Catholic Church may no longer be catholic.

I've scene more Bernie signs than but that's not surprising... There is no excitement for Biden... Unlike Hillary or Obama... Biden wins Oregon... But if people here aren't excited for him... He has a tough hill to climb...
Back in 2008 Obama was the Exciting Candidate. He chose Biden as the Experienced Insider to ground his message. But Biden is not an exciting candidate. He is Return to Normal Guy. He will need a running mate who will motivate people.

I will cry tears of joy‚Äîand on January 21, help the administration of President Biden with all the strength I can muster.
I wish Biden would just pick a VP already. This long run-up feels needlessly combative for some reason. The ticket should have been Warren/Harris, but since it's not and we're all just... voting for Biden, just pick one! Preferably Warren or Harris. They are all qualified women.
Your father would be voting for Biden.
If you can't say the name, you can't make the claim.  I've seen a lot of people quoted as "insiders" who are about as close to the Biden camp as Trump is.

I've been worried about this kind of thinking from Biden. He doesn't have to do anything other than let the indictments against Trump and his family proceed once he's out of office.
All you're saying is they can shove anyone down our throats, because the alternative is Trump. That's already been done with Biden. This pick will probably determine who heads the Dems party, and maybe who is president, through the next almost decade.

Biden's not against 'energy', he's for 'matter'. BLM as an example.
Again, wrong. One said she was told about harassment, not rape. The fifth (I‚Äôll assume it was her brother that you cited) was not quoted in the article. Every accusation against Biden is for creepy, unwanted touching and Reade (coincidentally a Putin supporter) said penetration
He really out here saying Biden is gonna attack and dethrone god huh?
Guess The Recount hasn't listened to any of the Biden interviews or Pelosi' press conferences.  Seem to be a trend the Politicians don't speak English anymore.
I will take an even odds bet right now that the next Dem presidental nominee will be whoever is Biden's VP. So who Biden picks as VP is huge huge hugely significant.
Nobody is saying you're incapable of voting for Biden.  Just pointing out that supporting Biden means supporting the fascist approach that he represents.  Voting for the blue fascist to remove the red fascist is not a solution.
Biden is a centrist who is not campaigning on the values of democrat voters. Biden does not back M4A, legalization of marijuana, or defunding the police/police reform.

We literally just saw Biden win the primary despite being relatively out of step with the mainstream of the party on some issues mainly because he was once the VP. Yet people still think the VP is unimportant
Biden or Trump, the result is the same:  We fight them with everything we have.
I‚Äôd bet she‚Äôs not alone. Republicans will reliably pick party over country every single time. It was true in 2016 too: pussy grabber&gt; Hillary. At least then you could argue Hillary appeared corrupt. If you can‚Äôt vote for Biden in 2020 after 160,000 dead and 33% GDP decline- FU

please NO #SUSANRICE. The potential president after Joe Biden ISNT Susan Rice. Karen Bass is. She and  have plans to restore our nation. They‚Äôve both proven they‚Äôve delivered &amp; will continue
Okay, #PresidentPhotoOp &amp; both of your Corinthians, tell us again how Joe Biden hurts the Bible, you #Trumpocrite pile of petty jealous traitor trash
Biden isn't the choice most of us would have made given our druthers but to say that he isn't much better than Trump....
Nope. He has never been accused of rape, full stop. 3 of her 5 witnesses said they were never even told about it. Making sexual advances and then stopping when realizing that the feelings are not reciprocated is not rape.
I only wish I could count on Biden to attack and dethrone god. üòí
Looking forward to my timeline filled with folks that have a newly acquired thousand followers where they have to explain why Trump and Biden are both bad
Yeah Trump says Biden will destroy God. We can't have that.
I would force myself to wait if it was for the right candidate, but definitely would not wait in line to vote for Biden.
What if both Trump and Biden get covid and Kanye is the last candidate standing?
Biden can pick The Rock or a rock for this VP and it will still be better than Trump and Pence. Are you even serious with this argument?!
Is there a way that  could have  committed?? He is a threat to the country and running just to fuck up Biden and help Trump. Do the right thing, Kim, cause you know it's just matter of time before he blows up your family
Joe Biden loves black people so much, he just wants to give them a big old 9 minute bear hug right around the neck.
Have fun with that, I guess. We'll be over here building a party that doesn't cater to the corporate fascists that are funding Biden and Trump.  I want to stop Trump, but I also want to stop Biden.  You can't fight fascism by voting for fascists, whether red or blue.
That's why I'm not sending in my 2020 IRA contribution until it does.  I'm counting on their dirty tricks so they can buy low to only profit on the Biden rebound.
While the nation awaits Joe Biden's VP nom, might we suggest a few for consideration? #baonpdx #nwsl
Our local cops are covering their badges and assaulting our citizens en masse with impunity. Biden has said nothing to indicate that he finds this problematic.  Anarchists peacefully protesting are folks he considers legitimate targets.  Again, how is Biden better?
The real message about Biden and Obama they are selling is "Democrats are godless" despite all the time they went to church. Which I'm always surprised anyone buys.
also, not for nothing, Hillary Clinton  Hillary and Biden and Obama are all three GENUINELY religious people, with a spiritual practice and regular faith traditions and a deep foundation of knowledge and theology  wild to see that none of that matters
Lost some Big name Politicians that I was following. Graetz, Jordan Huckabee, Marshburn etc. But picked up Wyden, Merkley and a Biden supporter. It'll take me a day or two to figure out.
He‚Äôs making Biden sound fucking awesome
Biden says out loud that he would veto Medicare For All if it was signed and placed on his desk.  There is no reason to suspect that Biden will be better.
My dog would be an adequate Biden VP pick compared to ANY chance Trump gets reelected.
Wow. Millions infected and out of work, no rule of law any longer, a fully corrupt administration headed by a drooling mafia-boss-wannabe, and you won‚Äôt vote for Biden unless you approve his VP choice? You just lost a fan.
Kamala Harris was perfectly positioned for him in all ways... except she‚Äôs a cop right at the moment anti-police sentiment boiled over. Good luck to them, would not want to be on the Biden campaign team üòÇ
I absolutely despise Trump, but if the Democratic Party  nominates Biden they are asking for this, and they will deserve the consequences.  Biden is not fit to be the nominee and the sooner we #ReplaceBiden the better.
Biden is a prime architect of the legal framework that permits Trump to exercise authoritarian tendencies.  Biden is also a prime architect of numerous overseas conflicts, and is compromised in ways eerily similar to Trump.  The differences aren't as stark as the similarities.
I love and respect Ted Cruz, but if Trump can beat him with Trump‚Äôs dirty style of debating, then Biden will be like a dog playing with a rag doll
Ben Shapiro warns Biden 'falling apart' after bizarre interview, would be 'ripped up and down' if Republican  #FoxNews
That's awesome.  At least Biden won't even know he is being bashed LOL
Lmao you think trump is going to do any better!? Why does trump get a pass? Wake up! Biden may not be the best but he is &gt; than trump without a doubt
You'll vote Blue. Whether they win or not we could all be damned. The reality is that Biden and Trump work for the same people, and prefer the same policies. They just argue about who to blame for their failures.  I'm not expecting Biden to change his stripes. Why are you?
Yeah he cages children, tells people to drink bleach, enriches himself at the detriment to the nation, panders to Nazis.... but if Biden pick a girl that‚Äôs too icky, it‚Äôs a deal breakerüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑfuck outa here
Love this! Let's lean in to Biden being the only Democrat boomers like and get Florida on election night.
The Green Party already has ballot access in enough states to win the electoral college.  If you want to look at Biden's numbers on social media, be my guest.  Either #ReplaceBiden or #VoteGreen #BidenIsAFascist #BidenIsARacist
I used to think that way too. But I no longer believe it‚Äôs possible to break our binary system simply by throwing away votes for the presidency...  To be clear: I loathe our two party system! But in 2020, the only sane choice is Biden. 2024 we can be idealistic again.
Biden is just a way to continue the slide into fascism.  Crime Bill, Patriot Act, Bankruptcy Bill, and so much more.  Not to mention Biden's penchant for overseas conflict.  You really sure he is the lesser evil?  You really sure you want to vote for evil?  We must do better.
is that video of Biden talking about cars supposed to make him seem charming and not sad
The behavior also draws attention to their own limitations (e.g. "Biden can't think straight, he's cognitively impaired) - it's just  constant projection.  It's exhausting, and narcissists never stop doing this; you can set your watch by it and know exactly what's coming.
I don't think Biden should debate Trump. Why? Because you cannot carry on a real debate with someone who has NO regard for truth or anything fact-based. He's a lying asshole &amp; of less value than a penny postage stamp.
Switch parties and I will put you in as Biden‚Äôs VP choice. You can get what you want done from there.
"I heard you kids were talking a lot about cops lately, so I'm going to give them a raise and I'm making a cop my VP!  And they say I'm out of touch.  Pfft." - Biden, probably.
Will joe Biden pay for the destruction of black communities?
Between the two, only one was subjected to a cognitive test by doctors who were concerned his cognitive ability, and it wasn‚Äôt Biden.    This is what you‚Äôre puffing your chest up about???  PERSON. WOMAN. MAN. DESPERATION....
My family, friends, and community are just as screwed with Biden as they are with Trump. Biden might even be worse.  You would vote for Hitler if he was a Democrat running against Trump. That's the sad part.  #NeverSettle
I'm very, very, worried about God right now. He text me saying he's concerned that no one will come when he dials 911 if Biden is elected. "What am I supposed to do, send my Son out there to die for others??"
Show me, on the doll, where Joe Biden hurt God:
Biden will confiscate anyway. BTW gun registration isn't needed. Democrats will check Visa/MasterCard ammo and gun accessories sales records. Gun show attendance records at public facilities. Gun magazine and organization membership lists, etc.
Campaigns are literally the *only* thing Ted Wheeler cares about. He doesn‚Äôt wanna be mayor, he just wants to be hipster mayo pete and get a nice cabinet gig. Maybe Biden can put him in charge of teargas!#teargasted
I don't see that much downside, but I don't see any upside.  If you like Biden already, you're fine with Rice.  I don't see her shoring up any category at all, and she's not a "retail politician" that we know of--and that might help a bit.
So compare Biden's anti-Blackness to Trump's anti-Blackness.   With Biden there is hope for change despite his personal views.  With Trump there is certain change to his personal views.  Which do you want?
Shit, somebody better warn God about Joe Biden.
absolutely cannot wait to see how we defend "Biden will hurt God" hurry up weird con army
Biden is the reason Trump had the authority to engage in these fascist tactics. Rewarding the Democratic Party for kneecapping a whole generation is not the answer.  If you actually oppose fascism, you oppose it regardless of party affiliation. #NeverBidenNeverTrump

Thinking about doing a üó≥ presidential election episode üó≥ on  where I talk with a Trump supporter about why Trump and not Biden.  No arguments. Zero debates or subtle jabs.  Just a nice, friendly ‚Äòagree-to-disagree‚Äô conversation amongst friends.  ... (1/2)
No matter what Biden does, he‚Äôs still 1000x better than Trump.  #AnyoneButTrump2020
It‚Äôs a stupid question. That‚Äôs why you get blowback. Better question: since Trump is a liar, a criminal, and an impeached Occupant what good reason would Biden have debating him? (My answer: debating him legitimizes him, ergo, do not debate)
Biden wants to throw trillions to the ‚Äògreen energy‚Äô scammers and to high tech to buy their support.
Probably wants to let bad Econ news, Trump musing about delay in election stew for another week before grabbing headlines.
Biden wants to throw Trillions to the corrupt ‚Äògreen energy‚Äô Industry, and to High Tech to buy their support
Biden won‚Äôt refuse, Trump will.
Trump mocked for warning of economic crash if he isn‚Äôt re-elected: ‚ÄòYou already made the jobs disappear‚Äô   (Have you noticed that his campaign commercials always warn that Biden will put the US into a situation like what Trump's has already done?)
It‚Äôs not just Trump supporters. I was called an idiot by someone insisting Biden will be just as as bad as Trump. Some people are too cynical for their own good.  There‚Äôs also the need to be right and make others wrong which so many people so quickly fall into. All about ego.
So tired of people that insisting this country will be just as bad with Biden as President. The cynicism and apathy present here is appalling.
Realistic? Reality is whatever we want to create. Electing Biden is a small step in a huge process. Everything begins with a vision. If we sell ourselves short before we‚Äôve even started, then we‚Äôve already lost.
I've noticed that most of Trump's campaign commercials just point out how much better Biden is than Trump.
Good luck with your baby. Don‚Äôt use that as your excuse to not support Biden though. Your support seems very limited.

Three people were charged today for their alleged involvement in a massive Twitter hack earlier this month that took over the accounts of prominent users like Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Elon Musk and used them to promote a bitcoin scam.
They are combing all the available video and photos looking for something to use to discredit Biden. It‚Äôs laughable that the best they can do is this. He‚Äôs my age. We have a lot of ability left and we‚Äôve seen a lot of history. (My abilities are not political, unfortunately.)
Trump's supporters are combing through photos and video looking for images of #Biden with his eyes closed. Why? They're desperate, and they have nothing.

It was right after the Iowa Caucuses, is my guess, and I suspect that's a campaign aid hurrying him out to his next appointment. I think the reporter is asking him about his loss in Iowa. Just guessing, though. (You can read the sign in this shot: "Biden Works for Iowa.")
The sign says, "Biden Works for Iowa." I'm guessing it was after the Iowa Caucuses. I suspect he had to be dragged out of his campaign office by an aide because he had a schedule to keep. He's replying to the reporter as if he had just lost Iowa. Just guessing, though.

Lots of people are talking about how Trump is bad and very few people are being honest about Biden. There are simply more lies to push back on, and more of those lies are coming from sources that need the pushback.
Pssst...I‚Äôm not a Biden guy either. Both idiots. No matter who is the ‚Äúculprit‚Äù (like this is some fun caper to be solved?), Trump bungled and didn‚Äôt take it seriously. Even he came around on masks (finally). Take it serious at first and jobs would have never gotten to this point

the ODNI has publicly stated today that Russia is actively working on a disinformation campaign against Joe Biden, and a campaign in support of Trump. As a US senator, why are you collaborating with Russia on THEIR campaign.

Trump. I know. But it‚Äôs the lesser of two evils. And Biden is BAD
Id love to blame it on dementia but we all know that Biden is a racist. Not that hard to find his previous racist remarks.
Typical. Makes a racist remark yet everyone looks away. If trump said this it would be the end of the world. The Dems are hypocritical. Especially biden. He has a rich past of being racist.
Joe "the racist" biden
Biden needs to pick a VP soon to handle diversity stuff before his verbal shitposting catches up to him. I mean Trump has lowered the bar low, but there's a limit for independent voters.
And Trump is "pro-life" just because he *says* he opposes it?!? üòÖ Look at his UN-Prolife behavior in other ways! BTW, Biden said previously that he is opposed to abortion, but that he cannot &amp; should not force his beliefs on others. That's democracy whether ppl like it or not.

Why is he so uniquely special? He‚Äôs doing everything that the Republican Party, with Biden‚Äôs help, has been working on since the 1970s.  Biden has supported and cooperated with that agenda. Why is he better?  If you say ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù in your answer, you lose. Biden kills my wife too.
Trump has done more for black people since 2016 than Biden has ever done. Biden has always been a true white supremacist

Biden was against school integration and said that racial integration policies would cause his children to "grow up in a racial jungle."
Tough on real crimes. Biden crime bill locked up people for life and ruined lives with no hope of getting rehabilitation. It caused MASS INCARCERATION. It most especially hurt black and brown people. It‚Äôs disgusting that he can deny it now.
I greatly respect  and I have a lot of respect for what he is doing, but the words "binary choice" are just wrong. There are at least three candidates for President better than both Trump and Biden.  #NeverTrump #NeverBiden

I don't think Biden should debate Trump. Why? Because you cannot carry on a real debate with someone who has NO regard for truth or anything fact-based. He's a lying asshole &amp; of less value than a penny postage stamp.
Not Republicans but Trump's lawyers!  He is trying to divide the votes to keep Biden from a victory.

This could peel away Republican voters that were considering Biden. Timing on this was bad.
This is really concerning. The strategy is to pull off one to 2% of the black vote in swing States like Wisconsin and Ohio away from Biden. Is there anything happening within the black community itself to counteract this measure?
Sundown Syndrome, you mean?  We call it "Alzheimer's Disease" now but it's still very real.  A friend who was an elderly care nurse says #JimCrowJoe has all the symptoms.  Why is Biden saying the Black community is monolithic?
The timing on this is terrible! Republicans that were considering voting for Biden will now peel off. Why are Dems so willing to shoot themselves in the foot in an election cycle.
What do you feel Biden will do about the issues #BlackLivesMatter is fighting for? Do you believe Black lives matter to Biden?
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt treat women as sexual objects for one!! Trump has had everything given to him, threatens people for other things, lied and cheated and he‚Äôs failed at all businesses he‚Äôs own. It‚Äôs taken executives at banks and others who invested with him to bail him out!!
He is pending on the ballot in Wisconsin. They want to pull students away from voting for Biden.
Bernie Sanders was never pro-segregation. He was actively against it and was arrested protesting housing discrimination in Chicago. Desegregating housing would have also solved school segregation.  Equating Bernie and Biden on race is really dishonest.
She's saying Biden is a white supremacist who favors locking up all the Black men because he thinks they're junkies.  Better?
Comparing Warren and Biden to Bernie Sanders on race is insulting and either intellectually dishonest or very uneducated on actual policy.  Warren and Biden are white supremacists.

I want to be clear about something: I will vote for Biden this fall. Is he my first choice? NO. Our primary hadn't happened before everyone else dropped out. He's our ONLY real choice. I'm not happy, it's not ideal. But until the left can be really united, this is our choice.
You‚Äôre kidding yourself if you don‚Äôt think the crime bill hurt blacks much more than whites and target blacks. Watch how Biden speaks and what a disgusting pig he is the way he speaks of black children!
That‚Äôs an area of vast difference between progressives and Biden and Bernie. They both want to give the cops more money. They‚Äôre wrong.  The cops have too much money.
Two weeks ago, Joe Biden was being kept safely tucked away. He recently went on tv again.  What do you think?

Biden needs to debate Trump, which they will never let him, because it‚Äôs going to be a huge train wreck. #BidenHasDementia
Trump lowered the price of insulin and Biden is against #MedicareForAll, so I doubt he‚Äôs a one issue voter.
No one is speaking in Milwaukee. They chose to speak from their respective cities because of Covid. He‚Äôs not hiding in his basement. That pic that Trump touted is photoshopped.
Yeah I noticed that the last time I watched it. How disgusting! Biden is an awful person. Even with dementia, he can‚Äôt help himself from showing his true thoughts on black people.
Sorry, but Biden is clearly anti FDR. This bullshit is offensive.
Has been changed and it‚Äôs been so many decades! Democrats like Biden did things like the Biden crime bill that sent soooo many black men to prison. The 3 strikes you‚Äôre out laws also!
I‚Äôll be unpopular and point out the way Biden has dragged this out and waited has largely contributed to the internal strife about his pick is imo

Are her ‚Äúdances‚Äù signals to Biden that it‚Äôs time to say something stupid and racist again?
Alzheimer‚Äôs is a very specific type of dementia. Dementia is a brain disease. It‚Äôs not a mental illness. Unless Biden is diagnosed, it won‚Äôt be known what type of dementia he has specifically.
let‚Äôs face it. You have a distinct opportunity to affect billions of lives and direction of the population. Join Biden for election. Establish help to ease process burden. We need just, thoughtful sanity in US and beyond. Regards.

Joe Biden is a racist. He always has been. Look up the Biden crime bill. And, there are countless videos where you can see him saying the most racist things. He is a white supremacist.
Biden is going to actively break the left. If necessary, he'll purge the Dems the way Obama did. Dems lost 1K offices while Obama was President and it wasn't because they were "too ambitious."  He let people lose.
CNN is part of the Biden campaign for Obamas third term.
I assume I can't just pick "who do I think should be President" in this scenario (probably Romney - sorry :) ). Of plausible Dems before Biden limited, Klobuchar (who I would have preferred over Biden for POTUS). Between Rice and Harris, I'm not certain. It's hard for me...
Who? I know that the Dems think it will get Biden voted into office, but it‚Äôs doing the opposite.
Biden won't go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
It's no different than Joe Biden giving paid speeches on behalf of Fred Upton when Upton was running for re-election. It's no different than Beto O'Rourke refusing to campaign against Will Hurd.  It's a big club and they're all in it. They're protecting the senior members.
I‚Äôm not okay with that. I switched parties 2 months ago, after I saw how insane and evil the Dems are. But, if I didn‚Äôt and was voting blue, I can‚Äôt imagine being okay with voting for dementia Biden and assuming who is running the show is someone I like.
I'm intrigued. Who, exactly, are these voters that a) take the time to vote; and b) think "Biden was my guy, but Yeezy is on my ballot!"?   (and who are the GOPers that are willing to spend money on this idea?)

Wasn‚Äôt Biden friends with a KKK member or leader?
Ok. Trump has 25 allegations by women of sexual misconduct or assault. He has been recorded on Howard Stern and in other interviews making these misogynistic statements and those that sexualize his own daughter. You have videos of Biden hugging girls and kissing their heads.
I voted for Bernie in 2016 and would have in May if that was allowed in Oregon as an independent.  However as a Black male I can‚Äôt contemplate voting for IT and his White Supremacist agenda.  This time its Joe Biden or face the phase two of a 4th Reich.  It‚Äôs that serious.
"November 4th is too late. We should hold Joe Biden accountable now."  -    I really have to wonder why  is waiting for him to win. They should be at his door right now and demanding he sign on to Bernie's platform across the board.  Or no votes.
. source: Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic presidential nomination.
It appears that the Dems and MSM have infinite passes for Biden.
Truthfully I like she and Elizabeth Warren the best.  But Joe Biden won‚Äôt go wrong with any of the 8 women he is considering.  Gretchen Wilmer is also impressive.  I am Black but don‚Äôt believe he HAS to select a Black woman...selecting a woman who could run the country is #1!
In all due respect for Biden- why should democratic candidates be tested, show birth certificates, taxes and be held at a higher standard than the corrupt baffoon in office?
Also Biden: C'mon man, are you a junkie?
Purely in terms of strategy, Harris seems like the obvious choice for Biden (not who I would prefer). Passes C-in-C test, voters know her to enough of a degree that it prevents defining her, least likely to depress any bloc of voters. Leaves election as referendum on POTUS.
Could he cede now so Biden can lead us out of a pandemic?
Me: Joe Biden is not the best the Democrats can do. Liberals: What do you mean? Me: Dementia, for one. Liberals: That's a Bernie Bro hoax!   Hold my beer.
If they take their month recess and leave us hanging out here NO ONE will vote Republican. They would return in Sept to all schools reopening or not, with no plan, no plan for funding us, no plan for testing, but lots of lies about how awful Biden would be for us.
The media is not covering, Biden is kicking trump's ass without straining. And, since you have a bumbling idiot that lies constantly for a candidate‚Ä¶
And progressive #BLM activist  beat corrupt time server  There‚Äôs going to be real pressure on Biden from Congress!
The way I heard it, Reps are encouraging him because they believe that Black voters will defect to him from Biden.  So shortsighted and dumb.
I ran some polls about it, Twitter leftists like Teachout next best after  I will admit that, but I like  because I trust him to fight Biden because of his history of fighting Cuomo.  He was anti-Amazon before anyone.
It‚Äôs this simple:  is trying to preserve the GOP majority to give the Democratic Party a built in excuse for not passing progressive legislation if Biden wins.  #ChuckoTheClown needs a serious primary challenger from someone with legislative experience.

Shucks, Joe Biden will be available after the first week of November
No, the movement took over the Republican Party and elected a "moderate Democrat" President in the guise of a conservative Republican and he turned out to be the fash.  Now the conservatives in both parties want to replace him with far right Joe Biden.
Exactly. After they realized the media wouldn't be able to look the other way if he won South Carolina, they fixed SC for Biden.
Biden still thinks he is VP

Tell Joe Biden: Make Abortion Access for All* A Top Priority
Yes, he had to compromise significantly with conservative Democrats he should have played hardball with. After he made his deal with the RW Dems he still didn't win any GOP votes.  Biden was telling him to deal with them. Yes, that's on him.
That doesn't really sufficiently address that ridiculous response though.   shouldn't Biden be able to show he cares more than the #OrangeTroll if he wants to be President?
Biden's platform committee already voted on #MedicareForAll and they voted it down. So unless he takes personal action, yes, it's certain #MedicareForAll will not be in the platform.
Some Biden supporters were way more offended than Biden ever was.
If there was a way to tack ‚ÄúBe Smart‚Äù above, and a ‚ÄúVote for Biden‚Äù below, might be an improvement.  I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get some looks that change from smiles to frowns or frowns to smiles. :)
No, he's butthurt because I said he and Joe Biden didn't care. Did you see anything from him that looked like anything but an excuse not to care?
Don't waste your time trying to convince trumpers.  Recruit new people, independents, free thinkers and ex-Republicans to vote for Joe Biden to replace Trump &amp; GOP.
What about the people who already don't have any coverage at all or are severely underinsured because of the ACA?  You're still ignoring them. Like I said, you and Biden don't care any more than Trump did. You just want to check off an insurance box.
Health insurance isn't a guarantee of health coverage, particular under the ACA. Many of the people who will "lose their insurance" already can't use their insurance due to huge deductibles, and still have to pay huge premiums.  Joe Biden isn't offering to fix that problem.
Looks like she hates Biden and Trump. Who can blame her for that?
Check Biden‚Äôs basement.
I almost want to know who Biden is considering 4 AG More than I want to know his pick for VP.
Where did you pull out that completely meaningless and obvious statement?  Everyone knows that. Why pat yourself on the back?  Biden is in control of the Democratic platform and has a great deal of say in what happens after he gets elected. So why doesn't he care?
That‚Äôs a good question. The problem comes from people not being as stupid as politicians want them to be. They know that, if healthcare is a right, then #MedicareForAll is the minimum required.  Biden keeps saying healthcare is a right. Dem primary voters were fooled too.
It‚Äôs true. He doesn‚Äôt. Neither does Joe Biden. Why aren‚Äôt you pushing him on health care, if you care? ü§î
If you don‚Äôt pick demographically correct you‚Äôre racist and/or letting Trymp win?  Fucking stupid on their part!  I‚Äôm voting Biden no matter what because I DESPISE Trump.  You want my vote ONLY? Or do you want a vote, a campaign contribution, volunteer, activist and enthusiast?
Adam Schaffer‚Äôs of course!  Warren should get VP to coalesce the party(finally a PROGRESSIVE!), have excellent policies, and also get an activist base and fundraising that Biden won‚Äôt with ANY OTHER of the options.  Harris as AG and Warren‚Äôs protege to run for President next
Don't make 400k or more a year. Don't care. Biden's plans directly benefit me. Yours don't
This is really personally disappointing. I have illusions shattered once again.  My Trekker pain aside, you should be pushing Biden to listen to people like  if you really want to beat the #OrangeTroll. If those voters are as important as you say, help them.
Ever hear about vetting? That‚Äôs why #trump and his band of incompetences always have, ‚Äúacting‚Äù ppl in charge. He always announces who he wants before they completely check their backgrounds.  VP Biden knows what‚Äôs at stake for this presidency.
Unless Biden seeks a second term, then it could be 2028 before he leaves office.
I‚Äôd crawl a mile over broken glass to vote AGAINST you no matter what Biden surprise you come up with in November. Yes, you are hated and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it.U.S. Intelligence: China Opposes Trump Reelection; Russia Works Against Biden
How about we refuse to recognize the continuing Trump regime and instead recognize Biden as the legitimate President and refuse to cooperate with the U.S. gov until Trump is removed from office, by U.S. military, if necessary?  How about we lobby foreign govs to do the same?
I've waited 8 hours for Biden to say something sane, so why not.
Is it true the Rethuglicans are encouraging your bit of nonsense here to fuck with Biden's chances?  You have to know your chances of being elected are so minuscule as to be less than 0 so you're either ego-driven like Donnie or nuts like Kim keeps saying...
Joe's arriving a bit late to the election reform party. Trump operatives can steal states where no recount is possible because of e-voting. Trump just might win easily. Biden can protest the results, but the MSM will probably just 'sour grapes' all over him. #CluelessJoe.
Actually he's ignoring and refusing almost everything we demand of him. :/ Joe Biden is straight down the middle, completely unbeholden to us radical leftists. His campaign is negotiating with progressives like Bernie Sanders and AOC, but the left is compromising more.

Man, if you changed the word "china" to "Mexican, democrat, muslim, Clinton, Obama, Bernie, Biden, or what ever else it is they want you to hate this week"...  It sounds like 2016 all over again.    Can this man win without giving you an "enemy"?

I saw a pic of Biden today and genuinely my brain didn‚Äôt recognize it as being him. I know he got a facelift but like,,,, why did that change his whole entire face in my head
Biden could believe God an Oreo and he‚Äôs have more faith than Trump.
I hope Biden‚Äôs team is noticing how much opposition to Kamala Harris there is..
Biden makes clear Trump wouldn't get any special favors to avoid criminal prosecution
Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible' and 'hurt God'
The only rationale for this mishandling of this campaign is that some polling office in quasi-DC assured the Biden people that EVERY registered democrat will show up to vote regardless of how pissed-on.  They may be right, but what a horrid lesson to learn from this moment.
Don't you staffers get tired of having to write tweets to make up for Biden's constant stupidity?
Reminder:   Elizabeth Warren is the reason Biden is open to ending the filibuster today.   She successfully pushed him left on this issue.
Joe Biden has definitely flipped his position on this issue. He was staunch against getting rid of the filibuster, now he‚Äôs open to it.   Another victory for Elizabeth Warren who helped popularize this idea during the Democratic primaries last year.

Young voters - you might not be excited by Biden. I get it. But the other option is the party that thinks you are SO STUPID you‚Äôll vote for their distraction candidate Kanye West and feel like you made a difference. I know you‚Äôre smarter than that.
Biden won‚Äôt have any trouble with that. One shove and Donnie will be on his back like a turtle.
Biden will crush Trump in debates.
Because your mother told you that 2 wrongs don't make a right. You don't cancel racism with more racism. Besides, if Biden really believed his own words, he would have done something about it during his decades in government.
Nobody that would ever vote Democrat cares about Benghazi.   Kamala‚Äôs most memorable debate moment was when she called Joe Biden a racist. Her 2nd most memorable debate moment was when Tulsi Gabbard torched her record

If we are on the same team.. what do you want I hate Trump and everything he stands for and I fully support Biden so if you don‚Äôt support him you can leave anytime
Trump attacks Biden by saying he hates God. Trump dad was a KKK guy arrested at a pro KKK rally. The KKK hated catholics and Trump remarks are a hatred toward the catholic faith. Trump has expanded abortion like no other US President.
If Biden wins, the spring cleaning will have to be epic.
He sounds like a joe Biden with dementia,  wait
Noooo... Biden and Trump are propaganda puppets put in office to keep you from thinking about things like cancer clusters and who we gave 27 TRILLION dollars to.
So true! Biden is indeed a racist person. That is all he sees. Trump sees all of us as what our character is. Trump sees no skin color. #ColdWarRadio
Sorry to hear you will be sitting this one out. Hopefully you will reconsider if Biden's VP pick is someone you would like to see in the White House. Unfortunately progress is slow when it comes to equality and justice and while we could have done better than Joe he isn't bad.
Actually made me mad. The smirk on Biden's face and him almost flexing on you or something I didn't like that at all.
Yup. Biden will ruin this or ignore it.  um ur um where was I?
You all remember how Obama botched debate #2 in 2012, causing polls to flip, and Biden utterly obliterated Ryan soon after and singlehandedly flipped them back?

Biden just made a gaffe. Yes it was. But nothing compared to raging racist Donald Trump. Biden has my vote.
Trump and cronies have a hidden agenda. He is a Vatican proxy and is struggling to keep the world distracted from me. They fear me and refuse to mention me directly, and instead use proxies like Obama, Biden, etc. to keep the nation duped and distracted.
I really don‚Äôt think so, joe Biden gonna go back into hiding and trump gonna keep talking and making it worse
Yes. We would all like Joe Biden better.

With respect, this sounds like 'I want to vote for Biden but if everything doesn't meet my specific preferences I'm willing to bail on the greater good'.

Taken out of context in the article which says ‚ÄúBiden attempted to explain that point by arguing that Latinos in Florida and Arizona had different views on immigration.‚Äù And that‚Äôs completely true. Same way East Coast and West Coast have turnpikes vs. freeways so shut up Trump.
People don't vote for VP. Seriously, they don't. If Biden's VP choice turns you off voting, you're not a serious person, no matter what your age.

New polls show that Trump is narrowing the Gap with Biden. What in the hell is wrong with America that they would vote for that fool!

if Dems don't 'have the stomach' then Biden's will be a pyrrhic victory of horrendous proportions.
The 1st requirement for VP is a trust relationship w/ the President.  That doesn‚Äôt exist w/ her.  Her attack against Biden in the 1st debate proved that Harris is willing to attack other Dems. With her as VP, Biden would need someone to check his dinner for poison every evening.
Some people already know who they‚Äôre voting for and who they will NOT be voting for... and it‚Äôs not YOU. So we will get our Biden votes in early so you can start shitting your presidential pants early and make the next three months hell for you. That‚Äôs the LEAST we can do.
Maybe Mrs Obama _is_ pining for the Demos' nomination (as Mr Biden's 'issues' become too great for him to remain the candidate). Had always thought the idle spec about her and the presidency was just that.
I can't believe that someone is so stupid, but then again he said we should inject disinfectant into ourselves. He's trying to kill enough to make sure he wins in November, but if I have to walk 100 miles, I'm voting for Biden. #TrumpisaMurderer

Historian who has accurately called every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump in 2020 race
You‚Äôre right. My premise a year ago was that Biden would choose Michelle but now as his mental accument is being challenged, she just may step ahead of him and with Barry‚Äôs endorsement she‚Äôll probably make it. But with the Obama‚Äôs Gaffes the past 10 1/2 years, their done.
Imagine if someone could harness the energy of Repugs shifting after the election from their laissez faire attitude toward Donald to their hyper critical demands of President Biden.  Wouldn‚Äôt that be awesome?
Lots of people are pretty pissed about the Super Tuesday Surprise, the Biden campaign‚Äôs refusal to countenance popular left policies (legalize weed, defund cops, M4A) and the party‚Äôs embrace of Republicans. There‚Äôs not as much daylight between Biden and Trump as there should be.

You can not ignore that biden has mental issues. You can not ignore that he grooms young women and pets them and sniffs hair. Dude is wierd. Trump is trying to help people by bringing hcq treatment to light. You are right, trump and biden are not on equal footing. Biden sucks.

Nope, Biden pushed Harris to the right. Her actual position on busing was the exact same one Biden holds. That didn‚Äôt come out until people asked her straight up if she supports it or not

How ever anyone interprets it, there is one paradigm that no one can successfully argue against. The program ideas of Bernie Sanders have a far better chance of getting implemented through Biden than Trump. I've worked my whole life for those ideals. I want more success b4 i go.
If playing a defensive posture means people are in the streets, I don't want that to end just because people feel vaguely better about who's in charge. I want it to continue until we actually win. I worry about false complacency under Biden. Obama ended the anti-war protests.

Who said I support Biden?
I wouldnt trust anyone who doesnt know that using the word 'blacks' to refer to black people is not liberal. and democrats clearly cant be trusted because they think people like sanders and biden are liberal. so the party wont allow a liberal even after all weve done for them.
the game was 30 years ago chip. now progress isnt oinb the table. We just lost 50 years of progress and biden isnt going to get it back. even if he was a liberal, the courts wont allow it now

on a lighter note, vote Biden ‚Äì whomever 2020. maybe that's what you were saying. (It's possible to Make that point without sounding like the world is ending.)
Thanks for a great #FBRParty quite a few I wasn‚Äôt following before ‚òÆÔ∏è‚òØÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è #Resisters #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteEarly
The majority of voters never vote for the Vice President. They're all talk. I seriously doubt they're registered.   #Biden
A little tired of everyone telling me how I should feel about Biden and his VP choices. Let me have my own thoughts, for the love of god.
I know it‚Äôs been a lousy 3 1/2 years Mr. President but thank God for Joe Biden.
Biotin is not capable of doing any attacks on Trump. His people can tell him what to do and say, but biting himself cannot attack Trump. Not possible. Trump will walk all over Biden. All of Biden's policies are disastrous. Trump's policies actually work to build up the USA.
Oh, but you err! This is NOT 2016, regardless of your poll lies: we KNOW who we are voting for in 2020: Biden. Be prepared.
"Don't be afraid to be boring"  Lolz, it's like team Biden is trying to lose
Trump is an inspirational figure -- he either inspires great loyalty or great rage. He has upset a lot of apple carts in the GOP, and so a subset of conservatives want him gone BAMN, even if it means electing Biden. They want a complete restoration of the GOP BT (before Trump).
I hope and pray he is defeated, I can not vote for Biden but I will vote for anybody but trump,
I think we see the lack of experience in politics. This is as bad as the way Trump Republicans go about things. Diplomacy, negotiation, esprit de corps. Build a bigger coalition. A much better way to move your policy agenda. It is what Biden does.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden no matter what, and honestly, he was one of my last picks. But here‚Äôs our real job this year... FLIP THE MF SENATE!
Give me one example of a Joe Biden sign of demensia and I'll give you five Tump examples. Do you even have any? What, did he say million when he meant hundred thousand, is that it? Drink some coffefe and think about it.
If the Right wing nuts want the Clintons let me in a formal statement say here you go on a Silver Platter fuck them we don‚Äôt need to defend them for shit take them do your worst #Biden in November is all we care about
I don‚Äôt think he could if Biden waited. Once the RNC is on the books I believe Pence is locked in
Biden could easily mandate masks and impose steep fines for disobeying the law. Like other countries do. Americans wore seatbelts when required to, they would wear masks. Stop with the thinking errors you look stupid.
When there was an Ebola threat they helped New Jersey even though it was run by GOP Governor. Trump decided not to help cuz the initial outbreak was in DEM states. Thousands died. Your being a stupid ass. Biden sucks but he doesn‚Äôt kill Americans cuz they may vote against him.
Put it this way. Trump is cutting taxes and ‚ÄúJoe Biden actually wants to raise taxes over $7 trillion on the American people.‚Äù‚Äî
Ukraine did show quid pro quo. See Boltons book or at least summaries. Senate GOP would not call him as witness otherwise the conviction would be eminent. On live tv he asked china to help him by investigating biden. 2A. Illegal activity/obstruction. Too many firings of...
I'm sure that you realize that the biglyest proportion of his 85 million followers are detractors not supporters. For every example, of word stumbling that you give be of biden, I'll give you 5 examples of trump word stumbling. There are many more reasonsto not support trump ...
If Biden has dementia, Donnie boy has Alzheimer‚Äôs.
A small part of me wants him to win reelection ONLY so that he is in office to see his propped up economy crumble around him. My fear is Biden winning and being blamed for not being able to stop it. Trump needs to reap what he's sown.
Why shouldn‚Äôt Biden‚Äôs running mate have an ambition to be president some day? Most historically have, haven‚Äôt they? The implication here is infuriating if true.
nazi times doesnt know anything about any joe biden. god you must think we are stiupid
When you see the  campaign taking massive television ads against Biden, forget what he says (which is false), YOU KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING DOWN, BIG. Trump winning means WE will pay the ultimate price of any nation in the world as we are right now. Watch!!!
Really? Did you type that with a straight face? I will give you five examples of word stumbles of Trump's for every one that you give me of Biden's. Go ahead, I'm waiting.
Yes and their goal, if Biden wins, is to welcome back all the illegal aliens tha were deported! Tijuana here we come!
That's hilarious. Are you really that delusional to think that Biden how's the chance in any debate with Trump? Trump will walk all over him so easily. Your TDS is really bad. You should talk to a doctor about that.
Your question plants the suggestion in the readers mind that if Biden doesn't debate Trump, that somehow might make Biden unworthy of people's vote. Why would you want people to even consider thinking that way when you yourself are blue to the core
I don‚Äôt think anyone is suggesting they won‚Äôt vote for Biden. People are warning against picking a bad VP choice for who will be a distraction for the next 4 years
I‚Äôm really tired of people pretending Kamala Harris is a great debater.   She isn‚Äôt.   Her most memorable debate performances:  1. When she implied Joe Biden was a segregation supporting racist   and  2. When goofy Tulsi Gabbard torched her record and left her speechless
You know how great that comparison is from Joe Biden to Donald trump when the word ‚Äúgun control‚Äù is misspelled
‚ÄúStacey Abrams orK Harris would add pizzazz‚Äù  Imagine reducing a female politician‚Äôs contribution to a ticket as simply being ‚Äúpizzazz‚Äù.  Rubin thinks Biden‚Äôs VP choice =window dressing
I wish Biden had never hinted he might not run for re-election in 2024.   Otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about bombshell stories surrounding his potential VP running mate for the next 4 years
It's funny that people try to paint Biden as a pedo while supporting a "man" that has actually been accused of it and openly admitted to walking into an underage girls changing room because "he could" since it was his event. He tells you what he is. Listen to him.
Rep. James Clyburn Says It‚Äôs ‚ÄòFoolhardy‚Äô To Demand Biden Pick A Black Woman As Vice President | BET
"I'm going to Vote for Joe Biden, it's not a secret BUT... I don't like Joe Biden, I think Biden is maybe even a worse liar than Trump." That's a thought process that I can't comprehend.  I'm no fan of Trump but I can't fathom Biden as a option.
1) joe Biden can afford to run because people donate to his campaign, just like trump and every politician that isn‚Äôt Michael Bloomberg  2) trump swept COVID under the rug constantly until it blew up in his face, then he blamed dems 3) at least joe Biden listens to health experts
Biden wants the ultra rich their fair share.
Yes, and so is Biden.
I nominate postmaster Louis dejoy as the first man that Biden's Attorney General investigate got to be a substantial prison term for messing with the mail
Wanna Bet? If Biden wins there‚Äôll be a medical event to where he resigns and the VP takes over and Pelosi will be eligible, as speaker of the house, to be our next president. Sly, sneaky Demoturfd, huh?
Aha! Biden has moved back his announcement who his VP is going to be. Congress already knows. Barrack, after a long silence is offering plans for resurrection and ending filibusters, indicates his re-entry into the public arena... Why? Cause he‚Äôll be the husband of the new VP...
Trump's muddled message isn't landing
Bad sign for Harris supporters:   She was an early favorite... so either Biden is having second thoughts or he thinks her record is controversial and doesn‚Äôt want the preceding weeks  before the DNC to be filled with stories about her past
If the Republicans only cared for the people of this country that would be really nice. They have proven over the last 4years they don‚Äôt give a fig for this country or our democracy.  Vote for Biden, he cares.
Biden FORGETS where he is during Build Back Better speech  via    i am where
Absolutely. Biden wasn't my choice for Pres either but I am overjoyed to vote for him. I don't care which one he chooses. I will still happily vote for Biden
No liberal wants to openly endorse Biden  Not that I can blame them.....
Biden or  Trump?? Perhaps  Jill Stein???üòÇ
Why won't ANY lefty admit they are voting for Biden? ü§î   I don't blame you
Serious question: You voting for Biden???
‚ÄúAnita Dunn, Mr. Biden‚Äôs chief campaign strategist, was also still doing work for AT&amp;T last month.‚Äù  She needs to go
Elizabeth Warren can raise more money *and* she can get 10x as many small dollar donations   Her supporters will follow her wherever she goes  If Biden is smart, he‚Äôll ask her to be on the ticket ....because if she‚Äôs not, then our donations will go üí∏
Why isn‚Äôt Biden doing fundraisers with Kamala? Because she doesn‚Äôt have much influence and her supporters aren‚Äôt enthusiastic enough to donate üôÇ
Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs supporters like me *actually* donate to campaigns we support ...and if Biden doesn‚Äôt select Warren to be his VP running mate then my $$$ will only go to Warren Dems because my money only goes to politicians who support a wealth tax üôÇ
‚Äúif he does not choose Kamala Harris as his VP, all I will do is vote... no more campaign donations‚Äù  Considering they didn‚Äôt even donate to Kamala Harris‚Äôs primary campaign, im sure Biden‚Äôs team isn‚Äôt very worried about these ultimatumsüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Hell yes. There's nothing that can happen to make me not vote for Biden.  FLUSH THE ORANGE TURD NOVEMBER THIRD üåä
Why doesn‚Äôt Joe Biden choose Beyonc√© as his VP?
So COVID stays if trump is re-elected?  Soooooo....why shouldn‚Äôt we vote Biden?  Also, didn‚Äôt trump say it would magically disappear already?  Your tweet sucks.
Why didn‚Äôt Bernie win the nomination if that‚Äôs so important? Again, Howie BLACK LIVES MATTER, that‚Äôs how Biden got there.
If white men who think their opinions matter would just live their life and quit trying to be relevant ...live your life Howard and speak of what you know. Black people and people of color got Biden where he is not white men who thinks their opinions matter now. Shut the f up
anyone who would support biden really, is going to support anyone he says. I mean come on, the guy was against busing. I can imagine a conservative would vote against him or a liberal would vote for him because of who he picks
Shouldn‚Äôt more Californians care about Kamala Harris‚Äô shot at being named Biden‚Äôs VP?  ‚ÄúHarris‚Äô history as the state‚Äôs attorney general, and San Francisco‚Äôs district attorney before that, is a liability. Her record has come under fresh scrutiny as ....‚Äù
It‚Äôs hilarious that you 2 don‚Äôt see that Biden will lie or bend the truth just as much as Trump in a debate.
3rd party options: 1) Vote for Trump: Trump wins 2) Vote for Biden: Biden wins 3) Vote 3rd party candidate:  Polls show Biden losing more votes than Trump so Trump wins  If you're fine with four more years of Trump then vote 3rd party, if not vote Biden.  It's not brain surgery.
People are missing the point.  1) Vote for Trump - Trump wins 2) Vote for Biden - Biden wins 3) Vote 3rd party - pulling more votes Biden then Trump (as in 2016), and Trump wins  If you're fine with a Trump victory then vote 3rd party, if not vote Biden.  It's not brain surgery.
If Biden can tell me who, specifically, is going to forcibly remove Trump from office when he refuses to leave I'll vote for him. Otherwise wtf is the point? Everyone with the power to forcibly remove Trump are also capable of being fired by Trump. He's not going anywhere.
You're either missing the point or, well, I don't know what. I've voted third party myself when I felt that ultimately there wasn't any difference between the D &amp; R candidates, which is often the case. But there's a HUGE difference between Trump &amp; Biden. We HAVE to defeat Trump.
Waiting for Biden to announce his VP
Kamala Harris supporters: ‚ÄúI will not vote for Joe Biden‚Äù  YIKES
Harris allies granted call with Biden campaign after Dodd blowup
If Joe Biden is going to listen to someone about this choice it is Obama. Unlike Ed Rendell or Chris Dodd, Obama has made this decision before. Biden isn't going to listen to a backbencher.
Biden's too dumb to not blow cover.
will biden end thewar against hillary? Will biden hold the fbi accountable to the law?  long as this nazi country wages war against liberaliusm trump and biden are the same to decent peoiple. both hate liberls so liberals wouuld be stuopid to vote for eithe

Joe Biden should cancel the debates with Trump and debate Sarah Cooper instead, Cooper as Trump is a lot smarter anyway

How Biden's VP pick could tip the scales in Wisconsin  ‚Äú[Elizabeth Warren] represents one of the best opportunities to win voters who had supported Bernie Sanders over Biden in the primary election.‚Äù Agreed 100%
You seem to be confusing Biden with trump
If Joe Biden makes a campaign promise to un-ban Tik Tok we will see the biggest youth turnout in the history of America lol
Kamala Harris co-sponsored legislation with Republican senators to condemn the Obama-BIDEN admin because they criticized illegal Israeli settlements
No, we don't love you at all.  We WISH Biden was a lefty, he's a moderate republican and you know it üòÇ  #NeverBidenNeverTrump #FDT
Or you could say, "many are uniting behind Biden regardless of his VP pick. The online noise grows irksome."
Hm let‚Äôs see Biden could ask Warren to be his VP and he‚Äôll get:  - a massive grassroots network of donors / supporters  or he could ask Harris and get:  - a massive twitter troll army that didn‚Äôt donate anything to her campaign and probably won‚Äôt donate to his either way
The largest fundraiser that Kamala  Harris hosted with Joe Biden had 1,400 donors...
Should I assume that you are voting for Biden? So who's stupid here?
me, 2 days ago:  this ‚Äúshe‚Äôs just too ambitious!‚Äù story feels like a cover for something the Biden campaign doesn‚Äôt want to discuss publicly about Kamala Harris‚Äôs record  twitter / khive: you‚Äôre paranoid  me, today:
This is ****way***** larger than the event Kamala Harris did last month. She managed to attract 1,400 attendees for her fundraiser with Biden  Warren brought 40,000.
Harris also campaigned against the USMCA which Biden supported
Biden‚Äôs internal polling
She hasn‚Äôt. Warren has lead almost every single poll. Harris has lead 1 of them or been tied   Biden‚Äôs internal polling shows Harris isn‚Äôt popular amongst Black voters, according to The NY Times
Biden‚Äôs team is doing internal polling, if Harris isn‚Äôt chosen it‚Äôs because she doesn‚Äôt poll well amongst voters Biden wants support from
People who don‚Äôt support Kamala Harris for the VP position  -her former aides  -young voters  -Biden‚Äôs VP search team  -progressive voters  -Biden‚Äôs aides  -people who endorsed Harris during the primary  -the Left  -california dems  -black voters in the midwest
Jennifer Rubin: ‚ÄúIf Biden doesn‚Äôt pick Kamala Harris then he is a misogynist‚Äù  Are you a REPUBLICAN?
There might be a contested nomination no matter what, assuming biden doesnt run. The Dem party is restive and has a lot of talented people who want to move up.
Biden needs to either eliminate it or do some drastic restructuring. This is what some feared would/could happen when creating DHS.
Kamala Harris is only popular on twitter. She isn‚Äôt popular in real life.   Biden‚Äôs internal polling most likely supports this and the results of the Democratic primary clearly support this.
precisely. It's not like Joe Biden doesn't have name recognition.
Do you think Joe Biden doesn't have enough name recognition? One problem in the last election was that Hillary had too much name recognition. Kamala has Considerable name recognition. Just like Susan Rice. OTOH you make a good point.üëÄ
This is a poor metric to use.   Warren did the best out of everyone on Biden‚Äôs VP shortlist in the primary.   She did better than Kamala Harris who was so unpopular in her own home state that she polled in 5th place (tied w/ Gabbard) and had to drop out to avoid being embarrassed
‚Äúthe Biden campaign should be concerned about things like the secret $400,000 settlement Harris‚Äô office paid to settle ‚Äúgender harassment‚Äù claims against a top aide named Larry Wallace.‚Äù  This is really bad, Maya
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
Think Biden is waiting to long he needs to make his VP pick like yesterday any one of them is great He needs to put his cabinet together soon too cuz he will need to hit the ground running  It will take him at least a year to clean up Trump mess
If Biden picks Kamala, TRUMP WINS  via
‚ÄúPolling has indicated Kamala doesn't help much w black voters‚Äù  Biden‚Äôs internal polling must show really bad numbers for Kamala Harris

hell, keep him in there. electrify all the fences, make it "trump penitentiary" (even put the name on a billboard on  top of the house). Prosecute &amp; convict his minions, drop them inside the grounds to join him. Life imprisonment. We'll build another place for Biden.
‚ÄúCalifornia Democrats, including several in Congress, have expressed their wariness about [Kamala] Harris to Mr. Biden‚Äôs advisers.‚Äù
‚ÄúMore telling, a Biden campaign official reached out to The New York Times, unprompted, to say that some of the former vice president‚Äôs own staff members are not supportive of her.‚Äù  And apparently Biden‚Äôs team doesn‚Äôt like her either. Good. Harris has a terrible record.
‚ÄúOne Democrat close to Mr. Biden‚Äôs campaign said its polling indicated [Kamlaa] Harris has little allure with Black voters.‚Äù  attn KHive:   Read the room. Democrats don‚Äôt want her to the VP. Get over your hurt feelings
Sure, Joe Biden may have a reprehensible voting record, but did you know that he also lacks any sort of charisma
Double Marxist? I wish Biden was 1/4 that cool
Trump campaign cancels TV ads to try to figure out how to stop losing to Biden  Trump's campaign is removing its current television ads from the airwaves and reviewing its messaging strategy, hitting a full-scale reset button.  #Election2020
Yes I agree and apparently his wife is making a legitimate run for his former leadership position. Surprised she‚Äôs not convincing Biden o add her to his VP list.
Hah! The nausea inducing Olsen accused Biden of conspiracy mongering when in April he suggested trump would do this. Today Olsen is just surfacing from the bottom if his slime pit...

I'm sure Biden is waiting with baited breath to hear from Rove
Don‚Äôt worry Joe I‚Äôve been supporting you since you ran for president in 1988 #Biden #BidenHarris2020So Biden is a robot the Russians are remotely controlling?  Brook, that would really explain a lot!
How do we handle this? If he is coming out and saying he's only doing it to "steal" votes away from Biden how does America not come out fully equipped to punish him? This can't be legal.
Lots of people are talking about how Trump is bad and very few people are being honest about Biden. There are simply more lies to push back on, and more of those lies are coming from sources that need the pushback.
Pssst...I‚Äôm not a Biden guy either. Both idiots. No matter who is the ‚Äúculprit‚Äù (like this is some fun caper to be solved?), Trump bungled and didn‚Äôt take it seriously. Even he came around on masks (finally). Take it serious at first and jobs would have never gotten to this point
In a socialist country people are easier to control and it ties in with covid19 Bill Gates anthony fauci child trafficking epstein Hollywood pedos nancy pelosi khamila harris joe biden most of the music industry and a few people in professional sports.
Trump and Biden are every reason we need a viable 3rd party.
2/2  The only person to blame if Biden doesn't beat the #OrangeTroll in November will be Biden. It's his job to make people want to vote for him.  Online trolls bullying people won't change minds.
1/2  1. There is a lot less difference between Biden and Trump then people want to admit, and I think a lot of people are in denial about it.  2. She lives in a safe blue state, so it's irrelevant.  3. It only does harm if Biden and other Dems don't listen.
the ODNI has publicly stated today that Russia is actively working on a disinformation campaign against Joe Biden, and a campaign in support of Trump. As a US senator, why are you collaborating with Russia on THEIR campaign.
I agree I would love to see a Biden-Warren ticket!
US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. -
Running interference for Biden. Shame.
Saying That Joe Biden Is Against God Is Not Only Not True But Is Blasphemous!!!! Donald Trump Holding The Bible Upside Down For A Photo Op Is Sacrilegious?? I Would Bet $1,000.00 That Trump Has Never Read A Single Passage Of Scripture In His Life??? So The Religious Right What??!

Stephen Miller‚Äôs plan was to separate children from parents and have white parents adopt and raise them. It‚Äôs chilling and more chilling that we ignore it as a country. Biden has much to reverse once in office

We will have 166 days of very heightened vigilance after Biden wins. That will be the most dangerous 166 days in our history
Kamala's job if selected as Biden's running mate will be to articulate Biden's platform.
I care desperately for people to quit allowing neolibs to define the choices for you. It is not Trump or Biden unless you fall for that.
Biden loves him
Obama an biden both called this dem senator a hero for his believers. Odd word choice for a kkk recruiter.
Biden hates black people. He‚Äôs an old school white supremacist.
According to the centrists ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the way Biden talks and Joe being Joe Biden‚ÄùüôÑ.  Sound familiar?ü§®. I‚Äôm voting for the lame moron but Warren and Sanders would‚Äôve been much better presidents if elected.  Can‚Äôt wait for 2024 Democratic primary!
Trump. I know. But it‚Äôs the lesser of two evils. And Biden is BAD
Biden needs to pick a VP soon to handle diversity stuff before his verbal shitposting catches up to him. I mean Trump has lowered the bar low, but there's a limit for independent voters.
And Trump is "pro-life" just because he *says* he opposes it?!? üòÖ Look at his UN-Prolife behavior in other ways! BTW, Biden said previously that he is opposed to abortion, but that he cannot &amp; should not force his beliefs on others. That's democracy whether ppl like it or not.
Why is he so uniquely special? He‚Äôs doing everything that the Republican Party, with Biden‚Äôs help, has been working on since the 1970s.  Biden has supported and cooperated with that agenda. Why is he better?  If you say ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù in your answer, you lose. Biden kills my wife too.
Trump has done more for black people since 2016 than Biden has ever done. Biden has always been a true white supremacist
Media needs you to think Biden is inevitable, landslide Joe.
- OMG the grandparent #Biden ad is ME...I am missing my grandchildren more than ANYTHING...and missing so much of their growth and development. I am freakin BITTER about the botched #COVID19 response. And #Iblametrump
He blocked me for telling him why his entire theory of supporting Biden to push him left was crap.
#BidenIsRacist #Biden said racial integration policies would cause his children to "grow up in a racial jungle."  He prevented thousands of children from receiving better educations and more opportunities in life #WhiteSupremacist
Biden is an old school true white supremacist and racist
Biden was against school integration and said that racial integration policies would cause his children to "grow up in a racial jungle."
Tough on real crimes. Biden crime bill locked up people for life and ruined lives with no hope of getting rehabilitation. It caused MASS INCARCERATION. It most especially hurt black and brown people. It‚Äôs disgusting that he can deny it now.
I greatly respect  and I have a lot of respect for what he is doing, but the words "binary choice" are just wrong. There are at least three candidates for President better than both Trump and Biden.  #NeverTrump #NeverBiden
please NO #SUSANRICE. The potential president after Joe Biden ISNT Susan Rice. Karen Bass is. She and  have plans to restore our nation. They‚Äôve both proven they‚Äôve delivered &amp; will continue
What if both Trump and Biden get covid and Kanye is the last candidate standing?
I don't think Biden should debate Trump. Why? Because you cannot carry on a real debate with someone who has NO regard for truth or anything fact-based. He's a lying asshole &amp; of less value than a penny postage stamp.
Not Republicans but Trump's lawyers!  He is trying to divide the votes to keep Biden from a victory.
WaPo desperate to get Biden elected, Obama‚Äôs third term.
So you‚Äôre saying Biden has a chance to change the constitution, something you haven‚Äôt been able to do? Sounds like he‚Äôd be a powerful leader then.
The whole spectacle of Biden is an embarrassment to the United States. Less so than Trump, who is daily actively destroying our government and our assets. But we need someone who will rebuild knowledge and capability instead of destruction.
Censorship is the prime tool to elect Biden, Obama‚Äôs third term
Had a dream Michelle Obama surprised everyone and ran w Biden. Far out shit man. Time to log out.
Trump campaign ad features doctored images of Joe Biden 'in his basement, alone'  via
Why introduce a straw man?  We're talking about demanding more from Biden, not the #OrangeTroll.
Twitter is big part of Joe Biden campaign to eliminate and censor any views they don‚Äôt approve of. Obama wants third term.
This could peel away Republican voters that were considering Biden. Timing on this was bad.
This is really concerning. The strategy is to pull off one to 2% of the black vote in swing States like Wisconsin and Ohio away from Biden. Is there anything happening within the black community itself to counteract this measure?
Sundown Syndrome, you mean?  We call it "Alzheimer's Disease" now but it's still very real.  A friend who was an elderly care nurse says #JimCrowJoe has all the symptoms.  Why is Biden saying the Black community is monolithic?
The timing on this is terrible! Republicans that were considering voting for Biden will now peel off. Why are Dems so willing to shoot themselves in the foot in an election cycle.
What do you feel Biden will do about the issues #BlackLivesMatter is fighting for? Do you believe Black lives matter to Biden?
He is pending on the ballot in Wisconsin. They want to pull students away from voting for Biden.
Bernie Sanders was never pro-segregation. He was actively against it and was arrested protesting housing discrimination in Chicago. Desegregating housing would have also solved school segregation.  Equating Bernie and Biden on race is really dishonest.
She's saying Biden is a white supremacist who favors locking up all the Black men because he thinks they're junkies.  Better?
Comparing Warren and Biden to Bernie Sanders on race is insulting and either intellectually dishonest or very uneducated on actual policy.  Warren and Biden are white supremacists.
WATCH: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand In The Way Of A Trump Prosecution
Why? Why would they now be coming out of woodwork but before there was no suits whatsoever? Because this is what the GOP does, they find people from Biden‚Äôs past willing to take money to make an accusation. The GOP even for a woman to come out against Mueller and a guy against
Please, if there were any truth to these allegations Biden would have been sued just like Trumpnwas dozens, of not hundreds of times civilly over these supposed assaults. People these days sue if they have a groeviemce of this nature but none and I mean none of these woman sues
I want to be clear about something: I will vote for Biden this fall. Is he my first choice? NO. Our primary hadn't happened before everyone else dropped out. He's our ONLY real choice. I'm not happy, it's not ideal. But until the left can be really united, this is our choice.
You‚Äôre kidding yourself if you don‚Äôt think the crime bill hurt blacks much more than whites and target blacks. Watch how Biden speaks and what a disgusting pig he is the way he speaks of black children!
That‚Äôs an area of vast difference between progressives and Biden and Bernie. They both want to give the cops more money. They‚Äôre wrong.  The cops have too much money.
Two weeks ago, Joe Biden was being kept safely tucked away. He recently went on tv again.  What do you think?
What could possibly go wrong for Biden now?
Biden‚Äôs plan is more ACA subsidies to predatory insurance companies and lowering the Medicare age to 60. More Medicaid expansion.  You‚Äôre confusing Biden with Bernie.
Is Biden going to debate Trump??
Biden needs to debate Trump, which they will never let him, because it‚Äôs going to be a huge train wreck. #BidenHasDementia
Trump lowered the price of insulin and Biden is against #MedicareForAll, so I doubt he‚Äôs a one issue voter.
No one is speaking in Milwaukee. They chose to speak from their respective cities because of Covid. He‚Äôs not hiding in his basement. That pic that Trump touted is photoshopped.
Yeah I noticed that the last time I watched it. How disgusting! Biden is an awful person. Even with dementia, he can‚Äôt help himself from showing his true thoughts on black people.
I do cocaine to speed up his interviews to. Have you listened to joe Biden...have u listen to joe on cocaine an weeeed.
Sorry, but Biden is clearly anti FDR. This bullshit is offensive.
Has been changed and it‚Äôs been so many decades! Democrats like Biden did things like the Biden crime bill that sent soooo many black men to prison. The 3 strikes you‚Äôre out laws also!
I‚Äôll be unpopular and point out the way Biden has dragged this out and waited has largely contributed to the internal strife about his pick is imo
Also is anyone really out there jumping up and down that Biden is Democrat nominee...   Good lord he can barely talk.
It is very clear that Biden is suffering mental decline.
Obama, Biden and Clinton‚Äôs.
Basement Biden will be in jail over Ukraine, and then there is lying and treason for spying.
Are her ‚Äúdances‚Äù signals to Biden that it‚Äôs time to say something stupid and racist again?
Sure did Marsha the dude was  committing a crime. Why wouldn‚Äôt they order the AG to investigate. I don‚Äôt think Biden had the authority to order anything at that time now I think of it. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Alzheimer‚Äôs is a very specific type of dementia. Dementia is a brain disease. It‚Äôs not a mental illness. Unless Biden is diagnosed, it won‚Äôt be known what type of dementia he has specifically.
let‚Äôs face it. You have a distinct opportunity to affect billions of lives and direction of the population. Join Biden for election. Establish help to ease process burden. We need just, thoughtful sanity in US and beyond. Regards.
This is not sitting well we us Americans. It just another nail in his coffin as a President. Biden 2020
It‚Äôs we Americans thinks it‚Äôs time for you to leave. America we be great again when Biden wins
Also, the background was photo shopped on this photo. He isn't alone like it appears in the ad. We need to call this out. It won't stop. God only knows that they will photo shop Biden doing next.
I understand all of it except for the last part. ‚ÄúPush him around‚Äù is he talking about Biden, I‚Äôm assuming??
If he does, it‚Äôs not as advanced as Biden‚Äôs is. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Biden is really far gone at this point.
If having advanced dementia is cool, Biden is üíØ
Biden has advanced staged dementia ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
You can‚Äôt possibly love this country if you‚Äôre voting for Biden in November. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
üíØ!!!! Biden is the epitome of a shire supremacist
Joe Biden is a racist. He always has been. Look up the Biden crime bill. And, there are countless videos where you can see him saying the most racist things. He is a white supremacist.
Biden is going to actively break the left. If necessary, he'll purge the Dems the way Obama did. Dems lost 1K offices while Obama was President and it wasn't because they were "too ambitious."  He let people lose.
CNN is part of the Biden campaign for Obamas third term.
Who? I know that the Dems think it will get Biden voted into office, but it‚Äôs doing the opposite.
Biden won't go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
It's no different than Joe Biden giving paid speeches on behalf of Fred Upton when Upton was running for re-election. It's no different than Beto O'Rourke refusing to campaign against Will Hurd.  It's a big club and they're all in it. They're protecting the senior members.
I‚Äôm not okay with that. I switched parties 2 months ago, after I saw how insane and evil the Dems are. But, if I didn‚Äôt and was voting blue, I can‚Äôt imagine being okay with voting for dementia Biden and assuming who is running the show is someone I like.
Tucker Carlson says it's 'probably illegal' for Joe Biden to pick a Black woman as vice president
Wasn‚Äôt Biden friends with a KKK member or leader?
Ok. Trump has 25 allegations by women of sexual misconduct or assault. He has been recorded on Howard Stern and in other interviews making these misogynistic statements and those that sexualize his own daughter. You have videos of Biden hugging girls and kissing their heads.
I voted for Bernie in 2016 and would have in May if that was allowed in Oregon as an independent.  However as a Black male I can‚Äôt contemplate voting for IT and his White Supremacist agenda.  This time its Joe Biden or face the phase two of a 4th Reich.  It‚Äôs that serious.
"November 4th is too late. We should hold Joe Biden accountable now."  -    I really have to wonder why  is waiting for him to win. They should be at his door right now and demanding he sign on to Bernie's platform across the board.  Or no votes.
. source: Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic presidential nomination.
It appears that the Dems and MSM have infinite passes for Biden.
Truthfully I like she and Elizabeth Warren the best.  But Joe Biden won‚Äôt go wrong with any of the 8 women he is considering.  Gretchen Wilmer is also impressive.  I am Black but don‚Äôt believe he HAS to select a Black woman...selecting a woman who could run the country is #1!
Also Biden: C'mon man, are you a junkie?
Could he cede now so Biden can lead us out of a pandemic?
Me: Joe Biden is not the best the Democrats can do. Liberals: What do you mean? Me: Dementia, for one. Liberals: That's a Bernie Bro hoax!   Hold my beer.
If they take their month recess and leave us hanging out here NO ONE will vote Republican. They would return in Sept to all schools reopening or not, with no plan, no plan for funding us, no plan for testing, but lots of lies about how awful Biden would be for us.
And progressive #BLM activist  beat corrupt time server  There‚Äôs going to be real pressure on Biden from Congress!
The way I heard it, Reps are encouraging him because they believe that Black voters will defect to him from Biden.  So shortsighted and dumb.
I ran some polls about it, Twitter leftists like Teachout next best after  I will admit that, but I like  because I trust him to fight Biden because of his history of fighting Cuomo.  He was anti-Amazon before anyone.
It‚Äôs this simple:  is trying to preserve the GOP majority to give the Democratic Party a built in excuse for not passing progressive legislation if Biden wins.  #ChuckoTheClown needs a serious primary challenger from someone with legislative experience.
I agree with that one big question and I would add one other: who is best positioned to win in 2024?   Opinion | The one thing Joe Biden should think about in a running mate
Joe Biden has advanced dementia!!!
Joe Biden is getting briefings. He should be able to confirm or deny.
O like biden. ..
He want's to be a dictator like his bffs in russia &amp; n. korea
Wow!! Really Bad President Ratings!! Obama wayyy up in the ratings! Biden also surging. Scared Fake News Trump failing and Do-Nothing Republicans can‚Äôt help displaced working families feed families due to mismanagement of China Virus. SAD!  &amp;   not a factor...
Wow!! Really Bad President Ratings!! Obama wayyy up in the ratings! Biden also surging. Fake News Trump failing and Do-Nothing Republicans can‚Äôt help displaced working families feed families due to embarrassing mismanagement of China Virus. SAD! CNN not a factor. #AmericaOrTrump
"We have Trump in office because socialists want nice things and we mean liberals are willing to re-elect the #OrangeTroll to stop people from getting healthcare!"  Fixed it for you!  Now stop helping Trump win and start pushing Biden for #MedicareForAll!
I agree with   This is something for all my #Resistance followers to consider. Both Presidential candidates have largely the same view of the ongoing uprisings to #AbolishThePolice. So does Congress.  Who benefits from that? How many liberals will buck Biden?
He will, of course, be whining a different tune in November when he loses Frorida to Joe Biden. Then it will be back to "massive voter fraud from mail-in ballots, but absentee ballots were great!"
Got her spotted for Education Secretary. Working with Dr. Jill Biden with vital Education programs gutted by the Nazis, eliminating funding for Private Schools, appropriately
It really is. That was the kind of argument I could expect a real Biden supporter to make, and making it where it would be called out as wrong by  might actually be parody as praxis.
his mouth insanity falls out of it. #TrumpIsNotWell is an accurate and frightening reality. Biden is our choice. We might not like it, hell we might hate it, but voting 3rd party is NOT A CHOICE. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #vote #AmericaWakeUp 3.
I hope this comment gets thrown at 45 when he refuses to go to Biden's inaugural. Of course, he would have fled the country by then, to a non extradition destination.
Outside of Twitter, most people haven‚Äôt even thought about the question of who will be Biden‚Äôs VP.
Biden loves children.
I‚Äôm waiting for the NYT to call off voting for President in 2020 and just appoint Biden President if all the editors there agree that‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for journalists, leeches, and grifters.
And then in 2024 we‚Äôll be told ‚Äúyou Have to vote for Biden cause _____ is so bad. Change can come next time‚Äù then 2028 it‚Äôs ‚Äúyou have to vote for bland no change democrat because _______ is so evil. Change next time.‚ÄùAnd on and on the cycle of corporate power continues.
I‚Äôm hoping for #BidenHarris2020.  In any case, #Biden has my vote. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Count me in, #WomenAgainstTrump, #PortlandMoms and #NursesWhoTweet!  I‚Äôm a college-educated suburban white woman who voted for Hillary. You bet I will #VoteByMail and #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare.  #Biden
Shucks, Joe Biden will be available after the first week of November
No, the movement took over the Republican Party and elected a "moderate Democrat" President in the guise of a conservative Republican and he turned out to be the fash.  Now the conservatives in both parties want to replace him with far right Joe Biden.
Exactly. After they realized the media wouldn't be able to look the other way if he won South Carolina, they fixed SC for Biden.
Biden still thinks he is VP
Let‚Äôs end them before Biden gets destroyed.
Panderingfor Hidin‚Äô Biden, and the dementia parade.
It's true. A lot of white people just refuse to notice what's happening to people who aren't white and think other white people aren't poor.  That's the origin of the horrific "white working class" myth that sticks us with a choice between Biden and Trump.
LMAO, the Pizzagate, QAnon, Seth Rich, Hunter Biden, Obama is a secret Muslim crowd weighs in on conspiracies. üòÇ
I'd like to think so. But putting a former president in prison is something I don't see happening. The political fall out would be too much. Don't get me wrong, I want him in prison. But a Biden/Dem administration jailing him? Don't see it.
Tell Joe Biden: Make Abortion Access for All* A Top Priority
Really.....is that all you got??? TRUMP 2020!!!!
Yes, he had to compromise significantly with conservative Democrats he should have played hardball with. After he made his deal with the RW Dems he still didn't win any GOP votes.  Biden was telling him to deal with them. Yes, that's on him.
That doesn't really sufficiently address that ridiculous response though.   shouldn't Biden be able to show he cares more than the #OrangeTroll if he wants to be President?
Let‚Äôs see Joe ‚ÄúBrain Dead‚Äù Biden‚Äôs RIGHT NOW!!!!
Biden's platform committee already voted on #MedicareForAll and they voted it down. So unless he takes personal action, yes, it's certain #MedicareForAll will not be in the platform.
Some Biden supporters were way more offended than Biden ever was.
No, he's butthurt because I said he and Joe Biden didn't care. Did you see anything from him that looked like anything but an excuse not to care?
Don't waste your time trying to convince trumpers.  Recruit new people, independents, free thinkers and ex-Republicans to vote for Joe Biden to replace Trump &amp; GOP.
What about the people who already don't have any coverage at all or are severely underinsured because of the ACA?  You're still ignoring them. Like I said, you and Biden don't care any more than Trump did. You just want to check off an insurance box.
Health insurance isn't a guarantee of health coverage, particular under the ACA. Many of the people who will "lose their insurance" already can't use their insurance due to huge deductibles, and still have to pay huge premiums.  Joe Biden isn't offering to fix that problem.
Looks like she hates Biden and Trump. Who can blame her for that?
Check Biden‚Äôs basement.
I almost want to know who Biden is considering 4 AG More than I want to know his pick for VP.
Where did you pull out that completely meaningless and obvious statement?  Everyone knows that. Why pat yourself on the back?  Biden is in control of the Democratic platform and has a great deal of say in what happens after he gets elected. So why doesn't he care?
Who is running for president that wants to defund the police?  Trump and Biden have both said they are not for defunding.
That‚Äôs a good question. The problem comes from people not being as stupid as politicians want them to be. They know that, if healthcare is a right, then #MedicareForAll is the minimum required.  Biden keeps saying healthcare is a right. Dem primary voters were fooled too.
It‚Äôs true. He doesn‚Äôt. Neither does Joe Biden. Why aren‚Äôt you pushing him on health care, if you care? ü§î
If you don‚Äôt pick demographically correct you‚Äôre racist and/or letting Trymp win?  Fucking stupid on their part!  I‚Äôm voting Biden no matter what because I DESPISE Trump.  You want my vote ONLY? Or do you want a vote, a campaign contribution, volunteer, activist and enthusiast?
Adam Schaffer‚Äôs of course!  Warren should get VP to coalesce the party(finally a PROGRESSIVE!), have excellent policies, and also get an activist base and fundraising that Biden won‚Äôt with ANY OTHER of the options.  Harris as AG and Warren‚Äôs protege to run for President next
Don't make 400k or more a year. Don't care. Biden's plans directly benefit me. Yours don't
This is really personally disappointing. I have illusions shattered once again.  My Trekker pain aside, you should be pushing Biden to listen to people like  if you really want to beat the #OrangeTroll. If those voters are as important as you say, help them.
Unless Biden seeks a second term, then it could be 2028 before he leaves office.
This is Biden‚Äôs race to win or lose. The worst thing that could happen is you select someone that has some hidden Skelton or isn‚Äôt ready for prime time. Pick Kamala who has been vetted  and is prepared to be president
People whining about Biden taking to long to pick VP are even more annoying than the more aggressive advocates for particular candidates.
If you don't vote, or don't vote for Biden you are effectively making a choice for Trump.
Even if God themself comes down and says "Joe Biden will win in 2020", you still gotta vote for  as early as possible! Don't assume that any poll, article, or other-world guarantee insures a Biden victory. Only ALL of us voting for Biden will do that!!!! #AmericaOrTrump
You and Joe Biden had years to remake America! The Dems and MSM are trying to destroy America, along with Obama and G Soroes and you! We have had a taste of Make America Great Again, and we like it, a lot!
You‚Äôre right. Biden‚Äôs policies won‚Äôt save my wife‚Äôs life and that‚Äôs kind of my top political priority right now.
Biden won‚Äôt stop Bezos, Musk, and Gates from killing me. I will still be dead.
You mean Brain dead Biden???
If you did not understand Biden in the video, it's not a problem with his coherence but your lack of a basic vocabulary and ability to comprehend full sentences.
Hey Patriots, it's another Karen.  Cuban-American Republicans attack potential Biden VP pick Karen Bass over Cuba ties  #SmartNews
Trump bans Tik Tok, Biden bans you. We can live with that.
It's still several weeks until the RNC nominating convention and I can't help but Wonder if there is going to be a change in direction.
RN here. He's getting IV bruises either from anticoagulants or Serum meds for covid. He shows signs of TIA so that makes sense. But he could also be getting antiserum for covid. No transparency?
Gary I agree with you 100%. I'm 65 and I am more than willing to get into a street fight with Trump. Would I am not willing to do is put up with the Democrats eating their own when they don't like who Biden picks for his VP. That bullshit has to stop now.
Hidin‚Äô Biden looking for cover.
Biden is unavailable period.
And that‚Äôs why the investigation into Biden has yielded nothing.üôÑ You really believe anything Trump serves you, even when no indictments follow. Meanwhile, Donald and sycophants blocked all testimony, even his own from impeachment proceedings.
Hidin‚Äô Biden must be defeated.
The Supreme Court has been infected with Trumpism this is going to be a real problem moving forward that will need to be addressed as soon as Biden is elected.Impeachment must be on the table. Having justices that intend to dismantle our democracy from within cannot be tolerated
I would swap 1 and 2 only from the perspective of carrying swing states. Biden gonna win CA no matter what. Demings at VP might lock in FloriDUH. As far as Biden maybe being 1-term on purpose, Harris is the strongest heir apparent, if you will.
Absolutely not and is once again a desperate and sleezy attempt to get joe biden in the White House by far left radical turds
oh boy! quite the potential running mate.  Joe Biden's vice presidential contender Rep. Karen Bass praised Scientology at a 2010 ceremony  #SmartNews
All the stupid people follow you. It‚Äôs a case of the dumb loving the dumber... keep telling everyone that if we just stopped testing the virus would ‚Äúdisappear ‚Äú. You have guaranteed a Biden win. Even Trumpers aren‚Äôt going to ignore their dying relatives
Completely agree I don‚Äôt wanna have to suffer through 90 min of the moron while he tries to bully Biden because he‚Äôs not smart enough to do anything else. Everyone‚Äôs already decided it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre dealing with unknown factors ,most of America wishes we could vote sooner.
Liberals are pushing a joe biden jock strap that also protects agaisnt covid ya u can wear it over your face I'm ordering one and sending it too ya I mean u can protect yourself and support joe biden at the same timeü§£ü§£
She did what good friends do: tell you when you made a mistake. And Biden took the criticism like a good friend and corrected for it.   The only people still upset about that exchange are supporters who can‚Äôt let it go like the candidates did loooong ago.
Love this lady. My favorite quote: If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair. One of the original "persisters".   Shirley Chisholm blazed the way for every Black woman Biden is considering for VP

China has seriously damaged USA with Wuhan virus, these seeds will complete the job. China needs Joe Biden!
#MedicareForAll and I'd vote for Biden.
Chris Dodd should NOT be vetting Biden's VP candidates.
The Biden campaign demands it.
Biden would be a fool in my opinion not to have his finalists as Warren and Harris.  Either works for me.   The knives that are out for Harris by some Biden advisors are silly and frankly make me angry.
CUZ nobody cares &amp; they ONLY know political Kazuki theater. &amp; Biden SUUUUUUCCCCKKKKKSSSSS  "so care everybody!"
If Biden were to get Covid and die, Bernie would be the democratic nominee and Trump could and would beat Bernie.
Not to be a conspiracy nut but the only chance that Trump has of winning is for Biden to get Covid and die and you can bet that Putin, Erdogen and the Saudis are trying to put an infected person in Biden circle
Just like him saying he'll hold up the election. We'll get a new POTUS on 1/21 regardless and if its not Biden, its Pelosi. He's too stupid to understand the law.
Counting on some voter rolls being purged, machines rigged, ballots changed and others not counted to give him a 2 percent edge but increase in voter participation alone by democrats will swamp Trump let alone all the independents that will switch to Biden b/c while they don‚Äôt
OMFG! I just read this thread. Are you people fucking serious? It does not matter who Joe Biden pics as his VP. We will not bitch, we will not complain, we will support him and vote. Get over yourselves! Are any of you doing anything to help people get registered or to vote?
if you vote biden he has to smell your boys hair. Thats how he keeps his hair.
You insinuating Biden is a pedophile?  I mean hate the dems, hate the system, overthrow whatever but WTF you accuse a guy of being a pedophile? Is Obama not a US citizen too? That BS came from the same people.
2020 presidential debates to be hosted by Ric Flair.  Trump and Joe biden to trade insults back and forth on Zoom via a 56k connection.
LMAO.  Chuck Ross, who will never get a real journalism job because of past racist authored blogs about blacks and whose followers are mainly QAnon cultists, has taken it upon himself to vet Biden's VP picks ...because they're black.
When Pew Research calls and you have to pretend to be a Biden Bro so you don‚Äôt get canceled.
I'm old enough to remember that when Obama picked Biden there was a huge flap in a lot of Dem circles. That noise went on until the convention was over and it was obvious that there was a chemistry between the two. This partnership is like a marriage. Same wavelength all day long
I have a feeling that Biden has a special important cabinet position for Liz Warren. Something to do with the economy.
Nor will President Biden as he has stated more times than you
Florida teen arrested in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
No we don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm a Bernie voter and Biden has my vote just as Clinton did in 16. You‚Äôve killed 150,000 and tanked our economy. 95 days until we vote you out.
Until then please vote for  in 2020. If you don't vote, or don't vote Biden you are effectively voting for Trump.
Little Gym Jordan should‚Äôve gone to work and stopped the team doctor from molesting all those kids at Thee Ohio State University. So will  ask a question today or just jack off to his own voice for another 5 minutes. Stop waisting the countries time Little Gym. #Biden

Trump 2020 - joe Biden won't get it done he's worse than trump. and he's not a change he was already in the white house for 8 years nothing done really
It is about degrees. I hate Biden but I loathe Trump. I am leaning toward despising Biden but that still is a hair short of loathing. This is voting in America, for me.
Joe Biden‚Äôs tv commercial says he wants to keep Americans safe and healthy. So we can expect him to challenge his own platform committee forcefully on #MedicareForAll.  Right? ü§î
Biden will pick Kamala because she is the most prepared to be President and she will absolutely turn a VP debate into a SNL highlight film making Pence look so stupid. God I wouldn‚Äôt want to debate Kamala, she is a verbal assassin just ask Kavanaugh
Kamala is the most prepared to take the helm of the presidency. In many ways she would be a better choice than Biden himself.
Biden knows some people who like to stroke leg hair.
Here's my honest answer man. I don't care about Biden's cognitive abilities. They could wheel him out Weekend-at-Bernie's-style and I'm still voting for him.
Go hide in your basement with Biden.
Can someone make a Biden bumper sticker that says, ‚ÄúBiden: he doesn‚Äôt have rallies that‚Äôll kill you.‚Äù    Too soon?
I see young kids, who don't remember Byrd very well, showing pictures of Biden with Byrd in the 90s or early 2000s and condemning Biden for doing the photos I say, "Actually, by that time Byrd was much better on race than Biden and shouldn't have had his picture taken with Joe.
Yes you do, but sadly the Canadian People's Party (I was sparring with a Canadian Biden troll) is more like Donald Trump.

"Even if Biden is guilty, he's still much better than Trump. So I believe Tara Reade but I'm voting for Biden."
Exactly!  Biden is center-right at best and would be far-right in the UK or Canada.
Biden is center-right at best and dangerously close to far right.
The Suburbs will Vote Joe Biden President.   #WeWillVote
SAY NO TO JOE BIDEN NO GOOD FOR YOU DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH NOT JUST THE NEWS ON TV THEY SENSOR WHAT YOU SEE &amp; SHOW YOU WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO SEE NOT ALL OF WHAT YOU SHOULD BE SEEING AND KNOWING TRUST ME ON THAT.The effect of cutting old and redundant regulations that have been on the books since the 1950s, and what this has done for the everyday person. Biden had 8 years to do that and did not.

Emanuel Macron shows up in Beruit to show support for the Lebanese people. Can you imagine Donald Trump doing that? No? He most likely hadn't even called them. What happened there is an example of failed Govt. Kinda like here. Vote for Biden 2020. It matters. Trump must go.
Biden said he didn‚Äôt want his kids growing up in a racial jungle
My trump follower landlord came by to fix our frig. I turned on MSNBC. Trump says Joe Biden is against God. I started laughing. He said all campaigns seasons are weird but this one is particularly weird. He went on to tell me that he voted for tRump &amp; he is an ass. But I like
If you Google "images of Joe Biden praying" you'll see many different images of a man humbling himself before God - lost in deep in prayer.  See what you get if you Google the same thing for Trump.
So you‚Äôre saying Biden has a chance to change the constitution, something you haven‚Äôt been able to do? Sounds like he‚Äôd be a powerful leader then.
She‚Äôs ridiculous, dramatic, and thinks Biden is terrific. (i can see through it, even though she claimed a filter)
Unlike Joe Biden, donald trump is a racist.
Also...IL.  Not exactly a place where you need to express your Biden love and GOTV.
"When Democrats and the press warn that Trump will try and override the election result, are they simply being hysterical? Or are they, as psychologists like to say, projecting?"
Not sure how it derails Biden. Probably hurt Trump more.
Also is anyone really out there jumping up and down that Biden is Democrat nominee...   Good lord he can barely talk.
That was my thinking.  These are either non-voters or Trump supporters.  I highly doubt this converts more than a few Biden supporters.  Those circles on the Venn diagram just don‚Äôt intersect.
Find me 50 black voters that were going to vote Biden and will now switch to Kanye.  Either they weren‚Äôt going to vote or are Trump voters...
Photoshopped pictures of Joe Biden in your latest ad. Notice how the Democrats don't have to do that? You look terrible all on your own. You're scared now so the ugly is coming out of you. Deutsche Bank records to Vance. You as one says are in deep doo doo.
Either or. I just want Joe Biden to be president &amp; he should decide the person with whom to share the ticket. Obama &amp; Biden trusted each other. Should be the same for Biden. Plus a majority black cabinet would be really cool. Talk about rooting out systemic racism right?
Oh, we need a lot more polling data to do proper analysis.  I just think it‚Äôs folly to assume Kanye pulls from Biden.  The two are in opposite universes unless ‚Äúblack‚Äù is your only criterion.  He‚Äôs much more like Trump than Biden, so his appeal should be similar.
Sure did Marsha the dude was  committing a crime. Why wouldn‚Äôt they order the AG to investigate. I don‚Äôt think Biden had the authority to order anything at that time now I think of it. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Biden knows about tRumps Adderall habit. He abuses it. Trump has been asked to take the cognitive test bc well just listen to him. Joe Biden has not been asked to take it bc well bc he is all there &amp; has an intellectual brain &amp; more importantly good character. Can't be said of 45
Also, the background was photo shopped on this photo. He isn't alone like it appears in the ad. We need to call this out. It won't stop. God only knows that they will photo shop Biden doing next.
Enter Hillary Clinton :) Jill Biden is more fit than Joe is for office.
Yeah, this won‚Äôt work.  Kanye is both nuts AND wears a #maga hat.  On top of that, polls I saw a month back had him pulling support from Trump, not Biden.
Conservative 79 year old mom said she can‚Äôt vote for Biden because ‚Äúthose democrats keep killing babies, those late term abortions are just awful, and they‚Äôre selling the parts‚Äù üò≥ü§Ø

Of coarse Obama and Biden knew everything, about your team being Russian agents. The repugs card has been pulled. Start some more $hit, the country knows which of you idiots are played by putin. Game on mother fvcker, you and putin are done. #TrumpVirus
One screw-up after another by the catastrophic mayor of NYC. But they voted him in twice, so forgettaboutit.
Vote for Joe Biden
you have. Joe Biden is the man for this moment.
This stuff here Donnie is why u will lose to Biden. America is in pain right now. The randomness of tragedy causes humility. Joe Biden knows loss (loved ones). He has a humility that is what the country needs right now-good honest moral character, empathy &amp; humility-none of which
Lol, no way!  You too!? I usually get it for calling out Democratic hypocrisy on Joe Biden...
I wish Kanye luck.  He‚Äôs pulling disaffected righties, not Biden voters.
I really want to know why it‚Äôs a given that he‚Äôll pull votes from Biden.  Polls I saw with him on them showed the opposite.  He‚Äôs a less-stable Trump but he‚Äôs black.  He‚Äôs still...not right in the head.
It‚Äôs a dumb move.  Kanye is more likely to siphon  votes.  He wears a #MAGA had and is a conspiracy theorist.  Why would he pull from Biden?  Because he‚Äôs black?  Alan Keyes sure didn‚Äôt get many lefty votes in his day...
He may get DOZENS.  And what makes you think he‚Äôll pull from Biden?  The few polls I saw with West on them had him pulling from Trump.  The guy wears a #mags hat, man.

I never thought I‚Äôd say this, but I‚Äôm starting to look forward to Biden debating Trump.   Biden is not a great debater, but even he can ask *one* question to get Trump to completely dissolve into a paper shuffling travesty
Watching the Axios/Swan interview &amp; I still can't believe tRump is POTUS. He is by far the most ignorant person in the world who is a leader of a country. The invisible accordion working overtime. He is a hideous human. Red eyes, can't stay on topic, hugely insecure. Vote Biden.
At least Biden can speak in complete sentences.
Appears most of the comments R from TDS sufferers, so I will balance it all by saying Biden is the worst candidate ever to be offered by a political party. You yahoos are planning to have the VP take over as soon as Biden bows out. Could have your VP stand-in for Joe and debate?
Freddy changes his tune.  Have we passed peak Biden?
Well there are many elections to come hopefully. It will matter mostly to get rid of trump or there may not be any in the future. I think we have some up &amp; coming Bernies out there. Keep the faith &amp; this time vote Biden 2020. It would have been nice tho. I hear you.
If Biden isn‚Äôt available, Trump should debate Kanye
I'd like to think so. But putting a former president in prison is something I don't see happening. The political fall out would be too much. Don't get me wrong, I want him in prison. But a Biden/Dem administration jailing him? Don't see it.
Great iidea!! Have Dennis Miller sit in for Biden?
Really.....is that all you got??? TRUMP 2020!!!!
Let‚Äôs see Joe ‚ÄúBrain Dead‚Äù Biden‚Äôs RIGHT NOW!!!!
Trump and Kanye should have a debate. Biden can join them if he‚Äôs up to it.
BernieBros will do anything to derail Biden‚Äôs campaign. They aren‚Äôt Democrats. Left wing tRumpsters
It's sad. Lots of people forgot what our whole primary campaign was about. It was never about just beating Trump at any cost or we would have just joined Biden and not even had a campaign.
Wait I thought the crime rate was going to go up AFTER Biden was elected??? Someone tell these criminals to hang on for another few months smh
You do know that it's possible to hate Trump and also not like Biden, right?
Gotcha. So, it's only okay to support what Andrew says when you also agree with him. When you don't agree then he made a mistake. Right. I agree. That's why I think he made a mistake in endorsing and stumping for Biden. ü§∑
If you're wondering how Andrew feels about Trump voters... Well, here you go. How do you think he feels about third party voters or those who sit out or those who don't support Biden? Time to pause and reflect #YangGang.
Ok, how do you figure that? Biden is barely going to win this election, if he does. He also said he only wants to do one term, I know Obama said the same thing but this is vastly different most people don‚Äôt like Biden. Most people like Obama, because of his penchant for speaking.
Trump can debate Kanye, Biden can show up if he wants to.
That‚Äôs also what my conservative mom said 2 days ago. She said she‚Äôll have to vote for Trump again because of the ‚Äúkilling babies‚Äù part. Other than that she‚Äôd go for Biden.
Someone needs to create a troll video NOW with Biden and Obama fighting Trump with light sabers.  Trump gets two small ones to move w/his hands every time he does that accordion motion he does.
No vote for Biden is a vote for tRump! PoliSci 101
In the bag for Biden: CO, MN, MI, and I think PA (his birth state)  I'd bet on Biden: WI, FL, NV, NH  I wouldn't bet on Trump: AZ, OH  True toss-ups: TX, GA, IA, NC  This is Biden-friendly ground.
Oh, Lord.  CO will be Biden +12 or something.
Why for Biden? I'm concerned.
That‚Äôs because, as of today, once Biden gets to a 6-7 pt lead, TX and GA come into play and, if you‚Äôre running a simulation that result in a 4-5 pt win, some scenarios show you at +6-7 and that‚Äôs when those states tip.
Looks like you can scratch one POC off Joe Biden's short list for VP.
During the time of Barry and Joe, China bought up land, housing tracts, corporations and flooded our market with cloned merch. Trump needs to nationalize all of it - but it‚Äôs the only leverage we have. COVID-19 and Chicom funding of Biden‚Äôs campaign are China‚Äôs response.
Yes.  Nov 3 when we elect Joe BIDEN!
All over my state Biden sticksers &amp; yard signs. No signs of trump. Even his followers are embarrassed any more. You sir are stupid.
You mean Brain dead Biden???
I don‚Äôt see why predictable is a problem for Biden.
Are this dense Joshua? I wasn't talking about Biden. Biden is a centrist. I'm talking about cancel culture. Yes, I have read Biden's plan and it doesn't cancel my debt. Learn to take a joke and stop following me. I helped you with the last part.
Really surprised at your inability to take a joke. This tweet wasn't even about Biden. I have read Biden's platform and he's against cancelling any of my graduate school debt.
Only undergraduate debt according to Biden's policy page. Most of my debt is from my graduate work.
Good luck with that....ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
Nice try...TRUMP 2020!!!
He didn‚Äôt molester right?? Move along.
I remember millions loved Howdy Doody (Biden) and she‚Äôs up there with him as Princess FailedCommonSenseTest. While Ilhan is Clarabelle and Pressley is Phineas T. Buster‚Äôs wife, Tlaib is Chief Thunderthud.  Disney wants to reboot the whole series once they‚Äôre voted out.
You're incredibly wrong here. Saying we should all support Biden or we're off base makes us seem like a cult. That's the stuff Ori and Noah have been spreading. I'm against it and I'm speaking out.
You insinuating Biden is a pedophile?  I mean hate the dems, hate the system, overthrow whatever but WTF you accuse a guy of being a pedophile? Is Obama not a US citizen too? That BS came from the same people.
We're not even asking for much. I'd even go hard for Biden if he said he supported "the concept of UBI" or EVEN just Emergency UBI. Not asking for much here. Give me something.
You know what, Biden wasn't my first choice, but I am supporting him 100%, and I will continue to do the same if picks a ham sandwich for a running mate. People need to focus and not forget the peril we are in.
If you say anything critical of Biden then you're telling people not to vote for him now. You didn't know Matt?
You're deluding yourself. Biden has said he'd veto M4A and he isn't even for emergency UBI.
Have you taken a look at Biden's record? Sounds like you haven't. This argument was about Biden and not Trump. I hate Trump and I think  Biden is slightly better but still bad. Both things can true. The world is full of grey.
Biden isn't for UBI. I support UBI candidates. Where's the disconnect? Biden isn't for single-payer healthcare. I support candidates that support that. Where's the disconnect?
Ironic because everything that I do has been to help down-ballot Yang Gang candidates since Yang dropped. Being critical of Biden isn't necessarily "trashing" and one can be critical while also supporting the down-ballot.
I have a feeling that Biden has a special important cabinet position for Liz Warren. Something to do with the economy.
Nor will President Biden as he has stated more times than you
Exactly! Also, we never liked establishment Democrats or why the hell would be have been Yang Gang? We want a smart savvy outsider and that's not Joe freaking Biden. He's more of the same. He won't even support Emergency UBI right now. That's pathetic.
And who did that? Both Democrats and Republicans. Lots of Biden's friends, too!
Dear #Resistance,  Please evict Trump from your head.  States run elections on the date set by Congress; the EC elects the President on the date set by Congress.  Trump's power is equal to Biden's (read: nonexistent) here.  Here's why he's floating this:
...and NOTHING about Trump or his campaign operation says "competence" to me.  He'll tweet about it, get bored, say he was treated unfairly, challenge some votes, blah blah blah.  But he doesn't have any more power than Biden does here.  Sorry.
Same. Tweets are the least of our damn problems. Biden needs to come out for UBI. At the very least emergency UBI. He's out of touch.
Little Gym Jordan should‚Äôve gone to work and stopped the team doctor from molesting all those kids at Thee Ohio State University. So will  ask a question today or just jack off to his own voice for another 5 minutes. Stop waisting the countries time Little Gym. #Biden
SAME.  I see Warren as having the stomach &amp; mind for the fight ahead, which Harris hasn't shown. The Biden administration can be diverse like America, but it needs to do so with personnel matched to their own best positions.
Biden is like the lowest common denominator for the Democratic Party and that's *still* a fucking huge improvement on Trump.
Go hide in your basement with Biden.
'Cheat-Sheet' Biden's 5 Simple Kamala Harris Talking Points Revealed
#MANA Make America Normal Again. Vote Joe Biden 2020.
Exactly James. I'm not going hard for Biden. I may vote for him while holding my nose but that's different than offering my support! No, thank you.  However, I'll likely vote for Mark Charles because he's at least pro-UBI and has better ideas to make things better.
Kamala Harris would literally be the worst person joe Biden could pick for a VP... like any chance at rallying all of the left behind him would just vanish
Biden called this shit months ago and the trump lickers mocked him for it.
Didn't Biden predict this?
Remember when Biden banned raves? lol good times jk that sucked.
Biden wants to protect ACA by giving larger tax credits and expanding Medicaid. This is fine but it won't solve the overall cost issue like single-payer would. His public option is a Medicare buy-in but no details listed anywhere.
Also, Yang speaks highly of everyone and he would do the same for whoever the nominee ended up being. I don't understand why this is hard for everyone to understand. Biden is highly problematic. Look at his record. It should be obvious why I won't go hard for him.
Trust his instincts? Why are you acting like he's the only one supporting Joe Biden? Everyone is stumping for him. He's the Democratic nominee. It's not some radical position. Again, we are not the cult of Yang. I don't have to support Biden bc Yang does.
This thread is worth reading. I hope Biden has a special seat picked out for her in his cabinet!
Is the Burisma issue ever going to surface?  We have the poster boy for dementia, the Dem candidate Biden, on TV bragging about withholding a billion dollar loan to the Ukraine unless a prosecutor investigating his son‚Äôs company is fired? A quid pro quo, and do not let it die!
Sounds like a conspiracy theory to me ! Easy way to get Biden out the way ! Can some say ‚ÄúThe Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äú are involved! Lol üòÜ
This means Biden rallies are still happening üòú
Sadly, I think they're just trying to keep spirits up... by sharing anything we know showing Joe Biden *could* win.  Personally, if I were ever to hear someone say their vote wouldn't matter, I'd give them the long explanation, then the short explanation, then... üò†!
Covid-19 will disappear, as if by magic, on Nov. 3rd if Biden wins. If Trump wins - no church, no school, masks required everywhere, no attendance at sports, social distancing, further destruction of the economy, until Jan. 21st, 2025.
Ugh these ethical questions. Ok so I would probably put on my Biden 2020 cap (which I keep in my car) make sure my mask is snug &amp; help them. I would be nice &amp; polite so they understand that's who Democrats are. You?West, in text interview, indicates he is in fact running to siphon votes from Joe Biden.
No, even my pet spider, Barry, said he &amp; his spider clan were voting for Biden ... then he ate a mosquito.üï∑Ô∏è
Radical left of Biden- you say! Joke!  Trump‚Äôs a fascist dictator- destroying American founding principles and our democratic republic- be ashamed for spreading dangerous lies. The rich need to pay more taxes!
Liar- Biden doesn‚Äôt stand for the radical left-wing. It‚Äôs just because your a radical right that you want to spread lies and misinformation
Unchristian that this would be used against Biden AND what a deflection from the real racist!
Yes, I‚Äôm 62 yrs old, diabetic &amp; I smoke cigarettes, I will quit when Biden wins in November. I might have to wait until January bc trumps voice &amp; antics, being pathological liar, constantly embarrassing us along w/ #ComplicitCorruptGOP makes me smoke more, UGH!! Can I sue them?
Id love to blame it on dementia but we all know that Biden is a racist. Not that hard to find his previous racist remarks.
Typical. Makes a racist remark yet everyone looks away. If trump said this it would be the end of the world. The Dems are hypocritical. Especially biden. He has a rich past of being racist.
Joe "the racist" biden
CORRECT! Thank you President Biden!!
He‚Äôs absolutely wacko and sounds very, very desperate.  Grabbing at everything he can think of to try to disparage Biden.  Guns, God, Energy.  All in the same breath.
He is only going to get more and more unhinged as we get closer to election day...... soon, he'll be saying "Joe Biden is just a bunch of snakes wearing a trenchcoat!"
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt treat women as sexual objects for one!! Trump has had everything given to him, threatens people for other things, lied and cheated and he‚Äôs failed at all businesses he‚Äôs own. It‚Äôs taken executives at banks and others who invested with him to bail him out!!
We can send ballots without the debate Donald. Mr. Biden should not debate you because you prevaricate and bully. It will be a waste of his time.
I'm not sure if you've mentioned this, because I've been on a deliberate media blackout, but I think the left has something planned that's so big Biden makes a convenient Fall Guy.
A Fourth debate to try and get it right at least the fourth time. He can‚Äôt handle Biden anyway.
I assume I can't just pick "who do I think should be President" in this scenario (probably Romney - sorry :) ). Of plausible Dems before Biden limited, Klobuchar (who I would have preferred over Biden for POTUS). Between Rice and Harris, I'm not certain. It's hard for me...
Biden will accept the nomination remotely as is far and away the only way to be safe. We need as many people as possible to be able to stay safe.
I'm intrigued. Who, exactly, are these voters that a) take the time to vote; and b) think "Biden was my guy, but Yeezy is on my ballot!"?   (and who are the GOPers that are willing to spend money on this idea?)
Not overlooking anything with Biden- Trump‚Äôs mentally unwell and unstable to be leading along with being a sexist misogynist, racist, xenophobe, homophobe who is using his position for his own family‚Äôs position and wealth. trump befriends all fascists. DISGUSTING you‚Äôd vote Trump
In all due respect for Biden- why should democratic candidates be tested, show birth certificates, taxes and be held at a higher standard than the corrupt baffoon in office?
Purely in terms of strategy, Harris seems like the obvious choice for Biden (not who I would prefer). Passes C-in-C test, voters know her to enough of a degree that it prevents defining her, least likely to depress any bloc of voters. Leaves election as referendum on POTUS.
The media is not covering, Biden is kicking trump's ass without straining. And, since you have a bumbling idiot that lies constantly for a candidate‚Ä¶
We did, but you were too drunk to remember.üòÇ
Can we see Biden‚Äôs interview next?
Ronna. Please highlight ,in Biden‚Äôs plan ,where he said he would defund the police and then post that.  Click-bate much? Monsters. The lot of you.
Here is a good opinion piece in the WSJ countering NYT. I apologize if there is a paywall. Otherwise you can find it on Twitter.
I agree. We need her strength and fire in that role. But if she doesn't want it, then VP fine too.  I think she'll hate that job though. And Rice would turn it into a powerful addition to Biden, and be a great interface with the international community.
Filled out my ballot and proudly voted for Joe Biden. #biden2020
Good thing he supports Biden.
2020 Electoral Map Ratings: Trump Slides, Biden Advantage Expands Over 270 Votes
Ever hear about vetting? That‚Äôs why #trump and his band of incompetences always have, ‚Äúacting‚Äù ppl in charge. He always announces who he wants before they completely check their backgrounds.  VP Biden knows what‚Äôs at stake for this presidency.
I‚Äôd crawl a mile over broken glass to vote AGAINST you no matter what Biden surprise you come up with in November. Yes, you are hated and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it.
No matter what, trump will be gone on January 20, 2021. If it's not President Joe Biden it would automatically become madame President Nancy Pelosi!  YEAH!
Joe Biden would be toasting marshmellows over the fire.
Only the 300 million people who have died from it in the US... Isn‚Äôt  that what Biden claimed at one point?
After Biden is inaugurated in January, we need an independent commission to investigate the Trump administration‚Äôs mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic. Individuals‚Äîincluding Donald Trump and Jared Kushner‚Äîshould be held criminally liable for mass American death.
Good point. The Bush‚Äôs are probably voting for Biden, unforgivable knowing what we know now.
Kinda like Biden - if you aren't smart enough to follow the conversation, I can't help you...
Obama/Biden plotted a coup attempt, seems newsy.
Surveilling U.S. citizens in the line of duty and fully within their constitutional rights. This is how fascism comes to America.   The Department of Homeland Security needs to be dismantled in the Biden Administration.
Patience never visited me with this stupid.
Biden saw this coming
A Republic, if you can keep it.  NYTimes
I concur. There are more qualified candidates for VP. Harris would be a great AG.
I got a $1,200 class action check for Safeway last year. I didn't even file for it. Maybe I win .... üòÇEven if Joe Biden gets elected to the white house he will still be Obama's butt bitch
When Joe Biden was vice president of the united states all those 8 years he was President Obama's butt bitch all those 8 years and Joe Biden is still Obama's butt bitch
No one is worried about Biden himself. Biden is now a puppet for the extremist Left...and yes the Left does have power and depending on your definition of "God" and "destroy" they can and will do that as well.
‚ÄúUnlike the African American community with notable exceptions.‚Äù More proof Biden sees black Americans as a monolithic entity.
When people see Biden try to ‚Äúspeak‚Äù without preparation or a teleprompter...yeah I‚Äôm guess a lot of votes will be swayed.
I think you meant ‚ÄúBiden family‚Äù   You were referring to the Burisma documents the Feds confiscated today yeah?
Would be easy- Biden is a jogger
No.  Trump vs Biden is actually Fascism vs Freedom.  Or, Lunacy vs Sanity.  Even Dictator vs Democracy if we don‚Äôt get rid of Trump and #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
No you have it wrong Biden is going to lose.  The only thing Democrats care about is power and control.
The lesser of two evils is the better choice when choices are down to that.   is pure evil.  Biden is not.I‚Äôm having a hard time today... I just can‚Äôt anymore with 45*‚Äôs and the GOP‚Äôs lies, especially regarding Joe Biden and the democrats. I know he‚Äôs projecting and desperate, but enough is enough.
Sylvie,Biden apologizes bc, even at his age and his many years as a prominent leader, he is human, therefore fallible, and is willing to both learn and embrace the changes his behavior requires. I‚Äôd rather have an honest penitent than an irresponsible and unapologetic nincompoop.

In the past week, two separate and very painful videos have circulated showing Donald Trump and Joe Biden the presidential nominees of the two major US political parties in action. Watching them, there‚Äôs only one conclusion we can reach: we‚Äôre so screwed.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden told NPR on Thursday that while he was unsure if it was ‚Äúgood for democracy,‚Äù if elected he would not stand in the way of a hypothetical Justice Department prosecution of President Donald.....
Biden's potential running mate worked as a consultant for foreign governments. It's not clear who her clients were.
The Los Angeles representative, a top contender to be Biden‚Äôs running mate, is respected by both Democratic and Republican colleagues
To make a progressive future possible, beating Trump is absolutely necessary while very far from sufficient.
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said the president's comments were ‚Äúbeneath the office he holds.‚Äù

joe biden‚Äôs latino outreach program off to a great start!
Lol he was QUOTING the mayor of New Orleans in 1985. The mayor of NOLA was a mean racist ans congress (with joe Biden) told him to piss off. So no he did not say that , troll
Any white person who turns away from Biden for choosing a Black woman as VP is racist. This election requires a Black VP female candidate. The strength and dedication of Black women is needed by our country.
trump can‚Äôt keep his bullshit straight. One day, Biden is a senile old man who can barely stand. The next day, Biden is destroying the Almighty and the Bible. Which is it?
Our Revolution Our voices can no longer be ignored. We need #MedicareForAll - NOW!
The president should not be part of any decisions about any prosecutions. Biden will nominate an AG who bows only to the Constitution.

This is the thing I don‚Äôt like about blk dems. If we as blks can‚Äôt escape from being victims if Biden laws no matter who‚Äôs potus. Then why blk dems constantly letting Biden escape from his accounts of Biden law. Unless the CBC is full of sambos. How can they let this man slide
This why he stick for all the targeting laws as if god wrote it. His laws are responsible for many unlawful deaths in the blk community by corrupted cops. Then you got these blk dems who act as if they don‚Äôt know Biden as if he‚Äôs a good guy.
I remember a quote about joe Biden that I see is happening today. Joe Biden has made everything a death penalty for blacks except j walking. I added the black bc at that time and even today he want to see blacks eliminated.
When I heard about George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and the many of ppl that died by the police to factors comes to my mind. 1 is slave patrol and the cops are the samething as well as the feds making it public that the police is corrupted. 2. This is the results of BIDEN LAWS
Watch: Fact-checker meticulously breaks down how the Trump campaign ‚Äòegregiously altered‚Äô Biden photos in new ad
So Biden admin would rather spin $280 mil on ads with black targeted media brands then actual black media. That says a lot about the person the dems want blks to vote for.
Nice of you to campaign against Biden.

Ugh!! Bad choices
Did some research on how powerful blk media is there is over 2 million ppl listening to straight blk media. And that‚Äôs just on yt with the same message reparations no tangibles for blacks no black vote and Biden is the worse of the worse of racists
Biden is the same dude who wanted a blk men who sold crack to get the death penalty while his son snorted and sold coke and get a slap on the wrist. Biden is hitler for blks.

When trump sez infected going by cases reported has more weight than infected while taking into account the entire population, that's telling.  He doesn't believe science. That sort of thing is why Biden may landslide Donald Doofus this fall!!
Biden can always change his mind. The alternative is unpalatable.
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.
This is a very solid call on the white women who supported the p*ssy grabber mostly out of dislike for Hillary. Sen. Harris has been on my choice list, first with Warren, and now with Biden. I lived in CA practicing law for 20+ years and I both like and respect her.
The vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that's more attuned to gender and racial biases.
I don‚Äôt know what it is but i always mix up joe Biden and Bill Clinton
A president should preside. Biden knew how to veep as Obama's second in command. Biden won't court disaster.

But black will never forget slavery Jim Crow the war on drugs and Biden law or Obama housing crisis. These are all black holocausts and to vote for a man who created one of them is voting for the devil.
I can compare joe Biden to hitler I can‚Äôt really do the same with trump I can compare trump to any slimeball ny white business man but joe for me and many black oh this is hitler. You see all this that‚Äôs going on right now most of it will be forgotten
In a show of solidarity with Biden, I am hereby not picking YOU for VP.  I, however, remain available.
But then won‚Äôt say nothing about joe Biden racism. Matter of fact they treat joe as if ,in his own words, ‚Äúhe knows what best for the negro‚Äù. He think jails and slavery is the best thing going. This is why we must vote no on joe.

Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

Vote and return ourballots as soon as possible!  Biden and his competent team are gonna be so busy fixing all that Trump has broken.
I'll like him until the election is over (that is, until after the Biden inauguration).
Yes, we have Vice President Biden as our nominee.  And you have donald as yours.  See you in November.
And, actually that‚Äôs really sad! Because that means that absolutely nobody cares about what Joe Biden has to say. They‚Äôre just going to vote for him regardless. Because Donald Trump has fucked up so bad that no matter what Biden says he‚Äôs going to win the vote.
I have wondered for a while if a trump campaign plan is to get the Biden camp to release a pandemic plan and then see if they can win an electoral college majority from folks voting for death.
I happy for every single vote that changes from Trump to Biden. I'll welcome them and hope they bring more with them.
Victory for Biden in 2020 is a victory for Western democracy akin to the fall f the Berlin Wall and the defeat of the Axis.  If we pull it off.  If we fail, it will be a disaster equivalent to an Axis victory or the fall of NATO to the Warsaw Pact.
Do black ppl really want to vote for joe Biden who is responsible for over a million black men locked up and thousands on thousands dead right now today by the hands of police. He‚Äôs responsible for the Obama laws which of right now got all ppl in debt and suffering
Matter of fact even though it haven‚Äôt been easy it‚Äôs been a cakewalk under Donald trump then any of a white senator laws that was made in 1994. If you think I‚Äôm lying ask all the dead black ppl and the ones locked up about the affects of Biden laws.

The president has also said we should "look into" using sunlight internally to combat C-19, and that Biden will "hurt God". He retweets video from "doctors" who believe endometriosis is caused by having sex with demons in your sleep, and made up an invitation from the Yankees.
I really hope they don't shaft Biden if Trump loses. He literally gave up his last couple of years of functionality. I disagree with his belief that it was necessary to save the republic, but that sacrifice should be recognized regardless.

How come when Joe Biden tweets to clarify his horrific racist comments he sounds totally different than when he talks. It's as if a different person is tweeting for him. Weird.

Only the first one was racist. The other two are taken out of context.  The Latin comment was about the various countries they come from (Latin America) which isn‚Äôt the case for many black Americans DUE TO SLAVERY.  Biden saying Americans are racist against Asians isn‚Äôt racist.
I feel we as a party need to be more pragmatic  and less puritanical. Biden's not perfect. Harris is not perfect, but they're who we got and they're better than the incumbent. Simple as that.

Joe Biden is a flat out racist. If Trump had said what Biden has said in recent days, lefty media would have completely melted down. But with Biden, not a peep.

Either Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. I'm leaning toward Warren because she could draw more Progressive Democrats out to vote for Biden. This strategy worked for JFK incredibly well in 1960.

That's not to say Biden couldn't find more progressive women if he wanted to. Obviously, he doesn't want to. So you look at what's there, and you have Karen Bass, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris who have any significant progressive credibility.  Pretty easy choice for Biden.
No surprise.  Also, I think, aside from Warren, you don't get any more progressive of a VP pick by Biden. Despite her cop background, which isn't going to sit well with a lot of people, she has more credibility than he does on any one of a number of policy issues.  Example:
Dr Jill Biden will be a breath of fresh air, compared to Melanie the Ex (we believe) Hooker FLOTUS.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ And you say Biden can't speak correctly. This is just one of many verbal goofs you have made Donny.
Frankly I wouldn't blame the Biden campaign for just skipping debates. Any debate will just be 45 lying his ass off and yelling for 2 hours.
Putting pressure on Ukraine to get dirt on biden! Telling people that everything is fake news while he flat out lies to the public. Siding with putin over our own intelligent agencies. Sabotaging our institutions by installing people to destroy our institutions!
The truth is, there is no VP candidate currently being considered that will improve the ticket. Biden is pathetic, and his VP selection will be worse. I would delay it as long as possible too.
I am born Canadian and I have faith that we the people will end this debacle in under 100 days by electing Joe Biden and maybe overturn the Senate, too.

Read the Unity Task Force recommendation and realize that making all of that possible is impossible and any attempt will ruin our currency and seriously raise our taxes. Biden signed this document and is committed to it.
No one will be making up their minds based on debates. No need for them at this pt, IMO. But, watching Trump sweat and snort compared to Biden composure would be reassuring.
You keep saying everything would be so bad under Biden, but it‚Äôs already incredibly bad under your leadership...
could Biden In fact sign ONE executive order as POTUS that overturns all of Trump‚Äôs exec orders or will he have to undo them one by one? Seriously. Not meaning to be glib.

Maybe Biden is getting that feedback now.  I'll support whoever the nominee is.
Or M4A? Think how we could be more productive 8n the marketplace? We are a nation of consumers, are we not? So, why not support it, Creepy Joe Biden?
I like Warren - a lot.  I honestly think she can accomplish greater things such as revisioning the education system - my #1 priority.  However,  ... &amp; this is true for whichever woman Biden picks, is that she'll be put into the VP 'role' &amp; her hands will be tied.
Me, too.  We need both right now.  Biden is excellent w ppl &amp; compassion &amp; Harris scares the criminals..... so?? lol, what's the decision?
YES!  I hope we get pages so Biden can see them &amp; his advisors as well.  HARRIS - ALL THE WAY!  you-who!!
Man, your parents really did hurt you, didn't they! You are a sad petty man in search of praise. True Leaders actually lead without the need for acknowledgment of their performance. Biden will be sooooo much better than you!
Rice has too many associations w the past; it would open up all the events of the time.  Just sayin' - there 'many' good ppl.  I hope Biden finds ways to use them ALL in a team approach to put the USA back on a secure track to move the country forward &amp; lead the world once again.

We deserve to know who paid her to make those accusations and MSM needs to make public apology to public and Biden, IMO
LOL... yes, why now?  at the most, they have 6 mos left &amp; now she's going to tear up the Rose Garden (read hx) &amp; add her own "Midas" touch to it?  Perhaps red Christmas trees all made of roses in an eerie Portia environment?  I'm sure Jill Biden can put it back together again.
Biden deserves to have his name cleared. She deserves jail for lying &amp; all media should be apologizing for putting out her story w/o more research first. Most importantly, who put her up to it? Not okay to shove under the rug, imo. If we ignore it, they can pull that shit again!
Sorry, but I think everyone deserves to hear the truth. She should be forced to admit that she lied, on air. Media and everyone should apologize to Biden and learn to look deeper before spouting or repeating shit! To just have it fade away w/ a shrug seems wrong.
Maybe so. But doesn‚Äôt the media have a responsibility to report that her story was fabricated? Don‚Äôt you think Biden deserves a huge apology?

Biden was the first Catholic VP in US history.  Catholics make up a quarter of American voters (think Hispanic vote, amongst others). Once again, Trump is all about projection - he's the one without religion and more to the point, without a soul.

I vote by mail since 1998. Not only am I going to vote I‚Äôm voting for Biden. He‚Äôs lying again vote by mail is safe, convenient, we have no voter fraud. Record turnouts. He knows he‚Äôs losing
We should not set up either/or choices when the reality is Black voters will turn out to vote for Biden bur Biden &amp; the entire Democratic Party have all ignored these systemic issues that impact Black voters each generation. Dems should speak to this now!
New Low for Trump &amp; GOP  GOP operatives with ties to Trump are actively helping Kanye West get on presidential general election ballots in states to siphon off black votes from Biden  Using a man with a mental disorder (West's bi-polar) is abuse &amp; an act of desperation  SAD
And we are all tired and warn out!  I echo Joe Biden in this pic. Look Christians!  This is what a real Christian looks like in humility and prayer. Remember?
Notice that I didn't criticize the possession of arms, just the veneration. I believe in an armed citizenry as a check upon tyranny. But I don't favor the adulation of violence, the use of battle as an arbitrator of first resort. I was finding common ground with Biden
Correct. That's the only reason why I'm voting for Biden.   Then I begin working to elect a #Progressive for 2024.   If Biden surprises me great, I'll change but he must prove it to me.
I'll fight for politicians who do not take Wall Street bribes.   I'm voting for Biden ONLY because he's not Trump.   #JusticeDems are the people I will fight for.
To those well meaning Dems who tell us not to highlight Biden's corporate record.   I ask you to consider the below accomplishments by #JusticeDems.   They are winning because they're telling Americans the truth, not pretending Biden is a champion of the working class.
No there is not. ALL think profit motive is best way to deliver social services. So corrupt.  Don't fall for John Kasich either.   Corporate Dems going to use Kasich as a prop, but Kasich will be rewarded by Wall St if Biden wins then lecture us how #MedicareForAll is 'bad'.
I will NOT pretend Joe Biden is my choice.  I will NOT pretend Joe Biden is not a corporate toadie. I will NOT take it easy on Joe Biden on health care, filthy oil.  We did that for Hillary &amp; Trump outflanked her on her left and lost.   Biden has a chance. Wall St or Main St.
Respectfully, do you really think America believes Joe Biden is a champion of the working man?   He'll win only because Trump is so vile. If R's ran someone moderate against Biden, Biden would probably lose.
To pretend Biden is a champion of the working class will not work Tricia. It insults voters &amp; corporate Dems better grasp it.   They tried that with Hillary &amp; lost to Trump (who ran as a populist).   We will not earn Indie votes by insulting their intelligence.
Had enough of U.S. Senators telling me "somebody better do something".   I'm voting for Biden ONLY because he's not Trump. The second he's sworn in, if he is, I'm working to elect a #Progressive in 2024.   #Enough of this crap. Zero left to give sir.
Biden is the only choice. But why haven't Biden and the Democratic Party addressed these issues as a priority? If they haven't done it before, haven't done it now, what will compel them to do it while in power when they ignored these issues in the past?
Biden lacks the vision, insight, knowledge &amp; capacity to speak with a compelling persuasive voice that can motivate young Black Americans. The Democratic Party writ large suffers the same malady. But the GOP is against their interests; what will they do?
White moderates agreed to the 1872 Amnesty Act &amp; "Great Compromise" of 1877 with white supremacists. White moderates don't want systemic change. They don't value Black lives over the status quo because they are status quo beneficiaries. Biden's value? He isn't Trump. That's it.

President Biden, don't debate an evil corrupt clownish idiot for the entertainment of his white supremacist constituency.  Instead, choose Elizabeth Warren as VP and let her go toe-to-toe with Mike Pence. Charge the viewing audience on Pay-per-View &amp; fund the economic recovery.
üéâ Happy Birthday Mr. President üéä  America misses your compassion, your caring, your intelligence, your moral leadership. We can't wait until we have that again in Joe Biden.

Their right about Joe.   I'm voting for Biden ONLY because he's not Trump.   I've had enough of 'we can't afford to use your money to help you, but we can bail out Wall St again.   Yeah, enough of that &amp; after this if Dems want my vote ever again they better wake up.
Biden voter...
#Pelois must ensure this bail out lasts thru January 2021 &amp; helps workers.  If shorter, Republicans will refuse to help right as Biden is elected &amp; blame everything on him.  Play political hardball like you've never played before Dems.

I have to wonder why Pelosi, Schumer, Biden aren't making political hay from this.   Seriously, the Republican POTUS announced it yet isn't following thru on something so important &amp; Dems let it slide like no big deal.   I wonder why?

Guys - we demand D's fight harder and when they do, we get nervous.   I don't like corporate Dems for sure, but they're right this time. If we took 4 mo deal, just as Biden wins power would swing to R's about evictions.   Come on team be strong. Don't cave now.
- I disagree Ana. Republicans must make a deal or evictions will happen under Trump.   Dems have leverage so now is not the time to give in. Finally, Pelosi playing hardball and she's right. Too late, but if cave then giving R's power when Biden wins.
Yes! George w took gop super pac funds from trumps campaign and gave it to Biden! Ouch gotta hurt    #ripjohnlewis honor vote engage to keep voting fair
Emma sadly, since a true #progressive seems out of the question I'm leaning towards Susan Rice.   May I ask your thoughts about her? There's a good chance Biden may not last 4 yrs. I don't wish him harm but at his age he can pass at any time.   Thank you Emma.
There goes Trump's October surprise!   The House issued a subpoena as part of an investigation into Pompeo's ‚Äúapparent use of Department of State resources to advance a political smear of former VP Biden.‚Äù   Sen. Ron Johnson &amp; Devin Nunes are also complicit in the scheme
The way to do things is neither conservative nor liberal but with intelligence and finesse. We need balanced and effective policies to inaugurate a great American renaissance. Great works await your willingness to hear me. Otherwise, Biden will win as the reform candidate.

I don't think any Democrat would mind welcoming President Pelosi. Let's say the election happens, Biden wins, Trump cries fraud, it ends up in court and he refuses to leave. I think if January 20th comes &amp; Trump hasn't left, the speaker can call the Secret Service or US Marshals.

I do think that‚Äôs true in part. WHEN we elect Joe Biden as POTUS, we will have a sane President again who actually cares about ALL Americans including the ones who didn‚Äôt vote for him. That said: We have a rough road ahead to mop up 45‚Äôs &amp; his admin‚Äôs messes.
Trump's cosmopolitanism is good. Non-Trump cosmopolitanism is bad. Trump misspeaking is not misspeaking, it's him doing something cosmopolitan that little liberal minds don't understand. Biden misspeaking is a sign he's brain damaged. Come on man, keep up! It's just logic.

Trump‚Äôs latest attack on Joe Biden is stunningly delusional ‚Äî even for him -
He is aware of the damage he will cost the good people of this nation. If he wants to get in the race to pull votes from Biden and award trump, he deserves ridicule and plenty of it.
Indeed! While VP Biden is outlining his many plans for helping America conquer COVID-19 and putting America back on track, 45 is using the same old tired game plan from 2016. Use VP Biden as the boogie man. Make up anything, no matter how outlandish. to land the vote. üëé

Please note: 45 has not been telling us one thing that he intends to do in his next administration. His so-called campaign is all about making Biden the boogie man. Biden tells us every day what his plans are for his administration and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden.

I welcome investigating everyone who can be shady.  The fact biden isn't acting like a b*tch like trump is shows trump is hiding something.   I say who ever is guilty needs to be held accountable.  I can do that with my people I support.  Can you say the same?
Dude. Unless its actually found guilty he is innocent till proven guilty right ? You use that line with trump and his 27 accusers. So until then. Let their be investigations. But its funny you want biden looked in to but when others do it to trump you guys cry witch hunt!!

Oh the irony! Spending part of one's day to prove a quote by Donald Trump is 100% bullshit, but that quote is a response to a quote by Joe Biden that is also 100% bullshit. Thank goodness for checkyourfact, huh Jess?
That's funny because you think that makes your friends look bad. But meanwhile you don't even realize Joe Biden never actually said any on that. üòÇ
Really, because he committed to the debate. But okay, if you say so.
'This shit is actual reality." It's a picture of Biden and a quote he didn't say! It's the same bullshit the left pulled when they said Trump wants everyone to inject bleach. More shit no one really said.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying Biden will win the election. I'm saying painting Biden with this baby food-eating old man brush will backfire at the first debate. Setting the bar so low means he only has to seem semi competent and it'll make people rethink his viability.
Considering we're both commenting on a funny quote by Biden that is 100% fake, then yes, I'm saying he's being painted. I'm not saying it's a thick coat of paint. I've seen the same gaffes you have. All I'm saying is exaggerating his senility will backfire come the 1st debate.
This strategy of painting Biden to be a dimentia-having drooling old man will backfire when he beats Trump in their first debate (because historically the incumbent always loses the first debate) and it makes Trump look that much worse that a senile old man bested him.
is correct. I've been telling you that #BeijingIntercourseJoe is #Xitler's Presidential candidate who &amp; whose son Hunter Biden have been bought by #CCP China. Must watch the Manchurian Candidate movie. I like Frank Sinatra original version.
At the minimum GOPer Johnson is willing to commit treason to attack Biden.   THat is why you should insist that there be reporters at the convention.  They need a light shined on them.
He says, and I quote, "no, we will beat Biden fair and square". What part of that do you not understand?
I mean..I‚Äôm gonna be drunk and/or stoned when I fill in Biden‚Äôs name because omg is he a piece of shit but I can‚Äôt not vote. This is just a shitty election
One thing I notice when Biden speaks is that the Interviewer completely ignores and/or gives the Interviewee a Pass by acting that the Interview just answered their question in a coherent manner. This approach only makes the Interviewer/Interviewee look Stupid to the Audience!
Biden‚Äôs VP pick: A shrinking list of top contenders
I think the GOP insiders also recognize that Trump is toxic down ballot in a way that Pence is not. Biden's biggest asset is that he's not Trump. Take that away, and I think the race becomes much more competitive all around.
For real though, it's probably the GOP's only chance of turning this thing around, short of some sort of October surprise about Biden. But even then, they've flooded the zone with so much bullshit that it's hard to see anything they say being believed by anyone not in the cult.
Since #BillClintonIsAPedo is trending, let's not forget his good friend, Joe Biden, who is on camera, multiple times, inappropriately touching kids  #Biden2020
Biden can drink water and walk down a ramp, not to mention listen to doctors so 150K people don‚Äôt die.  But cool story, bro!  #MAGAts
She‚Äôs a true weirdo I don‚Äôt know what to believe about Alyssa; I loved her as an actor but dislike her now that I see her true colors. She supports Joe Biden?? Wtf!!
I speak with a lot of truck drivers. Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Guatemalans, Ukrainians, Romanians, Blacks, Whites..you name it. They are all voting Trump. They were broke under Obama and they are broke now because of the shamdemic.  Pretty sure only the Chinese are voting Biden.
Alright guys let's be real. I dislike this women probably as much as most of you. But if she puts REAL weight behind a #UBI, im gonna support her and biden (dont currently). The ultimate goal is #UBI, not being nit picky who implements it. Ideas?
We will, Biden will fix everything you‚Äôve fucked up over the last four years!  #YesWeCanAgain
She got the WallSt money because she was Hillary's protege'. Connections.  Pelosi told Biden to pick Harris and he will.
And it seems to be working for Biden in this case. He has been rather quiet and quiet works when everyone slings feces and dirty laundry. I know we will learn... and we must hit some form of rock bottom before we realize our shortcomings. But we must learn to be better.

If I could pick a VP, I'd go with Karen Bass or Nina Turner. But Biden has his marching orders. He'll pick Clintonista Kamala. Horrid choice.
Wow! I was only joking by calling #BeijingIntercourseJoe #Xitler's agent man 4 US President. Now Joe is Xitler's agent man Hunter Biden's father. That must be the real reason #CCPüá®üá≥gave Hunter Biden USD$1.5 billion. Hunter Biden is theüåê's most expensive agent man. Xi pays 1 4 2.
Means that 27% don't know what is going on. And some have been bought by China, like Biden.
In these last hundred days huh? The choice is jolting into clarity...  Biden/? 2020  Oh, and um, Antifa!
We could talk about how Biden would handle the pandemic better? His top aide is the guy who ran the pandemic response for Ebola, which was handled really well. That‚Äôs a pretty clear material benefit to humanity.
I'm trying to understand what your arbitrary rules for what can be used as evidence and what suppositions can be made fairly. Biden has sometimes followed through, sometimes not. He's never been in executive power besides the ceremonial vice-p, not exactly a 1:1 comparison.
I understand how corrupt and disingenuous the Democratic Party establishment can be, but Biden has a health plan as well which will be marginally better and isn't like Trump who has actively been trying to boot millions of people off insurance for 4 years with no replacement.
Ok so you want to argue based on your vague suppositions about what Biden might do in his presidency, but you don‚Äôt believe any actual policy positions he‚Äôs running on? So you‚Äôre just arguing from your feelings, and you‚Äôre an accelerationist like I said, just be honest about it.
Ok so your argument is that Trump is significantly better on foreign policy enough to matter on foreign policy enough to override all else? Biden has a better climate plan than Trump‚Äôs accelerationist rollbacks. I‚Äôm making logical arguments not emotional, I know they both suck.
#BeijingIntercourseJoe received $800K from the Penn Biden Center of the University of Pennsylvania after he was no long a VP. The Penn Biden Center received #CCP funding. Is Joe #Xitler's agent man running 4 President? If NOT, Joe should return $800Küá®üá≥$ to the Penn Biden Center.
Are you trying to say that Biden would drone strike people more than Trump? Trump *massively* increased drone strikes in his first 4 years over Obama. Obama did the Iran deal which was good, Biden wants to get us back into that. Some material benefit is always better than none.
I understand that all politics is local, but if this is real, it's disqualifying for me.  I'd still vote for Biden though.
Eating a fried turd is still better than eating a fried turd laced with cyanide if you‚Äôre at the point where you have to choose one. Both are shit but one has less of a chance to kill you. The only intellectually honest argument for not voting Biden is an accelerationist one.
Or perhaps the "Do Nothing Committee" it fits perfect since Biden did nothing to become the nominee and they are going to #DoNothing for working people.
Ignoring the fact that this reply is false as to be completely bonkers, $67k is peanuts compared to what Biden‚Äôs family has gotten during his political career.
Trying to talk to people is almost impossible. They have there "hot takes" that must be true and most these hot takes are used to dehumanize people. Its hysterical. People will here someone talk once and assume they know them perfectly then turn around and support biden.... lol
I'm doubtful that those suspicious lunatics are gonna vote for Biden regardless. Whatever VP Biden chooses, there will be some supposedly disqualifying, horrific thing about them that the GOP will promote and Fox News will sell like it's going out of style.

She has a point.  Will the Lincoln Project attack Pres. Biden for doing what he says he's going to do?  Restore environmental protections, raise taxes on the wealthy, expand health care, cut fossil fuel use, expand the safety net, etc?
Biden is pro baby murder. Nuff said
I do think that‚Äôs true in part. WHEN we elect Joe Biden as POTUS, we will have a sane President again who actually cares about ALL Americans including the ones who didn‚Äôt vote for him. That said: We have a rough road ahead to mop up 45‚Äôs &amp; his admin‚Äôs messes.
Trump's cosmopolitanism is good. Non-Trump cosmopolitanism is bad. Trump misspeaking is not misspeaking, it's him doing something cosmopolitan that little liberal minds don't understand. Biden misspeaking is a sign he's brain damaged. Come on man, keep up! It's just logic.
Most Americans don't have short term memory loss. America has the highest rate of unemployment since the Great Depression.

I was just doing a job near Salem Oregon where we live. 1 neighbor had a big Trump flag while the other had a Biden sign. Biden customer had Americana decorations in their yard so I coined a phrase Merricana vs Americana. Decorations mean something different depending your party.

Why are you retweeting Republicans for Biden?
CNN VP rips ‚Äòreally gross‚Äô attack on Joe Biden‚Äôs Catholic faith by right-wing website -
TRUMP CALLED JOE BIDEN "GODLESS"--BUT JESUS SAID,          "DO NOT JUDGE"!  Attending Church once in ten years  Trump said publicly that Biden is "Godless"! He is LYING AGAIN!.  Biden is a Devout Christian--a lifetime member of his church.  But LIARS WILL GO TO HELL, Jesus said.
Trump‚Äôs latest attack on Joe Biden is stunningly delusional ‚Äî even for him -
He is aware of the damage he will cost the good people of this nation. If he wants to get in the race to pull votes from Biden and award trump, he deserves ridicule and plenty of it.
Indeed! While VP Biden is outlining his many plans for helping America conquer COVID-19 and putting America back on track, 45 is using the same old tired game plan from 2016. Use VP Biden as the boogie man. Make up anything, no matter how outlandish. to land the vote. üëé
Live look in to Joe Biden's house where he's pacing around screaming "Grrrr, sometimes I just want to punch God so much, you know what I mean? Just like, bam, right in the kisser. I wake up and just can't stop thinking about it."
Really is terrifying to think about. I mean, the devil will transform into the super devil even. Whole world will never be the same if Biden is elected. The horror.

A debate will only help Biden. Everyone knows you‚Äôre a dumbass. They don‚Äôt need to watch you behind a microphone struggling to pronounce words and form sentences more than you already do.
Its possible. Personally I think its to late. Trump could demolish him on the debate stage and he'd still win. I think the hate people have for trump will trounce almost anything biden could do. We'll have to see though
Please note: 45 has not been telling us one thing that he intends to do in his next administration. His so-called campaign is all about making Biden the boogie man. Biden tells us every day what his plans are for his administration and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden.
Ok I may not like joe biden... but I definitely like him a little more after this. That is my literal dream car

I welcome investigating everyone who can be shady.  The fact biden isn't acting like a b*tch like trump is shows trump is hiding something.   I say who ever is guilty needs to be held accountable.  I can do that with my people I support.  Can you say the same?
Dude. Unless its actually found guilty he is innocent till proven guilty right ? You use that line with trump and his 27 accusers. So until then. Let their be investigations. But its funny you want biden looked in to but when others do it to trump you guys cry witch hunt!!

That's funny because you think that makes your friends look bad. But meanwhile you don't even realize Joe Biden never actually said any on that. üòÇ
Really, because he committed to the debate. But okay, if you say so.
'This shit is actual reality." It's a picture of Biden and a quote he didn't say! It's the same bullshit the left pulled when they said Trump wants everyone to inject bleach. More shit no one really said.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying Biden will win the election. I'm saying painting Biden with this baby food-eating old man brush will backfire at the first debate. Setting the bar so low means he only has to seem semi competent and it'll make people rethink his viability.
Considering we're both commenting on a funny quote by Biden that is 100% fake, then yes, I'm saying he's being painted. I'm not saying it's a thick coat of paint. I've seen the same gaffes you have. All I'm saying is exaggerating his senility will backfire come the 1st debate.
This strategy of painting Biden to be a dimentia-having drooling old man will backfire when he beats Trump in their first debate (because historically the incumbent always loses the first debate) and it makes Trump look that much worse that a senile old man bested him.

Trying to talk to people is almost impossible. They have there "hot takes" that must be true and most these hot takes are used to dehumanize people. Its hysterical. People will here someone talk once and assume they know them perfectly then turn around and support biden.... lol
I'm doubtful that those suspicious lunatics are gonna vote for Biden regardless. Whatever VP Biden chooses, there will be some supposedly disqualifying, horrific thing about them that the GOP will promote and Fox News will sell like it's going out of style.
Fliescher was the guy who was all ‚ÄúBiden is irresponsible for suggesting Trump wants to delay election‚Äù as well
Can we just lol  how  and his supporters just "wont accept" the results if Biden wins?ü§£ too bad so said mother %$*+%!
My current nightmare scenario is a Great Schism where blue states recognize a Biden Administration and red states recognize Trump Term Two
Biden should legalize weed = less bail.
I understand you but, we REALLY should have a freeze on rent.  just got a job last week after being out of one since all of this started. A freeze would be nice, instead of my sister and her child struggling to help me live. Biden is kind of insane but no other choice really
You, sir, owe VP Biden an apology in writing. Your spurious opinion piece of 4/24 was myopically intended to discredit the VP. He put forth a plausible scenario that‚Äôs come to fruition. I‚Äôm sure a man of your integrity(?) can do the right thing! Consider #VoteBlue
It‚Äôs the ‚ÄúBernie Bro‚Äôs‚Äù of 2016.  This entitled group of little whine asses will just take their ball and go home if they don‚Äôt get EXACTLY what they want.  Biden wasn‚Äôt my first choice, hell he wasn‚Äôt even my fourth choice but I can‚Äôt do four more years of this shit!
Senator Tammy Duckworth, Vet Pilot &amp; Iraq War Hero, rec'd a purple heart for horrible injuries. She is the first Thai American elected to Congress.  Duckworth--a wife, mother and fighter--is on Joe Biden's "short list" for V-P.    Washington Post 7/30/2020
You are just scared of not winning!! You will be defeated! Biden 2020!!
You all get he's signaling right? He's saying the right things so we'll believe Biden can be swayed by Obama and feel better about voting Joe. But he's secretly telling donors, of course that isnt happening. He then doesnt have to follow through because it was "Joe's" decision.

Hey Nick--if your vote for president is hinging on debates between Trump and Biden you've got bigger problems than voting for president bud

I love this. Also, those saying not voting isn‚Äôt an option and we have to get Biden in...do they not realize that Trump is rigging this as we speak? No way we get legit results. Gonna be worse than 2016
No one did shit when Breonna died.  This is hive mentality and the protests will not end unless Biden wins.
Yes,  she's my pick because once we are through  #trumpsCOVIDdisaster, we will need an economic &amp; financial wizard to crawl out of the depression.  However,  I will vote for Biden regardless of who he picks.
Confuse them a little. Say, "Yes. But not nearly as much as George Soros offered to pay me if I would support Joe Biden."
The fact that Biden promised a progressive woman VP then hired noted sex pest and corporate bank hack Chris Dodd to pick which woman is peak Biden candidacy.
Hasn‚Äôt Biden already said he‚Äôs aiming to be a one-term, transitional president? Don‚Äôt most VPs ... want to be President? This is so stupid.
Democrats are not Socialists, my dear, just as you are not truthful. Fair minded folks know Biden is not an extremist, but is a true Patriot.  The GOP no longer represents Conservatives, allowing Trump to spend the country blind and ignore the Pandemic.
Well, with Biden being at such an advanced age, being ready to be pres should be an important criteria.
After the food is done in 16 minutes it will rest and will do more postcards to voters.  TiK Toc.   Today the official thug secret police began a theoretical egress from Portland's BLM march .  Hopefully all will go well tonight.  Hug to all sane Biden supporters.
Once again you apparently can't hold complex views whatsoever. Even if Biden doesn't improve much healthcare-wise a public option better than Trump who has been trying to kick millions of people off health insurance completely with no replacement for his whole presidency.
Once again insulting. It should tell you that I would not take this decision lightly that I'm a survivor. Voting for Biden doesn't mean he's going to legalize rape or something. I view this choice for president as picking which enemy I want to fight for the next 4 years.
Oh so you only care about what *you* want? I'm a sexual assault survivor and advocated against Biden harder than anyone I know, still believe he's probably a rapist. Still going to vote for him, it's insulting that you would try to use that as a bludgeon against me.
I'm hesitant to believe that Joe Biden even uses "anarchists" with any intent outside of referring to people causing "chaos" at protests, none of these boomers have any idea what they're saying when they use that word
Allies would support Joe Biden‚Äôs choice for Vice President. Period.U.S. Intelligence: China Opposes Trump Reelection; Russia Works Against Biden
How about we refuse to recognize the continuing Trump regime and instead recognize Biden as the legitimate President and refuse to cooperate with the U.S. gov until Trump is removed from office, by U.S. military, if necessary?  How about we lobby foreign govs to do the same?
I've waited 8 hours for Biden to say something sane, so why not.
Is it true the Rethuglicans are encouraging your bit of nonsense here to fuck with Biden's chances?  You have to know your chances of being elected are so minuscule as to be less than 0 so you're either ego-driven like Donnie or nuts like Kim keeps saying...
Joe's arriving a bit late to the election reform party. Trump operatives can steal states where no recount is possible because of e-voting. Trump just might win easily. Biden can protest the results, but the MSM will probably just 'sour grapes' all over him. #CluelessJoe.
Actually he's ignoring and refusing almost everything we demand of him. :/ Joe Biden is straight down the middle, completely unbeholden to us radical leftists. His campaign is negotiating with progressives like Bernie Sanders and AOC, but the left is compromising more.

I saw a pic of Biden today and genuinely my brain didn‚Äôt recognize it as being him. I know he got a facelift but like,,,, why did that change his whole entire face in my head
Biden could believe God an Oreo and he‚Äôs have more faith than Trump.
I hope Biden‚Äôs team is noticing how much opposition to Kamala Harris there is..
Biden makes clear Trump wouldn't get any special favors to avoid criminal prosecution
Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible' and 'hurt God'
The only rationale for this mishandling of this campaign is that some polling office in quasi-DC assured the Biden people that EVERY registered democrat will show up to vote regardless of how pissed-on.  They may be right, but what a horrid lesson to learn from this moment.
Don't you staffers get tired of having to write tweets to make up for Biden's constant stupidity?
Reminder:   Elizabeth Warren is the reason Biden is open to ending the filibuster today.   She successfully pushed him left on this issue.
Joe Biden has definitely flipped his position on this issue. He was staunch against getting rid of the filibuster, now he‚Äôs open to it.   Another victory for Elizabeth Warren who helped popularize this idea during the Democratic primaries last year.
Trump keeps talking about crime increasing ‚Äî on his watch  The Trump campaign has even been running an ad showing images of recent urban unrest and claiming it as proof that "you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America."  #Election2020

Young voters - you might not be excited by Biden. I get it. But the other option is the party that thinks you are SO STUPID you‚Äôll vote for their distraction candidate Kanye West and feel like you made a difference. I know you‚Äôre smarter than that.
Biden won‚Äôt have any trouble with that. One shove and Donnie will be on his back like a turtle.
Biden will crush Trump in debates.
Because your mother told you that 2 wrongs don't make a right. You don't cancel racism with more racism. Besides, if Biden really believed his own words, he would have done something about it during his decades in government.
Nobody that would ever vote Democrat cares about Benghazi.   Kamala‚Äôs most memorable debate moment was when she called Joe Biden a racist. Her 2nd most memorable debate moment was when Tulsi Gabbard torched her record
‚ÄúIvanka‚Äôs $4 million haul tops the $1.7 million that Warren raised for Biden last Friday. But, in June, Warren brought in $6 million for Biden in his largest single-event to date.‚Äù  Ivanka‚Äôs $4m haul is larger than Kamala‚Äôs largest Biden fundraiserüòû
Instant coffee.üôÅI quit drinking "for the duration" when this mess started not realizing it was going to go on, and on. My birthday is coming up - here tell it's on the same day Biden is due to accept the nomination - and I plan to get righteously shitfaced.
If we are on the same team.. what do you want I hate Trump and everything he stands for and I fully support Biden so if you don‚Äôt support him you can leave anytime
Trump attacks Biden by saying he hates God. Trump dad was a KKK guy arrested at a pro KKK rally. The KKK hated catholics and Trump remarks are a hatred toward the catholic faith. Trump has expanded abortion like no other US President.
If Biden wins, the spring cleaning will have to be epic.
He sounds like a joe Biden with dementia,  wait
Noooo... Biden and Trump are propaganda puppets put in office to keep you from thinking about things like cancer clusters and who we gave 27 TRILLION dollars to.
So true! Biden is indeed a racist person. That is all he sees. Trump sees all of us as what our character is. Trump sees no skin color. #ColdWarRadio
Sorry to hear you will be sitting this one out. Hopefully you will reconsider if Biden's VP pick is someone you would like to see in the White House. Unfortunately progress is slow when it comes to equality and justice and while we could have done better than Joe he isn't bad.
Actually made me mad. The smirk on Biden's face and him almost flexing on you or something I didn't like that at all.
Yup. Biden will ruin this or ignore it.  um ur um where was I?
You all remember how Obama botched debate #2 in 2012, causing polls to flip, and Biden utterly obliterated Ryan soon after and singlehandedly flipped them back?
joe biden will win if he cosplays as SMT V protag
So can Biden hire, per say, Eminem to run for President to steal votes away from Trump? Asking for someone who isn‚Äôt orange.
Please do research on Biden you‚Äôd be surprised
then why wontthey run a liberal? biden literally called desegregation a racial jungle If thats not hard right, what is?
Biden is brainless now!! He should be the Poster Boy for Dementia!!!
Biden just said WHAT?!  via
As far as I know, Biden hasn‚Äôt grabbed any women by the pussy, isn‚Äôt hanging out with pedophiles, hasn‚Äôt called Latinos rapists or African Americans thugs, hasn‚Äôt fucked a porn star; can hold a bible correctly, drinks water with one hand, and is the better candidate for office.
Joe Biden is a racist.

Your show is so bad. Trump sucks. Live with it. Biden 2020!!!
Biden just made a gaffe. Yes it was. But nothing compared to raging racist Donald Trump. Biden has my vote.
Trump and cronies have a hidden agenda. He is a Vatican proxy and is struggling to keep the world distracted from me. They fear me and refuse to mention me directly, and instead use proxies like Obama, Biden, etc. to keep the nation duped and distracted.
I really don‚Äôt think so, joe Biden gonna go back into hiding and trump gonna keep talking and making it worse
Yes. We would all like Joe Biden better.
You ain't black if you vote for Joe Biden

I mean, Biden isn‚Äôt a gem either, but Trump has got to go, byeeeeee.
With respect, this sounds like 'I want to vote for Biden but if everything doesn't meet my specific preferences I'm willing to bail on the greater good'.
.   When you said departing the oval office I got all excited for a moment. I thought you finally figured out you'd save face by resigning instead of losing to Biden.
Taken out of context in the article which says ‚ÄúBiden attempted to explain that point by arguing that Latinos in Florida and Arizona had different views on immigration.‚Äù And that‚Äôs completely true. Same way East Coast and West Coast have turnpikes vs. freeways so shut up Trump.
People don't vote for VP. Seriously, they don't. If Biden's VP choice turns you off voting, you're not a serious person, no matter what your age.
rethinking my anti-Biden stance now
New polls show that Trump is narrowing the Gap with Biden. What in the hell is wrong with America that they would vote for that fool!
Let me guess, that help has to be for the Biden campaign, right?
Who let Joe Biden out of the basement and onto the airwaves unattended again?!

if Dems don't 'have the stomach' then Biden's will be a pyrrhic victory of horrendous proportions.
if Dems don't 'have the stomach' then Biden's will be a pyrrhic victory of horrendous proportions.
The 1st requirement for VP is a trust relationship w/ the President.  That doesn‚Äôt exist w/ her.  Her attack against Biden in the 1st debate proved that Harris is willing to attack other Dems. With her as VP, Biden would need someone to check his dinner for poison every evening.
Some people already know who they‚Äôre voting for and who they will NOT be voting for... and it‚Äôs not YOU. So we will get our Biden votes in early so you can start shitting your presidential pants early and make the next three months hell for you. That‚Äôs the LEAST we can do.
Maybe Mrs Obama _is_ pining for the Demos' nomination (as Mr Biden's 'issues' become too great for him to remain the candidate). Had always thought the idle spec about her and the presidency was just that.
I can't believe that someone is so stupid, but then again he said we should inject disinfectant into ourselves. He's trying to kill enough to make sure he wins in November, but if I have to walk 100 miles, I'm voting for Biden. #TrumpisaMurderer
Kamala Harris supporters:   ‚ÄúWe will attack Joe Biden‚Äôs character if he doesn‚Äôt make Kamala Harris his VP‚Äù

Historian who has accurately called every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump in 2020 race
You‚Äôre right. My premise a year ago was that Biden would choose Michelle but now as his mental accument is being challenged, she just may step ahead of him and with Barry‚Äôs endorsement she‚Äôll probably make it. But with the Obama‚Äôs Gaffes the past 10 1/2 years, their done.
Imagine if someone could harness the energy of Repugs shifting after the election from their laissez faire attitude toward Donald to their hyper critical demands of President Biden.  Wouldn‚Äôt that be awesome?
Lots of people are pretty pissed about the Super Tuesday Surprise, the Biden campaign‚Äôs refusal to countenance popular left policies (legalize weed, defund cops, M4A) and the party‚Äôs embrace of Republicans. There‚Äôs not as much daylight between Biden and Trump as there should be.
lol what‚Äôs Biden supposed to answer
Biden strikes me as a full-back kinda guy, who just calls him "my lad."  So I'm going with either a fullback dive or an angle route.

I'm Joe Biden and I forgot my message.
You can not ignore that biden has mental issues. You can not ignore that he grooms young women and pets them and sniffs hair. Dude is wierd. Trump is trying to help people by bringing hcq treatment to light. You are right, trump and biden are not on equal footing. Biden sucks.
If Biden actually debates, then Trump will win. No doubt. Y'all better figure out how to prevent that from happening.

Kamala Harris has not pushed Biden left on a single issue. None.
Nope, Biden pushed Harris to the right. Her actual position on busing was the exact same one Biden holds. That didn‚Äôt come out until people asked her straight up if she supports it or not
The reason people want Warren to be Biden‚Äôs VP is because she is the least likely to become a ‚ÄúYes‚Äù woman. She will shake the table and push Biden further left   Kamala Harris hasn‚Äôt pushed Biden on a single issue. None. Technically he pushed her towards the right on busing ü§°

How ever anyone interprets it, there is one paradigm that no one can successfully argue against. The program ideas of Bernie Sanders have a far better chance of getting implemented through Biden than Trump. I've worked my whole life for those ideals. I want more success b4 i go.
If playing a defensive posture means people are in the streets, I don't want that to end just because people feel vaguely better about who's in charge. I want it to continue until we actually win. I worry about false complacency under Biden. Obama ended the anti-war protests.

To the best of my knowledge, Biden is zero for 24 on the progressive policies that matter most. Most of these positions are supported by a majority of Americans overall and supermajorities of Democrats. I'm not asking for perfection, just SOMETHING.

Tell Joe Biden: Make Abortion Access for All* A Top Priority
Biden will get my vote when he fucking starts representing the interests of the people, who by something like 70% WANT. MEDICARE. FOR. ALL.  Biden is another god damned conservative with a D by his name. I'm so tired of this shit.
"Our Revolution" is too focused on electoral politics. Yes, get out the vote for Biden BUT Time for the protests to morph into a march of the unemployed for jobs, public works projects, green new deal, child care, elder care, and health care for all. Into the streets!

'The Democrats Freak Out Over Cartoon Joe Biden‚Äôs Lead' Ep. 202 Cold Ope...  via   oh no joe
Biden is our best last chance to restore America so don‚Äôt tell me why your voting for him or how long do you think it will take to restore America because it‚Äôs Biden its 4 years its a process that Trump has destroyed  So, be patient it‚Äôs going to be bumpy ride
Warren is the only person on Biden‚Äôs VP shortlist who has been able to bring in tens of thousands of people to his online events
The future of the Dems is Tulsi Gabbard. Biden should have picked her. #UnityCandidate #sarcasm #noIwasnotkidnappeditsajoke
would him endorsing biden mean anything? i think it might.
The Republicans will be radicalizing people to the right during Biden because most people will think Biden is left and that is something which Vaush misunderstands and all.
Uhhhhh. President Biden, actually.
Nice, but I think he should have to trade a couple packs of cigarettes before he gets to watch coverage of Biden &amp;  Harris as they receive the Nobel Prize for defeating his corrupt keister.
I‚Äôm confused on that viral Kamala/Biden moment. She‚Äôs pro bussing? üôÉ
Yes. Biden and Harris are pretty yikes but Trump is even more yikes.
Seeing the news about the NY police union endorsing Trump made me remember that the International Association of Fire Fighters has endorsed Biden.  Once again we get to see who is on the side of the community.
Joe Biden is embarrassing to even watch.
How dare you imply that we aren't doing enough by voting for Joe Biden. How dare you imply any existence of weakness within the democratic party. Jed Bartlet is turning in his grave, sir.
Democratic Socialists get off their asses and form a 3rd party? Surely you jest. You'll just snipe at Biden, Harris, Pelosi, etc. That vile social media behavior won Bernie 5 whole states in 2020. You're the kiss of death.
Joe Biden:  "wowee zowee, will you look at that! It's looneytunes!"  Elizabeth Warren: "I demand the Inspector General of the post office investigate DeJoy"  IG of the PO : "ok, I'm investigating"  One person here actually gets shit done. And sadly it's not our Pres nominee .
That‚Äôs my observation as well.  Though must I sadly report the first Biden sign in my neighborhood appeared in the last couple weeks.  There seems to (rightly) be zero enthusiasm for the guy. Seen several BLM and anti-Trump signs though.
So are you, why aren't you phonebanking for Biden right now? Every call you don't make for Biden is a call for Trump
I know, Hillary is offering to help in a Biden/Harris ticket, and I‚Äôm thinking that you can‚Äôt help if you are at Gitmo, can you?
Thought the great one was not drawing a salary? He can't keep his shit straight. Getting nervous and showing vulnerability. Biden-Harris team have him off balance. #TrumpHasNoPlan
Ok so we can agree via transcript he totally condemned white supremacists, check, we have the shithole countries comment from "sources", cool, and then we literally watch cities burn on tv for months but biden said "hey man, dont do that" (probably doesnt remember though).

‚ÄòS all good. It is hard to target messaging that much on what is by default a public platform, but I try to aim ‚Äúcriticize Biden to try to extract better talking points from him‚Äù at his supporters, and ‚ÄúTrump sucks, let‚Äôs get rid of him
Thank you, I think you‚Äôre very thoughtful as well. I‚Äôd like to be able to influence more non-voters toward voting for Biden / unseating Trump. I have to believe at least somewhat in what I‚Äôm saying though. I think Tlaib‚Äôs approach is a good one.
Biden‚Äôs digital team are some of the best in the business, I just cant comprehend ‚Äúhire comedians to write your emails‚Äù
If Clinton showed anything it‚Äôs that promising M4A doesn‚Äôt mean you have to actually do it; it costs almost nothing to merely point out the flaws in the health insurance system. That Biden won‚Äôt even pretend he‚Äôs interested in fixing health care during a pandemic is disappointing
It took audacity for Biden to choose Harris? ‚ÄúThe essence of audacity is having the bravery to do something that could offend others. Because of this, the word has both positive (bravery, bold) and negative (rude, impudent, disrespectful) connotations.‚Äù Go Joe! #BidenHarris2020
This is true. Which is why we have to take a hard stand. If Trump losing is more important to the Democrats than Biden winning then they can come over to our side. We tried supporting their side and it got us and them nowhere.
What will move me is Biden or his reps publicly acknowledging and apologizing for past mistakes, and communicating their new position on those issues. It‚Äôs worked well enough on Harris in the past.
Why would we expect Joe fucking Biden to roll back the clock on American fascism when he already had the goddamn opportunity with a more progressive partner than Kamala Harris.
P.s. I'm voting Down ticket  blue but am not likely voting for Biden. I don't have a dog in this fight.  But I know Soccer moms better than trump.
BTW My $5 bet says Suburbanite Soccer moms Break in the direction of Biden simply because they're concerned the  white house is xenophobic homophobic racist and a number of other forms of bigotry they'd rather not be taught to their kids.
And what did the white house do? Instead of disassembling it and putting the 90s government back together, they sent in Joe fucking Biden, who cut costs then called it a victory.
Then ask it of EVERY politician and start with Joe Biden.
It IS facing something new. I don't recall Joe Biden installing a crony corrupt postmaster general to slow down the USPS, cut overtime, sack the exec board, and scrap mail sorting machines. Each machine costs $1+ mil, so hardly a cost saving measure, ridiculous as that reason is.
The suburbanite housewife is more worried about the lessons the xenophobic clown in the white house is sending to her kids,  I know soccer moms better than trump does.  she's probably voting Biden. I don't have a problem with her. I'm actually shocked as a pretty left wing punk
The ENTIRE BIDEN FAMILY got filthy rich shamelessly using Joe's political connections. Americans are fed up.
‚ÄúThe ‚Äòsuburban housewife‚Äô will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge!‚Äù
Unfortunately, you‚Äôre right. There are people who can say something to sway me, but those people are Biden and Harris. I‚Äôll be watching the debates closely, plus any press release their campaign puts out. I honestly want an excuse to be bad at leftism and vote ‚Äúblue‚Äù again.
‚ÄúHer agenda might not sound sufficiently ambitious in Northern California but it could very easily play differently in Michigan and Wisconsin,‚Äù Schnur said, naming two swing states narrowly clinched by Trump in 2016 but that Biden now leads in the polls.
During her unsuccessful presidential campaign, Harris attacked Biden for failing to support an overhaul of the nation‚Äôs health care system, but he slammed her for attempting to ‚Äúhave it every which way.‚Äù With Biden at the top of the ticket, Harris will have to move from
Harris said she was proud to join Biden and blamed Trump for mismanaging the coronavirus and the economy.  ‚ÄúWe need a mandate that proves that the past few years do not represent who we are or who we aspire to be,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúJoe likes to say that character is on the ballot.
If you're not chomping at the bit to vote for Biden/Harris, I don't think there's much I can say to sway you. I understand the down-ballot arg, but it pales, in my mind, in the face of this fundamental threat. ymmv
On Wednesday, Biden formally introduced Harris as his running mate in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, praising her for going after the gun lobby and oil industry and saying he wanted her ‚Äúto be the last voice in the room‚Äù when he makes his toughest decisions.
Almost immediately after Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris as his pick for vice president, the Trump campaign and his acolytes began casting the California senator as a ‚Äúfar-left radical‚Äù set on transforming the U.S. into a socialist‚Äôs dream
Have we thought about how Joe Biden smells little girls because his own daughter died? Oh too far? I know lol we are all so sad.
So that gives Biden/Harris even less time than they already have to communicate a platform I‚Äôd be able to vote for. Yet another super gross and manipulative move by Trump and his goons.
worry less about biden and more about me I am the extremist and  I am prepared to vote my values for the first time.
as a Radical leftist I renounce Biden and Harris. #politics #political #Republicans
I have no problem being made into the Democrats Armor  in that  respect. Biden isn't one of us Radical leftist.

4th rate editing job.  Wasted a minute of my time and I'm not voting for Biden.
Congratulations, I'm so excited &amp; happy about your running as Vice President. I believe Joe Biden is one of the most honest people in Washington. Also, I believe that he is surrounding himself with capable, educated, &amp; honest individuals. All the Best, Deb Churchill
When I heard that masking comment from Biden, my first thought was...control over the people and here we go again.  Sick bastards.
Vote for Biden and talk to all of your reformed (almost) MAGA people. We must blow Trumpkut of the water in November. Live you
If you live in Washington state and vote for Biden, you're not participating in "harm reduction", you're just endorsing his right wing policies.
If true Biden wins in a walk, even with rigging. When non-Republicans and non-conservatives vote good things will flow.
Yes, we all have to vote for Biden this time around because we are held hostage. It doesn‚Äôt mean we have to be happy about it, or ignore that other things need to be done to fix it so we‚Äôre not held hostage next time. Don‚Äôt be so single minded you‚Äôre willing to ignore the future
Why won't Biden, or any Left Wing leader, denounce Antifa? One of these two movements is terrorizing residential neighborhoods in my city on a nightly basis.
I feel like I have no meaningful way to express my  real values in our political process...  It's not me throwing a fit because my guy didn't win it's realizing me and Biden are worlds apart. #politics #political  #democrat #democrats #liberal #liberals and just being unwilling
Great interview. I especially appreciate his answers to questions about how a Biden presidency will help Wisconsin.
We do. I just hope Biden won‚Äôt take us down ‚ÄòFord road‚Äô. We can‚Äôt afford that.
Don't talk to cops... Or our worthless lying mayor. Maybe stick around at a protest long enough to get gassed next time, and not just show up for the Instagram selfies. The only students that still like you at the end of the year are the proud boys &amp; Biden lovers.
I still have a hard time imagining the military would officially back a Trump coup, if only because he's been consistently personally shitty to them and Biden is a conventional warmonger. There are benefits to the status quo.  That doesn't mean the rank and file would follow tho.
If you're genuinely so terrified of trump blame yourselves for voting biden in.
I can't stand her based on all the seriously fk'd stuff she has done over the years in California but this meme made me have a good chuckle.  I guess my issues with her are similar to why I can't stand Biden due to all the crap he did while a Senator in the 1990s and early 2000s.

That‚Äôs why we need Biden and Harris.
Biden‚Äôs pick of Kamala Harris is the last nail in the coffin for his presidential aspirations. We cannot allow a blind lead the deaf in America which has finally risen to be the true super power of this world. This country needs you for four more years to finish the job.
Russians are creating fake ANTIFA web pages and linking them to Joe Biden 2020; Trump is openly trying to suppress voting; 1 out of 4 tests in Texas are positive thanks to GOP leadership; on and on‚Äîand this is on you GOPranos. You are enemies of democracy.

National organized labor works for the DNC. You think Perez/Biden/Pelosi want a general strike? No, they don‚Äôt. It has to come from the bottom up. Pick a walk-out date and spread that shit like wildfire and we‚Äôll see what happens. Waiting for leaders is what losers do.
Bill Clinton didn‚Äôt really deliver on that, but he promised to try. Biden promises *not* to try. It‚Äôs frankly ridiculous that people keep trying to paint Biden as an FDR-like progressive when only Sanders‚Äô platform was even close.
Yes, progressives are well aware of the back to brunch crowd, and that's one of the biggest dangers of a Biden presidency, people who hear Democrats say shit like this and don't push back.
Biden should base his campaign around being a wife guy
If China hacks Trump and sends advance notification of when the releases will be so that Biden can plan his strategy around them and he doesn't tell the DOJ so they can investigate the cyber-attack, then yes, that would be corrupt of Biden.
I said some very similar things when I took an Instagram survey for Biden. Hopefully this sort of thing gets the message through to them, that they fucked up if they wanted the progressive vote.
?  Biden would have won comfortably.

Joe Biden is racist and picked his vp running mate solely on her race. Again, he is showing the world he is racist.
This is an election of apathy. People are voting for Biden, because they have to, with little to no enthusiasm. This will not fare well with undecided voters. I'm walking away from Democrats this time. I haven't decided to vote for Trump. But, I won't vote for Biden.
society as we know it, you just get a possible chance to avert that eventuality in 4 years, instead of 12 with Trump rather than Biden / Harris.
So happy 4  right now - can‚Äôt wait for  to fire up this fall ‚ÄúJoe Biden had the audacity to choose a black woman to be his running mate - and ya know who that black woman is - itttt‚Äôs meeeeee‚Äù that was a Kamala open w/ an Oprah slide at the end.
Reason enough to vote for Biden/Harris. We have such a short time for action on climate change before passing the point of no return.
Count me as one who will settle for Biden.
I don‚Äôt think you need to shame them as much as explain that as flawed as Biden is, a vote for him is a vote against our actually fascist current president. (And everything Ian said.)

Just like those pics conservatives are passing around with Biden consoling his grandkids at their father's funeral, and saying he's a predator?
That is why he picked  .  They are a perfect fit &amp; compliment each other.  BTW you are right behind Biden in age.  Look what you have done to our country.
We need a government that not only "listens to", but actually ACTS on science. We cannot afford to NOT have the #GreenNewDeal  Wake up Biden!
Very true, though which candidate will lead to more profitable profits is  something they very much consider.  I would expect Biden makes a good case for long game- definitely more stable than Great Orange Leader.  Stability is attractive to the insurance industry, generally.
What were you planning to do if Biden won?
Send her to Shady Oaks man ... the woman is done ... all these old Dems are senile as all get out ... Schumer, Pelosi, Biden - and Schiff is just an idiot - they all think we‚Äôre stupid.  Vote for them at your own risk !
How do you know?  Obama didn‚Äôt immediately end the war in Iraq and never closed Guantanamo Bay. Why will Biden be different after Trump?
So you got to keep more of your money and you‚Äôre whining about it?  Biden said he‚Äôs eliminating the Trump cuts and will raise taxes.
The left is going to be blamed regardless if Biden loses, just accept that now, that's what is going to happen, no amount of comity or ass kissing is going to change that.  There is however a lot of leverage in saying we could have won if these voters wanted to vote for us.
Than there is in rubber stamping a right wing Biden administration.   You're just both saying a lot of demonstrably untrue fabricated bullshit that is easily debunked with some cursory research.
Let‚Äôs compare your intellect to Biden‚Äôs. First u had someone take your SAT‚Äôs, then u can barely read, often your lights are on but nobody‚Äôs home. Top psychiatrists collectively say you are a danger to yourself &amp; others. You just had a cognitive test, so do u know what this is?
Not everything that's corrupt is criminal. If Biden had done what he's accused of re: Hunter &amp; Burisma (he didn't, but still) it wouldn't have been a crime. Removing a corrupt prosecutor was in America / the West's interests.

CNN should mention that time in 2010 when Joe Biden spoke at a Klansman‚Äôs funeral and called him a mentor and friend.
your "a new poll reinforces" is incorrect, I think- shouldn't Trump's be worse, not better? "Biden is viewed more positively than Clinton was, and Trump is viewed more positively than he was"
From the conclusion of your article.  "But Biden‚Äôs comments over time make clear that he has at least been willing to keep cuts to Social Security and Medicare as negotiating chips"
There is video of Biden proposing cuts to social security on the floor of the senate, for fucks sake.  You Blue MAGA people are just as bad as Trump, all fake news all the time, when it looks bad for your favs.  Just utterly useless Americans.
Kamala is much worse than Hillary in every aspect which is why the Biden campaign is looking like a big dummy.
I do not disagree&amp; I am super disillusioned about Biden. This Will be the 1st time I will throw up in my mouth a little bit when I vote. I had no particular opinion until after 2016 cuz I wasn't political. I'm mainly voted democratic &amp;pretty much Didn't pay attention Past that. 1
It's disgusting how Biden shamelessly used his political connections to make himself and his entire family filthy rich.
I‚Äôm thinking if Biden is elected COVID-19 will just go away . Everyone will be happy üòÉ back to normal ?
As I said, I would be just fine with Trump hiring someone to speak with Ukrainians who had stories about hypothetical Biden corruption, sure.  The problem is that in this case, the "corruption" is being completely invented from whole cloth.
I didn't read that story before linking it, but if you are asserting that Obama did not try to cut social security, or that Biden has not tried to cut social security, you are lying.  Full stop.
Primary elections were held with in-person voting during a pandemic. Biden was given free corporate media coverage. Other candidates dropped out to endorse Biden just as other options had a chance. The voters did not choose Biden.
Nor will it change under Biden.
?  Trump literally can't run for two more terms, this is basic constitutional law.  And there will be no primary in 2024 if Biden wins, people pretending otherwise are lying to themselves.
Are you fact checking Biden also?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Sanders is one of the few decent people in politics, Biden and Harris certainly aren't.
If Joe Biden had corrupt business deals in Ukraine, I would be OK with Trump paying people to go talk to his business partners to learn about them, yes.   How do you not see the difference between a hostile gov't funded endeavor and private citizens?
I like Beto but come on dude! He shouldn't have endorsed Biden pre Super Tuesday, we knew they wouldn't help TX.
trump has been a hundred times more disrespectful to Biden than Harris could ever dream of being. Her calling Biden on bussing made perfect sense and I think showed him how tough and unafraid she is, which impressed him because he, unlike trump, respects women.
I will believe Biden has moved left when there is policy passed, and not a moment before.   And Favs knows that too, he just doesn't have a high opinion of his listeners intelligence.
They know since Biden‚Äôs the D ticket, their boats gonna float fine no matter who wins. Nothing special in it for any investment of time or $$
I think Vaush is realizing he is on the wrong side of the history here and is double downing on his points that Biden is the best way forward when he is obviously not.

I get exactly what I deserve when I‚Äôm forced to watch Biden ads whilst viewing fishing videos on YouTube
I feel like I'm banging my head against a wall. I've been making this same argument all month now but I always get the same "But Biden isn't great!". Never an answer about how letting Trump win will make things easier. They just ignore it. I hate to call people Russian bots but..
None of this is fair.  1. The interview question implies that Harris didn't like Biden. Which isn't at all what she said at the time.  2. Now she's accused of lying and not taking politics seriously. Which is obviously wrong.  "You could have done better" is critique. Not hatred.
We definitely don't have enough time for the long game of electing Biden and Harris to run the party for the next 12 years that people in this thread are advocating for.
My Mom is a Biden supporter. Myself, I aligned more with Warren/Sanders.  Whenever we talked about the election during the Primary, we knew we were voting for WHOEVER ended up running against Trump.  It's Biden and I'm voting for Biden/Harris.   It's that simple. #NeverTrump
Both didn't win the primary. Biden got in there via coup and Harris was roundly rejected.  It's amazing, how 45% of the DEM electorate doesn't appear to matter at all and sabotaging our democratic process is just fine when convenient.
Biden/Harris platform. Needs more student loan forgiveness for public servants, but also for everyone, especially first generation scholars.
And why did Biden say to wear masks for next 3 months? Don‚Äôt need to wear masks after Nov 3rd??? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Good for you.  The 25% Biden difference is unaffected as my parents are Republicans voting for Biden.

You do realize identity theft is profitable and that voter fraud is not, don't you?  What's more likely, the people buying these IDs are running up debts .... or they are trying to vote twice because they're REALLY BIG Biden supporters?

Pence can't pardon trump for crimes not already been indicted for and hasn't been tried for , there's a big list and it will stick .  Pence won't be anything in January , Biden will be president .
I‚Äôm starting to think ‚ÄòBernie or Bust‚Äô is just as ridiculous of a position as ‚ÄòRidin‚Äô with Biden‚Äô. Instead of placing all your hopes on one politician, you *could* examine our political system as a whole and realize it doesn‚Äôt matter who you vote for.  The electoral process..
Biden is a glass of milk. Not your first choice, but not too bad.  Trump is a glass of sewer water, bugs, and coronavirus.   The choice is YOURS.  #Biden2020 #DumpTrump
Citizens United isn‚Äôt abstract. It is concrete. Conservative Justices sided with the argument that limitless money in campaigns is free speech. Democrats want to legislate campaign finance reform &amp; Republican senate is blocking it. Want change? Vote for Biden
I will vote to elect you and Biden , and if trump became president and I lose my social security , I will fight him .
Imagine calling yourself a leftist while you bend yourself into a pretzel for Joe Biden of all people
Biden was hiding from voters well before the start of Covid.  They can only Weekend at Bernies him so many hours a day.

Biden helped write the legislation that primarily caused this system to be as fucked up as it is. I honestly don't think he would be any better or worse than Trump. If we actually want change we have to work outside of this two party corruption feedback loop
I have theory, Kamala Harris was told to drop out early to keep her from sustaining any more collateral damage during the debates,they had her as the VP pick at that point,then got Bernie out, Biden would be easy to remove giving Kamala the Presidency at some point

The new Biden/Harris campaign ad shows Joe down on one knee. Apparently Commie'la is a great teacher. Joe looks ready to perform orally.
If Biden gets the vote of postal workers, that‚Äôs gonna be clutch.
Cool , we can put you in prison for tampering with the mailing system to help you win the election ,   Don't worry , we will vote for Biden and we'll drag your ass out kicking and screaming if you don't go willingly .  Have fun in prison punk .
Biden is up 25%
At 77, Biden still rides a bicycle for exercise &amp; keeps his weight down There's no dementia there but Trump is morbidly obese &amp; can barely walk his fat behind down a ramp &amp; can't put together a coherent sentence so guess where the dementia is.
If Biden tries to come for Portland's needle exchanges ill slingshot a rig full of HIV blood into his face Muntadhar al-Zaidi style
"regardless of whether or not you personally have been extorted into supporting Biden"
Twitter is an open forum, you post things, people get to reply.   Attacking people who are clearly vastly morally superior to the Democratic party, regardless of whether or not you personally have been extorted into supporting Biden is bad form, and bad for the Overton Window.
THE ONLY TIME I will let someone vaccinate me is when I see an F.D.A. approval on the vaccine &amp; when Joe Biden is in office. FULL STOP!
Still behind in my mind.  Biden will be behind until January when he takes the oath as far as I'm concerned.
the VERY Drug warriors I've been railing against for YEARS. and now I'm just supposed to I don't know abandon everything I've ever written about and vote Biden. I stand by it all. Ergo. Howie.
Wow, you mean they‚Äôre real people? Flawed and capable of short comings? Good lord what‚Äôs the world coming to? Fascinating read. And really stoked confidence in a potential Biden administration frankly. But ya, the Obama/Biden memes weren‚Äôt real life, oh well.
It's disgusting how Biden and his entire family got filthy rich by shamelessly using his political connections.
I am learning to speak Chinese at the Hunter Biden School of Executive Mandarin.
NBA says photographer who posted offensive Kamala Harris meme is no longer in bubble. IMO the NBA did the right thing.
Joe Biden Accused Of "Enforcing Sharia Law"  Watch:    #NotMeUs
Please give us one issue on which Biden has been our ally and not a major roadblock.
..as though the only defining characteristic of blackness is how ‚ÄúPOCs‚Äù are treated by the police. I personally have no issue in voting for Biden/Harris because I understand politics. What I do have issues with is the erasure of blackness as a defined people with a defined cause.
You can't be in America you must mean duh trump that is destroying America and great minds like biden's are not talkers they do things for our country trump only destroys so he can win plus he cheats and lies on all things
Maybe not, particularly with Biden/Harris. But Dems usually benefit from higher voter turnout (why GOP works so hard to supress votes) and who knows how many of those people were victims of The New Jim Crow
All the more reason to vote for Biden/Harris.
The thing I‚Äôm most looking forward to about the Biden Harris presidency is not being outraged constantly
But y'all were so ready to called #Harris a non-Black radical leftist fascist cop, and #Biden a sleepwalking dementia addled dithering r****t.
My wife just got notified her "good" employee sponsored insurance plan is leaving her with a $1024 bill for going to the emergency room for, long story, but basically a 2 minute visit.  F*ck Mainstream Media, F*ck Biden, F*ck Kamala, F*ck Trump &amp; F*ck the DNC
Not a peep from leftists and our mailboxes being taken out; but plenty of sh*t to say about Biden and Harris.
Trump's answer to that question is hell no he doesn't regret lying or cheating on his wife his taxes the election or Americans he's such a scumbag  can't wait till Biden and Harris win this election trump trust cheating always that's what crimminals do
Biden will drop out before or shortly after the midterms in 2022 and there will be no primary in 2024.  The Democratic party does not support primaries of incumbent Presidents, and even if there were, the last two elections should show you how hard taking down Harris will be.
Yes, this is more of the pre-explanation for Biden's defeat.
It's for these reasons That I can't bear to continue down this road and continue to vote against my own values. Biden doesn't speak for me and when I told him don't put her up he didn't even reply.
Oh, and the Biden campaign was lying about CDC recommendations until early April, it would be great if we had a candidate that actually gave a shit about science, but we don't.
We got PLAYED! Joe Biden policies are that of the same as Trump! #VoteThemOut!
Biden's "plans" are sheepherding bullshit and worth less than the electrons used to transmit them.  He probably can't even speak extemporaneously about them.
that moment in history.   We likely get someone like AOC in 2024 with Trump still in office, with a Biden Harris win we know we are getting Harris in 2024, and in 2028 assuming she wins 2024.
Also, read that article, Biden isn't in fact promising to go back to that approach, that was sarcasm, he is saying he won't get rid of the sanctions that violated our side of the terms in the Iranian deal, ie: he plans to continue Trump era foreign policy towards Iran.
I don‚Äôt think Amy threw her support behind Biden picking a WOC for pats on the head.
Joe Biden also sucks shit,so no
This isn't wrong. It's probably the biggest reason that Joe Biden is going to lose in November. Health insurance is a completely useless system. #MedicareForAll is a sensible compromise.  Biden supports making insurance execs richer with bigger ACA subsidies. How will that help?
If Biden gets elected quarantine is legally over for 48 hours. Catch me in a sleeping bag at Bar Bar
i'm sure you've been ratio'd on this but you mean the cages biden and obama built and the scotus that biden personally enabled while humiliating anita hill?  you all let the left go in 2016 as well.
Trump is looking for any excuse not to debate Biden, so....... perhaps not the best negotiating device. Trump knows how poorly he'll do; how stupid he comes across (cuz he IS).
Good thing Biden is going back to that approach to Iran.
He's vote shaming people for not supporting Biden now, isn't he? I know Cusack bullies anti-Russiagaters.
Stamp of approval:
I‚Äôll take this another step: Leftists shouldn‚Äôt see Biden‚Äôs victory as a ‚Äògood thing‚Äô for our movement.  He and Trump both have already wrought havoc on society, oppressing and attacking anyone who refuses to bend to the will of the State.  At this point, electoralism is dead..
Idk who need to hear this bu Biden isn't going to follow through on his climate change plan.. Joe Biden is the same candidate that promised to cure cancer if he was elected but said Sander's (not so radical) plan to address climate change wouldn't ever work.
And we already know that Biden supports regime change in Venezuela, a goal of the oil industry and the oil industry alone, and that he has no intentions of doing anything about fracking.
"that‚Äôs a whole lot of accelerated global warming tracing right back to America‚Äôs front door."  Now there's perhaps a debate to be had about whether or not this was intentional, and purely on the optics Biden and Obama were and are superior.  But all that really matters is tons
Don't mess with our USPS!!! Vote BIDEN/HARRIS... &lt;3 Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake  via
Obama, Biden, and HRC, literally sold the world fracking technology.
Nah. Biden for me.

Usually I want October to go by as slowly as possible to savor every moment of the most wonderful time of the year, but now November simply cannot come soon enough.  Can't wait to cast my vote for Biden/Harris!
I don't know how much more clear it can be that everyone needs to vote FOR Biden-Harris, *and* get ready to mobilize in any way possible to get this guy out of office. He is incredibly dangerous.
Trump is objectively awful on the environment, no argument from me, but so is Biden, so again the only relevant question is when do you get to do something about it.  4 years is 4 years less than 8 and 8 years less than 12.
Trump still hasn't done as much damage to the environment as Obama and Biden did, mostly because Trump can't do the things they already did, like turning the US into the largest oil producer on the planet.
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ON THIS LIST WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION! Is your head up your ass for the warmth?? "Nothing will fundamentally change" they are the fucking same. Just screwing the worker and making the rich richer. God liberals are the worst
Of course it does and this is yet another item to repair once we flip the Senate as well as elect Biden.  If we're don't flip the Senate it'll be trouble.  So many wrongs and things to codify in laws.
Almost optimistic compared to my theory, they felt no responsibility to participate in the democratic process at all, and many who did voted Biden because it's the name they'd heard before. üòê
Looks like Joe Biden is sniffing her. Can't wait for the convention.
But they say electing Biden would turn the US into a banana republic.   EVERY ACCUSATION IS AN ADMISSION WITH THESE BUFFOONS
Neither presidency is going to address climate change, which means the only relevant question for our young people's future is when do you get the next earliest chance to address climate change, with Trump it's 4 years, with Biden and Harris it's probably more than 12.
"WE ARE NOT GONNA LET JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS BEAT...OUR....MEAT!!!" (from stage right) "Sir! reduce! reee-duuuuce our meat!"
I sincerely love to see people online be like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt love Biden/Harris either but I‚Äôm voting strategically!‚Äù and the strategy is to capitulate with no demands, leverage, or resolve. 4D chess; very inspiring
you were a Yang supporter...he was not a socialist, that is more like Biden/Harris...confusing to me...You really aren't sure what you want or believe..but the BS talking points are so hollow. You had this country, move..why not be more happy instead of so bitter?
It's sooooo touching that Trump cares so much about how Joe Biden is treated well or not.
What are the plans for the future of the GOP? The POTUS can‚Äôt even answer that from his favorite newscast. What a TOTAL LET DOWN! Biden/Harris for 20/20! Save our democracy!
Not implying obviously that Harris is an ‚Äúevil‚Äù at all, but the article also ignores that Biden has been the presumptive nominee for a while and progressives have had time to adjust. Few seriously believed Biden would choose someone from the far left.
I'm curious how man missed social security checks will swing a senior from trump to biden
Get used to fighting. We will never not need to.  Trump wins? We'll have to fight every day. Trump loses? We'll have to fight every day. Forces have been coalescing to derail a Biden term.  We are never going back to the normal that some people still think we are operating in.
I'm pretty sure at least 633,108 people will vote for Biden and Harris this November.  #USPS
‚ÄúWe can hold them accountable‚Äù is what the dems say. What this actually translates to is ‚Äúshut the fuck up, vote for our guy‚Äù as Biden said at the outset of this campaign: ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù
Biden and Kamala: King and Queen of Mass incarceration.
You blocked Obama from putting oversight in at the post office for political reasons, after helping russia to help trump get electioned. Your brainwashed followers still believe lies about Democrats, Hillary, Biden, and Kamala and you have never denounced those lies
No. It takes an immense amount of cognitive dissonance to look at Trump then look at Biden and be like ‚Äúeh theyre pretty much the same‚Äù
We need to get back to being the party of the new deal and STOP CRIMINALIZING POVERTY amongst other things. OH and if you are a Woman shocked and horrified that this Feminist activist won't support Biden well just keep in mind that Clintons Welfare reform destroyed the very
realize that without those who voted for him in 2016, who have admitted their mistakes and who will now vote with us for Biden are worthy of our forgiveness and our appreciation for admitting the mistake and wanting to rectify it we may not win this one. It‚Äôs also time for us to
So there's a chance we'll have two presidents back-to-back inspired at least in part by spite to show they can do better than Obama did?  Cool cool cool cool cool...
Vote Biden.  You won‚Äôt be as sorry as I hope you are now for voting for Trump.
if you're campaigning for the hearts and minds of older people who essentially think the republican parties ideas and agendas are just swell and they're morally upstanding then you'd use the Tactics Biden's using. But I'd rather lose than go with that shit.
Ironically, I support your POV at the federal level where I will hold my nose and vote for Biden. In PDX the mayor is merely a vote so yeah I‚Äôll assume the posture of the loyal opposition. Vigor.
If everyone votes blue and the Biden loses, the DNC can only think to go after GOP voters. That mean even more right leaning "left" candidates. THAT'S BAD CHANGE.   You only shift the overton window by pulling from the left.
I will definitely get vaccinated, but not with some Trumpian fly-by-night debacle. If they have one developed after Biden has been inaugurated...
Tuliscrats &amp; YangGang = Howlers DNC and GOP = The Society's Gold Houses Trump, Pence, Biden, Harris = Pixies
If Biden loses and the DNC see it as a failure to listen to the people who voted third party and next time they cater to them? THATS GOOD CHANGE. If enough vote third and the GOP &amp; DNC  lose power? THATS GOOD CHANGE.
Why would they support Joe Biden?
wait till you find out Biden was vp for 8 years and still let shit like joe arpaio's tent camp exist. don't worry about the ICE centers tho: you might get so angry you start calling for for the Kristallnacht
There is something that is very irritating about Kamala Harris. I don't think she will help Biden at all.
PENCE: The selection of California liberal Senator Kamala Harris as Joe Biden&amp;#039;s running mate simply confirms everything President Trump and I have been saying about Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.
There's Nothing more Pathetic than your Comment! Lemme guess, Voting for Biden is the way to go? Sorry, I want my rights left alone thank you
Third, Green and Bernie votes aren't siphoned Biden votes or anything. They're people who value different things and aren't being catered to by Biden or Trump. They aren't jerks, they're a statistic of how much your candidate failed.
This is wrong on so many levels. First, your vote doesn't matter in the way you think due to the electoral college. Second, Oregon is gonna be Biden, it doesn't matter how many more Biden votes there are than Trump ones, just that there are more.
First off, own what you did, and you have. Realize your choice is Trump or not trump rather than trump vs biden.
People aren't organizing a General Strike to help Biden, they're organizing one as an indictment of the entire system, letting the Democratic party co opt this idea is a terrible idea.

More spicy hot takes cuz I've seen this all over a lot of people I know's various profiles.   If someone doesn't vote for Biden, they aren't voting for Trump (well besides the ones that explicitly voted Trump but that's besides the point). Stop guilting people for it.
As evil as this bitch and Biden white ass is imma still vote for them smfh
Didn‚Äôt vote for Biden not supporting Biden! Period!
How many times.. That's Harris - Biden. Honestly, you might get people confused.
What isn't it. I agree with Cornel that she can't be trusted &amp; we have to be honest about her &amp; Biden even if they get our vote
Again, I don't think they're perfect, I'm not even a registered Green, I do think there is a lot more value in showing there is a block of voters that reject Blue No Matter Who than running up Biden's popular vote score for no reason.  If you get them to 5% they get federal
Biden please. I did the same thing
Reporters trying to get clickbait, goading on all things Biden said. WHPC is a joke.
LOL, you're tweet was just immediately retweeted by a settle for Biden account.
F.... Joe Biden,  he can wear a mask, but I'm NOT changing religions.
Why is he still attacking Bernie now that Biden is the nominee and Bernie has endorsed him? Is he trying to help Trump win?
Joe Biden in a nutshell
Not me! I was with Kamala from the start and when she dropped out I went to Biden. Seeing these two atop the ticket has had me celebrating and spending swag money like crazy! #BidenHarris2020
Most ballot access:   Environment:   Justice:   Protest Vote (Write ins):      I can't vote for people to lie to my face (This is a post in reply to Biden "defending" SS)
K Harris was not Born in the USA, according to what i learned in school she can not become President if Biden dies or becomes more senile, then the Speaker of the House becomes president
She denied hundreds of early releases to low level drug offenders because it would take away cheap (slavery) labor from California prisons‚Äîin fact, when Biden declared her VP, stocks in prisons went up!
I'm progressive. Biden and Harris are closet republicans.
I would take position in Joe Biden's White House. Most the time anyone would.Trump the only one i know that never filled his cabinet.Or had to put out ads to fill it.
This plus an earlier NYT article indicate Obama and team failed to really see who Biden is and his strengths, focused too much on superficial faults.  Leading of course to the world-historical disaster of picking HRC as 2016 nominee.
But just to be on the same page... Not voting for Trump, should not mean voting for Biden.  Right?  #NeverBiden #NeverTrump   #VoteJo
The other day  was going to the Biden campaign and vis versa!
But like my dad says, you can't put the shit back in the goose. I'm way too lazy to go through an unfollow them all. So if you could kindly just block me, I only care about anarchist and other far-left content, I'd rather eat shit than vote Biden.  That's all
Listen. If you're a dem or a blue wave or k hive or Biden lover, unfollow me. If I followed you first, honestly a couple years ago I took a bunch of adderal, set up this Twitter, and followed like a thousand democrat and environmentalist accounts. I regret every bit of it,
Video's and recordings to release under my sworn oath to the people of Oregon.  Will Biden or Trump save my family from corruption?  Hell no there not. Why not you both talk about our laws and freedom? Right! Here is a whistleblower &amp; witness with video and 20 full tapes of this
I agree. Expecting Joe Biden to suddenly surrender to the protesters or strikers is... na√Øve.
When did Biden say that? Do you have a link?
I'm a truck driver, white male. And I'm Biden all the way
so when she called out Biden on his segregationist past and retracted it as a JK moment that was change too right? i know it was an eternity ago (june) so records might be spotty.
Not ALL who voted for trump in 2016 are members of his cult. The cult loves him because he hates who they hate (people of color, liberals, strong women...). There is his cult and then there are people who were conned who we need to embrace because they will vote for Biden/Harris.
Cakes vote for Biden üéÇ Pies vote for Trump ü•ß
A Shapiroesque surrogate comes in and says ‚Äúlook at all the outspoken radical leftists voting for Biden though, doesn‚Äôt that prove he‚Äôs a commie?‚Äù.  Maybe the vote can be printed out with the following diagram:
I wish #Biden would have chose #StaceyAbrams instead. She's 10000% better than Kamala who is a cop #ACAB who put 1500 people in prison on petty cannabis charges. I'm only voting for #BidenHarris2020 because anything is better than trump. I would love to vote for Stacey!
Here is the text from this mornings campaign email:  "Kamala Harris is the meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful, MOST LIBERAL of anyone in the U.S. Senate, and I cannot believe that Joe Biden would pick her as his running mate."
That‚Äôs why, even with pandemic unemployment etc, I‚Äôm still worried about Biden/Harris. They‚Äôre selling ‚Äúreturn to normal‚Äù but has that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù been lost forever? It‚Äôs like trying to set a wet log on fire.
The way I see it is that Biden is causing less emissions than Trump and that Biden has the strength to keep pushing.
Rose emojis for Biden
In this house, we are whites with college degrees, Biden 100%
Biden has supported tough-on-crime policies for his entire political career. As a prosecutor, Harris enforced them.
It‚Äôs ok to hate him, and still vote for him. It‚Äôs people who vote for Biden out of spite that puzzle me.
Driving around Oregon you don't see much, if any Biden stuff. Plenty of Bernie, Hillary and Obama things still around though. I saw a UN flag in front of the house the other day and just shook my head in disbelief.
‚ÄúHi, i‚Äôm white. My life under Bernie, Biden, Trump, Mccain, Obama, Ben Carson and that cowboy guy that tried to run would be the same. But i refuse to vote for Biden because my principles tho. Kids in cages thats fine.‚Äù (There are bipocs that buy into the narrative too)
So the millions that lost their homes under Obama and Biden got chicken?   Blue checkmarks have lost the script.
Are you a doctor? Biden was VP,His job was to work with Obama. It was Obama not Biden call. Obama follow the doctor advice,Trump did not. Not all sickness are the same.This one getting worse as it evolves. It spread faster and not has hard to get now. It has gotten more deadly.
Respect your point but I'm not a fan of "earn my vote" logic because: There is no version of biden/Harris that would not be infinitely better than trump. We need him out and they are the ONLY current solution to that problem.
Right! Every minute you don't spend phone banking for Biden, you're phone banking for Trump!
I think a Biden admin would be fundamentally better for DEMOCRACY, for global alliances, for everyone. If you are having trouble reading tea leaves, read ON TYRANNY by Tim Snyder. 128 pgs that lays bare the direction which re-election would take us.
If Biden wins, you can kiss it all goodbye. I'm not expecting much, anyway. üôÑ
Nine out of 10 Democrats support Kamala. The Biden campaign raised $48 million in two days since her announcement. People are ready to win. Twitter is a bubble. Get real.
Feeling despair. Even though Trump is slowing down the mail to interfere, can Biden still win this election?
Me tooüòú
Help keep Social Security and make it stronger Mr Biden!
Help Social Security Mr Biden!
And after SC, Biden was never on the ropes against Sanders or Warren, etc.
In 2012, Dems could argue that Romney had shifted positions and become more ‚Äúseverely conservative‚Äù to win primary. But Biden never really catered to the left.
Oh, thanks.  Last week it was "Well, not voting for Biden is voting for Trump, but you do you, hun."  I just block them all no matter what their current voter suppression phrase is.
This is incredible! It sums up what makes her so bad. Either she didn‚Äôt mean what she said about Biden. Or she is working with someone who opposed her basic right to an education. either way, she won‚Äôt address the question.
Ill contribute the whole $3,400 to Biden/ Harris... thanks Mr Prez!
Too many people are just voting for "not Trump"   Biden could say he's pro holocaust and a vast majority of his supporters would support him over Trump
Clarify for me: So you won‚Äôt demonize a fellow catholic. But will happily demonize Joe Biden and all the democrats for being pro-choice?  Is that correct?
classic toxic cis white male exceptionalism.  folks, you really do hate to see it.  only way to offset this is by voting for **checks notes** joseph robinette biden jr this november
Here's the scenario... community with 250,000 voters. Score is tied. Trump has 100K, Biden has 100K. 50K have decided to stay home or vote 3rd party. Those 50K would never vote for Trump, but if they would/could find their way to vote for Biden? Game over.
They can‚Äôt arrest him, they don‚Äôt have anything. The person who needs to be arrested is Biden‚Äòs opponent
Then why the hell did you actively try to defund it for 40 years?  Liar. #NeverBiden #NeverTrump
Hear me out... This Presidential race could be like season one of the Politician where both candidates are forced to nominate the best VPs to win (which was basically the reality for Biden). Which means Trump should drop Pence and nominate someone that actually invigorates voters
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  via
You mean IF he leaves. There‚Äôs no way he accepts a Biden win. If it‚Äôs a blow out he‚Äôll say Russia did it or some shit and if it‚Äôs close he‚Äôll say it was mail-in fraud. I‚Äôm a bit afraid for December/January regardless of what happens.
Think about the implications of a general strike before the election, after a Biden victory, and after a Trump victory and which would be most effective.
Watch  broadcast: Brain-dead Biden‚Äôs mask mandate, UAE-Israel peace deal, reparations completed, gun confiscation, coffee   Vote Red &amp; save the Republic!
Sounds like biden
Kamala only said she believed those women who said Biden's touching made them uncomfortable. None of them accused Biden of sexual abuse except for the discredited Tara Reade.  Kamala  never said she believed Reade.
Delay until Biden-Harris takes over in February 2021. Then the Russians won't be allowed to set the policy directives for Grenell.
I think despite all the nonsense, the vote will end up in favor of Biden, but they will have created a legitimate claim to challenge, because they control the process. Even if we make it through the election, I think That will activate QAnon terrorists. Frightening territory.
Whether it's $5 or $500, your show of support says #ImAllIn!  Join me in supporting the Biden Victory Fund via    Together we will reclaim our US where #LibertyandJusticeForAll exists - the #RealAmericanHeritage
Do you seriously want four more years of this horrible man? There is only one route to removing Donald Trump. You vote for Joe Biden, proudly!
Oh, and you're absolutely right in pointing out that shouting fire in a crowded theater doesn't start the fire.
Call the presidency everyone, Harris says we've found true leadership in Biden because he said people should wear masks.
Vote Biden for now and spend the next 4 years trying to fix that broken Republican party.
Sweet write-up from one of our favorite foundries  on the creation of this logo, aptly titled: Best News of the Week.

You could use some higher education, because none of your logic makes any sense.  I assumed you were gunna say ‚Äúcause all you educated libs support Biden‚Äù
Please, please, please, please, please, VOTE  ‚úÖBiden/Harris
If Biden was president we‚Äôd be first in the world fighting Covid. Instead of a laughing stock with president dumbo. Someday you‚Äôre going to look very foolish in the rear view mirror - actually - not sure you can be seen in a mirror when you don‚Äôt have a soul.
Interesting, as I thought that was a liability. Biden needed a significantly younger VP to balance the ticket and one who could conceivably be the frontrunner in 2028 or sooner in a worst case scenario.
TX would be a huge win if it went blue. ALL Texas Electoral Votes would go to the blue side (Biden Harris).
Motherfuck don‚Äôt fuck with me today I am sick and tired of all this bullshit. Fuck usps. Fuck ups. Fuck fedex. Fuck Biden/ Harris, fuck covid19, I am about to snap the fuck out.
Well, if you‚Äôre OK with another four years of not liking Trump, just stay at home and don‚Äôt vote for Biden. Really dumb question actually.
Interesting... I didn‚Äôt claim anything counter to your three statements. Reread mine. Bottom line: anyone who doesn‚Äôt vote Biden/Harris makes it more likely that Trump‚Äôs stable base of support is enough to give him four more years. That is simple math.
How does the NBA stack up against a Biden presser?
But how does the NBA stack up against a Biden presser?
Puerto Rico will become a state along with DC under Biden.

our support has been growing but it is not yet the right time for an actual revolution  uh basically, i think your concerns are broadly valid, but i think even if slightly biden is a harm reduction. maybe i can only think this because of relative privilege, idk
i can't tell you that this fear of a potential biden admin isn't valid, but i think he's better (less bad) than trump on most issues, so i would ask what specifically you think is more dangerous about a biden presidency. my thought process is basically:
Those are good Campaign Slogans, Jennifer  but how about this one?  Biden-Harris: We deliver your mail!
Would make actual progress once nominated, but they put up Biden and a "top cop" prosecutor. This government is corrupt on both sides, as long as it stands, they will always force the people to kneel. It is a mob oligarchy.

Biden would likely be a marginally better president than trump. But I refuse to morally condemn anybody who feels apathetic at their choice and decides to focus on surviving day to day. When it comes down to it, I care more what someone does in their day to day life to advance...
Those alternatives are likely to be far right populism. We got trump because Obama didn't do shit for working people. We'll get someone worse than trump after Biden.
If Biden wins he will serve big business and he won't do a thing about the worsening economic inequality. He will fail to ameliorate the problems that the working class face, and more and more people will become disillusioned with the democratic party and seek out alternatives.
But we gotta vote for Biden because of how important the Supreme Court is
I think in some respects just letting the   know i'm still undecided has the  effect of pressuring the party into coughing up more... We're still a few months out. usually by this stage i'd know but Biden  enraged me by nominating Kamala.
It does not serve progressives to just commit your vote to Biden/Kamala 90 days before the election. At least try to sweat them a little bit. No drone bombings. M4A. No 3.8b to Israeli apartheid machine. Now‚Äôs the time to make demands. Art of Deal, you know.
I've been confused really about what i'm going to do. I mean biden's climate agenda is pretty compelling.  It's just that I do want more.
There is no left party in the US. There is no party that even represents left interests in the US. Thus, we can not win any elections where actual leftists are not among the candidates. If Donald Trump wins, we lose. And if Biden wins, *we lose*.
Good luck getting your BlueMAGA racist Biden elected with this voter outreach. Maybe you should do some phonebanking for him.
People keep saying that leftists who don't vote for Biden are just concerned with politics as an aesthetic and don't actually want to win. What those people don't seem to understand is that we can not win this election. Joe Biden is not *us*. The Democratic Party is not our party
Learned about this flawed but profound analogy for the election  Cops shoot to kill. Biden suggested cops should shot people in the leg (we‚Äôll get to him later)  When you vote think of it this way: Would you rather get shot in the heart or the leg and get the chance to recover?
The current schedule says Buttigieg is one of several speakers between 9 and 11 but that Biden is supposed to speak starting at 10pm... so I think everyone will just get a few minutes each before Biden comes on.

This tweet is a microcosm of my point. It's possible to be anti Trump, but want better than Biden. Perpetuating narrative that we have to toe party line because he's the lesser of 2 evils props up existing power structures that have always been bad for everyone but the white 1%
It‚Äôs common sense that if Biden/Harris want people like me to vote for them, they need to put forward a platform I can vote for.
Activists are not a monolith. And the vast majority of the activists I know in Portland and the ones I follow on social media have made it clear they want nothing to do with Biden and the Top Cop.
No to Biden and Kamaunissum
Let's not forget Biden had draft deferments as well. He was eventually exempted because of asthma. But that didn't seem to keep him from playing halfback and defensive end in college.

So describe a reason to vote for Biden then.
If Trump wins it‚Äôs the Biden campaign‚Äôs fault. Trump sucks, it‚Äôs obvious and not at all hard to prove. Biden needs to show that he doesn‚Äôt. Everyone is waiting.

You should consider that I don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden‚Äôs platform the way it is right now, so if he won‚Äôt change his platform he either does not know that there are constituents who feel this way or he does not want my vote.
Congress is on vacation while millions are  out of work and an eviction crisis is looming. At the same time, people are pretending Biden‚Äôs policy proposals matter. What else do they have to do before people understand they don‚Äôt care about us.
Moderates are the enemy of progress. Don't get me wrong. Biden is exponentially better than Trump, but the idea that that's our only option is an illusion to keep the status quo.
It was too late for electoralism *at least* twenty years ago, the bill for supporting a worthless fake opposition party is past due, vote for fucking Biden if you feel like it but it will do absolutely zero good and if you don't believe me now, fucking wait and see
Can't get behind this. 4 years of Biden destroying the climate when we are already at the breaking point. 4 years of growing income inequality and no universal healthcare. We could've had real progressive nominees who would do something about these issues.
Thank you Joe Biden for making your hats in the US. Unlike the slob in the White House who pays China to make his inferior items.
Using that same logic, a vote for third party is a vote for Trump. A vote for third party is a vote for Biden. As a #VoteGreen‚Äôr, my argument is... a vote for Trump is a vote for Biden. A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. #VoteGreen

Biden doesn't need the people who would support this mandate in order to win. He needs the people he's pissing off. It's the margins on the right that keep stealing the Dem presidencies-Biden and Harris demand a nationwide mask mandate until November

You should be asking that question of Schiff,  Pelosi, and Schumer. How about Biden and Harris too? Massive amount of lies have been spoken by them and these lies can be backed up by documentation. Trump may exaggerate some but those are not outright lies like the others tell.

Don‚Äôt make this a Trump vs Biden debate. You‚Äôre being played and manipulated. Don‚Äôt you see that? I don‚Äôt care if we agree on anything else but one thing; If we sacrifice our freedoms, then all those who died for us to have them, died in vain.

Politico is not a valid source. We have to fact check them constantly. Link to where Biden himself said this or where it is on his website.

I hope that is reconsidered under new leadership. Maybe Biden and Harris having both been senators? Likely a Pollyanna perspective...
Here's a few things that might put just how awful a Biden presidency is going to be into perspective.
Should we be embarrassed by good job numbers?   You hated Trump when we had the best economy in the world. You hated Trump before the virus.   You hate him but you don't know why.  You support Biden but you don't know why.   You can't answer any of this as liberals have NOTHING.
Can anyone prove that Biden didn‚Äôt pick his VP by doing a blindfold smell test of locks of hair?
If you don't live in a swing state, and you are planning on voting for Biden you legitimately have not thought that long about politics, and or don't care about things like Medicare For All.   That's harsh, but it's a harsh truth that needs to be told.
I‚Äôve been involuntarily receiving Trump campaign emails and I‚Äôve noticed that they are 100% negative and fear mongering. No ‚Äúyou should vote for us bc we are great and will do x!‚Äù But all ‚ÄúThe Dems/Biden/Harris are evil! Vote against them!‚Äù And they spam 6+ emails a day.

Cool! In a few years when the Left in the U.S. is strong enough for libs like Biden &amp; Harris to stop slapping us around &amp; offer us a bone he can start working on the relationships &amp; understanding he‚Äôll need to form productive coalitions at that point!
She should thank Biden for his years of fucking America for his own benefit.
I say, Joe Biden is not my Boss. I do what I want!!
The mistake in 2016 was giving the left the finger in the hopes that Republicans would vote for Clinton, which was insane, it might not be less insane in 2020 given Biden is basically a Republican, but it shouldn't be something you're supporting if you identify with the left.

I‚Äôd love to know which choice you think could win the election that is happening in less than 3 months.   Even Bernie will vote for Biden...
Which house?  He has at least four!  Chicago, Hawaii, DC, and Martha‚Äôs Vinyard.  All worth millions of dollars.  I laughed at people who thought  was going to give up that life to be Biden‚Äôs VP.  There‚Äôs no way she wants the presidency, either.  They‚Äôre rich!!
Unlike Biden he‚Äôs said that he‚Äôs regretted the ultimate result of that vote and he‚Äôs spent part of his career fighting to fix his mistake. Biden was proud that it led to the creation of the patriot Act, which again Bernie has been very much against.
First pic I‚Äôve seen of Biden wearing a mask tho ü§î
Guess what? Michael Cohen‚Äôs book is dropping &amp; Trump is freaking out because it will end his campaign no matter what he or his sycophants make up about Biden or Harris.

a cynical person might think that the Harris was chosen specifically to court this sort of nonsense as a means to take the heat of of Joe Biden's... interesting public outreach.
The coordinated attack on our democracy continues. The GOP is a criminal organization and needs to be treated as such. If Biden's first action as president is not to authorize a massive investigation in to their corruption America will die. #LockThemUp
Joe Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
Has Biden ever gone after and tried (at least) to repeal a law because he felt it was too reactionary/conservative? Just thinking about if he wins, what might he try to undo that Trump has implemented? I really don‚Äôt see it happening.

You might as well say Biden has a problem with people with legs. Because white evangelical voters have legs.
I believe it's actually Joe Biden and Kamala Harris responsible for cutting America's meat

My point was never that Trump is better than Biden. I simply don‚Äôt like getting vote shamed and called privileged for having well-researched political and moral objections to voting for a guy who has contributed a great deal to why we are in the situation we are in.
Biden will weaken the progressive movement because establishment Dems like Biden, Schumer, Pelosi, etc. are the ones pushing harder than anyone to quell opposition to the status quo. Biden himself admitted nothing will fundamentally change for the ruling class. Progress undone.

One reply was that she had registered and was excited to vote Biden/Harris!
If Biden wins, he will inevitably resign approximately halfway through his term, and Harris will lose the next election to a fascist worse than Trump because she was chosen solely on optics and will have no political mandate. Apparently Democrats are asking for that, though.
When I turned on FOX SPEWS (news) they had a clip of Tulsi Gabbard &amp; Kamala Harris going at it during a debate.  I guess they don‚Äôt have a clue as to what a historic moment this is with Biden picking Harris.

And shouldn‚Äôt a man of faith be honest? Biden is clearly mentally challenged. You can see it by comparing his speeches from a few years ago. Compassion would get the man help not use him as a prop.

Trump campaign‚Äôs attempts to paint Biden as ‚Äòmentally unfit‚Äô could drastically backfire: columnist   (Hmmmm....ya think?)
Biden has ‚Äòutterly devastated‚Äô one of Trump‚Äôs favorite attack lines ‚Äî and he did it with the help of Fox News: journalist

Trump Accuses Biden of Dragging out V.P. Search Instead of Picking First Clown Who Says Yes  via
Well Ted, you may have forgotten what Obama and Biden did to rescue the US economy after Bush.  So Biden did great.
What makes you think Biden the do nothing can do?

This should literally be your biggest red flag if you‚Äôre voting for Biden.
Biden could be comatose, and I would still pick him over Trump.
It‚Äôs gonna be with the firemost depression that I depress that figurative vote button for literal Joe Biden
Trump could try to ride a bike everyday till the election and he couldn‚Äôt ride as smoothly as Biden did with ease yesterday... it‚Äôs also probably safe to say Trump doesn‚Äôt  even know how to ride a bike...
Joe Biden &amp; Susan Rice -- Five More Things You Probably Didn‚Äôt Know about Potential VP

Ha ha ha! When Obama used it the Republicans all screamed! So now I guess it has changed! So when and if Biden uses it : it will be okay because founding fathers said it was a good thing!
A couple things: Why does it look like Nan has a different face? Yes, China would prefer Biden.
This ranks as the stupidest thing to criticize Biden over.  Seriously, this is dumb.
Biden is so fantastic, he can be both sleepy and able to undo God! (I notice that Trump is putting himself above God, because "Sleepy Joe" is too scared to debate him but able to wipe out God. Some Christian!)
The Joe Biden conundrum. Yay, he‚Äôs riding a bike. Eeks, he‚Äôs not wearing a helmet. Good modeling for policy. Poor modeling for our kids.  Honestly, it‚Äôs good. He should do more ‚Äúcontroversial good stuff‚Äù. It sets the online metrics ablaze with real discourse. That‚Äôs what we need.
So weird... I haven‚Äôt been able to find ANY Biden parades! #trumpwins
Just like he says that Biden hates God.  Listen to what he says and remember that he's talking about himself, not Democrats or Biden. It's always about Trump.
Just remember this: Whatever Trump accuses others of doing, that's what he does or would do. #Projection His campaign commercials attack Biden for the very things he subconsciously knows are true about himself. It's why they backfire.

So Russia wants to get Trump reelected, and China prefers Biden. How about we let the American people decide with NO interference for once?
OK , that may be one of the dumbest comments ever made about Joe Biden and Black voters. We know what Joe meant, you on the other hand are just to dumb to know what he meant. Blacks support Biden, period, finish, end of story.

Trump‚Äôs latest attack on Joe Biden is stunningly delusional ‚Äî even for him
Anyone else think Dems trying this before the election is misguided? I can see people not vote for Biden over this because he has already said the little boy  is going to be in charge of taking guns from citizens.
‚ÄòDeranged‚Äô Trump pummeled for lying ‚Äòpracticing Catholic‚Äô Joe Biden will ‚Äòhurt God‚Äô
Biden is "against god, guns and energy" üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Overheard 2 people discussing the presidential election and one said she can't vote for Biden because "you'll get socialism with Biden." It's laughable that ppl actually believe that, but also so sad that we could've had the actual Democratic Socialist. What a mess.
Exactly! But Biden won't do that. He will revert to the way things are supposed to be. The DOJ works for the people, not the president.
‚ÄòA lying #DraftDodger‚Äô: Republican military #veterans slam Trump and declare their support for #Biden in new attack adI know, Hillary is offering to help in a Biden/Harris ticket, and I‚Äôm thinking that you can‚Äôt help if you are at Gitmo, can you?
Biden‚Äôs pick of Kamala Harris is the last nail in the coffin for his presidential aspirations. We cannot allow a blind lead the deaf in America which has finally risen to be the true super power of this world. This country needs you for four more years to finish the job.
What were you planning to do if Biden won?
How do you know?  Obama didn‚Äôt immediately end the war in Iraq and never closed Guantanamo Bay. Why will Biden be different after Trump?
I do not disagree&amp; I am super disillusioned about Biden. This Will be the 1st time I will throw up in my mouth a little bit when I vote. I had no particular opinion until after 2016 cuz I wasn't political. I'm mainly voted democratic &amp;pretty much Didn't pay attention Past that. 1
And why did Biden say to wear masks for next 3 months? Don‚Äôt need to wear masks after Nov 3rd??? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Writing copy for the GOP is easy: first write the truth, then do a word find-replace to change every ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù to ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù and every ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù to ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù.
He's a Biden troll, probably puppeted by Dr. Johnson.
Yes, this is more of the pre-explanation for Biden's defeat.
This isn't wrong. It's probably the biggest reason that Joe Biden is going to lose in November. Health insurance is a completely useless system. #MedicareForAll is a sensible compromise.  Biden supports making insurance execs richer with bigger ACA subsidies. How will that help?
He's vote shaming people for not supporting Biden now, isn't he? I know Cusack bullies anti-Russiagaters.
Why is he still attacking Bernie now that Biden is the nominee and Bernie has endorsed him? Is he trying to help Trump win?
Joe Biden in a nutshell
I agree. Expecting Joe Biden to suddenly surrender to the protesters or strikers is... na√Øve.
The way I see it is that Biden is causing less emissions than Trump and that Biden has the strength to keep pushing.
Help keep Social Security and make it stronger Mr Biden!
Help Social Security Mr Biden!
Kamala only said she believed those women who said Biden's touching made them uncomfortable. None of them accused Biden of sexual abuse except for the discredited Tara Reade.  Kamala  never said she believed Reade.

This isn‚Äôt about who you personally like. This is about saving the rule of law and preventing fascism. Vote Biden now to secure your right to vote in future elections, because Trump is blatantly attacking this right.
Interesting take: Biden‚Äôs civility &amp; humanity show weakness, whereas the constant lying, misogyny &amp; racism coming out of trump‚Äôs mouth are considered strength. Only the GOP could come up with this twisted logic.
She and Biden are the mass incarceration ticket. #ChainsYouCanBelieve in should be their campaign slogan.
But I'm not voting Biden/Harris
With the announcement of the Biden-Harris ticket, I‚Äôm more convinced than ever that we need a well organized and coordinated #GeneralStrike.   #ChainsYouCanBelieveIn
Why do the Biden Dems look and sound like Reagan Republicans? Even the ‚Äúbig tent‚Äù is a Reagan line.
Biden's team pick of Kamala Harris does little to advance his chance of being elected Prez. Who really believes that a first term done nothing Senator has the capability knowledge &amp; courage to be Prez when Biden dies of another aneurysm or goes into total dementia?

Isn't Wisconsin a bit cash-strapped right now because of the virus which you refuse to do anything about? You were one of the first to cry Russia hoax. and yet look where you are getting your information from now, so is this now the Biden hoax?
Yup the dnc made a horrible mistake appointing biden thinking it was safe then told him to take harris who has a horrible track record prosecuting young black males, also many democrats are gun owners and both are very anti-firearms
What a joke Biden is.
Not the proper role of a President, Biden is a fool.
Proof that Biden has no idea of what a President does.
Biden won't solve these problems.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Bingo! Joe Biden showed he understands real politics and does not bear personal grudges. In short, Biden is a grownup.
It also shows how badly out of touch Dem leadership is, in nominating Joe Biden during a plague and then pushing him to take Kamala Harris as his running mate during an anti-cop uprising.
Imagine a real leader. No need to imagine. Joe Biden is that leader.
So good of you to campaign for Biden-Harris against your party.
Beto is 100% for Joe Biden. And Beto is a current and future star in the Democratic Party.
My stepson spent more of his life behind bars than out because of Joe Biden. He's a fascist who is the reason schools are still segregated and so many people are in prison for non-violent crime.
I think we should mix it up this year and have Kamala debate Trump and Biden debate Pence.
How will Biden and Harris take us to the middle? They're nearly as right as Trump.  Teach kids how to be grifters and thieves? Yes, I'm against that.
And Trump is hated by a majority of America because he actually committed real crimes, unlike your weird Biden conspiracies.
You don't appear to have any perspective.  What positive direction do you think Biden and Harris are moving in?  They remind me of Trump, honestly, and your platitude filled support for them reminds me of MAGA.  Congrats #BlueMaga.
Very plausible, though of course Biden actually wants to be tougher on Venezuela than Trump. Or so he claims.
How, exactly, are Biden and Harris "on the side of the people?"  They're on the side of the private prison contractors, the MIC, and Big Tech. None of those special interests are "the people."
I have no idea whether Joe knows he's lying or not, but it doesn't matter. The danger to this country are Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and the socialist mob they represent. Let's take the masks off, figuratively and literally, and keep America in the hands for Americans!
That's exactly why I don't have any faith in the Biden/Harris ticket. It's a Dem platform that ignores the reality of the world post-covid.
Suburban woman here.  Voting for Biden/Harris 2020!
Yeah, these idiots love to try and put everyone in a neat little box and assume that if you criticize Biden, you HAVE to be a Trump voter. They've successfully turned me into a Trump voter even though I've voted Libertarian for the last 2 elections.
So  you should really meet with  again. Make another #MedicareForAll commercial to get people to vote for Biden!  Then tell us you're against it when you're VP!
What  is calling the "center left position that Biden and white moderates have come around to" is giving the damned cops more money to kill people.  So yes, now is the time to attack Kamala and Biden on their horrific records and policies in this area.
How is that different from letting Biden kill our kids to "get rid of Trump?"
Politicians are going to always do what they think they need to do to keep their positions secure, whether we as voters like it or not.  Is Benjamin Dixon actually "embracing Biden?"  We should be making it clear to Biden he can't win without us.
Awesome! I look forward to listening! I hope you speak less to us about why we should vote Biden, and more to Biden about how he can earn our vote. You are the strongest voice for change in the whole line up!
You're a segregationist apologist too. That's why you're defending Biden. It all makes sense now.
Biden/Harris 2020: we will keep dropping bombs and killing other people's kids!  H/t
You appear to be trying to unite everyone arod voting for Biden but haven't been able to offer a compelling argument for why we should or satisfactorily answer questions about your motives. You appear to be trying to divide us, in fact. We are all united. Join us?
So you have decided to unite us all by supporting Biden so we all turn on you?
So you're making the divisive stupidity worse by telling people to vote for Biden? That's stupid and divisive.  How is Biden not fascist?
Biden wants MORE of all those things.
Yes. So stop apologizing for Biden and telling us to embrace a fascist. Join the Left and help organize it instead of attacking it.  Voting for Biden is "what we have done" that hasn't worked. Repeated once more.
Biden said he would be tougher on protesters in Portland than Trump. You support that shit?  What do you think we're protesting in Portland?  Essentially, it's Biden and Kamala. Trump is just a symptom of their disease.
You're acting as if embracing Biden is somehow an improvement over the current circumstances. It isn't.
Why do you think Biden won't use live rounds?
Check out Nate Silver's feed. Biden's numbers are softer than Hillary's. The Dems are in massive denial.
You hate women! You‚Äôre threatened by smart women!
What do you have to say to your dad about this deplorable comment about women? We know how little he thinks of you
Life matters.
All lifes matter.
Dr. Glaude is not usually a shill. He‚Äôs one of many people who realizes te Dems could have done better than Biden, imo.
This morning on  I was very pleased to see  say clearly that Biden needs to be pushed to deliver specific policy solutions.  People are starting to speak up about the need for the Biden/Harris ticket to be more responsive to the Dem base.
Would be more important for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to start meeting with him regularly and listening to what he has to say.   Yes? ü§î
I'm a progressive and I am NOT voting for Biden and Kamala.  Pass it on. #GreenParty
I think the  is a damn great idea and a positive as I‚Äôm Progressive/Green/the democratic wing of the Democratic Party but I‚Äôm voting Biden to get Trump out. Progressives and left as possible down ballot and build leftist alternative parties to contest soon!
Brutal caricature of Biden &amp; Kamala Harris. Very funny!
It‚Äôs time to grow the Green Party as much as possible yet I‚Äôm reluctantly voting Biden to get Trumps ass out. Damn I wish it was Sanders Warren or Vice versa ticket but down ballot and otherwise progressive as possible and Green if they have a chance
People say ‚ÄúI‚Äôd run through a bunch of murder hornets to vote for Biden‚Äù but I‚Äôm not seeing y‚Äôall actually be this dedicated about Biden cause. I did see people pour all their energy into calling people and going out to get people to vote for Bernie. Where‚Äôs that devotion? ü§î
I‚Äôm voting for Biden no doubt and a progressive.  Still want some better legislation and more ambitious agenda than what I‚Äôve seen and heard put forth.  They‚Äôre gonna have to whittle it down in Congress so aim high and settle a bit later
Biden was supposed to have already done that.
I can't find anything referencing how you feel abt Biden's VP pick. I can see where you wouldve mixed emotions. In another time &amp; place you probably would have been chosen or at very least in top 2. I'm waiting to hear what administrative position he asks you to be in.
Also, don't flatter yourself.  The only thing I'm mad about is the general stupidity and futility of a "never-biden/never-trump" paradigm.

Harris and Biden are both low grade archons.
Limiting AOC speaking time is about limiting Republican attack point that Biden will be a patsy for the ‚Äúfar left, socialist Democrats.‚Äù This is about cutting the attack off at the pass.

Do you think this is helping?? Does Trump??  This could be a Campaign Ad for Biden ffs
It's a cyclical problem. Biden won't make enough waves to drive up his negatives so Trump is forced to make news conferences, reenforcing his "show" reputation and keeping negatives high.
Biden introduces Harris, campaigning together for the first time in Delaware.
Oh, I know. Biden can't just bring it back, though.
4Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£% of home health workers are on SNAP or Medicaid while providing essential care during a pandemic. We need to  #ProtectEssentialWorkers by paying them fairly, and providing COVID-19 protections like PPE, sick leave and workers' compensation.
Oh girl I'm done giving that foolery my energy. After Biden announced Sen. Harris as his running mate I feel like the elephant named Trump has been lifted. Baby girl I'm so happy I'm floating. I'm hopeful again and that's dangerous. I'm ready to vote yesterday.
Thank you  for not showing the mango madman showing more hatred and lies. It's a nice change. And thank you for airing the Biden and Harris speaches.
I‚Äôm not disaffiliated.  I‚Äôm very much a conservative which is why I don‚Äôt like either of the choices.  Many conservative pundits have said they will vote for Biden to get rid of Trump and I sympathize with that.
There was a poll in the news very recently said 60% of people think Biden won‚Äôt complete his first term.  Probably in all major papers‚ÄîI don‚Äôt recall where I saw it.
Vote trump out if you can't vote Biden in.
Assuming u don't want trumpass in office anthr 4 years, why bash our only hope to end his reign of terror? If we don't end this, your chance of evr gettng a 3rd party in office goes out the door. Biden isn't the perfect choice, but he's our only hope.
You missed the most important part though.  There's actually no difference. Both Trump and Biden want to give the police more money, more manpower, and more military equipment.  Ignorant.
Dude, when you can tell me the difference between Biden's police reform plan and Trump's, you can talk down to me.
Okay, it was the second worst.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.
Even more, you don't PRE-compromise your positions BEFORE the fight starts. Biden is pre-compromised.
WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris make first public appearance as White House running mates.

I'm extremely happy about Biden's VP pick  #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris
The Biden-Harris exchanges when Joe calls Kamala to 'ask' her the big question are as priceless as they are beautiful.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden, but there is no way this is accurate.
Notice he's not promising anything for Biden, just throwing the true charge at Trump.
WaPo will say and print anything to help Biden. Zero ethics.
You‚Äôre completely incapable of attacking Biden on issues so you have to resort to childish taunts. Sad
Sounds like Joe Biden's plan.
That's exactly how I feel about it. Especially when they're using rallying cries like "people are dying."  Biden doesn't care and  should know it.
The earth will just move on to the next stage of evolution. We will all be dead, of course, unless you convince Biden to do something about it.
To quote the philosopher Carlin, "The world will be fine. The people are f*cked, but the world will be fine."  Get on Biden to save them.
Just say No to Joe Biden in 2020 if you want the USA to go Great again just say NO to Joe.

It's Kamala: Biden Picks Harris as Running Mate -
In order to enact the kind of change the radical left wants to see, and indeed I think many agree, we must have people who are open to being radicalized. Do I think that Biden or Harris are those people? Not necessarily.
Why We Need Blue: A Thread   I understand the frustration as someone who is not appeased by either party, and has not been in quite some time. I was not happy with the Clinton choice, and I am not happy with the Biden choice. HOWEVER
You do know the photo of Biden "hiding" was a photoshopped image. He was attending a football viewing party in Iowa with numerous people and press in attendance.
In the case of Biden, most people think he won‚Äôt make it all the way through his term so VP choice matters more than usual.  It sounds like you‚Äôre hypothesizing that a negligible # of voters are changeable.  Even it‚Äôs a small number, I doubt it‚Äôs negligible.
Joe Biden picked someone who could have been running mate any day of the week who just happens to be a woman of color. I am not going to celebrate until they win. I celebrated in 2016 and ended up heart broken. She can't make history without our help.
Exactly! She will challenge Biden when necessary and is ready to take the reins if needed. This is what we should expect in a VP, not the spineless sycophancy we have in Pence.
I can understand that. Completely. Biden is old.
We have that coming Biden/Harris!
I know at least one person who justifies voting for Biden because she feels more likely to survive his presidency. She bases this in her experience organizing under Trump versus organizing under Obama.  It doesn't appear to be hyperbole. I can back  up here.
This is you applying your personal logic which would cause you to predict Biden gets 100% of the vote.  You will be wrong.  There are always voters at the margin and Harris is not helpful to Biden at pulling those voters towards him.  That‚Äôs not smart for Biden.
Exactly what is foremost in my mind right now. Biden can‚Äôt do that.
Biden has that thing you call self esteem. It comes in that package of character that most of us are handed when we are born and is included in the daily values that our parents feed us as a child.
If she helps move the coming administration 10-20 more progressive, I‚Äôd consider volunteering for them but it‚Äôs Biden and Harris and their in it to get moderates and undecideds not as interested in the long term of the country in my opinion.  Still got my vote though
Moderately.  She‚Äôs very solid and the perfect attack so Biden can play above the fray and the ‚Äúadult‚Äù and good guy.  Wanted someone with better policies and ideas (Warren) but Harris is cool
I think he‚Äôs saying it was a poor choice from Biden‚Äôs perspective.  I was considering voting Biden but Harris makes him less palatable to me.  I‚Äôm more likely to abstain now.  Hard to vote for a ticket with such a poor character as VP.
I think Karen Bass might‚Äôve been more palatable to cross-over voters.  Harris mainly pleases people who are going to vote for Biden no matter what.  She‚Äôs like Trump in that she has no concept of the limits of presidential power.  I also think she will be vulnerable in 2024.
Yes- vote Biden/Harris
Eyuck! Biden doesn't even have a decent coat of paint.
The Trump campaign has struggled to define Biden and Harris, trying to portray them as far-left socialists -- a claim that's ridiculous to actual socialists.  via   So Trump thinks that both Biden and Harris hate america! Just like Trump/Pence!
Every Trump supporter on Twitter upon learning Kamala named Biden's running mate.
If you really want to understand what we have in front of us, read Caste: The Origin of Our Discontents by  . There's a lot of work ahead to deconstruct the system of caste and Biden/Harris are the ones to get us started.
Privileged entourage vote for Biden, privileged enough not to care.
Twitter all in for Jie Biden
Wont support anything that hate monger has her name on just like id never support joe biden or anyone who supports him due to his decades of racism and hate
The top difference between you and her... she didn't have to be blackmailed to become a Biden supporter.
I‚Äôm really looking forward to this myself. Biden has always wanted the President to have the powers Trump is now using.
It‚Äôs a sign of character that Joe Biden picked the black woman who so publicly called him out on his problematic comments.   She called him out. He called her in.
Game over for Trump. Biden by chosing Kamala has assured a strong democratic base turnout and that was Trumps only hope to find a way to turn back the blue tsunami coming this November
I recall us making a wager in 2018 regarding Harris being chosen by Biden if he were to win the nomination. I said that if I were wrong I would put a Trump photo on Twitter. You said Biden wouldn‚Äôt and if he did you would post photo of you kissing your own ass :)
I‚Äôve been arguing that Harris‚Äô callout during that debate was a point in her favor. Biden needs people who will call him on bullshit, not people who only know how to kiss ass.
If Trump is still flailing by Election Day, I think a significant number of his supporters will stay home rather than risk voting.   Biden supporters will crawl through glass even if he is ahead by 20.
Harris is a Black woman who explicitly supports prison slavery.  Joe Biden is a white man whose greatest political achievement made prison slavery a huge business.  Yes, it‚Äôs a pro-slavery ticket. Any questions?
Trump thinks Biden picking Harris is a sign of weakness.
Dear Dr. Biden:  I am so excited to vote for your husband.  The last three and one half years have been difficult and working in public education and I have seen so many changes .  We need change and we look forward to your husband being elected.
Yes, I do still think we won‚Äôt be driven into a communist country under Biden.  You need to work on word definitions; here‚Äôs a good start -  Communism is a political/economic system, a classless society which the major means of production, are owned and controlled by the public.
Cheaters, Biden family gets rich at serving country.
It‚Äôs going to be hard for the Putin/Trump campaign to persuade Leftists that Harris is a neo-liberal shill while also telling the Trump base that she is the Marxist controller for Joe Biden.   Especially if we keep highlighting the contradiction.
In a classic moment of sentimentality temporarily eclipsing voting priorities... I was considerably more excited when I heard Kamala Harris had Church of God roots than I was earlier today, when I heard she was Biden's pick for VP nom. Still, a solid choice.
Enough with being cautious.   Biden/Harris will win.
Top Democrats praise Biden's choice of Kamala Harris for VP  via
The Obama White House was one of the most leak proof orgs in Washington. Naturally, Biden‚Äôs operation is carrying on that tradition.
Most of the people criticizing Biden beforehand were mostly just tired of waiting.
Is the Emperor's New Clothing delusion that Trum seems to exist within going to finally crumble with Biden/Harris now in play?
Trump, you are disrespectful to women, veterans, the disabled, people of color, health experts, healthcare workers, journalists, as well as ignorant of the Constitution and history. Go to hell!
Is it wrong for me to say I think I like her more than Biden? Congrats Sen. Harris. Give 'em hell, and make me proud of my original home state. #KamalaHarrisForVP
She doesn‚Äôt stand against the people who stand against #BlackLivesMatter. She stands with the cops against the working class, like Biden and Trump.conservatives democrats always made the same promises biden does. 'business as usual' is not going to fix the over reach that just happenned. If he holds the fbi above the law then hes just another nazi dictator running a police state.
Trump and associates crimes are too severe to allowed them to walk free. There will be no Pres. Ford to pardon him, like Nixon was! Biden has already stated he will NOT stand in the way of Trump's prosecution! This is the REAL reason Trump will do ANYTHING to win reelection!
LIAR. Biden!!! Not a trusteorthy bone in your body!!!
Now is not the time in this universe to be picky about leaders. The choice is between Biden-Harris or Death.  Hmmm let me think about that...
If Trump is removing HUNDREDS of mail sorting machines and 1 in 4 votes are ALREADY mail in votes...  Who actually benefits more if democrats stay home and cant get their vote counted?  Who is actually trying to rig this election?  Biden or Trump?
Vice President Biden, there is a difference between absentee ballots and mass mail in ballots. Please review your civics and especially the US Constitution if you want my post graduate educated, white, female, non-victim, suburban vote.
bernie is even worse. damn the demoicrats for even talking to sanders and for runnind biden. Boith too conservative for me.
We can elect Joe Biden and Kamala but unless we get rid of the filibuster we will have political gridlock for at least the next 2 years.
I just heard Dan Bongino say the Harris Biden ticket wants us to wear masks all the time, inside and outside. I describe Joe Biden as Crucking fazy, I'm trying to be a lady.
We will never settle for Biden, we will not settle until this whole damn system has been dismantled, Biden and Trump seek to disarm the working class, which is an inherently bad thing as anyone who isn't armed is subject to the will of fascism, no matter who they are.
its always serious when its poor people, she said she wasnt to use the fbi to clean up our communities. What has she said shed do to stop the fbi from picking the president? What will biden do to stop that?
This week‚Äôs Slant column reports on state Sen. James Manning‚Äôs statement on a new law passed to limit police use of force, the announcement of California Sen. Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs running mate, thanks readers for their support ‚Äî and more.

I would like to see them get on the debate stage. If you believe science, which neither Trump nor Biden do, we don‚Äôt have much time to reverse climate change. Biden refuses to endorse policies that turn that around in time. So facing catastrophic effects, we should just back...

Dude...I don't give one rat if Biden is aphasic...Trump has GOT to go...
People voted for Biden our of fear and out of perceived electability.  Hardly anyone believes he‚Äôs a great intellectual or a policy maker.
This thread is cracking me up!
Orwell would be aghast at both Trump and Biden/Harris.
Look for Barr to arrest Biden in October.
Full on Democrat here and I'm not excited about Biden, but he knows government and how to run the country.
Really? You think 80% of Americans make over 400,000 per year?
Yep as soon as trump our and Biden and Harris is in. Republicans are desperate crooks
you've tried to defund it for decades... Who do you think you're fooling?? C'MON MANNNNNNNNNNN
You actually think Biden will indict anyone ??? I am skeptical
theresnothing liberal about the way democrats treated hillary or the way they treat liberals. people like biden gave you trump. And go buy yourself a party that doesnt hate panty suits with your dsa money
Anyway point being is there is too much risk and what if Oregon does have a shot of turning red because of massive voter suppression? Fuck the DNC and Biden for picking a cop VP but bite the bullet and vote for the bastard anyway because that‚Äôs pickle we in.
biden voted for segregation and harris ran this time on cleaning up communities. I will not state that i believe them or not
As a leftist who wants Biden to win, I have some advice for y‚Äôall in the establishment:  ‚ÄúCome the fuck on‚Äù is not going to convince leftists to vote for centrists. Try something else.
Didn‚Äôt attract anyone who wasn‚Äôt already planning to vote for Biden
I am a touchy feely person like Biden. I hug everyone! These are his family!    At least he doesn‚Äôt molest women in clubs, dressing rooms, at pageants and have affairs while wife #3 is pregnant,oh &amp; brag about being able to grab women in their privates (used vulgar terminology).
And Biden/ the DNC haven't? One wrong doesn't negate another.   If I murder 1 or 5 people, I'm still a murderer. I don't understand how you #BlueMAGA people can support any of it. So gross.
Well guess  got snickered by  too. Oh well, not that he was ever known for anything other than RoboCop anyways. Enjoy Biden James!
FOX's Jeanine Pirro broadcasted a Veiled Threat that Biden would not make it to the election. There were no consequences for that horrible statement. If a democratic broadcasting station said Trump will not make it to the election the FBI with guns blazing with raid their office.
Take Biden and an honest administration.
Nope. No fracture big enough to fit an orange dictator-wannabe through it. Not even close. Stop trying to make it seem like we aren‚Äôt all voting Biden/Harris no matter what. 48 million in 48 hours. There‚Äôs no contest in a free and fair election.
A vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for police terrorism.
democrats hung hillary out to dry for 30 years... they presumed her guilty with no evidence. If trump wins again he will grind their pathetic elitis party to dust. if biden wins he wil;;l try to repeal some tax cuts :)
While Biden prepares to win the presidency come November, Trump plays 3 dimensional Chess with the Middle East and claims he‚Äôs made historical deals!! "Play it again Sam" how Republicans will lose everything in November! TRUMP IS A RACIST!!!
I‚Äôve seen so many bad takes on how electing Biden is gonna be some big victory for queer rights and all I can think about is this
if "Work with Biden" means impeach him, make Harris president and completely undermine centrism by making congress a squad of 535... maybe they're half-right.
Are the cognitively impaired? Well, they are biden bros, that should tell you everything that you need to know.
Joe Biden is definitely actually racist... Just look at his voting record...
IS THE WORST EVIL!  Ask about the troops Putin had killed, &amp; Trump did NADA! Ask about the 1000's of KURD allies he left to die in battle by rmvng our troops! You can't prove what you said! If you don't like Biden/Harris simply don't vote for them but don't spew lies!
Biden wasn't introduced to Jill until 3 years after the tragedy.  I would take a good hard look at your informational sources.... they are misleading you bigly
I honestly can't think of one thing that Biden has said that shows he's trying to block religious freedom.
Any vote other than Biden-Harris is support for Trump. Do you want 4 more years of this?
Thanks. Give me some more reasons why I should cancel my plans to vote Green and vote, instead, for the Biden/Harris ticket.
The deal Biden says is the work of past administrations:)
Harris will likely be the 2024 nominee, assuming Biden wins and she handles the VP slot with a modicum of success.   #YangGang it is our job to make SURE Yang is on that ticket.
Funny you think Biden wants to bring our mfg jobs back to America when it was him and Obama outsourced those jobs to begin with.
JFK, FDR, Reagan, Obama, and now Pence. Wow what a speech giver. And the roar of the crowd. Watch out Biden this guy means business
They each had enough confidence to tell Biden‚Äôs VP vetting team directly that they thought it was Harris‚Äôs campaign. Amazing.

Let me get this straight in my head. Who has always had a pet dog? Trump or Biden?
‚ÄúBiden advisers asked about contributions she received as state attorney general from Steven Mnuchin, who at the time was running a bank, OneWest, that was accused of violating foreclosure laws. Ms. Harris declined to pursue prosecutions in the case.‚Äù

Biden/Harris merch on the way!
Oh yeah, like it's going to be so hard to beat Biden and Harris. The second he announced Harris, so so many of his supporters suddenly left and will not be voting for him at all. The debates will be hilarious. Trump wall mop the floor with Biden.
This is such a crazy cartoon I dont know where to start. This would be like if JFK was in heaven and he told Joe Biden "I love your convertible :)"

Since the right wing leaders always blames others for what they are themselves guilty of doing, it is obvious right wing child molesters are behind this campaign against Biden. Not rocket science.
So Biden/Harris will mandate that everyone wear a mask for the next 3 months if elected? Guess they think if elected they will be king/queen, well they can kiss a$$, I'm not a child that needs a parent to decide what is in my best interest. Food will be next watch and see.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not allowed to criticize Biden and you‚Äôre not allowed to push him on any policies until after the election!‚Äù  Considering the fact this is the time period when he‚Äôs *releasing* his policy proposals and his various agendas, this is a terrible idea.
We can vote for Biden and hold him accountable at the same time. It‚Äôs not like our brains ran out of energy to do multiple things   Blindly swearing allegiance while not holding him accountable is a terrible idea.
The vitriol and shocking statements coming from Trump are an indication of his insanity. He wants to prosecute Obama and Biden for treason???? What!!! Where are the men with white coats and straight jackets? Yet the criminal Republican Senators keep quiet.
Fuck Donald Trump and Fuck Joe Biden

If I wished that both Biden and Trump had to drop out of running for POTUS due to illness does that make me a bad person?

Supporting Biden/Harris doesn't require *blindly* supporting them.  You should be willing to hold them accountable-- remember Biden has a long history of being a pro-Bank anti-consumer Democrat.  This is just a fact.  You need to be willing to keep him in line.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very accurate to say the party is moderate when Democrats voted based on their fears. Multiple polls showed policies pushed by Bernie and Warren were more popular than Biden. Polling specifically showed Democratic voters to trust Bernie more on healthcare
Obama was too charming; he made democrats lazy. Nobody likes Biden; we're going to be on his ass the entire time.
This is ignorant of all the progress we've made these last years. The left is alive and strong. We will effectively pressure Biden and the democrats to clean up this mess. Our words are currently falling on deaf ears. It will not be like that after January.
placing my bet now that biden picks janet napolitano for secretary of education because of the way she successfully handled (fired, arrested, mowed down) striking graduate workers asking for #cola (cost of living adjustments)

Our only route to victory is hoping Biden gets more aggressive. We know that Trump is actively anti-environment and literally wants to accelerate the problem.
I think people are going to be genuinely surprised when this continues under a president Biden
So far, Biden and the DNC have shown a lot of contempt for progressives. We‚Äôll vote for Biden, but only because it‚Äôs getting Trump out of office.
Biden/Harris, typical imperialist, corrupt, corporate-owned, and opportunist ticket from the #Democrats.  Do not vote for it and hope for a change.
.... now Joe Biden, he definitely is racist and has racist policies. Always has. That is easily proven. But I would like you to prove that Trump is. I bet you can't. You are pathetic.
The most effective way to ensure  continued and significant influence in a Biden administration is to elect a Democratic Senate majority.

He‚Äôs explaining why we won‚Äôt vote for Biden.
I‚Äôm all for pushing for progressive legislation, but bagging on Biden‚Äôs 1994 crime bill vote or saying Harris is a cop after they are chosen as THE ONLY GODT-DAMNED TICKET THAT CAN PRESERVE OUR DEMOCRACY is what Putin wants. Save it for November 5th.
Why not have Biden do that, he is after all the supposed POTUS candidate? Also, should Harris address her accusations that Biden is a racist and at least a sexual assaulter?
The people have spoken. Biden maybe won't listen.. Trump will actively not listen.  And if Biden does not listen, our protests will very likely have a larger impact on a Biden administration.  It's so obvious what the right choice is. And abstaining in November is not it.
You‚Äôve implied multiple times that young people‚Äôs opinions don‚Äôt matter so why are you so pressed about my tweets? Biden and Harris both ran terrible campaigns, they are only succeeding because Trump, in comparison, is a total disaster. There is no enthusiasm for Biden. None.
You seem to have a problem with any criticism of Biden/Harris.   Do you think they are infallible?  Do you think we should be prohibited from saying anything negative about them?  Since you have so much disdain for young people, why do you reply to my tweets?
And the only way to change that is to have Biden move further to the Left to entice them.  This is the alternative
No, I think it‚Äôs healthy to point out dissatisfaction with the VP choice because it will only pressure Biden to move further left. The 100,000+ people that retweeted those anti-Kamala memes probably aren‚Äôt thrilled about voting for Biden
She actually won't unless Biden dies. Are you looking for that to happen?
It really is dependent on the president.  Some presidents allow their VPs to have more power and influence, some don't.  If Biden has selected Warren (or Karen Bass!) that wouldve signaled a willingness to be more progressive.  Instead he chose Kamala Harris, an empty suit.
I know Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are both terrible politicians but please vote Democratic downballot in November üòî
Biden and Harris will be the best thing to happen to America sense Obama and Biden left office
Of course it is a shell game. But now we know it and time has come to change the game. This election is only part of it. But if Trump is elected again, the USA is dead and gone. At least with Biden, there is someone who will listen. Everything will change sooner than expected.
That Harris pick yesterday, hit Trump supporters like rabies! And yet, they know they would have hated ANYONE Biden picked.
Nothing about what I‚Äôve said implies I‚Äôm not voting for Biden. We should be allowed to criticize the ticket
I believe that is the boat a lot of us are in. So, responding to every angry tweet with how if someone doesn't vote for Harris/Biden they will be ensuring mass deaths is really not necessary.  We know. We're angry and tired as hell, but we know.
Let me make this clear:  I am angry as hell that Kamala Harris was selected as VP.  But, me continually talking about just how pissed I am does NOT change my vote this November. I am still voting for Biden - I'm just even angrier about it than I was before.
Doesn‚Äôt attract any voter who wasn‚Äôt already planning to vote for Biden. Young voters and progressives do not trust her

I don't ordinarily display political signs, but I ordered a Biden/Harris sticker, and I will display it proudly, full of hope! #BidenHarris2020
You can be angry with the VP choice and still vote for Biden.  Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt support student debt relief, a wealth tax, or Medicare for All.  Her record as attorney general and DA has a lot of blemishes.   But at least she‚Äôs better than Mike Pence!
Yeah I‚Äôm voting for Biden as well
Oh yeah, Kamala is Joe Biden's little blue pill for sure.
I haven‚Äôt seen a single Warren person say they‚Äôre voting for Trump because of the Kamala VP choice  I have seen a ***lot*** of tweets from young people expressing their disdain and anger at Biden for his decision.
The way he uses stupid childish names to insult Biden and Kamala is beyond belief.
Let me debunk this lie:  Kamala Harris recorded her endorsement video for Joe Biden *before* Warren dropped out.
This comparison doesn‚Äôt feel right. I mean Biden is 71% campaigning in the background, so adjusted for that it seems he is doing much better.
CNN drops the death ticker the instant Biden is elected.
I know people in my own life that supported Biden and Kamala in the primaries and argued with me for months that didn‚Äôt even bother to register to vote in the primaries. These are deeply unserious people.
Joe is a friend to Wall St though...
You can't blame her for what has been in place for decades. But I sure as hell know that she and Biden are not Trump and are more open to change and reason. Get rid of Trump and the GOP in the Senate and the rest is much easier.
Criticize Harris and Biden but never forget the existential crisis we‚Äôre in right now. I‚Äôm voting for Biden and Harris and you should too. Then we‚Äôll protest them too.
Biden had overwhelming black support in the south, specifically South Carolina. Across the country it was evenly split between him and Bernie.  Trump won suburban white women last time but the polling is showing he‚Äôs lost them.
Another liar. I bet you the farm that Biden did NOT say that.
And you're calling BIDEN racist. Give me a break, you lying hypocrite.
When will the Democratic candidates for President and Vice President receive security protection? Biden perhaps already has it because he‚Äôs a Former Vice President. Kamala Harris will need it immediately because of all of Trump‚Äôs crazy second amendment thugs. üëÄüëÄ
i‚Äôve written out like a dozen draft tweets about the author of how to be an anti-racist supporting biden/harris and i just...... please........ why..............
That‚Äôs not gonna help fight against Biden‚Äôs lack of cognitive ability. He can‚Äôt get that back. Lol
no kate this is simply NOT POSSIBLE and i won‚Äôt entertain the thought for a SINGLE SECOND! i‚Äôm too busy settling for biden and thinking it‚Äôs an effective strategy to encourage disillusioned nonvoters!
The problem I see is Biden will continue shitty policy just be better at shutting up about it‚Äî he will deflect to KH who being a woman of color will be central to the discourse. So how much will actually change and how much will just be spit shined into something prettier?
For sure. He‚Äôs been my personal pick since I could vote, but all of them have done shit that‚Äôs negatively effected people. Yeah, imo Biden is the ‚Äòlesser of two evils‚Äô. That doesn‚Äôt mean I have to like it or agree with him or not be unhappy about it. Just don‚Äôt want Trump again.
Thank you, Katy. The most heart wrenching aspect of the US politics is incrementalism. You aren‚Äôt going to fix it by accelerationism, and you can‚Äôt just skip to 2024. Every progressive should do everything in their power to make Biden a one term president.
I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   If you‚Äôre not, you are only helping Donald Trump.   That‚Äôs your right, but I wish you could be adult enough to accept responsibility for the choice.
Well the Dems aren‚Äôt exactly known for playing ‚Äúsmart politics‚Äù as you say and I think what he said is spot on. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs openly stating he‚Äôs not voting Biden. The Dems cater to corporate interests and strive to be more concervative instead of truly progressive.
It‚Äôs kind of hilarious that the Biden team thinks choosing Harris is an actual appeal to the left. Yeah, let‚Äôs pick a prosecutor who has one of the most tumultuous relationships with the country‚Äôs Black community during historic anti-police protests.
I can‚Äôt get excited about Biden with anyone. Harris politically is somewhat undefined. But I do think having her on the ticket is a big step for this country. It does make more likely to vote for the ticket. Doesn‚Äôt mean I will ultimately.
Careful Kamala, joe Biden might rape you and then claim insanity. #CreepyJoeBiden #JoeBiden #Biden2020 #Election2020 #Biden2020Landslide #SusanRice #BidenIsAPredator #BidenIsARacist #BlackLivesMatter #DNC #DNCisCorrupt
I just saw someone on Twitter ranting about Biden and Harris being our only chance to prevent authoritarianism. Haha! People are fucking insane. This country is fucked. Authoritarianism is our only option. Choose your flavor wisely. Vanilla or ultra vanilla. #BidenHarris2020
I've donated to Joe Biden on quite a few occasions, but on this special day I dug deep like many of you. Thank you Joe and thank you Senator Harris! Kamala was the only pick and I'm so pleased to have her on the ticket!
Some parts of our culture will maybe not progress as fast as they should with Harris. Police reform will be MUCH more likely if Biden wins though.. don't fool yourself.
It might not even be that bad. If Biden wins, a more liberal congress and senate will likely follow. Universal health care will be closer to reality.. and maybe UBI will be at least discussed seriously.  If Trump wins.. holy shit.
The racist‚Äôs reaction to Joe Biden picking Senator Harris makes it clear how afraid they are of her.   They‚Äôre dumping everything they can on her (and him, of course)‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs just not working.
Wall Street executives are glad  Biden picked  Harris  "Harris, who generally could be called a centrist, will not push Biden to the left or the right on major policy issues,‚Äù  Wall Street won
Biden/Harris  -neither supports cutting the defense budget -neither supports student loan forgiveness -neither supports a wealth tax -neither supports breaking up Amazon/Facebook/Google  You‚Äôre obligated to vote for them but make sure you vote for actual progressives downballot..
Agreed. Biden really crushed any potential excitement for his campaign. Better than Trump/Pence (not saying much)
Ahead of Democratic convention, Biden leads Trump in new Wisconsin poll  via
Friendly reminder that EVEN if you don't like Biden's running mate or Biden... a vote for anyone other than him is a vote for Trump.
IMO, the only cabinet position that would be worth taking would be heading the Treasury Dept.  The rest would be a waste of Warren's talents.  If Biden isn't brave enough to make her his VP, then he definitely isn't brave enough to put her at the head of the Treasury.
The Warren supporters who are unsatisfied with Biden's VP choice because Harris isn't very progressive are signaling to Biden that he needs to move even more to the Left.   Critical tweets = signals to Biden's campaign that there is a deficit
There are 2 groups of people.  1. People who believe criticizing Biden may lead to him change the way he campaigns, making improvements, etc. "Constructive criticism helps."  2. People who believe all criticism is bad and only serves to hurt Biden and help Trump.
Biden has an enthusiasm gap problem.  He himself may not care about it and it may not matter in the end, ...but it does exist and the reason people are not enthusiastic about voting for Biden is because of the way he has run his campaign and the disdain he's shown to young voters
I like to think they (The Biden team) feel the same way you do. I think we all sort of get it. Bring on the ballsy woman of color. (I'm sure there's a better way of saying that).
Ah, we're at the stage of "If you criticize Joe Biden = You are voting for Trump!"  Please let's think/act like adults and not children. No one is perfect, especially not Biden
"Let her speak before you spend your nights helping Trump by attacking his opponents."  My god.  Did Biden's campaign destroy everyone's brain cells?  Criticism of Biden is not tantamount to supporting Donald Trump. Please think like an adult and not like a child
"He adopted some of her ideas in exchange for her support. That's politics. And Warren knows that. And she would do that because she believes in her plans more than a title."    No one is arguing that Biden adopting her plans is a bad thing, it's obviously a good thing.
Huh? Where did I say "Biden won because of Warren" ?? I said he used her donor network, because he did.   He literally did.    He had an event scheduled *today while he was announcing the VP choice*.  He used her network.  It feels gross.
I believe that to an extent-- Warren isn't a cow that can be milked to death.  She developed her grassroots network through hard work, networking, taking over a million selfies, etc., and Biden gets to reap the benefits.  She scratched his back-- Biden isn't scratching hers.
I'm sure Warren was happy to help Biden but I'm sure she was under the impression her impressive fundraising talents wouldve meant more in the veepstakes.  Seems like Harris was chosen to appease wealthy donors.  Entire thing sucks and feels gross
We are now stronger together with Biden/Harris üíôüá∫üá∏ #BidenHarris2020Landslide
No, I think Warren supporters have some legitimate grievances to feel angry about this entire thing.  Biden scheduled more events with Warren than with Harris-- why? Was it to get more campaign donations? He used Warren for her grassroots network.  It feels gross
When Trump calls something ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù bear in mind that he has an extremely limited vocabulary. If Harris had attacked Trump the way she went at Biden, Trump would certainly not have been man enough to put her on his ticket. Her ‚Äòattack‚Äô on him was factual, effective + justified.
There is no chance of her becoming Senate Majority Leader because Chuck Schumer will not give up power.  It's useless to even talk about it.  Biden used Warren supporters for campaign donations, we have a right to criticize and be angry.
I‚Äôm excited to vote for Biden / Harris 2020!!  Senator Harris, beyond all of her other accomplishments, has been a constant force for change from inside government. One cool thing she did was setup Open Justice, which increased transparency and accountab‚Ä¶
Didn‚Äôt the NRA say that about Obama/Biden and it never happened? Doesn‚Äôt seem like you know what you‚Äôre talking about.
the problem is its a markets arent always the best (yes we know) so we sit here and actually should probably vote for biden or trump will win
If you really want to freak out a Dump supporter just say that Biden will resign after a year and Kamala will be president. Watch their heads spin!
Joe Biden was baptized, confirmed, attends Mass and wasn't excommunicated therefore is he is Catholic. Given your strong pronouncement, I looked for a tweet about any of the 125 priests in your dioceses accused of pedophilia not being Catholic. Not a thing. Sad.
I wish Biden had chosen a progressive VP. Harris is a disappointing choice
üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáand miss me with your concern-trolling about Biden or Harris. If you don‚Äôt think Biden-Harris is THEE ticket THIS YEAR, then vote for Trump like you planned to all along, but don‚Äôt pretend to be progressive.
Squad'll give President Biden some extra backbone.
Joe Biden: I want all the young Americans out there who have been protesting to know, I hear you! And my choice for Vice  President will assuredly always "Defend the Police!"
‚ÄúJoe Biden and Kamala Harris represent how far America has come since defeating the Confederacy‚Äù  Joe Biden is not that old üíÄ
We will if Biden/Harris win in November. Get out and vote RED!
And I‚Äôm going to talk shit as I turn in my vote for Biden
I prefer progressive.... and you bet your ass I‚Äôm going to talk shit about Biden and Trump despite who wins!!!!! (Though, a Biden cabinet will be much much better).
The new talking point is already out. To say that it was racist to pick the VP based on race is racist because Trump is racist and anyone else is racist for not supporting Biden's racism about the race of his running mate pick...  The logic is simply dizzying. Literally.
Is there a memorable debate moment ft. Kamala Harris that doesn‚Äôt involve her calling Joe Biden a racist?
Watched Harris and Biden‚Äôs rhetoric with one another tonight on Hannity  My god what Are they thinkin About? Can it be true that the full Democratic Party endorses this Union?
Biden has my vote but my $$$ goes directly to Warren Dems from now on
For the record, I would‚Äôve liked Karen Bass to be on the ticket with Biden and the way the media (and the other VP choices) helped smear her is reprehensible
I really hope someone on Biden‚Äôs campaign is paying attention to the backlash from the VP announcement
people can have a problem with harris‚Äô past &amp; still vote for biden/harris this election. just bc they point out an issue doesn‚Äôt mean their support isn‚Äôt there. a lot of people are voting for biden BECAUSE it‚Äôs their only option.
Feels like Biden‚Äôs campaign doesn‚Äôt want support from young, minority voters.   I am disappointed with the VP choice.
Okay, so...  8/9/2020 - James "Kamala" Harris passes away. 8/11/2020 - Joe Biden announces Kamala Harris as his running mate. COINCIDENCE? Where the fuck is  ?!
Right now the odds are Biden with a 64% chance of winning, but since you're a fan of trump, I'll just bet even odds.
like people can take issue and critique the people running for office, that‚Äôs their right and it something they should do!! even if you‚Äôre voting for biden/harris you should still know their entire background and be critical of them?? that‚Äôs a normal thing to do as a voter
I suspect that Biden‚Äôs excellent choice has more to do with winning the election than with being vice president. My hunch is that Warren is the one (on his list) he works best with. She will doubtless get top cabinet post, and Harris will make a more enjoyable VP than even Pence.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have spent their careers upholding policies that disadvantage POC and immigrants when they had the opportunity to stand up for what was right.
Young democrats / liberals: stop gaslighting progressives by attempting to shame us into voting for a candidate that we‚Äôre morally opposed to. We ALL know what is at risk. We ALL know what a vote for Joe Biden means.
Old white women are probably the only coalition Biden already had locked in. Wtf are you talking about?
‚ÄúSmart, tough, and ready to lead‚Äù is how Joe Biden describes Kamala Harris.   Can you imagine Donald saying anything thing like that about a former rival?
Lol electoral priorities like... oh Biden doesn‚Äôt have any? He‚Äôs not actually about policy at all? He opposes marijuana legalization and M4A which both have sky high approval rating?
Won't lie, I was hoping for a VP Susan Rice. What a class act you are, and what a stellar public servant. I can't help but think there will be a great role for you with President Biden, as he works to try to save the world. Team America!
Harris said she believes Biden‚Äôs accuser (of sexual assault).  Both are going to have to answer for that.
just $1 mill more than Warren pulled in at a random event she did for Biden.  üò¥
Started a weekly donation to the Biden/Harris campaign. We're in the homestretch now, and we must do all we can to fight the rise of fascism in the United States.  #BidenHarris2020
Dr. Jason Johnson warns on MSNBC that young people who aren‚Äôt galvanized by Biden also wont be excited about Kamala Harris  üëã I am one of these people
i have a bad feeling joe biden is going to win üôÑ
All these Republicans in Congress calling Biden/Harris socialists need to go get refunds on their undergraduate political science degrees
Kamala Harris was chosen as Biden‚Äôs VP candidate.
Historic Photo: Biden asks Harris to be his VP
Trump actually did build a wall, and we're all paying; great new ad from Joe Biden
Biden's viral bike ride video takes everyone back to Trump's feeble descent down a ramp
Democrats laud Harris as Biden's VP pick
At least Biden/Harris will not KILL &gt;162,000 Americans like tRump/Pence &amp; the irresponsible response to #COVID19 turning it into #TrumpPandemic   America can return to a country based on what is best for the country rather than what is better for #TrumpCrimeFamily
I'll take that.  Biden will get absolutely destroyed in a debate. I'm no Trump fan but to think he'd back down from Biden is laughable.
Trump's entire re-election strategy is based on fear. Biden's is based on positive and reassuring goals. The choice is so simple between those two candidates.
not to mention the barrage of vitriol and hatred the right is likely going to unleash upon black women bc of Harris, though, that was likely inevitable with any black woman on the ticket.   The least Biden could have done is pick one who hasn't jailed hundreds of POC.
Please don‚Äôt vote for Biden... Or Trump... #VoteGold
This does, in fact, make me like Biden a bit more.  I was gonna vote for Biden anyway, tbf, but his selection of Harris at least makes me feel a bit better about it.
Treasury is really the only spot where she would be able to make *real* change but Biden is too much of a coward to ask her to run it
and much like romanticizing your ex, electing biden is a stupid mistake that won't fix anything
realizing i‚Äôm gonna have to vote for biden/harris
Biden must not have understood when he heard she did well with the poles....
It really doesn‚Äôt matter cause the winner is ether Donald Trump or Joe Biden by not voting for Joe Biden that takes away one step away from evicting trump which YOU CLEARLY WANT please just vote for Biden and tolerate him and Kamala for the next 4 years
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Biden just lost the election and a not-so-civil war seems ever-more likely after November üòî
A few Bernicrats and Warren or die folks seem to prefer death by Trump to sensible policies and leverage for democracy by Harris and Biden. Honestly, i don't think there is anything much we can do to help such purist outlier haters, we just need regular folks to vote louder.
Lastly:    If Biden isn't brave enough to make Warren his VP, he definitely isn't brave enough to make her the Treasury Secretary.  His wealthy donors would never allow it.  He'll probably try to pigeonhole her in something innocuous like the Dept of Ed.  Hopefully she says no
Giving rich people special access to our politicians is nauseating and undemocratic.  My money will only go to politicians who support a wealth tax and student debt relief, Biden/Harris support neither.    They will get my vote but they dont get my money. Hell no
I am planning to vote for Joe Biden but I won't be donating to the campaign.  There's no point.   Biden and Harris both spent a large percentage of their time during the primary tap dancing for wealthy donors at private events.  Harris hasn't pushed Biden left on anything.
Kamala Harris being chosen to run as Biden's VP is extremely disappointing.  She has flipped on several major progressive issues and is more conservative than Biden on Israel/Palestine.  I initially supported her primary campaign but realized she was not a good manager nor leader
Yep ... you've lost a lot of us ! #Biden #Trump2020Landslide #TrumpHasNoPlan
The only thing you will ever be recognized for...the death of thousands due to your "Trump Virus". #TrumpHasNoPlan #Trump2020Landslide #Biden
Biden isn‚Äôt brave enough to appoint her to that position.  He‚Äôs a coward, he‚Äôll ask if she wants to lead the Educ department or somewhere else innocuous
On a sad day for college football, Joe Biden did the right thing #BidenHarris2020Vision #GlassHalfFull
Elizabeth Warren would have been an infinitely much better VP than Kamala Harris. It‚Äôs true. That‚Äôs why Biden adopted a bunch of her plans and none of Kamala‚Äôs. ‚ÄúWarren has a plan for that!‚Äù  She‚Äôs guided by her moral compass, we need more people like that leading the country.
Please talk about what you will do to curtail your "Trump Virus". Looks like football is not happening, dude ! #Trump2020Landslide #FoxNews #Biden

It is truly exhausting in my bones to see the flurry of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget who we‚Äôre fighting‚Äù commentary. I haven‚Äôt; Biden and Harris are also the enemy. Your vote is almost meaningless. By all means, vote for them. I probably will too. /1
What's the strongest statement Biden has made about not running in 2024?
Conservatives claiming that Biden and Kamala are even more left than Bernie is laughable üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
Who cares?  Biden-Harris is going to wipe the floor with you.
Guess Biden picked the right one.
Biden knows corn pop and Kamala‚Äôs a cop.
Joe Biden adopted 4-5 plans from Warren‚Äôs primary campaign and literally zero from Kamala Harris‚Äôs campaign.    I suppose we should be thankful.
A no vote for Biden Harris is a vote for trump
Not quite sure that the decision tells us this. I think Biden might think that Harris will work well as a defense against the left (and the protest movement) in a way that the various midwestern white women he considered would not.
Biden adopted 4-5 of Warren‚Äôs policies and literally zero from Kamala Harris.  This stinks
Biden is problematic, yes. But I would vote for a literal brick to get t-rump out. This upcoming election is about peoples survival. An old potato is better than a poisonous cheeto.
One last thing to be clear, Biden and Harris, is a way, WAAYY better choice than Trump, I'm just disappointed that the policies don't match 100% to what I believe will bring real tangible change for the people who need it the most.
Trump ends his press conference with the false claims Kamala Harris and the Democrats want to ‚Äútake away for second amendment.‚Äù Before reporters can counter, he ends the presser and bolts away. #Trump #Biden #BidenHarris2020
For the most part, it's fine. She's definitely more progressive leaning and can read the room better than Biden. But at the same time, I have reservations for some aspects of her, including that she was a cop.
Doesn‚Äôt change any math for me. I don‚Äôt like her but I don‚Äôt like Biden either.
I‚Äôm going to donate $500 to Warren Dems because Biden was never going to go as far Left as I‚Äôd want him and the only chance of having a wealth tax or student debt relief is by helping elect more ****progressive**** Dems.
Okay, my response is two questions: where do you think we are in America right now (in terms of being set back or pushed forward), and what is a Biden administration pushing us backward?
What do I think about Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as his running mate? #KamalaHarrisForVP #KamalaHarris #DemExit
He says we'll have to learn Chinese if Biden wins. But its not like we started to learn Russian 3 and a half years ago.
I am stoked, I expected Harris but then again Biden is old and white so there was some uncertainty. He made the right move, hopefully it brings out the young vote once they get to know her!
I'm so excited about the Biden/Harris ticket.  looking forward to working to get you elected! #BidenHarris2020 #Shero
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has selected Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.   Here are some facts about the senator from California.
Bernie, go back into the darkness where you've been. Those things that she would do or dangerous for this country. And you really think that Biden is going to win? Trump will wipe the floor with him in debates.
I'm sure Trump Kampf is elated by Biden's choice of the DNC's donor base-approved Kamala Harris for VP. They're betting America is still racist and sexist enough it'll pull enough points away from the Biden ticket that they win. So much depends on America being better than that.
Biden website is seriously overloaded, hard to use, but I managed to order a Tshirt and bumper stickers. #BidenHarris2020
Don‚Äôt care what she said to Biden. I care about her intent to destroy a Supreme Court justice nominee.
Yes, voting for Biden
Congratulations Biden/Harris Ticket woot woot
Who cares?  We'll be watching Biden/Harris coverage.
To do all the work for Biden/Harris? Nah
I feel like that's Biden 2020's basic message.
Congratulations, Senator Harris. Biden-Harris 2020!!!
Wouldnt it be funny if Biden ran for re-election
It is a shame that she can't also stand in for Biden and debate Trump.  That would be a fun one!
lol, Biden is creepy yes, but none of the accounts are RAPE like what  is accused of. I will take a hair sniffer over a rapist any day.
I am proud to support Biden/Harris2020 100%!
Text United to 30330 join Joe Biden and the app Slack to keep up to date or join his campaign
Welp. Not voting for Biden now. Crap. The one person on his list that would disqualify him from my vote...
Nah, the winning play is to have Kanye debate Biden.
Biden picks Kamala Harris for VP
Bigggest thing is Biden will never last as a President. His mental deficiencies will assure whomever is VP, will wind up President and shes not presidential material.
She handed us Steve Mnuchin. What a horrible pick, it's like Biden wants to lose.
It‚Äôs the truth. Biden is the one who said it
Sen. Kamala Harris Is Joe Biden‚Äôs VP Pick
She‚Äôs really good in front of cameras IMO, which is SUPER important when  Biden is on the ticket.
You are so afraid...Biden/Harris is going to help heal our country. I feel better already!I know, Hillary is offering to help in a Biden/Harris ticket, and I‚Äôm thinking that you can‚Äôt help if you are at Gitmo, can you?
That‚Äôs why we need Biden and Harris.
Biden‚Äôs pick of Kamala Harris is the last nail in the coffin for his presidential aspirations. We cannot allow a blind lead the deaf in America which has finally risen to be the true super power of this world. This country needs you for four more years to finish the job.
What were you planning to do if Biden won?
How do you know?  Obama didn‚Äôt immediately end the war in Iraq and never closed Guantanamo Bay. Why will Biden be different after Trump?
I do not disagree&amp; I am super disillusioned about Biden. This Will be the 1st time I will throw up in my mouth a little bit when I vote. I had no particular opinion until after 2016 cuz I wasn't political. I'm mainly voted democratic &amp;pretty much Didn't pay attention Past that. 1
I‚Äôm thinking if Biden is elected COVID-19 will just go away . Everyone will be happy üòÉ back to normal ?
And why did Biden say to wear masks for next 3 months? Don‚Äôt need to wear masks after Nov 3rd??? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Writing copy for the GOP is easy: first write the truth, then do a word find-replace to change every ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù to ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù and every ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù to ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù.
He's a Biden troll, probably puppeted by Dr. Johnson.
Yes, this is more of the pre-explanation for Biden's defeat.
This isn't wrong. It's probably the biggest reason that Joe Biden is going to lose in November. Health insurance is a completely useless system. #MedicareForAll is a sensible compromise.  Biden supports making insurance execs richer with bigger ACA subsidies. How will that help?
He's vote shaming people for not supporting Biden now, isn't he? I know Cusack bullies anti-Russiagaters.
Why is he still attacking Bernie now that Biden is the nominee and Bernie has endorsed him? Is he trying to help Trump win?
I agree. Expecting Joe Biden to suddenly surrender to the protesters or strikers is... na√Øve.
The way I see it is that Biden is causing less emissions than Trump and that Biden has the strength to keep pushing.
Kamala only said she believed those women who said Biden's touching made them uncomfortable. None of them accused Biden of sexual abuse except for the discredited Tara Reade.  Kamala  never said she believed Reade.
This isn‚Äôt about who you personally like. This is about saving the rule of law and preventing fascism. Vote Biden now to secure your right to vote in future elections, because Trump is blatantly attacking this right.
She and Biden are the mass incarceration ticket. #ChainsYouCanBelieve in should be their campaign slogan.
But I'm not voting Biden/Harris
With the announcement of the Biden-Harris ticket, I‚Äôm more convinced than ever that we need a well organized and coordinated #GeneralStrike.   #ChainsYouCanBelieveIn
Why do the Biden Dems look and sound like Reagan Republicans? Even the ‚Äúbig tent‚Äù is a Reagan line.
We already know what we have with Trump. 4 more years of this is gonna be catastrophic. Biden isn't the best but abstaining from voting or not voting for Biden/Harris guarantees our demise. A lot of us see voting for Biden/Harris as taking an L...we need to think long game.
Vote for Biden, lower your expectations, and start listening to POC.
Is he helping pay for Biden campaign staff???ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§®ü§®ü§®. If not fuck him
Trump calls Biden's coronavirus plan unscientific, rejects call for national mask mandate
Trump calls Biden's coronavirus plan unscientific, rejects call for national mask mandate
Using that same logic, a vote for third party is a vote for Trump. A vote for third party is a vote for Biden. As a #VoteGreen‚Äôr, my argument is... a vote for Trump is a vote for Biden. A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. #VoteGreen
You can‚Äôt tell anyone who thinks Biden is ‚Äúcenter left‚Äù anything.
#UnitedLeft is explicitly anti-Biden.
Hardly. It will collapse if Biden doesn‚Äôt win.
Isn't Wisconsin a bit cash-strapped right now because of the virus which you refuse to do anything about? You were one of the first to cry Russia hoax. and yet look where you are getting your information from now, so is this now the Biden hoax?
Yup the dnc made a horrible mistake appointing biden thinking it was safe then told him to take harris who has a horrible track record prosecuting young black males, also many democrats are gun owners and both are very anti-firearms
What a joke Biden is.
Not the proper role of a President, Biden is a fool.
Proof that Biden has no idea of what a President does.
Biden won't solve these problems.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Bingo! Joe Biden showed he understands real politics and does not bear personal grudges. In short, Biden is a grownup.
It also shows how badly out of touch Dem leadership is, in nominating Joe Biden during a plague and then pushing him to take Kamala Harris as his running mate during an anti-cop uprising.
Imagine a real leader. No need to imagine. Joe Biden is that leader.
Biden said he would pick a woman. He didn't qualify that with Black or white.
So good of you to campaign for Biden-Harris against your party.
Beto is 100% for Joe Biden. And Beto is a current and future star in the Democratic Party.
My stepson spent more of his life behind bars than out because of Joe Biden. He's a fascist who is the reason schools are still segregated and so many people are in prison for non-violent crime.
I think we should mix it up this year and have Kamala debate Trump and Biden debate Pence.
How will Biden and Harris take us to the middle? They're nearly as right as Trump.  Teach kids how to be grifters and thieves? Yes, I'm against that.
And Trump is hated by a majority of America because he actually committed real crimes, unlike your weird Biden conspiracies.
You don't appear to have any perspective.  What positive direction do you think Biden and Harris are moving in?  They remind me of Trump, honestly, and your platitude filled support for them reminds me of MAGA.  Congrats #BlueMaga.
Very plausible, though of course Biden actually wants to be tougher on Venezuela than Trump. Or so he claims.
How, exactly, are Biden and Harris "on the side of the people?"  They're on the side of the private prison contractors, the MIC, and Big Tech. None of those special interests are "the people."
I have no idea whether Joe knows he's lying or not, but it doesn't matter. The danger to this country are Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and the socialist mob they represent. Let's take the masks off, figuratively and literally, and keep America in the hands for Americans!
That's exactly why I don't have any faith in the Biden/Harris ticket. It's a Dem platform that ignores the reality of the world post-covid.
Suburban woman here.  Voting for Biden/Harris 2020!
Yeah, these idiots love to try and put everyone in a neat little box and assume that if you criticize Biden, you HAVE to be a Trump voter. They've successfully turned me into a Trump voter even though I've voted Libertarian for the last 2 elections.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
So  you should really meet with  again. Make another #MedicareForAll commercial to get people to vote for Biden!  Then tell us you're against it when you're VP!
What  is calling the "center left position that Biden and white moderates have come around to" is giving the damned cops more money to kill people.  So yes, now is the time to attack Kamala and Biden on their horrific records and policies in this area.
How is that different from letting Biden kill our kids to "get rid of Trump?"
You mean Biden, the serial pawer?
Politicians are going to always do what they think they need to do to keep their positions secure, whether we as voters like it or not.  Is Benjamin Dixon actually "embracing Biden?"  We should be making it clear to Biden he can't win without us.
Honest answer. Biden is going to win, dems will get to at least 50 in the senate and the house will hold or expand. We don't give two shits what "half" of the country thinks. You people have helped this animal bring the country to its knees.
Whether Kamala Harris was my 1st choice or not, she is who is on the Biden ticket now and anybody- even Tulsi Gabbard- would be better than the tRump ticket! Even if there was no one in the VP position that'd be better than the current guy!
Awesome! I look forward to listening! I hope you speak less to us about why we should vote Biden, and more to Biden about how he can earn our vote. You are the strongest voice for change in the whole line up!
You're a segregationist apologist too. That's why you're defending Biden. It all makes sense now.
Biden/Harris 2020: we will keep dropping bombs and killing other people's kids!  H/t
You appear to be trying to unite everyone arod voting for Biden but haven't been able to offer a compelling argument for why we should or satisfactorily answer questions about your motives. You appear to be trying to divide us, in fact. We are all united. Join us?
So you have decided to unite us all by supporting Biden so we all turn on you?
So you're making the divisive stupidity worse by telling people to vote for Biden? That's stupid and divisive.  How is Biden not fascist?
Biden wants MORE of all those things.
Yes. So stop apologizing for Biden and telling us to embrace a fascist. Join the Left and help organize it instead of attacking it.  Voting for Biden is "what we have done" that hasn't worked. Repeated once more.
Biden said he would be tougher on protesters in Portland than Trump. You support that shit?  What do you think we're protesting in Portland?  Essentially, it's Biden and Kamala. Trump is just a symptom of their disease.
You're acting as if embracing Biden is somehow an improvement over the current circumstances. It isn't.
Why do you think Biden won't use live rounds?
I don‚Äôt have a problem. We need Biden Harris to win!
Check out Nate Silver's feed. Biden's numbers are softer than Hillary's. The Dems are in massive denial.
Life matters.
All lifes matter.
Dr. Glaude is not usually a shill. He‚Äôs one of many people who realizes te Dems could have done better than Biden, imo.
This morning on  I was very pleased to see  say clearly that Biden needs to be pushed to deliver specific policy solutions.  People are starting to speak up about the need for the Biden/Harris ticket to be more responsive to the Dem base.
Would be more important for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to start meeting with him regularly and listening to what he has to say.   Yes? ü§î
I'm a progressive and I am NOT voting for Biden and Kamala.  Pass it on. #GreenParty
I think the  is a damn great idea and a positive as I‚Äôm Progressive/Green/the democratic wing of the Democratic Party but I‚Äôm voting Biden to get Trump out. Progressives and left as possible down ballot and build leftist alternative parties to contest soon!
It‚Äôs time to grow the Green Party as much as possible yet I‚Äôm reluctantly voting Biden to get Trumps ass out. Damn I wish it was Sanders Warren or Vice versa ticket but down ballot and otherwise progressive as possible and Green if they have a chance
People say ‚ÄúI‚Äôd run through a bunch of murder hornets to vote for Biden‚Äù but I‚Äôm not seeing y‚Äôall actually be this dedicated about Biden cause. I did see people pour all their energy into calling people and going out to get people to vote for Bernie. Where‚Äôs that devotion? ü§î
Just a quick moment to let my mutuals know that I may be critical of biden/Harris but that does not mean in any way that I am voting for the hobgoblin in office, nor that I disagree with getting Dems back in office.  They just have a lot to prove to me and I hope they do so
amazing segment on Camarla Harris.. when u got to the Biden part, u &amp; I both erupted in laughter at exact same time and exact same fashion. I literally died.. I needed to be revived..
Because Biden is more conservative and authoritarian like a normal republican candidate. Come on dude u should know that
I‚Äôm voting for Biden no doubt and a progressive.  Still want some better legislation and more ambitious agenda than what I‚Äôve seen and heard put forth.  They‚Äôre gonna have to whittle it down in Congress so aim high and settle a bit later
Im going to vote for Biden/Harris no matter what but having her clarify her intentions would go a long way for the confidence of many!
Biden was supposed to have already done that.
I can't find anything referencing how you feel abt Biden's VP pick. I can see where you wouldve mixed emotions. In another time &amp; place you probably would have been chosen or at very least in top 2. I'm waiting to hear what administrative position he asks you to be in.
Also, don't flatter yourself.  The only thing I'm mad about is the general stupidity and futility of a "never-biden/never-trump" paradigm.
is a fucking liar, referring to him not knowing about Kanye Wests intention of stealing Biden votes.   They cooked this shit up and it will backfire on the  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteByMail2020
Are you sure she didn't mean Trump? Is she predicting violence against Biden?
The parts Biden wrote into law?
I still say John Kasich shouldn‚Äôt be there at all. There‚Äôs no legitimate reason. The #NeverTrump crowd practically nominated Biden.  Why does the strongest candidate to beat Trump need Kasich? ü§î
Okay I got to give props to Sarah Palin for this one.... Credit where credit is due..
CNN firmly in Biden camp
Nice to know!! Biden can‚Äôt tell the difference between the toilet or a shower. Let that sink in! No worries, Biden can‚Äôt find the sink so you‚Äôre safe.üòÇü§™
Do you think this is helping?? Does Trump??  This could be a Campaign Ad for Biden ffs
It's a cyclical problem. Biden won't make enough waves to drive up his negatives so Trump is forced to make news conferences, reenforcing his "show" reputation and keeping negatives high.
Biden introduces Harris, campaigning together for the first time in Delaware.
Oh, I know. Biden can't just bring it back, though.
Oh girl I'm done giving that foolery my energy. After Biden announced Sen. Harris as his running mate I feel like the elephant named Trump has been lifted. Baby girl I'm so happy I'm floating. I'm hopeful again and that's dangerous. I'm ready to vote yesterday.
Thank you  for not showing the mango madman showing more hatred and lies. It's a nice change. And thank you for airing the Biden and Harris speaches.
I‚Äôm not disaffiliated.  I‚Äôm very much a conservative which is why I don‚Äôt like either of the choices.  Many conservative pundits have said they will vote for Biden to get rid of Trump and I sympathize with that.
There was a poll in the news very recently said 60% of people think Biden won‚Äôt complete his first term.  Probably in all major papers‚ÄîI don‚Äôt recall where I saw it.
Vote trump out if you can't vote Biden in.
Assuming u don't want trumpass in office anthr 4 years, why bash our only hope to end his reign of terror? If we don't end this, your chance of evr gettng a 3rd party in office goes out the door. Biden isn't the perfect choice, but he's our only hope.
You missed the most important part though.  There's actually no difference. Both Trump and Biden want to give the police more money, more manpower, and more military equipment.  Ignorant.
Dude, when you can tell me the difference between Biden's police reform plan and Trump's, you can talk down to me.
Okay, it was the second worst.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.
Even more, you don't PRE-compromise your positions BEFORE the fight starts. Biden is pre-compromised.
WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris make first public appearance as White House running mates.
Sorry, I tend to do that to Biden Bros.
I'm extremely happy about Biden's VP pick  #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris
The Biden-Harris exchanges when Joe calls Kamala to 'ask' her the big question are as priceless as they are beautiful.
Notice he's not promising anything for Biden, just throwing the true charge at Trump.
WaPo will say and print anything to help Biden. Zero ethics.
Sounds like Joe Biden's plan.
That's exactly how I feel about it. Especially when they're using rallying cries like "people are dying."  Biden doesn't care and  should know it.
The earth will just move on to the next stage of evolution. We will all be dead, of course, unless you convince Biden to do something about it.
To quote the philosopher Carlin, "The world will be fine. The people are f*cked, but the world will be fine."  Get on Biden to save them.
Just say No to Joe Biden in 2020 if you want the USA to go Great again just say NO to Joe.

In order to enact the kind of change the radical left wants to see, and indeed I think many agree, we must have people who are open to being radicalized. Do I think that Biden or Harris are those people? Not necessarily.
Why We Need Blue: A Thread   I understand the frustration as someone who is not appeased by either party, and has not been in quite some time. I was not happy with the Clinton choice, and I am not happy with the Biden choice. HOWEVER
You do know the photo of Biden "hiding" was a photoshopped image. He was attending a football viewing party in Iowa with numerous people and press in attendance.
In the case of Biden, most people think he won‚Äôt make it all the way through his term so VP choice matters more than usual.  It sounds like you‚Äôre hypothesizing that a negligible # of voters are changeable.  Even it‚Äôs a small number, I doubt it‚Äôs negligible.
Joe Biden picked someone who could have been running mate any day of the week who just happens to be a woman of color. I am not going to celebrate until they win. I celebrated in 2016 and ended up heart broken. She can't make history without our help.
Exactly! She will challenge Biden when necessary and is ready to take the reins if needed. This is what we should expect in a VP, not the spineless sycophancy we have in Pence.
I can understand that. Completely. Biden is old.
We have that coming Biden/Harris!
I know at least one person who justifies voting for Biden because she feels more likely to survive his presidency. She bases this in her experience organizing under Trump versus organizing under Obama.  It doesn't appear to be hyperbole. I can back  up here.
This is you applying your personal logic which would cause you to predict Biden gets 100% of the vote.  You will be wrong.  There are always voters at the margin and Harris is not helpful to Biden at pulling those voters towards him.  That‚Äôs not smart for Biden.
Exactly what is foremost in my mind right now. Biden can‚Äôt do that.
Biden has that thing you call self esteem. It comes in that package of character that most of us are handed when we are born and is included in the daily values that our parents feed us as a child.
If she helps move the coming administration 10-20 more progressive, I‚Äôd consider volunteering for them but it‚Äôs Biden and Harris and their in it to get moderates and undecideds not as interested in the long term of the country in my opinion.  Still got my vote though
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! I'm 100% behind you &amp; Joe Biden, what an AWESOME TEAM. Trump is about to experience "You're FIRED!"
Moderately.  She‚Äôs very solid and the perfect attack so Biden can play above the fray and the ‚Äúadult‚Äù and good guy.  Wanted someone with better policies and ideas (Warren) but Harris is cool
I think he‚Äôs saying it was a poor choice from Biden‚Äôs perspective.  I was considering voting Biden but Harris makes him less palatable to me.  I‚Äôm more likely to abstain now.  Hard to vote for a ticket with such a poor character as VP.
I think Karen Bass might‚Äôve been more palatable to cross-over voters.  Harris mainly pleases people who are going to vote for Biden no matter what.  She‚Äôs like Trump in that she has no concept of the limits of presidential power.  I also think she will be vulnerable in 2024.
Eyuck! Biden doesn't even have a decent coat of paint.
The Trump campaign has struggled to define Biden and Harris, trying to portray them as far-left socialists -- a claim that's ridiculous to actual socialists.  via   So Trump thinks that both Biden and Harris hate america! Just like Trump/Pence!
Every Trump supporter on Twitter upon learning Kamala named Biden's running mate.
If you really want to understand what we have in front of us, read Caste: The Origin of Our Discontents by  . There's a lot of work ahead to deconstruct the system of caste and Biden/Harris are the ones to get us started.
Privileged entourage vote for Biden, privileged enough not to care.
Twitter all in for Jie Biden
Wont support anything that hate monger has her name on just like id never support joe biden or anyone who supports him due to his decades of racism and hate
The top difference between you and her... she didn't have to be blackmailed to become a Biden supporter.
I‚Äôm really looking forward to this myself. Biden has always wanted the President to have the powers Trump is now using.
It‚Äôs a sign of character that Joe Biden picked the black woman who so publicly called him out on his problematic comments.   She called him out. He called her in.
Game over for Trump. Biden by chosing Kamala has assured a strong democratic base turnout and that was Trumps only hope to find a way to turn back the blue tsunami coming this November
I recall us making a wager in 2018 regarding Harris being chosen by Biden if he were to win the nomination. I said that if I were wrong I would put a Trump photo on Twitter. You said Biden wouldn‚Äôt and if he did you would post photo of you kissing your own ass :)
I‚Äôve been arguing that Harris‚Äô callout during that debate was a point in her favor. Biden needs people who will call him on bullshit, not people who only know how to kiss ass.
If Trump is still flailing by Election Day, I think a significant number of his supporters will stay home rather than risk voting.   Biden supporters will crawl through glass even if he is ahead by 20.
Harris is a Black woman who explicitly supports prison slavery.  Joe Biden is a white man whose greatest political achievement made prison slavery a huge business.  Yes, it‚Äôs a pro-slavery ticket. Any questions?
Trump thinks Biden picking Harris is a sign of weakness.
Dear Dr. Biden:  I am so excited to vote for your husband.  The last three and one half years have been difficult and working in public education and I have seen so many changes .  We need change and we look forward to your husband being elected.
Yes, I do still think we won‚Äôt be driven into a communist country under Biden.  You need to work on word definitions; here‚Äôs a good start -  Communism is a political/economic system, a classless society which the major means of production, are owned and controlled by the public.
Cheaters, Biden family gets rich at serving country.
It‚Äôs going to be hard for the Putin/Trump campaign to persuade Leftists that Harris is a neo-liberal shill while also telling the Trump base that she is the Marxist controller for Joe Biden.   Especially if we keep highlighting the contradiction.
In a classic moment of sentimentality temporarily eclipsing voting priorities... I was considerably more excited when I heard Kamala Harris had Church of God roots than I was earlier today, when I heard she was Biden's pick for VP nom. Still, a solid choice.
Enough with being cautious.   Biden/Harris will win.

Trump, you are disrespectful to women, veterans, the disabled, people of color, health experts, healthcare workers, journalists, as well as ignorant of the Constitution and history. Go to hell!
Is it wrong for me to say I think I like her more than Biden? Congrats Sen. Harris. Give 'em hell, and make me proud of my original home state. #KamalaHarrisForVP
She doesn‚Äôt stand against the people who stand against #BlackLivesMatter. She stands with the cops against the working class, like Biden and Trump.
Exactly. I understand people who feel like they have to vote against Trump. That‚Äôs a sane reaction. I would think about it if I were in a swing state.  I don‚Äôt understand people who swear Biden will be progressive.
It‚Äôs not progressive without #MedicareForAll. That‚Äôs the bare minimum and Biden couldn‚Äôt do that.  What do you find progressive in it?
Biden is a servant of the oligarchy establishment, so picking Harris was not a surprise, and predictable. If he wasn't such a blabbermouth fuck up when it comes to race, he probably would've picked military-contractor-defending Elizabeth Warren.
Do you think Biden knows what that website says?
We‚Äôre absolutely on the same page. A friend of mine actually changed her mind about holding her nose and voting for Biden over this.  It feels unwise of him in the midst of a pro-abolition uprising.
Biden was one of the authors of the original, 1990s, version of the PATRIOT Act that anti-Clinton Repubs opposed because Clinton was President. They passed it for Bush after 9/11 though.  Trump‚Äôs ICE and military abuses in the US are legal because of the PATRIOT Act.

I hope Biden didn't make this selection just for the black woman demographic. Sen. Harris is smart, tough, compassionate. And will be an excellent VP.

Don't think I was attacking you personally? I don't appreciate being called an idiot. I think Harris treated Biden like crap during debate. I thought Rice was much better candidate.
I've said all along I want Kamala but understood Joe Biden gets to pick and I will support his choice no matter who. I do not understand sour grapes politics. Winning requires unity; governance requires compromise, damnit!

I honestly am not a big fan of Kamala Harris...I get the feeling that she does a lot of pandering and grandstanding.  I haven't quite gotten genuine policies from her.  But ill be DAMED if that deters me from voting for her.  Let's hope Biden/Harris gives the ppl what we need.

The DNC doesn‚Äôt vote. Voters picked Biden. That is how we do things in a democracy.
Your being stuck on the idea that Bernie could not lose fair and square makes you as rigid as Trump‚Äôs base. Take a deep breath and snap out of it. Bernie has endorsed Biden.
Biden isn‚Äôt ‚Äútrash.‚Äù It is essential that Trump be dethroned, wouldn‚Äôt you agree? How can that happen? One way: we have to elect Biden. Fortunately, within the realm of real possibility, he‚Äôs not a bad pick. He can bring us back from the abyss.

Man everyone warming up to Biden as the "harmless uncle" of Obama because he wasn't Dick Cheney really did a number on some people's brains.
No you aren't. Trump trailing Biden in ALL swing states even Florida &amp; TX. 96% of what?
Yay. Vote Biden-Harris 2020. An entire press conference without even 1 lie. Trump lies all the time. He is stupid &amp; lazy.
Tears of joy may prevent the onset of Alzheimer‚Äôs- from the halfsheimer‚Äôs Biden is fighting already.
Im going to vote for Biden/Harris no matter what but having her clarify her intentions would go a long way for the confidence of many!
Whew. That Biden is now receiving daily intel briefings makes me feel better. Let‚Äôs hope Biden gets the real reports and not the Big Book variety tRump receives.
That doesn‚Äôt mean they are campaigning with her. It means they felt she was the better option at the time. Between the two of them Biden is the better option now, outside of third parties. I don‚Äôt deny reality, and the reality is Kamala Harris is NOT progressive.
This is a very well-written and well-reasoned piece.  Kamala Harris, Gen X‚Äôs Moment, and the Fall of House Boomer  via
Proclaiming we need to get Biden elected, because Trump is a danger to this country, and lying out your ass and saying  is progressive are two completely different things. I know  knows better than this.
You have some out there beliefs. There is no 3rd party. If you don't vote for Biden than you are voting for Donald Trump. What is your problem with Sen Harris?
At least she and Biden can speak in complete sentences
"The #RepublicanParty ‚Äî whose best idea to deal with its deficit among minority voters is promoting the sad candidacy of Kanye West to divert a few Black votes from Biden ‚Äî is only becoming more insular and resentful."
Hang in there. After Biden wins &amp; turns things around &amp; you will find most will never admit to being a MAGAt.
Biden has had 3x the lead Obama had over McCain pretty much the entire time.
"You remember Kamala Harris. She‚Äôs the one who, as California‚Äôs Attorney General, held back exculpatory evidence about a chap on death row in order to burnish her ‚Äòtough on crime‚Äô image."
Like what I pointed out, I am not a big fan of her, but that does not take away her qualification. She is smart &amp; capable of doing the job, she just was not selected b/c Kamala Harris happens to be a better choice for Joe Biden. Let's focus on giving the same choice to our ppl
I just think it's funny that despite the fact that West...  - is certifiably mentally ill and needs help - wears a #maga hat - openly supports Trump  ...the fact that he's Black was somehow enough to make them think that voters would switch from Biden.
Ok yes Biden is a creep and Kamala is a cop but if you think capitalist centrists are just as bad as openly racist, sexist, xenophobic FASCISTS then I literally don‚Äôt know where your head is at. Politics is a game and these equivocations are going to ruin the left‚Äôs chances
Just listened to Klobuchar and after 30secs of her droning voice, now undertsand why she wasn‚Äôt selected by the DNC - boring monotone. Nice lady who screwed up early on with cop cases - she claims to be close with Kamala - who b/c of Biden, will have lots of friends for 90 days.
Biden Harris is more a moderate conservative ticket than a liberal one, which is unacceptable to many.  However-  The current appointee in charge of USPS is removing mail sorting machines across the country. Not voting is not a solution.   #BidenHarris2020
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! I'm 100% behind you &amp; Joe Biden, what an AWESOME TEAM. Trump is about to experience "You're FIRED!"
biden the republican using black people as mascots vote blue no matter who though
This foo said ‚Äújoe Biden has a racism problem‚Äù üíÄ
Biden/Harris gets my vote! ‚òëÔ∏è
Anyone mad at Harris for accepting the VP nom Bc she and Biden got into it during the debates is completely missing the point. What‚Äôs she supposed to do, ignore him and not step into this role where she has a chance to improve things?
Turnout will be historic trump will lose by double digits Biden/Harris will garner 97 percent of the black vote and the Asian vote will move from 67 percent to close to 80 percent.The cake is baked.
To these guys, Biden is:  - Demented - Radical/commie - Unable to speak clearly - Stuck in his basement  All things that are SUPER easy to dispel or are just ridiculously low bars to clear.  Trump's messaging is poor.
Joe Biden: "probably the best sort of pizza is a cream cheese pizze"  get the fuck outta here Joe
I mean yeah that's the thing, Harris is about as left as I think Biden was likely to pick and people who say otherwise are deluding themselves.
It's true though! The most famous thing about Biden before Obama picked him was how he shamelessly ripped off a Welsh politician's speech and backstory even though it didn't even fit his own background.
It may not really signify anything more than the fact that Biden is self-aware enough to know that as a man in his 70s he may literally not survive four years as President.  But Harris is still an unusually well vetted pick.
All I'm going to say about Kamala is I'm actually surprised Biden didn't just pick an empty suit for VP considering that's what most candidates due (including, let's be honest, Obama).
You knew that was coming as soon as the announcement was made. If the Biden campaign was smart, they should‚Äôve waited until after his 5pm est campaign conference started then make the announcement so it throws his nonsense off kilter.
I donated to her campaign and I‚Äôm getting out the check book and sending in another check for Biden Harris 2020 #JoeBiden2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP
I just count on a Biden/Harris admin putting competent cabinet level people in place, not to mention any judicial positions.
Biden keeps makin' me not want to vote. Amazing.
honestly better tv than Biden and trump üòÇ
am I wrong?  Seems like Biden maybe asleep at the wheel here.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate! Biden-Harris 2020 here we come!
I don't think a lot of people here is going to understand the repercussions of selecting Kamala Harris as the VP... someone who didn't poll well at all (single digit polling before dropping out). Biden's best chance at beating Trump laid outside of the DNC contenders.
Well since she‚Äôs libertarian id assume you‚Äôd vote republican but the point is any third party vote goes towards trump‚Äôs re-election b/c if you don‚Äôt want to vote for him and don‚Äôt vote for biden you‚Äôre helping him anyway
Big Poll Numbers For Joe Biden!
$50 says Trump makes some sort of remark about Biden‚Äôs VP not being attractive enough to represent the country.
To be fair, this is what we SHOULD do.  Joe Biden was always more likely to get the Dem nod.  This is a winner-take-all system, so closer to the center often wins.  But there are lots of progressive activists that will be part of the coalition.  Elect Biden, then get to work.
That's because you're not voting for Biden which means you ain't blacküòÅ
Remembering when I worried about POTUS withholding aid to Ukraine until they dished dirt on Biden.
Biden could pick my cat who is routinely outsmarted by his own tail and has a catnip addiction, and I would vote for him.
Maybe someone should remind the media that he has had to have brain surgery on both sides of this brain and obviously it had lasting effects. Joe Biden needs to have some sort of testing done before the election. #JoeBiden #BidenCognitiveDecline #donalddump #trump2020
Are you confusing Biden with Bernie??? That‚Äôs a Bernie image.
DC will burn down! It‚Äôs going to be bad but worse overall for the country if Biden wins.
Another thing on Biden‚Äôs To-do list!
I will still vote for Biden it he selects Baily Sen. Warren's dog. üòÉ
I don‚Äôt think Trump is going to beat Biden at this point, but his mental health is obviously a concern.
Where in the picture did Biden touch you?
Where have they been for the four years? Biden was doing a great  job on himself by himself - now he‚Äôs been corraled, bipartially muted, and sedated, but they sent his lookalike out on  a bike!!??
This isn't to say Dukakis didn't blow a lead...but he didn't blow a 17-point lead.  He blew like a 5-point lead.  Also, Dukakis was a doofus.  Biden is not.  And Bush was not Trump :)
As usual trump has attempted to pull the curtains over his EO! Absolutely outrageous! We need to kick him out of office with a resounding vote for Biden!
And why, Queen Nancy, should I give a scat about what China wants? Look around you, the world is masked thanks to them. China wanting Biden is a ‚Äòkiss of death‚Äô to his candidacy. ‚ÄòMember, your ice cream is not made in China, but your mask is.

This seems to be part of Trump‚Äôs re-election plan. He is trying to make Biden out to be a radical leftist. It‚Äôs not going to work, most people know Biden‚Äôs record and what he wants to do.
Pay to play Biden.  No thanks. Switched to Republican,  voting Trump for my first time. Democrats are liars and cheats
Yep, and now Trump is doing the same. I also don‚Äôt have high hopes for the Biden administration.
Declassify the intellegence about Russia's interference in 2020 election now. We have a right to know what is going on. Sen Johnson's fake investigation into the Biden's needs to be translated from the original Russian from whence it came. Are u willing to sell out US for power?
Biden says some ofbthe most racist crap in the open and on live TV. This is the Mayor of Baltimore's reaction.   President Trump says "colored paper" and this same mayor would lose it.

That is one heckuva long dock. Hope the island is worth the walk. Maybe that‚Äôs where Biden is staying?
Going to Mass on Sunday and accepting communion does not a Catholic or Christian make. If a role model, you do not accept abortion or allow persecution of fellow Christians or decry religious traditions or tolerate injustice or profit from deceit or manipulate sinful acts. Biden!
Agreed. Frankly I am tired of all the attention to these rumors. I trust Joe Biden to make his own choice. It's personal he needs &amp; deserves to take however much time he needs. We already know he expects to choose a woman &amp; that's enough for me. Plus he will have a diverse cabnt.
Tell her if Biden gets elected maybe they can finally impeach Hilary. Hahaha.
They are going to push so hard for regime change in Venezuela if Biden wins.
Please take Biden‚Äôs place and run for President Andrew!  Yang gang can get it done. Joe can‚Äôt

You can trust the polls as much as you can the media.
Anyone waiting for a candidate to beg...it ain't gonna happen. Isn't stopping fascism enough??!! That's among the billion or so reasons to be Ridin with Biden
"The problem with all of this talk about Biden and faith is that he professes to be a Roman Catholic. A Roman Catholic who just a week ago was proudly mentioning an endorsement from an abortion-rights organization."
Now hopefully these gamers will vote Biden

Biden said he didn‚Äôt want his kids growing up in a racial jungle
My trump follower landlord came by to fix our frig. I turned on MSNBC. Trump says Joe Biden is against God. I started laughing. He said all campaigns seasons are weird but this one is particularly weird. He went on to tell me that he voted for tRump &amp; he is an ass. But I like
If you Google "images of Joe Biden praying" you'll see many different images of a man humbling himself before God - lost in deep in prayer.  See what you get if you Google the same thing for Trump.
So you‚Äôre saying Biden has a chance to change the constitution, something you haven‚Äôt been able to do? Sounds like he‚Äôd be a powerful leader then.You and jo biden need to go away.

It‚Äôs ok to hate him, and still vote for him. It‚Äôs people who vote for Biden out of spite that puzzle me.

I could see Biden doing 8 years and then Harris doing another 8 years
Biden and Harris are news.  Trump is not.
Harris and Biden are both low grade archons.
Limiting AOC speaking time is about limiting Republican attack point that Biden will be a patsy for the ‚Äúfar left, socialist Democrats.‚Äù This is about cutting the attack off at the pass.

I‚Äôm also a career woman living in the suburbs and am ecstatic about voting for the Biden/Harris ticket. I can‚Äôt wait to boot this racist out of office!
Yes- vote Biden/Harris
this you?
The only hesitation I had about Kamala Harris as VP is that I think she is better than that job will allow her to be and she won't be happy in it. But if Biden gives her a consequential role then maybe it will prepare her and the country for her as POTUS in '24.  (white lefty)
I bet she will blow Biden.
oh please by the time Biden gets elected he will pull a Harris and have a short time in office and we'll be stuck with kookie Kamala
As a former Californian, this is a very poor choice for Biden. She was picked based on color and not on her character. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

What if Biden tweeted. ‚ÄúLOL jK‚Äù
I don't think Biden's going to go for 8.
I was happy (relieved?) to vote for Joe. I‚Äôm ECSTATIC about the Biden/Harris ticket!!
12, if Biden steps down after 4, then she gets two terms.
Clearly, that was intended as a metaphor meaning that, with that sparring dynamic they showed, they displayed a lot of respect for each other, and that the ticket was going to be Biden/Harris at the end of the primary season.  If you can't read that into my tweet, *whatever*.
Biden could pick a cadaver for his running mate and I am still voting for him!
The VP Intro should be boring IMO. Drop the suspense, introduce the person, let the person speak to America. No drama. If you're the Biden campaign, the strategy here should be make America boring again.

hey Sandra, did you ever see the speech where Biden said ‚Äúpoor kids are just as smart as white kids‚Äù that was 2 months ago. So to him every minority is ‚Äúpoor‚Äù. He also said he doesn‚Äôt want his kids &amp; grandchildren growing up in a ‚Äúracial jungle‚Äù
Now you won't know whether it was your threat or his character that made the choice. A pity.   And any who see Trump and GOP for who they are and conjures up a reason not to vote for Biden are just choosing to bury themselves in the rubble Trump is making of America.

Id love to blame it on dementia but we all know that Biden is a racist. Not that hard to find his previous racist remarks.
Typical. Makes a racist remark yet everyone looks away. If trump said this it would be the end of the world. The Dems are hypocritical. Especially biden. He has a rich past of being racist.

I wonder if Kamala is gonna give Biden an N word pass
We need to wake up because if Biden becomes president this will be normal and he will say it is ok.  We have got to stand up for our freedoms before we lose them.  We can not expect others to do it for us.  God bless America and President Trump
By not debating the Great Potato in Chief (Tater trump) the "president" will claim that Joe Biden is afraid (too senile, uninformed, unintelligent, et al) to debate him. The Domestic Terrorist in Chief (Murder Bounties on American Soldiers) is not capable of debating Joe Biden.

Biden website redesign is good.
Obviously Biden/Harris is a infinitely better option than Trump, anyone who thinks otherwise is rolling in privilege. But "just doing her job" is not a good defense, especially when the job is law enforcement.

Don't listen to the hype.  The Domestic Terrorist in Chief cannot close the USPS, defund SSA (Medicare nor Medicaid), nor stop Vote By Mail by himself. The Putin Party Members (Republicans) are not going to help him with that in an Election Year.  Biden will win.
2/  And Joe Biden hasn't received any of Putin's Murder Bounties on American Soldiers.  Explain to us how wonderful the Putin Party (Republicans) is while you are Golfing and denigrating BLM and posing with The Book in front of a Church you have darkened the door of 1 or 2 times.

No one is worried about Biden himself. Biden is now a puppet for the extremist Left...and yes the Left does have power and depending on your definition of "God" and "destroy" they can and will do that as well.

Come on, folks. Come visit this person's tweet, and tell him/her why YOU are voting for Biden and Harris. Make sure not to use the word "Trump" - apparently s/he finds that word offensive.
Because several people I know, starting with my elderly mother wo is over 80 and has Alzheimer's, depend on Social Security, which is under threat by current policies, which candidate Biden promises to reverse.  Sorry to have made you wait so long.
Wear a facemask with a BIDEN button pinned to it, and a clothespin clipped to the mask to show that you're holding your nose in order to vote for Biden.  VOTE for Biden - otherwise, you ARE voting for donald, whether you're voting for someone else, or just sitting on your ass.
how well did his promise to spend billions on Biden work out
This is so what we need: Net Zero is now mainstream! #ClimateAction #GreenRecovery #FossilFree
This is awesome.  I actually like Biden a bit more than a mask, but if you are in this position, I can respect your POV.
But note that I'm much more opposed to Biden in general, I just also don't think that Harris was a good pick for VP - for a candidate who has NOT been accused of sexual harassment, see Jo Jorgensen:
What ‚Äúlight‚Äù are you talking about? You spelled Biden wrong; it‚Äôs spelled T r u m p.

Joe Biden thinks that "Every single American should be wearing a mask when they're outside for the next three months, at a minimum".   I think Joe Biden should take off his face mask so he can get more oxygen into his brain.
Um, your comment is hard to follow, perhaps due to your doing arithmetic the way Republicans do it when they control the Federal budget. You seem to be claiming that snakes are ducks, so more people would be dead if Biden had been President for the last four years. I doubt it.
I would rather COVID-19 spread under Biden the way H1N1 spread under Obama/Biden than the way COVID-19 spread under donald.

Now Comes the Difficult Work of Pushing the Biden-Harris Ticket Left
It should be no surprise Kamala Harris has been chosen as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate. From her career-long pursuit of right-wing goals to her flexibility with the truth, the two are remarkably similar politicians.

Here you go: Republican Senators who admit that donald was proven guilty by the House, but chose to vote "Not Guilty" anyway, putting party ahead of country:   This was when I concluded that it was time for #RIPGOP: time to be replaced by a new party.
I think Biden is the right candidate for 2020 because if he wins then he will unite the country as we all cyber bully him ùìΩùì∏ùì∞ùìÆùìΩùì±ùìÆùìª

You're the news guy. What's the story? If you're talking about Biden you might check into a thunderstorm and a generator.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
True, although in the main post they say Biden is favored to win
I can understand that, Biden is a disappointing option to say the least, but donald is so much more than the greater of two evils - he is truly evil incarnate. He was famously rated 45th out of 45 Presidents. Personally, I rank him 46th, below Jefferson Davis.
Trump Says Biden Insulted Every Man On Earth By Choosing Female Running ...  via  Wonderful! I love it! "It's actually pretty okay to insult THOSE men, because they're assholes!" Yes!
On cnn they announced that the confidence in the polices quote ‚Äúit is the lowest it has been since three decades ago.‚Äù Wonder why because 3 decades ago guess who‚Äôs been making the laws on crime Biden
Just remember blk ppl didn‚Äôt pick her or joe Biden. The fact joe one in a swing state was bc of one blk person and overwhelming a bunch of whites in sc. fact there‚Äôs no blk agenda in this country pick just white ones with poc face.
I think Biden/Harris is an awful ticket, but I'll vote for them, encourage my friends/family to vote for them, and do whatever it takes to get them into office.  But they're just so bad.
JUST IN: Tim Kaine responds to Kamala Harris being picked as Joe Biden's...  via  be prepared for whitefolks to keep saying this bc this is how political correctness works the drill the lie In you‚Äôre head from a hundred different directions
Something I've noticed on social media since Biden picked his VP is the number of white people complaining vs BIPOC being relieved/excited. It feels like I'm seeing a lot of white people not willing to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket, which seems...like a cop out honestly?
More like the klansman and hitler. Biden in hitler for blk ppl trump is racist but a selfish one he only cares for himself really. Trump does what he does to hide the fact that he‚Äôs passing laws really for himself and his properties
Liberal pundits are touting Joe Biden as a potentially transformative president in the mold of FDR. His donor lists ‚Äî and his own words ‚Äî say otherwise.
Vice President Biden choosing a woman of color to run against donald and Mike Pence is an interesting definition of "safe", considering the record U.S. voters have, which suggests very strongly that racism is still a big problem, and misogyny may be an even bigger one.
What Joe Biden's historic selection of Kamala Harris tells us about how he would govern
Rep. Karen Bass is no socialist, but she's hung around a few of us in the past. Because of this, as her name was floated for Biden's vice presidency, she's been subjected to McCarthyist-style smears. We on the Left have to clearly and loudly stand against
On Tuesday, Joe Biden finally announced his running mate. Here‚Äôs what our panelists think about the choice
Harris and Biden‚Äôs late son were longtime allies, helping to cement the relationship behind the Democratic ticket
"The United States urgently needs a leader who will have the courage to look at, think hard about, and speak openly about the dire perils posed by our country's vast nuclear arsenal."
"All of us will need to do everything we can do defeat Donald Trump this November, and Joe Biden will need strong progressive energy to win," said the PCCC in response.
Biden's selection of the California senator comes after Wall Street executives made clear that they would prefer "almost anyone" but Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
Despite decades in government, Joe Biden remains less sharply defined to voters than previous presidential nominees.
Harris is the third woman in U.S. history to be named as a vice-presidential candidate for a major political party.
Andrew Yang in Joe Biden Administration?  via  Biden should roll out his entire Cabinet and send them out to campaign as his proxies, to provide contrast  to the corruption and incompetence of donald's swamp dwellers.
Like...if the Biden/Harris ticket does win, I'm not expecting a whole lot of changes. I expect Obama-lite (and even Obama was pretty moderate, tbh) form Biden/Harris.  Basically, I'm not expecting a major cultural shift from that ticket. But..it's still better than Trump..sooo..
I personally feel like Kamala Harris was probably one of the worse choices Biden could have made for VP but she‚Äôs sill better than the complete trash that is Trump/Pence.   She‚Äôs referred to as a cop for a reason and with BLM I feel like that was a big miscalculation on Biden.
"Joe Biden can go suck a dick... Maybe of we all agree to behave ourselves maybe we don't need a president" - My mother  Ladies, Gentlemen and Everyone In Between, I think I did it.
Going to focus on the tremendous news of Ilhan Omar winning today's primary.  And, yes, you self-righteous, bloviating, performative nags; of course I'm going to vote for Biden/Harris, because anything is better than Trump. But the Biden/Harris ticket suuuuucks.
I'm ok w/ the choice of Kamala Harris as VP running mate for Biden. I''m still not a Biden fan, but I definitely feel more comfortable voting for Biden/Harris than, say, Biden/Whitmer.  I would have felt MUCH more comfortable voting for Harris/Warren or Warren/Harris, but..well..
Well that interview was a rambling train wreck! You have really lost your friggin mind!!  Think you best lay off Mr. Biden as it just causes us to look at your mental state more closely.  You sound desperate and nutty! ü§™ü§™
It's bizarro world where a Trump ad makes a good point about Joe Biden as a candidate.
in case anybody is wondering biden is gonna choose a running mate this week
Any reasonable candidate should be kicking Trump's ass in Swing States... yet here we are, with Biden barely holding a lead in most of them by only 2 points.
There *may* be times were voting 3rd party or similar (but NOT not voting as protest) is justifiable, but now is not one of them.   Biden and hopefully the Dems getting the House and Senate are the only chance of things getting better right now.
I don't like Biden or Harris, but as horrific as things are now, they only get much worse if Trump gets another term.   In my voting life I have gone back and forth on "vote strategically" vs "if you vote for the lesser of two evils nothing will change"...
She‚Äôs beside herself with joy over Kamala Harris. No, she‚Äôs not with joy, she IS Joy!  #BidenHarris2020 #BidenKamala2020 #Kamala #Biden #BidenHarris #KamalaHarris #ForThePeople #AMJoy #JOY
Biden shouldve picked Tulsi.
We progressives seem to so quickly forget #NotMeUs.  I wouldn't count on Biden or ANY VP pick to lead a progressive movement for change.  So, it's up to us to (a) take  +  to task on their past policies &amp; (b) create a movement where *we* lead &amp; they follow.
1 more thing: We progressives seem to so quickly forget #NotMeUs.  I wouldn't count on Biden or ANY VP pick to lead a progressive movement for change.  So, it's up to us to (a) Take Joe + Kamala to task on their past policies &amp; (b) create a movement where *we* lead &amp; they follow.
I'm all in for Biden-Harris for the obvious reason that Trump is a uniquely cruel and incompetent moron. But the fact that Republicans are already smearing these two standard liberals as "far left radicals" reveals how stupid it was to not elect *actually progressive* candidates.
harris was the safest bet for biden and it shows ü§ß no like no like no like
Finally. I had enough of him Biden his time.
This is a great choice!
The fact that you're still screeching "Both sides do it! Both sides do it! Raw-awk! Polly wanna cracker!" tells me all I need to know about how highly developed your perceptions of U.S. political culture are. Thinking that there's no difference between donald &amp; Joe Biden...? SMH
I try not to comment too much on politics in this Twitter account, but I can't remain silent here.POTUS is trying to gin up support by stoking racism. He is spewing sinophobic, fearmongering lies. This is not OK. We need to be better than this.  162 days.
Interesting Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate.  I need to ponder this.
and the team saw this coming months ago...
a biden and kamala democratic ticket?
I agree that he should not raid the Senate for Secretary of Commerce. I consider Biden‚Äôs VP to be the 2024 front runner, so I think it‚Äôs worth it in CA.
Oh, I see your point too, now. She could indeed work on cleaning up the lawlessness Trump has injected into the gov't.... Though the DOJ might be better for that... the optics of a WoC for VP are too important for Biden right now though
Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. Let's do this, and kick the orange bastard and his sycophantic second out of office in the biggest landslide in US history.
You sure about that? Biden has a wide lead, and Harris is popular. More than likely, Dumpy is shitting his pants right now.
Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Biden makes his choice
2020 has gone in such a way that I'm fairly certain any moment I'm going to get a news alert that Biden chose Sarah Palin as his VP candidate.
Therefore they will never blame the cause bc they are the cause. Joe Biden will never back down from his bill that he made so why not hold him accountable for his sins that he caused unto black ppl.
So if Joe Biden HAS TO pick a black woman for veep, doesn't that mean Obama failed at being the first black president? Obama was supposed to be the savior of black America, I remember Jesse Jackson's tears of joy on that victory night in Chicago. Now look at Chicago.
Bc morning joe never speaks on the greedy truth of history. Think about how they discuss joe Biden as if he isn‚Äôt racist as if his pass doesn‚Äôt exist. Now I may not like trump but if your going to talk about somebody when you‚Äôre doing the same is called hypocritical bs
When I watch the white media I be having this sense of notion that they‚Äôre deflecting. How by using every little thing trump do to deflect the real racism that biden can‚Äôt keep coming out his mouth. I hear morning joe call trump ignorant of history this is rhetorical
The reason I keep bringing up democracy being white supremacy is bc what happens when the majority of the majority want you dead or enslaved  prison. You‚Äôll get ppl like reagan Nixon Clinton Obama trump and Biden no matter which side you vote on ws is not only going to be there
Biden call blk ppl predators and the dems got blk women thinking that Biden is a match made in heaven smh. Wake up. Don‚Äôt be crazy and do the samething over and over again expecting different results.

U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California and former national security adviser Susan Rice, both Black, are among the top contenders.
Environmentalists are floating potential cabinet picks, hoping to pressure Biden to take on the fossil fuel industry.
Patriotic, devout are not positives. A bunch of the others pretty questionable terms to apply to Biden... still, a lot better than Trump, and what we have available at this point, so
Biden is going to pick a woman; that‚Äôs what he said. I assume he will also select his cabinet members and may introduce them all to us already. This way he will be able to hit the ground running should he win. Oh God, I can‚Äôt wait. Let it be!
Thank you! I hate to use this phrase, but ‚Äúit is what it is.‚Äù I just have to go with the flow and hope that Biden wins and 45* gets kicked to the curb. It would give me hope again, which I‚Äôm utterly lacking since the 2016 election of the orange dicktator.

Sylvie,Biden apologizes bc, even at his age and his many years as a prominent leader, he is human, therefore fallible, and is willing to both learn and embrace the changes his behavior requires. I‚Äôd rather have an honest penitent than an irresponsible and unapologetic nincompoop.

Lol he was QUOTING the mayor of New Orleans in 1985. The mayor of NOLA was a mean racist ans congress (with joe Biden) told him to piss off. So no he did not say that , troll
Any white person who turns away from Biden for choosing a Black woman as VP is racist. This election requires a Black VP female candidate. The strength and dedication of Black women is needed by our country.
trump can‚Äôt keep his bullshit straight. One day, Biden is a senile old man who can barely stand. The next day, Biden is destroying the Almighty and the Bible. Which is it?I like how this is the go to republican attack, heard it about Bernie, heard it about Warren. Now onto Biden....

There is something that is very irritating about Kamala Harris. I don't think she will help Biden at all.

You should be asking that question of Schiff,  Pelosi, and Schumer. How about Biden and Harris too? Massive amount of lies have been spoken by them and these lies can be backed up by documentation. Trump may exaggerate some but those are not outright lies like the others tell.
Don‚Äôt make this a Trump vs Biden debate. You‚Äôre being played and manipulated. Don‚Äôt you see that? I don‚Äôt care if we agree on anything else but one thing; If we sacrifice our freedoms, then all those who died for us to have them, died in vain.

The dogwhistles have become klaxons because they pretty much have nothing else. Biden/Harris is Republican Lite. How the fuck do you attack their policy ideas and have it come across as being in good faith? Everybody and their grandma knows this isn't a Bernie/Warren ticket.
Trump was attacking Warren for years. He saw her as a guaranteed opponent. Rice had built-in Obama baggage. Neither wound up on the ticket at all, and I think that's left them a bit scrambly.  They knew it'd be Biden, but they're acting like this ticket was out of nowhere.
don't get me wrong the same would be true of many other possible choices, but like, it seems to me they had a whole fucking gameplan for Warren or Rice and didn't think Biden/Harris was a real thing for some reason

Good lord! You‚Äôre tds is really out of hand. If you actually care about joe Biden, the person, the humane thing would be for him to step down.  Why is his family humiliating him like this?
Does it really matter? Trump is the President today. He has to run on HIS record. Biden is his opponent. He has to answer for some but not all of the Obama administration. If Trump could manage to NOT LIE we might have a real contest! But, Trump just can‚Äôt keep from lying! SAD!!!
Why, what are you trying to hide, Mr Kristol? If Biden is not mentally or cognitively able to do something as simple as have a debate, the American people deserve to know about it before the elections.
biden said desegregation would result in a "racial jungle" and kamala tried to keep people imprisoned longer to use them for cheap labor. so you've got a segregationalist rapist and a transphobic cop who supports prison slavery
hey, how much time have you spent canvassing or making calls for biden? if you want him to win so badly, maybe you should do something about it? or do you just treat politics like a team sport that you spectate?
You own daughter is voting for Biden/Harris, loser.
I bet video editing is a hit job in both Trump campaign and Joe Biden‚Äòs campaign. Seriously it‚Äôs true.
yes but have you heard about the biden plan?
Look at the statement by Biden. He stated Trump said they (white supremacists) were "very fine people." That is absolutely not true. Even Jake Tapper said it isn't true. You may want to listen to the entire Trump statement before making that reference.
This isn't about Obama/Biden. They handled it so well that we didn't need masks, etc. Sit down &amp; shut up.
There's something truly exceptional about the idea that a Harris/Biden presidency would be worse for whites than Adelson/Trump. Private prison operators don't care about the Color of Convicts. They probably prefer less troublesome whites, all told.
‚ÄúBiden bro‚Äù is absolutely perfect and beautifully ironic, imma start using that
As you may be able to tell, I'm not exactly jazzed about Biden either
I bet Biden-Harris are very dependent on the age bracket 18-24 yr olds if they want even the slimmest of chances to win...
Oh yes. I actually listened. It was a *trip*--especially after the coherent, non-crazy Biden-Harris event.
Definitely voting Biden/Harris ticket!
Now watch the press grill Biden/Harris over innuendo and conspiracy
As I jam out to  before the Biden/Harris live stream, I think about how republicans have next to zero iconic music they can use because everyone hates them and I laugh and laugh. #DoYouBelieveInLifeAfterLove
He can talk to Biden and fix it w/o airing dirty laundry publically. Solutions, not griping! We need to shed light on all minorities that are underrepresented, üíØ agree. Shaming on twitter doesn‚Äôt seem like the way to do that, IMO.
When climate activists who know damn well that Biden/Harris means another decade without meaningful climate legislation are talking about the music choice for their press conference, any hope for real change is dead. Gone. Buried and eaten by worms already.
January bullshit: Toxic Twitter fans But we'll be labeled as far-left He and Warren are OVER  August reality: KHive VP Biden is labeled socialist Articles talking about Biden debating Warren as if Bernie's first choice for VP wasn't always Warren  Good job everyone, you killed us
1. I don't believe Warren was a real consideration  2. I don't believe Biden would make his choice based on a gaffe  3. It doesn't matter either way. It's not like Warren VP = Biden pro-M4A.  It's Nazi vs. Republican Lite. That's the choice. It was always going to be this.
Oh and Biden/Harris is coming for ya
Not sure if I‚Äôm more annoyed that the DNC chose Biden over Bernie/the other options. Or that Biden chose Kamala over the other options. üòî

Absolutely John. You are a great man that fought for our freedom. You shall always be loved me my dear friend. You are an actual hero that fought. I‚Äôm proud to call you my. You fought for all of us. So proud you stand with Biden and Harris. You are a great man .üëç

Trump says if Joe Biden wins election you have to study ChineseüòÇ you are way ahead of them.
Color me shocked‚Äîyou are blatantly trying to get your racist followers to vote for Mr. Biden now?
I absolutely agree 199% Erica. It‚Äôs time for change. The past will never end with out new direction. The rightest conservatives like old fashion values. In fact even before women‚Äôs rights to vote. They don‚Äôt like change.. time to change everything. Biden/ Harris 2020üòÄüëç
You don‚Äôt know that. For those that love  and I contributed to her campaign, our goal should be to get her elected as senate majority leader and replace Schumer. Then her platform is Independant of Biden....
‚ÄúI need someone working alongside me who is smart, tough, and ready to lead. Kamala is that person,‚Äù - Joe Biden
Willie Brown who has an affair with her advised Biden not to pick her. She was 29 at the time while Brown was in his 60s.
What‚Äôs your point?  I love the fact she wants to save the planet.  Biden will replace lost jobs with green jobs.  So, no worries.
I agree. I wish Biden &amp; Harris well; they're brave souls. I'm in shock as to where America is today. The fascists are here &amp; well integrated, it would seem.  PDX was a trial. I think PDX won.  trump withdrew w/o a problem. It was a battle; they aren't finished.  I'm proud of PDX
Yes those voters definitely will be turned off. Biden probably chose her because her past would be well received by independents/moderates who are unsure of progressive policies but don‚Äôt want Trump. They expect those angry on the left to still vote for Biden
I‚Äôm very happy with the pick. She‚Äôs young with experience. I really think the pick was based on change. I‚Äôm really happy. Great pick joe. Let‚Äôs put Trump and his scared of trump little man pence to rest. Horrible leadership. Biden /Harris want change. Conservatives.. new times.
I was really hoping for her to take the AG post. But she'll be great no matter what she does. Any bets on who Biden will choose for AG? Maybe Sally Yates?
Honest question. Do you think the Biden choice of Harris as his VP this will strengthen down ballot chances in the senate?
A tool in the service of White Wellbeing is never illegitimate.  Vote Biden/Harris for what they will do.     #MAGA #GoingFree #Biden2020 #Harris2024
Biden-Harris in 2020!! I'm so excited to vote for the Democratic ticket again!
Oh no doubt about that. I think she is a solid choice (in general) for VP, although I expected her to be the main choice for AG for a Biden administration
congratulations!  What a great pick.  You two will make a great team.  Haven‚Äôt been this happy in a long time.  Biden and you give me hope for the country.  Nice job Joe!
MANY, MANY!  There will be a place for them in the Biden/Harris cabinet.  Their talents will be needed to clean up trump's aftermath.  They'll gain more experience and run for POTUS in the future!  (women age better than men, so we have a LONG list.  LOL)
I couldn‚Äôt be any happier. We have a fighting chance to end all this madness and division of the trump clan. So tired of trump saying the virus will go away. I want to hear facts. Biden/ Harris 2020. Very proud and hopeful. Let‚Äôs get this moron out.
What do I want to see in a Biden/Harris presidency? -COVID19 eradication -Respect for the science/research -Aid for struggling Americans -Aid for schools &amp; teachers -Tear down that damn Wall! -Release the children in cages -No more lies, no more bullshit -Women are human beings.
I hate Joe Biden and I hate Kamala Harris and I hate that there's a fucking Nazi in power that makes Joe Biden look remotely decent by comparison and I hate having to vote for abusers to get rid of abusers and I hate the Republican party and I hate billionaires and I hate cops.
There will be changes.  We have to have our ppl positioned &amp; that's what we get w Biden/Harris.  ...&amp; there is a great team w them... Warren, Porter, Rice, Abrams, , THIS is our year!  The GOP will fight dirty &amp; ugly.  We keep our heads high &amp; don't cave &amp; we'll win!

People are excited about Kamala Harris joining Biden? Couldn‚Äôt be me tf
Biden's store server has crashed so not everyone is disappointed it seems. Don't let your echo chamber get you down.
I'm very happy for  As much as I wish to have seen her as an amazing AG, she'll do an outstanding job as VP. I'm sure most of Biden's former Dem opponents will have seats in his cabinet. Here's to dumping  and his criminal administration.
It was inevitable when Klobuchar pulled out. I wouldn't be surprised if Biden decided then and decided to string us all along for a bit.
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for the prison and military industrial complex, marijuana staying criminalized, militarized police and a shitty healthcare Don‚Äôt let anyone shame you for not voting for this centrist republican

How do y‚Äôall feel about Kamala Harris being Biden‚Äôs pick for VP ?
Toaster\ orange juice. I despise Biden and Harris but at least the have an IQ higher than 14. Once in a while Harris does the right thing.
Seeing a lot of the expected backlash, but I'll say it again: if Harris on the ticket gets #MedicareForAll on the platform, the margin of victory for Biden is going to be absurd.
KAMALA it is!!!   Biden/Harris - a winning ticket!!
She's well-positioned to help Biden advocate firm law enforcement.
every person on the left right now is writing some version of this joke:  the people: we need health care, climate change is a beeotch, fuck these cops  joe biden: tbd on health care, we'll see about climate change, here's kamala to tell you why cops are dope
Congratulations  Kamala Harris will be the first Black woman nominated for vice president by a major party  via

Biden/Harris? Ugh whatever. Better than Condoleezza Rice. Let‚Äôs just get this shitshow over with already
She‚Äôll have Bill Barr‚Äôs head on a platter in to time! Great choice ‚ÄúPresident Joe Biden!‚Äù
If it means that Joe Biden is are next president and Trump and his criminal administration and their cronies are out and in jail, I would be happy to pay 98% in taxes.
like Biden's choice of Kamala Harris for VP. A LOT.  I can't wait for her to take it Trump and Pence. I know she has some baggage - all candidates (all people) do - but she'll make a great VP and would be a great president.
Well, he picked one of the few people on the list who supports SOME kind of Medicare For All, and he picked someone who won't bring built-in GOP Smear Machine ammunition.  I'm pleasantly surprised Biden didn't fuck that up.
Huge- finally- it is Kamala for VP. Biden tweeted it!
Biden can choose Nichols if he looks to reach out to Republicans; Saira Rao if he decides he needs to excite the woke crowd.
I like that ticket about equally as much as Biden/Duckworth. I think Tammy would be the better VP but Harris would be the better political choice and can definitely grow to fit the role.
I'm so tired of this VP edition of the bachelorette. Unless Biden 1) chooses Warren and then 2) dies I don't caaaaaaaaaaaaare
Biden should pick  for vp.
Biden has picked a female running mate.  Excited ......
Why not? All partners get a chance to make a speech. Jill Biden is quite an amazing woman.
Biden will be there on the last night, as most nominees do.

Joe has hairy legs! Joe Biden! You know the thing! Come on man!
Apparently Joe Biden is a fucking victim now. What did he ever do to you? I mean aside from rape, imprison, drone strike, bomb, rob, shoot, shackle, &amp;/or spy on you. Those are all lifestyle choices. Joe self-identifies as a political forest fire &amp; he needs a safe space to burn in
And when the woke are pulling Joe Biden‚Äôs strings, Israel and Jews will get screwed.
Is the magic money tree in Joe Biden‚Äôs basement?
‚ÄúAdvance liberal causes‚Äù your bio says. Dissing Biden‚Äôs possible choices does opposite. Many candidates have stocks and sit on boards that they divest themselves from when/if elected. This reporting earns you a block from this longtime liberal.

I disagree. She doesn‚Äôt regret what she did as a Bush staffer.  What I respect is her ability to use her inside knowledge of actual proper White House activity and contrast it with today‚Äôs chaos. She tells it like it is. Geo. Wills left the GOP and is voting for Biden. It‚Äôs ok!
I agree. My car would get keyed or set afire out driving in rural areas. But I do have a ‚ÄúIn my America love wins... ‚Äú yard sign on my driveway and so do my lovely neighbors. We will all have Biden signs on our road in Fall.
Anthony Scaramucci is an obnoxious Never Trumper Republican who is supporting Joe Biden yet denies Joe Biden will do any of the things in the Democrat platform. So delusional!
I was just saying kind of opposite to my spouse. I see stupid-big trucks w/ huge trump flags and merch flying down street. I never see the sensible Dems do that for Biden. But that is a good thing. They are activists not maniacs.
so literally every single thing they're saying about biden is what they'd have said about bernie only we'd get all the good policy ok cool just checking
so, IMHO, the best we can hope for from electoral politics is Biden picks Kamala Harris and maybe one day comes around to adopting some whittled-down final bill based on her sorta-Medicare for All plan  lol it's not as bad as him picking Hillary I guess?
It's worth pointing out that Whitmer met with Biden in-person a week ago. While Rice has been all over the media lately, Kamala has been Biden's BFF and Duckworth is quite popular among the pundits, Whitmer is flying in under the radar.
I think Bass is eliminated based on the Scientology video's bad optics + the reluctance of the Biden campaign to do anything to please progressives (many have urged him to pick her).  Warren &amp; Clinton I rule out because they're announced already for the night the VP pick speaks.
so with that, I'm predicting it now:  Elizabeth Warren is not going to be Joe Biden's VP.
the two people announced as speakers on the night announced as "the night Joe Biden's VP pick addresses the nation" are Warren and Hillary Clinton  the most likely scenario is it is neither one of those two women.  if it is, would you REALLY expect him to pick Warren?
the Axios article gives me reason to believe that there is absolutely no way that Elizabeth Warren is going to be Joe Biden's VP pick
MSNBC needs to STFU about the Biden Campaign being "late" to pick a VP! VP picks usually don't happen until the convention so just fucking stop it!
I'm gonna beat joe biden.mp4
Warren and Clinton are confirmed to be speaking next Wednesday.  That's the night Biden's VP addresses the nation.  I have a feeling it's neither of them, but if it is? Lord.
If this is accurate it is difficult to understand the ignorance of the electorate regarding the current issues. This seems to be entirely the influence of the mainstream fake news media - Trump is bad, hydroxychloroquine kills, Biden is smart, the Green New Deal is good. WRONG!
Oh, do you mean how you are openly working with Russia to spread misinformation (lies) about your FRIEND Joe Biden, while having your head residing in Trump‚Äôs colon???
It's the other way around. tRump* can't handle a debate. He can't handle the truth. Biden is fine. Some people confuse his stuttering for mental decline....which it is not. He has had to deal with stuttering his entire life.
It‚Äôs also funny (and by funny I mean sickening) listening to middle aged democrats telling a young WOC (&amp; survivor) that she‚Äôs supposed to ignore all this damning evidence about Joe Biden because ‚Äúthe other guy‚Äôs worse and if you don‚Äôt vote for him, you‚Äôre electing Trump‚Äù
Joe Biden is so fucking creepy and incompetent and corrupt I just honestly don‚Äôt know if I can vote him still. I probably will, but this is the man who said he would VETO MEDICARE FOR ALL EVEN IF THE HOUSE AND SENATE PASSED IT!! In the middle of a pandemic.
-Steal the election by making it safe to vote? We have vote-by-mail in Oregon, and it works. No fraud. -Honey, EVERYONE endorses Biden. -Black Lives Matter &amp; Pelosi are not Marxists. -A Patriot is someone who will help get that POS out of the People's House.   Stop with the lies.

Joe Biden may be our first president chosen by affirmative action. No one would give even half a fuck about the old racist if he didn't faintly smell of Obama, and Obama only picked him for VP to be his designated token white geezer to chill the Clintonites.
Man, Biden and Trump on The Portal, or the Rubin Report, that would be incredible.
The Republican parry has effectively convinced half of America that democrats are socialists, when in reality most democrats are centrists. Obama, Hillary, and Biden are all centrist/moderates who have been called socialists and leftists. People have no idea what leftist means
And I don‚Äôt want to hear any of this ‚Äúbring the country together‚Äù bullshit from Biden. I WANT PROSECUTIONS!
We are not done!  We need to be proactive by talking to friends and family about why voting for Biden is so important and actually CASTING OUR VOTE is crucial for the future of our country. Volunteer for local campaigns, phone banks, and you will make a difference! We can win!
Looks like it was all progressives asking Biden to pick Bass so I'm ruling her out
The president has also said we should "look into" using sunlight internally to combat C-19, and that Biden will "hurt God". He retweets video from "doctors" who believe endometriosis is caused by having sex with demons in your sleep, and made up an invitation from the Yankees.
I really hope they don't shaft Biden if Trump loses. He literally gave up his last couple of years of functionality. I disagree with his belief that it was necessary to save the republic, but that sacrifice should be recognized regardless.

Funny to think that there is literally no positive reason to vote for Joe Biden. The only good reason to vote for Biden is that Trump is a duplicitous s**tbird who has followed through on none of his campaign promises, and if you don't punish that you will simply get more of it.
What comes out of Biden's mouth and what comes at a trump's mouth, Are not even comparable Anyone's allowed to make a mistake long as they corrected trump never does his mistakes are intentional
Well Jimmy Carter is deeply religious but ran keeping it out of politics. Biden can/does too!
All Biden need say, ‚ÄúI am catholic and I only discuss it w/ my God. I believe in separating church and state.‚Äù THE END. We really want to have a religion pissing match in our presidential election?
Antifa doesn‚Äôt care who is in power! They want destruction! They want the end of the US. If Biden wins it won‚Äôt stop them they will be empowered! And he won‚Äôt do anything to stop them! Our only chance is a Trump win &amp; hopefully control of the senate &amp; congress!
Joe Biden is the perfect personification of what ails the Catholic Church today.
Biden is pro-choice.
I think Andrea Mitchell didn't reread her tweet before posting. But Obama is helping advise Biden. btw, Obama has no desire for another term. He's happy where he is.

Suburbia, Portland, Oregon.  What isn't burnt, trashed, or ruined, doesn't have a Biden sign here either. And this is Bernie-land.
How come when Joe Biden tweets to clarify his horrific racist comments he sounds totally different than when he talks. It's as if a different person is tweeting for him. Weird.
The Biden comment today pretty much covers what he thinks of the black community. I know his people tried to cover for him but he has said shit like this for years.

Only the first one was racist. The other two are taken out of context.  The Latin comment was about the various countries they come from (Latin America) which isn‚Äôt the case for many black Americans DUE TO SLAVERY.  Biden saying Americans are racist against Asians isn‚Äôt racist.
I feel we as a party need to be more pragmatic  and less puritanical. Biden's not perfect. Harris is not perfect, but they're who we got and they're better than the incumbent. Simple as that.

He could have mentioned it SOONER. He lied saying that Obama didn't leave a playbook. But it was proven Obama/Biden did leave one. He never shut the country down. He wanted to open it back up.

Joe Biden loves black people so much, he just wants to give them a big old 9 minute bear hug right around the neck.

That is absolute BS.  In fact, Biden has pledged to increase funding to police.  Secondly, no one is taking all the guns in America.  QUIT LYING! #AmericasGreatestMistake
More scare tactics. Republicans have been using that same tired "threat" for decades. If Biden was going to take people guns away, didn't he have an 8 year span (recently even) when he could've done that?
Don‚Äôt be this white woman. Just don‚Äôt. You vote for Joe Biden, or you own every piece of trump. Very few things are black and white. This? This is absolutely one of them. You have the ability to prove you‚Äôre not a fascist and all it takes is voting for Biden. At all costs.

We need a real President that will know what he is doing. A humble man and not an arrogant man!!! A gentleman and not an asshole!!!
Strong evidence indicates that both Biden and Trump are racist. However, there are degrees of racism. Biden is at least in good part a multi-cultural liberal, like selecting Kamala. Trump has projected the Central Park 5 and Obama as a black threat.
I am very concerned. Social Security is the institutional manifestation of our America being a community. Biden-Harris is the ticket

Trump is trying to kill us. Biden and Kamala are trying to save us.
President Trump attacks Joe Biden for calling governors to mandate all Americans wear masks for the next three months, accusing the Democratic presidential candidate of politicizing an issue Trump himself has used for political gain in recent months.
I'm a boomer, so I remember a long way back. Biden &amp; Harris aren't perfect candidates, nobody is. But they are SO MUCH  BETTER than Trump and Pence, it is hard to believe anyone with brains would even consider not voting for them.
2/2 ‚ÄúDuring the campaign and, if they win, during a Biden-Harris administration, Ms. Harris‚Äôs staff hiring would be approved by Mr. Biden.‚Äù
‚Äú1/2 ‚Äúpotential for conflict between Biden &amp; Harris advisers was resolved ....at least for now: Mr. Biden and his advisers made plain to Ms. Harris that they expected to have the same understanding with respect to staff hiring that Mr. Biden had followed with‚Äù Obama.
‚ÄúBiden advisers made clear that selecting Ms. Harris for the vice presidency did not mean selecting her full political entourage for jobs in the campaign or government. That rule would apply, Ms. Harris was told, even to her sister, Maya ...a former Hillary ... adviser‚Äù
‚ÄúThere was a particular distrust in the Biden camp for the sharp-elbowed California operatives with whom Ms. Harris has long surrounded herself, fearing that they might seek to undermine Mr. Biden in office to clear the way for Ms. Harris in 2024.‚Äù
The Biden camp is so distrustful of Harris they told her she couldn‚Äôt bring her staff or sister to the campaign.
Biden and Kamala are just the team for the job.
You haven't fought for the people in decades all you care about are your donors that;'s why you screwed Bernie twice never Biden.

Voter fraud will account for at least 10% of the total vote count with 95% of the fraud benefiting Biden.
Joe Biden raised $26MIL in the 24 hours after he named Kamala Harris as his running mate, doubling his previous one-day record and signaling enthusiasm among Democrats following the selection of the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket.
Hillary warned us in a calm rational voice and the deplorable wanted trump. Biden, someone with a penis, is also warning us. Do we really think it will make a difference?
Where are the police? Portland is run by Democrats. This is what our country will be if Biden gets elected. #WalkAway2020  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
Live in Oregon where we all vote by mail. If I think Trump is disrupting  voting  through manipulating the Post Office I will hand carry my ballot to the drop box at the county elections department and it will be a vote for Biden!
Me, my three daughters, my mom and sister who have always voted republican without fail... my republican dad and independent husband and sons in law... we are ALL voting for Biden/Harris because we are sick and tired of being embarrassed by our Divider in chief and grifter pres.
Biden has always been a nothing burger. Harris was never very popular,  look how poorly she did in the primaries.
You know what's worse than Joe Biden picking Kamalia Harris has vice president. Having Trump has president
He‚Äôs campaigning for Biden now?
If Biden wins, the Harris people will leak to the press every Biden slip or stumble to encourage him to step down! You think the Trump folks are bad!
It will be fun during the campaign and after‚Äô if Biden wins, watching the tension between the Biden and Harris camps!
If I was Joe  Biden I would worry about Harris! She will not have his back!
I see professing evangelicals being willing to vote Biden/Harris motivated primarily by anti-racism.   Here's my question: is the phrase "single-issue voting" only applicable to one set of issues and not others?
Biden yes, Harris no!
Pandemic Diary Day 149: Biden Makes History With VP Pick - Kamala Harris  #nastywoman
I think, Marc, the reasoning you used to decide to vote for Biden was sound. There are amazing things brewing; Biden has heard the liberal word and has promised to be 'the most progressive President since F.D.R..' You could be undecided for a bit.
Fox News Host Neil Cavuto Corrects Trump Campaign: Kamala Harris Never Called Biden ‚ÄòRacist‚Äô
Joe Biden cannot even pick out his socks!  WTH?  Don‚Äôt you just keep shaking your head in disbelief? Trump 2020 üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
The VP pick well not massage a break a nominee. But if something happens to Biden god forbid we will have a woman as president and that would be amazing.
Is that the Mooch in the phone reflection?  AS? To the right of  Biden? That might be what is so bad.
My first pic as well, I was wishing and hoping and sending Joe Biden my wish!  What a ticket I am so Excited!!
#KamalaHarris makes American history today as Joe Biden's selection for Vice President of the United States.
Yeah no. Harris and Biden both can be placed center right for sure.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm honored to join Joe Biden in the fight for the soul of our country‚Äù by Kamala Harris
Nope.  We are going to get charges of sleaze 24/7 because of this horrible candidate with a Titanic full of baggage.  If Biden had been running against anybody other than Trump, Harris would ruin his chances.  She is a lousy candidate.
If Biden were running against anybody but Trump, his choice of Kamala Harris would be fatal to his chances.  She is that poor a choice.  We are going to get charges of cronyism 24/7, and nobody will have to make it up.  #KamalaHarris #JoeBiden
Congratulations,  We're so proud of you and happy you've been officially selected as Joe Biden's running mate!
So...Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Just when we thought 2020 couldn't get weirder.  My political commentary for the year is now complete...
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday.
"There are three people on this ticket, so it is a bit crowded."  What a terrible choice Biden made with Kamala Harris.  The Willie Brown thing is going to tear the ticket apart.
Biden picked Harris because he  A: is trying to convince us he‚Äôs not racist. B: wants the ‚Äútop cop‚Äù to prevent any defunding on a federal level. If he wins then dies and she‚Äôs the president, I won‚Äôt complain as much because we desperately need feminine energy in the White House.
Only reason I would‚Äôve voted for Biden is for Kamala! Let‚Äôs fucking goooo!
The pac-12 cancelled football BUT Biden chode Kamala. I‚Äôm conflicted...

Biden‚Äôs best strategy:  play Rope-a-Dope with Trump.
Specially if Susan Rice is going to be Biden‚Äôs mate.
During the 2008 primary, Biden expressed surprise that Obama was 'clean,' being black and all. Sure Biden's a racist. There's a lot of racist sentiment in the U.S.. I've had black friends characterized by industry and other good qualities. But I have some prejudice in my psyche
What if Joe Biden just... never announces a VP?... Just frickin cowboys it, you know?  #DelawareStyle
Mayor Pete back in the news! He should be Secretary of State or UN Ambassador in the Biden Administration.  Nothing but respect for my guy.
Bill hicks still liked little girls and biden still sniffed little girls. Nothing you can say or do will change that. Yet you still cherish that 2 bit comedian so much that you claim his name sake. Sick!
BIGLY NEWS!  Chris Christie may play Biden in Trump's debate prep  first, he has to go on a diet, and then ride a bicycle like Joe did this weekend!
Interesting read.   The biggest #threat 2 the #GOP's #survival isn't #Biden, #VoterFraud, or even #tRUMP himself. It's the reality that the American #electorate is becoming more #racially &amp; #EthnicallyDiverse, more #urban, &amp; more likely not born in the #US.
Do we mention Biden likes to sniff little girls?
Joe Biden will now pick Papa Shango as his running mate.
The real reason is because Biden might think she died because the wrestler Kamala passed away today.
The Guardian, Really? Okay, You got me I'm totally gonna vote for Biden now even though he does like to smell children, is corrupt, involved in selling our country out to the communists like china, sounds like a racist and involved in U1. If only I had known this sooner.ü§£
Now that Kamala has died.  Joe Biden to pick Papa Shango as his running mate. #RIPKamala
I did hear that Biden has Swastika tattoo. He had it done in ancient Sumeria when it symbolized the powers of nature.
...Or raping 13 year old girls. Not once has anyone accused Biden of kiddie rape, but court documents accuse Trump and Epstein.  You‚Äôre an amad√°n.
You mean they let Joe out of the basement for once. Did someone at least warn the alter boys and little girls. Who do you think sniffed  more children today, Trump or Biden? I know, Stupid question. We all know.
Saw your statement today that Biden will be impeached as soon as voted in. Going to be hard since you will no longer control the Senate. You are so out of touch you are totally ineffectual. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Biden boat parade!
Was looking for a Biden boat. Found it!
Biden is just like you, corrupt and secretly racist, but at least he has enough intelligence to go with the emerging liberal zeitgeist now. The American people are not going to tolerate more restriction and austerity; At long last it is time to ask what our country can do for us.
Swing Voters Still Prefer Trump Over Biden  via  Ring of Fire Network
I agree he is pulling out all the stops at a last ditch effort to try to gain some support that the pos has lost to  Biden
If Biden takes a cognitive test it will be rigged and he will pass with flying colors, there is no end to demorat corruption.
If he's elected, Biden will have a once in a lifetime opportunity to take America to the next level, to meet with achievement the bold promise of this new world. The time calls for an F.D.R., a moderate soul in the service of the people
Biden campaign says no VP pick yet after bike trail quip | TheHill
Democratic social aid programs are investing in this country's economy. Social aid boosts that consumer spending all our markets and enterprises rely on- and a Biden presidency would see Rooseveltian public aid &amp; investment
So, the fix is in. When Biden steps down due to mental incapacity, Whitmer assumes the Presidency and enforces a regime of mandatory vaccinations.
Lol it‚Äôs crazy to be so educated yet so ill informed and ignorant. If you don‚Äôt know about Biden‚Äôs policies yet, you‚Äôve just been letting the TV tell you what to think my dude. Good luck with that mindset.
You're the media too, Ben.  How do you feel about Trump tweeting that Biden isn't "worthy of the black vote"?  By your logic, if you don't call them out, you are equally as hypocritical.   *Sips out of conservative tears mug*
Biden has no code. He doesn't know his own history, much less the history of Black people in America. To him, we are all just minorities to be tolerated in a nation established by whites for the benefit of whites. He recognizes the demographic shift is influencing politics, tho.
Men have been at the helm of the ship of state since we've been a nation. Biden will pick a woman as Vice President. I hope he decides his age would preclude him from serving a second term. It's time for a woman to right this ship!
As with many people Biden wasn't my first choice for a presidential candidate. Or my second. Or my third. But I'd rather have him and a competent administration rather than this corrupt mob boss regime we have now. Biden has my vote. Trump and the GOP need to be run out of office
Kanye West Implies His Presidential Campaign Is Intentionally Trying to Hurt Biden‚Äôs Chances
Still waiting for Trump to say something about the intelligence reports that described Russia promoting Trump and attacking Biden...  heck, I'd even settle for a few words on China and Iran's attempts at disrupting the 2020 election  Crickets
I see him hurting Trump more than Biden as only crazy, ignorant people would vote for Kanye or Trump.
I‚Äôm kinda white I‚Äôm definitely voting Biden. It should be a no brainer no matter your race creed or religion.  #ripjohnlewis honer him VOTE #VOTEBIDEN
My former dad did that a lot. Beat my mom for what he was doing. So I am very familiar with what Trump is doing.  Sooo.. Trump for prison 2020. And Biden for president 2020.
Are you saying you‚Äôll vote for 45 if you don‚Äôt like Biden‚Äôs veep pick? Asking for myself.
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. More lies. You literally don't have a clue what Biden will do. All you know is YOU'RE LOSING. Might have something to do with the crappy job you have done as President. November 3Rd we will MAGA without you. #ByeDon2020
Biden draws distinction on Black, Latino political diversity
Virginia Mayor Who Said Joe Biden 'Announced Aunt Jemima As His VP Pick,' Saw Nothing Wrong With His Racist Remark (and apparently he felt comfortable enough with his network of friends &amp; family to put it on Facebook).
Trump: ‚ÄúBiden is weak‚Äù  Also Trump: ‚ÄúBiden will hurt God. ‚Äú  ‚Äú...‚Äù

Schrodinger‚Äôs Biden: simultaneously weak and feeble but able to damage an omnipotent God. #TrumpIsALaughingStock #ImpotusAmericanus #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #Biden
#Thighland ... because he used too many technical words in a row.
It speaks very ill of Biden that the only way Trump can even try to differentiate himself from Biden is to lie.
No matter who he picks. Biden is a smart man he‚Äôll pick a good running mate. Obama picked him. Pray this will be over soon
You are sickening trump. You are showing your desperation you‚Äôll say anything to try to win back so many of voters turning to Biden. They see you for what you are. Antichrist
Biden was the first Catholic VP in US history.  Catholics make up a quarter of American voters (think Hispanic vote, amongst others). Once again, Trump is all about projection - he's the one without religion and more to the point, without a soul.So if it was Biden, it would not be a problem right?
Biden isn‚Äôt Catholic..he excommunicated himself by his actions on abortion
Why won't you press Harris or Biden? They won't answer any questions at so called press conferences.  Here's your opportunity to shine.ü§°
Trump will be reelected w/ better margin than 2016. We know MSM polls oversample Democrats. Their recent poll says 62% of voters don't want 2 tell them whom they'll vote on Nov 3. They don't want 2 be attacked by Biden/Antifa/BLM supporters. The 62% is Trump 2020 silent majority.
I hope he is tapped for #AG or anything - he plays an important role now, but we could really use him in the Feds on the Biden Harris team, Love him #JulianCastro
Never get tired of that GIF. üòÜ
Will Kamala Harris help Joe Biden's bid for the White House?
Joe biden is a fucking moron. Im not even rock hard for singlepayer but he makes a TERRIBLE case for insurance tied to employment. He's a fucking idiot. Gonna be hard to vote for him
"REVENGE IS MINE" sayeth the Lord God:  Biden said we we should not talk of Jailing Donald Trump some day . . . for his many crimes.  God will send Liars to the Lake of Fire, for eternity, Jesus said. So why fret?

Biden Picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as Vice Presidential Running Mate
Tell me why the Biden campaign asks me for like $30 for their campaigning when Biden has billionaire backers. Yet Bernie was asking me for like $3 every here and there and he has not even millionaire backers. K Biden.
I‚Äôm going to vote for Biden, of course, because I‚Äôm not a monster, but I‚Äôll always wonder what could have happened if Democrats hadn‚Äôt chickened out and supported the courageous and competent  this year instead.
Because a Biden win would guarantee eight more years of Trump.
I disagree. Donald is sabotaging the USPS, he's resurrecting the birther conspiracy for Harris, and he conspired with foreign govts to create a file of fake info on Biden. He asked foreign govts for help. This is a coup. The nazis vote as a block. We should too.
And having either trump or Biden in office is going to benefit us how? A known pedophile or a known abuser.
Prior to the virus America was on top and doing great.  Trump is the leadership we need.  If you vote Biden you get Kamala and believe me, America will not be the same.
I've definitely seen that take, and very forcefully too, to the point of calling people rape &amp; murder apologists for wanting to vote Biden for harm reduction
A lot more members voting for Trump than Biden. That says more than any other statistic.
Mike Pence &amp; His Red Meat are gonna open for Mike Love‚Äôs The Beach Boys on a coast-to-coast arena tour if biden wins and the schedule clears up
I'm still not convinced we have any substantive change with biden in office. I live at the bottom.  The "woke" can take the identity politics and shove it. No offense. So far they haven't made many policy promises... trump have me 300 a month to my unemployment. Substance
He knows what trump is capable of (Which is frightening) and we all know what he isn‚Äôt capable of ( being a honorable leader) if he‚Äôs choosing a lesser of two evils , choose Biden. Who won‚Äôt bring our country into a war. Which trump will do.
is progressing from a #CCP paid DC think tank to CCP espionage enabler. "Shanghai Academy acts as a front 4 Chinese spy recruitment according to FBI." "Nearly 2 dozen scholars at Brookings currently serve as advisers to the Biden campaign."
I mean I‚Äôm not telling you who to vote for but you don‚Äôt think Trump would continue to appoint judges that directly attack trans people as a whole, and unilaterally give orders to directly harm trans people? Biden is a rapist probs but he isn‚Äôt going to legalize rape
there will be a vaccine before the end of the year and Joe Biden will not be president he probably won't make it to the end of the year his wife should be ashamed of herself that she can't tell the man is seriously ill and declining mentally
besides that Biden is trying to take credit for it president trump should be awarded the Nobel peace prize
that is all Biden does is plagiarize everything he says the president has already said and done he has nothing to say about anything important
There are 100% those out there that are trying to blackpill people into not even getting rid of Trump right now, even saying that Trump might be better for the left than Biden. That's mostly what the issue is. I hate Biden but I've refocused my energy elsewhere for now.
Banning gatherings of 30 or more just means that only #Biden will be able to have rallies :/
The insults all played into racist and sexist stereotypes about Black women and made clear that Trump does not intend to throw away a playbook filled with misogynistic attacks and dog-whistle racism that have imbued his political career, even as the Biden campaign advances...This
Biden seemed to enjoy drawing attention to Trump's sexist remarks about Harris, such as when the President repeatedly called her "nasty" shortly after Biden announced her as his running mate, stating that the President was "whining." This one maybe? He‚Äôs scared of a strong woman?
Are you sure it isn‚Äôt the tweet where the virus president warned white folk that more people of color would be moving into their neighborhood if Biden/Harris are elected? Not it. Darn, a cite would have been helpful. I‚Äôll keep looking.
If you want to pretend like this guy doesn't advocate not voting for Biden day in and day out nonstop that's cool I guess
If this is vote shaming, then saying not to vote for Biden is vote shaming too. I have spent multiple days a week in the streets with my local BLM comrades for months now, I haven't heard a single one of my black comrades say not to vote. I have heard many of them say to vote.
He didn't demand anything of black people or anybody else in particular, he was addressing anyone on "the left". He detailed an argument about why voting for Biden is part of a larger political strategy, assuming that to be about identity is... identity politics
‚ÄúShe was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. It's hard to pick someone that was that disrespectful,‚Äù  Joe Biden is nothing like Trump. Trump‚Äôs only concern is his ego, while Biden‚Äôs concern is what‚Äôs best for the country. He doesn‚Äôt hold childish grudges like Trump
I never want to see biden and pussy in the same sentence ever again
Biden says all U.S. governors should mandate masks to slow coronavirus' spread
everything that comes out of Joe Biden mouth the president has already said and done he plagiarized everything he has nothing to say about anything important and he looks like a very frail senior he can barely complete a sentence
letting you know I screencapped your Biden tweets, in case it gets scrubbed....    put the heat to their feet!!!!
Maybe Biden thought this had to do with Halloween ü§î
"I learned about kids jumping on my lap" is exactly why they don't let Biden out in public any more on his own.
the only plausible harm reduction argument for voting for biden/harris is that they would certainly handle a pandemic better. if they kill thousands of people it will be because they start a war
We all miss Bernie. Biden should give him an office in the WH to fight voter suppression.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews If this does not say "vote Trump" nothing will.
#Biden and #Harris just demanded a nationwide mask mandate. Because apparently they think mandates and masks are popular  #Masks #NationwideMaskMandate

Biden supporters act like they didn't have a prayer with just Joe, but now we have someone to save the day.
He‚Äôs already losing his shit over Obama living in his head. Now he‚Äôs got Biden and Harris taking up residencey
Biden in a basement. Meanwhile, Trump is actually accomplishing world peace  Read this. This is huge and historic!
If any other democrat or president did this... it would be called out... you support it.   Would you support it if biden said the same thing when your guy was leading ? Doubt it
If you can vote for 20+ years by mail like I have and my vote has been counted.... why now is it an issue when its really only trump who is worried he is gonna lose cause the writing is on the wall. He won in 2016 with the process. He knows people dislike biden. Less than clinton
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to ‚Äî wait for it ‚Äî Russia #Smartnews Putin for Trump - Putin will do whatever he can to keep his puppet, Trump
The violence is going to be off the charts when the left controls the house, senate and WH again and Fox will be an integral part of that happening. History ‚Äî as well as the near future ‚Äî will not be kind to any of them.
the postal accountability and enhancement act was passed in 2006 when biden was a senator. the administration he was vice president of did nothing about it and never tried. he's not going to save the fucking post office.
Nope. Now I‚Äôm really not voting for Biden
A quick perusal of  ‚Äòs timeline will show you a number of hit pieces on Biden and Harris.  He‚Äôs proud FedSoc member.  In other words, consider the source and ignore the content. Shame on
Don‚Äôt attack/guilt trip people who aren‚Äôt okay with Biden/Harris. Some ppl don‚Äôt want to vote for segregationists and cops üôÉ
Ok. Sure but Last year, Kamala Harris stated that she believes the women who have accused Joe Biden of inappropriate behavior, including unwanted touching and kissing. ‚ÄúI believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it,‚Äù Harris said

Hit the dab pen every time biden sniffs or awkwardly touches kamala harris or says something weird and uncalled for about her body throughout the campaign trail. That‚Äôs the only way im going to survive this hellection
My cows are all gone. I blame the Biden /Harris campaign.
I mean, Bernie lost the primary, Biden never said he supported it, he was open and honest about that all along. People chose Biden because of media narratives about "electability" which are self-fulfilling, and intervention by well liked Dems in the primary. It is what it is.
Joe picked her?  I think not. I'm sure there were those in the Biden camp did the picking for him.
If anyone said they heard her call Biden a racist their ears must be living in another dimension.
.5 sec - "I don't know why..." is the lie. Joe Biden better stay in good health, else she could be a conspirator, or I am tripping
Joe Biden is 77yo. Based on generic actuarial data (odds of death w/in the next year, based on age) there‚Äôs a 20% chance he‚Äôll die in the next four years. If we up that to 8 years, it‚Äôs 50%.
He has absolutely no idea how to handle Biden‚Äôs pick of Harris and it‚Äôs hilarious.
Until 11/3, I know who we is.  After? Will Lincoln go back to being small gov't, low tax, anti-reg, deficit hawk, climate crisis denial, neo-lib militarism, substandard health care, e.g. mainstream R?  Elect Biden/Harris and then attack?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
I'm in Oregon, an hour from Portland. I drive daily all over for business.  I've seen ONE (1) Biden sign and it was out in a small town. I pulled over to take a picture, a car passed and saw me doing it and the driver gave me the "I know, right?" gesture.  Seen 4 Bigfoot btw.
He‚Äôs seconds away from the bully pulpit and he doesn‚Äôt even mention the millions of American who struggle with low water pressure or are in the battle of their lives against stage 4 Windmill Cancer?  A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for crazy Aunt Tiffa!
neither one of them said a thing about the protest and looting Harris is going to defund the police and Biden is just one of the fine old folks neither said anything about helping America more lies and propaganda Harris flows like the wind
OOOOHH!  Keenly astute! Listen closely, She said, "Perhaps, that's what he (Joe Biden) wanted!"
He‚Äôs a racist CisHet man who‚Äôs outta touch will the majority of voters. His policies he wrote and voted for were garbage and extremely pro-police state. He picked who he picked for a reason. Centrist Dems have already told me off for ‚Äúliving in the past‚Äù about Biden.
I want Biden to make  AG OR Mr. Kirschner could be put in charge of the Trump Crimes Commission. Mr. Kirschner learned much from Robert Mueller and truly respects the Rule of Law. He‚Äôd ‚Äúlawfully and apolitically‚Äù bring Trump &amp; his crime family to justice.
You just want Biden so he‚Äôll cover up for you pervs and traffickers
Let your Democrat friends think you're voting Biden. Lie to the pollsters if you have to. We cannot afford to lose this election, but being yelled at and spit on is also inconvenient.  Smile, nod and VOTE.
To smear who? Antifa or Biden and Harris? Neither really need help in that department üôÇ
I'm not crying, you're crying. #Competence2020
Watching the Biden speech, then noticed the ad. Subliminal message or clever advertising, you decide.
Then they say that she‚Äôs too smart.  She will outshine Biden. Ok is that a backhanded compliment?  We tried really stupid for almost 4 years we need to trade up
Biden is one of the worst candidates ever but all he has to do is just sit in his basement and let Trump destroy himself. Trump used to attack attack attack and now he does is play the victim it‚Äôs sai!. These two are going to reverse every thing Trump did during his election.
You still want to put your faith in a broken, corrupt system with Biden though ? I feel the time for that is long gone  ( like decades gone). How many times do we need to keep giving them a chance to the right things, and come up with empty promises? By the People for the People
Progressives like myself.  Young, energetic voters who want real change.  She definitely excites younger more progressive voters in ways Tim Kaine couldn‚Äôt.  She may not apeal to the ‚ÄúBernie Bro‚Äôs‚Äù but she speaks to a much larger base than say...Biden or Pence.
45 is running his mouth spouting absolutes with ZERO proof Biden will do anything of the kind. üôÑ Keep in mind that 45 &amp; his boot lickers are NOT stating what 45‚Äôs agenda is for his second term. 45 et al are desperately searching for a boogie man to scare votes out of people.
Have you checked out Lars?  Here's his thoughts:
If it‚Äôs one or the other (which it isn‚Äôt) personally I‚Äôd rather keep trump, at least we already know what he‚Äôs about. Biden hasn‚Äôt actually spoken on his views much his entire campaign is just ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm not trump‚Äù which is very dangerous
Yeah, thing about that is if everyone thinks like that there would literally not be a chance, if people voted for who they actually wanted we would be able to do away with the duopoly. Personally, I couldn‚Äôt sleep at night voting for trump or Biden I would sooner not vote at all
Does any reasonable person actually believe Joe Biden would finish his first term?

You can be a hater all you want but I‚Äôve made my decision and that was after I fought for Biden from the time he was crowned the nominee.   He‚Äôs the center the neo cons wanted why couldn‚Äôt he have reached out to the progressives with his choice? #rockbottom
Does ANY Democrat actually think Joe Biden would finish his first term?
Kamala Harris is a phony and just goes with the flow of the radical left wing also a liar and Joe Biden doesn't even know he picked her but just wait he will be sniffing her and touching her and if he wins America is done our great nation will fall
It‚Äôs almost like we shouldn‚Äôt be counting on Biden to solve those problems that may have led to Trump, but instead organize and mobilize to force whoever the people are in power to act. It‚Äôs almost like that would be way more possible if we avoid full-on fascism....
I wonder who told Joe Biden he picked Kamala Harris for President? ü§îüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Biden took a nice bike ride this weekend. They probably didn‚Äôt show that on OANN or Faux News....

Just chortling over here when GOP says a Biden-Harris administration would be extreme and inept. Couple things: #1 - (ahem) üëÄ #2 - Then why would you be so worried about them winning?
It really doesn‚Äôt matter, what is she going to run on? Her record? Hahaha ü§£!!! Biden is dead in the water along with Harris.
My immediate neighbors (white 50+) voted Trump but are going with Biden.  Like it‚Äôs an easy switch.  Even practical.
Just any woman won't do! #NeverKamala Biden just lost huge voting blocks. Not that we were wanting to vote for him. Now we're really done! #ByeByeBiden
We're not sheep to just follow like Trump voters. We have our own values and most importantly a VOTE and Biden and Harris are NEVER getting bit. They haven't earned it. They ARE what we've been fighting against! #NeverKamala #NeverBiden #NeverBidenHarris
I was going to answer, fairly recently! I wonder how she will feel when Biden comes up from behind, starts smelling her Hair, sniffing off Dandruff making it look as if he just snorted a Line of pure cocaine! She also must have forgotten that Women were accusing Biden!

Biden isn‚Äôt Catholic..he excommunicated himself by his actions on abortion
Why won't you press Harris or Biden? They won't answer any questions at so called press conferences.  Here's your opportunity to shine.ü§°
Trump will be reelected w/ better margin than 2016. We know MSM polls oversample Democrats. Their recent poll says 62% of voters don't want 2 tell them whom they'll vote on Nov 3. They don't want 2 be attacked by Biden/Antifa/BLM supporters. The 62% is Trump 2020 silent majority.
I hope he is tapped for #AG or anything - he plays an important role now, but we could really use him in the Feds on the Biden Harris team, Love him #JulianCastro
Never get tired of that GIF. üòÜ
Will Kamala Harris help Joe Biden's bid for the White House?
Joe biden is a fucking moron. Im not even rock hard for singlepayer but he makes a TERRIBLE case for insurance tied to employment. He's a fucking idiot. Gonna be hard to vote for him
"REVENGE IS MINE" sayeth the Lord God:  Biden said we we should not talk of Jailing Donald Trump some day . . . for his many crimes.  God will send Liars to the Lake of Fire, for eternity, Jesus said. So why fret?

Biden Picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as Vice Presidential Running Mate
Tell me why the Biden campaign asks me for like $30 for their campaigning when Biden has billionaire backers. Yet Bernie was asking me for like $3 every here and there and he has not even millionaire backers. K Biden.
I‚Äôm going to vote for Biden, of course, because I‚Äôm not a monster, but I‚Äôll always wonder what could have happened if Democrats hadn‚Äôt chickened out and supported the courageous and competent  this year instead.
Because a Biden win would guarantee eight more years of Trump.
I disagree. Donald is sabotaging the USPS, he's resurrecting the birther conspiracy for Harris, and he conspired with foreign govts to create a file of fake info on Biden. He asked foreign govts for help. This is a coup. The nazis vote as a block. We should too.
And having either trump or Biden in office is going to benefit us how? A known pedophile or a known abuser.
Prior to the virus America was on top and doing great.  Trump is the leadership we need.  If you vote Biden you get Kamala and believe me, America will not be the same.
I've definitely seen that take, and very forcefully too, to the point of calling people rape &amp; murder apologists for wanting to vote Biden for harm reduction
A lot more members voting for Trump than Biden. That says more than any other statistic.
Mike Pence &amp; His Red Meat are gonna open for Mike Love‚Äôs The Beach Boys on a coast-to-coast arena tour if biden wins and the schedule clears up
I'm still not convinced we have any substantive change with biden in office. I live at the bottom.  The "woke" can take the identity politics and shove it. No offense. So far they haven't made many policy promises... trump have me 300 a month to my unemployment. Substance
He knows what trump is capable of (Which is frightening) and we all know what he isn‚Äôt capable of ( being a honorable leader) if he‚Äôs choosing a lesser of two evils , choose Biden. Who won‚Äôt bring our country into a war. Which trump will do.
is progressing from a #CCP paid DC think tank to CCP espionage enabler. "Shanghai Academy acts as a front 4 Chinese spy recruitment according to FBI." "Nearly 2 dozen scholars at Brookings currently serve as advisers to the Biden campaign."
I mean I‚Äôm not telling you who to vote for but you don‚Äôt think Trump would continue to appoint judges that directly attack trans people as a whole, and unilaterally give orders to directly harm trans people? Biden is a rapist probs but he isn‚Äôt going to legalize rape
there will be a vaccine before the end of the year and Joe Biden will not be president he probably won't make it to the end of the year his wife should be ashamed of herself that she can't tell the man is seriously ill and declining mentally
besides that Biden is trying to take credit for it president trump should be awarded the Nobel peace prize
that is all Biden does is plagiarize everything he says the president has already said and done he has nothing to say about anything important
There are 100% those out there that are trying to blackpill people into not even getting rid of Trump right now, even saying that Trump might be better for the left than Biden. That's mostly what the issue is. I hate Biden but I've refocused my energy elsewhere for now.
Banning gatherings of 30 or more just means that only #Biden will be able to have rallies :/
The insults all played into racist and sexist stereotypes about Black women and made clear that Trump does not intend to throw away a playbook filled with misogynistic attacks and dog-whistle racism that have imbued his political career, even as the Biden campaign advances...This
Biden seemed to enjoy drawing attention to Trump's sexist remarks about Harris, such as when the President repeatedly called her "nasty" shortly after Biden announced her as his running mate, stating that the President was "whining." This one maybe? He‚Äôs scared of a strong woman?
Are you sure it isn‚Äôt the tweet where the virus president warned white folk that more people of color would be moving into their neighborhood if Biden/Harris are elected? Not it. Darn, a cite would have been helpful. I‚Äôll keep looking.
If you want to pretend like this guy doesn't advocate not voting for Biden day in and day out nonstop that's cool I guess
If this is vote shaming, then saying not to vote for Biden is vote shaming too. I have spent multiple days a week in the streets with my local BLM comrades for months now, I haven't heard a single one of my black comrades say not to vote. I have heard many of them say to vote.
He didn't demand anything of black people or anybody else in particular, he was addressing anyone on "the left". He detailed an argument about why voting for Biden is part of a larger political strategy, assuming that to be about identity is... identity politics
‚ÄúShe was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. It's hard to pick someone that was that disrespectful,‚Äù  Joe Biden is nothing like Trump. Trump‚Äôs only concern is his ego, while Biden‚Äôs concern is what‚Äôs best for the country. He doesn‚Äôt hold childish grudges like Trump
I never want to see biden and pussy in the same sentence ever again
Biden says all U.S. governors should mandate masks to slow coronavirus' spread
everything that comes out of Joe Biden mouth the president has already said and done he plagiarized everything he has nothing to say about anything important and he looks like a very frail senior he can barely complete a sentence
letting you know I screencapped your Biden tweets, in case it gets scrubbed....    put the heat to their feet!!!!
Maybe Biden thought this had to do with Halloween ü§î
"I learned about kids jumping on my lap" is exactly why they don't let Biden out in public any more on his own.
the only plausible harm reduction argument for voting for biden/harris is that they would certainly handle a pandemic better. if they kill thousands of people it will be because they start a war
We all miss Bernie. Biden should give him an office in the WH to fight voter suppression.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews If this does not say "vote Trump" nothing will.
#Biden and #Harris just demanded a nationwide mask mandate. Because apparently they think mandates and masks are popular  #Masks #NationwideMaskMandate

Biden in a basement. Meanwhile, Trump is actually accomplishing world peace  Read this. This is huge and historic!
If any other democrat or president did this... it would be called out... you support it.   Would you support it if biden said the same thing when your guy was leading ? Doubt it
If you can vote for 20+ years by mail like I have and my vote has been counted.... why now is it an issue when its really only trump who is worried he is gonna lose cause the writing is on the wall. He won in 2016 with the process. He knows people dislike biden. Less than clinton
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to ‚Äî wait for it ‚Äî Russia #Smartnews Putin for Trump - Putin will do whatever he can to keep his puppet, Trump
The violence is going to be off the charts when the left controls the house, senate and WH again and Fox will be an integral part of that happening. History ‚Äî as well as the near future ‚Äî will not be kind to any of them.
the postal accountability and enhancement act was passed in 2006 when biden was a senator. the administration he was vice president of did nothing about it and never tried. he's not going to save the fucking post office.
Nope. Now I‚Äôm really not voting for Biden

Hit the dab pen every time biden sniffs or awkwardly touches kamala harris or says something weird and uncalled for about her body throughout the campaign trail. That‚Äôs the only way im going to survive this hellection
My cows are all gone. I blame the Biden /Harris campaign.
I mean, Bernie lost the primary, Biden never said he supported it, he was open and honest about that all along. People chose Biden because of media narratives about "electability" which are self-fulfilling, and intervention by well liked Dems in the primary. It is what it is.
Joe picked her?  I think not. I'm sure there were those in the Biden camp did the picking for him.
If anyone said they heard her call Biden a racist their ears must be living in another dimension.
.5 sec - "I don't know why..." is the lie. Joe Biden better stay in good health, else she could be a conspirator, or I am tripping
Joe Biden is 77yo. Based on generic actuarial data (odds of death w/in the next year, based on age) there‚Äôs a 20% chance he‚Äôll die in the next four years. If we up that to 8 years, it‚Äôs 50%.
He has absolutely no idea how to handle Biden‚Äôs pick of Harris and it‚Äôs hilarious.
Until 11/3, I know who we is.  After? Will Lincoln go back to being small gov't, low tax, anti-reg, deficit hawk, climate crisis denial, neo-lib militarism, substandard health care, e.g. mainstream R?  Elect Biden/Harris and then attack?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
I'm in Oregon, an hour from Portland. I drive daily all over for business.  I've seen ONE (1) Biden sign and it was out in a small town. I pulled over to take a picture, a car passed and saw me doing it and the driver gave me the "I know, right?" gesture.  Seen 4 Bigfoot btw.
He‚Äôs seconds away from the bully pulpit and he doesn‚Äôt even mention the millions of American who struggle with low water pressure or are in the battle of their lives against stage 4 Windmill Cancer?  A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for crazy Aunt Tiffa!
neither one of them said a thing about the protest and looting Harris is going to defund the police and Biden is just one of the fine old folks neither said anything about helping America more lies and propaganda Harris flows like the wind
OOOOHH!  Keenly astute! Listen closely, She said, "Perhaps, that's what he (Joe Biden) wanted!"
He‚Äôs a racist CisHet man who‚Äôs outta touch will the majority of voters. His policies he wrote and voted for were garbage and extremely pro-police state. He picked who he picked for a reason. Centrist Dems have already told me off for ‚Äúliving in the past‚Äù about Biden.
I want Biden to make  AG OR Mr. Kirschner could be put in charge of the Trump Crimes Commission. Mr. Kirschner learned much from Robert Mueller and truly respects the Rule of Law. He‚Äôd ‚Äúlawfully and apolitically‚Äù bring Trump &amp; his crime family to justice.
You just want Biden so he‚Äôll cover up for you pervs and traffickers
Let your Democrat friends think you're voting Biden. Lie to the pollsters if you have to. We cannot afford to lose this election, but being yelled at and spit on is also inconvenient.  Smile, nod and VOTE.
To smear who? Antifa or Biden and Harris? Neither really need help in that department üôÇ
I'm not crying, you're crying. #Competence2020
Watching the Biden speech, then noticed the ad. Subliminal message or clever advertising, you decide.
Then they say that she‚Äôs too smart.  She will outshine Biden. Ok is that a backhanded compliment?  We tried really stupid for almost 4 years we need to trade up
Biden is one of the worst candidates ever but all he has to do is just sit in his basement and let Trump destroy himself. Trump used to attack attack attack and now he does is play the victim it‚Äôs sai!. These two are going to reverse every thing Trump did during his election.
You still want to put your faith in a broken, corrupt system with Biden though ? I feel the time for that is long gone  ( like decades gone). How many times do we need to keep giving them a chance to the right things, and come up with empty promises? By the People for the People
Progressives like myself.  Young, energetic voters who want real change.  She definitely excites younger more progressive voters in ways Tim Kaine couldn‚Äôt.  She may not apeal to the ‚ÄúBernie Bro‚Äôs‚Äù but she speaks to a much larger base than say...Biden or Pence.
45 is running his mouth spouting absolutes with ZERO proof Biden will do anything of the kind. üôÑ Keep in mind that 45 &amp; his boot lickers are NOT stating what 45‚Äôs agenda is for his second term. 45 et al are desperately searching for a boogie man to scare votes out of people.
Have you checked out Lars?  Here's his thoughts:
If it‚Äôs one or the other (which it isn‚Äôt) personally I‚Äôd rather keep trump, at least we already know what he‚Äôs about. Biden hasn‚Äôt actually spoken on his views much his entire campaign is just ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm not trump‚Äù which is very dangerous
Yeah, thing about that is if everyone thinks like that there would literally not be a chance, if people voted for who they actually wanted we would be able to do away with the duopoly. Personally, I couldn‚Äôt sleep at night voting for trump or Biden I would sooner not vote at all
Does any reasonable person actually believe Joe Biden would finish his first term?

Does ANY Democrat actually think Joe Biden would finish his first term?
Kamala Harris is a phony and just goes with the flow of the radical left wing also a liar and Joe Biden doesn't even know he picked her but just wait he will be sniffing her and touching her and if he wins America is done our great nation will fall
It‚Äôs almost like we shouldn‚Äôt be counting on Biden to solve those problems that may have led to Trump, but instead organize and mobilize to force whoever the people are in power to act. It‚Äôs almost like that would be way more possible if we avoid full-on fascism....

Biden first wanted Susan Rice for his VP. He was told to go with Harris who was Hillary's protege so that will be his pick. No one goes against Pelosi.

‚ÄòWe need a new direction‚Äô: GOP ex-gov John Kasich explains why he‚Äôs backing Biden over Trump -
Yes by pushing Biden left when he isn‚Äôt even elected yet they meant that the DNC would give them press access to the convention. Is that your argument and criteria for pushing Biden left? TYT‚Äôs press access?

Good God!!! Who listens to ANYTHING Scaramucci? I desperately want to see Joe Biden in the White House. I want to see 45 and his entire administration held responsible for their many crimes but Scaramucci is saying and doing nothing to add to that effort. He needs to go away.

Joe Biden's VP choice is more than likely gonna be a white lady, because he‚Äôs out of touch. We all know he should have chosen Stacy Abrams but you know, a younger strong Black woman lawyer being his VP isn't in his wheelhouse. Prepare to be underwhelmed by a centrist candidate.
The only way to stop Joe Biden is let him debate Trump   Well, not the only  Just let him talk. Period.

Biden is pro baby murder. Nuff said
I do think that‚Äôs true in part. WHEN we elect Joe Biden as POTUS, we will have a sane President again who actually cares about ALL Americans including the ones who didn‚Äôt vote for him. That said: We have a rough road ahead to mop up 45‚Äôs &amp; his admin‚Äôs messes.
Trump's cosmopolitanism is good. Non-Trump cosmopolitanism is bad. Trump misspeaking is not misspeaking, it's him doing something cosmopolitan that little liberal minds don't understand. Biden misspeaking is a sign he's brain damaged. Come on man, keep up! It's just logic.

CNN VP rips ‚Äòreally gross‚Äô attack on Joe Biden‚Äôs Catholic faith by right-wing website -
TRUMP CALLED JOE BIDEN "GODLESS"--BUT JESUS SAID,          "DO NOT JUDGE"!  Attending Church once in ten years  Trump said publicly that Biden is "Godless"! He is LYING AGAIN!.  Biden is a Devout Christian--a lifetime member of his church.  But LIARS WILL GO TO HELL, Jesus said.
Trump‚Äôs latest attack on Joe Biden is stunningly delusional ‚Äî even for him -
He is aware of the damage he will cost the good people of this nation. If he wants to get in the race to pull votes from Biden and award trump, he deserves ridicule and plenty of it.
Indeed! While VP Biden is outlining his many plans for helping America conquer COVID-19 and putting America back on track, 45 is using the same old tired game plan from 2016. Use VP Biden as the boogie man. Make up anything, no matter how outlandish. to land the vote. üëé
Live look in to Joe Biden's house where he's pacing around screaming "Grrrr, sometimes I just want to punch God so much, you know what I mean? Just like, bam, right in the kisser. I wake up and just can't stop thinking about it."

If he holds the fbi above the law then hes just another nazi dictator running a police state.
Trump and associates crimes are too severe to allowed them to walk free. There will be no Pres. Ford to pardon him, like Nixon was! Biden has already stated he will NOT stand in the way of Trump's prosecution! This is the REAL reason Trump will do ANYTHING to win reelection!

FOX's Jeanine Pirro broadcasted a Veiled Threat that Biden would not make it to the election. There were no consequences for that horrible statement. If a democratic broadcasting station said Trump will not make it to the election the FBI with guns blazing with raid their office.

Since the right wing leaders always blames others for what they are themselves guilty of doing, it is obvious right wing child molesters are behind this campaign against Biden. Not rocket science.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not allowed to criticize Biden and you‚Äôre not allowed to push him on any policies until after the election!‚Äù  Considering the fact this is the time period when he‚Äôs *releasing* his policy proposals and his various agendas, this is a terrible idea.

Obama was too charming; he made democrats lazy. Nobody likes Biden; we're going to be on his ass the entire time.

Saying Biden picked Kamala due to her sex and race instead of her qualifications is sexist and racist üôÑ
Follow at  and read  to stay up to date on election odds for Biden/Trump. One of my favorite websites.
And you still haven't said how Biden is supposed to "save it". He's been at this since 73 so if he hasn't saved it yet it's because he can't.
Wasn‚Äôt even their first choice according to David Axelrod.  Biden wanted Whitner.
Warren‚Äôs event with Biden had 50k live viewers
Joe Biden has made it clear that he's a decent human being, in contrast to the corrupt and monstrous orange clown.
Biden Harris 2020  via   poot
Seems to me that everything Biden/Harris say they are going to do is already being done. They would however lock the country down so tight that when we were allowed to come out again we would be like Cuba/Venezuela. The country can't survive either one of them. #Trump2020
Hey  , how in the exact fuck is Biden/Harris gonna save our dying planet?
Why Biden won‚Äôt M4A : These assholes right here‚¨áÔ∏è
You are my hero but I won‚Äôt be donating to Biden/Harris.   Neither of them support a wealth tax and that is my litmus test for donating. Harris is to the right of most Democrats on Israel as well. üòï
NPR talking about how financial managers are happy Biden chose Kamala Harris, I‚Äôm feeling nauseous
There was a lot of pressure from donors to pick Kamala Harris. Remember: Karen Bass is just as progressive as Warren and Biden still didn‚Äôt choose her.
that might be the secret of his success. sanders comey trump, democrats treat anyone who treats them like crap like gold. harris/biden proves they are not liberal now.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably why we‚Äôre losing now‚Äù  Biden‚Äôs ahead of Trump in the polls.  No offense but you are kind of an airhead
Knit Picks' website isn't working and I need to get sock yarn, pronto, because knitting soothes anxiety (also I want my feet to be warm when I watch Biden/Harris win in the fall). If you have a fave place, please to tell. I'm looking at you,
No, I wanna keep that way. I'm still happy from watching BIDEN/HARRIS speech earlier!!!
Great reporting. You really nailed Biden here.
biden would bring back segregation, and harris would use the fbi to clean up the cities the way trump did. democrats screwed hillary because they are god damned nazis who deserve trump.
she is better choice then joe biden and hillary clinton, she dose not have  same backlash as both them.
Overwhelmed with the POSSIBILITIES that lie ahead of America with the leadership of Biden/Harris.......They are an amazing team.....
Between absolute cruising on his bike and the speech today, Biden is looking shockingly spry headed into the final stretch here. Honestly wasn‚Äôt sure he still had this in him.
vs   in March sounds lovely! Maybe we can invite President Biden? #wearamask #voteBlue #endthisnightmare
I‚Äôm feeling more apprehension. Wall Street seems to be happy with Biden‚Äôs choice. They typically don‚Äôt have Main Street‚Äôs best interests in mind.
Soooooo happy to watch Biden/Harris speak. There is hope, it actually cheered me up!! Who knew a speech would cheer me up?? LOLüôÇ#Biden/Harris 2020
Harris makes her real-life campaign debut side-by-side with Biden  via
you pushing biden/harris onto marginalized communities is u actively not acknowledging ur privilege and putting your comfort over people‚Äôs literal lives......if u can‚Äôt understand that i have no idea what to tell you
So everybody, please vote for what you believe in not the "lesser of 2 evils". Make your vote count and your voice be heard. If you do believe in Trump or Biden and vote the one you believe in then at least you are doing what you think is best and I will still support you.
He‚Äôs explaining why we won‚Äôt vote for Biden.
I‚Äôm all for pushing for progressive legislation, but bagging on Biden‚Äôs 1994 crime bill vote or saying Harris is a cop after they are chosen as THE ONLY GODT-DAMNED TICKET THAT CAN PRESERVE OUR DEMOCRACY is what Putin wants. Save it for November 5th.
Why not have Biden do that, he is after all the supposed POTUS candidate? Also, should Harris address her accusations that Biden is a racist and at least a sexual assaulter?
The people have spoken. Biden maybe won't listen.. Trump will actively not listen.  And if Biden does not listen, our protests will very likely have a larger impact on a Biden administration.  It's so obvious what the right choice is. And abstaining in November is not it.
You‚Äôve implied multiple times that young people‚Äôs opinions don‚Äôt matter so why are you so pressed about my tweets? Biden and Harris both ran terrible campaigns, they are only succeeding because Trump, in comparison, is a total disaster. There is no enthusiasm for Biden. None.
You seem to have a problem with any criticism of Biden/Harris.   Do you think they are infallible?  Do you think we should be prohibited from saying anything negative about them?  Since you have so much disdain for young people, why do you reply to my tweets?
And the only way to change that is to have Biden move further to the Left to entice them.  This is the alternative
No, I think it‚Äôs healthy to point out dissatisfaction with the VP choice because it will only pressure Biden to move further left. The 100,000+ people that retweeted those anti-Kamala memes probably aren‚Äôt thrilled about voting for Biden
She actually won't unless Biden dies. Are you looking for that to happen?
It really is dependent on the president.  Some presidents allow their VPs to have more power and influence, some don't.  If Biden has selected Warren (or Karen Bass!) that wouldve signaled a willingness to be more progressive.  Instead he chose Kamala Harris, an empty suit.
I know Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are both terrible politicians but please vote Democratic downballot in November üòî
Biden and Harris will be the best thing to happen to America sense Obama and Biden left office
Of course it is a shell game. But now we know it and time has come to change the game. This election is only part of it. But if Trump is elected again, the USA is dead and gone. At least with Biden, there is someone who will listen. Everything will change sooner than expected.
That Harris pick yesterday, hit Trump supporters like rabies! And yet, they know they would have hated ANYONE Biden picked.
Nothing about what I‚Äôve said implies I‚Äôm not voting for Biden. We should be allowed to criticize the ticket
I believe that is the boat a lot of us are in. So, responding to every angry tweet with how if someone doesn't vote for Harris/Biden they will be ensuring mass deaths is really not necessary.  We know. We're angry and tired as hell, but we know.
Let me make this clear:  I am angry as hell that Kamala Harris was selected as VP.  But, me continually talking about just how pissed I am does NOT change my vote this November. I am still voting for Biden - I'm just even angrier about it than I was before.
Doesn‚Äôt attract any voter who wasn‚Äôt already planning to vote for Biden. Young voters and progressives do not trust her
DwellerYsul, BULL HOCKEY! There was no infighting because the people pulling the strings on the Biden puppet were in full agreement. They knew enough not to bicker and put their brilliant plan to retake the WH in jeopardy. His only choice, if any, was for the prettiest one.
I don't ordinarily display political signs, but I ordered a Biden/Harris sticker, and I will display it proudly, full of hope! #BidenHarris2020
You can be angry with the VP choice and still vote for Biden.  Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt support student debt relief, a wealth tax, or Medicare for All.  Her record as attorney general and DA has a lot of blemishes.   But at least she‚Äôs better than Mike Pence!
Yeah I‚Äôm voting for Biden as well
Oh yeah, Kamala is Joe Biden's little blue pill for sure.
I haven‚Äôt seen a single Warren person say they‚Äôre voting for Trump because of the Kamala VP choice  I have seen a ***lot*** of tweets from young people expressing their disdain and anger at Biden for his decision.
The way he uses stupid childish names to insult Biden and Kamala is beyond belief.
Let me debunk this lie:  Kamala Harris recorded her endorsement video for Joe Biden *before* Warren dropped out.
This comparison doesn‚Äôt feel right. I mean Biden is 71% campaigning in the background, so adjusted for that it seems he is doing much better.
CNN drops the death ticker the instant Biden is elected.
I know people in my own life that supported Biden and Kamala in the primaries and argued with me for months that didn‚Äôt even bother to register to vote in the primaries. These are deeply unserious people.
Joe is a friend to Wall St though...
You can't blame her for what has been in place for decades. But I sure as hell know that she and Biden are not Trump and are more open to change and reason. Get rid of Trump and the GOP in the Senate and the rest is much easier.
Criticize Harris and Biden but never forget the existential crisis we‚Äôre in right now. I‚Äôm voting for Biden and Harris and you should too. Then we‚Äôll protest them too.
Biden had overwhelming black support in the south, specifically South Carolina. Across the country it was evenly split between him and Bernie.  Trump won suburban white women last time but the polling is showing he‚Äôs lost them.
Another liar. I bet you the farm that Biden did NOT say that.
And you're calling BIDEN racist. Give me a break, you lying hypocrite.
When will the Democratic candidates for President and Vice President receive security protection? Biden perhaps already has it because he‚Äôs a Former Vice President. Kamala Harris will need it immediately because of all of Trump‚Äôs crazy second amendment thugs. üëÄüëÄ
i‚Äôve written out like a dozen draft tweets about the author of how to be an anti-racist supporting biden/harris and i just...... please........ why..............
That‚Äôs not gonna help fight against Biden‚Äôs lack of cognitive ability. He can‚Äôt get that back. Lol
no kate this is simply NOT POSSIBLE and i won‚Äôt entertain the thought for a SINGLE SECOND! i‚Äôm too busy settling for biden and thinking it‚Äôs an effective strategy to encourage disillusioned nonvoters!
