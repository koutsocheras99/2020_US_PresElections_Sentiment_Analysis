holding dems accountable for tilting right is deff an important conversatuon to have, but while mcconnell is still in power it, doesnt matter?  the v progressive house relief bill passed in MAY has been just sitting in a drawer  biden sucks but if he can beat trump AND mcconnell?
Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
Now do trump
16 top Trump officials have voted by mail or requested absentee ballots:  Trump Pence  Barr  McEnany Conway  Ivanka Melania Azar Ross DeVos McDaniel Kushner  Glassner Stepien Ayers Parscale  #hipocrits
Trump can't Type, OR Spell OR Read OR Speak English ... we hear he's REALLY Good at Snorting #Adderall though ...
Yep, another ignorant and childish comment from the small percentage of immature Trump supporters!
DONE WITH TRUMP!
Trump‚Äôs federal shock troops prompt renewed calls to dismantle Homeland Security  by
Trump train is rolling full speed ahead!
I‚Äôm not into Soviet kitsch, and i find authoritarian communism abhorrent so I‚Äôm not into using the hammer and sickle. Im one of those dangerous anarchists (libertarian socialists) that trump warned you about.
When the 2008 primaries happened, I didn‚Äôt believe a black person could be elected, because I thought our country was too racist. I cried when Pres. Obama won. That was a one time cry of joy.   I‚Äôve been crying constantly for 4 years because Trump proved me right and then some.
Now you‚Äôre just straight up lying. Sort of like Trump.
biden sucks but what other option is there today? vote not for him but for:   - rbg can retire  - aoc warren and bernie can send progressive legislation to biden's desk instead of mcconnell's  - slow progress under biden bs inmediate fascism if trump stays in office
to say nothing of merrick garland, kavamaugh's bought and paid for seat, trump's impeachment acquittal in the senate, and on and on, well before you get to mcconnell's OWN crimes
unless trump and the gop make a MASSIVE course correction like, tomorrow? and tbh probably even if? trump looks set to take the gop senate majority down with him  the dems in the house and senate have spent TEN YEARS trying and failing to get legislation past mcconnell
Truly - sad.  In my layman's opinion, it's manslaughter and Trump + the GOP are guilty
Our great leader.
I‚Äôve been there. The photo showed trump/Barr goons.  Oregon state troopers have not yet shown up.  Admit that your statement is wrong.  TRUE reply: Portland police used the same dirty tricks.  Don‚Äôt tell me to pay attention - that is being arrogant.
Expose Antifa? Does he even know what it means? What a dope.  Antifa=Antifascist. Like, anti Hitler. Anti Mussolini. Anti tRump*.
I have never seen anything like it, Trump haters blame him for everything.  Let's give em 4 more years! #KAG2020
Why is  remodeling when he will be moving out in January?  Seems stupid to me.  Oh right... it‚Äôs Trump üôÑü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #WeWillVote
Trump was saving it up for Herman Cain.
Thank you President Trump! The governor and mayor and rest of the idiot crew hate law abiding citizens here!
Me too. So did anyone else that was paying attention. Trump is, was and will always be a creep and criminal.
what about the PPB? the police violence did not start with the feds. things were bad before president trump you know.
Don‚Äôt forget that Alan Dershowitz was Trump‚Äôs impeachment attorney.  Also, I TOLD Y‚ÄôALL
You're repeating 2016.  Endorsing Biden then when he loses they will blame you and say you didn't do enough.   Pack your bags up for neoliberal centrists please. Just because Trump is worse doesn't mean you have to settle.   You wouldn't want your grandkids to settle..
Trump's version of October's Surprise will also be nothing but lies. GOP Trumpers =corruption.
President Donald Trump gave Oregon State Police two days to "clean out this beehive of terrorists."  Gov. Kate Brown did not respond publicly to Trump. About 30 minutes before the president's remarks, she tweeted a picture of a dog.
Kansas‚Äô conservative GOP Secretary of State isn‚Äôt drinking Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúelection delay‚Äù Kool-Aid. #DemCastKS
You know we don't ever believe your version of the story right?  "Putin pays trump" was the last truthful thing you said.
i don't want to yell at my friend on fb but, "obama made trump possible" is the same logic as "black voters passed prop 8", obama's not-that-progressive policies were definitely a factor, but let's lay the majority of the blame for trump where it belongs: mitch mcconnell
Just drove by the federal courthouse the police already gave up the 2 parks they cleared today. The feds will be back out in force tonight. The National Guard will be federalized.
Trump never keeps any promises he makes to others. He's always only been interested in getting away with his grifts. GOP obliged and proved they're as greedy as he.
The eventual film about Trump as president
Humiliate Trump and the Republicans.  Vote them all out of office on November 3.
Tell Trump supporters that Trump wanted to postpone the election and he succeeded. The election is suspended for the benefit of Trumpers. They don't have to be inconvenienced to vote so they don't need fear getting Trump's fake virus. Pass it on.
The great pandemic of 2016... oh wait 2020? Who left them so carelessly empty for four years? Funny how you believe ‚Äúfake‚Äù news has been planted for years as a plan. If they had the resources to do that do you honestly believe they‚Äôd not have a better way?
Trump Can't Postpone The Election, But He Can Delegitimize The Results.
But, you should ignore these doctors and trust Trump and his hunches. Besides, the crazy demon sex, alien DNA lady endorsed him, so you know he's gotta be correct. Amirite??? I mean what do the FDA, CDC and NIH know? They're only the best medical professionals in the world.
And obviously you will add Trump to the list as soon as he's "free!"
Yes like DONALD TRUMP
I adore you, but I don't understand why you're under the delusion they will leave. Not only will they not, but #Trump needs the optics so one way or another he'll find a way to get the National guard in here.
Trump resorts, perhaps?üëø
Are you an American citizen? Bc Trump's America YOU are not welcome.. matter of fact, Trump has a cage just for you.
Trump did this!
Trump killed him. And parscale
Me, too.  No holds barred w/Trump. I LOVE that emoji.  Nobody uses it...
Remember when Trump said the coronavirus would just disappear?
Omg, he is literally describing exactly what he and trump do, lol.  How does anyone take him seriously, I'm embarrassed for him! ü§£ #TuckerCarlsonFoxNewsLiar
Remember that one time Trump told the truth? Yeah, me neither
Top story: Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.  see more
Because we still run by the constitution ;) Pandemic and all... But States could change the way they vote But that's on the state's and not Trump...
Who is afraid of that asshole? Stop being afraid! #nofear Fearing Trump interference, FBI agents hid copies of Russia investigation docs
And Trump continues to retain his services because like attracts like, and those two go way, way, back, with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Let's not forget, Trump just "wished her well" after her arrest for procuring minor girls for Epstein. His rot knows no bottom.
I predicted Trump would call to delay the election.   I predicted he'd use Border Patrol as a paramilitary force on political dissidents.   I predicted the toothless response from Democrats making this possible.   I've been waiting to be wrong, but I'm not. Trump's a fascist.
Trump Spirals Into Gibberish When Reporter Busts Him For Still Not Having A Coronavirus Strategy
Johnny Dakota would have voted for Trump no doubt
Trump loves you. He loves the uneducated.
Well, we know what the Dershowitz documents mean, tRUmp will be offering him his best wishes and a position in the WH any time now.
Trump didn't win, Clinton lost and gerrymandering combined gutting all kinds of security, access to and forms of capital over 40 years is to blame along with a truly lazy campaign w a shit politician. We'd still have a dying planet, a giant pandemic and a depression regardless.
This immoral dude made a failed, bankrupt, con man into some titan of industry and has sat on all the b roll footage for a decade.  He‚Äôs literally the reason Trump was even a glimmer of a candidate in 2015.
Federalist Society was put in charge of providing Trump all his judges.
Do either of you think anyone will be escorted out of a DHS office tomorrow? Next week? Or are they just going to punt this to the voters like the Senate did with Trump in January?
Longest for trump? Hard to believe longest for all presidents.
This "study" seems like less of a genuine inquiry and more like it's intended to prove Trump wrong. Otherwise you'd factor in things like Antifa membership not being common knowledge and they're ALWAYS HERE doing the same exact shit for 10 years.  Source: I live in Portland.
Currently on r/Portland: "Portland Museum calls for an outdoor movie night on Friday. Bee Movie, after trump calls Portlanders a "beehive of terrorists"" #Portland
Rarely has one man been so profoundly, loudly and consistently wrong in a time when people of real moral courage and intellect are needed.   should be ashamed of his conduct during the time of Trump. Truly the worst type of enabler.
this is like inverse qanon, where you recognize that donald trump and the people he knows have been the ones responsible for so many horrifying and disgusting crimes and root for him to be arrested and rat them all out.
Why are the hot ones always Trump Supportersüò©
an interesting thing that just dawned on me is that if donald trump were ever indicted, you know that he'd be giddy to narc on every single rich and powerful person he's ever met, for everything they've ever done, if only to bring them down, too.  that's... a lot of people.
you forgot about all the people Trump has fired. THEY DONT GET A FUCKING PASS just because bunker baby turned on them.
Donald Trump will always put Donald Trump first. Narcissism is ugly.
Correct they are white people and college students run, educated, and led by local and non local college professors who profess terrorist views. Defund liberal public school systems.
They'll never get the point. That's the problem with this country. These people actually believe that trump and his posse care about them. It's pathetic.
Trump killed him. Have more rallies.
Trump is Trump but how do we deal with the 40% of Americans as sick as he is?
well, that would be nice, if tRump would actually quit blaming someone and take responsibility. We will wait forever for that. Let's not.

Why Trump Has No Power to Delay the 2020 Election
Wait, you mean you don't like it when people you disagree with do exactly what you and your buddy Trump do?  So you're just another GOP Snowflake is what you're saying? Got it, thanks.
Wow.. so your attempt to have validity to your words is to create a narrative of me being a liar. Poor thing.  Your anger and deflection of responsibility to Trump shows your inability to allow another's voice. It's a instant attack to damage someone elses view.
Funny they said the same about Clinton in 2016 and Trump won. The silent majority always wins and nobody wants Sleepy Joe that has a brain.
In Oregon we have drop off boxes - they are picked up daily. They are easy to get to and you can vote early or drop off your ballot on Election Day. Do other states have them? I use them so I don‚Äôt have worry about it being lost in the mail. And you can track it online.

Our city was under siege from relentless, violent protests by Anarchist and Antifa radicals long before Trump was elected. Your failure to lead this state and protect private property is just another example of why Trump will be re-elected. People are sick of the lawlessness.
Barron trump &amp; Herman Cain
I really hope Trump's kids (the oldest 3) AND JARED are charged, tried, and spend some contemplative time somewhere awful.
Very few Republicans are homeless. They need to create a new party but trust is long gone. We should never have another Republican president. The betrayal is real. Silence on Putin's bounties, prioritizing a building over people's lives. Most deserve what Trump did to GOP.
A Portland protestor is my hero!                                                    I‚Äôm still here and they‚Äôre leaving. I‚Äôd say that whatever it was they came to do, they didn‚Äôt do it,‚Äù said Amy Tulip, wearing a helmet and gas mask, and holding a ‚ÄúFuck Trump, Fuck the Feds‚Äù sign.
Planet Trump.
That Trump only cares about himself is a given but his cult followers don‚Äôt get a pass. Like Cain, they have access to information &amp; make the choice to ignore scientists and their own eyes. Trump makes it harder to get the truth but they chose not to look.
What happened to just the opposite of what the postal service stands for and is still one of the most reliable services that exists humans delivering mail to your door please leave them alone Trump help them it means job and affordability two Americans think about that.
You are part of the problem that brought us treasonous trump. So what you say means absolutely nothing.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.
Pete,look this so I believe Mr Biden future President  Mr Bernie  and you is necessary be very careful with this criminal Bolsonaro another criminal and the minister of foreign affairs of Brazil.His name Ernesto Araujo a great liar and ally of Trump Very careful
Yeah I would love to have the "same mechanism" as Trump, who's dad gave him all the money he needed both in life and in death.   The rich protect the rich, enrich the rich, and the little guy desperately believes the trickle down lie.

House Democrats with vote of some Republicans passed HEROES Act 2 months ago which includes unemployment relief. Why didn't you push your friend Trump n Sen McSally n other fellow Republicans to get something done over the past 2 months?? You're a failure Ducey.
The thing that is the most frustrating is everyone knows the system is intentionally broken and rigged for as long as any of us has been alive and idealists don't exist in this world except those sympathetic to kids trauma and with it got triple exploited by way of Trump w QAnon
I‚Äôm going to take it up a level President Trump and say because I don‚Äôt think anyone told you when you were growing up that they loved you. Well I love you and I mean it but can we do things differently cuz I don‚Äôt like all the hate. Thx üôèüèª

They're moms standing there with locked arms while a cobbled-together assembly of border patrol, mercenaries, and US Marshals gasses them and shoot them in the face. The domestic terrorists are Trump's goons.
If tRump dies from COVID-19 we can call it Herman‚Äôs revenge....does that answer the question?
He said trump would try it you political hack. You claimed that was insane. You prove you share trumps inability to admit you were wrong, sociopath
Sorry guys but Trump ruined Twitter and I really feel for Jack Dorsey because he‚Äôs the President! So it‚Äôs like walking on broken glass. Just curious  are you proud of all the hate and animosity you create? I‚Äôve never heard a single loving word spoken from you
Wait why do so many of you think you're the only one who predicted Trump would try to delay the election?

But they‚Äôve turned it to NOPE and I can deal with that! NOPE to Trump
I think the WH will need to be fumigated after trump leaves!
In tRump*'s America, you'll end up in jail, or in the grave.
That just uncertainty has entered his mind at this moment in #Trump's 4 year crime spree of #Corrupt actions against #America's #Democracy &amp; #RuleOfLaw says so much about how out of whack  #WillHerd's moral compass is.
I actually think Putin has trump on a very short leash. Trump sold his soul long ago to Russia/putin.
if you are saying I am lying, I'm not sure what to say to you. Clearly, you have drank the Trump/Republican koolaid.  I can't persuade someone with their head up their Clavin! :)
Who paid for the gazillion doses of Hydroxychloroquine we now have in our stockpile? Where is this stuff being stored? Did our market-grab cause shortages for patients who actually need it? Did Trump just wave his sharpie and buy it? #AmericasFrontlineDoctors #Hydroxychloroquine

trump will try to tear down our democracy. it is up to us to stop him.
Herman Cain sacrificed his life to Covid-19 to save the economy on the day the worst ever quarterly GDP contraction was announced. Clearly we need our "best" economic minds on this. Lt. Governor of Texas, you're up, followed by Mnuchin, Navarro, Pence, Barr, Pompeo, and Trump.
Trump wants kids to go back to school , he don't care about them but says postpone voting .  He only cares about himself .
Trump called US citizens in Portland Or. terrorists tonight.  Let that sink in.
Filthy, despicable Trump administration slime. Trust me, dude. You already have the "German WWII" crowd solidly behind you. Another one for the tribunals. 2021.
Has Trump seriously still not addressed Herman Cain's death?
Apparently rules and laws don't apply to you.  This promotion by a President is a no no.  Shame on you.  Bad, bad trump.

As an Oregonian that has been able to vote-by-mail his entire adult life I can tell you it has worked great here in Oregon. We have had 12 cases of voter fraud since we passed vote-by-mail in 2000. The GOP &amp; Trump are afraid of higher turnout which usually favors Democrats
You can take Trump's election saber-rattling seriously or not, but I know this much is true:  nobody threatens to call off the game when they're winning.
Hes lying David, its just like trump claiming there are violent mobs in portland. Its propaganda
Thank you President Trump!!!

Trump will stop at nothing to stay in the White House.  #TrumpsEvilPlan
Following science means that decisions are made based on facts.   For Trump &amp; the GOP, facts are often inconvenient &amp; almost always irrelevant. Their only considerations are money &amp; power.  From  #TrumpHatesScience #DemCast
I dunno man, at least Bush instituted a coherent government pandemic response plan with a team at the ready. He was serious about that shit. Obama kept it, built on it.   Trump basically threw it out. Maybe the grass is just always danker on the other side, know what I mean?
Are you seriously making fun of books as a resource for learning? Wow, no wonder you're a Trump supporter, you've probably never read a book in your life. I'm surprised you can even read this Twitter thread. Also, you might want to learn the difference between "dam" and damn."
Trump is a total embarrassment! #EvictTrump
Hi. Pete, how are you ? I'm From Brazil.The criminal government of the genocidal Bolsonaro is a great traitor to the Brazilian people.Thousands are dying every day.He denies the existence of the covid 19. Bolsonaro is helping Trump .look.
The difference between king David whose pride killed 70k Israelites and king Trump whose pride is still killing Americans... is David immediately repented and showed remorse. I can't wait until I get to cast my vote against this terrible, pride-filled man in office.

#Republicans allowed Trump to hijack their party for the lol value of pissing off the Dems, while not noticing that he, with malicious intent and glee, destroyed Conservatism.
#Trump doesn't lead. He follows #Putin
Andy is a well know provocateur who plays off of fascists to bait antifascists and anyone not dead set against them.  Like Trump, he lies and creates dangerous rumors then plays the victim when people react to his role in that.
"Oregon is a Dem state where people are thrown into vans" is an especially counterproductive point to make when it is Trump's storm troopers who are doing the throwing
Trump may not technically have the power to delay the election but he's itching to have a reason to declare martial law, &amp; the fact that he even suggested postponing the national election for the first time in American history should alarm everyone regardless of party line.
Trump has outperformed only in his cruelty, ineptitude and ability to embarrass the nation.  The day he is rejected by the electorate will be a fine day.
Trump was never a Conservative. Trump was never a Republican, not a Democrat. Trump is only, always and ever, an opportunist.
If trump moves the election, it‚Äôs time us to take action.
#Showmeyourportland - A hot summer afternoon in Portland. During the day, the courthouse is peaceful. At night over a 2 or 3 block distance downtown only, there are protests. The city is not burning down. Violent anarchists are fantasies. Trump is lying, as per usual.

Hint: 2-1/2 weeks ago Trump said he would be releasing the bold new health care plan he has been promising for 4 years.  I'm sure he'll have an idea about boosting UI benefits right after he finishes off his health care insurance plan.
Hey there #StevenCalabresi of   I could have saved you years of misplaced obeisance and avoided you this humiliation: Trump is, and always has been, a really bad guy. Since the 80's, man. You would have seen it, if you had only looked. Or, you could have just asked me.

Those are the black guys that kinda are pro trump and pro white?   It's kinda hard to explain.   Hoteps are black dudes that call out the black crime in Chicago for example.  Or they mention that whites actually get shot more by police.   Loved by conservatives.. highly monitized
Hint: 2-1/2 weeks ago Trump said he would be releasing the bold new health care plan he has been promising for 4 years.  How about never? Does never work for you?  Pretty sure that's what he meant.
i'm fine with this. and if i die from covid, please hurtle my rotting corpse at trump and his entire administration.
I'm a Republican who didn't want either of the main 2016 candidates and think that the EC needs to be re-evaluated with 65.8 million Hillary to 62.9 m Trump. Granted Trump had 30 states to Hillary's 20, but the EC should have been a little closer than 227 -304. EC has problems.

What a slime ball.  And Dems have the temerity to say Trump has no class.
Auto-text correction is the worst. I know you meant to type Donald Trump
Strange how many, "jokes" that Trump has acted on.  It's almost like he trials asinine ideas as jokes so that when he does them, no one is surprised and they don't get as much press as they otherwise might.  Also, they deflect from things like the horrible numbers released today.
Open the polling stations back up, now. Get mail in ballots out now. Time for trump to be held accountable for his crimes. Thank you Liz!!
Typical idiotic and childish comment from some of the Trump lovers. Some Trump supports I respect, others like you...judging by this comment is the small percentage of the lunatics!
Did you notice something?  The last time Trump bailed on a female reporter like that, his supporters were all over Twitter, bragging about how he'd 'owned the lamestream media' and even posting cartoons about it.  This time...practically NOTHING!  Why was that?
Chris Ruddy.... here's another Trump fucking idiot talking about how Trump's done such a great job with the pandemic. What a dumb "saving his job" piece of shit!

Trump behavior  need to lose
I'm smug,authoritarian and don't give a shit about anyone but myself and my Lord and Master,Trump.
He's really stoking it, too. I wonder how long the Right can keep it up w/o Trump's aid.  If he does lose the election my concern is he will start his own fascist party.  All sorts of ü¶ß will be joining &amp; that's what America is abt BUT they carry AK-15s &amp; AR-47s+ &amp; have no sense!
Thank you for your political analysis, person who thinks Trump has secretly arrested Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for child trafficking.
Republicans need to stop playing politics and actually take nationwide action against Trump's legacy:  the Covid19 pandemic!
You're right. I have "Boycott The Apprentice-Donald Trump" group in FB  back in 2011.   I don't have "Boycott Who's Line Is It Anyway-Ryan Stiles"   So you need to run.

May be the one truth Trump's ever told. I actually believe him.

WHY did Trump wait month, after month, saying" it will go away in a couple of days," or it's "A Hoax perpetrated by the Democrats?"  Republicans loyal to Trump are dying right along with Democrats!

Trump feared that more testing would only lead to higher case counts &amp;more bad publicity. Meanwhile, Dr. Deb Birx, WH coronavirus response coordinatorwas reportedly sharing models w/sr staff that optimistically&amp; erroneously, it would turn out predicted virus would soon fade away.
Interesting.... Trump has been carpet bombing us with his inane whining for 4 long years.  Then Obama speaks for an hour and they have the nerve to say something about it?   Fuck all the way off!
This is what the left has in store for us. Wake up hate trump, But love our COUNTRY MORE PLEASE.
BTW, You‚Äôre confusing me with Trump, who has actually destroyed millions of lives with his narcissistic incompetence.  Agent Orange, I call him.
It made me sick to my stomach. I just waited 10 days for #COVID19 test results. I am fortunate to have been negative &amp; able to have stayed home while waiting for results. Meanwhile, Trump has instant testing at the WH.
I was thinking the same thing... Ignore Trump tweets...
as easily digestible as it would be to believe that everything when to sh!t because of Trump...
Trump has lambasted the prime ministers of every allie that we have but never uttered a single sentence or issues one tweet being even mildly critical of Putin and Russia. Trump would call his own mother names so for him to never criticize Putin is as telling as anything
VERIFY: Video purports to show Trump on hot mic criticizing supporters over masks
Russia sanctions.  Christmas Eve sanction relief on Russian Oligarach responsible for troll farms. Trump refuses to give a single reason for this move. Abandon Kurdish allies to Turks genocidal slaughter and bases in Syria to Russia. Response to Putin bounties on soldiers - fake
Tell me why I tweeted abt disliking Trump and literal secret services called my PARENTS and showed up at my old house and scared the shit out my old landlords
Now there is more to spend at Trump properties now.
Way more likely that Trump doesn‚Äôt know how any of this works and pulled that out of his keester to gin up his base.
By the amount of jubberish and lies that Trump talks......he wouldn‚Äôt either!
Trump has an evil 3-step plan to get re-elected ü§¨  #TrumpsEvilPlan  Brutal new film from
Trump taught his kids to dehumanize their opponents and treat them accordingly. It makes sense that his prized daughter would marry a hateful, weaselly man who does the same.
Inauguration Day - first act cut anti Assad fighters funding. Syria falls in first 40 days of Trunp presidency.  Refuses to make even statement implicating Russia in Nerve attacks on UK soil Read Helsinki transcripts where Trump sides with Putin over our DOJ.  refusal implement
This is what I want to hear. That someone is watching over the country as Trump and the Republicans tear it into shreds. Bless you Elizabeth Warren. I won‚Äôt forget your support for us.
#EvictTrump Trump &amp; GOP have treated a health emergency as a political tool. "United States?" Because I am in Dem. state, my life doesn't count to POTUS' son-in-law. We shd flood the streets of DC TODAY &amp; demand his removal-- but the virus prevents us.
Not just Trump. States, Cities, and Counties. All levels of Government in both Democrat and Republican areas need to do more. For example; City and State Police need to enforce mask laws. Resturants and Bars need to close. Stores need curb side ONLY.
Who in the hell cares whether Trump accepts the outcome of the Election.He has no power over it.
Says the guy that shits in golden toilets and hasn‚Äôt worked a day in his life. Unless you consider getting a golf ball out of a sand trap work. FUCK DONALD TRUMP!!!!
Kim Jong un also said we're in for a surprise in October  , makes me think Kim's going to bomb us and trump knows it and will go to Russia to watch .  Don't put nothing past a man with a Hitler mantality .
I could write a book, listing out all of the instances where Trump refused to confront Putin and gave Russia everything they wanted even though it was against our or our allies interests but what is the point.
Exactly. Trump will never get my vote. #DumpTrump2020!
Did you see Trump's 'Trojan Horse' ad on Joe Biden?  Neither did anyone else.  Meanwhile, whenever a new anti-Trump ad from The Lincoln Project or MeidasTouch hits the net, it goes instantly viral.  Trump's minions can 'review and fine-tune' all they want; it won't do any good.
Ah, the heroes trying to take down America. Again, I ask that you please miss the sarcasm in the way I said that.

You know damn well Speaker Pelosi isn't going to piss away a nanosecond on another impeachment when we have depression-level unemployment and a pandemic. If these "federalists" really want Trump out of there, they'll have to force an audit of the RNC.
Trump respects nothing, he's a monster, he's our Hitler, he's human garbage.  American's don't respect the authority of monsters.
The irony to me about the kneeling issue is that if the right/Trump had adopted kneeling for the anthem in the name of the "military" or "2a" rights all these losers saying they're done with sports would be slobbering all over the idea.

Despite trump, not because of him.  Epstein, Trump's buddy &amp; partner in sex crimes, was arrested *despite * trump being president.
Sorry. I'm trying to remind everyone that this is a standard Trump tactic, and I've been overzealous with which posts get my copy-pasted message.
This is the guy who makes the list of judges that trump picks from!
You're absolutely right. The protests were starting to mellow out until Trump sent in the Feds. Since then the hype is raised the stakes are raised and the tactics are being learned and adapted every single day.
If tRUmp has lost the Federalist Society, he is in VERY SERIOUS TROUBLE!
Buh bye Trump. Start packing!
we wil be here waiting...we aint leaving #DefendPDX  #fuck12
neither is trump, your conspiracy theory was debunked.
Oh how dare Donald Trump‚Äôs administration health experts bother to protect us by advising us to wear a mask blame the Dems but Republicans want to govern what a woman can do with her own body? Afraid of the declining birth rate of the white race.
How‚Äôs that economy? -33% GDP - HISTORY!  So why you voting for Trump now. Not the ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù. You‚Äôre racist!  He took your job, your healthcare, your home, your right to protest, now he‚Äôs taking your right to vote &amp; FINALLY he‚Äôll take your guns. Dictators don‚Äôt allow guns stupid.
MSM includes Fox ya know
Do not contribute in any way, shape, or form to trump's campaign to convince Americans there is a threat to Portland from #BlackLivesMatter protests. Portland is not under threat from its own people &amp; we do not deserve brutal police violence from state, local, or federal cops.
Today, 10 miles north of #Portland on I-5, the primary West Coast interstate.  It's been there for as much of the 15 years I have lived in the PDX area as I can remember.  Not a post Trump problem re: white supremacy in our community, or their connection w/
Currently on r/Portland: "Trump just called Portlanders "beehive of terrorists"....." #Portland

I get that a lot of people don‚Äôt want ‚Äúa revolution*‚Äù but I‚Äôm also fully convinced that our failing systems and ideologies will continue to fail and that a return to the status quo before trump will solve none of our pressing problems beyond trump himself.
Trump treats protesters here the same way. You‚Äôre asking for help from the wrong man. Especially since these are not white protesters.
Postal Service backlog sparks worries that ballot delivery could be delayed in November. IMO, this is a Koch/Trump plan to try and delay the 2020 Presidential election. If Barr &amp; Republicans allow this to happen? They can tie it up for years in the courts.

Every single female in the running is "polarizing" to R's . Actually, every single Democrat, make or female, is polarizing to R's , &amp; would have some human flaw that trump would prey on. So..... Might as, well ignore them, since they won't vote Dem.
I found that test Trump said he did so well on.   Passed the Prick test with flying colors.
Please don't act as if the GOP cares about the constitution, they threw away their constitutional oversight to fall in line with a corrupt criminal pres. The GOP couldn't care less that Trump subverts the constitution to put tax dollars in his back pocket.
In my rural Oregon community, a neighbor had installed a hand-painted, wooden BLM sign which was subsequently vandalized with ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù in **orange** paint. Later it was destroyed.   Today they installed a BLM flag, attached to a tree, 25 feet up üí™.

Thank you President Trump!!! #FakeNews doesn't control the narrative üëèüá∫üá∏
Litterally. They do nothing to satisfy their constituents, they just tell Trump to stay out of it, while they leave police on the front lines. At some point though the police have to realize their being used to protect injustice.
As usual, the crook only makes deals to reneg. Feel free to continue getting your ass handed to you in Portland.
Love to see him debate Trump.
You repeated lies of AG Barr &amp;Sen. Graham when they falsely claimed FBI investigation began w/ Steele dossier. You kept repeating this idiotic defense even after it became painfully evident Trump team welcomed Russia‚Äôs interference in American democracy and tried to cover it up.
there‚Äôs so much double speak going on between Kate talking out of both side of her mouth then chads declaration and Trump with the national guard threat
Not gonna lie it would make my fucking day if I got blocked by 45 because of all the hate tweets I send trumpy trump‚Äôs way.
Where is the Trump brown nosers at?
From a human who reads and is on the ground in Portland ... prepare yourself for tRump getting 4 more years. Don't get mad at me. If üí© don't radically change in 95 days prepare yourself for a shock.  And I'd lay my life down to get Biden into office &amp; I'm not a fan.
based on what information?? Name another global pandemic virus that relied upon HERD IMMUNITY to slow down the rate of death.
Why hasn't Trump's  tweet been taken down by Twitter?
Trump, please save us all a lot of pain and suffering and just drop out.
We can postpone the election. Trump's term, and that of Pence, is four years. Then it's done. Come next January, it's President Pelosi until we can have an election. #PresidentPelosi
1,113 dead from covid today so far only 5:46 in the west . Record death all because Trump's an idiot .
Gotta admit, if I could round up every GOP member of congress along with the entire Trump administration, send them all out to see on a cargo ship and sink it, I would do it in a heartbeat.
I think they‚Äôd prefer it. Puts Trump completely out of their minds even more quickly
The Chinese government isn't responsible for safeguarding American lives, Trump is, and he's failed horribly.
did tucker carlson start making himself orange to appeal to trump? every photo i see of him he is more and more orange
I can‚Äôt retweet because I can‚Äôt stand looking at this guy, he‚Äôs such a pussy for Trump...
Trump is responsible for all the deaths on his watch
No Pardon for Trump
No but Trump &amp; the GOP made a contribution. However,  Cain was an educated adult who had access to information on the virus, he knew he was in a high risk category and no one forced him to go to the rally. Personal responsibility is a real thing.
He's busy protecting confederate statues.  Personally I hold Chief Justice John Roberts responsible for all of Trump's actions since the trial. He allowed the GOP to exonerate him when he should have been removed.
The LP is funny while killing Trump in the latest.
You are doing a fantastic job. Ignore Trump‚Äôs mouth-breathing base.
Setting the stage to challenge the election and maintain FOREVER that the election was RIGGED against him. Bloomberg can spend his pledged billion to fly us all to the White House to personally remove Trump from the bunker on January 20th.
It could be Nov 2, 2020 and trump &amp;barr will find something to blame on Obama! They have no accountability or shame whatsoever!
Nixon did shit like that and we forced him to resign. Why does Trump get a free pass?
This is what we are in for from now through election day.... The Trump administration is suing in Pennsylvania to NOT ALLOW people to drop off their ballots into a ballot box. This is insanity! Here in Portland many, many drop their ballots into ballot boxes.
We basically already have thanks to Pres. Trump
It is Trump's time that is almost up there sunshine.  You guys have been manipulated to that he is saving our country, when in reality he is actively destroying it.
Trump keeps his enemies close. Fauci is likely not a friend. These letters suggest Fauci workships Hillary, like the dark priestess she is...
I am sorry for your loss and he sounds like an intelligent and amazing man.  But he made a huge mistake and it cost him his life.  He listened to Donald Trump.
Yep, but it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwe chosen to let this orange bastard almost sink us.‚Äù It is ‚ÄúCongressional Republicans &amp; Trumpers chose to let this orange bastard sink us.‚Äù It‚Äôs going to take decades(if ever) to fix Trump‚Äôs &amp; Republican damage to our Economy, DOS, FDA, USPS, Elections, etc.
Donald Trump only hires the best joke writers.
You go to war with the army you've got. Tucker has no options but to grasp at whatever straws he can to discredit Fauci. Imagine how easy his job would be if he worked for a legitimate news organization reporting on the train wreck that is the Trump presidency.
Trump became president because of fraudulent voting and help from Russia to be an illegitimate President we need to see his taxes to prove of his collusion with Russiaüîéüì≤‚è∞üòúüò°ü§îüëÄüÜò
Not without planning, coordination and standards so, in trump‚Äôs case, the answer is no
I didn‚Äôt want to get kidnapped by Trump‚Äôs secret police &amp; thrown into a van/tear gassed like the moms/beaten like the Navy vet.
And we all know that you and the rest of the Republicans in the Senate will cave in to the Demorats. Grab your balls and fight with President Trump for the people.
Trump is about to steal an election and Democrats are gonna be like ‚ÄúAw gee whiz! Not again!‚Äù
Trump and Barr plan on carrying out Roof‚Äôs execution, just so you know. They‚Äôve already executed one white supremacist and Dylan is on deck. Just another reason what you shouldn‚Äôt believe the divisive media when it come to Trump.
and they are:  THEIR LAW &amp; THEIR ORDER.  Seriously.  Remember back in 2015 &amp; Trump kept repeating "the election is rigged"?   It was rigged - but FOR HIM!  He does that a lot; listen closely to his words (if you can stand it).
Ban Trump from  for life!
The second one I‚Äôve seen in the wild, first was a ‚ÄúFirefighters for Biden‚Äù one. That ‚ÄúSettle for Biden‚Äù joke campaign might become a reality, very much enthusiasm here against Trump, more so than enthusiastic support of Biden
Watch Trump thump them on that shit they've been playing  since 2016.... He'll call them fake for not saying they're running the same game plan as the RNC... just more POLITE with it.. I hate 2020.
You're only there to ask Asian related questions so you can try to make Trump look bad by calling it kung flu, Chyna virus.   You're the token Asian reporter and you know it.
It all makes sense once you REALLY accept that Trump is working for Putin to destroy America.  Then - things fall into place.
Really?  They still haven‚Äôt changed the name to the ‚ÄúDepartment of Trump‚Äôs Security Blanket‚Äù?
That can't possibly be.  According to Wyden and Merkley these are peaceful protesters.  Trump must have planted those!
On  All In  says that Trump cannot suspend our ability to vote this November: ‚ÄúThat franchise has been paid with the blood of American martyrs and it is our inheritance, all of ours.‚Äù
Therein is the fallacy of such an extended time between test &amp; results.  {{it is sort of fun to think of Trump getting tested multiple times a day; hope they're doing that nasty nose swipe on him each time.}}
Trump's not a race hustler, he's just a common garden variety hustler
I love Trump.  He was so young back then and has always had so much attention.  Me a busy Mom never paid attention but always saw him on the front of magazines.  I respect him.
Trump is losing it, going off the deep end, or, as a former Republican governor said today, ‚Äúhaving a great deal of difficulty coming to terms with reality.‚Äù
I'd like to say that this is the bar you have to pass for me to vote for you instead of Trump. But if I'm honest my bar is even lower than that.
It is rumored that the Trump family either invested in or is involved in companies that make machines. I haven‚Äôt checked it out, but that‚Äôs scary
Thank you. Please Please Please refrain from violence. Don't follow the actions of Trump Feds. Keep the Peace. Protect protesters, dont attack. Show Trump we don't need "his kind of help" Much ‚ô•Ô∏è TY
Got some Reservoir Dogs type shit right there. They're all gangsters compared to Trump.
And Donald Trump killed him.
I think voting for trump is when she finally snapped
Jesus Christ would be anti-Trump. One hundred percent. Trump flies in the face of ALL of Jesus' teachings.   If you can't understand that, then you don't know what it truly means to be Christian.
On  moments ago  says of Trump‚Äôs suggestion to suspend the election: ‚ÄúWe are at a very dangerous hour in this country.‚Äù He says Trump is attempting to ‚Äúsow chaos, sow doubt, question legitimacy.‚Äù
tRump claimed that the Nov election would be "rigged" and it could take years to count ballots and declare a winner... He‚Äôs nuts - on the other hand maybe it‚Äôs an admission of his  Illegitimacy
There you go, this is Trump's diabolical plan to get Canada and Mexico to pay for border walls. He just might succeed if he kills enough American's to really put the fear into those non-American countries.
Jesus Christ was very anti-government. Hell it was the government (the Romans) who crucified Him to begin with.   Here's something that'll make you mad; if Trump had been alive back then he would have sided with the Romans. Or worse yet, he'd be the Judas at Jesus' Table.
Everything about your ‚Äòfamily‚Äô is wrong for America. You‚Äôre good with harming kids by sending them to school &amp; exposing to the virus, but not old republican white guys. You‚Äôre a perfect addition to the Trump name.
Trump bought them all out
One would think that, by now, someone would have explained this ideological switch to you and your Dunning-Kruger Syndrome cohorts.  If I had been alive back then, I‚Äôd have identified as Republican. And our Idiot-in-Chief, Trump, would be a Democrat. As would you, I gather.
Protoestors most always clean up the litter... Trump #SecretPolice obviously rely upon taxpayer dollars to do their dirty mess. Shame.
Trump is both ignorant and lazy, and now, as a former Republican said today, is ‚Äúhaving a great deal of difficulty coming to terms with reality.‚Äù
What if he means awesome as in less Trump voters soon?
YES! Vote  to humiliate Trump and restore America! #Vote2020 #VoteJoeBiden #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
"Trump is an authoritarian whose ineptitude has unnecessarily killed tens of thousands of Americans, so I'm 50/50 on if I'll vote for him."  Will Hurd is no better than the rest of the Republicans.
Of all the bullshit Trump has tweeted, this gets his goat? Trump has been like this for 3 years. How stupid is this Federalist Society guy?
In the future, USPS will be my first choice bc in any circumstance, they are the worst and slowest. I will do this bc Donald Trump is Hitler and sometimes you must forget cost and convenience and spend conscience $. When I do that, I do it for pointless white collar fed employees
Former Republican Governor William Weld has had the best quote after Trump‚Äôs tweet (shortly after the steep drop in GDP was announced):  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sign of a mind that‚Äôs having great deal of difficulty coming to terms with reality.‚Äù
I love it!  It went from posts that were questioning "who were the 2% that liked Trump?"  back when it was like 20k Votes.  Thank you Patriots!
Trump and his party are the lowest of the low.
Wrong. In fact, he targeted the governors that imposed restrictions. Google when he tweeted ‚ÄúLiberate Michigan‚Äù and ‚ÄúLiberate Minnesota.‚Äù   Trump screwed this up. He could have rallied and united the country to fight the virus. But he didn‚Äôt.
I think people are sufficiently fed up with Trump that they will vote for a bag of potatoes with a mustache instead of him, but I also think a lot of the problems happening right now with police and whatnot will not magically cease once biden is in power.
Portland mayor and Oregon governor don‚Äôt care about this at all. He is nothing but a Trump supporter! Who cares! Gigantic hypocrites!
Obama started the greatest recovery in US history. That for a lot of people.  trump destroyed it. Thus, people are very hungry.  and as usual, Obama‚Äòs speech reminded me of how lucky I am to be an American. And, I that I must fight for her.
Just because the President lies about vote by mail (which he &amp; lots of his own cabinet use) doesn't make it so--if it was so fraud filled then why do our military vote in this manner?!
Yes and did you hear trump blame it on the China virus? He never misses a chance to blame someone else for his inadequacies.
It‚Äôll be a stretch for him to federalize the ORNG.  I‚Äôm not sure how the power play can play out between Brown and Trump.  What would be Fd is if he tried to bring in another state‚Äôs NG.
This will never be "normalized".  Opinion | Trump‚Äôs call to postpone elections is an outrageous break with American faith in democracy
Lol no you won‚Äôt. You and Your Fuhrer Trump are OUT OF HERE

I'm sure trump weill come up with something to make that happen.
I'm not "you folks," &amp; that's not hyperbole. Trump repeatedly demonstrates his incompetence. He has several verifiable personality disorders. His policies &amp; actions are entirely retrograde, racist, misogynistic, &amp; homophobic - all pride points with the right wing. Nice dogs, tho.
Sunday is 2 weeks since trump said he‚Äôs announcing the gop‚Äôs health plan!
PRESIDENT TRUMP SENDS A JOLT THROUGH THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SPHERE TODAY BY SUGGESTING IN A TWEET THAT THIS YEAR'S ELECTION, PERHAPS BE DELAYED...
Also, Brookfield bailed Jared out of his YUGE debt at 666 Fifth Ave., that‚Äôs the Manhattan building that the Kushner family was in way over their heads with debt. Is it a coincidence that Brookfield acquired a nuclear services company called Westinghouse?
Trump is sick. There is no violent emergency here in Portland. It is the presence of Trump's Gestapo that has caused the violence and the dramatic rise in the number of protestors.
Lol she is the text book definition of a trump enabler.
No. You should come to Portland and see what is really going on.  Yes they have 'fuck Trump' songs playing in the back. Yes they hate the Republicans here. Proud Bros Nazis are here.  BUT guess what? They aren't Blue No Matter Who. They also hate our 'blue' Gov and mayor.   sucks
Tell Facebook to stop allowing right-wing politicians to spread lies and misinformation!
I didn't think they could get less intelligent than Reagan, but Quayle, W, Palin, &amp; Trump are like going down an IQ ski slope at speed.
#Trump is threatening to send the national guard to #Portland because of the #PortlandProtests.   #Join me in supporting  via     We must rally #congress to amend  annual funding bill! Get Trump's secret police out of #PDX!
Defense spending has increased every year under President Donald Trump, relentless fighter against ‚Äúendless wars.‚Äù Senate Republicans are trying to sneak an additional $21 billion for the military into the latest coronavirus relief bill.
I'm with you. Even with it being a sad occasion of the funeral of one of our greatest Americans, John Lewis, it did my heart good to see Obama speak. I yearn to have him in charge again. I'd feel safe for the first time since trump's inauguration.
"[Trump] wants us to ignore the 32.9 percent annualized contraction in gross national product and 1.43 million new jobless claims. But we won‚Äôt ignore the 32.9 percent annualized contraction in gross domestic product and 1.43 million new jobless claims.
Isn't this just boycotting?
Oooo, scorching.  Opinion | What a tremendous burden it must be for you to still be defending Donald Trump
Steve Calabresi is a hack, always has been, but to the extent he has influence on the right I suppose it's better that he's spending his time penning anti-Trump articles like this instead of working to pack the courts with more Federalist goons.
The GOP have backed the most corrupt president ever and allowed Trump to undermine our constitution while also blatantly breaking our laws, thus refusing to uphold their sworn duty of oversight, so it's asinine to point to Dems and say they only care about power.
If they impeach and get rid of Trump NOW, maybe we can get somewhere on getting rid of virus and improving economy/reopening schools
Trump supporters liking this tweet like their Grand Cheetoh hasn't done far worse lmao. Fuck both parties.
Journalists should be asking Trump how many Americans need to die before he pushes a mandate that all Americans wear masks.
i dont even know who my audience is anymore ive probably blocked atleast 40 of u but whoever lets trump mind fuck so hard into thinking these people are ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù or ‚Äúanarchistics‚Äù start looking on BOTH sides,listening to BOTH parties,&amp;talk to ppl who believe DIFFERENT than u
6 months into the Coronavirus pandemic, &amp; leaders from coast to coast are still begging Trump to fully utilize the DPA so ALL of America has adequate PPE &amp; testing equipment. 6 months. 155,079 people have died now from COVID19, &amp; even that's still not enough to motivate Trump.
how do you decide which Trump to blow from day to day?
Currently on r/Portland: "Trump just said unless ‚Äúprofessional agitators‚Äù in Oregon are wiped out, he‚Äôs sending in the national guard." #Portland
Whoa! This is something new. üòÆ Never mind that he couldn't see past his own partisan blinders until this tweet.   üòÆ Something finally caused him to see who/what we are dealing with: Trump as a threat to our democratic republic itself. This should start the dominoes to fall...
Since when are peaceful protesters, terrorists!?! Since #45  says so! LOL üòÇ More like the federal officers are terrorists for tear gassing and using rubber bullets against peaceful protesters!! This isn‚Äôt a democracy! Trump is a DICTATOR &amp; MUST Be STOPPED! üñïüèªü§¨
Which one? Trump, Barr or PompousAss
Me. If he‚Äôs going down, he‚Äôd love to take us down with him. The more dead Americans the better for trump.  He‚Äôs that evil, that primitive and petty.
It‚Äôs pretty clear to everyone with half a brain (or more) that mail in votes that provide a paper trail are under attack by trump precisely because they‚Äôre unhackable right?
The delay is a troll. He is scaring Democrat voters into thinking Trump will pull a fast one.  Trump is going to spill the beans. This election is going to be 100-0.  #LockHerUp
She will slice and dice the Trump Crime Cabal!!!!
I would add this. Trump hates the job. He loves the power, the perks, the plane, the helicopter, but he hates the job. He‚Äôs in so far over his head, my dog would be a better president. Trump should quit, and it‚Äôs possible he will. Being trump would be a fate worse than death.
Of courses parents want schools open but even more (and this is the crucial part) they want it to be SAFE. trump has no plan and districts can‚Äôt do it alone
I have to agree that your tactics of attacking Dems is kind of a pro tRump move... I like what your saying in general but even someone who isn‚Äôt a conspiracy theorist has to ü§î
Couldn't agree more.  IDK what Trump is talking about.  If you don't want to see the protests, just stay away from the 2 blocks around the justice center from 8pm to 6am.  The city power washes everyday.  The feds are the only ones with un tidy buildings.
Yes, and William Weld just said that Trump‚Äôs tweet is ‚Äúa sign of a mind that‚Äôs having a great deal of difficulty coming to terms with reality.‚Äù
I live in Portland and this is not only ridiculous, it‚Äôs a blatant lie. Trump is obviously terrified of his standing in the polls &amp; his prospects in November. Republican lawmakers are delusional and face a losing proposition if they refuse to denounce Trump.
Left to right: Kind of meh, war criminal, creep.  Two out of the three I would choose over Trump.  That middle one was the worst president ever.
You may  want to sit down for this: Donald Trump is not a Republican.
Yep! Trump gave Saudi Arabia U.S. Nuclear Secrets. The headline is completely wrong/false/a lie. The U.S. didn‚Äôt approve it, Trump approved it without congressional knowledge.
Please consider county over party  Everyone needs to clean up their act and get rid of tRump
The biggest danger is not listening to and acting on climate science. Four more years of Trump &amp; GOP could make it impossible to avoid the most serious consequences of the climate crisis &amp; habitat loss.  Life on earth hangs in the balance. I am not exaggerating.
Ya, but have you forgotten this is tRump. There is a reason we are all sick to death of the word unprecedented.  I've been SCREAMING this for 4 years - WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT!?!?!?!
When it comes to the bigotry that drives Trump support, many of our major media outlets still don't want to face the pervasive rot among white evangelical Protestantism. This is where ex-evangelicals come in--with enough visibility, we can change the national conversation.
Attention #MAGA Trump and the GOP want to cut both these programs that many of you or your relatives may be relying upon.
He will effectively be erased. If not formally, still trump‚Äôs legacy will be shit forever.
SO COMPROMISE, TAKE OUT THE GIFT TO BIG CORPORATIONS, TAKE OIT THE FBI BUILDING AND AGREE TO FUND SMALL BUSINESS AND WORKING FAMILIES SO IT WILL PASS.   THIS IS NOT ALL ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT, WHAT trump WANTS.   THIS IS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.   DO THE RIGHT THING FOR ONCE.
This is why I don't have serious discussions with most Trump supporters. I'd rather goof on 'em and move on. Like Grandma Jim used to say, "Don't bother playing volleyball with a dodgeball savant."
Welp, I was slightly wrong. It was Jerry Falwell Jr. who said he should get 2 additional years in a Tweet, which he retweeted (then deleted) &amp; commented that 2 years of his presidency were stolen.
U call on the man to testify but then prevent him from answering your questions. ya these people are maggots and if trump gets reelected u can bank on most of em doin jail time üíØ.

PLEASE  New Bill:  Extend deadline to vote, to ensure ALL have time to do so. (into the following day)?  Extend period of time to COUNT VOTES Due to population growth &amp; record turnout, There MUST be MORE TIME!  You KNOW Trump will watch the clock, conspiring
If it helps,  has been angry and pessimistic for as long as I've known her.  And in her PhD she literally predicted Trump, so it is understandable.  And over the last 60+ days, she has been the most optimistic I've ever seen.  So...
Cain's cause of death is complications due to Covid-19. He was obstinate enough to go without a mask at Trump's Tulsa rally, and he paid for it.
We are no longer free to travel the world. Thanks Trump
An absolute piece of garbage it's funny trump shined the flashlight in that hole and all the big ass rats looked up and started runnin. I wouldnt be threatening people if I was facing life in prison I'm just sayin
we're spending millions of dollars on test kits that don't work so that donald trump can lie about how many tests we have.
Well, maybe he did. They brought us back from the brink of depression and now Team Trump has taken us to the lowest GDP in history and ensured that America‚Äôs COVID pandemic is by far the worst in the world.
We can point all the fingers we want. Joe. Obama. Bush. Trump. Fucking Nixon üòÇ  At the end of the day, we need to stop putting ourselves against each other and realize the reality, that our system is corrupt at the foundation

Okay folks, if you're concerned that trump won't give up his office when Joe Biden wins in November get involved.  There are people already working on it.
I love it. The thought of trump fuming in the White House makes me laugh. He‚Äôs so isolated and hated. It‚Äôs awesome.
Yes. More of this, less of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, he can‚Äôt legally do that.‚Äù As if Trump and his enablers give the tiniest of shits about the law.
#trumppresser   Stephen Paddock - Las Vegas: Killed 59 Ppl Nikolas Cruz -- Stoneman Douglas HS, FL: Killed 17 Ppl Patrick Crusius -- El Paso Wal-Mart: Killed 23 Ppl  Portland Moms and Vets:  Killed ZERO!  One guess which one Trump defined as terrorists during his presser
Here's a great read that helps show the transition of Lincoln's Republican party to the much different form it takes today:
Can anyone answer this question?? Was Pompeo castrated while at Westpoint or did it happen when he bacame part of the Trump administration??
Trump tried to call a press conference at the same time, even Fox wouldn‚Äôt cut away from the funeral to air it so he rescheduled for later. ü§£
tRump corruption  Barr cover ups  Very scary
This unintentionally says so much about who Joe Biden will be president for.  If Trump's tweets have been worrying you, you are completely divorced from the lived reality of average Americans, some 30 million of whom are facing eviction in the next few months.
It's a statute. Trump can't delay it. But not because of the constitution.
Sorry Cornyn, but you all tried this just over a month ago about slowing down Covid-19 testing. GOP said it was a joke. Trump said, "I don't kid."
if Trump gets reelected, most of us could be dead by the time of his funeral.
C‚Äômon, it‚Äôs troops and old folks, probably Trump voters.
#Environment   INTERIOR DEPARTMENT DECLARES THAT ACCIDENTAL BIRD DEATHS ARE LEGAL 1/22/17  Trump administration said it will no longer consider the accidental killing of birds‚Äîfrom eagles colliding with wind turbines to ducks zapped on power lines‚Äîa violation

Gee, look at Portland burning to the ground. üôÑ Mom in Texas actually asked me yesterday if PDX was on the verge of burning to ash because she'd seen Trump saying that's what was happening here. Had to give her the disinformation breakdown. "Beehive of Terrorism", lol. ü§£
Now, Trump is LITERALLY asking for your BLOOD. Can't you pull this off with #AlienDNA and #DemonSperm, von Clownstick? #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K #TrumpHatesScience #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
What gets me is how the deadenders constantly talk about how we want to murder poor people, but when you point out that voting for Biden would extend Medicaid to millions &amp; reelecting Trump would make people lose healthcare they do not give a single fuck. ‚ÄúNot me? Who cares!‚Äù
Donald Trump can't tell people to wear masks because China.
The entire party/ government is to blame for that. He had 100x more respect and character for this country than Trump. I‚Äôd take him any day over what we have now.  Don‚Äôt forget what we‚Äôre trying to accomplish here
üëäüèºü§£ just remember January 20th 2021 trump is fired end of term. üí•üôåüèº
Trump lies! Portland is a strong united community standing for Black Lives Matter. Not terrorists, not anarchists. His words are a totally use of projection, one of the most effective tools of gaslighting. Don‚Äôt buy it.
Portland Oregon lies, Brown says you met her demands &amp; your plan for feds failed. LMAO Democrats lie to cover up lies! Set  Wheeler and Brown straight! TRUMP 2020
President Trump is taking the brave way of telling his voters about mail in ballots. He does not hide behind words. You will not be holding office above what your doing.
What does current job data say about Trump‚Äôs response to Covid? Pretty piss poor for everyone
It's a comedian voice-over that I too was fooled by and was called out on.  It's sad that we can't tell the difference with Trump because it's similar to what he's previously been caught saying.
Perhaps, but the man is dead. Criticizing him now is meaningless. More important to me is the dangerous talk by Trump of delaying the election. And, undermining the post office to disrupt voting by mail. Eye on the target.
Even if all that ture he still be a better then Trump. -Lie about everything even if it good new. -Stealing US money every golf trip at his hotel -Is a Traitor,Told his People work with Russia in 2016.Gave top secret info to Russia.Has not act on Russia bontys on us Troops.
Well, as you can see, #WealthClass do not go to jail.. but fuck up a fence and Trump's #SecretPolice will cart you off to #Gitmo.
Randi, stop working with the AAP corporate pediatricians who lies match trump word for word.  Don't defer the choice of death to districts controlled by trump loving school board members.  Save lives, keep classrooms closed for now.
It angers me that President Trump keeps repeating that his troops are defending the federal building in Portland when it is blocks away from the demonstrators. It also pisses me that he cannot pronounce Oregon correctly.
No. Trump is the baby.
Start with Trump was was behind the rampage
Trump, the great builder. No one does walls better.
We call that a Trump Depression
you know what let's stop dancing around the truth here:  donald trump just killed herman cain
LIAR! When have you shown any concern for those who've lost their lives during this pandemic? Answer: never! Your only concern is your re-election. You deserve not only to lose in November, you deserve a prison cell, Trump. Ignorant, inept, incompetent, ignoble.
Cool. I think all Republicans and Trump supporters should delay their voting until January 22, 2021.
Could be , trump still don't wear a mask , only to look like he's trying .
Absolutely. Trump is the personification of every entitled, stupid white man we got passed over for, we‚Äôre sexually harassed by, and grabbed on the street or told to ‚Äòsmile‚Äô as if they have some kind of authority over us. And all his cronies remind me of every date rape frat boy

Pres. Trump has a lot to say about Portland and Oregon being a mess, but honestly, I haven't seen him in this state in the past 4 years or for that matter in the last 10 years.  Come visit, you might be surprised.
It‚Äôs too little, too late. This evil clown show has been on for years &amp; Hurd supported it. It was apparent Trump mishandled Covid from the start. Now we have over 150,000 dead, people‚Äôs lives have blown up, kids can‚Äôt go to school &amp; Hurd ‚Äúmight‚Äù not vote for him? Worthless POS.
Trump's telling voters not to vote on  November third , great , I say all Democrats vote November third and dump the turd .  He's doing us a favor .
Trump because im not a fucking moron.
Former presidential candidate Herman Cain has died after contracting COVID-19    Cain, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after attending Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa without wearing a mask, has died at the age of 74.
tRump is killing americ we need to act know!!!!
#trump runs his mouth an awful lot about how much he cares, works, and does for the African-American community. Funny he didn't attend #elijahcummings or #JohnLewis funerals. obviously he cares about the black vote, not the community, or the plight. #VoteBlue #vote
Trump is a whiner. He always clomplains that no one likes him.
Trump claims us Portlanders are professional anarchist who hate our county. Lmao so now we‚Äôre a union can we get paid for our services now????
Trump Dump
there's a chance that the polls get so bad that trump tries to literally pay off the entire country to vote for him and i would be ok with that because at this point i do not think it would work but we'd all get more money
Even if he was guilty of all those things.. How does that help us today?   Trump is envoking violence upon innocent Americans and refusing to acknowledge the country needs a reformed justice system.   Don‚Äôt take away from this movement by singling out something irrelevant today
They don't care.  They think all of Washington is corrupt sinners and will vote for who gives them what they want.  (They *don't* think Trump is a good man, they just think all politicians are evil by their very nature.  But he'll pander to them.)
Trump's television is only white.
Herman Cain is only one of 150K dead from COVID-19, still raging through the country.  Opposing authoritarianism and fascism is an American tradition. We were founded in a revolution.  Portland isn't "burning to the ground." One block is disrupted.  All on Trump's watch.
The Trump Presidency.
Why do you think the states ( who have actual authority over the elections) would listen to Trump who has no authority over elections?
A week before Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration in 2017, Rep. John Lewis D-Ga. laid down his marker: Trump would not be his president, and Lewis would not afford him any of the respect that comes with the office. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see this president-elect as a legitimate president,‚Äù Lewis said
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è that‚Äôs not a response to trump, that‚Äôs our response to people naively, obstinately‚Äîfrankly, dangerously‚Äî insisting that we have nothing to worry about bc our system will save us from him.
Make no mistake. Portland people have defeated the white supremacist Trump administration by refusing to back down.
President Trump calls Portland a "beehive of terrorists" full of "people who hate our country" and threatens to send in the National Guard.
"Beehive of terrorists" is actually rahter poetic for Trump!
wear a mask, vote in the coming election.  I will vote for a democrat for the first time in years because I want to be counted in the popular vote against trump.  We must rid ourselves of this plague called trump and friends.
Sounds like you didn't catch what Trump was getting at with his tweet!  Lol
trump: let‚Äôs not have elections ever again, i want to be supreme ruler for life  his base: lol the liberals will be so mad at this!!!1
A note to our evangelical GOP friends who might wonder why Trump is not struck down if he's so evil. Trump is just an instrument. God is not testing him. God is testing you.
Both Trump and Cuomo are criminal sociopaths. It's not an either/or situation
"Speaking at a White House press conference, the president said Portland was a disaster filled with professional agitators and anarchists, and that the National Guard would be sent if local officials didn't get the city under control in the next two days."
There are no limits to the stupidity of Trump supporters. Thanks for proving that. At least we have one fewer as of today.
Wait, you tweeted negatively about Trump? Holy crap!!  Welcome to the resistance
Please do a video on the seven deadly sins as they apply to trump.  He is guilty of all and there is plenty of available material on him that apply to each.
So, how do we forcibly remove Trump from office?  Because this is THE issue we're inevitably going to have to confront this fall. And I'm not talking impeachment, I'm talking about literally dragging that sack of shit out of the Oval Office.
It looks like someone dunked Trump's face in a toilet bowl full of concentrated orange Kool-Aid while holding him by the ears. A resistor's dream job!
I live in Oregon and have voted by mail for over 20 years. It‚Äôs safe, secure and super easy. This year I‚Äôm mailing in my ballot earlier than usual because of the new trump appointed postmaster who is attempting to sabotage the USPS.

You are hardly making any sense at this point.  I think you're trying to do the whole, "if you don't vote Biden, you vote Trump," thing, which is not worth my time. If you don't believe in the power of individual vote, what's the point? Worry about the 30%+  people who don't vote

Show me the tweets where you said Barack Obama had unfettered power as president like you argue Trump has.
It is part of our constitution, which trump neither knows or cares about in his blatant power grabs and attempts at authoritarianism. THAT's what's at stake. Rule of law is unraveling thanks to him.
The pain, suffering, hardship and death that Trump has caused all Americans as a result of his mismanagement of this pandemic is no less than the damage he‚Äôs wrought to our institutions of representative government. #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt.

So Trump says if  and  don't "clean it up" in the next couple days he's sending in the National Guard. Funny that wasn't mentioned by Brown and Wheeler when they claimed victory to the national media.
Opinion | Trump‚Äôs suggestion to delay the election is the most anti-democratic thing any president ever said - The Washington Post
The ruling class must be pissed that Trump is playing the authoritarian card so early over something so stupid like his re-election.
Not to mention there are 150,000 dead and 4,500,000 infected from COVID, unemployment benefits are being wiped out, millions are going to be evicted at once, Trump wants to delay the election and strengthen the police state..  Are y‚Äôall gonna rise up or what?
"If you can just kick up infinite dust storms comprised of infinite particles.. you can rapidly get to the point at which everything simultaneously matters too much and nothing seems to matter at all."
He's an idiot. He scathingly excoriated Biden for even thinking that trump might want to postpone an election. But will he apologize to Biden? Not on a bet.
You don‚Äôt have to do this, you know. I mean, it must be exhausting covering for Trump. Just stop.
Rep.  and I won't stand for Trump's racist attack on fair housing policies.  Today, we scored a major victory when the House approved our amendment to block HUD from ending rules designed to stop housing discrimination.
Trump and the GOP obviously do
I think the Democrats are loud, outspoken and share so many disparaging things about Trump and those who support him are quiet. Based on the noise I can see why you might question this.
So wonderful to see and hear him but also sad we have trump

You aren't paying attention if you aren't aware of how trump rolls. He has done what he could get away with so far to destroy democracy here.
"trump seems to have" gauged, correctly, that you'd give him the benefit of the doubt instead of pointing out that he's very obviously lying.
IMO they never believed impeachment would remove Trump. They were desperate to keep the convo away from: ‚ÄúWTF w/ the Dems? A: crooks &amp; conmen.‚Äù Kept Trump in a box &amp; pushed for more war. Hoped Trump would f**k something up. Bet they think they‚Äôve hit the jackpot. #DemExit
How can you be ok with this. My friends who was PEACEFULLY protesting and he was live-streaming the whole time, was shot in the side of the head by the feds. Trump needs to just go back into his little bunker and leave Portland alone.
Trump is the monster in the swamp
Our media is always fully cooperative when Trump wants to change the subject. After 3+ years of him doing this they almost all still take the bait.
RIP Herman Cain. Looks like Trump will need to find another black "friend".  #MaskUp #HermanCainRIP
Honestly with Trump I think the tax money is a bonus. The man is consumed with his fucking ego. Worst state of the country and he goes on tweet rants about tv news ratings or the "bad" coverage he gets. He's a man who only sees his ego in a tv frame
Donald Trump‚Äôs press conference today is a total disaster even by his standards  via
Ask your boss Trump he's holding everything up not her stop lying
OK. So McConnell and McCarthy have poured cold water on this crap.  The question is: will we start to see GOP opinion shift towards Trump on this?
Federal agents show stronger force at Portland protests despite order to withdraw
Yes, after Jan. 20 Trump will be a civilian. He will be tied up in courts for a very long time, and hopefully be put in prison at some point.
üòÇ nope. Not for a minute. I like the brevity and clarity of his message, too. Trump needs tone removed NOW. Not another moment of delay. #ImpeachTrumpAgain
Trump wants to postpone the election? He just said it.
There are systems to detect/prevent voter fraud, like checking signatures. Voter fraud is very rare, even with mail-in ballots. That is fact. The conspiracy part is Trump supporters dismissing the evidence against voter fraud as "fake news", and the millions of fake votes in 2016
There's no argument these Nazis won't make in service to Donald Trump.

It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to know Trump intends to murder citizens of the city I live in.
China isn't responsible for the trump administration ignoring and downplaying the threat of COVID-19. He could have prevented the deaths of 150,000 Americans. He chose not to.
of all the possible endings i admit i never expected, with 3mos til he has to steal the election &amp; 6mos until he has to refuse to leave office, trump just tweeting out "fuck it, let's do the constitutional crisis right now and get it over with"  he's fully daring ppl to stop him
Anyone witnessing the response to Trump's tweet is seeing the very moment a large mouth bass takes the bait.
Muh trump only got 3 miles of wall, stfu. #AmericaFirst
Look at the rest of civilized nations. Trump and his hands off approach/ leave it to the states policy has completely failed to save lives and has crashed our economy. Nothing partisan about that assessment and I‚Äôm surprised you see it as ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù?

A Republican President hating Portland is the most normal thing Trump has done.
Trump claimed he deployed the National Guard to Minneapolis during the Floyd protests, but a CNN fact check clarified the governor there was actually the one who activated the guard.
and he got Covid at trump's ill fated rally!
Portland is living rent free in Trump's mind. He's obsessed with us.   If only he was this obsessed with battling Coronavirus.
The pizza guy who died because he attended a Trump rally.  Yeah, totally worth remembering.

Looks like the rats are jumping off the ship...   Co-founder of The Federalist Society, who:   - Voted for Trump  - Against Mueller Investigation  - Against Impeachment   Now says Trump should be Impeached for trying to delay election.   GOOD TIMES!
I literally almost fell over from laughing so hard üòÇ really? All  did was show his true, slimy-politician ways, shamelessly lie for the sake of political expediency (I live 2 blocks from pdx riots lol) and showcase his unfound hatred for Trump. Zero class or tact
Trump's bullshit and consistent lies made me come the closest I've ever come to taking my 357 mag. and blowing a hole in my T.V. I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP!
I respect your choice. I am voting for Biden, however. If Trump wins, 4 more years of GOP may run out the clock on our chances to avoid the worst effects of the climate &amp; habitat crises. That could mean many plants &amp; animals going extinct, including humans.
Trump probably thinks if he can kill the post office the IRS will just shrivel up and won‚Äôt be able to release his tax history to prosecutors.
Bravenak is a well known khiver.  You lie more than trump.

The co-founder of the Federalist Society, who voted for  and opposed both the Mueller probe and Ukraine impeachment, says the president‚Äôs tweet about delaying the election is grounds for impeachment:
A mountain of evidence proves that Trump's narrative of widespread voter fraud is a myth. It is obvious...Trump wants his supporters to believe the only way he could lose is if the dems cheat. He will do anything to win, no matter the damage.

Hey Trump!, you didn‚Äôt get the gist of the message!
Oh look, a Nazi agrees that Trump should remain in power and we should delay the election. That is shocking.
And it's only 3:30 Pacific time.ü§ò I fully expect Trump to go full playground tantrum with word that Steve Calabresi, co-founder of the Federalist Society, finally agrees he's a fascist while calling for his immediate impeachment after suggesting the election should be delayed.
Hmmmm. How interesting.I‚Äôve never really thought about how other country‚Äôs vote.Sounds like something to check out during this time when we are staying home so much with the pandemic raging here.Another big tRump fail!I‚Äôve yet to see him have a victory tho but it‚Äôs still so sad.
Trump needs punished for his lies and lies about the virus also like the 8 weeks he said it was a democratic hoax or that a med for lupus helped cure it proven not to so trump just as guilty as China

It's very scary! I think Trump's people are using this book, On Tyranny, as a to-do list,
And I think the "states rights" narrative is laughable, considering many of its promoters just encouraged Trump to send federal troops to Portland, against the wishes of the mayor, governor, and state citizens.
Hell no I would vote for a monkey before I vote for trump
Trump just threatened at his presser to send in the National Guard. That would be our own OR NG.
So.  If Trump issues orders that the Army seize ballots, you expect him to refuse?
I had admittedly believed Trump's response was denial and putting his head in the sand. In a sense, it was, but according to  at Vanity Fair, a pretty decent national coordinated plan was in place, and Trump shot it down. I just threw up in my mouth a little.

Trump just said that he'll send in the National Guard if  and state troopers can't protect the federal courthouse.   Assuming he means the military and not a continued DHS presence, the law is murky on his authority to do this. Background:
If GOP voters actually buy the bullshit Trump is peddling and decide to stay home because of it, that is quite frankly on them.  I, for one, am reluctant to believe that most GOP voters will actually buy this particular flavor of bullshit. Not enough to refrain from voting.
Literally every one of those articles is about how stuff Trump and Rs are doing to make mail-in voting harder (e.g., not bailing out USPS) is going to make November a travesty. I just fucking can‚Äôt with this guy.
Never thought Fed Soc would go after Trump
No debate. You're 1,000% on it    Btw the co-founder of the FEDERALIST SOCIETY called Trump a fascist today for those folx who still want to be in denial

If I was a reporter in that room, Trump  would've had to be carried out for ALL THE LIES he's telling. EVERYTHING was lie; the economy, Covid-19, calling our governors "terrorists", trying to have people believe our elections won't happen.  HOW MUCH MORE DO WE HAVE TO TAKE?
Trump is tweeting about postponing the election to draw attention from Obama's John Lewis eulogy &amp; Herman Cain's COVID death. Don't give him that power. Stay focused. Don't let him manipulate you.
What a ridiculous idea tRump has. If you think you're sending the National Guard to Portland, Oregon you are out of your fucking mind. Is this country ready to watch martial law turn into civil war? It will.  #NoFederalOccupation #FedsOutOfPortland
Portlander here. It‚Äôs obvious this protest is astroturfed AF and the local politicians are doing everything they can to goad Trump into a response. IMO the smart play is to do nothing.
Dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever seen and I just read a Trump tweet sooo that‚Äôs pretty dumb.
Put another way, Federalist Society already got their judges so Trump isn‚Äôt of any use to them anymore.
Trump is threatening to send in the National Guard to Portland to "clean out this beehive of terrorists." Where are our 1st amendment rights?
This is important: Trump's attempts to manipulate the USPS has already resulted in mail slowdowns, in part because mail carriers can no longer get overtime pay. It's only going to get worse, so request your ballots *as soon as your state allows it*
I think Putin knows trump is losing, so he's trying to sabotage America as much as possible before trump gets evicted and re-homed in prison.
I've disowned my father, who not only supports tRump but believes this is preferable to having "Killary" in office. I have no regrets.
LOL.. we'd see a country FULL of "conservatives" shouting &amp; screaming but still praising Lord Trump,but, blaming the Democrats &amp; antifa for not getting their $$$!   They should try sugar water &amp; salt. It's horribly sticky, cheap to make, gums up machinery &amp; is aggravating!
You don't seem to get memes either. Hopefully you will get a better understanding of the US Constitution when you become a citizen. Welcome to the United States. Please pardon our dust. A legitimate President will be in soon. Trump doesn't want you here.
Too bad, Trump! We all watched Obama‚Äôs entire speech and this is the only pic I saw of your ‚Äúphoto op‚Äù and I don‚Äôt even want to know what it‚Äôs about.  Obama‚Äôs eulogy on the other hand, next level awesome.  #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything #ObamaSpeaking
Jared and Ivanka will keep Trump from doing anything too bad - they're pretty people!
For anyone wondering - no, a government official cannot endorse a product, company, or brand. There is a legal code of ethics around this.  and  needs to do something about this.   Trump has endorsed several products and companies while President. Ivanka too.
Watching Trump speak today juxtaposed to the 3 former Presidents who spoke today at John Lewis‚Äô funeral, specifically President Obama, is quite a thing. What a sad, pathetic loser. All he does is lie &amp; snort adderall.
As Steven Calabresi is pointedly reminding everyone here - he was absolutely fine with everything Trump's done, a fan of what Trump's done...until one tweet today.  Steven Calabresi's not the good guy here, and doesn't need applause.
As a Portland resident this trump bullshit is making me MAD AS HELL.
How does Trump think he can send in the National Guard to Portland? He's said it 3-4 times now. Is he mixing up National Guard with DHS? Probably.
Portland is "a Beehive of terrorists"?  #Trump #PortlandProtests #DHS #beehiveofterrorists
Pres. Trump just said the National Guard will be dispatched to Portland if feds can't "make it work today and tomorrow" to "clean out this beehive of terrorists."
The only thing that helps us is his utter laziness and incompetence.  A Trump 2.0, like a Tom Cotton, for example - now *that* would be terrifying.
Trump live right now threatening to send the national guard into Portland. This is great üôÉ
Admitting trump is incompetent would be admitting they made a mistake. Never gonna happen.
Where'd he catch the "China Virus"? Many people are calling it the "Trump Virus" because he caught it at a Trump Rally.
And the mainstream media must be more aggressive about debunking Trump's claims of mail-in voter fraud. It is a huge lie.
A week before Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration in 2017, Rep. John Lewis D-Ga. laid down his marker: Trump would not be his president, and Lewis would not afford him any of the respect that comes with the office. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see this president-elect as a legitimate president,‚Äù Lewis said
lord knows I‚Äôve had my issues with her but honestly it would be wild as shit if Trump ends up fucking with the elections and then having to cede to Pelosi, perhaps his single least favorite elected official in the United States
Trump: Safety For Fences And Graffiti Free Living!  Portland: Get The Fuck Outta Here.
Yes, your tweet is irresponsible - shame on you. Did Trump killed Herma Cain? Many people are saying that he did...
The mainstream media cannot keep allowing Trump to get away with his mail-in ballot lies. He has no proof for his claims and it has to be challenged and debunked.
Congress has to VOTE TO CHANGE THE ELECTION. Trump can't make them vote.  what Trump says means nothing.
Thanx!I‚Äôve been active &amp; marching since the Vietnam Nam war &amp; Civil Rights riots &amp; thought I‚Äôd seen the worst of it.Then comes this tRump mess,which I feel is probably the worst I‚Äôve been through personally.But back in our history,like slavery &amp; the western expansion,it was worse
No difference. Not a stupid question.  Trump is stupid.
I am finally beginning to see light, bars, and concrete at the end of the tunnel, for Trump.
"echoes what he just said."  Trump does not get enough credit for this.  The guy is a master of saying essentially the same thing 2, 3, even 4 times in row.  "I've been treated very unfairly.  The way I have been treated is very unfair.  It's very unfair how I've been treated."
No, it didn't, but Trump DID!  He has done everything in his power to SLOW down the rising # of COVID cases... he wanted to stop testing altogether to "stop" COVIDS - crazy thinking.  Slow delivering PPE except to China. Look at his behavior not his words. He's trying to kill us.
Trump has given up on everything except his reelection and will not lift a finger to help Americans. The criminal GOP is MIA. They will leave us with the worst economy since the Great Depression.

Why does trump keep promoting hydroxchloroquine? There has to be a financial tie. Please use ur influence to get some investigating reporting underway.
William Barr is Donald,s fixer, Attorney, sad when he is supposed to be the United States Attorney General. He is not supposed to be Trump‚Äôs fixer for his illegal dealings. What is wrong with our government? It‚Äôs looking more like Russia. We all must vote , and vote Trump out!
Trump: She was on TV! She‚Äôs an expert.
Good for him, a man who has fought for country and knows what he fought for and what Trump doesn‚Äôt stand for , our country!
Exactly.  Trump screwed up the COVID response and is now looking to create rioting to show why he is the "Law and Order" guy (who had a lot of his campaign leaders indicted during the Russia investigation).  Do the agents who kidnapped that person in NYC know they're being used?

I guess the law doesn't apply to Trump's people though, they just get let right out after they are convicted.
Lots of pictures of protesters at Portland who are NOT wearing masks. So much for false claims that they are ALL supposedly wearing masks...
Would someone please investigate if trump has financial ties with hydroxchloroquine? His constantly promoting it is very suspicious.
One more death on Trump. "Some, I suppose, are very nice people."

Trump‚Äôs campaign team know that this move won‚Äôt help his re-election efforts. It is akin to Trump abandoning the Kurds to Turks and our bases in Syria to Russia the week of impeachment. Putin is calling in his chips. Trump is owned by Putin.
NATO may be your religion, but why are Americans footing all the bill for Europe's defense? Trump has a point here.
Nope, don't believe it.  This is just like when Trump claimed he'd already been taking it. This is a set up so that a week from now he can declare "it cured me, what a miracle drug!" This is just theater for brownie points with Trump.
And the US Postmaster General is a major Trump donor... funny how that works. üò§
Does that mean we can fire TRUMP - what about people's bill getting to creditors on time - we need pictures sent to the press to prove this and then we should put the post master and the rest of them in jail

I cannot wrap my head around the fact that people really think covid is some sort of hoax.  It is being POLITICIZED by Donald Trump and his cronies.  The entire WORLD didnt have millions of people die just because 2020 is an election year in the US.  Also, wear a fucking mask.
Exactly. People should focus on Trump's corruption.
It shows that the guy recently Trump installed his purposely sabotaging the performance of the US postal service.  Try and keep up MAGAT.
I'm surprised Trump would retweet this because if you watch it, it is an indictment on the performance of USPS after he installed one of his lackeys to run it.  However I suspect the right-wing rubes commenting won't even watch it.
who is this chick trying to explain how a trump tweet is dangerous but calling for genocide is not? omg

How long has McConnell had to strengthen America. Biden and Obama pulled us out of an economy in a downward spiral and now trump is taking us down again. Raising the deficit &amp; lowering the economy. Let Biden reunite our country. Trump will only further tear us apart &amp; putin wins
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Floats Whether to ‚ÄòDelay the Election,‚Äô Something He Cannot Legally Do
Good morning Gym, readying for another day lying, misinformation and covering up for the loser trump! We know you‚Äôre great turning your back on America‚Äôs citizens!
Not convicted by a very partisan senate wearing blinders.
Today I begin following a bunch of  politicians. My TL should be crowded with them denouncing Trump‚Äôs notion of delaying the 2020 election. Their message should be clear &amp; unified...‚ÄùNo, we will not succumb to banana republic authoritarian nonsense.‚Äù #Election2020 #GOP
Biden and Obama pulled us out of a spiraling recession while trump is putting us back into one. Our democracy is being strangled. Please vot for Joe Biden. He has the good sense leadership that we need in order to turn things around.  Trump is a disaster
trump is the biggest lying package of trash that I've ever heard in my entire life. what infuriates me is the cruelty of consequences of what he's doing. you me &amp; every day folk in America lose.
They turned around the failed Bush economy and Biden will turn around the failed trump economy. Trump had 4 years in which to move us forward and heal our sick and dying democracy.
trump is already conniving the use that bogus B.S. if he loses. trump will probably face criminal charges as soon as he steps down from the presidency. he won't be able to manipulate - rig the govt to favor his income group that makes us all pay for it
Didn't you hear? It will *poof*--disappear like a miracle. After how much death and suffering, I guess we can't say. 'Useless' is right. Perhaps from that abomination of a Tulsa rally, people giving their lives for trump's aggrandizement. He is killing Americans.
Well he is Trump's Ally just not ours
I wonder if trump will acknowledge Herman Cain's death, much less that it was apparently that unprotected Tulsa rally that infected him. I am sorry for his family.
This is how we lose our democracy. USPS being defunded and delayed. Misinformation about mail-in voting. And now President Trump thinks it‚Äôs smart to delay the election?
ya'll don't think. trump has his eyes on the presidency and nothing else. that's what's going down here front and center.
Oh yes it‚Äôs real alright.  You‚Äôre suffering from an acute case I‚Äôd say. Imagine thinking that Trump was a competent President!  Sad!  Toodles and.......wait for it.....you‚Äôre muted!
Trump voted by mail
Trump voted by mail
Also, Herman Cain's death from Covid after contracting it at Trump's Tulsa rally. Another reason a decoy was needed.
It was a decoy that Trump will no doubt walk back ("I was only asking if we shouldn't consider it.") The real story for Trump today is the crashing economy‚Äîwhich we could have mitigated if his Administration was not so brazenly corrupt.
America has always had this element, Trump just mad it more fashionable.
you love ppl that agree with you (TRUMP)
trump is the only thing that is INACCURATE  and  FRAUDULENT  !
Narcissists can suffer psychosis when in crisis. When my narcissistic MIL had cancer, went into ICU, she claimed nurses were trying to suck her brains out. Her long- suffering husband too. Even long after, she insisted it was all true. She had a lot of admiration for trump, FWIW.
the end product of all these falls from grace is the creation of the ‚Äúkitty drowners &amp; butterfly mashers‚Äù of the world. Surely you grok what I mean by that.    #psychology #Trump #conservatives #childdevelopment #spirituality
BullSHIT!! That would be MR TRUMP!
A month ago it was "Trump's dropping out!" IDK how they come up with their moronic rumors, but they're creative, lol!
Mr Trump SIR! We need you to personally go to  Portland and use a bullhorn like Bush43 did in NY after 9/11. Your disciples thirst for your message.  Speak forthrightly to every person, woman, man and to the cameras and tv's!

Goodbye Trump. "The U.S. economy shrank at a 32.9% annualized pace between April and June as the coronavirus slammed businesses and consumers, the Commerce Department said Thursday, marking the nation's worst quarterly contraction on _record_."
when they told me it was for trump i told them they were going to jail, and that led to the discussion about nurmberg
How did the Feds act last night after the announcement they're leaving? With unprovoked preemptive attacks on non-violent protesters and press (illegal), and more snatch and grab kidnapping attempts. They are bitter, loser thugs, just like Trump. #PDXprotests #PortlandProtests
Why is trump removing 12k US troops from Germany? Two reasons: 1. It benefits Putin 2. It helps defray some of the costs trump incurred when he took Pentagon money and used it for his border wall.  #Weak #Fail #Loser
Isn‚Äôt every day under the trump administration crazy?
Can you name one Trump trait that betters Earth?
Can you name a single Trump trait that betters humanity?
Oddly enough all of our founding fathers did these things. One person's floor... Violent acts were near nonexistant until Trump demanded that governors "dominate" their city's BLM protesters &amp; sent a battle ready military to Portland to have people illegally arrested &amp; detained.
Jim had incentive to lie when he answered those questions. And who exactly are these politicians about to be exposed? The ones who didn't run a pedophile ring at a pizza parlour? BTW Trump had sex with a minor supplied to him by his good friends Epstein &amp; Maxwell. He's a rapist.
May I say it? Trump is a freaking disaster, we will be lucky to get out of this alive. VOTE.
First, you look like Julia Roberts and, you're definitely badass -- and exactly the kind of person who's going to see that the country defeats Trump and his abhorrent supporters. I'd want you on my side in any fight and if you weren't I'd give up and leave while I could. üòä
You work for vets, so come see for yourself.  There are veterans of all branches of our services standing in harm's way against the forces Trump sent to "dominate" American citizens. People genuinely committed to standing up to the tyranny of a cowardly draft dodging president.
Can the Denver Nuggets talk to Trump too?
SILENT?   No. MAJORITY?  Not even close.  (Remember, Trump lost the popular vote by over 3 million votes in 2016) And it doesn't matter how enthusiastically you cast your vote, it's just one vote.  You don't get points for style. I'm a lifelong Republican and I can't stand him.
This low-bar is the recipe for NEVER getting any closer to progressive policies that are necessary for survival of our species.  Merely UN-doing the damage done by Trump is not even close to enough.
His support for Trump helped convince me to vote for him. But he's just all over the place these days. As recently as before Independence Day he was against lockdowns and mask mandates now he seemingly supports them? I think he may be in the early stages of dementia.
Trump's White Suburban Dream
Trump is hated.
I ABHOR Trump, he is immoral, deplorable and dangerously senile.
Unless Trump wanted to show "gratitude"
Gotta drive into Springfield tomorrow, I pray it‚Äôs not burnt to the ground and a new Trump talking point. üïä
Oh my god. Are you serious? I'm a lifelong Republican and I wanted this to work - but Trump is a horrible person and an even worse president WHO LIES EVERY SINGLE DAY ABOUT SOMETHING. You're in blind denial and you HAVE to stop watching FOX news and start doing your own research.
Sick of our sorry state? But you're alright with all the police killings?  With a president who swears at his rallies &amp; calls for violence against people who disagree with him? A president who's alienated every country on earth but Russia? Trump is the cause of our current state!
fuck 12. fuck trump. fuck white supremacy. fuck a ‚Äúblue lives matter‚Äù bitch.
Trump literally has no idea on what is going on with anything
Trump continues to prove he is an awful, awful man.
Before Trump sent forces to Portland things were peaceful - mostly graffiti. The focus had been on BLM &amp; the PPD. When federal forces arrived that changed. People marched FOR BLM &amp; AGAINST Trump's call for cities to "dominate" protesters with violence. Another Kent State? Why?
Part of me hopes #Trump does win in #November2020  because it looks like #Democrats will be taking control of both #Senate and #House and they WILL #impeach the SOB for #obstruction of justice.
I doubt she stands a chance in a rematch. Last time conservative nevertrumpers like me basically sat out, but because of dem tolerance for terrorism as long as they could use it to blame Trump and tyrannical dem govs, I will be voting for Trump this time and I am not alone.
One of the most important rights we have as Americans is the freedom to protest against our government. It sets us apart from nations like Russia &amp; China. Things were under control in Portland until Trump decided people should be shot for painting graffiti on a federal building.
March 2019.  Trump added 4 trillion to the debt with almost a trillion dollar deficit and the trumpers promptly forgot all the crap they used to say about Obama's debt.
Trump is not an American.

5. trump and "energy dominance in the permian basin"  and this in the watching opec line of journalism

Watch trump's face melt.
In the most recent report by  8.8% of America's whites live in poverty while 52% of people of blacks, Hispanics &amp; Asians live in poverty. Trump didn't have to say anything about color because the term "low income housing" did that for him. Be curious.
Oregon Hates You Donald Trump!!
Trump till hammer her record from the left and the right. As DA she let cop killers escape justice and refused to seek the death penalty in numerous high profile cases.  Too many skeletons in her closet
We're also 1,682 days into the Trump Administration and I'm still waiting for Infrastructure Week.  Creating jobs and rebuilding bridges, dams, and roads should have a bipartisan approach,
At least he is not a TRAITOR to his country, nor a RUSSIAN ASSET, as Trump is. BIDEN as CIC, would not allow our soliders to be murdered by Putin bounties w/o ordering an investigation. He would definitely retaliate against such an atrocity, not make excuses for Putin's actions!
In 2017 caucasians accounted for a whopping 8.8% of the country's impoverished. By saying "low income" housing, Trump is saying "non-whites." Grow up and get real.
Isn't it amazing that the ONLY city leaders Trump declares as not doing their job, are DEM led cities! Sending in his STORM TROOPERS to these cities is for HIS personal political purposes only. He ordered videos be made for use in campaign ads, which the Dems will gladly use!
Now contemplate why he was chosen as Obama's VP. Then think of Cheney, who was Bush's "baby sitter" and papa Bush who was Reagan's. Now look at Trump and Pence. Notice how Bush Sr. had Quayle as impeachment insurance? We are lied to about the true role of the VP in modern times.
No.  He said "low income" housing -- which is racist code for POC. Grow up and face the facts.  Trump is catering to affluent white Americans.   PERIOD. The rest of us can suck balls.
Vote for Trump? NEVER.
This is what makes Trump 'Putins Wet Dream'. Not mine originally but still the best description I've seen.
Putin wd hv told Trump not to talk such nonsense.
Trump is feathering his pillow getting ready for post-Presidential life.
Lmao your experience was better than mine. My guards were awful and all I had was trump propaganda running in twitmo#
The only way trump and GOP can win. Spread the word.
You're a legend in your own mind, tRump.
How do you not figure? Trump set the bar so low you have to dig underground to get beneath it.
And Trump knew the consequences and could have saved the country the pain and deaths, what happens when you elect an incompetent racist as President.
Gov. DeSantis' too busy kissing Trump's ass; he can't be bothered to notice the new cases/deaths.
Most of our politicians, especially Trump, could not qualify for most scientific or technical jobs. And yet they control the fate of our country! Something is wrong with this system.
gratifying day.  1. gov. brown announces feds out, locals in, in portland. federalism crisis ended. 2. bezos fails to make macy's status, fb &amp; g have a vbad hair day. 3. jcs comply with trump piss on merkle dick move in a way that increases strike readiness on russians. brill!
Trump.
Why is the GOP letting Trump destroy the progress we've over the past decades. The laws that were in place to protect us are being killed by Trump and the GOP. It's now ok again to refuse to rent or sell a home if your skin is dark. Racism was never ok.
John, Why don‚Äôt you offer to join the administration to set them straight? Trump is a delightful person - smart as Hell, kind, generous, forgiving, and a man of great sartorial elegance. I think you would enjoy each other. He has the best words.
if trump wins we get vodka and caviar. its a win-win
Trump says if hadn‚Äôt brought in the troops to Portland it would have burn down  here‚Äôs a map of Portland. The protestors site is circled.
DONALD says that testing is the problem: the more you test, the more cases you will have. In that case, why is he tested every day? Isn‚Äôt that risky? Being tested every day does not make it less likely that Trump will contract COVID-19. It simply ensures that he will know quickly
A stunt was obvious and didn‚Äôt work. Trump is abominable.  Hint Donnie: that‚Äôs not good.  #TrumpGestapo
Because politicians want it to be. Trump, in particular, finds ways to turn any bold action into something that can be made a partisan issue.
Also, Trump wants to define suburbans as "white" and ban all low-income housing projects in suburbs. Can we assume Biden disagrees?
So how expensive would it be to deploy these jack-boots, and if protestors are smart enough to stay home until they redeploy might the campaign video become too expensive?  Can Trump afford to look too eager?
The truly sad part is that Trump is the only one who could actually pull this off

Trump using an SS/Gustapo style military police should raise a flag, unless you liked the Dictator/Fascist playbook. If someone arrests you without reading you your Miranda Rights or presenting identification you should have the right to defend yourself.

And there‚Äôs the time when trump had to be chased down to take him back to the waiting limousine parked directly in front of Air Force one.  So please don‚Äôt make up shit.
I do not like Joe Biden. But if you need a difference between Biden and Trump it‚Äôs that Biden actually wants to govern the country. Will he do it well? Depends who you ask. But right now we‚Äôre managed by people who proudly, aggressively, do not know what the fuck they are doing
Trump is a sadistic sociopath. He is a TRAITOR to our country. After we Kick him out of our White House and convict him of Crimes Against America, embezzlement and Treason, then we can forget him, and fix our nation.
Kamehamehafuck ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù to the President by the Vice President.  They both need to be loyal to the constitution, and the people above all else.  We need a VP who will pull the e-brake on any POTUS who tries to Trump out again.
democrats lied and cheated for trump. and their only chance of livingthat down is if he wins again. then they will say no one told them that could happen, just like 2016
Sorry for your luck but you are following Trump
Are you kidding me? With Trump in charge, you ask that question.
you will forever go down in history linked to trump and to rapey o'kavanaugh. you are shamefully dishonest.
that's not defending jobs. that's making it clear that trump plans to make sure average citizens will keep paying the $100s of billions in govt handouts for profitable companies. &amp; it gives energy an unfair advantage over competing businesses.

Trump has lambasted the prime ministers of every allie that we have but never uttered a single sentence or issues one tweet being even mildly critical of Putin and Russia. Trump would call his own mother names so for him to never criticize Putin is as telling as anything

Trump wants delay the US elections because does not believe he can Win.
Look Trump is unfit for office. He has demonstrated that time and again since before he took office. He seems incapable of even understanding the talking points of any policy no matter how simple or basic. He is as amoral a human being as there is is on the planet.
Because Trump isn‚Äôt losing because of Covid he is the victim of political suicide. Russia puts bounties in USA soldiers and he responds by calling it fake news. Trump sends in his ICE Goons to rough up Portland protesters, Pull troops Germany - political suicide.
Those are simply facts. If youre freaking out about stated facts, try freaking out about the fact that he didnt have to catch covid &amp; die- he chose to go to trump's nonsocially distant rally without a mask on. He was responsible for his own health&amp; he chose to not mask up. #facts

NATO may be your religion, but why are Americans footing all the bill for Europe's defense? Trump has a point here.
Nope, don't believe it.  This is just like when Trump claimed he'd already been taking it. This is a set up so that a week from now he can declare "it cured me, what a miracle drug!" This is just theater for brownie points with Trump.
If trump would go see a damn doctor they might be able to help him but hes too stubborn to admit there might be something wrong with him!
Does that mean we can fire TRUMP - what about people's bill getting to creditors on time - we need pictures sent to the press to prove this and then we should put the post master and the rest of them in jail

Exactly. People should focus on Trump's corruption.
It shows that the guy recently Trump installed his purposely sabotaging the performance of the US postal service.  Try and keep up MAGAT.
I'm surprised Trump would retweet this because if you watch it, it is an indictment on the performance of USPS after he installed one of his lackeys to run it.  However I suspect the right-wing rubes commenting won't even watch it.

I have decided the only way to watch a trump press conference is to pretend I am at a comedy club.
My pushback was only on the idea that people were peddling around here that we were only having ‚Äúthe‚Äù election in Nov because Trump hadn‚Äôt delayed it yet.  He has no LEGAL basis to do a thing.  Obviously you can try to break the rules but we need to be clear that it‚Äôd be ILLEGAL.
Trump is looking/sounding/acting worse than ever
Pod people
Please media don't say Trump's tone is different. He mentioned the dead quickly &amp; used racist language. No statement on how he killed Mr. Cain.
The next Trump could be much worse than Trump. Trump is not the root of our problems. Only a symptom.   Also, there's no guarantee Yang will be in the administration and no guarantee that's even the best move for him.
To be super clear, Trump - or any Prez - has no LEGAL authority over elections.  - Elections are administered by states - Election Day is set by law - EC vote date is set by law - Inauguration Day is in the 20th Amendment  Please stop giving the guy space in your heads.  Stop.
OK, please stop this.  Trump cannot "slide" anything and he has zero power over elections.  No President does.  You #AltGov types are giving people the idea that there's credence to this idea when there isn't.  He has no LEGAL way to do a thing here.
Wants everyone to vote ANTI Trump and FOR the clueless old guy - even the illegals here, the dead and all the people of China using mailed ballots. Lots of ballots ready, willing and stamped. Just give the word.
I believe you are correct. Should have known the balls deep in her sister thing gave it away. That statement is too clever for trump. Still thought it was funny. Be clear it isn't really him. Love you.
I just need people to stop assuming Trump has any LEGAL authority over anything related to elections.  Our laws and constitution are painful clear in this way - he does not.  The only way he does anything else is illegally, and he's mostly a coward, so I doubt anything happens.
Herman cain died because he believed trump instead of the scientists.  It is called Republican Jihad.

trump has done his best to destroy the country. Looks like the mofo is succeeding.
Those are simply facts. If youre freaking out about stated facts, try freaking out about the fact that he didnt have to catch covid &amp; die- he chose to go to trump's nonsocially distant rally without a mask on. He was responsible for his own health&amp; he chose to not mask up. #facts
Cain knew the risks but took them anyway...but Trump was kind of encouraging it and set up the rally to begin with.
I mean, Trump has a path but it's a pretty dicey and narrow one right now due to his polling numbers.
HE Died of Stage 4 Colon Cancer...but of COURSE all the Liberals want to TELL THAT narrative and blame Trump.  The guy had free will and looked happy he was there!! He supported his President!!
Basically, yes.  I mean, one can talk about this all day.  Now, Trump could challenge some results here and there (and he will in a CIVIL suit) but that's VERY different from delaying an election.  Zero power here.
Wasn't it wonderful??  At was at once sad (reminding me what true intelligence/compassion/empathy we lost when Trump won) while filling me full of resolve and determination to make the changes needed for us to heal as a people and as a country.
Are you next to die for Trump?

It's all based on a BS premise.  Trump does what he wants RIGHT NOW because he can exploit LEGAL loopholes and the power of the presidency.  On 1/20/2021, if the elections that HE DOESN'T RUN vote him out, this power is gone.  What then?  He has no power to exploit.
Makes me cry that so many are blindly following trump &amp; gop politicians... to their deaths.

This isn‚Äôt even remotely up for interpretation by a Supreme Court.  If they affirmed LGBTQ rights and that Trump needs to hand over tax records on this court, I‚Äôm hard-pressed to see them somehow cancelling an election.  Sorry.
Short version:  - Mike Pompeo and Bill Barr are observers - Donald Trump‚Äôs only power is a pen to sign bills - we don‚Äôt have federal elections in the USA - this all was expressly the design of the Founders - remember, they abhorred central executive power
"And while President #Trump obviously is the source of our juvenile response, Congress also passed three emergency bills with trillions of dollars for relief but almost no instructions or resources for reopening."  It never had to be like this. You know why it is.
Currently in Baker City, Oregon and can‚Äôt even count the number of ‚Äúoregunian‚Äù stickers and trump flags..
I wish I had any faith that the Trump Administration would actually abide by this?
What election can Trump and Barr delay?  There isn‚Äôt AN election.  There are 51 and not just for President.  They can announce whatever they want.  So can I.  Neither of us has the power to do so.  Stop tweeting this.
don't know who is responsible for the messaging coming out of the mouth of Donald Trump. Racist rhetoric killed him in the suburbs in 2018. It is a losing tactic for 2020. It's over. Donald Trump is history. Talk him into resigning now to end this nightmare.
"Trump appears to be the only one floating this extreme measure months out from Election Day."  ABC, have you been paying attention? They've hinted at this multiple times.
Uh, Pompeo needs to do a quick search and read up.  The DOJ has zero power.  Only Congress and the Constitution do...and the statutes are clear.
Exactly.
Biden called this shit months ago and the trump lickers mocked him for it.
My guess is that this video was of something else and someone dubbed over a voice.  I mean, clever but ain‚Äôt no way O‚ÄôKeefe is knifing Trump.  I‚Äôll need something more than this to buy it.
Encouraging swing voter news for Trump:  "These voters tell me they want America finally to be put first; they oppose immigration and trade policies they say give benefits to foreigners at their expense."
Omg! I hadn't heard that. Trump killed him. He fell for it.
Also:
Yup, precisely.  Also...
It looks like the Trump comb over, but with too much hair üòÜ
Reminder that Trump can yak all he wants here.  He has zero power.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
The date of the election of the Electors and the date of the EC vote are set by law (Nov and Dec), and Inauguration Day is set by constitutional amendment (20th).  So, unless these laws are changed and we amend the Constitution, Trump‚Äôs signature after a loss will be powerless.
Reminder that there isn‚Äôt AN election, there are 51, and we‚Äôre actually electing Electors, not the President.  So everyone on your feed is clear, here‚Äôs what it would take to actually do this.  Trump is shouting at the wind.
You misspelled Donald Trump

Sorry students of 2045, here is the Graph. Notice the lack of data after the Entry into the Trump curve. After this time measurement of GDP was considered ‚ÄúFake News‚Äù which was a term coined by the Russian Asset Trumo to mean ‚ÄúInconvienent‚Äù
Typically these things still exist, but measurement of them ceases to have utility, hence the term Trump curve. Which relates to to measuring something of futility. This is not applied to the Trump members family IQ which although asymptotic never actually approaches zero.
Experiencing a Trump curve will cease to be measured, for one thing or another.  This is also used for things experiencing exponential growth or decay, again which cease to be measured. Such as COVID deaths. 2/

TRump is playing to Daddy. He wants Daddy to fix things for him. So he has reverted to Daddy‚Äôs world to try to win the election. Sorry, Donnie, we will not go back to 1950. #ThursdayThoughts
The United States has entered the beginning of the ‚ÄúTrump Curve‚Äù.
32% decline is a signal that we are Entering the start of a Trump curve.
Yet I trust USPS more than hacked voting machines &amp; other polling shutdowns.  No matter how we choose to vote, the Big Loser trump + complicit, corrupt gop + putin &amp; his criminals will be interfering hard.
A 32% decline in GDP according to economists of the future is the sign of entering a ‚ÄúTrump curve‚Äù.
Looks like a Trump curve.  Economists will be using the term ‚ÄúTrump Curve‚Äù to describe cash flow declines and other statistics gathered by things Donald Trump ran throughout his life.
At this point a Magic 8 Ball would make better decisions than Trump

Trump successfully removed 12,000 troops from Germany while no one was watching.  This Portland diversion seems to have been successful.
It's the only way they do. It won't go well for them this year tho. If they cheat the streets will be chaos because tRump will lose by a landslide. The only people left who like him are batshit crazy people. Fortunately they aren't the majority.
where are you? Trump cannot be allowed to pull 12k troops out of Germany! If you do not stop this you have handed the entire country over to Russia. And you wondered why we focused on Russia. If you don't stop this you will be easily replaced in Nov as you should.

Regardless, as Trump himself has stated, local policing is the responsibility of LOCAL police forces and only when they abdicate that responsibility should federal forces step in to do the job.

From listening to Barr one would think the only time the tRump/Barr feds clash with Portland protesters is after the protesters get ‚Äúviolent‚Äù and the ‚Äúfew‚Äù feds there come from inside the so-called Justice Center. This is categorically untrue! Protesters are surrounded by Feds!

Since 2017, we‚Äôve mopped up.  So, yeah, to some extent, we do have power but it wasn‚Äôt granted to us.  We worked our asses off and won a ton of local, state, and federal elections, many times expressly running against Trump and his supporters.  I call that ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù.
They didn‚Äôt from 2001-2006.  I agree.  They had lost a bunch of elections and let their institutions go to shit.  We‚Äôve built power and won lots of elections since 2006, save for 2010.    2014 was a red-wave year and Trump won in 2016.  Not sure where you‚Äôre going here.
Of course he won‚Äôt because everything that John Lewis represented and fought for is a threat to Trump. #trumpisracist

Reagan was way more popular than Trump at that time. We'll see.
I agree that nixon's ability to admit he should resign and then doing so was far more human than anything trump has ever done, anywhere.
I've been asking for a while, too, a question that goes with that:  Who is bankrolling all of this... foreign interests who want to help trump take down the US?  This is damned expensive, and there was no congressional approval anyone's heard of for using tax $ this way.
I can't take of my skin color to make Trump supporters not spit on me in public (yes this happened to me)
And personally if you wanna wear that hat you are asking for drama.   Trump supporters attack women for being women, POC for being POC. Y'all get "attacked" for wearing the hat. Take off the hat and see if Dems physically attack you like Trump supporters.
Over lapping Black with Trump supporter....doesn't give a clear reason. It could've been for his skin color or his political views. Or ANYTHING. Also I wouldn't say it happens more to y'all. Y'all just wear Trump hats and people get annoyed.

We're not in that much of a pickle.  Trump is lazy and losing, not to mention he's a coward when push comes to shove.  I mean, we need to kick his ass but he hasn't done the hard work to actually do much beyond piss and moan about people being unfair to him.

There is always polling error - though often they cancel each other out - but there could be an error that favors Biden just as easily as it could favor Trump.
And this year shows that 4% isn't needed.  FL, PA, MI, and WI are all in the Biden+7 to +8 world and the national polls are at Biden+8.  This means that it'd take Trump getting down to Biden+1 or so for it to matter.
Right now the tipping-point-state polling averages are about 1 pt in Trump‚Äôs direction (Biden+7) as compared to the country (Biden+8).  That means that it‚Äôs need to be MUCH closer for the PV-EV issue to be relevant this time.

Trump doesn‚Äôt want to get booed in NYC, I‚Äôd be the first one to boo the Cheater.
I said it'd been going on for weeks - yes, some losers were the bitter-enders - but that the city had it under control.  There wasn't anything "raging out of control".  It was some idiots causing problems downtown and the city was on it.  Then Trump showed up and here we are.
At this point, Trump sent in his shock troops against the will of the city and state - they were handling the situation just fine - and, as such, now the city has stepped back because they disagree with the strategy.  Nothing here was out of control at any point.
While I get his point here, notice that basically nothing is happening other than a broken-down fence and some fireworks.  This has been happening for weeks...and the PPB has been fighting some bitter-ender protestors (like 50) until Trump decided to escalate for votes.
I have a joke about America‚Äôs President, Donald Trump.

You realize, if the Feds left (or never came in) this probably would've started to peeter out... They were down to 150 people before Trump sent the Feds in. What youre seeing now is parents &amp; a city reacting to having Feds called on our kids. Trump caused this.

That doesn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôm white, I‚Äôm marrying a black man, I‚Äôm extremely progressive, so I‚Äôm usually on board with being critical of white people as a whole. But I refuse to take responsibility for trump when I hate everything he stands for and had no part in electing him.
Is it a conspiracy if Putin helps Trump win the election and Trump gives Putin a bunch of strategic wins but there is no handshake?
Yes, I agree that Trump could be impeached  again, for multiple reasons. That said, I no longer see this is a useful thing to do. The Republican senate‚Äîstill‚Äîwould never convict. I look forward to November, and I fully expect many of these senators to be out of a job.
Hey trump, tell us how you really feel!
I'm not sure how badly the damage to NATO is even if Trump loses but it's kind of nuts that odds seem pretty decent that NATO falls apart if he wins.
The Trump campaign giving up on Michigan is a huge victory for America.   The tide is turning.
Just like the great Trump days again. He never dreamed he could some great day discriminate housing in the whole country. GREAT AGAIN and so fast. Racist.i Fire the SOB Nov3.
Truth of the matter is, Trump hates Germany because they‚Äôre no longer Nazis.
I live 20 miles south of Portland and since Memorial Day this year I‚Äôve flown my flag high and proud.  I do not and will never support Trump and his MAGA farce.  It‚Äôs lit at night too!
I have no doubt Trump is flattered by the attention he‚Äôs gotten from the fanboys. He‚Äôs doing them a solid by occupying Portland.
The more I sit with French's argument, the more it feels like the purported justifications in the transactional case for Trump. French seems like a very good guy who I have a lot of respect for. But we know where that path leads. #NeverVichy
Nice he is going to house them all at Trump Tower instead right since Trump Tower already has low life living there ?
oh fuck that im not going to do that I'll hire a lawyer and then see her in court and pull a Trump and make her pay for my legal fees
Seriously, your great at writing tweets that sound exactly what #trump would say...yep I think he got you beat this time!! No lol ü§Ø
What were the terms of federal troop removal fromPortland? What if any agreements were made. Trump didnt walk away empty handed unless he was threatened into ending his invasion of Portland. What are the conditions of this withdrawal?
Trump actually doesn‚Äôt like Germany because they‚Äôre not Nazis anymore.
I mean, it depends what's being discussed and how far back we go. As the party stands, it's a desiccated husk surrounded by Trump-brand shrine candles. There are reasonable discussions to be had on approaches to handling issues, but they won't make those arguments
Trump believes vodoo doctors‚Äô reasoning instead of science. He won‚Äôt say anything against it. Deamons and illumanati. Does he really believe that stuff?  What will his evangelical base think of this?
If Trump feels strongly about it, he needs to get rid of you.
Americans receiveing unemployment benefits must continue to get the $600 a week with them. Most recipients are eligible for around $300 a week. Trump knows nothing about needing financial help to survive.
Reminder that yes Pence replacing Trump would have made a real difference in terms of things like competence and not tossing matches in powderkegs
Portland needs to stop protesting or it will be remembered that Portland singlehandedly handed Trump the presidency in November
Not what Trump said this morning
That‚Äôs not what Trump said this morning
Problem is that if the feint is fun enough for him, this is a step towards an attempt to expand the Putin empire.  If WWIII comes in the next decade, historians will look back to this moment, and to Trump‚Äôs election, as major points on the path to war.
It‚Äôs called an arrest. Shame on you. Thanks for helping Trump
So they break ground on Trump Tower Moscow in what, February 2021?
Is this what trump meant when he said they may have to come in and ‚Äúclean out‚Äù the cities?
We have a constitution. As I know you know, and it says nothing about the feds enforcing those laws off federal property but that‚Äôs the incindiary rhetoric that Trump and Barr are using.
#WhyIDontLikeTrump interesting thread. Your daily reminder that supporting Conservative Ideals does not mean you blindly support Trump.   For the record / because he makes people I‚Äôm close with feel lesser, and seemingly makes it ok for Americans to treat minorities lesser too.
Trump by a large margin this year.
It seems entirely obvious to me, that if Donald Trump really loved America, he would take an immunity deal and resign his position.  His only goal is re-election and that results in actions not favoring the USA.
Trump voted by mail because of security purposes. It would cost the taxpayers thousands to protect the president and his family to vote in public. Don't play dumb... oh wait.
Seeing my mother who is 101.  Last saw her in February. In 2 weeks I will see her for 20 minutes with social distancing.  She does not understand all of this. Not allowed even to take her for a ride. This is not what I wanted for her final years.  I blame Trump.
you are legacy is 150, 000 death , and corrupt man, who help trump by covering up he crime.
Outstanding cross examination of Barr‚Äôs dismantling of our rights as citizens in the constitution. Who will step up to the duty of removing Trump, Barr and the entire Republican administration? Nancy, your boots are ready for walking now.
150, 000 citizen had died to trump,! No mask , no social distance. Wow . Make American death again.
Not talking about a cure.  Manufacturing a cure.  Big difference.  Can‚Äôt stand Trump, but at least this sounds helpful.
Totally appropriate for Trump in office and 2020.
Sarah Cooper praying right now that Trump does not start pitching all of the things from that doc
Trump said it first.  Barr is just Trump‚Äôs mouthpiece, lapdog, you name it!
Ain‚Äôt that the truth. It was a preplaned TV op for D‚Äôrats to sling more BS at Trump from their positions of power to the ignoramouses out there who slurp up these lies.
Wow, just wow.  Stella Immanuel, Trump‚Äôs New COVID-19 Doctor, Believes in Alien DNA, Demon Sperm, and Hydroxychloroquine

John Bolton: "According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do"  Republican members of Congress: *crickets*
2/2 So long as that remains the case, it may prove hard for Me. Trump to escalate the situation even further."
Dear Joe, Please start now and make a list of all the things trump has failed, (it will b long), that way when he denies it, if you are caught off guard by whatever he says next, you have 150 other things to say. There is proof.#TrumpFailed #Traitor 1,2,3....150. Weluvu
Would you empathize with Trump if he got shot in the face with pepper spray?
Under your watch: out of control pandemic; race wars; violent crimes up nationally; highest unemployment in decades; impeachment; we are laughing stock to world. All because we have an incompetent loser in you Mr. Trump.#LiarInChief
"the elevation by President Trump and his collaborators of Trump‚Äôs own personal interests over the interests of the country allowed Putin to succeed beyond Stalin‚Äôs wildest dreams, and how the national security implications of Putin‚Äôs triumph will persist"
I am and he hates trump!
These morons are WHY there's a President Trump.  Live with it.
I used too. And then she met Trump. Had there been an ounce of integrity she would have remained governor.
I totally think the Trump movie, called ‚ÄúGreat‚Äù could be a riff on the first Toby Maguire ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù, focusing on this theme:                      With Comes      Great     Responsibility                   Power  In this one, though, the flawed protagonist never learns.
PLEASE ensure that they DO NOT make any cuts to Social Security as Trump and McConnell have been suggesting.
the worst part for Obama is that he had everything stacked against him, he was black w/an Islamic name, it brought out all those who wanted to be racist and could get away with it. Trump capitalized on it. If you don't want to give Obama credit you cant give trump credit
We made it thru 8 yrs under his most hated Obama with nary a whiff of this and, in fact, he cleaned up the mess the Rs left. Now we are in midst of pandemic, major civil unrest, and cratered economy under Trump. Biden will be left to clean it up again.
The problem seems that no one wants to hear the truth and no one seems to have the balls to tell it. Trump has put up a facade his entire life. People act like he was a great guy, but no one liked him, people wanted to see him fail, same now
I get your reasoning... i think Trump was the ideal anti politician when he ran, but even if he is or isn't controlled by his enormous debts that we could debate on forever. He looks weak when he won't admit a mistake. I think going deep state is a little far fetched but Biden
they got tried of everyone for 60 days and they want stop i heard trump is sending more feds here in portland or. hope you guys enjoy roiting everynight.
And what makes Trump better than that?
On top of that, there is a good chance Trump wouldn't even do any debates, so it makes sense for Biden to agree to the standard three debates.
Donald J. Trump
The only thing that could have made your President Trump interview better was if the White House chef came out with his/her pizza for a Portnoy review. The Donald was asleep at the switch. First time for him.
My daughter and I ran into this personally at a 7-11 when the owner flipped out over a Trump Pez dispenser, started yelling how trump was the greatest and eventually banned us from coming back because we are not trumpsters
I completely supply Trump not going
Trump is scraping the bottom of the barrel for speakers for his convention these are second run past time speakers they are not stars anymore if ever.
Peaceful protesters in Portland are being shoved out by thugs sent from somewhere I believe that they are white supremacists that they gather to shake things up and are from Trump.
Bro, haven‚Äôt you figured it out yet. It‚Äôs only going to be Trumps fault. No matter how many receipts you show about why shit is happening, it‚Äôs always about Trump.  There are no critical thinkers anymore, just sheep!
Facebook‚Äôs ads use OUR user data to let Trump spread lies and suppress voting. We need oversight bodies to investigate #Facebook and act.
You are responsable of many death ...you decide to cover trump  for money. Here  your the legacy  #MoscowMitch  , give trillion to wealthy, trump colaborador,  russia agent, kill 150,000 plusc american, racist, !
‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs shortcomings have perplexed even some of his most loyal allies, who increasingly have wondered why the president has not at least pantomimed a sense of command over the crisis or conveyed compassion for the millions of Americans impacted by it.‚Äú
The British clearly see what a mess fake president trump really is...
Trump's America.  Putin told him to do this -- to "dominate"
Trump vowed to dismantle climate and environmental policies aimed to provide clean air, water. And he has!  While we are fighting a mismanaged pandemic, his administration has completed 68 rollbacks with 32 more in progress for a total of 100.  scripts:
Girl trump supporters infuriate me so much like bro did u not get the memo he doesn‚Äôt think were human
With all the coverage of protests, let‚Äôs not forget what Trump is trying to distract us from...
We know exactly how much each of them golfed.  Exactly. Trump has golfed more in 3 1/2 years than Obama did in 8 years. One of more than 20000 lies, documented and continuing.
There is no equivalency between the left and the right .. The right and Trump are literally trying to destroy every shred of decency in this country.
Yep, Trump will be choking on it Nov 3rd. He created this division.
Just like fake president trump...  Hurricane Hanna Has Knocked Down Trump‚Äôs Border Wall  via
Is this supposed to offset the everyday, many times a day, hypocrisies spewed by Trump admin. Get real.
l believe the violence in Portland‚Äôs street is caused by persons sent in by a source meant to have them cause as much trouble as they can. Keeping Portland in the news so Trump can justify the federal force and pound his chest for publicity.
Not just you.

Vote Trump OUT in November. Everyone at the protests and at home can't be pulled into a false sense of security. Like it or not, we NEED to elect Biden. Otherwise, we fall further into dictatorship. #TrumpisaDictator #FascistGOP #fascistTrump #TrumpsGestapo #gestapoLEAVEPortland

Yes mostly downtown. It used to be fun to go out at night downtown with tons of great bars, restaurants &amp; live music venues. That all changed Ain 2016 when Trump was elected &amp; those protests started, now with Covid 19 &amp; BLM protests it has all changed.
LMAO! Funny how you folks always assume I love Trump...We do agree there is a difference &amp; now maybe we can agree that rioting is the issue here &amp; Cops are trying to stop it? I‚Äôm all for protesting, but it has turned to rioting &amp; that‚Äôs not on the Cops...and no need for ugliness
Giancarlo we need your help to not allow trump to throw out the first pitch on 8/15.  I have been a Yankee fan since 1960 and although I now live in Portland, OR I still watch every game. I am saddened to think the team I love will become a prop in his campaign. Save the Yanks.
Meadows joins Trump in excusing and providing cover for Putin.
Trump needs to be impeached until he's removed. It's ok we didn't get him out last time. Your effort made you a hero. If at first you do not succeed try try again. We love you Nancy. #ImpeachTrumpAgain #ImpeachBarr #ImpeachBarrNOW #ImpeachDeSantis
The protesters are keeping the area very clean, including the public bathroom. No fires either. So stop tweeting Trump‚Äôs propaganda.

Fake president trump should be executed for crimes against humanity.
Trump is trying to turn our country into authoritarian rule and they are worried about a damn mask.     Idiots!

Remind you of Bush 2004 signs? It made no sense... Nothing was better yet that didn't matter to people. I do think a few more of the Trump 2020 signs will be desecrated than Bush 2004 ones in the end. Hopefully those 2020 signs will be the end of his woefully embarrassing legacy.
I will say that this later comparison from Trump was a pretty good one:   "The [coronavirus] tests are all perfect, like the letter ‚Äî was perfect."
I‚Äôm not much of a drinker but I did have a stroke and I totally blame Trump.
This video shows how feds have systematically escalated the violence in PDX protests. Trump doesn't care about the protests - he cares about votes. Every city with #BlackLivesMatter protests is getting feds installed to quell them.

I also wonder if there are a number of people who voted Trump in 2016 and know they made a mistake but will not publicly admit it.
Joe Biden has been indicted in Ukraine. And has been shown he's proud of it all. "Well, son of a bitch, he was fired".  Are those the types of crimes Trump commited?   #Trump2020LandslideVictory  #DonJr2024
What "crime" are you referring to that needed investigating?  Hillary &amp; DNC paid Christopher Steele for dossier, through Fusion GPS.  Hillary campaign manager, John Podesta, under oath said it's true.  Carter Page left Trump campaign BEFORE the FISA warrant issued. 1/x

It‚Äôs just another day of how I can make it about me to Trump.
Like Trump,  has not admitted defeat and will not turnover power after a free and democratic election. This is dictatorship.
he only says he‚Äôs Christian so he can keep his white Christian followers...if you don‚Äôt agree with that statement then you‚Äôre obviously putting trump before your godü§® please reread your bible and educate yourself
here‚Äôs what I mean, the Bible says ‚ÄúDo you have daughters? Be concerned for their chastity, and do not show yourself too indulgent with them.",  during a 2006 interview with The Rolling Stones, trump said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve said if Ivanka weren‚Äôt my daughter, perhaps I‚Äôd be dating her.‚Äù
the picture was literally a quote from the PRESIDENT talking about how nothing is more powerful than godü§®if trump suddenly said he doesn‚Äôt believe in god anymore I guaranteed half y‚Äôall would say that too lol, trump is not a true Christian, reread the Bible you fraud

Trump is literally killing his voters and his reelection chances.
I agree with this video's sentiment Let's say the protesters stay home... Trump's response will be to claim victory and use it as an example of how strong arm tactics work The argument that he's going to jail if he loses is unlikely based on Biden's desire to get "back to normal"

This is intentional. This is the calculated destruction of a major government service and it will 100% affect the election. If Trump can't postpone the election, he will do anything in his power to rig it.

ü§£ü§£ü§£ Yeah, go on believing that nonsense. tRump* sent his Stormtroopers to my city, just as the protests were winding down. He owns all of this death &amp; destruction. ALL OF IT.
FULL RETREAT of Trump's troopers.  No concessions from the State or Oregon.  Did Oregon‚Äôs governor convince feds to leave? Or did President Trump abandon strategy to bring law and order to Democratic-led cities?
Trump just keeps losing. Beautiful.
I know it's true but find hard to actually believe that some people hated him SO MUCH that Donald Trump seemed like a fantastic corrective.
Nope. It would take an act of Congress. tRump*'s getting really desperate, isn't he?
Republicans believe Joe Biden winning will whack stocks. Democrats presume re-electing Donald Trump is double trouble. A clear secret: they‚Äôre both wrong. Here's why, according to
Of course. For a Trump life is ratings
Was he ‚Äúforced‚Äù to attend? No! He ‚Äúchose‚Äù to go to please his hero, fuck-head tRump. If all fuck-head‚Äôs loyal tRumptards stopped going, maybe fuck-head tRump would stop spreading the tRumpvirus! ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Because today we honor a real man and trump can‚Äôt handle it.
That said, the second trump dropped a Nuke (regardless of where) the whole world would be at our throat and would all team up to wipe this continent off the face of the earth.
I don't disagree with you. That said, the second trump starts bombing his own country after retaining office by force, I'm pretty sure the rest of the allied world would declare war on the US to fight this new fascist superpower
Trump suggests DELAYING election until votes are 'secure' | Daily Mail Online
And before somebody says "but Covid!": We would have gotten Covid either way, but Trump's inaction and anti-science talk has made the crisis this bad.
This is called missing the point.  Rallies like the one in Tulsa are irresponsible specifically because there are people in our society who are vulnerable. It isn‚Äôt the fault of those who are vulnerable. It‚Äôs the fault of those ratcheting the risk up to 11 like Trump
"I don't like Trump, but he's good for the economy," said my neighbor, less than a year ago.
WE aren't confused.  Donald TRUMP IS CONFUSED!
With Biden the US might end up like the rest of the world did without the economic near depression trump has put us in. The US is on course with other third world countries like Brazil! The USA is no longer the global leader and respected as a democracy!
We already know that while the law itself won't bend to his will, enforcement of it will. I have a strong suspicion that when the time comes, he will refuse to leave office. When that day comes, I just hope the military backs their country not Trump.
According to these fuckers, three men (all corrupt to the core) could just decide to ignore the Constitution and install Trump as president forever.
So you trust trump with weapons???
According to Trump, COVID-19 is not a big enough threat to convert to online schools temporarily, but IS a big enough threat to delay the election (while pushing back against the same mail-in process he uses himself?) Yet another reason - #WhyIDontLikeTrump
Definitely worth a read.
I won‚Äôt trash the media bec we need them. If we cry ‚Äúfake news‚Äù Trump wins. I don‚Äôt count FOX as media.  I do encourage them all to DO BETTER.
Well I just posted how tacky for Trump to post something trivial while ppl are dying. Then I did it. Difference being, I am not POTUS!
I know you wouldn‚Äôt believe it unless you saw it yourselves. This is what Trump is tweeting about this am. He is promoting a Pizza Parlor! What does one say to that when people are dying? This Pizza prevents COVID-19- take it, what do you have to lose?
"Under the 20th Amendment, ‚Äúthe terms of the President and the Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d [sic] day of January.‚Äù
Trump- ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt take responsibility at all.‚Äù   America's economy just had its worst quarter on record - CNN
Imagine telling your kids you voted for Donald Trump. I‚Äôm not only the 2016 but the 2020 election. Couldn‚Äôt be me.
I haven‚Äôt seen you pop up on my TL in a year probably. Glad to hear you! Will anyone say out loud that Trump is responsible? Not likely.
I had a feeling the reports that the feds were leaving cities wasn‚Äôt going to happen. We will see if this is Trump lying again (potentially to distract from Maxwell deposition that should drop soon) or if he plans on sending them back after agreeing for them to leave
This is all you need to know as to what kind of a heartless and soulless person Trump really is.
Herman Cain‚Äôs death was exactly as preventable as 150,000 (or more!) other Americans. And Donald Trump and the GOP are exactly as responsible for every one of them.
Good citizens don't work with criminals! If you can't see that trumps a criminal you should not vote because youre a uninformed citizen. Citizens should vote based on the canidates qualifications and experience not popularity. Trump has no experience with civil service it shows!
Called it.
What, you mean to tell me that anyone that wants a test can get a test was another big trump lie?
Trump is trying to pull a Palpatine while also having to play the part of Jar Jar and to me there is nothing more fitting in this world.
I feel sorry for anyone who might have listened to Herman Cain and contacted Covid as a result. Not sorry for Herman- he made an informed choice I presume. Although you could blame Trump to some extent. Cain didn‚Äôt understand Trump.
Holy shit, Herman Cain is now dead because of Trump.
You know why he is entertaining and isnt shoving his politics down everyones throats. Second you bitch about Trump and go on a Twitter tyraid what is wrong with you seek mental help and go do something with yourself instead of living on Twitter
How do I apply to be one of your staff tweeters?  Show my degree from Trump University, take a kid‚Äôs lollipop and claim I‚Äôm the victim?  Oh wait, I just have to be a lying, fear-mongoring, hypocritical, racist, misogynistic, greedy, narcissistic asshole.  #fakepotus
There is #truth hiding somewhere in this summer filled with hydroxychloroquine headlines.  This is looking like a guaranteed scandal, Trump was maligned for speaking about it so there is a fire where the smoke originated.
Nope Donny. You will not have a second season playing the role of president. We are cancelling your stupid show in November n you'll be FIRED!!!  Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
tRump is a 100% corrupt, treasonous shit weasel
TRUMP IS RIGHT
Next line from Trump.... ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gong to win anyway, our polls are good. Since that‚Äôs the case, We can hold it in 2024.‚Äù
I like Donald Trump.
Yes.  Sides have been drawn.  Trump's support has been holding steady at about 40% .  It's down from his avg of about 45% but close to his all time low.  Support is in the south but waning in his swing states in 2016.  MI, WI, MN are looking at Biden.   N-S again.
With their masks,,,,, they are ALL ANTIFA!  .... Trump can't stop us!!
Yes, because that‚Äôs what makes us different from Trump‚Äôs followers.
If you think Trump isn‚Äôt gonna use troops to steal the election, you‚Äôre not paying attention.
Interfere in our elections and spread disinformation? Sounds like Donald Trump.
That looks good? I guess if you see a line instead of affected real ppl maybe. Suspicious how numbers dropped as soon as CDC was no long allowed to report. Trump stooges at HHS took over and poof, miracle, the cases drop. Funny though cause hospitalizations haven‚Äôt. You‚Äôre scum!
Common sense President!!!       Trump 2020!!!
That looks good to you? I guess if you see a line instead of affected real ppl maybe. Suspicious how numbers dropped as soon as CDC was no long allowed to report. Trump lackeys at HHS took over and poof, miracle, the cases drop. Funny though cause hospitalizations haven‚Äôt.
trump only picks the best doctors, to work for him.
Okay, speaking of follow up to false stories, I posted and celebrated our Governor‚Äôs announcement that feds were leaving. Pence told her they would but Trump must‚Äôve intervened. Mikey Pence is in trouuuuuble!
We deserve to know is someone (Trump?) paid her to fabricate that story, IMO
Don‚Äôt retweet this. It might trigger the 7 yo tRump. üëäüèºü§£üëçüèº Would be a shame if people started leaving mashed potatoes ü•î for trump  #THEREIDOUT    lol üòÇ  #Trumtator #TatordicDony ‚úåüèºü§™
The protests were winding down, until the Stormtroopers arrived. What a stupid, typical tRump* pitch for reelection. He's a waste of air.
Trump has golfed 365 days. One full year, 1/4 of his presidency. #LaziestPresidentEver #LockHimUp
Trump only hires the best people, and it just so happens that those people are only loyal to Trump.
What inspired so much hate in you, so many lies and deceit have blinded you. You believe the dems are commies, however the Republican Dictator Donald Trump is best friends with the worst communists alive. Explain that.
With all of Trump's recommendations of lysol disinfectant, bleach, hydroxychloroquine, medicine made from aliens DNA and not having to wear a mask, why hell!! are people still getting sick???
I‚Äôd take this with a huge grain of salt, as the Trump Administration has been known to lie.
Seems like Trump will do what it takes to reverse all the progress we had under Obama, because "big scary black man bad, me am good."
One of these days, even the most unqualified, Trump appointed judges are going to get fed up w his disrespecting them &amp; turn on him.  In fact, maybe other judges should subtly encourage it.  LOL... hey!  all's fair in love &amp; war, right?
Trump is so oblivious that he doesn‚Äôt understand this is racist
Anyone who supports trump can get out of my life and go straight to fucking hell
Shouldn‚Äôt you have red on your pages instead of blue?  Are you ashamed of it?  anyone who supports Trump is immoral.
After Kate lied to us on Twitter claiming she spoke to VP Pence about Feds leaving PDX; Here‚Äôs the actual response from President Trump. Kate and Ted should both resign, this is treason to our city and our state.
Here‚Äôs the actual response from President Trump. Kate and Ted should both resign, this is treason to our city and our state.
President Trump claims Portland is actually just one building.
To lefties, it's a lie when Trump gives an opinion they don't like.  But when they actually lie through their teeth, they expect us all to believe their BS.
"So there‚Äôs the plan: manufacture as much propaganda for Trump‚Äôs campaign as possible ahead of the election, then use police power and the justice system if at all possible to overturn or call into question the will of the people."
Amusing how Trump adds that jarring "Enjoy!" as though he were a waiter serving an app platter.
A new FBI building so Trump doesn‚Äôt get a competing Hotel? Cutting extended unemployment by 400 a week? Fuck you. This isn‚Äôt on Dems.
I'm from his district.  Don't count on do nothing Richie Neal.  He's been feeding from the well of corporate monopolies for far too long.  Pharmaceutical companies, Blackstone.  The same firm that makes contributions to Donald Trump.  Richie is not our friend.  He needs to go!
Excellent interview showing incompetent Trump
Pt taken, but I don‚Äôt care if trump thinks he won. Moving forward w/ solutions in Portland, truth and reconciliation is slowly happening. If we get goons outta here, the solutions will come to fruition faster. BLM being the focus again!
It's true, but at least Trump and Wolf can't swoop in to save the PPB from a fresh round of lawsuits. And who knows? Since Mayor Wheeler got gassed himself, he might change. He might stop letting the PPB beat us, or he'll give the PPB over to Hardesty.
ü§î contradicting stories. I‚Äôll believe the pull out when I see it. I don‚Äôt have much faith in our governor and less in Trump. So ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Gassing peaceful protesters, WAILING on a man for just standing there, destroying food and medical tents that aren't even on federal property. Once Trump is out, you will both have to answer for your numerous crimes. üçøüçøüçø
And the Trump admin would never set a blue state governor up to look like a failure, right?
Yet youre all in for traitor tot trump. Russian bounties etc etc
It's clear by now that the president is an authoritarian who is personally invested in Portland as a show of force. Fox News will report this as a surrender. Trump will freak the fuck out and send more troops. I'd put money on it.
She's doesn't 'side with rioters'. Those rioters were hired; white supremacists. The protesting was winding down when tRump* sent in his Stormtroopers. He's the failure.
Sharp contrast to Trump's childlike bold-letter notes about...I don't remember what, exactly, but they probably weren't notes reminding him of the good in an opponent. "Biden's notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris"  via
Donald Trump is a horse's ass for Russia. I think that was it. Pass it on.
He never talked to Trump....you need to inject it or shove it up your butt with a glow lamp.
Trump 2020!! You're liberal Democrat party a little sad!!!  By the way I like the Republican stance $600  Unemployment benefit.   NONE!!!üòÜüòÜüòÜ
Hey far right Evangelical Trump supporters.. whataboutism big time..
Really the only thing we can hope is that once trump is out of office he will be convicted for all of his crimes in the Whitehouse.
People come and go in Trump's life so fast its like watching Bewitched. I think Trump is Ezmarelda.
Mr Woods I would like to thank you for your support of President Trump. I live near Portland, Oregon and in the 53 years I've lived here I never thought  our beautiful state and Portland is turned into a Democratic shithole. Keep up the great support
How many more Americans are going to die because Trump endorses a total nut job instead of real medical scientists?  Unfortunately some people will believe what he says.
I guess the only good thing here? These aren't feds, so Trump and Wolf can't save them.
Excellent question.  If we could prove it, we'd have them nabbed, for a while anyway.  Flynn &amp; Stone walked.  Manafort will soon be pardoned.  Trump will .... ???
What about Bernell Trammell? Did his life matter? If he had cried out for his mother would you have showed up for him?
Don't be one of those people that thinks "Well Trump won in 2016, why bother again this year?" Don't vote Kanye, or whatever new celebrity moron (like Kanye) who has NO IDEA what they're doing. People did that in 2016, and look where we are now.
Well then, Trump got what he wanted.  He found a weak, very weak, &amp; trumped up (excuse the pun) excuse to use Erik Prince's men to go into PDX &amp; raise a little hell, blame it on the protesters &amp; then Trump sent in his unholy calvary.  PDX was 1st.  Chicago is next in line.
Big Tech shutting down truth to protect Biden. It‚Äôs time for Trump to shut down big tech!
Imo this describes trump. Church leaders are exploiting followers to protect their wealthy businesses.
No shit!
barr's rules don't apply to minorities or low income individuals reguardless of their age. his rules only are used for rich people. maxwel will get off easy too. she has too much info on too many rich people in high places including the trump family.They're friends says djt.
You are correct. What the Hillary Clinton Campaign and the Obama Administration did to spy against Trump using foreign agents and the FVEY intelligence agencies is indeed a crime.
Like tRump* being voted out of office? Sweet dreams, Rex!
Farcebook? Don‚Äôt have one. I‚Äôm not mad. I‚Äôm Trump proud! You mad! Lol!
Just. Like. Portland.  We all must band together and fight the assholes who are helping to get tRump* reelected!
We Live our GREAT PRESIDENT. If CRAZY Nancy hates TRUMP. Then he's doing a GREAT. Job. TRUMP 2020
w/ Brian Williams is taking Trump's quacks apart.
Then tell the GOP to stop paying them. The peaceful protest was winding down until tRump* sent in his Gestapo for reelection points.
Yes, Barr needs to go. He is not America‚Äôs attorney but Trump‚Äôs.
This is Trump‚Äôs America!!
Biden is crap and Trump is crap and Democrats suck and Republicans suck and there is no reason to expect good things any time soon even though we need them all like, yesterday.  the end
Just another day in the Trump Dumpster Fire. #ImpeachTrumpAgain
Stay non violent! We don‚Äôt want to give Trump an excuse to declare Martial Law. Hope I see you there!!
Take care; get some rest.  Trump just announced he'll keep his troops here until OCTOBER!!  *smh*  Rest up.‚òÆÔ∏è
It's OUR time, so sit down. tRump*'s going down.
Ahhhhh, I see. Are you my moral superior, then? Please tell me, did Bernell Trammell‚Äôs life matter? Who was there to protect him? Please, I‚Äôll wait....
It's remarkable that this is only happening in the shithole cities that are crying "Fuck Trump!" #TrumpsGestapo
JANUARY 2021  [A mob of rebellious patriots drag Donald Trump out of the White House kicking and screaming, smashing their way through the makeshift barricade to save America.]  JOE BIDEN: Wonderful! Now, arrest them for the property damage this anarchy caused. This is the way.
Donald Trump is at least 97.4% Nazi and Joe Biden is a cop-coddling piece of shit who can't wait to tell you to stop hoping for anything meaningful. Vote accordingly.
They would burn this country to the ground if they think they can defeat Trump in doing so. Fools. The crocodile they are appeasing will eat them too.
Aside from the obvious advantage, another is that IF Trump's private army wants to persist - which they do, they'll have to leave the Fed building area.  In other words they will be FAR off-base - which can be easily documented.  Make them pursue you!  IMHO
Bots &amp; trolls are all out today supporting this fake information.  Do not believe these fakes!  A conservative dark-money group was behind the press event that created a viral propaganda moment shared by Donald Trump and his eldest son.  via
Is it a hot take to want our awesome protesters to move to Pioneer Squ or somewhere where Trump can‚Äôt say he is protecting federal property? I really want to know what ppl think, but nicely, pls!
Yes because it‚Äôs Kate‚Äôs show and she could care less about anything other then hating on Donald trump and hurting the economy.   We have had twice as many fatal car accidents in Oregon this year then  Covid deaths but she is not stopping cars from being driven
This is total bullshit. Problems are caused by A small portion of the overall group.  Thousands of people are there protesting against trumps dictatorial over-reach.   Crowds were down to less than 200 per night until Trump sent in his goon squad. Now they regularly are over 1500
Today, I found out that 4 out of 5 neighbors are tRump* supporters. What I find amusing is that tRump* cares nothing about the USA.
I give directly to the Trump Campaign. I don't send money to the RNC or NRCC.
Oregon, Kate Brown shut us down very early. Cases low but with all the tRump stormtroopers causing all the mayham downtown, it could get worse soon.
Yet social media companies let lies and various falsehoods penetrate their companies' forum about a ridiculously expensive Trump-Russia collusion hoax. Where was the proof they were telling the truth. THERE WAS NONE. Facebook and Twitter needs to be sued and take your proof.
üîäüîäüîä here ya go lol üòÇ  his fake house of wings was not far off from his real tRump stakes. ü§£ü§£
No, unless Fauci approved. Birx and Trump are not credible.
I have to hand it to Trump, Barr, McEnany - they face the enemy with real courage. Nobody on the left does this - they take pot shots and run for the hills like true cowards.
This is a total lie. This was taken in 2017, and they aren't teachers. Stop believing everything tRump* says.
This is why McConnell was in such a frenzy to get judgeships filled with THEIR ppl, whether or not they were qualified.  He couldn't care less as long as they vote with Trump!
OüëèüèªMüëèüèªG ... why is hydroxychloroquine such a thing? Does trump secretly own the company that makes it? Seriously. WHY?
tRump* is speaking, but saying nothing. Get your mercenaries out of our city; Oregonians aren't trying to burn down the courthouse. Stop lying about a 'cure' for COVID-19. Stop pushing states to reopen. Stop putting your makeup on all by yourself. Just....stop. Please.
He's telling cops all over that.  He's telling the white supremacists he's got their backs.  He's telling Americans to  drink disinfectant &amp; bleach &amp; there is no need to wear masks cuz COVID will be gone in a couple of weeks.  This exceeds stupidity!  TRUMP IS TRYING TO KILL US!
RIGHT! .... it works!  #1. give 'em enuf rope &amp; they'll hang themselves.  &amp; couple that with -   #2. a zebra doesn't change it's stripes.  So, wait long enuf &amp; they'll do themselves in!  Works every time, just have patience.  Trump's empire is unraveling now.  TRUST!
It could be made into a relect Trump campaign ad. Also a slogan. Reclaim your time America, vote Trump 2020.
WHAT NONSENSE!!  No wonder they keep data from the CDC!!  Now can y'all see why Trump really hates the MSM?  Why he hates science?!  WHY he has withdrawn the USA from NATO, UN, WHO, ad infinitum  Science doesn't allow them to just make shit up! ... &amp; that's what the do.  MSU!
Seriously worst time to be a PATRIOT AND AMERICAN in this disgusting JUNGLE of DISRESPECTUL DEM CONGRESS a gross overreach of the simple truth and facts just pure BS run on sheer hatred # TRUMP 2020 all the wayüá≤üáæ
bernie can you please stop being the exact president we need right now, inadvertently reminding us of the shit-pit we're in by having to think of how awful trump and biden are and how terribly disappointing your campaign was?  thanks
but, but, did he look at the facts?  He has a BA in History from Yale &amp; he doesn't look at facts.  How many Floridians died of COVID because he was chumming up Trump?
The White House Rose Garden has begun it's transformation from the old Kennedy days to new wave under the scrutinizing eyes of Melania Trump.  In Phase I you see that construction has begun.  In Phase II, the wall surrounding the garden's inside edge has been completed.
Exactly. Barr is a detestable liar. Portland was selected as their test city several yrs ago; Proud Boys et al bussed in from WA State &amp; caused riots in the summer. Members spotted in current crowd. Highly suspect they started the probs that 'allowed' Trump to send in his troops.
Fuck i wish i was high too. But like a responsible adult i save my vices for after work is done. Sure is funny the Democrats didnt want closed borders then bam they 180 on that idea. Dam if he does damed if doesnt with Trump when it comes to you left wing nut jobs
Says the person who tear gassed peaceful protesters, soMoron Trump can get a photo op, with a bible in front of the church
You can take that view but you really should have some evidence for it. There is none. It is merely self serving rhetoric. Or more directly- just repeating more of Trump‚Äôs lies.
Numbers dont lie. Ny is the highest death rate in the entire world but please explain how the idiot did a great job. Oh and Trump orange man bad
Are you high. Washington state was the original epicenter of the china virus. And then NY became the highest death rate of all the US. And he shits on Trump. You shit on Trump cause Trump didnt know how bad china virus would be. Hmmm sure is funny how idiots logic works eh
This is the kind of BS that does not belong in COVID relief bill. Take it n any Democrat BS out of the final version of the bill!!  Republican coronavirus bill seeks to fund Pentagon projects that were cut to pay for Trump's border wall
Agree.... maybe Uncle Vlad helped out?  Maybe it's a money laundering scheme?  Maybe the non-dead Koch Brother helped?  or maybe it has nothing to do w Trump....ü§ïü§Ø
I heard that Trump was using his own money to keep the stock market up.  I have NO back-up on that, but have been curious about all the dramatic UPS &amp; DOWNS of the Dow over the last year or so.
For those who follow Trump and think he has a point:
Ahh beautiful Russia. Good faith ally of the United States. No possible way they have any connections to Deutsche bank and trump crime family.
I think it's just a gentle reminder that tRump* is a total con man, cheater, &amp; liar.
The unidentified Trump/Barr storm troopers whisked ppl off the PDX streets w/o reason; no Miranda; nothing.  These are some photos of 2 Portland citizens. The mercenaries shoot at the forehead &amp; eyes to maximize the terror. They did NOTHING wrong.  Video:
So doesn‚Äôt that make trump and his cronies the Reptilians?
Barr is Trump's personal attorney.  It is NOT supposed to be that way.  The Attorney General of the USA is supposed to be 'The People's Attorney.'  Make no mistake, Barr works for Trump.  He lies &amp; manipulates for Trump.  Barr circumscribes THE LAW for Trump.  Barr is Trump's #1!
THIS is just a taste of what is going on in Portland OR.  Chicago is next.  THIS is aftermath of Trump's idea of a National Police Force!  Violence!  "... don't be too nice" says Trump to troops.  Head &amp; eye shots are best to intimidate.  These are peaceful citizens NOT criminals
The doctor in the article you were supporting. You remember the article at the beginning of the thread that you say backs you up. üòπ your ‚ÄúChristianity‚Äù looks rather immature at best, to follow such an immoral and corrupt man. Do you really think the media is lying to get trump?
any time we criticize the dems the response is, "I guess you want more trump", not "I guess you want a progressive platform".
I‚Äôve known some insecure folks in my life. I‚Äôve known some who brag and embellish. I‚Äôve known some narcissists. But nobody I‚Äôve personally met comes close to Trump-level insecurity, false bravado, or narcissism.

Anderson Cooper: Here's how Trump spent his weekend while people were dying
Trump better be happy about coming in second.  I see the writing on the walls he tried and failed to build
Trump is still misleading us. He is still lying to us.  Dr Fauci is so respected in his field.  Why is Trump TRYING to discredit Dr Fauci?  Because we know Trump has been hiding information and lying to the American public and to the world.
Legend has it that Reagan immediately joked about it. "Honey, I forgot to duck." trump on the other hand.
MITCH (DAMNED) MCCONNELL !!  He is the one!  He wanted those tax cuts &amp; by hell or highwater.  He (w Trump &amp; Putin) must have had kompromat on ea GOP congressional member and/or offered them millions.  Forefathers would never have imagined such a traitor in our own Congress.
OMG... I didn't know that.  Trump compared a national police force similar to Brazil &amp; I thought WTF?!  BRAZIL!? He must spend part of his executive time looking for new ways to terrorize ppl.
They only follow order from Trump via others. They know Trump has their back.  Look at all the criminals he has pardoned.
Right!  'POTUS 101' - but Trump missed that briefing.  Lol
I hope so. I've spent a lot of time around military ppl, my husband was USAF, I worked f every branch of the svc &amp; I'm proud of US military. Trump has been horribly disrespectful to all intel svcs from day 1.  I'll be anxious 2 hear what our Twitter attorneys have 2 say abt this.
Prince doesn't get his hands dirty; he's a behind the scenes type of guy. Chad is out to make a name for himself. Why he thinks he will fair any better than his predecessors or other cabinet level officials, I don't know.  Chad carries out Trump's orders. Prince feeds him advice.
Don‚Äôt! I don‚Äôt agree with him on Trump but don‚Äôt try and get him involved with Epstein! ü§¨
Aides Say Trump May Have Accidentally Committed Three Felonies in One Day  via
Trump would empty the Federal coffers to get his way in PDX.
But you left out why they are protesting...because of the actions of the malignant sadistic narcissist and pathological liar Trump. Anyone who supports him is immoral.
'When' he lies, ARREST HIM!  If he lies to Congress, ARREST HIM!  STOP pussy footing around w these dangerous men.  Same w Erik Prince.  ARREST him.  He lied to Congress, arrest him.  Bring him B4 congress again &amp; when he lies, ARREST HIM.  Trump can't do it by himself.
Trump/Barr/Miller are the culprits.  Chad was 'acting' director &amp; his official time period is up but Trump keeps him on.  Trump trumps all laws.
OMGosh.... just tonite I thought of buying a gun, too.  I've lived a long life w/o one, but the times have changed.  At least I have no small children at home.   This is out of hand &amp; Trump will only ramp up; he knows nothing else.
Yes, I did! They broke his hand in two places. It is inexcusable! I have been to the protests in Portland and the majority of people are peaceful but people are angry about the Trump Administration overreach.
Trump using feds in Portland to create national police force
Dude you can fuck ALLLLLLLL the way off with that nonsense. Voting for a non-viable candidate guarantees 4 more years of Trump which might very well be the end of this country. Not to mention if the idiots who voted 3rd party in 2016 had voted Clinton we wouldn‚Äôt be in this mess.
Trump has also ordered the Post Office (USPS) to SLOW DOWN.  He's imposed a freeze &amp; the word is you do NOT have to finished delivering the mail on the same day.  THIS IS NOT THE USUAL USPS POLICY.
There is a gaggle of traitors in the GOP Congress now.  Trump swore an oath to defend &amp; protect the constitution.  I remember.  As he began, I got out of my chair &amp; walked up to the TV &amp; watched every syllable he uttered &amp; when he finished I said out loud "You better gd mean it!"
Court said the state didn't have standing to sue, so now the protesters themselves are suing. Good. Portland Protesters File Suit Against Trump Administration Over Federal Response
If it is an illegal order, they cannot and will not.  Unless Trump finds a way to control the military.  Will Trump postpone elections?
So that's why Trump is getting his own private army (courtesy of Erik Prince).  His army loves brutality (as does Trump) &amp; will do whatever he says.  That will include beating the pulp out of men, women &amp; even children.
'These are his people': inside the elite border patrol unit Trump sent to Portland  This is a chilling inside look at the agents at the center of the #PortlandProtests.  Get #Trump &amp; all #Republicans out of office. #BlackLivesMatter #VoteTrumpOut
Trump &amp; friends have, and ARE, breaking the law every day.  Major lawsuits have been filed but they continue.  #1.  They were NOT invited to Portland; they just arrived.  They were asked to leave by the governor &amp; mayor.  They weren't here legally in the first place.
Twitter removed a Trump tweet.
Isn‚Äôt it amazing how he said there were ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù in Charlottesville but can‚Äôt say the same for the protestors? If you don‚Äôt see a problem with this, you are putting in effort to be ignorant.   Each day it gets harder and harder to show any respect to Trump supporters
Yes.  Here we go.  Trump mentioned various LE agencies to be included w the one, national force.  It's a brutal group.    It IS "BIG BROTHER."  ........ no kidding.
I watched it on video, but this should do.
Oh, well that's what Trump just said on the news.  He must be WRONG, again.
Trump is creating a National Police Force.  Portland is the pilot ground, Chicago is next.  Now, we have an even bigger problem as Erik Prince is front &amp; center in this.  Is this the beginning of the 21st Century US Civil War, Part II?   How do we survive w storm troopers?
I'm sorry you feel that way. tRump* is pulling the wool over all your eyes. btw, if you were aware of his corruption and evil, why do you follow him? He's not transparent. He's pure evil.

tRump* and the GOP are the freeloaders. They are draining the fed fund as we speak. Open your eyes!‚ÄúPresident Trump outdid himself this morning with a tweet floating the idea of delaying the election.  Obviously, this is an incendiary and absurd idea unworthy of being spoken ‚Äî or even thought ‚Äî by a president of the United States.‚Äù  editors
Trump virus, shared freely among Trump supporters. Louie didn't want to be outdone so he shared it with BARR and his republican colleagues during the Barr hearing.
President Trump, let‚Äôs be clear. You will never, ever be thought of, respected and loved like Congressman John Lewis was by this country. May the honorable John Lewis Rest In Peace. May YOU lose your presidency on 11/3. We shall overcome!
And Donald Trump isn‚Äôt.... so, what does your point have to do with anything right now.  Trump has flushed the GOP right down the sewer, and they didn‚Äôt do anything to stop him.
That isn't a surprise. Trump has been this way his entire life. Just ask his niece, Mary. The surprising thing is no matter what he does doesn't matter to the GOP. Trump's GOP approval remains high. Donations remain strong. He is unequivocally the Republican nominee regardless.
President Trump said if the situation doesn't improve, he'll use the National Guard to "clean out this beehive of terrorists" in Portland.
either lives in cognitive dissonance island. or supports pedophilia. You have to be lost to not see the entire establishment is against trump, as he signs executive orders combating human and child trafficking.. nothing to see here folks.
I don't think any Democrat would mind welcoming President Pelosi. Let's say the election happens, Biden wins, Trump cries fraud, it ends up in court and he refuses to leave. I think if January 20th comes &amp; Trump hasn't left, the speaker can call the Secret Service or US Marshals.
Because he‚Äôs making money. Both trump and his crime family are profiting from being in power. #foreignmoney  #TrumpCrimeFamily
No way in hell am I going to take having some closeted trump voter with a fucking alpha complex tell me I cant socialize with my own community.  Ally my fucking ass. Allies that takeover queer spaces then try and tell queer people what they can and cant do ARE NOT ALLIES.

do not pick  pick    A reminder sir, I'm voting for you ONLY because you're not Trump.
Trump tweeted delay election to change conversation ya'll.   15 min earlier it was reported that the last economic quarter was 'the worst in American history'.   That's why he tweeted it but yes he &amp; Republicans would end elections while in power if they could.   BTW, those....
Government is hijacked. So who rules over who? Certainly the people have no voice despite the cacophony of noise in the streets. Trump rules with impunity. We keep thinking we're headed toward the cliff of authoritarianism when we're already in freefall awaiting a big awakening.
We stop looking at Trump &amp; recognize he is the distraction. Trump didn't select himself, elect himself nor can he protect himself. The Republican Party was, is and will remain the enemy that enables &amp; empowers a criminal-minded white supremacist POTUS to do their dirty work.
Trump* will never measure up to Barack Obama. Not in esteem. Not in accomplishments. Not in oratory. And he knows it. #NobodyLikesTrump
Or to distract the press from the glorious celebration of John Lewis' life and the soaring oratory of Barack Obama's beautiful eulogy. Something Trump* cannot even aspire to because he has no empathy.

With trump, it‚Äôs a crap shoot how things will play out. But I do feel there is a method to his madness.
The Crime-Fraud exception says there is no attorney-client privilege in a conspiracy to commit crimes. Besides we went through all of that before Cohen's trial. Trump tried to claim attorney-client privilege and the documents provided showed very little actual legal work done.
Congress has "power of the purse". Election day is determined by Statute and cannot be changed by anyone. The Constitution sets parameters, Congress decides when, States determine how to conduct presidential elections. Trump doesn't have the power to cancel or delay the election.
Kate Brown and the Trump administration are providing conflicting messages about the status of federal officers in Portland.
Trump will never be anywhere near the soaring orator and beloved President that was and is Barack Obama!
Donald Trump just letting MIKE PENCE know that he has NO RIGHT to INTEFERE with his REELECTION CAMPAIGN!
#WeWillVote here in Oregon. Trump must go....to jail after he‚Äôs voted out.
constitution be damned? Barr wants to "let" Trump have foreign interference and now Trump supporters want to delay the election since they know HE WILL LOSE!!
??? is that WHY the trump campaign backs Churches that VIOLATE masking and social distancing requirements? So no masks for the campaign, a campaign that physically and mentally is starting to FEEL the results of following this "man" instead of science.
Pompeo/Trump have sold out our allies and ARE SELLING OFF OUR TECHNOLOGY. Selling arms for PROFIT while ignoring our own national security should alarm all Americans.
Ya think?  I can‚Äôt believe how many are still on the Trump train
Sorry Glenn, but I must disagree with you on this one. Only three Trump* US Attorney picks were interviewed by him personally, Jessie Liu¬†for DC,¬†Ed McNally for EDNY,¬†and Geoffrey Berman¬†for SDNY. Why? Because he wanted loyalists for the district's most likely to investigate him.
100%! Berman was a Trump* donor, served on the transition team, was one of only three potential US Attorneys personally interviewed by Trump*. He is a former law partner of Rudy Giuliani and is friends with Michael Cohen, had real estate deals with Kushners, recommended by Jared.

Trump* killed Herman Cain.

After months of political back and forth between the Trump administration and Portland elected leaders, Gov. Kate Brown said Wednesday federal officers will begin withdrawing from downtown Portland. Still, there is some confusion and skepticism.
Election day is mandated by Statute. It cannot be changed. A Trump* donor now heads USPS. There are reports of mail delays, attempts to close some Post Offices already. Oregon is exclusively vote-by-mail since 1998. Delays in receiving or returning ballots is election tampering!
Thank you Mr.President!Oregon Loves you-Portland is it‚Äôs own state of Assholes! along with all of her Democratic Governor and Mayor Buddies should all be in Jail for not doing their Job and protecting the Citizens,Buildings &amp; Cities all across America!Trump 2020üá∫üá∏
What an ass! The facts won't change regardless the form of voting we utilize. Trump is sooo outta the White House in January! I can't wait to see the look on his face when Nancy Pelosi tells him, "The People have spoken and U R soooo FIRED!"
#Trump's too little, too late #coronavirus pivot   Good article, I only hope #tRUMP-ettes read it too But we STILL can't take ANY chances EVERYONE needs to #VOTE for #Biden2020  Remember 4 years ago when we were SURE #Clinton would #win in a #landslide???
The GOP is in full frontal assault. This is not panic. This is not Trump. This is the execution of a political power play by a corrupt GOP regime that has control of a party, the White House, the Senate &amp; now 200+ courts including the Supreme Court. Incessant incredulity is dead.
Look at it from the other direction. Trump's GOP approval rating is consistently high because he was chosen to do what he has done &amp; continues to do. The GOP chose a criminal because they are criminals. They chose a white supremacist because he represents them. They seek control.
I think the last 4 years has shown me the path toward authoritarianism has no one blocking it as Trump races headlong to a pre-determined destination by the GOP.
Every day in this scandal-a-day authoritarian regime has been an indicator leading to this hair-on-fire moment in history. But for some unknown reason Trump &amp; the GOP have operated with impunity, emboldening them to ratchet up the totalitarianism toward full dictatorship.
Trump is setting up his supporters to claim that the election is fraudulent. Terrible act by the President of a Democracy!
Republicans are the actual problem. Totalitarian Trump &amp; Badd Barr are mere symptoms of a corrupt regime that took control of the White House through the power of The Grim Reaper in the Senate. We can defeat the GOP enemy by asking the GOP enemy to reign in its chosen champion.
We have certainly learned by now that Trump* goes after his enemies, never forgets a grudge. Now he has the full force of gov't as weapons. His appointed Prosecutors, IRS head, AG Barr. Russian bots &amp; Don Jr. troll Michael. Trump* himself tweeted on the anniversary of his arrest.
Totalitarian Trump says precisely the opposite of the truth that the states of Oregon &amp; Washington have long practiced.

1,000%! He knew how urgent it was to get Trump* out. That the future of our very Republic was at stake. We cannot afford to be gentle or politically correct. Trump will walk all over us. Look what he's doing now when he's cornered. Sending troops into our cities for campaign ads.
I love The Lincoln Project, Meidas Touch, Don Winslow, Vote Vets, Eleven Films and all of the groups that are using Trump*s own words against him. That's how it should be done. That's what Michael always said from the beginning. Fire with fire! You must go toe-to-toe with Trump*!
He is on home confinement with a friend. They are really trying to deny him due process. Trump never forgets a grudge.
I think so but then again we‚Äôve had bases in Germany for years. I would think Congress would have to approve. Sounds like trump is standing up for russia over Germany wtf?
Why do you say that? Not lying like you do every time you flap your lips? Maybe not so trump crazy? Your own party is abandoning you!
I remember this article! I agree Michael's speech motivated me like none of the others. Michael was right! Democrats must Fight Fire with Fire. Trump cannot be beaten w/gentleness. Look at the ads by Lincoln Project, Meidas Touch, etc. This is the only way to beat Trump!

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation says it will invest $1.2 million toward research in the Klamath Basin, the frequent site of water disputes, that the agency says will be "helpful to all the stakeholders."

Someone who can make political fun of a safety issue is a danger to society. You probably make lots of money, legally and probably otherwise, but if you can sleep at night you should be examining your morals and values. Trump Dog.

Are you kidding me? Wtf? When the director of CDC says wearing a mask all of us 9 weeks we would pretty much be over it. trump has hushed the director
If Texas is a blue state then he wants to create chaos in cities in blue states like Portland. Call martial law before nov to at least postpone the election. Texas swing state? That‚Äôs what to believe is going to happen. trump is leaving wh without a fight.
Sounds like the infamous voyage of the damned. So sad and so frightening. If Trump wasn't preoccupied with golf and Twitter and had a conscience the USA could step in.
I'm sorry, but this is a bit absurd. We're producing and exporting a lot of oil now, but how can Trump be sure America will 'never' lose this position? And should he glorify petroleum despite climate change? We need to emulate France and utilize green nuclear energy.
I followed follow back? Not a magat hate trump
This is what they have been doing with stimulus money.  Buying stock to artificially pump up the stock market to make the economy look good for Trump.  Only benefits the rich while regular folks can't pay rent or buy food due to job loss.
How does lack of money by Germany translate into weakening our country's defense? We all know why trump has has pulled troops out. A personal pique vs Merkel over not attending an impromptu G7 meeting that would have had Putin. So crazy to risk security over a bruised ego.
He‚Äôs translating what trump tweeted. Wow
He went to parties at Epstein‚Äôs PENTHOUSE. You surely know about the teen pageants where they were forced to ‚Äú walk for trump‚Äù or be excluded. We are talking 14 and 15 year olds. Why was a real estate guy hanging around teen pageants? Dipshit.
Despite a Supreme Court ruling that blocked the Trump administration from ending DACA, officials have halted new requests and limited renewals as part of an "interim action" ahead of new policy.
Yep...as expected...Trump echoing Putin line. He really does seem to have more respect for Putin than our military. Unfair contest..Putin vs our intelligence challenged head of state. Also I really believe Putin knows skeletons in Trump's closet. Manchurian Candidate. Frightening
If our Republic is to survive, we must prevent this from ever happening again: 1. Bring every member of the Trump* Crime Syndicate to justice. 2. Codify into law every "norm" Trump* challenged, ignored or litigated. 3. Challenge OLC memos in court. 4. Overturn Citizens United.
Ah..I see. All battleground states. Hope moms dads veterans health care workers are mobilizing to confront them. Optics are terrible for Trump.. Except on Fox "news" where editing and outright lying is a way of life.
Expanded unemployment benefits, set to expire Friday, remain a sticking point in debate over new relief plan as President Trump once again promotes a malaria drug as COVID-19 therapy, despite studies proving it does nothing to help.
AG Barr had direct contact with Louie Gohmert yesterday. He'll be tested today. He'll likely test negative due to incubation period. He should be put in quarantine for 14 days. I suggest the SHU at MCC. Maybe then he'll release 'at risk' inmates that aren't Trump co-conspirators.
Remember in Watergate how many DOJ officials refused to do Nixon's dirty work? How that institution has crumpled. Will take years to recover any credibility. If that's even possible. Believe Barr is Trump's puppet master. Like Cheney was to Busy
Good they are going... Damage they have done is incalculable. Seems at odds of what Trump said today. Hope all the people who suffered terrible injuries can recover physically. They were hurt by our people. Trump must get off on misery  Perhaps only emotion he has. Good job moms!
It's silly that so many Republicans refuse to wear masks, since this way the rest of us can see Trump's fecal matter smeared all over their lips and noses.

Congressional hearings have devolved into speechifying and pontificating (on both sides) instead of intelligent inquiries into serious issues. This hearing is not going to change anyone's mind or resolve a single question about Barr's conduct in defending Trump*s illegal actions.
A week after appearing to project a more serious tone about the coronavirus, President Trump is back to pushing claims that an anti-malaria drug is an effective treatment and challenging the credibility of the nation's leading infectious disease expert.

First of all. As if Republicans didn't attack Bill Clinton &amp; Obama. Right.   Secondly, for a Republican to whine about rule of law is a good laugh.   How many times has Trump talked to Putin this week Republican?
I'm not saying Pelosi completely botched 1st bail out. She got us unemployment benies.   But it was her chance. She could have refused everything &amp; forced Trump, McConnell to explain themselves.   But noo.... Wall Street said get it done &amp; Nancy obeyed her masters.

Which includes the Republican party who all shout from the rooftops "I am a Good Christian"!   Lying made their 'god's top ten list. So did cheating on wives. Usury is a sin in both bibles.   Trump's Manhatten Tower address is 666.   If u believe that stuff - it is spooky.
He wasn't suspended from Twitter. He got lunch detention.
If Trump wins critics of the Republican party will be jailed and/or disappear. #MAGA will cheer.  If Biden wins, the few corporations which own everything will bring back company stores. #DNC will issue guidelines.   America must collapse &amp; suffer for any chance of change.

He talks to Putin on the phone quite often I think. Trump* is beholden to Putin, Erdoƒüan, MBS, Xi and who knows who else. I don't know who his Handler in the White House might be, unless it's Jared.
The story about Condi Rice is that she was the one who recommended Rex Tillerson to Trump*. I have a hard time believing she would have anything to do with Trump* or that she would think Rex was qualified to be Secretary of State. Wilbur does look like he's past code date, huh!
They certainly are trying.  exposed connections between hush money pymts, corporate pay-4-play, Russian money &amp; Individual1. He represented 2 of Epstein's victims. His arrest 24 hrs after Trump*s enemies list &amp; Barr's fake exoneration letter was no coincidence.
The media &amp; the courts need to take a closer look at the cases against  His arrest less than 24 hours after Trump*s enemies list &amp; Barr's fake summary of the Mueller Report came out, add to that Trump*s relationships with Nike &amp; Berman. It stinks to high heaven!

Overheard today about Trump:  "The voices in his head are way louder than anyone else's."
That kinda good right? Now average joe who lives within the law will see trump for the criminal he is. George w took trumps gop campaign pac funds and gave to Biden campaign! Good news  #istandwithportland
I'm voting for Biden ONLY because he's not Trump.   The second Biden is sworn in, I go full on attack mode towards corporate Dems.   Enough of this shit.
Obviously 'god' hates Trump and is sending a message to America to vote him out.
If Trump fell in a forest would Fox 'News' report it?
It is absolutely fair to ask  &amp;  this question since Trump repeatedly says 'we'll see' about the question.   Oh and ask the U. S. Senators too - they're relevant. Sure they are.
I hope you‚Äôre happy trump! This is on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! You are a failure along with your thugs! This IS NOT ACCEPTABLE! But! You don‚Äôt care. Well we do! And you‚Äôre leaving the wh soon! 99 days and counting!
Why won't Joe Biden sit down with Chris Wallace for an interview like President Trump did? What is he afraid of? Tough questions like were put to Trump? Trump is going to walk all over Biden in a debate. I can't wait to see it happen.
Trump's been bragging he was going to order drug companies to bring their prices down  The scheduled meeting with top pharmaceutical executives didn't happen today - no one showed up!  I guess they didn't like being bullied to score political points  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
He hates to be where he's not the center of attention. While Lewis probably would not have minded Trump getting buried in his place, Trump has learned that it's really hard to replace a good black person, so he avoids it.
I remember that despite many other potential candidates, some vetted publicly, the first time Tillerson met Trump* in person at Trump" Tower in Dec. Of 2016, he walked out withe the nomination. Did Condi Rice really have anything to do with that? Or was that just a cover story?
Many know nothings I must endure are even to the point of knowing a smear by a Trumpkin is just that, a smear.   Got to fight back of course, but only the idiots who are #maga anyway believe Trump anymore.

She's been fearless from day one! Auntie Maxine is awesome! Do you think Putin told Trump to hire Rex to remove sanctions because of the Rosneft-Exxon deal? 19% finders fee would be of great interest to Trump*. Rex was gone less than 30 days after the deal fell apart.
I just donated to your campaign a significant percentage of my personal wealth. Hillary spent too much spotlight on denouncing and vilifying Trump: and too little on an alternative vision for America. We need an ambitious regime of diverse reforms guided by philosophic principles

Day 97 before the election, hopefully the survival of democracy.   tRump's GOP has probably done a several trillion dollar heist from the treasury to the stock market, while effing our grandkids' futures and the future of many Americans.  He could not be a worse traitor.
No, but I have noticed when I type the word, "Hydroxychloroquine," it gets changed to "a dangerous drug that's been around for 65 years and never had any complications until Trump mentioned it as a possible treatment for COVID19"
Once again you apparently can't hold complex views whatsoever. Even if Biden doesn't improve much healthcare-wise a public option better than Trump who has been trying to kick millions of people off health insurance completely with no replacement for his whole presidency.

Michael Flynn case: Appeals court to reconsider order to dismiss criminal case of ex-Trump aide
This tweet seems disingenuous.  POC are dying in the streets and all you can see that will be different is that Biden might not be as loud as Trump? You‚Äôre either a terrifically silly person, or you‚Äôre just brain dead.
This didn‚Äôt really sink in til later in my life than it should have. It started in college when I learned about atrocities the US has committed around the world, &amp; rly sunk in during Trump‚Äôs presidency cuz I haven‚Äôt been interested in celebrating this country since his election.
As I have been saying for months. Want to bring this nightmare to a quick end before January 20, 2021? Is there no one out there with both courage and resources to help end Trump's and GOP's wealth and power, quickly and dramatically? How bad must it get?

CNN: Republicans openly challenge Trump's tweet on delaying election.   via
He forgot to mention pizza guy Herman Cain. Died by drowning in his own covid infested fluids for attending a Trump rally. Ain't saying MAGA anymore .
Biden has flaws, and he is certainly isn't perfect, he is better than Trump and we need to coalesce around him only enough to get him into the White House, that doesn't mean we should hold back from criticism tho or pretend he's more amazing than he actually is.
Nothing says I have a small dick,  more than a race car plastered with trump slogans

Obama is speaking now, trump. Real class and intelligence.
Why, because all those past presidents are speaking so elequently? Obama now. Maybe that is trump‚Äôs rush.
I think by now we can admit that he‚Äôs both POTUS and a troll. We can do away with the notion of Trump being ‚Äúpresidential‚Äù.
Leave it to tRump to try and focus today about him and not the wonderful eulogys about Mr Lewis. Shame him!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Perhaps it‚Äôs all about the Pee tapes. This is all so surreal! It‚Äôs hard for me to understand why anyone in their right mind is supporting Trump after everything that has happened.
Putin is putting bounties on American heads, and Trump is doing nothing. He also removed all of the sanctions that Obama put on Russian and their oligarchs. He is SO weak on Russia that it‚Äôs hard to understand your denial.
This is *way* scarier than Trump's batsh;t crazy tweet!!!!
Instead of attending the funeral, Trump is crazy tweeting, Delay the election!" It's not unrelated he is dropping this nugget today.
Trump will say he was kidding before we know it.
Within 48 hours Trump will confirm that he was not joking... and Repiblicans will pretend nothing ever happened

Absolutely!  And when Trump is defeated he will be dragged out of  the WH at 12:01 if he refuses to leave and taken to St. E‚Äòs for a mental health hold and Evaluation.
(2/2) That's also why he's doing so much to make the COVID crisis worse (making it look like incompetence &amp; other peoples' faults). The fate of Trump and the disease are linked at the hip. He IS the disease. Wear a mask, Wash your hands, Vote the bastard out by mail. Revolt!
Trump offers the most important thing in the country and it is not very good for the people.   I mean...
Trump is a racist how can any black person who believes in #BlackLivesMatter support this man
(1/2) And there 'tis.  Trump wants to delay the 2020 election until COVID blows over because he has a conspiracy theory about #VoteByMail that isn't supported by any evidence or data and he's intentionally destroying the US Postal Service Just to be sure.
We are getting educated through the Trump presidency.  My JD is almost earned.
Why does trump care about mail in voting he knows that he‚Äôs gonna lose and saw that an error in the election will make his time last longer besides a lot of states are now voting by popular vote and it‚Äôs pretty obvious who‚Äôs gonna win that
if trump had a modicum of decency and a modicum of sense, he would address the american people, remove his entire administration (fire 'em &amp; pence resign) and then resign and admit way way way over his head in this crisis.
I was 4 the 1st time yesterday, but it was more about the Senate race in Oregon. They did ask who I was voting 4 for Pres. &amp; when I said Trump the guy said a lot in Oregon said the same.  Hopefully Oregon is going RED!
Cain: killed by trump
