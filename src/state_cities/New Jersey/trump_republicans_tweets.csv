Hey idiot....trying to imply Trump killed Herman Cain...What about your asshole brother and the nursing homes? And you riding your bicycle around outside threatening people who saw you when you were supposed to be sick with COVID?  F*ck you Cuomo.
Hey Bozo: instead of doing everything to help the Democrats why don't you to do something to help President Trump since you're supposed to be a Republican. Shutting down your state again because of other states? What's wrong with you? Post Trump Republican Party?
Not really I detest Trump but Herman Cain was a grownup capable of making his own stupid decision.
One of the more grotesque happenings of the Trump era is the rehabilitation of Bush and his gang of war criminals. Truly horrific.
Thinking about that time Trump used a hurricane for political purposes.

If Trump dropped out, I would never vote Democrat ever again after what I witnessed since Trump was elected! President Trump opened up a whole lot of corruption with the big government and the FBI and Child sex trafficking.
Not to mention that he began the speech reciting a bible passage, and trump couldn‚Äôt even name a single bible verse after saying it was his favorite book..
Trump is doing dumb stuff of course. He could have handled intelligently with the Sweden approach. Dems have proven to be worse on covid though. Look at NY state. CA implemented extreme lockdowns,  still the same outbreak.  Frankly, there is no proven approach to covid handling.
How does a Harvard law school graduate not know that DOJ does not decide when an election is held? Or does he know and just spouts this because this what trump wants to hear?
It‚Äôs not immaterial, it‚Äôs actually a fairly significant issue that gets to a fundamental question about Democrats in general and Biden in particular‚Äîif it‚Äôs so important to beat Trump, why aren‚Äôt they behaving like they actually want to win by supporting wildly popular policies
Hanging on best I can ! Fighting Trump Army every day !!!!! You doing okay ? #Biden2020 #BlueBeforeRed
One more thing to note on the distinction Trump makes between universal voting by mail and absentee voting.  Of course we have five states with extensive successful experience in exactly what he is concerned with-- including GOP-friendly Utah.
Then we can at the very least agree that the primary wasn‚Äôt any sort of referendum on policy &amp; finally put to bed this idea that Bernie lost because nobody likes any of his proposals  So if it‚Äôs that important to defeat Trump, why isn‚Äôt Biden supporting such a popular idea as M4A
‚ÄúTrump has lately become a heckler in his own government, promoting medical conspiracy theories on social media, playing no constructive role in either the management of the coronavirus pandemic or the negotiation of an economic rescue plan...‚Äù

Ok this the next jackass got Trump can you believe this
Just realized what every Trump interview will be like after he's removed from office:
Per usual, the  is weaseling. Absentee ballots are sent by local election officials to an audited list of registered voters only and returned ballots are rigorously checked by the same election officials. The integrity of the process is what he and Trump fear the most.
In honor of the life of John Lewis, I can no longer support Donald Trump...
Trump has no sense of humor. The only time he cracks a smile is when he's praising himself , checking out a woman, or sadistically insulting someone else.
He will tweet his condolences but in it he will say how much Herman Cain supported him and how he was thrilled that trump won.
Trump will get him back as a thank you from his patron.

Sad and preventable: June 20-- Cain attends rally in Tulsa that Trump was urged by health officials not to hold. June 21-28-- Cain is tested for COVID-19. June 29-- Cain receives positive test result. July 1-- Cain is hospitalized. July 30-- Cain's death is announced.

I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôve ever made you feel backed into a corner. I‚Äôve been there and I get the feeling of ‚Äúfight or flight.‚Äù I think you would be surprised to find out I‚Äôm actually relatively conservative. That is why I am so burdened by Trump‚Äôs hijacking of the R party.
Personally, I try to refrain from labeling any person or even an idea as ‚Äúracist.‚Äù That puts one in the same category as the KKK. I‚Äôm even relunctant to use that word toward Trump...something I take much heat for from my more left-leaning friends.

The continued devotion of some of the Trump cult is bizarre. The dude has always been a narcissistic POS who puts self interest above all else. He never has and never will care about his base other than for clout and continued power. Is that so hard to see?
Don‚Äôt take the trump bait. Trump needs to control the media today- terrible economic numbers and the Lewis funeral with Obama giving the eulogy.

Pointing out trump's philosophical inconsistencies might be a fun activity for journalists,  but it is a timid, enabling, and futile approach to an immediate existential threat to our Constitution.   Do what's right for our Nation, not your own self serving interests

Looks like the Trump philosophy has not changed since the 70‚Äôs when he and his KKK father were blocking non whites from their properties. George Wallace would be so proud!
I don't support the protests. It's not "good trouble" anymore.  In large part, it's fueled by the far left and full blown anarchists co-opting BLM.  We are in a pandemic--not cool.   The BLM message has already changed us.   This shit plays into Trump's hands--it's not helping.
Oh look who wants to import drugs from Canada now!? Taking a cue from Bernie I guess. Too bad Biden is too selfish to have added this to the platform. Now look...
You are just another President Trump hater but not seeing that his job under the Constitution is to protect our country. That includes Democrat cities that don't respect and hate him for no logical reason.

Yes. Trump is more a victim of himself and a victim of being raised by a driven but inattentive father.
So you have no problem with peaceful protest being shot at, manhandled, clubbed while people  legally protest. They aren't only doing this to the jerks doing bad things. These people did nothing wrong. You don't care that Trump wants this country to be his. A mighty dictator.
Boris and trump are symptoms of the same problem. This is a once-in-600 year event. It will be followed by a once-in-a-5,000 year event soon.

Trump‚Äôs New Favorite COVID Doctor Believes in Alien DNA, Demon Sperm, and Hydroxychloroquine
This is a dangerous gambit that opens the door for Trump to make a counter demand that he will only release his taxes if Biden draws a clock
Funny how pro HCQ tweets FB posts and YouTube are taken down but anti-Trump posts, no matter how defamatory or outrageous are not. Do dem supporters really not see even a little something odd about that?
Yet it doesn‚Äôt bother you that anti-Trump tweets are not taken down no matter how outrageous?
The provocateurs of violence  need to be identified and disclosed. Minneapolis police identify 'Umbrella Man' - who helped incite George Floyd riots. That's what the warrant says. Who is he and what is his affiliation? Who would suppprt Trump's law and order propaganda?
Trump's tweets are increasingly driven by narcissistic I'm a victim. Quite consistent with toxic narcissism .
In a TV ad Trump says Biden supports police defunding.That is a lie. Quote used has Biden saying "yes absolutely" in response to the question do you believe there's systematic racism in some law enforecement? Ad is just another false accusation.  Trumpsters believe lies are OK.
Haven't we been told over and over that Trump's tweets are official Administration records and statements? Barr reads them.
So if Durham report finds Biden complicit or involved in the illegal activity relating to Trump his campaign and personnel you think it should be held back and perhaps let a criminal of the highest order be elected?

In April #Trump bought more than 29 million doses of #hydroxychloroquine for potential treatment of COVID-19. ‚ÄúI bought millions of doses (of hydroxychloroquine).‚Äù Trump spent taxpayer money $$$ for a drug that is worthless in the treatment of Covid 19.

So what. Trump has been since 2015. He's way more important  and its been awful for the country.  What possibly could she have done?
I think trump will follow the same strategy that he used for PPE. Let individual governors duke it out in obtaining vaccines. That way if things go poorly he can blame the states. Cannot imagine he has a national plan.

No the Dem response was that there should be strict quarantining around the few infected. That was the virus dies there and the US can stay open. If we killed the virus once it got here and closed travel, 150k wouldn't be dead right now. Trump ignored it instead and it spread.

In a tweet Sunday, Trump blamed the turn of events on his ‚Äústrong focus‚Äù on the coronavirus, vaccines and the economy. ‚ÄúWe will make it later in the season!‚Äù he promised.
Thank God Trump doesn‚Äôt get security briefings
Yes I admit I‚Äôm concerned about his health and just want him in the presidency before he travels. Trump must be some sort of mechanical alien that he hasn‚Äôt gotten the virus or maybe they‚Äôre experimenting cures on him. Idk

President Trump can make a emergency proclamation banning all protests until law and order is restored.  This is an emergency and cannot be called unconstitutional anymore than the ban because of a virus we may catch.

Fuzzy like Trump‚Äôs brain.
Notice how "mainstream" #microsoft news makes it sound like only #Republicans would link his death to support for Trump. Notice lie that Trammell supported #BLM when sign says "Mulatto Lives Matter".
The tweets while provocative, were NOT vile, racist, nor sexist. Far less offensive than what is thrown at #Trump supporters on aalmost every late night TV show.  The real hate speech came from those who attacked him &amp;  prob caused his death.

Thank you! Sometimes you have to break it down to ppl! As you see he came back with non responses when I showed him proof! I wonder if Fox ever shows when the ppl around Trump gets the virus! His supporters act like nobody around him gets it when so many have! Public knowledge!
Yet the only administration that was unprepared was this 1! Every other administration did what they could to replenish what wasn‚Äôt available upon becoming president! Not Trump you‚Äôre still making excuses for him! I‚Äôve shown you proof and you have shown proof of what I said!
You didn‚Äôt even read what you posted, I did and you only gave proof of what I said! Trump had 3 years to replenish it and didn‚Äôt! He expected Obama to leave it to him so when it wasn‚Äôt left he just said duck it I‚Äôm not gonna replenish so my folks can be prepared! Passing blame!
Did you even read this? This states that Obama left 25% of the stockpile! He didn‚Äôt replenish it but he had what he needed when a pandemic hit him. Trump was in office for 3 yrs and didn‚Äôt replenish it o his watch! So yeah this show it was Trumps job to replenish his term!

3) his CDC I might add. He won‚Äôt share a stage with the Dr‚Äôs because he want to spread fairytale wishes and they want to handle this pandemic in a way that will help. But the reality of what they say clashes with the fantasy Trump wants to see and say!
1) They got it under control because they didn‚Äôt listen to Trump and instead followed the CDC guidelines to the best of their ability. That credit doesn‚Äôt go to Trump. It‚Äôs a NATIONAL CRISIS which means the nation needs guidance from the supposed leader and he goes against......

Trump considered John Lewis an enemy; this reflects well on Lewis, who was an enemy of bigots, white supremacists, those who would destroy democracy, and haters in general. A good and courageous man. Yes, you can know people by their friends, but even more by their enemies.
Because Trump is such a jokester, right?
I‚Äôm not at all into politics...  But do I have it right that FOX News has joined CNN in a stance against Trump? So he no longer has even a very right-leaning media company on his side?   I am back to sports as I conclude this tweet.

I know the Knicks are more popular and don‚Äôt care. I want to win games. So Please stop with it. I don‚Äôt care and it‚Äôs really annoying.

Contracted after Trump Tulsa rally. SMDH.
Violating the law is not exactly a problem for Trump.
Herman Cain died for a movement that deep down hates people like him. It makes me sad that he has died even though I wasn't a fan. And unless Trump or Ivanka get sick the "President" will not give a single, McDonalds-laced shit about this.
Worst COVID numbers in the entire world.   Trump proposes to postpone the election to avoid a Landslide Loss.  Oh and the economy is tanking.  ARE YOU TIRED OF WINNING YET!?
Nah. He's black. Trump and his ilk won't sleep over it.
Lol. Good analogy. Perhaps Trump is like King Joffrey. And Biden represents the hope and promise of Rob Stark.
Trump and his enablers continue to wage war on your post office. After deliberately slowing mail deliveries they‚Äôre now trying to unilaterally close post offices.
you called it. It had to be bad if they were ignoring him. I hope some people take it more seriously after this, but knowing Trump's base they probably won't care until it is one of their white heroes
Herman Cain should have worn a mask. Wasn't he at Trump 's rally in Oklahoma?
Trump knows he has little to no shot of winning and now he‚Äôs proposing postponing the election that will oust him from office.   If it was too early to call him a Authoritarian leader (it wasn‚Äôt) now would be the perfect time.   We‚Äôre living in dangerous times for America.

So to be perfectly clear, Joe Biden is quoted saying the following about Trump‚Äôs despicable act of brute force against peaceful protestors and Breitbart deems it necessary to fact check only that the Bible was right side up? Got it.
To anyone who understands the threat that is Donald Trump: We have to hold it together for 97 days. Do not buy into any bs or division, stay united in this one goal. When we elect Biden we will make history for this united front; a bipartisan effort to secure the democracy.
My $0.02: If there are a bunch of Trump voters lying to pollsters, are they lying about Senate and House races too? No shame for a conservative to say he's voting for Ernst in IA. Ernst would be cruising to reelection while Trump/Biden are within 1%, but she's not.
Yea, He‚Äôs a world leader, he can‚Äôt just shit on other world leaders. This is also why he says nice things about the Fat Kid too.  Notice how Canada was absent from the last USMCA trade meeting? Maybe Trudeau shouldn‚Äôt have shat on TrumpEnough with it. We get it, you love Trump.

you never proved blm protests led to a rise in cases by the way. but i can sure prove trump rallies do. cause those covidiots don't wear one. The rise in covid cases are in southern red states now. but i bet you would of never bring that up right? your main focus is blm protests
I'll fix that for you:  Glad I was able to get the very dishonest LameStream Media to finally start talking about the RISKS to our Democracy from dangerous Donald J. Trump!
The 150,000 number stands out as that is how many Americans have died thus far in the COVID19 pandemic of 2020.   Regarding George‚Äôs comment: While those 150K votes helped Lincoln win, Trump‚Äôs indifference to 150K deaths may ultimately be his undoing in this year‚Äôs election.

How about the presidents before him. Trump is horrible, but the centrists paved the way for him.

Donald J. Trump defends Putin, raped children with Epstein, raped women, kills Americans with negligence, gets impeached for treason, cheats on his wives with porn stars and hookers, and this who the GOP chooses as their moral and political leader.
With over 151,000 people in the US dead from COVID-19, the US GDP down 9.5%, and a plummeting approval rating, Trump on Thursday continued to push wildly misleading claims about mail-in voting as part of a larger, clear effort to undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 election.
When in the movie did they refer to him as a child of two worlds? And, the only reason they wanted him to leave was out of fear of Zod and company trashing the earth. And, only through Lex's machinations, did they hate him. The US government didn't help. Imagine Trump's reaction.
It's too late for anyone in the Federalist Society to salvage any sort of face. Trump is a Frankenstein's monster that took conservatives decades to make. He's a product of everything wrong with America, and those who supported him should just quit politics. Their sum is fascism.

This describes like 90% of Trump's conduct.
Trump followed the experts lead on everything, except travel. He went against their advice and banned it when everyone said don‚Äôt. He has to balance lives, economy, and freedom. He could‚Äôve done better. Not as bad as you think. Nobody knew how to handle this In the world
The question is whether Trump did it smartly or stupidly.   The biggest hidden money case I ever did was only in the vicinity of $70m, but what gave it away was a legal document that included a individual‚Äôs address on it.  The amount of paper you need to do it properly is huge.
It took Calabresi 3.5 years to realize the assertions of trump showing fascist tendencies weren‚Äôt hyperbole. And he‚Äôs a college professor. üò≥  I guess better late than never.
You and the rest of your false prophet grifter friends made up the lie that God appointed trump to be president in order to get brainless evangelicals to vote for that criminal. And you‚Äôre taking umbrage with an opinion piece?
you want trump to be the dictator we elected and rule with federal mandates? Sounds like you want him to take over and do the governors‚Äô jobs.
2/ The system really playing Trump for a fool.  Well, after the election; Trump ppl might as well do an Oliver North: hint buy the cross-cut shredder. But the  probably know a thing about that.   At least #GOP had to buy üéÇ for the Iranian guards. The #Dems, no effort. lol

I just read this whole thread thinking how sad it was that he died after all of this for fucking Trump and not wearing a mask.
That I sbsurd  gov Wallace  was  a racist   He stop  black kids  from going to school with white kids during Jim Crow law president trump is not   A racist  he support  school choice prisons reform  funds black college more jobs  for blacks  and others minorities
One of the reasons I always wear a mask in public is because I don‚Äôt want to be mistaken for a Trump supporter.
What the fuck do you mean America or trump, trump is America, what we‚Äôre up against is an insurgency looking to destroy everything about this country
How is that cancel culture? Someone does not like a person that watches their kid to associate with people that condone behavior like immorality, lying, disrespect that Trump constantly shows. It is her personal view not a culture. If he was following Satanists or Klan same thing
Go to work then matt..unand the rest of the republicans should get together alone with no masks in a room with no ventilation for at least 12 hrs and then no hospital for u since it's a hoax and ppl are exaggerating just to make ur boss trump happy about his failures as potus
Lmao she‚Äôs off her rocker as well as anyone who buys into that Qanon shit...apparently these people also believe JFK Jr. is still alive and is secretly helping Trump in the whitehouse. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse the sex demon ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù or these wackos.

Trump can get away with shooting someone in Times Square due to the republicans in the senate and house being a bunch of spineless fucks, they already tried to impeach him when he was guilty and it didn‚Äôt work why try during a pandemic when we have to worry about funding

Wait,Trump lied about something? No way. I just hope Joe will be more progressive than I expect him not to be. I hope he spends his first 100 undoing everything Trump undid of Obama's. Then Maybe by being progressive all those people who thought being liberal was bad will realize

I'm betting that was a beautiful ceremony that would have only been debased by Trump's presence. He's in a bind with this stuff and it's his fault- if he doesn't go he looks like a racist, and if he does, everyone wonders who he's trying to fool- because we know he's a racist.
Everyone is missing Trump‚Äôs endgame on delaying #ElectionDay. What if an election were held, but lawsuits stopped blue districts &amp; #SwingStates from reporting &amp; certifying results for the #ElectoralCollege? Trump would win with a smaller number of electors. 1/2

With all due respect, this piece is sorely lacking for the absence of a key, if not THE key, element influencing Trump‚Äôs motivation to run/stay: the legal jeopardy he faces once out of office.  Only question is if he thinks he‚Äôll lose (or can win) bigger electorally or legally.

Cain also was part of the arrogant, deadly misinformed Trump supporters who proudly appeared everywhere, including the recent rally, without a mask. I wonder, as he gasped his last breaths if he realized he wouldn‚Äôt be dying if he used common sense.
shouldn't be waffling at this point. It's such a shame that these grown folk, educated folk, folk with commonsense, would allow Trump, a danger to the world, to continue to disgrace the office.

My latest alongside  Arizona Rep.   Says Germany Troop Exit 'Dangerous,' Aims to Block Trump From More
Remember when conservative intellectuals embraced nationalism as a way to defend Trump? They thought Trump cared about "America first," when all he truly cares about is the Fox &amp; Friends weekend hosts saying nice things about him.
Thats exactly what a TRUMP SUPPORTER WOULD SAY.  AGAIN NOT KOOL AT ALL. YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.
Stop after the first sentence and follow it up with ‚Äúterm limits are needed bec life long politicians who accumulate to much power and control are ruining America. They are the reason Trump and every other President will fail. No chance with the antiques
If you believe there is CONCLUSIVE evidence, all you have to do is sue Trump when his term is finished. No immunity anymore. If you succeed, I will swallow my words.

When the history books about our age of pandemic &amp; protests are written, I hope we also remember these simple gestures of decency and dignity as antidotes to the tyranny &amp; racial terror of Trump.

Trump must be so grateful that in 3.5 years as president he has yet to be asked a really great question by a journalist that would knock him off his game.

Trump being part of the election gives it a crooked component.
Imagine if a journalist asked Trump the perfect GDP question--he'd probably have to resign!

Oh boy. Trump cultist.
President Obama is so everything Trump is not, kind, empathetic, knowledgeable, measured. He loved and honored John Lewis for the great man he was and all he did. One incredible human honoring another incredible human. He always knows. Just what to say.
Noam Chomsky on TV just said Trump most dangerous person in history.  That every minute Trump has been President we have moved closer to nuclear war.

I read the whistleblower's complaint and the full transcription of the phone call to find no conclusive evidence Trump asked for assistance in exchange for aid. The impeachment, if held in court, would have been dismissed. Accusing without proof = recklessness.
Look at all of the investors and Trump-brand consumers he reassured!!
It's such a relief to read that Trump won't attend. We should exclude him from our daily living. For our well-being.
We know, and thank you  He's just trying to distract from his disgustingly awful response to covid  There collapse of our economy that has contracted 32% with increasing unemployment claims  And lest we forget, trump refuses to sanction Putin for putting bounties on our soldiers
Donald John Trump?
Did u see  when the funeral was going on he put out a tweet about Herman Cain rip and what a patriot and good friend he was to him? Herman Cain got Covid19 while at the Tulsa Rally for Trump, not wearing a mask listening to Trump and died of Covid19. That Uncle Tom died for Trump

If your perspective goggles are so thick that you just pick fellow liberals you disagree with and decide they must be a trump supporter, or keen on stomping on some races, or whatever, you're annoying people who will vote Blue. That's not helping anyone.
I don't think you're arguing with the real me, just a version you made up in your head. Throughout this whole conversation you've made up a lot of stuff. If you want to debate a Trump supporter, go find one. If you want to debate a racist, go find one.

It looks now as if the Trump Administration was a big setback to this goal of a more perfect union, but perhaps not, if it works as a spring board to make progress happen faster in the future.
At no point during this crisis has Donald Trump shown a genuine concern for the health and safety of Americans.   He‚Äôs either trying to delegitimize the election with false claims of fraud or fundamentally believes he can remain in power like the authoritarian leaders he admires.

Umm...there‚Äôs a very high chance that‚Äôs where he got it.  He tested positive soon after and was in the hospital for a month before he died.  It was his choice to go to the rally, so not on Trump, but the lack of masks contributed to a major spike in OK at that time.
In practical terms, Trump cannot delay the election.  The states have been preparing for this election for years.  I doubt that secretaries of state in red states would risk trying a date change.  The third of November will come and there will be an election.

Donald Trump makes George Bush look like a decent person. Goddamn, that is something.
Obama is "clean and articulate". " Poor kids are as smart as white kids". "You ain't black" if you don't vote for me. "You can't go in a 7-11 without a slight Indian accent". Trump statements? Nope. ALL things Biden said.

Listen to yourself. What percentage of the total voting public do you think are out protesting? Not even up to 1%. Use your brain. The aim is to not spread this deadly disease. Guess what Herman Cain just died coz he got Covid from his friend Trump Tulsa rally.
Herman Cain attended Trump rallies in Keystone, SD &amp; recently in Tulsa, OK w/o a face mask. Today news filtered he died battling coronavirus w an underlying condition that is colon cancer. Cain had no other than himself to blame. No sympathy.

Why don't you worry about your state Mr. Nasty Scalise. You are a piece of work! Looking for scapegoats to cover up for the main culprit in the WH.  Over 150,000 people have died because of the poor leadership of Trump! Demand a explanation from Trump as well!
was witness to Trump's extortion attempt.  Did he himself participate or did he simply look the other way?  Thank you  to drilling down to the shameful treatment of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.  Mr. Pompeo is a coward for what he did.
There‚Äôs no way Congress will move on this. Some republicans are have spoke out against Trump the his afternoon. But he‚Äôs sowing seeds of doubt. He‚Äôs already stating that he won‚Äôt expect any election result that doesn‚Äôt see him win. Dangerous rhetoric.
Yeah but those other countries probably don‚Äôt have a lunatic in office. Trump might not have the power to stop the election but he‚Äôs sowing seeds of doubt in the process. He will not go quietly.

Laying the ground work to say trump is picking on Joe. All in an attempt to make it seem acceptable for a presidential candidate to have those kinds of issues.
One last thought...have you asked yourself why Trump fired Flynn for "lying to Pence?" I believe it was because that pill was easier for them to swallow than having to explain why they had Flynn talking to Russia about sanctions. Flynn was their fall guy.
Oh, and I have no doubt Trump and Barr will find a way to "free" him... they are way more corrupt than Flynn. My solace is how badly Trump is doing in polls right now, so no tears here.
I don't think anyone bringing up Benghazi in connection to Susan Rice voted for Hillary. Or even for Jill Stein. (They're more likely to bring up "Obama's war crimes.") They voted for Trump.

In practical terms, Trump cannot delay the election.  The states have been preparing for this election for years.  I doubt that secretaries of state in red states would risk trying a date change.  The third of November will come and there will be an election.

Herman Cain attended Trump rallies in Keystone, SD &amp; recently in Tulsa, OK w/o a face mask. Today news filtered he died battling coronavirus w an underlying condition that is colon cancer. Cain had no other than himself to blame. No sympathy.
I‚Äôm glad you know buddy. Maybe you forgot about the Republican Party, stripping the voting rights act? Or how the party supports over policing in minority neighborhoods? It took ya boy Kanye to get trump to give a fuck about mass incarceration. And shit still hasn‚Äôt changed

NYT Politics (3 months from now): President Trump has cancelled/postponed the election with executive authority. Here's  how.
Donald Trump should resign. pass it on.
Ruth Ben Ghiat points out that the strongman needs people to die for him to show his power. I think Cain a fool, but those who thrill to strongmen think his death confirms Trump's power. He is a sacrifice to patriarchal whiteness. #HermanCain
Ruth Ben Ghiat points out that the strongman needs people to die for him to show his power. We think Cain the fool, but for those who thrill to strongmen, his death confirms Trump's power. Trump rolls in the blood of the sacrifice to patriarchal whiteness, and some love it.
Trump has killed Herman Cain.  #TrumpVirus
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
I'm so sick of him....  Trump suggests delaying 2020 US presidential election due to concerns over mail-in voting fraud
Naw Herman Cain went signed a waiver and smiled to show he loved trump more than he trusted doctors so no Herman Cain killed hisself
He‚Äôs not president anymore I‚Äôm right Trump is president which I hate him he‚Äôs the best president of America golden ages
How about we ignore trump and his ideations of fantasy? Quit normalizing this bullsh!t!
Yup. I'd be a suburban Trump voter worrying about property values with a Ring doorbell to keep an eye out for suspicious people in the neighborhood. Maybe we need a support group for academics who rejected their conservative family trajectories?

Hermain Cain would still be alive if Trump wasn't so goddamn petty.
Trump is mental. all i have to say
Trump is working with Russia end of story to hell with our allies he don't give 2 shit about Germany..
This buffoon trump tweeted about delaying the election (something that would NEVER happen) 30 minutes before the worst economic numbers in American HISTORY were announced lmfao what a fucking lunatic
King trump proudly promoted segregation just yesterday. Where‚Äôs the outrage?
Shitten me. trump just gave em a loan.
Simply put: Trump's instincts for investing were horrible.  His instinct for trashy TV: pretty good.  His instinct for appealing to a marginalized demographic, lucky and barely sufficient.  His instinct for governing?  Non-existent.
Trump wants to postpone the election because he let the GDP drop almost 10% in one quarter and he knows even the most egregious of his supporters won‚Äôt stand for that
Your avi is trump, this convo is already over ignorant
idk that "sad" is the right term considering he attended Trump's Tulsa rally without a mask...
Cain's death was announced Thursday on his website by Dan Calabrese. Cain had attended Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis.#TrumpKilledCain #FailedPresident #FailedLeadership
remember when cersei started to lose it because she was scared her kingdom was going to be taken from her?  that‚Äôs the stage donald trump is at right now
The death of Herman Cain should be a wake up call to everyone to wear a mask and practice social distancing. If Trump didn‚Äôt hold that rally in Tulsa last month, I believe Herman Cain would still be alive today. #RIPHermanCain
Suddenly Trump will swing from opening the economy to shutting everything (even the election). #OpenVoting
indirectly??? INDIRECTLY?!?! Trump might as well have murdered Herman Cain with his own hand.
I want to know what excuse Trump will devise so that he can be absent from Cain's funeral.  He was a prominent Black supporter of Trump ... which was part of the problem.
I'm not saying it's likely. I just think that brushing off Trump &amp; co.'s comments is very blase. We wouldn't brush it off if a foreign leader made similar comments just b/c their constitution said otherwise. That's how democratic backsliding happens.
So Roberts leads the majority ordering the election to occur per the Constitution, and Trump and Barr give him the middle finger, and we have a Constitutional crisis. All we have to enforce SCOTUS decisions are norms. And Trump gives less than zero fucks about norms.
People laugh when I say it, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind a nice, temporary military coup to clean some house and arrest Trump Administration officials while administering a free and fair election in the fall.
I mean, we all know what Constitution says, but is that really going to stop Barr from coming up w/ some tortured logic by which they can delay the election? Would SCOTUS stop them if he did? If SCOTUS stopped them &amp; Trump &amp; Barr say "fuck SCOTUS" who is stopping them?
Nope! JUST GOT word..he didn't make IT..unfortunately he died another ONE PASSED listening to tRUMP üíîüö®üöëüò∞üåèüá∫üá∏

Sorry for any human life lost. But this Herman guy thought covid-19 was a joke and was trolling people at the Tulsa Trump rally.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

Make sure you have your BaBa filled up with warm milk and your little blanky. Trump will continue to make America great.
Everyone sees what‚Äôs going on no matter what the media tries to portray. All they are doing is destroying cities and embarrassing themselves and the elected Democrats charged to protect citizens is in support of this behavior. Undeserving of America. God bless America. Trump 2020
Please don't come to NJ - we already have enough of your "citizens" packing our most densely populated state now. If you do, Pres Trump supporters only please.
Relocation program for the Police, pull the Feds and literally let the city burn. Oh, by the way, Pres Trump should not respond even when the Mayor begs (which will happen).
House passes bill repealing all of Trump's travel bans and preventing future presidents from enacting similar bans
they're letting these a holes show how they are ruining this country.   Then Trump wins again.
Another great decision by Pres Trump to not spend time "honoring" a man who called him nasty names and really was a hater. Not a nice man at all.

True, but some privately want geronticide. It clears the rolls of Social Security and Medicare  claimants. In this case, largely of people who weren't voting for Trump (or live in Electoral College states he couldn't win), so he doesn't care about them, politically.

It's such a relief to read that Trump won't attend. We should exclude him from our daily living. For our well-being.

In addition to a raging pandemic, denial of science, a tanking economy, &amp; creeping fascism, the Trump administration is now also responsible for making me hear my Dad say the words "demon sperm" and for that, I will do everything in my power to make sure they are all unemployed.
Actually if you did your research, Trump banned epstein from all his properties and cut all relationships after the first accusations
#Trump is proposing that the election be delayed. There should be no doubt about his desire to overthrow the Constitution and establish a dictatorship.  are mounting no meaningful opposition to this incipient coup. The opposition must come from the working class.
Don't think people appreciate how Trump essentially showed them their base likes to be wicked. They'll pander to that for a generation. It's about power.
Trump was like this (selfish rich kid bully) as a kid thru to this day. He was raised by an angry dad who only cared about business and was morally unscrupulous ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èthere are some who teach others to ‚Äúcheat lie and steal‚Äù, I‚Äôve known such mentors firsthand. Trump is product of that

Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have the power to postpone an election and the #20thAmendment removes both him and Pence at noon on Jan. 20 regardless of whether or not an election happened. Glad I cleared this up for you.

Yup. I'd be a suburban Trump voter worrying about property values with a Ring doorbell to keep an eye out for suspicious people in the neighborhood. Maybe we need a support group for academics who rejected their conservative family trajectories?
Now all of these same Fox ppl who said Biden was trying to scare ppl with this ‚Äúinsane idea‚Äù of delaying the election will be the lead supporters of this insane idea of delaying the election because their dear leader trump said so and as cultists they have no choice but to follow
Trump, Barr and Pompeo are literally all saying the same thing. He will claim the election is fixed and will not leave the Whkte House
Wow even bush can speak clear full sentences. Donald trump literally cannot get through a single sentence without some irrelevant tangent remark.

I feel the discussion on whether Trump CAN move the election is irrelevant since he clearly cannot unilaterally. Instead, we should pay attention to how his rhetoric will sow doubt in the process and amplify claims of illegitimacy as Election Day approaches.
But what was it like to party at the Trump WH with all your conservative frens? Surely the real problem here is THE LEFT

does trump get charged with murder for killing  or did he sign the death waiver?
I‚Äôm sure  family will love to go along with that new line of messaging, so they can protect the trump admin‚Äôs ignorant stupidity, by using their dead family member‚Äôs name and reputation? I truly hope they are better than that.
He got it at the Trump rally. Its a tremendously bad news day for Trump. Lets all just be honest..
indirectly??? INDIRECTLY?!?! Trump might as well have murdered Herman Cain with his own hand.
Kanye West's Bid For President Might Stall After Donald Trump Demands Election Delay: "2020 Will Be The Most Inaccurate + Fraudulent Election In History"
I'm not saying it's likely. I just think that brushing off Trump &amp; co.'s comments is very blase. We wouldn't brush it off if a foreign leader made similar comments just b/c their constitution said otherwise. That's how democratic backsliding happens.
So Roberts leads the majority ordering the election to occur per the Constitution, and Trump and Barr give him the middle finger, and we have a Constitutional crisis. All we have to enforce SCOTUS decisions are norms. And Trump gives less than zero fucks about norms.
King. He got it a the trump rally!!!
Do you think Trump even cares in the slightest that Herman Cain died because of him?
I mean, we all know what Constitution says, but is that really going to stop Barr from coming up w/ some tortured logic by which they can delay the election? Would SCOTUS stop them if he did? If SCOTUS stopped them &amp; Trump &amp; Barr say "fuck SCOTUS" who is stopping them?

Trump's election tweet is not 3D chess. Distracting from one piece of bad news with a flurry of stories about Trump being a dictator does not help him. None of this does. The more he acts like a crazy person, the worse his numbers get. It's all bad. He's an idiot.

Sorry for any human life lost. But this Herman guy thought covid-19 was a joke and was trolling people at the Tulsa Trump rally.
Herman Cain died to attend a Trump rally in which Trump ranted about how a ramp at West Point was slippery and that's why he needed help to go down it, and proved he's so strong and healthy because he could take a sip of water.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Donald Trump will eventually pass away
He could have skipped the Trump rally. He did this to himself. Just sayin'.

Or, it's both true that Trump didn't want folks talking about the economic collapse he caused AND that he is planning to undermine the election and its aftermath, and the latter is the greater emergency.
I think God not feeling us right now, maybe it was separating families &amp; placing children in cages, or probably thinking trump was the 2nd coming. So now we have a plague with over 151,000 dead, over 4.5 million infected and over 30 million unemployed Americans.

Once again, Biden didnt get it. He made fun of consent just days after his tepid apology. I even posted an article for you. Anyone who is accused by 8 women and then jokes about consent days after is not fit to be our nominee. I'd expect that from Trump, not a Dem.

Donald J. Trump defends Putin, raped children with Epstein, raped women, kills Americans with negligence, gets impeached for treason, cheats on his wives with porn stars and hookers, and this who the GOP chooses as their moral and political leader.
With over 151,000 people in the US dead from COVID-19, the US GDP down 9.5%, and a plummeting approval rating, Trump on Thursday continued to push wildly misleading claims about mail-in voting as part of a larger, clear effort to undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 election.
When in the movie did they refer to him as a child of two worlds? And, the only reason they wanted him to leave was out of fear of Zod and company trashing the earth. And, only through Lex's machinations, did they hate him. The US government didn't help. Imagine Trump's reaction.
It's too late for anyone in the Federalist Society to salvage any sort of face. Trump is a Frankenstein's monster that took conservatives decades to make. He's a product of everything wrong with America, and those who supported him should just quit politics. Their sum is fascism.

Violating the law is not exactly a problem for Trump.
Herman Cain died for a movement that deep down hates people like him. It makes me sad that he has died even though I wasn't a fan. And unless Trump or Ivanka get sick the "President" will not give a single, McDonalds-laced shit about this.

you called it. It had to be bad if they were ignoring him. I hope some people take it more seriously after this, but knowing Trump's base they probably won't care until it is one of their white heroes
Trump knows he has little to no shot of winning and now he‚Äôs proposing postponing the election that will oust him from office.   If it was too early to call him a Authoritarian leader (it wasn‚Äôt) now would be the perfect time.   We‚Äôre living in dangerous times for America.

Trump saying we should delay the 2020 election is obv just to distract from his handling of the economy/coronavirus. But we'll spend days listening to very serious people tell us that "he can't do it without approval, so nbd" as if the mere suggestion itself is not dangerous.

So to be perfectly clear, Joe Biden is quoted saying the following about Trump‚Äôs despicable act of brute force against peaceful protestors and Breitbart deems it necessary to fact check only that the Bible was right side up? Got it.
To anyone who understands the threat that is Donald Trump: We have to hold it together for 97 days. Do not buy into any bs or division, stay united in this one goal. When we elect Biden we will make history for this united front; a bipartisan effort to secure the democracy.
My $0.02: If there are a bunch of Trump voters lying to pollsters, are they lying about Senate and House races too? No shame for a conservative to say he's voting for Ernst in IA. Ernst would be cruising to reelection while Trump/Biden are within 1%, but she's not.
Yea, He‚Äôs a world leader, he can‚Äôt just shit on other world leaders. This is also why he says nice things about the Fat Kid too.  Notice how Canada was absent from the last USMCA trade meeting? Maybe Trudeau shouldn‚Äôt have shat on Trump

Wonder if I'll get suspended. Hydroxychloroquine works! There's no if ands or buts about it.  President Trump should have come out against it, and then the left would have been for it, and perhaps more lives would have been saved.

Well part of Trump's vision was to drain the swamp. There's swamp everywhere in the DOJ, white, black, Asian, Hispanic. Again it's not the color it's the character.  Bar got there in February of 19. How's he supposed to restructure to make sure there's enough blacks? Non-sequitur
The only thing that scares me is that they're desperate enough to try the big A word that I won't mention here. That's the only way he won't be reelected.  The same right back at you - I like you too, but understand there's 54 months more of Trump administration.

You‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm sure he locked himself in his house and went absolutely nowhere between the rally and his diagnosis, so obviously the rally is the only place he could‚Äôve possibly caught it. üôÑüôÑüôÑYour Trump hate has rendered you unable to use logic.
Hearing Obama‚Äôs moving eulogy for John Lewis and thinking about how millions of Americans, including some I know and love, hate this man and never recognized his legitimacy as president, yet have embraced Trump.
At no point during this crisis has Donald Trump shown a genuine concern for the health and safety of Americans.   He‚Äôs either trying to delegitimize the election with false claims of fraud or fundamentally believes he can remain in power like the authoritarian leaders he admires.

Trump does wish her well.
Umm...there‚Äôs a very high chance that‚Äôs where he got it.  He tested positive soon after and was in the hospital for a month before he died.  It was his choice to go to the rally, so not on Trump, but the lack of masks contributed to a major spike in OK at that time.
Nobody was talking about trump #RentFree

Curiously, still no word from Donald Trump and Brad Parscale.
Not only can liberals not imagine a much better world. They can't imagine a much worse world. Even if they succeed at electing Biden, Trump can escalate far right terrorism just by claiming the election was rigged. Libs won't prep for that bc they can't imagine it's possible.
No, Ana Navarro made it political and people are now responding. Herman Cain already had preexisting conditions. I‚Äôm DISGUSTED at how many people are blaming Trump for this!!

Cain tweeted this about Trump‚Äôs Mount Rushmore rally on the very same day that he was rushed to the hospital. Cain caused his own death by blindly following his cult leader. A warning to other Americans who are putting their lives in danger just to support Trump. #WearAMasküò∑
I‚Äôll say what you won‚Äôt. Cain‚Äôs death is because of Trump.  He attended his rally, a super spreader event, and now he‚Äôs dead. Period.

NYT Politics (3 months from now): President Trump has cancelled/postponed the election with executive authority. Here's  how.
Donald Trump should resign. pass it on.
Trump can fool his followers into believing that he can stay in office after he loses; then give him something in return (immunity from federal prosecution for his crimes) in exchange for leaving office peacefully. He‚Äôs hoping that after this nightmare, you‚Äôre so worn out.
Ruth Ben Ghiat points out that the strongman needs people to die for him to show his power. I think Cain a fool, but those who thrill to strongmen think his death confirms Trump's power. He is a sacrifice to patriarchal whiteness. #HermanCain
The President of the United States can‚Äôt move the election; the Constitution gives that power solely to Congress, and we all know Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn‚Äôt going to postpone or cancel the election. Trump, you playin yourself
Excellent point. Also a good point that Trump was neither invited nor attended the funerals of George Bush, Barbara Bush, John McCain, Elijah Cummings or virtually any person of national stature in the 3+ years he has served as president.
Trump can no more postpone the election than I can flap my arms and turn into a birdm. No matter how loudly he might hint, and no matter how many or few pundits decide to try to milk such a narrative for ratings, it‚Äôs still not a real thing. So why is he even talking about it?
Ruth Ben Ghiat points out that the strongman needs people to die for him to show his power. We think Cain the fool, but for those who thrill to strongmen, his death confirms Trump's power. Trump rolls in the blood of the sacrifice to patriarchal whiteness, and some love it.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
The Left is saying the same things about Trump and his 5-word genius test, his shuffling gait, miraculous water drinking skills, and his taking pandemic medical cues from the ‚Äúdemon sex-alien DNA‚Äù doctor. #TrumpFallsApart

Naw Herman Cain went signed a waiver and smiled to show he loved trump more than he trusted doctors so no Herman Cain killed hisself
Yup. I'd be a suburban Trump voter worrying about property values with a Ring doorbell to keep an eye out for suspicious people in the neighborhood. Maybe we need a support group for academics who rejected their conservative family trajectories?

trump killed Herman Cain
We can't let Trump turn on the lag switch !
So Trump's Oklahoma rally - a racist white man causes the death of a successful Black businessman, Herman Cain, in Tulsa.  I guess we have the first episode of season 2 of Watchmen.
I know the Knicks are more popular and don‚Äôt care. I want to win games. So Please stop with it. I don‚Äôt care and it‚Äôs really annoying.

Shitten me. trump just gave em a loan.
Violating the law is not exactly a problem for Trump.
Herman Cain died for a movement that deep down hates people like him. It makes me sad that he has died even though I wasn't a fan. And unless Trump or Ivanka get sick the "President" will not give a single, McDonalds-laced shit about this.
Trump wants to postpone the election because he let the GDP drop almost 10% in one quarter and he knows even the most egregious of his supporters won‚Äôt stand for that
Your avi is trump, this convo is already over ignorant
Lol. Good analogy. Perhaps Trump is like King Joffrey. And Biden represents the hope and promise of Rob Stark.
Cain's death was announced Thursday on his website by Dan Calabrese. Cain had attended Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis.#TrumpKilledCain #FailedPresident #FailedLeadership
you called it. It had to be bad if they were ignoring him. I hope some people take it more seriously after this, but knowing Trump's base they probably won't care until it is one of their white heroes
Suddenly Trump will swing from opening the economy to shutting everything (even the election). #OpenVoting
indirectly??? INDIRECTLY?!?! Trump might as well have murdered Herman Cain with his own hand.
Your idol Trump has been a slow-motion disaster for four years.
Man this trump shit is too much I can‚Äôt keep up anymore
I'm not saying it's likely. I just think that brushing off Trump &amp; co.'s comments is very blase. We wouldn't brush it off if a foreign leader made similar comments just b/c their constitution said otherwise. That's how democratic backsliding happens.
So Roberts leads the majority ordering the election to occur per the Constitution, and Trump and Barr give him the middle finger, and we have a Constitutional crisis. All we have to enforce SCOTUS decisions are norms. And Trump gives less than zero fucks about norms.
If tRump knows how to fix America, how come he hasn't done it?
The last couple of weeks, I think they have shown themselves to be almost as bad as Trump but without the backlash. Today is showing how disgusting they truly are
People laugh when I say it, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind a nice, temporary military coup to clean some house and arrest Trump Administration officials while administering a free and fair election in the fall.
I mean, we all know what Constitution says, but is that really going to stop Barr from coming up w/ some tortured logic by which they can delay the election? Would SCOTUS stop them if he did? If SCOTUS stopped them &amp; Trump &amp; Barr say "fuck SCOTUS" who is stopping them?
Nope! JUST GOT word..he didn't make IT..unfortunately he died another ONE PASSED listening to tRUMP üíîüö®üöëüò∞üåèüá∫üá∏

President Trump says he did not discuss Russian bounties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
what the democrats are doing today was planned to be in the last 4 years of the Clinton presidency,,Trump ruined that plan so they had to come out early
Pretty laughable compared to the nearly years worth of days Trump has gone golfing at his resorts costing tax payers travel expenses for his entourage that got paid to his properties which go into his pocket. Biggest dupe on American tax payers in the history of the country.
To suggest that Trump is practicing "the Art of War" or has even read Sun Tsu is laughable. He is simply trying to disrupt public trust in the election.
Trump wants one too. Que up the all night tweeting.
So, Trump delaying the election is not the worry. He's trying to delegitimize it so he can ignore the result. If he does, what are the options?  He has shown a willingness to ignore the judiciary. There has to be a plan beyond using the courts...
The one and only reason trump wants to delay the election is to stay out of jail, period.
I want every person in Congress on record about this. Every, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tread on me.‚Äù Every, ‚Äúwearing a mask infringes on my rights.‚Äù Because if you say that or are an elected official and you condone delaying a presidential election, you stand for nothing.

Spoiler: the new plan is the same as the old plan: wait for Trump to do something and then tweet about how it's awful.  You led Andrew's campaign with a focus on his policies and Andrew led a positive campaign. It felt great, and right, to be a part of it.

The term theoretically ends Jan 20; God likes big endings so you never know.  There may be a Trump plague to go with the Trump pandemic!
I agree no one needs to be shamed for the way they think so re-read your response to my tweet.  You called me a mellow dramatic democrat and criticized my response regarding Trump golfing with Farve.
I get that with calls for defund the police and people fearing race riots, and those Trump TV ads, a black female with that kind of history is an enticing pick.  Idk. When Biden said he was only going to look at females for VP, I tuned out...
The Trump camp likes to talk about how enthusiastic his voters are.  That is fine, but my dog is enthusiastic about me coming home.  That doesn‚Äôt make the most popular person in the house.
Ok awesome!! When he said ‚Äúin the coming days‚Äù at the end of the clip all I could think is this is the Trump administration and it could mean coming weeks.  Thanks for the good news!

Your right I fear it will become political and I‚Äôm so scared what Trump will do to us in the US.
When Trump says he won‚Äôt mandate masks because it imposes on people‚Äôs freedoms, what about the freedoms of people who wear them?  We aren‚Äôt free to travel out of the country. We don‚Äôt feel safe to travel to states without a mask mandate, so why do are freedoms not matter?
it's funny that Trump supporters will tell you that Trump has done so much for this country but when you ask them to name one particular thing that he's done they can never give any examples.
This is the worst medical disaster of our lifetime.  You think Trump  cares about you right? So what has he done to protect you from the virus? What‚Äôs his plan to keep you safe? I‚Äôll give you a hint there isn‚Äôt one.

Ask yourself this and let it sink in.  If Donald Trump wasn‚Äôt afraid of the virus why does he constantly get a test every day and have everyone around him take a test.  Wanna know why.. he‚Äôs afraid of it!
You and me both.  Some woman told me I have hate and I need to pray for Trump.  I responded with I do pray every single day that he‚Äôll come up with a national strategy to fight this virus!
I have no hate.  I pray for Trump EVERY night that he will do the right thing and develop a National stategy for the virus.  Over a 1000 people a day are dying.  Golfing in my opinion is disrespectful.  He‚Äôs protected from the virus.  If we were we could do whatever we wanted too
What gets me is we all have the right to freedom of speech and just because someone may not agree with it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be vulgar.  My dad is 89 and likes Trump.  I‚Äôd rather be drug under an 18 wheeler than vote for him.  But I don‚Äôt hate my dad because I don‚Äôt agree.
It‚Äôs nice how Trump is still living his best life.  Golfing how many times a week, doing whatever he wants.  He‚Äôs also protected from the virus while the rest of us live in fear, haven‚Äôt seen family in months and he could care less.

Enough with it. We get it, you love Trump.
Here's a thought: If there's no election of Pres by noon, Jan. 20, Trump's term in office ends, per Article 2 &amp; per 20th Amend. He doesn't just remain till he's replaced.  W/no elected leaders, NANCY PELOSI, Speaker of House becomes 'acting President' till matter is resolved.
Wow, such verbal compassion for a deceased fellow republican and long-time Trump ally. #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
The only reason   or  are not bailing out the  is because they benefit from a Trump admin.End of.

No, he didn't NOT act immediately. He dithered for months and spiked a coordinated national plan. In the meantime, the virus came to us not from China but from Europe. Trump is both incompetent and corrupt. He is responsible, too, for Herman Cain's death. To hell with him--soon.

Trump is not going to stop elections. An election will take place ok, you guys are crazy if you think trump will turn America into a dictatorship or monarch where he will stay president as long as he lives. That's not going to happen, this is fear mongering
Trump 2020
I want every person in Congress on record about this. Every, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tread on me.‚Äù Every, ‚Äúwearing a mask infringes on my rights.‚Äù Because if you say that or are an elected official and you condone delaying a presidential election, you stand for nothing.
You know Jeff is voting for Trump, if Trump loses, what else would he do with his pathetic life??
it‚Äôs far too early to squander our hardworking earning tax dollars to promote  2024Presidential Election. #Trump Clean Up Corruption
Trump do not have the authority to change the election date.
People do not worry about this. Donald Trump do not have the authority to change the election date. Just vote!!
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
Trump closed the businesses? I didn‚Äôt think he had that power. I thought the governors did. Silly me.
On July 24, President Trump signed four executive orders focused on lowering RX prices. To learn more about these orders and their potential impact please read the full alert here:

Ebro this is goin back to what you were saying on the radio earlier this am.. in regards to Trump dismantling the Obama bill for low income housing in suburbs... after all that ish that you were talking about .. u can‚Äôt seclude yourself. And white ppl worrying about their taxes
Let‚Äôs be real here. This thing isn‚Äôt going away. Even when there is a vaccine, do we know if it will offer life long immunity? The only way to protect your kid is at home learning. But what if you have to work? I don‚Äôt think Fauci is bending to Trump. He‚Äôs just being honest.
Absolutely. Conservatives speech should not be suppressed. Thank you President Trump. We need our time reclaimed. 8 more years!
Here: branding things ‚ÄúCultural Marxism‚Äù was a big proto Alt-Right thing from the 2000s, pushed along with anti-semitic conspiracy theories, and it‚Äôs gone mainstream with Trump
No one has mastered the chess moves better than Pres Trump. Always so many moves ahead.
I‚Äôm glad my little three letter word I used bothered you so much that you chose to focus on that and ignore everything else. Typical trump supporter. Anyways reasoning with you people is useless. #BLM have a good day
I respect your father and his memory but were you outraged when Trump said John McCain wasn‚Äôt a hero because he liked people who weren‚Äôt captured.. because if you support Trump then don‚Äôt be outraged when someone says something similar about your father
The main reason why HCQ is "questioned" - Pres Trump took it! Can't have this President back a drug that actually works? Yes, that's what the Lame Street Media is shoving down America's throat, not the drug that works, just the lies as usual.
Trump trying to buy live from battleground states. So if you aren't a battleground state your money is likely going to Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio
Are you from Seattle? Are you an American? Did you follow the story before Trump began talking about it? How many of the violent ones are imported White Nationalists, who have made mischief in other city's protests?
With the infiltration of Paul Ryan and other Pres Trump haters, this will be only the start to undermine the election. Be prepared to be really pissed as the weeks go on!
Trump is the weakest &amp; the ENTIRE WORLD KNOWS. In short, WE ARE SCREWED!
The thing about testing....everyone gets tested around trump. So he feels safe.  If HE doesnt think testing is necessary, then why are they testing. Let HIM GO WITHOUT instead of people who truly need &amp; want it.

Like it or not, the USA has a binary system. A vote for anyone but Biden (or not voting and failing to do your civic duty) is a vote for Trump. It's like FDR said to Progressives when president, "Now, your job is to MAKE me have to put those policies thru. First win the office.
So you're going to put the incompetent wannabe dictator back in office? Because like it or not, the USA has a binary political system and a vote for anyone but Biden (or not voting at all and failing your civic duty) is a vote for Trump.
Yesterday, Trump launched a cruel &amp; cynical attack on immigrant youth &amp; announced plans to dismantle DACA, threatening the lives of tens of thousands of NJ residents.   We cannot continue to wait for the fed gov to do the right thing.   NJ must step up.  #OccupationalLicenses4All

'The Republican Party deserves banishment not for its bad ideas (although there are a boatload of those) but because it failed a fundamental test of character and citizenship.'
#Trump received #RussianBounty intelligence in his daily briefings numberous times! Yet, he willfully ignored it! I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs treason! #Republicans this will become your #benghazi
#Trump meet discussed Russian bounties with Putin! Isnt this treasonous?!
What are the Democrats are trying to indict him because there been in some crimes they don't want to get caught in so a lot of you thinking Trump the bad guy better wake up because America will be owned by China if you let a Democrat get in office
I doubt Trump himself knows or cares about these policies (he's more in the faux-rich societal stratum), but someone is probably giving him good (if late) advice on how to try to turn things around.
My guess is that Trump is trying a tactic (possibly an effective one, although not likely effective enough) of finding existing long-term policies that (should?) anger his base and flipping them with EOs, to give him a list of things that will change back if he gets the boot.
Trump would start crying as soon as he threw the doll a punch. Haven't you heard him speak? He's a baby
We might wonder if poor people end up in housing in a suburb, will they need cars they can't afford to get around? Are all the markets priced out of their income? Instead, Trump is saying "if you're bothered by the existence of the poor, or real estate prices, here you go"
#MorallyCorrupt: "How do you abandon deeply held beliefs about character, personal responsibility, foreign policy and the national debt in a matter of months? You don‚Äôt. The obvious answer is those beliefs weren‚Äôt deeply held."
Of course is for Putin‚Äôs sake. Putin was upset trump is moving too slowly in destroying NATO  and the fascist Republicans do nothing about it.
Tons of respect for you.  President Trump 2020
Resign your days are over .Florida doesn't want you either as they are dying there too.Mary L Trump was right about you.

It wasnt "court" it was a congressional oversight hearing. And Barr is absolutely serving trump personally. He cldnt even give a definitive answer about foreign interference in our elections. When he did speak, it was lies, evasive &amp; dodging.  He  should be impeached. PERIOD
mr trump do you stan nico hischier??
President Trump 2020
Which will also show the market at a good number. The market has ZERO to do with economy. It's just a smoke screen.   did you really work on this with trump???????? I would be crushed
Other day trump said he doesn't discuss what's said on Putin calls. Now he can say what convo was about. I think one of us to interview trump. I know for a fact that some of you out there will make trump explode with rage lol
He needs to be removed. I knew he was going to be a problem when Trump appointed him, but he's turning out to be far more dangerous to our democracy than even I anticipated.
Why tweet it out unless you believe it.... total BS sorry  By turning it into a tweet with photos they are sending a message of love for trump.
Trump is a fascist racist with an ideology of hate divisiveness and fear. He is culpable for 150,000 deaths due to covid 19 .He knew in Dec did nothing till MARCH 26th.
Wrong.
Wrong.
You all are so pathetic.
Time to hold you accountable as you know that Trump knew about covid 19 in December and did nothing till MARCH 26th. 150,000 deaths today.
They endorsed Trump!!!!

Lukashenko of Belarus is three months late on the COVID-19 vodka cure. The Trump Organization publicized it in April.  No telling if  caught it yet.
This coward could protect his wife from Trump's insults but he definitely peddles the Trump's uniform medical crap .150,000 deaths today. TRUMP is culpable. He knew in December nd did nothing.
my coworker a big trump supporter who a Hispanic men from Argentina. like I say hi to him but I ain‚Äôt for all that bull shit politic talk.
Well who in power in the AMA is a Trump supporter? Who is afraid of being demonized like Fauci?  Orgs like humans tend to be self preserving.
'Many of us in the party saw this dark side and told ourselves it was a recessive gene.'
Today we have 150,000 deaths due to covid and Trump hasn't expressed sympathy for their loss .But he wishes well  to Epstein and G MAXWELL. Both pedophiles. He continues to make America great.
Trump is a fascist with an ideology of hate divisiveness and fear. He is culpable for 150,000 deaths due to covid because he knew in December and did nothing till MARCH 26th.
Can't we get  to follow Trump around asking  questions since that causes him to flee? Keep going until he is out of the country!
This election will have every type of fraud possible. How can this be prevented  TIME IS RUNNING OUT. We need President Trump reelected fairly.
How did we end up with either this or Trump?
No. The Fact is, President Trump, Voted by absentee ballot (not the same as "vote by mail") and you are welcome to use that same system, from your basement, as are all who "don't feel safe." All other Americans should vote by means already established in our states.
Once again - WRONG!!!
"Reclaiming My Time" should be Pres Trump's claim to get his 4 yrs added onto 2024.
They are LITERALLY trying to remove anything remotely positive to help Pres Trump. Anyone surprised? Hate to tell you, it's all part of the Left plan to fool Americans into thinking their way is the only way.
Always whining  As of today there are 150,000 deaths due to covid 19 .and the Drumph aka Trump children continue to whine.
Trump has a #witchdoctor.
It's great if you're in a group or surrounded by Pres Trump supporters, but totally alone is almost inviting the lunatics that will physically harm you. My wife and I don't have a lot and can't afford for repercussions. I envy you!
Trump has invested in the company.
Trump was briefed about the Coronavirus global pandemic in December and he did nothing till MARCH. As of today we have 150,000 deaths and he express support to pedophiles bht not 150,000 thousands deaths due to covid 19.
and many others......great job today. Barr is a tremendous supporter of trump &amp; not for the rule of law. He should be impeached
Trump also supports pedophiles Epstein and his girlfriend G MAXWELL  BUT he express no sympathy for 150,000 Americans dead as of today
Trump is basically a fascist with an ideology of hate divisiveness and fear  and he basically supports pedophiles and is culpable for 150,000 deaths due to covid.
Its a frightening book.But basically Trump supports pedophiles but not the 150,000 deaths due to covid 19 Thats definitely White privileged.
The election of Donald Trump is the worst thing thats happened to this Country since Hitler  As of today 150,000 deaths and he sends well wishes to pedophiles
He must be a trump supporter.
Totally agree Trump supports pedophiles but not the 150,000 people  who died due to covid 19.No we are not going to let false information take over. How low will you go to protect Trump?
Hopefully Trump
Trump defending the rule of law? He should check himself in prison üòé stop the propaganda Jim!
Too many Americans are livid at Senate Republicans and Donald Trump over handling of coronavirus relief efforts and all the mentally abusive comments coming from Senate Republicans during this American but global crisis &amp; pandemic...
please PLEASE let him flip on trump
What if there is (also) massive voter fraud? And I mean VOTER FRAUD. Trump projects his crimes onto others. What if there is real evidence of voter fraud and no one can deny it‚Äînor can anyone directly tie it to Trump. Regardless who wins, it could lead to similar chaos.

Such beautiful words from such a beautiful man.  Donald Trump isn‚Äôt worthy of carrying his shoes.
Yes, they do.  ALL LIVES, not just a chosen few.
He went on record saying a lot of things. We know at the end of the day he will do as Trump says. I sure as hell don‚Äôt believe a single word he says.
I find myself randomly remembering Trump was actually IMPEACHED...the I find myself confused as hell ab our democracy that someone can literally be impeached and run for a second term.   I regret missing meals and work sitting in front if the TV for hours waiting for that verdict

Hey.... traitorous  broadcasted President Barack Obama entire eulogy speech at John Lewis funeral.  Can you belive that? Barr should investigate them immediately, and send some trump troops to their headquarters.

Republicans call those traitors heroes, Trump calls confederate traitors heroes. Ever since trump has taken over, I can‚Äôt even recognize my Republican Party
This man was murdered. Regardless if he was a Trump supporter, HIS life mattered. Period! It shouldn't be an issue of Right/ Left. At this critical time in America it should be, "We Are All in This Together. " Our survival depends on it. #CountryOverParty
Nunes getting dirt on Biden from a pro-Russian Ukrainian.   Sounds extremely disturbing.   Is anyone going to investigate Trump sycophant Nunes?  Or does the creep get a free pass?
Geez! üôÑ
Am I the only one that thinks Trump just flew somewhere to replace Herman Cain as his 'black' friend?
Indeed! üòâ
Herman Cain was a father, a grandfather, a brother a husband.  I know your hatred of Trump has made you as delusional as the liberal socialist you work with.  Still, a little respect would have been a sign of decency, sadly you've lost that too.
216 miles built since Trump took office replaced outdated or dilapidated fencing. Only about ‚Äú3 miles of new border wall system constructed in locations where no barriers previously existed,‚Äù according to Homeland Security.
Why the Media send to the White House pool the stupidest, least prepared to confront Trump's lies and fake news? With a very few exceptions, I must say. They are so visibly shaking about their jobs security I feel sorry for them. Where is Helen when we need her?
The euphoria is because some republicans now being forced to take the virus seriously now, actually seeing that its not a Dem hoax. He openly opposed wearing masks and social distancing. Now the deniers can open their eyes, and a stretch, but maybe trump can promote good science
True, but some privately want geronticide. It clears the rolls of Social Security and Medicare  claimants. In this case, largely of people who weren't voting for Trump (or live in Electoral College states he couldn't win), so he doesn't care about them, politically.
In fairness, the Republican Party was about suppressing voting rights loooong before Trump became president.
In April, Joe Biden predicted Trump would try and delay election.  You better hide in your bunker.
This feels highly relevant:

Is Trump responsible for Herman Cain‚Äôs death?  Two sides to this argument  Had Trump addressed COVID in March, 1000‚Äôs would have been saved let alone Cain.  Had Cain took some self responsibility and used a mask, social distancing, he would have survived as well.  So..ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Now that these guys got all the judges they wanted, they're fine with impeachment? Now? Sit the f*ck down.
Remember when conservative intellectuals embraced nationalism as a way to defend Trump? They thought Trump cared about "America first," when all he truly cares about is the Fox &amp; Friends weekend hosts saying nice things about him.
He‚Äôs not dumb. He‚Äôs a sociopath just like Trump. Saying he‚Äôs stupid lets him off the hook. These people are murderers.
If you believe there is CONCLUSIVE evidence, all you have to do is sue Trump when his term is finished. No immunity anymore. If you succeed, I will swallow my words.
1. Trump is talking about this because he‚Äôs on track to lose by a mile. But, 2. He‚Äôs not expecting to actually postpone the election. Instead, 3. He hopes to spark talk of impeachment again. Because, 4. He thinks the Republican Senate would fold, and he‚Äôd reset the polls to even.
What‚Äôs Trump going to do about it? Be strong armed by Putin for an exchange, I bet. And I bet that‚Äôs what has been going on in all these recent phone calls. Trump is working with Putin against America! Treason!
My 1st Trump Twitter vid was March 11th after the Jazz game was canceled.   Thank you Rudy Gobert. I've been a Utah Jazz fan for 32 yrs. And by Gobert forcing the world to be bored they discovered my videos 13 days later.  Now I'll lose those fans with #UtahJazz tweets #TakeNote
When the history books about our age of pandemic &amp; protests are written, I hope we also remember these simple gestures of decency and dignity as antidotes to the tyranny &amp; racial terror of Trump.
I blame Trump for his death. That rally should never have happened. Why do Republicans reject the fact that masks save lives?
Important to note Trump destroyed this program so those chances are now gone for many
Trump must be so grateful that in 3.5 years as president he has yet to be asked a really great question by a journalist that would knock him off his game.
Imagine if a journalist asked Trump the perfect GDP question--he'd probably have to resign!

I doubt that trump want to preside over a democratic congress and a democratic senate.
I voted for him twice but now that I know how duplicitous he is I have serious doubts. MSM, FBI, etc were all in on it and I‚Äôm a disgusted Dem. I don‚Äôt like Trump but Biden is out of it. Should I just not vote?
The Klan disavowed the Dems a long time ago. Even endorsed Trump. This honestly just shows how far the republicans have fallen. Pubs have foresaken themselves
I read the whistleblower's complaint and the full transcription of the phone call to find no conclusive evidence Trump asked for assistance in exchange for aid. The impeachment, if held in court, would have been dismissed. Accusing without proof = recklessness.
Look at all of the investors and Trump-brand consumers he reassured!!
It's such a relief to read that Trump won't attend. We should exclude him from our daily living. For our well-being.
This is how warped we are under this presidency: Johnson sent in Feds to protect the rights of citizens against unjust racial bias; Trump sent in Feds to disperse a crowd of citizens protesting unjust racial bias.  Years from now, historians will regard these 2 men the same.
Trump sis trump is more hated than bush
A Trump triple chin. Very rare. I think the tightness of his shirt collar contributes to this but I'm only a layperson.
Here's the cognitive test that Trump really needs to take:  1. What color was George Washington's white horse? 2. Who is buried in Grant's Tomb? 3. In what year did the 1918 flu pandemic occur?

At no point during this crisis has Donald Trump shown a genuine concern for the health and safety of Americans.   He‚Äôs either trying to delegitimize the election with false claims of fraud or fundamentally believes he can remain in power like the authoritarian leaders he admires.

That literally means nothing. Anyone who votes by mail or otherwise needs to register in advance. Why would absentee votes have less cases of fraud than other mail by vote ballots? Makes no sense, you just chirp whatever daddy Trump vomits out of his mouth.

Herman Cain attended Trump rallies in Keystone, SD &amp; recently in Tulsa, OK w/o a face mask. Today news filtered he died battling coronavirus w an underlying condition that is colon cancer. Cain had no other than himself to blame. No sympathy.
I‚Äôm glad you know buddy. Maybe you forgot about the Republican Party, stripping the voting rights act? Or how the party supports over policing in minority neighborhoods? It took ya boy Kanye to get trump to give a fuck about mass incarceration. And shit still hasn‚Äôt changed

Actually if you did your research, Trump banned epstein from all his properties and cut all relationships after the first accusations
#Trump is proposing that the election be delayed. There should be no doubt about his desire to overthrow the Constitution and establish a dictatorship.  are mounting no meaningful opposition to this incipient coup. The opposition must come from the working class.
Don't think people appreciate how Trump essentially showed them their base likes to be wicked. They'll pander to that for a generation. It's about power.
I‚Äôm not at all into politics...  But do I have it right that FOX News has joined CNN in a stance against Trump? So he no longer has even a very right-leaning media company on his side?   I am back to sports as I conclude this tweet.
Excellent point. Also a good point that Trump was neither invited nor attended the funerals of George Bush, Barbara Bush, John McCain, Elijah Cummings or virtually any person of national stature in the 3+ years he has served as president.
Junkies defending the trump administration..  Make it make sense.
Herman essential committed suicide by following the instructions on Donald Trump. John Lewis died of cancer. I don‚Äôt think the circumstances are similar

He‚Äôs not dumb. He‚Äôs a sociopath just like Trump. Saying he‚Äôs stupid lets him off the hook. These people are murderers.
1. Trump is talking about this because he‚Äôs on track to lose by a mile. But, 2. He‚Äôs not expecting to actually postpone the election. Instead, 3. He hopes to spark talk of impeachment again. Because, 4. He thinks the Republican Senate would fold, and he‚Äôd reset the polls to even.

I've thought long&amp;hard abt what to say pertaining to Herman Cains death from #COVID19 my mother always told "If you dont have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all" so all I will say is get out &amp; vote Donald J Trump out  of office our literal lives depend on it!

Contracted after Trump Tulsa rally. SMDH.
Violating the law is not exactly a problem for Trump.
Herman Cain died for a movement that deep down hates people like him. It makes me sad that he has died even though I wasn't a fan. And unless Trump or Ivanka get sick the "President" will not give a single, McDonalds-laced shit about this.
Worst COVID numbers in the entire world.   Trump proposes to postpone the election to avoid a Landslide Loss.  Oh and the economy is tanking.  ARE YOU TIRED OF WINNING YET!?
Cain seemed like  good person until he started sucking up to Satan on earth. Everything tRump touches DIES!!!
Nah. He's black. Trump and his ilk won't sleep over it.

Herman Cain should have worn a mask. Wasn't he at Trump 's rally in Oklahoma?
Trump knows he has little to no shot of winning and now he‚Äôs proposing postponing the election that will oust him from office.   If it was too early to call him a Authoritarian leader (it wasn‚Äôt) now would be the perfect time.   We‚Äôre living in dangerous times for America.

Good morning üåû‚òÄÔ∏èüòÉ here is my wake up call: watch this and tweep:
So to be perfectly clear, Joe Biden is quoted saying the following about Trump‚Äôs despicable act of brute force against peaceful protestors and Breitbart deems it necessary to fact check only that the Bible was right side up? Got it.
To anyone who understands the threat that is Donald Trump: We have to hold it together for 97 days. Do not buy into any bs or division, stay united in this one goal. When we elect Biden we will make history for this united front; a bipartisan effort to secure the democracy.
My $0.02: If there are a bunch of Trump voters lying to pollsters, are they lying about Senate and House races too? No shame for a conservative to say he's voting for Ernst in IA. Ernst would be cruising to reelection while Trump/Biden are within 1%, but she's not.
The Democrats encourage the rioting and protests hoping they will damage Trump politically. They have given a free hand to the crazy left. Big mistake. Pelosi thinks she will be able to control them if democrats win. Dangerous. They will turn on them too and all will lose.
Yea, He‚Äôs a world leader, he can‚Äôt just shit on other world leaders. This is also why he says nice things about the Fat Kid too.  Notice how Canada was absent from the last USMCA trade meeting? Maybe Trudeau shouldn‚Äôt have shat on Trump

Almost ALL of Trump's actions make sense if you view him through the lens of a Russian asset. From decision to criticize NATO starting in the 80's, his dividing the country on race, to his latest efforts to de legitimize our elections. It's the only answer.
So, Portland‚Äôs mayor and governor weren‚Äôt beating up Portland‚Äôs moms so Trump needed to step in and beat the moms up. Got it.

This makes me so mad. Wasn't the post office founded by Benjamin Franklin? It is a remarkable symbol of the can do spirit of the American government. Can't believe this failure of a person, Trump, would destroy it too, one of our oldest institutions.
Quite literally they accepted the results. The president, at least for the short term, is still Trump. I don‚Äôt understand how any rational person tries to equate legally questioning the result versus not guaranteeing the smooth transfer of power.

None of you has a leg to stand on. Accusing someone of being a racist because they recognize Trump as being the racist that he is is classic projection. And that‚Äôs how you people operate. Your leader‚Äôs MO is exactly that. Wake up.
