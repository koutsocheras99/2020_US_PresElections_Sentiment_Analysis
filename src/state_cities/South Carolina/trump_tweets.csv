Help me understand - how is Kanye West running going to help Trump? Are there really Biden voters who would just jump ship to vote for him? Why? Don't people have a reason to vote for someone? If it is just to hurt Biden, why not vote for Trump. One idiot is the same as another.

Republicans = Trump. There is no difference. It is the same evil no matter how you slice it. This goes for all those Republicans voters that aren't a lot different than the "innocent Germans" who didn't know when Hitler came to power. It all has to start somewhere.
Donald J Trump is one of our finest reality Stand Up Comedian. Only problem is Trump is also occupying WH as Potus, a job he is totally unfit for.  Trump's only recourse,  lie his way out of predicament.  Casualty 161,000 dead. An American Virus Tragedy. 🥵😫
By that logic you'd have to agree if I say trump is a racist and bring up some third party website that says he is😂 and if you believe in God...well you'd have to believe it too lol

US officials say Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election; China prefers Trump lose
Trump is throwing out a lot of goodies so he can be touted as the problem solver. The GOP in Congress no doubt knew of this. Desperate act to improve his numbers. Wants people to forget he CAUSED these problems in the first place.

I did hear reports that China doesn’t want to help because they see Trump as a “unpredictable threat”, but Russia just keeps on trying &amp; meddling 🙄
everything you say makes sense, but what you fail to understand is tht Trump has an entire "news" network lying for him and that changes a lot of things.

THAT’S what is irksome, this group think thing that is going on. Because I think Biden would sell his soul to be the president AND I believe in deregulation, somehow I’ve become the biggest Trump supporter ever. It makes no sense.

I agree that no matter who it is, they already have a research team ready to GO, but I just feel it would be a trap because Trump can bring up the same talking points from 2016 + more (Benghazi, 30,000 emails, her son being a Trump supporter, Spygate, etc.)
This may be me just viewing the world too strongly through my own lense, but I think it’s hard to overstate how much *culture* drives today’s politics. I feel like I would have *vast* more influence on the Trump voters I know in real life if I were more like them generally. 1/

Trump has tried his entire adult life to gain entry into the "cosmopolitan," upper strata of NYC society.  They see him for what he is---coarse, small-time real-estate grifter/failure---and won't have anything to do with him.  They comprehend him.  Thus, their hostility.
You know, some folks would be too ashamed to show their face at the party convention after single-handedly losing the previous general election to a Republican, let alone Trump. #STFUHillary
Hell no. So Trump and other politicians could try to ruin them too ?
Me too. The idea is "voting Trump out", but that's the wrong way to look at it. The election isn't whether Trump stays or goes, it's who should be President. And I cannot endorse Joe Biden or any corporate Democrat after what they did to Bernie and our movement.
No way! You have to be an idiot not to see that Trump is in Putin's debit

All but two states will now face extra coronavirus response cost, Trump decides  45 shows his total corruption...
The economy was amazing until the pandemic, and will recover. Trump can't control the pandemic, which would have happened no matter who was president.  The deaths are also not on Trump. 1) He can't control people's actions, and 2) most deaths are in D-led states anyway.

They'll get him under oath but I'm sure Trump would never do
If you don't believe when the ambassador himself alleging this on video, your level of cult following is beyond me. You're the kind of guy even if Trump rapes your wife, would say "No it was democrats " lol
What an idiot! Trump denied and you accepted ? From the guy who has told 20000 confirmed lies? British Ambassador himself alleged this. Look at his video
I think it's more like they cannot imagine Trump winning under these circumstances and therefore feel no need to hide who they really are this time.

Republicans always destroy the economy and democrats build it back. FACTS. Clinton handed over a treasury with a surplus. Bush ruined it with unnecessary wars and a huge mortgage crisis. Then Obama built it back up again. Now Trump destroyed it again
This is almost as funny as Donald Trump trying to tap dance his way through your interview.
no it’s not. you’re taking votes from Biden, ultimately giving Trump the upper hand.

Ironically, Kasich's failure to bend the knee could have cost him the VP slot. Trump needed Ohio more than Indiana.
The article I posted discuss both of these issues: First Step was a bipartisan bill that was not created or championed by Trump, just signed. And the opportunity zones have gone to largely help weathy families and many projects were underway before it was put into place.

Donald Trump was not previously a lifelong Democrat.
Trump has told them to hate the postal service, so here we go.
This is spectacularly dumb, but what's even funnier is the idea that even if "Thighland" was a more correct pronunciation, Trump would have taken the time and care to know that. He just called a national park actually here in America "Yo Semite" for fuck's sake.
There is literally no evidence to the narrative of Trump doing more for the black community than any other President. None. The list of claims are so minimal in action that this supposed “doing more” amounts to saying and not actually doing.
So you're OK with Trump, is what you're saying.  Good to know.
God Bless you President Trump ♥️🇺🇸♥️🇺🇸🙏🏻♥️🇺🇸🙏🏻♥️🇺🇸🙏🏻

Both sides said the future of the talks is uncertain. President Donald Trump is considering executive orders to address evictions and unemployment insurance, but they appear unlikely to have much impact.
After Yo-Semite and Thailand, I am guessing Nigeria wont be rolling across Trump’s teleprompter anytime soon...
Let’s examine, shall we:  A) “I have 2 daughters” and that’s the only thing letting him know rape is bad  B) the grammar, woof C) he turns this story into a political issue out of nowhere  D) “difficult to take either side serious” while trump has over 30 credible accusers.

Republicans have had 4 years to come up with a primary challenger to Trump. They had the perfect opportunity in the form of a fucking impeachment. They didn't do anything.  They're all going to vote for Trump again.
How the fuck does a conservative feel so entitled to think she can demand a right-wing candidate from the party she has opposed her entire life?  Republicans have had four years and an impeachment(!) to come up with a primary challenger for Trump. Why didn't they?
Democrats believe they own the blacks. Its a disgrace. Years of democrat leadership has not led to prosperity. Trump has done more for blacks than all of the democrats over the years.

You are correct. Franklin Graham does wonderful work( my family financially supports his ministry) however he needs to not allow Trump to intimidate him into supporting his agenda. Trump is manipulating these Christian leaders ONLY for the evangelical vote. Focus on ministry!
NBC News has Illinois classified as a Likely D state &amp; not a Solid D state in this presidential election. Under what conceivable scenario does Illinois vote for Donald Trump? Of course, Chuck Todd is the political director of NBC News, so we shouldn't be surprised, I guess.

That's the problem. Lebanon is as chaotic as any country in the Middle East. With Trump speculating on this, and stating it as fact, he has opened the door for extremists to blame America. They will say he knows something, when in reality he's blustering. Words matter. 😳😳

The truth is the exact opposite. He has spent his life reaching out to others who are sick or who have lost loved ones. He is a man of empathy. God bless him. Shame on u

Zoo visitors line up to see Trump in his natural habitat.

Trump's "Payroll tax cut" is a poison pill for Social Security and Medicare. It also only helps the working, not the unemployed. It helps the wealthier earners more than poorer ones who need it more.  It's welfare for the rich.

So Trump has adopted a 4 day work week now? All the while 162k Americans have died from Covid-19, our unemployment rate is record breaking high, and our election process is in tatters.

Oh well !   I guess Trump will have to do whatever he can do from the Oval Office.

Because Trump keeps funneling money into the stock market his own money. I mean he has the Fed buying stock in junk bonds they keep the market rising. The market is a false narrative you can’t go buy it it’s never true. We are in a recession unemployment at is at highest levels.
But none of it matters since Trump’s pedo friend successfully argued to the senate that the president can do whatever he wants as long as he feels it’s in the nation’s best interest.

Thanks alot Trump you suck.
Last year several of our closest allies  a threat under #45's leadership. That too is a historical marker Cluster Fluck?  Poll: Germans want US troops and nuclear weapons to leave country - Business Insider
I will say I think Kim’s efforts have been genuine but they’re a package deal so long as they’re married what’s even more concerning is his Bipolar disorder and how Trump and his operatives are trying to manipulate some of mania etc.
Your vote won't make a difference. Trump is going down with or or without your vote. I don't see you having much influence on the election outcome. Bye Felicia.
You are spreading lies.  Pelosi was telling people to go to China Town while Trump was banning travel.  While Trump was creating this covid task force they were still trying to impeach him.  They said he was being racist for shutting brown travel! WTAF! You all
I guess you'd rather watch a Biden interview?? Where he constantly says racist things.  Poor kids can be just as smart as white kids- said Biden, if you don't vote for me then you ain't black- said Biden.  While Trump has done more for Americans than any president in the past
Do you know that President Trump shut down travel to China while Nancy Pelosi was tweeting band telling people to come to China Town? Do your remember Dr. Fauci said the travel bans saved lives? Our president didn't kill your family.  China tried to cover up the fact that
Cool, take a picture with Obama family while ya there. Forget Trump.
except Trump is Trump
What will the GOP look like after having no backbone against Trump New party
I've been on that soapbox for weeks asking for Trump and Biden to submit to MRI brain scans to end the speculation.
Can you imagine being with this FOOL? I heard she is a TRUMP SUPPORTER 2020 make them cry again
So what! Someone like you are going to speak about what TRUMP SAYS! You are a joke!
Please make a deal y'all, this is how I keep up with the dances that I can't do😥😥He won't pull this one off! A lot of people that voted for Trump to blast Hillary Clinton have seen the light.
Trump said Friday that he told Aoun that three large aircraft filled with medical supplies, food and water were on their way to provide assistance.   via WSPA7
Trump has been responsible for over 160000 deaths; if you still back him only for his stand on abortion ; maybe you should set down and rethink this .......................your logicalness might need reviewing!
if u couldn't afford it, you got a subsidy and paid little to nothing...system wasn't perfect but the solution was to improve the things that were flawed, not nuke the whole damn thing as Trump has repeatedly (and is still) trying to do
u ever tried Google? or they not have it in Russia? It's literally one of the foundations of the ACA, written into law, which Trump administration has spent 4 years trying to dismantle with nothing to replace it. but Trump said it so its good, right?
I think President Donald Trump needs to fess up to all his pre-existing conditions!  Insanity is a pre-existing condition!!
When you're voted out, no need to return to South Carolina. You've abandoned us during this pandemic and we won't be welcoming you with open arms. Maybe Trump will save a room for you at Mar-a-Lago. Can't wait until  takes office!
Hilarious.  Why are is all of your fugly trump merch Made In China?? ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ haaaaa
. “Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare.”
Check out WeissFilms's video! I think we can all agree- in any state JOE BIDEN is 100000% better choice than Trump.
Lindsey Graham doesn’t care about South Carolinians, just pleasing his corporate and party masters — not to mention Donald Trump.   Disgraceful
This is so disturbing. Trump hates us. He hates these very people waving these flags. And there they go, like with video evidence of them being BUMBLING IDIOTS.
I say after Trump officially leaves office after 2024 that all patriots should delete twatter and make our own statement 🖕to twatter
Spare us the “blame Trump” for the virus lecture...
I am not a Trump advocate but this is an ignorant tweet my man. Big Pharma and it’s minions “politicized” HCQ intentionally to gain financially. That’s all......
Tell us of this response you speak of, I remember it being mostly ignored. I do remember trump banning travel from China in late January or early February and Democrats calling him racist . Pelosi calling for people to come to Chinatown for the party,
Black man who supported Trump shot dead; Some wonder if murder was politically motivated  Let's not turn away from knowing what is happening in our world
Anyone who would believe Trump has absolutely no idea what you’re talking about
Tara Reade  won't be Trump's guest.   She's a hardcore liberal.
Schiff constantly accuses Trump of his own dishonesty and criminal conduct. It is like a self confession everytime Schiff tweets.  I've never seen him panic so boldly though. Wow.
Well I am pro trump so there’s that
I believe NO poll unless I’m doing it, all are BS.  But I’d bet most Trump supporters, like me, are college educated.  McMaster, who knows? I’m not fond of him, but TRUMP 2020 I’m all for!
How long is Trump giving them until he signed executive orders...cause...
I love it! TRUMP 2020!
“Hail to the Chief” ? Seems totally normal given Trump’s mental decline.
Trump always taking credit for Obama's achievements.
...the strategy from the very beginning. Use the "Russian disinformation" angle to run interference for anything unsanitary about any of Biden's actions and attribute "doing Russia's bidding" to anything Trump might say about Biden. Truly an Idiocracy you all live in.
Hey Twitter,is the Trump supporters burning up this site!?😂🤣🇺🇸
Calling Trump an ass is being too kind.
Trump wins. But it is being framed that no matter how he wins, it will be disputed.   There are moving trucks staged right now at liberal city Walmart parking lots. They wait to be activated. Truck camping.  If you see this, report it. Or question them directly.
Trump has no idea what he’s taking about.
“I don’t care what anybody says” may be the first truth Trump has ever told.
Do you have anything positive to say about Trump???
Come on  we don’t want to hear you!! We want to hear President Trump.
IM VOTING FOR TRUMP AGAIN AND NO SPIN! DONE DEAL!
That why Trump building  a WALL so there is no one to put in cages , so people get in the line and wait there turn like my Family did
Don’t worry old man, President Trump has the backs of the American people. Stay locked up in your basement.
Well, I’m listening to President Trump speak. I’m sure that the folks at    are not happy at all. And, I’m sure  is locked away in his basement while this President is taking care of the American people! Happy weekend, liberals!!!
Guess this article is not fake..how convenient trump lovers
Do you think Donald Trump cares that Obama has 32 million more followers? I do. I think he cares a whole lot!
Where is Thighland? Trump: On the Earth.
If you look up Trump Train on Twitter and the users that post on there it’s really terrifying how the “conservative right” is so full of hate, division, violence, etc. They are literally gearing up for war and ready to kill. Building social media followers with the same mindset.
Black man who supported Trump shot dead; Some wonder if murder was politically motivated  I made a "George Floyd Matters" sign. I now need a Bernell Trammell Matters sign!
China and Iran want what our allies want: Trump to be defeated. #Biden2020 #Election2020
Good. He has no other way to campaign. Biden stays hidden. It’s almost Trump running alone. Let’s get some debates going. Joe can’t keep hiding.
If that's the best slogan that Biden and his team can come up with Trump doesn't have anything at all to worry about.
So hold on...let me get this straight.   - people slagged off Donald Trump on Tiktok - Trump threw a wobbler and demanded it be bought over by an American company so basically he could control it. - he didnt get that...threw another wobbler - Trump bans Tiktok  ~
I think people that adore Joe Rogan are similar to those that adore Trump.   I am surprised  he hasn't said Biden will hurt God with a guillotine.
And anti-Trump doesn't mean pro-Biden. My candidate dropped out a while back but that doesn't mean I want four more years.
Donald Trump The Apprentice show: You're fired. (Lisa Evans)
literally authored Reagan's massive corporate tax cut,  which Trump has simply copied. Voting for Joe and expecting change is like calling the arsonist and expecting him to put out the fire.
The Different of all That is Russian/Putin Working on  Help Trump and Attack Biden with Lies, Conspiracy Theories and Bad Propaganda, but China &amp; Iran does not working on to attach Trump, only they don't want Trump like The Majority of USA People!
She do not care , only  only care about Money that her that left her like Trump and To make Monet from The Porno Video of Ray J and Her and Botox &amp; Plastic Surgery!
I get where this is coming from, but if Nancy Pelosi doesn't mind shitting on   and  right now, under Trump, how much more will they be attacked under Joe's "leadership?" If they ran 20 people to stop Bernie, do you really expect change?
The Different of all That is Russian/Putin Working on  Help Trump and Attack Biden with Lies, Conspiracy Theories and Bad Propaganda, but China &amp; Iran does not working on to attach Trump, only they don't want Trump like The Majority of USA People!!!
Let be Real on Sec. Rice GOP ,RNC &amp; Trump will attack her on Benghazi and A She will be soft attacking  Pence , but Sen. Harris They goy nothing , because She is a String Woman and She can punch back real hard Pence &amp; Trump and She is a real Law &amp; Order! #BidenHarris2020
If I say both Trump and Biden are both evil and you can’t tell me the difference between the two please STFU TELLING ME WHY I SHOULD VOTE FOR BIDEN!!!! A no vote is a vote for Trump? AND!! SO WHAT!!! TO HELL WITH THEM AND YOU THIS ELECTION

Used to really like your show. Now all you do is talk about trump and make bad jokes. Highly disappointed.
Trump promised to bring back manufacturing jobs a he has deliv—.    Wait....   I’m being told......  nvm.
We only have one shot of getting Trump's fascist ass out of office and this complete dickhead is openly trying to fuck it up.  Screw you and your dumbass campaign, Kanye.
GREAT! A non Trump tweet! Too bad Joe Biden doesn’t have the mental capacity to be President.
I don’t see how Trump could’ve have done anything to make someone who voted for him in 2016 go the exact opposite and vote for a radical socialist. Trump hasn’t changed. He’s the same person in 2020 that we knew we were electing in 2016.
Try reading that out loud!  Also, I read that they organized on TikTok to order lots of Trump campaign supplies that they then destroyed.
28. do i like Trump - fuck no. i've never hated another human being as much as i hate that motherfucker.
Scary ,Joe says this &amp; should be immediately disqualified but all the MSM cares is how Trump pronunced Thailand. Even our local POS news didn’t cover Biden’s racist comments. The continued effort to destroy trump is on, right
how can u say that when he has done so much for the people. remember Obama said manufacturing jobs were not coming back. july was the best month for manufacturing in 15 months. thats trump helping the people. trump had prison reform, and has helped minoritie communities.
With all that being said Trump probably was made aware of tik tok existence after Tulsa and his reasoning is completely vengeance. Any good outcome would be accidental.
Leaders lead their people and convince them to act patriotically.  Trump however...... not so much.
It’s almost like people believed trump when he called it a hoax.
Trump right now...
What is WeChat and why does Trump want to ban it?
And that’s the genius. He stays away from public, and can’t do anything to make people not like him.   And Trump is making people dislike himself all on his own.   That’s why I think the election won’t be close.
Wrong! Tell me something Trump has done to equal 3 million Black men being locked up and the 3 strike deal written by Joe Biden.
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU WHO LIE AND ENABLE TRUMP ARE TRAITORS TO AMERICA. Period.
Today, I am designating 11 people responsible for the erosion of US Democracy.....  Donald Trump Mitch McConnell    Oh, hell- it’s MORE than 11. I will just say Trump’s enablers, the GOP, and the grifters cheering your treason on...
Bro it's literally because Trump's racism in the public eye has been far Greater than Joe. I don't trust either of them but Trump hasn't done a good job so I vote on results.
Hey news flash to everyone. There have and always will be racist on both sides. Trump is a racist who cares more about the economy. Democrats have created and used racist systems and organizations. But there are plenty ok both sides who aren't racist as well.
The entire Trump Administration is evidently blind and deaf.
I think the difference is the left folk i know do not like or want biden. They know hes a bad choice. However the right seems to ignore those about trump and make excuses. That HBO interview was like a parent arguing with a toddler. I dislike both, third party for me
anything better than Trump!
I’d rather not be right. It’s sad &amp; is a disgrace. I’ve never had a president fulfill so many promises &amp; he’s taken on topics many weren’t even aware of &amp; nothing had been done about. Trump is for America! In real time he is taking down those corrupted &amp; evil.
SOUTH CAROLINA although I’d like to vote in my home state of GA where I’ve been most of the last 1.5 yrs, am moving back &amp; lived for 26 yrs. I took my 10 yr old son to vote w/ me for Trump then woke him up to see results in real time. He’s all Right as am I &amp; most of my family.
There needs to be debates going on so the Left can see who &amp; what they’re really voting for. Too many stick to their guns, vote the way they always have, are uninformed or just hate Trump. If people really looked at the Joe/Bernie combined platform, it’s so radical it’s insanity!
Awesome News! My son went with me to vote for Trump &amp; I woke him up that night to see the results in real time. I think it’s important to speak to our kids &amp; get them involved as there’s a lot at stake. I informed him about both parties &amp; let him make up him mind. He chose Right.
My word. This should be a clue to any who doubted it before. This virus is the biggest fraud perpetrated against the American people. Trump said they aren't coming after him, they are coming after us, and you know what; he's right.
Nope. The GOP is Trump now by their own choice they are one and the same. 🤷‍♀️ #GOPBetrayedAmerica #GOPComplicitTraitors #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpHasNoPlan
Voters in South Carolina are split on how Gov.  has handled the COVID-19 outbreak, with 46% equally approving and disapproving of his work.  On the other hand, 51% disapprove of President Trump's response.
Trump has NEVER been worthy of ANY vote. #DumpTrump
He’s worth 400 million and he wants to be a billionaire, and also own a team. But with the way he puts down Trump and promotes fake racism, he may never achieve that. Hopefully not!
As you must be. Just can’t accept good news when trump is prez. Get ready for 4 more.
Couldn’t agree more. If you think Trump voters care one wit about the loveable loser John Kasjch, well, you don’t understand why Trump was elected in the first place. They can have him.
Don’t kid yourself.   The only statement you can make with a third-party vote is that you want more trump.
Chinese firms, criticized for being able to access U.S. capital markets without facing the same regulatory scrutiny as American competitors. Trump plan, Chinese firms that want to list in the U.S. for the first time would have to adhere to U.S. auditing standards immediately.
For a clue why Trump very much still has a good chance of winning the election one need look no further than this
I’m following , Trump responded the best he could have , Democrats blame him no matter what he does do you agree?? When he blocked flights from China Democrats said his racist . You have to tell me specifics why you not happy  how he responded
Joe Biden = sack of crap  Trump = sack of crap set on fire and sitting on your doorstep
Trump has no filter and says things he probably shouldn’t, but policy-wise, he’s a dang good president (if you’re a working middle-class American). He doesn’t let the political bullies in Washington control him. Not even close to the evil guy the leftist media portrays him as.
trump and Zuckerberg seem too chummy.
Independence Day III plane revealed.  In this sequel, Trump is President.
Most of us know what he meant, but the disparity in coverage is striking. Example: The very fine people comment Trump made. The media is at the heart of racial divide in this country and NBC’s coverage of Biden’s clarification is the perfect example.
Does trump have any plans for Nov 4th or beyond?  No.  He doesn't.  Biden has about a thousand things he'd like to start on Day 1 to begin the healing. trump just wants to stay out of jail.
If you're an acolyte of the cult-of-trump, then  -your God is now vulnerable to damage from Biden, and  -your God needs trump to protect Him.  trump doesn't "self-important" much, does he?
He misspoke. Get over it. Trump thinks Belgium is a city. Trump thinks Paris is in Germany. Trump thinks Colorado borders Mexico. Trump doesn't know the difference between England and The UK.
When the history of the trump-travesty is written, a central question will be  "how could people just let this happen?" You just answered it - sycophants desperate to be close to power, desperate to feel important.
When asked how a trump could demonstrate such incompetence and still remain in office, we will point to bootlicks like  (and of course others in far more important positions) who were willing to do back-flips to rationalize trump's abnormal, bizarre conduct.
"could siphon from Trump Blacks"  Only the best people...
Just once, it would be great to see NBC do a positive story on President Trump. Or, just tell the truth about Joe Biden!
Biden is a marginally less horrible candidate than Trump.  That margin becomes harder and harder to see with each passing day.  The current R/D system is a dumpster fire.
Don't expect US to help. Maybe January.  Trump is busy banning Tic Tok and letting us die.    #Biden2020   For the sake of the whole damn world!

But Trump would like us all to believe he wants to "save us money" by broadcasting his nomination acceptance from the White House? I call bullshit! #TrumpLiedPeopleDied
Mainstream has covered for him. Said it, "wasn't racist". No bias there.   Trump is racist just because he says, "Hello".

No, difference between Trump and Biden, one is a Closet Racist and one is a Open Racist
Republicans are synonymous with Russians in the Trump. Moscow Meghan has a ring to it.
I should say "most" and not "all" as not all of anyone vote or think one way or another. But you can see the majority of Black voters do not support trump where as latinos actually have a big percentage that do.
people cant name any racist remarks that trump has made,except the videos where they cut the sentence short, but we have many many that biden has said.

Where does Trump get off talking about being against God? The man that hasn’t attended any church services that I recall, unless it was for a photo op outside.    #trumphasnocredibilty
The sad truth is that thousands of Christians, led by their pastors from the pulpit, will go out and vote for Trump simply because he claims Joe Biden is against God. I don’t know either man, but I can tell you which one exemplifies Christian virtues more and it ain’t Trump.
It’s nonsensical to say you are voting against Trump and then not for Biden. You could get away with not voting for either.
The stupidy of his statement is overwhelming. Joe Biden is a devoted Catholic paritioner, Trump has never attended church other than political events. He has no faith, no belief in a higher power. In Trimps mind he IS the higher power, the choosen one. F him.
Joy, first of all...love you on The View. Secondly, we are powerful when we band together. Vote Trump and the GOP syncophants out!  Talk to your Republican friends, show them the way to peace, prosperity and true leadership.
#ladyG is sweating bullets. Let’s go folks, elect Jamie Harrison. Greenville, SC has been underserved with Graham, let’s get someone who works for us not Trump. Vote Harrison.

LeBron James laughs off Trump's criticism of NBA players taking a knee
I no longer have any respect for him. I feel like trump is blackmailing him and this is when you tell truth or get out of politics Putin has trumps secrets and he is Putin’s puppet.
I don't think you are being honest.  If Biden chooses an Ostrich for his VP pick, you would still vote for him vs Donald Trump
Keep telling yourself that. The Republicans showed their true colors...again...when they chose Trump.  Game over.

Know what Trump can’t do on #TikTok that he can do on Facebook &amp; YouTube? Buy political ads.  TikTok was built for virality, and they prohibit political ads. The narrative is therefore hard to control, &amp; the political messaging/speech of its users leans mostly to the left.
Because he’s patient zero. Therefore immune. Then sent it to China to wreak havoc. We already knew the source was bat shit, and Trump does hang upside down when he sleeps. This is an airtight theory. #COVID19 #TrumpVirus
Keep watching MSM and believing everything they say even when the facts prove them wrong. They hate Donald Trump and regular people who voted for him. They twist every story to use it against him.

Donald Trump should be removed as the Republican representative for President right now. Pick someone that is not a crook and really believed in our Constitution.
Imagine that. I love the way that the liberal media is handing over the presidency to Donald Trump. The great thing is they have no idea that they are actually helping the president.
FINALLY!!!!! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP IS "NOT" A RACIST!!! BUT!!!! VP JOE BIDEN IS!!!! THEREFORE, YOU BLACKS CAN STAND ON TV SUPPORTING BIDEN, SHOWING THE WORLD JUST HOW STUPID YOU ARE!!! 😂😝😛😎🤣🤪
Perjury lied to court[Judge],mislead the public.every thing they accused TRUMP of they are guilty of doing.they payed money to a foreign entity before and during an election to harm a political opponent
What about Nepal, (stole this on another's account) think about it.... using trump's reading skills
are we not going to discuss Trump saying “it will save taxpayers money” for him to accept nomination at White House? The campaign is supposed to pay for that, not taxpayers.
Washington Post Forced To Issue Big Correction After Botching Trump-Twitter Post
Wow they are wasting money sending Trump mail to the Charleston County Dem chair/delegate.  Keep up the dumb moves.
Wallace is full of shit. President Trump loves talking to the American people because he knows that he is doing all that he can to give people the advantage of the American dream.
I can’t see how the CC votes for Trump. How many assault allegations? 15?
I am sure President Trump Thanks you. You liberals just don't know when to stop. The American people now know what the radical leftists are trying to do to their country. Vote Democrats out in November.
It's still SOMETHING. Can't wait to see Trump's tweets
Why don't you take you take Trump to Canada and keep him there with you. You are obviously into self-abuse.
And the Gestapo is....Trump.
I guess you would know about being bent on both knees with Trump standing in front of you. How’s the taste? Does it taste like oranges?
As soon as you tell me when Trump was because if you're using an UNCONSTITUTIONAL vote by the House on UNCONSTITUTIONAL Articles as an impeachment, then that makes you the dumbass in this equation.
They also don't want Joe Biden to debate Donald Trump .Because  he will leek crimes and information about political stunts. He knows things he doesn't know he knows.If that makes  any sense
Because Trump endorses it.
How dare you compare anyone to that monster. Hitler is responsible for millions of murders. I don’t care how much you don’t like  Trump but don’t ever compare the two.
Gerrymandering is drawing the maps for the House. I would actually put Jimmy Carter as the worst President in my lifetime. Hey go back to MSNBC, I hear a top producer left because it is fake news with a Trump obsession.
I’m glad Twitter and Facebook aren’t playing about their false BS postings!!  Twitter temporarily restricted Trump campaign's ability to tweet over false Covid-19 claims
I am a Trump supporter. I have heard the same shit for 2 months. I don't care about ventilators. Fix the country and unite the people or you will lose this election and America will never be the same.
If President Trump can't bring the country together to defeat that left wing babbling idiot then he deserves to lose. He better get his message together and take it to the American people now.
Crazy Actor VICIOUSLY Attacks Trump
I think the fact people think Kanye isn’t serious about running because “those close to him have raised concerns about his mental health” . Trump IMO probably doesn’t have the best mental health based on tweets and videos, and Biden has even MORE problems with mental health!!
Didn't Trump disassemble the National Park Service shortly after he took office? He's just doing it to get votes. He might do it again if re-elected.
Like trumpal dickless, looks like he has to pay for his pussy like trump did.
My hands been itchin so if trump gonna drop that stimi he need to get there

Stop raced baiting. Trump is about to lie: “people are saying”.
Ted Cruz called out this Trump-hating NBA owner for refusing to say these three words
CONGRESS is the reason people might loose their homes. Dems and Reps can’t get their heads out, and send bill to President Trump. If Trump does things on his own, to help us, will you thank him, or still blame him for all? No u will complain. Not good enough
Remember, CONGRESS=Dems + Republicans, proposed bill, voted bill, sent to Pres Trump for final signature. Don’t blame Pres Trump. Blame congress.
Fox News is freaking out after Donald Trump told his supporters a harsh truth about the network
If Biden accept to debate Trump he'll mop the floor with him, if he refuses it shows how weak he is; he cannot stand 2 hrs exchange of ideas.
Oh noes! 1.7 million without power in NY/NE from storm. Damn you Trump!   Does rain kill Covid? Nahhh, the assholes on the left will say it makes it more virulent and we must close the world down till Nov 4, or whenever a Democrat gets elected.
Trump lies about everything else, so why not?
Bette you are very delusional. Trump is not responsible for any of the deaths. That would be more the democrats fault if you want to blame someone.

The Democrats hatred for Trump is being totally exposed in the house. Vote Democrats out in November and end their corruption.
The hatred shown by the Democrats is going to hand Trump the presidency. The American people have had enough of their bullshit and obstruction.
So what's Trump saying now, if you re-elected me, I'll let you live? Just remove him from office now, the people are supposed to have the power to do that.
If he can Trump is going to find some way to prevent it.
literally any president other than trump would massivey benefit our international interests, literally ANYONE who doesnt make us constantly make us look like a joke by spreading horrific misinformation is a better option

Trump will win in a landslide! BAHAHAHA!!!
Jesus these women are not domestic terrorist, and these goons in Portland are not cops. I see you are a pathological liar just as much as trump is. They are moms.
Well at least he was respectful of his family unlike trump. Beside trump put up a wall and hid in his bunker like the bunker bitch he is.
Oh please trump is suppose to be the president had it been a democratic you assholes would be all over them about not doing their damn job. Maybe if he acted like a president and had done more than calling Covid a hoax and stopping China flights.
That’s because the entire trump family were born with no soul and a empty heart.
That is not Trump, the grandest dragon of them all is the Democratic Party. And with its racist history it should be abolished.

I had a good joke but then I seen something that trump said that rattled me , so uhhh yea
That is true to an extent but a lot of voters were scared to admit publicly that they were voting for Trump because they did not want to be perceived as prejudice, but still voted for him anyways.
your leader trump is the Swamp King, he’s filling it with corrupt friends of his and ass kissing clowns.  If trump was draining the swamp after three and half yrs he’d at least have the swamp cleaned yet he doesn’t.
You poor sad trump parrot, all you’re doing is parroting a pathological liar and moron. How’s those closed Borders working for you dip shit, trump isn’t the one closing borders the other countries are closing their country from America.
Saving the children part, you seem perfectly okay with brown skin children being locked in cages. As long as you worship trump there is no truth, you believe his lies and repeat those very lies as the truth.
Truly you need to hit your fucking head on the wall and wake the fuck up to reality. Only terrorist this country needs gone is the corrupt Swamp King trump. Btw genius this country belongs to every American no matter who they vote for.
trump has failed at everything he touches, having to file bankruptcy on his casinos proves what a shitting person he is and sucked at being a businessman as failed even more as a president.

I will never understand how anyone can defend Trump. Never! It tells me all I need to know about them
You forget the numerous times EX-President Obama accused individuals of crimes when in fact they were innocent. He reacted too fast without facts. He was worse than Pres Trump.  Dems lies are true while Reps truths are lies. So sad

As followers of Christ we are supposed to preach the gospel, not preach politics or President whomever. We are to preach Jesus and him crucified. Now if you are not a follower of Christ, then preach Trump daily.
I hear what you are saying. All those that have let him hear what the Spirit of the Lord is saying unto the church, and Donald Trump isn't it. Focus on kingdom work, where Jesus is King of Kings and Lord of Lord's. No president has nothing on Jesus.
You can't focus on one person and call that the gates of hell. Demon activity is rampid in the world. My focus is not Donald Trump.
Joe is scared to debate Donald Trump
Yes. That why the voters who can't vote by mail needs to be prepared for a 12 hour wait. It will be be worth bc our lives are literally on the line now. Let's vote this Trump trainwreck and his lapdogs out. #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt #VoteBidenToEndThisTrumpNightmare
Whatever I support Trump. He is not perfect but he supports these things I believe in: a safe country supported by a strong Military. Opposes Abortion, a Border wall stopping illegal immigrants, a reasonable Tax rate, a growing economic base, a right to practice my faith, decency
Sorry, not really a thing to like, haha, but really, I first got on this site to specifically follow the insanity of Donald Trump. Now I'm here. And people seem to give a damn about some things I say. What a trip, every time I get a reply or a like. Or, God forbid, a retweet.
This whole “Thighland” thing reveals an important truth about Trump’s enablers; they know they have to defend and stroke his ego.    Most people can laugh at themselves, admit a slip of the tongue and move on.  Narcissistic sociopaths cannot.  His defenders know this.
That's misleading as hell. 75% of young non-Hispanic Black voters? That's a full 15 points lower than the overall Black vote a Democrat normally gets. And it was in June, just after Trump had deployed tear gas on protesters.
Your Conclusion: yes Iran continued as usual not even a roast for the Poor Folks. Obama returns to Oval Office “I hope this works” Trump “another mess, Cancel” 1. Obama bad deal  2. Trump Cancel great deal!

Tish James is not playing games. She was definitely the right choice for NYAG. No wonder Trump is shaking,  is tearing Trump world apart, piece by piece, and Barr, the corrupt GOP nor Trump clueless kids can't stop her. She would make the perfect USAG.
You made no points in this tweet (Bar Talk). Trumps first year was filled with Fog: MSM, FBI, Dems and Confused Republicans. The Noise from Main Street Powerful Establishment forces etc. Despite the Swam attack Trump has done the best job of any Recent (50 yrs) President.
You shift subjects when you see a valid point. I’ll give you one there were 19 Republicans challenging Trump in the Primary. The establishment ( both parties) stonewalled Him. Immoral powerful forces.  Boener-Ryan damaged Trumps first year.
That’s Trump &amp; the TrumpParty she’s talking about.
No..they were setting up roadblocks where they could against Donald Trump.
Look how mad everyone got in here over Trump being mentioned and not in a negative way.  He lives in people's heads rent free.  Bahahaaaaaaa

Biden will not debate Trump.   His leftist handlers cannot allow the world to see his cognitive decline. The downside of refusing to debate is FAR outweighed by the downside of revealing his true condition
Sounds like Trump needs to do more rallies.
I have they are on GIF. I never believed Trump was an innocent Child or a Saint. He gets the job done  and looks out for America.  I also trust Him based upon the past four years.
That was my point. The postal workers hate Trump and will discard “red” ballots.
I remember when one of his campaign rally’s or something where he railed on Obama for golfing so much and how “he’d be too busy working to golf.”  He’s played more golf than any president except for Wilson and Eisenhower.

I think there is this fear of being put in the history books as an enabler for Trump's fascism if Biden loses. He has seen the news for the last four years that has blamed him, and if it happens again, whether deserved or not, he's internalized it.
Trump closing the gap. Wait till the live debates start and it’s over.
NASCAR you are America promote The GOP and President Trump. Bump the Democrats aside and put the Liberal agenda in the pits!Trump has given the entire US military to Putin, so what’s a little uranium.

In one word: Trump. Our country is doomed.

Buehler? In my 66+ years I've never seen a more incompetent candidate than Joe Biden at age 77. His dementia is obvious to all. Dems painted themselves into this corner starting with the #Shampeachment using Biden as the "wronged" party by Trump's fear of his winning.

No, Fauci is a Democrat. He knows that if Trump fires him he will be roasted by the media so he is doing his part to use this virus to bring him down.

Probably true because of the pandemic and Trump’s own interferences. But even Trump, who was elected, cried of fraud.  This only occurred in 1876, 1888, 1960, 2000, 2004, and 2016.  4 were a popular vote win but electoral loss. Last 3 are recent and 2 of those are a party change.
In other news, (1) Dems lost bid to reduce military again (2) Ferguson officer vindicated again (3) Clinton implicated w/Epstein again (4) Lib snowflakes unhinged w/Trump tweet again (5) MSM tries and fails to sway voters. Again.
You're spreading fake news, Trump heard about Epstein and he threw him off his property at Mar-A-Lago!
President Trump ought to sue the hell out of you and your husband
We did see it! In 2016. When y’all were worried about Hillary’s emails. She warned you . She warned us all. Now we have to fight Trump and his SS men.
A man that never recognized the president as the President. Over 63 million people and several million Democrats put Trump in the whitehouse and he  negated it to the whole world.
At Lewis Funeral, Obama Calls Filibuster a ‘Jim Crow Relic’   That big ear giraffe as usual had to make an a** of his self and use the funeral to show what a Bigot he is, and make a political speech.
please invite Andrew Duncomb to the White House!!! Trump supporter that got stabbed by Antifa. Tucker just aired an interview!!!!! MAGA2020
I like Trump
Hey Tommy boy do you remember when you said that dragons would fly around and blow fire if Trump won in 2016?? Where are the dragons bitch!!?!?!
How Racist Is Trump’s Republican Party? Good discussion of the meaning and impact of racism.
One less trump supporter WHO’S NEXT???
I remember seeing this and being sick with shame that they’re in the black section at a Trump rally in Tulsa with NO protection. In hindsight they’re celebrating our destruction. In the Elmer Fudd Fit.
Twitter moderators are outsourced to India. These Hindus do not understand I.S. CUSTOMS. Why does Twitter have foreign moderators whose country does not favor Trump Administration.
Soooooo..... we’re more or less at the point where Trump is playing his Fisher-Price fiddle as the US burns, right?
Your obsession of thus virus is ridiculously. Hydrochloroquine is the cure. Democrats wanna hide this to turn ppl against trump. Won’t happen in America
has been right about Donald Trump for a long time. Folks might want to listen. Time for the media to choose. America or Trump? Time for all of us regardless of occupation, to choose.
I sincerely hope that after Rep. Lewis is laid to rest that  comes out with an unequivocal and scorching retort to Trump floating the delay of the November election. Trump must go!
He can’t do this and it should only be talked about or reported on in this way . Congress sets the date of elections and Trump’s term end Jan. 20, 2021. Period! He must go!
Richardson: Letters from an American. US deaths exponentially increasing, economy crashing, red zones growing, medical experts deeply concerned. Trump does not care! Depends on magic?
Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan #sickmayor is saying President Trump  is using his riot control measures as a political ploy. What does she think she is doing? This is about all human lives and this BS has to stop.
Walks like a duck, quacks like a duck. He's a Democrat based on his actions. Hasn't stated if he will vote for Trump yet, either.
Trump administration took action yesterday to follow-up on his Executive Order from May. Good step in the right direction, IMO.
Another violation of the first amendment! Loved seeing that Trump administration is questioning whether Rule 230 of the CDA still applies to these platforms. Keep fighting and spreading truth.
The extremely obvious difference between Biden and Trump's mental acuity is impossible to deny. Keep in mind that due to Donald Trump's brother dying from alcoholism he vowed to never drink or smoke. Looks to me like clean living pays off later in life.
Just saw this inquiry sent to the FCC about Rule 230 of CDA.
When voting straight party ticket on November 3, the ballot should have three choices: Democrat, Republican, trumplican. trump knew which party he could take over. Which party he would be able to play on their weaknesses.That’s exactly what statues do. Even if you disagree on that part, mobs ripping down statues is still wrong, as is burning books. Fascist behaviors the left has been showing recently. You guys do you though. Just know all your doing is re-electing Trump. See you in November.
That was before the Wuhan virus. Do you not see how he is bringing back most of the manufacturing jobs that went to China? Do you see how our leaders had sent all of our medical supplies equipment medicine to China &amp; Trump is bringing them all back?
HUGE NEWS: After nearly a decade of Republicans attacking Barack Obama for protecting pre-existing conditions, Donald Trump claims he will sign an executive order to protect pre-existing conditions, even though Obama did that almost a decade ago.
One might add, Daniel, that Trump is trying to destroy that law.
So Trump can say it's been addressed. And go on to name drop the NYT.

Meeting a white boy that doesn’t like trump is like a nice crisp breath of fresh air
It’s trump or Biden.  That’s it.  Period.  End of freaking discussion.  I don’t care if he picks a can of beans.
I find it interesting that when he had to meet with Trump he tested positive but when he went home he tested negative....coincidence?
"Is Trump worthy of the Black vote, and if your answer is yes, why do you think close to 90% have rejected him?"
The fish stinks from the head down and the GOP leadership are the ones i see rejecting the science the EU used. Trump continues to spread false info. We have 4.2% of the world population and 25.6% of the deaths. See the vid below.
Your defense began with: 'During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump spoke extensively on the need to lower federal spending – which he appears to be very serious about now that he’s taken office.'   Perhaps you should check your own pill box to be sure 'Fri' is empty.
The unemployment rate in the black community remains unchanged at 14.2 %. while the Latino unemployment rate is 12.3% and the Asian unemployment rate is 9.1%. Stop lying about what Trump has done for blacks. These service jobs that pay deplorably are not a living wage. #Coon
What a surprise. Left wing "fact checkers" are actually just trying to cover up for Dems.  And these people are in charge of fact checking Trump?
Anyone who picks the moron Trump over Biden is a moron!!! Black white red or any color!
But apparently you think Trump is SO AWFUL yet you would vote for Biden who is clearly NOT FIT.... So, I guess that shoe fits YOU then doesn't it!
Trump is good at 3 things lol  Ignoring important questions  Making fun of Joe Biden  And pretending to know how to golf
#TrumpHoaxedAmerica with his "corona virus response" failure and the  did nothing.

so why didn't Trump ban musicly? #tiktokban
Trump’s understanding of religion is about the same as most devout Americans.
His clone is not working. Just think about it, when did Joe first start declining? It was to the best I can tell, it happened after President Trump’s impeachment scandal fell? It was really close to that time may be a little bit before that? does anybody know the answer?
These people are so F stupid. Finding any excuse to support Trump without having the courage to just say they support Trump.

I don’t agree with your views about President Trump, however, I’m sorry you’re being attacked for being gay. Many many gay children from small town America are and have lived what you’re experiencing. Stay strong. Hopefully, you have a support system with family.
Where have you been lately in terms of Biden/Trump?
I can't explain what my brain just did. Just when you think Trump cant F things up anymore...at least this one is already a known criminal.
Same woman who said she was never proud of her country until Obama got elected.  All the more reason to RE-ELECT TRUMP.  Anyone reading this needs to make sure all family, friends and associates are registered to vote and make it to the polls!
It's been THREE YEARS and the only thing Trump has done is hold a few White House meetings.  He talked about an Executive Order. WHERE IS IT?  Time is running out!
With how far left the Democrats have gone I believe it does now. Not voting for Trump is voting for a progressive movement we may never recover from.
No. Give me a break. None of this bullshit… It’s Biden or Trump that’s it
So let me get this straight, my tax dollars are going to pay for Trump to go and campaign. That is absolutely infuriating. Republicans really want to just bury themselves don’t they… Go the way of the dodo and dinosaurs

Graham has a lot to loose. He's being blackmailed by Trump and will do ANYTHING Trump says to keep it under wraps.
Trump has something bad on Graham. No one in SC cares about his sexual orientation. Graham is a threat to our nation security at this point.
When Trump came on the political scene I was a centrist Republican but Trump doesn't represent me at all. Trump is not honest and he is not smart. Trump doesn't believe in responsibility. His pandemic response is a big failure. I'll be voting for Biden. I'm a #LincolnVoter
They won’t have to Bret. You assuming an unbiased media is going to ask questions and hold him accountable....we both know that’s not going to happen. He will stay in his basement, play dead, and be elected President because people hate Trump that much.
Why is no one talking about this in the MSM?! Hunter Biden trouble trouble trouble. where is Hunter?! Thank You, President Trump   for draining the swamp.
Biden has NOT taken a cognitive test and gets upset when asked the question.  No wonder Dems are keeping him locked in the basement and don't want him to debate Trump!
This whole "will Biden debate" thing is a ruse.  They are going to make expectations SO LOW for Biden, that just showing up will mean the hate Trump media declares Biden the debate winner.
It will be interesting to watch the political careers Trump enablers will secure. If there are any. The good people of the Dakotas spend so much time in their vehicles Rush Limbaugh is always their co-pilot.
If you’re AFRAID for Biden to debate Trump you must be TERRIFIED of him squaring off with Putin.
If Biden can’t debate Trump imagine how he was square off against Putin.
So someone who suck a dick to get her start in politics or the lady who went on TV and lied about Benghazi? Dems trying everything they can to let Trump win. 😂😂

idk but Kliman just put out a challenge to people to come on his podcast and debate him about Trump, lol.

Hey Trump, find a new word! Stop saying tremendous every other word. You cannot enunciate, you never speak full sentences. Just stop talking. Oh yes, by the way, YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE!
I'm not lost.  Trump is NOT my savior.  He did a lot of things in his past that I hate.  But he hasn't done any of those things while in office.  People can change.  Unlike Biden who hasn't changed one bit.  So many Dems are leaving the party because of the extreme policies.
We'll be so proud of yourself.  Obama and all of the last Presidents golfed a lot.  At least Trump donates his salary every single time.  No one before him has done so.

Trump is so tough on China.
Biden is running against him.  I certainly have the right to state the obvious.  So...you going to vote for him?  A bit hypocritical don't you think?  You may want to find a different topic to attack Trump about since your candidate is a sleaze and a crook (Ukraine).
Here is the fact check on the "few". I don't like any of this but they have continued to illegally enter our country because there have been no ramifications.  Trump is prosecuting the parents and I agree.  It will never end if there are no ramifications.  We cannot keep

This seems like a bad idea for Trump. I mean, most of his ideas are bad, but this one seems particularly perilous. One thing we all know about Trump, even supporters, is he isn’t religious man. The next real journalist who interviews should ask, “Could you talk about your faith”?
What about Nepal, (stole this on another's account) think about it.... using trump's reading skills
Trump has turned The Bible and American politics upside down!
Trump likes to break things and blame things.

Suburban women went for the sappy prepared speeches by Obama. He did nothing for them. Same in 2012. He did nothing for them again.  The same women voted against Trump because he's words were harsh yet he's delivered jobs &amp; better wages for them.  2020 vote by results not words!

are we not going to discuss Trump saying “it will save taxpayers money” for him to accept nomination at White House? The campaign is supposed to pay for that, not taxpayers.
Where's Twitter and FB when Biden &amp; his campaign say that President Trump is responsible for the deaths of 150,000 Americans? That's a flat out LIE. A virus killed these Americans NOT Trump. A virus no one here or in any country  has any answers on how to stop that China spread.
Donald Trump,"Fat Donnie", is a mooch and numbskull.
I cannot respect anyone in trump's arena that enforces his lies about this virus.  She is a very misdirected person and needs to speak the truth, whether in his presence or not.

I am sure President Trump Thanks you. You liberals just don't know when to stop. The American people now know what the radical leftists are trying to do to their country. Vote Democrats out in November.
I have to pause. The Trump Administration has normalized the idea that an AG should have political motives. That was certainly my first thought as well.

Owen Schoryer theorized that Mika had an affair with Trump.  Makes sense.  Do you agree?
Trump had this economy booming,and he will do it again. Biden will continue to sell our country out to China. Clyburn is a disgrace. Democrats want American taxpayers to pay for the health care of illegal aliens. Democrats continue to put illegal aliens above citizens.

I am a Trump supporter. I have heard the same shit for 2 months. I don't care about ventilators. Fix the country and unite the people or you will lose this election and America will never be the same.
If President Trump can't bring the country together to defeat that left wing babbling idiot then he deserves to lose. He better get his message together and take it to the American people now.
Put people back to work and there will be no need for a stimulus. Democrats desperately want to keep the country closed. They think it makes Trump look bad. It doesn't. It shows democrats don't give one damn about Americans,or the country.
So you like an ad where Biden steals  Trump's Made in America talking points after he talks about his gas guzzling  Corvette then says he wants to change to electric cars the same electric cars that turned out to be a flop under Obama's admin after they gave him a ton of money.

Because Trump keeps funneling money into the stock market his own money. I mean he has the Fed buying stock in junk bonds they keep the market rising. The market is a false narrative you can’t go buy it it’s never true. We are in a recession unemployment at is at highest levels.
But none of it matters since Trump’s pedo friend successfully argued to the senate that the president can do whatever he wants as long as he feels it’s in the nation’s best interest.
Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, will be mourned at a private funeral in Atlanta today.
If scripture indicates that the world will only get worse before Christ comes back then does keeping Trump in office contribute to the end game or does Biden take us closer. Because neither one of them can make anything better. Unless your idea of better is a worldly one.

Pres. Donald Trump praised and Joe Biden called out the president over the meaning of the latest unemployment numbers, which was 10.2%, higher than the 10% peak during the Great Recession.
How about this?  Lebanon had a horrible explosion approx 130 people killed. The USA has had over 150,000 people killed by COVID 19. PEOPLE are losing their homes, etc. Why is Trump sending help and not taking care of people in USA?
Oh well !   I guess Trump will have to do whatever he can do from the Oval Office.
This is a joke. The  isn’t liberal at all. Fuck off after Trump please.
You are only interested in Trump and padding your pockets.

None of this is surprising.  Iran and China both feel they can gain more from Democrat leadership while Russia believes it can capitalize on Trump's focus on China.  Every country in the world does what is in its own self interest.
There’s peer reviewed work on Trump’s appeal to Christian Nationalism which is not necessarily the same thing as Christian values.

You’re  aware calling Covid19 the China Virus is xenophobic, RACIST and plain out WRONG but you keep doing it to appeal to your White Supremacy groups. A Racist Trump is always gonna be a Racist Trump and that’s just how it is. As YOU said about virus deaths “it is what it is.”
Watching  grill Trump admin officials feels like taking a sip of ice cold water after wandering in the desert for days. How his interview style isn't the standard for journalists in this country is beyond me. He literally just asks good follow-ups &amp; they crumble

Because Trump keeps funneling money into the stock market his own money. I mean he has the Fed buying stock in junk bonds they keep the market rising. The market is a false narrative you can’t go buy it it’s never true. We are in a recession unemployment at is at highest levels.
But none of it matters since Trump’s pedo friend successfully argued to the senate that the president can do whatever he wants as long as he feels it’s in the nation’s best interest.

Ugh the last thing I ordered was a biden/Harris magnet and that's definitely not going to help. I need like a felted mouse
That’s certainly a defensible position. I happen to disagree. I did not think Obama was a “token” or pandering at all. He was unexperiened, but that’s not always bad, and he had real talent and charisma. He was the real deal. Harris feels like a handout, and Biden said as much.
As if any one needed another reason not to vote for Hiden' Biden!
Other than the part about Biden driving the relationship in the White House (I think it would be more mutual), these paragraphs ring true to me.

This is important. Everyone who thinks Biden isn’t progressive enough should read this. Elections matter, none more than this one. #AmericasGreatestMistake #BidenHarris2020Landslide
And that's exactly what Harris is. Biden announced well in advance that he was intentionally choosing a woman of color. Forget personality, credentials, policy. Nah. It has to be a woman of color. That doesn't seem condescending to you?
Cause like it or not, it will be Biden or Trump. There is no third choice. Be angry or be angry AND plot a move forward.
Harris did awful things which she owned. Can you work with her and Biden or Trump? Thsts the question.
I'm sorry, the persuade idea is bunk. Look at BLM over the last few months, how many demands for reform made it into the DNC platform? Look at Biden / Obama's response to standing Rock and Occupy.  No, it's a tactic to quell dissent, you're either doing it willingly or just naïve

Congratulations again on being a delegate &amp; such wonderful news on it being a Biden-Harris ticket.
In 20-30 years, in the same way we see ads from Biden/Markey about being the sons of working class people, we're going to see similar ads in the upstate from the liberal children of manufacturing workers like BMW. Mark my words.
And then the using of people make me sick. Some fault Biden as a racist but the majority of black people don't think so. So why keep that tone?
Nope. But he's more concrete than green and u can get things accomplished in a Biden administration. But you don't want that, do you?
🎉🎉🎉They do,my lib-in-law said not only will Biden win and it will be a landslide-but she is leaving town as Trump peeps are going to riot. When I asked how she felt when the inner city people rioted robbed destroyed stores in the city next to us: They were white supremacists.
If I am not mistaken Kamala Harris had to be vetted before she could be on the Biden/Harris ticket. Also, the POTUS is dealing from the bottom of the same deck that he used against President Obama. The whammy won’t work!!!!
Joe Biden calls for a nation-wide mask mandate to save at least 40,000 lives.
I'm voting for Biden and Harris as a step in the right direction. Thsts MY solution. You do what you want or need to do.
Trump is FIXING the election, and the GOP looks the other way. All you say about Biden is an outright lie, Trump said He would cut payroll taxes, where do you think Social Security helping our seniors (if any are left 160,000 deaths) comes from
So Facebook fact checks a post about Kamala Harris’ grandparents owning slaves and says “it lacks context” not, it’s not true bc it is .. now they’re publishers!!! Biden is a plagerizer with his “possibilities “ piece from president Reagan .. they’re quite a pair!
I'm starting to get fall 2000 flashbacks. I can already hear Biden's concession speech after SCOTUS halts the NY / NJ absentee ballot counts because "it can't be assumed these voters evicted in Spetember will ever return to the city" or some shit and Trump wins both states by &lt;1%

First, this is a dereliction of duty. But also I  think it's the clearest proof that, at least right now, McConnell doesn't think Trump will win in November (and, thus, might as well leave the mess for Biden to spend political capital fixing)
YES! They want her to be VP. Based off seeing already how Biden looks physically could trigger a massive heart oqqq1qr stroke.  And that woman would be the one to take over.  That is what they are gonna do.  And yes she is a woman and very pretty, but not on the inside.

Biden at 52% leads Trump at 40%.
Kamala Harris has often focused on her identity as a Black woman. But her selection as Joe Biden's running mate is putting the spotlight on her as the first person of Asian descent on a major party presidential ticket.
I do appreciate the moment. My grandma cried when Barack won. She always loved Biden talked about how handsome he was (She’s from Delaware.) She has since been radicalized and can’t stand Joe or Kamala. She’ll vote blue, it’s just been interesting to watch her change.
this #trump ad about the lady losing her job because of COVID and then saying Biden wants to raise taxes and is weak. Does someone wanna tell her that if Trump didn’t call COVID a hoax for three months maybe she would be employed?
Who’s going to tell the Biden team that if they embrace this position they win in a landslide?
I really think this is our future, sadly. Choosing who we dislike the least. Biden wasn’t my choice in the primary and neither was Harris. But I’ll vote for anyone to unseat the current administration. Politics is so ugly. Good people are going to shy away from it
I literally knocked on hundreds of doors in the Pee Dee before the primary and more than 80% were definite Biden voters.

Biden has ran for senate many times, it’s probably an old habit. But the list is too long for me to list all of Trump’s gaffes. I just need someone with experience and fucking empathy to be the President to get us back to normal so we can start to move forward. Trump is a stain
"He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground." -
Biden just tweeted that Trump called white supremacists “very fine people.” This is demonstrably false and yet, you guys are so ready to embrace a party that relies on misrepresentation and lies.

Sure, Biden won’t give us M4A, but shouldn’t we put ourselves in the best position to keep it if someone runs on it in 2024 and is able to pass it during her tenure?  Same with GND or voting rights
A lot of this depends on how you think the electorate (actual voters) in Michigan, WI, and PA have changed since 2016. If *it’s at all to the left* (even a real difference of a 1-2 points left) a 60-70% odds of Biden victory seems understated.
I'm not a Kamala apologist, I literally just fact checked that tweet. That's all. I'm not voting for Biden/Harris. Period. But I have to say: If Facebook is the platform for disinformation, then I'm inclined to say, Twitter is the platform for misinformation.
Maybe if you're just upset about this election work on your state elections or run for office but please don't go out of your way to convince people to not vote for Biden/Harris. If you vote third party or chose not to vote you are complicit if trump wins again.
Y'all, I want to believe. I would love for you to change my mind and get me excited about Biden/Harris. Yes, they'll be better than Trump. That's a given. What I'd really, really like is for someone to give me more than that.
Like I get that this isn't the ticket I wanted and I have OPINIONS but I'm going to vote for Biden/Harris and I'm not going to disparage the only thing that is going to get Trump out of office.
I was going to vote for Biden, but Kamala Harris' toxic online supporters have made that impossible. I have to question the judgement of the candidate who picked a running mate responsible for such disgraceful behavior. #KHive #KamalaHarrisForVP
Racist stuff after posting a video calling Biden racist. Don’t forget that  I hate it here
Pence is a wet noodle and he's as unfit for VP as Trump is for president she will eat him alive. I always said she has to be the VP, can't wait to come back to travel in the US under Biden/Harris leadership.
When people said Joe Biden had chosen Bran as his VP, I thought they meant bran, not Bran. I think mine is way funnier.
which is the majority. All of the things Obama did for lower &amp; middle class communities Biden played a role in that &amp; Trump went in office and tried to reverse all of it. Obamacare for example.
I get that but I feel like people putting too much energy into why folks shouldn’t vote for Biden/Harris when we literally have a full blown racist narcissistic criminal in office...like I get her point but what is the purpose
The Supreme Court seats alone are reason enough. Not a fan of Biden but y'all are asking a lot from Ruth Bader Ginsburg if Trump wins again. The SC could be what sets us back literal decades if he fills any more seats.
Of course you'd use this dumb meme, but let's make one thing clear. Trump doesn't need your vote to win, he won without it last time. Biden however, does need your vote. If you choose to throw it away by voting green, then you have assisted Trump. It's not hard to understand.
Why do republicans keep laying out more reasons to vote for Biden/Harris?

Yeah, if Biden/Kamala wins, a lot more democrats are going to be in house/senate. Some people aren't gonna like that tho lol, even though in my opinion it should be split down the middle but you know...(Virginia/New Jersey plan) 😂
You earned my respect and admiration long ago, Susan. It would be a comfort to see you rebuild the State Department that this administration has tried to dismantle. VP Biden, bet you've thought about this. Wherever you work to heal our country, I wish you well. #susan rice sos.
Don’t know about the Harris comment. Am aware of the latter. God bless America for these being the options. I’m still planning to vote 3rd party unless it looks like Biden has a shot at SC.
What's hilarious is that I WISH some of the stuff Republicans are saying about Biden/Harris were true. It would make me WAY more enthusiastic about a, frankly, out-of-touch ticket. And no one's even buying this line because everyone knows it's false. They're floundering hard.
i don’t like biden or kamala but i feel like if they don’t win our country is gonna turn into a totalitarian regime and i hate it
Well I don’t think Biden will piss off every country in the world so there’s that.
Both scenarios do suck. Would I rather have Biden? For now. Trump will fuck us up more. Maybe Biden will play it safe. Jorgensen doesn’t stand a chance. So it’s a fucked/fucked situation
My short list Biden could've chosen and still retained my vote:  1) Kamala Harris 2) "Tip" Harris 3) Keisha Lance Bottoms 4) Apple Bottom Jeans 5) The Boots with the Fur 6) Susan Rice 7) Rice-a-roni 8)Stacey Abrams 9) Stacy Adams 10) Abercrombie and/or Fitch  #BidenHarris2020

People are dying, the earth is dying and for 8 of the last 11 1/2 years Biden was in the White House. How will putting him back change anything?
unfortunately, if you want Trump out of office Biden/Harris is the only way. It sucks we’re forced to that decision but voting for independents is equivalent to voting for Trump even if the intention is pure.
Within minutes of the presumptive Democratic nominee's announcement Tuesday, false information was circulating on social media, claiming that Harris had called Biden a "racist" and that she is not eligible to be president.
You can’t even get your local council person who taught you in 8th grade to stop putting rails on street benches but somehow y’all are about to strongarm the Biden/Harris White House? Lol okay.
But go ahead and gripe about how Biden/Harris isn't "progressive" enough. 😠😠
You know she was selected to be Biden’s Vice President right? So that would make it BIDEN Vs Trump. 🤦🏿‍♂️
In short even if you hate Biden and Kamala they are rational enough to pick sound people for these positions
The silence after Biden asks if she’s ready to get to work - as Harris processes that she’s earned the spot on the ticket - gave me chills.
Obama ran on a hope and change platform. Even he didn’t get held accountable for crushing the public option, bailing out Wall Street, drone strikes, spying on citizens, beefing up the deportation machine, failing to prosecute killer cops.. Biden doesn’t even have a hope platform.
Biden like Pelosi claim they’re Catholic but they are both pro abortion - The Catholic Church has already refused Biden communion - this argument is null and void
Listen, it’s not my position or my argument. I’m just answering the question. I agree that Biden was not shoved down Dems’ throats the same way Hillary was in 2016.  That said, I can still entirely understand why this whole ticket is more than disappointing to the Left.
It's the combo. Biden bothers me on a lot of levels, and I was hoping he'd pick someone progressive (and a woman of color) as a VP. Instead, he picks Harris with her history of supporting corrupt cops and prisons. I think we need change and Biden/Harris isn't it, in my opinion.
"a man as electrifying as a dollop of mayonnaise." 🤣 Column: Biden picks Kamala Harris. Trump should dump Mike Pence and replace him with a yacht.
What’s really missing from this narrative is that essentially Harris and Biden didn’t really even differ on the issue she called him out on in the first place.
I think Biden can talk much more coherently than Trump. Just get a transcript of any of of his non prompter speeches. You can never figure out what he is saying. And Trump constantly has verbal gaffes. Trump is toxic, and needs to go. Biden at least has decades of experience.
Harris is not as far left as I want her to be, but ngl, seeing Ben Shapiro this triggered is a major selling point.  Same reason I want Biden to win tbh.  He won’t do m4a, but not having Trump in office will trigger Ben Shapiro types and that’s enough for me
Shit... Biden just fucking handed Trump the presidency.

another ad idea: Biden chose a California liberal as his running mate. Is this the future you want for America? Put up image of riots and Kamala stating her support for defunding the police. They support taking your guns, your right to protect yourself and your family.
Also remember that there’s no right now to get enough people to mobilize to vote in a third party so while both Biden and Harris have done things we don’t condone we need to at least get trump out of office and then we can take on the other battles.
I wonder if Mike Pence can feel confident that the POTUS will not drop him in favor of Haley as his new running mate so that he can trump the Biden/Harris ticket? I wouldn’t be surprised if Pence gets the axe. After all that is the POTUS’ style.
I’ve been a little out of touch lately, but serious, non hostile, curious question: why do you object to this ticket? Is it Harris or Biden or the combo?
Is this a joke about Biden's likelihood to die?
Black folks voted for Biden because he is the best choice to beat Trump. Harris's record will be an asset. Not a liability.
i'm only voting for biden/harris because more fedsoc supreme court justices appointed by trump will further eviscerate voting rights and make this process even less representative of the will of the people than it already is. i'm still going to complain the whole time.
Biden didn't pick Kamala, he was picked for her. He was made the nominee when it was clear she would never win on her own merits.
Now attack her not Biden. She's the target.
You're right. Biden better watch his back. But I think he'll be talked into retirement within 6 months if elected. Then she'll pick Michelle Obama as VP.
Mine is how the media had a big launch event &amp; the CA party moved the primary, all so she could have an unassailable lead &amp; be the presumptive nominee by Super Tuesday. But she was so unpopular they had to fix the primary for Biden and install her as VP instead.
Still too many hardcore trump supporters bro I don’t see Biden winning at all especially if he starts talking

Joe Biden please know that Kamala Harris won’t help win over black votes sorry but that game plan just old in the books now... people not stupid or blind to the schemes of politics but it’s good thing I guess but foolish as well
If I had to guess I think people are more mad at having to settle for Biden than her. Because that’s definitely a settle.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again - I’d vote for Tulsi over Biden 😂🤷🏻‍♂️
This team will bring real leadership to our nation. One of the biggest threats to our children's education is the current health crisis. I look forward to the strong direction the Biden/Harris Team will create within public education, providing a safe place to learn and grow.

Oh cause I thought someone who didn’t vote last term said something about me voting for Biden this term.
Some conservatives are so fake. To them, it was smart that Trump picked Pence to appeal to conservatives. But supposedly Biden is racist for picking Harris. to appeal to black women. BOTH are the base of each party.

So therefore I will be voting for Biden and Kamala. They don’t have the best track record but they are 1000x times better than Donald Trump. Trump is single handidly destroying America. He must be voted out! Him and his trump staff has to go IMMEDIATELY
I don’t trust Biden or Kamala. Both have been on the side of destroying black families over the course of their political careers. HOWEVER! This election isn’t about who is the best candidate it’s about who will save us from complete and utter destruction of this country...
Too close to call, Supreme Court pulls a King Solomon with the country which Biden wins because he's too confused to understand what's happening.
To be clear: Joe Biden was/is boo boo, but nobody disputes that.
So Kamala believes Biden's sexual assault victims but is okay accepting his pick as his VP? How can socialists not see the hypocrisy?
I swear if Donald gets re-elected bc y’all don’t like Joe Biden’s VP I’m dead ass moving fr this time
Good on you for that! Respect. Also, I get the feeling it’s 4 years for Biden and then Kamala gets to run in 2024. Unless someone else blows up. But I’m thinking she’ll get the nod if she does a good job at VP.
Biden had to be a running mate that could be the heir apparent for 2024. Under these circumstances, I don't see how he could've chose differently.  I guess I'll turn in my Left Twitter card now.
How can any thoughtful Democrat vote for the Biden/Harris ticket? #MAGA2020
I’m voting Biden and Harris easiest choice
If Biden wins there will magically be a Covid vaccine out of no where and all the credit will be given to Biden. We just need to make it to November 3rd. The left will do anything to get Trump out even killing thousands of people and shutting down the country bc of a "pandemic".
Lol we have the NY Times calling her a pragmatic moderate. Senators Cornyn &amp; Graham calling her fully in on "the progressive/liberal left."  Just like w/ Biden, they don't know how to frame her. If you're on the defense w/ a muddled message you lose. GOP will lose.
I still haven't gone to the Biden-Harris store yet. Need to tonight.
Also ask her if she still believes Biden is a racist
That was the point Scooby Doo  Didn’t your pappy literally just say that Biden was running as a “transition”.  That he was going to get someone in the door and have a seat.   It’s like you’re stupid or something.
She’s not black. Biden and Kamala just released their slogan!  Kneepads and Peepads 2020!
It’s a Biden/Harris 2020 for me dog
Kamala Harris stated she believes Joe Biden’s accusers and took the VP position anyway........
This story needs to be told more often. Biden world is a loyal bunch. Always has been.
Lindsey Graham and swing state GOP senators are livid. A Biden-Harris ticket absolutely helps candidates like Jaime Harrison and other downballot races in South Carolina, and I'm sure in many similar ones.
Democrats: “the confederacy lost the civil war. Get over it.” Also democrats: “Biden didn’t pick [person], so I’m out.”
Before the end of the week they'll be saying,  "OK. Sure. Biden can't actually be pushed Left, but Kamala...'' #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
Very interesting that I got integrated by Tweeter after posting a mild response to Biden’s VP pick. They now know I have a postgraduate degree and can think for myself. I don’t care about having followers and only support LEO and conservatives. Guessing I’m about to loose some.
Actually you know what my one take is that I’m homophobic against gay politicians and I’m glad Joe Biden is too
It did not take the last of hiding racists long to come out of the closet after Biden's announcement today. Whelp. I'd rather know who my enemies are.
There it is. The vacuity of the Biden Harris pitch laid bare: Trump is even worse than Hitler. That's patently ridiculous, but it is funny that Trump will ultimately be blamed for all of this.  Serves him right too.
What's so bad about four more months of... *squints*  ...could literally be Biden/Hit... oh.     Welp, I'm ready to diminish and go into the west now.

Well besides Joe Biden fucking up Apple doing a 4-1 stock split
All of this is happening because Biden won the deep red state of South Carolina with the help of Big Pharma Jim Clyburn
Now I need my BIDEN HARRIS sticker.... website has nothing!
I answered your question. You haven't answered mine. Do you believe Biden's accusers?
Sure. Why not? Trump being a creep doesn't make Biden not a creep, though. You seem to be assuming that pointing out Biden's sexual assault/harassment makes me pro-Trump. I'm actually pro-non-rapey-candidates.

What blows my mind about Kamala Harris:  ran on a platform attacking Joe Biden &amp; seemed to embrace Bernie.  She ran out of $ and dropped out.  Cozied up to Biden &amp; the old DNC to keep her political career ($$) going.  She's not Left, she's as establishment as you can get.
And Kamala Harris called Biden a racist in the debates. What’s your point again?
Congratulations to Senator Kamala Harris for being selected as the Democratic VP choice by Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden! Historical moment! I am all in and ready for the moment!!…
what if biden tried to hire pence out from under trump like katy perry did with taylor swift’s backup dancers
For those that don’t like Kamala &amp; keep saying “Didn’t she lock up black people?” ...ok. So I guess Trump releasing tear gas on black people who are peacefully protesting is better? Listen. Like Biden/Kamala or not, but At this point, you gotta pick your poison bro. Vote or gtfoh
I’d love if the Press covered Biden picking Harris more than Trump’s obvious attempt to steal the headlines with recycled outrageous lies.
But of course and Blotus just said the same thing about Obama Biden. Very stale
The first journalist who gets to interview   needs to ask her if she still believes Biden's accuser(s).
If you’re not ready to support Biden/Harris 150% then gtfo here. 👋🏼
I am starting to think I will live to see a woman win the Presidency in my lifetime now. I thought Hillary would but it would be close and that did not happen. Now I honestly think I’ll see it one day. A win here for Biden/Harris would be a major leap forward towards that.
If she comes in toward the very end (or Biden makes it) you're gonna have Pete/Beto/Klob/Warren all climbing back out of the woodwork, plus whoever fills the Bernie void and the party definitely doesn't want that.
Joe Biden should have picked Tulsi Gabbard. Id be closer to voting her as the incumbent president than I am for Kamala Harris.  If Dems that say "defend the police" know what they are talking about they won't support Harris.
Nia-Malika Henderson just shut down David Gregory , telling him he is mistaken in saying that Biden made a “safe” choice is choosing Sen. Harris.
Watching folks who paid lip service to “abolish the police” a mere TWO MONTHS AGO praise Joe Biden’s VP selection of Kamala Harris (the literal “top cop” as former AG)....I’m pouring myself another glass of wine. WHAT. IS. HAPPENING.
Definitely not voting for Joe Biden when he chooses Kamala Harris as his VP. Say good bye to your gun rights. Fuck that
Joe Biden is the one who didn't make a pandemic worse with bad leadership.U guys no Biden lied &amp; plagiarized his way thru college &amp; was kicked out of his 1st bid for President due to plagiarism &amp; lies. The man never could tell the truth. He keeps getting caught &amp; just shrugs it off. Go on YouTube &amp; look up his apologies from first &amp; 2nd runs! 😂
We all knew she would pop up. When Biden goes diwn she will worn her wsy in
If that means that "racist" America is gone forever then I'm definitely voting for Biden and Harris. Racist America is so unattractive. I like inclusive America much better. #BidenHarris2020
How long did Joe Biden answer questions?                ANSWER: 0 minutes
Biden doesn't even know what's going on. Hasn't taken press Qs in months. He is running for Pres at the same age as when Reagan left office.
I volunteered hard for Pete from last July until the day of our SC primaries... And I'd love to see him as UN Ambassador. Great place for him in a Biden administration.
Moped rally for BIden in Danville Va?

Exactly. Biden is doing what he needs to win. Just like Trump. IDK how you can shit on Biden for this when Trump has been actively trying to destroy this election for years.
If you support Trump, you don't really get to clutch your pearls over anything. Fuuuuuck Biden but fuuuuuck people acting like they care about civility or decency.
I think this is really a thing. There are a lot of people that don’t want to admit that they support him, fearing the blowback. If you’re a Biden supporter, don’t underestimate the Trump supporters
Biden is elected during the Democratic Primary as choice for Presidential Candidate. He has chosen, not ppls choice, Harris as VP running mate. WHAT HAPPENS IF BIDEN IS UNABLE TO FULFILL HIS BID FOR PRESIDENT &amp; they need another candidate? Harris isn’t public choice no where near
Besides the fact that they just endorsed Biden for president
As Joe Biden says. "Its not about your rights. Its about your responsibility" well I say IT IS about being LIED to and tricked by the politicians that this was serious and now we see IT IS ALL LIES NO masks Not Ever

This is not the time to keep your heels dug in. Even if Biden/Harris are also a one term administration, we MUST vote out trump in 2020. He's doing everything he can to destroy our democracy.
Didn’t you just say Biden’s VP pick was important to you, will dictate your vote, etc? Still technically “undecided,” aren’t you? It is so weird how you keep finding excuses to *not* vote for the Democrat. Such an amazing coincidence!
Trump as a racist. It’s called race baiting &amp; we all know how the media and Democrats use the race card to destroy people.  The hypocrisy of the media is they give Biden a pass on all of his inarticulate racist statements but with Trump they bend the facts to claim he’s a racist.
this is the country as of July 31st based on contributions as reported by law for the qtr. Anyone who says Biden is leading is lying. He collected more $ for that qtr but Trump, the RED of course, covers the country!
Biden has lied &amp; plagerized his way thru life, College &amp; every single campaign! How does he keep getting elected? These older women so desperate one kiss from him make their life worthwhile? He admits to the lies &amp; plagiarism! And still, they vote for the sleaze he is! How &amp; Why?
I have looong worried about HRC &amp; thought they may try to slip her in as VP. I believe they realized she is very unpopular &amp; they felt the need for the token Black woman, which is wrong to say, do, and they still failed; which doesn’t surprise me it’s Biden’s handlers; not smart!
Yeah but Biden did not have to bring the 1994 Crime Bill to the senate floor being that the Democratic Party control the Senate before the 1994 Republican revolution. Biden could of change his mind.

Love you buddy.  Biden will get out debates by contacting Covid at Dem convention. Basement ventilator shots. Kamala by his side. TV visits from Obama and Hillary. Med records confidential. How low can rep. go. Making fun of a sick man!
Hey love you brother.  I just figured out how Biden will get out debate. Catches covid at dem convention. Candlelight vigils with televised visits from Hillary Obama ets. Basement ventilator shots. HOw low can republicans go! Making fun of a sick man.
Joe Biden will give his acceptance speech at the nationally televised Democratic Convention next Thursday. Who else thinks Trump will try to steal Joe's thunder by dropping Pence from the ticket an hour before air time?
Riiiiiiight....... vote early before they debate and Biden shows everyone what a Dementiacrat he really is.
On the Dem side, "Fops for Biden."
Joins Twitter in 2020 as a Trumplican but claims to be a moderate Dem in profile.  So when did the Party move too left? Biden? You can’t possibly pretendTrump is a moderate Dem. So why still claim to be a Dem?
Of course. Like Obama, Biden will open the US Treasury (which is full of taxpayer money) to bail out his corrupt union bosses. Democrats are all about the grift.
I believe (rightly or wrongly) that Biden will do more to try and bring us together whereas I believe Trump will continue to throw fuel on the hate and divide fire. I am just one person, but that is what this election comes down to for me.
His country needs him to endorse Biden. I hope he steps up and does the right thing.

I'm proud to be a "Nasty Woman"  who lives in the suburbs; will vote for Biden/Harris and will promote justice.
1-2% and forecasted that for foreseeable future Obama Biden- false statement  Trumps numbers were much better but paused for the pandemic- taking off again well beyond 2%
Lol I been saying this id a while tho. Trump cs biden is like choosing to get hit by a bus or car

Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
So many people from the black community are heated, which makes no sense to me. I'm all for Kamala and I know team Biden/Harris are getting my vote
And like you say, those we get in will have a better chance to affect change in a Biden/Harris administration.
No, but this isn’t the first questionable candidate. She will sink her own ship. No need for useless distractions which will end with zero action. It only makes conservations look desperate, we are not. Biden/Harris ticket is no competition. Voter fraud is!
Joe Biden and the Great Leaders of 2020 Are Part of a Club
Biden has said that if he wins the election, he will direct the Justice Department to “do everything in its power” to block state laws that place any restriction on abortion, including parental notification requirements, ultrasound laws,  waiting periods.

‘Greatest threat to civil rights we’ve ever seen’: pro-life leaders react to Biden’s VP pick Kamala Harris | News | LifeSite
It stopped working today.  I tried it yesterday and it went to the official Joe Biden page.
Does anyone believe the Biden campaign, or any campaign, would select someone with any ... even the slightest ... concern with their citizenship?  These claims are simply lazy claims for clicks and to goad the rabble.
WTF are you talking about?!  We want to see Trump mop the floor with Biden.
Rudy don’t rule yourself out from prosecution too, your criminal ways with the #OrangeSnowflake. Slanderous remarks to Vice President Biden.
1. This is insanely hilarious! Not cause of his joke but to as corny!  2. I dont care if Biden was walking, I aint voting for this asshole.
Shhh... Don't let DNC Conv. delegates know they would garner many more popular votes, if they reversed the ticket to HARRIS-BIDEN.
Their salaries are driven by the ratings they command. If they got paid less the 💰 would not be diverted to a rent assistance plan.      We all decide whether to watch or not. After - God Willing - Biden/Harris win I will watch less cuz Joe is not really my “type” either.
“Noooo you have to vote for Biden racist ass” -everybody quoting this man tweet
“The American people are living on the edge of death and economic despair...The press must look past the campaign coverage that was and embrace its role as a safeguard of democracy...not merely the horse race of candidates for high office.”
WHY KAM wasn't walking a respectful 1-step behind BIDEN??
. in a nutshell: - Ban everything from plastic straws, to fracking, and "assault weapons" by EO - Free HC and edu to illegal immigrants. - 70% tax rates - Does not believe sexual harrassment accusers - Lock you up for weed then laugh  If Biden wins, you get this.
That’s why it struck a w/ 45 nerve when Biden chose her.
The Biden campaign is going to be completely nuts?   And the Trump campaign with a dead guy stumping for him is...?
You realize you're voting for kamala, not biden right? He won't live to see 2024 at the rate he is declining
I will admit to getting goosebumps over the video of Joe Biden on Zoom asking Kamala Harris if "she was ready to go to work". It's time for all of us to get to work.
Check the wording on these tweets:     So is Biden planning on stepping down the day after inauguration? Or at the party that night?
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
You would want Biden not to have to debate. What  a hypocrite you are! Do everyone a favor and stop calling yourself a Republican. You sir are no conservative. Man up and change parties. Be honest for once!
DUMB AND DUMBER...  #kyla #KamalaHarris #biden #trump
Mr. Biden, it's awful nice for you to pitch in... but President Trump didn't even need your help with winning his second term.
Also interesting how you tacitly agree that Biden at least doesn't mind if I die due to crushing medical debt

Yeah. Vote Biden/Harris. That's all.
At least play after Nov 3. Because we all know this virus will be non existent after then especially if Biden Wins!!!!!🤮
😂😂 Biden avoiding everything right before the convention is hilarious.
To be clear, this is a play for the far left who sees Biden as just as bad as Trump. They are looking for every excuse to stay home.

3) Some might disagree, but I think the only way forward is to have a series of deep investigations into Trump’s misdeeds and then Biden pardon him in a somber address to the country.
I’m going to write to President Biden and ask him to: 1) Proclaim a National Day of Bi-Partisan Unity with events and parties that set aside differences. 2) Launch a national program to educate people on our founding principles and why the Bill of Rights are important

Kamala Harris was one of Obama's henchmen. There is no conflict that Jill Biden can't machiavelli around. The power struggle is on! Jill versus Kamala. I warned y'all this was going to happen.
SHE DID NOT ANSWER the question. Laughing it off is not an answer.   Deep down, she hates Joe Biden and will do anything to be POTUS at this point in time.

On top of that... there’s really nothing concrete for her to apologize for. To my knowledge, she never actually voted for or pushed through any legislation in Congress that negatively impacts LGBT people. Biden, Hillary, etc. cannot say the same.
video is not out of context, it has his whole sentence. you liberals are the out of context kings. still hold on to the fine people quote out of context. biden repeated it yesterday.
Did he not stop all flights from China in January or was Biden just condemning him for it just for attention? Can democratic run cities not think and plan for themselves?
I guess if you want to say anything for Joe Biden, it’s that he never pretended to be a progressive. He’s awful, but he’s been consistent, and he never pretended to be someone who he is not. You can’t say that for his runningmate.
This Biden would be electric
They assume anyone left of center is an automatic Biden vote and are wilfully ignorant to any criticism of their "team." It's like arguing with a brick wall, except the brick wall doesn't have a block button or call you a Russian bot
Just cooked up this sick Biden edit on face app
First if he is truly a republican he would not be voting for Biden who wants America to become a socialist country. Second anyone can say they are a republican or Democrat on video. Where is his voter registration card that list his party afflicate? These videos never show that

This was a bizarre piece. A few things: 1. It’s weird to point out that Biden repeated third grade? The man is 77 years old! 2. The pod Bros represent the online but not rabid left. I’ve heard mild criticism of the Biden campaign but never of Joe directly? Am I missing something?

Biden’s the only man in DC whose been friends with both Bernie Sanders &amp; Strom Thurmond. Gave Thurmond’s eulogy, and might have been ST only real friend in DC.
Yes. BO having a sense of his being a ‘golden child’ was really evident. It’s a problem with younger leaders who never really failed. Biden has failed at things. That could help him.

“He’s the first Democratic nominee since Walter Mondale in 1984 not to have an Ivy League degree.” That’s really a problem we need to address as a party. The elitism in our politics. As well as representation without substance. It’s not progress.

Focus on the ECONOMY!!!! If you don’t the socialists WILL WIN THE PRESIDENCY!!!!  Stop arguing w/scum media! Crush the domestic terrorists! Repeat the fact that Harris will be the President since Biden isn’t capable! Destroy their records! A Biden presidency is Obama’s 3rd term!!
Why are you are crying to see Beto talk? if he not let it be , Again if he does not talk what are you going to do on Nov 3, 2020? stop the ignorance and Cry like you and a lot like you did on 2016 and be for real now  It is not abut Beto Talk, It is about Biden defeat Trump!
Both Biden and Harris are going to love this, because it will give them an excuse to not talk about actual policies. It gives them something else to talk about, and gets them off the hook from answering tough questions. We can’t let that happen. This is a distraction.

Do you agree with Joe Biden's call for a national mask mandate?
I’m not okay with any of it, I know most people are voting for the lesser of two evils + I understand/support that. Personally I can’t co-sign Biden. We still got some time tho.
I think I'm gonna vote Biden/Harris just in hopes that they win and the slow creeping breakdown of our society takes a nose dive into the deep end of an empty pool and we can live in anarchy for a bit.

Had the same reaction after that debate. That braying laugh and extreme rudeness to every question. Talking over Ryan. Learned nothing from the debate but that Biden is a jerk.
This is totally awesome for Biden, because he would much rather talk about these “attacks,” than actual issues where he must take a position, like healthcare. He will eat this up.
Really? Even Trump and Biden don't take it personally. It's just business to them.
Remember when they tried to impeach him over a personal spat, and let all the much worse things slide.  All I could think at the time was, "Why are they dedicating time to this? It's not like Biden is a real candidate."

Not true. CNN was covering Biden during the presser today, and I usually have to switch to Fox to see the pressers until the questions start. I’ve seen CNN turn away from earlier pressers as soon as they turned into campaign speeches. If you were watching CNN you’d know this.
I sure don’t agree with a lot of Maher’s leftist and atheistic views, but the POTUS should learn how to take the highroad and be an example, not unprofessionally bash and insult people publicly.  He’s just not fit for the office. I’m voting for Joe Biden.
Biden said black people all think the same way.  :)  You are voting for him so don't tell me you got a problem with his sentiment if I agree with it  for satire.

Shouting "Biden is your only choice," is not the hopeful message you think it is.
A lot of black people think Trump is racist because of what Democrat politicians and their friendly media say.   Biden said black people are a monolith and all think the same way on politics.  I was just mentioning some stuff you might not have heard.   Take care.
These are very important points. I also think it would be legit for Biden To come out and say, “hey, we did the best we could at the time. But looking back on it, it was misguided, and it didn’t work well, and it did real harm,” but that’s not his position. He stands by it.

Joe Biden has been been the go to speaker at every segregationist funeral the past 40 years.   That's part of the reason Kamala Harris called him a racist in the Democratic primary debates.
Harris makes case against Trump in first speech as Biden's running mate
Did you know Biden has praised and spoke at the funeral of several segregationists to include Robert Byrd and  Fritz Hollings.  Byrd was one of the senators that filibustered the civil rights act.
Watch them change when Biden is president.
trump has turned back the clock on so many issues. Climate, healthcare, poverty, civil rights, immigration and much more. And it gets worse every day.  If Biden did nothing but stop the bleeding, that alone would be a win, would be reason enough to end the trump reign.

Obama &amp; Biden!
The difference between Biden’s racism and Donald’s is that Donald is intentionally appealing to the racism in our countries heart. Biden just can’t keep himself from saying what’s in his heart. Both are bad. One is worse.
Obv Kamala has problematic history, but she’s also got the energy and the teeth to balance out Biden’s age and geniality.  She gives their ticket a much-needed injection of adrenaline.
Not only can Joe Biden read and speak coherently, he knows how to sit in a chair.

Biden trolling Trump is my favorite thing today.
No. It is not. Not even close. It has NEVER been like this.  The trump position is far-right authoritarianism. Democracy won't survive another term.  Compared to trump, Biden is a big shift to the left. Not as far left as we'd like, but Biden WILL fix a lot that trump won't.
Is Kamala Harris eligible to be Joe Biden's VP?
Flat out false,  Biden's lying. Trump never said that. So when will you censor his Twitter account? Or are you just a lying political hack posing as a CEO?
Wow, thought it was a joke but definitely sends you to a Biden campaign site!
That’s a really good point.  I would like to see Biden choose some of the Republicans that have put country over party for members of his cabinet.  A good mix of progressives and conservatives would go a long way to showing the country that we need to move forward as one.
This start look like when Obama and Biden ran for POTUS &amp; VP in 2016!
LIVE NOW: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak for the first time since Biden named the California senator has his vice-presidential running mate for the 2020 White House race.
Ma'am, you think that Trump is a better choice than Biden. What you think of his running mate is as relevant as my thoughts on whether Trump should dump Pence for Haley or not.
This start look like when Obama &amp; Biden ran on 2016!Not going to happen.  Biden will win
I would LOVE to see this. If Biden refuses to debate,  AKA #BatMaam, should be allowed to debate Trump.
Delaware is playing an unexpected role in the White House campaign as the pandemic keeps Democrat Joe Biden away from traditional campaigning and close to home in Wilmington.
Anyone who votes for Biden is insane at an obvious power grab to take away your freedom. He's absolutely pure evil.
I am so so sorry you are going through this and I am so glad you said what you said too. It’s a damn shame. Biden/Harris 2020
None of his traipsing around the stage either. If he steps out of his box when he's not on camera he loses. Biden could handle that kind of requirement. Donaldo couldn't handle it for more than 10 seconds. Also, drug testing for the candidates prior to the debate. Same deal.
No Biden can't say anything much about Camala as Biden says doesn't care because she's pure evil!
Grrrrr. I loathe Biden/Harris get out the popcorn!
Justice will come when Biden/Harris win in November.
I spent 7 weeks in Le Bonheur Children's Hosp. &amp; had to repeat 8th grade. It happens. As for Biden ... his speech impediment alone could've resulted in the repeat. But the guy overcame that, attended Syracuse Law School. He holds a Juris-Doctorate. That tells me he's a smart man!
You failed at making America Great at containing the Covid-19 Virus, so its no wonder Postal Workers Union supports  Biden/Harris!  🤠
A vote for Kanye is a vote for trump you idiots 😂 joe Biden may not be the best candidate but he sure as hell is better than the orange fuck in office

Former VP Biden leads Pres. Trump 45-44 in the latest poll released by the conservative Civitas Institute. The poll was conducted in the days before Biden announced Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate and has a margin of error of +/-4 points.
All we hear from you is what will happen if Biden is elected. I have not heard what you would do if your re-elected. What would your major task be?
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews

Even Bin Laden in 2011 knew Biden as president would cause American crisis.  Interesting that  didn't want Obama to take out Bin Laden 🤔 almost like he knew their plans.
Democrats are close to matching, if not surpassing, the massive $300 million cash stockpile President Donald Trump and Republicans reported in July.
“She’s up to the task and that’s what I’m looking forward to,” Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) said Tuesday.
Biden and Harris are well versed in the art of lying. I'm praying America doesn't fall for the deception. #MAGA
Y’all fools for wanting to vote biden just bc he got kamala as his running mate. Just look at their track records.
Sounds like something Biden would say.
Thankful to be on a call today with Josh Dickson,  national faith engagement director, and other women across the country. The campaign listened to our thoughts as Christian women and told us we were heard and valued. This is the Prez I want.
I figured the Biden/Harris news would have you in a better mood.
Joe Biden made his first joint appearance Wednesday with his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris Wednesday:
Biden is quite the liar
It's raining heavy in my town. Hopefully it's washing away the  blinders the people have on who are supporting Biden and Harris!
"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware"
Based on  tweets today, this is his re-election strategy:  Tell black people “Biden is a racist, vote for me!“  Tell white people “I am a racist, vote for me!“
I am disappointed it should have been you Mrs Bottom. Nonetheless I am a true blue Democrat so I will be voting for Biden but it still should have you.
The only way that happens is if the Biden vote is split between the Dems, the two minor parties, and Kanye. I suppose it's within the realm of possibility, but it's extremely unlikely.  That's not to say the Biden vote won't be split. I think it will. But not enough for 45 states
Damn. 45 states. Which do you think Biden wins?
is designed to depress the African-American vote for Biden and subject us all to Trump again.
those same people would be saying Biden dissed African-American voters by passing over Harris. Everything they are doing (see Jared meeting with Kanye last weekend, limiting polling places, attacks on mail-in voting, voter ID) ...
So the right's opening attack line on Harris is that she is not really "African-American" because that term means having ancestors who lived under slavery (this would disqualify Obama, too). Keep in mind that if Biden had picked Elizabeth Warren or Gretchen Whitmer, ...
He shouldn't have been. Trump is never on script Biden is mocked for using a SCRIPT during his call to Kamala Harris
I hate the phrase “lesser of two evils” but that’s really what it boils down to. Nothing Trump has done in the last four years makes me comfortable enough to say “we might as well let him win again.” Hell no. Biden and Harris aren’t JFK but it’s progress!!!
Yay! Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris to appear together today
Don't believe anything that he says.  Trump claims suburban housewife will vote for him in new Biden attack
People like this allowed to vote. God help us all. They understand it’s Biden who never leaves his bunker correct?
"I mean, the one thing you cannot say about Joe is that he’s a racist...I mean, he got into politics because of his commitment to civil rights. And then to be elected with Barack Obama, and then someone is saying, you know, YOU'RE A RACIST?” - Jill Biden  Regarding
A LOT OF YALL TRYNA VOTE FOR BIDEN AND KALAMA BECAUSE HE BACKED UP OBAMA AND SHE BLACK......BRUH SHE DONT EVEN IDENTIFY HERSELF AS BLACK. HE HAS HAD A LONG HISTORY OF RACISM YALL NEED TO SOME RESEARCH THATS ALL IMA SAY... CAUSE SOME OF Y’ALL JUST FOLLOWING
EYE ON THE DAY:  - Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate  - Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences postpone fall football games  - The last remaining Blockbuster goes on Airbnb
Pres. Trump was asked about Joe Biden's VP pick, Sen. Kamala Harris. Trump said, "...we’ll see how she works out. She did very, very poorly in the primaries..." and that he was "a little surprised that he picked her."
Idk how explain it to me. To me your statement implies if Jesus wouldn’t vote for trump he would vote for Biden. I personally believe it’d be neither and that’s what I’m sitting on. I just know many democrats don’t respect the faith and it shows with simple research.
Then vote for Biden. If people don’t vote it will be the same thing again and we will have him in office
You know for once you are correct. Vote Biden/Harris
Will Biden’s bike have training wheels?
Biden and Bimbo 2020!
#OnNovember3rd2020, we will have a woman as VP-elect if Joe Biden wins.
I wonder what she smells like...  -Joe Biden
Trump will become a one-term president on January 20, 2021 if Joe Biden wins #OnNovember3rd2020.
I wonder what she smells like  ~Joe Biden
No clue. She's just as corrupt and evil as the rest and has flipped on her opinion of Biden. So she is an enemy of this country too .
Is it just me or does it seem strange that the speaker lineup for DMC doesn't include Joe Biden but his wife?
Really love that the Biden VP announcement photo on the FB post I saw from his campaign is him ZOOMING with Kamala. #2020yall
She is just as bad as Biden, a liar and a fraud and will not be happy until this country is like Venezuela or like Stalin's Russia. 😡
Biden is already weaponizing her attacks as AG on white collar criminals  Centrists have already thought several steps ahead of you on this one unfortunately
I do know for a fact that tons of Republicans (all Boomers+) in my vicinity said they'll vote for Biden over Trump (but never Sanders), so this choice is clearly strategic. I hope we'll just age into an era where anti-capitalist notions are, like, actually politically viable.
Who else is over the moon excited about our VP pick? #KamalaHarris2020
She's a train wreck just like Biden. She has that Socialism ideology like Biden. Personally I don't think she can lead a rat out of a bag!
She's apparently a socialist like Biden
Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as Running Mate 👍👍👍👍
Biden picked her because he think black folks think alike, “hey here’s a black woman, let’s pick her”
Joe Biden has announced California Sen. Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate for the 2020 election.
Biden just picked his VP. Or better put someone picked his VP Kamala Harris. Talk about racist! Picked based on gender and skin color not qualifications 🤨
Joe Biden has picked California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate for the 2020 presidential election.
BREAKING NEWS! Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate, setting aside tensions from primary
Um...so not true!  Trump says Americans will have to learn Chinese if Biden wins
Cool..can't wait!  Joe Biden selects his running mate with announcement coming as early as today
Trump confuses the two world wars and it blows up but Biden says all black people are the same and nothing happens.   God what a world.
Trump is a Nationalist peddling Fascism -- just like Hitler. Trump's followers are buying into this ideology. Yet, historically, America has fought Nationalism &amp; Fascism for over a century. Democracy is at stake in 2020. THIS IS WHY REAL REPUBLICANS SUPPORT BIDEN!
The survival of this nation &amp; democracy lies with Joe Biden. I'm a lifelong Republican &amp; I believe it. His VP pick WON'T change my mind!
Your description of Biden is very accurate! I agree that Jill should not be putting Mr Dementia in front of the cameras....I call that elder abuse!
I have one thing to say we shouldn’t have a hard to finding Hiding Biden
I just hope they don’t go and vote there social security away. Now that would be a tragedy. Biden/Bottoms

I would love to see Biden announce not just his VP choice, but multiple top cabinet position nominees as well. And I think that should include at least some of the people considered for VP who don’t get the nod.
Trump talks the talk. Biden walks the walk.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said on Sunday that if he’s elected, his administration would stop a proposed copper and gold mine in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region.
Way to go! Destroying the 2 most popular federal government programs is sure to ensure soon to be President Biden's win in November.
He just tweeted about Biden a few minutes ago. He's just not worth listening to
Former Vice President Joe Biden would enact a number of policies that would raise taxes, including individual income taxes and payroll taxes, on high-income individuals with income above $400,000.
Seems weird that Biden is already putting up a female of color VP, and they don’t think that in itself isn’t racist. Affirmative action in action. Wondering how NY and other cities put signs on roads w/o permits. No one wants to sue.
Betting Biden camp will find every excuse for no Debates. He will be a disaster. Even if elected, he owes too much to Leftist. Incompetent. If he doesn’t debate, we should kick him out then.
Without cohesion many Senators will get beat. Weird that I still think silent majority with a crummy Biden might pull it off yet. Can you imagine Trump with a Dem Congress? Many people won’t admit they like him and the way he fights for ordinary people.
Biden  is a Chinese Plant
You lying weasel! You did not mention that China is backing Sleepy Joe Biden!!! I swear as long as I live I will NEVER vote for another DEMOCRAT!!
Nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, that Biden has or could do can match up the outright pure corruption by Trump and GOP.    The only reason to support Trump is because he makes you feel like your horrible traits are acceptable now. Trump makes it ok to be a sexist, racist pig
is joe biden turning into an edge lord
Biden is expected to announce his running mate before the Democratic National Convention, which is now just a little over a week away.
The Presidential Stock Market Direction will be determined by who enters the White House. The "WHY  &amp; HOW" is clear...  The recent MMT implies that a Presidential Stock Market Direction win by Biden will prove to be a complete joke.
I took some time to not soak myself in social media for a few days as my anxiety was through the roof and I see I came back to SSDD.  Trump is a moron and lying, we're getting too cocky that Biden will win, we need to remember how it went down 4 years ago. He'll try to steal itBiden is like the guy who thinks he is entitled to the job because of his connections.  Americans want someone who is willing to work his ass off for the job and prove to us why we should hire him.  That’s why we hired Trump.  He worked his tail off for us.
with Biden saying he would serve only one term,  it is possible this country getting what it's needed, and long overdue, a female of color as president #MadamPresidentHarris

This has already happened.   In October 2019, Biden attended Mass at St. Anthony Catholic Church in Florence,  SC.  The pastor, Fr. Robert Morey, declined to give him communion. Several bishops later said they would not have denied him communion. (But Fr. Morey is not young.)
That don’t mean anything.  I am catholic and would never support Biden.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
Trump wants America to have whites with money only neighborhoods. Like his country clubs. Except not too much money, so they're not like his country clubs. He is a racist and elitist. Even tho Biden isn't a good alternative, I'm still going all in on Biden just to get Trump out!
Isn't Biden a Catholic though? Even went to Catholic school.
You are a bigger joke than Biden is. You were a horrible DA, AG, and you would be an awful VP, which will not happen.
she’s right that’s why 18-24 yr olds will vote for biden
We need to find out who is controlling the democrat party....I think the tech giants....as Biden and Harris are both empty vessels that will do whatever they’re told.
This isn’t a protest vote. It’s a vote for the polices Joe Biden (and Trump) is against. We’re here change, not whatever scare tactics the Democrats come up with to surpress voters. #Freetochoose
Something told me Biden would pick Kamala Harris as his running mate, I just really hoped I was wrong.  She weakens his campaign, in my opinion, and increases the likelihood of Trump being re-elected (especially if he dumps Pence for Nikki “where’s my popcorn” Haley.
My sweet hubs will confirm that YOU were my choice for PRESIDENT from the minute I watched your announcement. I am beyond thrilled that you have been chosen to be Biden’s VP choice.
😂🤣 and Biden will be sooo much better
I can't stand Trump, but I dont like Biden either so I ain't voting for neither one of em.
Biden chose Harris for #VPPick  simply because he knows "Mother" won't allow Pence on the debate stage with a woman.
Biden goes with the least surprising, and probably safest pick.
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
I hope Biden's VP is Rep. Val Demings. She has the background to lead a nationwide #DeFascistizeThePolice initiative, as a former police chief in Orlando, Fl. #BidenDemings2020 can remove racist cops as the domestic terrorists they are. I'll support Biden's choice, no matter who!
You said competent while referring to Joe Biden. I have clearly stepped into an episode of The Twilight Zone.

Biden to stay in hiding as long as possible
Yes, Russia is helping Biden - even devil woman Pelosi agrees  - the devil woman does nothing but actions trying to hurt America
LOL - Russia, Iran, Syria, China all lives do nothing Biden
So in retrospect....I feel kind....given the political climate of things....would/ should we suspect the DNC / Joe Biden concluding with China?
I said that Biden was a t-totaler, too.
Biden doesn’t drink. He had a fake beer at the beer summit
Pelosi is devil woman, China already owns Biden
Trump is honest, Biden is extremely corrupt
Russian bots are getting crushed by their own masters', Trump's &amp; Putin's, incompetence. They hate Biden so dutifully. No wonder they're so full of duty!
I finally agree with schitthead. We need to subpoena Obama, Biden and everyone who worked under the Obama cluster fuck of a sham government that is seeking to take away everyone’s freedom and replace it with socialism, AKA Russian government. It’s the dems, not the republicans!
good morning frat, I’m trying to find out about the comments that Joe Biden supposedly said about blacks and diversity.  Maybe you can shed some light on this matter, didn’t hear exactly what he said.
I think President Trump will get a record high % of the Black vote.   Joe Biden takes black voters for granted
Biden is one dumb person
You’re right we are doomed (if Biden gets in). If you had half a brain you’d know it wasn’t a hoax. You manipulate the issue to fit your narrative. It’s so unappealing, like Nancy Pelosi.
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
The blueprints for Black self-determination and ultimately liberation are being worked on in spaces Biden will never access. Let him talk. We're about our work. #BlackAugust
Biden's ignorance doesn't deserve that energy. African Americans know that Blackness is not a monolith. That we are a diverse and remarkable people. We have nothing to prove.
I could remind y'all of how Biden's ignorant and disrespectful comment seeks to divide Black and Latinx voters. A tactic that's old and tired.
I could waste my time talking about how Joe Biden's most recent statement about Black voters is just the kind of stupidity you'd expect from a misogynist racist.Source Claims Barack Obama Told Officials That Joe Biden Might &amp;#8220;F**k Things Up&amp;#8221; Regarding 2020

The  needs to sit her drunken  down in drunk tank and sober her up. She's threatening a former Vice President, w/o really saying straight out. Sound likes something the mob boss would do, amirite, JP?
Shirley Chisholm gave Hillary the inspiration. I love my fellow Scorpian  Hillary though bcz she is real. Voting Biden/Harris and 🙏🙏🙏 for the Blue Tsunami  needed.
How strange, that it takes zero seconds of actual journalism to prove these cases biased and wrong, but we still have no disculpatory evidence for Biden not shoving his fingers in a young woman's vagina. And yes, I'll say it like that, because that's what he did.
Aight so I understand a lot of folks are against Biden &amp; Kamala.. but I know for a fact it can’t be as bad as 4 more years of the clown.
"If and when"..... I knew that was their plan all along... Biden gets elected then resigns and Harris is the first woman President. Its sad we live in a world where people are hired to a position because of their race or gender and not their performance.
Val Demings is not done! I’m sure Biden has a cabinet position for her when the time comes.
*Spoiler alert* I was voting for Joe Biden anyway #LesserOfTwoEvils #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor
These debates....can't  wait for the blow out pence will receive. Hope Biden can hold on to his temper with pumpkinhead bcz I can hear the cuss words flowing....in my mind.  These will be exciting  to watch...this time.
Just his hypothetical  thought. Biden could ask Susan to be Att'y General or any of the other Black females bcz they will go after pumpkinhead too.
I think as a gay black man I won’t have to fear for my rights under a Biden/Harris administration versus a Trump/Pence administration. I trust one to properly replace Bader Ginsberg, and the other I don’t.
This hack was even on the team with Biden and was in total support of what Joe did.  is a worthless, cowardly, spineless piece of Russian 💩.
I was worried Biden was gonna mess this one up. Glad he made the right choice
#BidenHarris2020-Hell to the fucqing yeah. I'm happy, but I would've still vote #Biden2020 no matter who he chose. Right now I happy bc I am fucqing sick of Trump not taking this #COVID19 serious. I've buried too many fam and friend from this pandemic.
Mrs Krassenstein puppets are near you. If Biden had strings it couldn’t be plainer. The Left wants a weak executive branch so they can keep picking the Pockets of the American People.
Who’s gonna give Biden’s speech if he wins? Hell he can’t spell his name much less give a speech.
I feel the same as you express. Joe Biden is incompetent. The Democrats ohave been busy trying to Ring in  Bernie Sanders tainted supporters. And keep the Black and Hispanic votes by picking a candidate for him. Please vote GOP straight ticket. Leave the Phony DEMOCRATS!!!!
Bye man you are lost. The media has duped YOU. At least I know Biden ain’t shit
Y’all crazy man if y’all don’t think that man racist. But insist Biden is. It’s political to y’all. I don’t believe in parties. None of them good. Trump is a narcissist ego manic who is about self and a racist prideful biget who said just grab women by the pussy.
Did u see what he said about John Lewis. I’m not voting for nobody that said grabbing women by the pussy is ok. Miss me with that done more for the black community bull. It’s funny you can see all the racist stuff Biden has done and I agree with you but won’t acknowledge trump.
Yea they think we actually like Biden bruh. I be telling them lesser of two evils.
A ‘Savage’ huh? does Cruel and vicious hostile describe you. Sounds like you don’t think about what you say and your loyalty can shift with your mood. Remember Biden has many many links with China. Calm down.
Democrats are desperate to hide the Biden family corruption in Ukraine ... and in China
Joe Biden is really into heavy petting a la 1954
Yes the American Care Act has been in force since Obama &amp; Biden got it passed. Plagiarizing  won't  make it "pumpkinhead care"...OBAMACARE IS THE ACA...FOOL
When is Vice President Biden going to make a decision about his running mate?  Why is there such a prolonged delay? Don’t  insult the most loyal sector of the Democratic Party because this might come back to bite you.  #2020ElectionAnd yet they outnumber Biden signs 100 to one.
Explain the violent atrocities of the left. Explain the corruption of Obama, Comey, Biden, Clinton, Pelosi, Schiff, Nadler, Swalwell, Mueller, Soros, Gates, BLM, Antifa, Mainstream News Media AND Hollywood Pedophiles.
There will be a few votes for Biden...
Your trying to defund the police department. Who the fuck did you think they were going in endorse?  Democrats, " Police should vote Biden and help end the police department" fucking Joke
Biden’s basement ops/area.....
First amendment, Baby. So unwilling to bow to the media "rules" from Dem elites. She's not untouchable, nor is Biden's dementia. No "pass" given to either of them under some protected status. Honesty in government demands open dialogue.
Sad. Useful idiots everywhere. Only reason Biden is running is that he was the basis for the impeachment scam. The Dems said Trump was threatened by his candidacy so had to get some "dirt" to help him win. Yeah, right! 😂🤣🤯
Anyone else watch Biden speaking during the signing of their official acceptance of their nomination? Biden mumbled and stumbled terribly. He truly is #DementiaJoe, IMHO.
Why Has Biden Hired 600 Lawyers?
Only reason I'm gonna vote for Biden is because Trump isn't the only one causing problems. We need a dem in office to put a stop to McConnells machinations. The only reason Barr and McConnell do all they do is because they have a president and base who allow it.
I keep hearing from ppl around me that Biden is gonna win now. Wrong! #Trump2020Landslide
Were they elected, Harris would declare the Biden incompetent per 25th amendment and take over quickly. Her agenda is even worse that Bernie's. Communism expedited.
Her personal story about the relationship with Beau Biden was an obvious work of fiction. Her delivery had subtle signs  that she wasn't quite comfortable with the narrative. Total phony, IMO. Trump nailed that moniker.
Biden is nothing but a sock puppet for his handlers. He'll say anything they write for him. The President doesn't have the power to do that. The audacity of a candidate acting like he has the power is simply absurd.
Nope. The Biden admin is going to be a half step to the left of the Obama admin. Which didn't even go for a public option, did almost nothing on gun control, didn't defund/abolish police, didn't support gay marriage until the 2nd term etc etc etc. You won't be in a camp by 2022.
Joe Exotic would have been a better president than Trump or Biden.
No way Florida’s gonna vote for Biden.#TrumpWinsFlorida
Let’s be real,it’s Trump,Biden doesn’t know what office he I running for half the time,and his running mate is a American Indian one day the next day a black woman,these people must think people are idiots,lol.
No way Biden is ahead by this much in California. I know it’s a Democratic state, but jeez. This seems manipulated!
Joy Biden did not select Sen Harris on merit, race or sex. He selected her based on sexual affairs rumors. She is an Evita Perone.

You are the globalist AND the socialist, Biden supporter and troll.
In a joint conference with vp candidate senator k.Harris; candidate Joe Biden wants to make mask wearing mandatory. Sen k Harris apparently is a psycho mess. She afraid to walk into a shower of sneezes, ahems, coughs and spitting. KH needs to see a schrink.
. selects US   as his vice president candidate.  Now, we're getting reaction from both sides of the fence and reflecting back on her visit to #RockHill last year.
He knows what he doin.
Me when I first saw the Biden/Harris ticket lol
Biden Rally’s be like....
I forgot how terrible she is at connecting sincerely with the audience. It came back to me watching her try to be convincing, but there was no conviction behind her words. Electing Biden would make Kamala president. Horrible thought!
Only those people who have incredibly short memories. History shows they do the opposite. Look at Obama/Biden record. But those who believe their slogans and platitudes may vote for #DementiaJoe, believing his "build better" slogan. Completely absurd, IMO.
Yeah I hate the “settle for Biden” Bernie Bro’s get on my nerves but at the end of the day, moderates and progressives are on the same side. I wish Biden would have got in early in 2016 but I really think Beau’s death knocked him down for a while. Have you read “Promise Me, Dad”?
Maybe this is an unpopular opinion but I like Biden a lot. He’s a great guy with an amazing personal life journey. He’s got a ton of experience which is what we are gonna need and I think he realizes he’s gonna be a one term president and Kamala will take over in 2024.
Joe Biden is the Presidential Candidate not Sen. Harris but be clear, your attacks on either will not go unanswered. It’s either America or Trump. You picking Trump? Or is it you don’t want to see a black woman where you think you should be first?
I think the key here really is a Jamie Harrison victory more than a Biden victory in this state. Getting rid of Graham is really important.
How can you tell when Kamala is lying? Her mouth is moving. This whole Beau Biden story is clearly contrived. Very disappointed in whoever wrote this fiction for her to perform  this looks like the clunky part that required additional rehearsal, IMO.
Probably right when say affecting the president's press briefing. How much money is Jamaica or India donating to Biden?
OH my. We're back to fine people on both sides. This speech by Biden is too long for him. He's losing focus.
Joe Biden’s speech cadence is upsettingly bad though.
I just found out from Talk show host Brett Winter I'll that I.S. Senator Harris does not like Catholics. I wonder if Joe Biden knows this. I have to research this since Democratic party is centered around Catholicism.
SouthPark- DoYouSee  via  Biden’s initiation process with Kamala
Kamala to Biden....”Do you See”
If you want another 4 years of trump over Biden that’s fine but don’t get mad bc I don’t agree 🤷🏽‍♀️
Donald Trump’s FIRST STEP Act freed more Biden-imprisoned black Americans from jail than Kamala Harris improperly kept in prison for the free prison space labor.
I am considered a "suburban housewife."  I will not be voting for you.  I am appalled you ended AFFH.  I hope Biden will reinstate it.
I think Biden will only serve one term due to his age.
Biden was threatned and told to pick a black woman, you don't know what you are talking about.
Biden is already removable from office based on Amendment 25. Harris can declare that immediately upon getting elected, then pick her own VP. Can't let these communists win in November! #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020
Biden can’t even say five words without forgetting what he’s talking about. So basically you’re voting for Kamala.
Exactly. This is hardly unprecedented. Look at Reagan &amp; Bush in 1980 or Obama &amp; Biden in 2008. People are always trying to stir shit up.
I understand that Harris has a past but her record against Pence's is stellar.   Yes, she made mistakes but I guarantee you if a white male with Harris' track record had been tapped for VP by Biden, I wouldn't have seen a single *insert white male name* is a cop tweets.
Biden Harris do the trick!

Can I get a #BidenHarris quarter-zip on the Biden Merch store please when y'all have some time &lt;3
Biden really brought on Harris as his VP after she trashed him and called him a racist all over the debate stage. What a cuck.
How can accessory to infanticide, violating  Scripture, massive corruption and lying, just to name a few, be in any way Christian?  Like all Democrite pols, Biden is demonic and in no way Christian. You don't get to write your own gospel or make your own god!
He blocked me because I told him to stop using abortion as his crutch to not support Joe Biden versus voting for Trump again. He’s shameless in his what aboutism.
I wasn’t going to do this, but kiddo is asking me to check twitter every 5 minutes for veep news.   How do I get that “first to know” text message from the Biden campaign? “Text blah blah to #####?”   I know someone here can tell me.

Racist commune? GTFOH. Only racist i see is Biden, BLM, and Antifa
This is how the 2020 election will turn out. Trump is going to absolutely crush Biden and company! #1984election #Trump2020LandslideVictory
I did understand the best candidate for Biden vp was senator k. Harris. That won't happen because senator Harris wants AG job. Best vp bet is Susan Rice.
Current mood: frustrated. *Biden voice* C’MON MAN!
the question Joe Biden will have to answer is the question of why black women are good enough to be the backbone of the Democratic Party but not good enough to lead this Nation. He better have a damn good answer the backlash against the mention of Whitmer shows.
Well I guess I’ll stop advocating for her then because Joe Biden was always my first choice for President.
"Joe Biden attacks Donald Trump for 'shameful' claim he is 'against God' | US elections 2020 | The Guardian"  This partly true. The aim is for Democrats to exclude other religions. Like Chief Justice did last week to exclude other Christians religions.
Joe Biden – The Cardboard Cutout Candidate  Once again, Dr. Joondeph hits the nail squarely on its head.
Just so y'all know  . God Loves Joe Biden and the Democrats MORE than you, Devil Don. As it is written, the wicked Shall be severed from the Just. And the Just Shall remain. Enjoy the 🔥. It's ALL about Righteousness.
The many lies of fmr vp Joe Biden was talked about on radio. Biden claimed he has 3 degrees, he only has one Delaware! Biden claimed he graduated top of class, when he actually finished bottom 3rd Delaware. Why is Deleware a state where ignorant people move can't do the research?
Never forget mother's of sons in military. Your son's or daughters will be a compromise to a Joe Biden Administration. Who will print me a Bumper sticker to that knowing?????
President Trump needs to investigate matter before any further with drawals from Afghanisn. Biden is the Voltare of Earth of Battle star Gallacticca' game.
The concern is that these Afghanistan soldiers should have been questioned. Or an investigation of more missing details . Joe Biden is like the character on 'Battlestar Gallacticca', --Voltare. Who betrayed to the Ceylons.
Keep telling yourself that black women don’t care if Joe  Biden picks a white woman. Representation matters! Governor Whitmer has a city that still doesn’t have clean water. We haven’t forgotten Flint.
This should be enough to defeat Joe Biden for ever becoming president. Biden betrayed seal team 6 and he will betray U.S. to China. That is bumper Number sticker news.
Didn’t they spend the entire primary attacking Biden?
It's Biden's campaign team that thinks that way. He just says whatever they write for him to say. #DementiaJoe barely knows where he is from moment to moment.
No no no! You bring on Vernon Jones to talk about his support of Trump and his racism and he starts attacking Joe Biden. You must not let him do that cut that crap off like  did.
Biden would fail a competency test, IMO. He couldn't even pass #TheClockDrawingTest for dementia. Wait for the bait and switch at the virtual convention. Dems pin their hopes on mail-in ballots triggering the 20th amendment clause for Congress to appoint a president.
I saw a debate on this on my timeline and the actual report does not explicitly mention the grand canyon AFAIK. It was Biden's response that did.  Not that I think reopening Uranium mines in that region is going to go over well anyways.
They might work for wealthy celebs. There is a sexual market for young children. Now, Biden gets his child meat from China.
It’s a shame Admiral James Stockdale passed 15 years ago.   I would *love* to see him on a debate stage between Trump and Biden.
Biden got to be about more than the y’all in this ad.
I don’t want her as a surrogate. She is THE pick for Vice President. This need to make her second fiddle to a white woman as VP by some folk are truthfully pissing me off. Biden says he wants to be a bridge, Kamala should be on the other side. The future of Democrats is brown.
Virginia mayor urged to resign after allegedly saying Joe Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima' as his VP - CNN
Were Biden to get "elected", we wouldn't recognize our country in 4 years. What took Venezuela 20 years, Biden would accomplish in only 4, IMHO.
One debate. That's all it will take to see how incompetent Biden is to do any job, let alone President of the United States! #BidenDebate #DementiaJoe needs to come out of the basement.
Why are you behaving as if these black women are not as qualified to be Joe Biden’s VP pick as a white woman? Why are you putting these women against each other at all?
China wants Biden to win. There, satisfied?😉
never misses an opportunity to allow anyone on his show to trash Joe Biden just like he did with a Hillary. So glad I just keep going when he’s on .
Ain’t that the same girl that was pushing the Tara Reade bullshit against Biden.
I truly hope there is something a President Biden can do for him. This is appalling.Let's do the same for Joe Biden and see how long that lasts!  #Bidensfuneral!
Democrats didn't select a change candidate they wanted Biden. Pretty sure the status quo is safe.
Hey  did ya know your daughter backs Biden/Harris 2020?
Vote for Biden. You would be crazy not to!
Kamala Harris divides blacks: One-third diss pick, now 'less likely' to vote for Biden
Nancy could be VP in Nov if Biden is elected and then moves on to a nursing home. Harris in charge of US armed forces? Piten will no doubt be filling in some mail in ballots this year!
You think Trump will get the blame for this? 😂😂😂 Hes the one wanting everything to open and to play football. Biden is saying you keep everything closed.
The only reason Kamala accepted going for VP is because she is DESPERATELY hoping that Biden can’t serve out his term and she gets to takeover even though her campaign failed misersbly and no one likes her.
You are Biden’s target audience.....he loves them dumb. 😂 Masks are extremely minimally helpful in slowing the spread. Hand washing, social distancing, eating healthy, taking vitamins, all much more important. Trump doesn’t wear a mask tho....so that’s all we will talk about.
The Wendy's ad "WHERE'S THE BEEF?"  Could also double as an ad about Biden and Kamala!
I've got plenty. It's all documented at my blog.  But apparently you can't read so why should I waste my time explaining it to you?  Besides, you don't really care if Biden is corrupt or a racist or abuses women so why bother?
I also reminded  yesterday that his daughter is backing Biden/Harris 2020 ticket!!
Would Joe Biden last 4 years as president? C'mon man!
Did anybody else think that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s speech today was very communist feeling? They were in a building where no one had access to them the only people in the room with the media? Looks like we’re looking at a dictatorship talking from a place of power
The Biden/Harris Covid presser (minus questions, of course) shows us what this country will be like if they win - mandates &amp; regulations, to name just a few.

I feel like the person who runs Biden’s twitter account does more harm than good to him. This is a proven lie which has been fact checked as false. Who do they hope to convince? All Dems had to do to beat Trump is purpose a centrist plan and be competent....they can’t do it.

Biden should have picked  Big old giant mistake. She’s the only dem I can think of that could pull moderates and even repubs away from the right side.
Biden might have stood a chance in the coming election if he had picked this woman as his running mate!
People better wake up because this is what the whole United States will end up like if Biden/ Kamala gets elected. Is this what everyone wants???
Reaction pours in for Harris as Biden’s historic VP pick  via
Odds that Pence brings up the fact she sucked Willie Brown’s dick to get her start in politics is going off in Vegas at 5:1. It’s odd Biden picked someone who called him a racist sexual predator.
President Trump told reporters that Sen. Harris “was very disrespectful to Joe Biden” during the Democratic primaries, and said “it’s hard to pick somebody that’s that disrespectful.”
No, obviously it is YOU who doesn't have a clue.  I would help you out but I've learned it's a waste of time.  If you don't know about Biden's crimes, pay attention. You're about to find out.
Biden Seals His Fate and Ultimate Defeat With Selection of Failed Primary Challenger Kamala Harris
Democratic ticket...What’s sad are the Catholics they have had. Those ones have been pathetic pro-abortion Catholics.    By the way ... Biden says he’s catholic.
Let me make this totally clear if Biden had chosen a rose bush as veep I’d have voted for him but I am so proud Kamala Harris is his choice &amp; whether you guys realize this or not the Vice President generally runs for president after his term is expired
Doesn’t matter that’s joes choice and mine. Biden/Harris
Love her! So excited for this addition. Biden/ Harris 2020!
BREAKING: Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
Wonder his thoughts on Biden telling a church full of black people that Romney “wants to put you all back in chains”. 😂 Guessing he was pretty quite about moral superiority back then
Well Charles, we had MULTIPLE congressional investigations with HOURS of testimony from Don. Jr. and other Trump associates UNDER OATH plus investigation w/ dozens of FBI agents, lawyers under a Special Prosecutor.   Result? No evidence of any crime.  Where's Biden investigation?
If Biden is a gaffe machine Trump is a gaffe tornado.
It's a hail Mary pass for Biden
Trump's failures LITERALLY killed Americans. I'll take my chances with Biden
If  wasn’t actively trying to help Biden, then yes, Twitter would remove it. However since he’s a dickless coward with no morals or integrity, no he won’t be removing it.
Biden’s own DOJ found that Brown tried taking the officer’s gun and the shooting was justified. He puts out these pandering tweets with the hope black people forget what he really thinks of them. “Poor kids are just as smart as white kids”- Joe Biden
No one has ever accused Biden of being anything other than moderate, status quo establishment dude.
Pelosi and Biden BOTH need to take a cognitive test.  They're totally whacked!
People are holding Biden to a different standard which in normal circumstances would be fine but after the 3.5 year Trump and Republican shit show I don't care who Biden picks.
Bernie, you're a close second to join Biden in the dementia ward.  Obviously the elevator doesn't make it to the top floor anymore.  Now go enjoy all those MILLIONS your wife siphoned from your campaign!
So many REAL issues out there and you are running around in a golf cart making goat videos?  No wonder your network is in trouble.  Why don't you roll over to Biden's house.  Make sure to take your drug test first.  You write like a junkie!

Biden is good for the market as it runs on stability. The 6% or 8% corporate tax increase if there is one hurts less than 4 more years of chaos.
I haven't seen any Trump supporters rioting or looting. Have you?  I haven't seen any Trump supporters beating anyone up for wearing a Biden hat.  And I haven't seen any Trump supporters giving the power salute.  You're not fooling anyone but yourself!
Calling Biden racist is sort of lame. Facts are racist nowadays...
Shifty----can you document Trump's increase/decrease in wealth since taking office, and then compare it to Obama or Biden?  Please make it public when you do.
We need Biden to win in a landslide.
According to a new Emerson poll, of those who plan to vote in person, Trump leads 65-32. Biden leads with those who intend to vote by mail, 76-20.

Joe  Biden doesn’t need any assistance denigrating himself.
It’s trump or Biden.  That’s it.  Period.  End of freaking discussion.  I don’t care if he picks a can of beans.Lara Trump: Everyone knows when Joe Biden takes the stage with President Trump it's going to be game over.
So among a million jack a$$ nonsence from Trumpy to have a mini rally near Biden’s home town the night of Biden acceptance of his nomination takes the “I’m a petty vindictive fool cake”. In a election there needs to be two people and if tRump has nothing to hide, let people vote.
Postal Workers Union endorsed Biden/Harris...so there you go.
Hum....didn't  Biden represent Delaware in the Senate from 1973 to 2009?  In Masseys, Delaware people are showing love for President Trump on foot and by boat. 🇺🇸
Biden was the VP of the self proclaimed "most transparent administration" for 8 years.  The most transparent admin known for jailing journalists, using government institutions to attack political opponents, arming drug cartels, drone striking weddings, spying on Trump's campaign.
Obama kept Biden on a short leash for eight years while he was in office. He knows how incompetent he is.
It's about national security. Biden would welcome the chinese hackers.
Give $ to Democrats up and down the ballot. From Biden to local council races.
And by moral character you mean 40+ years of documented overt racism right?  This Biden guy sure is everything you want him to be.
TRUTH  This man has some choice words for Biden.
Since  has no problem going after his predecessor (Obama),  I think Pres. Biden's Justice Department should hold Trump accountable for every single crime that Trump commits.
In my opinion, he got killed after his attack on Biden. He insulted him right to his face and Democrats rejected him.
So you can lie to the FISA courts, Obama/Biden admin can use the FBI to play dirty cop, wiretap a political opponent, and use foreign help to hurt your political opponents campaign and Barr thinks its best to let illegal activity be brought out after the election? He better not.
So all of these Black bourgeois folks telling you that they will hold Biden-Kamala accountable are just using buzzwords. They won’t be in the streets. They weren’t in the streets during the uprising under Trump, what makes you think they will be when their party is elected?
Once again Biden and Kamala won't  answer questions. The reporters get pushed out.   If the press quit covering and showing their events until they answer questions I guarantee you that will change.
When Biden and Kamala finally answer reporters questions who really believes the reporters will ask hard questions like "Joe why were you trying to take down a political opponent, General Flynn, while you were Vice President?
The first of many in the Obama/Biden administrations wiretapping and lying to FISA courts  Fox news: Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith will plead guilty to making a false statement in U.S. Attorney John Durham's review of the Russia investigation.
That’s true but Biden will get ALL the dead voters, the ballot harvest or voters and the vast of the main in voters! They don’t post signs!
Liberal Hacks: 🖕Ralph Nader, he's a spoiler that gave us Bush/Cheney  Also Liberal Hacks: -Leave Ellen &amp; Bush alone! -Bush gave Michelle candy &amp; they hugged🥰 -Amazing painter Bush is doing immigrant portraits now😍 -Biden awards Bush Liberty Medal, calls Cheney a "decent man"
The Dem mayors and governor’s! What do you think a Dem Pres Biden will do? What ever he’s told!
Maybe she can be Biden’s “Monica”!!
These liberals have lost their minds. What is the Democrats plan. We are already wearing masks. Do they think that Joe Biden could have brought the private sector together to find a cure for this virus?
Exactly! He closed the country…even though Biden thought we should leave it open. Trump is the reason the death toll has stayed low. Remember H1N1? As many as 89.3 million cases. 5 million China virus cases. Looks like OUR great President Trump has done well!
Ask Joe Biden about getting arrested in South Africa. Ask Joe Biden about what position he graduated in his class. Biden is the consummate liar in this election. But news media gives free passes to Dems. Hypocrisy in action every day. People with a brain see through it all.
Joe Biden plagiarized Ronald Reagan's speech from a Reagan-Bush campaign rally on September 3, 1984:  Biden: “We can define America simply in one word: “Possibilities.” Possibilities. Let me say it again; possibilities. That’s America.”
When I see Biden and Kamala I see two people who know something is up and them being President and vice president  isn't it. Somethings off. Zero enthusiasm. Kamala isn't into it.
Biden doesn't have a clue.
Getting ready for the big dance when Biden/Harris take over!!
Biden hasn't done anything but get payed for 43 years on Government.  He should be ashamed of himself.
Of course Fox polls has Kamala ahead of Pence. Crazy considering she was just chosen yesterday.   Every channel you turn on including FOX all you hear is bad man Trump and great man Biden.  don't even fact check the stupid sh*t Kamala says like about Ebola and so on.....
Why doesn't Joe Biden mandate the democratic governors to stop the rioting and looting in their states? The Democrats are turning states into shitholes.
Biden and Kamala left their briefing without answering questions after they suggested that we should have a national mandate for wearing masks for 3 months.  Chickensh*ts
So we have to hear Biden say that we need to wear a mask.... old news Joe and Kamala Harris!  Biden says it is a must that we institute a National mandate to wear a mask....  OUR STATE IS OUR BUSINESS JOE!
Biden tried to give himself and Obama credit for the Israel and UAE peace agreement...except it was Obama/Biden  helping Iran and it was Obama/Biden meddling in Israel's election to try to get Netanyahu defeated.
Always trying to take credit 4 years later.  Biden said he was glad to hear about Israel and UAE peace agreement and then threw in how they worked off of what he and Obama had already started.
Why people are leaving religion in droves. Deservedly so!   Trump-loving Catholic Priest accuses Biden-Harris supporters of wanting ‘terrorists’ and ‘bloodshed’ -
Fox news: Twitter will be clamping down on mail-in-ballot "misinformation" as Biden's misinformation campaign ads stay up.   Fair and bias?
It actually made it worse however I know Biden had little or nothing to do with the decision! He is owned by Soros so his handlers made the decision!
This headline tells you everything you need to know about #BidenHarris.  #WallStreet's exhaling bc they know "#NothingWillFundamentallyChange"&amp; neither Biden nor Harris will prosecute them when they crash the economy again. Just ask Mnuchin, am I right Kamala? #MBNABiden #Copmala

This is not a surprise at all.  Stay focused Mr. President and let your record of achievements speak. Your administration has accomplished more in 3 years, to help Americans, than Biden / Harris have done in more than 50+ years in public office. Don't get distracted by the bs.
Lol You’re just mad they’re not for Biden and Harris

We struggle every day. Biden/Harris 2020
Does Biden want to defund the police?
Wait is  a “reporter” or member of Biden’s campaign? #FAKENEWS
Pandering? Biden putting Kamala on the ticket type of pandering?
Democrats don't want you to call Kamala/Biden names. Agree.   Now when will their 5 yrs. of constant name calling of President Trump and Melania stop? When will slandering  and  stop? When will reporters stop the bias? When will they show POTUS respect?
🐿🙉🙄🌊🤡 Why have these daily briefing where tRump says the same thing over and over, I can,I am, blah, blah, blah. Also, why doesn’t journalists ask Trump if he is sending his son or grandkids to school 🤔 He was a fool to have a nutty 🥜press briefing after Biden/Harris day.
I'm Joe Biden
vote for biden so we can bully him for 4 years😎
Joe Biden proudly announced he's running for Vice President.   Text joe For-Vice-President 😄
After getting blistered by Biden and Harris the president comes out and says the same old shit. He better start telling America what he is going to do in the future or he's going to lose the presidency. America wants new ideas for the future.
me too that is why I thought of it!  I am scared Biden is going to take all I have.
Long read. But well done! Biden and Harris make first appearance together at a campaign event. #print
I'm waiting on the  to call out all of Kamala and Biden's lies. Instead geraldo's panting over Kamala's.....
I wonder how Hunter felt since Biden sounded like he had only one son Beau.
Sounds like Beau was Biden's only son 😂😂😂
Biden said Trump called pandemic a Hoax. WRONG Fact check 👇   Biden said Trump said very fine people ( Charlottesville) WRONG  Fact check 👇
Biden said Trumps administration put is in this hole. Trump wouldn't help assist states with COVID.  Fact check: China put America and 188 other countries in a hole. President Trump had hospitals built, sent a navy hospital ship, respirators and mask, tests, and a slew of money.
Joe Biden said Trump called Kamala nasty and mean towards his appointees.  FACT CHECK: Kamala's behavior was nasty and mean towards Biden (not an appointee) and Kavanaugh.
The Press has been in a gym inside their hula hoop circle waiting on Biden and  Harris to show up for almost 3 hours now.
Biden is too old, too wishy-washy.  Harris is too polarizing.  Who you voting for
Why is Biden/Harris 1 hour late to their event? It's not like they have a country to run or anything else to do. We have a basement dweller and Harris hasn't been on the job in a long time.
Listening to the news I thought to myself to ask any liberal if you had $500,000 in the bank or Stock market or wherever, who would you trust with your money more, Trump or Biden?
"We knew that Joe Biden’s vice-presidential pick wasn’t going to be an NRA member or a Second Amendment supporter."  #Ladsongunshop #summerville #goosecreek #charleston
BS! You’re just trying to cover up for Biden’s obvious diminished mental capacity! Joe can’t possibly hold it together for a 90 minute debate! Hell he can’t hold it together for 15 minutes with a teleprompter! Joe’s an incompetent moron and we all deserve to see it!
Fox news headline:  Trump repeatedly called Harris "nasty" except the video of his words says otherwise. The way she treated Kavanaugh and Joe Biden was nasty. HUGE difference!  Stop creating hate and division
Fake news from Fox news: They keep saying President Trump called Kamala Harris nasty. He said the way she treated Joe Biden was nasty. BIG DIFFERENCE
Biden should've picked Tulsi.
Biden has been in Politics 41 years... what has he done, please tell me
Criticizing a voter base that Biden doesn’t particularly attract, bold 🤐
The Snore/Whore ticket AKA Biden/Harris ticket will go down faster than Kamala on Willy Brown.
Kamala: I believe the women who accused Biden of sexual misconduct.  He is a pro-segregation racist! Biden: Kamala, will you be my runningmate? 🤦🏼‍♂️
Biden and Harris 2020 i guess 😔
As to your first point, I think the fact that he picked her even after she was an “aggressive attacker” shows Biden is an adult who can handle strong criticism. You don’t have a second point worth addressing.
Trump Attempted To Upstage Biden And Harris But CNN And MSNBC Ignored Him
I find it extremely tone deaf that the Democratic ticket is Joe Biden who doesn’t support weed legalization and Harris who has laughed about locking up drug offenders. Not to mention the party voted for it not to be part of their platform
Joe Biden's phone is upside down 🤦🏼‍♀️
So joe Biden chose the woman who put people away for years for smoking weed
Biden/Harris   The most Pro-abortion ticket ever. Sick.
you let the comb eater ( Amy Klobuchar) lie.  President Trump never called Kamala Harris nasty! He said the way she treated Joe Biden was nasty.
Didn't she call Joe Biden a racist?
Didn't Kamala Harris call Joe Biden a racist? What kind of ticket is this going to be. Vote  Democrats out in November.
Just be sure to check Biden’s comments before he gets on camera. 🤦🏾‍♀️  Congrats 🎉
Biden is removed and Kamala is our Potus
Remember when Kamala Harris said she believed Joe  Biden's accusers.
Kamala Harris is the VP pick for Biden
There is no doubt that  will have an important role in the Biden administration.   She is that good.
Joe Biden here. Big news: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate. Together, with you, we're going to beat Trump. Add your name to welcome her to the team:
Told you......Biden chose Kamala Harris
Joe Biden's "type" is Gretchen Whitmer, but he will be forced to pick Kamala.
Biden also knows that one foot goes in front of the other going down a ramp and he doesn't need assistance to do it.
Yeah! Like not having wasted the taxpayers time for the last 40+ years as a corrupt Washington politician doing absolutely nothing but enriching yourself and your family at the public’s expense!! That kind of wasting time Mr Biden????
Dems will remove Biden - insert VP
If Rice is the pick and Biden wins she'll be President soon after and will be able to make all of the evidence about Obama's corruption will disappear.
This says everything you need to know about Joe Biden.
Biden's a serial plagiarist. He just can't help himself because he's never had an original thought in his life.
Man, I can’t wait to vote for Joe Biden and every other Democrat on my ballot. You sir, are insane.
They say Trump lies. He has been eclipsed by this guy, even pre-dementia. Says A LOT about Biden. This needs to be in a Trump TV campaign ad. Nothing in the world worse than someone lying about their school credentials. Like a soldier wearing medals they didnt earn.
I don't think Biden is allowed in those meetings. He isn't the person making the decision on his VP pick.
Are they Biden's political advisors 😂😂😂😂. Sounds about right!
Bless your heart.  Speaking of bunkers, anyone seen Biden?
I am glad you posted this picture for Sleepy Joe Biden his touching is just plain creepy unlike the Pres who seems to be expressing mutual affection and party atmosphere for his girlfriend at the time?
Biden's religious community.
Dems like to complain about Russia interfering in our elections as they've spent years interfering in Israel's election.  Obama/Biden created  "V15" victory 2015 to oust Netanyahu and the incumbent government.  Obama/Biden used FBI to hurt our election.
I have never in my life wanted to be a "token" female and I don't respect any woman who let's herself be used for political purposes. The most qualified person should be Biden's VP pick!
Agree! It's not like Biden is gonna bring in the most corrupt and incompetent people he can find, like we have now.
Wrong - Biden approves of defunding police and gun confiscation.
Obama/Biden years.  U.S. Postal Service’s financial troubles have been well publicized for years. The worst of it came in 2012, when the USPS lost $15.9B dollars, followed by $4.8B and $5.3B in 2013 &amp;2014, respectively (Fortune)
Come on, double-standard journalists. Show some bravery and report the facts. Quit covering your ears in denial. What would you do if this was Trump trying to bamboozle Biden?
I guarantee you if Biden were to be asked about the details of what happened to Michael Brown and why he would go into that blank state he's so well known for!
President Trump's team are going to have a field day with the info they find on whomever Biden picks as his VP 😂😂😂
President Trump holds China accountable for it's actions. Biden and his cronies carry their water for them!
Biden has lost his fastball and if you don’t recognize this you are in denial. It would be like one saying you still have full head of hair.
So much bull, marking up things to air.  They can't say anything good about Biden.  Funny stuff.
You have to keep a watch on those dead set on Biden getting elected. It's obvious they're panicking.
Pelosi sounds like a babbling idiot just like Joe Biden. They both have been in government entirely to long and it shows. Vote Democrats out in November.
If ignoring policy, people should be asking how can Biden possibly pick anyone more corrupt, evil or incompetent than what we have now.
like i fucking hate biden, but my hate for a proto fascist far exceeds that. the party is becoming more progressive with each election, and the progressive wing is really good at forcing concession out of the centrist wing. we keep that up and we can bulldoze down future trumps
Wait a minute, (Biden) said you ain't black unless you vote for him,so I'm Cherokee Indian when will he promise to give our land back (Biden) maybe if we vote for him.lmao.
It takes a real journalist to stand up to the downward spiral of a racist running for president, Joe Biden.  A real journalist would find no need to ask a trash question after President Trump just signed an executive order to help Americans hurting financially.
Biden himself is bizzare!
Biden can't complete  sentence
Correction: Cutting #SocialSecurity and #Medicare isn't a *Republican idea. Joe Biden has tried cutting Social Security and Medicare aleast 5 times.. the most recent as Obama's VP, as part of the 'Grand Bargain'  We need #MedicareForAll!

Very much, as Biden is incompetent so VP will be our president quicker than you think
Bias media  Biden can mock President Trump's faith, but Trump can't mock his.
And it's been announced that Biden has picked a VP...........☝️
Biden lost already. He can't compete a sentence.
It really worries me that Michelle Obama is back in the news. I'm afraid Biden is going to make her his VP pick 😳
Is it just me or does anyone else start to worry when she comes out of hiding all of the sudden? I'm still afraid she will be Biden's VP pick!
Shouldn't matter what the Russia loving, corrupt, enabler party thinks now. Biden may not be world wisest but him and his pick will be less criminal and more competent than what we have now.
I do believe Hunter Biden had a problem with cocaine, yes. Interesting that Biden would even bring this up as an example.
Just like Biden.
JOE BIDEN IS THE ANTCHRIST
I bet Joe Biden throws out the name of his VP pick now to change the subject from his inappropriate comments about black folks all thinking the same.
Biden didn't call out anybody. He doesn't even know what year it is FFS. The guy has dementia. It's not funny,he's sick. It's going to be very obvious at the first debate. Biden doesn't know how to use a flip phone,much less twitter.
Biden's a placeholder for whomever his cronies decide either to be his VP pick or his replacement.U guys no Biden lied &amp; plagiarized his way thru college &amp; was kicked out of his 1st bid for President due to plagiarism &amp; lies. The man never could tell the truth. He keeps getting caught &amp; just shrugs it off. Go on YouTube &amp; look up his apologies from first &amp; 2nd runs! 😂
We all knew she would pop up. When Biden goes diwn she will worn her wsy in
If that means that "racist" America is gone forever then I'm definitely voting for Biden and Harris. Racist America is so unattractive. I like inclusive America much better. #BidenHarris2020
How long did Joe Biden answer questions?                ANSWER: 0 minutes
Funny how democratics keep denying that Biden is not of sound mind. If Biden was a republican &amp; forgot what he was saying everytime, not taking questions, using the word GAFFES instead of out right saying he is too old to be responsible for America everyone would have a field day
Biden doesn't even know what's going on. Hasn't taken press Qs in months. He is running for Pres at the same age as when Reagan left office.
I volunteered hard for Pete from last July until the day of our SC primaries... And I'd love to see him as UN Ambassador. Great place for him in a Biden administration.
Moped rally for BIden in Danville Va?
Biden would be a staunch conservative in most of Europe lmao
Exactly. Biden is doing what he needs to win. Just like Trump. IDK how you can shit on Biden for this when Trump has been actively trying to destroy this election for years.
If you support Trump, you don't really get to clutch your pearls over anything. Fuuuuuck Biden but fuuuuuck people acting like they care about civility or decency.
I’m surprised more woman are not pissed about the Biden’s claim to pick a woman but then it had to be a black woman. This is a slap in the face. He only did this to get votes. What if he would of said only a white woman? Woman with big boobs? Brown hair? It’s degrading and racist
I think this is really a thing. There are a lot of people that don’t want to admit that they support him, fearing the blowback. If you’re a Biden supporter, don’t underestimate the Trump supporters
Biden is elected during the Democratic Primary as choice for Presidential Candidate. He has chosen, not ppls choice, Harris as VP running mate. WHAT HAPPENS IF BIDEN IS UNABLE TO FULFILL HIS BID FOR PRESIDENT &amp; they need another candidate? Harris isn’t public choice no where near
Besides the fact that they just endorsed Biden for president
As Joe Biden says. "Its not about your rights. Its about your responsibility" well I say IT IS about being LIED to and tricked by the politicians that this was serious and now we see IT IS ALL LIES NO masks Not Ever

This is hilarious! Obama enacted a law went into effect March 1, 2013 requiring all Social Security be deposited electronically.  A contract to the Veterans Administration in 2014 to UPS to deliver drugs to Vets. Guess he’s forgetting like Joe Biden!

This is not the time to keep your heels dug in. Even if Biden/Harris are also a one term administration, we MUST vote out trump in 2020. He's doing everything he can to destroy our democracy.
What's the difference between  and a dead raccoon? #Biden wrote the crime bill which disproportionately incarcerated more of our black brothers and sisters than any time in history!
Didn’t you just say Biden’s VP pick was important to you, will dictate your vote, etc? Still technically “undecided,” aren’t you? It is so weird how you keep finding excuses to *not* vote for the Democrat. Such an amazing coincidence!
Trump as a racist. It’s called race baiting &amp; we all know how the media and Democrats use the race card to destroy people.  The hypocrisy of the media is they give Biden a pass on all of his inarticulate racist statements but with Trump they bend the facts to claim he’s a racist.
this is the country as of July 31st based on contributions as reported by law for the qtr. Anyone who says Biden is leading is lying. He collected more $ for that qtr but Trump, the RED of course, covers the country!
Biden has lied &amp; plagerized his way thru life, College &amp; every single campaign! How does he keep getting elected? These older women so desperate one kiss from him make their life worthwhile? He admits to the lies &amp; plagiarism! And still, they vote for the sleaze he is! How &amp; Why?
I have looong worried about HRC &amp; thought they may try to slip her in as VP. I believe they realized she is very unpopular &amp; they felt the need for the token Black woman, which is wrong to say, do, and they still failed; which doesn’t surprise me it’s Biden’s handlers; not smart!
Yeah but Biden did not have to bring the 1994 Crime Bill to the senate floor being that the Democratic Party control the Senate before the 1994 Republican revolution. Biden could of change his mind.
You’re joking, right? Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will save this country from falling into a dictatorship that the GOP enabled. We’re smarter than you think. November is coming and you can’t stop the blue wave with your lies.  #CorruptGOP #TruthMatters

Hey love you brother.  I just figured out how Biden will get out debate. Catches covid at dem convention. Candlelight vigils with televised visits from Hillary Obama ets. Basement ventilator shots. HOw low can republicans go! Making fun of a sick man.
Joe Biden will give his acceptance speech at the nationally televised Democratic Convention next Thursday. Who else thinks Trump will try to steal Joe's thunder by dropping Pence from the ticket an hour before air time?
Riiiiiiight....... vote early before they debate and Biden shows everyone what a Dementiacrat he really is.
On the Dem side, "Fops for Biden."
Joins Twitter in 2020 as a Trumplican but claims to be a moderate Dem in profile.  So when did the Party move too left? Biden? You can’t possibly pretendTrump is a moderate Dem. So why still claim to be a Dem?
Of course. Like Obama, Biden will open the US Treasury (which is full of taxpayer money) to bail out his corrupt union bosses. Democrats are all about the grift.
I believe (rightly or wrongly) that Biden will do more to try and bring us together whereas I believe Trump will continue to throw fuel on the hate and divide fire. I am just one person, but that is what this election comes down to for me.
His country needs him to endorse Biden. I hope he steps up and does the right thing.

The protests give me hope. I just wish more people would realize we'd have had the same protests under Biden, but he'd pretend to care but do absolutely nothing.
HOW can Dems feel good? Biden PLAGIARIZED &amp; LIED his way thru life, school &amp; campaigns! He barely graduated college is being used by the party &amp; his wife who should be ashamed of herself. He needs to go home, be cared 4, not allow ppl to make fun of his declining mental health!
A lot of us sacrificed our time, energy, &amp; money for him &amp; he didn't stand up to them. He didn't challenge Biden at all. In 2016, Trump used his base as leverage. "Vote for me or they walk." In 2020, Bernie could have but didn't. We would have walked into hell for him.

I never said he was a Marxist. I said the DNC has a Marxist problem, and they see Biden as a vessel.
I knew Biden was a racist! Not once today did he try to sniff Kamalas hair!
I was gobsmacked. She said, on air, that she doesn't think Biden will live to see Election Day? WTF
Also I think Biden loses AZ, GA, NC, OH, and probably FL, which would put Biden at 279 after he wins the usual states plus MI, MN, WI, and Penn
When I was watching Biden and Harris, I felt a sense of calm. Such a different feeling than when Trump is on tv.

I think this is really a thing. There are a lot of people that don’t want to admit that they support him, fearing the blowback. If you’re a Biden supporter, don’t underestimate the Trump supporters

Uncle Rudy is talking about accountability.  Must be Trump's/Russia's final hour to go after Biden.  DON'T fall for it.  #VoteBidenHarris2020
I've been asking, what is the top accomplishment of Joe Biden after nearly 50 years in public office? So far no one has tried to answer.
Love you buddy.  Biden will get out debates by contacting Covid at Dem convention. Basement ventilator shots. Kamala by his side. TV visits from Obama and Hillary. Med records confidential. How low can rep. go. Making fun of a sick man!
Hey love you brother.  I just figured out how Biden will get out debate. Catches covid at dem convention. Candlelight vigils with televised visits from Hillary Obama ets. Basement ventilator shots. HOw low can republicans go! Making fun of a sick man.
Joe Biden will give his acceptance speech at the nationally televised Democratic Convention next Thursday. Who else thinks Trump will try to steal Joe's thunder by dropping Pence from the ticket an hour before air time?
Riiiiiiight....... vote early before they debate and Biden shows everyone what a Dementiacrat he really is.
On the Dem side, "Fops for Biden."
Joins Twitter in 2020 as a Trumplican but claims to be a moderate Dem in profile.  So when did the Party move too left? Biden? You can’t possibly pretendTrump is a moderate Dem. So why still claim to be a Dem?
Of course. Like Obama, Biden will open the US Treasury (which is full of taxpayer money) to bail out his corrupt union bosses. Democrats are all about the grift.
I believe (rightly or wrongly) that Biden will do more to try and bring us together whereas I believe Trump will continue to throw fuel on the hate and divide fire. I am just one person, but that is what this election comes down to for me.
His country needs him to endorse Biden. I hope he steps up and does the right thing.

Opinion | A Biden-Harris ticket is Trump’s worst nightmare
This isn’t me falling in line either. I will fight tooth and nail to get progressive policies passed in a potential Biden administration. But to get there, the neoliberal HAS TO GET OUT
As a staunch progressive and BernieBro, PLEASE PLEASE vote for Biden. I have my reservations about him and believe me I’ve brought them up before. But I’d rather fight Biden on M4All than a literal facist bent on destroying democracy and the USPS. PLEASE VOTE FOR BIDEN PLEASE

Haha, Biden facemask suggestion is good.  If Trump orders a face mask mandate it will look like he is following Biden.  If Trump refuses to order one it will look like he doesn't care that people are dying.
Did I mention I’m voting for that very intelligent liberal and Biden and Jaime Harrison who will be taking your job. Did I mention I live in SC and about a 100 or more of my family and friends won’t be voting for you either and they’re all bringing friends.
Hopefully she votes for Biden. 😂
The 2 party system gives you the choice between Biden and Trump (or Hillary and Trump) if you could change it from the inside our choices would have been Bernie and Rand Paul.
How cute that Twinkie Boy is calling Joe Biden by Trump’s childish moniker.  Maybe we should just refer to you as Twinkles 🤣
Biden has no boundaries. No morality. No sense of accountability. Then again, Trump doesn't either...
I'm voting for Biden but just like with Hillary it's because I was dragged to do it. I won't enjoy it and will feel disgusting and will be blamed or insulted afterwards for not supporting him sooner but I don't like Trump

I feel fly AF in my   socks! This isn't sponsored. These socks are my gift to myself each month with my subscription. Oh, and to show it's not sponsored, fuck Trump and fuck Biden.
Jill Biden should be ashamed of how she is allowing the Democratic Party to USE her HUSBAND! She needs to take him home &amp; CARE for him not allow ppl to make fun of his declining mental health! My father went thru this! It’s horrible &amp; she is a monster for allowing him to be used
The protests give me hope. I just wish more people would realize we'd have had the same protests under Biden, but he'd pretend to care but do absolutely nothing.
HOW can Dems feel good? Biden PLAGIARIZED &amp; LIED his way thru life, school &amp; campaigns! He barely graduated college is being used by the party &amp; his wife who should be ashamed of herself. He needs to go home, be cared 4, not allow ppl to make fun of his declining mental health!
A lot of us sacrificed our time, energy, &amp; money for him &amp; he didn't stand up to them. He didn't challenge Biden at all. In 2016, Trump used his base as leverage. "Vote for me or they walk." In 2020, Bernie could have but didn't. We would have walked into hell for him.
Also in the neighborhood and we can’t wait to update our Biden sign! 😍
Biden will create economic conditions where everyone makes less.
Looking forward to the police being exactly the same as they are today, but at least the baboon won't be tweeting. No Medicare4All under Biden would be great compared to no Medicare4All under Trump.   "It's okay, everyone! This is democratic tear gas!"  That's how you sound.

Biden/Harris 2020: The Battle for the Soul of the Postal Service

The same people who still haven't accepted the last election are pushing the idea that President Trump won't accept the next election.  Why does no one ask Biden if he'll accept the results? The same reason they didn't ask Clinton. They believe it's safely in the bag.
They haven't moved an inch. What are you talking about? Biden said less than a year ago he is proud of the crime bill and still supports it and NOW he wants to give them even MORE money. Harris is down with ICE and calls herself the "Top Cop".
🤣 “If Biden wasn’t your first choice, join us so we can get Trump out of office.” What a slogan...🤦🏼‍♂️

Good vote for Biden the pedophile because apparently you’re fine with that.

All while Biden and Harris want mandatory mask for 3 months. Keep your eyes open!
