Biden must form a group to identify and prosecute the officers that have committed these atrocities.
So every time don Jr says something dumb we have to comment on Biden’s children? That makes no sense.
If Biden wins and she is the VP please someone take one for the team
And yet, your vote depends on Biden’s VP pick.. sigh
“Joe Biden is a racist, no man can stand for one color in society” 😘
Biden does not need Kentucky, Trump does.
Why a question of who you will vote for? Biden was a friend of your fathers. Yes they disagreed on issues but both men were full of integrity and honor.  continually puts your late great father down with despicable comments. Megan this should be a no brainer!!
I will absolutely vote for Biden as long as he offers to kick god right in the teeth
Thanks to Cory Gardner's ex worker....they just can't win honestly. They think a mentally ill singer will drain Biden of the Black vote.
In spite of his leadership—or lack there of—Would be great if President Biden starts his administration with this in place...But given Trumps history of lies, I highly doubt it.
Are they trying to make me like Biden MORE?
Biden Narrows Running Mate Finalist List To Two - Report
If Biden is elected and has to deal with these countries that are hostile with the US, how will he handle that?  Will he just get mad and call them names like he does to his own supporters? Or will his anger get our country into trouble? War? Animosity?
What a surprise...Republicans, with Cory Gardner playing dirty tricks with our election!!  If you can’t win honestly YOU CHEAT!  Black Americans won’t leave Biden in droves and vote for a mentally ill singer!
is a nack ass fake ass nigga...to even think he would ever have a chance to be president is idiodic and all he is doing is stealing the black votes from biden so trump can win again. dont fall for it
More Bernie crap heard from...I will take ANYONE Biden decides on!  HE gets that decision!
We hope that Joe Biden wins the election so that all the Trump voters get the mental illness care they so desperately need!
Biden should appoint independent prosecutor immediately to investigate abuse &amp; malfeasance. This reinforces need to have (1) full, qualified and vetted team in place so confirmation hearings can begin immediately and (2) well-defined, comprehensive and prioritized plan of action.
Gordon Chang: China Prefers ‘A Biden Presidency’

How the hell is Colorado likely Dem? Colorado has not voted for a Republican since 2004 not to mention Biden is up 11-15 points
What’s sad is you think Biden supporters would flock to see you. But they probably should as you don’t have much time left In office.
I’m starting to think it might be a good thing for Biden to debate Trump. It would create a good comparison in cognitive ability.
Can anyone name one thing that Biden has done while he was in office  the only reason Obama picked Biden was because he was stupid to pick up on what Obama and Hilary were doing
Biden Campaign Says, "He Is So Close To A VP Pick, He Can Smell Her!"🤭
Biden has admitted he didn't get everything right, but always did his best. Would "I take no responsibility" trump admit a mistake? He won't retract his statements regarding the central park 5! I am happy he bravely signed a bipartisan bill. Next accomplishment?
#TrumpIsLosing  Many people are saying he's a disgrace. Many people are saying he's a child rapist.  Many people are saying he's a tremendous failure. Many people are saying he knows nothing about anything. Many people are saying he's losing to Biden bigly.  🖕🏼
Im all in on Biden but nothing pisses me off more than the fact that only ~60% of Americans vote in any given election. And then they want to complain about the direction of the country. Politicians will get too complacent and corrupt without direction.
I guess Biden is going to have to drain the swamp when he gets in. Trump just went and filled it up.
Trump is a pig. But he’s a fighter. I’d rather have a fighter then a pansy like Biden. Biden is passive aggressive. Trump doesn’t care, he’ll fight for the US anywhere he goes. It may not be cordial or politically correct but as long as he has the United States back, I am in.
That's fine with me as long as the various state AGs coordinate their efforts to ensure that he is either (a) in the middle of a cuffed perp walk or (b) on a plane to Moscow within an hour of Biden saying, "...preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."
Joe Biden is not Hillary Clinton
Democrats sure know how to govern don’t they?  Great testimony for Biden!!!
Okay I'm starting to like this Biden fella
Per CNN, Biden banned the app from his campaign.
Hopefully Biden not paying attention to these guys.

Scott, you know you are not voting for Biden but you are voting for the VP.
Team Trump .... If Biden knew how to fix America, why didn't he tell Obama?🤷‍♀️
Voting for trump and the GOP across the board is what's good for America. Unless you want an anarchist society with no police, and antifa calling the shot for Biden...
Senator Jones... if Alabamaians are not smart enough to re-elect you... it will be their loss! However... Joe Biden will need an excellent Attorney General to right the wrongs and represent all Americans in our fight for a more just America! Can’t wait!
Translation - big tech is stealing the election for Biden
He never got to talk they were all to busy campaigning for Biden
She is too old for Biden so who 😮
…but the rest of the Dem party didn't agree, and Biden is STILL better than Trump, as long as he selects a reasonable VP. He'll LISTEN to the advisors trying to manipulate him, rather than actively ignoring anything that wasn't already in his head.
Biden should make it known that, if/when elected should Russia continue with their brazen behavior he will not only restore troop levels but increase them.The Russians are plotting to force Joe Biden to speak in public and actually campaign for president.  It's an attack on democracy.

Russia fears Biden like they feared Hillary. They know these true patriotic Americans really do put America first.
Biden reminds us every day in ways both large and small what having a real President is like
I don’t know how else to put it, but listening to Joe Biden speak tells me that not only does he have early onset dementia, but he’s just flat out stupid. How did he get this far?
Donald Trump has accomplished more in 4 years of government than Joe Biden has in 4 decades of government.
Did your daddy really say Biden will hurt God and the Bible?  Now that is the most ignorant thing I’ve ever heard.  Besides the things you post of course!
Your husband is intentionally interfering in an election with no intent to win, just spoil and THIS is the tweet you come up with? SRSLY?!!!!
Biden is afraid of adding a fourth debate?
So if China helps Biden win, shouldn’t that be called even since dad needed Russia’s help to win last time?
Your agenda to spread lies about Biden’s mental status is sad and pathetic. It’s a good distraction from the 160k dead and counting. But go on and spread your BS.
Right right only Biden has gaffes..idiot
Oh dude...Biden wrote that...not Trump...you would be right if Trump wrote it or tried to say it....
seriously, do you really think black voters who are going to vote for Biden are going to change their vote to Kanye, who is a tRump supporter? if anything  just lost a bunch of votes as they would rather vote for Kanye than tRump #trumpgate
You seem to be ignoring that Biden got more votes than the other Dem primary candidates.
This is actually a pretty genius and abusive tactic. Trump can put the onus on Biden to agree to an in-person debate even tho he doesn't want to debate (has prev indicated he may or may not show up) and when Biden inevitably says no and wants a cyber debate, he can blame Biden.
That’s what I thought.  Enjoy the Biden Administration.
You’re right.  Trump’s incompetence and unfitness to lead far outpace Biden’s.   Finally someone who understands. 😆😆
I've sent you a bunch of bots this morning -- all coming from the same anti-Biden tweet. All the profile photos are nearly the same. Can you please shut that farm down? Thanks

No, answer the question.  I’ll rephrase: what % of the black population own their own business?  You think Biden was a racist, so your attack falls laughably flat.
Ok, so if the president can’t stop abortions why did you bring that up in the first place. Why does it matter if Biden pro choice?  Your not making sense!!!!
Thank you for reporting on this. As a “Latina” Joe Biden does not speak for me or other Latinos. He speaks  of blacks &amp; Latinos as if we’re a number and how he can pander to us to get our vote and then forget about us. More of the same
Joe Biden winning is the answer you seek.
‘their businesses’??  How many black people own their own businesses?  Kanye???  Biden a racist???  What color is the sky in your world?
To bad Biden can't remember any of the facts.
I'll give you that one. Although if you were to ask a thousand folks on the street, that same question doubt 25% could answer it. Now explain all the times Biden can't finish a sentence or goes off into the twilight zone with his answer. Actually feel sorry for the man.
I'm voting for Biden even if bursts out doing an imitation of Speedy Gonzales.
This election is not who’s best. TBH Biden wasn’t my first choice or second but I’ll be crazy if I think Trump is better then Biden.
Let's have the debates, I 100% agree we should have them. After the first one is one is over I want you to tweet you honestly still believe what you say here in your tweet. I doubt you will though, you'll be to embarrassed when you see that "Hidden Biden" is losing his mind. SAD

We're waaaaaay past ultimatums, though. I personally can't stand Biden, but I love my country and know that means I vote for him. Period.
Biden is actually a racist and you libs want him in office 😂
This is why I think Biden needs to pick someone with some econ. credibility. Like Warren. Not just check a box. I am not sure Harris or Rice does that.  One shores up judiciary  &amp; the other foreign affairs which is needed, but economy/virus, including healthcare, will be #1 issue

Nobody believed you Joe! You have been a segregationist for your whole career and have blatantly offended African Americans even when you said if they don't vote Democrat, they ain't black.

Which is it, exactly?  Because we're told if we don't vote Trump we're voting for Biden, and if we don't vote Biden we're giving a vote to Trump  How about, just maybe, the person we vote for is the one that gets our vote.

He just backtracks after a stink is raised. He is a segregationist at heart and has been since he got into politics.

He can't even complete a thought in an interview. Maybe his earpiece is slow as he gets fed his answers. Joe Biden is a segregationist and fought for their cause in schools crafting language still used today to oppose school integration.
Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists. he fought for their cause in schools and helped give America the language that is still used to oppose school integration today.
Going camping off the grid Monday and Tuesday.  Market will still be here Wednesday I hope unless the aliens 👽 come or Biden names Kamala 🤡 🥜
NEWS: Disclosure docs show that one of Biden’s top candidates for VP made big investments in the fossil fuel industry. The revelations come as Biden has faced renewed questions about his climate policies.
But Biden did make African Americans seem like a monolith. Biden's racism is so ingrained, he just can't help himself because that is what he truly believes.
who’s more senile, Biden or Pelosi? She just claimed there are 3.3 million new cases and 70 million deaths from COVID in the last 11 weeks. More deaths than new cases?According 2 CDC there are 4.8 million cases and 160k deaths, total. #PelosiMustGo #shescrazy
Everyday Biden says something racist. Unbelievable. I can go on and on about all his statements. Wake up America. He is handing the election to Trump on a silver platter.
We ditchin Biden y’all
He won't apologize because he doesn't believe he damages people with his words and believes what he says. He has a long record of discrimination going back to trying to stop the busing during the desegregation orders.
Other than Biden she was my least favorite of the primary candidates.
does rocky think we don't realize how big of a dumbass biden is? we see it bud
Its the only reason Biden "Won"
With Biden’s VP choice expected soon, here’s whom he could pick  via  It will reek of Obama-ism and political correctness and will smell worse than a sewer.  Black-Brown-Black, women, liar, hater, puppet, who will it be?
I hope Joe Biden doesn’t campaign at all. I don’t want him getting Covid
Rumor has it that Susan Rice is Biden's choice. Remember that people died and she lied. Four Americans died in #Benghazi attack: #AmbassadorChrisStevens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and #CIAoperatives, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods, former Navy SEALs.
Yeah fuck Joe Biden but there is no way a Democratic Presidential candidate isn't going to have a union bug on the actual physical button
When you KNOW Biden didn’t write it.
Your're the one accusing Dems of hiding Biden when we are in the middle of a pandemic.
LOL. This guy thinks the US provides healthcare to just anyone.  I assume you're voting for Biden as illegal immigration has only increased under Trump.
cue white people cries  “but Biden isn’t inspiring enough... he’ll delay the revolution... i wanted Bernie... both parties are the same... I just wrote an op-ed called The Liberal Case for Trump 2020...”
We all knew it
Live in CO so my ballot comes in the mail  But yes, I would stand in line to cast a vote for Biden
Because who ever wanted a picture taken with Joe Biden?
Exactly. Harris is my second least favorite of all the primary candidates (next to Biden) and so I just assume she will be the VP nomination.
Let’s see...  40: NC, TN, AR, OK, TX, NM, AZ, CA 70: MD, PA, WV, OH, IN, IL, MO, KS, CO, UT 90: MA, NY, PA, OH, IN, IL, WI, MN, SD, WY, MT, ID, WA  70 &amp; 90 are in 4 states and the only one with a woman D Senator among those states is Duckworth  That’s who Biden is picking
To be clear, anyone who votes for Kanya was never gonna vote for Biden anyhow.  I tend to think that skin color does not dictate intelligence, and no intelligent voters vote for any dude whose wife wants to COMMIT HIM TO THE FUNNY FARM!!
Don’t let trump even get 125.   Biden Power
How long til trump calls joe Biden “joe hidin’”
Why is Joe Biden at a Royals game?
I 💜   His intelligent, irreverent, wry wit is a balm to my weary soul at the end of the day.
So Trump says he kissed women without their express permission.  But did he?  Where and when?  Biden kisses and gropes CHILDREN without their permission (hundreds of pictures to confirm this obvious fact), and that's okay?  Serious question:  Are you a pedophile?
Biden apologized for yesterdays racist remarks again. How many racist things does he have to say to make people realize he is the racist person on earth. He will not help the black community and has not in 40 years. Trump has done more than any President to help all people.
Jobs Joe Biden is currently qualified for: Sweet Tea Magnate Breakfast Sausage spokesman Walmart greeter Dairy farmer (handsy)  Commissioner of major league baseball Mayor of North Pole amusement park Front Desk/doorman for NY high rise apartment building
Your campaign is sliding into the swamp. Your attack on Joe Biden's faith is not only wrong, but stupid. The one without faith is YOU.  You embody EVERY SINGLE ONE of the 7 Deadly Sins - look them up. You will recognize yourself.
Coronavirus US: death toll tops 160,000 as relief package impasse continues – live
Biden really keeps working so hard to lose my vote, the commitment is frankly impressive.
Wouldn't the "Nazi" be Biden? I mean he's the one that gave a eulogy at an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK funeral.
Conjecture: Dems get Kamala Harris or other "in-pocket" Democrat as running mate, pull bait-and-switch with Biden for health reasons post convention. No Yang, no Sanders. Dems are a hard no on both, which should terrify reasonable young liberals who are "solution focused."
Joe Biden is NOT the agent of change this country desperately needs. He’s there to serve as a vessel for financial and structural stability for the 1%
In today's Unaffiliated from  How Colorado is spending $19B in stimulus money, congressman's wife profiting from campaign, Biden puts Colorado on the map and more.  Subscribe:  #copolitics #coleg #cogov #cosen
After thinking about Joe Biden and watching him now for over a year as a candidate, (as an independent voter), I just can't believe that he is the Democratic candidate for President. Seriously, is there someone waiting in the wings to swoop in or a 25th amendment strategy?
Today I learned that if you don't like Joe Biden you're a Trump supporter.
It is Aug 7th and Biden is the most racist person on earth.
Trump claims Biden 'no longer worthy of the Black Vote' in wake of diversity comment
It's true Biden does not excite anyone.  It's also true that trump is both the dumbest, most morally bankrupt person anyone has ever met or heard on a mic.  I ask you: outside Wile E Coyote, has anyone ever called themselves a genius (repeatedly!) who was one?
Good grief
This is why my original ? was to the Good Dr and NOT his BEEHIVE.  I don't call anyone coons for thinking this way.  I AGREE with A LOT of IT.  I know about the party switch in early 1900s i.e. Southern strategy.  I am aware of policing records of Biden/Harris.  ? was RIGHT NOW.
1. It's faking a stock market comeback right before an election 2. It sets up for the market to totally crash right after Biden wins, falsely putting the blame on Dems 3. It allows Feds to sell corp bonds to foreign powers allowing them to own large amounts of U.S. businesses
Oh, yeah. By noon I'll be a communist, a racist, pro Biden, pro Trump, a patriot, a traitor, fkng incredible.
I did it for Garth Brooks tickets, I can do it for Joe Biden.
RIGHT???  Like goddammit at this point we were promised Joe Biden the One-Winged Angel and I was so ready to vote for the hottest president ever and this is what we get?
What Joe Biden thinks about Black Americans is 'offensive and gross,' says Iraq veteran  #FoxNews
Evaluating Joe as a Presidential possibility, but having a hard time being convinced he is a viable candidate. For example, Joe Biden's public statements questioned by the media in past presidential campaigns.
I love how every time Tr*mp makes shit up about Biden, it makes Biden sound cooler.   Like only in my wildest dreams could I actually vote for someone who would throw all guns into a volcano, turn us into a socialist paradise, and destroy god.
Trump re-election strategies (2020): •They’re all socialists! 👎  •Bidens are corrupt 👎 •Economy is unbeatable 👎 •COVID is Dem hoax 👎 •Uh, we’ll fix economy 👎 •Uh, we beat COVID 👎 •Law &amp; Order 👎 •Antifa’s coming 👎 •Biden is weak 👎 •Biden will take away God 🙄
Sadly, I must agree with JVL.  All of machinery and chicanery of Trumpism will still be in place once Biden is elected, unfettered by the need to even appear to be governing.   Trump unleashed, unbound, unrepentant.
He apologized immediately and it wasn't his point. Biden will say some stupid things from time to time but he's not a racist corrupt compulsive liar and he'll apologize when he says something stupid. You won't get that from the other side.
"West, who has previously voiced support for Mr Trump and is running as an independent, was named on the Colorado ballot on Thursday, the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office confirmed. At least one Republican official assisted West with his filing"
"When it was pointed out to West that it was unlikely he could win November’s poll, and that his campaign was being run as a distraction, he replied: “I’m not going to argue with you. Jesus is King.'"
Last night I kept dreaming about which bumper sticker would be catchier: Biden + Bass or Biden + Harris. Then I hit on Joe and Sue.  I could never make the choice.
I think that Biden's biggest problem is that he has so many great candidates to choose from. Trump, on the other hand, only has one requirement: "Are you loyal to me?"
When I first heard Trump's comments, I thought Biden said something really terrible. What Biden really said, when you come down to it, is that the Black community is more organized than the Latino community. After all, Blacks have been fighting these battles for generations.
The harder the Dems surge left, the more I hear voting Trump. Seems like more to block Biden/socialism than pro-Trump. I live in a major swing state.....
isn't it really funny that Trump supporters are calling out Biden's  microaggressions? a concept they typically drill the left for creating, all while supporting a man known for his macroaggressions... #fucktrump
You'll never see Biden asked -&gt; Why Is Joe Biden Silent on the Attacks Against Catholic Statues, Churches, and Beliefs?
Biden says he would stop border wall construction if elected president  via  #COVID19 #Mexico #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVirusUpdates
I can't wait for the debates. I hope biden doesn't chicken out. I really want to hear both sides.
third party candidates and write-ins. A case might be made for Biden, though I'd probably disagree with it, given his abortion politics.   My editors have a more nuanced discussion about it in this podcast:   I've found Twitter, due to brevity, lacks nuance
So yesterday, a group of women leaders and organizations wrote a letter and sent it out to top news executives.  The purpose: A warning to avoid "stereotypes and tropes" in coverage around Joe Biden's VP pick.  Outlining specific traps the media fall into.  Offering assistance.
"Trump says the only way he can lose is through election fraud. In fact, it seems more likely that the only way he can win is through fraud."
Joe Biden is a devout catholic and regularly attends Sunday service.   The last time Trump went to church, he gassed peaceful Americans.
"Biden has offered voters a steady rollout of plans to solve big problems &amp; with a heavy dose of decency &amp; respect.  His climate agenda is truly bold. He says he wants to be a “transformational” president, not just transitional. He will follow science"   a/l/a "everybody VOTES."
Joe Biden is a devout catholic and regularly attends Sunday service.   The last time Trump went to church, he gassed peaceful Americans.
If Biden doesn't make a GRAND GESTURE to the left soon, he's going to lose to Trump.  BIG Like picking a Bernie Bro for VP, or supporting M4A  Otherwise, too many voters like me will stay home.
Joe Biden is a devout catholic and regularly attends Sunday service.   The last time Trump went to church, he gassed peaceful Americans.
I think you lump all Hispanics into one pot.  You lack Comprehension of the widely DIFFERING POLITICS of different Latinx Ppl.  Diversity b/t Cubans and Arizona or California Mexicans or Salvadoreans or S America.  Biden knows what he is talking about—YOU DON’T IGNORANT FOOL.
Of course they do, they're losing...BAD! - Trump campaign wants presidential debates with Joe Biden early and often  via
For those in despair, read this article:
They think Biden appeals to average people but he will be run by the radical left as we know if elected.  God knows he’s not capable of running a hot dog stand much less be president.
He’s right though. Biden is not left at all. He and Obama deported more people than any other administration. They didn’t end the drug war. They took us from two wars to seven. They want to prosecute Ed Snowden. These are all ideological conservative policies.
Attempt?   “And by the way, what you all know, but most people don’t, unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”   —Joe Biden
Nope, I know some folks of the conservative persuasion who would never vote for a "crazy commie" like Biden, who also won’t vote for Trump. Their vote for a 3rd party candidate is still a vote against Trump.
Ok Christians....explain to me how Biden is going to "hurt" God...but apparently has no beef with Jesus...?
You’re 100% correct. The Biden people are in such denial about his racism. Biden is just more polite about it than Trump.
Kanye late to the party lol but people mad at him for interference because Biden cant hold his own is funny
Ok... that’s a personal problem. I’m not for Biden, I’m voting to remove an existential threat from the White House. Biden at least has a very decent public platform that I can mostly get behind, and I trust him to put intelligent progressive people in positions of power.
. : Be Very Careful About Biden's Lead on Trump -- he joins  to discuss  the second coronavirus stimulus package and the upcoming Presidential election.
Trump's accusation that Biden is against God and wants to hurt God keeps making me think of the lyrics from Woody Guthrie's very subtle Mean Talking Blues:   "I hated union everywhere, 'cause God likes unions and I hate God!"
Yesterday's state polls by Quinnipiac and Data for Progress are all broadly consistent with Biden leading nationally by ~7-10 points... except the Quinnipiac poll of Kentucky, which has Trump only +9. You'd expect him to be up by 22% there if he's down 10% nationally. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I guess Biden should pick Betty White
Following Biden's mea culpa, CNN, MSNBC defend former VP after virtually ignoring latest gaffes  #FoxNews
It's not 'designed' to hurt Biden unless he's guilty of something, so no worries, right?  Oh and it is not advisable to release reports until they are finished.
I think Biden’s running mate should be somebody who earns the median income.
Trump Campaign Busted For Deceptively Manipulating Biden Photos In New Ad | HuffPost
All good.  All anyone needs to know is the Guy hiding in his basement that can't even put a sentence together Biden is the best the Democrats have. 🤪  Enjoy the incoming red tsunami!
Nobody has more fun at his TV job than Brian Williams. His deadpan comments keep us smiling even in hard times.
Joe Biden takes black voters for granted
We have seen so many civic leaders &amp; politicians speak at these Scientology events and shrug them off as ignorant boobs or useful idiots. I can't tell you how happy I am to see  getting what she deserves for speaking on Scientology's behalf.
I hope she's gonna vote for Biden over Trump because she's a human.
The challenge is that enthusiasm is anti-Trump, not pro-Biden and while he's a nice guy, Biden doesn't seem to get that.
Biden didn't apologize. He clarified. Big difference.
Biden doesn't remember anything...
An all white ticket for this party at this time is unthinkable to me. Surely Biden sees that. I personally don’t know any white women who have this attitude that it has to be a white woman first, but if they are out there they need to get over it. It’s insane.
Just wait and see what weak, feeble Biden does to Santa if he wins! Trump told me so!
So his non apology is an apology, it’s about Trump not Biden, and now Bernie is in the mix?  How far do u have to go to excuse a candidate who is obviously past his sell by date? Jesus Christ talk about any dream will do! You can almost hear Joe shout you got a black VP dammit!
SE Cupp, a self-described "staunch conservative," says she's actually considering a vote for Biden and 100% no matter what, against Trump.
Biden says he would stop border wall construction if elected president
Contrast this video from 1988 and Biden's run for President with Biden today.
It is more about authenticity. Both candidates claim faith, and Biden has given evidence that his faith has guided him whereas Trump makes empty statements about only reading the Bible and using it for photo ops.
What Joe Biden thinks about Black Americans is 'offensive and gross,' says Iraq veteran
Oh for sure. We all have to just *block it out*. Biden will do right. I wish "Josh" was there to help him. 😊#BidenVP
It's so hilarious too, because it's not like there isn't plenty to work with. Biden's record is abysmal. They just don't like dealing with reality or facts and would rather fear monger idiots with absolute nonsense.
This is the emergency. Not testing. Not deaths. Not schools. Not anything. Bullshit. Biden 2020.
This! Biden has a 40-yr record beginning with in the 1970s, he vocally opposed busing to achieve school desegregation... it goes on from there. You can't rewrite history to fit your narrative.
Biden 2020: Does this Klan Robe make me look progressive?
I have no idea, of course, but imo it wouldn't be worth the political capital - even if he *wanted* to do it. Biden is going to make the choice. It's not likely to be Warren, I'm afraid. But she'll be a big part of the agenda - and we can  help! #LFG
Why is CNN afraid of calling it what it is.  Voter Suppression.  Beside you all need to vote for Biden or he may hurt God. Lol.
Can you imagine if the Biden team were capable of making this compelling an argument to vote for Biden?
So is Biden saying that black Ameeicans don't have diversity/different attitudes about different things?  Dem are you listening to Joe Biden's comments in these interviews?? He can't put one logical/rational thought together.  Biden is incapable of running this country.  Period.
I feel the same way. I’ll vote for Biden because I love my country but it IS hard to get enthusiastic about him.
Biden was VP for 8 years. Trump is way over exposed as a identity, from daily appearances. If people watch, it will be for the spectacle, not for information.
Join our campaign:  Follow Joe! Joe’s Twitter: Joe’s Facebook: Joe’s Instagram:  #JoeBiden #Joe2020 #BidenForPresident  Former Vice President Joe Biden is running for president to restore the soul of the nation. He believes it’s time to remember who we are. We’re Americans: …
Trump and the GOP could’ve saved lives if they didn’t make the virus political. Trump did nothing in the month of Feb except say it will “disappear.”    Even if Biden is “declining” it’s clear that “YoSemite and Thighland” Trump is much further along in the decline.
Black Democrats had a number of credible alternatives to Biden last year if they wanted to support a Black candidate and they largely stuck with Biden, and to think that they'd suddenly bolt for Kanye in the general is... an odd view of voting behavior.
To vote Biden?
Why have candidates supported by No Dem Left Behind been attacking Joe Biden and calling for him to drop out?
If Biden is strong enough to hurt God, I want him as Our Leader!!!!!
I vote for Kristi Noem from S.D. for Joe a Biden’s running mate!
Kanye West indicates he is running for president to siphon votes from Joe Biden | Fox News
My question is; So Dr. Jill Biden is allowing her husband, a mentally declining individual to be used and abused by the Democratic Party? Something is terribly wrong with this, right? Is she still seeing patients?
Voting Biden.  I will be that problem and own it.
No one we have elected on the last 20 yrs has been a good leader. We need trained scientists taking on the position but can also clearly understand common sense. However, scientists are too smart to run for office lol. Trump, Biden, Hilary, Bill and Bush all terrible.
Neither you, Joe Biden nor Jo Jorgensen are worthy of my vote.
The party of Joe Biden is the same party of slavery, Jim Crowe, abortion, the KKK, Gov. Wallace.  Re-branded, new packaging, but same condescension and silent hatred of black achievement.
Actually Biden didn’t admit any mistake in this statement, and you’re being rude to someone with English as a second language. Biden’s first statement was clear, but you want us to allow for certain intellectual origami in his words you don’t offer this man from Nigeria... #shame
I think Biden wants to buy everyone an electric Corvette?
I am not fooled for one second. Sad that many MAGAs will hold this as true. But, then everything about trump is Sad.    via
But He didn’t admit any mistake, he blamed his mistake on our misunderstanding of the words he clearly spoke to a demographic he was trying to woo. It’s a typical Biden gaffe, he inadvertently diminished one group while flattering another. Biden should be better than this!
lmfao I’ll vote for biden if he successfully hurts god
This isn’t about Trump, it’s about Biden, he didn’t apologize, apparently it’s our fault we misunderstood what he clearly said. Biden and the  think that anything is better than Trump, even it’s a slightly less racist 70 yr old who still takes the black community for granted.
Where’s the apology in this statement???? The first sentence is a lie, he wasn’t talking about diversity in the black and Latino communities, he literally said the black community lacked the diversity of the Latino community. Repeatedly Biden takes the black community for fools!
Did Biden Tweet a video of someone chatting “White Power”, or did I miss something? Hmmmm
The powerful, the almighty, the creator...hurt by Joe Biden. And they wonder why 1.) no one buys this annointed oil bullshit and 2.) There are atheists in to see world. This is their representative. And if they try claim he is not, we where is the holy outrage?Seriously are Democrats brainwashed it's amazing how they say one thing and do another just like Nancy pelosi blaming Trump for not doing things fast enough on coronavirus but yet it was her dancing around in Chinatown saying to not block people and Joe Biden saying xenophobe wth
With a democratic Senate, Biden will get things done.
Why are you running? While I see from your platform that you are a socialist and environmentalist, you know as well as I do that your race will only impact the votes for Biden, and possibly allow Trump to win. I find that unacceptable.
Why would anyone even think this?  Can somebody defend this position or are her marbles just as loose as Joe Biden?
Oh, yeah. By noon I'll be a communist, a racist, pro Biden, pro Trump, a patriot, a traitor, fkng incredible.
He wasn't trailing Biden for the last 3 years
Have you shown your father half as much interest in his medical care that you have shown Biden? I know you are kind of the ignored one because you don't have his name &amp; you don't have a vagina, but that reality that you don't SEE your father's brain is rotten fruit is glaring.
The idea that Kanye should suspend his mental illness long enough for Biden to get elected is ridiculous. The run is the disease.
No one would do what you've done!  Competent presidents would have nipped this in the bud in December of last year.  They wouldn't ignore everything around them for months.  I've been working from home in March and I don't see any end it sight -- until President Biden!
Educate yourself and read, Biden has been called out for his pro-abortion stance.
Do I want to hear a debate of Trump  saying Biden is going to destroy GOD and Biden saying you are a ridiculous fool. I will pass. It is not my type of comedy.
Biden was also 100% against gay marriage until the SCOTUS ruled on the decision. He suddenly supports their rights to marry.
if Biden's thumb was on life support and Biden's thumb were on the ballot, I'd vote for Biden's thumb.  Doing anything else only contributes to the total destruction of the United States.
Nothing New - CNN covers for Biden constantly.  CNN has absolutely no credibility left.
So?!  Have you noticed there are no rallies &amp; this isn’t a normal election year? Good for Trump for getting his message out anyway possible.  Hey, CNN forgot to report on Biden’s latest insult to African Americans today!
I don’t care if he picks a bar of soap for VP.  I’m voting for Biden.
If Biden can hurt the Christian god then either he’s more powerful than their god, or their god is a pussy.
Biden’s one tough MF if he can hurt god!😂
Can’t believe you’d vote for Biden. Emotions aside, do the right thing.
As we all know, Joe didn’t write this.  I doubt he even realizes that he said what he said. Let’s end this charade, horrible sham, being perpetrated on the American people.  Everyone can see Biden disintegrates daily. No matter how much u hate Trump, he will win.
War Biden! Before I just was picking lesser of two evils now you say I’m voting for Kratos? #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Trump is god in this scenario. Biden will hurt Trump if he wins....like his feelings, I guess?
Stupid Biden
It seems like the obvious voting strategy (at the national level) is "Biden plus Republicans in the Senate to check him." I suspect the outcome will be "Biden plus the Senate Republicans take a shellacking."
Next week:  "Biden's green deal means cars are illegal, dishwashers illegal, no cops, no airplanes, no toilets.  Think about that, no toilets.  I think about that.  My hotels have the best toilets.  Biden will take all the toilets out of the suburbs and give them to inner city"
Has anyone else noticed that Biden looks a lot like Walter?  Coincidence?   #JeffDunham #WalterJeffDunham
If Biden has the ability to hurt God, I think everyone should vote for him.   That would make him God right?   I mean if you knock the guy in boxing or MMA you get the belt. That's not too far fetched, is it?  #Biden2020
This is not what is going to bring down Joe Biden.  It's reaching as hard as they can to find something, anything to stick to Biden.   COVID19 is what is on America's mind, and this is meh!
The funniest part about  saying Biden will "Hurt the Bible. Hurt God. He's against guns. He's against energy. " is I haven't been to church in never, but that's what your sermons are like? God, guns, and energy?  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
So Joe Biden said that the African-American isn't diverse because AFRICAN-Americans' ancestors are from Africa, but Hispanic-Americans can have ancestors from Spain, Mexico, Brazil, etc.  How is that insulting?  Who is insulted?
If Biden wins, he will not have the power to get rid of the second amendment. Unlike you Biden knows that he won’t have total authority. He actually understands the US constitution.
No, your guns will NOT be taken away. And, Joe Biden wants to allocate MORE $ to police dep’ts. Don’t believe this douchenozzle. 864511320
Joe Biden is Beatrix Kiddo.
Still baffling that the leaders of the free world, the most powerful nation on earth, are giving people a choice of Biden or Trump as president.
"Biden hurts God"  Dude, don't we have to vote for the guy who can hurt God?  I mean maybe he wasn't talking about The God. Just some little Greek or Egyptian god. Little "g".  But still, that's pretty impressive. I think I will vote for that guy no matter what, right?
This is what Trump said today about Joe Biden, a practicing Catholic. What church does Trump go to? Trump plays golf on Sundays, right? How can Biden "hurt God"? Does Trump sound like a leader is this video?
Say you ARE voting for Biden. That is more clear.
😂😂😂😂  Honey, read up.
It is your vote. What is it with some white women? He hasn’t destroyed and killed off enough us yet?  His health appears worse than Biden’s. So you approve more of Pence the CINO (Christian in name only) and one of that man in the White House’s “followers”?
I’m sorry but that headline is one of the dumbest I’ve ever read and I can’t imagine anything in your article that could possibly change my opinion.   You’d pick trump/pence over Biden/someone you don’t like?
I know. That man in the White House’s VP is a CINO (christian in name only) and a “follower”. How could Biden’s VP be worse?  For some that R means everything to them 😢.
Are you a never trump?  If you are unable to vote for Biden depending on his VP pick wa wa, maybe you are party over country. Sounds like an excuse.
This guy is telling people about Biden's relationship with God?
1 outrageous Biden take per day. This is fun. I can get used to it. Grand finale when someone cuts them all together in October.
Awesome. We need the support of Vets for Biden, who won't even believe American soldiers are targeted for assassination by Russia. What a slap in the fact to vets.
45 is indeed losing it bigly. However, I suspect all the FOXNEWS journalists are speaking of Biden. Actually a very satiric thing to do. I love
I apologize, I shouldn't say you have a closed mind, after all you did change parties. Biden was not my first choice, Bernie was. Let me ask, what exactly made you change?
"More progressive than Biden" IS NOT PROGRESSIVE. HE VOTED FOR SEGREGATION!!!
I think Biden has hit bottom then he comes up with this interview. No wonder they’ve isolated him. This reminded me of his previous angry outbursts &amp; insults to his supporters while campaigning.
Instagram Displayed Negative Related Hashtags For Biden, But Hid Them For Trump  via
The DNC should be ashamed for what they’re doing to Biden - his wife also.  He’s become a Joke to the entire country &amp; that’s very sad.
You know if this was the first time we’ve heard that man in the White House lie and take credit for everything, we might believe him. It is old, tiring, laughable, pathetic, and disgusting at this point. Vote Biden.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Joe Biden Wins!
I guess POC are just supposed to vote for him because of the color of his skin?  That way Biden would lose and Trump would win.  Trump's not fooling anyone and it's not going to work!
Then you haven’t been paying attention. Biden stands for all that is good and decent in this country. If he isn’t elected, say goodbye to democracy.
Of course, for this to occur Trump would have to overtake Biden in (at least) four places he's currently losing: PA, FL, ME-02, and NE-02. But it's true that this map is plausible.
I'm here to defeat Trump and help lift Biden to the Presidency. #Biden2020  #NoComradesUnder1k
Who in God's green earth thinks that debating Biden will help Trump?  The man tanked in an interview with Jonathan Swan -- he's going to dominate Joe Biden?  Like him or not, Biden knows his shit!  Trump -- not so much!
I agree. As an Independent voter, I don't need to hear about Trump's plans. He'll either be lying or... well, he'll just be lying because he only has plans that service Putin's agenda &amp; his boss don't want him sharing those out loud.  I suggest Joe #Biden hold virtual town halls.
I don’t care if Biden is in cognitive decline. He could spend the next 4 years in diapers drooling on himself and still do a far better job than trump.
Are there betting odds yet on whether Biden's vp will become president before January 2025? I'd personally guess around a 1/10 chance.
The USPS just endorsed Joe Biden for President. Had they not done that, I really would have done something.  However, now that they made that move, absolutely not!
Michelle realizes Joe Biden looks more inept by the day &amp; won’t be elected &amp; Her husband was the most corrupt president  ever.  But it’s so much easier to blame Trump bc she knows he will win in Nov &amp; lead us for 4 more more yrs.
We will. Vote Biden.
Biden should most definitely debate trump. Even if it was a video zoom type event. If Biden says no, trump will run with that.
Biden just announced he is too chickenshit to except the nomination in Milwaukee. Guess he’ll do the debates and his speech in his basement we he can be coached with a teleprompter. What a joke
In today's news, Fuck Joe Biden.
Sometime near the end of the year. . . . . Have to get past the riots from the left when Biden(D) looses, then the pandemic will suddenly disappear. . .
Christine, it’s unfortunate that Trump learned so much from Clinton and Biden, but if what you say about Trump is true, then they taught him well. He would have learned from the best.
Biden had a good Interview too. Go see the racist in action.
this is the reality of decades of Presidents and the Congress and Bureaucracy sucking up to Chins allowing them to gain this status at our expense. Like Biden’s family making cozy deals with them when he was OBAMA VP!!!
#Biden YEAH ! BIDEN WOULD MARK THE END OF THE US !  HE WILL BE REMOVED BY THE 25th AMENDMENT AND A COMMUNIST WILL WRECK EVERYTHING !  BIDEN IS A COMMUNIST TOO !  WITH DEMENTIA !  Is What's Happening in NYC a Glimpse into Joe Biden's America?.
Vanilla ice cream helps sway people who think chocolate is too exotic. Biden is a home churned vanilla. French vanilla would have been too much for the conservative dems.
The USPS just endorsed Joe Biden. I don’t really think it’s the Republicans that we have to worry about here.
I think Trump has had such a bad year that it'd take a Kamala Harris tier pick to blow it for Biden.
COVID-19 is worth voting Biden. #DonaldTrumpIn5Words
We know who did the work.    will have 4 more years, with President Biden to do more great things.
Florida can have vote by mail according to Trump, but not Nevada?  What will he say when Florida's mail in ballots favor Joe Biden?
I follow several people that don't follow me back! Biden,  Polis, Obama, Maddow, several comics, an actor or two, several organizations...
Democrats are creating a narrative, yet you say it is Joe Biden that is afraid?  How does that make sense at all? We see how Trump gets flustered by the truth on his response to COVID.  It's not Biden who should be afraid?
Fundraise seems to be a key word. Also, right now most of the push against vp candidates seem to be from democrats. Once a woman is selected, we will feel the full push from the GOP. They will attack her much more than Biden...whoever it is.
And what specifically should he be doing Hill?  Destroying the economy like you and yours want to do just so you can get elected.  How about blaming China?  Sure you won’t do that because it won’t help Biden get elected.  Of course him speaking won’t help him get elected either
Dunno about healthcare but am hoping Biden won’t subvert our constitution, remove all oversight, divide the nation, distort facts, argue with science, spread ignorance and hate and disgust all of us with a moral compass the way Trump has.
You are such a joke. No wonder Biden is beating you!
That’s Trumps America. He’s still president and according to you and his supporters he will win in 2020. So this is all his nazi style tactics, not Biden.
She &amp; Biden are both into locking up young black males - they can run in that.
This interview is so painful to watch. He repeats his same stick to nausea. It is embarrassing and horrifying that this man in the White House is the president of the United States of America. How did we fall so far? Vote Biden Vote Biden Vote Biden.
Biden should offer to help trump through all of this/his madness to save American lives end the divide and save our democracy from the brink MAKE DEMOCRACY GREAT AGAIN MAKE LIBERTY GREAT AGAIN THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS IS FREEDOM FREE FROM DOMINATION
B!  The one where Joe Biden gets down on the level of children to talk to them!
Why would Biden waste his time discussing politics with a complete idiot who is the Leader of the Republican Party??
Biden Leading Trump Among Voters Who Favor Being Alive  via
Not at all unlikely.  It is still hard to see Biden as the nominee.
I'll vote for Biden in the hopes he chooses Harris as VP.  She can take over if he's ever incapacitated.
I voted against Trump in 2016 and I’ll do it again in 2020.  Clinton and Biden were both my last choice in the democratic field.  Either is light years ahead of Trump.
Joe Biden pays tribute to John Hume
I don’t think him running helps that man in the White House. He wants to take women’s choices away, doesn’t have any plans, and is counting on people to vote for him because they like his music. The gullible “followers” are with the man in the White House not the Biden voters.
You notice how we refer to the man in the White House’s people as followers and Biden’s (and other politicians) as voters?
Were your supporters wearing masks?  Florida is suffering from a spike.  Biden supporters might have chosen to stay home to avoid spreading CV.
🖐🏼 He has been an embarrassment from the get go. If that’s not bad enough, he has become a danger. Vote Biden.
Of course they did, they know Biden would not win with his dementia.
Them enjoy four more years of him if you’re not voting Biden.
#DearMichigan  It's time to recapture our democracy before Putin takes over for Trump. In order to do so, please vote for #Biden &amp; #VoteBlue.
Why would Biden supporters come to your rally? Do you see KKK at Bidens rallys?
Actually, Donnie Dumbfuck... a recent BofA study says the markets would do well under Biden. Also, there has been better growth under Democratic administrations, than under Republicans.
Funny how you wouldn’t see any Biden supporters at YOUR appearances. Great observation.
Planning on him stealing another election, eh, Kevin? Worst. President. Ever. Vote Biden and stop the madness.
Hadn't hear the term "Basement Biden".... Love it..!
#DearMichigan Joe Biden has your back!  Vote for Joe.
Really? Wow. That’s probably the first true thing he’s ever said in his life. And that’s supposed to deter us from voting for Biden?
Biden is a plaigerizer, groper of small children, he &amp; his family got wealthy from deals w/foreign governments; accused of sexual assault,  Racist (called BO clean &amp; articulate, etc.), lied about accomplishments in law school—integrity/dignity/honesty?
At this point does it even matter who Biden chooses as a running mate? Does it even matter if there are any debates? Aren’t we all just waiting for November? Who could possibly be undecided now?
Sorry, that won't fly. You didn't just predict the right will be peaceful if Biden wins, you said that for over 200 years violence has been a tool of the left, but shunned by the right. That is already false.
As much as I hate trump, Joe Biden sucks. Why isn’t he running as a Republican? He doesnt have any democratic values, he doesn’t care about the people. He is a bootlicker that supports cop. Both trump and Biden are horrible men.
At least Biden doesn’t promote a quack doctor who believes in demon sex.   Well, you just keep worrying about the anti Christ and ignore the current one in the WH.  The rest of us are going to purge him come November.
And we have had a life time of Biden to see what he is about.  Had enough of that Vado. And now he doesn’t even know what office he is running for.  Too stupid to debate Trump
You are running in hopes that it hurts Biden, that’s why you are running?  Why don’t you just campaign for that man in the White House?  Other than taking away women’s right to choose, which won’t hurt Biden, what do you stand for, I mean besides money and fame?
As Fareed said just today “ Trump has turn the American Presidency into a reality television show but the Covid19 pandemic has painfully demonstrated that you cannot solved an ACTUAL crisis with ratings &amp; tweets!! “ Stop the Trump Virus and vote Biden!!
That's a really good question.  He would need to practice a lot to go up against a master BS’er, deflector and liar like Trump.  Right now he seems to be winning just letting Trump campaign for him.  Biden's not a strong debater, doesn't think on his feet, and is prone to gaffes.
Agree the Biden/China deal looks bad.  And I agree the Hunter/Burisma deal stinks.  No argument there!  Hunter isn't the president so he's of less interest.  Trump's children have likely made more from China deals than Hunter.
The modern day GOP is so fucking stupid now a days. Biden said he wanted to raise corporate tax to crack down on that. He has very specific policies to create new jobs and buy more American products. And he doesn't want to defund the police he wants to give more funding.
On January 20, the US Military will report to the winner (Joe Biden, for those not paying attention). I’m pretty sure they have the wherewithal to drag his orange ass out of there.
BIDEN do the extraordinary thing &amp; DENY Trump a debate. You ARE in control. He will lose it. It’s the only thing Trump wants...don’t give it to him. DENY TRUMP!!
Let’s suppress Trump. Please Biden deny HIM by denying the debate. THAT will get into his head so fast!! Just say “no” to any debate. Just deny Trump.
Deny Trump the debate....Biden take control and just deny HIM. HE just wants the opportunity to spew more lies.
DENY TRUMP... just ignore the nuisance. Don’t Agee to debate him Biden...yea he will attack your cognitive abilities but he does anyway. Take HIS POWER away from him. You DICTATE TO HIM!!
DENY TRUMP, please Biden take charge &amp; deny him the opportunity to spew lies. Don’t debate!! Trump is trying to cast doubt about the election, you cast doubt on his worthiness...just not worth it. DENY TRUMP ....ignore him &amp; his grievances!!
Deny Trump exists...Biden don’t debate. Don’t stoop to Trump’s  level, you are better than this. DENY TRUMP &amp; you will deny him the win in November!!
How about we just IGNORE Trump and take control starting with Biden NOT debating this liar. Not ACKNOWLEDING a President that wants to delay the election...delay Trump his wish for a debate!!! He is just not worth it!! DENY Trump exists.
Especially as the USPS union supports Biden!!!
Bahahahaha!  That tells you everything.  She's probably thinking why in the hell did dems pulling the strings choose him?  It should have been me!!  And in all honesty, Liz is a hell if alot smater than Biden even in his prime.
Someone’s gonna be crying again in November. It’s mind boggling to me that you guys didn’t learn the first time. Ugh ok Biden is winning just like Hillary was! And your a guy that’s a feminist GTFOH.
I will not read the article! There is no reason not to vote fir Biden on earth.
The Trump supporters think Trump is going to trip Biden up, make him stutter, maybe say a gaffe of some sort (not that Trump’s entire speaking part won’t be a gaffe, but they won’t care). They want the spectacle, not the information.
basically what the world is telling you is that what ever you say or do from this point in will be an act of treason. Barr does not have shit in Biden that wont help Donnie cheat to win. So what ever u do we will know u cheated.
If Biden refuses to debate Trump for whatever inane reasons they come up with, trust me that will finish off Biden as it proves he can’t lead&amp; there’s no VP hopeful in sight that is capable of being president.  You dems have dug yourself a hole.
Kammy will be The Enforcer, hunting down Trump supporters for punishment, Beto the Gun Confiscator, while Bernie, Squad &amp; Poncahantas do the socialist agenda that will destroy us.  Biden will be the Placeholder-in-Chief.
If Biden doesn't want to I don't care. The only purpose would be to display what an incompetent loon IQ45 is. That's another part of the circus that could spin out of control.
Don,  they may arrest Joe Biden in October. Be prepared.
Barr could indict and arrest Joe Biden before the election.  Why won’t you people prepare for that?  Are you that naive?
You people are underestimating this.  It’s entirely possible that Barr will arrest Joe Biden before the election.  Why won’t you think like Republicans?
Yep! Vote Biden to get us out of the mess you put us in.
What’s the connection between President Clinton and Biden again?  My mom voted for no one in the 2016 election because of Bill’s indiscretions, but this is a bridge too far. #TrumpIsAChildRapist
YezMaam! Anybody that wished Obama had an additional 8 years...vote Biden. #NoQuestionsAsked
My understanding of that is that Biden was one of many dealing with Ukraine corruption and it’s been distorted into some payola thing. I do think Hunter was paid a lot for whatever services he provided Burisma.
You destroyed America's economy and killed $150,000 of us.  You want us to believe that Joe Biden will do worse than that?   #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Oh, Biden did pretty well in several of the debates against 10 other excellent candidates. Trump has issues making sense in his speeches.
He will definitely try to make sound like Biden’s is scared to debate.  But we all know he projects and he is scared to death to debate Biden. He will retreat to his bunker before debating Biden.
If joe biden walked out his front door and took a shit on his front lawn and then did the hokey pokey i would still vote over #TrumpIsACrybaby
Lt Col Vindman is an American #Hero for speaking truth to power. He exposed Trump for who he is; a lawless, corrupt president.  Once #Biden is elected, maybe he'll name  Ambassador to Ukraine. That would chap Trump's ass.
The only fraud is you trying to make a separate poll because all news media has biden in the lead in the polls you scared of the truth you need validation with your brainwashed supporters
So what?  What is he going to actually do to stop the election and/or prevent Biden (if he wins) from becoming President? He can say whatever he wants, but its the states that run the elections and Congress that accepts the results. He can cause chaos, but can he stop anything?
From your lips to God's (and Biden's) ears
It's time for Biden to make his announcement! Re: Kamala Harris being ambitious, Biden isn't??? We don't need a doormat in that position---we have one of those right now!
Oh my my my !!!! The latest in sad Liberal Socialist quantum arguing with those who are real Americans and are tired of Democrats base line to get Biden elected at any cost even utilizing Marxist orgs to do their bidding! Soooo - it’s MAGA TRUMP 2020 onward and upward! HOOORRRRA!
It's fascinating that Biden gets an intelligence briefing, right away tells his people to stop using Tik Tok, then like a week later Trump is like 'Oh $hit! People shouldn't use Tik tok!'
This is not an accurate account of the article. It's not saying she'll be disloyal, just distracted by the fact that her own campaign will begin about 2 years into the new Biden administration.
A veep candidate with less national ambition could act more freely and more deferentially toward Biden. The “anointed front runner” baggage won’t be as heavy. These advantages could help Biden with his agenda without hurting the party’s prospects in 2024.
Wait, so Trump literally is friends with the horrible people. But then you say Biden is disqualified because he's in the same party as someone associated with the horrible people? Terrific stuff.
Hey, show me the photos of Biden with them? Oh wait...it's Trump that has literally dozens of photos and videos with them? UH OH!
Trump IS worse.  You guys are worse with Benghazi, Hillary's emails and Hunter Biden.  Also, 'libtard' shows you to be a #Cult45 member.  If you want to be taken seriously, drop the Qanon rhetoric.

Really, huh?  Trump has murdered everyone who has died in the US the last 3.5 yrs.  Talk about bloody tiny hands. ❤️.  MAGA bc Biden has nothing in his brain!
Delay and automatically put in Biden the poll leader
I've no doubt there are racially insensitive videos of Biden.  He's been in government since the 70's.  Do you have any racially insensitive videos of Biden in the last 20 years; since the millennium?  We've all learned, grown and changed in the intervening decades.
You think Biden isn't going to ask?  The scenario here is Trump trying to remain in office beyond his Constitutionally mandated term end on Jan 20th, at which point Biden or Pelosi (most likely) would take the oath. Then they're going to be issuing orders.
Donald Trump’s threat to delay or change the 2020 election is empty and absurd. Our election will be on November 3rd and it’s more important than ever to get out to vote and elect Joe Biden.

It was proven false biden supports defunding the police
The riots and violence is not Biden’s fault
The reason this won't work is republicans have been telling us for years that they're all the same -- corrupt.  Even if Americans think that maybe the Obama administration did something wrong, they'll figure Trump is way worse and Biden will be better for America!
#NobodyLikesTrump Just a joke of a frail, sniveling loser. Vote Biden 2020 &amp; let’s make this country BETTER!!

Are you sure they’re Biden allies⁉️ This sure stinks of Trump/Putin‼️‼️
You would make a fantastic vice president. I hope Biden picks you.
Here's hoping.
“Debates” are just another chance for Trump to rant and lie in the spotlight. Excepting the unlikely scenario where numbers show debates could help Dems lock up the Senate, Biden should pass. Make embedded fact checkers a condition so Trump will chicken out.

I don’t know how else to put it, but listening to Joe Biden speak tells me that not only does he have early onset dementia, but he’s just flat out stupid. How did he get this far?
Donald Trump has accomplished more in 4 years of government than Joe Biden has in 4 decades of government.
Did your daddy really say Biden will hurt God and the Bible?  Now that is the most ignorant thing I’ve ever heard.  Besides the things you post of course!
Your husband is intentionally interfering in an election with no intent to win, just spoil and THIS is the tweet you come up with? SRSLY?!!!!
Biden is afraid of adding a fourth debate?
So if China helps Biden win, shouldn’t that be called even since dad needed Russia’s help to win last time?
Your agenda to spread lies about Biden’s mental status is sad and pathetic. It’s a good distraction from the 160k dead and counting. But go on and spread your BS.
Right right only Biden has gaffes..idiot
Oh dude...Biden wrote that...not Trump...you would be right if Trump wrote it or tried to say it....
The Portland Mayor is powerless in the face of Antifa and BLM terrorists, especially after he defunded the police and refused to call in the National Guard to restore law and order. Welcome to Biden’s version of America should he ever win the Presidency. Vote Trump &amp; Republican.
seriously, do you really think black voters who are going to vote for Biden are going to change their vote to Kanye, who is a tRump supporter? if anything  just lost a bunch of votes as they would rather vote for Kanye than tRump #trumpgate
You seem to be ignoring that Biden got more votes than the other Dem primary candidates.
This is actually a pretty genius and abusive tactic. Trump can put the onus on Biden to agree to an in-person debate even tho he doesn't want to debate (has prev indicated he may or may not show up) and when Biden inevitably says no and wants a cyber debate, he can blame Biden.
That’s what I thought.  Enjoy the Biden Administration.
You’re right.  Trump’s incompetence and unfitness to lead far outpace Biden’s.   Finally someone who understands. 😆😆
I've sent you a bunch of bots this morning -- all coming from the same anti-Biden tweet. All the profile photos are nearly the same. Can you please shut that farm down? Thanks
When YOUR African-American turns on you: Trump allies privately concerned Kanye West’s campaign will hurt the president more than Biden
'Biden's cognitive issues can no longer be ignored'  via
Seriously are Democrats brainwashed it's amazing how they say one thing and do another just like Nancy pelosi blaming Trump for not doing things fast enough on coronavirus but yet it was her dancing around in Chinatown saying to not block people and Joe Biden saying xenophobe wth
A girl can hope because it seems like Biden is running an inept campaign right now.
No, answer the question.  I’ll rephrase: what % of the black population own their own business?  You think Biden was a racist, so your attack falls laughably flat.
Ok, so if the president can’t stop abortions why did you bring that up in the first place. Why does it matter if Biden pro choice?  Your not making sense!!!!
Thank you for reporting on this. As a “Latina” Joe Biden does not speak for me or other Latinos. He speaks  of blacks &amp; Latinos as if we’re a number and how he can pander to us to get our vote and then forget about us. More of the same
Joe Biden winning is the answer you seek.
‘their businesses’??  How many black people own their own businesses?  Kanye???  Biden a racist???  What color is the sky in your world?
To bad Biden can't remember any of the facts.
I'll give you that one. Although if you were to ask a thousand folks on the street, that same question doubt 25% could answer it. Now explain all the times Biden can't finish a sentence or goes off into the twilight zone with his answer. Actually feel sorry for the man.
I'm voting for Biden even if bursts out doing an imitation of Speedy Gonzales.
This election is not who’s best. TBH Biden wasn’t my first choice or second but I’ll be crazy if I think Trump is better then Biden.
Let's have the debates, I 100% agree we should have them. After the first one is one is over I want you to tweet you honestly still believe what you say here in your tweet. I doubt you will though, you'll be to embarrassed when you see that "Hidden Biden" is losing his mind. SAD
Idiot MAGAt neighbor just put up a huge tRump flag. It's on! Gonna get a Biden lawn sign. I won't unfollow them on FB or stop buying GS cookies from their daughter. I WILL repost every Biden/anti 45 thing I can find! #BlueTsunami2020
If Biden is against God, wonder what God has to say about three-times-married adulterers?
Biden doesn’t deserve any intelligent, FREEDOM LOVING, COUNTRY LOVING persons vote.
that will elect trump.  NOPE.  Voting to get rid of trump.  Voting Biden.
Lying Don got that half right. Vote for Biden.
God can take care of himself by directing a meteorite to the back of Biden’s noggin’.
You lost me at “Biden cares”
Please, have Trump order FBI to arrest Biden and all democratic congressmen/women.
DJT clearly  suffers from the proverbial soft bigotry of low expectations, yet, somehow, Biden is held to a higher standard.
We're waaaaaay past ultimatums, though. I personally can't stand Biden, but I love my country and know that means I vote for him. Period.
This is near the top of the list of why it’s critical Biden wins.
Biden is actually a racist and you libs want him in office 😂
With a democratic Senate, Biden will get things done.
This is why I think Biden needs to pick someone with some econ. credibility. Like Warren. Not just check a box. I am not sure Harris or Rice does that.  One shores up judiciary  &amp; the other foreign affairs which is needed, but economy/virus, including healthcare, will be #1 issue

Wonder how likely that would be? Not that I want to find out, but yikes, I can’t even fathom picking Kanye… I mean I’m not a Biden fan, but… wow. Fingers crossed this is non starter in most places.
This leftist loves RCP (and Rasmussen).  I check it every day. Polling showing a tight race may keep the Dems and commentators from getting complacent again and remind Bernie Bros they better show up for Biden. Keep the skewed numbers coming!
Yep. My enthusiasm, while never strong, has dropped with a thud. Biden is blowing this opportunity.
there's gotta be a non-zero chance that Biden picks Jill Ellis as his running mate

Which is it, exactly?  Because we're told if we don't vote Trump we're voting for Biden, and if we don't vote Biden we're giving a vote to Trump  How about, just maybe, the person we vote for is the one that gets our vote.

He just backtracks after a stink is raised. He is a segregationist at heart and has been since he got into politics.

He can't even complete a thought in an interview. Maybe his earpiece is slow as he gets fed his answers. Joe Biden is a segregationist and fought for their cause in schools crafting language still used today to oppose school integration.
Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists. he fought for their cause in schools and helped give America the language that is still used to oppose school integration today.
Going camping off the grid Monday and Tuesday.  Market will still be here Wednesday I hope unless the aliens 👽 come or Biden names Kamala 🤡 🥜
Why would anyone even think this?  Can somebody defend this position or are her marbles just as loose as Joe Biden?
NEWS: Disclosure docs show that one of Biden’s top candidates for VP made big investments in the fossil fuel industry. The revelations come as Biden has faced renewed questions about his climate policies.
Every Biden supporter I know (hundreds) wouldn’t even vote for Kanye for dog poop picker-upper. Most don’t know who or what he is.
But Biden did make African Americans seem like a monolith. Biden's racism is so ingrained, he just can't help himself because that is what he truly believes.
who’s more senile, Biden or Pelosi? She just claimed there are 3.3 million new cases and 70 million deaths from COVID in the last 11 weeks. More deaths than new cases?According 2 CDC there are 4.8 million cases and 160k deaths, total. #PelosiMustGo #shescrazy
Everyday Biden says something racist. Unbelievable. I can go on and on about all his statements. Wake up America. He is handing the election to Trump on a silver platter.
We ditchin Biden y’all
He won't apologize because he doesn't believe he damages people with his words and believes what he says. He has a long record of discrimination going back to trying to stop the busing during the desegregation orders.
Other than Biden she was my least favorite of the primary candidates.
does rocky think we don't realize how big of a dumbass biden is? we see it bud
Its the only reason Biden "Won"
With Biden’s VP choice expected soon, here’s whom he could pick  via  It will reek of Obama-ism and political correctness and will smell worse than a sewer.  Black-Brown-Black, women, liar, hater, puppet, who will it be?
I hope Joe Biden doesn’t campaign at all. I don’t want him getting Covid
Rumor has it that Susan Rice is Biden's choice. Remember that people died and she lied. Four Americans died in #Benghazi attack: #AmbassadorChrisStevens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and #CIAoperatives, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods, former Navy SEALs.
Yeah fuck Joe Biden but there is no way a Democratic Presidential candidate isn't going to have a union bug on the actual physical button
When you KNOW Biden didn’t write it.
Your're the one accusing Dems of hiding Biden when we are in the middle of a pandemic.
LOL. This guy thinks the US provides healthcare to just anyone.  I assume you're voting for Biden as illegal immigration has only increased under Trump.
cue white people cries  “but Biden isn’t inspiring enough... he’ll delay the revolution... i wanted Bernie... both parties are the same... I just wrote an op-ed called The Liberal Case for Trump 2020...”
Have you seen Biden’s interview with Errol Barnett, who asked Biden if he had taken a cognitive test? If you have, have you commented on it? If Trump has said and performed in such an alarming way, would you be silent?As a journalist, you should ask yourself this question.
We all knew it
Live in CO so my ballot comes in the mail  But yes, I would stand in line to cast a vote for Biden
Because who ever wanted a picture taken with Joe Biden?

Exactly. Harris is my second least favorite of all the primary candidates (next to Biden) and so I just assume she will be the VP nomination.

To be clear, anyone who votes for Kanya was never gonna vote for Biden anyhow.  I tend to think that skin color does not dictate intelligence, and no intelligent voters vote for any dude whose wife wants to COMMIT HIM TO THE FUNNY FARM!!

So Trump says he kissed women without their express permission.  But did he?  Where and when?  Biden kisses and gropes CHILDREN without their permission (hundreds of pictures to confirm this obvious fact), and that's okay?  Serious question:  Are you a pedophile?
Biden apologized for yesterdays racist remarks again. How many racist things does he have to say to make people realize he is the racist person on earth. He will not help the black community and has not in 40 years. Trump has done more than any President to help all people.

Wouldn't the "Nazi" be Biden? I mean he's the one that gave a eulogy at an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK funeral.
Conjecture: Dems get Kamala Harris or other "in-pocket" Democrat as running mate, pull bait-and-switch with Biden for health reasons post convention. No Yang, no Sanders. Dems are a hard no on both, which should terrify reasonable young liberals who are "solution focused."
Joe Biden is NOT the agent of change this country desperately needs. He’s there to serve as a vessel for financial and structural stability for the 1%

After thinking about Joe Biden and watching him now for over a year as a candidate, (as an independent voter), I just can't believe that he is the Democratic candidate for President. Seriously, is there someone waiting in the wings to swoop in or a 25th amendment strategy?
Today I learned that if you don't like Joe Biden you're a Trump supporter.

It's true Biden does not excite anyone.  It's also true that trump is both the dumbest, most morally bankrupt person anyone has ever met or heard on a mic.  I ask you: outside Wile E Coyote, has anyone ever called themselves a genius (repeatedly!) who was one?

This is why my original ? was to the Good Dr and NOT his BEEHIVE.  I don't call anyone coons for thinking this way.  I AGREE with A LOT of IT.  I know about the party switch in early 1900s i.e. Southern strategy.  I am aware of policing records of Biden/Harris.  ? was RIGHT NOW.
1. It's faking a stock market comeback right before an election 2. It sets up for the market to totally crash right after Biden wins, falsely putting the blame on Dems 3. It allows Feds to sell corp bonds to foreign powers allowing them to own large amounts of U.S. businesses
Oh, yeah. By noon I'll be a communist, a racist, pro Biden, pro Trump, a patriot, a traitor, fkng incredible.
I did it for Garth Brooks tickets, I can do it for Joe Biden.

Evaluating Joe as a Presidential possibility, but having a hard time being convinced he is a viable candidate. For example, Joe Biden's public statements questioned by the media in past presidential campaigns.
He wasn't trailing Biden for the last 3 years
I love how every time Tr*mp makes shit up about Biden, it makes Biden sound cooler.   Like only in my wildest dreams could I actually vote for someone who would throw all guns into a volcano, turn us into a socialist paradise, and destroy god.
Trump re-election strategies (2020): •They’re all socialists! 👎  •Bidens are corrupt 👎 •Economy is unbeatable 👎 •COVID is Dem hoax 👎 •Uh, we’ll fix economy 👎 •Uh, we beat COVID 👎 •Law &amp; Order 👎 •Antifa’s coming 👎 •Biden is weak 👎 •Biden will take away God 🙄
Sadly, I must agree with JVL.  All of machinery and chicanery of Trumpism will still be in place once Biden is elected, unfettered by the need to even appear to be governing.   Trump unleashed, unbound, unrepentant.
He apologized immediately and it wasn't his point. Biden will say some stupid things from time to time but he's not a racist corrupt compulsive liar and he'll apologize when he says something stupid. You won't get that from the other side.
"West, who has previously voiced support for Mr Trump and is running as an independent, was named on the Colorado ballot on Thursday, the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office confirmed. At least one Republican official assisted West with his filing"
"When it was pointed out to West that it was unlikely he could win November’s poll, and that his campaign was being run as a distraction, he replied: “I’m not going to argue with you. Jesus is King.'"
Last night I kept dreaming about which bumper sticker would be catchier: Biden + Bass or Biden + Harris. Then I hit on Joe and Sue.  I could never make the choice.
I think that Biden's biggest problem is that he has so many great candidates to choose from. Trump, on the other hand, only has one requirement: "Are you loyal to me?"
When I first heard Trump's comments, I thought Biden said something really terrible. What Biden really said, when you come down to it, is that the Black community is more organized than the Latino community. After all, Blacks have been fighting these battles for generations.
The harder the Dems surge left, the more I hear voting Trump. Seems like more to block Biden/socialism than pro-Trump. I live in a major swing state.....
isn't it really funny that Trump supporters are calling out Biden's  microaggressions? a concept they typically drill the left for creating, all while supporting a man known for his macroaggressions... #fucktrump

third party candidates and write-ins. A case might be made for Biden, though I'd probably disagree with it, given his abortion politics.   My editors have a more nuanced discussion about it in this podcast:   I've found Twitter, due to brevity, lacks nuance
Have you shown your father half as much interest in his medical care that you have shown Biden? I know you are kind of the ignored one because you don't have his name &amp; you don't have a vagina, but that reality that you don't SEE your father's brain is rotten fruit is glaring.
So yesterday, a group of women leaders and organizations wrote a letter and sent it out to top news executives.  The purpose: A warning to avoid "stereotypes and tropes" in coverage around Joe Biden's VP pick.  Outlining specific traps the media fall into.  Offering assistance.

The idea that Kanye should suspend his mental illness long enough for Biden to get elected is ridiculous. The run is the disease.
Of course they do, they're losing...BAD! - Trump campaign wants presidential debates with Joe Biden early and often  via
For those in despair, read this article:
They think Biden appeals to average people but he will be run by the radical left as we know if elected.  God knows he’s not capable of running a hot dog stand much less be president.
He’s right though. Biden is not left at all. He and Obama deported more people than any other administration. They didn’t end the drug war. They took us from two wars to seven. They want to prosecute Ed Snowden. These are all ideological conservative policies.
Attempt?   “And by the way, what you all know, but most people don’t, unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”   —Joe Biden
Nope, I know some folks of the conservative persuasion who would never vote for a "crazy commie" like Biden, who also won’t vote for Trump. Their vote for a 3rd party candidate is still a vote against Trump.
Ok Christians....explain to me how Biden is going to "hurt" God...but apparently has no beef with Jesus...?
You’re 100% correct. The Biden people are in such denial about his racism. Biden is just more polite about it than Trump.
Kanye late to the party lol but people mad at him for interference because Biden cant hold his own is funny
Ok... that’s a personal problem. I’m not for Biden, I’m voting to remove an existential threat from the White House. Biden at least has a very decent public platform that I can mostly get behind, and I trust him to put intelligent progressive people in positions of power.
. : Be Very Careful About Biden's Lead on Trump -- he joins  to discuss  the second coronavirus stimulus package and the upcoming Presidential election.
Trump's accusation that Biden is against God and wants to hurt God keeps making me think of the lyrics from Woody Guthrie's very subtle Mean Talking Blues:   "I hated union everywhere, 'cause God likes unions and I hate God!"
Yesterday's state polls by Quinnipiac and Data for Progress are all broadly consistent with Biden leading nationally by ~7-10 points... except the Quinnipiac poll of Kentucky, which has Trump only +9. You'd expect him to be up by 22% there if he's down 10% nationally. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
No one would do what you've done!  Competent presidents would have nipped this in the bud in December of last year.  They wouldn't ignore everything around them for months.  I've been working from home in March and I don't see any end it sight -- until President Biden!
I guess Biden should pick Betty White

I hope she's gonna vote for Biden over Trump because she's a human.
The challenge is that enthusiasm is anti-Trump, not pro-Biden and while he's a nice guy, Biden doesn't seem to get that.
Biden didn't apologize. He clarified. Big difference.
Biden doesn't remember anything...
An all white ticket for this party at this time is unthinkable to me. Surely Biden sees that. I personally don’t know any white women who have this attitude that it has to be a white woman first, but if they are out there they need to get over it. It’s insane.
Just wait and see what weak, feeble Biden does to Santa if he wins! Trump told me so!
So his non apology is an apology, it’s about Trump not Biden, and now Bernie is in the mix?  How far do u have to go to excuse a candidate who is obviously past his sell by date? Jesus Christ talk about any dream will do! You can almost hear Joe shout you got a black VP dammit!

It's so hilarious too, because it's not like there isn't plenty to work with. Biden's record is abysmal. They just don't like dealing with reality or facts and would rather fear monger idiots with absolute nonsense.

And Jill Biden! LOL
Why is CNN afraid of calling it what it is.  Voter Suppression.  Beside you all need to vote for Biden or he may hurt God. Lol.
Amen to that fact  Trump can’t be bought, and the Marxist Democrats hate him for it. Obama, Biden and other Dems all got wealthy feeding at the public trough. They’ve mastered the fine art of screwing the public.
I will vote for Joe Biden regardless, we and our countryCAN NOT sustained 4 more years of Trump!!!
Can you imagine if the Biden team were capable of making this compelling an argument to vote for Biden?
So is Biden saying that black Ameeicans don't have diversity/different attitudes about different things?  Dem are you listening to Joe Biden's comments in these interviews?? He can't put one logical/rational thought together.  Biden is incapable of running this country.  Period.
I feel the same way. I’ll vote for Biden because I love my country but it IS hard to get enthusiastic about him.
Biden was VP for 8 years. Trump is way over exposed as a identity, from daily appearances. If people watch, it will be for the spectacle, not for information.

Black Democrats had a number of credible alternatives to Biden last year if they wanted to support a Black candidate and they largely stuck with Biden, and to think that they'd suddenly bolt for Kanye in the general is... an odd view of voting behavior.

Voting Biden.  I will be that problem and own it.
No one we have elected on the last 20 yrs has been a good leader. We need trained scientists taking on the position but can also clearly understand common sense. However, scientists are too smart to run for office lol. Trump, Biden, Hilary, Bill and Bush all terrible.
Neither you, Joe Biden nor Jo Jorgensen are worthy of my vote.
The party of Joe Biden is the same party of slavery, Jim Crowe, abortion, the KKK, Gov. Wallace.  Re-branded, new packaging, but same condescension and silent hatred of black achievement.
Actually Biden didn’t admit any mistake in this statement, and you’re being rude to someone with English as a second language. Biden’s first statement was clear, but you want us to allow for certain intellectual origami in his words you don’t offer this man from Nigeria... #shame
I think Biden wants to buy everyone an electric Corvette?
I am not fooled for one second. Sad that many MAGAs will hold this as true. But, then everything about trump is Sad.    via
But He didn’t admit any mistake, he blamed his mistake on our misunderstanding of the words he clearly spoke to a demographic he was trying to woo. It’s a typical Biden gaffe, he inadvertently diminished one group while flattering another. Biden should be better than this!
lmfao I’ll vote for biden if he successfully hurts god
This isn’t about Trump, it’s about Biden, he didn’t apologize, apparently it’s our fault we misunderstood what he clearly said. Biden and the  think that anything is better than Trump, even it’s a slightly less racist 70 yr old who still takes the black community for granted.
Where’s the apology in this statement???? The first sentence is a lie, he wasn’t talking about diversity in the black and Latino communities, he literally said the black community lacked the diversity of the Latino community. Repeatedly Biden takes the black community for fools!

Both platform?  Someone's not been paying attention for the last 4 years.  Trump's priorities and platform have been well communicated and unchanged for four years.  What does Biden stand for?  Everything wrong..
So you’re saying Trump has proved that stupidity is not racist so Biden is not racist either for saying stupid things. They are both just stupid old white men that we no longer need running our country. Kick them all out. Term Limits.

Biden is identity politics for people whose kids took their car keys away.
We had Bernie as an option and this is what the DNC chose for us instead. I was thinking that if his VP choice is progressive I would vote for Biden. But I can't, he is just as bad as Trump.
George I loved you as a figure of my childhood but this statement is so far left and not true it makes you look as old and crazy as Biden.
I love him...
I think you have it backwards.  Biden wants Kamala and his staff/advisors have been pushing Rice because they know Kamala is more charismatic than he is and made it clear she wants to be Pres someday by running for the office
Biden is a puppet socialist whose strings are being pulled by Sanders, Warren and AOC in Congress and by the CCP in China. He’s a genuine Manchurian Candidate. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional republic from the militant socialists, i. e., communists.
Biden was also 100% against gay marriage until the SCOTUS ruled on the decision. He suddenly supports their rights to marry.
Biden must say: You lost Mr. President, because you lacked the moral courage to face the reality of the disease.
Biden will compare the Covid/19 results to other recent pandemics and to wars in the 20th century.
Trump will do his China gambit. He do Whataboutism on the Iraq war. Biden's has to attack. Xi is not running for Pres, and neither is George Bush.
And yes, Biden needs a few reliable people on stage with him.
He lives in Neverland. If he calls “laughing stock and pity” respect...
Biden has to be facing him and talking to Trump about Trump's failures. No impaired person can face the consequences of their impairment. If the podiums are wrong, the Biden's people have to turn them.
How about that water? Thank God (who Biden hates) Trump fixed the water.
Maybe because whenever Biden does come out of his basement, he forgets his handlers scripts, where he is, and every time he is covered there is nothing positive he says or does???
I'll never support Biden (or anybody else that Obama pushes). I'm going to vote for the Greens.
Sure. Trump or Biden, same thing. And you idiots who thought that people like me would vote for Hillary keep dreaming. You are going to lose 2020, too. I'm white, over 65, college grad, former bank VP with Mexican relatives.
Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and Black communities
Not true. I hate Trump, but Biden has a HUGE lying issue.
And neither did Biden here. He "clarified." The word "apologize" or "sorry" does not appear in the tweet (that was obviously not written by Biden himself).
the demobrats and leftist socialists like biden and pelosi are doing their best to stop Trumps re-election and they are creating all kinds of chaos to do that to damage the election process.  I wouldn't be surprised if they had a hand in starting the riots
Joe Biden gets away with a lot of crap cos he’s not conservative. This man is always talking down on the black community but he throws his i have a black friend card and everyone forgets
Unserious?? Me? Huh. Bernie decided his friendship w/ Biden matters more than my healthcare or my son's college debt  So, as a white, liberal, college grad granny, I say F him and Biden and all Democrats
Did Joe Biden just give out Conservative Black Brothers and Sisters a new name? The 2020 version of Deplorables? 😯
*Joe Biden's staffers seem much more competent in text
Who is this maniac that thinks Biden is going to hurt God? This maniac is currently our president.
Trump is confusing Biden twitter and Khive for Rose Twitter and Tankies.
Before it is announced I would like to state that I think Biden's pick will be Susan Rice.
Trump threats Biden's religious beliefs. Too bad trump has none. Throwing shade only blocks your vision.
Biden’s killing god and trump is fixing our faucets how could life get any better?
Straight up tho, as a Latino and Black American: Fuck Joe Biden
Healthcare workers of America we have a duty to protect Joe Biden and to report the obvious Elder Abuse of him by the Left.  Please file a formal complaint ASAP.  Poor Joe is being exploited by the Democratic party which is clearly elder abuse.
if ya can’t see Biden’s blatant racism i don’t know what to tell you lol
Don’t feel attacked, your vols didn’t need you to say it thrice! They were always ridin with Biden!
As a healthcare provider I am  bound by law to report elder abuse. So to the handlers of Joe Biden look out!
Trump doesn’t get what being a Christian is or how one is to live as one yet he can say this about a Good and decent man. VOTE for Joe Biden.
Biden doesn’t need my vote. He’s courting Republicans. Why not go phone bank some of them instead of insisting lefties vote for a centrist? He is far close to them than the left.
Yes but Biden having Ana Navarro and Larry Summers on board shows he's serious right?  Jesus fucking Christ why can't you be better
“Biden’s answer was neither definitive nor concise” Nothing he says ever is. His mealy mouthed disingenuous arguments made it clear enough where he stands.
Wow. I thought Cory Gardner and Donald Trump were vying for the dumber than dirt title. Here comes Biden from the rear. 🤦🏻‍♀️
If Kanye hurts Joe Biden's run for presidency, then perhaps the dumbass centrist chucklefucks of the DNC should have coronated a better candidate.
Pretty sure Biden has never heard of Twitter.
DUH, get the straight jacket out y'all - Kanye West Admits Presidential Campaign Aims to Hurt Biden’s Prospects  via
Joe Biden spoke about his Catholic faith Thursday, after President Trump said that a Biden presidency would “hurt God.”   One campaign watcher said he thinks believers should focus on issues.
The R’s don’t have to stop it. Biden literally said he’d veto M4A even if it passed Congress &amp; landed on his desk. If F’ing Representatives represented the majority &amp; voted for it HE would kill it.
Biden told blacks they can’t think for themselves like Hispanics can...what’s to clarify?   Sounds like you agree with Biden.
Biden tells the country blacks can’t think for themselves compared to Hispanics, and “Thailand” is the biggest story?   Still think the media isn’t biased??
I bet Biden knows 2 Corinthians isn't about two Corinthians.
It's entirely unsurprising that Joe Biden has a brain full of ignorant racial stereotypes.
After seeing his recent, mental breakdown over Biden, I am starting to think about voting Biden
Ima just say these 3 things. 1. He’s not crazy. 2. That’s what they do when their own speaks out “calls them crazy” 3. He’ll be better than Joe Biden!
is the best VP for Biden. Of course, I also think she would be a great President.
If Biden cant win because Kanye then he dont deserve to be president.
M4A means M4A, just as GND means GND, as written. Dems like to take progressive buzzwords, water them down beyond recognition, then pretend they support that thing. Biden’s plan leaves millions uninsured &amp; many more who can’t afford their “affordable” healthcare.
if Biden's thumb was on life support and Biden's thumb were on the ballot, I'd vote for Biden's thumb.  Doing anything else only contributes to the total destruction of the United States.
Nothing New - CNN covers for Biden constantly.  CNN has absolutely no credibility left.
What does Biden have going for him?
I have a lot of Republican friends and this is the new normal. A vote for Biden is a vote for American ideals. A vote for Trump is a vote for the end of everything we hold dear. #VoteBiden
So his goal isn’t even to win, it’s to suppress Joe Biden?  Where are all of #KanyeWest’s followers that are making the claim that he’s trying to play Donald?  He’s gonna lead us to 4 more years of the orange menace! #FuckKanye
So?!  Have you noticed there are no rallies &amp; this isn’t a normal election year? Good for Trump for getting his message out anyway possible.  Hey, CNN forgot to report on Biden’s latest insult to African Americans today!
If he came out talking as much shit about Trump as he has about Biden, I’d believe this. He’s barely gone at Trump at all, and there are 1000 things he could easily call out.   Sadly, I don’t trust it.
OK, I'll take one for the team. If you vote for Biden or any Democratic party candidate it will be like eating a poop sandwich then later you will realize that all you have to eat is poop soup. The moral of the story is QUIT EATING SHIT! #MAGA2020
If you got a degree in history and they delete it, then what happens? Will Biden's government reimburse those teachers educational cost? I don't think so and they will not recognize it as a degree that you may be paying back loans for. Not cool. A Trump win is critical in Nov.
OK, I'll take one for the team. If you vote for Biden or any Democratic party candidate it will be like eating a poop sandwich then later you will realize that all you have to eat is poop soup. The moral of the story is QUIT EATING SHIT! #MAGA2020

Joe Biden thinks all blacks are alike and vote Democrat.  If you don't vote Democrat, you ain't black.  Now, who is the racist?
Biden responds to criticism  Trump is an asshole.
trump is not only an asshole, but a stupid one too.  He has to know Biden has been religious all his life and trump’s stupid comments only magnify the religious differences of the 2
This poor, mentally ill man doesn't even realize that the GOP is using him to take away the African-American vote from Biden.  Drastic tactics beneath all involved.
Joe Biden would hurt America.
Next Trump is gonna say Biden wants Willie Horton as his Attorney General.
gonna be honest, if biden manages to lose his 3rd presidential attempt to donald trump its gonna be the funniest shit ever.

Or hear the word trump
Then go away
I don’t care if he picks a bar of soap for VP.  I’m voting for Biden.
So were you and Obama. A Biden presidency will be a revival of the war on fossil fuels.
Beautiful Colorado!! And I don't need to hear a debate, I don't need to know who his VP is and I don't need more time, I will vote for Biden no matter what!!!
As Trump is setting up his argument if he fails- mail-in voter fraud, Biden’s lining up Bernie as his failure excuse. Bernie could go on bended knee &amp; individually ask every person who ever supported him to vote Biden &amp; it would still not be enough. They don’t get it’s POLICIES!
Biden is literally the most religious person in the entire government. A lifelong, devoted Catholic, not a womanizing, fake Christian like Trump
Joe Biden is an Alyssa Milano Democrat.
So, today Trump, a man that gassed peaceful protesters so he could hold a Bible upside down, said that Joe Biden, a God fearing religious man, is going to HURT the Bible &amp; GOD!     must be the stupidest most politically inept IDIOT to ever defile the WH?
Not voting for Biden.  Not voting for Trump.
I'll be voting by Mail in Colorado, but not for Biden.
I would have done that for Bernie -- but  no, I'm not voting for Biden. F the Democrats
Oh, do we want to compare Biden's mispronunciations one-for-one versus Trump's? OK, I'm in. You go first. This is gonna be easy.
Really? We currently have a president who cannot pronounce Thailand, Yosemite, Tanzania, Nambia, Diversity, Ulysses, and so many other things on a daily basis and you think that Biden is worse? Maybe YOU should take a cognitive test.
Ideal Scenario:  Joe Biden will announce Susan Rice as his running mate  And then on January 21, 2021 will forget his way to the White House

I hate Trump. I am voting for Jo Jorgensen, unless I really like Biden's vp pick
“Trump bad! Reps bad too!” Doesn’t explain or justify Dems not listening to their own voters &amp; the majority of Americans as a whole. Expect better, demand better, or you’ll never get it. Biden said he’d veto M4A even if it passed Congress, while 88% of Dems support. Explain that
Yes. Biden can speak and do so eloquently and with care and sincerity. Your Herr  trump hates America.
If Biden can hurt the Christian god then either he’s more powerful than their god, or their god is a pussy.
Agreed, Biden is a devout Catholic and Trump can't spell devout Catholic
I believe Biden May also have the power to destroy yoseminites.  Just saying.
Trump Campaign Asks Biden to Agree to Move Debates After Commission Says No  Giuliani is the one who is outdated. The man is not longer relevant and actually a criminal waiting to be tried for high crimes and misdemeanors.
Right,  can't condone not voting for Biden.
This is a fabulous and effective campaign ad.  The folks working for Biden are hitting home runs with great ads!
Biden is the most racist person on earth. He has a proven track record to prove it, just watch his videos going back 40 years. It is Aug 6th and he probably does not remember what he said today. Just saying.
Despite the cozy relation that he has with the press, Biden is constantly walking back one of his statements. What kind of POTUS would this senile old man make? Laughable, if not such a serious possibility.
Let’s be honest. We can all use the propaganda machine upping Biden.... but why donate to republicans, establishment, nevertheless undercover oligarchs?
Trump is more Fascist, Biden is slightly more Neo-Lib
Here is a scary hypothetical scenario: The DNC gets Biden elected and whoever his running mate is, could the plan be that he steps down immediately because of health issues, then that person is President and Nervous Nancy is Vice President. Dang, think about that. Just saying.
Trump Is Anxious That Joe Biden Is Going To Pick Kamala Harris For VP  Then do it. Didn’t want Biden either. Do it, ⁦
I love this video! This should be played over and over again! As all the videos he contradicts himself! Biden's camp has so many videos they can use for their campaign!
Biden (or whoever wrote his speech) is right that we are in a fight for the soul of our country.  However, he is on the wrong side of the fight, and he needs to repent of his wicked beliefs &amp; actions and come back to his baptized faith.
Actually, though, I want a fair Biden/trump election where Biden MOPS THE FLOOR with trump and wins by such a LANDSLIDE that there’s no reason to audit the election.
Biden’s one tough MF if he can hurt god!😂
I can't believe you would even consider voting for Biden!!
Nice try Joe Biden’s handlers ;)
If you vote for Biden you are a racist. There is no wiggle room.
Why do you need to back anybody besides your preference until Biden makes a choice? I'll happily back Harris - if she's the candidate. Until then, I'll continue to lobby for Warren because - wait for it - I "feel she's the best choice." Cheers!
Trump falsely says Biden, a practicing Catholic, is "against God"  Again, trump is making false statements. The man is just disgusting and can not be believed about anything. How does he live with himself? lonely for sure.
If  knew anything about or believed the bible he wouldn't have uttered this drivel:  #ResistanceTaskForce #beattrump2020.
it is sad watching what they are putting Joe Biden through #IngrahamAngle
Why can't we just wait for Biden to announce his running mate? Are we fucking children who can't wait for Christmas morning? Pitting these women against each other, constantly asking him and them who it's gonna be, JFC, people, patience is a virtue.
Wait, Joe Biden actually said that?
Biden faces backlash for comparing diversity in African American, Latino communities  trump wishes Biden said something bad. Trump is so desperate he is now making up stories that disparage Biden. Good luck with that idea. Trump is so bad at his statements.
Biden is the only dude not coming out from hiding Jack except when he's spinning stories about all the things he never did.
Not sure I get the furor over Biden’s comments today. It is true that the history of slavery is more intrinsic to most Black Americans than any single thing binds the Latin population.

Can’t believe you’d vote for Biden. Emotions aside, do the right thing.
Lol. Who is she gonna appeal to that isn't already voting for Biden? Complete waste of time haha
As we all know, Joe didn’t write this.  I doubt he even realizes that he said what he said. Let’s end this charade, horrible sham, being perpetrated on the American people.  Everyone can see Biden disintegrates daily. No matter how much u hate Trump, he will win.
Do you think anyone believes Joe Biden who ripped off America promoted abortion raised his no good son Hunter is a man of deep faith.  Not one person.  None
I will be surprised if Biden makes it to the election #IngrahamAngle
#Biden  DAMAGE THAT CAN'T BE UNDONE !
Why would Biden give #Trump one debate...its like talking to a monkey with a lobotomy...what topics could be discussed??? Sesame Street?
Yeah, I'm rather surprised you feel Biden "decided."
First leaving my home and driving around is not a thing since March. Also I think Biden has learned that he does not need to do much except let the Orange Guy talk. That is all the camp he needs.
So VP Pence, are you in on the President's "Biden is against God" statement? Are you? You evangelical hypocrite. #PenceIsAHypocrite
Personally, I think #Dotard is bluffing like he always does. His handlers wouldn't want him out there against Biden. He's been a total embarrassment &amp; more so than usual lately.  #TrumpIsALaughingStock of the world!

We are beating a dead horse (trump), he will be ousted in Nov. Unless Biden falls over from a heart attack, Trump will lose. It will be proven that white nationalists were involved in stoking the fire to promote looting and violence.
About as dumb as Biden wanting a black VP to try and capture the voters Obama DOD.
Who said this about Biden, a Putin paid twitter bot or the president of the United States? "Take away your guns, take away your Second Amendment. No religion, no anything. Hurt the Bible. Hurt God. He’s against God. He’s against guns. He’s against energy."

Donald Trump claims Joe Biden is 'against God;' Biden aides call Trump a hypocritical divider  trump continues to be vile and disoriented. He is clueless when he is attempting to attack anyone he cares to. Just a pouty child.
IIRC, The bible mentions fornication. Which Biden is well aware of, especially around kids and on camera.
Stupid Biden
Jesus, dude. Again with this garbage? Next you’re going accuse Joe Biden of five bankruptcies and having a felon personal lawyer who paid hush money to a porn star.
Biden gaffe
It is a ploy by the Trump organization so people vote for him instead of Biden which takes votes away to help trump win. It's another desperate way that Trump is trying to cheat the election, pathetic and ridiculous
Trump has hit the pocket books of both the drug companies and the military industrial complex in the course of a month. I get why a lot of people hate him...but has Pelosi or Biden ever done anything like that in the last 40 years?
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, says he did not mean to suggest community is a 'monolith'
Translation: I’m looking for any reason I can find to not vote for Biden.
Were you listening to this guy before you fire off insults? Typical leftist Democrat 😆

Should Joe Biden fail to debate President Trump at least three times, it amounts to an admission that he is unable to carry out the duties of President.
#Hannity if Biden is elected it will be determined that anything that shoots a bullet will be an assault weapon

Biden is scared of Trump
But yet Biden can destroy God and all from his basement. Powerful man. 😂😂😂
If Joe Biden wanted our votes so bad he'd actually support the things we want.  Since he won't I have to assume that he doesn't need my vote

You just can't make this stuff up what Biden says. He is the most racial person on earth. Just saying.
Joe Biden hates black people. He has now said you ain’t black if you don’t vote for him. You have no diversity-you’re all the same. I just don’t understand.
That the DNC tries to keep Husk of Biden as candidate shows in how low regard they hold their own voters.   Anyone who votes for this charade is a lemming...a sheep of a lemming
Biden will have his own version of, "Have you decency, Senator?"
It won't be a debate. Trump will make accusations and insults. Joe Biden will talk about Trump's record.
#Hannity waiting to see my first Biden yard sign in Denver area
The Pope wants us to vote fur Biden
Right now it is 50/50 Biden does as well.
Obviously Joe Biden, an authentic if imperfect Christian, cannot "hurt God." Also: the God of the Christian faith is a God who vulnerably hurts with those who hurt. Who weeps. Who bleeds. I don't think Trump knows that God.
Did I hear kanye has a running mate before biden?
Huh...what did you say???? We are doomed, Trump or Biden, we are doomed

Secretly hoping that Biden is currently filming a how-to YouTube video on how to hurt God.
Uhmm, are you accusing Obama or Biden or the NBA of murder? You do realize this has happened under a Trump presidency?
Fuck Trump and Biden
It seems like the obvious voting strategy (at the national level) is "Biden plus Republicans in the Senate to check him." I suspect the outcome will be "Biden plus the Senate Republicans take a shellacking."

At this point, I believe there is a staffer that's collecting a paycheck, but secretly a Biden vote, that is setting these gems up for us.
Neither Joe Biden nor Barack Obama is our president right now and what the NBA players think doesn't mean anything. Trump is president and the violence has only gotten worse since he took office.
I did. Charlemagne had questions, Bidens time was up, charlemagne frustrated asks biden to have a conversation when he comes to New York.  Biden appaled that a black man was treating him as an equal responds with his superior knowledge on being black.  The 1994 omnibus crime bill

You are going to lose with that attitude!  Obama, Biden and athletics are not the president.  All trump wants to do is call out a bunch of thugs acting as police  officers, using tear  and violence.  Trump is showing his true colors.   He is a buffoon, not a leader!
1st debate: Biden should say Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV and walk off the stage
Best Biden commercial so far- hopeful and looking toward the future
Donald Trump vs Joe Biden is the worst decision the US people have had to make since Donald Trump vs Hillary Clinton
Perfect example... If Trump would have said it the conservatives would have all been saying "Well, what he really meant it you should be supporting your community" or some such.... Since Biden said it it's  all "Biden is racist"...  It's all politics and spin.
I’m with you HW. These people that can’t make up their minds, want to see who the VP is, think Biden is the worst of 2 evils do not impress me. Either you are for America or you are for Trump. It’s so easy for me.
Biden Supports Free Coronavirus Tests And Vaccines For Undocumented Immigrants
Trump bragging about “acing” a test designed to diagnose early onset dementia (which itself may be a sign of dementia), while pointing out that no doctor had deemed a dementia test is necessary for Biden...
Harry Truman. Dwight Eisenhower. John Kennedy. George HW Bush. Physical and moral courage. And Joe Biden. Courage is dealing with tragedy without crumbling.
What difference does it make? You’ll defend him no matter what we tell you. It’s sad when Christians support a man who lies about being Christian. He couldn’t even come up with a Bible verse when asked. Joe Biden is a devout Catholic who attends mass. trump is a devout liar.
This is one of the dumbest things Two Corinthians Trump has ever said about Joe Biden.
God says “shut up Donnie”
I keep seeing these posts about Biden and the Dems.  I completely get them.  I seriously do.  My question is what is the plan for RIGHT NOW.  If you are highlighting how Biden and the Dems haven't served us well (they haven't), what is the option 90 days before the election?
Joe Biden’s dementia is the only thing progressive about him.
I think the Biden VP search is being hyped all out of proportion by the media, because that's what they do. Of course, picking a good candidate is important. But I haven't seen any name on the long list that wouldn't be better than 100% of those Trump could name as a VP
This is also a problem, because I feel that too many will fall for this:
Trump and Biden are three years apart.
Joe Biden might not have liked Senator Harris picking on his busing positions during the Dem debates, but he may thinking it would be nice to have that aggression on his team.
Who was going to vote for Biden, but is now reconsidering because Ye’s in it?
“You ain’t black unless you ain’t diverse, come on man”. Joe Biden
Joe Biden is a moderate republican dude. Get it together. How about you read his policies instead of trump tweets. He isn't going to get rid of guns. He is the status quo canidate. Much to many peoples dismay. Donald trump is the covid canidate. Vote for who you wish fool.
Whomever translates in sign language for Joe Biden needs to ask for a raise because deaf people think they are being punkd with his gibberish.
Best of luck to you guys, there is still time for Biden to get my vote but as of now he doesn't. Trump will never get my vote.
Biden: He’s not a psychopath   is a little better than:  Biden: He’s against nearly everything I stand for but what am I gonna do?
“When it was pointed out that he actually can’t win in 2020—that he won’t be on enough ballots to yield 270 electoral votes—West replied: “I’m not going to argue with you. Jesus is King.”
This is not what is going to bring down Joe Biden.  It's reaching as hard as they can to find something, anything to stick to Biden.   COVID19 is what is on America's mind, and this is meh!
The funniest part about  saying Biden will "Hurt the Bible. Hurt God. He's against guns. He's against energy. " is I haven't been to church in never, but that's what your sermons are like? God, guns, and energy?  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity  #FoxNews
It means his staff still has more schooling to do with Biden. Simone, where are you??? He needs more help about the diversity of Black folks in America! Our diversity is much more complex than when LBJ was president!
Rhetorical question? I'll answer it anyway. To peel Black votes away from Biden.
We talking about Kanye sabotaging this election but we really need to talk about how Biden's stupid ass is doing that his own damn self
Without truckers this economy will grind to a complete halt. people will starve, lose their jobs and resort to theft and even murder to survive. This is exactly what demonrats want. Vote for Biden and this is what you will get x 10.
Wait until people hear Biden speak for more then one minute. It will be over
Does that mean Biden is the new God now? Is that how it works?
I’m only voting for Biden if he ends Mars too!
He wrote the crime bill and patriot act, was key in getting dem support for iraq, part of the Obama admin that oversaw detention camps, was part of that legislation in the early 2000’s, part of the Honduras coup, like Biden being bad goes on and on. Makes HRC look angelic
YOU'RE NOT VOTING FOR TRUMP, YOU'RE NOT VOTING FOR BIDEN. DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE VOTING FOR THAT MENTAL CASE KANYE
Obviously the party thinks they don't need to win our votes to win this election. They fight us independents more than they fight the republican party. If they even cared a little they would at least try to appeal to the M4A crowd even Biden said he will not let it happen.
Not for Biden.
Joe Biden is a fucking idiot too lmfao 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
What quantifiable concessions has the Sanders/Biden “progressive” task force actually yielded?   Biden hasn’t even committed to adopting any of the major recommendations.   Just that he would “review” them. Why are we to think that this will suddenly change after he’s in office?
Oh yes, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden clone. WTF are you even on about?
So Joe Biden said that the African-American isn't diverse because AFRICAN-Americans' ancestors are from Africa, but Hispanic-Americans can have ancestors from Spain, Mexico, Brazil, etc.  How is that insulting?  Who is insulted?
Joe Biden is a racist. Pass it on.
If Biden wins, he will not have the power to get rid of the second amendment. Unlike you Biden knows that he won’t have total authority. He actually understands the US constitution.
Could it have been the rare exception of Black people who don’t think alike that Biden spoke so eloquently of today?
LIAR!   HOW DARE YOU IMPLY THAT BIDEN HATES GOD.  YOU ARE THE ONE THAT HATES GOD.  BIDEN IS A DEVOUT CATHOLIC. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT,  EVEN YOU!     YOU WILL LIE AND CHEAT TO GET RE- ELECTED.  HOPE GOD PUNISHES YOU FOR ALL YOUR LIES AND SCHEMES!
Biden is a good Catholic—A Good One!! Raised in Catholic Schools &amp; taught Ethics, Empathy 4 the Poor &amp; Disabled, all individals are = in God’s Eyes &amp; Respect 4 all Religions!!! Good Values unlike #Barr &amp;  Who’re LIARS &amp;  DIRTY POLITICIANS!!! BIDEN KNOWS HIS BIBLE!

That's actually all around awesome guy Brendan Fraser in a robot suit.  That's right bucko, Brendan Fraser is Joe Biden's dad.
They certainly should apologize. Bigtime. And while they're all at it, Trump shouldapologize for saying that devoted Catholic Joe Biden is "against God". Will any of these apologies happen? Highly doubtful.
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
Shocker they don’t want Biden to debate, wonder why?
My lamp...and it doesn’t work ... just like Joe Biden.
No, your guns will NOT be taken away. And, Joe Biden wants to allocate MORE $ to police dep’ts. Don’t believe this douchenozzle. 864511320
People on here defending Biden look incredibly stupid. "Well Latinos are diverse, duh." Like, we know that was dumb of him to say, but also not the part that is outrageously fucked.
Accusing Joe Biden — a man of deep Catholic faith — of being in effect “Godless” is an affront to humanity.
Whoever it is be prepared to support her and work like hell to make Biden our next POTUS! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Holy shit Biden is God-Tier now?!!
Biden claims to be a Catholic but is for abortion up to  birth and if pushed he would probably go further that seems to be the next step, after birth.  Catholics are anti abortion so he isn’t really a Catholic.
The President literally just said Biden hates God. Delete this shit.
So you're willing to put up with the orange, Adderall addicted nightmare, who brags about basic cognitive scores and told the country to inject disinfectant as he leads us into an authoritarian state all because... you might not like Biden's VP?
He’s against energy too.  What is it with this guy and energy? Hillary was low energy, now Biden is against energy.
Joe Biden is Beatrix Kiddo.
just leaving this here for you. Love that Ohio speech “Biden is against Guns, against God” and he’s going to “hurt God” you got yourself a real religious man there. I’m sure God is smiling down on this hypocrite..
OMG‼️With Biden, the sky is falling; President Chicken Little is omniscient. The, “stable genius,” knows all; sees all. Run for cover, the Dems are going to, “ruin America.” But not much left to ruin after Trump.  #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie
#TheFive Joe Biden is a catholic just like Nancy Pelosi
No one wants to see another OBAMA BIDEN CLINTON administration. DNC evidently never got the message., They thought the fix was win with TRUMP RUSSIA.
Still baffling that the leaders of the free world, the most powerful nation on earth, are giving people a choice of Biden or Trump as president.
And also it's a bunch of stuff that biden won't even do because he's just another neoliberal centerist like the rest of the DNC
Wow! Why does she even have a voice? If she doesn’t vote for Biden, her family should disown her.  #meghanmccain is a TRAITOR
“Biden,He’s against God, against guns”. Does anyone believe God is for guns? I never got that message from the Bible.. how does a human “hurt God” exactly? His idiots just eat this crap up..
Biden actually goes to church. He actually believes in God.  And yet no support from fellow people of faith. Weird......
Progressives Urging Progressives to Vote Biden (then challenge him one day one of his presidency)
"Biden hurts God"  Dude, don't we have to vote for the guy who can hurt God?  I mean maybe he wasn't talking about The God. Just some little Greek or Egyptian god. Little "g".  But still, that's pretty impressive. I think I will vote for that guy no matter what, right?
"The rest will take care of itself" can be translated to i won't have to worry about a Biden presidency, so I can go back to brunch.
Biden dodges another bullet.
This is what Trump said today about Joe Biden, a practicing Catholic. What church does Trump go to? Trump plays golf on Sundays, right? How can Biden "hurt God"? Does Trump sound like a leader is this video?
Well in all fairness Trump believes he is God. And Biden is against him.
i think so, Competing with Soros billions has to be done to save this country from the Alinsky nightmarish idea by Joe Biden.
"Biden has been comfortably ahead in the polls all summer long. What my need to turn this into a horserace presupposes is...maybe he hasn't?"
The whole post is negative about Biden &amp; then you chose to be negative  about his wife. So ..your post is a tad hypocritical. The Trump campaign has tried this false repeatedly. You chose to comment on it. Bye now.
Say you ARE voting for Biden. That is more clear.ROFL! Wow. If Biden can “hurt God,” that implies Biden is MORE POWERFUL THAN GOD. 🤦🏼‍♀️
Rumor has it that Susan Rice is Biden's choice. Remember that people died and she lied. Four Americans died in #Benghazi attack: #AmbassadorChrisStevens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and #CIAoperatives, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods, former Navy SEALs.
Have you seen Biden’s interview with Errol Barnett, who asked Biden if he had taken a cognitive test? If you have, have you commented on it? If Trump has said and performed in such an alarming way, would you be silent?As a journalist, you should ask yourself this question.
Why is Joe Biden at a Royals game?
CV Calls on Biden to Condemn Attacks on Church – CatholicVote org
Trump claims Biden 'no longer worthy of the Black Vote' in wake of diversity comment
They think Biden appeals to average people but he will be run by the radical left as we know if elected.  God knows he’s not capable of running a hot dog stand much less be president.
He’s right though. Biden is not left at all. He and Obama deported more people than any other administration. They didn’t end the drug war. They took us from two wars to seven. They want to prosecute Ed Snowden. These are all ideological conservative policies.
You’re 100% correct. The Biden people are in such denial about his racism. Biden is just more polite about it than Trump.
It's not 'designed' to hurt Biden unless he's guilty of something, so no worries, right?  Oh and it is not advisable to release reports until they are finished.
An all white ticket for this party at this time is unthinkable to me. Surely Biden sees that. I personally don’t know any white women who have this attitude that it has to be a white woman first, but if they are out there they need to get over it. It’s insane.
Amen to that fact  Trump can’t be bought, and the Marxist Democrats hate him for it. Obama, Biden and other Dems all got wealthy feeding at the public trough. They’ve mastered the fine art of screwing the public.

Biden for President ads are truly despicable. That crying lady blaming her grandma’s death on President! President Trump initiated the travel ban within 10 days of the first case while every other leader shamed him.
George I loved you as a figure of my childhood but this statement is so far left and not true it makes you look as old and crazy as Biden.
Biden is a puppet socialist whose strings are being pulled by Sanders, Warren and AOC in Congress and by the CCP in China. He’s a genuine Manchurian Candidate. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional republic from the militant socialists, i. e., communists.
Who is this maniac that thinks Biden is going to hurt God? This maniac is currently our president.
Trump threats Biden's religious beliefs. Too bad trump has none. Throwing shade only blocks your vision.
Don’t feel attacked, your vols didn’t need you to say it thrice! They were always ridin with Biden!
Hell yes!  I’ll walk over broken glass to vote for Biden!
Trump Campaign Asks Biden to Agree to Move Debates After Commission Says No  Giuliani is the one who is outdated. The man is not longer relevant and actually a criminal waiting to be tried for high crimes and misdemeanors.
Despite the cozy relation that he has with the press, Biden is constantly walking back one of his statements. What kind of POTUS would this senile old man make? Laughable, if not such a serious possibility.
Trump falsely says Biden, a practicing Catholic, is "against God"  Again, trump is making false statements. The man is just disgusting and can not be believed about anything. How does he live with himself? lonely for sure.
Biden faces backlash for comparing diversity in African American, Latino communities  trump wishes Biden said something bad. Trump is so desperate he is now making up stories that disparage Biden. Good luck with that idea. Trump is so bad at his statements.
Donald Trump claims Joe Biden is 'against God;' Biden aides call Trump a hypocritical divider  trump continues to be vile and disoriented. He is clueless when he is attempting to attack anyone he cares to. Just a pouty child.
It is a ploy by the Trump organization so people vote for him instead of Biden which takes votes away to help trump win. It's another desperate way that Trump is trying to cheat the election, pathetic and ridiculous
It’s agonizing for her. You know she’s going to vote for him even though she says she adores Biden. She is toxic.
Donnie, that ain’t TRUE. That is a LIE. See there is a difference. Joe Biden has no interest in taking my guns or anybody’s guns for that matter.
Biden is for full term abortion, hard pass.
The problem I have with Biden is his support for third term abortion. Hard No for me as a Christian
Could it have been the rare exception of Black people who don’t think alike that Biden spoke so eloquently of today?
My lamp...and it doesn’t work ... just like Joe Biden.
Biden claims to be a Catholic but is for abortion up to  birth and if pushed he would probably go further that seems to be the next step, after birth.  Catholics are anti abortion so he isn’t really a Catholic.
They could  have been mistaken and the account was “rare exception” of black people who don’t think alike (according to Biden).
If your classroom is still self-contained, you are not the right spokesperson for Joe Biden.
Biden getting the democratic nomination really (and i stress really) fucking sucks
Biden is already doing a good job of siphoning off black voters with his racist comments about them.
Ian Miles Cheong ( Tweeted: Latinos have diversity of thought unlike black people who all think alike, says Joe Biden.
trump is that desperate he needs another person on the ballot to take votes away from Biden, and even that will not help him get destroyed on Nov 3rd, 89 days from today!
Joe Biden is an elderly Michael Scott. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Wonder why they rejected it? Could it be Biden isn’t capable of a debate with a two year old. Even when he was coherent no way could he debate Trump. This will be priceless!
I think all that plastic surgery has affected her brain oh.... wait or was that Biden.
joe biden really said "I don't give a fuck about who my vp is and neither should you. now look at my cool cars". mad respect honestly
This is why all of you are so fundamentally dishonest
Biden wants to re engage with Iran. This is against Trump policy. His surrogate, John Kerry has been meeting them privately. They are our sworn enemy. If Biden wins and one of his transition team reaches out to Iran informing of a new policy direction should this be Logan Act ?
I don’t see color. I’m telling anyone that will listen that if you want to vote for trump then vote for kayne because it’s the same thing. If you want to vote for democrats then vote for Biden. Really really really extremely simple. #biden2020 #kayneismentallyill #trumpvirus
GOP is using kayne like a puppet to steal black voters from Biden. Keep your eyes open. If you want trump again then vote for kayne as kayne cannot win.
Kayne west is doing what Ralph Nader did which is split the vote and steal votes from democrats. Kayne is there simply to steal the black vote from Biden to help out trump. If you are a trump supporter then vote for kayne or trump. If you support democrats then Biden
How exactly is Biden going to get the virus under control? He can’t even get out of his basement
Check out BIDEN 2020's video! #TikTok
I put down my marker a month ago that Biden’s VP pick will be replaced on the ticket.
This is another attempt by Republicans because they're so desperate to lose the election do you get people to vote third-party which takes away votes from Biden, it's comical the depths that Republicans will go to cheat the election!
Trump Debunks Own Attack on Biden Allegedly Ducking Debates: 'He Has Not Said That'  If trump were to debate it would be a liefest for sure. The man is dishonest, lies his ass off and will say anything that comes to mind. The man is worthless as a leader.
Trump Debunks Own Attack on Biden Allegedly Ducking Debates: 'He Has Not Said That'  If trump debated he would be a total failure. The GOP is scared shitless to see him on the stage showing how pathetic and unqualified he really is.
As Sen Graham so eloquently pointed out....he was a high ranking official in a Presidential transition team.  If Joe Biden wins will he be able to have his surrogates talk to Chinese officials about their changes in foreign policy without risk of a Logan Act charge?
It’s just so funny how people try to shift the narrative...Biden couldn’t last two minutes under heavy scrutiny in an interview with a real impartial journalist.  Unlike the hacks we see all over the place.
When are you interviewing Biden?
Joe Biden when you won the presidential election of 2020 would you ask the President of Vietnam to have South Vietnam return the country of South Vietnam as a new independent Nation with a New South Vietnamese Government with a New law's and also has it's own Constitution.
If Joe Biden wins then nobody in his transition team should be allowed to discuss new foreign policy with any other foreign country or face the Logan Act.  Or does this only apply when Obama was President?
Of course Biden will not travel to give a speech. He’s hiding in his basement until after election. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional democracy.

Yeah, Biden will make a great puppet, er, I mean president
me, too. &amp; Biden is not a strong candidate.
If Trump is going to do his acceptance of the nomination from the White House it should be in the bunker. And to make things fair Joe Biden should be able to do his acceptance in the Rose Garden
You mean the guy wants to be POTUS and he can’t take being called a name?  So he’s a snowflake too?   If  is the idiot you all claim, Biden should be jumping at the chance to get in the arena.
Biden is the first Manchurian Candidate in US. Hence, the endorsements by the Communist Party in US and support by the CCP in China.
And, Joe Biden wants to lead the country? What a travesty for the American people, if he were to win. Biggest con job by the Marxist Democrats in American history.
They didn't watched the full video, they know he has a stuttering problem.  Biden said nothing wrong, trying make nothing out of nothing...thats they are trying to do.
For more than four years, we’ve heard that  is a dithering idiot.  Yet the Democrats are starting the drumbeat that   won’t debate him?  If Biden can’t debate the “dumbest guy alive“ what’s he gonna do with Putin and Xi? #MAGA  #Election2020 #Debate2020

Why would Dana interview Mrs. Biden isn’t Joe the one running for President.
Biden would have to be the best actor ever if you think he’s trying to fool us . The guy has lost it. Look in his eyes no one home.Shame on his family.
Biden’s a puppet with the Marxists Sanders, Warren, AOC and Pelosi pulling his strings. Biden’s a Manchurian Candidate.
Nope; she’s qualified and I voted for her, but too much controversy, much of it fabricated by the GOP. Biden needs someone who complements his style and skills, while also being a strategic choice to appeal to a wider constituency.
Or you can vote for the child petting Biden - your choice.
Love you bro and yes Trump needs help. But unless you know a good brain surgeon to replace Biden’s you’re fucked.
Come on man - Trump is Trump but Biden can’t remember what he ate for breakfast by 10am the same day.
I bet Biden even knows what state it is in.  We now have a border wall with Mexico here in Colorado don’t you know.
So when is he going to interview Biden and follow up with good questions?
B for Biden all the way- A can go directly to jail without passing GO.
Bolton says he will 'write in somebody' rather than voting for Biden or Trump in 2020 election  Now I know Bolton is stupid. Wasting a vote on someone who has not chance of winning. What a bone head. Vote Biden and get your government back.
Idiots! Joe Biden has NEVER been a left-wing radical and will never be! Idiots!
I’m voting for Biden! I’m also waiting for the real GOP to come back instead of this trump-crap they have right now!
She's a good choice for Biden. She's got the lying downpat.
How can this be excused by Sitting GOP leaders? How is he still the president of the USA? Everyone should watch this trained wreck, a complete disaster and he  wants to debate Biden, i would run this video as campaign advertising until election day.
biden can't even finish a sentence either 😂
It would be earth shattering if Biden did any kind of difficult interviews that are challenging .  He won’t do them just like the way he is trying to weasel out of the debates.   The contrast can’t be more evident.
Buden will never debate Trump because Biden’s not competent. He’s a disgrace and one more hoax that the Marxist Democrats are parading before the American people.
Not surprising, since Biden is a puppet of the Marxist Democrats in the US and of the CCP in China.
Biden-Babybel.  I like it.
I doubt Biden is even the one doing the choosing
Biden needs to debate, if you can’t hold your own on a debate stage, you shouldn’t be President
So if Biden wins and Dems keep the House and take the Senate first thing they’re doing is abolishing ICE and defunding DHS right?
B. Biden...he hasn’t killed 150k Americans and he hasn’t tanked the economy.
I find GHWBs military service a qualifier which outpaces Biden. His combat experience, including being shot down, gave him something Biden never experienced and can't directly understand.  Nevertheless, Biden it is this election.
Trump, Biden and Kanye... really people, there are 350 million of us and this is who you get to pick for the leader of the free word?
Why did you argue with guest about status of Trump campaign. You stumping for Biden?
I think the worst thing I said today is that Joe Biden is hiden’ and afraid to debate.
Mr. Biden, I would respect you so much more if you would just stop using Twitter altogether.
I was right in my initial diagnosis of you   You CLEARLY are unable to put aside what Biden said long enough to KICK IN SOME COMMON SENSE to realize that FACTS = TRUTH &amp; there's NO seperating them some I'm going to stop trying to convince a Borg Drone otherwise as THAT would be…

Didn’t Biden also say something about not wanting his kids to grow up in a “jungle”? Why yes, yes he did. From the two liberal Snopes creators:
Let’s face it Biden isn’t able to debate Trump I don’t know if he even knows who he is.
And Biden will stop it.
My friend, Joe Biden is worse than the Clintons are.   But I don’t think you’re ready for that conversation...
I saw him on one if the shows last week. He is not giving an opinion, says he trusts Biden and that is it.
He has my vote regardless of his choice. We have no choice but Biden and whomever he chooses

It's really because there isn't anything to resist against. Biden's creepy treatment of women is well-known and there are no doubts he was born here. The right would have nothing to go on.
I would almost want to see that, just to watch Biden calmly walk over and then punch Trumps lights out.
No debates as sadly Trump would take advantage of Biden's speech impediment and try to run him over by just talking over him every chance he would get.

Biden can’t feed, dress or wipe himself, much less carry on a thought without a teleprompter.
You Asked For It  I will support Joe Biden’s VP pick.  I will not allow the media to tear down a female candidate.  I’ll call out any democrat for publicly bashing Biden’s VP pick.  This election is life or death for many. We don’t have the luxury to complain. Let’s get to work!

Holy shit!  I can only hope that’s Biden wins means AG Harris and Sec of Treas. Warren will spend the next 4 years leading the effort to uncover and prosecute these scum bag! 😡

She’s a communist who stands up for Castro and Cuba. Perfect for Biden’s VP
That’s some inside ball. The people carrying that much of a grudge over her Cuba comments probably aren’t voting Biden anyway. Most everyone else isn’t paying attention.

Incorrect. I'm independent. I will not vote for Trump under any circumstances, but my vote for Biden is contingent on VP. I will grit my teeth and vote for him anyway with most choices, but if he goes to far or chooses badly unqualified, my vote could be gone. /1
imagine being the person who has to explain to joe biden what tiktok is
We will be a hell of a lot safer under President Biden and so will our Military then we have been under your "leadership".
Certainly seemed to be what he was saying. Also if he weren’t extremely cautious in his view of candidates Biden may not be the nominee in the first place.
can I submit an entire interview segment with joe biden
What and be replaced with plugs Biden won’t happen.
Some advice to team Biden - get this shit under control. It’s undermining your appearance of leadership. And if you’re going to have a cabinet that looks like America why not your VP vetting team?
Postpone the Election? That Could Mean President Biden  via
Lol, so he thinks California is really in doubt pending VP pick. He can’t possibly be that stupid. Even considering he is Joe Biden.
this also applies to the prinzipulled leftys who feel it necessary to spend all of their time on here letting everyone know that they hate biden and aren't voting. we fucking get it already talk about something else there's a million hundred other things going on in the country
True. But then why does anyone listen to any politician re: "govt created jobs"? I guarantee as soon as Biden is President there will be any number of Rs deriding him for "failing to create jobs".
Oh, haven’t you heard?  Trump executed him with Bill, Hillary, Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Biden, and a few hundred others. Those are doubles you see now.
Indeed.  It’s a bad choice but clearly Biden is better
Any chance you want to comment about Biden observation around 4/24 that Trump will want to delay the election?  Made Biden look like Nostradamus.
No worries everytime Biden opens his mouth he puts his foot in it.
Right MN is Trumps fault, so tired of Obama/Biden political BS
Jason, millions of folks believe Trump is the worse President in history and a lying criminal. When asked about Biden’s qualifications to be President, you replied “better than Trump”. That’s quite the endorsement!  Biden’s better than a criminal.
I think they will respond either way, unless Biden commits to Medicare 4 all, open Borders, abortion until birth, defunding the police, student loan forgiveness and universal income, they are going to riot.
Offset by the many republicans who will vote for Biden. You’re boy just ain’t that popular.
Are you scared? Americans already know...Joe Biden wins!
Why wasn’t Biden there, he’s the nominee, not Obama? He’s the one who should have spoke.
The Marxist puppet Biden will never debate President Trump.The Russians are plotting to force Joe Biden to speak in public and actually campaign for president.  It's an attack on democracy.

I heard Joe Biden will cancel summer if he’s elected....  you’ve been warned!
But they can make a difference. Jim Clyburn endorsing Biden may have completely changed the momentum of the dem presidential primary.
If Trump forgives student loans I'll still vote Biden but I'll tweet "He did it, he made America great again" on 1/20/21 as Trump leaves the white house

The DNC should just make Biden punt and drop out of the race. It is obvious there will be no debate, no running mate picked. It is just a disaster.
Russia fears Biden like they feared Hillary. They know these true patriotic Americans really do put America first.
Biden reminds us every day in ways both large and small what having a real President is like
I don’t know how else to put it, but listening to Joe Biden speak tells me that not only does he have early onset dementia, but he’s just flat out stupid. How did he get this far?
Donald Trump has accomplished more in 4 years of government than Joe Biden has in 4 decades of government.
Did your daddy really say Biden will hurt God and the Bible?  Now that is the most ignorant thing I’ve ever heard.  Besides the things you post of course!
Your husband is intentionally interfering in an election with no intent to win, just spoil and THIS is the tweet you come up with? SRSLY?!!!!
Biden is afraid of adding a fourth debate?
So if China helps Biden win, shouldn’t that be called even since dad needed Russia’s help to win last time?
Your agenda to spread lies about Biden’s mental status is sad and pathetic. It’s a good distraction from the 160k dead and counting. But go on and spread your BS.
Right right only Biden has gaffes..idiot
Oh dude...Biden wrote that...not Trump...you would be right if Trump wrote it or tried to say it....
seriously, do you really think black voters who are going to vote for Biden are going to change their vote to Kanye, who is a tRump supporter? if anything  just lost a bunch of votes as they would rather vote for Kanye than tRump #trumpgate
You seem to be ignoring that Biden got more votes than the other Dem primary candidates.
This is actually a pretty genius and abusive tactic. Trump can put the onus on Biden to agree to an in-person debate even tho he doesn't want to debate (has prev indicated he may or may not show up) and when Biden inevitably says no and wants a cyber debate, he can blame Biden.
That’s what I thought.  Enjoy the Biden Administration.
You’re right.  Trump’s incompetence and unfitness to lead far outpace Biden’s.   Finally someone who understands. 😆😆
I've sent you a bunch of bots this morning -- all coming from the same anti-Biden tweet. All the profile photos are nearly the same. Can you please shut that farm down? Thanks

A girl can hope because it seems like Biden is running an inept campaign right now.
No, answer the question.  I’ll rephrase: what % of the black population own their own business?  You think Biden was a racist, so your attack falls laughably flat.
Ok, so if the president can’t stop abortions why did you bring that up in the first place. Why does it matter if Biden pro choice?  Your not making sense!!!!
Thank you for reporting on this. As a “Latina” Joe Biden does not speak for me or other Latinos. He speaks  of blacks &amp; Latinos as if we’re a number and how he can pander to us to get our vote and then forget about us. More of the same
Joe Biden winning is the answer you seek.
‘their businesses’??  How many black people own their own businesses?  Kanye???  Biden a racist???  What color is the sky in your world?
To bad Biden can't remember any of the facts.
I'll give you that one. Although if you were to ask a thousand folks on the street, that same question doubt 25% could answer it. Now explain all the times Biden can't finish a sentence or goes off into the twilight zone with his answer. Actually feel sorry for the man.
I'm voting for Biden even if bursts out doing an imitation of Speedy Gonzales.
This election is not who’s best. TBH Biden wasn’t my first choice or second but I’ll be crazy if I think Trump is better then Biden.
Let's have the debates, I 100% agree we should have them. After the first one is one is over I want you to tweet you honestly still believe what you say here in your tweet. I doubt you will though, you'll be to embarrassed when you see that "Hidden Biden" is losing his mind. SAD
Idiot MAGAt neighbor just put up a huge tRump flag. It's on! Gonna get a Biden lawn sign. I won't unfollow them on FB or stop buying GS cookies from their daughter. I WILL repost every Biden/anti 45 thing I can find! #BlueTsunami2020
If Biden is against God, wonder what God has to say about three-times-married adulterers?
Biden doesn’t deserve any intelligent, FREEDOM LOVING, COUNTRY LOVING persons vote.
that will elect trump.  NOPE.  Voting to get rid of trump.  Voting Biden.
Lying Don got that half right. Vote for Biden.
God can take care of himself by directing a meteorite to the back of Biden’s noggin’.
You lost me at “Biden cares”
Please, have Trump order FBI to arrest Biden and all democratic congressmen/women.
DJT clearly  suffers from the proverbial soft bigotry of low expectations, yet, somehow, Biden is held to a higher standard.
We're waaaaaay past ultimatums, though. I personally can't stand Biden, but I love my country and know that means I vote for him. Period.
This is near the top of the list of why it’s critical Biden wins.
Biden is actually a racist and you libs want him in office 😂
With a democratic Senate, Biden will get things done.
This is why I think Biden needs to pick someone with some econ. credibility. Like Warren. Not just check a box. I am not sure Harris or Rice does that.  One shores up judiciary  &amp; the other foreign affairs which is needed, but economy/virus, including healthcare, will be #1 issue

Which is it, exactly?  Because we're told if we don't vote Trump we're voting for Biden, and if we don't vote Biden we're giving a vote to Trump  How about, just maybe, the person we vote for is the one that gets our vote.

He can't even complete a thought in an interview. Maybe his earpiece is slow as he gets fed his answers. Joe Biden is a segregationist and fought for their cause in schools crafting language still used today to oppose school integration.
Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists. he fought for their cause in schools and helped give America the language that is still used to oppose school integration today.
Going camping off the grid Monday and Tuesday.  Market will still be here Wednesday I hope unless the aliens 👽 come or Biden names Kamala 🤡 🥜
NEWS: Disclosure docs show that one of Biden’s top candidates for VP made big investments in the fossil fuel industry. The revelations come as Biden has faced renewed questions about his climate policies.
Every Biden supporter I know (hundreds) wouldn’t even vote for Kanye for dog poop picker-upper. Most don’t know who or what he is.
But Biden did make African Americans seem like a monolith. Biden's racism is so ingrained, he just can't help himself because that is what he truly believes.
who’s more senile, Biden or Pelosi? She just claimed there are 3.3 million new cases and 70 million deaths from COVID in the last 11 weeks. More deaths than new cases?According 2 CDC there are 4.8 million cases and 160k deaths, total. #PelosiMustGo #shescrazy
Everyday Biden says something racist. Unbelievable. I can go on and on about all his statements. Wake up America. He is handing the election to Trump on a silver platter.
We ditchin Biden y’all
He won't apologize because he doesn't believe he damages people with his words and believes what he says. He has a long record of discrimination going back to trying to stop the busing during the desegregation orders.
Other than Biden she was my least favorite of the primary candidates.
does rocky think we don't realize how big of a dumbass biden is? we see it bud
Its the only reason Biden "Won"
With Biden’s VP choice expected soon, here’s whom he could pick  via  It will reek of Obama-ism and political correctness and will smell worse than a sewer.  Black-Brown-Black, women, liar, hater, puppet, who will it be?
I hope Joe Biden doesn’t campaign at all. I don’t want him getting Covid
Rumor has it that Susan Rice is Biden's choice. Remember that people died and she lied. Four Americans died in #Benghazi attack: #AmbassadorChrisStevens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and #CIAoperatives, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods, former Navy SEALs.
Yeah fuck Joe Biden but there is no way a Democratic Presidential candidate isn't going to have a union bug on the actual physical button
When you KNOW Biden didn’t write it.
Your're the one accusing Dems of hiding Biden when we are in the middle of a pandemic.
LOL. This guy thinks the US provides healthcare to just anyone.  I assume you're voting for Biden as illegal immigration has only increased under Trump.
cue white people cries  “but Biden isn’t inspiring enough... he’ll delay the revolution... i wanted Bernie... both parties are the same... I just wrote an op-ed called The Liberal Case for Trump 2020...”
Have you seen Biden’s interview with Errol Barnett, who asked Biden if he had taken a cognitive test? If you have, have you commented on it? If Trump has said and performed in such an alarming way, would you be silent?As a journalist, you should ask yourself this question.
We all knew it
Live in CO so my ballot comes in the mail  But yes, I would stand in line to cast a vote for Biden
Because who ever wanted a picture taken with Joe Biden?

Exactly. Harris is my second least favorite of all the primary candidates (next to Biden) and so I just assume she will be the VP nomination.

To be clear, anyone who votes for Kanya was never gonna vote for Biden anyhow.  I tend to think that skin color does not dictate intelligence, and no intelligent voters vote for any dude whose wife wants to COMMIT HIM TO THE FUNNY FARM!!

So Trump says he kissed women without their express permission.  But did he?  Where and when?  Biden kisses and gropes CHILDREN without their permission (hundreds of pictures to confirm this obvious fact), and that's okay?  Serious question:  Are you a pedophile?
Biden apologized for yesterdays racist remarks again. How many racist things does he have to say to make people realize he is the racist person on earth. He will not help the black community and has not in 40 years. Trump has done more than any President to help all people.

Biden must form a group to identify and prosecute the officers that have committed these atrocities.
Wouldn't the "Nazi" be Biden? I mean he's the one that gave a eulogy at an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK funeral.
Conjecture: Dems get Kamala Harris or other "in-pocket" Democrat as running mate, pull bait-and-switch with Biden for health reasons post convention. No Yang, no Sanders. Dems are a hard no on both, which should terrify reasonable young liberals who are "solution focused."
Joe Biden is NOT the agent of change this country desperately needs. He’s there to serve as a vessel for financial and structural stability for the 1%

After thinking about Joe Biden and watching him now for over a year as a candidate, (as an independent voter), I just can't believe that he is the Democratic candidate for President. Seriously, is there someone waiting in the wings to swoop in or a 25th amendment strategy?
Today I learned that if you don't like Joe Biden you're a Trump supporter.

This is why my original ? was to the Good Dr and NOT his BEEHIVE.  I don't call anyone coons for thinking this way.  I AGREE with A LOT of IT.  I know about the party switch in early 1900s i.e. Southern strategy.  I am aware of policing records of Biden/Harris.  ? was RIGHT NOW.
1. It's faking a stock market comeback right before an election 2. It sets up for the market to totally crash right after Biden wins, falsely putting the blame on Dems 3. It allows Feds to sell corp bonds to foreign powers allowing them to own large amounts of U.S. businesses
Oh, yeah. By noon I'll be a communist, a racist, pro Biden, pro Trump, a patriot, a traitor, fkng incredible.

Evaluating Joe as a Presidential possibility, but having a hard time being convinced he is a viable candidate. For example, Joe Biden's public statements questioned by the media in past presidential campaigns.
He wasn't trailing Biden for the last 3 years
I love how every time Tr*mp makes shit up about Biden, it makes Biden sound cooler.   Like only in my wildest dreams could I actually vote for someone who would throw all guns into a volcano, turn us into a socialist paradise, and destroy god.
Trump re-election strategies (2020): •They’re all socialists! 👎  •Bidens are corrupt 👎 •Economy is unbeatable 👎 •COVID is Dem hoax 👎 •Uh, we’ll fix economy 👎 •Uh, we beat COVID 👎 •Law &amp; Order 👎 •Antifa’s coming 👎 •Biden is weak 👎 •Biden will take away God 🙄
Sadly, I must agree with JVL.  All of machinery and chicanery of Trumpism will still be in place once Biden is elected, unfettered by the need to even appear to be governing.   Trump unleashed, unbound, unrepentant.
He apologized immediately and it wasn't his point. Biden will say some stupid things from time to time but he's not a racist corrupt compulsive liar and he'll apologize when he says something stupid. You won't get that from the other side.
"West, who has previously voiced support for Mr Trump and is running as an independent, was named on the Colorado ballot on Thursday, the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office confirmed. At least one Republican official assisted West with his filing"
"When it was pointed out to West that it was unlikely he could win November’s poll, and that his campaign was being run as a distraction, he replied: “I’m not going to argue with you. Jesus is King.'"
Last night I kept dreaming about which bumper sticker would be catchier: Biden + Bass or Biden + Harris. Then I hit on Joe and Sue.  I could never make the choice.
I think that Biden's biggest problem is that he has so many great candidates to choose from. Trump, on the other hand, only has one requirement: "Are you loyal to me?"
When I first heard Trump's comments, I thought Biden said something really terrible. What Biden really said, when you come down to it, is that the Black community is more organized than the Latino community. After all, Blacks have been fighting these battles for generations.
The harder the Dems surge left, the more I hear voting Trump. Seems like more to block Biden/socialism than pro-Trump. I live in a major swing state.....
isn't it really funny that Trump supporters are calling out Biden's  microaggressions? a concept they typically drill the left for creating, all while supporting a man known for his macroaggressions... #fucktrump

third party candidates and write-ins. A case might be made for Biden, though I'd probably disagree with it, given his abortion politics.   My editors have a more nuanced discussion about it in this podcast:   I've found Twitter, due to brevity, lacks nuance
Have you shown your father half as much interest in his medical care that you have shown Biden? I know you are kind of the ignored one because you don't have his name &amp; you don't have a vagina, but that reality that you don't SEE your father's brain is rotten fruit is glaring.
So yesterday, a group of women leaders and organizations wrote a letter and sent it out to top news executives.  The purpose: A warning to avoid "stereotypes and tropes" in coverage around Joe Biden's VP pick.  Outlining specific traps the media fall into.  Offering assistance.

For those in despair, read this article:
So every time don Jr says something dumb we have to comment on Biden’s children? That makes no sense.
They think Biden appeals to average people but he will be run by the radical left as we know if elected.  God knows he’s not capable of running a hot dog stand much less be president.
He’s right though. Biden is not left at all. He and Obama deported more people than any other administration. They didn’t end the drug war. They took us from two wars to seven. They want to prosecute Ed Snowden. These are all ideological conservative policies.
Attempt?   “And by the way, what you all know, but most people don’t, unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”   —Joe Biden
Nope, I know some folks of the conservative persuasion who would never vote for a "crazy commie" like Biden, who also won’t vote for Trump. Their vote for a 3rd party candidate is still a vote against Trump.
Ok Christians....explain to me how Biden is going to "hurt" God...but apparently has no beef with Jesus...?
You’re 100% correct. The Biden people are in such denial about his racism. Biden is just more polite about it than Trump.
Kanye late to the party lol but people mad at him for interference because Biden cant hold his own is funny
Ok... that’s a personal problem. I’m not for Biden, I’m voting to remove an existential threat from the White House. Biden at least has a very decent public platform that I can mostly get behind, and I trust him to put intelligent progressive people in positions of power.
. : Be Very Careful About Biden's Lead on Trump -- he joins  to discuss  the second coronavirus stimulus package and the upcoming Presidential election.
Trump's accusation that Biden is against God and wants to hurt God keeps making me think of the lyrics from Woody Guthrie's very subtle Mean Talking Blues:   "I hated union everywhere, 'cause God likes unions and I hate God!"
Yesterday's state polls by Quinnipiac and Data for Progress are all broadly consistent with Biden leading nationally by ~7-10 points... except the Quinnipiac poll of Kentucky, which has Trump only +9. You'd expect him to be up by 22% there if he's down 10% nationally. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
No one would do what you've done!  Competent presidents would have nipped this in the bud in December of last year.  They wouldn't ignore everything around them for months.  I've been working from home in March and I don't see any end it sight -- until President Biden!

I hope she's gonna vote for Biden over Trump because she's a human.
The challenge is that enthusiasm is anti-Trump, not pro-Biden and while he's a nice guy, Biden doesn't seem to get that.
Biden didn't apologize. He clarified. Big difference.
Biden doesn't remember anything...
An all white ticket for this party at this time is unthinkable to me. Surely Biden sees that. I personally don’t know any white women who have this attitude that it has to be a white woman first, but if they are out there they need to get over it. It’s insane.
Just wait and see what weak, feeble Biden does to Santa if he wins! Trump told me so!
So his non apology is an apology, it’s about Trump not Biden, and now Bernie is in the mix?  How far do u have to go to excuse a candidate who is obviously past his sell by date? Jesus Christ talk about any dream will do! You can almost hear Joe shout you got a black VP dammit!

It's so hilarious too, because it's not like there isn't plenty to work with. Biden's record is abysmal. They just don't like dealing with reality or facts and would rather fear monger idiots with absolute nonsense.

Why is CNN afraid of calling it what it is.  Voter Suppression.  Beside you all need to vote for Biden or he may hurt God. Lol.
Amen to that fact  Trump can’t be bought, and the Marxist Democrats hate him for it. Obama, Biden and other Dems all got wealthy feeding at the public trough. They’ve mastered the fine art of screwing the public.
I will vote for Joe Biden regardless, we and our countryCAN NOT sustained 4 more years of Trump!!!
Can you imagine if the Biden team were capable of making this compelling an argument to vote for Biden?
So is Biden saying that black Ameeicans don't have diversity/different attitudes about different things?  Dem are you listening to Joe Biden's comments in these interviews?? He can't put one logical/rational thought together.  Biden is incapable of running this country.  Period.
I feel the same way. I’ll vote for Biden because I love my country but it IS hard to get enthusiastic about him.
Biden was VP for 8 years. Trump is way over exposed as a identity, from daily appearances. If people watch, it will be for the spectacle, not for information.

Black Democrats had a number of credible alternatives to Biden last year if they wanted to support a Black candidate and they largely stuck with Biden, and to think that they'd suddenly bolt for Kanye in the general is... an odd view of voting behavior.

Neither you, Joe Biden nor Jo Jorgensen are worthy of my vote.
The party of Joe Biden is the same party of slavery, Jim Crowe, abortion, the KKK, Gov. Wallace.  Re-branded, new packaging, but same condescension and silent hatred of black achievement.
Actually Biden didn’t admit any mistake in this statement, and you’re being rude to someone with English as a second language. Biden’s first statement was clear, but you want us to allow for certain intellectual origami in his words you don’t offer this man from Nigeria... #shame
I think Biden wants to buy everyone an electric Corvette?
I am not fooled for one second. Sad that many MAGAs will hold this as true. But, then everything about trump is Sad.    via
But He didn’t admit any mistake, he blamed his mistake on our misunderstanding of the words he clearly spoke to a demographic he was trying to woo. It’s a typical Biden gaffe, he inadvertently diminished one group while flattering another. Biden should be better than this!
lmfao I’ll vote for biden if he successfully hurts god
This isn’t about Trump, it’s about Biden, he didn’t apologize, apparently it’s our fault we misunderstood what he clearly said. Biden and the  think that anything is better than Trump, even it’s a slightly less racist 70 yr old who still takes the black community for granted.
Where’s the apology in this statement???? The first sentence is a lie, he wasn’t talking about diversity in the black and Latino communities, he literally said the black community lacked the diversity of the Latino community. Repeatedly Biden takes the black community for fools!
Did Biden Tweet a video of someone chatting “White Power”, or did I miss something? Hmmmm

The powerful, the almighty, the creator...hurt by Joe Biden. And they wonder why 1.) no one buys this annointed oil bullshit and 2.) There are atheists in to see world. This is their representative. And if they try claim he is not, we where is the holy outrage?
I don’t care much about Biden. Trump is the greatest threat to the country. Think about that before you cast your vote. That’s all I ask.
Joe Biden - "All blacks are the same unless they don't vote democrat then they ain't black"  #FakeNewsMedia  silent.
I’m so tired of my concerns of a Biden presidency being swept under the rug because “at least he’s not trump”
If you’re gripe with Biden is that he’s “not progressive enough” instead of authoring the legislation that got us to this very point...we aren’t friends and never will be
Both platform?  Someone's not been paying attention for the last 4 years.  Trump's priorities and platform have been well communicated and unchanged for four years.  What does Biden stand for?  Everything wrong..
So you’re saying Trump has proved that stupidity is not racist so Biden is not racist either for saying stupid things. They are both just stupid old white men that we no longer need running our country. Kick them all out. Term Limits.
They will only ramble on about Hunter Biden and deflect any wrong doing by their king. The Trump supporters that are left have sold their souls...
It hurts God that we chose an orange demon to lead our formerly great country.  Vote for Biden.
Biden for President ads are truly despicable. That crying lady blaming her grandma’s death on President! President Trump initiated the travel ban within 10 days of the first case while every other leader shamed him.
Biden is identity politics for people whose kids took their car keys away.
We had Bernie as an option and this is what the DNC chose for us instead. I was thinking that if his VP choice is progressive I would vote for Biden. But I can't, he is just as bad as Trump.
George I loved you as a figure of my childhood but this statement is so far left and not true it makes you look as old and crazy as Biden.
I love him...
I think you have it backwards.  Biden wants Kamala and his staff/advisors have been pushing Rice because they know Kamala is more charismatic than he is and made it clear she wants to be Pres someday by running for the office
Biden is a puppet socialist whose strings are being pulled by Sanders, Warren and AOC in Congress and by the CCP in China. He’s a genuine Manchurian Candidate. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional republic from the militant socialists, i. e., communists.
Biden was also 100% against gay marriage until the SCOTUS ruled on the decision. He suddenly supports their rights to marry.
Biden must say: You lost Mr. President, because you lacked the moral courage to face the reality of the disease.
Biden will compare the Covid/19 results to other recent pandemics and to wars in the 20th century.
Trump will do his China gambit. He do Whataboutism on the Iraq war. Biden's has to attack. Xi is not running for Pres, and neither is George Bush.
And yes, Biden needs a few reliable people on stage with him.
He lives in Neverland. If he calls “laughing stock and pity” respect...
Biden has to be facing him and talking to Trump about Trump's failures. No impaired person can face the consequences of their impairment. If the podiums are wrong, the Biden's people have to turn them.
How about that water? Thank God (who Biden hates) Trump fixed the water.
Maybe because whenever Biden does come out of his basement, he forgets his handlers scripts, where he is, and every time he is covered there is nothing positive he says or does???
I'll never support Biden (or anybody else that Obama pushes). I'm going to vote for the Greens.
Sure. Trump or Biden, same thing. And you idiots who thought that people like me would vote for Hillary keep dreaming. You are going to lose 2020, too. I'm white, over 65, college grad, former bank VP with Mexican relatives.
Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and Black communities
Not true. I hate Trump, but Biden has a HUGE lying issue.
And neither did Biden here. He "clarified." The word "apologize" or "sorry" does not appear in the tweet (that was obviously not written by Biden himself).
the demobrats and leftist socialists like biden and pelosi are doing their best to stop Trumps re-election and they are creating all kinds of chaos to do that to damage the election process.  I wouldn't be surprised if they had a hand in starting the riots
Joe Biden gets away with a lot of crap cos he’s not conservative. This man is always talking down on the black community but he throws his i have a black friend card and everyone forgets
Unserious?? Me? Huh. Bernie decided his friendship w/ Biden matters more than my healthcare or my son's college debt  So, as a white, liberal, college grad granny, I say F him and Biden and all Democrats
Did Joe Biden just give out Conservative Black Brothers and Sisters a new name? The 2020 version of Deplorables? 😯
*Joe Biden's staffers seem much more competent in text
Who is this maniac that thinks Biden is going to hurt God? This maniac is currently our president.
Trump is confusing Biden twitter and Khive for Rose Twitter and Tankies.
Before it is announced I would like to state that I think Biden's pick will be Susan Rice.
Trump threats Biden's religious beliefs. Too bad trump has none. Throwing shade only blocks your vision.
Biden’s killing god and trump is fixing our faucets how could life get any better?
Straight up tho, as a Latino and Black American: Fuck Joe Biden
Healthcare workers of America we have a duty to protect Joe Biden and to report the obvious Elder Abuse of him by the Left.  Please file a formal complaint ASAP.  Poor Joe is being exploited by the Democratic party which is clearly elder abuse.
if ya can’t see Biden’s blatant racism i don’t know what to tell you lol
Don’t feel attacked, your vols didn’t need you to say it thrice! They were always ridin with Biden!
As a healthcare provider I am  bound by law to report elder abuse. So to the handlers of Joe Biden look out!
Trump doesn’t get what being a Christian is or how one is to live as one yet he can say this about a Good and decent man. VOTE for Joe Biden.
Biden doesn’t need my vote. He’s courting Republicans. Why not go phone bank some of them instead of insisting lefties vote for a centrist? He is far close to them than the left.
Yes but Biden having Ana Navarro and Larry Summers on board shows he's serious right?  Jesus fucking Christ why can't you be better
“Biden’s answer was neither definitive nor concise” Nothing he says ever is. His mealy mouthed disingenuous arguments made it clear enough where he stands.
Wow. I thought Cory Gardner and Donald Trump were vying for the dumber than dirt title. Here comes Biden from the rear. 🤦🏻‍♀️
If Kanye hurts Joe Biden's run for presidency, then perhaps the dumbass centrist chucklefucks of the DNC should have coronated a better candidate.
Pretty sure Biden has never heard of Twitter.
DUH, get the straight jacket out y'all - Kanye West Admits Presidential Campaign Aims to Hurt Biden’s Prospects  via
Joe Biden spoke about his Catholic faith Thursday, after President Trump said that a Biden presidency would “hurt God.”   One campaign watcher said he thinks believers should focus on issues.
The R’s don’t have to stop it. Biden literally said he’d veto M4A even if it passed Congress &amp; landed on his desk. If F’ing Representatives represented the majority &amp; voted for it HE would kill it.
Biden told blacks they can’t think for themselves like Hispanics can...what’s to clarify?   Sounds like you agree with Biden.
Biden tells the country blacks can’t think for themselves compared to Hispanics, and “Thailand” is the biggest story?   Still think the media isn’t biased??
I bet Biden knows 2 Corinthians isn't about two Corinthians.
It's entirely unsurprising that Joe Biden has a brain full of ignorant racial stereotypes.
After seeing his recent, mental breakdown over Biden, I am starting to think about voting Biden
Ima just say these 3 things. 1. He’s not crazy. 2. That’s what they do when their own speaks out “calls them crazy” 3. He’ll be better than Joe Biden!
is the best VP for Biden. Of course, I also think she would be a great President.
If Biden cant win because Kanye then he dont deserve to be president.
M4A means M4A, just as GND means GND, as written. Dems like to take progressive buzzwords, water them down beyond recognition, then pretend they support that thing. Biden’s plan leaves millions uninsured &amp; many more who can’t afford their “affordable” healthcare.
if Biden's thumb was on life support and Biden's thumb were on the ballot, I'd vote for Biden's thumb.  Doing anything else only contributes to the total destruction of the United States.
What does Biden have going for him?
I have a lot of Republican friends and this is the new normal. A vote for Biden is a vote for American ideals. A vote for Trump is a vote for the end of everything we hold dear. #VoteBiden
So his goal isn’t even to win, it’s to suppress Joe Biden?  Where are all of #KanyeWest’s followers that are making the claim that he’s trying to play Donald?  He’s gonna lead us to 4 more years of the orange menace! #FuckKanye
If he came out talking as much shit about Trump as he has about Biden, I’d believe this. He’s barely gone at Trump at all, and there are 1000 things he could easily call out.   Sadly, I don’t trust it.
OK, I'll take one for the team. If you vote for Biden or any Democratic party candidate it will be like eating a poop sandwich then later you will realize that all you have to eat is poop soup. The moral of the story is QUIT EATING SHIT! #MAGA2020
If you got a degree in history and they delete it, then what happens? Will Biden's government reimburse those teachers educational cost? I don't think so and they will not recognize it as a degree that you may be paying back loans for. Not cool. A Trump win is critical in Nov.

Joe Biden thinks all blacks are alike and vote Democrat.  If you don't vote Democrat, you ain't black.  Now, who is the racist?
Biden responds to criticism  Trump is an asshole.
trump is not only an asshole, but a stupid one too.  He has to know Biden has been religious all his life and trump’s stupid comments only magnify the religious differences of the 2
This poor, mentally ill man doesn't even realize that the GOP is using him to take away the African-American vote from Biden.  Drastic tactics beneath all involved.
Joe Biden would hurt America.
Next Trump is gonna say Biden wants Willie Horton as his Attorney General.
gonna be honest, if biden manages to lose his 3rd presidential attempt to donald trump its gonna be the funniest shit ever.

I hate bridge
Or hear the word trump
Then go away
Beautiful Colorado!! And I don't need to hear a debate, I don't need to know who his VP is and I don't need more time, I will vote for Biden no matter what!!!
As Trump is setting up his argument if he fails- mail-in voter fraud, Biden’s lining up Bernie as his failure excuse. Bernie could go on bended knee &amp; individually ask every person who ever supported him to vote Biden &amp; it would still not be enough. They don’t get it’s POLICIES!
Biden is literally the most religious person in the entire government. A lifelong, devoted Catholic, not a womanizing, fake Christian like Trump
Joe Biden is an Alyssa Milano Democrat.
Not voting for Biden.  Not voting for Trump.
I'll be voting by Mail in Colorado, but not for Biden.
I would have done that for Bernie -- but  no, I'm not voting for Biden. F the Democrats
Oh, do we want to compare Biden's mispronunciations one-for-one versus Trump's? OK, I'm in. You go first. This is gonna be easy.
Really? We currently have a president who cannot pronounce Thailand, Yosemite, Tanzania, Nambia, Diversity, Ulysses, and so many other things on a daily basis and you think that Biden is worse? Maybe YOU should take a cognitive test.
Ideal Scenario:  Joe Biden will announce Susan Rice as his running mate  And then on January 21, 2021 will forget his way to the White House

“Trump bad! Reps bad too!” Doesn’t explain or justify Dems not listening to their own voters &amp; the majority of Americans as a whole. Expect better, demand better, or you’ll never get it. Biden said he’d veto M4A even if it passed Congress, while 88% of Dems support. Explain that
If Biden can hurt the Christian god then either he’s more powerful than their god, or their god is a pussy.
Agreed, Biden is a devout Catholic and Trump can't spell devout Catholic
I believe Biden May also have the power to destroy yoseminites.  Just saying.
Trump Campaign Asks Biden to Agree to Move Debates After Commission Says No  Giuliani is the one who is outdated. The man is not longer relevant and actually a criminal waiting to be tried for high crimes and misdemeanors.
Right,  can't condone not voting for Biden.
This is a fabulous and effective campaign ad.  The folks working for Biden are hitting home runs with great ads!
Biden is the most racist person on earth. He has a proven track record to prove it, just watch his videos going back 40 years. It is Aug 6th and he probably does not remember what he said today. Just saying.
Despite the cozy relation that he has with the press, Biden is constantly walking back one of his statements. What kind of POTUS would this senile old man make? Laughable, if not such a serious possibility.
Let’s be honest. We can all use the propaganda machine upping Biden.... but why donate to republicans, establishment, nevertheless undercover oligarchs?
Trump is more Fascist, Biden is slightly more Neo-Lib
Here is a scary hypothetical scenario: The DNC gets Biden elected and whoever his running mate is, could the plan be that he steps down immediately because of health issues, then that person is President and Nervous Nancy is Vice President. Dang, think about that. Just saying.
Trump Is Anxious That Joe Biden Is Going To Pick Kamala Harris For VP  Then do it. Didn’t want Biden either. Do it, ⁦
I love this video! This should be played over and over again! As all the videos he contradicts himself! Biden's camp has so many videos they can use for their campaign!
Biden (or whoever wrote his speech) is right that we are in a fight for the soul of our country.  However, he is on the wrong side of the fight, and he needs to repent of his wicked beliefs &amp; actions and come back to his baptized faith.
Actually, though, I want a fair Biden/trump election where Biden MOPS THE FLOOR with trump and wins by such a LANDSLIDE that there’s no reason to audit the election.
Biden’s one tough MF if he can hurt god!😂
I can't believe you would even consider voting for Biden!!
Nice try Joe Biden’s handlers ;)
If you vote for Biden you are a racist. There is no wiggle room.
Why do you need to back anybody besides your preference until Biden makes a choice? I'll happily back Harris - if she's the candidate. Until then, I'll continue to lobby for Warren because - wait for it - I "feel she's the best choice." Cheers!
Trump falsely says Biden, a practicing Catholic, is "against God"  Again, trump is making false statements. The man is just disgusting and can not be believed about anything. How does he live with himself? lonely for sure.
If  knew anything about or believed the bible he wouldn't have uttered this drivel:  #ResistanceTaskForce #beattrump2020.
it is sad watching what they are putting Joe Biden through #IngrahamAngle
Why can't we just wait for Biden to announce his running mate? Are we fucking children who can't wait for Christmas morning? Pitting these women against each other, constantly asking him and them who it's gonna be, JFC, people, patience is a virtue.
Wait, Joe Biden actually said that?
Biden faces backlash for comparing diversity in African American, Latino communities  trump wishes Biden said something bad. Trump is so desperate he is now making up stories that disparage Biden. Good luck with that idea. Trump is so bad at his statements.
Biden is the only dude not coming out from hiding Jack except when he's spinning stories about all the things he never did.
Not sure I get the furor over Biden’s comments today. It is true that the history of slavery is more intrinsic to most Black Americans than any single thing binds the Latin population.

I will be surprised if Biden makes it to the election #IngrahamAngle
#Biden  DAMAGE THAT CAN'T BE UNDONE !
Why would Biden give #Trump one debate...its like talking to a monkey with a lobotomy...what topics could be discussed??? Sesame Street?
Yeah, I'm rather surprised you feel Biden "decided."
First leaving my home and driving around is not a thing since March. Also I think Biden has learned that he does not need to do much except let the Orange Guy talk. That is all the camp he needs.
So VP Pence, are you in on the President's "Biden is against God" statement? Are you? You evangelical hypocrite. #PenceIsAHypocrite
Personally, I think #Dotard is bluffing like he always does. His handlers wouldn't want him out there against Biden. He's been a total embarrassment &amp; more so than usual lately.  #TrumpIsALaughingStock of the world!

Man, whoever wrote this for Biden should be president
And yet, your vote depends on Biden’s VP pick.. sigh
We are beating a dead horse (trump), he will be ousted in Nov. Unless Biden falls over from a heart attack, Trump will lose. It will be proven that white nationalists were involved in stoking the fire to promote looting and violence.
About as dumb as Biden wanting a black VP to try and capture the voters Obama DOD.
Who said this about Biden, a Putin paid twitter bot or the president of the United States? "Take away your guns, take away your Second Amendment. No religion, no anything. Hurt the Bible. Hurt God. He’s against God. He’s against guns. He’s against energy."

Donald Trump claims Joe Biden is 'against God;' Biden aides call Trump a hypocritical divider  trump continues to be vile and disoriented. He is clueless when he is attempting to attack anyone he cares to. Just a pouty child.
IIRC, The bible mentions fornication. Which Biden is well aware of, especially around kids and on camera.
Stupid Biden
Jesus, dude. Again with this garbage? Next you’re going accuse Joe Biden of five bankruptcies and having a felon personal lawyer who paid hush money to a porn star.
Biden gaffe
It is a ploy by the Trump organization so people vote for him instead of Biden which takes votes away to help trump win. It's another desperate way that Trump is trying to cheat the election, pathetic and ridiculous
Trump has hit the pocket books of both the drug companies and the military industrial complex in the course of a month. I get why a lot of people hate him...but has Pelosi or Biden ever done anything like that in the last 40 years?
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, says he did not mean to suggest community is a 'monolith'
Translation: I’m looking for any reason I can find to not vote for Biden.
Were you listening to this guy before you fire off insults? Typical leftist Democrat 😆
is LOSING BIGLY Biden Lead Over Trump Increases With Just 90 Days Until Election: Poll
Should Joe Biden fail to debate President Trump at least three times, it amounts to an admission that he is unable to carry out the duties of President.
#Hannity if Biden is elected it will be determined that anything that shoots a bullet will be an assault weapon
CNN and MSNBC did not cover Joe Biden’s blatantly racist remarks today. Let that sink in. Clear bias about a racist, dementiated man who is totally unfit. He actually thinks Arizona is a city
Biden is scared of Trump
But yet Biden can destroy God and all from his basement. Powerful man. 😂😂😂
“Joe Biden is a racist, no man can stand for one color in society” 😘
If Joe Biden wanted our votes so bad he'd actually support the things we want.  Since he won't I have to assume that he doesn't need my vote

What a luxurious privilege for this gal to extol indecisiveness, huh? The rest of us will do everything in our power for Biden regardless, just to make sure our country and given rights aren’t further eroded, that fear doesn’t rule any longer. Must be nice...
You just can't make this stuff up what Biden says. He is the most racial person on earth. Just saying.
Joe Biden hates black people. He has now said you ain’t black if you don’t vote for him. You have no diversity-you’re all the same. I just don’t understand.
That the DNC tries to keep Husk of Biden as candidate shows in how low regard they hold their own voters.   Anyone who votes for this charade is a lemming...a sheep of a lemming
Biden will have his own version of, "Have you decency, Senator?"
It won't be a debate. Trump will make accusations and insults. Joe Biden will talk about Trump's record.
#Hannity waiting to see my first Biden yard sign in Denver area
The Pope wants us to vote fur Biden
Right now it is 50/50 Biden does as well.
Obviously Joe Biden, an authentic if imperfect Christian, cannot "hurt God." Also: the God of the Christian faith is a God who vulnerably hurts with those who hurt. Who weeps. Who bleeds. I don't think Trump knows that God.
Did I hear kanye has a running mate before biden?
Huh...what did you say???? We are doomed, Trump or Biden, we are doomed
Why is  so obsessed with destroying Joe Biden ...
Secretly hoping that Biden is currently filming a how-to YouTube video on how to hurt God.
Uhmm, are you accusing Obama or Biden or the NBA of murder? You do realize this has happened under a Trump presidency?
Fuck Trump and Biden
It seems like the obvious voting strategy (at the national level) is "Biden plus Republicans in the Senate to check him." I suspect the outcome will be "Biden plus the Senate Republicans take a shellacking."

What in earth is wrong with you??  Biden could choose a sea slug as VP and it would be exponentially better than another 4 years of Trump. Stop it already!
Looking forward to your significant financial contributions to the Biden campaign so that change like this in the US is possible. Where is your checkbook, Mr. Bloomberg?
Just saw a low light vid with Mr. Biden at lectern, E in Biden not visible. My brain went to Bid'n.

Next week:  "Biden's green deal means cars are illegal, dishwashers illegal, no cops, no airplanes, no toilets.  Think about that, no toilets.  I think about that.  My hotels have the best toilets.  Biden will take all the toilets out of the suburbs and give them to inner city"
At this point, I believe there is a staffer that's collecting a paycheck, but secretly a Biden vote, that is setting these gems up for us.
Neither Joe Biden nor Barack Obama is our president right now and what the NBA players think doesn't mean anything. Trump is president and the violence has only gotten worse since he took office.
I did. Charlemagne had questions, Bidens time was up, charlemagne frustrated asks biden to have a conversation when he comes to New York.  Biden appaled that a black man was treating him as an equal responds with his superior knowledge on being black.  The 1994 omnibus crime bill
Donnie, that ain’t TRUE. That is a LIE. See there is a difference. Joe Biden has no interest in taking my guns or anybody’s guns for that matter.
Let’s take roll.  How many times has Biden gone to church in past decade.  How many times deranged pathetic trump

Leave it to Fox News to lie to the American public. Biden’s not doing any of that.
Pretty sure charlemagne was trying to ask a question that Biden dodged.
Were the ads issued to black folk that do not plan on voting for Biden? Seeing as how Biden does not consider them to be black.

You will say anything that comes to your mind, won't you?   No matter how false it is.   Biden has said and told his donors that he wants additional funding for police.   And Biden has never said he was taking away anyone's legally owned weapons.   Try sticking to the facts.
If only that was the worst thing he did today  see: Joe Biden presidency will ‘hurt god’
This is a scene taken from a documentary about how Joe Biden put the smackdown on God
I’ve been trying to #hurtGod for damn near a decade, and Joe Biden shows up and gets all the credit! HORSESHIT. #NoComradesUnder1k
Biden is for full term abortion, hard pass.
This is how Biden is going to hurt God
Thus Spoke Joseph Biden.
Apparently this is taken from a documentary about Joe Biden and his great smackdown of God
Karen is in the news again, no not racist  Karen. I am talking about a possible Joe Biden VP pick Karen Bass, who's been around the world of politics for sometime now. When it comes to experience the GOP can't say she isn't qualified to VP or President. I like this Karen
The problem I have with Biden is his support for third term abortion. Hard No for me as a Christian
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden tapped 'Aunt Jemima' as VP  via
Well by all means rectify that error! Make sure Trump's unhinged lies go unchallenged, while Biden's remarks get dissected and analyzed. It's the Iron Law that Republicans get stenographed, and Dems get contextualized!
You are going to lose with that attitude!  Obama, Biden and athletics are not the president.  All trump wants to do is call out a bunch of thugs acting as police  officers, using tear  and violence.  Trump is showing his true colors.   He is a buffoon, not a leader!
1st debate: Biden should say Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV and walk off the stage
Best Biden commercial so far- hopeful and looking toward the future
Donald Trump vs Joe Biden is the worst decision the US people have had to make since Donald Trump vs Hillary Clinton
Perfect example... If Trump would have said it the conservatives would have all been saying "Well, what he really meant it you should be supporting your community" or some such.... Since Biden said it it's  all "Biden is racist"...  It's all politics and spin.
I’m with you HW. These people that can’t make up their minds, want to see who the VP is, think Biden is the worst of 2 evils do not impress me. Either you are for America or you are for Trump. It’s so easy for me.
Biden Supports Free Coronavirus Tests And Vaccines For Undocumented Immigrants
Trump bragging about “acing” a test designed to diagnose early onset dementia (which itself may be a sign of dementia), while pointing out that no doctor had deemed a dementia test is necessary for Biden...
Harry Truman. Dwight Eisenhower. John Kennedy. George HW Bush. Physical and moral courage. And Joe Biden. Courage is dealing with tragedy without crumbling.
What difference does it make? You’ll defend him no matter what we tell you. It’s sad when Christians support a man who lies about being Christian. He couldn’t even come up with a Bible verse when asked. Joe Biden is a devout Catholic who attends mass. trump is a devout liar.
This is one of the dumbest things Two Corinthians Trump has ever said about Joe Biden.
God says “shut up Donnie”Lindsay Graham just named on nat'l TV as receiving info from Russians against Biden.  Mention that please.
odd how when obama was in office terrorist attacks on Americans and our military Trump was elected it all stopped if biden gets in are obama's sleepers going to start their attacks to weaken our military and country for a take over
biden gets in kiss your rights good bye and start learning Russian or Chinese
Just announced....Lindsay Graham has been named as receiving propaganda from Russia against Biden.  We have to be strong. VOTE!!!
And do what biden shut the country down and destroy our economy and still have a virus spread like wildfire a virus the democrat's created with their allies China just to get Trump out of office because he's hurting your profits from China
Always about the middle class what about the poor the people that keep this country going pay the highest taxes and have nothing to show for it biden and the democrat's don't care about Us
Excommunication isn't cancelled. Biden has debts to pay. Cancellation would go far as a start.  Side note: it would help the country too.  Like, a LOT.
But I still want Biden saved. He ought pay for his corrupt acts, but that's for his salvation.
Biden is a controllable puppet of the deep state. His rapid cognitive descent may have surprised the controllers. “Don’t worry Joe. You’re just an interim placeholder. We’ll take care of you. We’re going to replace you when the time is right. Hang in there and do your best.”
Has anyone met a Biden supporter? Seriously.  Not a news person or celebrity and NOT a Trump hater,  a true Biden supporter?
I know you don't believe Catholics are Christians, but Joe Biden is.  Trump on the other hand is a godless adulterer and a con man. Two Corinthians told me to tell you that.
Litmus test.  Replace Biden with pretty much any conservative, of any color.  What would that person be called?   But I get your point.
BBC News - US election 2020: Trump says opponent Biden will 'hurt God'  I guess he didn't get the memo.. "your arms are too short to box with God.. meaning you can't hurt God fool!  this mean anyone  including Joe Biden
Didn’t you know, Biden carries a Hanzo sword. 😉
LOL. Andrea Mitchell messed up and said Obama instead of Biden. Now right wing Twitter is convinced it's an illegal power grab to give Obama a third term.
Joe Biden is a total racist, he makes the absolute worst comments. Alzheimers???
Who would've thought Yahoo news would be the most reliable MSM news in 2020? They're the only ones I've seen report on Biden's mental decline. 🤷‍♀️👏
I dunno Joe...Joe Biden once said he didn't want his kids to grow up in a "racial jungle" in regards to desegregation.
Last year Joe Biden reversed his position and now supports forcing Catholics to pay for abortions with their tax dollars.
Bernie needs to be our candidate, he's doing more than Biden and not in his basement.
If you think west is going to make you proud. He's going to take votes from you u, not Biden.
BIDEN AND HIS HISTORY OF RACIST COMMENTS AND FRIENDS CONNECTED TO THE KKK; HAS A LOT OF S'PLAINING TO DO!!! WHERE'S THE LAME STREAM MEDIA AND THE REST OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY????
The Joe Biden Memorial Abortion Clinic... Because He Cares
Family first for Biden.  Let’s not forget his son got a huge payday in Ukraine!
His wife is already filling in at speaking events.  I expect "Doctor" Jill Biden to step in  "to carry on her husband's work and legacy."  The puppet changes, but not the hands on the strings.
That sounds like they're an internally diverse group....but Biden just said they're not. I'm confused.
I don't care if Biden picks Wilson from Castaway as his running mate. This is to save our country. Get your priorities in order.
Why would you expect them to "do better"? They still believe Obama is a Muslim so attacking Biden's faith is the next logical step in the plan. This MAGA cult has no interest in doing the right thing
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
Every thing I'm reading is showing this will more likely siphon votes from the Clown-king, not from Biden 😂😂😂😂🤷
Hairless Joe Biden
If Trump said the same things about Whites, that Biden routinely says about Blacks, can you imagine the media coverage? Can you imagine the millions of voters he would lose?   Biden will get little negative media coverage, and will lose very few voters.   🤷‍♂️
“Joe Biden would be the most pro-abortion President in history”.
Biden draws distinction on Black, Latino political diversity
BULL CONNOR AND GEORGE WALLACE; FORMER FELLOW DEMOCRATS ARE PROBABLY CLAPPING FOR BIDEN FROM THEIR GRAVES!
WE. CANNOT. AFFORD. A. WEAK. PRESIDENT.   Biden would be the weakest president in history - even more than "he who shall not be named" who he was VP for.
😂😂😂...used Biden and clarifies in the same sentence...
The President has lost touch with reality. His lies have become outrageous and unbelievable. He is delusional.  Trump should stop talking about Biden, as Trump gets it all wrong. Trump should tell us what he will do with 4 more years!
Joe Biden Insinuates Black People Are All Identical... No This Isn't a Joke  via

Ms McCain, when you say never Trump, are you also saying “Never Biden”? I think it only fair on your statement/tweet that now you let us know where you stand on the Presidential race! #trulyconservative?
I know lots of people, family members included, who voted trump in 2016, but are absolutely disgusted by him now and have pledged to vote Biden now. They regret that vote now. Janelle could be like that. We have to be willing to let people change their minds if they want to
Me, too...we should all donate our $12 to Biden 😁
Joe Biden will hurt God... sleepily I presume , got it.

Thought Biden might be Goku, until he said he hates energy too
This is obama, pelosi and her puppets taking rights away if biden gets in will be worse lucky we have gangs and illegal gun dealers then the democrat's won't know who owns a gun :)
Due to the way the electoral college works, the president will either be Trump or Biden. A vote for neither is equivalent to not voting, which helps Trump. Do you really want 4 more years of Trump?
obama started this pelosi and her puppets are continuing to buy all ammo so Americans can't biden will follow through We need a president that isn't going to take more rights away that's not biden
can you force Trump Campaign to pay for the entire event and the use of Air Force One because he did that? "At an official WH event, Trump is delivering a campaign speech, repeatedly attacking Biden. Many of the lines are right out of the rallies." -
Someone, or everyone already said it/figured it out, but the only reason your "tweet" is accurate; is Joe Biden does NOT write his own tweets.  He kept tweeting to 30330 and wondering why no-one tweeted him back. #Trump2020WillBringUnity  #UnityIsTrump2020  #StabilityBringsUnity
Joe Biden will continue to Win. The only people mad are people that live in comments and social media.

BOUT SUMS UP JOE BIDEN; YESTERDAY AND TODAY!
Watching Joy play a clip of murder-n-chef say Biden is going to take away windows. Earlier he said Biden is going to hurt God.  Biden has some power like we’ve never seen. Lol How do ppl take him serious about any fucking thing.
When you realize that Americans are going to have to suffer through several Joe Biden/Donald Trump debates
Joe Biden can smell a child from a mile away, but he likes to get closer.
My prediction is that biden won't be the nominee. We need to have enough online ammo to stop whoever they do put in.
No, I'm voting for Biden.
No Nancy. You and Biden BOTH need mental evaluations and drug and alcohol testing.
He is slowing it down as he is a slow president , all he cares about is trashing everyone, Biden loves god at least we have seen him IN a church, all trump cares about is sending you to meet god sooner
Lol Biden believes in America and god, Trump believes in sending you to your maker first while he eats burgers and fires tear gas at Americans
Obviously. The best way to take vote from Biden is to run as the black Mike Pence.
I seriously think Biden is going off the deep end either on purpose or the Powers That Be are letting him act crazy on purpose to slip in a last second Nominee just before the election. #crazierthingshavehappened #waitandsee
Biden mentions the "soul of the nation" every other time he speaks. He's a life long Catholic.
Oh please dear Lord, don't let Biden "hurt God".
Oh please don't let Biden "hurt God".
I don't believe for a minute that Biden doesn't believe in God. However, the radical left Marxists &amp; Communists with Biden would like to do away with people's faith &amp; religion since to them its their political power they want everyone to bow and kneel to.
He didn’t file, the republican lawyers did for him! They don’t want him to win just take votes away from Biden
Better than Biden😉

biden says he will create millions of jobs with clean energy which is creating a huge carbon foot print and tells me other things but under the next breathe says we will purchase clean energy, who are we purchasing it from and is that country getting those millions of jobs
Biden at debate  "You have such a great memory that you can remember 'Person, woman, man, camera, TV' and you love the Bible so much, how about this easy cognitive test for you, why don't you tell the American people your favorite Bible verse?"  silence......
Watch your Axios interview or Chris Wallace interview. Don’t worry about Biden. Get yourself together. You appear lost and dement.    Get this old man some help.

Wow. Donald, you are fully W-A-C-K-O.  Stop trying to tell us what Biden will do. Obviously you don’t get that right.  What are YOU going to do next term?
Joe Biden announced last week that it would be sometime this week in which he would announce his running mate/VP. Will we get an announcement later today or early tomorrow before the weekend? We're just 89 days from the presidential election.
Stop trying to tell us what Biden will do. You are so wrong.  What are YOU going to do? What is your direction &amp; commitments?   How many walls in your 2nd term? How many impeachments?
Old man, you are delusional. You are saying Biden will repeal the Second Amendment. You haven’t read that Constitution yet, have you?     This man is a danger to himself and us all.
......... Merow? I was saying Biden was 29 in that video..
No. I'm saying Biden was 29, in that video... And he's begin a politician longer than I've been alive.. Which is more than 29 years.
Whew. They're certainly rigging the game which is NOT good for America. I heard another odd disjointed comment #Biden made about China this week, so he really must debate to be honestly viable.
Biden cannot debate Trump.  He can’t follow simple conversations, much less make any rational points. Even fie hard Dems  will see the man has dementia.. Then it comes down to if Dems hate Trump more than they love this country.  Will they vote Socialism in?
Except, we can show the videos of exactly what Biden said and don’t even have to edit it. Not one thing on your first meme can be backed up with video evidence because they are all untrue. Race has nothing to do with the 2nd meme other than #1 and no proof that’s what he said.
Biden takes for granted that all black people think alike while the right recognize that the color of ones skin does not affect their ability to think for themselves.  David disagreees with your assertion that Biden is right, which proves he thinks differently = Biden is wrong.
Well according to Biden, Obama is the “first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean.”
It’s not just his crime bill, he has a history of being anti-black. He also introduced a bill encouraging segregation in schools by trying to block bussing.
If the DOJ prosecutes before the election, it would be the end of Biden's campaign.

Biden seems to be talking more these days but still makes no sense. His wife should be ashamed of herself for letting this poor man with dementia go through a stressful presidential campaign instead of sitting in his rocking chair mumbling to himself.
Thay would be as bad as Biden getting it!
There is no need for wasting time on a debate. We know all we need to know about Trump Or Biden. This is so Media People can make more money.
Interesting 🤔 There are plenty of folks who aren’t comfortable publicly supporting Trump. I actually think there are even more folks ashamed of publicly showing support for Biden. He is walking, breathing train wreck!
I agree. Biden can either jump ship, or go down with it.

should endorse me. I’ll get your guns back. Joe Biden is one of them... Join my campaign.
I guess we can rule out Hilary to replace Biden, no way they would release this so close to the election unless cover for others-
“Who has the emotional intelligence and humility to unite a leaderless country, should it come to that? This is the one enormous thing we ask of a vice president, in rare moments, that we ask of no other leader in government.”
Biden better come out and talk to sanders supporters because voting for his name isn't how I choose my candidate.
Biden understands the proper relationship between a president and the Justice Department. Maintain a healthy distance, no micromanaging. How refreshing.
Kewl! Now do Joe Biden!
Surely when you see women whom back Biden and Hillary,you pray for those killed and the poor little girls that Biden loves to touch. You talk out your ass, stand up and relieve the pressure from your little brain.
Biden is a pathological racist. He’ll probably wear a #BlackLivesMatter t-shirt to the debates.

"We are lower than...the world."   I don't think Biden is scared of you at all.  Maybe he's planning to visit Yo-semite.
Why are you covering for Biden, Glenn?  Voters need to see him up front and personal, with no one pulling the plug when his answer goes sideways.  Trump's out there daily, for better or worse, facing his adversaries in the press and I suspect you think that's a good thing.
But dont worry, Joe will save America from the America he built! Its not like Trump isn't doing Biden's dream when he wrote all the laws Trump is using to be a dictator. Don't worry, Joe promised that nothing will change.
obama broke those promises he was too busy playing golf, take expensive vacations and partying what do you think biden will do steal more money and continue obama's legacy by taking even more rights away

Literally everything they accuse Biden of doing is actually something Trump has already done. Trump hides in a bunker, they accuse Joe of hiding. Trump suspected of having dementia and has to get tested, they accuse Joe of having impaired cognitive abilities. It's so transparent
biden does need to take a test for mental issues his actions have proven something is wrong with him pay real close attention he gets easily confuse, loses his temper and likes to sniff hair
I might consider agreeing, but Biden is making this a very unconventional race, and the media are 100% behind Biden. So I’m going to side with Trump on this one.
Let's get past the election first, shall we? It's likely going to be a lot closer than it should be. Anything less than a landslide win by Biden will be contested by Drumpf and his dimwitted base. True to form, he'll prove harder to get rid of than a terminal disease. Count on it
Didn’t Kanye say he won’t be used again?! He’s a Trump puppet, a disgrace to the blk community by working for/with Trump to disrupt our elections. He’s being used to trick us and take votes away from Joe Biden. Anyone that’s serious abt the election sees right thru this bs.
Or they are, using some perverted GOP logic, trying to take the Black vote away from Biden.
I think Biden is a terrible candidate. Hillary was worse.  I am frustrated that Trump and Biden are the best the country can offer. It’s an embarrassment.  In my mind, neither is qualified to be President.

Na, you just think Joe Biden is fine, who wrote the hyde act, who was anti-abortion until it crossed with his VP chances. You think Handsy Joe Biden who was known for groping woman in DC (See Daily Show) was perfectly fine. What am I to think then?
Strange the ACLU had to call CPS on Obama and Biden last time they were around
President should demand Biden In-Person no exceptions!
Really? So the Secret Service agents that I worked with who told me that Joe constantly exposed himself to woman agents lied? Or the ones that he'd force woman agents to watch him swim in the nude. Need a reminder of how many have accused him? Have a list
I guess this is a jab at Biden?  Not sure?  I would think most ppl can recite and understand the Declaration of Independence?
Who wrote the Crime bill in 1994 that locked up millions of black Americans? That was Mitch Mc...Oh no, that was Joe Biden too. Guess what the 13A says? Prisoners can be slaves. Now Joe said he was on the Souths side, so what did he do? Make legal slaves. But go on dude.
Its not like Joe got hammered in the debates for his stance on bussing and other racist things he did. Oh wait, he did my bad. Its not like Joe never said he didn't want his kids to live in a racial jungle, oh my bad, he did. His record is racist
More weird fucking shit out of Biden's mouth.  Why, why, why, and more why.  Ugh.
Just to be clear, I want Biden in-person at the debates None of this video BS
...#Biden IS GROSS!
You think she's talking about Booker? The racist rapist she's talking about is Joe Biden. So where is the lie? Its not like Joe said he was for Slavery or anything... oh wait he did, my bad
Did I ever justify it? No buddy, What I’m trying to convey is that there is an explanation for the decision Biden made when he voted for the Iraq war that goes way beyond what you more than likely know about it. I highly doubt you’ve taken it upon yourself to understand this.
Yet you think Nothing Will Change Joe Biden will change anything? Its the status quo and any vote for him says you don't want change and racism is perfectly okay.
He might as well. If Biden did try to prosecute, the media would just treat it as false equivalency with Trump Sr anyway. More likely, Biden wouldn't bother prosecuting anyone, any more than Obama did the crimes of the W administration. The pardon would take it off the table.
Yeah, what’s he gonna do? Tear the system down? He lost buddy, fair and square. Now, we choose between Biden and Trump. The choice in this scenario is beyond obvious. What’s really sad is the fact that you think that Bernies endorsement of Biden discredits his accomplishments.
That still doesn't prove he's not a racist. Joe Biden "Delaware was on the Souths Side in the Civil War" sounds pretty racist to me. Being BFF's with KKK GrandWizards is pretty racist to me.
Looks like Biden's going to be the first Democrat nomination that's going to try and be President in Basement! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Problem is.....you're best horse in the race for socialists is a guy with dementia.  Zero enthusiasm to run out and vote for Biden.  I haven't seen 1 Biden yard sign.  Guess they're in the bunker with 3 time loser Joe.  Funny!
I told you I wont for a racist. That leaves out Trump and Biden. I'm still making sure the other candidates are not racists. It takes time to research this. I'm sorry that I don't blindly obey and vote as my cult leader demands.

My dad had dementia and I would never do anything you people are doing to Biden.

Yeah, that doesn't help Biden much, but Mr "Yo Semites" and "person man woman camera tv" has fair comparisons to Hitler so I wouldn't go off on his accolades too much.
Some people are under the impression that Biden will prosecute Trump. Why would you think this? He's going to pardon Trump just like every president has done for the president before him. Power protects power before anything else. Biden won't do that because that will set 1/2

Translation:  DNC is scared what he might do or say.    Can't wait to see the Babylon Bee do a piece:  Joe Biden will not accept Democratic Nomination, forfeits race.
I didn’t finish my thought earlier about thinking I was Democrat because I thought poor people were. I did and would imagine some still do. I can’t imagine how anyone could ever support a man like Joe Biden. The job he did with Hunter disqualifies him alone. #4MoreYears #WWG1GWA
If you want to know someone, look to their past. We have 35 years of Joe supporting White Supremacy. Do you really think Biden was VP for any other reason then for the Dems to tell the racists not to worry about Obama at all?
No reflection on Biden, but a wet rag would be a 100x better choice than a "mentally compromised", massively corrupt, compulsive lying, incompetent, 6x bankruptcy, voter suppressing, white supremacist racist, compromised pawn to foreign leaders, Trump.
I can see Biden doing that!
Biden said the KKK GrandWizard was a Good man. Biden said that he was on the Souths side in the Civil War, which was about keeping slaves. But as someone who thinks of themselves as a good person, Stew can't fathom supporting any group that is evil at his core, so he can't see it
Exactly. All Biden has is "Not Trump" and frankly he knows how to sweep everything under the Rug. Trump is too stupid to hide his evil. Frankly the fact that Joe can make folks believe his lies makes him worse than Trump.
You want dumb people in charge? You get a dumb society with NO OIL! Congrats. We will bully the smart people into backing the dumbest people. Joe Biden is an intellectual joke. How is it OK to choose a dumb person when our society desperately needs a hero?
lets check the record shall we? His record says Increase while he says decrease. However, as his record conflicts with his statements, I have to go with his record since he is a known liar. Examples  given to you already.
Joe Biden's record says he is the same evil, worse because he WROTE the laws that Trump is actually using. He still supports his laws to this day.   But go on how this evil magically appeared with Trump and magically will go away under Biden.
So you didnt say a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for Trump? you haven't been saying I must support Joe and I cant vote for anyone but Joe?   Stop moving the goalposts dude. This is why we have Trump, folks like you who refuse to listen to facts.
Jill doing his campaign for him. He has dementia from his two brain aneurysm. Biden and Trump will act like school kids on a debate.
Joe Biden has Dementia and is unfit for office.
My god, how stupid does #BlueMAGA think we are? Its like they expect us to magically forget what happened from 2008 to 16 as if we didn't live the nightmare that was Obama/Biden.
Lack of faith in cb and pedo Biden
I saw one Biden mask a couple of weeks ago in a parking lot. That’s it.
Very diverse neighborhood here. See quite a few Trump signs. But also see some anti Trump stickers on cars. No pro Biden signs or stickers.
Could it be that some of Biden’s VP candidates have secretly dropped out? Avoiding a huge political embarrassment? #Biden
Reporter fellow is not even trying to goad Biden.  Meh.  Biden just has to hold the position and   absorb the attacks until he has "a stroke"  and is replace by whomever.  Jill, probably.
All designed to siphon some of the young, black vote from Biden. Smh
Sure, anyone who doesnt support Joe Biden or Trump. I've shown you why I think Joe is a Racist POS yet you cant defend nor show me how he isn't. You cant refute anything I've said, ero you support a racist, ego you are a racist. You at like Racism appeared with Trump. It didnt
I'm not trying to influence a racist like you. I am thrashing your world view and proving to the rest of the world how much of a moron Biden Supporters are. I proved my points about how bad Joe is and you proved them by refusing to defend Joe.
Because I GAF about protecting her from racism and the military police force that Joe Biden created and wants to give more money to. The fact you dont care about anyone but yourself is telling and frankly the reason why America is a third world nation.
We’re traveling #Colorado statewide, excluding Denver/Boulder. We will be thru September. There are Trump signs, hats, t-shirts, and masks, all over. Absolutely zero Biden anything. It’s uncanny! #copolitics
Any Dem would do the Paris accord which does dick all for the climate. Joe refuses to ban fracking despite saying it in the debates so climate failure there
You are saying that Joe Biden never said that his state was Pro-Slavery. Sorry, but news flash, he did. Thats Racism 101 dude. But have fun supporting a man who thinks slavery was perfectly fine.
AH, so you are a lying Biden Supporter got it. You lied to me about pledging to make calls. You have no right to vote shame if you wont put in the work to get your racist elected. Congrats dude, you are the problem with American and the reason for Trump.
Tell me how many Primaries has Joe Biden on until the DNC rigged it for him to win? He won 0. How many POTUS attempts has he made. 4. How many has he won? 0. How many times has he dropped out for lying? 3.
is for the prison state   is more against the prison state than Joe Biden, but he’s surrounded by psychopaths. The  completely lacks empathy. They only have empathy for people who agree with their religion. Fuck free thought.
But what is Joe going to do to stop Trump? what changes will he make to undo the damage? Joe said nothings going to change. So, guess what, you support Trump since Joe wont change anything he's done. Who started the camps and wall? Biden and Obama. So you approve of that too
Biden, you’re not fit to be the President.
Joe Biden is being exploited. His mental capacity is obviously diminished.
What does this have to do with the convo? Deflect deflect deflect from how bad Joe Biden is. Only thing you have. The Dems say Trumps behavior is acceptable. You support the Dems, ego, you say Trump is fine. Its Nancys job to hold him accountable and she says he's acceptable
Why did Trump defend Putin in the  interview, over our men and women being targeted with bounties by Putin? If you are worried about Jill Biden, and not Trump committing treason, you are a traitor to my country I fought for!
Who gives a fuck?! Biden isn't going to be any better.
That's rich, Trump stealing the election, after how the USPS just endorsed Biden.  Tell me again how that's going to happen?
If facts hurt Joe Biden then he shouldn't be running. Prove a single thing I said as a lie. If Joe can't stand up to his record and have the truth pointed out, and that helps Trump then why is Joe even in this thing? Show me where I lied Stew. Facts matter.
I don't know who I am voting for 100%. Thats the god honest Truth. So why dont you prove to me WHY I should vote for Joe Biden. I've given you every single reason why I'm not but you can't disprove that I'm wrong, nor will you show he's changed. So WHY SHOULD I VOTE FOR HIM?
Prove a single thing I said as wrong. Takes 2 seconds of google to back up a single thing or disprove me. You can't disprove a single thing.   Why should I vote for Joe Biden without using Trump as a reason. What is he going to do to help Americans?
Thats not the topic. The topic is Joe BIden and the Democratic party. Stop deflecting away from them. If you can't stay on topic, then you know you are losing and have zero defense for your support. If I am wrong, prove it. Show me facts but I know you can't and you know it
I guess you just lack the intelligence to understand simple English. I guess that's why you support the DNC and Joe, you lack the reading comprehension to understand what they've done. let me dumb it down for you, are you going to defend Joe Biden and support him?
Are there really people that proudly say I support Joe Biden?
You commented about how many elections Howie has won. Tell me how many primaries has Joe Biden won until South Carolina this year? He won ZERO primaries. He had NEVER won before, yet here we are, Joe's the DNC's racist, worthless candidate. But lets go on about how great Joe is
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Surely the great Joe Biden would be on the left side when it comes to SCOTUS right? Oh wait nope backed the KKK up with Strom and then all but got Clarance Thomas on the court. Lets see where Joe stands on Womans rights. Hyde act, still loves it. Abortion? didn't change until 08
Not Trump Not Biden because I refuse to vote for a man who thinks my daughter shouldn't exist becauae shes mixed race. Why should I vote for the man who created the military police that are killing Americans? Why should I vote for a racist who says nothing will change?
correct, just like joe biden said poor kids are just as smart as white kids. he may not have meant it that way but we all knew the truth. rich white kids who get prep school and a college education paid for have a better chance at being educated than middle and lower class kids
What a hypocrite. Your profile says Black Lives Matter, yet you defend the very group that set them up to be murdered. If BLM, then you wouldn't defend Joe Biden, who wrote the laws that militarized the police and locked up millions of black men.
The Senate has the last word on a lot of things, unfortunately. Thats why we must win the Senate. Without that Biden will be blocked like they did Obama.
I can't wait for the debates! I'm going to buy lots of popcorn! Jill Biden should be ashamed but then again she's a Demorat!
Biden barely can complete a sentence and your worried about Trump? You know “the thing”
Nobody with a brain cell really believes Biden is surging, let alone competitive, at this point. I guess that excludes you and Biden.
The GOP is so transparent. They've had literally months to do this BUT, just like their investigations into Clinton, wait until right before the election.   Are they truly that desperate and why do they continue to kiss Trump's #MorbidlyObese ass?
And anyone with half a brain knows it.  Liberals don't care because they want Joe Biden.  They want anyone, but Trump.
Do you really support President Trump? The video that I just saw shows otherwise. You actually say that President Trump is a bigot. And you say that people should support Joe Biden. Which is it?!
Voting Biden!
SO... BIDEN GOT ENDORSED BY THE REVOLUTONARY COMMUNIST PARTY USA.  NOW THAT IS FRIGHTENING!
There is so much corruption. Where ever you can be best utilized in the Biden administration is where I want you! Get 'em, Liz.
So was it SO tragic and heartbreaking during H1N1 when POS Obama and Biden did nothing?
He should.  Biden would look like a bumbling crash dummy on stage.  The American would know who should be Voted for.  #Trump2020Landslide
Your not doing that with Biden.
How am I an idiot? All you've done is called me a racist and now an idiot, thus proving my point of being Toxic. Why don't you defend Joe Biden? Tell me, what makes Joe so much better this time than the prior 3 times he had to drop out for lying and plagiarism?
Then why don't you defend anything we say? We are saying this is why we wont vote for Biden, with these facts. I want to have a conversation but not a single Biden supporter can actually defend him. They just deflect and act like you do Karen.
once again democrat's helping China giving them all our pork and if you can find it raised prices on us, but they are working for us pelosi and biden keep claiming
Absolutely anyone. I would support a Biden/Rusty Meat Grinder ticket over trump/pence.  Plus I will do whatever it takes to make sure my vote is cast and counted, including crawling across a field of broken glass. Thankfully I live in CO, all VBM!
Yall are dumb. Biden has more billionaire donors than Trump which means he is EVEN more corrupt. Wake up!!! Biden is not on our side!!! There is only one party in this country, the business party and they always win!!!
WHO WANTS AN AMAZING BLOWJOB? Biden? I’m good at screaming “Joe” joe is dead tho
Karen, Karen, Karen, anyone who disagrees with you isn't a Trump supporter. You sound identical to #MAGA AKA #BueMAGA so brainwashed in the cult all you can do is act like a toxic Biden supporter. I'm sorry, with how you treat others in this thread, I cant vote for Joe. Too toxic
0 Biden, Tons of Trump ones. I even see Trump signs all along I 25 here in Colorado. Which is funny, but cool.
Tucker Carlson says it's 'probably illegal' for Joe Biden to pick a Black woman as vice president
He has spoken about debating Biden a lot. But the NYT writes about Biden not doing it because Biden’s in the lead and the debates aren’t needed.
Lets compare Blue Trump to Red Trump. They look pretty much the same thing to me. Lets compare polices shall we as well? Trump and Biden look the same to me as well. Sure in the debate he said no fracking, but he's backed off from that
Such a low bar. Have fun voting for "Nothing will fundamentally change" Biden and expect the camps to close, not build the wall that was started under Obama, help the poor, stop the police from murdering Americans, oh and have healthcare like every other nation
Why not? I retired at 35 so I have all the time in the world to respond to a toxic Biden Supporter like you.
But you are not talking you are just screaming how dare you point out flaws in Joe Biden! How dare you question our dear leader! How dare you not scream that anyone is better than Trump! If Joe is so much better then why dont you prove it w/Joes record? Stop faffing about then
"Biden put brown kids in cages at the border?" Says you didn't know or didn't expect me to know. You brought it back up, thus you are the one stuck on the talking point. Perhaps you should learn to read better?
Biden won't be the final candidate. Maybe the beast will reemerge?
Yes Biden did until the aclu sued him. I've given you proof but you failed to read it
Source for Biden's plan for big drug price increases?
It's only ok to vote by mail. If vote for me that what it sound like what he is saying. It's not safe if vote for Joe Biden.
Due process only for Joe Biden the sexual predator and no one else!!
In Joe Biden’s America, you  and your family will never be safe! You need to pay for your corruption and murder after failed pandemic response (lack of). Lock him up!!!
No wonder Biden has him shook he can't put together a sentence either..
And you think their incomes are going to go down and your healthcare options will get better if Trump is re-elected? This isn't the primary anymore. The alternative to Biden is much, much worse.
Biden is giving more $ 2 PD. Democrats have had 2?raise taxes 2 correct wht Republicans have done b4 them. Taxes will go up 4 the rich, THAT’S his concern. His tax scam 4 the ppl was temporary while rich is permanent. Borders will not be open, he just won’t cage &amp; lose kids.
He’s losing to VP Biden. “It is what it is” He’s the most hated mfer in the world. “It is what it is” He will spend the rest of his miserable life fighting to stay out of prison. “It is what it is”.
Hillary "they put you back in chains"? Biden "you ain't black"? #Dems see you as still Owned-&amp;-Chained. Hear  or   Black Americans see  on HBCU $'s, Economic Zones &amp; Unemp-Rate. #Hydroxychloroquine would've helped save Black Americans
How long is it going to take Liberals to understand that no "leader" or politician is going to save you? Not Trump, not Biden, hell not even Bernie will save you.   You have to save yourself.☭
campaign must assume no debates, no meaningful interviews, VP pick will do 95% of the actual campaigning, all media 100% pro Biden, widespread mail-in voting and ballot harvesting Prepare and plan accordingly.
I wander who writing his twitter comments? Biden cant remember his sentences that long🤣
The Trump campaign is now coming across as desperate for debates.  The Biden campaign has, through sensible non-distancing and virtual rallies, effectively done what Trump cannot--rally a majority of the country.
Nice Try..Now do Biden😏..But not to worry I guess. If Biden wins he won’t be running the country anymore then Obama was..The Washington Mafia will be back in control. Remember that’s who Dems are Really voting for.Not Poor Uncle Joe.(Back to Normal)😉
Sure Jan.  Biden is no Bernie Sanders.  Hes a moderate, well liked, man who actually raised his kids and interacts with them. Now do the great American cad you're pimping
Biden isn’t our president, not his job to do press conferences
Will Biden Be The First Nominee In 80 Years To Refuse A Debate?
"Joe Biden sent his own children to an elite private school, and parades as the Black Lives Matter candidate, yet his policies are openly hostile to the educational choices that offer the best chance for minority advancement."
Dementia Joe cowers in  his basement, allows the Democrat Party to be hyjacked  by Socialists and Communists, and the Party faithful flock together to protect this empty suit.  Biden couldn’t debate Howdy Doody.  Just keep cheering for your feckless candidates.

But of course they (Dems) will be fine with the VP and Dems VP candidate having their debates, but not between Trump and creepy Joe, b/c he'll (Biden) will get DESTROYED.
Biden at debate “You once said you could stand on 5th Ave, shoot someone and people would still vote for you, well... you might as well have stood on Main St in every city and town in America and pulled the trigger, because you killed over 150k Americans, let’s see how they vote”
Drive him from office to what end exactly? To get more of the same ducking policies under a Biden administration?! Go make movies.
Mans is a CRACKHEAD. He already on the excuses.. Biden can't put a sentence together but he already got yalls boy on the ropes.. crazy. SAD.
I'm horrified but I'm also not voting for sleepy Joe Biden.
Think about this though, Biden has had months knowing he’s going to debate Trump, he’ll be ready. Trump on the other hand, he goes in thinking he can win by winging it, he won’t prepare at all. There’s a very real chance Biden will destroy Trump in the debates.
If Biden becomes president, he’s going to cover up what all these famous people,Hilary and Bill Clinton, Obama and many more people who are raping and killing kid’s.They all were Epstein’s friend and would go to his island to help him. I’m so scared for this country #trump2020
Just did a long RV trip with the Family thru Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona,Indiana, Iowa, Wisconsin, Colorado, Nebraska, Michigan and saw Trump signs everywhere.  ZERO, ZIPPO BIDEN SIGNS.
Chuck we love you but it’s time to sit down and let some one else take over maybe you and biden can share a room at the nursing home!  Show some love to the baby killers?
Biden assails Trump for 'bald-faced lies' about voting by mail
Biden isn't any better.
This comment, calling me, a Bernie supporter, a racist because I dared to suggest that she gets off her ass and do something to help Biden. This harassment by Biden Supporters MUST Stop or we just cant vote for Biden at all. When will Joe Biden denounce such toxic behavior?
Named Biden....?? Thought so.
Yes, honey, lets learn how to read. Clearly, something you need to learn. If Biden is so good, why don't you defend him? Why don't you show us how his record isn't being a racist POS like Trump? Defend your guy. Why should I vote for the Blue Racist over anyone else?
"I don't want my children growing up in a racial Jungle" Joe Biden  Strom Thurmond was a KKK Grand Master, yet Joe Biden called him a "Good Man" and one of his closest friends.   Crime Bill, Hyde Act, his entire record, shall we keep going on?
2020 Presidential Debate Candidate 1. Trump Candidate 2. Biden Result-When asked why he was here, Biden said, "When is breakfast? I am so glad to be in Ireland today!" That concludes today's debate.
I fail to see any difference between Trump and Biden aside from Biden's great at hiding things and sweet-talking #BlueMAGA
I think if Joe Biden gets elected in November, all of this COVID bs will disappear shortly after.  #JustAHunch
Yet you called me a racist for not supporting Joe Biden, the man who made the Government that Trump is using. Why would I support the man that created the Military Police force that is Murdering Black Americans? Why would I support the man who deported more than Trump has?
Normally you would be right Mr. President but look who Vice President Biden is running against!
The Democrats could do any better if Joe Biden was president right now we would lose 2 million people to the virus
Right??? I really like Trump as President, but my concern about Joe Biden is legitimate. When you watch the video, watch the lack-of-focus/cloudiness in his eyes. It really is sad. Like if he changed his "legal-will" right now, his kids could make a legitimate case to contest it.
Biden: violent protesters should be 'arrested and tried'
Biden won't last through the 1st one, let alone all 3 that are scheduled, and they want to add more?  Good luck Dems..
Wait, NOW you want my vote? Ive been told many times by Biden supporters that my vote wasnt needed nor wanted. Perhaps the DNC shouldn't have shoved the one guy we said never to. Perhaps you should get to making phone calls like we did for Bernie. Times running out for you
He’s spent all of this time and energy trying to paint Biden as the doddering, blithering idiot, but if he debates Biden, we will all see that he’s the doddering, blithering idiot. I mean, we already do, but to compare them will be eye opening
Everyone: Joe Biden is white. Me: 👿 Y’all don’t understand how I think... Joe Biden is not white like me. He’s not “us” white so he’s non-white in my mind. Honestly... Joe is an old black man. Race is not about color to me.
Maybe. Since we can't go back-in-time we will NEVER KNOW. But based on how the admin handled H1N1 we can speculate it would have been WORSE w/ Biden. "...The  US CDC estimated that 150, 000 to 575,000 people died from (H1N1) in 2009/10..." 80% of deaths &lt; 65 years of age.
You need to find someone else then.
- I believe that would be grounds for an armed mob revolt, as it would subvert the Constitution and pose an imminent lethal threat to the Republic.  We had a king once, didn't work out.  Heard we fought a war over it.
Anyone who’s even Paying any attention to how the MSM operates knows they’ll have to tak about Trump regardless just to lay down cover for Biden..And They’ve always got There Go to Man Obama for Talking points. But they’ll Ignore Biden like the Plaque for obvious reasons.
This is spot on!!!  Tucker: Team Biden releases its plan for America  via
The postal Union endorsed Biden....yeah nothing to see here right?
You and pelosi have done nothing but blame and criticized Trump and when Trump throws a little bit back your way he's the bad guy great leadership there biden
That is temporary, like so many other industrial sectors during coronavirus. Point is we are energy independent now, for the first time in many decades. If Biden wins, kiss saw that goodbye, along with jobs.
Biden supporters exist in mental basements across the country.

Biden has held public office since 1973 and hasn't done much of anything. He sad back seat to Obama and now he's acting like he cares. Come on. Thats a little naive to think after 47 years in politics he actually cares about the little guy, the minorities middle class... sure.
And not support Joe Biden right? He’s against legalization.
Ask Obama, not Ken Olin or Joe Biden.
You’ll be a failed Presidential candidate and a failed VP Candidate if you run with Biden.
And with how ADHD Trump is, he can’t stay on message to save his life... or candidacy. The end result is he changes the focus before anything can take hold. Case in point, when was the last time anyone talked about the Ukraine and Biden?

I saw this coming in January when Soros, Biden, and Sanders made the comment that Covid was the Democrats last attempt at Stopping Trump in 2020! They caused this. REPUBLICANS UNITE! WE CANNOT ALLOW A COUP TO OUR ELECTION PROCESSES. WALK IN AND VOTE! WALK IN AND VOTE! TRUMP-2020!
Mr Biden how can you pick Harris of all people you could cost us the election with her she only cares about her self getting her face out there it was obvious in the debates how can you do this nobody voted for her I wanted her in there then they don’t want her now think please
no all don't believe all of those statements.   it's mind boggling that anyone believes any of that garbage.   biden doesn't know what room he's in in his own home,  there are no unmarked fed militias, the protests haven't been peaceful.
Once again, you have to lie. I’m not upset, I’m amused that you can use your fingertips to google plenty of Joe Biden memes and quotes from the past to wave like your favorite Confederate flag.  But you still can’t do the one thing I asked you to. And we both know why.
Unfortunately, they think life is going to be a free ride, which will never happen, if they cast the Biden vote.
Aye. That is terrible. Why in the hell are people so convinced that we are such terrible human beings? It makes no sense. All hell would break loose if we keyed people's cards for having Biden stickers (not that there are any lol)
did not win the Democratic nomination. He one the VP nomination. The Memes about Joe Biden being best fiends with Obama won the nomination. Joe Biden is an intellectual lightweight. There is no chance he will save the planet. We are running out of time.
Valerie Jarrett Gets Questioned Over Obama &amp; Biden’s Role In Spying On Trump Campaign: ‘You Say You Knew Nothing About It? You Were President Obama’s Right-Hand!’
Biden has a process that started with a lot of potential candidates and added more as they went along. He’s working the process. He initially said beginning of August. OK, so he’ll be a week later. So what? I want this process to be thorough, not rushed.
biden also lost his temper and wanted to fight an innocent American for asking a question, caught on video sniffing hair, accused of sexual assault, and proof of his and his son's corruption we don't need a leader like that no telling what els he will do if he gets in office

Donald Trump today:  “If you elect Joe Biden, McDonalds will stop selling hamberders! I talked to Ronald himself and he assured me, no more hamberders!”
Not to mention worrying about what will come out of Biden’s mouth.
So I guess Trump let it go the last 4 years. By your logic.   Do any of y’all think before you let the world see your ignorance.   VP Biden isn’t in office.
And so his bidding shall be done. You giving Biden that luxury as well?
I’m hoping it turns from a Biden win with no doubt, to a complete blue wave by the time all the votes are counted. It can’t be close or Trump will declare victory and try to stop the counting.
I think that Biden will go on a wartime footing against COVID19 on Inauguration Day, at a minimum, invoking the Defense Production Act, like Trump should have in February, or March, at the latest.
Yeah, at first when you mentioned you weren’t gonna support Biden, I wasn’t a fan of yours. But having learned more about the reasons why our country is headed in this direction, I agree with you 100%. Any candidate who maintains the status quo isn’t going to fix this.
My take on whether Biden should debate DT: Debating with a pathological liar and conman is like wrestling with a pig in the mud. You both get dirty and the pig loves it. #donotdebateTrump
What does Biden have?
I think we need her in a cabinet position, but if Biden chooses her and she accepts, I will vote for them. No matter what.
Await your answer   Watch Biden’s hands. Do you condone his actions?
Instead of a debate where Trump lies, Biden then corrects,  and Trump invading personal space,  I would RATHER see each candidate have 2 hours before a panel of commentators who are Asking "what is their plan for a USA recovery if elected" Otherwise debate is a WASTE of my time

Instead of a debate where Trump is lying, Biden correcting,  and Trump invading personal space,  I would rather see each candidate have one hour before a panel of commentators asking  "what were their plans if elected". There are no set rules since Trump would not release taxes.

And don't forget, selling us (USA) out to China every chance Biden and the Dems get.
I will NOT vote for Joe Biden!  You’re anti American if you do.
Or.... He can just stay in his basement..... With Biden. Let the rest of us try to get thru it.... Without causing too much destruction to an entire country.
Who was the viable woman Biden went up against?
Biden was a wise pick. His long service especially in foreign policy was seen as an addition since Obama was incredibly inexperienced. I voted against Obama 2x and can see Biden was a smart pick.
*Rolls a 20* Game Master: Biden leads Trump by a 10 million vote margin, but Trump gets a two vote margin in the EC, with Kanye West exceeding the margin of Trump’s victory in Wisconsin. Elvish Biden: This is bullshit!
Listen fam I ain’t trying to get into politics on Twitter the mans trump I legally can say anything bad about him but oof and the mans joe Biden also oof y’all need to just love each other and chill out 🤷🏼‍♂️
I'm not voting for Biden.
Joe Biden - Pro Jim Crow “I don’t want my kids to grow up in a racial jungle” - “poor kids are just as bright as white kids” - “If you can’t decide who to vote for you ain’t black”  If you want change please don’t vote for someone who did nothing in 8 years as VP and 40+ in govt.
This Coloradan will vote for Biden and Hickenlooper by mail in ballot. Ditch tRump and Cory Gardner.
Biden has no plan either.
The only other interesting thing on the news this week-end has been observing how many #Dems are doing all they can to say #Biden shouldn't do any debates with #Trump. This too is disgusting on several levels so better to think of what just happened in space. 🚀
I'm not voting for Joe Biden.
Biden has an appendage that HRC lacks
Where Trump will be locked up after being charged with treason and domestic terrorism in January WHEN! he leaves the White House fates losing in November to Biden!
I cannot identify a single beneficial outcome of mail-in voting, versus in-person + absentee voting where necessary. It only “suppresses” the votes of lazy/lethargic people.   The Democrats know that the enthusiasm level for Biden is in negative territory. Too bad!
Biden’s BS is overwhelming!
How the hell is Joe Biden radical left
Who should Joe Biden pick to be his VP? Take the survey today! --&gt;  via  false
The flip side of that argument is that a Biden investment in GA could be what Doug Jones needs to win and one more Senate seat could make a huge difference in how governs, if elected.
are you voting for Biden? Biden who won't debate Trump because he isn't well enough? Biden who has more videos online of him touching and smelling children then of him doing anything to help this country? How can you support him?
Vote Biden because the alternative is worse.  Fucking worst political slogan in history.  Our political system is a joke.  It's billionaires competing with each other and that's about it.  People don't matter anymore and this year made that very transparent.
A few dozen turns out for Biden’s rally, no comparison. Build back better? What’s that?
What invites? Biden’s people won’t even let him answer questions after a press conference.  You think they’d let trump rip him up in a debate?
How can Joe Biden make decisions for America as a President when he can't even pick a VP without F-ing it up. The democrats are in FAKE total denial and know Biden is incapable of making decisions - That's why he's there.
0:33 "no, we're going to go beat Joe Biden fair and square."
//Listen as this former Trump supporter explains why she must vote for Biden this November
It's all smoke and mirrors, Biden is nothing but a decoy.
Why not the same question to Bass? "Have you had the personal private talk with Vice President Biden"? We want to know, have these VP prospects personally spoken or sat down with Biden? In 2016 Bass praised Cuban dictator,  Passing of Castro is a Great Loss to the people of Cuba?
Sounds like you’re sick and tired of winning too. Americans are tired of having more money, more freedom, more hope in the future and more opportunity. Let’s vote in Biden so we can finally get back to losing again.
and you know.. I keep getting these VP polls to my inbox.. sometimes I feel it is like a beauty contest or something or the Bachelorette. Too many polls make it seem desperate ... By now Biden has to have a handle on it..
Not one follow up question? She DUCKed the question, "have you had the personal private talk with Vice President Biden"? Her answer? "They have their own process, I'm going to leave them to it"? We want to know, have these VP prospects personally spoken or sat down with Biden?
Trump was wildly criticized for providing tax relief largely for the super-rich. If Biden get elected, and rolls back Trump’s tax relief, millions of Americans will learn, for the first time, that they were actually “super-rich”.
I think Biden can handle Trump
Serious answer =&gt; Thus far, the Trump “campaign” is horrific.   There are dozens and dozens of things Trump has actually done to make America really great, but his campaign is wasting resources telling us that Biden has dementia. An undeniable fact that everyone already knows.
I can do this all day long. Your ignorance doesn't mean that you are right. You are completely wrong.
This week, next week, next month? Or will we need to wait until Biden becomes president next January?
This is frightening. Trump needs to inform every American voter how he and Republicans will restrain China, versus how Biden and the Democrats will coddle them.
That’s BS. Nothing like that has ever been said. The only side that’s ever said they didn’t want to debate is Biden’s. Trump always is down to debate
Dems breakdown our Great American Culture, pander to individual groups, and applaud victimhood.  What did LBJ say when he passed the  ‘Great Society’ legislation.  “I’ll have those N****** voting Democrat for the next 200 years.”   Biden: “You aren’t Black if you vote Republican”
Won’t happen.  Biden’s mental aren’t there.  Trump would destroy him and expose him
But muh Biden told'd meh so.
Trump thinks he beat Obama in the 2016 election. He said that in his Twitter account yesterday. Trump is deteriorated completely. Biden delays his speech because he stutters. Maybe try to grow a brain dude.
Chris Wallace challenges Biden to follow Trump on 'Fox News Sunday,' says  ex-VP must 'get into game shape'
Again look at what has been accomplished. Quit ignoring them. Even the Post is starting to get it. Why don’t you tweet on Biden’s accomplishments in the last 50 years, not even close and Trump has only been in for 3 3/4 years.
Biden Goes Into Blank Stare After Forgetting Where He Is, Tries and Fails To Pass It Off as Joke
Notice how close obama and biden are standing next to this woman maybe they are both trying to sniff her hair
Joe Biden does not have a clue what’s going on. Let’s see  him debate Donald Trump five times see what happens then. He will destroy Joe Biden in a debate.
For once CNN is right, cause if Biden were to debate Trump, it would show his dementia is prevalent.
Notice biden and obama not social distancing or wearing a mask and yet he points the finger at Trump for not wearing one
biden will forever alter this country he will take Our rights away just like obama did
This countries running out of money but Trump has no control over greedy bank CEO's they don't care that We are in a crisis they still want their money and if they don't get the heartless bastards will throw you on the street but it's always Trump's fault grow up biden
Well Trump is the 1 doing the talking while Biden is hiding in his basement not being let out to speak for fear he'll open his mouth and insert both feet, mumbling about god knows what..
Trump IS a vote Biden bumper sticker
Could you imagine what kind of low life POS it would take to support Joe Biden just for raising Hunger alone. Not to mention sexual assault and sniffing woman and touching little girls.
I believe that President Biden will. We’ll have to give him time though after you completely flushed us down the toilet Trump! You’re job approval rating is 🤮.
Can't wait to see Biden in a real interview and asked real questions. Trump/ Biden debates!! Bring out the real Biden. No setup questions from pre arranged media and to teleprompter to read from! Last outing here had to look down at notes to find out where he was!
What the fuck?  If Biden STFU about everything and campaigned solely on M4A he would flip Texas and make Republicans irrelevant in national politics forever.
Okay, then you know shit about American politics if you think Biden and Clinton are right wing. Stick to Norway.
Let's see.   is a registered Democrat, supported Hillary Clinton throughout 2016, holds strong liberal views, and is planning to vote for Biden this fall. Yep, sounds so right-wing. You have a bad case of the brain worms. In fact, your head is pretty empty.
I am very excited to vote for Joe Biden and end the complete disaster that has been the trump presidency.
Biden was part of the team that FIXED the last CRASH FROM A REPUBLICAN. Trumps Republicans did a tax scam in the back room. Ryan got on Twitter bragging abt $1.70 increase. Our taxcut is TEMPORARY, while the rich is PERMANENT.  OPEN YOUR EYES MAGA!
Are u calling Obama 1 too? Ur logic would have every official the last 12 yrs being molesters. U seem 2 have ignored the case started in Fl b4 Biden was in WH. Epstein was charged in 2005, Trump hired ppl who let him off.  But go after Biden while every1 talking abt Clinton. SMDH
We the people want a real president now!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸 Biden🇺🇸🇺🇸
Like everything else Trumps involved in, there’s no plan and no one knows wtf is going on.  Trump is CAOS‼️  In the meantime VP Joe Biden has a plan. We know who’s speaking when, how many will be there and the media is welcome.  Now that’s a leader.   #VoteJoeBidenToSaveAmerica
Unemployment is at 11% BECAUSE OF THE NATIONAL DEMOCRAT SOCIALIST PARTY.  Under Biden it will be 70%.
Almost everything that you’re called a conspiracy theorist for seems to make about as much sense as It does to back joe Biden.
Biden is MOST CERTAINLY a perp!! Constantly sniffing out his next victim!! #WAKEupANDwalkaway!!!! RUN! Dl$NEY'S Massive Medi Empire   via
The administration from the beginning have refused to deal with this as what it is- a public health crisis. They tried to treat it like an economic crisis. Until the virus is taken seriously, by this administration (or hopefully by a Biden administration) ...
Is this real? If so why isn’t this being talked about LOUDER‼️‼️‼️‼️😡😡😡😡😡
I can be patient, timewise, but I'll never be okay with Biden letting these old white men talk shit about the BW being vetted..
Biden could tell these old, white men in his orbit, to shut the fuck up and stop denigrating the women (and esp the Black women) he's vetting. It speaks volumes that he hasn't. 😡
I’ll wait till Biden gets in before I inject anything.    The world’s largest vaccine maker will mass produce an unproven COVID-19 vaccine candidate
Because Biden made a promise to bring on a female VP. I feel the same as you. Gender doesn't matter to me. What matters to me is qualifications and getting Trump out of office.
I meant to say that was in 2016. We saw then how they were going to put forth the candidate they wanted to win, and it's no shock they did it again for 2020. The shock is that Biden is the best they could do. /2
Again, give me a viable 3rd party option and I'll vote for them. If my ballot says "Trump" or "Biden" I'm not voting for Trump and I'm not sitting it out.  What getting Biden in does is shuffle the pieces again, instead of leaving the board as it is for 4 more years.
Biden is shit. Trump is shit. But Biden is shit with peanuts. /3
But I may be wrong. What 3rd party candidate has a chance to win, and not just split the vote like 2016? I despise Biden and don't want him as  president. But I despise Trump more. /4
Power taken is not released willingly. Hence why if Biden takes over, nothing will be done about corporate donors/dark money, defunding police, reforming the prisons, any of it. We need a party of the people. Voting 3rd party in this election won't work until that happens. /3
We have to work to build something new from the ground up. Vote for a "lesser" evil to keep the scales from tipping over to "full" evil again, but never forget none of them work for us no matter who is in the seat. And Biden is horrid. But Trump is worse. /2
The first thing you say to me is name calling? Back at you, troll.   Look at the big assumptions on you. I never said I wasn't voting. I'm voting for Biden because that's the shit sandwich they are serving. I expect nothing good to come from him, but "he beats Trump" as they say.
So you think biden is better right? If I'm not mistaken all of trump's accusations where dropped. Biden on the other hand there is video proof of racism and pedophilia. You just sit and believe whatever the media wants you too right?
The fall guy. No one in this dictatorship does anything without Trumps command. That’s my opion and I’m sticking to it. SMDH   President Biden will need to restructure a lot of agencies.
If Biden wins there will be a miracle cure ie. Mandatory vaccination for all Americans a week after he’s sworn in... “V for Vendetta” was a documentary.
They are polar opposites, there is nothing to debate. We already know Biden, we already know Trump.
"Always has. Always will." Sure, when a Republican isn't in charge after the crash. So I expect you're going to vote for Biden to save your capitalism. Good choice. But he's basically an old school Republican, so it may not work.  As for "always," everything ends. Everything.
Biden is the worst solution for the USA!  WAKE UP PEOPLE!!
I would actually prefer he didn't debate Drumpf. Being honest here, I don't have a lot of confidence in Biden's skills as a debater. Inevitably, with Drumpf, things would roll into the gutter, and Biden doesn't want to go there. Let Drumpf doom himself, just by being himself.
So pathetic how Trump haters will always find something to complain or "laugh" at.  If there would have been a HUGE turnout your heads would be spinning around and everyone screaming about covid.  This time you do the childish giggles.  Makes sense why you'll be happy with Biden
"With leaders such as Biden &amp; Feinstein it’s clear why we’re now facing an increasingly antagonistic China. Decades of failed leadership have passed problem down &amp; those leaders are still around trying to drive us farther down this road."
Of course but that's not going to happen. Biden WILL debate Trump.
Why? Joe Biden built the system Trump is using. Why would they be relived to have Joe "Nothing will fundamentally change" Biden in charge? Nothings changing, the USA still hates its citizens and terrorizes the rest of the world.
Biden is stringing this VP pick too long…!!! Now it’s next week???
You are entitled to your opinion, but I've studied the 20th century extensively and this is more akin to Cuba. The difference is antifa is backing the "Castro" side. This will only lead to a communist takeover. If Biden is elected he will be the figure head with no power.
I don't know who I will vote for at this point. Where I live it probably doesn't matter anyway because we were one of the states Hillary won. I may libertarian. I will continue to fight against Biden, not for Trump. It would be a disaster it Joe gets elected.
In all honesty I don't like Trump. He's abrasive, but I don't believe he is everything the MSM has said about him. He has done good things and bad. On the whole I think he has tried. I would love to have better options in Nov, but in reality it will be him or Biden.
Trump campaign spokesman rejects claims Biden only wants to 'redirect'  police funding
From 2 Brain Surgeries To Dementia To Possible Incontinence – Why Joe Biden Will Not Be President
Ever notice the difference between Trump, Biden, and Obama’s tweets?   writes his.
So you support a racist ? You are black . I grew up and my mother grew up in Detroit . You are following the wrong mother fucker . Joe Biden has suffered horrible pain to loss . Much like my friends . He is a racist . Please  Jay . Fight like John Lewis .
I’m not saying that other social media sites are not also at risk here but, it has been proven that TikTok is much worse in terms of what they have actually done!   Also, Joe Biden has told his campaign staff to delete the app as well. This is not a partisan issue
Does anyone know any police officer who is voting for Biden? Please share for better results.
#TikTok is getting banned just before the US election because they won’t shadow censor. Watch the video at the top of my profile  I will win the Presidency. I will save the Consititution. Joe Biden is not who you think he is. I need your backing.
Oh yeah, Nunes is smart. A Ukrannian spy sent him secret info on Biden. The intel committee found out when they got the shipment invoice from DHL.   Uh Devin, anything you want to tell us?
Ha ha ha! Vigorous questioning? Biden cant even remember to piss without someone holding his hand. He is brain dead as it gets.   #FoxNews
I’m not understanding this argument. Don’t we want a VP who wants to be president? Some of the VPs in recent decades were people who ran for president, even against the candidate who won the nomination. Kennedy/LBJ, Reagan/Bush. Gore and Biden ran for president before being VP.
Nothing about this makes Biden look weak. The competition for his VP spot simply underscores the fact that he's positioned well to be our next President and people are hungry to see their person get the nod.  Biden is fine. The process is fine. It's just politics.
Already did with Biden
Just curious for comparison on your Left to Right scale, who would you consider “Far Left” in American politics, “Center” and of Biden is “Far Right”, what would that make someone like Ted Cruz?
I figured out why there is such a coin shortage everyone is melting them down to make bullets in case biden gets elected I mean when biden gets done using black people for their votes and rigging the election
When the democrat's are done it will be the end of Our country won't be surprised if china's navy ends up on our shores if biden gets in
Wallace is just trying to egg Biden into coming on his show. Good for ratings and exposure.
Did I mention that obama brought in thousands of Muslim's and told them they don't have to obey American laws which means they can oppress women in America maybe that's why him and biden get along biden believes in that too
Late we have lost faith in you. I can't fathom why you ran for a position in leading and you won't lead. Good luck but I will be voting Biden. You could have been great
If biden wins will pelosi be saying this is the most fraudulent election in history I know I will the man should even be allowed to run for office bill got kicked out for less
A strong VP is far better than one perceived as a weak woman nicely put in her place. We want a woman being groomed to be President after Biden! Female deferring to anyman personna is not VP material.
So Biden is turning us into Wakanda? I'm down to giving it a go.
Hey  how about hiring a team of social workers for your convention. Or, just hold it in Biden’s basement, and keep the door locked.
Honest Question:  what specifically did Trump do wrong in relation to the Covid-19 response?  When Biden was asked what he would do, he failed to provide a single suggestion that hadn’t already been implemented, that is after he said Trump was xenophobic bc of travel bans.
More like dictatorship and domestic terrorism from you the scum of the the earth traitor in chief who WILL! be losing to law and order and the new sheriff in two Biden in November! Get packing!
First things first, sure. As long as there's a "second thing" next and it doesn't end there. Trump is a symptom – like leaky pus – but he isn't the disease, and Biden isn't going to be the great savior they are saying. He's a bandaid on our Democracy's hemorrhaging wound at best.
I wonder how people will feel if they have to pay another $5,000 in higher taxes for the average family under the #Biden plan. Seems to me a pandemic is not the time to raise taxes but to lower them. Trump's temporary payroll tax break seems sound to me all things considered.
Basically life long politicians like #Biden understand raising taxes better than job creation and growing an economy without raising taxes. Raising taxes is always the first thing they think of because to them its their money, not We The People's money.
Are you just mad that Bill Clinton is now pretty much confirmed to be a pedo?
The #Dems and #Biden want to raise taxes. What they don't tell people is most increases in taxes are offset by corporations by passing them on to those who can least afford them. If Biden undoes  tax cuts, will this include large family &amp; child credits too?!
Don't overthink this.  is combative, blunt, maybe not as likable as Bass, but great experience and 100 times the name recognition. I follow politics closely and had no idea who Bass was. Biden-Harris is the strongest possible ticket. Keep it simple.
Biden's go to "moves" are  wrong for everybody else ?
If you really think President Trump wants to postpone the election, you just don't get it. The Dems always do what's opposite. This is his way of getting them to cut their crap about mail in voting. Love this guy!  If he really wants to postpone until Biden debates him, I'm good.
Right!!! No way am I siding with Biden and Jo... Uh... I think the libertarian party is off its rails... Even What's his nuts that Mark endorsed is going a little nutty....
We are very pleased to have a President, Donald J. Trump,  who loves and serves the United States of America. He and his family are lifted to the Living God each and every day by our family. If Joe Biden becomes our president, our country is lost.
I don't think it's radical at all, but if you look at Biden's Climate Plan, it's a whole lot closer to The Green New Deal than his original plan after working with Bernie. So I think there's real hope of things getting done.
Biden's crime bill, Lyndon Johnson promoting welfare and encouraging single mother homes, destroying the nuclear families.
Stop republicans who collide with foreign intrusion and misinformation.  Seriously.  Call your senator/confess rep.  #ImVoting4BidenBecause #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #firetrumorepublicans. Devin Nunes won't say if he got foreign info meant to damage...- CNN
At least Trump isn’t in the Biden basement!
This is the last gasp of the DNC. "Settle for us!" I find it funny that Biden himself can't give a speech where he outlines how he'd be better than Trump.  If he really knew how to fix the US, why didn't he ever tell Obama?
98% of the black people I asked said they didn't vote for obama a second term and 99% of the people over all said they didn't so how did obama win a second term, obama is the most corrupt president We had and did nothing but take rights away from Us so will biden
Walmart great example of the obama administration taking Our rights away obama told them to down size slowly so Americans won't notice that the democrats are controlling what We buy and eat and We are letting it happen biden will continue with Obama's work
wake up America the obama administration started taking our rights away and biden and obama are bed buddies biden will continue to take Our rights away and use covid to do it with
She wants PEDO, dementia Biden running this country? How many decades in government. #TrumpLandslideVictory2020
Omg! It’s not about the mail or the drop boxes! It’s about forged signatures! How many do you think they can actually verify. Of course your a Biden supporter so you probably won’t understand this. Your party is dispicable parading a sick man around for people to laugh at.
Because just like now, Joe Biden won't be writing them.
UTT Reviews Joe Biden's Speech to Hamas/Emgage July 20, 2020  via  Keep ALL your eyes 👀 open ... because big you’ve never been STABBED IN THE BACK ... you won’t realize it’s coming 😡
I just think he's a dodering old fool and with huge grassroots support people like AOC, Bernie, and company can bully the absolute piss out of him.   I'm more concerned with Pelosi's do-nothing, republican-enabling ass than I am with Biden.
Biden is shit, but he can be bullied by congressmen and congresswomen who actually want to get something meaningful done about the deep problems we face.  I'm fully prepared to be disappointed, but that's my two shiny pennies.
Fun fact: I tweeted a funny response to a Joe Biden tweet an hour ago!   Lost 3 followers...  Full disclosure: I do not support Donald Trump...

Dear America: If you want to know exactly what life will be like under a Biden presidency, just watch the entirety of  ‘s hate laced, racist rant, today at the #JohnLewisFuneral Remember, “elections have consequences”!
GREAT POINT Bobby! BIDEN HAS A HISTORY OF FOOT IN MOUTH DISEASE AS WELL AS BEING PALS WITH THE LIKES OF KKK ROBERT BIRD AND HIS COMMENT ABOUT SEVEN ELEVENS AND WORKERS WITH A SLIGHT INDIAN ACCENT! OLD BOY BIDEN NEEDS TO BE HIDEN FROM HIS BIG MOUTH FROM BACK IN THE DAY!
A glimpse of life in America in 2021 if Biden wins. Biden has  already promised to recreate the Obama administration.
Qualified or not he was elected. You can be as upset as you want. The reality is Trump or Biden will win. I'd rather someone that at least knows who he is and where. It does sometimes come down to the lesser of evils.
I knew you HAD to reply Why? Deep down inside the truth hurts! Instead of posting cute little hand pictures or doom and gloom videos, try picturing your cup half full! You leftists Dems are angry and bitter people. Sorry Trump whooped your Chickie in 2016. Now? Sad pitiful Biden
What the far left don’t want to hear, is that Biden may actually be able to accomplish more left policies than Bernie ever could. Because you can accomplish more through comprise, than you can through purity.
At least you didn't fall for the sleepy Joe Biden. You should work on the rest though. There are a lot of things you believe that are just not so.
...... Well fuck me if I'm wrong, but seems like people don't actually LIKE Biden... They'll just vote him because he's not Trump.....
I really hope he chooses Susan Rice. She has national experience that Biden needs. She has a good reputation with other countries and the GOP too.
Why do all the Obama and Biden sheep keep trying to blame Trump for the cages that were built and used during the Obama administration??? 🤔
But you refuse to answer my question. When is a good time for a change? I'm not lecturing, I'm asking why should we settle for "Nothing will fundamentally change" Biden? The fact you think I am and refuse to answer tells me you know he's a bad option.
Witnesses should be called. Begin with Biden.  Appeals court schedules do-over for Flynn case.
That's funny, because you parrot everything the dems say. You don't have any trouble labeling me as a Trumper without knowing more, so I'm going to go with you are a stereotypical Democrat, Joe Biden lover. I think that's fair.
I’m not, your friend is. You love pedo Biden.
His enablers, the Repugs that support him scare me. People that use his ignorance to further their own agenda scare me. On his own, he’s a joke. But he has gotten away with stupid scary shit for years because of the people around him enabling him.
Great response Pickles! What is Biden talking about (top 5 questions of 2020)? So, he'll continue to hide what he's doing? He wants us to trust MSM? Heck no! I love #ourpresident speaks directly to the people.  Can't wait to vote #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Biden says you’re not Black enough if you’re not a Democrat.   I can only assume, in Herman’s case, if you’re a conservative and enormously successful, you’re not really Black at all.
obama guilty of treason, fail the black community with his broken promises, used the black community to get in office and now biden is doing the same thing Trump has done more for the black community then you ever did democrat's only know how to blame others
You Biden is a pedophile, rapist, lier ,racist and a thief, yet the democrats adore their drooling she'll of a person.
I got in trouble for just hugging a kiddo once. He ran up to me and wrapped his arms aroind me and I hugged him back. The princeple said that wasnt allowed anymore. Id never touch a kid the way Biden does
Who wants to bet John Lewis will vote for Biden...by mail?
Hey  I just wanted to know if you still stand by this
She didn't get Biden's VP choice so she's trying to get as many look at my DUMB ASS time as possible.
DAN YOU HAVE NAILED IT! AS AN 81 YEAR OLD LIFETIME REPUBLICAN; WHO REGISTERED IN THE SOUTH WHEN I REACHED VOTING AGE. THE REASON WAS THAT DEMOCRATS WERE THE KKK, SEGREGATIONIST, AND RACIST! BIDEN'S BEST FRIEND BACK IN THE DAY, ROBERT BIRD, A DEMOCRAT AND GRAND WIZARD IN THE KKK!
Make that Russia of bust since you blindly deport a traitor who sides wifi them and doesn't support our troops! American will be great again WHEN! Biden wins in November!
Did u just get off the phone with Putin &amp; he reassured u? If Biden doesn’t win, (He Will) since U said it’s going 2 be rigged maybe he should ask 4 a recount.  Did some1 tell u, U can’t stop an election? HTF did we get a fake patriot as POTUS who Doesn’t know the constitution
My Dad lived to 93, and had severe dementia for at least 8 yrs. suffice it to say, that he never appeared to be as “out of it” as Biden does every day.
Irony of ironies, “progressives” are the most regressive people you’ll ever encounter. Just in the last couple of months, they’ve transported race relations back to the 1940’s. I guess they want Biden to fix it again.
I pitied but admired the courage of Obama for stepping in to clean up Bush 43 mess. I now have the same feelings for Biden.
I don't know what is sadder, that you believe your crap, or the look you will have when Biden is trounced.
This is setting up so Trump can claim the election was rigged and he will fight it and refuse to give it up. He will not peacefully transfer power to Biden.
Lunatics.  Biden supporters.
When are the videos of Biden going full blown racial during his speeches about blacks going to go mainstream or has the Marxist LEFT forgiven THEIR PUPPET ???
About as offensive as Biden claiming that if you’re not Democrat, you’re not really Black.
It was Clyburn's backing of Biden in South Carolina. They f'd over Bernie with that endorsement. Sly Cly was paid off.
Nopety. If I was, I’d say Biden, like so many others are, just ta screw with em’. If you’re a reg. Rep, chances are very slim you’ll ever get polled. It’s how they do. 🙄🙄🙄
Fact Check: Biden Did NOT Kneel At An American Flag In His Hometown
Because then Biden couldn't be their presidential candidate.
Peter, I love you and made a lot of money following your advice with metals and miners but you have no idea what you are talking about when it comes to the re-election of trump. I literally agree with every single thing you say except that Biden will win the next election.
I think Biden can only win if he dyes his gray hair, so it looks like a cross between a dead blonde fox and a translucent tsunami.
You've expanded my Green Book theory of Biden's success. I'm more convinced now than ever.
I assume you’ve seen how many people I’ve contacted ⁦ in the government. Still, 0 views on most videos. The gov censoring my views was started by the Obama administration. Joe Biden is an extreme fascist. You can’t support him.
Ya it’s funny that you can edit Biden to look dumb, but all daddy has to do is open his mouth
Dear America:  It’s NOT about a virus  It’s NOT about Black lives  It’s NOT about Biden  It IS about removing Trump  Every voter needs to know why they need to vote FOR Trump, not against Biden.   #FeebleManBad ain’t gonna cut it!
Joe Biden ..ahaha..Kanye West has better odds..halfwit
Why? Give us your reasons for voting FOR Biden. Not reasons to vote against Trump. Explain what is so wonderful about an old man with dementia that Suddenly he is the answer?
Pelosi would lose her mind, twitching like she got tased by the Ice Cream Man. and the whole BLM Riots thing goes as limp as the Rioters at 6 am. The Squad would be sounding like Biden. Come on Man, take a shot, they aint done nothing for you.
Dry hump with Trump or sliden with Biden!
HAHA, that's what Biden wants, someone strong, able and willing to take on the Presidency understanding what it entails. Harris would also be great as the next att gen. Trump belittling Harris will go nowhere with her. Trump fears Harris!
Donald Jr...it is sad how pathetic you are...IF Biden was disabled, you would have no excuse for your comments.  IF Biden is not disabled, you would have no reason for your comments...Hmm I wonder what your motive could be, maybe power and domination?
And this has what to do with the elderly abuse they are putting Biden they??
The victim card. It’s pretty short sighted to say that. Hell I see more right wing white males crying about being oppressed than anyone right now. I’m not say Biden is the end all be all. I’m saying I’ve had four years of Trump and it sucked, he’s done nothing and it’s time to go
George HW Bush was Reagan’s main rival for president in 1980, before Reagan chose him to be VP. Gore ran for president before Clinton picked him for VP. Biden ran for president before Obama picked him for VP. Kennedy/LBJ too. Why would presidential ambition be an issue now? 🤔
Biden is all about secret laws. Biden used to stalk me after I did a hunger strike protesting the FBI giving middle schoolers free drugs. Robert Mueller got fired. Biden is going to prison. He is mediocre and greedy. We need a president who will save the planet.
This has been my prediction for how Biden's nomination was going to go from the very beginning. The running mate would assume office in his stead.  Initially, I thought it would be Hillary, but Michelle was my second guess.  Kamala Harris never registered on my radar.  We'll see.
The POTUS is asking Twitter what is going on with our allies.   Can you imagine if Obama or Biden asked suck a stupid question?
I’m sure obama is giving his input, too. I’ve read that he’s also met with many of them. I feel like Biden likes th idea that he’s passing the baton to the next generation. He got along so well with Obama. I can see him looking for someone he can mentor
I hope it’s not a secret to Biden, lol. I mean, that’s what I’m hoping for,  but will he really agree to only one term?
You need purpose. Come join my campaign. Seriously... You could be a speech writer. We’d be the funniest executive branch in history. Once the story comes out that there’s no Austin Bomber confession, neither Trump nor Biden have a shot.
Obama’s are very out of shape and Biden is 🤪🤪code 2 work out and the stimulant shots wearing off
It’s called an election. The higher the COVID death toll, the larger Biden’s margin of victory. It’s chapter 1 in the book entitled “How to destroy a nation with just a virus and some well orchestrated riots”.

Biden will never be an acting president.They will have him deemed unstable if he wins and his VP will actually be president.Think about that for a moment.If in fact Pelosi tells Biden to pick K. Harris(what? You actually thought Biden gets to pick. You funny)she will run things
Trump will turn on Pence and blame the terrible Covid response on him and then run Nikki Haley. Just to try and get some excitement going for his base.  I'm ready for Biden/Harris to happen.
Why are none of the Republicans working? I have heard nothing of them working to get the virus controlled or help the people struggling. Do they not have to work any more till Biden takes over? Because Trump's on his way out they don't work?
Joe Biden has been "fixing" things since the 1970s.  Do things look fixed to you?  This logic exercise didn't go the way you anticipated, I'm sure.
Now do Biden, a politician since the 70s.
Yeah.....Joe Biden.....he's a big thinker and a incredible speech maker.  Can't wait to see him against President Trump in a debate.  Then people will realize what a big thinker he is.  How could Trump compete with his level of intellect?
Trump is only person putting any real work into Biden’s campaign.
Biden photographed with Kamala Harris talking points as running mate speculation grows  #getwokeness
I mean Trump literally just tweeted TODAY that he is supporting the rollback of provisions meant to alleviate de jure segregation. Bringing up stuff Biden voted for 25 years ago isn't really going to prove your point when your guy is doing this stuff right now.
Biden repeatedly forgets his location and the subject on which he is speaking in mid-sentence. The most recent example was just yesterday. Slandering Trump will not change the fact your POTUS candidate is plainly descending into dementia.
Nice try. The same could be said about Biden and the Dems. Alinsky much?
Like Obama did when he had democratic majorities (or even supermajorities) in the house and senate? All we got then was watered down Romneycare which was a gift to the health insurance industry. Biden is to the right of Obama. You're delusional.
It's called exploitation and elder abuse.
Dem media polling evidence fully supports the shy Trump voter hypothesis. Despite Trump supporters being far more enthusiastic to vote than Biden supporters, the Dem media polling has Biden winning the horse race against Trump with Reagan level margins. Massive disconnect.
Will your taxes pay the extremely high welfare and food stamp program explosion that will happen if that perv Biden wins?  Oh yeah money is free for those programs, stupid me!

#StillYourPresident  LOL  Y'all really should have put of a decent candidate in 2016.  Who are you gonna actually run in 2020, instead of biden?
Then we’ll either have a shitty president or a shitty president. There are no good options. I really wish you’d have attacked Biden as hard as you attacked Hillary then there might actually be hope for the future
1) Putin is having a party 2) The other countries have increased payment 5 yrs in a row. Biden was VP when it started.  Trump has used our $ has his personal account. He’s signed budgets for military funds then takes it back for his bs. He’s made the world less safe.
Totally agree. Trump campaign is as feeble as Biden, currently playing only defense, and playing it from the dugout. Pathetic.
It’s NOT Trump v. Biden. It’s Trump v. Never Trump.  Never Trump strategy =&gt; Hide, deny and distort every single Trump accomplishment.   Trump strategy =&gt; Biden has dementia.  Trump strategy should be to proclaim and explain every accomplishment, over, over, and over again 24x7!
It's ok, at least he doesn't think his Covid tests are cognitive tests like Biden.  "I get those daily", lol, Good Luck with your nominee if he isn't suicided before the convention.
I hate Biden but. Imagine if Biden said half the shit Trump says. Would #maga Support him?  #NobodyLikesMe
If the state of America on July 29, 2020 doesn’t put fire in the belly of every single Republican alive, nothing ever will. That said, they are doing absolutely NOTHING, and Trump’s campaign is still trying to convince us that Joe Biden might have dementia. 😞
I would have loved nothing more than for Bernie Sanders to be in Biden’s place. But the reality is this: The broken system that is in place had no room for Bernie.

This is my only hesitation with governor Whitmer as Biden's running mate. Michigan has been through so much and she seems to be a great governor. However, my impression is that you also have a solid Lt. governor who would follow in her footsteps.
Yes, I am....   And I am NOT a member of the 7th - I will not blindly follow an ass like Custer was.  I WILL vote for Joe Biden and whomever he chooses as a running mate.  I will do my damnedest to defeat the orange shit-gibbon.
Ok. I’m not really voting for Yeezy, as much as I believe he’d do a fine job, it’s clear that the only reason he’s receiving assistance from Republicans to get his name on the ballot is in their twisted hopes that he will take valuable votes away from Biden. Don’t fall for it.

Why waste time with useless question about Biden's faith  Why do you use Republican talking points  Don't think I hear you all asking Republicans why they won't give and compromise with Democrats  Republicans are trying to give LESS to people  Why isn't that a point

Biden should pick Michelle Obama and watch the entire right wing lose its mind!!!!
Biden didnt even type this one out,he can barely shit without a diaper,get real
Because God wants us to be racist, bigoted, greedy, inhumane and corrupt. And Biden is not. Therefore Biden hurts God.
Yes, saying Trump and Clinton are both bad in 2016 is why we are here. If we can’t see that Trump is so many times worse than either Clinton or Biden, then this country deserves the worst that will happen under another 4 years.
She’s correct.  She has made it very clear many times that she WON’T be voting for Trump, yet she’s also not saying who she intends to vote for.  There are always many choices on a ballot, so she will either vote for Biden or one of the other non-viable options.
Is it ok to vote for KW nstead of Biden. If a vote for Sanders is a vote against JB, then a gote for KW, is a vote against 🍊🤡.
OH! MY! GOD! The level of privilege &amp; ignorance &amp; audacity!  Attention America! Let’s make sure Biden’s VP meets S.E.’s standards, bcuz apparently that’s more important than saving our democracy from a raging lunatic dictator with major mental issues!
... do you think biden is better????
Or I care for reality as I perceive it affecting myself and others, and so care about stating whether or not I think it's relevant to me, personally, whether Biden cares about the bible -- because I recognize that I'm a member of a larger population.
It’s simple people, you either vote for Biden or you can be one of the people who must take responsibility for the death of America.
I think it’s safe to say Joe Biden’s mental state is a train wreck. I sorta feel bad for the guy.
Thank you for taking time to reply. That helped me understand better. Just for clarification - from this point of view, would Trump and Biden winning be equally horrid, one less horrid than the other, or it’s too messy to say?
Want to stay healthy? Vote for Biden  Want to keep your family safe? Vote for Biden  Want businesses to come back? Vote for Biden  Want to go to bars and restaurants and beaches? Vote for Biden  Want your kids’ schools to open? Vote for Biden   Want freedom again? Vote for Biden

What. The. Fuck. Do I HAVE to care what the bible says?  Me, I'd rather care about what's going on hereabouts.  And so. Why should I care if Biden is "for" or "against" it?
Can somebody please break down their POV on why it’s more oppressive for me to vote for Biden than a more progressive person in this voting system? I almost understand it in theory but I don’t quite see how it pencils out. (4/5)
The way I see it, there’s a higher chance of progressive legislation getting passed, progressive justices appointed, etc. under Biden than Trump. That could potentially lead to a better voting system being established in the future. (3/5)
I want to see more progressive leadership than what Biden has to offer, but I don’t see a candidate besides the major 2 party ones ever winning with the the electoral college and without a ranked choice voting system. (2/5)
Lmk if I need to shut up, but I feel inclined to say I would reinforce the 2 party system and vote for Biden because I’m scared to see the US with 4 more years of Trump. (1/5)
Biden is the ultimate racist. President Trump is the least racist president in history.

Stuart Stevens on Biden, "That which he has, becomes very needed by the country.  The country is in a period of grief now.  He's experienced more than most people, deep grief and has rebounded and can process it and help the country process it.
If you don’t vote for Biden, then you ain’t black.
"Hurt God" -- That whether Biden would do this or not is scary as hell.  "God" seems like it should be the least of our concerns while people die needlessly from starvation, homelessness, or lack of medical care -- like from pharmaceutical control of medications. Ugh.
Biden is against God and religion? Really, #YosemiteScam? I'm pretty sure he could discuss the bible far more cohesively than you have.

I’m more ashamed of CNN constantly going out of their way to boost Biden while berating trump than I am of trump doing what he’s always done.
He worships money. Biden is a lifelong Catholic as is a longtime friend of mine also from Scranton. Both are also  gun owners. Not only has Trump rarely been to church, I bet he’s never fired a gun.

Sorry - too many red flags when Joe Biden needs to get this one right. I know she does good work for her district but Rep. Bass is looking like a potential lightening rod. Plus, Florida is a swing state. It goes red if he selects her.

Agreed. But the NBA isn't exactly reaching new audiences with their protesting. Nonetheless, it ensures the players are on the right side of history. If Biden wins and police start magically being held accountable, will they stand? I don't see that happening, unfortunately.

Ummm... YOU are solely responsible for the current loss of jobs and our house of cards economy. Biden is the ONLY shot Americans have at having their investments survive. Dem presidents have rescued cratered economies from the last to republican presidents, they can do it again!
Being a fairly recent  defector, the most positive sign I’m seeing is, a large number of my republican colleagues, and, Veteran brothers will be voting for Biden. I believe this will be the silent majority that  foolishly believes will be a strength.
Yet Biden leads? Only the dullest Tools believe Democrat Propaganda.
Joe Biden is going to rip away a certain victory from Howie Hawkins. He needs to drop out right now. He is spoiling the election.
Trump will win.  If you extrapolate the current trends and nothing changes, Biden will win.  But why would you assume, with Trump in the mix, nothing changes???  That's like dropping a nuke and predicting no damage - based on polls.  Trump is the nuke, Biden is a sitting duck.

Uh, you already did that, Donny. Democrats are pretty used to coming in and cleaning up after republicans. Biden will come in and fix the sh!t storm you're left behind.
He can fake it &amp; change his tone all he wants. He’s spent nearly 4 yrs showing Americans who he really is—a cruel, ruthless, racist, ignorant, bumbling mobster with dementia. NO ONE WILL FORGET! But, guaranteed he’s planning to drop some fake Biden bomb just b4 Nov.3rd!
Totally agree. Would way vote for a dead Biden over a live trump.... or a live Biden.

I will support Biden's pick, but that does not mean I don't have a preference and see some as less inspiring &amp; even potential lightening rods. I like Bass and Rice but see glaring issues if they are nominated. Harris is not perfect, but to me makes the most sense, IMHO.
Harris makes the most sense. I like all the other candidates &amp; Warren was my first choice for the nomination, but Harris has the name recognition, the experience &amp; knows the Biden family. Her ambition is a plus not a negative. You want a veep who someday wants to be president.

Bernie was rad, but those of us voting to get Trump out of office are voting Biden. The idea that "most of us [Bernie supporters]" are voting for third-party candidates is just not realistic. Otherwise, we would expect to see 20-25% of the vote go third-party in November.
In case you are wondering, I'm on the Warren/Biden call. They aren't saying it.
I'm sure it technically could be done, but it would be suicide for Biden to go anywhere near it. The Dem base wants to see trump tried for crimes against humanity.
Biden won't pardon him. trump might abdicate the throne to Pence at the last minute, though, so he can do it. And I'd bet Pence would.
This is taking on the proportions of predicting the NFL/NBA draft. Who’s the first, second, third pick and why? Biden needs to pick a VP, so they can begin to campaign, get their vision out there and defeat Trump and the party before country Republicans.
It won’t be even close. It’ll be a blowout Biden win.There are two candidates: trump or Biden. If your vote for Biden  is dependent upon his pick for VP you have shown yourself.  This is a privileged mindset.
In handcuffs maybe?? Then Biden can say "This AMERICAN CARNAGE STOPS RIGHT NOW" as part of his speech?
The problem with Biden is, he can't call out Trump on this issue because he's leaning into picking Susan Rice for his VP!
Really didn’t find anything wrong what Biden said when you compare what Trump has said about every race. Gosh making to much of it
anyone who is comparing biden to fdr is either brain dead or....................that's it.  brain dead.
no fan of biden, but you're a racist too!
After what happened with Joe Biden, it's amazing that people still can't see they live in a scripted reality! That's how they've been rigging elections for generations! Especially, since they're both on the same side.
i've predicted that if biden gets elected, he'll resign right after inauguration &amp; the vp will take over as is the plan.  the vp will be hillary.  i think that's why he's waiting so long to announce.  they know she's not well liked.
Conservatives, especially those who voted for Trump, cannot call out Biden for being a racist. Only lefties can do that because we have principles and don't call out racism only when the other side is doing it
Trump is WAAAAAAY more incompetent and unfit! There is not a SINGLE criticism you can levy against Biden that Trump doesn't rate far far worse on lol  #Biden2020
He said if Biden was elected, he would “hurt the Bible, hurt God.” 🙄 And then went on to assume the 2nd Amendment is religious doctrine. He’s beyond parody.

Biden don’t fall into Trump’s schemes he wants more debates. It doesn’t matter how many debates Trump has he will say he won them all like he did with Hillary. Just don’t let Trump follow you around the stage like he did with Hillary also. Trump up to no good.

That doesn't make Biden any smarter: I'm sorry for your loss.

Oh so you expect Biden to win? This ALL intensifies when  win, “election interference” , blm protest, C19, all ten fold. Thats what we need to prepair for
They’ll do anything to avoid them for Biden’s sake. They don’t want him to get up there and fuck up because they can’t control him like they can now.
Joe Biden.....who can’t ever leave his house, lies, and can’t complete a sentence.
As soon as I hear him say something about M4A which was voted down when they voted just the other day approved by 88% democrats and they said no. Tell me something else. Biden said he didn’t need my vote in a tweet. Come on back.

so many people don’t it’s not even funny. but all it will prove is how stupid and mentally off biden is. it won’t help him at all.

only bernie as vp would tempt me to vote for biden.  cause i don't see biden lasting long so his veep would take over as prez.

DNC picks who we vote for, they pick our VP, and with 85% of Democrats want M4A they voted no on that. So Democrats, they are not for the people, they are for themselves and money.

This is my only hesitation with governor Whitmer as Biden's running mate. Michigan has been through so much and she seems to be a great governor. However, my impression is that you also have a solid Lt. governor who would follow in her footsteps.
Yes, saying Trump and Clinton are both bad in 2016 is why we are here. If we can’t see that Trump is so many times worse than either Clinton or Biden, then this country deserves the worst that will happen under another 4 years.
Nothing New - CNN covers for Biden constantly.  CNN has absolutely no credibility left.
So?!  Have you noticed there are no rallies &amp; this isn’t a normal election year? Good for Trump for getting his message out anyway possible.  Hey, CNN forgot to report on Biden’s latest insult to African Americans today!
I love how the Trump boys always try to highlight Biden’s cognitive deficiencies. But Dad? Oh, he’s fine... 🤪
Or I care for reality as I perceive it affecting myself and others, and so care about stating whether or not I think it's relevant to me, personally, whether Biden cares about the bible -- because I recognize that I'm a member of a larger population.
I don’t care if he picks a bar of soap for VP.  I’m voting for Biden.
In a sane world, Trump's abuse of national emergencies, temporary appointments, etc would lead the next congress and presidency to dramatically pull back on the power of the presidency. I'm just really skeptical that Biden and the Dems will lift a finger to do so if they win.
Can’t believe you’d vote for Biden. Emotions aside, do the right thing.
As we all know, Joe didn’t write this.  I doubt he even realizes that he said what he said. Let’s end this charade, horrible sham, being perpetrated on the American people.  Everyone can see Biden disintegrates daily. No matter how much u hate Trump, he will win.

What. The. Fuck. Do I HAVE to care what the bible says?  Me, I'd rather care about what's going on hereabouts.  And so. Why should I care if Biden is "for" or "against" it?
"Hurt God" -- That whether Biden would do this or not is scary as hell.  "God" seems like it should be the least of our concerns while people die needlessly from starvation, homelessness, or lack of medical care -- like from pharmaceutical control of medications. Ugh.

I think Biden has hit bottom then he comes up with this interview. No wonder they’ve isolated him. This reminded me of his previous angry outbursts &amp; insults to his supporters while campaigning.
The DNC should be ashamed for what they’re doing to Biden - his wife also.  He’s become a Joke to the entire country &amp; that’s very sad.
So how do we all feel about a Biden vs Pence election.
You know if this was the first time we’ve heard that man in the White House lie and take credit for everything, we might believe him. It is old, tiring, laughable, pathetic, and disgusting at this point. Vote Biden.
Joe often adopts a side to get the first comfortable and talking .... I can’t believe people complain about Biden, when trump can’t string 3 sentences together .... double standard in my opinion
Of course, for this to occur Trump would have to overtake Biden in (at least) four places he's currently losing: PA, FL, ME-02, and NE-02. But it's true that this map is plausible.
Michelle realizes Joe Biden looks more inept by the day &amp; won’t be elected &amp; Her husband was the most corrupt president  ever.  But it’s so much easier to blame Trump bc she knows he will win in Nov &amp; lead us for 4 more more yrs.
We will. Vote Biden.
I can understand why Biden may feel a bit prickly about the cognitive decline issue - and listening to his answers, it's clear he knows what he's thinking and can address questions, but he needs to polish his response to this question. It will come up again.
Agree. trump will lie and brag and talk about Hunter, and Biden will be statesmanlike and unable to push back as needed.
Sometime near the end of the year. . . . . Have to get past the riots from the left when Biden(D) looses, then the pandemic will suddenly disappear. . .
Here's your chance to do something decent. Drop out of the race. You &amp; Biden donate remaining campaign funds to help combat the virus / give aid to those suffering. Your only hope of not being seen as the biggest stooge in US history is to go out on a high note.

I don’t think him running helps that man in the White House. He wants to take women’s choices away, doesn’t have any plans, and is counting on people to vote for him because they like his music. The gullible “followers” are with the man in the White House not the Biden voters.

Sorry, that won't fly. You didn't just predict the right will be peaceful if Biden wins, you said that for over 200 years violence has been a tool of the left, but shunned by the right. That is already false.
Sorry - too many red flags when Joe Biden needs to get this one right. I know she does good work for her district but Rep. Bass is looking like a potential lightening rod. Plus, Florida is a swing state. It goes red if he selects her.
At least Biden doesn’t promote a quack doctor who believes in demon sex.   Well, you just keep worrying about the anti Christ and ignore the current one in the WH.  The rest of us are going to purge him come November.
If you elect Joe Biden your third wife, who you cheated on, will leave you.
You are running in hopes that it hurts Biden, that’s why you are running?  Why don’t you just campaign for that man in the White House?  Other than taking away women’s right to choose, which won’t hurt Biden, what do you stand for, I mean besides money and fame?
Rep. Karen Bass: I'm Not A Commie Lover, Just a Slow Learner
As Fareed said just today “ Trump has turn the American Presidency into a reality television show but the Covid19 pandemic has painfully demonstrated that you cannot solved an ACTUAL crisis with ratings &amp; tweets!! “ Stop the Trump Virus and vote Biden!!
That's a really good question.  He would need to practice a lot to go up against a master BS’er, deflector and liar like Trump.  Right now he seems to be winning just letting Trump campaign for him.  Biden's not a strong debater, doesn't think on his feet, and is prone to gaffes.
Agree the Biden/China deal looks bad.  And I agree the Hunter/Burisma deal stinks.  No argument there!  Hunter isn't the president so he's of less interest.  Trump's children have likely made more from China deals than Hunter.
BIDEN do the extraordinary thing &amp; DENY Trump a debate. You ARE in control. He will lose it. It’s the only thing Trump wants...don’t give it to him. DENY TRUMP!!
Let’s suppress Trump. Please Biden deny HIM by denying the debate. THAT will get into his head so fast!! Just say “no” to any debate. Just deny Trump.
Deny Trump the debate....Biden take control and just deny HIM. HE just wants the opportunity to spew more lies.
DENY TRUMP... just ignore the nuisance. Don’t Agee to debate him Biden...yea he will attack your cognitive abilities but he does anyway. Take HIS POWER away from him. You DICTATE TO HIM!!

DENY TRUMP, please Biden take charge &amp; deny him the opportunity to spew lies. Don’t debate!! Trump is trying to cast doubt about the election, you cast doubt on his worthiness...just not worth it. DENY TRUMP ....ignore him &amp; his grievances!!
Deny Trump exists...Biden don’t debate. Don’t stoop to Trump’s  level, you are better than this. DENY TRUMP &amp; you will deny him the win in November!!
How about we just IGNORE Trump and take control starting with Biden NOT debating this liar. Not ACKNOWLEDING a President that wants to delay the election...delay Trump his wish for a debate!!! He is just not worth it!! DENY Trump exists.
Especially as the USPS union supports Biden!!!
Someone’s gonna be crying again in November. It’s mind boggling to me that you guys didn’t learn the first time. Ugh ok Biden is winning just like Hillary was! And your a guy that’s a feminist GTFOH.
If Biden refuses to debate Trump for whatever inane reasons they come up with, trust me that will finish off Biden as it proves he can’t lead&amp; there’s no VP hopeful in sight that is capable of being president.  You dems have dug yourself a hole.
Kammy will be The Enforcer, hunting down Trump supporters for punishment, Beto the Gun Confiscator, while Bernie, Squad &amp; Poncahantas do the socialist agenda that will destroy us.  Biden will be the Placeholder-in-Chief.
Don,  they may arrest Joe Biden in October. Be prepared.
Barr could indict and arrest Joe Biden before the election.  Why won’t you people prepare for that?  Are you that naive?
You people are underestimating this.  It’s entirely possible that Barr will arrest Joe Biden before the election.  Why won’t you think like Republicans?
Uh, you already did that, Donny. Democrats are pretty used to coming in and cleaning up after republicans. Biden will come in and fix the sh!t storm you're left behind.
My understanding of that is that Biden was one of many dealing with Ukraine corruption and it’s been distorted into some payola thing. I do think Hunter was paid a lot for whatever services he provided Burisma.
You destroyed America's economy and killed $150,000 of us.  You want us to believe that Joe Biden will do worse than that?   #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Biden Eyes Major Foreign Policy Shifts If he Wins |   via
I will support Biden's pick, but that does not mean I don't have a preference and see some as less inspiring &amp; even potential lightening rods. I like Bass and Rice but see glaring issues if they are nominated. Harris is not perfect, but to me makes the most sense, IMHO.
Harris makes the most sense. I like all the other candidates &amp; Warren was my first choice for the nomination, but Harris has the name recognition, the experience &amp; knows the Biden family. Her ambition is a plus not a negative. You want a veep who someday wants to be president.
From your lips to God's (and Biden's) ears
Distracting from the latest blunder distractions
No. It could mean President Pelosi.     Postpone the Election? That Could Mean President Biden
On day one Biden needs to tear this down. BUT why is Congress allocating funds for this??
When 45 says there will be violence in every town if Biden wins, he’s not talking about protesters. He’s talking about the violence he will ask for.
This is not an accurate account of the article. It's not saying she'll be disloyal, just distracted by the fact that her own campaign will begin about 2 years into the new Biden administration.
This is taking on the proportions of predicting the NFL/NBA draft. Who’s the first, second, third pick and why? Biden needs to pick a VP, so they can begin to campaign, get their vision out there and defeat Trump and the party before country Republicans.
It won’t be even close. It’ll be a blowout Biden win.
Seriously, A Karen Bass selection would signal that the Biden campaign is waving the white flag on Florida.
Keep in mind that people like him are calling BIDEN "far left", so their definition of "liberal" is gonna be way different than mine
This selection would have similar impact to Biden's campaign that Tim Kaine did for Clinton. 🥱
I'm registered &amp; will vote. I just hope that the administration hasn't crippled the postal service into oblivion by 11/3. I  hope not to get harassed by right wing goon squads at precincts.  I hope Biden is doing all he can to reach out to all who he needs to reach.
Trump IS worse.  You guys are worse with Benghazi, Hillary's emails and Hunter Biden.  Also, 'libtard' shows you to be a #Cult45 member.  If you want to be taken seriously, drop the Qanon rhetoric.
Biden has 50 yrs &amp; got rich
Who?  Biden doesn’t know where he is or what year we’re in.  Your sleazy reputation precedes you.
His sheer loonacy is scary. I could go all day one on one with him

Echoes of Biden’s 1987 plagiarism scandal continue to reverberate - The Washington Post
I realize more everyday that the polls are being manipulated.  no one in their right mind would vote for Biden, including the Trump hating dems.  Biden, Bernie, AOC, Warren would ruin this country even before their VP takes over.
Really, huh?  Trump has murdered everyone who has died in the US the last 3.5 yrs.  Talk about bloody tiny hands. ❤️.  MAGA bc Biden has nothing in his brain!
I've no doubt there are racially insensitive videos of Biden.  He's been in government since the 70's.  Do you have any racially insensitive videos of Biden in the last 20 years; since the millennium?  We've all learned, grown and changed in the intervening decades.
Yeah really. No offense to Joe Biden, but PRESIDENT Obama would be leading by 15+ % points right now. The election would be over for sure.

Total BS reasoning.  Harris is ambitious, as are almost all politicians that have reached that level of success.  Biden likely a 1-term president.  She'd be a great pick.
Kamala Harris is a badass and we wld be lucky to have her as VP. This year more than any other it's important to have someone who cld step into the role of president at a moment's notice and she is eminently capable. These "allies" shld be ashamed and I hope Biden ignores them.
#NobodyLikesTrump Just a joke of a frail, sniveling loser. Vote Biden 2020 &amp; let’s make this country BETTER!!
In Biden’s basement.
The girl is literally guiding Biden, hanging on to him! Can you imagine if that was Trump?!?!
Don't care if it's Biden +99, as long as people are voting in person during a pandemic the polls mean nothing.  If Dems are over confident it will be 2016 all over again.
Thanks for voting. My guess is Harris for veep or attorney general; Warren for senate majority leader; Rice, SOS. Some of the others will be judicial nominees or cabinet ministers. Eg mayor Pete cut a deal to endorse Biden at exactly right time. But for what - cabinet post(?).The Russians are plotting to force Joe Biden to speak in public and actually campaign for president.  It's an attack on democracy.

Russia fears Biden like they feared Hillary. They know these true patriotic Americans really do put America first.
Biden reminds us every day in ways both large and small what having a real President is like
I don’t know how else to put it, but listening to Joe Biden speak tells me that not only does he have early onset dementia, but he’s just flat out stupid. How did he get this far?
Donald Trump has accomplished more in 4 years of government than Joe Biden has in 4 decades of government.
Did your daddy really say Biden will hurt God and the Bible?  Now that is the most ignorant thing I’ve ever heard.  Besides the things you post of course!
Your husband is intentionally interfering in an election with no intent to win, just spoil and THIS is the tweet you come up with? SRSLY?!!!!
Biden is afraid of adding a fourth debate?
So if China helps Biden win, shouldn’t that be called even since dad needed Russia’s help to win last time?
Your agenda to spread lies about Biden’s mental status is sad and pathetic. It’s a good distraction from the 160k dead and counting. But go on and spread your BS.
Right right only Biden has gaffes..idiot
Oh dude...Biden wrote that...not Trump...you would be right if Trump wrote it or tried to say it....
seriously, do you really think black voters who are going to vote for Biden are going to change their vote to Kanye, who is a tRump supporter? if anything  just lost a bunch of votes as they would rather vote for Kanye than tRump #trumpgate
You seem to be ignoring that Biden got more votes than the other Dem primary candidates.
This is actually a pretty genius and abusive tactic. Trump can put the onus on Biden to agree to an in-person debate even tho he doesn't want to debate (has prev indicated he may or may not show up) and when Biden inevitably says no and wants a cyber debate, he can blame Biden.
That’s what I thought.  Enjoy the Biden Administration.
You’re right.  Trump’s incompetence and unfitness to lead far outpace Biden’s.   Finally someone who understands. 😆😆

No, answer the question.  I’ll rephrase: what % of the black population own their own business?  You think Biden was a racist, so your attack falls laughably flat.
Ok, so if the president can’t stop abortions why did you bring that up in the first place. Why does it matter if Biden pro choice?  Your not making sense!!!!
Thank you for reporting on this. As a “Latina” Joe Biden does not speak for me or other Latinos. He speaks  of blacks &amp; Latinos as if we’re a number and how he can pander to us to get our vote and then forget about us. More of the same
Joe Biden winning is the answer you seek.
‘their businesses’??  How many black people own their own businesses?  Kanye???  Biden a racist???  What color is the sky in your world?
To bad Biden can't remember any of the facts.
I'll give you that one. Although if you were to ask a thousand folks on the street, that same question doubt 25% could answer it. Now explain all the times Biden can't finish a sentence or goes off into the twilight zone with his answer. Actually feel sorry for the man.
I'm voting for Biden even if bursts out doing an imitation of Speedy Gonzales.
This election is not who’s best. TBH Biden wasn’t my first choice or second but I’ll be crazy if I think Trump is better then Biden.
Let's have the debates, I 100% agree we should have them. After the first one is one is over I want you to tweet you honestly still believe what you say here in your tweet. I doubt you will though, you'll be to embarrassed when you see that "Hidden Biden" is losing his mind. SAD

We're waaaaaay past ultimatums, though. I personally can't stand Biden, but I love my country and know that means I vote for him. Period.
Biden is actually a racist and you libs want him in office 😂
With a democratic Senate, Biden will get things done.
This is why I think Biden needs to pick someone with some econ. credibility. Like Warren. Not just check a box. I am not sure Harris or Rice does that.  One shores up judiciary  &amp; the other foreign affairs which is needed, but economy/virus, including healthcare, will be #1 issue

Why are you running? While I see from your platform that you are a socialist and environmentalist, you know as well as I do that your race will only impact the votes for Biden, and possibly allow Trump to win. I find that unacceptable.

He just backtracks after a stink is raised. He is a segregationist at heart and has been since he got into politics.

He can't even complete a thought in an interview. Maybe his earpiece is slow as he gets fed his answers. Joe Biden is a segregationist and fought for their cause in schools crafting language still used today to oppose school integration.
Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists. he fought for their cause in schools and helped give America the language that is still used to oppose school integration today.
Going camping off the grid Monday and Tuesday.  Market will still be here Wednesday I hope unless the aliens 👽 come or Biden names Kamala 🤡 🥜
NEWS: Disclosure docs show that one of Biden’s top candidates for VP made big investments in the fossil fuel industry. The revelations come as Biden has faced renewed questions about his climate policies.
But Biden did make African Americans seem like a monolith. Biden's racism is so ingrained, he just can't help himself because that is what he truly believes.
who’s more senile, Biden or Pelosi? She just claimed there are 3.3 million new cases and 70 million deaths from COVID in the last 11 weeks. More deaths than new cases?According 2 CDC there are 4.8 million cases and 160k deaths, total. #PelosiMustGo #shescrazy
Everyday Biden says something racist. Unbelievable. I can go on and on about all his statements. Wake up America. He is handing the election to Trump on a silver platter.
We ditchin Biden y’all
He won't apologize because he doesn't believe he damages people with his words and believes what he says. He has a long record of discrimination going back to trying to stop the busing during the desegregation orders.
Other than Biden she was my least favorite of the primary candidates.
does rocky think we don't realize how big of a dumbass biden is? we see it bud
Its the only reason Biden "Won"
With Biden’s VP choice expected soon, here’s whom he could pick  via  It will reek of Obama-ism and political correctness and will smell worse than a sewer.  Black-Brown-Black, women, liar, hater, puppet, who will it be?
I hope Joe Biden doesn’t campaign at all. I don’t want him getting Covid
Yeah fuck Joe Biden but there is no way a Democratic Presidential candidate isn't going to have a union bug on the actual physical button
When you KNOW Biden didn’t write it.
Your're the one accusing Dems of hiding Biden when we are in the middle of a pandemic.
LOL. This guy thinks the US provides healthcare to just anyone.  I assume you're voting for Biden as illegal immigration has only increased under Trump.
cue white people cries  “but Biden isn’t inspiring enough... he’ll delay the revolution... i wanted Bernie... both parties are the same... I just wrote an op-ed called The Liberal Case for Trump 2020...”
We all knew it
Live in CO so my ballot comes in the mail  But yes, I would stand in line to cast a vote for Biden
Because who ever wanted a picture taken with Joe Biden?
Exactly. Harris is my second least favorite of all the primary candidates (next to Biden) and so I just assume she will be the VP nomination.
Let’s see...  40: NC, TN, AR, OK, TX, NM, AZ, CA 70: MD, PA, WV, OH, IN, IL, MO, KS, CO, UT 90: MA, NY, PA, OH, IN, IL, WI, MN, SD, WY, MT, ID, WA  70 &amp; 90 are in 4 states and the only one with a woman D Senator among those states is Duckworth  That’s who Biden is picking
To be clear, anyone who votes for Kanya was never gonna vote for Biden anyhow.  I tend to think that skin color does not dictate intelligence, and no intelligent voters vote for any dude whose wife wants to COMMIT HIM TO THE FUNNY FARM!!
Don’t let trump even get 125.   Biden Power
How long til trump calls joe Biden “joe hidin’”
I 💜   His intelligent, irreverent, wry wit is a balm to my weary soul at the end of the day.
So Trump says he kissed women without their express permission.  But did he?  Where and when?  Biden kisses and gropes CHILDREN without their permission (hundreds of pictures to confirm this obvious fact), and that's okay?  Serious question:  Are you a pedophile?
Biden apologized for yesterdays racist remarks again. How many racist things does he have to say to make people realize he is the racist person on earth. He will not help the black community and has not in 40 years. Trump has done more than any President to help all people.
Jobs Joe Biden is currently qualified for: Sweet Tea Magnate Breakfast Sausage spokesman Walmart greeter Dairy farmer (handsy)  Commissioner of major league baseball Mayor of North Pole amusement park Front Desk/doorman for NY high rise apartment building
Your campaign is sliding into the swamp. Your attack on Joe Biden's faith is not only wrong, but stupid. The one without faith is YOU.  You embody EVERY SINGLE ONE of the 7 Deadly Sins - look them up. You will recognize yourself.

Biden really keeps working so hard to lose my vote, the commitment is frankly impressive.
Wouldn't the "Nazi" be Biden? I mean he's the one that gave a eulogy at an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK funeral.
Conjecture: Dems get Kamala Harris or other "in-pocket" Democrat as running mate, pull bait-and-switch with Biden for health reasons post convention. No Yang, no Sanders. Dems are a hard no on both, which should terrify reasonable young liberals who are "solution focused."
Joe Biden is NOT the agent of change this country desperately needs. He’s there to serve as a vessel for financial and structural stability for the 1%

After thinking about Joe Biden and watching him now for over a year as a candidate, (as an independent voter), I just can't believe that he is the Democratic candidate for President. Seriously, is there someone waiting in the wings to swoop in or a 25th amendment strategy?
Today I learned that if you don't like Joe Biden you're a Trump supporter.
It is Aug 7th and Biden is the most racist person on earth.
Good grief
This is why my original ? was to the Good Dr and NOT his BEEHIVE.  I don't call anyone coons for thinking this way.  I AGREE with A LOT of IT.  I know about the party switch in early 1900s i.e. Southern strategy.  I am aware of policing records of Biden/Harris.  ? was RIGHT NOW.
1. It's faking a stock market comeback right before an election 2. It sets up for the market to totally crash right after Biden wins, falsely putting the blame on Dems 3. It allows Feds to sell corp bonds to foreign powers allowing them to own large amounts of U.S. businesses
Oh, yeah. By noon I'll be a communist, a racist, pro Biden, pro Trump, a patriot, a traitor, fkng incredible.
I did it for Garth Brooks tickets, I can do it for Joe Biden.
RIGHT???  Like goddammit at this point we were promised Joe Biden the One-Winged Angel and I was so ready to vote for the hottest president ever and this is what we get?

He wasn't trailing Biden for the last 3 years
I love how every time Tr*mp makes shit up about Biden, it makes Biden sound cooler.   Like only in my wildest dreams could I actually vote for someone who would throw all guns into a volcano, turn us into a socialist paradise, and destroy god.
Trump re-election strategies (2020): •They’re all socialists! 👎  •Bidens are corrupt 👎 •Economy is unbeatable 👎 •COVID is Dem hoax 👎 •Uh, we’ll fix economy 👎 •Uh, we beat COVID 👎 •Law &amp; Order 👎 •Antifa’s coming 👎 •Biden is weak 👎 •Biden will take away God 🙄
Sadly, I must agree with JVL.  All of machinery and chicanery of Trumpism will still be in place once Biden is elected, unfettered by the need to even appear to be governing.   Trump unleashed, unbound, unrepentant.
He apologized immediately and it wasn't his point. Biden will say some stupid things from time to time but he's not a racist corrupt compulsive liar and he'll apologize when he says something stupid. You won't get that from the other side.
"West, who has previously voiced support for Mr Trump and is running as an independent, was named on the Colorado ballot on Thursday, the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office confirmed. At least one Republican official assisted West with his filing"
"When it was pointed out to West that it was unlikely he could win November’s poll, and that his campaign was being run as a distraction, he replied: “I’m not going to argue with you. Jesus is King.'"
Last night I kept dreaming about which bumper sticker would be catchier: Biden + Bass or Biden + Harris. Then I hit on Joe and Sue.  I could never make the choice.
I think that Biden's biggest problem is that he has so many great candidates to choose from. Trump, on the other hand, only has one requirement: "Are you loyal to me?"
When I first heard Trump's comments, I thought Biden said something really terrible. What Biden really said, when you come down to it, is that the Black community is more organized than the Latino community. After all, Blacks have been fighting these battles for generations.
The harder the Dems surge left, the more I hear voting Trump. Seems like more to block Biden/socialism than pro-Trump. I live in a major swing state.....
isn't it really funny that Trump supporters are calling out Biden's  microaggressions? a concept they typically drill the left for creating, all while supporting a man known for his macroaggressions... #fucktrump

I can't wait for the debates. I hope biden doesn't chicken out. I really want to hear both sides.
third party candidates and write-ins. A case might be made for Biden, though I'd probably disagree with it, given his abortion politics.   My editors have a more nuanced discussion about it in this podcast:   I've found Twitter, due to brevity, lacks nuance
Have you shown your father half as much interest in his medical care that you have shown Biden? I know you are kind of the ignored one because you don't have his name &amp; you don't have a vagina, but that reality that you don't SEE your father's brain is rotten fruit is glaring.
So yesterday, a group of women leaders and organizations wrote a letter and sent it out to top news executives.  The purpose: A warning to avoid "stereotypes and tropes" in coverage around Joe Biden's VP pick.  Outlining specific traps the media fall into.  Offering assistance.
"Trump says the only way he can lose is through election fraud. In fact, it seems more likely that the only way he can win is through fraud."
Joe Biden is a devout catholic and regularly attends Sunday service.   The last time Trump went to church, he gassed peaceful Americans.
"Biden has offered voters a steady rollout of plans to solve big problems &amp; with a heavy dose of decency &amp; respect.  His climate agenda is truly bold. He says he wants to be a “transformational” president, not just transitional. He will follow science"   a/l/a "everybody VOTES."
Joe Biden is a devout catholic and regularly attends Sunday service.   The last time Trump went to church, he gassed peaceful Americans.
If Biden doesn't make a GRAND GESTURE to the left soon, he's going to lose to Trump.  BIG Like picking a Bernie Bro for VP, or supporting M4A  Otherwise, too many voters like me will stay home.

I think you lump all Hispanics into one pot.  You lack Comprehension of the widely DIFFERING POLITICS of different Latinx Ppl.  Diversity b/t Cubans and Arizona or California Mexicans or Salvadoreans or S America.  Biden knows what he is talking about—YOU DON’T IGNORANT FOOL.
The idea that Kanye should suspend his mental illness long enough for Biden to get elected is ridiculous. The run is the disease.

For those in despair, read this article:
Attempt?   “And by the way, what you all know, but most people don’t, unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”   —Joe Biden
Nope, I know some folks of the conservative persuasion who would never vote for a "crazy commie" like Biden, who also won’t vote for Trump. Their vote for a 3rd party candidate is still a vote against Trump.
Ok Christians....explain to me how Biden is going to "hurt" God...but apparently has no beef with Jesus...?
Kanye late to the party lol but people mad at him for interference because Biden cant hold his own is funny
Ok... that’s a personal problem. I’m not for Biden, I’m voting to remove an existential threat from the White House. Biden at least has a very decent public platform that I can mostly get behind, and I trust him to put intelligent progressive people in positions of power.
. : Be Very Careful About Biden's Lead on Trump -- he joins  to discuss  the second coronavirus stimulus package and the upcoming Presidential election.
Trump's accusation that Biden is against God and wants to hurt God keeps making me think of the lyrics from Woody Guthrie's very subtle Mean Talking Blues:   "I hated union everywhere, 'cause God likes unions and I hate God!"
Yesterday's state polls by Quinnipiac and Data for Progress are all broadly consistent with Biden leading nationally by ~7-10 points... except the Quinnipiac poll of Kentucky, which has Trump only +9. You'd expect him to be up by 22% there if he's down 10% nationally. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
No one would do what you've done!  Competent presidents would have nipped this in the bud in December of last year.  They wouldn't ignore everything around them for months.  I've been working from home in March and I don't see any end it sight -- until President Biden!

Right right only Biden has gaffes..idiot
Oh dude...Biden wrote that...not Trump...you would be right if Trump wrote it or tried to say it....
seriously, do you really think black voters who are going to vote for Biden are going to change their vote to Kanye, who is a tRump supporter? if anything  just lost a bunch of votes as they would rather vote for Kanye than tRump #trumpgate
You seem to be ignoring that Biden got more votes than the other Dem primary candidates.
This is actually a pretty genius and abusive tactic. Trump can put the onus on Biden to agree to an in-person debate even tho he doesn't want to debate (has prev indicated he may or may not show up) and when Biden inevitably says no and wants a cyber debate, he can blame Biden.
That’s what I thought.  Enjoy the Biden Administration.
You’re right.  Trump’s incompetence and unfitness to lead far outpace Biden’s.   Finally someone who understands. 😆😆
I've sent you a bunch of bots this morning -- all coming from the same anti-Biden tweet. All the profile photos are nearly the same. Can you please shut that farm down? Thanks
When YOUR African-American turns on you: Trump allies privately concerned Kanye West’s campaign will hurt the president more than Biden
'Biden's cognitive issues can no longer be ignored'  via
Seriously are Democrats brainwashed it's amazing how they say one thing and do another just like Nancy pelosi blaming Trump for not doing things fast enough on coronavirus but yet it was her dancing around in Chinatown saying to not block people and Joe Biden saying xenophobe wth
A girl can hope because it seems like Biden is running an inept campaign right now.
No, answer the question.  I’ll rephrase: what % of the black population own their own business?  You think Biden was a racist, so your attack falls laughably flat.
Ok, so if the president can’t stop abortions why did you bring that up in the first place. Why does it matter if Biden pro choice?  Your not making sense!!!!
Thank you for reporting on this. As a “Latina” Joe Biden does not speak for me or other Latinos. He speaks  of blacks &amp; Latinos as if we’re a number and how he can pander to us to get our vote and then forget about us. More of the same
Joe Biden winning is the answer you seek.
‘their businesses’??  How many black people own their own businesses?  Kanye???  Biden a racist???  What color is the sky in your world?
To bad Biden can't remember any of the facts.
I'll give you that one. Although if you were to ask a thousand folks on the street, that same question doubt 25% could answer it. Now explain all the times Biden can't finish a sentence or goes off into the twilight zone with his answer. Actually feel sorry for the man.
I'm voting for Biden even if bursts out doing an imitation of Speedy Gonzales.
Let's have the debates, I 100% agree we should have them. After the first one is one is over I want you to tweet you honestly still believe what you say here in your tweet. I doubt you will though, you'll be to embarrassed when you see that "Hidden Biden" is losing his mind. SAD
Idiot MAGAt neighbor just put up a huge tRump flag. It's on! Gonna get a Biden lawn sign. I won't unfollow them on FB or stop buying GS cookies from their daughter. I WILL repost every Biden/anti 45 thing I can find! #BlueTsunami2020
If Biden is against God, wonder what God has to say about three-times-married adulterers?
Biden doesn’t deserve any intelligent, FREEDOM LOVING, COUNTRY LOVING persons vote.
that will elect trump.  NOPE.  Voting to get rid of trump.  Voting Biden.
Lying Don got that half right. Vote for Biden.
God can take care of himself by directing a meteorite to the back of Biden’s noggin’.
You lost me at “Biden cares”
Please, have Trump order FBI to arrest Biden and all democratic congressmen/women.
DJT clearly  suffers from the proverbial soft bigotry of low expectations, yet, somehow, Biden is held to a higher standard.
We're waaaaaay past ultimatums, though. I personally can't stand Biden, but I love my country and know that means I vote for him. Period.
Biden is actually a racist and you libs want him in office 😂
With a democratic Senate, Biden will get things done.
This is why I think Biden needs to pick someone with some econ. credibility. Like Warren. Not just check a box. I am not sure Harris or Rice does that.  One shores up judiciary  &amp; the other foreign affairs which is needed, but economy/virus, including healthcare, will be #1 issue

Wonder how likely that would be? Not that I want to find out, but yikes, I can’t even fathom picking Kanye… I mean I’m not a Biden fan, but… wow. Fingers crossed this is non starter in most places.
Yep. My enthusiasm, while never strong, has dropped with a thud. Biden is blowing this opportunity.
there's gotta be a non-zero chance that Biden picks Jill Ellis as his running mate

Which is it, exactly?  Because we're told if we don't vote Trump we're voting for Biden, and if we don't vote Biden we're giving a vote to Trump  How about, just maybe, the person we vote for is the one that gets our vote.

He just backtracks after a stink is raised. He is a segregationist at heart and has been since he got into politics.Sure, Joe Biden *appears* to be a senile fool but don't forget that he's very sneaky.  It could be a distraction.
Seems Biden is almighty.
Yeah, or Biden could just walk out and open and close an unbrella.

55% likely voters think it “much more” / “somewhat more likely” #Biden in early stages of dementia. 60% voters age 18-29 think it likely Biden has early-onset dementia, along with 61% of Hispanics. 43% of blacks doubt Biden mental capacity ~
Actually, a retired physician in Vail told me he 'would vote for Kanye before he's ever vote for Biden'. That's a lost cause.  Ignorance, no matter how educated and worldly - is a choice.  Told me I have a hard case of 'trump derangement syndrome'. Turns out I do.
Turns out Biden is a racist too huh? So can we vote for someone either than two racist rapists now? Or are we still supposed to choose one of them?
Swear to god, there could be a video released of Joe Biden getting head from a child and y’all will STILL be like “well, he’s not Trump, so he gets my vote🤷‍♂️”
Yeah Biden’s gaffe yesterday was much worse than you retweeting a video of a person saying “white power” from his golf cart...you are out of completely out of touch.
Last year #Biden promised to spend $1.7 tril­lion over 10 years on the en­vi­ron­ment &amp; infrastructure. Recently he in­creased that to $2 tril­lion over four years ~

Biden n Rice, the two biggest liars on the planet
another day of shit re: biden
so, like... does biden even *want* me to vote for him? at best, a day goes by in which he does nothing to convince me to. at worst, he does shit to convince me i shouldn’t.
Why should Biden debate a jerk?
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, lauds community's 'diversity of thought'    It took him a full day to do a 180!!!
Leave it to CNN to spin this narrative.  I can't wait for the debates.  I could see them wanting to fight each other on stage.  Let's get ready to rumble!  Trump in round 2!  CNN's John King appears to defend Biden over former VP's 'diversity' remarks
I thought he said Biden hurt God?  I assume most Christians KNOW that anyone who is a believer in the almighty also knows that God is incapable of being hurt. Gotta be a neophyte or total infidel to make that pronouncement.
Joe Biden said black people don’t have a diversity of opinions or “attitudes, with some notable exceptions,” but Latino’s do... reminds me of the racist Smithsonian chart they released about the aspects of “Whiteness and White Culture” a few weeks ago
How about Obama giving a Biden rally at another man's funeral
Apparently Biden said something bad but I can’t find it because of all the asinine things Trump keeps saying about Biden steal up all the search terms. If Biden manages to pull this out, this will be a big reason why.
Beat Biden, we can't let America sleep!
Trump says Biden is going to beat up God. And the Bible.
If Biden can hurt God, there's no telling what he can do to us mere mortals.
Biden says Black people can’t think for themselves
Joe Biden lays down the law!!
So Biden’s running mate is going to be a woman 🤔 hmm
Get Biden out of the basement so he can tell us what he really thinks
Joe Biden tells us what he truly believes. He thinks the black community is all the same!!
Biden snaps at question on cognitive test, likens it to asking reporter if he’s ‘a junkie’   Thou protest too much Joe Biden
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity   You go Joe Biden!!! Way to go!!
If Biden is powerful enough to hurt God, he must then be able to eradicate COVID-19; put the unemployed back to work and get elected in November.
What's next? Biden will ban apple pie! Biden is BFF with Satan! Biden will divorce all straight couples! Biden will ban rock music! Biden will force all dog owners to own cats and all cat owners to own dogs! 🤪
Really jaw dropping is if those closest to him have not encouraged him to have cognitive function test. DNC intentionally guilty of elder abuse. Don’t like Biden’s politics, but this is painful to watch seeing him deteriorateevery day. He’s always said dumb stuff. This is more...
It’s not Pres Trump saying it. Biden is under investigation by Ukraine right now. Biden is named and quoted in fbi documents as participating in the unmasking and fake investigation of Gen Flynn and the Trump campaign. That’s just a couple of the things.
every day on here i see a new video of joe biden being profoundly creepy or racist
You are seriously bringing up Biden's inability to read prepared material? You need to be careful when you say things like this given the endless recordings of Trump stumbling over words, going off the cuff in the most disastrous ways &amp;/or reading everything in a stoned monotone.
It's wildly telling when all a Trump supporter has in his arsenal is Joe Biden whataboutism. If you can't genuinely defend the actual man &amp; his actions &amp; can only turn to casting untrue aspersions on his opponent, what does that reveal about your candidate &amp; your support of him?
That’s the point. He is not the one doing anything authoritarian...Unless you only listen to MSM. If your family is afraid of authoritarian, they damn sure don’t want Biden the communist wanna-be in office.
The only authoritarians are some of our governors. Can you seriously see Biden traveling to another country and sitting down to have a 2 hr long important conversation with other world leaders? Is somebody going to follow and write the words for him.

Seeing this after hearing for months that only Biden can beat Trump:
Being that your busy lying about Covid, trying to destroy Postal Service, &amp; making up lies about President Biden, I wanted to make sure you saw this... oh, right. Have someone read it to you! Its important!
Biden won’t know if he wins or not!
Is there even the remotest chance Michelle Obama will be Joe Biden's VP? Trump would be apoplectic to lose to an Obama.
Did you hear we have a new national park Yo - semite.
Does Biden think all black people are cokeheads?
Actually, "SLEEPY JOE" will accomplish more in one month than you've done in 4 yrs! Why? B/c he's mentally stable, competent &amp; intelligent! He knows more about being President than you will ever know. I know how much smarter you claim to be, but Biden IS!!
Did this hope feeling come after watching that Biden clip?
We’re doomed if Biden doesn’t win
🇺🇸U.S. farmers' support for Donald Trump in the upcoming Presidential Election is unwavering as 73% this week said they will vote for him.  Joe Biden captured slightly more interest this time than he did 3 months ago.  Here are the full results from all 6 quarterly "elections":
I have a feeling Biden will win Florida and Texas as well.
Clearly someone campaigning for President Biden.
Unlike trump, President Biden doesn't need too.
Biden, “don,you got into something that was way above what you could handle. Do I take apart you? Or you and your fucking family?
Thought you were cleansing
I would have said weeks ago Biden wins easy. If he doesn't debate (well or at all) and economy rallies bit more who knows.
The Surge: A final ranking of VP candidates before Biden decides.  Chime in, retweet with YOUR top 3 picks!!! #Biden2020 #WeWantJoe #UnitedNotDivided #GoodTrouble #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
That would be me, but we have each other!  😉
I think there are already plenty of examples where Biden does, in fact, sound incompetent.
When do you do the same interview of Joe Biden with the same level of constant interruptions and constant disputing of items the candidate says?  No problem with you doing this interview, since the President works for us, but your job is half done until you do the same of Biden
I can't wait for the same interview of Joe Biden with the same barrage of constant interruptions.   And the constant contradictory statements.  Until then, I consider this partisan ...
WHen is the similar interview of Joe Biden with the same style of constant interruptions?  You can be proud of your team when you do the same for both candidates...
We will wait and see if you would be saying this after the elections when you lose Florida to Biden!
Translation: If you want a leader who's honest w/ you, cares about you, and works daily for you instead of for himself, vote Biden. If you're good with mental illness, fraud, corruption &amp; impeached as "president" vote Trump. No don't!
They will keep it up nonstop to distract from the damage that Biden is doing to the country - and of course blaming everything that happens on Trump.
What about it Is fake? Biden’s signature is all over a lot of recent history’s biggest American black eyes.
The Biden campaign doesn't need to produce any more commercials. Just that. Played over and over.
And the alternative given the state of our country and the current isn’t changing right now then what do you suggest.  Yes we know Biden not good, but trump i would literally rather have my dogs shit as prez than trump.  So vote Biden and let’s fix our shit after we remove psycho
The only candidates being considered are 4 black women. Skin color and genitalia are the only two qualifiers for Biden’s VP. Wanna walk through life with blinders on? That’s your right.
That’s it, I’m saying it now. I will not vote for Biden if he doesn’t debate Trump. I won’t help elect someone who can’t hold their ground against Trump. If Biden can’t now, how can he face China and Russia as tensions escalate?
I would put up extra signs. Some pride flags. Some Biden posters, save the whales. Everything. It would look the bumper of a Subaru driven by a Unitarian.
At 32 secs...He said, No, we are going to go beat joe Biden fair and square.
All my friends who voted for Trump last time are voting for Biden this time! Vote
Seriously?  That is the best insult you can muster?  You've done it!  Joe Biden is now withdrawing from the race because of your masterful dig against his tweeting abilities.  At least, he can spell, walk up or down a ramp &amp; easily drink one-handed &amp; doesn't throw tweet tantrums
Don't be surprised if he finds a role in the Biden cabinet if we get rid of the orange clownass!
🚨Low-brow analysis alert 🚨  Kamala Harris looks, sounds, and acts like a President. She exudes competence. I truly believe - and I know you care what I believe - that she should be chosen as Biden's running mate for this reason alone. She's believable as a leader. 'Nuff said.
Why would Biden guys come out for you?
If you don’t vote for Biden you ain’t black
I am sure Biden hated PA when he was 10 and forced his parents to move.
Trump will kill everyone.  President Biden will remove the 1% tax cut donald gave out.
They are scared to death of the thought of Biden toe to toe with Trump. Terrified
Biden for prez w exotic as VP
What do Joe Biden’s farts smell like?
Thanks!  Slowly learning, and hate having to unfollow, but, realizing it's time 🙃
If Trump or his super PACs have to buy advertising in Texas, it's a win for Biden.
Want to bet trump's name is also on there, or was removed? 26+ sexual assault allegations against trump, one against Biden. trump wins again!!! He is such a fine adulterer.
I've been told by others and there's a 5K follower rule on how many you can follow, based on some ratio that's not explained.. like a secret recipe.  I'm not in the inside loop!  Lol. 🙃
hold up, illinois only likely biden?
I'm FB as soon as Twitter lets me, I'm in ratio hell until I get to 5k... That takes like Another May 2020, which was 73 weeks?
So sad for your Mom and you, but, Joe Biden has no dementia
Gonna break out Michelle at the convention to replace Biden?
IF BIDEN MAKES YOU THE VP TRUMP WILL DEFINITLEY WIN.
So true
31-second mark, "No, we are going to beat Joe Biden fair and square."
He says, "no, we are going to beat Joe Biden fair and square." It's at the 31-second mark. Literally!!!!
Opposite of what  said. The chaos IS the DNC campaign strategy. It will end after Pres Trump’s re-election. If Biden wins by fraud, the newly emboldened communist wannabes will not stop until democrats are taken out too. You see, anyone can throw out a statement.
Yes make America great again elect Joe Biden
But look at Biden. Only one sexual assault allegation. He's a loser.
As a former, lifelong Republican, I'd still vote for BIDEN.
THAT'S SUCH A COINCIDENCE! Trump no longer has a base either. He used to, while folks decided whether or not he was a trustworthy leader, but they now know what an incompetent sociopath he is! President Biden will actually start get rid of the corruption Trump was!
Oh, someone hired to sow mistrust into the Biden campaign. I didn’t read the trash article but someone mentioned abortion, so here is another point of view.
Most likely scenario, trump wins day machine voting by landslide. Mail in voting is shipped worldwide and we have dead people voting illegals voting, people living in other countries voting. We have China submitting ballots along with other countries. Biden gets the most votes.
You act like you speak for all democrats. I am a democrat and I believe a moderate republican would be beneficial.   You’re arguing with me when the OP’s question was - Who do YOU think Biden should pick for his VP.   Run along now. This discussion has ended. Go fight with a Maga
Blocking you. I don't allow idiots to take up my space.  Enjoy your communist gourmet if biden gets elected.  And you were never a Republican.
I’m voting for Biden.

Why did you tell us that you don't support Biden. Are you wanting to tell everyone I support Trump? Or is it in response to something I missed? Just wondering.
To all that are likely to vote Democrat in November. Please. Please let's agree right now to not bicker about Biden's choice for VP. The decision will have been made with input from many sides. Please. Don't attack and divide. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Yes we need Joe Biden.
Liberals: third party vote is a vote for Trump.  Conservatives: third part vote is a vote for Biden.  Me: Yeah, who’s the sheeple? These people.
The bafoon (Trump) has already been listed in documents so your Playboy comments should go to the crapper. He would bone his own daughter if he could. The way he looks at and touches her is Joe Biden creepy.
Trump will beat Biden by at least 100 electoral votes and most likely more. Biden will lose by a much wider margin than Hillary did.
You've got a much better chance at curing Covid-19 by Nov 3rd than winning another term on Nov 3rd! Don't worry though! President Biden will have it completely under control by the time you figure out that magic demons are not controlling your lungs. Whew!
Dreams are GOOD to have. Some might say GREAT, but so is mental health,&amp; you've got some work to do. You wont win,&amp; you know it! You'll try some slimy cheat, blame Dems but it won't work, &amp; you'll be indicted &amp; convicted. Maybe be nicer to President Biden.(cough,cough pardon?)
This didn’t age very well
Let’s get Biden back in the White House!
Yea, your lack of spelling indicts you probably don’t read. Which probably means you can’t comprehend anything past twitter.   Good luck in life! Biden 2020.
The media never laid a hand on Hunter Biden, didn’t meet their criteria for investigation

A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty - The Boston Globe.   This is a sobering read. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020The Portland Mayor is powerless in the face of Antifa and BLM terrorists, especially after he defunded the police and refused to call in the National Guard to restore law and order. Welcome to Biden’s version of America should he ever win the Presidency. Vote Trump &amp; Republican.
This is near the top of the list of why it’s critical Biden wins.
ROFL! Wow. If Biden can “hurt God,” that implies Biden is MORE POWERFUL THAN GOD. 🤦🏼‍♀️
Rumor has it that Susan Rice is Biden's choice. Remember that people died and she lied. Four Americans died in #Benghazi attack: #AmbassadorChrisStevens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and #CIAoperatives, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods, former Navy SEALs.
Have you seen Biden’s interview with Errol Barnett, who asked Biden if he had taken a cognitive test? If you have, have you commented on it? If Trump has said and performed in such an alarming way, would you be silent?As a journalist, you should ask yourself this question.

So every time don Jr says something dumb we have to comment on Biden’s children? That makes no sense.
They think Biden appeals to average people but he will be run by the radical left as we know if elected.  God knows he’s not capable of running a hot dog stand much less be president.
He’s right though. Biden is not left at all. He and Obama deported more people than any other administration. They didn’t end the drug war. They took us from two wars to seven. They want to prosecute Ed Snowden. These are all ideological conservative policies.
You’re 100% correct. The Biden people are in such denial about his racism. Biden is just more polite about it than Trump.
It's not 'designed' to hurt Biden unless he's guilty of something, so no worries, right?  Oh and it is not advisable to release reports until they are finished.
An all white ticket for this party at this time is unthinkable to me. Surely Biden sees that. I personally don’t know any white women who have this attitude that it has to be a white woman first, but if they are out there they need to get over it. It’s insane.
Amen to that fact  Trump can’t be bought, and the Marxist Democrats hate him for it. Obama, Biden and other Dems all got wealthy feeding at the public trough. They’ve mastered the fine art of screwing the public.

George I loved you as a figure of my childhood but this statement is so far left and not true it makes you look as old and crazy as Biden.

Trump Campaign Asks Biden to Agree to Move Debates After Commission Says No  Giuliani is the one who is outdated. The man is not longer relevant and actually a criminal waiting to be tried for high crimes and misdemeanors.
Despite the cozy relation that he has with the press, Biden is constantly walking back one of his statements. What kind of POTUS would this senile old man make? Laughable, if not such a serious possibility.
Trump falsely says Biden, a practicing Catholic, is "against God"  Again, trump is making false statements. The man is just disgusting and can not be believed about anything. How does he live with himself? lonely for sure.
Biden faces backlash for comparing diversity in African American, Latino communities  trump wishes Biden said something bad. Trump is so desperate he is now making up stories that disparage Biden. Good luck with that idea. Trump is so bad at his statements.
And yet, your vote depends on Biden’s VP pick.. sigh
Who said this about Biden, a Putin paid twitter bot or the president of the United States? "Take away your guns, take away your Second Amendment. No religion, no anything. Hurt the Bible. Hurt God. He’s against God. He’s against guns. He’s against energy."
Donald Trump claims Joe Biden is 'against God;' Biden aides call Trump a hypocritical divider  trump continues to be vile and disoriented. He is clueless when he is attempting to attack anyone he cares to. Just a pouty child.
It is a ploy by the Trump organization so people vote for him instead of Biden which takes votes away to help trump win. It's another desperate way that Trump is trying to cheat the election, pathetic and ridiculous
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, says he did not mean to suggest community is a 'monolith'
Should Joe Biden fail to debate President Trump at least three times, it amounts to an admission that he is unable to carry out the duties of President.

Uhmm, are you accusing Obama or Biden or the NBA of murder? You do realize this has happened under a Trump presidency?

Could it have been the rare exception of Black people who don’t think alike that Biden spoke so eloquently of today?
My lamp...and it doesn’t work ... just like Joe Biden.
Biden claims to be a Catholic but is for abortion up to  birth and if pushed he would probably go further that seems to be the next step, after birth.  Catholics are anti abortion so he isn’t really a Catholic.
Excellent responses. I know you were not attacking me personally. You're correct that old white dudes have dominated high office in USA. But not nearly like in the past. Frankly, Biden won the primary race due to perceived electibility. Mistake.
I will absolutely vote for Biden as long as he offers to kick god right in the teeth
They could  have been mistaken and the account was “rare exception” of black people who don’t think alike (according to Biden).
If your classroom is still self-contained, you are not the right spokesperson for Joe Biden.

If Biden is elected and has to deal with these countries that are hostile with the US, how will he handle that?  Will he just get mad and call them names like he does to his own supporters? Or will his anger get our country into trouble? War? Animosity?
What a surprise...Republicans, with Cory Gardner playing dirty tricks with our election!!  If you can’t win honestly YOU CHEAT!  Black Americans won’t leave Biden in droves and vote for a mentally ill singer!
Joe Biden will not show up in person to stand 6+ feet away from Trump and debate him for 90 minutes. He’s not capable of pulling it off, and everyone knows it. Excuses will be made, he’ll blame Trump, the media will comply, etc., but he won’t do it.
The debate made a difference in a general election was Carter. vs. Reagan. It made people realize Reagan he had no mental issues and then he took off in the polls. If, and this is unlikey, Biden debated well enough that 2-3% thought he was "all there" it could make a difference.
joe biden really said "I don't give a fuck about who my vp is and neither should you. now look at my cool cars". mad respect honestly
This is why all of you are so fundamentally dishonest
Biden wants to re engage with Iran. This is against Trump policy. His surrogate, John Kerry has been meeting them privately. They are our sworn enemy. If Biden wins and one of his transition team reaches out to Iran informing of a new policy direction should this be Logan Act ?

I put down my marker a month ago that Biden’s VP pick will be replaced on the ticket.
Dear   Mail me my ballot. I don’t care what happens in the next 90 days.   ✅Joseph R Biden  ❌ Donald J Trump  ✅John Hickenlooper ❌Cory Gardner   #BlueWave2020
This is another attempt by Republicans because they're so desperate to lose the election do you get people to vote third-party which takes away votes from Biden, it's comical the depths that Republicans will go to cheat the election!
Trump Debunks Own Attack on Biden Allegedly Ducking Debates: 'He Has Not Said That'  If trump were to debate it would be a liefest for sure. The man is dishonest, lies his ass off and will say anything that comes to mind. The man is worthless as a leader.
Trump Debunks Own Attack on Biden Allegedly Ducking Debates: 'He Has Not Said That'  If trump debated he would be a total failure. The GOP is scared shitless to see him on the stage showing how pathetic and unqualified he really is.
As Sen Graham so eloquently pointed out....he was a high ranking official in a Presidential transition team.  If Joe Biden wins will he be able to have his surrogates talk to Chinese officials about their changes in foreign policy without risk of a Logan Act charge?
It’s just so funny how people try to shift the narrative...Biden couldn’t last two minutes under heavy scrutiny in an interview with a real impartial journalist.  Unlike the hacks we see all over the place.
More Bernie crap heard from...I will take ANYONE Biden decides on!  HE gets that decision!
Have you looked at the comments section? People are just... hmmm 🤔... they fight as if there is a huge difference. Out of all the people in the country. Our choice is Trump or Biden. If you haven’t figured out, there is no right or left anymore. Actually maybe never
We hope that Joe Biden wins the election so that all the Trump voters get the mental illness care they so desperately need!
When are you interviewing Biden?
Joe Biden when you won the presidential election of 2020 would you ask the President of Vietnam to have South Vietnam return the country of South Vietnam as a new independent Nation with a New South Vietnamese Government with a New law's and also has it's own Constitution.
Biden should appoint independent prosecutor immediately to investigate abuse &amp; malfeasance. This reinforces need to have (1) full, qualified and vetted team in place so confirmation hearings can begin immediately and (2) well-defined, comprehensive and prioritized plan of action.
If Joe Biden wins then nobody in his transition team should be allowed to discuss new foreign policy with any other foreign country or face the Logan Act.  Or does this only apply when Obama was President?
Of course Biden will not travel to give a speech. He’s hiding in his basement until after election. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional democracy.
Keystone XL puts Biden on hot seat by striking deal with four labor unions -  -  #KXL #climatechange #PAleg #Marcellus
Yes... if he considers himself a viable candidate to hold the position of leader of the free world. If Biden and his constituents feel he’s not capable of holding his own in a live debate then how in the hell is “Prez Biden” going to handle himself with other world leaders?
me, too. &amp; Biden is not a strong candidate.
If Trump is going to do his acceptance of the nomination from the White House it should be in the bunker. And to make things fair Joe Biden should be able to do his acceptance in the Rose Garden
You mean the guy wants to be POTUS and he can’t take being called a name?  So he’s a snowflake too?   If  is the idiot you all claim, Biden should be jumping at the chance to get in the arena.
Biden is the first Manchurian Candidate in US. Hence, the endorsements by the Communist Party in US and support by the CCP in China.
And, Joe Biden wants to lead the country? What a travesty for the American people, if he were to win. Biggest con job by the Marxist Democrats in American history.
They didn't watched the full video, they know he has a stuttering problem.  Biden said nothing wrong, trying make nothing out of nothing...thats they are trying to do.
For more than four years, we’ve heard that  is a dithering idiot.  Yet the Democrats are starting the drumbeat that   won’t debate him?  If Biden can’t debate the “dumbest guy alive“ what’s he gonna do with Putin and Xi? #MAGA  #Election2020 #Debate2020
Not nearly the level of gaffe as Biden asking a black journalist if he’s a junkie. So there’s that.

Gordon Chang: China Prefers ‘A Biden Presidency’
It’s simply a different political race than the one the pundits and talking heads are calling.    Biden is simply a distraction to the real opponent the president faces in minds of voters.
A Grand Total of 136 People Tuned-In Tonight to Watch Joe Biden's Campaign Unveil Its "Latino Agenda"
Pretty confident that Trump could beat Biden but...   Trump isn’t running against Joe Biden this election cycle... Donald Trump is running against the COVID virus.
Why would Dana interview Mrs. Biden isn’t Joe the one running for President.
Biden would have to be the best actor ever if you think he’s trying to fool us . The guy has lost it. Look in his eyes no one home.Shame on his family.
Biden’s a puppet with the Marxists Sanders, Warren, AOC and Pelosi pulling his strings. Biden’s a Manchurian Candidate.
Ummm. I watched like six democratic debates. Biden didn’t seem “incoherent” at all. But the Trump interview with Axios?  That’s another story altogether.
Nope; she’s qualified and I voted for her, but too much controversy, much of it fabricated by the GOP. Biden needs someone who complements his style and skills, while also being a strategic choice to appeal to a wider constituency.
Or you can vote for the child petting Biden - your choice.
Love you bro and yes Trump needs help. But unless you know a good brain surgeon to replace Biden’s you’re fucked.
Come on man - Trump is Trump but Biden can’t remember what he ate for breakfast by 10am the same day.
I bet Biden even knows what state it is in.  We now have a border wall with Mexico here in Colorado don’t you know.
So when is he going to interview Biden and follow up with good questions?
B for Biden all the way- A can go directly to jail without passing GO.
Yes, but Susan Rice I believe would be better. Why - international relations expert is needed to repair our global standing. If you want a fiery debate, Kamala would handle Nikki or Mike in a microsecond. Bottom line Biden gets my vote with either of these two on the ticket.
Bolton says he will 'write in somebody' rather than voting for Biden or Trump in 2020 election  Now I know Bolton is stupid. Wasting a vote on someone who has not chance of winning. What a bone head. Vote Biden and get your government back.
Biden wants to end Shareholder Capitalism.. that's your 401..your pensions.. your retirement.. are you voting for that??
Idiots! Joe Biden has NEVER been a left-wing radical and will never be! Idiots!
I’m voting for Biden! I’m also waiting for the real GOP to come back instead of this trump-crap they have right now!
She's a good choice for Biden. She's got the lying downpat.
How can this be excused by Sitting GOP leaders? How is he still the president of the USA? Everyone should watch this trained wreck, a complete disaster and he  wants to debate Biden, i would run this video as campaign advertising until election day.
Sen. Bernie Sanders is the most powerful ally of Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Castro, and Mao who has ever come on the American scene. And he is now Joe Biden's policy czar. This matters more than the VP pick. Ominous
It would be earth shattering if Biden did any kind of difficult interviews that are challenging .  He won’t do them just like the way he is trying to weasel out of the debates.   The contrast can’t be more evident.
Buden will never debate Trump because Biden’s not competent. He’s a disgrace and one more hoax that the Marxist Democrats are parading before the American people.
Not surprising, since Biden is a puppet of the Marxist Democrats in the US and of the CCP in China.
Biden-Babybel.  I like it.
I doubt Biden is even the one doing the choosing
Biden needs to debate, if you can’t hold your own on a debate stage, you shouldn’t be President
If you think Biden is competent, you don't know what the definition of competent is.
Biden Scores Big Endorsement From Revolutionary Communist Party Leader
So if Biden wins and Dems keep the House and take the Senate first thing they’re doing is abolishing ICE and defunding DHS right?
B. Biden...he hasn’t killed 150k Americans and he hasn’t tanked the economy.
I find GHWBs military service a qualifier which outpaces Biden. His combat experience, including being shot down, gave him something Biden never experienced and can't directly understand.  Nevertheless, Biden it is this election.
They don’t understand that Biden is a bridge back to a healthy democracy.
Trump, Biden and Kanye... really people, there are 350 million of us and this is who you get to pick for the leader of the free word?
It would be a disaster for Biden but boy I would love to see it happen 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
Two week road trip from CO to NC and back. Saw many Trump yard signs , one Biden sign. Good sign? No pun intended.
Really?  I'm not aware Biden paid off any pornstars....... (Trump has...) Don't believe that Biden is friends with Epstein. (Trump is...)
Why did you argue with guest about status of Trump campaign. You stumping for Biden?
I think the worst thing I said today is that Joe Biden is hiden’ and afraid to debate.
What’s sad is you think Biden supporters would flock to see you. But they probably should as you don’t have much time left In office.
I’m starting to think it might be a good thing for Biden to debate Trump. It would create a good comparison in cognitive ability.
Mr. Biden, I would respect you so much more if you would just stop using Twitter altogether.
I was right in my initial diagnosis of you   You CLEARLY are unable to put aside what Biden said long enough to KICK IN SOME COMMON SENSE to realize that FACTS = TRUTH &amp; there's NO seperating them some I'm going to stop trying to convince a Borg Drone otherwise as THAT would be…
My liberal 22 year old son is voting for Biden thinking he won’t make it past six months and the VP will take over. He is a Bernie supporter. 😪
Communist Party Leader Endorses Joe Biden for President
Can anyone name one thing that Biden has done while he was in office  the only reason Obama picked Biden was because he was stupid to pick up on what Obama and Hilary were doing
When did you fast forward this film? Biden’s a joke.
Dan look at Biden you know what they are afraid of.  With over 50 percent of voter’s Democrat and this is the best they can do....unbelievable.
Biden won’t debate Trump because the DNC won’t let him... Trump will make him look more stupid than what he already is..
Republicans Trump, Daines lead in latest Montana poll -  -   #Bullock #Biden #MTpol
Joe Biden is a coward and should just hide in his basement?
No. Buden supporters are an empty category. His puppeteers Sanders, Pelosi, AOC and other Marxist Democrats have supporters, but not Biden.
Of course, the puppet Biden will never appear for a debate in which the puppeteers are not able to pull his strings.
Biden Campaign Says, "He Is So Close To A VP Pick, He Can Smell Her!"🤭
Biden can barely string together two sentences
Opinion | Let’s Scrap the Presidential Debates - The New York Times
Biden has not said he supports defunding the police.
The 2020 race ain't over till it's over. Ninety days is an eternity in politics, as President Mike Dukakis and President John Kerry can tell you. Be of good cheer, Trumpsters. Defeatism is way premature.
"I won't risk my children's future with Biden." #LeadRight
Why are all of these supposed Democrats going after VP candidates and second guessing Biden’s ability to make the right choice for himself and for our country? It’s starting to piss me off.
So says the TRUMP DRONE   I wonder WTF you'll do should FOX NEWS project BIDEN the winner   I can take a guess…
It’s great to see such support for those individuals dealing with dementia. Hopefully, after Trump’s re-election, Biden can finally get some care for his affliction.
Biden has admitted he didn't get everything right, but always did his best. Would "I take no responsibility" trump admit a mistake? He won't retract his statements regarding the central park 5! I am happy he bravely signed a bipartisan bill. Next accomplishment?
Didn’t Biden also say something about not wanting his kids to grow up in a “jungle”? Why yes, yes he did. From the two liberal Snopes creators:
Let’s face it Biden isn’t able to debate Trump I don’t know if he even knows who he is.
And Biden will stop it.
My friend, Joe Biden is worse than the Clintons are.   But I don’t think you’re ready for that conversation...
I saw him on one if the shows last week. He is not giving an opinion, says he trusts Biden and that is it.
#TrumpIsLosing  Many people are saying he's a disgrace. Many people are saying he's a child rapist.  Many people are saying he's a tremendous failure. Many people are saying he knows nothing about anything. Many people are saying he's losing to Biden bigly.  🖕🏼
Jesus lol no one is harder on Biden than I am, but this is just idiocy.
I’m voting Biden no matter who his VP is. Trumpty has got to go
Isn’t that all a person needs to know to vote Biden?
Heir apparent: Would-be Biden running mates sprint to veepstakes finish -  -   #veep #KamalaHarris #KarenBass #ValDemings #TammyDuckworth #StaceyAbrams #SusanRice
Im all in on Biden but nothing pisses me off more than the fact that only ~60% of Americans vote in any given election. And then they want to complain about the direction of the country. Politicians will get too complacent and corrupt without direction.
I guess Biden is going to have to drain the swamp when he gets in. Trump just went and filled it up.
Why didn’t Obama/ Biden fix the real issues you speak of? Why only Conservatives?
Trump is a pig. But he’s a fighter. I’d rather have a fighter then a pansy like Biden. Biden is passive aggressive. Trump doesn’t care, he’ll fight for the US anywhere he goes. It may not be cordial or politically correct but as long as he has the United States back, I am in.
That's fine with me as long as the various state AGs coordinate their efforts to ensure that he is either (a) in the middle of a cuffed perp walk or (b) on a plane to Moscow within an hour of Biden saying, "...preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."
It's really because there isn't anything to resist against. Biden's creepy treatment of women is well-known and there are no doubts he was born here. The right would have nothing to go on.
I would almost want to see that, just to watch Biden calmly walk over and then punch Trumps lights out.
No debates as sadly Trump would take advantage of Biden's speech impediment and try to run him over by just talking over him every chance he would get.
Joe Biden is not Hillary Clinton
Biden did Wallace in March
#ResistBiden Resist ANYTHING Biden
Biden's cognitive abilities are in rapid decline.
You need this sign! And a Biden sign! #Resist don’t look at the hot mess of the grass in my yard #teenagers
Democrats sure know how to govern don’t they?  Great testimony for Biden!!!
And one more thing... lol... I don’t know how a nobody like me gets in touch with  , but I would like to nominate both  and  to be guests on behalf of Americans at President Joe Biden’s inauguration.
I can’t believe this is America. When Trump was elected a friend of mine said, “America is on its way to become a third world country”. She was right. However, always the optimist, I believe Joe Biden will make America inclusive - All mean All! #YesWeCanAgain
Biden can’t feed, dress or wipe himself, much less carry on a thought without a teleprompter.
You Asked For It  I will support Joe Biden’s VP pick.  I will not allow the media to tear down a female candidate.  I’ll call out any democrat for publicly bashing Biden’s VP pick.  This election is life or death for many. We don’t have the luxury to complain. Let’s get to work!
Biden’s never had a rally 😂
Okay I'm starting to like this Biden fella
Holy shit!  I can only hope that’s Biden wins means AG Harris and Sec of Treas. Warren will spend the next 4 years leading the effort to uncover and prosecute these scum bag! 😡
“If we tested less, there would be less cases.” Lol but keep telling me how Biden is the only one with mental issues🤦🏼‍♂️
I promise not to support Biden and his VP pick. Honest!
Mainstream Media must expose and discredit the upcoming Putin disinformation op being cooked by Barr, Durham, Graham, Giuliani et al. They’re attempting to undo The Mueller Report and damage Biden. Fiona Hill warned us.     ‼️
Mainstream Media must, without fail, expose and discredit the upcoming Putin disinformation op that Barr, Durham, Giuliani, Graham are cooking up attempting to unravel The Mueller Report and try to damage Biden!! No chasing the story for the sake of ratings! Fiona Hill warned us!
She’s a communist who stands up for Castro and Cuba. Perfect for Biden’s VP
Per CNN, Biden banned the app from his campaign.
Can’t wait to drop off my ballot at the police department, in my mail in state of Colorado, cssting my vote for Joe Biden.  #YesWeCanAgain
You missed it. In the event that President Biden could not perform his duties, VP is next in line to the Obal office. In that case, a VP can make the Republicans shiver.
However, Bill Kristol stops short of asking Americans to vote for Joe Biden. So, I can’t fully endorse this video by retweeting it.
Incorrect. I'm independent. I will not vote for Trump under any circumstances, but my vote for Biden is contingent on VP. I will grit my teeth and vote for him anyway with most choices, but if he goes to far or chooses badly unqualified, my vote could be gone. /1
imagine being the person who has to explain to joe biden what tiktok is
We will be a hell of a lot safer under President Biden and so will our Military then we have been under your "leadership".
Certainly seemed to be what he was saying. Also if he weren’t extremely cautious in his view of candidates Biden may not be the nominee in the first place.
Boy - this makes any money Hunter earned look like chump change. I found an animated GIF of the outrage by Conservatives who complained about Hunter Biden.
can I submit an entire interview segment with joe biden
What and be replaced with plugs Biden won’t happen.
Hopefully Biden not paying attention to these guys.

Lol, so he thinks California is really in doubt pending VP pick. He can’t possibly be that stupid. Even considering he is Joe Biden.
this also applies to the prinzipulled leftys who feel it necessary to spend all of their time on here letting everyone know that they hate biden and aren't voting. we fucking get it already talk about something else there's a million hundred other things going on in the country
True. But then why does anyone listen to any politician re: "govt created jobs"? I guarantee as soon as Biden is President there will be any number of Rs deriding him for "failing to create jobs".
Oh, haven’t you heard?  Trump executed him with Bill, Hillary, Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Biden, and a few hundred others. Those are doubles you see now.
Indeed.  It’s a bad choice but clearly Biden is better
Any chance you want to comment about Biden observation around 4/24 that Trump will want to delay the election?  Made Biden look like Nostradamus.
Biden oversaw implementation of Obama’s Stimulus Plan after the economy crashed under another Republican president. Millions of jobs added. Now under this Republican President all that gain is gone
Lol 😂😂😂😂 good lord the Democrats are concerned about Joe Biden! The one candidate literally worse than Hillary Clinton! Good job Dimms
That’s what your boy Biden said
As if it is any surprise that the Russians will interfere in this election and try to to the so-called "October Surprise". No surprise either that the Republicans will help.
This is BS using the Eulogy for John Lewis to campaign for Biden through Obama? Why isn't Biden out there speaking? Being in office 47 years I am sure he knew John Lewis very well.The Demos do not want you to see how incompetent Biden really is. WOW They stoop so low. Trump 2020
Swing Voters in Michigan Just Offered the WORST News for Joe Biden!  via
Scott, you know you are not voting for Biden but you are voting for the VP.
No worries everytime Biden opens his mouth he puts his foot in it.
Right MN is Trumps fault, so tired of Obama/Biden political BS
Jason, millions of folks believe Trump is the worse President in history and a lying criminal. When asked about Biden’s qualifications to be President, you replied “better than Trump”. That’s quite the endorsement!  Biden’s better than a criminal.
I think they will respond either way, unless Biden commits to Medicare 4 all, open Borders, abortion until birth, defunding the police, student loan forgiveness and universal income, they are going to riot.
Offset by the many republicans who will vote for Biden. You’re boy just ain’t that popular.
Are you scared? Americans already know...Joe Biden wins!
Why wasn’t Biden there, he’s the nominee, not Obama? He’s the one who should have spoke.
I think the Biden campaign shifted into a higher gear today with the remarks at John Lewis’s memorial service.
The Marxist puppet Biden will never debate President Trump.
It was a Democrat rally since they are having to go virtual next month. Where was Biden?
Why didn’t Biden speak, he’s the Democrat nominee? This was a racist, partisan rant at an honorable mans funeral. Gross
8 years Obama/Biden administration and between the two of them they never accomplished crap.
So is Biden next with his political rally speech, oh wait he was in his basement this morning. Why wasn’t he a speaker, he’s the Democrat nominee?
I mean, Biden isn't President. Not sure what you are on about, buster?
They have to keep Flynn quite until after the election, he knows far to much about the Obama/Biden corruption

Donna Brazile cheats by giving the debate questions 2 Hillary ahead of time. She lies on a daily basis about Repubs &amp; our Prez, yet she professes 2 be a woman of faith &amp; wants us 2 believe Joe Biden is too. Not sure she's the right messenger.

All this talk about Biden's problems are projection and you know it. Trump was saying that Biden mispronouncing words was exactly what Trump did with Thigh-land. Trump looks ill when he walks, he's losing concentration when he talks. He's destroying tus. Do you care
Alongside Joe Biden and Donald Trump's name on Colorado's presidential ballot will be Kanye West.
Do you ever wonder who is writing Joe Biden’s tweets?
You, Biden, said racism is "baked into" Trump's campaign.... And class warfare is baked into yours and that's inextricably linked to the very same racism. It's why we hate you too, Biden, sir.
Politically, what do you believe is the alternative? Are Joe Biden and the Democrat platform more Christ like? I see you don't like Trump. (Me either) just curious what you think is a better option with our choices?
Also, Putin’s fear of a Biden presidency! He’s more afraid of Biden than he was of Obama! It’s the same fear that all the dictators have. Erdogan, MBS, Kim,,, they have taken advantage of the US in ways only drumpf would allow.

Omg! Republicans for Biden. No! Nobody could be that stupid. Anyone who even considers Biden is not intelligent enough to vote. It is obvious that he is very sick. Cia/FBI should be vetting, &amp; telling him he cant run. Duh!

I’ll take things that Joe Biden didn’t type himself for 500 Alex
You were expecting an original thought from Joe Biden? C’mon man.
So Biden can hurt GOD? Lol and if he’s against God he’s against guns? I don’t remember Jesus packing heat.
Ah yes, Joe Biden the devout Roman Catholic, has no religion and will hurt God. 🤨
Biden will take away food, water, oxygen, housing, businesses, dogs and the world will explode instantly. Alternative facts
why do you think West suppresses black votes for Biden?  Why Do you think blacks are SO STUPID to vote for a clearly mentally ill man who proclaimed slavery a choice??!!  Just because he is black? Are you kidding me?!   Your racism and stereotyping run deep.

Norah O’Donnell makes a lot of sense. I doubt she’d be hard on Trump, certainly not harder on him then she’d be on Biden. Watching the impeachment coverage via CBSN (she led the main panel discussion) was a bit disorienting in how she tried to make Trump’s defense sound rational.
I have a complaint with the Republician party. I was planning to vote straight Republician but I'm becoming aware of Republicians voting for Biden. I think it's your responsibility to make all of aware of these traitors. Trump 2020
Has Joe Biden lies to me over 20,000 times? Is he beholden to Putin? Has Biden been accused of rape and sexual abuse by over 40 women? Has he been credibly accused of raping a 13 year old?  I’m voting for the honest man with morals.
positive attitude for the future, and two, a HUGE fire under our feet to continue to fight until the very last mail in ballot is counted.   Biden will win.  But the fight continues.
course of the election outcome. (Caveat - barring cheating and/or foreign interference or both). Add to this Trump's apparent disinterest in actually governing, his malaise, his very real possible health issues, all point to a landslide for Biden.
While I am 100% firmly against becoming complacent, I am going to go out on a limb here: I think the electorate is already "hardened" meaning, there is very little that either Biden or trump could do now to change the course of the election: to be more specific:
But hey,  let’s keep hearing how Biden can’t read or talk. Biden has a stutter, something millions have, what’s Trump’s excuse?
I don’t care if Biden never answers another question. Biden isn’t petty - let blue states die - or stupid, Trump is stupid.   Biden hasn’t been accused of rape several times including the rape of a 13 year old.
Join the ever expanding club. My 93 year old, conservative father is voting Biden, and blue in local elections, he is pissed. He is also quick to say "But, I am NOT a democrat". I am still learning from this man, thx Dad.
tens of thousands of people are dying. 1000 a day, and this stupid man is the one you want us to vote for. Hard Pass, I’ll take Biden, the man with a plan to stop it.
VOTE FOR BIDEN IF YOU REALLY WANNA MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN BY GETTING RID OF THE TRASH IN THERE NOW
My first time voting for president and my two choices are Biden and Trump?!? This is the biggest letdown since finding out life only gets harder after high school
One of the reasons the Dems want to keep Biden from debating Trump is the questions it will raise about Joe. Like who will actually be running the government? Certainly not this guy... Does he even know what year it is?
You’ve destroyed America. President Biden will #BuildBackBetter #Biden2020Landslide
What are you talking about?  Biden is the sharpest Democrat I know.  It’s a sad state of affairs in the Democratic Party but it makes sense that he would be their leader.
Democrats Urging Biden Not to Debate Trump. (Also suggest he take a five month vacation and not return until election is over)
Looks like a Biden Train....
We have been voting by mail for over 15 years in Colorado and have never had a problem. We also have ballot drop off boxes all over that make it so easy. Will never go back to voting in person. 🍊💩 is just trying to keep Americans from voting! #Biden  #BlueWave2020
Yep, Trump will change it back to the way it was instead of going down your suicidal socialism path, Mr. Biden.
Yeah... Biden is worried about jobs... The only jobs Joe has ever worked to protect are those in executives suites and investment towers.
Yep they just changed Jim Morrison cause of death to China virus as well! He also voted for Biden in 2020
i cant tell weather i can tolerate trump supporters or biden supporters. none of them have common sense
I plan on voting for Biden at the same rate his campaign adopts actual progressive reforms.
Your all a bunch of cowards. Biden can’t even go into public without be led around by the arm.
Biden says they're NOT BLACK
Except there are a ton of them voting Biden.🤷‍♀️
Absolutely. The Obamas thrived in the corruption of Washington and want nothing more than for it continue under Biden.

Ryan Knight won't vote for Biden. That is how this conversation started.
If you are not voting for Biden you are voting for Trump.
You show me this says medicare for all! Biden is all for healthcare for all! IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE MEDICARE!
Yep. I want healthcare too. I know it is an issue. But those that won't for Biden because he won't back Medicare for all, well Trump wins. Then you get nothing. He will dismantle ACA. So you are willing to put trump in office for 4 more years (or more) for one issue?
You must have psychosis. This has nothing to do with Joe Biden. #TrumpIsACrybaby #TrumpFailsAmerica
I am not sure Joe Biden should even be driving a car, let alone running a country.  I am waiting for him to forget which country he lives in.  He has seemed to forget just about everything else.  I thought I was bad at public speaking.  I am looking pretty good.  And I am on Oxy.
the majority of us feel this way.  You’re attacking Biden’s health, age, etc., make you look scared and desperate.
This is not how we do things in this country. What if Joe Biden wouldn’t give relief to red states and cities after a disaster? What if congress passed a law where no state got back more than they give?  What then?More #LiarInChief BS from ⁦  Who only sits foot on choice property for Photo Ops And ⁦ toddles along behind singing Donny’s praises  #DumpTheTrump and Cory as well
This elderly white couple is voting for Biden. We have never, ever voted for a Republican.
What's amazing is Biden could unite the party instantly by putting Bernie as VP but he won't. Same as HRC in 16.
Not a trump but I am what ever makes this country better bot. And anyone with a brain knows that's not biden
Have you met Joe Biden?
So remarkable he had to drop it after he said some of the most racist ignorant shit I ever. Heard the democratic party is so sorry this dude shouldn't be allowed to work at a waffle house let alone run a country. Biden just throw in the towel buddy. I can't wair for the debates
Biden, he’s probably the nominee!
I made a thing. also: vote Biden!
This actually trends if you follow crazy logic so I'm trying. Trump is in power because he made a deal with the devil.. God apparently can't defeat the devil totally (that's why he still exists)..So Biden must be more powerful than God (and therefore blasphemous) to defeat Trump

If your vote for Biden hinges on his veep pick, you're stupid. Don't  me. Just block me.
Seems like he’ll say anything to win — Biden is a life long Catholic. Certainly more religious that Pres Trump. And more cautious gun regulation is not the same as taking your guns away. This feels like he’s getting desperate and over exaggerating to stoke fear.
Obviously Trump believes Biden is stronger than God. Strange for such a religious man.

if not for biden, they would have found another way to stop him—biden was obviously “plan b” anyway—if by some weird chance he won the general they would have destroyed the presidency to destroy him
So I guess you want to murder your constituents so no one to vote in November. Democrats wear MASKS. Grow up. The bullying is going g to end when Biden is in office. Return of CLASS and care for this country. Not someone like you or bunker boy who wants to rape it for profit.
Who’s gonna tell Biden the Onion jokes about him aren’t funny anymore. They are, in fact, “cringe”
Since Trump has surrendered to the pandemic it is a virtual certainty that Biden’s inauguration will be....virtual.
I am and always will be a Biden fan, he has my vote.We graduated from same college. I just think taking this much time to pick VP leaves some thinking he has a problem making decision.
don’t think warren was ever in the running. even her mild reformism made her complete anathema to the financial industry execs who’ve been running biden his whole career as “Senator from MBNA”
it might have been poor optics for Biden to randomly accuses a Black man of being on drugs, but at least he went with “cocaine” and somehow avoided saying “crack.” he’s learned.
Bass wouldn’t be so bad, and i’d happily vote for her re-election as the 47th president four years from now. but i just put the curse on her. watch biden pick Rice—Condi

No surprise that they want to keep sleepy Joe in the basement to keep his phony poll numbers as high as possible.
I feel like Biden isn’t the kind of person to create the kind of changes this country actually needs to truly be better from all the damage.
can’t imagine backroom deals &amp; pleading calls to rich donors it took to secure that! congratulations! officially  means your candidacy is non-threatening to big banks, big oil &amp; the pharma lobby. you’ll work hard, like Joe Biden, to make sure nothing will fundamentally change 🌊
If Biden doesn't win this election I believe revolution is a real possibility.
Jill Biden knows! She's a doctor! It's sickening his family allows this!
I will support Biden's VP pick....it doesn't matter if that person is not qualified at all. We all know the only qualifications needed are more melanin in her skin. We all know that the first thing a dem looks at is skin color.

Because of his *stellar* Foreign Policy? Ha! Biden runs circles around him in that arena. That’s a long track, btw. 😬
Because they themselves have become leftist extremists. There is a video of Ilham Omar proudly saying Biden is the most progressive Dem Presidential Candidate the party has ever had...and we ALL know she is ant-America!
No no no no no I will not vote if Biden chooses a Scientologist.
If Trump resigns he doesn’t “lose”. Then Pence can pardon him as Ford did for Nixon. Win-win.  Pence gets to say he was Prez for a few months before Biden takes office.
He is trailing Biden by a lot right now. I really REALLY doubt he turns it around with so little time to go.
biden said his VP pick would be ready for the presidency “on day one.” Rice has never held elective office, has had no involvement in domestic policy. it will be a tough sell. but not the worst possible choice: that would be klobucop. that’s why my money is still on her.
I did that during the first Biden interview i watched after he became the nominee
A lot of people seem to act like Obama and Biden are perfect.   Yeah Trump is really fucking bad, but Obama and Joe have their flaws.
POTUS lays trap. "Delay election?" Libs lose their minds and come out in force. "No way! Election isn't moving! No authority!" Biden taken down, Dems in despair. Delay the election!! We need time for new candidate! POTUS (smirking): Sorry, you said no delays. Imma reclaim my time
We were until the Chinese Flu.  No one could sustain the prosperous economy through that. Biden has trouble with where he is and what year it is. You know it. You’re just too bias to think logically.
You'd better wake up and listen to this all you Christians and Americans...This election is about the future of our country! A vote for Biden is a vote for the downfall of our society!!!

With a democratic Senate, Biden will get things done.
Why would anyone even think this?  Can somebody defend this position or are her marbles just as loose as Joe Biden?

Have you shown your father half as much interest in his medical care that you have shown Biden? I know you are kind of the ignored one because you don't have his name &amp; you don't have a vagina, but that reality that you don't SEE your father's brain is rotten fruit is glaring.
The idea that Kanye should suspend his mental illness long enough for Biden to get elected is ridiculous. The run is the disease.
No one would do what you've done!  Competent presidents would have nipped this in the bud in December of last year.  They wouldn't ignore everything around them for months.  I've been working from home in March and I don't see any end it sight -- until President Biden!
Educate yourself and read, Biden has been called out for his pro-abortion stance.
Do I want to hear a debate of Trump  saying Biden is going to destroy GOD and Biden saying you are a ridiculous fool. I will pass. It is not my type of comedy.
Biden was also 100% against gay marriage until the SCOTUS ruled on the decision. He suddenly supports their rights to marry.
if Biden's thumb was on life support and Biden's thumb were on the ballot, I'd vote for Biden's thumb.  Doing anything else only contributes to the total destruction of the United States.

Trump is god in this scenario. Biden will hurt Trump if he wins....like his feelings, I guess?

It seems like the obvious voting strategy (at the national level) is "Biden plus Republicans in the Senate to check him." I suspect the outcome will be "Biden plus the Senate Republicans take a shellacking."
Next week:  "Biden's green deal means cars are illegal, dishwashers illegal, no cops, no airplanes, no toilets.  Think about that, no toilets.  I think about that.  My hotels have the best toilets.  Biden will take all the toilets out of the suburbs and give them to inner city"

So Joe Biden said that the African-American isn't diverse because AFRICAN-Americans' ancestors are from Africa, but Hispanic-Americans can have ancestors from Spain, Mexico, Brazil, etc.  How is that insulting?  Who is insulted?

Still baffling that the leaders of the free world, the most powerful nation on earth, are giving people a choice of Biden or Trump as president.
"Biden hurts God"  Dude, don't we have to vote for the guy who can hurt God?  I mean maybe he wasn't talking about The God. Just some little Greek or Egyptian god. Little "g".  But still, that's pretty impressive. I think I will vote for that guy no matter what, right?
This is what Trump said today about Joe Biden, a practicing Catholic. What church does Trump go to? Trump plays golf on Sundays, right? How can Biden "hurt God"? Does Trump sound like a leader is this video?
😂😂😂😂  Honey, read up.
It is your vote. What is it with some white women? He hasn’t destroyed and killed off enough us yet?  His health appears worse than Biden’s. So you approve more of Pence the CINO (Christian in name only) and one of that man in the White House’s “followers”?
I’m sorry but that headline is one of the dumbest I’ve ever read and I can’t imagine anything in your article that could possibly change my opinion.   You’d pick trump/pence over Biden/someone you don’t like?
I know. That man in the White House’s VP is a CINO (christian in name only) and a “follower”. How could Biden’s VP be worse?  For some that R means everything to them 😢.
Are you a never trump?  If you are unable to vote for Biden depending on his VP pick wa wa, maybe you are party over country. Sounds like an excuse.

Joe Biden Wins!
I guess POC are just supposed to vote for him because of the color of his skin?  That way Biden would lose and Trump would win.  Trump's not fooling anyone and it's not going to work!
Of course, for this to occur Trump would have to overtake Biden in (at least) four places he's currently losing: PA, FL, ME-02, and NE-02. But it's true that this map is plausible.
Who in God's green earth thinks that debating Biden will help Trump?  The man tanked in an interview with Jonathan Swan -- he's going to dominate Joe Biden?  Like him or not, Biden knows his shit!  Trump -- not so much!
I agree. As an Independent voter, I don't need to hear about Trump's plans. He'll either be lying or... well, he'll just be lying because he only has plans that service Putin's agenda &amp; his boss don't want him sharing those out loud.  I suggest Joe #Biden hold virtual town halls.
I don’t care if Biden is in cognitive decline. He could spend the next 4 years in diapers drooling on himself and still do a far better job than trump.
Are there betting odds yet on whether Biden's vp will become president before January 2025? I'd personally guess around a 1/10 chance.
We will. Vote Biden.
In today's news, Fuck Joe Biden.
Sometime near the end of the year. . . . . Have to get past the riots from the left when Biden(D) looses, then the pandemic will suddenly disappear. . .
Christine, it’s unfortunate that Trump learned so much from Clinton and Biden, but if what you say about Trump is true, then they taught him well. He would have learned from the best.
this is the reality of decades of Presidents and the Congress and Bureaucracy sucking up to Chins allowing them to gain this status at our expense. Like Biden’s family making cozy deals with them when he was OBAMA VP!!!
Vanilla ice cream helps sway people who think chocolate is too exotic. Biden is a home churned vanilla. French vanilla would have been too much for the conservative dems.
Florida can have vote by mail according to Trump, but not Nevada?  What will he say when Florida's mail in ballots favor Joe Biden?
I follow several people that don't follow me back! Biden,  Polis, Obama, Maddow, several comics, an actor or two, several organizations...
Democrats are creating a narrative, yet you say it is Joe Biden that is afraid?  How does that make sense at all? We see how Trump gets flustered by the truth on his response to COVID.  It's not Biden who should be afraid?
Fundraise seems to be a key word. Also, right now most of the push against vp candidates seem to be from democrats. Once a woman is selected, we will feel the full push from the GOP. They will attack her much more than Biden...whoever it is.
And what specifically should he be doing Hill?  Destroying the economy like you and yours want to do just so you can get elected.  How about blaming China?  Sure you won’t do that because it won’t help Biden get elected.  Of course him speaking won’t help him get elected either
Dunno about healthcare but am hoping Biden won’t subvert our constitution, remove all oversight, divide the nation, distort facts, argue with science, spread ignorance and hate and disgust all of us with a moral compass the way Trump has.
You are such a joke. No wonder Biden is beating you!
That’s Trumps America. He’s still president and according to you and his supporters he will win in 2020. So this is all his nazi style tactics, not Biden.
This interview is so painful to watch. He repeats his same stick to nausea. It is embarrassing and horrifying that this man in the White House is the president of the United States of America. How did we fall so far? Vote Biden Vote Biden Vote Biden.
B!  The one where Joe Biden gets down on the level of children to talk to them!
Why would Biden waste his time discussing politics with a complete idiot who is the Leader of the Republican Party??
Not at all unlikely.  It is still hard to see Biden as the nominee.
I'll vote for Biden in the hopes he chooses Harris as VP.  She can take over if he's ever incapacitated.
I voted against Trump in 2016 and I’ll do it again in 2020.  Clinton and Biden were both my last choice in the democratic field.  Either is light years ahead of Trump.
Joe Biden pays tribute to John Hume
I don’t think him running helps that man in the White House. He wants to take women’s choices away, doesn’t have any plans, and is counting on people to vote for him because they like his music. The gullible “followers” are with the man in the White House not the Biden voters.
You notice how we refer to the man in the White House’s people as followers and Biden’s (and other politicians) as voters?
Were your supporters wearing masks?  Florida is suffering from a spike.  Biden supporters might have chosen to stay home to avoid spreading CV.

Hadn't hear the term "Basement Biden".... Love it..!
At this point does it even matter who Biden chooses as a running mate? Does it even matter if there are any debates? Aren’t we all just waiting for November? Who could possibly be undecided now?
Sorry, that won't fly. You didn't just predict the right will be peaceful if Biden wins, you said that for over 200 years violence has been a tool of the left, but shunned by the right. That is already false.
As much as I hate trump, Joe Biden sucks. Why isn’t he running as a Republican? He doesnt have any democratic values, he doesn’t care about the people. He is a bootlicker that supports cop. Both trump and Biden are horrible men.
At least Biden doesn’t promote a quack doctor who believes in demon sex.   Well, you just keep worrying about the anti Christ and ignore the current one in the WH.  The rest of us are going to purge him come November.
And we have had a life time of Biden to see what he is about.  Had enough of that Vado. And now he doesn’t even know what office he is running for.  Too stupid to debate Trump
You are running in hopes that it hurts Biden, that’s why you are running?  Why don’t you just campaign for that man in the White House?  Other than taking away women’s right to choose, which won’t hurt Biden, what do you stand for, I mean besides money and fame?
As Fareed said just today “ Trump has turn the American Presidency into a reality television show but the Covid19 pandemic has painfully demonstrated that you cannot solved an ACTUAL crisis with ratings &amp; tweets!! “ Stop the Trump Virus and vote Biden!!
That's a really good question.  He would need to practice a lot to go up against a master BS’er, deflector and liar like Trump.  Right now he seems to be winning just letting Trump campaign for him.  Biden's not a strong debater, doesn't think on his feet, and is prone to gaffes.
Agree the Biden/China deal looks bad.  And I agree the Hunter/Burisma deal stinks.  No argument there!  Hunter isn't the president so he's of less interest.  Trump's children have likely made more from China deals than Hunter.
The modern day GOP is so fucking stupid now a days. Biden said he wanted to raise corporate tax to crack down on that. He has very specific policies to create new jobs and buy more American products. And he doesn't want to defund the police he wants to give more funding.
On January 20, the US Military will report to the winner (Joe Biden, for those not paying attention). I’m pretty sure they have the wherewithal to drag his orange ass out of there.
BIDEN do the extraordinary thing &amp; DENY Trump a debate. You ARE in control. He will lose it. It’s the only thing Trump wants...don’t give it to him. DENY TRUMP!!
Let’s suppress Trump. Please Biden deny HIM by denying the debate. THAT will get into his head so fast!! Just say “no” to any debate. Just deny Trump.
Deny Trump the debate....Biden take control and just deny HIM. HE just wants the opportunity to spew more lies.
DENY TRUMP... just ignore the nuisance. Don’t Agee to debate him Biden...yea he will attack your cognitive abilities but he does anyway. Take HIS POWER away from him. You DICTATE TO HIM!!
DENY TRUMP, please Biden take charge &amp; deny him the opportunity to spew lies. Don’t debate!! Trump is trying to cast doubt about the election, you cast doubt on his worthiness...just not worth it. DENY TRUMP ....ignore him &amp; his grievances!!
Deny Trump exists...Biden don’t debate. Don’t stoop to Trump’s  level, you are better than this. DENY TRUMP &amp; you will deny him the win in November!!
How about we just IGNORE Trump and take control starting with Biden NOT debating this liar. Not ACKNOWLEDING a President that wants to delay the election...delay Trump his wish for a debate!!! He is just not worth it!! DENY Trump exists.

I will not read the article! There is no reason not to vote fir Biden on earth.
If Biden doesn't want to I don't care. The only purpose would be to display what an incompetent loon IQ45 is. That's another part of the circus that could spin out of control.
My understanding of that is that Biden was one of many dealing with Ukraine corruption and it’s been distorted into some payola thing. I do think Hunter was paid a lot for whatever services he provided Burisma.
You destroyed America's economy and killed $150,000 of us.  You want us to believe that Joe Biden will do worse than that?   #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Oh, Biden did pretty well in several of the debates against 10 other excellent candidates. Trump has issues making sense in his speeches.
He will definitely try to make sound like Biden’s is scared to debate.  But we all know he projects and he is scared to death to debate Biden. He will retreat to his bunker before debating Biden.
Lt Col Vindman is an American #Hero for speaking truth to power. He exposed Trump for who he is; a lawless, corrupt president.  Once #Biden is elected, maybe he'll name  Ambassador to Ukraine. That would chap Trump's ass.

This is not an accurate account of the article. It's not saying she'll be disloyal, just distracted by the fact that her own campaign will begin about 2 years into the new Biden administration.
A veep candidate with less national ambition could act more freely and more deferentially toward Biden. The “anointed front runner” baggage won’t be as heavy. These advantages could help Biden with his agenda without hurting the party’s prospects in 2024.
Trump IS worse.  You guys are worse with Benghazi, Hillary's emails and Hunter Biden.  Also, 'libtard' shows you to be a #Cult45 member.  If you want to be taken seriously, drop the Qanon rhetoric.

Delay and automatically put in Biden the poll leader
I've no doubt there are racially insensitive videos of Biden.  He's been in government since the 70's.  Do you have any racially insensitive videos of Biden in the last 20 years; since the millennium?  We've all learned, grown and changed in the intervening decades.
Heads up! Another obvious, blatant deep state move coming. Durham, almost certain, won't release his report until after election to protect Dems. Says don't want to interfere with results. He prefers we elect Biden, a big part of spygate.
The reason this won't work is republicans have been telling us for years that they're all the same -- corrupt.  Even if Americans think that maybe the Obama administration did something wrong, they'll figure Trump is way worse and Biden will be better for America!
#NobodyLikesTrump Just a joke of a frail, sniveling loser. Vote Biden 2020 &amp; let’s make this country BETTER!!
Are you sure they’re Biden allies⁉️ This sure stinks of Trump/Putin‼️‼️
You would make a fantastic vice president. I hope Biden picks you.
“Debates” are just another chance for Trump to rant and lie in the spotlight. Excepting the unlikely scenario where numbers show debates could help Dems lock up the Senate, Biden should pass. Make embedded fact checkers a condition so Trump will chicken out.
So this is your campaign strategy, huh? Poor me, Obama and Biden, Wah. Great choice. Go with that. #JoeBiden2020
What house? 50 million people are unemployed and facing eviction at the end of this week. What will be left when Biden takes over from "your reign?"Problem: Biden thinks Trump supporters read. They don’t. Therefore with this ad, they only see cars, billboards, and toilet paper.
Trump says Thigh-land, Roasted endlessly, Biden "Accidentally" says blacks are not diverse, Forgiven.
And if Biden and BO were so progressive, why wasn't there a 1st Step Act in the 8 yrs under in the BO/Biden administration? Listen, im not above being impressed by credentials and formalism and politeness, but when discussing policy none of that matters.
Biden also voted for the War in Iraq. How many rural whites, poor blks &amp; brown folks young men were killed in that unnecessary war that eroded all of our civil liberties and is bankrupting our country to this day? Trump and his tacky RE properties had no real power over blks.
Everyone acknowledges that the war on drugs was a failed experiment and big stain on the our country. We threw millions of ppl in a cage for max time, for non violent crimes. Biden, however, still thinks it was the right thing to do. What has Trump done thats equivalent to that?
Its a legitimate point, but let's think about who did the most harm to black and brown folks. Biden was the mastermind behind punitive crack/cocaine laws and wrote the legislation that paved the way for an entire generation of black and brown fathers to ripped from their families
“Maybe he [Biden] does have a stutter  but I know when he delivered the crime bill speech back in the 90s he didn’t stutter then. I saw the video.” -Anonymous blk man
Monday:  "Biden has full-blown dementia and doesn't even know what he's saying.  He shouldn't even be driving!"  Thursday:  "Biden is not only 100% lucid, he's cogently and explicitly describing his obviously racist thoughts."
How can Democrat’s support Biden? Simple question can someone give to me a real response? If your response is never Trump. I say back pathetic to not care what happens to OUR COUNTRY !!🇺🇸
You do realize that 4 more years of Trump is the alternative, right!?!  Biden could choose a warm egg salad as his running mate and he wouldn't lose my vote.
It does for the next four years at least. Anyone who would put us at risk by voting Biden and his progressive squad, can never profess to be conservative again. Don’t give a damn how you try and justify.
John Lewis would also agree with Joe Biden that all black people are the same.
. enjoyed your podcast with  Selfishly I want him in Biden’s administration vs a state gov or city’s mayor.  We want him at the highest in the land.
We don't need a debate to know we're voting for Biden. I would vote for a warm egg salad sandwich over you.
Michelle Obama being named Biden’s VP is tantamount to a stage four cancer diagnosis for Biden
Was he trying to “goat” Biden? I thought the word was “goad”? That alone is indicative of his cognitive ability. Or lack of.
And the difference is, the United States will do better with Trump’s policies than Biden’s.
Literal convo with my coworkers: Them: Just watch, if Biden wins, Covid will disappear. Me: So, we should vote for Biden then, right? We want Covid to disappear. Them: No! Biden will bring communism to the US. Me: I thought he was bringing Marxism. Them: He'll bring all the isms!
This drives me crazy. NASA never shut down under Obama. The shuttle just ended because Bush retired it. The video he retweeted is not NASA related. And all the recent commercial success + Artemis is literally the result of the Obama Biden administration
Knew this was coming. If he’s going to keep campaigning for Biden, Biden would be a fool not to take full advantage.  PS: this man makes my soul burn with rage. I can’t do this for another four years. Vote.
Google Biden’s response to Trump’s China travel restrictions in January 2020.
Why did Biden complain that Trump’s China travel restrictions were xenophobic and then later changed his mind? People say dumb stuff.
More proof that high-level Democrats know Biden’s mental faculties are declining.
If Biden weasels out of the debates. Trump's approval rating keeps going up (it's at 51% now) it won't matter. Trump will win in a landslide.
Obama/Biden administration spied on a political opponent abusing power of the federal government &amp; took illegal immigrant kids from their parents. Biden blames an innocent for his wife's death &amp; is a plagiarizer. List is endless; the Durham investigation concludes soon.
That’s the beauty of the debates. President Trump all by himself can put the questions to Biden.
This year’s debates could be very important because it may be the only time Joe Biden is questioned about his involvement with Crossfire Hurricane.
Gordon Chang: China Prefers 'a Biden Presidency'  #Newsmax via   NO  SURPRISE TO ME 😂
You are in denial. Trump's rally speeches are mostly off the cuff as he ad libs a lot. He has had many press conferences taking questions from a hostile press. Biden is hiding in his basement as his handlers say "no" to going on shows like Fox Sunday hosted by Chris Wallace.
But aren't we enjoying watching the "Biden needs a prominent, possibly woman as VP but not that woman, and not that one either" circular debate?
I thought all this *gestures at everything* was Biden's America ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Biden was right. I was wrong. I underestimated the depth of Trump's depravity. He will, in fact, try anything to retain power.  Fixed it for you.
Every Trump "deal" ever has been a failure, every business that produces a product or delivers a service. Only two "illusions", branding &amp; reality TV, haven't failed. You are the one with serious mental deterioration, not VP Biden.  But I don't feel sorry for you.
If we vote Biden, we get America back?
He never mentioned Biden.
I agree that this is dumb. Just like Biden saying that if you don't vote for Biden you are not black.
Yes it does. I’ve had Facebook censor 3 articles I posted. One was Joe Biden making a statement reasonable people can disagree what he said. The other was a scientific study that I posted that Facebook doesn’t like. We don’t hear much about liberals being censored by Big Tech.
People with brains lost faith in what Joe Biden said ages ago.
Please show us the evidence that drug prices will quadruple under Biden.  Just saying something doesn't make it true.
I doubt you compared Biden speech pattern from 10 years ago with today. If you did, and you were an honest person, you’d be scared to death of a Joe Biden presidency. Nearly 40% of Americans believe he’s in decline.The Russians are plotting to force Joe Biden to speak in public and actually campaign for president.  It's an attack on democracy.

Russia fears Biden like they feared Hillary. They know these true patriotic Americans really do put America first.
Biden reminds us every day in ways both large and small what having a real President is like
I don’t know how else to put it, but listening to Joe Biden speak tells me that not only does he have early onset dementia, but he’s just flat out stupid. How did he get this far?
Donald Trump has accomplished more in 4 years of government than Joe Biden has in 4 decades of government.
Did your daddy really say Biden will hurt God and the Bible?  Now that is the most ignorant thing I’ve ever heard.  Besides the things you post of course!
Your husband is intentionally interfering in an election with no intent to win, just spoil and THIS is the tweet you come up with? SRSLY?!!!!
Biden is afraid of adding a fourth debate?
Right right only Biden has gaffes..idiot
Oh dude...Biden wrote that...not Trump...you would be right if Trump wrote it or tried to say it....
seriously, do you really think black voters who are going to vote for Biden are going to change their vote to Kanye, who is a tRump supporter? if anything  just lost a bunch of votes as they would rather vote for Kanye than tRump #trumpgate
You seem to be ignoring that Biden got more votes than the other Dem primary candidates.
This is actually a pretty genius and abusive tactic. Trump can put the onus on Biden to agree to an in-person debate even tho he doesn't want to debate (has prev indicated he may or may not show up) and when Biden inevitably says no and wants a cyber debate, he can blame Biden.
That’s what I thought.  Enjoy the Biden Administration.
You’re right.  Trump’s incompetence and unfitness to lead far outpace Biden’s.   Finally someone who understands. 😆😆
I've sent you a bunch of bots this morning -- all coming from the same anti-Biden tweet. All the profile photos are nearly the same. Can you please shut that farm down? Thanks

A girl can hope because it seems like Biden is running an inept campaign right now.
No, answer the question.  I’ll rephrase: what % of the black population own their own business?  You think Biden was a racist, so your attack falls laughably flat.
Ok, so if the president can’t stop abortions why did you bring that up in the first place. Why does it matter if Biden pro choice?  Your not making sense!!!!
Thank you for reporting on this. As a “Latina” Joe Biden does not speak for me or other Latinos. He speaks  of blacks &amp; Latinos as if we’re a number and how he can pander to us to get our vote and then forget about us. More of the same
Joe Biden winning is the answer you seek.
‘their businesses’??  How many black people own their own businesses?  Kanye???  Biden a racist???  What color is the sky in your world?
To bad Biden can't remember any of the facts.
I'll give you that one. Although if you were to ask a thousand folks on the street, that same question doubt 25% could answer it. Now explain all the times Biden can't finish a sentence or goes off into the twilight zone with his answer. Actually feel sorry for the man.
I'm voting for Biden even if bursts out doing an imitation of Speedy Gonzales.
Let's have the debates, I 100% agree we should have them. After the first one is one is over I want you to tweet you honestly still believe what you say here in your tweet. I doubt you will though, you'll be to embarrassed when you see that "Hidden Biden" is losing his mind. SAD

Please, have Trump order FBI to arrest Biden and all democratic congressmen/women.
DJT clearly  suffers from the proverbial soft bigotry of low expectations, yet, somehow, Biden is held to a higher standard.
We're waaaaaay past ultimatums, though. I personally can't stand Biden, but I love my country and know that means I vote for him. Period.
Biden is actually a racist and you libs want him in office 😂
With a democratic Senate, Biden will get things done.
This is why I think Biden needs to pick someone with some econ. credibility. Like Warren. Not just check a box. I am not sure Harris or Rice does that.  One shores up judiciary  &amp; the other foreign affairs which is needed, but economy/virus, including healthcare, will be #1 issue

Which is it, exactly?  Because we're told if we don't vote Trump we're voting for Biden, and if we don't vote Biden we're giving a vote to Trump  How about, just maybe, the person we vote for is the one that gets our vote.

He just backtracks after a stink is raised. He is a segregationist at heart and has been since he got into politics.

He can't even complete a thought in an interview. Maybe his earpiece is slow as he gets fed his answers. Joe Biden is a segregationist and fought for their cause in schools crafting language still used today to oppose school integration.
Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists. he fought for their cause in schools and helped give America the language that is still used to oppose school integration today.
Going camping off the grid Monday and Tuesday.  Market will still be here Wednesday I hope unless the aliens 👽 come or Biden names Kamala 🤡 🥜
Why would anyone even think this?  Can somebody defend this position or are her marbles just as loose as Joe Biden?
NEWS: Disclosure docs show that one of Biden’s top candidates for VP made big investments in the fossil fuel industry. The revelations come as Biden has faced renewed questions about his climate policies.
But Biden did make African Americans seem like a monolith. Biden's racism is so ingrained, he just can't help himself because that is what he truly believes.
who’s more senile, Biden or Pelosi? She just claimed there are 3.3 million new cases and 70 million deaths from COVID in the last 11 weeks. More deaths than new cases?According 2 CDC there are 4.8 million cases and 160k deaths, total. #PelosiMustGo #shescrazy
Everyday Biden says something racist. Unbelievable. I can go on and on about all his statements. Wake up America. He is handing the election to Trump on a silver platter.
We ditchin Biden y’all
He won't apologize because he doesn't believe he damages people with his words and believes what he says. He has a long record of discrimination going back to trying to stop the busing during the desegregation orders.
Other than Biden she was my least favorite of the primary candidates.
does rocky think we don't realize how big of a dumbass biden is? we see it bud
Its the only reason Biden "Won"
With Biden’s VP choice expected soon, here’s whom he could pick  via  It will reek of Obama-ism and political correctness and will smell worse than a sewer.  Black-Brown-Black, women, liar, hater, puppet, who will it be?
I hope Joe Biden doesn’t campaign at all. I don’t want him getting Covid
Yeah fuck Joe Biden but there is no way a Democratic Presidential candidate isn't going to have a union bug on the actual physical button
When you KNOW Biden didn’t write it.
Your're the one accusing Dems of hiding Biden when we are in the middle of a pandemic.
LOL. This guy thinks the US provides healthcare to just anyone.  I assume you're voting for Biden as illegal immigration has only increased under Trump.
cue white people cries  “but Biden isn’t inspiring enough... he’ll delay the revolution... i wanted Bernie... both parties are the same... I just wrote an op-ed called The Liberal Case for Trump 2020...”
We all knew it
Live in CO so my ballot comes in the mail  But yes, I would stand in line to cast a vote for Biden
Because who ever wanted a picture taken with Joe Biden?
Exactly. Harris is my second least favorite of all the primary candidates (next to Biden) and so I just assume she will be the VP nomination.
Let’s see...  40: NC, TN, AR, OK, TX, NM, AZ, CA 70: MD, PA, WV, OH, IN, IL, MO, KS, CO, UT 90: MA, NY, PA, OH, IN, IL, WI, MN, SD, WY, MT, ID, WA  70 &amp; 90 are in 4 states and the only one with a woman D Senator among those states is Duckworth  That’s who Biden is picking
To be clear, anyone who votes for Kanya was never gonna vote for Biden anyhow.  I tend to think that skin color does not dictate intelligence, and no intelligent voters vote for any dude whose wife wants to COMMIT HIM TO THE FUNNY FARM!!
Don’t let trump even get 125.   Biden Power
How long til trump calls joe Biden “joe hidin’”
I 💜   His intelligent, irreverent, wry wit is a balm to my weary soul at the end of the day.
So Trump says he kissed women without their express permission.  But did he?  Where and when?  Biden kisses and gropes CHILDREN without their permission (hundreds of pictures to confirm this obvious fact), and that's okay?  Serious question:  Are you a pedophile?
Biden apologized for yesterdays racist remarks again. How many racist things does he have to say to make people realize he is the racist person on earth. He will not help the black community and has not in 40 years. Trump has done more than any President to help all people.
Jobs Joe Biden is currently qualified for: Sweet Tea Magnate Breakfast Sausage spokesman Walmart greeter Dairy farmer (handsy)  Commissioner of major league baseball Mayor of North Pole amusement park Front Desk/doorman for NY high rise apartment building
Your campaign is sliding into the swamp. Your attack on Joe Biden's faith is not only wrong, but stupid. The one without faith is YOU.  You embody EVERY SINGLE ONE of the 7 Deadly Sins - look them up. You will recognize yourself.
Coronavirus US: death toll tops 160,000 as relief package impasse continues – live
Biden really keeps working so hard to lose my vote, the commitment is frankly impressive.
Wouldn't the "Nazi" be Biden? I mean he's the one that gave a eulogy at an Exalted Cyclops of the KKK funeral.
Conjecture: Dems get Kamala Harris or other "in-pocket" Democrat as running mate, pull bait-and-switch with Biden for health reasons post convention. No Yang, no Sanders. Dems are a hard no on both, which should terrify reasonable young liberals who are "solution focused."
Joe Biden is NOT the agent of change this country desperately needs. He’s there to serve as a vessel for financial and structural stability for the 1%

After thinking about Joe Biden and watching him now for over a year as a candidate, (as an independent voter), I just can't believe that he is the Democratic candidate for President. Seriously, is there someone waiting in the wings to swoop in or a 25th amendment strategy?
Today I learned that if you don't like Joe Biden you're a Trump supporter.
It is Aug 7th and Biden is the most racist person on earth.
Good grief
This is why my original ? was to the Good Dr and NOT his BEEHIVE.  I don't call anyone coons for thinking this way.  I AGREE with A LOT of IT.  I know about the party switch in early 1900s i.e. Southern strategy.  I am aware of policing records of Biden/Harris.  ? was RIGHT NOW.
1. It's faking a stock market comeback right before an election 2. It sets up for the market to totally crash right after Biden wins, falsely putting the blame on Dems 3. It allows Feds to sell corp bonds to foreign powers allowing them to own large amounts of U.S. businesses
Oh, yeah. By noon I'll be a communist, a racist, pro Biden, pro Trump, a patriot, a traitor, fkng incredible.
I did it for Garth Brooks tickets, I can do it for Joe Biden.
RIGHT???  Like goddammit at this point we were promised Joe Biden the One-Winged Angel and I was so ready to vote for the hottest president ever and this is what we get?
What Joe Biden thinks about Black Americans is 'offensive and gross,' says Iraq veteran  #FoxNews
Evaluating Joe as a Presidential possibility, but having a hard time being convinced he is a viable candidate. For example, Joe Biden's public statements questioned by the media in past presidential campaigns.
He wasn't trailing Biden for the last 3 years
I love how every time Tr*mp makes shit up about Biden, it makes Biden sound cooler.   Like only in my wildest dreams could I actually vote for someone who would throw all guns into a volcano, turn us into a socialist paradise, and destroy god.
Trump re-election strategies (2020): •They’re all socialists! 👎  •Bidens are corrupt 👎 •Economy is unbeatable 👎 •COVID is Dem hoax 👎 •Uh, we’ll fix economy 👎 •Uh, we beat COVID 👎 •Law &amp; Order 👎 •Antifa’s coming 👎 •Biden is weak 👎 •Biden will take away God 🙄
Sadly, I must agree with JVL.  All of machinery and chicanery of Trumpism will still be in place once Biden is elected, unfettered by the need to even appear to be governing.   Trump unleashed, unbound, unrepentant.
He apologized immediately and it wasn't his point. Biden will say some stupid things from time to time but he's not a racist corrupt compulsive liar and he'll apologize when he says something stupid. You won't get that from the other side.
"West, who has previously voiced support for Mr Trump and is running as an independent, was named on the Colorado ballot on Thursday, the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office confirmed. At least one Republican official assisted West with his filing"
"When it was pointed out to West that it was unlikely he could win November’s poll, and that his campaign was being run as a distraction, he replied: “I’m not going to argue with you. Jesus is King.'"
Last night I kept dreaming about which bumper sticker would be catchier: Biden + Bass or Biden + Harris. Then I hit on Joe and Sue.  I could never make the choice.
I think that Biden's biggest problem is that he has so many great candidates to choose from. Trump, on the other hand, only has one requirement: "Are you loyal to me?"
When I first heard Trump's comments, I thought Biden said something really terrible. What Biden really said, when you come down to it, is that the Black community is more organized than the Latino community. After all, Blacks have been fighting these battles for generations.
The harder the Dems surge left, the more I hear voting Trump. Seems like more to block Biden/socialism than pro-Trump. I live in a major swing state.....
isn't it really funny that Trump supporters are calling out Biden's  microaggressions? a concept they typically drill the left for creating, all while supporting a man known for his macroaggressions... #fucktrump
You'll never see Biden asked -&gt; Why Is Joe Biden Silent on the Attacks Against Catholic Statues, Churches, and Beliefs?
Biden says he would stop border wall construction if elected president  via  #COVID19 #Mexico #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVirusUpdates
I can't wait for the debates. I hope biden doesn't chicken out. I really want to hear both sides.
third party candidates and write-ins. A case might be made for Biden, though I'd probably disagree with it, given his abortion politics.   My editors have a more nuanced discussion about it in this podcast:   I've found Twitter, due to brevity, lacks nuance
Have you shown your father half as much interest in his medical care that you have shown Biden? I know you are kind of the ignored one because you don't have his name &amp; you don't have a vagina, but that reality that you don't SEE your father's brain is rotten fruit is glaring.
So yesterday, a group of women leaders and organizations wrote a letter and sent it out to top news executives.  The purpose: A warning to avoid "stereotypes and tropes" in coverage around Joe Biden's VP pick.  Outlining specific traps the media fall into.  Offering assistance.
"Trump says the only way he can lose is through election fraud. In fact, it seems more likely that the only way he can win is through fraud."
Joe Biden is a devout catholic and regularly attends Sunday service.   The last time Trump went to church, he gassed peaceful Americans.
"Biden has offered voters a steady rollout of plans to solve big problems &amp; with a heavy dose of decency &amp; respect.  His climate agenda is truly bold. He says he wants to be a “transformational” president, not just transitional. He will follow science"   a/l/a "everybody VOTES."
Joe Biden is a devout catholic and regularly attends Sunday service.   The last time Trump went to church, he gassed peaceful Americans.
If Biden doesn't make a GRAND GESTURE to the left soon, he's going to lose to Trump.  BIG Like picking a Bernie Bro for VP, or supporting M4A  Otherwise, too many voters like me will stay home.
Joe Biden is a devout catholic and regularly attends Sunday service.   The last time Trump went to church, he gassed peaceful Americans.
I think you lump all Hispanics into one pot.  You lack Comprehension of the widely DIFFERING POLITICS of different Latinx Ppl.  Diversity b/t Cubans and Arizona or California Mexicans or Salvadoreans or S America.  Biden knows what he is talking about—YOU DON’T IGNORANT FOOL.
The idea that Kanye should suspend his mental illness long enough for Biden to get elected is ridiculous. The run is the disease.
Of course they do, they're losing...BAD! - Trump campaign wants presidential debates with Joe Biden early and often  via
For those in despair, read this article:
Attempt?   “And by the way, what you all know, but most people don’t, unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”   —Joe Biden
Nope, I know some folks of the conservative persuasion who would never vote for a "crazy commie" like Biden, who also won’t vote for Trump. Their vote for a 3rd party candidate is still a vote against Trump.
Ok Christians....explain to me how Biden is going to "hurt" God...but apparently has no beef with Jesus...?
Kanye late to the party lol but people mad at him for interference because Biden cant hold his own is funny
Ok... that’s a personal problem. I’m not for Biden, I’m voting to remove an existential threat from the White House. Biden at least has a very decent public platform that I can mostly get behind, and I trust him to put intelligent progressive people in positions of power.
. : Be Very Careful About Biden's Lead on Trump -- he joins  to discuss  the second coronavirus stimulus package and the upcoming Presidential election.
Trump's accusation that Biden is against God and wants to hurt God keeps making me think of the lyrics from Woody Guthrie's very subtle Mean Talking Blues:   "I hated union everywhere, 'cause God likes unions and I hate God!"
Yesterday's state polls by Quinnipiac and Data for Progress are all broadly consistent with Biden leading nationally by ~7-10 points... except the Quinnipiac poll of Kentucky, which has Trump only +9. You'd expect him to be up by 22% there if he's down 10% nationally. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
No one would do what you've done!  Competent presidents would have nipped this in the bud in December of last year.  They wouldn't ignore everything around them for months.  I've been working from home in March and I don't see any end it sight -- until President Biden!
I guess Biden should pick Betty White

Trump Campaign Busted For Deceptively Manipulating Biden Photos In New Ad | HuffPostWhy are Biden's gaffs held to a real presidential standard and Trump's gaffs ignored /memed /excused / laughed at? Says a lot about who we think is actually presidential/
No way Biden wins in a fair election.  If Biden wins then the elites have successfully taken over elections and power.  You’ll never see a GOP President or Congress again and the USA as founded is finished.
So tell me one thing that Joe Biden has done in 40 years besides getting rich off America
I'm already voting for Biden, but it is things like this that solidify that for me.
“Unlike the African American community, the Latino community is very diverse.”   -Joe Biden
Which reporters are now having to look into Biden’s ability to hurt #God? Heaven historically takes forever with FOIA requests.
I saw an ad for Joe Biden and was all like, What's Joe the nickname for? Joe-ithy? I need to go to bed...🥴
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity   Idiot!
Will Joe Biden Be Able to Terminate the 1031 Exchange?  via
No Joe Biden has no stamina no brain power For that office
White supremacy looks like the president’s allies helping Kanye get on the ballot to get black people to vote for him instead of Biden.  White people using black people to control black people for the benefit of white people.
Last night I listened to a Democrat Congressman brag about Biden and I just don’t understand how anyone in their right mind  would have the slightest inkling for supporting this idiot
The final 2? Biden confidants see VP choices narrowing to Kamala Harris and Susan Rice

Oh but you would rather trust Schumer, Pelosi, Biden that have not done jack shit in 40 plus years but blow smoke up your naive democrat asses
Sorry dude, it’s your dad with his brain spiraling into full dementia we have to worry about. Biden is fine.
Are you sure Biden is the only terrible speaker? You can’t even pronounce a National Park that you “saved”. GTFO with that 💩
⁦ ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ Just so you guys know; so would I! Enough of the disorganized chaos!
If Biden wins, that's exactly what the Republicans will do. And their "claim" would be right, even though they've proven for four years that they couldn't care less.
1. You're absolutely right about Scavino. 2. We all know it's not Biden himself who's tweeting. 3. No one but die-hard Trumpers care that it's not Biden. 4. Greg knows all this, but he's made it his job to toss red meat the MAGA crowd.
And  at least they're women he's talking about, not little girls like Biden seems to have a fancy for.
A simple but effective message that will resonate with voters who are desperately looking for leadership during this crisis, but finding mostly reality-show drama. (And yes, I know it wasn't Biden who tweeted this).
If we had to accept 45* as president then you better support Biden as one! Get your head out of the sand and start doing what you were elected to do. Not once has the GOP reached across the aisle!!!
I think we've known all along that it's some campaign staffer who's been tweeting for Biden. I don't think it's because of dementia, but rather that Biden has no interest in, nor understanding of, social media. And I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing.
Because he is the only one with common sense and doesn’t blow smoke up our asses like Biden has for 40 plus years
Joe Biden won't even know who he picked I will not allow the media to continues its assault on Trump I will call out any Democrat for hates speech and intolerance of other's ideas Election is the life and death of this great Republic as we know it people choice socialism/freedom
how is it Biden’s fault while 45* screwed it up (further) with his so-called trade war failed experiment with tariffs that the consumer had to end up paying for?How about the trademarks tRumps scored?   Is it ignorance or plain stupidity that supports 45*?
Technically speaking you’re the great do-nothing leader as you’re the president. Biden is just a candidate right now.
Biden is just as bad as Trump. Please go look into Jo Jorgensen.
Trump and Biden are both terrible. Lol.
Tell the truth now, is anyone reading these inside baseball-political analysis stories about who should or should not be Biden's VP pick?
So, my mom told me that one of her sisters (Who, along with her husband and son, are the only Trumpy supporters in our family), thought my grandma was being brainwashed by my other aunt, because my Grandma is voting for Biden... At least my dad is slowing turning away from Trumpy
Her record, leadership and vision will be enough to ruin Biden and herself.
Want me to spell it out? I'm MtF, autistic and with an encroaching physical disability in my spine. If you accelerationists keep Biden out, I die either in the streets or in a prison camp.
Either vote for Biden/Harris or STFU and leave!

Melania secretly votes for Biden.
Can’t wait to see you on January 20th, 2021. Looking forward to seeing you get forced out of the White House to make room for President Biden and Vice President Harris!
I think this ad makes Biden look even better. He’s actually working for the American people. You’re probably on the train with Stormy Daniels while America dies from COVID.
Look, Biden has already addressed his issues with inappropriate touching, so let's not start in with the whole "thigh land" thing again...  Yes, he didn't apologize or DO anything remotely like ACTUALLY addressing it, but... I mean, there were fragments of... he didn't...  *sigh*
Need I even bring up that Trump supporters are more likely than Biden or Bernie supporters to have dropped out of highschool or not have a college degree??? No?? Ok😌
If we settle for Biden and get justice for the POC lives lost to police brutality - get this - the riots would end😃
Your solution to Biden's VP problem would have been Tulsi. Literally the only area where her thoughts vary from Trump's is that she'd nationalise every business with more than 35 employees. Her foreign policy would, if anything, be MORE isolationist.

lol the dnc is fucking stupid fuck biden/harris
Except that Joe Biden is the point at which they abandoned pretending to be interested in incrementing and just said “fuck the pleebs, they’ll do what they’re told.”
Why do you think he picked Harris she is as dirty as Biden
Democratic Party sets rules for criticizing Biden's VP pick Kamala Harris Hillary Clinton and Valerie Jarrett operatives sign a missive that warns what media message must be
These speeches gave me, a nasty suburban housewife, hope that this country can come back from the brink of ruin caused by trump. Biden and Harris are smart and empathetic and can speak in full sentences. They understand democracy. #BidenHarris
Tears in my eyes listening to  For the first time in over 3 years, I have hope. I am ready to get to work for VP Biden and  #BidenHarris2020  #Biden2020 #KamalaHarrisVP
Joe Biden was introduced to Harris by his son Hunter what does that tell you 😳
Probably not unemployed. I'd put money on it she won't give up her Senate seat unless Biden wins.
They don’t mind Trump’s ethics at all. Biden makes them liars and hypocrites on every single point they’ve criticized Trump on.  They object to the aesthetics of Covfve. The bits where they talk about ethics are pretexts that disguise that.
The Steffan Tubbs Show is at News/Talk 710KNUS. Aurora ·  After careful debate (none) we've decided it'll be known as the "Harris/Biden" ticket on the program..
Voting for Biden and stumping for him on Twitter *is* being a Biden Bro. That bit where you’re saying “Oh, but in my HEART I’m doing this WITH RESERVATIONS”?  Doesn’t matter, because it has no effect on the wotld around you. It’s just a way to blame your own cowardice on others.
I oppose fracking as well. So, good news! Thanks for making sure that I vote against you, while voting for Biden/Kamala.
Definitely possible. The other explanation is that Tobin feels that Biden shouldn't just BE excommunicated (likely for being pro-choice), but actually already IS.
Woot woot!!! So excited for this Biden/ Harris ticket. #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP #RidinWithBiden
They're still convinced that Biden will forestall armed revolution while the thought of Trump running the country for at least four more years will force it before 20 Jan. They don't take into account the Trumpstapo can ALREADY stymie all armed revolution, just like in Germany.
I will remind you again that I am a woman who lives in the suburbs and I am voting for Biden /Harris. I welcome affordable housing. #BidenHarris2020
The comical thing is that they are running with the attack that Biden and Harris are “far left liberals” (which is how they would have attacked any ticket).  If they truly think Biden is “far left” (which they don’t...just scare tactics) - whooo boy.
Val, You have demonstrated that you are one of the elite young leaders in the Democratic Party. Joe Biden was fortunate to be able to include you on his short list of VP candidates. Please keep up the wonderful work you are doing on behalf of your constituents and all Americans!
And yet he endorses a candidate who’s made waves standing directly against precisely this. Joe Biden sees Obamacare in the way that American racists see statues of Confederate generals: as a transcendental symbol that must be preserved at any cost at all.
I asked for this ticket the day Biden locked up the nomination!
I mean, the whole point of a Biden campaign is to ignore all of the facts about his history while pretending at the same time that the Dems weren’t deeply contemptuous of Republicans saying precisely this about Trump on 2016.
What happened to you?  Are you in the same stage of dementia as Biden?
But hey, way to once again avoid saying anything positive at all about Biden.   I mean, since there’s literally nothing good to say about him, you go straight for sneering at what you think my “real motivations are.”  True to form for Biden Bros: go straight gor the ad hominem.
Dude.   Joe Biden already is a victory for the right. He hands them everything they’ve wanted for fifty years.   That belief you have that he’s substantively different from Trump in literally any way at all? That’s an article of religious faith totally undupported by evidence.
Biden/Harris 2020!! I love it!!!!
Welp, no surprise on the Biden front today. The entirety of his policy positions for fifty years has been MORE COPS.
Biden sniffed.....sorry,  I meant picked, Harris for Running Mate.  Excuse the expression.
I swear to god Joe Biden is gonna drop dead from being a wrinkly old fuck within 3 months of being inaugurated, and then we'll be stuck with the cop nobody wanted to begin with
Is Biden too sleepy to do it?
how I'm sleeping knowing that Biden lost my vote for picking Harris as VP
kamala harris is a cop and joe biden is a pedophile. but do you really want the homophobic and the racist rapist in office instead? no. vote blue.
People really think Biden boutta win the election
Shortly after the news broke, President Trump posted a video ad on Twitter attacking Harris as a "phony" and Biden as "not that smart" for picking her.
Musing:  An interesting choice!  She's young which could take some of the load off of Biden because she could do travels and political things he may not have the energy to do!
Kamala Harris is Biden's VP. Are you as surprised as him when he found out? Kamala Harris 'identifies' as African American and considers her experience to be American even tho her mother is from India, and her father is from Jamaica.
Representative - did you hear one of her (Kamala Harris) accounts had unfollowed the Bidens' campaign account yesterday?  Plus to some young people if she was chosen, Biden may not get their support bc Kamala has done some questionable actions while an attorney in Cali.
You have to vote against Trump.   This is not about getting Biden elected it is about getting Trump out.  Foolish emotional responses are not necessary
Biden is a puppet for Clinton and Obama
By October 1 latest, Biden should announce his entire cabinet and the next 100 high-level appointments (major ambassadors, 2nd-level cabinet, etc.) as well as provide his detailed plan to clean out Trump's mess: ID and remove appointments, reverse EOs, and rebuild ally relations.
If you really care about the environment and sustainability and green energy you should vote for Biden. Anything else is a vote for trump. I suspect you know this and are an attention seeker.
I am Biden all the way, even if he picks an ear of corn ❤️
But NO.  Its wrong. Its not about who's doing it, its about the unprecedented and dangerous expansion of executive  power that it represents. I hope that Biden doesn't do the same thing, regardless of whether I'd agree with the outcome.
I mean, Biden Bros couldn’t debunk their way out of a creationist science fest, but there you have it.
Read something other than what CNN feeds you... Trump has done more for the black community than Obama/Biden even considered. How is Trump killing all these people? Specific examples please.
Sup? Shes my pick for VP. There’s nobody better to tackle the current race relations and criminal justice reform. I like that she pushed back on Biden in the debates but supports him when she agrees. Trying not to get my hopes up too much though.
Which is why a bunch of elderly, comparatively rich people would rather shove  down your throat like Joe Biden accidentally left alone with an intern then they would actually fight for the values that The Democrats used to pretend they stand for.
I really don’t understand their point of view. They want more socialist policies but don’t realize the Biden is a lot closer than Trump in this direction. I feel like they don’t realize what they want and how to dissect a political agenda.
Also, don’t get me wrong, your tweet a week or so ago about Biden’s ‘94 crime law resonated with me. When it comes to race relations they both have an abysmal record. I believe Biden is a step in the right direction but also don’t blame you if you disagree.
It was difficult for me to go to grad school because I was already in too much debt. Trump wants to eliminate subsidized loans and public service debt forgiveness making it harder on undergrad. The 15k from Biden would go a long way for undergrad, if it goes through.
I think Biden is a step in the right direction. His plan helps the middle class students more than Trump. I think his platform on education will make it easier for another politician along the lines of Bernie to take it even further.
If you’re serious about getting rid of Trump then it requires supporting Biden for this election.  After that, I don’t think any democrat expects you or the project lincoln folks to be permanent members of the party.

So every time don Jr says something dumb we have to comment on Biden’s children? That makes no sense.
If Biden wins and she is the VP please someone take one for the team
And yet, your vote depends on Biden’s VP pick.. sigh
“Joe Biden is a racist, no man can stand for one color in society” 😘
Biden does not need Kentucky, Trump does.
Why a question of who you will vote for? Biden was a friend of your fathers. Yes they disagreed on issues but both men were full of integrity and honor.  continually puts your late great father down with despicable comments. Megan this should be a no brainer!!
I will absolutely vote for Biden as long as he offers to kick god right in the teeth
Thanks to Cory Gardner's ex worker....they just can't win honestly. They think a mentally ill singer will drain Biden of the Black vote.
In spite of his leadership—or lack there of—Would be great if President Biden starts his administration with this in place...But given Trumps history of lies, I highly doubt it.
Are they trying to make me like Biden MORE?
Biden Narrows Running Mate Finalist List To Two - Report
If Biden is elected and has to deal with these countries that are hostile with the US, how will he handle that?  Will he just get mad and call them names like he does to his own supporters? Or will his anger get our country into trouble? War? Animosity?
What a surprise...Republicans, with Cory Gardner playing dirty tricks with our election!!  If you can’t win honestly YOU CHEAT!  Black Americans won’t leave Biden in droves and vote for a mentally ill singer!Correction: BLM single handedly donates $48MM to Biden's campaign
While I agree that "Blue No Matter Who" in the presidential race is important, being hostile towards people with legitimate concerns about Biden/Harris isn't going to get them on your side.
I won’t survive it. 😥😥😥. Biden and Harris will win. We will vote even if we have to walk over hot coals or broken glass in our bare feet. We will vote and we will get rid of these criminals!
...and their union with 300,000 members just endorsed #Biden
Oh, I don't just mean interjecting on on political opinions, I mean potentially holding an office in the Biden Administration. Clinton and Biden go back a long way politically.

Cool. But how many Trumpers or undecided voters are gonna go "hmm 🤔 you know I never really paid attention to facts before, but now that this Black/Asian-American woman is saying those facts &amp; telling me Mike Pence is wrong, I'm gonna vote for Biden!"
I love the  ads.  has set the bar so low that all Biden has to do is wear a mask and promise to listen to the experts. #ByeDon2020
My names joe biden and...c'mon man. I thought you liked me. #MyCampaignSlogan
Yeah. This part ☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻? TRump’s head would literally explode. In a cloud of partially chewed Big-Macs and KFC. Never👏🏻Gonna👏🏻Happen👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻...until Biden can give this speech😏
If Biden wins every state carried by Hilary and re takes PA, MI and WI then game is over
Possible that if you asked Biden about this he wouldn't remember saying it, but it's still really dark and disturbing
You might want to get used to hearing the Clinton name. With Biden potentially winning the Presidency, there is also the potential that Hillary Clinton will re-enter the political arena in some form or another.  Not to bait a rabbit mob responding. but there is the possibility.
Yeah some lawyer nobody has ever even heard of getting a soft slap on the wrist. Hopefully I'm wrong about that outcome. If that is the outcome, Republican Party is dead as dead gets. Deader than Biden. Burnt toast 🔥🔥🔥
I’m not excited about a Biden Harris ticket. And I think people and survivors specifically have their very legitimate reasons for not voting for them. But if Angela Davis can settle for this ticket then so can I. Get in the car girls, we’re settling 🥴
Hunter Biden
Republicans are so scared of a barely moderately-to-the-left Joe Biden that they are willing to dismantle the constitutionally-mandated  to win, and on top of that if we lived in a country that made sense, their party would be disbanded as a punishment.
Thank you Mitch! Now PLEASE, vote for Biden- not your wife! PLEASE!!!!!!
Over thirty million people protested this summer and yet the president could not fill an arena in Oklahoma. Not to dismiss the issue or anything, but I would tend to think Biden turnout will probably still be decisive.
Hey Jimmy, when are you clowns going to Q&amp;A Biden/Harris?
When someone offers to save you from a burning building you take their hand. Joe Biden is the hand.
"Didn’t Barr announce neither Obama or Biden are under investigation?"  you mean like when Comey said publicly and lied under oath that Trump wasn't under investigation??? and the entire time they were illegally spying on him 🤔
fake obstruction charges doesn't change what Obama did or the truth that's slowly getting declassified bit by bit  Barr won't announce charges against Obama and Biden until after some of the other big fish get fried anyway  today is just the tip of the iceberg  enjoy the show🤣
If Biden wins the entire investigation will be buried forever  #Hannity
If Biden is sinking...then what do you call Trump as thousands of Americans die and more go unemployed?
Where the fuck is  Thought he was going to help Biden get elected?
So much for unity on your part. This is divisive and narcissistic performative nonsense at a time when Democrats should be united behind the nominee, Joe Biden. You should be ashamed of yourself acting like a mere pedestrian on social media.
Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
The latest   / Marist poll found Joe Biden 11 points ahead of Donald Trump:
🤮🤮🤮If anyone is going to destroy our democracy its Biden and Harris!
Stop shaming people who will vote for Biden/harris. I don't want to but I know they will bend to the will of the people because their history shows it. If you don't vote then you truly are giving up and allowing people to due needlessly.  these retweets are dense.
this is a Harris-Biden team, Not a Biden-Harris team #Hannity
Yeah ask Nancy she’s a Catholic and so is Biden!
But if you don't vote then you don't get the chance to have the protests and the movement matter. Trump will never budge or change anything. But Biden/harris will have to bend to the will of the people. If history shows anything its that they do bend when it comes down to it.
Biden should not agree to debate unless a fact chk is done about every statement
If Biden was still with it I imagine he’d be pretty pissed off at whoever is writing lie after lie on his Twitter.
If Harris gets elected then I wonder if they move Biden's basement to the White House fixing to be called the Black House or move the now called Black House to Biden's basement? Just asking. lol
The USCCB said that a staffer who told the bishops’ news service she was elated that Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate spoke in a personal capacity.  The conference did not address the substance of her remarks.
Joe Biden doesn’t deserve to be President! He’s a moose knuckled tater tosser!
Ya think they had a choice? 4 more years of a lunatic or Biden!
Biden is the biggest racist on earth. Harris is the biggest fake on earth. She now thinks she is black if that gets her in power.
well, he probably didn’t pick her. The DNC picked her and then told Biden that he picked her. He knows that he can’t remember anything, so he believed them and ran with it.
So in other words they are going to censure conservative videos if they say anything about 'Baffoon' Biden or 'Lot Lizard' Harris.
Again, hope I'm wrong, but mark my words-- Biden wont be any better. In fact he'll be just as bad. And if something happens to him and Kamala becomes president? I'd expect the same fash actions as trump's regime.  I really want to be wrong : /
We do not need leaders like this. Our young people my grandkids need adults as leaders.
And Biden is somehow even less progressive than Obama. And Kamala is a fucking cop. She would rather incarcerate innocent people to let them fight fires for free than let them live their lives freely. They arent agents of change. If I am wrong Ill GLADLY eat my words.
Like Im gonna vote for biden/harris but it doesnt matter in the end, theyre still gonna bomb foreign nations most of our country will never see or be aware of, kill our own people, and subvert progress for profit. Climate change will kill us before we get anywhere
We couldn’t even hold Obama accountable, and mf’s out here pretending like we’re going to somehow hold Joe Biden to a higher standard lmao
How could this possible be a conflict of interest?  Wink! Wink! look over here there is nothing wrong with #MailInVoting #MailInBallotFraud
#Tucker it is not "the Biden-Harris team", it is "the Harris-Biden team"
Biden who?
people like "stop badmouthing kamala and biden, we need democrats even if its just baby step changes for the better!!" lmao bitches the world wont survive any more incremental change, this is beyond the time for dramatic and massive change or we will die as a species but ok mb
Have u all noticed a lot of ads for Biden and not one for Trump on this platform? Trump got Twittergated and we know it. Indictments are coming. I believe the report is complete and getting plenty of popcorn and lots of beers. lol
Y’all bout to go vote for Biden . Him and Kamala more racist than trump 🤦🏾‍♂️
The legislature would change that and they have a veto proof majority. This was discussed at length when Warren was being considered for VP. It will be a non issue if Biden wants her in his cabinet, as it would have had she been chosen.
Yes please. Let’s vote him out. Biden has members of Sunrise on his team at the very least.
Hannity will be whining this guys name like Uranium One. All through the Biden administration. Unlike with trumps friends, he will likely face punishment, and serve his time if convicted.
Biden wasn’t the best pick given the field of candidates. But, he’s the only alternative to Trump.
I don’t support any of these people in any way whatsoever, but, umm, I’m pretty sure Lenin, Mao, etc would be laying the groundwork for a revolution, not endorsing Biden 😂😂
You are no more aware than Biden.
Like we’re prospering now? Get the fuck outta here!!  #Biden-Harris2020
I would crawl through a prison sewer like Andy Dufresne at Shawshank to vote for Biden/Harris
Not a Biden sign.
Well I’m not going to defend Biden. Why the democrats chose an old white guy is beyond me, but even with his weaknesses he’s still several times better than this incompetent President.
Yeah but I think we are getting better. I am a little weary of them cause if do win will want conservative policies but nice helping Biden win.
Kamala Harris probably won't be a loud voice advocating for legalization, but she can reassure Joe Biden about the California experience. It's gonna be okay, Joe. Legalization works.  by  #CannabisCulture #CannabisSociety #ColoradoCannabis
What does she care? She’s not running for office or is she? Maybe she has been offered a seat on the Biden Harris Cabinet of Undetected or Unpunishable Crime.

Few steps forward followed by miles in reverse... 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Yet you’re voting for Biden simply because he’s a democrat... please
Doing nothing and a watching it happen is just as bad as doing it. Trump is bad, but Biden is right there neck for neck
Huh? What’s that even mean? You contantly teeet about Biden, so....?
Biden would have no response. No response is the same as a bad response. Biden was missing for like 6 weeks of his campaign and you somehow think that makes a promising presidency 🤔 seriously questioning your logic
If I were Biden I would hire this dude and spray paint “New World Order” on the front...
Oo we got vocab now! Literally everything on that little list you made Biden has said he will make no change to. I don’t get where you think he will do anything better. He has said numerous times he will change nothing
I always hope so, but does it actually?   And though I hate voting for the lesser of two evils, I’m afraid to not vote for Biden becuas trump has got to go!
Say one is better (between trump and Biden) than the other makes me question your ethics. They are the same. To sit there and ask me “what would you rather have - the same shit for 4 years in red or the same shit for 8 but in blue??” Of course I’ll pick the 4 years
Corporate news works for the same donors as the ones donating to Trump.  Corporate news might be happier w/ Trump, juicier stories. Biden will be boring at best.
I don’t think anybody is worried California won’t go for Biden. More worried about Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina ...
Biden / Harris is the Fakest ticket I have ever seen. Totally propped up by media
No. But I have at least 2 close friends, not trumplicans, who are refusing to vote for Biden. It's...insane. And I've told both of them that. 🤷‍♀️
Isn't that Biden's argument?
To EVERYONE - if you want to keep your Post Office better vote Biden
I think you and I disagree on Trump and Biden and the legitimacy of Catholic's voting for one or the other. I do appreciate you fighting against racism. Come to Denver and let's grab a beer.
Trump supporters tell me a third party vote helps Biden. So, which is it?
Yeah and some of his takes are pretty decent (only watched like 5 or 6 vids kuz they long). Today is him saying lenin would vote for biden was a special kind of silly 😜
Biden seems to have done fine. A distinguished congressional career spanning decades. Well respected VP, both in the United States and abroad. Presidential candidate. Soon to be president. And he’s a good and decent man. Yep - Joe’s done alright... #BidenHarris2020
Beau Biden did not have to go to Iraq. He was DE Atty Gen'l. Bob Mueller is a decorated Vietnam vet. If you vote for a coward, you might as well be one yourself.
Clearly messing with mail-in-ballots is the real issue, but I Trump is also sabotaging the mail to prevent by Biden Harris T-shirt from getting here promptly.
I hate Harris so much, I'll never vote for Biden.  This week I realized Trump can win again.  I see the stupid Obama-Clinton   running the same failed campaign as in 2016.   #NeverKamala
I know republicans don’t believe in polls, for good reason, but there are strong indications that it’s gonna be a landslide win for democrats. I’d rather be Biden in the lead by 11 than Trump down by that much. You can only pull off so many miracles when you don’t believe n Jesus
The tRump scum, bag man, that is heading up the USPS should be charged with election fraud by the Biden Administration
Everyone except me? I ALONE!!  I watched interview clip and an interview w/ Barnet. I think the “are you a junkie?” question was a continuation of his hypothetical. But, I like Biden. You have your preference. I have mine. The original post was on trump’s lies not Biden’s brain.
The Simpsons say VOTE FOR BIDEN
Joe Biden lying again... what a shock.
It was a solid press conference, now let’s have the Biden team answer some unscripted questions
The Dems were asking people to vote woke three times in a row, and since the economy wasn't tanking anymore, in 2016 the voters could react. This time a Biden/Harris vote is only about 1/3 woke. People can handle that.
Biden's campaign was in the toilet without any electors &amp; then Obama &amp; the DNC stepped in. I didn't like him in '88 &amp; I still don't.

Ever seen a Biden yard sign?   Yea me neither.
Look at the little CNN, MSNBC puppets...no questions for Biden or the other one.
Nixon was more liberal than Obama, and president my boss was more liberal than biden...
Defeating trump and letting Biden become President for 8 years is an equal if not greater threat because it’s more long term. I don’t get what you’re not getting
It's temporary and who's wishlist is UBI on?   During primary the Democrats HATED the idea of UBI.  The liberal media literally ignored him, called him wrong name, showed pictures of random Asian guy claiming he was Yang.  If UBI was on wishlist Yang would be nom, not Biden.
I saw a Biden 2020 thin blue line sign today in someone’s front yard.  I almost crashed my truck

Joe Biden is not fit to be president..he hides in the basement and all you idiot's speak for him. You are just using his name with the help of his wife..you should be ashamed of yourself. Talking about Bo...the one thing he has left to remember and you used it.
Biden and Harris our coming for our guns while calling for refunding the police. I'm out, Trump it is.
I'm being an adult and not voting for Biden.
How am I toxic for responding to your claim?   Also, I’m not a Bernie Bro, but a registered independent.   Like most independents, I don’t like the choices, but between Biden and Trump, the choice is obvious.
Would a dog wear pants like this? (Trump) Or like this? (Biden)
Biden gave us Clarence Thomas 🙃
Yup and Harris will take over if elected and Palosi will be VP.Biden will probably announce his retirement on Jan. lol.
What it really sounds like is you are voting for Biden, and I don't like neoliberals!

Biden was VP for eight years and has spent his life in Congress. He knows the countries. He had a press release yesterday naming them and the limitations of the deal Trump "negotiated."
Seriously Biden has to dial this back or Trump will crush him and idiot libs won’t understand why.
lol when did Biden say he would be one term lololol I swear
Perhaps why they’re having so much trouble framing Biden...not your typical “liberal elite”, so the canned attacks fall flat.
Biden and Harris actually know what their doing
#thanksobama and yes Joe Biden will be the fist President to rebuild a better economy for a second after being being VP when it was done the 1st time! All trump has done is ride on Obama's coattails and try to take credit for the things Obama has already done.. trump is a loser
It's not about beating Trump, it's about UHC, jobs, housing, and peace. Biden-Harris have nothing to do any of these. The party needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.

Of course, the odds right before the election more closely reflect polling average, where the odds now factor in three months of uncertainty. Bush in 2000 squandered a bigger August lead than Biden's.
But to point out the obvious. If he does not concede, his followers will stand behind him. Many of them have guns. Most, probably. They also make up the majority of LEOs, military, secret service, etc. It could take more than just "swearing in Biden" for transfer of the office.
even the vaccines not a cure dumbass 😂 so please put your plastic bag on your head and sit the fuck down 😂 yeah.. and you think Trump is going to be out of office in November? Biden had no chance even before he chose Kumswallah Harris as his running mate 😂 now it's a

Venture way -- way -- behind the BFF bonhomie between #Biden and #Obama in this excellent  trip thru their complex friendship and the affiliated fault lines.  And yeah, Alex also gets big points for "BFF bonhomie"
If the race does not start to tighten in the coming months, will the forecast start to favor Biden more? I’d like to hear Nate’s thought about that.
Awesome. 832 days till Biden's retirement party.
I love how Trump bashes Biden for not taking questions, yet Trump might take the question but not answer it.
Dude. You’re funny. Biden can barely function. Trump is the only one that can get it DONE
I would like to see a #Biden campaign ad that is just a compilation of  gutting Trump officials during hearings. #BidenHarris2020
Biden trying to take credit. Why?
Biden does not like Harris and Harris does not like Biden. It was obvious 3 days ago. He can't even operate his phone cause it was upside down. It is a disgrace and a sham show.
Trump gets tough questions from the media, Biden has not been asked one tough question yet. Biden tries to take credit for the mid east peace talks and how does that happen when he has been in the basement forever. Unbelievable. And the Dems think he can win that way.
As the article notes: "If the court agrees, that could increase the likelihood that the results of the presidential race between President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden won’t be known for days after the election."
Come on, you gotta admit there is nothing exciting about Biden. And Camel Toe was so exciting she finished last in the primaries and one of the first to drop out.  The Democrats didn’t even like her 🤣🤣🤣
Yes I’m going to vote for Biden/Harris because I live in a swing state. Yes I think it’s incontrovertibly true that they have used their careers to make the world a worse place and they both deserve the wall. Yes I think voting for them makes me complicit in doing evil.
I can't...had to stop watching...nothing but lies, lies and more lies...I am so frustrated...I was so happy when Biden announced Harris....I hate this motherf*cking rollercoaster ride....😟😟😟
"The Election of 1800" for    &amp; other #NeverTrump /  folks  🎵 I have never agreed with [Democrats] once We have fought on like 75 different fronts But when all is said and all is done [Biden] has beliefs; [Trump] has none 🎵
The only people attracted to the Left are BLM and Antifa sympathizers. Biden has lost the moderates and swing votes and maybe even the black vote.  It’s already over. We didn’t believe the fake news in 2016 so why would we believe them now.
It is about my rights! Joe Biden is a civilian, just like me. He's not a policy maker, just like me. Fear mongering &amp; stepping on my toes to move his agenda is 100% about my rights. I comply with wearing a mask inside if I am going to be within 6 feet of others but not outside!
get in the same boat with the rest of us, and let's row back to shore, because we are way out in the deep end with no captain. vote for Biden/Harris because at least they aren't criminals should be their 2020 campaign tag line.
You know they won’t. Only cover for cowering Biden the fool. The media is dead and it’s just all Yellow Journalism.
And you think Biden will open pandoras box in allowing previous presidents to be imprisoned???? Every living president deserves to be in jail, including president "my boss"...
So now Biden is anti-windows and anti-steak knives?
and Biden didn't just vote for the Iraq war himself, he's even more culpable as he also whipped other Dem Senators into voting for it.
I actively voted for Sanders and contributed to his campaign. I’m passively voting for Biden.
I voted for Sanders in the primary. I’m not out here vote shaming anybody. I stated why I am choosing to vote for Biden because of the people in my family and community who are immigrants, low wage workers, and rely on social welfare. I don’t have your ideological purity
I agree. I also don’t like Biden or Harris. But I’ve never liked any presidential candidate I have voted for.
We so very much need to come together &amp; FIGHT tRump &amp; help people vote SO I HOPE WE ALL FOLLOW EACH OTHER OUT OF  SOLIDARITY TO HELP ELECT JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA HARRIS!
The spin machine will not accept that the left bashed President Trump for his brave decision to shut down travel &amp; months later agree it was a good decision. That would have been 2 more months of exposure if Hillary was at the helm and Joe Biden would not even be a consideration!
yep, saw a dude this morning arguing that “voting against the iraq war was seen as an act of treason” to justify why biden voted yes
Joe Biden was a WONDERFUL VP for President Obama! HE WILL BE A POTUS FOR ALL OF US! #BidenHarris2020
how’ve they been faring under biden and kamala?
The burden of proof lies with the one making the outlandish claim my dude. I don’t need to prove Biden is or isn’t anything. You do. And you can’t because all you have are made up conspiracy theories bred on message boards.
#Trump2020LandslideVictory  The exchange of embassies between Isreal and the UAE is a demonstration of Trumps negotiating ability.  For those that claim that he is beligerant Trump has a plan.  That plan required going against the established doctrine of BIDEN, OBAMA CLINTON.
I can't watch the news or news commentary (Fox News, MSNBC, CNN) without getting furious. I hate Trump and I hate Biden....there's no one to root for. That is a hollow, fucking, feeling. #Biden2020 #Trump2020, #BidenHarris2020, #TrumpPence2020---#NoMatterWhoWinsAmericaLoses
You think that voting for Biden will level the playing field? You’re just plain wrong
Have you watched Trump speak lately? And you think Biden is the one in cognitive decline? You may want to reevaluate why you believe what you believe. Do you believe it because of evidence, or just because Trump told you too. Trump has serious cognitive issues.
Vote for Biden.  Do you still want a country worth fighting for
Need to since Biden has no energy.
Harris selection could majorly boost Biden among Latino voters, polling firm says
If you regret voting for Trump, what have you got to lose if you vote for Biden.
It’s nuts, I think it’s underappreciate how much stuff like that matters to your overall look/brand. Biden already struggles with so much else you’d think he’d have his online presence buttoned down 😅
If you live in Massachusetts vote your conscience. But please vote for Ed Markey in the democratic primary.  (Still, for immigrants, unions, and the environment Biden is demonstrably better).
Not voting for Biden/Harris because they are “insufficiently liberal” when Donald Trump is the only other option is INSANE.
Vote Biden.  It is your best chance for the healing of America.
They aren’t in terms of views but if you are telling me right now that one party is better than the other and that trump is better than biden or vice versa then you’re wrong
I don’t like either party, I think both Trump and Biden are horrible candidates to represent the United States.
I always let you look at those press meetings instead of me having to do so. I’ll always wait for Biden and Harris’ pressers now.
The American people respect all the hard work you are doing for our great nation!  Well done President Biden!

For those people who say they’re still refusing to vote Biden/Harris, but don’t want Trump, what do you propose should be done?  This is a very genuine question that I am looking for an answer to. It’s not meant to be snarky, I would just like to know your thoughts.
Yes: The Durham indictments are coming and people are talking. Where is Hunter? Is Maxwell still alive? All will be revealed soon. grab some popcorn and watch the swamp get drained. Biden is the biggest racist on earth. Just saying.

As it turns out, classism and elitism is rampant in the Democratic Party. However, striking team Obama is hedging their bets in a story like this for a possible Biden collapse. #copolitics
Just imagine thinking Joe "Shoot them in the leg instead of the heart" Biden is in any way radical
Obama/Biden never lost 40M jobs.

People make it sound like protest and lower class frustration will just go away if Biden is in office. If he doesn’t give us what we want why would we stop? At least he’s not going to ghost an entire country like Trump.
And at least Biden has the decency to clarify and apologize for a comment that came out wrong. Your dude just double and triples down on his racism
Vote for Biden.
Trump can win this - don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise.
The ticket that matches me ideologically: Sanders- Warren.   The most powerful potential ticket against Trump: Warren- Buttigieg.  The ticket we got: Biden- Harris.   ...K.
Vote for Biden Harris
right 🤣 Biden is ahead of Trump 🤣
The “suburban housewife” will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge! -Donald Trump
I don’t like mandatory voting bc I don’t agree it’ll produce results that better reflect the will of the people—ppl who don’t want to vote will just troll vote or vote thoughtlessly. It’s probably not the end of the world as long as I still have the option not to vote for a Biden
I will never forget that Obama/Biden left Otto Warmbier.
Too many of us are complacent when Dems are in power. If Biden gets elected, it’s our job to hold him accountable through direct action, public art, letter writing, calling, and actual activism (as opposed to snarky memes and twitter hashtags).

We aren’t going to do what? OMG Biden/Harris has those fools all discombobulated 😂 #BidenHarris2020
We are not voting our way out of this problem. Biden will fix NONE of this - do you honestly think voting magically gives you a smooth, legal transfer of power?  You ignored every stolen election, including in 2016. It was a coup. I said it out loud then, ya’ll called me crazy.
Where were you when our rights were stripped away by the Patriot Act? (Which Biden helped write)?   Where were you when the Obama admin orchestrated brutal police violence against Occupy?  Where were you when people were brutalized at Standing Rock for a pipeline that is leaking?
Truth. I haven't been excited about Biden since he announced his run.
The Ds were told in advance about covid too, and all they did was sell their stocks. Would Biden have handled this slightly better? Probably. Would we still have 60 million unemployed and 30 million homeless? Probably.
Highly recommend y’all click the link &amp; read some good reasons why we should vote for Biden even though he &amp; Harris are not the ideal ticket. This election is your chance to help save the country &amp; also the world! (Words &amp; shirt by

That’s the point. They tell us he’s a huge threat, only voting Dem will save America! While they clap sideways, tear paper, &amp; vote FOR his judges, budgets, surveillance powers, Space Force. Impeach ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. Why are they enabling the “worst threat ever!!”?
So on the short term, nothing. If we somehow win this election, do you think Biden, Pelosi, or Schumer are going to allow investigations and prosecutions, or is it going to be a 2009 “time to turn the page” redux?
This! #AngelaDavis on voting for Biden.

their venn diagrams are a circle, cuz that’s the point - not that obama was worse than romney, that he was the fucking same. same goes for biden/trump. you need to work on your reading comprehension
I disagree,  With  Biden has chosen to NOT alienate many former  voters. Correct, his voting block is a lock, but he needs US to push him over the edge. A #Socialist would have blocked that.
Biden/Harris do not have a solution. Sanders/Warren/Castro are nursing the divide in Texas, hoping O'Rourke never becomes accepted as a national figure. This is what gerry mandering and urban enclaves do. They nuture extreme positions in both parties.
Show me where in the Biden/Harris policy they mention any of the things you’re listing? They’re not there.
Also worth noting Biden/Harris aren’t Sanders/Warren
Biden has no idea what he is saying. If he’s not told what to say, he goes off on Grandpa Simpson-esque tirades that make no sense
As I said before, TX 3 is very much in play. We have Biden up 2 there (Trump won by 14 in ‘16 but Beto got with 3) and Van Taylor is only at 43%.

How long before Trump goes full Putin and arrests Biden?
The Biden/Harris ticket is like an incomplete round of antibiotics. It’ll kick the immediate problem away while creating conditions for further escalation. “Anybody but Trump” won’t go very far come 2024.
Wait till he goes full Putin and arrests Biden.
That being said, I will continue to drag biden &amp; the dnc for not supporting #MedicareForAll. We are in the middle of a pandemic, people are losing their jobs &amp; insurance. Private insurance makes NO FUCKING SENSE.

He is the one that is scared. Trump is terrified about Biden winning, and I am sure his deals with Putin is a big part of it
And how is that different from you saying you don’t want to vote for Biden because of what some of his supporters say to you?
My point is this: You can go ahead and vote for Biden but the blood on your hands won't make you sleep any better. I'll fight anyone of you.
Awesome article with good quotes contrasting styles between the two. Fascinating study in leadership, relationships and frayed bonds.
I don't like it at all. Trump has no problem going left during a pandemic. He can pull it back though. Biden can't.

No you weren’t Dave. You’ve been saying for months you won’t.   Again, you have two choices: Biden or Trump. The other choices, don’t vote, write in, or 3rd party are meaningless. They won’t accomplish anything, especially at this point.   Choose Trump or Biden. Pick one.
Lies. First of all, job growth dropped by 50% from last month. Also, almost all of those jobs were jobs that existed prior to the pandemic. (Obama/Biden *actually CREATED 3 million jobs according to the *actual Department of Labor.) ...unless, of course, you mean gravediggers.
Ryan, you have 5 options:  1. Trump 2. Biden 3. Don’t vote 4. Vote 3rd party  5. Write in  1 and 2 are the only realistic options, like it or not. 3-5 not only won’t cause any systematic change, it will be utterly useless, wasteful, and pointless. The options are 1 or 2.
You realize if you want ranked choice voting the best chance for that is Biden right? Wake up and vote!
Get off Twitter you're helping Trump by not volunteering for Biden.
You know damn well Biden is not lying... he dont even know what the fuck he is saying...
Vote for Biden then promote someone you like better for the next election.

Biden/Harris failed to discuss anything about the need for increased focus on maximizing the availability of widespread, cheap, rapid, and frequent antigen testing, the existing technology that would enable schools, businesses, and other public spaces to open safely.
I keep hearing how Biden is so great at getting, processing, and making decisions based the advice of experts. This ridiculously lacking expression of current priorities leaves me with zero confidence in his abilities in that regard.
How can this be the culmination of Biden's effort to express pandemic policy improvements based on expert advice??!!!  This statement isn't slightly accurate based on the science.   #expertbiden #biden2020 #bidenscience #masksoutside #Unity2020 #anotheroption2020 #2020otheroption

Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.

Less so than Trump's collision course with history. As I alluded to, with Biden we at least have a fighting chance to survive. Trump and republicans are an unmitigated disaster. Vote strategically, think long term. Vote your values locally where they especially count.
Yep, that's weird to me too. But Dem/Rep is some not sort of mirror-opposite pair. We the People at least have a voice with Dems. Republicans serve *only* the wealthy with "trickle down" as their solution to everything. Next POTUS will be Biden or Trump. Choose strategically.

This is troubling. She has the right to her opinion, but this comes across as an endorsement for Biden.  Both parties do good, both do bad. What does she think about Biden / Harris stance on abortion?
Agree, lesser of two evils. But the fetus has no voice, we need to be the voice. Democrats have shown for decades that there is no budging on their pro-abortion position. Biden claiming to be Catholic yet pro-abortion? Respect human life begins with the fetus.
Nope.  Trumpism must be crushed, destroyed.  I am excited about Harris. I have confidence in Biden but it means nothing of Trump and his ilk are defeated in a devastating way
The presidential race is only one of many. Very meaningful work can be done locally. So the answer is always now. As for the next president, unfortunately it is again a two-party race - Biden or Trump. So vote Biden to fight another day. Trump is on a very destructive course.
Joe Biden if his debates are good
The context in which Biden uses the N-Word twice can’t be denied - it’s very degrading.  Curious if Obama ever saw this.
There is so much wrong in this statement, I’m not even going to bother with responding other than to say, Mr. President   YOU ARE WRONG—AGAIN!  Vote Biden/Harris. We can do better in November!

Trump doesn't seem to understand that Biden is a private citizen and has no authority to do anything about the virus. This is what Trump does - projects his own failures onto other people.
Actually that seems like reverse thinking. Both of these men, when playing off the script and carried live, remind the other side how bad they are. At any given moment, it looks like Biden is about to have a stroke

When Biden becomes president and appoints Obama to the Supreme Court, your appeals to your convictions to crimes in office will meet a wall. #BidenHarris2020
I hope the next Democrat after Biden (don't have much faith that guy is going to do much of anything) that gets in takes the Trump playbook, where you just try to do whatever you want, is put into effect...
I am starting to think Joe Biden would make a better president. Donald Trump is not different than Obama he is actually proving he is worse. How can leaders act like they are not seeing at the suffering of this mother traumatized in a daily basis? I have done everything to get...
Biden Leftist is the new Military Intelligence
Maybe making you rething the prespective you're incessently shouting and walking away from when someone hits a nerve?  Biden's not a help, he's an enabler.
Who Biden? Maybe it’s trump
You’re calling out CatholicVote, so you support Biden? A fake Catholic?  Really?
So you are saying you support Biden ? Please speak up, do you consider Biden, who says he is Catholic, even a good Catholic?  Answer please? Trump is no saint, but Biden ?
What the literal crazy?
And this Sunday Biden will go to church while Trump will be off on a golf course somewhere. His true religion
Bullshit!!! Obama/Biden added 11M jobs, you’ve lost 11M+ jobs!!!
Don't confuse democrats; lawful, rational, voting citizens like me, with rioters.  There's a chance the rioters might vote for Biden but I'm guessing they are disconnected from society to the extent they won't vote at all.  Nobody is courting them for support; we don't need them.
Definitely will be worried about my civil rights &amp; basic dignity if Biden/Harris should be elected.  You’re The Swamp &amp; will be exposed for your corruption if there’s any justice.  You talk about Beau a lot ~ where’s Hunter?
As #TrumpKillsUSPS, ask for your ballot early, vote Biden, close your envelope, sign it and take it to a drop box near you. That is the only way to work around the corruption of Trump and his cronies, including Putin. Vote! Go the extra mile. This country depends on it
Just looked at your page. Having fun baiting people in stupid discussions? Your page has Biden/Harris on it. Either you recently, as in past few hours, changed to the dark side or you are bored and having fun baiting people into the discussion. Yes, I responded but not to did. 👋
After Trump decimates Biden in one debate, let Trump debate Harris!  He’ll take them both down!  He’s been working his arse off 4 years &amp; I guarantee Trump knows all the answers.  Biden&amp; Harris have been on the sidelines demonizing him... and have no idea what’s going on.
Dementia Biden &gt; Insane Trump  Any day of the week, comrade
It wouldn’t be Biden, that’s for sure.  Trump works constantly - never stops. They even criticize him when he plays a round of golf!
So funny that now you’re saying about Trump exactly what we KNOW about Biden.
So screw the debates &amp; the rest of the campaigns - just move Biden into the White House &amp; get it over with, right?  That’s how dumb &amp; corrupt a democrat is.  Screw elections, just get on with the Marxism!
Trump will destroy Biden in a debate.
Couldn’t be that Trump will clean Biden’s clock in The debates, huh? BTW the American people will never elect senile Joe Biden/Harris &amp; take the country into Socialism.  They can sequester Biden to try to protect him but the American don’t buy it. Trump by a landslide.
And what's your qualifications to determine that?  Why should I listen to you over actual doctors that have given Biden physicals?
I think I figured it out. You don't know who this guy is. That's why you don't care he is in very public neurological decline. He's your father. You should care that he can't read any longer. At least as much as you do about Joe Biden. #TrumpIsUnwell
Hahahahaha. She’s below average. Especially if your vote is really for her and not for Biden since he’s got dementia
You are an excellent person to match with Biden. Keep him in line along with he senate 😏
suburban ☑️  voting for Biden/Harris ☑️
I’d like to report a threat to a protectee.   A television personality is saying that Joseph R. Biden will not live to stand for election.  Her name is Jeannine Pirro and there is video evidence.
.  I absolutely loved hearing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak to our country today. They both are so articulate, so passionate and extremely intelligent. They love our country, they love their families and they will restore our democracy!
You Trump Haters would love to continue hiding Biden by not having debates.  What are you Trump Haters so afraid of??
He’s doing if again. Quid pro quo. You elect me I’ll eliminate the tax I imposed on you. Someone tell Biden to make the same forgiveness claim.
He just gave rave reviews for Kamala Harris and referenced Biden as the next president of the US.
Also, your repeatedly calling Joe Biden "evil" sort of gives it all away.
To quote our next POTUS, "Time to get to work."  Get out there and vote, people.  Support Biden-Harris!
Notice Biden/Harris didn’t tout any of Biden’s accomplishments or successes during his 48 political career.  It’s bc he had none.  Although he &amp; his family did enrich themselves bc of his corruption.
U guys realize Biden is the same as trump only less of a cunt
Biden haters and Russian troll bots are even mad about Biden playing Curtis Mayfield. Snowflakes! They hate positivity.  #BidenHarris2020
So I'll believe the actual medical doctors who say that Joe Biden doesn't have dementia over some random person on the internet who isn't a doctor.
My guess is he might actually be taking votes away from Donald - the Republicans who just can't bring themselves to vote for Joe Biden.
Do we comment on Biden’s outfit too? Please?
So excited for Biden's VIP pick! #BidenHarris2020
Biden will suffer a “stroke” at the 11th hour and kamala will assume the nomination and pick a “safer” VP pick who is more like able
I mean you do know that Joe Biden deals with sluttering, right? It's a speech disorder which involves frequent and significant problems with normal fluency and flow of speech.  And it has been diagnosed as such by actual doctors, not Twitter moms. It doesn't mean he has dementia.
People whining about Biden when they had no problems with kind of insanity for the last four years, simply hilarious
I’m voting Biden-Harris.   Let’s do this.  2020💙
Pure comedy to see Trumpers make moral arguments, or bring up corruption, or in one case "race baiting" to use against Biden/Harris vs Trump.  Republicans circled around a racist, corrupt, amoral, liar whose self absorption has caused more Americans to die than any war. FU!
I guess this is the only black person they know so they had to get him to run as a spoiler, so all black people will vote for Kanye and Joe Biden will lose????  Clueless!
May every single one of our nasty women tribe vote for Biden-Harris 2020!
This is what strikes me the most. Biden/Harris want to lead, and honestly, would any of us want this job next? The nightmare situation they will inherit is unprecedented.
Finally! This country has a big, wide ray of hope with a Biden/Harris ticket. Can we elect them tomorrow?
Wrong, Liz. Watch this. November 3rd we elect Biden/Harris. In a landslide.
This suburban housewife is voting for Biden. #resign #TrumpVirus #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Well Biden is basically a conservative so....
Joe Biden is in the early stages of dementia.  So there’s that.
What about the Trump vs Biden debate? Isn’t that who the race is with Trump and Biden? What happened to that?
Biden can’t even read a sentence on a teleprompter, but he will unite &amp; heal us &amp; restore our soul!  You’ve gotta be kidding!
Biden is their puppet.
Dr. Biden, we are all ready!
In this dystopian world, Kamala Harris sails above the presidential bar
Dr. Jill Biden, Secretary of Education. 🛎
Joe Biden’s selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate is a home run.  She’s an amazing public servant and will be a stellar VP.
#Biden chose the person who was the most critical of him, which shows that he has qualities of a leader instead of propensities of a dictator.  #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
The USA is no longer a world leader.  Thank you, I hope we get health care, also.   I agree. Our climate can't wait another day. Trump gutted EPA regulations &amp; pulled us out of the Paris Accord. Biden will rectify all of that.
As I have already said, Biden was my second to last choice.  I watched Kamala shred Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr. I enjoyed it. I am sick of white men being in power.   I actually wanted a Warren/Harris ticket, but god forbid we have an all female ticket.
We can only hope that Biden/Harris do a better job.  The Democratic party has evolved since 1994.
Biden was my second to last choice.  We had numerous more qualified female candidates.
What? You trying to be funny?  Hillary just acknowledged that the Democratic ticket is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   Maybe Tim should stop running his mouth.
Yes, all Republicans are pro-life. Republicans voted for Trump because they think he is pro-life. They are one-issue voters.  Biden is RESPECTED by people on both sides. That's a plus.  Answer my question - you want Trump?
I'd be more ready if it weren't Harris... or Biden.... but at this point I'll take Hillary over the current dumpster fire
The guy who wanted 5 kids to get the death penalty just for being guilty of being black is trying to tell us Biden is racist. I think you better spend your dollars convincing Ohio and Pennsylvania that we are going back 50 years and returning to a manufacturing economy.
Why are you so sure it won't get better under Biden/Harris?
Hmm.  You are the only one who says that you will keep POC out of the suburbs, that will protect slave owners statues, and says BLM are terrorists.  So, I don’t think people will believe you on Joe Biden.
Lauren, you are the type of leader we need in the white House, not Trump, not Biden, not Kamala
Had to break it to you but I never said I wanted Biden to lose
Biden has been out and about following social distancing protocol. God I can’t wait for the debates to start.
these ads are already up? obviously they were afraid of #Kamala for some time now #KamalaHarris #BidenHarris #Biden #BidenVP
Trump would have tweeted that Karen Bass was a dog.  He didn’t really know her, maybe she brought coffee or something.  Joe Biden called her, like an adult, and a man who cares about America.
I’m in. Great Pick Joe Biden.
Again, criticism of Biden/Harris isn't an endorsement of Trump/Pence. It is part of demanding better - for those who think for themselves and don't tow a party line blindly, it is something that should be encouraged. We can be better than this.
I gues you have more trust in the D's and Biden than I do - I consider it almost meaningless. The dirty laundry goes way beyond her DA experience. Regardless, ignoring it, or condemning those who refuse to ignore, it is making politics worse.
After giving it some VP Biden has made the right decision picking Kamala Harris for his running mate as VP in the 2020 election.
Oh, am I going to enjoy how they’ll kick your ass, Donnie. You’ll be humiliated and I hope you live long enough to suffer from jail for all you’ve done right after Biden takes over
People who think Joe Biden cares about me are stupid, im voting for him but only because I rather get punched in one eye than both
will eat your lunch  you have no clue what’s coming your way. Your out of your league on this one. Take a nap now while you can. #Biden #Kamala #KamalaHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP #VPHarris
Joe Biden just have a big fuck you to the people involved in the BLM movement. Why would he pick a person who put so many people of color behind bars?!
I absolutely agree. Four years of Biden, eight years of Harris! #BidenHarris #BlueWave2020
I'm not sure she can walk this back. Again, either she was lying then, or she's lying now... either way, it is unacceptable. And by pointing to Trump as a refutation, and setting the bar that low to justify this, isn't helping.
Biden just lost any chance of becoming President She is widely unliked by people on both sides
So she calls Biden a racist and believes his rape accusers. And  runs with him and you back all this? Woow
1) the argument is how she intentionally represented the issue, and her implications.  2) I know what Biden said, I agreed with him - this is about her, again straw manning Joe &amp; lying about the situation.  1/3
Yes. Now you can vote for that man in the White House.  We are fighting for our country. Vote Biden/Harris!
I don't think there was ever a question for Biden that his Vice President pick would be #KamalaHarrisForVP. I think when he said his pick would be a woman, he knew exactly who. He held everyone in suspense to create some excitement. I'm excited!  #BidenHarris2020
Now we know who picked her!  Beware!  Evil Soros hand picked Kamala for VP - Biden is an empty vessel.  Be very afraid, Patriots!   Vote Red!  Our country will be gone if we elect these anti-American Marxists.
The implications of racsim by working with desegrationists, forced bussing, and using herself (as a child) as an example. A terrible and shameless line of attack, but she did it. I recommend you look at what, and how, she said them.   Also, this:
Biden/Harris!! We deserve this! Let's make it happen, America!!!
You didn’t pick Harris; she was picked for you!  She was a vicious disgrace trying to demonize Judge Kavanaugh at his hearing &amp; many of us will never forget her vile interrogation of him.  Biden/Harris is the worst presidential ticket we’ve ever seen.  Where’s Hunter?
Biden, competent? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Apple autocorrect would like to announce Joe Biden’s running mate selection, Senator Kampala Harris #BidenHarris #ByeDonJr
I can't stand her, but will vote for Biden no matter what.
Oh crap. Really? After that stunt she pulled to discredit him? Damn. Oh well. #Biden/Anybody2020.
truth Biden is a political liar and always has been and in 47 years he gave us the big time crime bill against Kamala Harris’s constituents
That Biden chose a Leftist Communist
Because “WE THE PEOPLE” for Biden don’t need the foolishness! People are sick of Trump and his blind followers!
Biden/Harris 2020: Get Bus...ted.
The Leftist Communists will have the Whitehouse if Biden is elected!! That is just the worst situation for America ever!!
Sitting here listening to... ...DONNIE FUCKSTICK.... blabble, blabble, blabber. WHEN ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO SAY SOMETHING INTELLIGENT ?? Now that we have a Biden/Harris ticket YOU ARE RUNNING SCARED !!
Certainly the pandemic has taught everyone that our health insurance shouldn't be tied to unemployment.  I am going to hold out a little hope that Biden/Harris will do the right thing.
I’m voting Biden/Harris no matter what &amp; you should too.
everybody talking about who they wanted joe biden’s running mate to be, like bruh... i jus want her😔
Y'all supporting Biden the pedophile? I thought we were saving our children?
I absolutely love this piece. Mail in ballots are the only way I have voted since turning 18. #2020Elections
Does this mean if I don’t vote for Trump I’m voting Biden?
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden’s running mate
It’s kind of comical that Harris called Biden a racist, demanded an apology, never got it, yet is now his running mate...
What lessons does Biden pick hold for 2024 deputy PM picks here? Starmer will want to balance his ticket northwards — Nandy has to be in with a shout. Blair did similar by picking Prescott as his running mate. Imagine Johnson/Sunak is already nailed on.
Biden/Harris! It's on like Donkey Kong!
Congrats to our first woman Vice President! There is no way Biden/Harris can lose! 2020 and beyond!
#Breaking: Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP
Neither Biden nor Pence has military experience, either. I've long respected you, your service and your positions, but this one reeks.
I doubt you "know" much of anything. Its a legitimate question - you say "no" without any proof, and then resort to lame &amp; intellectually shallow name calling.   Also, does she still believe him to be a sexual deviant?
Joe Biden confirms my exclusive:
Congratulations, Vice-President Kamala Harris!   Biden's announcement has brought me the first spark of hope I have felt in years!
Make no mistake, Kamala Harris is the real presidential candidate. If elected Joe Biden will not make it past 2/1/2021 before he is declared mentally unfit, and replaced by her. This is a bait and switch like no other.
And Biden won't become president til 2021.
Understand from Democratic Party source that Joe Biden is about to nominate Kamala Harris as his running mate
I'm thrilled! Biden made the best possible choice!
Why is Biden announcing this like a judges house episode of X Factor
We need to hold both houses of Congress and the White House. We can get there if #ProgressivesForBiden &amp; Independents join us to vote for Biden, then we should have a new president.
I am too Anna. Joe Biden is an honorable man of integrity and empathy.
And just like that trumpies try to make Biden look as bad as Trump.  This will never happen; Trump has waay too much baggage, too many accusations, too many payoffs, too many divorces and too many human failures.  #MeToo is alive and well, thankfully.
The best choice for  Biden VP should be someone who has govern,  everything else will in place.
For Biden pick as  VP  Gretchen Whitmer .......
Get on with it, Biden! Just tell us what strong female will be doing your heavy lifting! #tuesdaymood
You mean VP pick has been revealed to Biden by his top staff of course.
You have absolutely nothing.  All you can do is try to tear down Biden, because you can't run on the disastrous results of the last 3 1/2 years.  Can't wait until you're gone, and the SDNY puts 45 behind bars.  Lock him up!!
What else is new?  It's been this way since the late ‘80s.  I'm rooting for Harris.  She'd make a great president if Biden were to be incapacitated.
You interpret Biden's actions as sexual.  I think they're more misplaced grandfatherly affection; not necessarily sexual.  Agree it's weird and gross, but he's not Trump with huge amounts of sexual baggage that trumpies choose to ignore.
I disagree.  There is no evidence he ever did anything sexual.  You perpetuate this false narrative.  Your cult leader did say “In 10 years I'll be dating her.  Can you believe it?”.  20+ allegations of sexual assault against Trump and you perpetuate this lie about Biden.
I don't excuse it.  I think it's creepy.  I am disappointed in the DNC's selection.  I’m not voting for Biden as much as voting against Trump who is 1000x worse.  As usual it's the choice of the lesser of 2 evils.
Those videos show Biden sniffing hair, that's all.  I agree it's weird but one could make a credible case for grandfatherly affection in all cases.  Nobody has filed suit although I think a couple said it was awkward.  Contrast this with 20+ allegations against Trump.
They can sign it. No one would understand it. This is my thing. Why does his family seemed publicly obsessed with Biden's health while being publicly obtuse to their father's health?
I would vote for a Biden/Obama ticket.
Click the video to see Wednesday/Thursday. Harris is the last person right before Biden.
The entire Biden Family is corrupt &amp; they’re eager for Joe to be President so they all can enrich themselves for another 4 yrs.
if his name was Joe Biden, you would be all over this. Right?  It can't be dementia if he didn't know in the first place.
Biden has always been a Liar.
This fucking idiot right here... and people are whining about we need to make a case for them to vote for Biden.  SMFH.
How awesome would this be if Buttigieg was picked as Biden’s VP. Lmao!! 🤣 I’m really rooting for this 🤣😉
I hope the 51 million plus people unemployed understand that their 401K will go down when Biden is president. I'm sure this is the most pressing thing on your plate right now while you fight eviction, go to a food bank and apply for unemployment. #TrumpPressConference
I vote for B...  yes option B and Biden.
so this is tge new employment scenario under Democratic Rule and Biden huh????
Biden can’t support his own train of thought for more than a few minutes. I’m not saying he’s too old to be president, but I don’t think he’s all mentally there enough to take on such a large responsibility as being the president of the United States of a America.
MI has issues.  If it makes you feel better,  3 of my family members in MI who voted for no one for Pres and 2 who voted for Trump in 2016 are committed to vote for Biden.  There is hope.
Perhaps, but it is conceivable that no vice presidential pick has ever been as important, given the general perception that Biden will not even complete his first term
Trump can make a big deal out of cutting a tax related to payroll that sounds really good to his followers, and say Biden will put it back, which he’ll have to or it’ll be on his watch that Social Security and Medicare fail. No win situation for Biden.
Well said.  Trump is the best President we’ve ever had bc he truly cares about the country &amp; ALL Americans!  He gets no respect from the msm or Left but works tirelessly for us &amp; will defeat the hapless Biden in Nov. Biden would widen the swamp that Trump is draining.
Joe Biden rides a bike, while daddy rides a golf cart!
Ok let's tally this up. China bought Biden &amp; the resulting carnage was Hunter got a job. Russia buys Heir Father &amp; the resulting carnage is 165,564 dead from the #TrumpVirus, dozens dead from Russian bounties, &amp; 51M+ unemployed. The only good thing is #MaryTrump's bestseller.
VOTE   FOR   BIDEN   !!!
VOTE  FOR  BIDEN   TKS   !!!
TELL   ALL    TO  VOTE   FOR    BIDEN  TKS   !!!
Biden is doing just fine. Looking forward to watching his inauguration in January 2021. So will the rest of the world.
Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, AOC, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, All socialist trying to create hostility in our society to gain political power and to push their socialist agenda.
I would vote for Biden if he picked his dog Major as his running mate.
Nancy Biden
I don’t know what happened with you two, but best wishes. I’m just happy Sandy is wearing a mask and voting Biden. My world is small.
Seen Biden on a bike yesterdys, and then this:
Biden couldn’t interview a sock.
There is no way biden gets on the same stage as trump! No way!
#Biden talk about your mancunian candidate!
I remember how ineffective Kaine was/is.  If she chose him for that reason she did well. But the democrat field is so weak, i.e., the 2020 dem candidates - Biden/Harris are the best they got? 😨
Biden/Doocy 2020
Biden/Doocey 2020
Joe Biden is a Catholic ????  Don't make me puke.
Come on, Man!  You know Biden has no plan - he doesn’t have a clue what’s going on.  Trump is handling the country great &amp; will defeat you &amp; Joe in a landslide. You, President?  That’s almost as big a joke as Biden being president!
Win what? No one delights in your public demise. Get some help. Get back to writing &amp; push your art. I don't think you are hurting Biden. I think you are hurting yourself &amp; your family. I'm going to be straight with you. I am not a fan of your music. But, I hate watching this.
You'd rather have the Orange Monster in the White House for 4 more years? I know Biden's not ideal, but he'll surround himself with qualified people, not grifters. He'll at least start steering the ship in the right direction.
Do Biden voters watch Fox?
He's got some good songs but never bought a album id vote kanye way before i voted for that scumbag biden!
Joe biden isnt worthy of any vote period if ur to blind to see that u probably shouldn't be allowed to vote the guys senile he sexually assaulted tara reade he has pedophile tendencies!
Agree, I think it's possible Biden in such bad shape mentally that Cuomo could be shoed in at DNC and if so its about what gives him more votes.  Parents of children win out over unions.
Voting for Biden as soon as I land #biden #Biden2020  #BidenHarris2020  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica  #CountryOverParty  #EvictTrump  #FourMoreYears
Seriously are Democrats brainwashed it's amazing how they say one thing and do another just like Nancy pelosi blaming Trump for not doing things fast enough on coronavirus but yet it was her dancing around in Chinatown saying to not block people and Joe Biden saying xenophobe wth
Why are you running? While I see from your platform that you are a socialist and environmentalist, you know as well as I do that your race will only impact the votes for Biden, and possibly allow Trump to win. I find that unacceptable.
Why would anyone even think this?  Can somebody defend this position or are her marbles just as loose as Joe Biden?
He wasn't trailing Biden for the last 3 years
Have you shown your father half as much interest in his medical care that you have shown Biden? I know you are kind of the ignored one because you don't have his name &amp; you don't have a vagina, but that reality that you don't SEE your father's brain is rotten fruit is glaring.
The idea that Kanye should suspend his mental illness long enough for Biden to get elected is ridiculous. The run is the disease.
No one would do what you've done!  Competent presidents would have nipped this in the bud in December of last year.  They wouldn't ignore everything around them for months.  I've been working from home in March and I don't see any end it sight -- until President Biden!
Educate yourself and read, Biden has been called out for his pro-abortion stance.
Do I want to hear a debate of Trump  saying Biden is going to destroy GOD and Biden saying you are a ridiculous fool. I will pass. It is not my type of comedy.
Biden was also 100% against gay marriage until the SCOTUS ruled on the decision. He suddenly supports their rights to marry.
if Biden's thumb was on life support and Biden's thumb were on the ballot, I'd vote for Biden's thumb.  Doing anything else only contributes to the total destruction of the United States.
Nothing New - CNN covers for Biden constantly.  CNN has absolutely no credibility left.
So?!  Have you noticed there are no rallies &amp; this isn’t a normal election year? Good for Trump for getting his message out anyway possible.  Hey, CNN forgot to report on Biden’s latest insult to African Americans today!
I don’t care if he picks a bar of soap for VP.  I’m voting for Biden.
If Biden can hurt the Christian god then either he’s more powerful than their god, or their god is a pussy.
Biden’s one tough MF if he can hurt god!😂
Can’t believe you’d vote for Biden. Emotions aside, do the right thing.
As we all know, Joe didn’t write this.  I doubt he even realizes that he said what he said. Let’s end this charade, horrible sham, being perpetrated on the American people.  Everyone can see Biden disintegrates daily. No matter how much u hate Trump, he will win.
War Biden! Before I just was picking lesser of two evils now you say I’m voting for Kratos? #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Trump is god in this scenario. Biden will hurt Trump if he wins....like his feelings, I guess?
Stupid Biden
It seems like the obvious voting strategy (at the national level) is "Biden plus Republicans in the Senate to check him." I suspect the outcome will be "Biden plus the Senate Republicans take a shellacking."
Next week:  "Biden's green deal means cars are illegal, dishwashers illegal, no cops, no airplanes, no toilets.  Think about that, no toilets.  I think about that.  My hotels have the best toilets.  Biden will take all the toilets out of the suburbs and give them to inner city"
Has anyone else noticed that Biden looks a lot like Walter?  Coincidence?   #JeffDunham #WalterJeffDunham
If Biden has the ability to hurt God, I think everyone should vote for him.   That would make him God right?   I mean if you knock the guy in boxing or MMA you get the belt. That's not too far fetched, is it?  #Biden2020
This is not what is going to bring down Joe Biden.  It's reaching as hard as they can to find something, anything to stick to Biden.   COVID19 is what is on America's mind, and this is meh!
The funniest part about  saying Biden will "Hurt the Bible. Hurt God. He's against guns. He's against energy. " is I haven't been to church in never, but that's what your sermons are like? God, guns, and energy?  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
So Joe Biden said that the African-American isn't diverse because AFRICAN-Americans' ancestors are from Africa, but Hispanic-Americans can have ancestors from Spain, Mexico, Brazil, etc.  How is that insulting?  Who is insulted?
If Biden wins, he will not have the power to get rid of the second amendment. Unlike you Biden knows that he won’t have total authority. He actually understands the US constitution.
No, your guns will NOT be taken away. And, Joe Biden wants to allocate MORE $ to police dep’ts. Don’t believe this douchenozzle. 864511320
Joe Biden is Beatrix Kiddo.
Still baffling that the leaders of the free world, the most powerful nation on earth, are giving people a choice of Biden or Trump as president.
"Biden hurts God"  Dude, don't we have to vote for the guy who can hurt God?  I mean maybe he wasn't talking about The God. Just some little Greek or Egyptian god. Little "g".  But still, that's pretty impressive. I think I will vote for that guy no matter what, right?
This is what Trump said today about Joe Biden, a practicing Catholic. What church does Trump go to? Trump plays golf on Sundays, right? How can Biden "hurt God"? Does Trump sound like a leader is this video?
Say you ARE voting for Biden. That is more clear.
😂😂😂😂  Honey, read up.
It is your vote. What is it with some white women? He hasn’t destroyed and killed off enough us yet?  His health appears worse than Biden’s. So you approve more of Pence the CINO (Christian in name only) and one of that man in the White House’s “followers”?
I’m sorry but that headline is one of the dumbest I’ve ever read and I can’t imagine anything in your article that could possibly change my opinion.   You’d pick trump/pence over Biden/someone you don’t like?
I know. That man in the White House’s VP is a CINO (christian in name only) and a “follower”. How could Biden’s VP be worse?  For some that R means everything to them 😢.
Are you a never trump?  If you are unable to vote for Biden depending on his VP pick wa wa, maybe you are party over country. Sounds like an excuse.
This guy is telling people about Biden's relationship with God?
1 outrageous Biden take per day. This is fun. I can get used to it. Grand finale when someone cuts them all together in October.
Awesome. We need the support of Vets for Biden, who won't even believe American soldiers are targeted for assassination by Russia. What a slap in the fact to vets.
45 is indeed losing it bigly. However, I suspect all the FOXNEWS journalists are speaking of Biden. Actually a very satiric thing to do. I love
I apologize, I shouldn't say you have a closed mind, after all you did change parties. Biden was not my first choice, Bernie was. Let me ask, what exactly made you change?
"More progressive than Biden" IS NOT PROGRESSIVE. HE VOTED FOR SEGREGATION!!!Correction: BLM single handedly donates $48MM to Biden's campaign
While I agree that "Blue No Matter Who" in the presidential race is important, being hostile towards people with legitimate concerns about Biden/Harris isn't going to get them on your side.
I won’t survive it. 😥😥😥. Biden and Harris will win. We will vote even if we have to walk over hot coals or broken glass in our bare feet. We will vote and we will get rid of these criminals!
...and their union with 300,000 members just endorsed #Biden
Oh, I don't just mean interjecting on on political opinions, I mean potentially holding an office in the Biden Administration. Clinton and Biden go back a long way politically.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president #SmartNews
Cool. But how many Trumpers or undecided voters are gonna go "hmm 🤔 you know I never really paid attention to facts before, but now that this Black/Asian-American woman is saying those facts &amp; telling me Mike Pence is wrong, I'm gonna vote for Biden!"
I love the  ads.  has set the bar so low that all Biden has to do is wear a mask and promise to listen to the experts. #ByeDon2020
My names joe biden and...c'mon man. I thought you liked me. #MyCampaignSlogan
Yeah. This part ☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻? TRump’s head would literally explode. In a cloud of partially chewed Big-Macs and KFC. Never👏🏻Gonna👏🏻Happen👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻...until Biden can give this speech😏
Vote like Biden is 10pts down. Don’t be complacent.
If Biden wins every state carried by Hilary and re takes PA, MI and WI then game is over
Possible that if you asked Biden about this he wouldn't remember saying it, but it's still really dark and disturbing
You might want to get used to hearing the Clinton name. With Biden potentially winning the Presidency, there is also the potential that Hillary Clinton will re-enter the political arena in some form or another.  Not to bait a rabbit mob responding. but there is the possibility.
Yeah some lawyer nobody has ever even heard of getting a soft slap on the wrist. Hopefully I'm wrong about that outcome. If that is the outcome, Republican Party is dead as dead gets. Deader than Biden. Burnt toast 🔥🔥🔥
I’m not excited about a Biden Harris ticket. And I think people and survivors specifically have their very legitimate reasons for not voting for them. But if Angela Davis can settle for this ticket then so can I. Get in the car girls, we’re settling 🥴
Hunter Biden
Republicans are so scared of a barely moderately-to-the-left Joe Biden that they are willing to dismantle the constitutionally-mandated  to win, and on top of that if we lived in a country that made sense, their party would be disbanded as a punishment.
Thank you Mitch! Now PLEASE, vote for Biden- not your wife! PLEASE!!!!!!
Over thirty million people protested this summer and yet the president could not fill an arena in Oklahoma. Not to dismiss the issue or anything, but I would tend to think Biden turnout will probably still be decisive.
Hey Jimmy, when are you clowns going to Q&amp;A Biden/Harris?
When someone offers to save you from a burning building you take their hand. Joe Biden is the hand.
They’re just Biden time
"Didn’t Barr announce neither Obama or Biden are under investigation?"  you mean like when Comey said publicly and lied under oath that Trump wasn't under investigation??? and the entire time they were illegally spying on him 🤔
fake obstruction charges doesn't change what Obama did or the truth that's slowly getting declassified bit by bit  Barr won't announce charges against Obama and Biden until after some of the other big fish get fried anyway  today is just the tip of the iceberg  enjoy the show🤣
If Biden wins the entire investigation will be buried forever  #Hannity
Dude over here tweaking about this. Typical. Vote Biden 2020
If Biden is sinking...then what do you call Trump as thousands of Americans die and more go unemployed?
Where the fuck is  Thought he was going to help Biden get elected?
So much for unity on your part. This is divisive and narcissistic performative nonsense at a time when Democrats should be united behind the nominee, Joe Biden. You should be ashamed of yourself acting like a mere pedestrian on social media.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Progressives for Biden Convention Watch Party” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
The latest   / Marist poll found Joe Biden 11 points ahead of Donald Trump:
🤮🤮🤮If anyone is going to destroy our democracy its Biden and Harris!
Stop shaming people who will vote for Biden/harris. I don't want to but I know they will bend to the will of the people because their history shows it. If you don't vote then you truly are giving up and allowing people to due needlessly.  these retweets are dense.
Maybe I’m missing something but Pence pardoning him for what if he’s not been charged for anything before Biden enters office?
this is a Harris-Biden team, Not a Biden-Harris team #Hannity
Yeah ask Nancy she’s a Catholic and so is Biden!
But if you don't vote then you don't get the chance to have the protests and the movement matter. Trump will never budge or change anything. But Biden/harris will have to bend to the will of the people. If history shows anything its that they do bend when it comes down to it.
Biden should not agree to debate unless a fact chk is done about every statement
If Biden was still with it I imagine he’d be pretty pissed off at whoever is writing lie after lie on his Twitter.
If Harris gets elected then I wonder if they move Biden's basement to the White House fixing to be called the Black House or move the now called Black House to Biden's basement? Just asking. lol
The USCCB said that a staffer who told the bishops’ news service she was elated that Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate spoke in a personal capacity.  The conference did not address the substance of her remarks.
Joe Biden doesn’t deserve to be President! He’s a moose knuckled tater tosser!
Ya think they had a choice? 4 more years of a lunatic or Biden!
Biden is the biggest racist on earth. Harris is the biggest fake on earth. She now thinks she is black if that gets her in power.
well, he probably didn’t pick her. The DNC picked her and then told Biden that he picked her. He knows that he can’t remember anything, so he believed them and ran with it.
So in other words they are going to censure conservative videos if they say anything about 'Baffoon' Biden or 'Lot Lizard' Harris.
Again, hope I'm wrong, but mark my words-- Biden wont be any better. In fact he'll be just as bad. And if something happens to him and Kamala becomes president? I'd expect the same fash actions as trump's regime.  I really want to be wrong : /
We do not need leaders like this. Our young people my grandkids need adults as leaders.
And Biden is somehow even less progressive than Obama. And Kamala is a fucking cop. She would rather incarcerate innocent people to let them fight fires for free than let them live their lives freely. They arent agents of change. If I am wrong Ill GLADLY eat my words.
Either vote for Biden/Harris or STFU and leave!
Like Im gonna vote for biden/harris but it doesnt matter in the end, theyre still gonna bomb foreign nations most of our country will never see or be aware of, kill our own people, and subvert progress for profit. Climate change will kill us before we get anywhere
We couldn’t even hold Obama accountable, and mf’s out here pretending like we’re going to somehow hold Joe Biden to a higher standard lmao
How could this possible be a conflict of interest?  Wink! Wink! look over here there is nothing wrong with #MailInVoting #MailInBallotFraud
#Tucker it is not "the Biden-Harris team", it is "the Harris-Biden team"
Biden who?
people like "stop badmouthing kamala and biden, we need democrats even if its just baby step changes for the better!!" lmao bitches the world wont survive any more incremental change, this is beyond the time for dramatic and massive change or we will die as a species but ok mb
Have u all noticed a lot of ads for Biden and not one for Trump on this platform? Trump got Twittergated and we know it. Indictments are coming. I believe the report is complete and getting plenty of popcorn and lots of beers. lol
Y’all bout to go vote for Biden . Him and Kamala more racist than trump 🤦🏾‍♂️
They would be asked policy questions and have to explain their current socialist agenda. Biden is currently leading in the polls, why upset the Apple cart.
The legislature would change that and they have a veto proof majority. This was discussed at length when Warren was being considered for VP. It will be a non issue if Biden wants her in his cabinet, as it would have had she been chosen.
Yes please. Let’s vote him out. Biden has members of Sunrise on his team at the very least.
So now it’s Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, everyone knows Biden is just a vessel for the far left.
Hannity will be whining this guys name like Uranium One. All through the Biden administration. Unlike with trumps friends, he will likely face punishment, and serve his time if convicted.
Biden wasn’t the best pick given the field of candidates. But, he’s the only alternative to Trump.
I don’t support any of these people in any way whatsoever, but, umm, I’m pretty sure Lenin, Mao, etc would be laying the groundwork for a revolution, not endorsing Biden 😂😂
You are no more aware than Biden.
Like we’re prospering now? Get the fuck outta here!!  #Biden-Harris2020
I would crawl through a prison sewer like Andy Dufresne at Shawshank to vote for Biden/Harris
Not a Biden sign.
Well I’m not going to defend Biden. Why the democrats chose an old white guy is beyond me, but even with his weaknesses he’s still several times better than this incompetent President.
Yeah but I think we are getting better. I am a little weary of them cause if do win will want conservative policies but nice helping Biden win.
Kamala Harris probably won't be a loud voice advocating for legalization, but she can reassure Joe Biden about the California experience. It's gonna be okay, Joe. Legalization works.  by  #CannabisCulture #CannabisSociety #ColoradoCannabis
Spent an hour waiting to get postcard stamps, to write postcards for Biden/Harris.  Turns out you have to order them online, and wait 7 days to get them.  I called your office, spoke to Hannah.  You need to be working, organizing protests, or fighting the Dictator.  Not tweeting.
What does she care? She’s not running for office or is she? Maybe she has been offered a seat on the Biden Harris Cabinet of Undetected or Unpunishable Crime.
Uh that parody is joe Biden saying back during busing he didn’t want his kids going to a jungle school. Look it up dummy.
Do you still trust USPS with your ballot?  #copolitics #coleg #usps #Election2020
Progressives on MSM saying they're dedicated to their principles and goals and that supporting Biden/Harris isn't really giving in. Huh #NeverBidenHarris
Few steps forward followed by miles in reverse... 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Yet you’re voting for Biden simply because he’s a democrat... please
Doing nothing and a watching it happen is just as bad as doing it. Trump is bad, but Biden is right there neck for neck
Huh? What’s that even mean? You contantly teeet about Biden, so....?
Biden would have no response. No response is the same as a bad response. Biden was missing for like 6 weeks of his campaign and you somehow think that makes a promising presidency 🤔 seriously questioning your logic
If I were Biden I would hire this dude and spray paint “New World Order” on the front...
Oo we got vocab now! Literally everything on that little list you made Biden has said he will make no change to. I don’t get where you think he will do anything better. He has said numerous times he will change nothing
I always hope so, but does it actually?   And though I hate voting for the lesser of two evils, I’m afraid to not vote for Biden becuas trump has got to go!
Say one is better (between trump and Biden) than the other makes me question your ethics. They are the same. To sit there and ask me “what would you rather have - the same shit for 4 years in red or the same shit for 8 but in blue??” Of course I’ll pick the 4 years
Both the Republican and Democrat nomination this year are fucking trash people are only voting for Biden because they don’t like trump and vise versa. No one looks at actual facts anymore🤦‍♂️
Corporate news works for the same donors as the ones donating to Trump.  Corporate news might be happier w/ Trump, juicier stories. Biden will be boring at best.
I don’t think anybody is worried California won’t go for Biden. More worried about Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina ...
Biden / Harris is the Fakest ticket I have ever seen. Totally propped up by media
No. But I have at least 2 close friends, not trumplicans, who are refusing to vote for Biden. It's...insane. And I've told both of them that. 🤷‍♀️
Isn't that Biden's argument?
To EVERYONE - if you want to keep your Post Office better vote Biden
I think you and I disagree on Trump and Biden and the legitimacy of Catholic's voting for one or the other. I do appreciate you fighting against racism. Come to Denver and let's grab a beer.
Trump supporters tell me a third party vote helps Biden. So, which is it?
Yeah and some of his takes are pretty decent (only watched like 5 or 6 vids kuz they long). Today is him saying lenin would vote for biden was a special kind of silly 😜
Fair enough. But it isn't Trump supporters who made it mandatory Biden choose a "black woman." The birther thing is nonsense. Incidentally, we are all fed. Aren't we? We can choose the restaurant. You choose CNN, NYT, WAPO, MSNBC etc. I choose FOX, WATI, conservative talk radio.
Biden seems to have done fine. A distinguished congressional career spanning decades. Well respected VP, both in the United States and abroad. Presidential candidate. Soon to be president. And he’s a good and decent man. Yep - Joe’s done alright... #BidenHarris2020
Beau Biden did not have to go to Iraq. He was DE Atty Gen'l. Bob Mueller is a decorated Vietnam vet. If you vote for a coward, you might as well be one yourself.
Clearly messing with mail-in-ballots is the real issue, but I Trump is also sabotaging the mail to prevent by Biden Harris T-shirt from getting here promptly.
I hate Harris so much, I'll never vote for Biden.  This week I realized Trump can win again.  I see the stupid Obama-Clinton   running the same failed campaign as in 2016.   #NeverKamala
I know republicans don’t believe in polls, for good reason, but there are strong indications that it’s gonna be a landslide win for democrats. I’d rather be Biden in the lead by 11 than Trump down by that much. You can only pull off so many miracles when you don’t believe n Jesus
The tRump scum, bag man, that is heading up the USPS should be charged with election fraud by the Biden Administration
and... we're supposed to trust #MailInBallots??? WTH?  Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake  via
Everyone except me? I ALONE!!  I watched interview clip and an interview w/ Barnet. I think the “are you a junkie?” question was a continuation of his hypothetical. But, I like Biden. You have your preference. I have mine. The original post was on trump’s lies not Biden’s brain.
The Simpsons say VOTE FOR BIDEN
Joe Biden lying again... what a shock.
It was a solid press conference, now let’s have the Biden team answer some unscripted questions
The Dems were asking people to vote woke three times in a row, and since the economy wasn't tanking anymore, in 2016 the voters could react. This time a Biden/Harris vote is only about 1/3 woke. People can handle that.
Biden's campaign was in the toilet without any electors &amp; then Obama &amp; the DNC stepped in. I didn't like him in '88 &amp; I still don't.
Great news about silent majority: My daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers. She’s a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse. She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said President Trump.
Do you remember the Obama campaigns?   You could see vast support in places beyond Twitter.   I see it now, but not for Biden.   Biden and McCain signs are 1 in the same.
Ever seen a Biden yard sign?   Yea me neither.
Look at the little CNN, MSNBC puppets...no questions for Biden or the other one.
Nixon was more liberal than Obama, and president my boss was more liberal than biden...
Defeating trump and letting Biden become President for 8 years is an equal if not greater threat because it’s more long term. I don’t get what you’re not getting
It's temporary and who's wishlist is UBI on?   During primary the Democrats HATED the idea of UBI.  The liberal media literally ignored him, called him wrong name, showed pictures of random Asian guy claiming he was Yang.  If UBI was on wishlist Yang would be nom, not Biden.
Vote for Biden/Harris he’s not going to be a dictator, trump is‼️
I saw a Biden 2020 thin blue line sign today in someone’s front yard.  I almost crashed my truck
I'm envisioning the ad where Republicans (many formerly of this administration) endorse Joe Biden one by one - Rex Tillerson, John Kelly, James Mattis, Colin Powell.  Can we make that happen?

In CA, OR and CO, no matter how the people vote, those states will go to Biden.
President Trump  CREATED the biggest economic expansion in history. Lowest unemployment f/all in history.  Brought manufacturing back to the USA. Trade Deals! America First!  Obama/Biden=FAILURE. Economic disaster. Foreign policy disaster.  Harris &amp; Biden: Serial LIARS.
Huh? SS has spent over 400k annually on his golf trips. Him paying himself with GVMT $ negates the "not receiving pay"  I'm not voting Biden, I can't stand the current left politicians, but I'm also not a moron that falls for Trump's BS.   Keep being a blind follower, you do you.
Joe Biden is not fit to be president..he hides in the basement and all you idiot's speak for him. You are just using his name with the help of his wife..you should be ashamed of yourself. Talking about Bo...the one thing he has left to remember and you used it.
Biden and Harris our coming for our guns while calling for refunding the police. I'm out, Trump it is.
I'm being an adult and not voting for Biden.
How am I toxic for responding to your claim?   Also, I’m not a Bernie Bro, but a registered independent.   Like most independents, I don’t like the choices, but between Biden and Trump, the choice is obvious.
Would a dog wear pants like this? (Trump) Or like this? (Biden)
Pay attention Colorado, Wyoming, NM, MT, PA, OH, WV... Biden/Harris will KILL oil and gas.
The US Postal Workers Union just endorsed Joe Biden
The US Postal Workers Union just endorsed Joe Biden. 🤣🤣
Can you imagine Biden doing an interview with anyone where he wasn’t tightly controlled,  much less someone who will ask tough questions?   His brain would melt down.  Don’t know how much longer they can keep up the charade.
Biden gave us Clarence Thomas 🙃
Yup and Harris will take over if elected and Palosi will be VP.Biden will probably announce his retirement on Jan. lol.
What it really sounds like is you are voting for Biden, and I don't like neoliberals!
Twitter/Social Media is always toxic, however the “Biden and/or Kamala isn’t who I wanted but we HAVE TO vote for them” and the “you can’t criticize them!! they’re our only hope!” is gross
Maxine Waters says Biden 'can't go home' without Black woman as VP - Business Insider
Babbling Biden and Kumalot will remove 100,000 a day.
Biden and Harris are all about confiscating guns and lobbing the softball term "mandatory buyback". So they don't want the police to protect us and they don't want us to protect ourselves. I'm Out, #Trump2020
Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
Biden was VP for eight years and has spent his life in Congress. He knows the countries. He had a press release yesterday naming them and the limitations of the deal Trump "negotiated."
The Postal Workers Union just endorsed Joe Biden. 🤣🤣
Seriously Biden has to dial this back or Trump will crush him and idiot libs won’t understand why.
lol when did Biden say he would be one term lololol I swear
Perhaps why they’re having so much trouble framing Biden...not your typical “liberal elite”, so the canned attacks fall flat.
Biden and Harris actually know what their doing
#thanksobama and yes Joe Biden will be the fist President to rebuild a better economy for a second after being being VP when it was done the 1st time! All trump has done is ride on Obama's coattails and try to take credit for the things Obama has already done.. trump is a loser
Biden just said him and Obama were responsible for the peace deal between Israel and the UAE that was signed yesterday. These two idiots really need to get their stories straight.
It's not about beating Trump, it's about UHC, jobs, housing, and peace. Biden-Harris have nothing to do any of these. The party needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.

Of course, the odds right before the election more closely reflect polling average, where the odds now factor in three months of uncertainty. Bush in 2000 squandered a bigger August lead than Biden's.
But to point out the obvious. If he does not concede, his followers will stand behind him. Many of them have guns. Most, probably. They also make up the majority of LEOs, military, secret service, etc. It could take more than just "swearing in Biden" for transfer of the office.
even the vaccines not a cure dumbass 😂 so please put your plastic bag on your head and sit the fuck down 😂 yeah.. and you think Trump is going to be out of office in November? Biden had no chance even before he chose Kumswallah Harris as his running mate 😂 now it's a
“But Kamala is a cop and Biden votes for the Crime Bill.”
I do understand that.. maybe you’re not comprehending that I’m not a trump supporter nor am I supporter of Biden because I support the people that make this country run, not just rich people. I don’t know why you care so little
When will Biden answer questions?
Tweet saved for when Biden/Harris push your shit in
All I have is a high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way. Maybe the undereducated would be more likely to vote “left” if you assholes weren’t so goddamned condescending.
Venture way -- way -- behind the BFF bonhomie between #Biden and #Obama in this excellent  trip thru their complex friendship and the affiliated fault lines.  And yeah, Alex also gets big points for "BFF bonhomie"
I have high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way.
If the race does not start to tighten in the coming months, will the forecast start to favor Biden more? I’d like to hear Nate’s thought about that.
Awesome. 832 days till Biden's retirement party.
I love how Trump bashes Biden for not taking questions, yet Trump might take the question but not answer it.
Dude. You’re funny. Biden can barely function. Trump is the only one that can get it DONE
I would like to see a #Biden campaign ad that is just a compilation of  gutting Trump officials during hearings. #BidenHarris2020
Biden trying to take credit. Why?
Biden does not like Harris and Harris does not like Biden. It was obvious 3 days ago. He can't even operate his phone cause it was upside down. It is a disgrace and a sham show.
Trump gets tough questions from the media, Biden has not been asked one tough question yet. Biden tries to take credit for the mid east peace talks and how does that happen when he has been in the basement forever. Unbelievable. And the Dems think he can win that way.
As the article notes: "If the court agrees, that could increase the likelihood that the results of the presidential race between President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden won’t be known for days after the election."
Come on, you gotta admit there is nothing exciting about Biden. And Camel Toe was so exciting she finished last in the primaries and one of the first to drop out.  The Democrats didn’t even like her 🤣🤣🤣
Yes I’m going to vote for Biden/Harris because I live in a swing state. Yes I think it’s incontrovertibly true that they have used their careers to make the world a worse place and they both deserve the wall. Yes I think voting for them makes me complicit in doing evil.
“Ballot Handlers Endorse Biden”  This is fine.
Biden is a pedophile
I can't...had to stop watching...nothing but lies, lies and more lies...I am so frustrated...I was so happy when Biden announced Harris....I hate this motherf*cking rollercoaster ride....😟😟😟

The only people attracted to the Left are BLM and Antifa sympathizers. Biden has lost the moderates and swing votes and maybe even the black vote.  It’s already over. We didn’t believe the fake news in 2016 so why would we believe them now.
It is about my rights! Joe Biden is a civilian, just like me. He's not a policy maker, just like me. Fear mongering &amp; stepping on my toes to move his agenda is 100% about my rights. I comply with wearing a mask inside if I am going to be within 6 feet of others but not outside!
get in the same boat with the rest of us, and let's row back to shore, because we are way out in the deep end with no captain. vote for Biden/Harris because at least they aren't criminals should be their 2020 campaign tag line.
You know they won’t. Only cover for cowering Biden the fool. The media is dead and it’s just all Yellow Journalism.
And you think Biden will open pandoras box in allowing previous presidents to be imprisoned???? Every living president deserves to be in jail, including president "my boss"...
So now Biden is anti-windows and anti-steak knives?
and Biden didn't just vote for the Iraq war himself, he's even more culpable as he also whipped other Dem Senators into voting for it.
I actively voted for Sanders and contributed to his campaign. I’m passively voting for Biden.
I voted for Sanders in the primary. I’m not out here vote shaming anybody. I stated why I am choosing to vote for Biden because of the people in my family and community who are immigrants, low wage workers, and rely on social welfare. I don’t have your ideological purity
I agree. I also don’t like Biden or Harris. But I’ve never liked any presidential candidate I have voted for.
We so very much need to come together &amp; FIGHT tRump &amp; help people vote SO I HOPE WE ALL FOLLOW EACH OTHER OUT OF  SOLIDARITY TO HELP ELECT JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA HARRIS!
The spin machine will not accept that the left bashed President Trump for his brave decision to shut down travel &amp; months later agree it was a good decision. That would have been 2 more months of exposure if Hillary was at the helm and Joe Biden would not even be a consideration!
yep, saw a dude this morning arguing that “voting against the iraq war was seen as an act of treason” to justify why biden voted yes
Joe Biden was a WONDERFUL VP for President Obama! HE WILL BE A POTUS FOR ALL OF US! #BidenHarris2020
how’ve they been faring under biden and kamala?
The burden of proof lies with the one making the outlandish claim my dude. I don’t need to prove Biden is or isn’t anything. You do. And you can’t because all you have are made up conspiracy theories bred on message boards.
#Trump2020LandslideVictory  The exchange of embassies between Isreal and the UAE is a demonstration of Trumps negotiating ability.  For those that claim that he is beligerant Trump has a plan.  That plan required going against the established doctrine of BIDEN, OBAMA CLINTON.
I can't watch the news or news commentary (Fox News, MSNBC, CNN) without getting furious. I hate Trump and I hate Biden....there's no one to root for. That is a hollow, fucking, feeling. #Biden2020 #Trump2020, #BidenHarris2020, #TrumpPence2020---#NoMatterWhoWinsAmericaLoses

If Joe Biden was a Republican he would have been selling insurance by 1975.  This is presidential material??
Have you watched Trump speak lately? And you think Biden is the one in cognitive decline? You may want to reevaluate why you believe what you believe. Do you believe it because of evidence, or just because Trump told you too. Trump has serious cognitive issues.
Vote for Biden.  Do you still want a country worth fighting for
Need to since Biden has no energy.

If you regret voting for Trump, what have you got to lose if you vote for Biden.

If you live in Massachusetts vote your conscience. But please vote for Ed Markey in the democratic primary.  (Still, for immigrants, unions, and the environment Biden is demonstrably better).
Not voting for Biden/Harris because they are “insufficiently liberal” when Donald Trump is the only other option is INSANE.
Vote Biden.  It is your best chance for the healing of America.
They aren’t in terms of views but if you are telling me right now that one party is better than the other and that trump is better than biden or vice versa then you’re wrong
I don’t like either party, I think both Trump and Biden are horrible candidates to represent the United States.
I always let you look at those press meetings instead of me having to do so. I’ll always wait for Biden and Harris’ pressers now.

I am so confused by this whole “America will be gone forever if you vote for Biden” line. What’s he gonna do, bring back the post office?? Is this line working on people? He’s literally been in govt his whole life...you know...in America...
Me talking to anyone and everyone about voting for Biden/Harris in November
The internet is undefeated. They think we’re stupid. #Hypocrisy

If Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are “the radical left,” then I’m Che Guevara.  This failed education system is so annoying.  Imagine actually believing right-wing media.
Biden...don't overthink...
How Significant Is #KamalaHarris As Biden’s VP Pick?
The internet never forgets. They think we’re stupid.
Vote Biden. Get the crazy out.
Pence went on to say that he would beat Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, shouting "I'm going to beat their ..." before being led offstage by a handmaiden.
People make it sound like protest and lower class frustration will just go away if Biden is in office. If he doesn’t give us what we want why would we stop? At least he’s not going to ghost an entire country like Trump.
And at least Biden has the decency to clarify and apologize for a comment that came out wrong. Your dude just double and triples down on his racism
Vote for Biden.
Trump can win this - don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise.
The ticket that matches me ideologically: Sanders- Warren.   The most powerful potential ticket against Trump: Warren- Buttigieg.  The ticket we got: Biden- Harris.   ...K.
Vote for Biden Harris
right 🤣 Biden is ahead of Trump 🤣
It's weird right? The world is trash right now and suddenly the bots (and Trump) are pretending Biden is the incumbent to blame it all on him.
The “suburban housewife” will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge! -Donald Trump
I don’t like mandatory voting bc I don’t agree it’ll produce results that better reflect the will of the people—ppl who don’t want to vote will just troll vote or vote thoughtlessly. It’s probably not the end of the world as long as I still have the option not to vote for a Biden
I will never forget that Obama/Biden left Otto Warmbier.
Too many of us are complacent when Dems are in power. If Biden gets elected, it’s our job to hold him accountable through direct action, public art, letter writing, calling, and actual activism (as opposed to snarky memes and twitter hashtags).
Colorado for Biden's virtual convention watch party will be hosted by two people who, as far as I can tell, have no connection to Colorado: Alyssa Milano, the actress, and Hilda Solis, a former labor secretary. #copolitics
Biden 2020: I'm Not As Blatant!
The mullahs in Tehran are soiling themselves with the Israel/UAE peace accord announcement. Thank you President Trump. You accomplished what OBAMA &amp; BIDEN could not.
Yeah, I think Congresswoman Chaney tweeted something like that, about the  Biden-Harris ticket, and I thinking "how out of touch." Harris is the darling of Wall St
Dear Joe Biden: Here’s the data, now it’s time to embrace marijuana legalization  via
Vote for Biden.
which is rare in healthy economic times, we pay down our debt. Trump was impeached because of his corruption in Ukraine seekimg an investigation on Biden. The corruption in this administration should be enough to make for you to smell how much funkier the swamp has gotten 2)
We aren’t going to do what? OMG Biden/Harris has those fools all discombobulated 😂 #BidenHarris2020
We are not voting our way out of this problem. Biden will fix NONE of this - do you honestly think voting magically gives you a smooth, legal transfer of power?  You ignored every stolen election, including in 2016. It was a coup. I said it out loud then, ya’ll called me crazy.
Where were you when our rights were stripped away by the Patriot Act? (Which Biden helped write)?   Where were you when the Obama admin orchestrated brutal police violence against Occupy?  Where were you when people were brutalized at Standing Rock for a pipeline that is leaking?
Truth. I haven't been excited about Biden since he announced his run.
The Ds were told in advance about covid too, and all they did was sell their stocks. Would Biden have handled this slightly better? Probably. Would we still have 60 million unemployed and 30 million homeless? Probably.
Highly recommend y’all click the link &amp; read some good reasons why we should vote for Biden even though he &amp; Harris are not the ideal ticket. This election is your chance to help save the country &amp; also the world! (Words &amp; shirt by
I pledge allegiance. To the flag. And to vote for Joe Biden on November 3rd.  Amen.
It’s the Putin active measures disinformation operation, drug deal, that he, Trump, Graham, Durham, Grassley, Johnson and Giuliani are cooking up to hurt Biden. WE THE PEOPLE AREN’T BUYING THEIR SNAKE OIL‼️We are flying 35K ft.  above this insidious operation and see it clearly‼️
The fact that Biden isn't +30 or more shows just how stupid our populace really is.
HEY TO ALL PATRIOTSTHAT SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION, THE 2ND AMENDMENT, THE MILITARY  AND OUR VETS, THE SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY.   JOE BIDEN AND KAMILA HARRIS  PLAN TO RAISE 1 BILLION DOLLARS FOR THEIR ELECTION THROUGH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS.   KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.

"Meanwhile on Bizarro Earth, GOP backs claim that it's Biden  who doesn't understand science."
I'm voting to get Trump out of office even if Joe Biden announces he will ban propane and propane accessories.
Those speaking of a #ClimateCrisis, don't really know what they are talking about. This includes Joe Biden, Al Gore,  etc. non-scientists. Global temperature has increased ~0.5 C over the last 40 years, and only ~0.2 C over the past 22 yrs. That's a fairly stable #climate!
Will Biden do something about the shower heads. We can’t forget the shower heads.
That’s the point. They tell us he’s a huge threat, only voting Dem will save America! While they clap sideways, tear paper, &amp; vote FOR his judges, budgets, surveillance powers, Space Force. Impeach ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. Why are they enabling the “worst threat ever!!”?
So on the short term, nothing. If we somehow win this election, do you think Biden, Pelosi, or Schumer are going to allow investigations and prosecutions, or is it going to be a 2009 “time to turn the page” redux?
This! #AngelaDavis on voting for Biden.
The healthcare expansion debate is more nuanced and incapable of tweeting about. I am just not spooked by the idea Biden is a closet leftist. Doesn’t match the reality I see. Doesn’t match how actual leftists feel about him.
I can’t believe what a MONSTER your uncle  is‼️I know he used Russia in 2016 to help win, but now he’s trying to destroy the Post Office to win with Louis DeJoy’s help! He admitted it on Fox! He can’t stand that Biden is beating him in the polls. #BidenHarris2020
That was Quick! Joe Biden Is Already Outsourcing Jobs - His Facebook Page Is Managed in the UK  via
Joe Biden Introduces Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) As Running Mate  via
Disgraceful act by the Democrat inspired domestic terrorists. This is the America that the Biden/Harris team want for all Americans. Vote Trump/Pence and Republican in November. Restore law and order and save our constitutional democracy.
I'm voting to get Trump out of office even if Joe Biden announces he will ban beef and beef by products.
I'm voting to get Trump out of office even if Joe Biden announces he will immediately ban fracking.
At this point, the entire GOP has BECOME Trump.  So if you want to restore integrity to our country, your only choice is Biden/Harris.
I'm voting to get Trump out of office even if Joe Biden invites Greta Thunberg to be a roommate in the White House.
Vote for a better undivided America.  Vote Biden
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
their venn diagrams are a circle, cuz that’s the point - not that obama was worse than romney, that he was the fucking same. same goes for biden/trump. you need to work on your reading comprehension
I disagree,  With  Biden has chosen to NOT alienate many former  voters. Correct, his voting block is a lock, but he needs US to push him over the edge. A #Socialist would have blocked that.
Less so than Trump's collision course with history. As I alluded to, with Biden we at least have a fighting chance to survive. Trump and republicans are an unmitigated disaster. Vote strategically, think long term. Vote your values locally where they especially count.
Appears to show? I hope Biden/Harris are working on police reform right now.
Biden/Harris do not have a solution. Sanders/Warren/Castro are nursing the divide in Texas, hoping O'Rourke never becomes accepted as a national figure. This is what gerry mandering and urban enclaves do. They nuture extreme positions in both parties.
Show me where in the Biden/Harris policy they mention any of the things you’re listing? They’re not there.
Yep, that's weird to me too. But Dem/Rep is some not sort of mirror-opposite pair. We the People at least have a voice with Dems. Republicans serve *only* the wealthy with "trickle down" as their solution to everything. Next POTUS will be Biden or Trump. Choose strategically.
Also worth noting Biden/Harris aren’t Sanders/Warren
I'm there.  Going to the Post Office this morning for stamps for my Biden/Harris postcards.
Biden has no idea what he is saying. If he’s not told what to say, he goes off on Grandpa Simpson-esque tirades that make no sense
As I said before, TX 3 is very much in play. We have Biden up 2 there (Trump won by 14 in ‘16 but Beto got with 3) and Van Taylor is only at 43%.
Biden/Harris 2020: Fuck cows (apparently)
I tried to imply that the people had voted him in.  People can’t be voted out, only in......and Biden isn’t getting voted in lol
wait so tr*mp literally admitted he’s trying to defund usps so ppl can’t mail in ballots and you STILL won’t vote for Biden? Smh 🤦🏼‍♀️
Fox Host Vaguely Predicts Biden Death Before Election -- "I just have this feeling that Joe Biden isn't going to be on this ticket. I have a sense that something is going to happen before the election..."

Maybe if Biden could win, but only by &lt; 1 mil votes so he could see how bad he sucks.
So, here we are. Congress is in recess and Trump is actively sabotaging the USPS and spreading lies about Biden and Harris. How do “we” prevent him from stealing the election? Is this not a clear and present danger?
I feel bad for anyone who believes Kamala Harris will do anything to move Joe Biden on any issue----he wouldn't have picked her if that were the case..........but hey, allow yourselves to be duped again-------everyone for themselves at this point. #BidenHarris2020---a joke ticket
Stop perpetuating a total lie. He NEVER said that. Go give Biden his pudding.
This is troubling. She has the right to her opinion, but this comes across as an endorsement for Biden.  Both parties do good, both do bad. What does she think about Biden / Harris stance on abortion?
Everybody who hates the Corporate Democrats? You know, the over powerful Clintons, Obamas, Pelosi, Schumer?   This is the same attitude that got Trump into the WH 4 years ago.   I hate Harris so much, I don't care if Trump wins this time, too.  I won't vote for him or Biden.
How long before Trump goes full Putin and arrests Biden?
The Biden/Harris ticket is like an incomplete round of antibiotics. It’ll kick the immediate problem away while creating conditions for further escalation. “Anybody but Trump” won’t go very far come 2024.
Wait till he goes full Putin and arrests Biden.
Agree, lesser of two evils. But the fetus has no voice, we need to be the voice. Democrats have shown for decades that there is no budging on their pro-abortion position. Biden claiming to be Catholic yet pro-abortion? Respect human life begins with the fetus.
That being said, I will continue to drag biden &amp; the dnc for not supporting #MedicareForAll. We are in the middle of a pandemic, people are losing their jobs &amp; insurance. Private insurance makes NO FUCKING SENSE.
biden - do you mean equalize pay for women of ALL races?
My absolute favorite the other day was a friend shared a post calling out Biden and Trump and I commented about voting third party. And another friend was like “hOw Do YoU kNoW sHe’S nOt gUiLtY EiThEr” like shut the fuck up. Where’s your proof?
He is the one that is scared. Trump is terrified about Biden winning, and I am sure his deals with Putin is a big part of it
And how is that different from you saying you don’t want to vote for Biden because of what some of his supporters say to you?
Commissar Biden’s latest dictate is outrageous and not based on research. It’s totally political and a foretells what he and Harris would do as POTUS and VP. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional democracy. MAGA
My point is this: You can go ahead and vote for Biden but the blood on your hands won't make you sleep any better. I'll fight anyone of you.
Awesome article with good quotes contrasting styles between the two. Fascinating study in leadership, relationships and frayed bonds.
I don't like it at all. Trump has no problem going left during a pandemic. He can pull it back though. Biden can't.
#Kamala and #Biden don’t want to take your guns, they want to take guns from you all!
Biden has been in public office for 48 years, he should have a message and gave taken questions.

Biden and Harris want to lower your taxes, let you keep your health plan, and send your utility bills through the ground.   That’s  for the people.  It’s for everyone.
If Donald Trump supports UBI and Medicaid until the rest of the year he will destroy Biden and his neo-con agenda.
Biden/Harris is the least progressive ticket I’ve ever seen. They might as well be republicans.
I'm unfollowing anybody who supports Biden/Harris or Trump.
They are smarter than that Seattle will still vote Biden, might even get some people to give up houses.  Homeless group moved into a vacant house in 2010, had a for rent sign, city wouldn't allow eviction.

Hey Dan have you noticed all the new tweets that are Biden/Harris campaign related? It is a smear campaign of lies. I have been deleting a lot of tweets. It’s horrible, all the lies about Trump.
Trump didn't steal 2016 He got more electoral votes  The Dem Party doesn't understand why they lost  The Dem Party DID steal the nomination from Bernie in 2016 and again this year  Biden doesn't attract Latinos, youth, and most Bernie supporters  So sorry  Trump will win again

Will do! Biden Harris 2020!
I'm not sure 4 years of Biden-in-a-stupor and psycho Harris would be an improvement. Different, but very bad in it's own way. Then, we'd have psycho Harris as Dem nominee in 2024 . .  I don't see how those 2 are going to do anything I care about like M4A or shuttering prisons.
Biden has also been accused by 8 different women of inappropriate behavior. His son is liked to Ukraine scandal. He is also a racist. Same person different packaging.
Lol there is 0 chance that corpse Biden wins
Joe Biden is poised to unveil his vision for the modern Democratic Party in the first presidential nominating convention of the coronavirus era. The Democratic National Convention formally begins Monday.
"'This [Trump's attack on USPS] is an assault on our democracy &amp; economy by a desperate man who’s terrified that the American people will force him to confront what he’s done everything in his power to escape for months – responsibility for his own actions.'"  Biden camp
No you weren’t Dave. You’ve been saying for months you won’t.   Again, you have two choices: Biden or Trump. The other choices, don’t vote, write in, or 3rd party are meaningless. They won’t accomplish anything, especially at this point.   Choose Trump or Biden. Pick one.
Lies. First of all, job growth dropped by 50% from last month. Also, almost all of those jobs were jobs that existed prior to the pandemic. (Obama/Biden *actually CREATED 3 million jobs according to the *actual Department of Labor.) ...unless, of course, you mean gravediggers.
Ryan, you have 5 options:  1. Trump 2. Biden 3. Don’t vote 4. Vote 3rd party  5. Write in  1 and 2 are the only realistic options, like it or not. 3-5 not only won’t cause any systematic change, it will be utterly useless, wasteful, and pointless. The options are 1 or 2.
You realize if you want ranked choice voting the best chance for that is Biden right? Wake up and vote!
Get off Twitter you're helping Trump by not volunteering for Biden.
The presidential race is only one of many. Very meaningful work can be done locally. So the answer is always now. As for the next president, unfortunately it is again a two-party race - Biden or Trump. So vote Biden to fight another day. Trump is on a very destructive course.
You know damn well Biden is not lying... he dont even know what the fuck he is saying...
Vote for Biden then promote someone you like better for the next election.
I think I would Fain is Elizabeth Warren called me she's my hero I was always for her in the primaries ever somehow I knew once Biden got in that Biden was going to take it what does it say about our country when two old men have ego enough to run for president?
Am I the only one who thinks Biden is running for President of the U.S. and Diaper Donny is running for class president in middle school?
Biden/Harris failed to discuss anything about the need for increased focus on maximizing the availability of widespread, cheap, rapid, and frequent antigen testing, the existing technology that would enable schools, businesses, and other public spaces to open safely.
I keep hearing how Biden is so great at getting, processing, and making decisions based the advice of experts. This ridiculously lacking expression of current priorities leaves me with zero confidence in his abilities in that regard.
How can this be the culmination of Biden's effort to express pandemic policy improvements based on expert advice??!!!  This statement isn't slightly accurate based on the science.   #expertbiden #biden2020 #bidenscience #masksoutside #Unity2020 #anotheroption2020 #2020otheroption

Biden should demand equal time and threaten to never sit for an interview during his presidency with any network that doesn’t comply.
Sounds like you people are afraid of her! It doesn’t matter who Biden picked as his VP you all would be saying the same about them too. You provide such a blanket statement and can’t even give one reason why. You people are getting #pathetic
Ok fine let’s play politics. He couldn’t get everybody on board because joe biden and the democrats were calling him racist and Xenophobia for shutting down travel to China. Nancy pelosi encouraged everyone to go out as she was seen at a mass gathering in Chinatown in late feb.
Nixon was investigated for years.  It was a rush job to force a focus onto Biden. The Mueller Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election did in fact find interference via the IRA and GRU but I know you don't care

Has Biden ever taken questions? Lolllllll what are you talking about
No it’s not. If trump wins, we have only 4 more years of trump, and then we get a new election with 2 new candidates. If biden wins, we have 4 guaranteed years of Biden, probably 4 more after that, and he will do nothing that entire time. Stop letting yourself be fooled
Lies! Is that all you do is lie. Can’t you say the truth ever. Your moron supporters might believe you but intelligent people know how to research and look at Biden’s plan. At least he has a plan you say you have plans but never provide detail cause your last and you lie.
Biden didn’t suffocate the economy from 2008-2016. Under Trump the economy has COLLAPSED. You really think it’s more likely for Trump to improve the economy for a first time than it is for Biden to reach economic success again? #CTE
Maybe Biden can wear a dress, got hairy legs like Carmeka
Joe Biden if his debates are good
Wait...... there's *actually* a scenario in the  model where Biden wins Nebraska's 3rd District???  I want to see that map!! 🤣 It would potentially be a 538-0 map. NE-3 is the reddest electoral vote in the country.
Don’t forget Biden and his groping of little girls on camera. Not so long ago.
Trump being bad does not make Biden a better choice. They are both terds, you can choose which POS you choose to polish. I choose liberty. Dr Jorgensen earned my vote. No amount of one being worse than the other would ever make me vote for either of them. #VoteGold2020
I really need my very few but still extant conservative friends who in no way support Trump that the choice is binary and your country really needs you to vote for Joe Biden and Ds down the ticket. We have Huns to defeat. Writing in "Abe Lincoln" isn’t going to slay Atilla.

The context in which Biden uses the N-Word twice can’t be denied - it’s very degrading.  Curious if Obama ever saw this.
Biden was in some form of office from 1972-1016. During his vice pres. he had dem. control of both houses for 2 years. Why was he unable to accomplish these and all the rest of the things he says are “long overdue”🤔Must be those people that want to put people in chains?

Learn how elections work. Also, considering Black voters were a big part of Biden getting the nomination, you're racist. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk
And a vote for Biden...is a vote AGAINST Trump.  If anyone is struggling with their decision.
Kamala Harris! Joe Biden’s pick for VP. Wow! Now that duo is much more like the America I know &amp; love than Trump &amp; Pence &amp; the weird, thuggish, self-interested, corrupt Trump’s America that has failed the American people &amp;undermined our democracy &amp; standing in the world. #Kamala
Biden admin will certainly be going after rats and snakes.
Biden wants masks outside! Fortunately Sleepy Joe is just a citizen, same as me &amp; has no power to mandate anything. Just like me. Let elected officials make rules &amp; you just get led around and let them tell you what you believe. You gave up your agenda for Bernie and AOC. So sad!
Did  realize he got thrown under the bus by his own party? Talk of the empty chair puppet. Is he really going to drop out late? Does the other near 80 year old white guy step in? Already pushing his agenda. Or does the false Indian jump in? Sad when Biden seems centrist.
Tell the Truth You Cu:t you know Biden is loosing his Mind  &amp; the Witch Kamala the Cu:t will get the president seat were not dumb!
Fortunately Sleepy Joe Biden is just a citizen, same as me and has no power to mandate anything. Just like me. Let elected officials make rules and you just get led around and let them tell you what you believe. You gave up your agenda for Bernie and AOC. So sad!

All these “Bernie bro’s” &amp; so called leftists now trying 2make the case 4 Kamala/Biden were never really leftists. Y’all are proving (like sell out politicians) you’ll cave 4crumbs. You’re frauds &amp; if you dare gaslight lefties, you’re more garbage than libs! Sell outs, shame!
He's neither a threat or out of control. He had an interesting platform and completely blew it by endorsing Biden so early and the DNC have nothing to worry about with Yang anymore. He fucked up.

Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris both said that they are going to rase income tax fees, confiscate our Guns and further rule us under the table.  They are lying to America now and it will get worse latter on.  Please think before filling in the box or pulling the handle.
Heaven forbid we might save 40,000 lives by wearing a mask for 3 months  U already bear the responsibility for killing 170,000, I guess this is nothing to U  U failed from day 1 of this pandemic,   &amp; U failed to uphold your oath.
There is so much wrong in this statement, I’m not even going to bother with responding other than to say, Mr. President   YOU ARE WRONG—AGAIN!  Vote Biden/Harris. We can do better in November!
As far as I know it is. I think it was a sarcastic response to reporter’s Q. Biden’s been in the game a long time. He’s got a repore that Trump doesn’t have. Plus, I like him. I’m biased. And I’m cool with other ppl being biased. That’s why I like living here. I like to debate.
Trump is a not representing Republican values and is hurting our nation, and the party has the audacity to call Biden/Harris radical left?
CBS' Errol Barnet, a black man, asked whether Joe Biden had taken a cognitive test.  Biden responded that it was like asking the interviewer if he had taken a test for cocaine use.  Some folk felt it was racist.  Some felt it was a sarcastic answer.
When Biden takes over the presidency it’s gonna be like when I would come into work in the morning at Starbucks after the closing shift spent all night shooting the customers in the face with military-grade weapons instead of making whipped cream
What was the context of that question? What did the reporter ask? What was Biden’s full response?
Joe Biden promised a 100-day deportation halt during the primary. It’s not in his platform.  by
Not yall screaming fuck the police for the past 3 months, then hopping on here celebrating Biden and Harris lmaooo make it make sense
nobody (on the left) is arguing that biden's handling of the protests will be good but what we do know is that obama never deployed secret gestapo vans to sporadically kidnap people off the streets and we can be cautiously optimistic that biden also won't do this

I'm not confident. It's just a suspension of annexation. Biden likes the deal.
that Ed Markey ad from today actually contained a critique of Joe Biden?? He's showing more leadership on this than Bernie, somehow
And how would they enforce their little mandate, exactly?  Exactly.

I really fucking hope Biden wins in November but at the same time I’m afraid to have hope and believe in the electoral college 😭
Realized you misjudged my comment and decided to attack me instead of admit you were wrong. Kamala is gross, her record as AG is horrible. Biden picked her as a token.
Biden made contro comments before the pandemic - recently   now understands need vs. $  The courts and climate are paramount for me personally.  This ticket is a step in that direction.  Our system is fucked, it's a long game to play. GOP better at game, but faultering now
What is the concern with Biden? I am voting with full confidence he won't do shit for four years and that's enough.
I really don’t think people understand that this is literally the endgame. If Biden doesn’t win BOTH Pennsylvania and Michigan he loses, it is as simple as that.   This is a blatant far-right takeover and the people trying to normalize this should never be trusted again.

I registered independent after trump became the nominee, but have switched back for one reason: abortion. Hard to charge the party from the outside. I’ll vote for Biden as a registered Republican not because I agree with his positions but because I consider Trump dangerous

Good one Babbling Biden.  You demonized Trump for closing borders early and Pelosi was advocating to go to China Town like it was a food festival or something. You are a moronic hypocrite.  If you can even remember 1 thing it’s this: YOU WILL LOSE IN NOVEMBER.
Regarding Texas, Biden and Harris have competing interests.
#Hannity in reality this is the "Harris, Biden election"
I think the party of values has grown weary of the man who spouts conservative ideals but uses his bully pulpit to divide and promote decidedly unchristian values. His handling of the pandemic and George Floyd sealed it. Im partially voting Biden because I want my party back.
What part of non-partisan did you not understand. I don't like Biden. They're both pedophiles.

Best Biden quote ever.  What the actual fuck is he going on about and how can anyone in their right mind vote for this fool??
Where is she on abortion? I have not felt the need to look at her because I’m very happy with Trump on abortion. I would never vote for Biden. No candidate is perfect - but that is huge to me.
She is nuts, Biden absent
it's bizarre how many lefties base their entire personality on being mean to people but as soon as someone puts them in their place for their birdbrained "trump iz akshully better then biden becuz accelarationism" take it's back to civility and decorum and respecting opinions
I think you're right. Whoever can say the least will win. And so far Biden's people have him under control better than Trump's.
Biden is maybe the worst candidate for President ever presented to the public. And let's remember, he still hasn't former accepted nor been formerly named as the Presidential nominee. I still think the old switcheroo could be in play. Regardless, Joe's not looking good...
Lets buy stamps. Massively. Sent them back in huge envelopes to the white house with Biden name on it!
yet we get people who still refuse to vote cause they dont like Biden I dont like Biden but hes not a dictator so guess who Im voting for

So Biden discriminated against a candidate for federal office on the basis of race/ethnicity/national origin.
Polls can be reliable. 2018 was a good year. If candidates are within the polls margin of error, much less predictive power, &amp; Race is hard to call with any confidence. The closer the race, harder it is to call. Yes,I love to see polls with Biden beating Adolph Trump!
Biden is guided by real science.
67% of Republican Trump supporters won't tell you they are voting for POTUS. Take the polling and apply that and it turns out to 70% for Trump and 30% biden. Now that makes sense.
You must truly believe your base to be brain dead. Biden isn’t in charge of anything.

Joe Biden has spent his entire life as a career (50 years) long politician who enriched himself &amp; his family.  Owned by China. Racist/Bigot/Plagiarist. Pedophile. Demented.  President Trump won because he LOVES America. Doesn't make a dime. Not owned by anyone. A real LEADER!

Yes, indeed. Obama, Biden, Harris, Pelosi. They work for their Wall Street Donors. You are ignorant of this?  Not the Bernie Sanders people.
Tucker Carlson needs to stop trying to convince me to vote for Biden. 🤣
I do believe it is the other way around. Biden wrote an oped in January stating the virus was coming and POTUS needed to get prepared. tRump ignored scientists and experts. He had dismantled the department and thrown away the pandemic playbook left by the Obama/Biden admin. Liar!

Joe Biden has always had a hair trigger, anger problem.  He is a mean, nasty man.  Now his running mate is the same...mean, nasty.  Both unqualified.

A chunk of the GOP hawks and neocons went neverTrump and are now backing Biden.   Trump has somewhat avoided entanglement in Syria and Russia, a possible improvement on a Clinton presidency, though his positions on Iran and Yemen are concerning from an anti-war perspective.
Trump stands up there and takes all these stupid questions from the press. Biden gets a free pass from any questions from the press. That is why I believe we will not see a debate. The lame stream media is always covering up or apologizing for his stupid Gaffs. Unbelievable.

Its absolutely astounding to me that there are people who will be proud to vote for Biden. I hear you, it's the "only way" to get Trump out, but voting for Biden is a vote for a continuation of the politics that LED to Trump.   It isnt a solution. It's just a different problem.

If you weren't already convinced Biden is an idiot, his mandatory mask idea should finish the job. Masks don't work, and he has no legal authority to force people to wear them. He's a tyrant and a fool.
Ah yes, Biden's conservative agenda:  - Decrim marijuana, expunge past records - public option + cap on premiums and prescription drugs - 3 trillion dollar climate plan - Free 4 year college for those making under $125k - End family separation at border
A mob of rioters preventing ICE from deporting illegal criminal domestic abusers in suburban Oregon is the perfect representation of a Biden/Harris administration.  They'll defend criminals, defund police, and decriminalize illegal immigration.

I voted for piss-poor Democrats for the last two decades, and we keep marching in the wrong direction. Trump is a SYMPTOM not the CAUSE. I will NOT vote for Biden/Harris until they do the very basic minimum of what the “Democrat base” is demanding.

An official at the USCCB said the selection of Senator Kamala Harris as Joe Biden’s presidential running mate is good news that will offer policies favorable to marginalized people.
Biden, to Americans: “It’s not about your rights.”
Great, she can prove it right away. What Hickenlooper, Polis and Biden can't do, shouldn't be a problem for her?
Because, in a utilitarian approach, you as an individual do not matter in this analysis. The greater good matters. If it can be shown that Biden would reduce harm, the consistent approach is to both vote for him and advocate for him.   Otherwise, you're not doing leftism.
Biden has everything scripted for him. He's quite literally an actual PUPPET
At least Biden hasn't caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans
I mean, Biden is to the left of Trump. His policies will be to the left of Trump. His reactions to unfolding events will be left of Trump.   According to every material analysis applied, Biden reduces harm and as leftists, that should be our primary goal.

“Mr. Biden congratulated both Israel and the Emirates in a statement…. ‘I am gratified by today’s announcement,’ Mr. Biden said.”
And if Biden loses because you wanted to court Republicans instead of pay attention to nearly half of your party? If we get four more years of Trump because you took people’s votes for granted while spitting in their eye? I will BLAME. YOU. FOREVER. That’s on YOU.
I get the situation we’re in. The problem is, too many Democrats don’t. Do you think voting for Biden fixes anything? It gets rid of Trump, it leaves all the problems behind.  So when thousands of people die because they don’t have healthcare? Understand: that’s on YOUR head.
Pot calling kettle black. You trolled me. I have my opinion and you have yours. I’m willing to vote Biden to get the orange child out of the WH. Care to argue more? I don’t feel I need to explain to you why. Don’t care about your opinion at all. Bye!

That Emerson College poll of Minnesota (Biden +2%) is more concerning. Wide range of recent MN poll results, tho; average is Biden +5.6%. But  new model has Minnesota surprisingly close to being the "tipping point" state, ahead of WI &amp; MI.  (cc:
Because I am not refuting that. Trump is a pile of shit. The point im making is so is biden.
But polls in deep-blue &amp; deep-red states sometimes seem to understate the margin. And note the 16% for undecided/other! If ~half of those are grumpy progressives who are presently pondering a protest vote because CA is "safe," but will ultimately vote Biden, +28% becomes +36%.
And point of fact, their votes don’t matter in ther slightest. Colorado will go 10+ points for Biden and Denver will be more like 80%. She could vote for the reincarnation of Stalin himself and it wouldn’t matter even one tiny little bit.
The new poll by A+ pollster  showing Biden up by 28% in California ... is actually the most Trump-favorable poll released in the last 9 days.  Clinton won CA by 30%. So a Biden lead of "only" 28% would arguably imply a ~tied national race (and Trump favored in the E.C.)
. today: "I'm not voting for Biden. I'm voting for Harris."
Trump ramps up sexist rhetoric against political rivals  trump has no shame. So I am not  ashamed of voting for Biden. Maybe we can get our country back in order after this disaster of an administration. America deserves better.
New rule: No one is allowed to say ANYTHING bad about Biden or Harris until the Electoral College certifies the election results.
Oh, LOL Not the results u were expecting &amp; hoping for? Why delete a poll with nearly 50k responses &amp; 5 days left? Biden Harris are the exact wrong response to the current state of America. A cop VP to a guy who wants to Increase police funding. #NeverBiden #NeverTrump #REVOLUTION

At this point doesn't Biden just have to tell his supporters not to risk the mail, and go vote in person no matter what plagues might be in the air?
Biden forgot to mention that had the CCP been more honest and taken action three weeks sooner, 95% of this would have been avoided. I wonder why he forgot to mention this?
The world IS laughing at us NOW, thanks to you.  Biden and Harris will bring back respect. #bunkerbitch #impotus
Now so one on the massive amounts of money the teachers union and Planned Parenthood going into Biden and democratic candidate campaigns.
Donald Trump is playing political games with the postal service: deliberately slowing down mail service for prescriptions, small businesses, and to interfere with voting. We must end these attacks on the USPS and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Trump is literally sending in Federal Police to states forcefully, be willing to bet my life savings that Biden/Harris wouldnt be sending Federal Police to antogonize/provoke violent responses from peaceful protesters. They might not defund the police but still be better then now
As the best sister a VP ever had  But unlike the corrupt Trump and company, Biden's administration will avoid even the appearance of impropriety and will not be appointing family members
Extremely sad that the most outstanding feature of Trump and Biden is how prolific they both are at....lying.
Child labor for Biden.
When Biden becomes president and appoints Obama to the Supreme Court, your appeals to your convictions to crimes in office will meet a wall. #BidenHarris2020
Biden is like 2 months behind... Lecturing America on masks? Most people already wear them. Get lost, Joe!
I have cows and I’m voting for Biden-Harris. Moo 🐮
Biden wants to cut emissions 20 years too late, he wants back into the top. He wants sanctions on Russia. I could go on and on...
If not voting for biden is a vote for trump, than not voting for trump is a vote for biden and if you dont vote for either of them than you are voting for both of them, which is voter fraud.
If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America #SmartNews
Biden won't increase minimum wage enough. Biden will continue to use his border cages. Won't continue social security (which poor people really need) Biden want police to "shoot em in the leg" and arrest a political ideology "the old fashioned way". You want this?
yes.....Biden will take all the interviews he can get...MSM ask for an interview....
We don’t share the same goals. You yourself said GP isn’t viable. Agreed. Making them viable requires people vote for them. That’s what we’re doing. You insisting this helps Trump relies on false assumption Biden is entitled to our vote &amp; we are taking away what he never earned
Quite the talk you gave this morning   So, if I heard you correctly, as a woman, I'm more empathetic and will be voting for Biden.  BUT, if I were a man, I'd be voting for Trump because 'men just want to get things done' with Trump.  Quite insulting.
Absolutely nauseating. I cannot wait for president Biden and madame vp Harris to take over
I hope the next Democrat after Biden (don't have much faith that guy is going to do much of anything) that gets in takes the Trump playbook, where you just try to do whatever you want, is put into effect...
Oh I'm with you 100%  I will not be voting for Biden  I think Yang genuinely believes that Biden/Harris is better overall for Americans than Trump/Pence.  So that's why he is so vocal.  It's just opinion at this point, he could be right, or we could be right. Time will tell.
Right. So, as I said earlier, it's time to start thinking about this like we would if it was happening overseas. There's a "pro-democracy faction" led by Biden, and there's an "anti-democratic ruling party" clinging to power.  Dunno what the plan is, but we sure as hell need one.
Endorse Joe Biden.  You did say wrong answers only after all.
'America is crying out for leadership': Harris delivers rallying cry at first campaign event with Biden
O for sure, same.   Im not big on biden, like not at all. Personally i think both sides are just to far out. One side something crazy, then the other tries to 1-up that. I think one thing that would help is being able to vote  all stages of both parties. If i want a true say...
I think he just wants to see improvement in America in regards to the focus and priorities of GVMT.   He can support Biden, Support Trump, Support 3rd party, or stay silent.  Supporting Biden is probably the best way to reach end goal, out of his options. I cant blame him.
Why should anyone left leaning vote for Biden-Harris if they won’t compromise on a single issue that left(along with the majority of democrats support) supports. If they compromise on one issue I’ll vote for them but at the moment their policies are no different from trumps
If you, too, would like to make a #BidenBoatParade, here are my supplies, FYI:  Boats:   Biden flags:  Biden stickers:  Trumper Ducky:  Dolls: um, I have daughters
Anyone that does not vote for Biden/Harris ticket votes for Trump.  I will vote blue no matter who.
You’re absolutely right about that. Biden and Harris will kick you and Pencey out of office in November!
LOL at "Sleepy Joe." There are criticisms of Joe Biden that you could make that I would say "Fair." But "sleepy" is beyond childish and silly. If that's what Trump's going with, I have no doubt that "Sleepy Joe" will eat his lunch for him too. To quote a comic, Trump is going /1
So now that Trump is defunding the postal service I’d way rather donate to the postal service for the #BidenHarris2020 campaign so that I and many others can safely vote for for Biden/Harris   How do we do that? Whose with me?
Obama/Biden destabilized the Middle East.      Supported overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt; installation of Muslim Brotherhood terrorists. Supported overthrow of Quaddafi in Libya; his murder. Did nothing to stop Radical Islam. Abandoned our partner Israel.
Let me get this straight...  If Biden loses, it’s the left’s fault, and if Biden wins it’s because you didn’t need us, right?  I just want to know exactly what to expect.
It is not a death threat. It's just conspiratorial nonsense. She's saying "something" is going to happen and the Dems are going to remove Biden and make Harris the Presidential candidate.  It's fucking stupid, but it's not a death threat.
today, I am going to buy some Biden-Harris gear, likely a t-shirt. I will let you all know how auspicious things look if/when said gear arrives.
Thank you Dinesh.       Kamala Harris is as fraudulent as Obama, as corrupt as Biden.    None is more soul less than Harris.  Her record as prosecutor &amp; senator proves it.....
That is happening now. We were when Biden was in office.
I'm so irritated with Republicans saying the state America is in today is what Biden's America will look like when IT IS LITERALLY TRUMP'S AMERICA.
Bro you sound like Joe Biden 🤦‍♂️😂 how is this proof we are in a simulation
I also make Biden Boat Parades from my daughters' toy ponies, pokemon, etc., and tiny plastic watercraft that I found on Amazon. #BidenBoatParade
Then why the hell did we allow Joe "when I said everything, I meant everything, including Medicare and Social Security" Biden anywhere near it???
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‘should be a great concern to all Christians’  #FoxNews
I always just remind them not to worry because I'm voting for Biden by not voting for Trump since that is apparently how voting works.My names joe biden and...c'mon man. I thought you liked me. #MyCampaignSlogan
Thank you Mitch! Now PLEASE, vote for Biden- not your wife! PLEASE!!!!!!
Dude over here tweaking about this. Typical. Vote Biden 2020
Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
How could this possible be a conflict of interest?  Wink! Wink! look over here there is nothing wrong with #MailInVoting #MailInBallotFraud
Biden who?
They would be asked policy questions and have to explain their current socialist agenda. Biden is currently leading in the polls, why upset the Apple cart.
So now it’s Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, everyone knows Biden is just a vessel for the far left.
Hannity will be whining this guys name like Uranium One. All through the Biden administration. Unlike with trumps friends, he will likely face punishment, and serve his time if convicted.
Trump supporters tell me a third party vote helps Biden. So, which is it?
and... we're supposed to trust #MailInBallots??? WTH?  Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake  via
Biden's campaign was in the toilet without any electors &amp; then Obama &amp; the DNC stepped in. I didn't like him in '88 &amp; I still don't.
Great news about silent majority: My daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers. She’s a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse. She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said President Trump.

Look at this headline. Biden isn't supposed to be president for very long. Soros is trying to put communist Kamala in the Oval Office. NO thank you!

Can you imagine Biden doing an interview with anyone where he wasn’t tightly controlled,  much less someone who will ask tough questions?   His brain would melt down.  Don’t know how much longer they can keep up the charade.
Biden gave us Clarence Thomas 🙃
Biden just said him and Obama were responsible for the peace deal between Israel and the UAE that was signed yesterday. These two idiots really need to get their stories straight.
I always let you look at those press meetings instead of me having to do so. I’ll always wait for Biden and Harris’ pressers now.
The American people respect all the hard work you are doing for our great nation!  Well done President Biden!
The sane Americans stand proudly with President Biden!!
It’s the Putin active measures disinformation operation, drug deal, that he, Trump, Graham, Durham, Grassley, Johnson and Giuliani are cooking up to hurt Biden. WE THE PEOPLE AREN’T BUYING THEIR SNAKE OIL‼️We are flying 35K ft.  above this insidious operation and see it clearly‼️
Biden has been in public office for 48 years, he should have a message and gave taken questions.
Biden and Harris want to lower your taxes, let you keep your health plan, and send your utility bills through the ground.   That’s  for the people.  It’s for everyone.
Biden/Harris is the least progressive ticket I’ve ever seen. They might as well be republicans.
Campaign funds will pay it off, kinda like the funds used to pay the $465,000 that Hunter Biden owed in back taxes last week.
Biden/Harris failed to discuss anything about the need for increased focus on maximizing the availability of widespread, cheap, rapid, and frequent antigen testing, the existing technology that would enable schools, businesses, and other public spaces to open safely.
I keep hearing how Biden is so great at getting, processing, and making decisions based the advice of experts. This ridiculously lacking expression of current priorities leaves me with zero confidence in his abilities in that regard.
How can this be the culmination of Biden's effort to express pandemic policy improvements based on expert advice??!!!  This statement isn't slightly accurate based on the science.   #expertbiden #biden2020 #bidenscience #masksoutside #Unity2020 #anotheroption2020 #2020otheroption
After all the comments on my OMG tweet about golden showers I know one thing for sure; Biden is going to need a new mattress in the White House #Bidenwillneedanewmmattressinthewh
You know Obama/Biden built the cages and put kids in them prior to Trump
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris both said that they are going to rase income tax fees, confiscate our Guns and further rule us under the table.  They are lying to America now and it will get worse latter on.  Please think before filling in the box or pulling the handle.
nobody (on the left) is arguing that biden's handling of the protests will be good but what we do know is that obama never deployed secret gestapo vans to sporadically kidnap people off the streets and we can be cautiously optimistic that biden also won't do this
Is this same guy going to ask Biden and Kamala that, that’s all they have done the last two days.
it's bizarre how many lefties base their entire personality on being mean to people but as soon as someone puts them in their place for their birdbrained "trump iz akshully better then biden becuz accelarationism" take it's back to civility and decorum and respecting opinions

Good 4 Biden
So Biden and Harris have both repeatedly lied since they were introduced yesterday, if they keep it up they should be asked the same question.
the pandemic response under biden is just going to be him shouting "take the vaccine, dummy!" without providing any aid to communities that will inevitably be unable to afford the vaccine🙃
So proud of President Biden and his outstanding leadership!
Trump ramps up sexist rhetoric against political rivals  trump has no shame. So I am not  ashamed of voting for Biden. Maybe we can get our country back in order after this disaster of an administration. America deserves better.

Biden getting ahead of the game with the pandemic. Not even in office yet he is ahead of trump already with the virus. What a stark contrast in briefings.
That didn't take long, just over 24 hours since #Biden announces #Kamala as running mate and dominating the news cycle #Trump drops the hammer and announces major foreign policy win in the #MiddleEast, the #abrahampeaceaccord. What a way to change the narrative of the #newscycle.
If they get there with the electoral college then that’s how the system works. You absolutely can not compare voter fraud to Trump settling on some case. That’s nonsense. Biden is up to his eyeballs in fraud with his family. Thus is about the high potential for voter fraud.
Now do Biden mispronouncing her name several times yesterday, including when he introduced her, does it not matter because he’s an old guy with Dementia or because he’s a Democrat?
They were talking about an article by CNN that literally said Biden might be replaced by Harris at the top of the ticket. Gutfeld had the article with him, reading from it.
Biden mispronounced her name three times yesterday, if your own running mate can’t pronounce it correctly it really shouldn’t matter.
So I guess that makes Biden a sexist since he totally mispronounced her name when he introduced her. 🤡🤡 Has Don Lemon’s sexual harassment suit been resolved yet?
It was just too funny hearing CNN try to demean Tucker Carlson for mispronouncing Kamala‘s name. They reamed him in the very next day Joe Biden said at the exact same way.
buddy really took biden quotes and used them against trump😳😳 shiii he got him
This is what a Biden administration will bring to the country.
Why Sarah Palin Is Trending Ahead of Biden's VP Pick Announcement
I'm sure Biden and Harris will lean real hard into the Bernie wing.
48 of Biden vs 4 years of Trump, I would take Trump all day long.
When Biden does it:  “Oh no.” When Tucker does it:  “Racist!”
prior to having kamala as biden’s vp pick, i was still apprehensive about biden. now, i will actually be excited to vote #bidenharris this november.
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
Do you think Pence believes?  I can't understand how Republicans can attack Joe Biden's character with a straight face.  It is startling.
Bro, all I'm saying is that Biden's team realized why no one has assassinated Trump (because then Pence would become pres, and that could be more dangerous) and went "Joe, we have just the human shield - I mean running mate - for you!"
Joe Biden butchered her name tonight, way worse than Tucker did. 🤡🤡
So "Judge" Jeanine Pirro, what is going to happen to Biden? You must have pulled out a crystal ball from your briefcase.
Women accused Trump. Over 20 of them, one with evidence, one who was 13.  A woman accused Biden. A woman who turned out to be an actual real life liar for hire.  Try another tack.
Are going to teach Biden how to say it correctly? He butchered her name way worse than Tucker Carlson.
“Nothing will fundamentally change” under a biden presidency either.
He absolutely is evil though. Not as evil as Trump, but Joe Biden is not your friend.
I’m no economist...and neither is Trump.  It’s like he’s trying to sell us a timeshare...every fucking day!  Biden/Harris!  Can’t wait!
4yrs + 8yrs = Biden + Harris = 12 yrs BLUE!!!
I couldn't be happier that  is Biden's VP running mate.  The fact that she is from my home state of California makes it even sweeter that she's going to be on the ballot this November.  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020  #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica  #BlueWaveTsunami2020
When is Biden going to take questions or is that all on Harris now?
"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware"
Everyone needs to report Jeanine Piro for threatening Joe Biden. This woman is psycho and dangerous!
Hoping Mary Trump does a virtual rally for Biden / Harris🤣🤣🤣
Go after Biden  Ignore his attack VP.
Hey a$$hole, this is my taxpayer money, it’s not a gift from you! Can’t wait for the big Biden/Harris win in November!
Biden just mispronounced her name, lol
Is anyone tracking how many hours (minutes really) a week Joe Biden is spending in front of cameras or in public in general??

Ah, you’re right! Must’ve missed that part.
Actually it's pretty crowded, Kamala, Biden, Hillary, Obama, etc.
yes Kamala has a shit ton of donors.... and y’all think Biden picked her for any other reason?😂
I follow   and  here on Twitter.  I find it curious that Biden is always in my timeline at the very top and Trump is never in my timeline.

Joe Biden that’s who!
Joe Biden is “radical”?!?!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
It’s time to get some sleep, and I’ll be sleeping much better when Biden/Harris are winning!  #BidenHarris2020Landslide

We Proudly Support Joe Biden.Joe Biden is for improvement. Improvement for ALL Americans.
Ms. McEnany: Consider contrasting Biden/Harris Qs from Cavenough 2019/1991 Thomas hearings with Trump/Pence stand for "innocent until proven guilty." Then ask (voters) "Is this the future Justice system you want?" PClose w/list of 1st T. wins-prison reform, SCOTUS, etc.
What is the number of women that accused Biden of sexual misconduct and how many BJs did she give to win the VP nomination?
Wouldn't it be amazing if she were recognized for her achievements in life rather than the things she had no choice over? The headline should read something like, "Kamala Harris, Senator and Former AG nominated to VP for Biden" Instead her race and gender get top billing.

I bought a T-shirt on the Biden victory page
I was with Rice but the announcement of Harris feels really good today and I’m excited for this Biden/Harris ticket. This is Joe Bidens choice and I support it.
Pretty sure that’s what you said about Obama and Biden. Amazing thing - there’s still a second amendment!
Statement from  Chairman  on Joe Biden's announcement of extremist Kamala Harris as his V.P. #copolitics
Look at this news article from The Daily Caller: ’She Was My Number One Draft Pick’ — Trump Launches Immediate Attacks On Kamala Harris After Biden Names Her As VP
I am so inspired with the Biden/Harris ticket
There is a sweet spot in the Biden cabinet for  😀
Turn off angry, sensationalized cable news and get your election coverage at The Neutral (⁦⁦ No fatigue, bickering, or bias. Just facts and balanced perspective. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
He has the vocabulary of a 5th grade bully. Hope the Dems just let him continue the downward slide while the high road is open for Biden and Harris. The difference between the candidates could not be more evident. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
When Biden wins and his acceptance speech, right before he's done, would it not be amazing for him to say "you're fired"? How sweet would that be!
So? She is? She attacked Biden on segregation and race, she was just a raving lunatic when she went after Kavanaugh. Not sure what your point is? Just because she’s a woman she can’t be criticized?
Yep lol Biden picked a cop and drug warrior as his VP when feelings on the police are at an all time low.
Where can I get a Biden/Harris sign in the Denver area?

I like Bernie &amp; would have voted for him. I meant nothing derogatory against anyone. The fact is I'm well aware we NEED  Bernie's supporters. It's just so many are refusing to vote for Biden, so i thought maybe if they listen to him speak at the DNC we could change their minds.
You should be ashamed if you vote the Biden/Harris ticket.
Trump sure sounded scared! He knows Pence isn’t comparable to Harris at all! And Trump knows that Biden knows more about the US government &amp; US Constitution than he ever will! Trump failed America! #TrumpVirusKillsAmericans, churches, sports, restaurants, vacations, schools, etc!
Never heard of Joe Biden until yesterday, I’m guessing.
Biden/Harris 2020! Perfect Vision!
#Biden picks #KamalaHarrisForVP the one candidate that couldn't make it thru Iowa Primary. Knowing Joe is unlikely to finish 4 yr term  you're voting for #kamala for president. Didn't play well in #Iowa won't play well in the country.
Why is Biden saying she’s going to lead the country in January 2021 if he is elected? Who’s going to be her VP?
Is this the first time you’ve heard of Biden?
please just give me one time where biden calls her michelle by accident
All you've been doing on Twitter is complaining  and whining about Biden and how you hate having to vote for him, and now you're complaining about Harris. I'm sorry, but when democracy is on the line with an opponent like Trump, I'll happily take an honest, caring man like Biden.
Biden/Harris 2020!!!! Time to take out the trash!!!!
is a transformational leader. She is a fighter. She is a uniter, and has always been of, and for, the people. I’d walk through broken glass to cast my vote for Biden/Harris this election #KHive
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate   #SmartNews
Congratulations to  Joe Biden, and most of all the American people! Sen. Harris will be an extraordinary Vice President.
Political news: Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.
I'm old enough to remember when Kamala Harris sold this shirt claiming Biden was a racist.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP, making her the first Black woman on major party presidential ticket.
Harris to be Biden’s choice as VP!  I’m so excited!!!!!
Meanwhile, if you're a Biden supporter, SURE you'd like to see schools open on time BUT you'd ALSO like to see them open IN A SAFE MANNER   In the meantime, EVERYONE would like to see Trump PROVE he's MORE than A MONEY HUNGRY ZOMBIE with a knack for business by SHOWING he CAN be
Trump: 'Some people would say men are insulted' by Joe Biden choosing a woman as VP  trump for one. he is afraid to deal with Nancy Pelosi. The man has yet to meet with her on the relief package. Last time maybe last October? Continues to be a clown.
Trump: 'Some people would say men are insulted' by Joe Biden choosing a woman as VP  trump talking out of his behind again. What a joke for a president.
Just remember this person will be President within 6 months if Biden wins.
Highlands Ranch as a guy ... Cowboy hat, Jeans, Older ... prototypical modern "Cowboy" or farmer or rancher. He stands at the entrance to HR with an American Flag and a Biden (Flag/Poster).  He is there most days during evening "Rush Hour"
So the DNC told Biden who they picked to run for President.
We stand with Joe Biden!
We stand with Joe Biden!
I here Joe Biden was leaning towards Geraldine Ferraro for his VP
Yes. I do still believe that this is the one thing Biden is probably an expert on, so I’ll respect his choice. If it’s Rice maybe he’s seen something I don’t, or he expects the Obamas to supplement.
Biden is a vessel for the progressive left. He has Dementia and has always been dumb, so he has no idea that he is being used.Correction: BLM single handedly donates $48MM to Biden's campaign
While I agree that "Blue No Matter Who" in the presidential race is important, being hostile towards people with legitimate concerns about Biden/Harris isn't going to get them on your side.
I won’t survive it. 😥😥😥. Biden and Harris will win. We will vote even if we have to walk over hot coals or broken glass in our bare feet. We will vote and we will get rid of these criminals!
...and their union with 300,000 members just endorsed #Biden
Oh, I don't just mean interjecting on on political opinions, I mean potentially holding an office in the Biden Administration. Clinton and Biden go back a long way politically.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president #SmartNews
Cool. But how many Trumpers or undecided voters are gonna go "hmm 🤔 you know I never really paid attention to facts before, but now that this Black/Asian-American woman is saying those facts &amp; telling me Mike Pence is wrong, I'm gonna vote for Biden!"
I love the  ads.  has set the bar so low that all Biden has to do is wear a mask and promise to listen to the experts. #ByeDon2020
My names joe biden and...c'mon man. I thought you liked me. #MyCampaignSlogan
Vote like Biden is 10pts down. Don’t be complacent.
If Biden wins every state carried by Hilary and re takes PA, MI and WI then game is over
Possible that if you asked Biden about this he wouldn't remember saying it, but it's still really dark and disturbing
Want me to spell it out? I'm MtF, autistic and with an encroaching physical disability in my spine. If you accelerationists keep Biden out, I die either in the streets or in a prison camp.
You might want to get used to hearing the Clinton name. With Biden potentially winning the Presidency, there is also the potential that Hillary Clinton will re-enter the political arena in some form or another.  Not to bait a rabbit mob responding. but there is the possibility.
Yeah some lawyer nobody has ever even heard of getting a soft slap on the wrist. Hopefully I'm wrong about that outcome. If that is the outcome, Republican Party is dead as dead gets. Deader than Biden. Burnt toast 🔥🔥🔥
I’m not excited about a Biden Harris ticket. And I think people and survivors specifically have their very legitimate reasons for not voting for them. But if Angela Davis can settle for this ticket then so can I. Get in the car girls, we’re settling 🥴
Hunter Biden
Republicans are so scared of a barely moderately-to-the-left Joe Biden that they are willing to dismantle the constitutionally-mandated  to win, and on top of that if we lived in a country that made sense, their party would be disbanded as a punishment.
Thank you Mitch! Now PLEASE, vote for Biden- not your wife! PLEASE!!!!!!
Over thirty million people protested this summer and yet the president could not fill an arena in Oklahoma. Not to dismiss the issue or anything, but I would tend to think Biden turnout will probably still be decisive.
Hey Jimmy, when are you clowns going to Q&amp;A Biden/Harris?
When someone offers to save you from a burning building you take their hand. Joe Biden is the hand.
"Didn’t Barr announce neither Obama or Biden are under investigation?"  you mean like when Comey said publicly and lied under oath that Trump wasn't under investigation??? and the entire time they were illegally spying on him 🤔
fake obstruction charges doesn't change what Obama did or the truth that's slowly getting declassified bit by bit  Barr won't announce charges against Obama and Biden until after some of the other big fish get fried anyway  today is just the tip of the iceberg  enjoy the show🤣
If Biden wins the entire investigation will be buried forever  #Hannity
Dude over here tweaking about this. Typical. Vote Biden 2020
If Biden is sinking...then what do you call Trump as thousands of Americans die and more go unemployed?
Where the fuck is  Thought he was going to help Biden get elected?
So much for unity on your part. This is divisive and narcissistic performative nonsense at a time when Democrats should be united behind the nominee, Joe Biden. You should be ashamed of yourself acting like a mere pedestrian on social media.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Progressives for Biden Convention Watch Party” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
The latest   / Marist poll found Joe Biden 11 points ahead of Donald Trump:
🤮🤮🤮If anyone is going to destroy our democracy its Biden and Harris!
Stop shaming people who will vote for Biden/harris. I don't want to but I know they will bend to the will of the people because their history shows it. If you don't vote then you truly are giving up and allowing people to due needlessly.  these retweets are dense.
Maybe I’m missing something but Pence pardoning him for what if he’s not been charged for anything before Biden enters office?
this is a Harris-Biden team, Not a Biden-Harris team #Hannity
Yeah ask Nancy she’s a Catholic and so is Biden!
But if you don't vote then you don't get the chance to have the protests and the movement matter. Trump will never budge or change anything. But Biden/harris will have to bend to the will of the people. If history shows anything its that they do bend when it comes down to it.
Biden should not agree to debate unless a fact chk is done about every statement
If Biden was still with it I imagine he’d be pretty pissed off at whoever is writing lie after lie on his Twitter.
If Harris gets elected then I wonder if they move Biden's basement to the White House fixing to be called the Black House or move the now called Black House to Biden's basement? Just asking. lol
The USCCB said that a staffer who told the bishops’ news service she was elated that Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate spoke in a personal capacity.  The conference did not address the substance of her remarks.
Joe Biden doesn’t deserve to be President! He’s a moose knuckled tater tosser!
Ya think they had a choice? 4 more years of a lunatic or Biden!
Biden is the biggest racist on earth. Harris is the biggest fake on earth. She now thinks she is black if that gets her in power.
well, he probably didn’t pick her. The DNC picked her and then told Biden that he picked her. He knows that he can’t remember anything, so he believed them and ran with it.
So in other words they are going to censure conservative videos if they say anything about 'Baffoon' Biden or 'Lot Lizard' Harris.
Again, hope I'm wrong, but mark my words-- Biden wont be any better. In fact he'll be just as bad. And if something happens to him and Kamala becomes president? I'd expect the same fash actions as trump's regime.  I really want to be wrong : /
And Biden is somehow even less progressive than Obama. And Kamala is a fucking cop. She would rather incarcerate innocent people to let them fight fires for free than let them live their lives freely. They arent agents of change. If I am wrong Ill GLADLY eat my words.
Either vote for Biden/Harris or STFU and leave!
Like Im gonna vote for biden/harris but it doesnt matter in the end, theyre still gonna bomb foreign nations most of our country will never see or be aware of, kill our own people, and subvert progress for profit. Climate change will kill us before we get anywhere
We couldn’t even hold Obama accountable, and mf’s out here pretending like we’re going to somehow hold Joe Biden to a higher standard lmao
How could this possible be a conflict of interest?  Wink! Wink! look over here there is nothing wrong with #MailInVoting #MailInBallotFraud
#Tucker it is not "the Biden-Harris team", it is "the Harris-Biden team"
Biden who?
people like "stop badmouthing kamala and biden, we need democrats even if its just baby step changes for the better!!" lmao bitches the world wont survive any more incremental change, this is beyond the time for dramatic and massive change or we will die as a species but ok mb
Have u all noticed a lot of ads for Biden and not one for Trump on this platform? Trump got Twittergated and we know it. Indictments are coming. I believe the report is complete and getting plenty of popcorn and lots of beers. lol
Y’all bout to go vote for Biden . Him and Kamala more racist than trump 🤦🏾‍♂️
They would be asked policy questions and have to explain their current socialist agenda. Biden is currently leading in the polls, why upset the Apple cart.
The legislature would change that and they have a veto proof majority. This was discussed at length when Warren was being considered for VP. It will be a non issue if Biden wants her in his cabinet, as it would have had she been chosen.
Yes please. Let’s vote him out. Biden has members of Sunrise on his team at the very least.
So now it’s Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, everyone knows Biden is just a vessel for the far left.
Hannity will be whining this guys name like Uranium One. All through the Biden administration. Unlike with trumps friends, he will likely face punishment, and serve his time if convicted.
Biden wasn’t the best pick given the field of candidates. But, he’s the only alternative to Trump.
I don’t support any of these people in any way whatsoever, but, umm, I’m pretty sure Lenin, Mao, etc would be laying the groundwork for a revolution, not endorsing Biden 😂😂
You are no more aware than Biden.
Like we’re prospering now? Get the fuck outta here!!  #Biden-Harris2020
I would crawl through a prison sewer like Andy Dufresne at Shawshank to vote for Biden/Harris
Not a Biden sign.
Well I’m not going to defend Biden. Why the democrats chose an old white guy is beyond me, but even with his weaknesses he’s still several times better than this incompetent President.
Yeah but I think we are getting better. I am a little weary of them cause if do win will want conservative policies but nice helping Biden win.
Kamala Harris probably won't be a loud voice advocating for legalization, but she can reassure Joe Biden about the California experience. It's gonna be okay, Joe. Legalization works.  by  #CannabisCulture #CannabisSociety #ColoradoCannabis
What does she care? She’s not running for office or is she? Maybe she has been offered a seat on the Biden Harris Cabinet of Undetected or Unpunishable Crime.
Uh that parody is joe Biden saying back during busing he didn’t want his kids going to a jungle school. Look it up dummy.
Do you still trust USPS with your ballot?  #copolitics #coleg #usps #Election2020
Progressives on MSM saying they're dedicated to their principles and goals and that supporting Biden/Harris isn't really giving in. Huh #NeverBidenHarris
Few steps forward followed by miles in reverse... 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Yet you’re voting for Biden simply because he’s a democrat... please
Doing nothing and a watching it happen is just as bad as doing it. Trump is bad, but Biden is right there neck for neck
Huh? What’s that even mean? You contantly teeet about Biden, so....?
Biden would have no response. No response is the same as a bad response. Biden was missing for like 6 weeks of his campaign and you somehow think that makes a promising presidency 🤔 seriously questioning your logic
If I were Biden I would hire this dude and spray paint “New World Order” on the front...
Oo we got vocab now! Literally everything on that little list you made Biden has said he will make no change to. I don’t get where you think he will do anything better. He has said numerous times he will change nothing
I always hope so, but does it actually?   And though I hate voting for the lesser of two evils, I’m afraid to not vote for Biden becuas trump has got to go!
Say one is better (between trump and Biden) than the other makes me question your ethics. They are the same. To sit there and ask me “what would you rather have - the same shit for 4 years in red or the same shit for 8 but in blue??” Of course I’ll pick the 4 years
Both the Republican and Democrat nomination this year are fucking trash people are only voting for Biden because they don’t like trump and vise versa. No one looks at actual facts anymore🤦‍♂️
Corporate news works for the same donors as the ones donating to Trump.  Corporate news might be happier w/ Trump, juicier stories. Biden will be boring at best.
I don’t think anybody is worried California won’t go for Biden. More worried about Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina ...
Biden / Harris is the Fakest ticket I have ever seen. Totally propped up by media
No. But I have at least 2 close friends, not trumplicans, who are refusing to vote for Biden. It's...insane. And I've told both of them that. 🤷‍♀️
Isn't that Biden's argument?
To EVERYONE - if you want to keep your Post Office better vote Biden
I think you and I disagree on Trump and Biden and the legitimacy of Catholic's voting for one or the other. I do appreciate you fighting against racism. Come to Denver and let's grab a beer.
Trump supporters tell me a third party vote helps Biden. So, which is it?
Yeah and some of his takes are pretty decent (only watched like 5 or 6 vids kuz they long). Today is him saying lenin would vote for biden was a special kind of silly 😜
Fair enough. But it isn't Trump supporters who made it mandatory Biden choose a "black woman." The birther thing is nonsense. Incidentally, we are all fed. Aren't we? We can choose the restaurant. You choose CNN, NYT, WAPO, MSNBC etc. I choose FOX, WATI, conservative talk radio.
Biden seems to have done fine. A distinguished congressional career spanning decades. Well respected VP, both in the United States and abroad. Presidential candidate. Soon to be president. And he’s a good and decent man. Yep - Joe’s done alright... #BidenHarris2020
Beau Biden did not have to go to Iraq. He was DE Atty Gen'l. Bob Mueller is a decorated Vietnam vet. If you vote for a coward, you might as well be one yourself.
Clearly messing with mail-in-ballots is the real issue, but I Trump is also sabotaging the mail to prevent by Biden Harris T-shirt from getting here promptly.
I hate Harris so much, I'll never vote for Biden.  This week I realized Trump can win again.  I see the stupid Obama-Clinton   running the same failed campaign as in 2016.   #NeverKamala
I know republicans don’t believe in polls, for good reason, but there are strong indications that it’s gonna be a landslide win for democrats. I’d rather be Biden in the lead by 11 than Trump down by that much. You can only pull off so many miracles when you don’t believe n Jesus
The tRump scum, bag man, that is heading up the USPS should be charged with election fraud by the Biden Administration
Everyone except me? I ALONE!!  I watched interview clip and an interview w/ Barnet. I think the “are you a junkie?” question was a continuation of his hypothetical. But, I like Biden. You have your preference. I have mine. The original post was on trump’s lies not Biden’s brain.
The Simpsons say VOTE FOR BIDEN
Joe Biden lying again... what a shock.
It was a solid press conference, now let’s have the Biden team answer some unscripted questions
The Dems were asking people to vote woke three times in a row, and since the economy wasn't tanking anymore, in 2016 the voters could react. This time a Biden/Harris vote is only about 1/3 woke. People can handle that.
Biden's campaign was in the toilet without any electors &amp; then Obama &amp; the DNC stepped in. I didn't like him in '88 &amp; I still don't.
Great news about silent majority: My daughter has a friend who has 4000 FB followers. She’s a young person in profession where she meets wide variety of people. Her followers are diverse. She put out the question, Biden or Trump, no discussion. Vast majority said President Trump.
Do you remember the Obama campaigns?   You could see vast support in places beyond Twitter.   I see it now, but not for Biden.   Biden and McCain signs are 1 in the same.
Ever seen a Biden yard sign?   Yea me neither.
Look at the little CNN, MSNBC puppets...no questions for Biden or the other one.
Nixon was more liberal than Obama, and president my boss was more liberal than biden...
Defeating trump and letting Biden become President for 8 years is an equal if not greater threat because it’s more long term. I don’t get what you’re not getting
It's temporary and who's wishlist is UBI on?   During primary the Democrats HATED the idea of UBI.  The liberal media literally ignored him, called him wrong name, showed pictures of random Asian guy claiming he was Yang.  If UBI was on wishlist Yang would be nom, not Biden.
Vote for Biden/Harris he’s not going to be a dictator, trump is‼️
I saw a Biden 2020 thin blue line sign today in someone’s front yard.  I almost crashed my truck
I'm envisioning the ad where Republicans (many formerly of this administration) endorse Joe Biden one by one - Rex Tillerson, John Kelly, James Mattis, Colin Powell.  Can we make that happen?

In CA, OR and CO, no matter how the people vote, those states will go to Biden.
President Trump  CREATED the biggest economic expansion in history. Lowest unemployment f/all in history.  Brought manufacturing back to the USA. Trade Deals! America First!  Obama/Biden=FAILURE. Economic disaster. Foreign policy disaster.  Harris &amp; Biden: Serial LIARS.
Huh? SS has spent over 400k annually on his golf trips. Him paying himself with GVMT $ negates the "not receiving pay"  I'm not voting Biden, I can't stand the current left politicians, but I'm also not a moron that falls for Trump's BS.   Keep being a blind follower, you do you.
Joe Biden is not fit to be president..he hides in the basement and all you idiot's speak for him. You are just using his name with the help of his wife..you should be ashamed of yourself. Talking about Bo...the one thing he has left to remember and you used it.
Biden and Harris our coming for our guns while calling for refunding the police. I'm out, Trump it is.
I'm being an adult and not voting for Biden.
How am I toxic for responding to your claim?   Also, I’m not a Bernie Bro, but a registered independent.   Like most independents, I don’t like the choices, but between Biden and Trump, the choice is obvious.
Would a dog wear pants like this? (Trump) Or like this? (Biden)
Pay attention Colorado, Wyoming, NM, MT, PA, OH, WV... Biden/Harris will KILL oil and gas.
Can you imagine Biden doing an interview with anyone where he wasn’t tightly controlled,  much less someone who will ask tough questions?   His brain would melt down.  Don’t know how much longer they can keep up the charade.
Biden gave us Clarence Thomas 🙃
Yup and Harris will take over if elected and Palosi will be VP.Biden will probably announce his retirement on Jan. lol.
What it really sounds like is you are voting for Biden, and I don't like neoliberals!
Twitter/Social Media is always toxic, however the “Biden and/or Kamala isn’t who I wanted but we HAVE TO vote for them” and the “you can’t criticize them!! they’re our only hope!” is gross
Maxine Waters says Biden 'can't go home' without Black woman as VP - Business Insider
Babbling Biden and Kumalot will remove 100,000 a day.
Biden and Harris are all about confiscating guns and lobbing the softball term "mandatory buyback". So they don't want the police to protect us and they don't want us to protect ourselves. I'm Out, #Trump2020
Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
Biden was VP for eight years and has spent his life in Congress. He knows the countries. He had a press release yesterday naming them and the limitations of the deal Trump "negotiated."
Seriously Biden has to dial this back or Trump will crush him and idiot libs won’t understand why.
lol when did Biden say he would be one term lololol I swear
Perhaps why they’re having so much trouble framing Biden...not your typical “liberal elite”, so the canned attacks fall flat.
Biden and Harris actually know what their doing
#thanksobama and yes Joe Biden will be the fist President to rebuild a better economy for a second after being being VP when it was done the 1st time! All trump has done is ride on Obama's coattails and try to take credit for the things Obama has already done.. trump is a loser
Biden just said him and Obama were responsible for the peace deal between Israel and the UAE that was signed yesterday. These two idiots really need to get their stories straight.
It's not about beating Trump, it's about UHC, jobs, housing, and peace. Biden-Harris have nothing to do any of these. The party needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.

Of course, the odds right before the election more closely reflect polling average, where the odds now factor in three months of uncertainty. Bush in 2000 squandered a bigger August lead than Biden's.
But to point out the obvious. If he does not concede, his followers will stand behind him. Many of them have guns. Most, probably. They also make up the majority of LEOs, military, secret service, etc. It could take more than just "swearing in Biden" for transfer of the office.
even the vaccines not a cure dumbass 😂 so please put your plastic bag on your head and sit the fuck down 😂 yeah.. and you think Trump is going to be out of office in November? Biden had no chance even before he chose Kumswallah Harris as his running mate 😂 now it's a
“But Kamala is a cop and Biden votes for the Crime Bill.”
I do understand that.. maybe you’re not comprehending that I’m not a trump supporter nor am I supporter of Biden because I support the people that make this country run, not just rich people. I don’t know why you care so little
When will Biden answer questions?
Tweet saved for when Biden/Harris push your shit in
All I have is a high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way. Maybe the undereducated would be more likely to vote “left” if you assholes weren’t so goddamned condescending.
Venture way -- way -- behind the BFF bonhomie between #Biden and #Obama in this excellent  trip thru their complex friendship and the affiliated fault lines.  And yeah, Alex also gets big points for "BFF bonhomie"
I have high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way.
If the race does not start to tighten in the coming months, will the forecast start to favor Biden more? I’d like to hear Nate’s thought about that.
Awesome. 832 days till Biden's retirement party.
I love how Trump bashes Biden for not taking questions, yet Trump might take the question but not answer it.
Dude. You’re funny. Biden can barely function. Trump is the only one that can get it DONE
I would like to see a #Biden campaign ad that is just a compilation of  gutting Trump officials during hearings. #BidenHarris2020
Biden trying to take credit. Why?
Biden does not like Harris and Harris does not like Biden. It was obvious 3 days ago. He can't even operate his phone cause it was upside down. It is a disgrace and a sham show.
Trump gets tough questions from the media, Biden has not been asked one tough question yet. Biden tries to take credit for the mid east peace talks and how does that happen when he has been in the basement forever. Unbelievable. And the Dems think he can win that way.
As the article notes: "If the court agrees, that could increase the likelihood that the results of the presidential race between President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden won’t be known for days after the election."
WATCH: Biden's Handlers Kick Reporters Out Of Press Briefing After They Start Asking Questions
Come on, you gotta admit there is nothing exciting about Biden. And Camel Toe was so exciting she finished last in the primaries and one of the first to drop out.  The Democrats didn’t even like her 🤣🤣🤣
Yes I’m going to vote for Biden/Harris because I live in a swing state. Yes I think it’s incontrovertibly true that they have used their careers to make the world a worse place and they both deserve the wall. Yes I think voting for them makes me complicit in doing evil.
“Ballot Handlers Endorse Biden”  This is fine.
I can't...had to stop watching...nothing but lies, lies and more lies...I am so frustrated...I was so happy when Biden announced Harris....I hate this motherf*cking rollercoaster ride....😟😟😟
"The Election of 1800" for    &amp; other #NeverTrump /  folks  🎵 I have never agreed with [Democrats] once We have fought on like 75 different fronts But when all is said and all is done [Biden] has beliefs; [Trump] has none 🎵
The only people attracted to the Left are BLM and Antifa sympathizers. Biden has lost the moderates and swing votes and maybe even the black vote.  It’s already over. We didn’t believe the fake news in 2016 so why would we believe them now.
It is about my rights! Joe Biden is a civilian, just like me. He's not a policy maker, just like me. Fear mongering &amp; stepping on my toes to move his agenda is 100% about my rights. I comply with wearing a mask inside if I am going to be within 6 feet of others but not outside!
get in the same boat with the rest of us, and let's row back to shore, because we are way out in the deep end with no captain. vote for Biden/Harris because at least they aren't criminals should be their 2020 campaign tag line.
You know they won’t. Only cover for cowering Biden the fool. The media is dead and it’s just all Yellow Journalism.
And you think Biden will open pandoras box in allowing previous presidents to be imprisoned???? Every living president deserves to be in jail, including president "my boss"...
and Biden didn't just vote for the Iraq war himself, he's even more culpable as he also whipped other Dem Senators into voting for it.
I actively voted for Sanders and contributed to his campaign. I’m passively voting for Biden.
I voted for Sanders in the primary. I’m not out here vote shaming anybody. I stated why I am choosing to vote for Biden because of the people in my family and community who are immigrants, low wage workers, and rely on social welfare. I don’t have your ideological purity
I agree. I also don’t like Biden or Harris. But I’ve never liked any presidential candidate I have voted for.
We so very much need to come together &amp; FIGHT tRump &amp; help people vote SO I HOPE WE ALL FOLLOW EACH OTHER OUT OF  SOLIDARITY TO HELP ELECT JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA HARRIS!
The spin machine will not accept that the left bashed President Trump for his brave decision to shut down travel &amp; months later agree it was a good decision. That would have been 2 more months of exposure if Hillary was at the helm and Joe Biden would not even be a consideration!
yep, saw a dude this morning arguing that “voting against the iraq war was seen as an act of treason” to justify why biden voted yes
Joe Biden was a WONDERFUL VP for President Obama! HE WILL BE A POTUS FOR ALL OF US! #BidenHarris2020
how’ve they been faring under biden and kamala?
The burden of proof lies with the one making the outlandish claim my dude. I don’t need to prove Biden is or isn’t anything. You do. And you can’t because all you have are made up conspiracy theories bred on message boards.
#Trump2020LandslideVictory  The exchange of embassies between Isreal and the UAE is a demonstration of Trumps negotiating ability.  For those that claim that he is beligerant Trump has a plan.  That plan required going against the established doctrine of BIDEN, OBAMA CLINTON.

“It’s not about your rights.”  Joe Biden, speaking to Americans, 8/13/20.
Have you watched Trump speak lately? And you think Biden is the one in cognitive decline? You may want to reevaluate why you believe what you believe. Do you believe it because of evidence, or just because Trump told you too. Trump has serious cognitive issues.
Vote for Biden.  Do you still want a country worth fighting for
Need to since Biden has no energy.
Harris selection could majorly boost Biden among Latino voters, polling firm says
If you regret voting for Trump, what have you got to lose if you vote for Biden.

If you live in Massachusetts vote your conscience. But please vote for Ed Markey in the democratic primary.  (Still, for immigrants, unions, and the environment Biden is demonstrably better).
Not voting for Biden/Harris because they are “insufficiently liberal” when Donald Trump is the only other option is INSANE.
Vote Biden.  It is your best chance for the healing of America.
They aren’t in terms of views but if you are telling me right now that one party is better than the other and that trump is better than biden or vice versa then you’re wrong
I don’t like either party, I think both Trump and Biden are horrible candidates to represent the United States.
I always let you look at those press meetings instead of me having to do so. I’ll always wait for Biden and Harris’ pressers now.

As it turns out, classism and elitism is rampant in the Democratic Party. However, striking team Obama is hedging their bets in a story like this for a possible Biden collapse. #copolitics
Just imagine thinking Joe "Shoot them in the leg instead of the heart" Biden is in any way radical
Obama/Biden never lost 40M jobs.

If Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are “the radical left,” then I’m Che Guevara.  This failed education system is so annoying.  Imagine actually believing right-wing media.
Biden...don't overthink...
How Significant Is #KamalaHarris As Biden’s VP Pick?
Vote Biden. Get the crazy out.
Pence went on to say that he would beat Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, shouting "I'm going to beat their ..." before being led offstage by a handmaiden.
People make it sound like protest and lower class frustration will just go away if Biden is in office. If he doesn’t give us what we want why would we stop? At least he’s not going to ghost an entire country like Trump.
And at least Biden has the decency to clarify and apologize for a comment that came out wrong. Your dude just double and triples down on his racism
Vote for Biden.
Trump can win this - don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise.
The ticket that matches me ideologically: Sanders- Warren.   The most powerful potential ticket against Trump: Warren- Buttigieg.  The ticket we got: Biden- Harris.   ...K.
Vote for Biden Harris
right 🤣 Biden is ahead of Trump 🤣
It's weird right? The world is trash right now and suddenly the bots (and Trump) are pretending Biden is the incumbent to blame it all on him.
The “suburban housewife” will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge! -Donald Trump
I don’t like mandatory voting bc I don’t agree it’ll produce results that better reflect the will of the people—ppl who don’t want to vote will just troll vote or vote thoughtlessly. It’s probably not the end of the world as long as I still have the option not to vote for a Biden
I will never forget that Obama/Biden left Otto Warmbier.
Too many of us are complacent when Dems are in power. If Biden gets elected, it’s our job to hold him accountable through direct action, public art, letter writing, calling, and actual activism (as opposed to snarky memes and twitter hashtags).
Colorado for Biden's virtual convention watch party will be hosted by two people who, as far as I can tell, have no connection to Colorado: Alyssa Milano, the actress, and Hilda Solis, a former labor secretary. #copolitics
Biden 2020: I'm Not As Blatant!
The mullahs in Tehran are soiling themselves with the Israel/UAE peace accord announcement. Thank you President Trump. You accomplished what OBAMA &amp; BIDEN could not.
Yeah, I think Congresswoman Chaney tweeted something like that, about the  Biden-Harris ticket, and I thinking "how out of touch." Harris is the darling of Wall St
Dear Joe Biden: Here’s the data, now it’s time to embrace marijuana legalization  via
Vote for Biden.
which is rare in healthy economic times, we pay down our debt. Trump was impeached because of his corruption in Ukraine seekimg an investigation on Biden. The corruption in this administration should be enough to make for you to smell how much funkier the swamp has gotten 2)
We aren’t going to do what? OMG Biden/Harris has those fools all discombobulated 😂 #BidenHarris2020
We are not voting our way out of this problem. Biden will fix NONE of this - do you honestly think voting magically gives you a smooth, legal transfer of power?  You ignored every stolen election, including in 2016. It was a coup. I said it out loud then, ya’ll called me crazy.
Where were you when our rights were stripped away by the Patriot Act? (Which Biden helped write)?   Where were you when the Obama admin orchestrated brutal police violence against Occupy?  Where were you when people were brutalized at Standing Rock for a pipeline that is leaking?
Truth. I haven't been excited about Biden since he announced his run.
The Ds were told in advance about covid too, and all they did was sell their stocks. Would Biden have handled this slightly better? Probably. Would we still have 60 million unemployed and 30 million homeless? Probably.
Highly recommend y’all click the link &amp; read some good reasons why we should vote for Biden even though he &amp; Harris are not the ideal ticket. This election is your chance to help save the country &amp; also the world! (Words &amp; shirt by
I pledge allegiance. To the flag. And to vote for Joe Biden on November 3rd.  Amen.
It’s the Putin active measures disinformation operation, drug deal, that he, Trump, Graham, Durham, Grassley, Johnson and Giuliani are cooking up to hurt Biden. WE THE PEOPLE AREN’T BUYING THEIR SNAKE OIL‼️We are flying 35K ft.  above this insidious operation and see it clearly‼️
The fact that Biden isn't +30 or more shows just how stupid our populace really is.
HEY TO ALL PATRIOTSTHAT SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION, THE 2ND AMENDMENT, THE MILITARY  AND OUR VETS, THE SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY.   JOE BIDEN AND KAMILA HARRIS  PLAN TO RAISE 1 BILLION DOLLARS FOR THEIR ELECTION THROUGH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS.   KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.

I'm voting to get Trump out of office even if Joe Biden announces he will ban propane and propane accessories.
Those speaking of a #ClimateCrisis, don't really know what they are talking about. This includes Joe Biden, Al Gore,  etc. non-scientists. Global temperature has increased ~0.5 C over the last 40 years, and only ~0.2 C over the past 22 yrs. That's a fairly stable #climate!
That’s the point. They tell us he’s a huge threat, only voting Dem will save America! While they clap sideways, tear paper, &amp; vote FOR his judges, budgets, surveillance powers, Space Force. Impeach ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. Why are they enabling the “worst threat ever!!”?
So on the short term, nothing. If we somehow win this election, do you think Biden, Pelosi, or Schumer are going to allow investigations and prosecutions, or is it going to be a 2009 “time to turn the page” redux?
This! #AngelaDavis on voting for Biden.
The healthcare expansion debate is more nuanced and incapable of tweeting about. I am just not spooked by the idea Biden is a closet leftist. Doesn’t match the reality I see. Doesn’t match how actual leftists feel about him.
I can’t believe what a MONSTER your uncle  is‼️I know he used Russia in 2016 to help win, but now he’s trying to destroy the Post Office to win with Louis DeJoy’s help! He admitted it on Fox! He can’t stand that Biden is beating him in the polls. #BidenHarris2020

Do laws really matter to any of you liberal-minded people I don't think you care about the truth which was proven by Obama and his administration and you are going to do it again with Biden and Harris
At this point, the entire GOP has BECOME Trump.  So if you want to restore integrity to our country, your only choice is Biden/Harris.
I'm voting to get Trump out of office even if Joe Biden invites Greta Thunberg to be a roommate in the White House.
Vote for a better undivided America.  Vote Biden
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
their venn diagrams are a circle, cuz that’s the point - not that obama was worse than romney, that he was the fucking same. same goes for biden/trump. you need to work on your reading comprehension
I disagree,  With  Biden has chosen to NOT alienate many former  voters. Correct, his voting block is a lock, but he needs US to push him over the edge. A #Socialist would have blocked that.
Less so than Trump's collision course with history. As I alluded to, with Biden we at least have a fighting chance to survive. Trump and republicans are an unmitigated disaster. Vote strategically, think long term. Vote your values locally where they especially count.
Appears to show? I hope Biden/Harris are working on police reform right now.
Biden/Harris do not have a solution. Sanders/Warren/Castro are nursing the divide in Texas, hoping O'Rourke never becomes accepted as a national figure. This is what gerry mandering and urban enclaves do. They nuture extreme positions in both parties.
Show me where in the Biden/Harris policy they mention any of the things you’re listing? They’re not there.
Yep, that's weird to me too. But Dem/Rep is some not sort of mirror-opposite pair. We the People at least have a voice with Dems. Republicans serve *only* the wealthy with "trickle down" as their solution to everything. Next POTUS will be Biden or Trump. Choose strategically.
Also worth noting Biden/Harris aren’t Sanders/Warren
Biden has no idea what he is saying. If he’s not told what to say, he goes off on Grandpa Simpson-esque tirades that make no sense
As I said before, TX 3 is very much in play. We have Biden up 2 there (Trump won by 14 in ‘16 but Beto got with 3) and Van Taylor is only at 43%.
Biden/Harris 2020: Fuck cows (apparently)

Maybe if Biden could win, but only by &lt; 1 mil votes so he could see how bad he sucks.
So, here we are. Congress is in recess and Trump is actively sabotaging the USPS and spreading lies about Biden and Harris. How do “we” prevent him from stealing the election? Is this not a clear and present danger?
I feel bad for anyone who believes Kamala Harris will do anything to move Joe Biden on any issue----he wouldn't have picked her if that were the case..........but hey, allow yourselves to be duped again-------everyone for themselves at this point. #BidenHarris2020---a joke ticket
Stop perpetuating a total lie. He NEVER said that. Go give Biden his pudding.
This is troubling. She has the right to her opinion, but this comes across as an endorsement for Biden.  Both parties do good, both do bad. What does she think about Biden / Harris stance on abortion?
Everybody who hates the Corporate Democrats? You know, the over powerful Clintons, Obamas, Pelosi, Schumer?   This is the same attitude that got Trump into the WH 4 years ago.   I hate Harris so much, I don't care if Trump wins this time, too.  I won't vote for him or Biden.
How long before Trump goes full Putin and arrests Biden?
The Biden/Harris ticket is like an incomplete round of antibiotics. It’ll kick the immediate problem away while creating conditions for further escalation. “Anybody but Trump” won’t go very far come 2024.
Wait till he goes full Putin and arrests Biden.
Agree, lesser of two evils. But the fetus has no voice, we need to be the voice. Democrats have shown for decades that there is no budging on their pro-abortion position. Biden claiming to be Catholic yet pro-abortion? Respect human life begins with the fetus.
That being said, I will continue to drag biden &amp; the dnc for not supporting #MedicareForAll. We are in the middle of a pandemic, people are losing their jobs &amp; insurance. Private insurance makes NO FUCKING SENSE.
biden - do you mean equalize pay for women of ALL races?
My absolute favorite the other day was a friend shared a post calling out Biden and Trump and I commented about voting third party. And another friend was like “hOw Do YoU kNoW sHe’S nOt gUiLtY EiThEr” like shut the fuck up. Where’s your proof?
He is the one that is scared. Trump is terrified about Biden winning, and I am sure his deals with Putin is a big part of it
And how is that different from you saying you don’t want to vote for Biden because of what some of his supporters say to you?
My point is this: You can go ahead and vote for Biden but the blood on your hands won't make you sleep any better. I'll fight anyone of you.
Awesome article with good quotes contrasting styles between the two. Fascinating study in leadership, relationships and frayed bonds.
I don't like it at all. Trump has no problem going left during a pandemic. He can pull it back though. Biden can't.
#Kamala and #Biden don’t want to take your guns, they want to take guns from you all!
Biden has been in public office for 48 years, he should have a message and gave taken questions.

Biden and Harris want to lower your taxes, let you keep your health plan, and send your utility bills through the ground.   That’s  for the people.  It’s for everyone.
If Donald Trump supports UBI and Medicaid until the rest of the year he will destroy Biden and his neo-con agenda.
Biden/Harris is the least progressive ticket I’ve ever seen. They might as well be republicans.
I'm unfollowing anybody who supports Biden/Harris or Trump.

Trump didn't steal 2016 He got more electoral votes  The Dem Party doesn't understand why they lost  The Dem Party DID steal the nomination from Bernie in 2016 and again this year  Biden doesn't attract Latinos, youth, and most Bernie supporters  So sorry  Trump will win again

Will do! Biden Harris 2020!
I'm not sure 4 years of Biden-in-a-stupor and psycho Harris would be an improvement. Different, but very bad in it's own way. Then, we'd have psycho Harris as Dem nominee in 2024 . .  I don't see how those 2 are going to do anything I care about like M4A or shuttering prisons.
Biden has also been accused by 8 different women of inappropriate behavior. His son is liked to Ukraine scandal. He is also a racist. Same person different packaging.
Lol there is 0 chance that corpse Biden wins
Joe Biden is poised to unveil his vision for the modern Democratic Party in the first presidential nominating convention of the coronavirus era. The Democratic National Convention formally begins Monday.
"'This [Trump's attack on USPS] is an assault on our democracy &amp; economy by a desperate man who’s terrified that the American people will force him to confront what he’s done everything in his power to escape for months – responsibility for his own actions.'"  Biden camp
No you weren’t Dave. You’ve been saying for months you won’t.   Again, you have two choices: Biden or Trump. The other choices, don’t vote, write in, or 3rd party are meaningless. They won’t accomplish anything, especially at this point.   Choose Trump or Biden. Pick one.
Ryan, you have 5 options:  1. Trump 2. Biden 3. Don’t vote 4. Vote 3rd party  5. Write in  1 and 2 are the only realistic options, like it or not. 3-5 not only won’t cause any systematic change, it will be utterly useless, wasteful, and pointless. The options are 1 or 2.
You realize if you want ranked choice voting the best chance for that is Biden right? Wake up and vote!
Get off Twitter you're helping Trump by not volunteering for Biden.
The presidential race is only one of many. Very meaningful work can be done locally. So the answer is always now. As for the next president, unfortunately it is again a two-party race - Biden or Trump. So vote Biden to fight another day. Trump is on a very destructive course.
You know damn well Biden is not lying... he dont even know what the fuck he is saying...

Biden/Harris failed to discuss anything about the need for increased focus on maximizing the availability of widespread, cheap, rapid, and frequent antigen testing, the existing technology that would enable schools, businesses, and other public spaces to open safely.
I keep hearing how Biden is so great at getting, processing, and making decisions based the advice of experts. This ridiculously lacking expression of current priorities leaves me with zero confidence in his abilities in that regard.
How can this be the culmination of Biden's effort to express pandemic policy improvements based on expert advice??!!!  This statement isn't slightly accurate based on the science.   #expertbiden #biden2020 #bidenscience #masksoutside #Unity2020 #anotheroption2020 #2020otheroption

Biden should demand equal time and threaten to never sit for an interview during his presidency with any network that doesn’t comply.
Sounds like you people are afraid of her! It doesn’t matter who Biden picked as his VP you all would be saying the same about them too. You provide such a blanket statement and can’t even give one reason why. You people are getting #pathetic
Ok fine let’s play politics. He couldn’t get everybody on board because joe biden and the democrats were calling him racist and Xenophobia for shutting down travel to China. Nancy pelosi encouraged everyone to go out as she was seen at a mass gathering in Chinatown in late feb.

No it’s not. If trump wins, we have only 4 more years of trump, and then we get a new election with 2 new candidates. If biden wins, we have 4 guaranteed years of Biden, probably 4 more after that, and he will do nothing that entire time. Stop letting yourself be fooled
Lies! Is that all you do is lie. Can’t you say the truth ever. Your moron supporters might believe you but intelligent people know how to research and look at Biden’s plan. At least he has a plan you say you have plans but never provide detail cause your last and you lie.
Biden didn’t suffocate the economy from 2008-2016. Under Trump the economy has COLLAPSED. You really think it’s more likely for Trump to improve the economy for a first time than it is for Biden to reach economic success again? #CTE

Trump being bad does not make Biden a better choice. They are both terds, you can choose which POS you choose to polish. I choose liberty. Dr Jorgensen earned my vote. No amount of one being worse than the other would ever make me vote for either of them. #VoteGold2020

Biden admin will certainly be going after rats and snakes.
Biden wants masks outside! Fortunately Sleepy Joe is just a citizen, same as me &amp; has no power to mandate anything. Just like me. Let elected officials make rules &amp; you just get led around and let them tell you what you believe. You gave up your agenda for Bernie and AOC. So sad!
Did  realize he got thrown under the bus by his own party? Talk of the empty chair puppet. Is he really going to drop out late? Does the other near 80 year old white guy step in? Already pushing his agenda. Or does the false Indian jump in? Sad when Biden seems centrist.

As far as I know it is. I think it was a sarcastic response to reporter’s Q. Biden’s been in the game a long time. He’s got a repore that Trump doesn’t have. Plus, I like him. I’m biased. And I’m cool with other ppl being biased. That’s why I like living here. I like to debate.

Realized you misjudged my comment and decided to attack me instead of admit you were wrong. Kamala is gross, her record as AG is horrible. Biden picked her as a token.
Biden made contro comments before the pandemic - recently   now understands need vs. $  The courts and climate are paramount for me personally.  This ticket is a step in that direction.  Our system is fucked, it's a long game to play. GOP better at game, but faultering now
What is the concern with Biden? I am voting with full confidence he won't do shit for four years and that's enough.
I really don’t think people understand that this is literally the endgame. If Biden doesn’t win BOTH Pennsylvania and Michigan he loses, it is as simple as that.   This is a blatant far-right takeover and the people trying to normalize this should never be trusted again.

Steve, I got time today. Please point out where I said I was “disappointed” in a Biden-Harris ticket.   There is literally a tweet where I expressed my reservations and committed to doing everything I can to ensure Trump isn’t re-elected.   This is why reading is key.

So I'm gonna play devil's advocate here. The book comes out. Most of the stuff in it can't be proven, only alleged. But some can be proven 100%. What happens then? Will Trump's base stand by him? Will they walk away, even if they don't (understandably to them) walk towards Biden?
We're not going to let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America's meat!!!   Please... Do tell. What shall the GOP do to America's meat instead?
(Tweet 6)- That is why Biden must be voted for. Not because he is good. Not because Trump is just a wannabe dictator. But it's because the Morale of The American Right hinges on how everybody else (your and I included) will suffer for not following their way of living.
That says a lot about how Biden feels about Pete.

Is this same guy going to ask Biden and Kamala that, that’s all they have done the last two days.
I registered independent after trump became the nominee, but have switched back for one reason: abortion. Hard to charge the party from the outside. I’ll vote for Biden as a registered Republican not because I agree with his positions but because I consider Trump dangerous
Of course Biden is supported by Iran cause he will give them and did give them pallets of cash to build a nuclear bomb to use against us. lol.
Maybe you could name Hiliary Vice-Vice President.  You know, for now.  #KampalaHarrisDidntKillHerself
Good one Babbling Biden.  You demonized Trump for closing borders early and Pelosi was advocating to go to China Town like it was a food festival or something. You are a moronic hypocrite.  If you can even remember 1 thing it’s this: YOU WILL LOSE IN NOVEMBER.
Regarding Texas, Biden and Harris have competing interests.
#Hannity in reality this is the "Harris, Biden election"
I think the party of values has grown weary of the man who spouts conservative ideals but uses his bully pulpit to divide and promote decidedly unchristian values. His handling of the pandemic and George Floyd sealed it. Im partially voting Biden because I want my party back.
What part of non-partisan did you not understand. I don't like Biden. They're both pedophiles.
Sorry, folks: not even a well-placed bomb could dislodge Trump et al from the WH now. They've entrenched &amp; the only options are:  1. Biden wins &amp; the military acts accordingly to support him or 2. We petition Canada for citizenship!

Best Biden quote ever.  What the actual fuck is he going on about and how can anyone in their right mind vote for this fool??
Where is she on abortion? I have not felt the need to look at her because I’m very happy with Trump on abortion. I would never vote for Biden. No candidate is perfect - but that is huge to me.
She is nuts, Biden absent
it's bizarre how many lefties base their entire personality on being mean to people but as soon as someone puts them in their place for their birdbrained "trump iz akshully better then biden becuz accelarationism" take it's back to civility and decorum and respecting opinions
I think you're right. Whoever can say the least will win. And so far Biden's people have him under control better than Trump's.
Biden is maybe the worst candidate for President ever presented to the public. And let's remember, he still hasn't former accepted nor been formerly named as the Presidential nominee. I still think the old switcheroo could be in play. Regardless, Joe's not looking good...
Lets buy stamps. Massively. Sent them back in huge envelopes to the white house with Biden name on it!
yet we get people who still refuse to vote cause they dont like Biden I dont like Biden but hes not a dictator so guess who Im voting for

So Biden discriminated against a candidate for federal office on the basis of race/ethnicity/national origin.
Polls can be reliable. 2018 was a good year. If candidates are within the polls margin of error, much less predictive power, &amp; Race is hard to call with any confidence. The closer the race, harder it is to call. Yes,I love to see polls with Biden beating Adolph Trump!
Biden is guided by real science.
67% of Republican Trump supporters won't tell you they are voting for POTUS. Take the polling and apply that and it turns out to 70% for Trump and 30% biden. Now that makes sense.
You must truly believe your base to be brain dead. Biden isn’t in charge of anything.

Joe Biden has spent his entire life as a career (50 years) long politician who enriched himself &amp; his family.  Owned by China. Racist/Bigot/Plagiarist. Pedophile. Demented.  President Trump won because he LOVES America. Doesn't make a dime. Not owned by anyone. A real LEADER!

Yes, indeed. Obama, Biden, Harris, Pelosi. They work for their Wall Street Donors. You are ignorant of this?  Not the Bernie Sanders people.
Tucker Carlson needs to stop trying to convince me to vote for Biden. 🤣
I do believe it is the other way around. Biden wrote an oped in January stating the virus was coming and POTUS needed to get prepared. tRump ignored scientists and experts. He had dismantled the department and thrown away the pandemic playbook left by the Obama/Biden admin. Liar!

Joe Biden has always had a hair trigger, anger problem.  He is a mean, nasty man.  Now his running mate is the same...mean, nasty.  Both unqualified.

I was a big fan of Joe Biden until today. This is heavy handed, big government at its worst. If private businesses, schools and government offices want people to wear masks before entering, they'll say so. Another government mandate is not needed.
I love how these republicans spew their shit, then immediately apologize for it when called out on it.

40 years of Democratic politics hurt me.  Biden said he'd veto M4A, and Kamala just withdrew her support.  The only guarantees they've made are to donors.  So, I guess choose the shit you want to eat.

A chunk of the GOP hawks and neocons went neverTrump and are now backing Biden.   Trump has somewhat avoided entanglement in Syria and Russia, a possible improvement on a Clinton presidency, though his positions on Iran and Yemen are concerning from an anti-war perspective.
Trump stands up there and takes all these stupid questions from the press. Biden gets a free pass from any questions from the press. That is why I believe we will not see a debate. The lame stream media is always covering up or apologizing for his stupid Gaffs. Unbelievable.

Its absolutely astounding to me that there are people who will be proud to vote for Biden. I hear you, it's the "only way" to get Trump out, but voting for Biden is a vote for a continuation of the politics that LED to Trump.   It isnt a solution. It's just a different problem.

Shitlibs: Vote Biden and we’ll push him left!!! Reality:
If you weren't already convinced Biden is an idiot, his mandatory mask idea should finish the job. Masks don't work, and he has no legal authority to force people to wear them. He's a tyrant and a fool.
Ah yes, Biden's conservative agenda:  - Decrim marijuana, expunge past records - public option + cap on premiums and prescription drugs - 3 trillion dollar climate plan - Free 4 year college for those making under $125k - End family separation at border
A mob of rioters preventing ICE from deporting illegal criminal domestic abusers in suburban Oregon is the perfect representation of a Biden/Harris administration.  They'll defend criminals, defund police, and decriminalize illegal immigration.

Biden, to Americans: “It’s not about your rights.”
Great, she can prove it right away. What Hickenlooper, Polis and Biden can't do, shouldn't be a problem for her?
Because, in a utilitarian approach, you as an individual do not matter in this analysis. The greater good matters. If it can be shown that Biden would reduce harm, the consistent approach is to both vote for him and advocate for him.   Otherwise, you're not doing leftism.
Biden has everything scripted for him. He's quite literally an actual PUPPET
At least Biden hasn't caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans
I mean, Biden is to the left of Trump. His policies will be to the left of Trump. His reactions to unfolding events will be left of Trump.   According to every material analysis applied, Biden reduces harm and as leftists, that should be our primary goal.

I get the situation we’re in. The problem is, too many Democrats don’t. Do you think voting for Biden fixes anything? It gets rid of Trump, it leaves all the problems behind.  So when thousands of people die because they don’t have healthcare? Understand: that’s on YOUR head.
Pot calling kettle black. You trolled me. I have my opinion and you have yours. I’m willing to vote Biden to get the orange child out of the WH. Care to argue more? I don’t feel I need to explain to you why. Don’t care about your opinion at all. Bye!

You have to be a #Trump2020 person with this image of a 'Black Fist' pumping up and down through the name 'Biden'; it has many negative connotations...  Right? You know that? Either you're saying Kamala is a puppet-master, or something much worse for Biden, or both really.
Biden/Harris the New DNC Moral Relativism at its finest!
Fauci LIKE BIDEN HAS BEEN ON THE GOVERNMENT DOLE A LOOOONG TIME! ACCOMPLISHMENTS???? THIS PANDEMIC OCCURRED ON HIS WATCH! WHERE WAS HE?? TIME TO GO Fauci!!
Do you even know what a Radical Liberal is? Biden and Harris are Centrists on a liberal day.
Awesome 👏 as always  Meme idea for you: biden in his bunker, surrounded by his computer (zoom) with the caption ‘ I have no idea what I’m doing  LOL 😂😂😂😂
here’s how voting works 1+1=2  1+0=1 not voting for biden is NOT a 45 vote not matter how you want to shame someone into thinking it is and yes what you just said is a shameful way to pressure people into a biden vote because basically you know he doesn’t have the support to win.
Any Rep voting for Biden are of course welcome also.
Any Rep voting for Biden are welcome also of course.
Any Dems voting for Biden in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that need a ride, I will be available. Thinking about renting a van.
I'm not safe in Trump's America. I'll take my chances with Biden.
Hey, any Republicans that want to further their career, this is a good time to jump ship, vote for Biden, and become the next REAL Republican trying to defeat Biden in 2024.
Biden takes the pyramid approach, thinking like most lifelong DC politicians do, that the Federal Government should mandate everything, run control and spend money from the top down. Biden's mandating masks for everyone is top down. In truth this doesn't make it better.
ABSOLUTELY! BIDEN IS THE PERFECT DEFINITION OF "ALL HAT AND NO CATTLE!" ACCOMPLISHMENTS???? NONE!!!
These things become the news, spun as if Biden said them first or even had an original idea about how to deal with the multidimensional aspects of #COVID19. Who gets the most press wins the game, with the table being set again the next day. Don't be fooled. Any President with...
Nearly everything Biden has said about the pandemic tracked what  had already said. This has been going on for months with help from puppets in #Media who won't cover Trump so no one knows much about what came first. Looks like a plot, hmm.
If  can't be honest as an Indian- American who is "identifying" as an African American how can she be trusted about anything else?  #Biden
And Obama and Biden are right in the middle of this!!! This was no doubt a failed Coup d’état attempt on a duly elected President
Only one direction. I am willing to wager a week's salary Biden will not win by the current polling margin over Trump. No one will take me up on this wager because they know the current polls are nonsense.
OBSERVATION: THIS IDIOT IS GRABBING BOOKS BY THE HAND-FULL. HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE'S BUYING??? WE TRUMP SUPPORTERS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE BUYING AND IT AIN'T BIDEN!!
Do we see what trump and his little GOP klan members are working on. All talk is about Biden and Harris. We have a group of white rich old ass men trying to take this world to a dictatorship. It’s not going away, he will cheat and steal and win. The shiny box is Trump.
Ok lol you think Dems would be mad about that? Joe Biden can quit the day after Inauguration Day. What’s your point exactly?
If Trump can have his acceptance speech on WH grounds, couldn’t Biden?! It’s our house!
Biden sent a letter laying out a strategy in January.  It was the same as the rest of the industrialized countries on the globe. You know, the one's we aren't allowed into because we are the world's plague rats
Remember when pro union was pro America?  Joe Biden and the Democratic Party do.   Strong unions support strong families!
Not only that, when Trump defeats Biden/Harris they can cry that America is systematically racist and promote further violence and division.
see it was bought and paid for bs to keep you from paying attention to the real winner bernie the one who should be president again obama did it hillary did it now biden and harris did it. open your eyes. #NeverBidenNeverKamala
The first of Obama's FBI spying agents is going to plead guilty.  He'll be singing like a canary. Many more indictments to come Obama/Biden spied on the Trump campaign and launched the biggest hoax perpetrated on America. #RussiaHoaxExposed
&gt;BLM &gt;Support Biden/Harris   Pick one
I would kind of like to see the debates and what happens over the next few months. So far Biden has done next to no campaigning. What does he stand for?
AWESOME! LOVE IT! WE GOTTA RE-ELECT THIS GREAT PRESIDENT! JOE BIDEN COULDN'T MANAGE A LEMONADE STAND AND KAMALA IS LIKE A CHAMELEON ;IN THAT SHE CHANGES HER POLITICAL COLORS TO ENHANCE HER POLITICAL POSITION!
Hmmm...riddle me this Lee...why is there no reporting on the murder of Cannon Hinnant?  Is it because it doesn't fit your narrative?  I'll let you continue on with your tantrum about how "orange man bad!" while overlooking the same issues Biden is guilty of. #LiberalHypocrisy
Wait you voted for the worst dem candidate maybe ever but think Trump is the lesser of two evils then Biden. I speak on behalf of all Dems, never vote Dem again lol.
Is there any chance you could talk to Joe Biden about implementing a nationwide ban on the dangerous, damaging practice of conversion therapy?
No worries, they would call you out either way. Smh
I look at what Biden and Harris prep to do to the Supreme Court, and yes, this is a fight for the soul of the country.  The fight's been going on and we're only part way through.
I cannot fathom the mess that a Biden and Trump debate would be. Neither can be concise and both ramble. Ugh.
I don’t think anyone’s telling you not to push for meaningful change. They’re just telling you to vote for Joe Biden with your right hand and push for meaningful change with your left.
We need to stop flights to the US. Are leader which is not our dictator is a serial killer. I bet Biden can do something about that in November.
Asking for a mess of a situation. This will be a nightmare for Biden and Trump alike. Probably not getting final results till far later than what they are thinking with the results also being questioned by both parties. If you dont want to believe me, that's fine. Just wait &amp; see
The irony is the same stupidity that she refers to about Trump supporters is the same stupidity prevalent in Biden supporters.
Vote for VP Biden. Think of it as an act of atonement.
He knows people make fun of him...he simply doesn't care what people think of him.  Can't help but to notice the HUGE amounts of #LiberalHypocrisy bubbling up with the Biden/Harris ticket.
when I began 2020 I wanted Kamala Harris as Persident, then I had to switch to Elizabeth Warren, then I had to switch to Joe Biden bc I know that is the path forward. Our war is with the GOP and their blatant disregard for life. they want to retain power. they knew where he was
Joe Biden can’t think for himself everybody knows that. I say again if Joe Biden or Democrats were in the office right now we would have 1 million lives lost to the virus.
I keep seeing these unsubstantiated claims against Biden. On the other hand, does it not at least worry you a little bit that Trump has several pictures taken with Epstein and Maxwell over several years and that he wished Maxwell "well." ?
Biden’s desired mask rule. He does get mask use outdoors, yet wants to set this as part of a national mandate.
Headlines in every newspaper in  America on 4 November:  Biden Wins,  Masks no longer necessary, Teachers say it’s safe to go back to School.   The political virus has taken away our freedom and removed objectivity from our lives.
So, in short, you have no defense for trump, just the same old BS rhetoric toward Biden. GTFOH!
Pence: we built 50 thousand more house than Obama/Biden did.... of course we burnt them down first.
I think you are a bit mixed up here.  Look at who's in charge now and how this would all go away, "Like a miracle." That or just like the #LiarInChief you think if you slander Biden with the shit speed by trump, you will win?
&gt;Man, can't believe Bernie would rather side with Biden/TERF  Fixed that for you.
I finally stopped laughing ... You actual said Biden was ignoring the science. You are so full of covfefe!  You said Biden is politicizing the pandemic. That is richer than you are, dumbass.
&gt;Somewhere in that empty brain of yours, you think Biden is equal to Trump  Its easy to beat up an argument that you made up.  At no point in this conversation did I say biden=trump.  I did however say TERF = Christian Conservatives.  That I'll stand by, wanna argue on that hill?
Distinciton witout a difference.  What do YOU think is going to happen when a TERF has the ear of the most powerful man on earth should Biden win?
&gt;The fact that Kamala is a terf doesn’t inherently mean that any policy will be implemented.  Yes it does, she will have the ear of the most powerful man on earth should Biden win.  If you think for a moment that doesn't carry weight, then you are deluded.
Hmmmm. I'm wouldn't call it historic as much as I would call it hysterical.  How could Biden pick out someone almost as unlikable as HRC?
Biden will get lost on his way there. Probably end up at the US Senate and wonder why no ones letting him in.
&gt;trans issues aren't literally the only issues in the world  Didn't say it was, but since I'm not getting shit out of Biden in the way of socialism, the next best thing is Trans stuff.  Which I won't get either because Harris is a TERF.
&gt;Why are you deflecting?  I'm not, I'm specifically answering this:  &gt;Infinitely more possible it happens under a dem  &gt;Unless you genuinely think trump and Biden are identical.  When it comes to trans rights? Yeah absolutely.
Do you not see the irony in this response?  “Why doesn’t Biden answer questions?”  “Ask him that.” 🤣🤣🤣
LOL right, because Biden and Harris have absolutely sterling reputations when it comes to transgender people. 😂😂😂
Dont trust Biden,  Biden is asshoe.
The late Arizona congressman “Mo” Udall used to say, “The only cure for presidential fever is embalming fluid.”  #FoxNews
Even more validation that the Biden-Harris ticket is pro-Israel and not a radical leftist nightmare as Trump would have you believe.
Priority #1, get Biden elected  Priority #2, get Trump physically out of the White House  Priority #3, Hold them all accountable for everything they did
Somebody check on   and see if she ok. All the campaigning she did and Biden didn’t pick her. 😂😂. She loses at everything. Maybe she should work with trump if she want to win.
biden talks a lot about justice and support for women so why isn't his female victims getting justice for his sexual assault and misconduct why isn't the kids getting justice for his sexual misconduct why are women even considering voting for a sex offender
From a friend of mine, An interesting take on Biden's perverse nature.
The amount of hypocrisy. Look at some Kamel and Joe Biden history real quick.... Oh thats right the history only matters if you dont like them right?
I just don’t get how people don’t understand that a literal toad would be better than Donald trump.   No Biden is not ideal, but I'd be quick to elect a tree branch over Trump.
Biden will fragged with in her first week.

Then some leftists waffling at me that we are going to win at some point in the undetermined future *if only I vote for Biden and Harris*  I find the entire concept laughable.
Where are you?  Join up with Meidas brothers or Lincoln Project. I know, Lincoln guys hx, but visible unifying of parties behind Biden is so much needed.
I think that trend, if you want to call it that, is vastly overstated. Neoliberalism won, handedly. You even have Biden flagrantly telling progressives, much less socialists, to not vote for him.  Now I'm given the choice of a rapist and a transphobe vs. a rapist and a transphobe

The DNC is the party of rapists (Clinton), child molesters (Biden), and setting rapists free (Hilary, Kamala and just about every Dem governor). Let's not forget easily killing rapist's babies at Planned Parenthood. How does anyone proudly be a part of this party?

Biden and his team vetted her. They don’t make huge glaring mistakes like Team Cheeto.
The problem for the dems is they have to make it look like the aliens are pro Biden and anti trump.
I rarely have given money to candidates since they buy tv ads, I don't enjoy. BUT after hearing Trump stopping money to the USPS in order to skew the vote, I am furious and will send $$ to Biden now The USPS deliver our meds but if I didn't pick up my mail he would notify the law
Call your Senator and Representative and give them an earful.   Doesn't he realize seniors get their meds through USPS? He is only doing this to cheat the vote.  I usually don't donate but I am going to give $$ to Biden now. I think Trump would sell his kids to get re-elected.
Trump thinks he can bully us, by hurting our post office.  Call your Senator and Representative and give them an earful.  Doesn't he realize seniors get their meds through USPS? He is only doing this to cheat the vote. I usually don't donate but I am going to give $$ to Biden now
I doubt  is jealous of people disguised as journalists who are rather a mouthpiece for the Democrats and the Dems pick Biden! They go hand in hand, Media and Biden! They all are asleep at the wheel!
The truth comes out...Biden will leave office just after taking office and Harris will be President of Dems win!
Fact Check: Kamala Harris Did NOT Call Joe Biden 'A Racist And A Rapist'
Joe Biden asking people to wear a mask to save lives in not tyranny! What is TYRANNY is Trump dismantling the United States Postal Service to “try” and Winn the election
Second topic during official press conference is actually a campaign attack on Biden. Abuse of office and the bully pulpit.  #ETTD traditions and respect for norms
I hope that the Secret Service for Joe Biden checked the closets in his basement for little girls.
The real question should be who will be Kamala Harris VP? You know Biden gonna resign like two weeks in
Trump thought Biden would pick Karen Bass because she wouldn't 'outshine' him  We all know any woman Biden would have picked would "outshine him!"
Until now, Israel has had no diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab countries. Unlike Biden, who capitulated to the Iranian regime,  has done what no other Administration has been able to do, begin the process of peace in the Middle East

Biden taking the blackness from niggas who dont vote for him
It’s interesting that you can replace the name Joe Biden with Donald Trump in that sentence and it’s pretty accurate.
Trump might be bad but he's no where near as bad as Biden. Biden is more racist and has written bills that has put countless blacks in jail
You guys, what 3rd party candidate are you gonna write in? Maybe that way the Democratic Party listens to you. If you don’t want to vote for Biden or Trump, I get it. But explain to me how being silent during the only time you get to be heard is going to help us?
The more important part there is how you don't plan on actively resisting the Biden admin's agenda once he's in office, you'll become complacent instead. If you did then I would forgive you for making what -would be- a reasonable, pragmatic lesser evil choice in voting for Biden.

Did you actively #Resist and protest when Obama bombed Libya back into the stone age? No? And of course you're not going to do anything like that when Biden or Harris start a new war, either, because brown people's lives don't matter when a 🟦 president is the one bombing them.
that we need to shot biden with 45 and keep firing till we have a progressive potus 🧐🤔. JS
they didn’t leave us to be honest biden did straight up say if we didn’t like his policies don’t vote for him right there on camera for the world to see. even said to poc if he’s not giving them what they wanted he’s not their choice either don’t vote for him, great 👍 way to win
I am no so desperate to get rid of Trump as to vote for Biden.  I am not so desperate to avoid Biden as to vote for Trump.  My only hope is in the sovereignty of God and that one day Jesus Christ will set all things right and rule in perfect righteousness.
I'm sorry, I just cant vote for Joe Biden because of the KHive and how toxic Joe supporters are. All they do is insult everyone else around them. Frankly, if that's the kind of folks Joe attracts, then why the hell would I want to vote for a toxic person?
Without talking about Trump, why should Joe Biden become POTUS? What are his policies that will actually help poor Americans? Whats his stance on the Military Police force and Mass incarceration? Whats his stance on Deportations? Is he still 4 them?

A vote for Ye is a vote for trump..not saying Biden is any better but we need Chester cheeta out!!
fyi she’s in public office i can judge wtf ever i want, don’t want judged stay out of office. just like the potus. and kiddy diddler biden. or shitty obama. and craps clinton.
she mainly put poc behind bars for pot crimes then admits she was smoking weed in college. also marred a white boy. she’s asian/black. susan rice was a better choice and if a black women was what we needed for change the dnc picked wrong. or was that as close as racist biden can

Biden is a disaster!
nope democrats will still blame the far far leftist like us. anyone who admits to not voting for biden they’re going scream and rant it’s our fault he lost. just like 16 all over again. i already know it. i can feel the hate brewing already. they know how to deflect.
Ok, now I know you don't know what it is you're talking about. I guess expecting someone like you to have read books was too much of an ask. Biden is VERY center left, but I guess from your point of view everyone left of McCarthy is a commie.

Fuck Joe Biden.
You and your Democrat allies are terrified Biden will assure a Trump reelection by melting down again in an episode of dementia.
T- word is running KW to take votes away from Biden.
It won’t win you or Cory votes. Coloradans want change and that change is in the form of Biden/Harris.

He's just trying to keep votes from Biden. Politics would eat him alive. #BidenHarris2020
Think the democrat's were bad when they were the confederacy wait till biden gets in this country will see another Stalin and a rebellion like this world has never seen before
President has been talking for over an hour on Maria Bartiromo's show. In a normal election year, the democrat candidate would be demanding equal time. I doubt Biden could last 5 minutes let alone an hour having an unscripted discussion like that.
Only 5% of all donations goes to the actual cause the rest goes in pockets wonder how much money went in biden's pocket
Biden will bypass congress just like obama and pass pelosi's gun law which takes away your rights to protect yourself teach your kids to do the same and survival skills, ask yourselves why the democrat's want to do this, We can't let biden do this
Let's hear about black people who hate and commit hate crimes no all hate crime are committed by white people but that's all we hear about that door swings both ways biden
Dumb and Deceitful... Biden and Harris... The short bus candidates from the Delesional Democrats who are short on capability but long on hype and unrealistic expections.  Prediction:. Historic landslide victory by  Pokoredicted.
This all feels so poorly timed. He should (not really) be saying that he'll definitely push for schools to be open for the Spring of '21, so whether he loses or wins, he's got an option. If he wins, he can walk out back, if he loses, he can set a time bomb for Biden. Strategy.
Attack Trump but you dont say anything about Biden. Why is that? You guys arent news you are talking heads!
You think he “forgot” that president Trump denounced the white suprematism before finishing or he is just this much a POS? I can answer that. He raised Hunter Biden and touches small children. #4MoreYears
Kinda sucks that biden picked the worst of the bunch. Not much to get excited about, just a slog to the end. The fact she's a person of color is obscenely overdue, but if you're already ambivalent about biden, she sure doesn't help. But anything is better than what we've got now.
U like Harris... as a black man... knowing she locked up countless young black males for truancy...really these kids now have no future! Just because you might hate Trump you side by her... really 😳 either you think you’re White or some shit or you list your marbles like Biden..
His entire point is that his problem with Biden’s plan to rezone suburbs to stop single family houses and force low-income housing is not fair to those who work hard to live a suburban life. His mention of minorities is to say they too are neg. affected.
Voting for Biden is ancient Israel voluntarily surrendering to the Babylonians.  Voting for Trump is ancient Israel going to Egypt for aid against the Babylonians.  Both choices are immoral.
Indeed.  Both Biden and Trump are reprehensible choices and should both be refused support.  Very simple.
Why would anyone? Who knows man. But voting for a third party or not voting for Biden is a vote for him which is against what progressives want. So why are you even considering Biden/Harris a bad vote lol
But how is voting for Trump taking more of a step toward towards that’s goal then voting for Biden? We all know Kamala will take over in 2 years.
I'm looking forward to President Biden tackling a pile of OE's to cancel all of trumps OE's.
The trump train blasts thru town with no regard for citizens safety and Biden shows he has the strength to pump a railroad hand car.
Views on things like the economy but Trump has no morals, no ability to see things two sides, no remorse for people, and honestly cares more for the unborn than the living, he’s not what we need right now we need hope, for me it’s more byedon than Biden!!!  #lincolnvoter
Dude they have zero baggage on them. I’m eh on Biden but think Kamala is a great VP pick.

at least there’s a CHANCE Biden surrounds himself with people who will actually improve the state of our nation.
So since you all went after sticker Carlson last night for not saying Kamalaha name right are you going after Biden since he said the wrong name today. Doubtful!!! why you all suck balls
i genuinely don’t understand the people who are like “well i’m not voting cause biden isn’t any better than trump” okay but like??? you do realize trump is still AWFUL. he surrounds himself with maniacs.
You know who was a big threat to Latinx? The Deporter in Chief Obama. Biden and Obama were sued by the ACLU in 2015 for family separation but please go on about how Joe will be some great savior of America when it's working as he intended it to work with his laws
Under Obama/Biden, I lost 2 different construction jobs. Both times the Owners closed their business because of Obamacare. Under President Trump &amp; Mike Pence I had MANY opportunities to choose from. They say they will create more jobs- LIERS. Will destroy us.
Also, just because I am critical about Joe and his faults does not mean I support the Red Racist Rapist over the Blue Racist Rapist. Look at what Joe's done. Look at who was in charge right before Trump, Obama and Biden. What will Biden do that he didn't do in 8 years?
Do you mean when Biden lied about Trump actually said in Charlottesville.
You’re advancing the narrative to allow Harris to debate Trump instead of Biden. Be careful what you say.
And you’re gonna vote for Biden aren’t you 😕 please don’t break my heart
Biden is not afraid of a strong very intelligent woman, while Trump attacks the women he fears the most as "nasty."  It's Trump's tell.
Two proven public service leaders who will work on behalf of all Americans
Not two days BEFORE Biden announced Harris as his running mate,  was quoted as saying she'd make a "fine choice".  Trump's split personality is rearing its head again.

Both of you do is lie to everybody. If Joe Biden was president right now we would lose 1 million lives to the pandemic.
They were not going to choose anyone else. Needed to be a woman and not white since Biden is about as white bread as you can get
Love this 💯  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Love the Union workers response to biden wanting to fight one of their own for asking a gun question that biden denies ever happen even though he's on video, on video for sniffing hair he denies that are you seeing a pattern yet
#KamalaHarris seems like a woman that would be fun to have on a Girl's Night Out on the town. But her positions have shifted so I'm not sure what she believes. Has she ever said anything on foreign policy? So many of Biden's positions over decades have been wrong.
Biden wants our children to be taught the Islamic religion in American schools. Our children have been told they don’t dare pray in school.. yet he wants this. Take that RED PILL before it’s too late
The Biden/Harris ticket is by no means ideal. But it’s much better than what we have and I’m confident it will be an administration we can work with. Plus Kamala will help pave the way to the White House for so many women of color to follow her
The Biden/Harris ticket has now raised over 10.8 million dollars...
Joe Biden will never be President. Repost if you agree.
Prediction: Biden out at the last minute due to cognitive or “stroke.” Hillary in. Doomed, we are.
My dog got his and is voting for Biden/Harris2020 lol
Incremental change like how Obama bombed more weddings than Bush? How Biden caused more black people to be jailed than Reagan? Not sure the change is going in the right direction there, random bearded white centrist.
Trump has absolutely been sedated for this Biden/Harris Q&amp;A presser.
It only takes a moment to realize that 2020 is not about Trump v Biden. That is the subject of today's 10 minute episode.
Just another HIDIN BIDEN
I would think Biden has many cream of the crop candidates. I am sure they want this nightmare to end as much as we do.
There's a part of me that's glad Biden picked #KamalaForVP because at least she has a law background and has worked to enforce it. BUT when the first thing I saw yesterday was that BLM spokeswoman from Chicago saying looting was fine &amp; claimed they were...
As we all know, if Donald Trump isn't reelected, Joe Biden will get rid of all toilets! That's priority number 2, as soon as he murders God, his number 1 priority.
A good start would for Joe Biden to make Sally Yates his AG &amp; undo the damage done to the Justice Department by Barr!
The confederacy is just trying to save face by picking kamala but all I heard was biden playing the blame game as always and lies will not support a sex offender or corruption
I can see us having 3 months of hella laughs with the Biden/Harris Dem ticket  As long as we bring it on Nov 3rd t Don't take this election lightly, never ever The left is desperate!
So vote for the person who created the camps and the police state, that will fix it right good! We are in this mess because of Biden. They might as well say to America, sit down, shut up, and obey because both sides will lock you up for it. Crime Bill/Cop 2020 FTW!
eight years of obama he didn't help the poor, the disabled, our vets, social security, and black people but he did help hos rich friends and China you can expect the same from biden after all obama endorses corruption criminals stick together
Joe Biden is BEYOND DISGRACEFUL!
Fact democrat's like polis raised Our unemployment rate because he kept small businesses from opening up while corporations stayed open that's the democrat's helping Us more like helping their rich friends Trump has no control over democrat's like that grow up biden
Great speech biden it's all Trump's fault us democrat's have no part in this country falling apart even though eight years of obama is proof of his boosting China's economy not Ours
Oops, Biden mispronounced Kamala’s name, but quickly corrected himself
Biden has the nerve to say, "I will create jobs where President Trump has failed." WHAT A JOKE !!
So one thing I did notice is that MSNBC did not carry that trump announcement of how schools can go back to in person learning. Instead they showed the empty stage at Biden’s event. 👍🏻
Biden's AG is going to be very busy. Lock them all up!
I met Joe Biden 35 years ago and he is the kindest, most gracious and thoughtful man I have met except my husband. Remember he came forward supporting gay marriage on Meet the Press long before Obama. And I adore Obama too. Then there is Jill- more to come.
Why wold progressives say ANYTHING to discredit Biden/Harris? Anytime anywhare Bernie is not the nominee. When you study dialectic world view you know prigress is made when a synthesis is achieved. Black and white merely alternates which isn’t efficacious
&gt;You made the claim that Biden isn’t harm reduction.  Yeah, in the context of Transgender people. My chief complaint against Harris.  Remember?
why would you make a statement like that if you weren't afraid of what Biden brings to the table? You showed your cards about Biden's VP pick being the "Actual" President choice for the Dems and Trump Haters like yourself! You are all terrified "Biden being Alone"
Seems like Antifa solider is inter-changable with Biden supporter.
#JoeBidenISAntifa So! antifa.c0m now redirects to joebiden.c0m Does this mean Joe Biden owns the  domain name? Did he register it? Does he maintain it? Does he fund it? The Antifa page before Kamala update.
Just for a laughs I have to see the Joe &amp; Kamala meetup I hope Biden speaks with the media
What’s happening now in America is Trumps fault not Biden’s 🙄 is Biden the president??? Nope Trump is! He failed at leadership
You've not demonstrated that Biden and Harris record is irrelevant and will be better for trans people. Harris is a fucking TERF, so you've got a big fucking hill to climb.
Tell me, how is Biden/Harris going to be better for transgender people when their records do not fucking reflect it?
Shake me all you want, you cannot devide Biden or Harris from their records. I don't know why a lot of you seem to think their histories are irrelevant. I'm 38, I've seen this song and dance before.
. and  is hours late today. I bet #Biden won't come back out of the basement.  #Trump2020
I just have to laugh when on the Biden Harris page They're crediting Sleepy Joe with his leadership during covid19 Just how do you lead from your basement?
I’m not saying “don’t vote for Biden.” In fact I’m actively hoping for Biden’s success. Part of that success is going to involve reaching out to groups he has historically ignored or left behind. Why don’t you try to help out?
Not on your life. Wouldn’t miss the debate! I want to know how bad is Biden is diminishing. GOT MY POPCORN READY🤣🤣🤣
Fact Check: Kamala Harris Said She Believed Women Who Said They Felt 'Uncomfortable' By Biden Touching -- NOT 'Rape Accusers'
Trump is a socialst president who wants to push vaccines on us at warpspeed just as much as biden. But trump is against China so ill vote for him. What china is doing to its ppl and nearby neighbors is appalling and despicable human rights abuse
y'all underestimate how much people will stop paying attention if biden gets elected  nothing will fundamentally change but so long as bad orange man isn't on the news all the liberals will be off to brunch and business as usual, thinking their summer blm ig stories saved america
"I can see Russia from my window, and they're scared of Joe Biden!"
You're a HACK and a FAKE, your word means nothing. Your a LOSER and showed it running against Biden .
Joe Biden Courts Islam, not Muslims
Realistically it should be Trump debating Harris. Biden is a non-factor.
This is the important Biden/Harris coverage right here:
from this story by    “Black women don’t just need one spot. We need representation at all levels of government, business, education — everywhere,”  said. “...I think (Harris and Biden) can make that happen, too.”
Kamala Harris being named Joe Biden’s vice presidential pick sets a match-up between the California senator and Vice President Mike Pence on the debate stage in October.
I did!! You can, too! Chip in to elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and other Democrats on the ballot
How Joe Biden's #Climate Plan Could Be Transformative - Rolling Stone #ClimateAction #ClimateActionNow #Vote
I murder the left all time. But normy conservatives are so tiresome too..constantly asking now if Kamala still thinks Biden is a racist/sex offender etc. Who tf cares? It’s clear that she has precisely 0 political principles/morals....
liar Tobin, Biden is devout practicing Catholic.
Trump reacts to Biden, Kamala Harris ticket exclusively on 'Hannity' | P...  via   Oh boy #FoxNews  #Hannity must have gotten his knee pads out to get Chief  on.... Check it out.
So half the TL is telling me they dislike Biden/Kamala’s voting record more than they dislike what we’ve seen from a Trump led adminstration.   Hypothetically, what do you think Trumps voting record would be had he been a lifelong politician?
donald trump's greatest weakness is someone just saying 'oh for sure man' to him. in many ways, that makes joe biden, a guy who can only say stuff like, 'cmon man, what are you, smoking pcp? am i in an opium den right now??' the perfect opposition
Translation of  "I thought I fooled Biden by all my talk of her being a fine running mate and he'd look elsewhere. Now I'm shitting my pants because I'm going to get beat like a two dollar--well you know--those people I pay for sex."
I can find citations that say Biden/Harris2020 - We'll still kill your kids, just hide it better
N he just recently named her his running mate. She still fresh on that ticket while this matter has been about Biden v Trump.
I have called both trump and Harris evil so there for you know who I’m picking from the two of assumption? And I’m not a fan of Biden lol it’s not hard to see that the American people don’t have much to choose from and these are our options and you have every right to feel a way
I’d bet she’ll be part of Biden’s admin if they win. There’s still a ton of people who need to be brought on board.
My disagreement with her being a running mate to Biden has nothing to do with how i place my vote this election and second the vote is between Biden and Trump
I am going to be upfront, neither Biden nor Harris are my first picks. but I sure as shit am voting for them to get this russian infestation out of our leadership. Let's get our house in order, and make it our house again, then let's talk about other candidates.
Very interesting.   via
Yes, yes please. Biden and/ or Harris should do this daily. Bring in guests. When no ones watching the Cheeto Rambling Rally maybe they’ll stop the s**t show.
So we have a senile rascist segregationist in #Biden and a leftist who's father admitted that their family was one of the largest slave holders in Jamaica in #KamalaHarris for the #Democrats.
I'm not ecstatic about Harris, especially not now. But I think this election may decide *whether* we still have the ability to vote in future elections.   So, I hope the country elects Biden and then continually turns up the heat under the entire Democratic party.
Really looking forward to Biden's sad excuse for debate...
Already talking of #Biden 's step down. That was quick.
How about cheating, stealing or lying? Trump has probably had something to do with abortion in some way or form. Your group needs to re-evaluate it’s spin on Biden/Harris stop preaching and start teaching...
One example that will support my case is literally last year, Kamala Harris endorsed several women that claimed Joe Biden touched them in sexually aggressive ways. And now she’s going to work with him in the White House ? Yeah ok.
That isn’t well-regulated capitalism &amp; it’s why you need democratic governments, to address these kind of externalities. Free market fundamentalists that support Trump want businesses to address these problems. Tell me how not voting for Biden is going to solve them.
It was really just probably the way I read the tweet when you said oh well fuck everyone else. I care about the election hence the reason why Im voting for Jo Jorgensen. Will that help our current president? Possibly but I see Kamala Harris and Biden as an equally horrible choice
New drinking game: take a shot every time Biden sniffs Harris. We gon' get turnt this election season!
I back America 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸! Biden and Harris will make it great again!!! Let’s gooooo!!
Janet Reed a democrat activist arrested for election tampering on 400 ballots it's already started that's why biden is for mail in ballots only way he can win just like obama
Why would anyone in the great nation vote for Joe Biden knowing he’s just going to step down?
You scared? I bet you are  !  &amp; Biden are going to clean the floor with you and your side kick Pence (trump’s lil bitch)!
this is obamacare I have a endrinal dysfunction feels like I've been hit with 110 house electrical 24/7 dr says I'm not sick enough to help because I take a pain pill for my level 8 pain I'm in 24/7 if I stop taking it they will help me don't let biden get in office
Honestly when it comes to the two choices of Biden x Harris or the other bafoons in the White House, it’s kind of like you just have to pick the better evil. They all suck and don’t have any interest in the American people but to take their money.
Biden is going to crash and burn. Obama and Rice had the foresight to avoid going down with him.
Why would I want to give millionaires more money already stole enough from The People biden along with your son
Oh, I think Dodd really doesn't like Harris, but I was interested in why Biden didn't shut that shit down..
If I was  I'd do the following: - Put  next to unhinged    - Use #California's failures for what #BidenHarris want  - Play the video on loop where #KamalaHarris called #Biden a #rascist   -Address Harris as the real presidential candidate
Do you think Biden let Dodd savage Harris in the press, to see how she would handle it? Seeing as how Trump will be a total racist, sexist asshole..
She's hoping to be #1 soon after Biden comes out of the basement. 🤣🤣
Well Kamela Harris will not have to read a script when she goes ahead and implements amendment 26 shortly after Joe Biden as president
Anyone Voting for Joe Biden is putting our Country in a Dooms Day device.  #WeAreDoomed
2 years, then Biden will be declared mentaly unable. She will then be able to run for 2 more terms, if elected giving her 10 years! I can't even imagine!!!!
Biden is a moderate.  You seem to have problems grasping that.  Harris is also more moderate than one might think.  Now, I do realize your reactionary authoritarian wing of your party, but seriously?
Yes. 45 has always behaved like a child. Expect no less and vote Biden/Harris 2020.
Biden lays a trap for Trump in picking Harris
I already hated biden, but was going to vote for him.  Kamala? Peace the fuck out.   Voting for myself in November and voting progressives down the ticket.
The fact that  called Biden a racist and said that she believed the sexual misconduct issues with him but switched it up 180 now is fascinating
No we’re just excited for someone worthwhile like AOC to be president and not “Nothing will fundamentally change... no one’s standard of living will change under my administration” Biden
We can't, if he had selected a progressive VP? Maybe you could make an argument there. Instead he chose a cop who relished making all kinds of people's lives more difficult.  I won't vote for Biden/Harris for the same reasons I won't vote for Trump/Pence.
You've the right of it.  Both tickets (Biden/Harris vs Trump/Pence) have a LONG history of making transgender people's lives unnecessarily difficult.   So I'll be voting 4 myself and voting progressives down the ticket. Liberals can kiss my commie ass. All of it. Every last inch
You keep talking about this as punishing Biden, I'm not defending his shitty record. I'm saying having him in the Executive seat will be significantly better than Trump in the seat in 2021. "Deserve" is the wrong word, what's best for marginalized communities? Trump?
It’s almost like no one is excited for the next administration and their entire platform of being “not Trump” and are looking forward to after Biden/Harris so we can do worthwhile things like M4A finally.
So will the democrats with their endless republican or pro-corporate policies.  I am pretty sure Biden will lead to an even worse Trump.  Much like Clinton led to Bush, and Obama led to Trump.    There is no spin on winning.  It's a lose/lose/lose situation, by design.
Biden sucks though. Sure Trump is worse but I've done this lesser of two evils since Bush/Gore.  U're smart you know a lot of shit and explain it in great detail but you're just wrong on this Biden shit. There is no real choice. U just haven't been disillusioned but give it time.
I’m gonna be voting for Biden/Kamala with one hand and scrawling“fuck the police” on the wall of the booth with the other hand.   Seriously though- both these problematic candidates respond to political pressure, and NOBODY is better at political pressure than BLM.
Well for the uneducated majority of America, people will see that she’s black and a woman and automatically vote for her+Biden. Sensible people know she’s horrible.
“Then enemy of my enemy, is my friend” Biden/Harris.....”Plan, plot and strategize, but bomb first” (Tupac).
Highlighting the differences between Biden and Harris, too spiteful to realize, it’s the exact reason she was chosen.  Strategized from the advisory of Obama.
Lol  doesn't comprehend how someone can be honest and tell someone when they are upset with them over an issue, then resolve it.   HIS ANSWER TO SOMEONE UPSET WITH HIM... FIRE THEM OR UNLEASH MILITARY FORCE UPON THEM. HE DOESN'T GET IT!
of course joe biden picks a cop. but also a black woman getting closer to the oval. but its still ACAB
Kamala Harris will be a good VP. But I am bit surprised that Biden didn’t pick me.
Strategically, Biden made the perfect pick. It wasn’t to hard using common sense either.
..and that's what our country needs right now.  you sold out completely to   So shut up altogether. #Biden/Harris2020
Pick your fighter:  8 years of Biden  or  4 more years of Trump, followed by 8 years of    Got damn, that’s a tough one
Fantastic!!
I can't imagine Trump, a man whose ego lives in a glass house, choosing anyone as strong as Sen Harris for a job in his admin.  Kudos to VP Biden for choosing someone who will make him a better president.
Of course not!! That's why I love looking for the earpieces they wear and listen the pause when they answer questions to listen to the person feeding them their lines via the earpieces! Nevertheless, Biden will gloriously go down in flames during the debate with Trump.
I’m a white guy who is very anxious to get my Colorado ballot in the mail and vote for Biden/Harris. I was torn during the D debates between Harris and Warren. After Harris dropped out I was happy to vote for Warren. But now I get to vote for Harris too!
I need a Biden/Harris coffee mug.
is so damn stupid and keeps changing the narrative.  Today he says that if Biden wins then Iran will own our country.  Yesterday he said if Biden wins then we’ll all be speaking Chinese because China will own our country.  Jesus Christ, can he make up his mind?
Only because I have 0 faith in any third party victory and Biden/Harris is an easier evil to deal with than another 4 years of the Fascistsaurus.
We already figured out that Biden is also a fascist since he said nothing would change under his presidency. So, back at you bud.
Does anyone else remember when Kamala Harris said she believed the women who accused Biden of touching them inappropriately, just last year? And now she's his....running mate? Just me? Cool ok bye 👋🏻
Trump is a fascist. Biden specifically said nothing will change. What does this make Biden?
Does Biden know who he picked?
I thought someone here said that they weren't voting for Biden, but whoever he picked for VP.  But yeah, that seems to be the thought now.
I really get sick and tired I'm hearing all of you Marxist a****** saying that Joe Biden this and Joe Biden that. Joe Biden is sitting in a corner drooling on himself.
She also called Biden a racist.
QUOTES LIKE THIS (AND THERE ARE MANY OF THEM FROM HARRIS) NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN TRUMPS ADDS! BIDEN IS SO CLUELESS; HE DOESN'T RECALL ANY OF HARRIS RADICAL CHARGES IN THE  DEM DEBATES! THEIR CAMPAIGN  SINK LIKE THE TITANIC!
Fact Check: Nancy Pelosi Did NOT 'Confirm China Would Prefer Joe Biden'
She is against fracking. She favors $ benefits for illegals. She calls ICE the KKK. She believed Biden’s accuser. She jailed many minorities as DA. Ask her about Willie Brown’s “help” 🤭.
She slept her way to where she is. I don't think a majority of Americans would want her to take over as president when Biden can't. Trump wins!
She was "mean"? Coming from someone who follows a guy who says you don't even have to ask women... "just grab em by the pussy"... a man who called Mexicans rapist and murderers... discriminated against Blacks so often that he was sued &amp; you say Harris was MEAN to Biden?  LMMFAO!!
Seeing right and left wing pundits lose their minds on Twitter over Kamala being Biden's VP pick fills me up with an intense joy at witnessing the deluge of their combined tears.
I wonder who Kanye will choose for VP? 🤔  I'm already bored with Biden/Harris.  #Trump2020

5 Things to Know About Biden's VP Pick, Kamala Harris
😂😂😂 Biden was part of the administration that started doing it😂😂😂😂   the democrats have  officially gone off the deep end
"Team" Trump is a fan club and dissent of the leader is not allowed.  Biden is building an actual team. #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020
Sorry, but the racist who still support that, love Trump, not Biden! Nice try though, hypocrite!
I'm losing count on all the pro #Biden troll accounts just started the last couple of months.
#KamalaHarris has turned her back on #Biden sexual assault accusers and ALL WOMEN by accepting the #VPPick! #MeToo
#KamalaHarris believes #Biden sexual harassment accusers.
Pick Biden = Die of climate change, he wont do enough Pick Trump = Die of climate change, just a little faster Pick a third party = Die of climate change, one of two above win anyway Pick Revolution = World's ability to fight climate change obliterated Welcome to the end
They're afraid of Harris because they know if Biden wins she's the 47th POTUS and they DO NOT WANT THAT.
Biden chooses Kamala Harris as his VP running mate.  She isn't African American. She is Jamaican and Indian...but bet they spin it different.   Feel energized yet?   Didn't think so.

I bet Joe Biden told  "If you don't run as my VP, then you ain't black!"
Upset to hear that I was not Joe Biden’s VP pick. I thought my platform on banning pumpkin rav was compelling but alas
Well said, Linda! I, too, am a lifelong republican and I'm voting for Biden. Donald represents everything I oppose and he stands for nothing. #RepublicansForBiden #thelincolnproject
Tell pelosi to give Us the cure everything adds up that pelosi and her puppets are behind it instead she's waiting for biden to get in so they can sell it to Us
Won't watch him today or in any way let him ruin a great day for team Biden and what is simply bad news for Trump and that other guy...oh yeah, Pence.
Biden/Harris 2020. Watch your soup Joe
Not ONE thing you just said about Biden is even remotely true!!!
biden's own words I will help my rich friends with obamacare, We will BUY clean energy, I never did that even though he's on video, I support corruption as long as my friends and me get rich,  I'm for socialism that's the only truth he has told
You're so hot on the defensive, you don't even realize I'm saying your candidate of choice SHOULD have more of a chance on the ballot.  I'm voting Biden because I understand how our broken system is currently works and the stakes involved in this race. But we should change it.
I like to have fallen out of my chair when almost in the same sentence he said Kamala was so nasty to Biden  then he went on to call Sen. Warren not by her name but "Pocahantas".
Good thing Biden/Harris 2020 will shut down any of the GOP and Trump's claims they are socialists.   #toolate #feelthebern
". what kind of shampoo is that? Sniff sniff" #Biden
#KamalaHarrisForVP ❤🤍💙🎉 Democrat Joe Biden chooses Senator Kamala Harris for White House running mate
She's the perfect candidate for American "Liberal" mainstream Democrats (center-right in any reasonable country).  This means that she's disliked by both anyone to the right and to the left of her. Just like Biden.
I'll never vote for her or Joe Biden. #CorruptPolitians
Listening to Trump talk about the "Radical Left" while addressing Joe Biden's selection of Kamala Harris for VP in 2020. Has he(Trump), in the last 10 years, said "radical right? Not that Trump is a far right, or even "radical right", he's just talking to his base.
Biden only had 2 things he was looking for in a running mate,  according to all reports &amp; interviews he gave. Democrats 100% AGREED! Sad it was SUPERFICIAL qualifications. 🤦‍♀️ PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T CARE ABOUT RACE OR GENDER! HE WANTS WHAT'S BEST FOR THE AMERICA🙏🕊TRUMP2020🇺🇸
BTW: It was Pres Obama &amp; VP Biden who cleaned up the Bush/Cheney mess. They did it once, Biden/Harris will do it again!
I want Biden to win 😕 just stating the real
🎵🎶There's gonna be a hoe-down in the ole town toniiiiiiiiight!🎵🎶  Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate, setting aside tensions from primary
First question(s) for Kamala Harris; What is your perspective now on Joe Biden's past views on school busing? What has changed, if anything, and what to you want the American people to understand about Joe Biden as it relates to this issue?
I hate Biden’s VP pick...I really do, but I hate the prospect of 4 more years of Trump even more.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been who I wanted on the ticket all along! You got my vote easily! Let's take our country back! #BidenHarris2020
when biden drops out she is the presidential pick
Biden pick proves the DNCs confidence in their ability to cheat.
Ladies and gentlemen...trump is showing you how chickenshyt scared he is of Biden/Harris
Time to start the clock before she "doesn't kill herself." Especially with the Biden VP pick.
I had hoped it would be her. Biden needs someone who will stand up for what she believes is right.  Will fight for him. Will tell it like it is.

Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate?
I think Biden picking Harris just pissed off half of the Nutbags. The other half are still figuring out if it's good or bad. What a bunch of lost people.
Biden: *names a major perpetuator of the police state during a time where police abolition is gaining momentum* Some of y'all: "Oh god! A band that's fun to make fun of is teasing something!"
This election is a shitshow.  Trump vs Biden Pence vs Harris  Who's got a black pill I can shovel down and does it come with cyanide?
i guess i'm not surprised but god damn biden really wants voting for him to be as torturous as possible huh  acab
BIDEN/HARRIS 2020  If I were trump and/or pence, I’d be quivering in my boots…!!!
Thrilled with the choice of Harris. She will make a meal out of Pence wait an appetizer. He doesn’t merit entree status. Biden/Harris  2020.

Wow, Biden just picked Kamala Harris for his VP. Just when I thought they could not fill their "stupid bucket" any fuller. She's a FAKE, so she will be a good fit for Biden.
Yes of course, as soon as I hear Biden/Harris, I think extreme radical left.....🤣

Yes they are. Joe's Crime Bill is what created the state the Police are in right now. Joe's bill did everything but "put the death penalty for Jay Walking" - Joe Biden -1994   But sure, lets go on how he will fix what he created.
Honestly, if you had asked Trump insiders off the record at the beginning of the Democratic Primaries, a Biden/Harris ticket would have probably been at the top of their "Worst Case Scenario" tickets to go up against.
Here's my prediction......Kamala will NEVER become President of the US.  Neither will Jill Biden.  er....I mean Joe Biden.  Got confused since Joe's wife has had more appearances on socialist networks than Joe has.
here's a friendly reminder
I'm not lying. Joe Biden wrote the Crime Bill that locked up millions of Black Americans. Joe's Crime Bill militarized the police force but sure, go on how I'm Lying about Joes Record. Hell, Under Obama/Biden, the ACLU Sued to close the Camps. But sure Jan, He's fixing it

Why are you defending her? There’s NO excuse for someone that is supposed to be educated like her! You people don’t give Trump a break but you’ll give someone like her a break. You give Biden a break too for the racist comments he makes? Of course you do!
"Mr President, we are reporting Biden has picked Co-VP's in both Rice and Harris, your reaction!"
Fact check is that this is not joe biden operating this account. Stupid ppl that say fact check at the beginning lets you know their ignorant betas
Thats all you got? He swallowed up everyones time? What policies do you feel Biden has that are better than Trumps? Do you feel Biden is more adept at leading than Trump? If yes, how so? Biden being in politics for 49yrs and not done anything he says he will do is ok?
They were chosen for their skills as well. Biden knows how to vet and he does it well. All the women in the running have all the skills they need. We’re back to the cream of the crop choices, no more bottom of the barrel.
Also, Joe Biden

Not in a World where Biden is in the Whitehouse. If he wins, EVERYTHING we see a "sliver of light" of today will forever be sealed and put in the deepest recess of the Ocean.   Obamagate   Bidengate   Hurricane   Crossfire   FISA Abuses   Epstien/Maxwell  IT WILL ALL VANISH!!!
Amen, Ma’am, I am right with you.  Trust Biden to choose well for our nation.
No. One. Cares. You aren’t winning this election.  🇺🇸🇺🇸Biden 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸
As Mr. Varvel points out, Biden's head is missing a few pieces.
The only thing threatening Our democracy is the democrat's they are fighting for socialism look how well that worked for Lebanon now the people over thrown their government from all the corruption and now have no government that's biden that will be Us
White people are not keeping black people from voting it's politician's like biden who use black people to get in office use gangs to control their votes and Lewis knew this and did he march on hos fellow democrat's to change that
Biden will destroy America.
needs to get off the pot. Pick a damn VP already Joe! I like  She’s smart and she offers a contrast to Biden’s old school mentality. But whatever he does, he needs to do it NOW!
preferable option to  who is actively and transparently trying to dismantle this country. As a Republican,I will be voting for Biden because I see even more disaster if we have another 4 years of The Orange Clown we have now.
needs to be VERY careful in the coming weeks. This election is Groundhog Day. In 2016, we had two very unpopular candidates. And here we are again. Biden has a lot of baggage and he does make truly uncomfortable statements. However, a Biden Presidency is much more
Plus she has experience with Biden having served on the Obama administration.
I eagerly await Biden's announcement for his VP.
Is Biden pining for the fjords?
Fuck Joe Biden!
Yes, Biden isn't going to fuck over the USPS
Hope your his VP #vicepresident #biden
So.....Biden-Harris 2020 huh?
Can we throw out the "he's mentally unfit" platform against Biden yet? They're both mentally unfit, obviously.
Give it a break Biden tweeters, he's lost already, mentally and physically.
Dr. Biden, a request.   Suggest to Joe that he should publicly support the relief package by . . and .   We need it.
So John Kaisch is going for Biden who has said himself he's got the most progressive platform ever. Don't see anything conservative about that, but its not a surprise. Many elites and life long politicians are going for Biden so they can get or keep their power.
Fact Check: Joe Biden Has NOT Promised To Outaw Gas-Powered Cars If Elected President
I guess anyone with zero discernment, and even less intellect, who might actually fall for this BS, would meet the litmus test for being a Biden voter. 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
It’s a good thing we have this guy instead of Joe Biden, right? Imagine if you had someone up there whose mental acuity wasn’t ... oh, wait. Never mind.
How the hell did we not want Biden or Harris and now they’re telling us Biden and Harris is our only hope? I feel cheated.
Wasn't it possible when Obama and biden did it?
Interesting to hear reporter ask  if Susan Rice becomes Biden's VP its to help coverup the worst political spy scandal in American History. On Sunday when I heard  say the investigation would end if Biden was elected I got a little depressed. Then...

is such a partisan that she says things that anyone with a brain knows is just not true. Biden is not and has never been a good debater. Admittedly....its amazing to me that a man with dimentia could beat 20 other socialists for the nomination.  Best of socialists
Haven’t the Democrats run Chicago for years? And it’s still as segregated as ever? What makes people believe Biden has the answers to racial and social injustice? When local officials can’t even take a step in the right direction
via  Trump does not understand how pathetic he is in comparison to President Lincoln or any other President.  If he were a gentleman he would resign instead of putting the nation through more of this.
Let’s let former VP Biden run his own campaign shall we?  I trust him to do what he believes is best.
Biden was never my first choice for a candidate. As an Independent voter, I'm really getting weary of voting for the lesser evil. If it were any other election, I'd be voting Jo Jorgensen, but this isn't any other election. Biden has my vote regardless.
Of course I'll vote. I voted for Sen Warren in the primaries but VP Biden HAS to pick a black woman.          times they are a-changing.
Ever been polled if you were voting for  or  I haven't. The polls say that #trump is only 3% behind #Biden.   I do not trust them, but 3% is within the margins of error &amp; about the same as when the #FakeNews said  was going to win in 2016!
Sadly, both Portland and Seattle have small, hardcore groups of anarchists who don't really have a vision beyond destroy it all. They don't care if they hurt Biden. They just revel in chaos and don't care who they hurt. This is not Antifa or BLM or Dems, they're just destroyers.
You mean the China Virus which started in China and Trump restricted travel from China to stop the massive infections of American citizens?   The policy that Biden and the Dems thought was racist.
It's August 10th, 2020 and Joe Biden has yet to pick a running mate OR do an in person interview.   Thus far, no info from the   #JoeBiden #Biden2020
I'll vote Biden no matter who he chooses❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
Almost as creepy as Joe Biden.
Why does the #Biden2020 campaign make choosing a VP feel like that weird show "The Bachelor". Will Biden present his VP w a Rose!? #Enough WE WANT #DEMOCRACY not another reality show failure!  Ambition Has Always Been ‘Ladylike’
Seems to me that there are a lot of Republicans doing videos stating they will be voting for Biden!! Guess they finally realized Trump is unbelievably stupid!
A great reason not to vote for Joe Biden.
As a liberal, I don't think  is the guy. Sorry, not sorry...  y'all claim I can't have proper ideals or leadership because I have a stbi (brain injury) 2 years ago after a mugging, but Biden has a WORSE stbi that's 32+ years old, and y'all don't even blink. H i larious
He looks very unimpressed that Biden wants to talk to him.

I thought that was going to say "Biden unlikely to finish a sentence"... I've been reading too much BabylonBee 🙈
Every woman on Biden's shortlist is better than either Pence or Haley.  Anyone Biden picks for his cabinet will be more qualified than anyone on trump's current cabinet.  Anyone hinging their vote on Biden's choices is missing the big picture. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

Obama/Biden wasted billions of tax payer funds on failed pipedream solar projects (money laundering) like Solyndra and A123...please.
Just another lib name calling. I asked if there is anything you can tout that Biden has done or is planning. And your response is he's never been Pres. So for the first time during a pres election, a candidate's record and platform don't matter.
People who want Biden to pick a woman POC  will vote for him whether he does nor doesn't.  Biden should pick Al Franken.
You used Biden and “think” in the same sentence
Sitting around thinking today ...How TF has Biden not gotten the VIRUS yet He sniffs everyone
This was about Biden's OBVIOUS dementia. Behind a podium he's funnier than bad lip reading. What have you offered that was of any substance.
Nancy Pelosi said, “China would prefer Joe Biden” to be president.   Here's why:  -Biden led the effort to grant China “Most Favored Nation” status &amp; supported their membership to the WTO   -Biden was the leading pitchman for the TPP which would have killed 450k U.S. jobs
Interesting video. In summary, Democrats need to do their job. I've  never thought Biden was the answer to everything. I still consider myself  unaffiliated but one step at a time. Trump must go.  Then still a lot of work to do. I don't know how anyone keeps up. Exhausting.
Why Trump is unlikely to pull off an election surprise against Biden like he did with Clinton
ask yourselves why is biden sooooooo afraid to debate Trump a real leader wouldn't be
Remember when you ran away from Andrew Neil like a little bitch? Pepperidge Farms remembers. I wouldn't trust a guy that gets murdered on tv by the likes of Andrew Neil to be able to offer any competent diagnosis of Joe Biden's faculties.
Phone bank for Biden!!
Your son wasn't a longtime Senator, former Judiciary committee chairman, and Vice President of the United States. Biden is and is by far the best choice to be president.
Using “Joe Biden” and “thoughtful” in the same sentence? 🤣😂🤪 #copolitics

Been doing for years why is there a problem now democrat's going to tamper with it either way use illegals to vote by mail and unregistered immigrants that's why I want to do like pelosi start biden's impeachment and demand a recount

Joe Biden, women's groups expect sexist and racist attack on his running mate, and are working to blunt them. - The Washington Post
He's missed something...  Does he think he'll still be in charge when Biden takes over?
Yes, we've never even heard of Joe Biden until this year. We're very familiar with dotard Donnie.
Nor have the Democratic Party who has had ample opportunity in Senate hearings with AG Barr &amp; recent subcommittee hearings and have refused. Nor has Joe Biden that I’ve seen anywhere.
Everybody has their own percentages to this, but I'm convinced Tom is describing reality here for a lot of people.  If Trump wins, I think it will be because those same people look at Biden and his masters and see zeroes on the right side of problems and solutions.
Except KFC would come out and disavow and condemn the arsonists. BLM has not, nor has the elected Democrats in office, nor has Biden.

I want to vote for this Joe Biden instead of the center right one that won't stop rambling racist nonsense.
And biden has been pictured with, and was great friends with the leader of the KKK. So, bidens action of being a friend to one, or trump having someone he isn't controlling yell white power..
poor biden he is just the dnc sock puppet
If trumo doesn't get reelected he's fired. Biden better fires the whole bunch of them.
Keep wondering where does biden want to buy this clean energy I know polis and hinkenlooper want to get it from Canada because they both invested in companies up there which is a violation of Our Constitution
Colo. great example we get all these companies to move here then the democrat's tax the shit out of them so they pack up and leave taking their jobs with them that's obama that will be biden
biden keeps saying Trump is helping his rich friends what rich friends did obama help besides the democrat's let's see China, insurance companies, the medical profession, and car manufacturers
biden and pelosi keep saying they are fighting for democracy but want to turn this country into socialism which will take Our rights away and make the poor even poorer helping the rich get richer
Have you explained why you might vote for Biden? How would your life be improved by him being President versus Trump? It’s always easier to start a conversation off with facts.

When the Trump cult and propagandist call Joe Biden racist, the irony is out of this world. Trump is the most racist President since Woodrow Wilson, maybe even more.

I think the evidence for Obamagate is too overwhelming for ppl not to do time, that said, these elites seemingly get away w everything from illegitimate war to fondling children so who the fuck knows.   No need for him to spy on Biden, he’ll sabotage himself every time he speaks.
I read it and Cates is on to something here. Makes me think the reason they nominated Biden was to give him (and them) cover on the Ukrainian scam. Anyone seen Hunter lately? Wasn't he supposed to go to court with his baby momma?

Which he did...what else because Biden has literally made zero new recommendations. He also said that Trump was overreacting and that his travel ban was “hysteria and xenophobia.”  Biden also hasn’t left his home town in months. These are all documented facts.
He clearly said that Democrats POLITICIZING the virus was the new hoax. In the same speech he talks about the travel ban (that Biden called “hysteria and xenophobia”) and developed a task force and put money into it BEFORE we lost a single person.

When Biden wins, Trump will immediately get on twitter stating the election was rigged and corrupt. He will then do a press conference stating the same and does not accept the results, and will sue. His final thing will be to not peacefully transfer power to Biden!
Sure but we can say that about 50% of Americans. My point being let's not get catty now. Biden will produce many opportunities to needlessly critique and this is what people hate about elections. He's done enough to criticize without stooping to this
Liar! At least Biden isn’t cheating and lying during the election! Character says a lot about a person! As a Christian, character, honesty, compassion and leadership mean a lot to me. Tearing people down is not what Jesus would ever do.
IMO; 'We, The People' have given #Biden a cognitive test, And HE FAILED!!! If he is totally Cognitively OK...#DEBATETRUMP
What were you saying about it being debunked...yea, actually it was confirmed 100% by the Mueller report, our own intelligence, British intelligence and Russia admitting it.
When’s Biden announcing VP &amp; who’s your top candidate?  Mines unlikely, but I’m Stacey Abrams 100p.
Joe Biden's decision to select a Black women for VP is totally racist and confirms his extreme pandering to the Black community. The percentage of Blacks to the U.S. population being around 13%, selecting a Black woman reduces the field to less than half of the black population.

Correction:  Joe Biden's handlers have reportedly selected his running mate.
Biden has a long history of mangled verbiage and that is what I saw in the comments about diversity more than anything else. I don't buy for a second that Biden is anything close to a racist. Plenty of black leaders in 1994 wanted that crime bill too.

despite all the plastic surgery biden has done the more I see him and pelosi the more they look related and they both say the same thing look at what I did, " I did it " all they have done is put their needs before America and The People vote them out
if biden was a real leader and has all these great ideas on how to rebuild our country then how come he's not working with the Republican's right now instead he wants to wait while this country suffers to get in office so he can so those famous words I did it
Trump calls people on their shit and they don't like that if he lied like biden this country would have his back 100% do we really want biden in office
Women got upset when Trump was accused of sexual harassment and yet are willing to vote for biden who was caught on video for sexual misconduct and accused of sexual harassment sounds like women are going backwards when they vote for biden

here's the truth the democrat's want Trump out of office because he's hurting their profits from China can't believe I had to say that can't believe I have to say this biden has a personal grudge against Trump just like pelosi and is out for revenge
Been worse if biden was in office he would have this country on lock down small but would have failed even more and be more people out of work the only way you could have controlled this virus is if the democrat's have the cure ready

I mean I'll vote for Biden because Trump is not only terrible at every level, but I believe he is legitimately dangerous. I just wish Dems had picked any of the other much better options.
He has come out and said he wants to forgive student loans too. Whether or not he will is pretty subjective right now. But eventually people have to be tired of voting the lesser of 2 evils. Biden is awful. He's just significantly less worse than the other option.
Even if Biden will do those things, I still vote for Joe!
The best thing that can happen to the Dems is Biden picks someone like Susan Rice for VP then steps down. Let someone like her reshape the party. Biden sure ain't gonna do it and Pelosi has blocked progressive legislation her entire career.
The President should stop talking about Biden as he gets it all wrong....He will never stop.  Trump should tell us what he plans to do the next 4 years...He will never do that. A real candidate would.
As a ratfucking exercise, this seems ill-considered. I do not know of any potential Biden voters Kanye appeals to. The only explanation that makes sense if that they believe the racist trope they made up about blacks voting for someone only because they’re black.
But will Biden realize it?

No MSM, Russia's not working to damage Basement Biden, He's doing fine destroying his campaign all by himself
You should join my Presidential campaign. I’m not accepting any donations. My campaign depends on convincing people to help me save the planet. Joe Biden is not smart like me.
Joe Biden can’t touch me intellectually. We need a president who can deal with the big problems. Joe Biden would kick the can to the next administration and cause irreparable harm. I’ll save the planet.
So, today’s lesson, class, is to take EACH of these bullet points, and ask two questions:  1. What if  hadn’t been elected in 2016?  2. What if Joe Biden gets elected in 2020?   In closing, “elections have consequences” - - BarackObama

The consensus seems to be that our system, as ideally inclusive, is severely flawed. It makes a difference to most progressives (like those in office) that Biden defeats Trump. Whatever-I-wantism is the Trump virus.
The White House is laying the groundwork to say that if Biden wins it's because the Chinese stole the election for him.

Biden's lead is 11 points
So you’re saying you’ll move to another country when Biden is elected?
A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.
Biden &amp; Harris should start intentionally mispronunciating Trump &amp; Pence.   Troomp. Tromp, Tramp, Pants, Pince, Dense. Dough-nulled. Dunn-old. Mick. Mipe. Bike.   The possibilities are endless!

Good point. I feel as though it’s quite easy to earn my vote against trump tho. Also I don’t think that Biden has any incentive to move to the left
I didn’t elect Biden and Kamala. The democratic establishment shoved it down our thoats and now we have no other choice.
Me too. One guy I talked to for quite a while was pretty cool. I hope I at least got him thinking about some things. He was going to vote third-party. I shared all the reasons Biden shares my values and Trump does not. Who knows if I made a difference. Hopefully I did.
I was afraid too! This was my first night. Lots of nerves &amp; technical difficulties. But yes, one guy I talked to for quite a while was really nice, open to talking. He plans to vote third-party but thinks Trump is a great businessman. I shared the reasons I’m voting for Biden.
I mean, I hate Biden and Kamala with all my guts. They’re practically republican. But even 8 years of them is better than 4 more years of the hell Trump is carting is towards. Calling them out for old shitty policies won’t do anything because they are the establishment.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris just came to my house and forced me to eat kale, took my guns and sneered while telling me that Oakland is really in some other country.

My point here is not that the election doesn’t matter, it’s that there’s no need to criticize every person who doesn’t want to vote for Biden, because in many cases it’s irrelevant. The time would be better spent, like you said, convincing people of the importance of local races

This is a great piece by Kea. Though Kamala harris hasn't addressed zoning herself, her stance on transportation is a nice complement to Biden's climate plan, which does address zoning and housing as climate tools.

You and your criminal sidekick are NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GREAT ECONOMY. It's not so great any longer. You two have taken credit for the OBAMA/BIDEN success in re-building a FANTASTIC economy. YOU DIDN'T DO IT. OBAMA AND BIDEN DID IT. EVERONE KNOWS YOU ARE LYING AGAIN!
First, you are right about the BJ's but Mike is full of shit as usual. Rump and Penis rode in on the coat tails of Obama and Biden's booming economy. Rump got lucky on the timing and claimed credit for it all.
Yes. I saw that ONE about Kamala.   But you suggested he’s posting several a day about Biden, and I’m not seeing it. Plenty about AOC, tho.

Almost zero? You and Pence have negative favorability ratings. NEGATIVE. But don't believe me. Read it here.
Yo..Executive Editor.  It's "whomever". Also:  Biden is far more likely to be assigning someone to empty his pee bottle.  Staying senile may help abridge his unmasking testimony.  Dotage is the only dodge the dottering dolt has left.

I respect that sentiment.   Ask yourself this though.   When RBG decides to retire (or if something horrible happens I know know) - who do you think will appoint a replacement who will most align with you? Trump or Biden?  Are they really the same to you?
I’m still sad it isn’t Castro/Warren but Kamala is incredible on the environment and Biden is running on the Green New Deal now. That’s enough to make me eager to vote them in. I’ll keep advocating on defunding police because I can walk and chew gum.

I used to not like Yang cuz I thought he was a one issue guy, but since he's out I can look at him somewhat positively since that one policy is a fucking good one. Like I think I can respect that but also he joined the Biden Democrat Homunculus so 🤷‍♂️
I've left a lot out of this rant. Don't shame people for how they vote or if they vote in this election. There's no correct answer. It's just another cycle of ghoulish establishment monsters backed by big corporations like always. I'm voting Biden and I'm incredibly ashamed.
I also think any talk of pushing Biden to the left is a completely nonsensical joke. He cannot give more than empty gestures toward the concept of healthcare as a human right, he's backed by corporate interests like every other candidate, he's racist, and he's a rapist, and more
I'm painfully aware of what it means to join forces with ghoulish conservatives to steal the throne, it happened in 16 and will likely continue to happen as the overton window shifts further to the right.  It's for this and more, that I can't possible imagine canvassing for Biden
Because of that, I can't help but feel guilty if the state turns red or continues purple. I feel like I'm being manipulated into voting for someone, now two someones, that I despise.  Biden is a perfect example of moderates sacrificing any values or positions to consolidate power
I've been stuck back and forth on voting Green or Biden this election for the past 4 months and I think I've reached a decision.   I'm currently registered to vote in Colorado which has had a complicated red/blue identity crisis for a while and is currently purple..
Hey Don, I translated your dog whistle: The “white racists” will be voting for me. They fear people &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where people of color would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with a black guy in charge!
You know that she's totally prepared for the ugliness which is about to begin. Biden too. Trump is publicly LOSING an election that hasn't happened yet. He's scared poopless.

In the articles I linked to they say that Biden has moved left here and expanded his climate policy aggressively since becoming the candidate.
Agree. Biden doesn’t need the debates.
My new hot take is that maybe Harris can actually push Biden to the left on some things. idk let's find out
Reminder: Biden is going to lose.
Looking forward to standing with all my “nasty” women friends this fall and electing the Biden/Harris ticket - a start to a better future   #TgetherWeRise
Which is why I agree with you--it is necessary to push them both to be better. And I am optimistic that Harris can be pushed leftward, far moreso than Biden. She even had an M4A proposal! I hope she pushes Biden to support that kind of thing.
And I don't want to tear Harris down, but I am dismayed, constantly, that Biden and Harris occupy an ideological space that is, at best, orthogonal to my own, and that through them, the DNC is trying to secure a 12-year electoral dynasty with worryingly limited goals.
Here’s more about Biden’s climate policy. I need to read up on this. There’s stuff I like and stuff I don’t. I live in a state with an economy very dependent on fossil fuel production, and I’d like that to go away, but it has to be done right.
Part of Biden’s climate policy is to hire laid off fossil fuel workers to help cap abandoned wells that are leaking methane. I love this idea.
I'm not trying to be obtuse about this, but I have eviscerated Biden on here plenty, because he has a bad voting record on a lot of things! I'm a socialist, and I am going to be disappointed with anyone we nominate who isn't.
It doesn't seem as simple to me as simply promoting anti-capitalism in the discourse, because that's not a position that either Biden or Harris is going to pick up.
Agree. I discuss in my book how Biden was behind many horrible crime bills &amp; I don't buy the revisionist history of Harris as anticarceral.  But they are political creatures &amp; tough on crime isn't popular now.  I'll swallow the bitter pill bc the alternative is sickness &amp; death
Sadly, many of the Yang/Bernie  YT influencers have devolved into pouty-assed whiners instead of strategic thinkers. They likely haven't READ  Biden's platforms on healthcare + other policies, which, PS, they'd like FAR more than Trump's (who is currently working on gutting SS)
Let’s be clear, joe Biden could probably have picked Tomi Lahren for VP and I’d still vote 😓
While not perfect on criminal justice, Kamala Harris sponsors the Green New Deal, backs a carbon fee and dividend, and focuses on environmental justice. We need this to prevent climate change from stealing society as we know it!
I can not support a pedophile in office. Flat out, i know logically he is the upper option. But morally i can not bring myself to support either of these candidates. I have no supportive evidence of my claim that biden is a pedophile just strong intuition based on some actions
If  can vote for Joe Biden then you can.
Just for receipts: I still think it's very likely that Trump will dump Pence &amp; pick Ivanka. Pence brings nothing to this off-the-rails sideshow &amp; you KNOW Trump cannot abide Biden getting credit for choosing a woman VP. He is gonna pick Ivanka, also because I think his plan is 1/
and just like after Biden took the primary lead, white liberal twitter is responding to anyone who raises legitimate concern over Kamala with “we just need to get Trump out!!!!! herstory is being written!!!!”
Yeah and you don’t acknowledge the fact that this administration inherited a good economy and did nothing to improve it. Just maintain it. They never hit any quarterly highs more than Obama-Biden. Look at the whole picture next time
On Climate, Kamala Harris Has a Record and Profile for Action
mixed-age presidential tickets are lowkey problematic... Kamala can’t consent to being Biden’s VP because of the power dynamic

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris came over last night and forced me to billet an entire caravan of Central Americans, and they turned my shower to drip mode.
Kamala was a co-signer of Bernie’s M4A bill, Biden literally let Bernie write his climate change policy (which would be a slightly better alternative to the Chinese hoax that it is currently), Biden called to defund the police, Biden wants affordable secondary education, etc.
BiGgEr CrOwD tHaN bIdEn 🤪
Perhaps not, because Biden already has the state locked up.
If they had chosen to back Bernie as nominee and then shoved Harris or another centrist onto the same ballot or even picked a more progressive running mate for Biden it could have united the party bc both sides would feel like their voices got heard.
The Trump administration is arguably the most aggressively and blindly pro-fossil fuels of any in modern American history. Thus the differences between the Biden+Harris v. Trump+Pence tickets on the climate crisis and fossil fuels are historically stark./4
Republican Lites/Blue Wave Dems will sing the praise of Biden and Harris bc she’s a woc while the actual left will be further alienated because there won’t be actual social change with these two. At best we’ll have an Obama-era admin.

Join us TODAY with  OIA's Senior Director of Sustainable Business Amy Horton and other  members as they discuss Biden's recently released climate plan:
You are correct. If Trump is elected they will no longer have a need to artificially prop up the financial system. If Biden is elected, they will make it crash to prove Republicans are better.
. is more aggressive on environmental and climate justice, the climate crisis and fossil fuels than is Biden. She introduced the Climate Equity Act with  Environmental Justice legislation with  supports a #GreenNewDeal and ban on #fracking.
Those were Biden’s admitted standards for a running mate. It’s not sexist or racist to call someone out for using race or sex as a disqualification for office.
You will do fine, but 98% of Americans will get nothing from Biden/Harris, and will continue to have any abundance extracted.  Other than the theatrics on the news, the actions of the administration will be indistinguishable from the Trump administration.
Jimmy Kimmel could find 10 people on the street, and not one of them would make a worse president than Trump, Biden, or Harris.
Bunch of idiots who hate Trump so bad they can't see how bad Biden/Harris are.  This election is garbage.  Candidates were chosen by the wealth class and promoted by state propaganda to continue wealth extraction and surveillance capitalism.  Revolution or tyranny. That's it.
Fuck. New ad from Trump says Biden/Harris is "Wrong for America". How can anyone argue against that?  #GeneralStrike   Demand congress and the president resign. We need an all-new government.

I profiled Catherine Lhamon back in 2017 and she would be an *excellent* choice for any spot in the Biden administration
I am unclear what political strategy to unseat Trump you are advocating. Or is pointing out Biden/Harris flaws the end goal here?
Election eve 2008 I identified the Zionist Emmanuel heading his cabinet.    Canvassers knocked on my door repeatedly the next day, demanding that I VOTE.  I will not VOTE for Biden.  He picked Kamala   and I said he had to appoint Jesus if he wanted me to vote for him.  FAIL...
Yes. Not sure why the Speaker would be involved in any way. This becomes a law enforcement matter and either DC police or marshals would remove him on a court order. And in any case Biden gets all powers of presidency regardless of where he is.
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Donald Trump on Joe Biden's VP pick.
the one thing (singular) to learn from pandemics and brutality is fact (singular, thx TYT); if "we" don't think the Biden ticket has learned to the left we are seriously over-estimating ourselves as "#potential gurus" rather than "#potential progressives"
I don’t feed oxygen to that sort. The follower count may be high, but there’s a closely spaced set of circles in the Venn diagram of Bros, Bots, and Bad actors that like to feed this sort of division.  I’d bet 95% of Warren voters are all-in on Biden/Harris.
Behind Biden's "historic" decision... to try to convince a % of the population to vote for him that might not have otherwise.  In spite of Harris' going after Biden with fire a year ago.  Huh.  Oh.  Cause this was his best bet.
Okay so a Biden Attorney General is..... who?
I agree. Bernie should have been the nominee; then there was this stupid shift around super-Tuesday.   Yes, we could all do it.  I just don't know how to reach people. Problem is, most folks are I know are already with Biden. And they largely don't care to push for anything else.
Reminder: #Kamala “voted with #Bernie 93% of the time.” She’s the 4th most progressive senator.
Biden Picks Kamala Harris As His VP As Trump’s Nightmare Comes True  via
Tammy Duckworth in place of mayor Pete. What would your dream Biden cabinet look like?
Joe Biden and DNC: I want Joe Biden &amp; DNC to support &amp; enact Medicare for All - Sign the Petition!  via
Your god already has revealed to you, such that you can be certain, you will vote for Biden. You're just suppressing that vote. ;)
Fuck Trump Fuck Biden Fuck Pence Fuck Harris  Fuck me And Fuck you   I'm out.
Well, the Biden/Harris party has moved away from prosecution as the Trump/Pence base has become simpatico with Trump's authoritiansim.  Anyway, one can hope . . .
I bet that Biden is more racist than Trump.
Biden calls black people 'the same' while Latinos are 'diverse' Biden picks a Black woman to get the black peoples vote Like that doesn't come across as racism at all to you? Lol
Just ran onto this article &amp; thought since  is trying to call into question Joe Biden's mental state, he should be held accountable for his own!
I'm not in for it. There was almost zero chance of Biden getting my vote, but still. This guaranteed it's just another year of voting green for me. My vote's a protest vote that has (hopefully) enough voters behind it to be noticed. That's important to me. Forever optimistic🙂
They should just make this into a Biden-Harris campaign ad.
You dance with them that brung ya.  Biden was dead in the water until S. Carolina, and the pissed off wave of black women.    This ain’t a left-brain analysis thing. It’s a right-brain arts-and-emotions thing.   That’s a path-to-WH thing, pure and simple.
As one of your constituents, I CANNOT WAIT to vote Biden/Harris and Hickenlooper in November! #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #GoodbyeGardner
I donated. August fund raising for Biden will be through the roof.
The differences between Biden+Harris vs. Trump+Pence on issues of environmental and climate justice, the climate crisis, and fossil fuels could not be starker. I've never seen such a monumental difference in my history of covering these issues in U.S. Presidential politics. /5
And, like Biden, Senator Harris also took a "no fossil fuel money pledge" refusing to accept money from the industry in her campaign; will end new leasing of oil and gas operations on federal lands and waters, and will end federal subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. /4
As a VP choice, many of  positions on fossil fuels and the #climatecrisis will push Biden to be much more aggressive. She's introduced ambitious legislation on climate &amp; environmental justice, supports a #GreenNewDeal, and a ban on oil &amp; gas #fracking.
If you think the "radical left" wanted anything to do with Joe Biden you're a moron. If they were in control, he wouldn't be the nominee, genius.
If Biden is elected (unlikely, but interesting to ponder), Kamala will be president by 2022.
I'll still vote for Biden but I'm sick and tired of lesser of two evils voting. And right now both sides are EVIL. Like I'm disgusted to be so devoted to anti-racism causes and have to vote for Harris.
Yes, I get it, the #BidenHarris ticket is prosecutorial.  But the #TrumpPence ticket is dictatorial!  And, you never know about downstream effects. Perhaps, Biden &amp; Harris will be especially solicitous of #BlackLivesMatter and #cjreform to make up for their carceral pasts.
They saw record profits under Trump. Bankers are backing Biden anyway.  via
It’s also the position in a Biden admin that would give her the least amount of actual power.
I'm trying to figure this one out too.  Not that I'll be heartbroken merely if Biden loses... I'll be heartbroken only if either Trump or Biden wins, so it's kinda inevitable at this point.
This quote from Jason Pye is the most delicious description of how easy it is for big corporations to buy/bribe American politicians.   via
Only joe Biden would be senile enough to choose an actual cop as his running mate
New debate format: TEAMS. Trump &amp; Pence vs. Biden &amp; Harris on stage together. Biden/Harris will tagteam Trump until he's so disoriented and desperate to protect his ego he starts going after Pence who's just been silently standing next to him awkwardly the whole time (as usual).
He's voting Biden for sure. You lose in more ways than one.
So, I came home today from spending a day with schizophrenic friend (seriously!)  And see that Kamala Harris is Biden's vp pick.  Feels like I never left my schizophrenic friend☹️
My dream ticket was Warren/Castro. Fully recognizing all the differences between the dream and reality, I’m ready to work my ass off for Biden/Harris. Let’s go! #BidenHarris2020
Biden wasn’t my first choice, in part due to his being 77, but Harris is only 55.
God fucking no. There wasn't much chance of my voting Biden anyway, but this certainly didn't help him. And I mean that beyond with folks like me... look where Harris polled before she dropped. She didn't excite ANYBODY, even the demographic she was "supposed" to excite. So...
Dig deeper, she was a terrible prosecutor (as per the Tulsi Gabbard debate).   Also, she said she "believed" Biden's accusers... Yet, here she is sucking up to him for the VP.
I will be voting for Biden and Harris (as the ordained successor) seems like probably not the worst person for the left to negotiate with! But this is the epitome of Politics-As-Team-Sport Brain Worms"Biden's Mandate, Election Sabotage, and Barr Bears Down" ft. KrisAnne H...  via
The DMVs are so backed up I may not have time to register to vote. We need help President Biden.
No doubt. And they keep doing it because they have faced no consequences. We can only hope when Biden wins that changes. For all of them.
It’s okay to criticize our fellow Democrats. Holding elected officials accountable shouldn’t be be partisan. If Kamala Harris is elected alongside Joe Biden this fall, we must hold her accountable for her record as a prosecutor in California.
So shall Joe Biden and Kamala Harris be voted in as President and Vice President. Come November 3,2020 Blue Wave is a Coming to clear the virus out of our white house and our country once and for all. See how it's done come November.
Obama was "You didn't build that," Biden is "I didn't write that."
And I don't care who they choose to be vice president I would like to have choices on my ballot not just Trump and Biden. I might even pencil in Mickey Mouse at least he is still a real American 🤣😂
proof.  show us where biden said he's 'going to take all our guns'.  you can't.  you lie like your father.
If Biden doesn't win 2020, Swampy-donald duck-hitler WILL. I've gotta say Biden's not as bad as the criminal-in-charge now. 2024 WILL BE A DIFFERENT STORY!
someone needs to ask biden if he'll free julian assance, leonard peltier &amp; other political prisoners.
joe biden wants to defund the police and loves the Soviet Union? Sounds great to me, lmao
Interesting how the FAR RIGHT casually ignores this while locking in on the one totally debunked accusation against Biden isn't it?
Mr 'Grab 'em by the Pussy' has 25 claims of rape, including DNA evidence against him while also wishing GhislaineMaxwell  well -- but no let's focus on the totally fabricated and unsubstantiated claims against Biden only lol
Conveniently ignoring Trumps 25 SUBSTANTIATED claims of Rape are we? One with DNA evidence????  Biden's SINGLE accuser has been completely debunked and continuously changes her story.  You all are fabricating lies! #BidenHarris #Biden2020
A vote that's not for Biden is a vote for trump. Just a reminder.
Biden not capable, obviously. So have #CAMELa debate #POTUS45 . Or she not up to it either?
Judge Jeanine says she doesn't believe Biden will be on the ticket for some reason. I have been saying that 4 mos. I have had the feeling that Biden will claim sickness &amp; the party will insert MO &amp; HRC as candidates. I have to say Judge we seem to be on the same wave length.
It’s depressing listening to Trump every day. His presidency is nothing but about him. Forget Covid or anything else. In 2016 Trump degraded Fiona she was ugly. Rubio small hands Cruz his wife ugly too. Trump has his nerve to talk about Harris being mean to Biden. What a joke
just because i trash biden, do NOT take that to mean i support trump.  i hate both of those lying, disgusting sexual predators.
And where is the DNC or Biden?
Biden /Jarris-Heckle and Jeckle.
Biden/Harris. Best gift Democrat’s could give President Trump. LMAO
Defeating Trump in November will not lead to the defeat of fascism. The Republican Party will continue to move towards fascism, naturally pulling the Democratic Party to the right, if the Biden administration doesn't fundamentally change the system
Guess this works for biden now too 😂😜🤷🏽‍♂️
question:  if something happened to biden that caused him to drop out before november...........what happens?  does the next candidate with the most votes (bernie) step in or does the dnc again install who they want?
mine is when she called biden a racist in the debates then kissed his ass for the vp.
Oh did biden buy  ?
Almost too impressive? Chance over overshadowing Biden?
Joe Biden is scheduled to make his first appearance with newly chosen running mate, Kamala Harris, during an event in Delaware this afternoon.
As a senator, Harris has been aligned with Biden on Israel: She is seen as a strong supporter with ties to AIPAC, the country’s largest pro-Israel lobby, and unlike some Democrats has not broached the idea of conditioning aid to Israel to influence its policies.   DEAL BREAKER!
how many times were we told 'we don't need you'? how many times were we trashed &amp; insulted?  NOW they say we have to support biden-harris??  yeah, well, whoever says we have to can go fuck themselves.
net worth of biden:    11 million  net worth of harris:       6 million  just saying.
Sadly Biden barely has enough mental capacity to hold a conversation let alone run a country. The Democratic Party has kept the minority in poverty for a very long time I wish they would do their research and not depend on cnn or major news outlets for information.
you're working on the premise that things will change &amp; get better with biden.  that's the flaw.  both sides work for corporations.
the dnc rigging 2 elections is NOT democracy.  NOT representing what the majority of people want ie med4all, is NOT democracy.  we seem 2 have different definitions of democracy.  biden will fill cabinet posts w/goldman sachs &amp; billionaires .  BOTH parties love their oligarchs.
i'm not a harris fan, but she'll eat him alive.  likewise, trump will wipe the floor with biden.  what choices...ugh.....
while i appreciate your freedom of choice, i do not believe biden will move america in the direction we need. no med4all &amp; his obsession with cutting ss.  i can't believe in all the people in america it comes down to the 2 most crappy choices.  just can't go there-voting green.

I love being called out by liberals that by criticizing Joe Biden from the left, it makes me a Republican. Bitch, I've gone 7 years strong without ever voting for the GOP. If I'm a Republican, I am absolutely terrible at it 😂
A vote that's not for Biden is a vote for trump.  is a trumpster trying to divide trumps only real opposition.
Best Biden/Kamala take of the day
This is the best thing you’ve done so far President Biden.
sorry bernie, i supported you from 2016 on.  but i will NOT vote for either trump or biden.  both are liars, sexual predators &amp; NOT progressive.  i'm voting green.  the dnc played this....they can live with it!
As a woman, I’m stoked about Biden’s VP pick. As a human, I am filled with hope and excitement for the future of my grandys - Vote #BidenHarris2020
So excited about Biden’s pick for his running mate, Kamala Harris. A great moment in history! What great credentials she has.
I'm so glad that I don't live in a swing state and can vote for an actual progressive ticket without affecting Biden's chances.
What the f*ck are you talking about? It's not like Biden narrowed his choices to Kamala or someone like Barbara Lee... lol, anyway, we know you would be in tears if Tucker Carlson stopped inviting you on his show 🤷‍♂️
While Twitter is buzzing about Biden’s VP pick, FB is obsessed with sex trafficking conspiracies that involve all of Hollywood, everyone from Oprah to Tom Hanks.   We’re seriously doomed. Half the country have completely lost their minds.

Joe Biden should’ve just picked any random police chief from around the country lol

Never forget and go after Pres. Biden like hell until he relents or his VP takes the reigns.
Biden can't win. What we really need is enough dialogue and inclusive politics to find  a spot on the Trump administration.
Why do u continue ro let Trump go on and on and he is lying about Biden.. Obama has a good health program and Trump has been trying to destroying since day one. Mail in ballots work good because we do it in Colorado.  No problems
He should debate ! Biden show the nation that you are capable of dealing with other leaders of the world without your wife talking for you.
it will go exactly how the last 50 years of his life have gone..lie bully cheat sue sue sue threaten bully  block deflect blame steal cheat lie lie cheat sue sue etc. but in the end  JOE BIDEN WILL BE OUR PRESIDENT. WE JUST HAVE TO PREPARE FOR A MARATHON OF OFFENSES AND ASSAULTS
Lol, hope you're ready for another term. Biden can't win.
Far more than that are against Biden.
The latest intelligence assessment reflects concerns not only about Russia, but China and Iran as well, warning that hostile foreign actors may seek to compromise election infrastructure, interfere with the voting process or call results into question.
biden is a rude, sick mf!
Didnt see Biden in the mix
Biden is really that dumb isn’t he!
Biden also said he would no longer allow the federal government to confiscate land for the purpose of erecting a border wall, and that all lawsuits between landowners and the government would be dropped.
So are these biden videos an attempt to make him look like an average joe or the campaigns attempt to have him off himself?
I’m so sorry, I absolutely hate Trump. My promise to you is I will do everything in my power to see that Biden is elected.😢❤️✊️
You think the dems would pay more attention to the c19 death toll co consideing those are all votes for Biden #2020Election
Lmao conservatives want a government of control and oppression.  Nothing they do is for the people. Its for corporations. Dems by and large are just diet Republicans.  Like Biden. They arent true progressives
Imagine they take Biden on a WH tour, at the end they have a ceremony thanking him for his service, send him back to the basement thinking he ran, won, and served as president. 🤷🏽‍♂️ #ItsOkayToNotBeOkay #2020Election #2020predictions
Why do you think they keep dumbing people down into believing they have the Holy Spirit, when they don't? Why do you think they created all these distractions, and built a nation that contradicts scripture. Donald Trump, and Joe Biden aren't even real people.
what's with biden?  is he trying to out-orange the orange moron in chief?
I would like to hear you Mr Biden and other leading Democrats urge voters to contact the local elections office &amp; get absentee ballots now! The Republicans own the absentee ballots system and that's why they're against all inclusive mail-in voting during the pandemic! #DumpTrump!
If Biden loses to Trump in the general, that will be absolutely pathetic. Trump's response to the pandemic has been Hoover-level bad. Unfortunately, the Dem establishment would take a Biden loss as, "well, if he couldn't have defeated Trump, no one could have!" We're screwed 🙃
There are two candidates: trump or Biden. If your vote for Biden  is dependent upon his pick for VP you have shown yourself.  This is a privileged mindset.
In handcuffs maybe?? Then Biden can say "This AMERICAN CARNAGE STOPS RIGHT NOW" as part of his speech?
The problem with Biden is, he can't call out Trump on this issue because he's leaning into picking Susan Rice for his VP!
Really didn’t find anything wrong what Biden said when you compare what Trump has said about every race. Gosh making to much of it
anyone who is comparing biden to fdr is either brain dead or....................that's it.  brain dead.
no fan of biden, but you're a racist too!
After what happened with Joe Biden, it's amazing that people still can't see they live in a scripted reality! That's how they've been rigging elections for generations! Especially, since they're both on the same side.
i've predicted that if biden gets elected, he'll resign right after inauguration &amp; the vp will take over as is the plan.  the vp will be hillary.  i think that's why he's waiting so long to announce.  they know she's not well liked.
Conservatives, especially those who voted for Trump, cannot call out Biden for being a racist. Only lefties can do that because we have principles and don't call out racism only when the other side is doing it
Trump is WAAAAAAY more incompetent and unfit! There is not a SINGLE criticism you can levy against Biden that Trump doesn't rate far far worse on lol  #Biden2020
He said if Biden was elected, he would “hurt the Bible, hurt God.” 🙄 And then went on to assume the 2nd Amendment is religious doctrine. He’s beyond parody.
Trump just in case you wanna know  Biden and his wife regularly attend mass at Saint Joseph Church on the Bradywine in Greensville Delaware. Trump where do you attend church?
Biden for whaaa?
Biden don’t fall into Trump’s schemes he wants more debates. It doesn’t matter how many debates Trump has he will say he won them all like he did with Hillary. Just don’t let Trump follow you around the stage like he did with Hillary also. Trump up to no good.

I'm very much not a Biden/Harris fan (they're awful on the few issues that Dems and Libertarians often share common ground on), but I do see a Trump reelection as a systemic risk to our civilization. I wish we had RCV here in CO, that would make this decision trivially easy.
I've voted LP in every presidential election since 2004 (I missed the 2000 election since I was in the Philippines at the time and hadn't even thought of registering to absentee vote). I'm a Coloradoan and planning to vote Jo this time, but might vote Biden if polls tighten a lot

Don't confuse democrats; lawful, rational, voting citizens like me, with rioters.  There's a chance the rioters might vote for Biden but I'm guessing they are disconnected from society to the extent they won't vote at all.  Nobody is courting them for support; we don't need them.
I prefer a president who is awesome enough to NOT have to dominate. It's an ugly word. I also prefer a VP who doesn't remind me of a festering boil. Biden/Harris 2020. It's the winning ticket

It wouldn’t be Biden, that’s for sure.  Trump works constantly - never stops. They even criticize him when he plays a round of golf!
So funny that now you’re saying about Trump exactly what we KNOW about Biden.
So screw the debates &amp; the rest of the campaigns - just move Biden into the White House &amp; get it over with, right?  That’s how dumb &amp; corrupt a democrat is.  Screw elections, just get on with the Marxism!
Trump will destroy Biden in a debate.
Couldn’t be that Trump will clean Biden’s clock in The debates, huh? BTW the American people will never elect senile Joe Biden/Harris &amp; take the country into Socialism.  They can sequester Biden to try to protect him but the American don’t buy it. Trump by a landslide.
Hahahahaha. She’s below average. Especially if your vote is really for her and not for Biden since he’s got dementia
I’d like to report a threat to a protectee.   A television personality is saying that Joseph R. Biden will not live to stand for election.  Her name is Jeannine Pirro and there is video evidence.
Biden got BABB
You Trump Haters would love to continue hiding Biden by not having debates.  What are you Trump Haters so afraid of??
He’s doing if again. Quid pro quo. You elect me I’ll eliminate the tax I imposed on you. Someone tell Biden to make the same forgiveness claim.
He just gave rave reviews for Kamala Harris and referenced Biden as the next president of the US.
Also, your repeatedly calling Joe Biden "evil" sort of gives it all away.
And he has the gall to call Joe Biden creepy!?!?
Notice Biden/Harris didn’t tout any of Biden’s accomplishments or successes during his 48 political career.  It’s bc he had none.  Although he &amp; his family did enrich themselves bc of his corruption.

This suburban housewife would be thrilled to have affordable housing in my neighborhood! I'm running for town board to help make it happen. Oh - and I would walk over burning coals to vote for Biden.💁‍♀️
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris came over last night and forced me to billet an entire caravan of Central Americans, and they turned my shower to drip mode.
May every single one of our nasty women tribe vote for Biden-Harris 2020!
I'm Irish pasty white, live in the burbs and I'm voting Biden/Harris. I would love more affordable housing for my community
Funny. Myself and my suburban pals are all voting for Biden. We actually despise you. And affordable housing is a great thing. Why shouldn't the person making my coffee live near me?
'I think it's great' – Wall Street execs are glad that Biden picked Harris
Joe Biden is in the early stages of dementia.  So there’s that.
Biden can’t even read a sentence on a teleprompter, but he will unite &amp; heal us &amp; restore our soul!  You’ve gotta be kidding!
Biden is their puppet.
I helped progressive friends of mine during the Obama transition try to make the case for commercial crew/cargo, advanced technology development, and propellant depots, and I'm sure I could work with those groups again if Biden/Harris win in November.
If they won, I would be happy we dodged the bullet of a second Trump term, but wouldn't be super happy about what Biden and Harris would do, especially if they flip the Senate. But I'd also probably be able to work with them and find occasional common ground.
So I guess in some way's I'm actually in the "meh" category. I think for all her faults, she and Joe are at least basically decent human beings, and if CO narrows a bit from Biden's current 13pt lead vs Trump, I could see myself plugging my nose hard enough to vote for them.
But as discouraging as her and Joe Biden's records are on criminal justice issues, somehow Trump and Pence have found a way to be even worse. I could never see today's Biden or Harris encouraging police violence or shielding cops from accountability like Trump would.
I mean, I don't see her as being much worse than Biden or Gore, or frankly much worse than Bill Clinton or Obama. For issues I care about like criminal justice reform, I'm not happy with her record and I'd be less skeptical of her if she'd own her past mistakes as a prosecutor.
Behind Biden's "historic" decision... to try to convince a % of the population to vote for him that might not have otherwise.  In spite of Harris' going after Biden with fire a year ago.  Huh.  Oh.  Cause this was his best bet.
Obama on Harris as VP: 'Joe Biden nailed this decision'
I agree. Bernie should have been the nominee; then there was this stupid shift around super-Tuesday.   Yes, we could all do it.  I just don't know how to reach people. Problem is, most folks are I know are already with Biden. And they largely don't care to push for anything else.
My plan is to drop off my mail vote at the dropbox maybe a week before the election. It's unlikely polls will move massively in the last week since a lot of people will likely vote early. If things are tightening (ie &lt;6-8pt lead) I'll seriously consider voting Biden/Harris.
Hmm.  You are the only one who says that you will keep POC out of the suburbs, that will protect slave owners statues, and says BLM are terrorists.  So, I don’t think people will believe you on Joe Biden.
Had to break it to you but I never said I wanted Biden to lose
Biden has been out and about following social distancing protocol. God I can’t wait for the debates to start.
Trump would have tweeted that Karen Bass was a dog.  He didn’t really know her, maybe she brought coffee or something.  Joe Biden called her, like an adult, and a man who cares about America.
I’m in. Great Pick Joe Biden.
You worry about the NY AG. The 2nd A is not going anywhere. #Biden/Harris2020
I'm not in for it. There was almost zero chance of Biden getting my vote, but still. This guaranteed it's just another year of voting green for me. My vote's a protest vote that has (hopefully) enough voters behind it to be noticed. That's important to me. Forever optimistic🙂
I donated. August fund raising for Biden will be through the roof.
Oh, am I going to enjoy how they’ll kick your ass, Donnie. You’ll be humiliated and I hope you live long enough to suffer from jail for all you’ve done right after Biden takes over
I'm trying to figure this one out too.  Not that I'll be heartbroken merely if Biden loses... I'll be heartbroken only if either Trump or Biden wins, so it's kinda inevitable at this point.
So, I came home today from spending a day with schizophrenic friend (seriously!)  And see that Kamala Harris is Biden's vp pick.  Feels like I never left my schizophrenic friend☹️
Biden just lost any chance of becoming President She is widely unliked by people on both sides
God fucking no. There wasn't much chance of my voting Biden anyway, but this certainly didn't help him. And I mean that beyond with folks like me... look where Harris polled before she dropped. She didn't excite ANYBODY, even the demographic she was "supposed" to excite. So...
We will all be celebrating for the first time since you screwed up our lives. #Biden/Harris. But enjoy your pity party
Yes. Now you can vote for that man in the White House.  We are fighting for our country. Vote Biden/Harris!
I'm a registered Libertarian, but depending on how close the presidential race is in Colorado, I'm willing to plug my nose and vote Biden/Harris. They may be lousy in many of the few areas that Dems are sometimes good at (immigration, CJR, militarism), but Trump is uniquely awful
Now we know who picked her!  Beware!  Evil Soros hand picked Kamala for VP - Biden is an empty vessel.  Be very afraid, Patriots!   Vote Red!  Our country will be gone if we elect these anti-American Marxists.
You didn’t pick Harris; she was picked for you!  She was a vicious disgrace trying to demonize Judge Kavanaugh at his hearing &amp; many of us will never forget her vile interrogation of him.  Biden/Harris is the worst presidential ticket we’ve ever seen.  Where’s Hunter?
Biden/Harris 2020: Get Bus...ted.
Harris vs Pence on stage. It will be historic. Biden vs Trump on stage will be a massacre.
It’s kind of comical that Harris called Biden a racist, demanded an apology, never got it, yet is now his running mate...
I actually feel a little hope creeping in. #Biden/Harris2020
Make no mistake, Kamala Harris is the real presidential candidate. If elected Joe Biden will not make it past 2/1/2021 before he is declared mentally unfit, and replaced by her. This is a bait and switch like no other.
And Biden won't become president til 2021.
You are a class act, Ambassador. I know that you will play a prominent role in the Biden administration. Let's Go!
I am too Anna. Joe Biden is an honorable man of integrity and empathy.
And just like that trumpies try to make Biden look as bad as Trump.  This will never happen; Trump has waay too much baggage, too many accusations, too many payoffs, too many divorces and too many human failures.  #MeToo is alive and well, thankfully.
I bet Biden’s binders are thicker than Mitt’s were.
You mean VP pick has been revealed to Biden by his top staff of course.
You have absolutely nothing.  All you can do is try to tear down Biden, because you can't run on the disastrous results of the last 3 1/2 years.  Can't wait until you're gone, and the SDNY puts 45 behind bars.  Lock him up!!
And if ⁦ wins, we’ll have to learn Russian.  Trump says Americans will have to learn Chinese if Biden wins but offers little condemnation of Beijing - CNNPolitics
What else is new?  It's been this way since the late ‘80s.  I'm rooting for Harris.  She'd make a great president if Biden were to be incapacitated.
You interpret Biden's actions as sexual.  I think they're more misplaced grandfatherly affection; not necessarily sexual.  Agree it's weird and gross, but he's not Trump with huge amounts of sexual baggage that trumpies choose to ignore.
I disagree.  There is no evidence he ever did anything sexual.  You perpetuate this false narrative.  Your cult leader did say “In 10 years I'll be dating her.  Can you believe it?”.  20+ allegations of sexual assault against Trump and you perpetuate this lie about Biden.
I don't excuse it.  I think it's creepy.  I am disappointed in the DNC's selection.  I’m not voting for Biden as much as voting against Trump who is 1000x worse.  As usual it's the choice of the lesser of 2 evils.
Those videos show Biden sniffing hair, that's all.  I agree it's weird but one could make a credible case for grandfatherly affection in all cases.  Nobody has filed suit although I think a couple said it was awkward.  Contrast this with 20+ allegations against Trump.
We need Florida to send Joe Biden their electoral college votes in November.
Trump also suggesting that men will feel insulted by a woman VP. That should win over the women suburban vote.
If Trump stays in office you‘ll almost assuredly lose your right to choose. If Kasich is willing to go against his personal beliefs to endorse Biden &amp; reclaim America from the grips of the Trump administration (ensuring a pro-choice replacement for RBG) — why are you against it?
The entire Biden Family is corrupt &amp; they’re eager for Joe to be President so they all can enrich themselves for another 4 yrs.

Biden can’t support his own train of thought for more than a few minutes. I’m not saying he’s too old to be president, but I don’t think he’s all mentally there enough to take on such a large responsibility as being the president of the United States of a America.
What I am really, really looking forward to is the first thing President Biden says that triggers Republicans.

Seen Biden on a bike yesterdys, and then this:
I don't believe either candidate is suffering from dementia. Internet memes provide scant to zero evidence. Now if you want to compare their health, Biden is clearly more healthy than Trump:
I think it's a byproduct of his anti dementia drugs, along w the tardive dyskinesia. You know they're attacking Biden because of Trmp's dementia. Everything he does is projection
He's a more immediate danger--but the Dem collusion with endless wars keeps us in perpetual danger as well.  Get the codes out of 45's inside pocket and then fight Pres Biden at every turn until he fights for the lives of the 90%.

I agree it's a precarious situation. Biden sounding like a 78 yo white man when he talks about race doesn't help. But I'd hope that people will give the selection a chance to demonstrate her commitment to the "cause' before dismissing outright if she is not black.

I'm half Sicilian. I figure that has to make me at least 1/8 black. But I'm all in on Biden.
Fingers crossed for a somewhat inspirational VP pick. Biden just needs to avoid talking about race, except for when policy relates to it. He sounds like any 78 year old white man sounds when talking about black people- which is.... not good.
Why would anyone even think this?  Can somebody defend this position or are her marbles just as loose as Joe Biden?

This is my only hesitation with governor Whitmer as Biden's running mate. Michigan has been through so much and she seems to be a great governor. However, my impression is that you also have a solid Lt. governor who would follow in her footsteps.
Yes, saying Trump and Clinton are both bad in 2016 is why we are here. If we can’t see that Trump is so many times worse than either Clinton or Biden, then this country deserves the worst that will happen under another 4 years.
Nothing New - CNN covers for Biden constantly.  CNN has absolutely no credibility left.
So?!  Have you noticed there are no rallies &amp; this isn’t a normal election year? Good for Trump for getting his message out anyway possible.  Hey, CNN forgot to report on Biden’s latest insult to African Americans today!
I love how the Trump boys always try to highlight Biden’s cognitive deficiencies. But Dad? Oh, he’s fine... 🤪
Or I care for reality as I perceive it affecting myself and others, and so care about stating whether or not I think it's relevant to me, personally, whether Biden cares about the bible -- because I recognize that I'm a member of a larger population.
I don’t care if he picks a bar of soap for VP.  I’m voting for Biden.
In a sane world, Trump's abuse of national emergencies, temporary appointments, etc would lead the next congress and presidency to dramatically pull back on the power of the presidency. I'm just really skeptical that Biden and the Dems will lift a finger to do so if they win.
Can’t believe you’d vote for Biden. Emotions aside, do the right thing.
As we all know, Joe didn’t write this.  I doubt he even realizes that he said what he said. Let’s end this charade, horrible sham, being perpetrated on the American people.  Everyone can see Biden disintegrates daily. No matter how much u hate Trump, he will win.
War Biden! Before I just was picking lesser of two evils now you say I’m voting for Kratos? #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
What. The. Fuck. Do I HAVE to care what the bible says?  Me, I'd rather care about what's going on hereabouts.  And so. Why should I care if Biden is "for" or "against" it?
"Hurt God" -- That whether Biden would do this or not is scary as hell.  "God" seems like it should be the least of our concerns while people die needlessly from starvation, homelessness, or lack of medical care -- like from pharmaceutical control of medications. Ugh.
What’s more plausible? This guy stealing from people in the name of god, or Biden hurting god? #libertyuniversity #trump

Republicans are so scared of a barely moderately-to-the-left Joe Biden that they are willing to dismantle the constitutionally-mandated  to win, and on top of that if we lived in a country that made sense, their party would be disbanded as a punishment.

Yeah ask Nancy she’s a Catholic and so is Biden!
But if you don't vote then you don't get the chance to have the protests and the movement matter. Trump will never budge or change anything. But Biden/harris will have to bend to the will of the people. If history shows anything its that they do bend when it comes down to it.
Biden should not agree to debate unless a fact chk is done about every statement
If Biden was still with it I imagine he’d be pretty pissed off at whoever is writing lie after lie on his Twitter.

Ya think they had a choice? 4 more years of a lunatic or Biden!
Biden is the biggest racist on earth. Harris is the biggest fake on earth. She now thinks she is black if that gets her in power.
well, he probably didn’t pick her. The DNC picked her and then told Biden that he picked her. He knows that he can’t remember anything, so he believed them and ran with it.
So in other words they are going to censure conservative videos if they say anything about 'Baffoon' Biden or 'Lot Lizard' Harris.
Again, hope I'm wrong, but mark my words-- Biden wont be any better. In fact he'll be just as bad. And if something happens to him and Kamala becomes president? I'd expect the same fash actions as trump's regime.  I really want to be wrong : /
We do not need leaders like this. Our young people my grandkids need adults as leaders.
And Biden is somehow even less progressive than Obama. And Kamala is a fucking cop. She would rather incarcerate innocent people to let them fight fires for free than let them live their lives freely. They arent agents of change. If I am wrong Ill GLADLY eat my words.

The legislature would change that and they have a veto proof majority. This was discussed at length when Warren was being considered for VP. It will be a non issue if Biden wants her in his cabinet, as it would have had she been chosen.

Oo we got vocab now! Literally everything on that little list you made Biden has said he will make no change to. I don’t get where you think he will do anything better. He has said numerous times he will change nothing
I always hope so, but does it actually?   And though I hate voting for the lesser of two evils, I’m afraid to not vote for Biden becuas trump has got to go!
Say one is better (between trump and Biden) than the other makes me question your ethics. They are the same. To sit there and ask me “what would you rather have - the same shit for 4 years in red or the same shit for 8 but in blue??” Of course I’ll pick the 4 years

I hate Harris so much, I'll never vote for Biden.  This week I realized Trump can win again.  I see the stupid Obama-Clinton   running the same failed campaign as in 2016.   #NeverKamala
I know republicans don’t believe in polls, for good reason, but there are strong indications that it’s gonna be a landslide win for democrats. I’d rather be Biden in the lead by 11 than Trump down by that much. You can only pull off so many miracles when you don’t believe n Jesus
The tRump scum, bag man, that is heading up the USPS should be charged with election fraud by the Biden Administration
Everyone except me? I ALONE!!  I watched interview clip and an interview w/ Barnet. I think the “are you a junkie?” question was a continuation of his hypothetical. But, I like Biden. You have your preference. I have mine. The original post was on trump’s lies not Biden’s brain.
The Simpsons say VOTE FOR BIDEN
Joe Biden lying again... what a shock.
It was a solid press conference, now let’s have the Biden team answer some unscripted questions
The Dems were asking people to vote woke three times in a row, and since the economy wasn't tanking anymore, in 2016 the voters could react. This time a Biden/Harris vote is only about 1/3 woke. People can handle that.
Do you remember the Obama campaigns?   You could see vast support in places beyond Twitter.   I see it now, but not for Biden.   Biden and McCain signs are 1 in the same.
Ever seen a Biden yard sign?   Yea me neither.
Look at the little CNN, MSNBC puppets...no questions for Biden or the other one.
Nixon was more liberal than Obama, and president my boss was more liberal than biden...
Defeating trump and letting Biden become President for 8 years is an equal if not greater threat because it’s more long term. I don’t get what you’re not getting
It's temporary and who's wishlist is UBI on?   During primary the Democrats HATED the idea of UBI.  The liberal media literally ignored him, called him wrong name, showed pictures of random Asian guy claiming he was Yang.  If UBI was on wishlist Yang would be nom, not Biden.
I saw a Biden 2020 thin blue line sign today in someone’s front yard.  I almost crashed my truck
I'm envisioning the ad where Republicans (many formerly of this administration) endorse Joe Biden one by one - Rex Tillerson, John Kelly, James Mattis, Colin Powell.  Can we make that happen?
Biden is the most racist person on earth. BTW where is Hunter?
In CA, OR and CO, no matter how the people vote, those states will go to Biden.
President Trump  CREATED the biggest economic expansion in history. Lowest unemployment f/all in history.  Brought manufacturing back to the USA. Trade Deals! America First!  Obama/Biden=FAILURE. Economic disaster. Foreign policy disaster.  Harris &amp; Biden: Serial LIARS.
Huh? SS has spent over 400k annually on his golf trips. Him paying himself with GVMT $ negates the "not receiving pay"  I'm not voting Biden, I can't stand the current left politicians, but I'm also not a moron that falls for Trump's BS.   Keep being a blind follower, you do you.
Joe Biden is not fit to be president..he hides in the basement and all you idiot's speak for him. You are just using his name with the help of his wife..you should be ashamed of yourself. Talking about Bo...the one thing he has left to remember and you used it.
Biden and Harris our coming for our guns while calling for refunding the police. I'm out, Trump it is.
I'm being an adult and not voting for Biden.
How am I toxic for responding to your claim?   Also, I’m not a Bernie Bro, but a registered independent.   Like most independents, I don’t like the choices, but between Biden and Trump, the choice is obvious.
Would a dog wear pants like this? (Trump) Or like this? (Biden)
Yup and Harris will take over if elected and Palosi will be VP.Biden will probably announce his retirement on Jan. lol.
What it really sounds like is you are voting for Biden, and I don't like neoliberals!
Twitter/Social Media is always toxic, however the “Biden and/or Kamala isn’t who I wanted but we HAVE TO vote for them” and the “you can’t criticize them!! they’re our only hope!” is gross
Maxine Waters says Biden 'can't go home' without Black woman as VP - Business Insider
Babbling Biden and Kumalot will remove 100,000 a day.
Biden and Harris are all about confiscating guns and lobbing the softball term "mandatory buyback". So they don't want the police to protect us and they don't want us to protect ourselves. I'm Out, #Trump2020
Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
Biden was VP for eight years and has spent his life in Congress. He knows the countries. He had a press release yesterday naming them and the limitations of the deal Trump "negotiated."
Seriously Biden has to dial this back or Trump will crush him and idiot libs won’t understand why.
lol when did Biden say he would be one term lololol I swear
Perhaps why they’re having so much trouble framing Biden...not your typical “liberal elite”, so the canned attacks fall flat.
Biden and Harris actually know what their doing
#thanksobama and yes Joe Biden will be the fist President to rebuild a better economy for a second after being being VP when it was done the 1st time! All trump has done is ride on Obama's coattails and try to take credit for the things Obama has already done.. trump is a loser
It's not about beating Trump, it's about UHC, jobs, housing, and peace. Biden-Harris have nothing to do any of these. The party needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.

Of course, the odds right before the election more closely reflect polling average, where the odds now factor in three months of uncertainty. Bush in 2000 squandered a bigger August lead than Biden's.
But to point out the obvious. If he does not concede, his followers will stand behind him. Many of them have guns. Most, probably. They also make up the majority of LEOs, military, secret service, etc. It could take more than just "swearing in Biden" for transfer of the office.
even the vaccines not a cure dumbass 😂 so please put your plastic bag on your head and sit the fuck down 😂 yeah.. and you think Trump is going to be out of office in November? Biden had no chance even before he chose Kumswallah Harris as his running mate 😂 now it's a
“But Kamala is a cop and Biden votes for the Crime Bill.”
I do understand that.. maybe you’re not comprehending that I’m not a trump supporter nor am I supporter of Biden because I support the people that make this country run, not just rich people. I don’t know why you care so little
When will Biden answer questions?
Tweet saved for when Biden/Harris push your shit in
All I have is a high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way. Maybe the undereducated would be more likely to vote “left” if you assholes weren’t so goddamned condescending.
Venture way -- way -- behind the BFF bonhomie between #Biden and #Obama in this excellent  trip thru their complex friendship and the affiliated fault lines.  And yeah, Alex also gets big points for "BFF bonhomie"
I have high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way.
If the race does not start to tighten in the coming months, will the forecast start to favor Biden more? I’d like to hear Nate’s thought about that.
Awesome. 832 days till Biden's retirement party.
I love how Trump bashes Biden for not taking questions, yet Trump might take the question but not answer it.
Dude. You’re funny. Biden can barely function. Trump is the only one that can get it DONE
I would like to see a #Biden campaign ad that is just a compilation of  gutting Trump officials during hearings. #BidenHarris2020
Biden trying to take credit. Why?
Biden does not like Harris and Harris does not like Biden. It was obvious 3 days ago. He can't even operate his phone cause it was upside down. It is a disgrace and a sham show.
Trump gets tough questions from the media, Biden has not been asked one tough question yet. Biden tries to take credit for the mid east peace talks and how does that happen when he has been in the basement forever. Unbelievable. And the Dems think he can win that way.
As the article notes: "If the court agrees, that could increase the likelihood that the results of the presidential race between President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden won’t be known for days after the election."
Come on, you gotta admit there is nothing exciting about Biden. And Camel Toe was so exciting she finished last in the primaries and one of the first to drop out.  The Democrats didn’t even like her 🤣🤣🤣
Yes I’m going to vote for Biden/Harris because I live in a swing state. Yes I think it’s incontrovertibly true that they have used their careers to make the world a worse place and they both deserve the wall. Yes I think voting for them makes me complicit in doing evil.
I can't...had to stop watching...nothing but lies, lies and more lies...I am so frustrated...I was so happy when Biden announced Harris....I hate this motherf*cking rollercoaster ride....😟😟😟
"The Election of 1800" for    &amp; other #NeverTrump /  folks  🎵 I have never agreed with [Democrats] once We have fought on like 75 different fronts But when all is said and all is done [Biden] has beliefs; [Trump] has none 🎵
It is about my rights! Joe Biden is a civilian, just like me. He's not a policy maker, just like me. Fear mongering &amp; stepping on my toes to move his agenda is 100% about my rights. I comply with wearing a mask inside if I am going to be within 6 feet of others but not outside!
get in the same boat with the rest of us, and let's row back to shore, because we are way out in the deep end with no captain. vote for Biden/Harris because at least they aren't criminals should be their 2020 campaign tag line.
You know they won’t. Only cover for cowering Biden the fool. The media is dead and it’s just all Yellow Journalism.
And you think Biden will open pandoras box in allowing previous presidents to be imprisoned???? Every living president deserves to be in jail, including president "my boss"...
So now Biden is anti-windows and anti-steak knives?
I actively voted for Sanders and contributed to his campaign. I’m passively voting for Biden.
I voted for Sanders in the primary. I’m not out here vote shaming anybody. I stated why I am choosing to vote for Biden because of the people in my family and community who are immigrants, low wage workers, and rely on social welfare. I don’t have your ideological purity
I agree. I also don’t like Biden or Harris. But I’ve never liked any presidential candidate I have voted for.
We so very much need to come together &amp; FIGHT tRump &amp; help people vote SO I HOPE WE ALL FOLLOW EACH OTHER OUT OF  SOLIDARITY TO HELP ELECT JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA HARRIS!
The spin machine will not accept that the left bashed President Trump for his brave decision to shut down travel &amp; months later agree it was a good decision. That would have been 2 more months of exposure if Hillary was at the helm and Joe Biden would not even be a consideration!
yep, saw a dude this morning arguing that “voting against the iraq war was seen as an act of treason” to justify why biden voted yes
Joe Biden was a WONDERFUL VP for President Obama! HE WILL BE A POTUS FOR ALL OF US! #BidenHarris2020
how’ve they been faring under biden and kamala?
The burden of proof lies with the one making the outlandish claim my dude. I don’t need to prove Biden is or isn’t anything. You do. And you can’t because all you have are made up conspiracy theories bred on message boards.
#Trump2020LandslideVictory  The exchange of embassies between Isreal and the UAE is a demonstration of Trumps negotiating ability.  For those that claim that he is beligerant Trump has a plan.  That plan required going against the established doctrine of BIDEN, OBAMA CLINTON.
I can't watch the news or news commentary (Fox News, MSNBC, CNN) without getting furious. I hate Trump and I hate Biden....there's no one to root for. That is a hollow, fucking, feeling. #Biden2020 #Trump2020, #BidenHarris2020, #TrumpPence2020---#NoMatterWhoWinsAmericaLoses
You think that voting for Biden will level the playing field? You’re just plain wrong
Have you watched Trump speak lately? And you think Biden is the one in cognitive decline? You may want to reevaluate why you believe what you believe. Do you believe it because of evidence, or just because Trump told you too. Trump has serious cognitive issues.
Vote for Biden.  Do you still want a country worth fighting for
Need to since Biden has no energy.
Harris selection could majorly boost Biden among Latino voters, polling firm says
If you regret voting for Trump, what have you got to lose if you vote for Biden.
It’s nuts, I think it’s underappreciate how much stuff like that matters to your overall look/brand. Biden already struggles with so much else you’d think he’d have his online presence buttoned down 😅
If you live in Massachusetts vote your conscience. But please vote for Ed Markey in the democratic primary.  (Still, for immigrants, unions, and the environment Biden is demonstrably better).
Not voting for Biden/Harris because they are “insufficiently liberal” when Donald Trump is the only other option is INSANE.
Vote Biden.  It is your best chance for the healing of America.
They aren’t in terms of views but if you are telling me right now that one party is better than the other and that trump is better than biden or vice versa then you’re wrong
I don’t like either party, I think both Trump and Biden are horrible candidates to represent the United States.

Vote Biden. Get the crazy out.
Pence went on to say that he would beat Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, shouting "I'm going to beat their ..." before being led offstage by a handmaiden.
People make it sound like protest and lower class frustration will just go away if Biden is in office. If he doesn’t give us what we want why would we stop? At least he’s not going to ghost an entire country like Trump.
And at least Biden has the decency to clarify and apologize for a comment that came out wrong. Your dude just double and triples down on his racism
Vote for Biden.
Trump can win this - don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise.
The ticket that matches me ideologically: Sanders- Warren.   The most powerful potential ticket against Trump: Warren- Buttigieg.  The ticket we got: Biden- Harris.   ...K.
Vote for Biden Harris
right 🤣 Biden is ahead of Trump 🤣
It's weird right? The world is trash right now and suddenly the bots (and Trump) are pretending Biden is the incumbent to blame it all on him.
The “suburban housewife” will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge! -Donald Trump
I don’t like mandatory voting bc I don’t agree it’ll produce results that better reflect the will of the people—ppl who don’t want to vote will just troll vote or vote thoughtlessly. It’s probably not the end of the world as long as I still have the option not to vote for a Biden
I will never forget that Obama/Biden left Otto Warmbier.
Too many of us are complacent when Dems are in power. If Biden gets elected, it’s our job to hold him accountable through direct action, public art, letter writing, calling, and actual activism (as opposed to snarky memes and twitter hashtags).

We are not voting our way out of this problem. Biden will fix NONE of this - do you honestly think voting magically gives you a smooth, legal transfer of power?  You ignored every stolen election, including in 2016. It was a coup. I said it out loud then, ya’ll called me crazy.
Where were you when our rights were stripped away by the Patriot Act? (Which Biden helped write)?   Where were you when the Obama admin orchestrated brutal police violence against Occupy?  Where were you when people were brutalized at Standing Rock for a pipeline that is leaking?
Truth. I haven't been excited about Biden since he announced his run.
The Ds were told in advance about covid too, and all they did was sell their stocks. Would Biden have handled this slightly better? Probably. Would we still have 60 million unemployed and 30 million homeless? Probably.

That’s the point. They tell us he’s a huge threat, only voting Dem will save America! While they clap sideways, tear paper, &amp; vote FOR his judges, budgets, surveillance powers, Space Force. Impeach ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. Why are they enabling the “worst threat ever!!”?
So on the short term, nothing. If we somehow win this election, do you think Biden, Pelosi, or Schumer are going to allow investigations and prosecutions, or is it going to be a 2009 “time to turn the page” redux?

I disagree,  With  Biden has chosen to NOT alienate many former  voters. Correct, his voting block is a lock, but he needs US to push him over the edge. A #Socialist would have blocked that.
Less so than Trump's collision course with history. As I alluded to, with Biden we at least have a fighting chance to survive. Trump and republicans are an unmitigated disaster. Vote strategically, think long term. Vote your values locally where they especially count.
Biden/Harris do not have a solution. Sanders/Warren/Castro are nursing the divide in Texas, hoping O'Rourke never becomes accepted as a national figure. This is what gerry mandering and urban enclaves do. They nuture extreme positions in both parties.
Show me where in the Biden/Harris policy they mention any of the things you’re listing? They’re not there.
Yep, that's weird to me too. But Dem/Rep is some not sort of mirror-opposite pair. We the People at least have a voice with Dems. Republicans serve *only* the wealthy with "trickle down" as their solution to everything. Next POTUS will be Biden or Trump. Choose strategically.
Also worth noting Biden/Harris aren’t Sanders/Warren
Biden has no idea what he is saying. If he’s not told what to say, he goes off on Grandpa Simpson-esque tirades that make no sense

He is the one that is scared. Trump is terrified about Biden winning, and I am sure his deals with Putin is a big part of it
And how is that different from you saying you don’t want to vote for Biden because of what some of his supporters say to you?
My point is this: You can go ahead and vote for Biden but the blood on your hands won't make you sleep any better. I'll fight anyone of you.

Stop shaming people who will vote for Biden/harris. I don't want to but I know they will bend to the will of the people because their history shows it. If you don't vote then you truly are giving up and allowing people to due needlessly.  these retweets are dense.
this is a Harris-Biden team, Not a Biden-Harris team #Hannity
Yeah ask Nancy she’s a Catholic and so is Biden!
But if you don't vote then you don't get the chance to have the protests and the movement matter. Trump will never budge or change anything. But Biden/harris will have to bend to the will of the people. If history shows anything its that they do bend when it comes down to it.
Biden should not agree to debate unless a fact chk is done about every statement
If Biden was still with it I imagine he’d be pretty pissed off at whoever is writing lie after lie on his Twitter.
If Harris gets elected then I wonder if they move Biden's basement to the White House fixing to be called the Black House or move the now called Black House to Biden's basement? Just asking. lol
The USCCB said that a staffer who told the bishops’ news service she was elated that Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate spoke in a personal capacity.  The conference did not address the substance of her remarks.
Joe Biden doesn’t deserve to be President! He’s a moose knuckled tater tosser!
Ya think they had a choice? 4 more years of a lunatic or Biden!
Biden is the biggest racist on earth. Harris is the biggest fake on earth. She now thinks she is black if that gets her in power.
well, he probably didn’t pick her. The DNC picked her and then told Biden that he picked her. He knows that he can’t remember anything, so he believed them and ran with it.
So in other words they are going to censure conservative videos if they say anything about 'Baffoon' Biden or 'Lot Lizard' Harris.
Again, hope I'm wrong, but mark my words-- Biden wont be any better. In fact he'll be just as bad. And if something happens to him and Kamala becomes president? I'd expect the same fash actions as trump's regime.  I really want to be wrong : /
And Biden is somehow even less progressive than Obama. And Kamala is a fucking cop. She would rather incarcerate innocent people to let them fight fires for free than let them live their lives freely. They arent agents of change. If I am wrong Ill GLADLY eat my words.
Like Im gonna vote for biden/harris but it doesnt matter in the end, theyre still gonna bomb foreign nations most of our country will never see or be aware of, kill our own people, and subvert progress for profit. Climate change will kill us before we get anywhere
We couldn’t even hold Obama accountable, and mf’s out here pretending like we’re going to somehow hold Joe Biden to a higher standard lmao
#Tucker it is not "the Biden-Harris team", it is "the Harris-Biden team"
people like "stop badmouthing kamala and biden, we need democrats even if its just baby step changes for the better!!" lmao bitches the world wont survive any more incremental change, this is beyond the time for dramatic and massive change or we will die as a species but ok mb
Have u all noticed a lot of ads for Biden and not one for Trump on this platform? Trump got Twittergated and we know it. Indictments are coming. I believe the report is complete and getting plenty of popcorn and lots of beers. lol
Y’all bout to go vote for Biden . Him and Kamala more racist than trump 🤦🏾‍♂️
The legislature would change that and they have a veto proof majority. This was discussed at length when Warren was being considered for VP. It will be a non issue if Biden wants her in his cabinet, as it would have had she been chosen.
Yes please. Let’s vote him out. Biden has members of Sunrise on his team at the very least.
Biden wasn’t the best pick given the field of candidates. But, he’s the only alternative to Trump.
I don’t support any of these people in any way whatsoever, but, umm, I’m pretty sure Lenin, Mao, etc would be laying the groundwork for a revolution, not endorsing Biden 😂😂
You are no more aware than Biden.
Like we’re prospering now? Get the fuck outta here!!  #Biden-Harris2020
I would crawl through a prison sewer like Andy Dufresne at Shawshank to vote for Biden/Harris
Not a Biden sign.
Well I’m not going to defend Biden. Why the democrats chose an old white guy is beyond me, but even with his weaknesses he’s still several times better than this incompetent President.
Yeah but I think we are getting better. I am a little weary of them cause if do win will want conservative policies but nice helping Biden win.
Kamala Harris probably won't be a loud voice advocating for legalization, but she can reassure Joe Biden about the California experience. It's gonna be okay, Joe. Legalization works.  by  #CannabisCulture #CannabisSociety #ColoradoCannabis
What does she care? She’s not running for office or is she? Maybe she has been offered a seat on the Biden Harris Cabinet of Undetected or Unpunishable Crime.
Uh that parody is joe Biden saying back during busing he didn’t want his kids going to a jungle school. Look it up dummy.
Do you still trust USPS with your ballot?  #copolitics #coleg #usps #Election2020
Progressives on MSM saying they're dedicated to their principles and goals and that supporting Biden/Harris isn't really giving in. Huh #NeverBidenHarris
Few steps forward followed by miles in reverse... 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Yet you’re voting for Biden simply because he’s a democrat... please
Doing nothing and a watching it happen is just as bad as doing it. Trump is bad, but Biden is right there neck for neck
Huh? What’s that even mean? You contantly teeet about Biden, so....?
Biden would have no response. No response is the same as a bad response. Biden was missing for like 6 weeks of his campaign and you somehow think that makes a promising presidency 🤔 seriously questioning your logic
If I were Biden I would hire this dude and spray paint “New World Order” on the front...
Oo we got vocab now! Literally everything on that little list you made Biden has said he will make no change to. I don’t get where you think he will do anything better. He has said numerous times he will change nothing
I always hope so, but does it actually?   And though I hate voting for the lesser of two evils, I’m afraid to not vote for Biden becuas trump has got to go!
Say one is better (between trump and Biden) than the other makes me question your ethics. They are the same. To sit there and ask me “what would you rather have - the same shit for 4 years in red or the same shit for 8 but in blue??” Of course I’ll pick the 4 years
Corporate news works for the same donors as the ones donating to Trump.  Corporate news might be happier w/ Trump, juicier stories. Biden will be boring at best.
Biden / Harris is the Fakest ticket I have ever seen. Totally propped up by media
No. But I have at least 2 close friends, not trumplicans, who are refusing to vote for Biden. It's...insane. And I've told both of them that. 🤷‍♀️
Isn't that Biden's argument?
To EVERYONE - if you want to keep your Post Office better vote Biden
I think you and I disagree on Trump and Biden and the legitimacy of Catholic's voting for one or the other. I do appreciate you fighting against racism. Come to Denver and let's grab a beer.
Yeah and some of his takes are pretty decent (only watched like 5 or 6 vids kuz they long). Today is him saying lenin would vote for biden was a special kind of silly 😜
Biden seems to have done fine. A distinguished congressional career spanning decades. Well respected VP, both in the United States and abroad. Presidential candidate. Soon to be president. And he’s a good and decent man. Yep - Joe’s done alright... #BidenHarris2020
Beau Biden did not have to go to Iraq. He was DE Atty Gen'l. Bob Mueller is a decorated Vietnam vet. If you vote for a coward, you might as well be one yourself.
Clearly messing with mail-in-ballots is the real issue, but I Trump is also sabotaging the mail to prevent by Biden Harris T-shirt from getting here promptly.
I hate Harris so much, I'll never vote for Biden.  This week I realized Trump can win again.  I see the stupid Obama-Clinton   running the same failed campaign as in 2016.   #NeverKamala
I know republicans don’t believe in polls, for good reason, but there are strong indications that it’s gonna be a landslide win for democrats. I’d rather be Biden in the lead by 11 than Trump down by that much. You can only pull off so many miracles when you don’t believe n Jesus
Everyone except me? I ALONE!!  I watched interview clip and an interview w/ Barnet. I think the “are you a junkie?” question was a continuation of his hypothetical. But, I like Biden. You have your preference. I have mine. The original post was on trump’s lies not Biden’s brain.
The Simpsons say VOTE FOR BIDEN
It was a solid press conference, now let’s have the Biden team answer some unscripted questions
The Dems were asking people to vote woke three times in a row, and since the economy wasn't tanking anymore, in 2016 the voters could react. This time a Biden/Harris vote is only about 1/3 woke. People can handle that.
Do you remember the Obama campaigns?   You could see vast support in places beyond Twitter.   I see it now, but not for Biden.   Biden and McCain signs are 1 in the same.
Ever seen a Biden yard sign?   Yea me neither.
Look at the little CNN, MSNBC puppets...no questions for Biden or the other one.
Nixon was more liberal than Obama, and president my boss was more liberal than biden...
Defeating trump and letting Biden become President for 8 years is an equal if not greater threat because it’s more long term. I don’t get what you’re not getting
It's temporary and who's wishlist is UBI on?   During primary the Democrats HATED the idea of UBI.  The liberal media literally ignored him, called him wrong name, showed pictures of random Asian guy claiming he was Yang.  If UBI was on wishlist Yang would be nom, not Biden.
I saw a Biden 2020 thin blue line sign today in someone’s front yard.  I almost crashed my truck
I'm envisioning the ad where Republicans (many formerly of this administration) endorse Joe Biden one by one - Rex Tillerson, John Kelly, James Mattis, Colin Powell.  Can we make that happen?
Biden is the most racist person on earth. BTW where is Hunter?
In CA, OR and CO, no matter how the people vote, those states will go to Biden.
President Trump  CREATED the biggest economic expansion in history. Lowest unemployment f/all in history.  Brought manufacturing back to the USA. Trade Deals! America First!  Obama/Biden=FAILURE. Economic disaster. Foreign policy disaster.  Harris &amp; Biden: Serial LIARS.
Huh? SS has spent over 400k annually on his golf trips. Him paying himself with GVMT $ negates the "not receiving pay"  I'm not voting Biden, I can't stand the current left politicians, but I'm also not a moron that falls for Trump's BS.   Keep being a blind follower, you do you.
Joe Biden is not fit to be president..he hides in the basement and all you idiot's speak for him. You are just using his name with the help of his wife..you should be ashamed of yourself. Talking about Bo...the one thing he has left to remember and you used it.
Biden and Harris our coming for our guns while calling for refunding the police. I'm out, Trump it is.
I'm being an adult and not voting for Biden.
How am I toxic for responding to your claim?   Also, I’m not a Bernie Bro, but a registered independent.   Like most independents, I don’t like the choices, but between Biden and Trump, the choice is obvious.
Would a dog wear pants like this? (Trump) Or like this? (Biden)
Yup and Harris will take over if elected and Palosi will be VP.Biden will probably announce his retirement on Jan. lol.
What it really sounds like is you are voting for Biden, and I don't like neoliberals!
Twitter/Social Media is always toxic, however the “Biden and/or Kamala isn’t who I wanted but we HAVE TO vote for them” and the “you can’t criticize them!! they’re our only hope!” is gross
Maxine Waters says Biden 'can't go home' without Black woman as VP - Business Insider
Babbling Biden and Kumalot will remove 100,000 a day.
Biden and Harris are all about confiscating guns and lobbing the softball term "mandatory buyback". So they don't want the police to protect us and they don't want us to protect ourselves. I'm Out, #Trump2020
Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
Biden was VP for eight years and has spent his life in Congress. He knows the countries. He had a press release yesterday naming them and the limitations of the deal Trump "negotiated."
Seriously Biden has to dial this back or Trump will crush him and idiot libs won’t understand why.
lol when did Biden say he would be one term lololol I swear
Perhaps why they’re having so much trouble framing Biden...not your typical “liberal elite”, so the canned attacks fall flat.
Biden and Harris actually know what their doing
#thanksobama and yes Joe Biden will be the fist President to rebuild a better economy for a second after being being VP when it was done the 1st time! All trump has done is ride on Obama's coattails and try to take credit for the things Obama has already done.. trump is a loser
It's not about beating Trump, it's about UHC, jobs, housing, and peace. Biden-Harris have nothing to do any of these. The party needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.

Of course, the odds right before the election more closely reflect polling average, where the odds now factor in three months of uncertainty. Bush in 2000 squandered a bigger August lead than Biden's.
But to point out the obvious. If he does not concede, his followers will stand behind him. Many of them have guns. Most, probably. They also make up the majority of LEOs, military, secret service, etc. It could take more than just "swearing in Biden" for transfer of the office.
even the vaccines not a cure dumbass 😂 so please put your plastic bag on your head and sit the fuck down 😂 yeah.. and you think Trump is going to be out of office in November? Biden had no chance even before he chose Kumswallah Harris as his running mate 😂 now it's a
“But Kamala is a cop and Biden votes for the Crime Bill.”
I do understand that.. maybe you’re not comprehending that I’m not a trump supporter nor am I supporter of Biden because I support the people that make this country run, not just rich people. I don’t know why you care so little
When will Biden answer questions?
Tweet saved for when Biden/Harris push your shit in
All I have is a high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way. Maybe the undereducated would be more likely to vote “left” if you assholes weren’t so goddamned condescending.
Venture way -- way -- behind the BFF bonhomie between #Biden and #Obama in this excellent  trip thru their complex friendship and the affiliated fault lines.  And yeah, Alex also gets big points for "BFF bonhomie"
I have high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way.
If the race does not start to tighten in the coming months, will the forecast start to favor Biden more? I’d like to hear Nate’s thought about that.
Awesome. 832 days till Biden's retirement party.
I love how Trump bashes Biden for not taking questions, yet Trump might take the question but not answer it.
Dude. You’re funny. Biden can barely function. Trump is the only one that can get it DONE
I would like to see a #Biden campaign ad that is just a compilation of  gutting Trump officials during hearings. #BidenHarris2020
Biden trying to take credit. Why?
Biden does not like Harris and Harris does not like Biden. It was obvious 3 days ago. He can't even operate his phone cause it was upside down. It is a disgrace and a sham show.
Trump gets tough questions from the media, Biden has not been asked one tough question yet. Biden tries to take credit for the mid east peace talks and how does that happen when he has been in the basement forever. Unbelievable. And the Dems think he can win that way.
As the article notes: "If the court agrees, that could increase the likelihood that the results of the presidential race between President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden won’t be known for days after the election."
Yes I’m going to vote for Biden/Harris because I live in a swing state. Yes I think it’s incontrovertibly true that they have used their careers to make the world a worse place and they both deserve the wall. Yes I think voting for them makes me complicit in doing evil.
I can't...had to stop watching...nothing but lies, lies and more lies...I am so frustrated...I was so happy when Biden announced Harris....I hate this motherf*cking rollercoaster ride....😟😟😟
"The Election of 1800" for    &amp; other #NeverTrump /  folks  🎵 I have never agreed with [Democrats] once We have fought on like 75 different fronts But when all is said and all is done [Biden] has beliefs; [Trump] has none 🎵
It is about my rights! Joe Biden is a civilian, just like me. He's not a policy maker, just like me. Fear mongering &amp; stepping on my toes to move his agenda is 100% about my rights. I comply with wearing a mask inside if I am going to be within 6 feet of others but not outside!
get in the same boat with the rest of us, and let's row back to shore, because we are way out in the deep end with no captain. vote for Biden/Harris because at least they aren't criminals should be their 2020 campaign tag line.
You know they won’t. Only cover for cowering Biden the fool. The media is dead and it’s just all Yellow Journalism.
And you think Biden will open pandoras box in allowing previous presidents to be imprisoned???? Every living president deserves to be in jail, including president "my boss"...
I actively voted for Sanders and contributed to his campaign. I’m passively voting for Biden.
I voted for Sanders in the primary. I’m not out here vote shaming anybody. I stated why I am choosing to vote for Biden because of the people in my family and community who are immigrants, low wage workers, and rely on social welfare. I don’t have your ideological purity
I agree. I also don’t like Biden or Harris. But I’ve never liked any presidential candidate I have voted for.
We so very much need to come together &amp; FIGHT tRump &amp; help people vote SO I HOPE WE ALL FOLLOW EACH OTHER OUT OF  SOLIDARITY TO HELP ELECT JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA HARRIS!
The spin machine will not accept that the left bashed President Trump for his brave decision to shut down travel &amp; months later agree it was a good decision. That would have been 2 more months of exposure if Hillary was at the helm and Joe Biden would not even be a consideration!
yep, saw a dude this morning arguing that “voting against the iraq war was seen as an act of treason” to justify why biden voted yes
Joe Biden was a WONDERFUL VP for President Obama! HE WILL BE A POTUS FOR ALL OF US! #BidenHarris2020
how’ve they been faring under biden and kamala?
The burden of proof lies with the one making the outlandish claim my dude. I don’t need to prove Biden is or isn’t anything. You do. And you can’t because all you have are made up conspiracy theories bred on message boards.
#Trump2020LandslideVictory  The exchange of embassies between Isreal and the UAE is a demonstration of Trumps negotiating ability.  For those that claim that he is beligerant Trump has a plan.  That plan required going against the established doctrine of BIDEN, OBAMA CLINTON.
I can't watch the news or news commentary (Fox News, MSNBC, CNN) without getting furious. I hate Trump and I hate Biden....there's no one to root for. That is a hollow, fucking, feeling. #Biden2020 #Trump2020, #BidenHarris2020, #TrumpPence2020---#NoMatterWhoWinsAmericaLoses
You think that voting for Biden will level the playing field? You’re just plain wrong
Have you watched Trump speak lately? And you think Biden is the one in cognitive decline? You may want to reevaluate why you believe what you believe. Do you believe it because of evidence, or just because Trump told you too. Trump has serious cognitive issues.
Vote for Biden.  Do you still want a country worth fighting for
Harris selection could majorly boost Biden among Latino voters, polling firm says
It’s nuts, I think it’s underappreciate how much stuff like that matters to your overall look/brand. Biden already struggles with so much else you’d think he’d have his online presence buttoned down 😅
If you live in Massachusetts vote your conscience. But please vote for Ed Markey in the democratic primary.  (Still, for immigrants, unions, and the environment Biden is demonstrably better).
Not voting for Biden/Harris because they are “insufficiently liberal” when Donald Trump is the only other option is INSANE.
Vote Biden.  It is your best chance for the healing of America.
They aren’t in terms of views but if you are telling me right now that one party is better than the other and that trump is better than biden or vice versa then you’re wrong
I don’t like either party, I think both Trump and Biden are horrible candidates to represent the United States.

Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report   Obama is cold on Biden, probably will vote for Trump!
Yeah, I’d define a major shift as going as far left as Bernie, (not that he’s far left). And i never wanted to convince you to enjoy or like Biden —I just don’t want some stupid kid like I was to see lefty shit and do dumb things by misunderstanding. Sorry, man.
These three months cannot be critical to your revolution, but they might be for Biden. Why ever risk that?
BIDEN was wrong?  you need to stop tweeting quotes from Trump that are only true if you switch Bidens name w/ Trumps! Doing that actually makes his quotes 100% true! Just not with Bidens name, but Trumps! Sad &amp; pathetic!
So b/c you're a "stable genius" you 100% KNOW that you're going to lose the election, BADLY! So, you think if you get destroyed by Biden/Harris you can claim fraud. Even then you're NOT GOING TO WIN, so just resign now &amp; stop making yourself look so stupid!
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report   Obama always had his problems with Biden but is playing the game of the Democrats and keeping his mouth shut!!
Biden is incapable of answering questions. He can't get through them without losing his temper and his handlers know it. If they could hide him in the basement until the election that's what they would do. He's simply incompetent.

Clearly he isn't in control since Biden can hurt him according to your president.
Good to know that you won’t remove me from the school when I wear my death to Biden shirt.
So are you voting for Biden or his supporters? Wait till you hear about Trump voters sneezing on people who wear masks.
Weird, looks like Biden hasn’t aged a day.
President Donald Trump's campaign is canvassing for voter support while former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign opts out.
It’s because they are hiding Biden and won’t let him speak. Once people realize there is none home they won’t be voting for him.
It must really suck to shit all over Biden and now be completely irrelevant. Young white males who claim to be Democrats carry the believe we should all be grateful the cool boys are on our team. My opinion of Obama has been tarnished. He seems disloyal and cruel.
I want to see the Biden/Rice one, because, as a non-graphic designer, I just see the shorter word "Rice" looking bigger than Biden which wouldn't work for a logo...how do designers incorporate that?
Stay focused on Joe Biden, he’s the weak link and the one that will slip. Also the one Republicans have to expose. Kamala is a waste of energy
Look, I’m voting Biden/Harris for sure, but if one more cis person says something about how they “don’t care about Kamala’s past, and I don’t want to hear about it” my chances of voting get slimmer. You can hear about this shit and still vote, but don’t block it out!!!
I am with you on the principle, but as far as I remember the "electorate" went solidly Biden in the primaries.
Vote for President Biden on Nov 3rd &amp; he'll bring back our beloved country, allies, reputation, WHO, Paris agreement, jobs, economy, &amp; show the world that we've regained our honor, &amp; the corruption left w/ Trump!

Biden needs to be able to recognize his own name before he can do anything for this country.
Well said Father.  And Joe Biden professes to be a catholic.
So tired of stupid comments. He has been answering questions almost every single day since Feb. If he walks off a few times because he's busy or disgusted with the hacks, it is not the same as Biden who can't hold a conversation that is not written down!
when people say joe biden is a socialist i just laugh knowing they have no knowledge of politics like OH HONEY
How could Biden/Harris be the most radical left representation when we literally have Sanders and Warren lol
Biden doesn't need his son to rely on like Trump needs you. He can pull his own weight. Biden has grown up.
You're not serious! The world thinks America is a joke, run by a sociopathic ignorant child! Trump alone has damaged our reputation, alienated allies, befriended dictators &amp; proven to world leaders that he has NO IDEA what he's doing! But Biden will hurt us? Um, NO WAY!
We can sit around and talk "what about ___" all day. But there is no perfect candidate who can serve every facet of social and political justice the way we'd like them to. So we have to start somewhere. Would you rather start with Biden/Harris?  3/?
Look, I'm not saying I agree 100% with Biden and Harris. They both have beliefs that I don't agree with. But think of the alternative. Sure, we can sit around all day and talk about "well why should we have to choose between the lesser of two evils" and believe me, I agree.  1/?
Biden/Harris ticket threw me for a spin. I wanted to defend the importance of voting the occupant out, but I’m seeing the flaws in that and my own participation in the brainwashing rhetoric of white progressive politics. Taking a step back to be a better listener now.
She then fits in perfectly with Joe Biden. He’s a weak man that changes his opinions with the political wind. He’s got a different position everyday and the people handle his public appearance very closely

She's garbage dude. So she believes the women accusing Biden, AND she believes Biden is a racist, yet she still runs with him as his VP? So it's cool to ignore the fact he's a racist, and sexual predator, as long as you get to be VP? That's crooked as hell dude
Hmmm... Biden literally called Trump a few months ago and told him what to do. Oh and he and Obama left him a book telling him what to do
this is exactly the kind of flip-flopping trump is going to pounce on as we get closer to the election - he'll claim that he cares more about black lives than the dem nominees. biden and harris have awful records, and suddenly trying to pretend they don't is a total joke/mistake.
NOT a concerned about being thrown in jail.  You know, the same can't be said about you! Your father &amp; Pence are so SCREWED! I mean they can't spell the 5 letter words Biden &amp; Kamala use regularly. Brains vs ignorance. Its going to be a massacre that you can't not watch!

Ewww. That's a bad take considering what Biden said about choosing a VP. That's no conservative's fault.
Kamala Harris accepting the official Vice President choice from Joe Biden
Just want until Democrats pull out there Donald Trump, Joe Biden is one step closer to that
Not the choice I wanted to make, but not a difficult one either. One thing he doesn’t list is environmental issues. While Biden and Harris could be better in that regard, they will be light years ahead of where we are now.

She’s as good as Biden at offending her constituents
Biden 2020  Where you are actually voting Harris for president.
You are a racist, misogynistic, and weak man. This white suburban woman is voting for Biden/Harris, and I will do everything I can to insure you lose in a record landslide. #BidenHarris2020 #DefeatTrump
Biden knows the 1918 pandemic didn't end WWII so there's that....
Kamala Harris will not help Biden in Colorado
I still wonder how Democrats chose Biden. Wasn't Elizabeth Warren the best choice...? Even Bernie could have better choice.
Is it? I’ll have to pull the original and reupload at a higher resolution. If O can post a picture of myself with the helmet, jacket, and rope will you donate $20 to Biden’s campaign?
breaking news. joe biden has dropped out of the race and is now backing cole preston for the 2020 presidential election
I hope and pray it’s Biden!! We can’t handle/survive another 4 years of Trump in office...
That's how unenthusiastic people are about biden
And people think Trump is racist 😂 funny how the black community is actually doing better under him than Obama 🤔 even if Biden wasn't blatantly racist, he can barely form a rational sentence!
They’re all bad. The Biden Ticket is competent and less bad. Failed country but lets vote for the less worse ticket.
Facts, I'm happy for a potential women president/vp but I'm not happy its Joe Biden &amp; Kamla.
I don’t think anyone’s perfect, not Biden, Kamala, Trump, not me or you. But I do think people can change &amp; grow and people can be held accountable. I’m not voting for a perfect President and VP, I’m voting for people who learn from their mistakes and listen. #BidenHarris2020
Are you saying the Obama-Biden ticket did have a Catholic on it (2008 &amp; 2012), but the Biden-Harris ticket does not?
MSNBC accused of 'cropping' Biden's script from photo of his virtual chat with Harris   MSDNC
Lincoln Project likes Harris: “a steadfast defender of justice and human rights...a deserved reputation for opposing the reprehensible actions the current administration has engaged in against both our own citizens and our allies. ..a powerful asset to the Biden campaign.”
We have enough cops already. We don't need one as VP. It is the absolute most tone-deaf pick that Biden could have made.
Let's be real. Biden could have picked a pack of cigarettes for VP and he still gets my vote over Trump.
It must be a bittersweet day for Joe Biden. I know he's wishing Kamala was Beau's VP pick.
It’s not bad he supported Harris. He just has to admit it. We will all be donating to her/Biden’s campaign. Finally something I will do that DJT has done! What a great example. Trump isn’t so bad after all 😀
People that are like fuck Trump fuck Biden. Please tell, who do you vote for ??? Like whose left ????
Y’all resentment for Biden gonna indirectly make Trump win again just like Hillary 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️.
In the debates Kamala demonstrated her willingness to speak truth to power. I'm confident she will speak her mind to President Biden. That brings me comfort.
I don't think leftists are rallying behind Biden/Harris. The Democratic party probably has a better chance pulling from centrist republicans who regret voting for Trump in '16.
Will said what he thought he heard was that Biden picked Camille Herron to be his running mate, which he found interesting but odd.
Why is Biden a travesty of a candidate?
Ima just go out on a limb and say Kamala Harris wasn’t Biden’s best choice...
Bring on the tshirts! Proud nasty woman for Biden/Harris!!
The people that are pissed that Biden chose Harris are the ones that already made it crystal clear that it wouldn’t matter who he picked, they weren’t voting for him.
So you had no intent of ever voting for Biden?
Due to college football twitter I wouldn’t have even known Biden picked his VP candidate 😂 but I finally figured out who it was and I am ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED. Not...
The fact that your ad calls Biden racist &amp; tries to attack Harris as phony is comical! The ONLY PHONY RACIST that's ever been in our govt is DONALD TRUMP! Racist w/out question, &amp; phony Republican b/c he's a NO ONE, a criminal conman who's failed at politics like everything else!
I LOVE Susan Rice also but can SEE HER as Secretary of State or UN Ambassador too...HER foriengn Policy Knowledge is HER strong suit &amp; HER past working relationship with BIDEN would make for a TRUSTED TEAM‼️💁🏼‍♀️
Kamala Harris is Biden’s VP pick. Never mind that Tulsi executed her on live tv, and she has many more skeletons left to drag out of the closet.  If you needed to check all of the diversity boxes, why not choose Michelle Obama? At least your base kinda likes her.
BREAKING: Joe Biden announces VP pick  via
Ask yourself this. Do you know anyone that wasn't going to vote for Biden already, that now is?
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.
Biden made a great choice for his running mate, and in the process, chose our next great president once his term is finished. 🇺🇸
I support Biden/Harris. #VoteBlue2020
not gonna lie, I did get a text from the Biden campaign first at 30330 sharing the VP selection of Harris #BidenHarris2020
Does Biden know yet?

Ac­cord­ing to #Biden tax re­turns 2017-2018 they avoided pay­roll taxes on $13 mil­lion in in­come from book roy­alties &amp; speak­ing fees. They did so by clas­si­fy­ing the in­come as S-corporation profits rather than tax­able wages ~
Yeah hopefully, I think sort of damage done and if they add him the narrative is that they reluctantly did it because of a twitter backlash.  Maybe that will keep some people in the fold though. I'm for whatever gets the most people in for Biden, so whatever the best play is.
We’re voting for Biden and here is why. 1/#RidinWithBiden2020
After all the polls showing his supporters the hardest to covert to a different candidate, I don’t get it but just gonna have to work even harder to get Biden in.  That’s still the only goal for this year. We’ll revisit this in a few years.
Biden may misspeak from time to time but he can speak. Trump uses words like "covfefe &amp; bigly" my favorite is "strongly" He's said on more than one occasion that "he will look into that very strongly". How exactly do you look into something strongly?
Yeah, a Biden win is priced in, but we may also be nearing the end of building a house of cards when people frantically add top layers to get it as high as possible before the collapse.
I think they totally should. Would excite Poole more and take the focus off the Presidency itself being the most important thing voters should consider. Who would be in your Biden cabinet?
Everyone is joining the Biden campaign! The Republican party is doomed.
Why is it so hard for you to describe what you're talking about?  "Big stock market numbers" could mean anything! HUGE STOCK MARKET NUMBERS (6 years ago when Obama was President) or BIG STOCK MARKET NUMBERS (will return after President Biden is elected) You're a joke! A BAD JOKE!
I'm smart enough to realize a con when I see one, &amp; b/c the interference in our election meant to vilify Joe Biden &amp; claim Trump is a leader who will help America is not only patently false, but pathetically obvious! We ALL have learned a lesson about sociopathy in Trump!
Thank you joe Biden.  Protect Bristol bay!  Everyone needs to vote

Oh lordy. If Biden had said this, Trump's failsons would already be on Twitter talking about assisted living and memory care options.
I will vote for Biden no matter who the veep is. I was a Warren supporter in the primaries, but now believe that Harris fits the mood of the times better. I want him to just announce already so good non-chosen people don’t keep being beaten up for no good reason.
We'll have to agree to disagree. Joe Biden is in control of his mental facilities in a way Donald Trump has never been. Trump is the corrupt, conman criminal who's spent decades committing crimes b/c he thinks his wealth entitles him to. Plus no one honest is sued 3500 times!
I can't wait for you to be the Senate minority leader, &amp; President Biden deciding that b/c the GOP is inept he'll just sign an EO to do what he wants! I can't wait to hear you argue why Biden can't do things that you've allowed Trump to do.
Russia is once again interfering with our upcoming election and you're focused on Hunter Biden?  Really?  Do your f job you suckup!

Maybe this is true, maybe not. But either way President Biden wouldn't ever claim that this will be paid for by another country. Why would another country pay for Bidens proposals? They wouldn't, just like Mexico didn't pay for Trumps wall!

I find it amusing and alarming Pelosi is pushing China support for Biden after they murdered so many worldwide. Disgusting!
Who was that?  Because if the answer is Bernie then my reply to you is his people didn't turn out to vote during the primaries.I didn't get my candidate either &amp; I'm voting for Biden because he IS the candidate. Anyone who doesn't bother to vote or votes 3rd party votes for Trump
Anyone wasting time attscking Chuck Todd instead of Trump, Barr, McConnell, Jim Jordan, Lindsey Graham, Mnuchin, Meadows or any other corrupt person working for Trump is WASTING THEIR TIME! We must stick together for Biden! FULLSTOP!
Vote for Joe Biden
Especially looking forward to the fact checks that rate it as "True" or use it to claim a "Promise Broken" when Biden says he won't raise middle-class taxes.

President Biden will enjoy the Trump precedent of making tax policy without approval from Congress, forgiving student loan debt completely without Congress, and doling out federal money to states, without your vote.

another day of shit re: biden
so, like... does biden even *want* me to vote for him? at best, a day goes by in which he does nothing to convince me to. at worst, he does shit to convince me i shouldn’t.
Why should Biden debate a jerk?
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, lauds community's 'diversity of thought'    It took him a full day to do a 180!!!
Leave it to CNN to spin this narrative.  I can't wait for the debates.  I could see them wanting to fight each other on stage.  Let's get ready to rumble!  Trump in round 2!  CNN's John King appears to defend Biden over former VP's 'diversity' remarks
I thought he said Biden hurt God?  I assume most Christians KNOW that anyone who is a believer in the almighty also knows that God is incapable of being hurt. Gotta be a neophyte or total infidel to make that pronouncement.
Joe Biden said black people don’t have a diversity of opinions or “attitudes, with some notable exceptions,” but Latino’s do... reminds me of the racist Smithsonian chart they released about the aspects of “Whiteness and White Culture” a few weeks ago
How about Obama giving a Biden rally at another man's funeral
Apparently Biden said something bad but I can’t find it because of all the asinine things Trump keeps saying about Biden steal up all the search terms. If Biden manages to pull this out, this will be a big reason why.
Beat Biden, we can't let America sleep!
If Biden can hurt God, there's no telling what he can do to us mere mortals.
Biden says Black people can’t think for themselves
Joe Biden lays down the law!!
Get Biden out of the basement so he can tell us what he really thinks
Joe Biden tells us what he truly believes. He thinks the black community is all the same!!
Biden snaps at question on cognitive test, likens it to asking reporter if he’s ‘a junkie’   Thou protest too much Joe Biden

If Biden is powerful enough to hurt God, he must then be able to eradicate COVID-19; put the unemployed back to work and get elected in November.
What's next? Biden will ban apple pie! Biden is BFF with Satan! Biden will divorce all straight couples! Biden will ban rock music! Biden will force all dog owners to own cats and all cat owners to own dogs! 🤪
Really jaw dropping is if those closest to him have not encouraged him to have cognitive function test. DNC intentionally guilty of elder abuse. Don’t like Biden’s politics, but this is painful to watch seeing him deteriorateevery day. He’s always said dumb stuff. This is more...
It’s not Pres Trump saying it. Biden is under investigation by Ukraine right now. Biden is named and quoted in fbi documents as participating in the unmasking and fake investigation of Gen Flynn and the Trump campaign. That’s just a couple of the things.
every day on here i see a new video of joe biden being profoundly creepy or racist
You are seriously bringing up Biden's inability to read prepared material? You need to be careful when you say things like this given the endless recordings of Trump stumbling over words, going off the cuff in the most disastrous ways &amp;/or reading everything in a stoned monotone.
It's wildly telling when all a Trump supporter has in his arsenal is Joe Biden whataboutism. If you can't genuinely defend the actual man &amp; his actions &amp; can only turn to casting untrue aspersions on his opponent, what does that reveal about your candidate &amp; your support of him?My names joe biden and...c'mon man. I thought you liked me. #MyCampaignSlogan
Want me to spell it out? I'm MtF, autistic and with an encroaching physical disability in my spine. If you accelerationists keep Biden out, I die either in the streets or in a prison camp.

Dude over here tweaking about this. Typical. Vote Biden 2020
Staying home is better than voting for Trump. Personally, I'm voting Biden to get back to some sense of normalcy and following the rule of law.
Either vote for Biden/Harris or STFU and leave!
How could this possible be a conflict of interest?  Wink! Wink! look over here there is nothing wrong with #MailInVoting #MailInBallotFraud
Biden who?
They would be asked policy questions and have to explain their current socialist agenda. Biden is currently leading in the polls, why upset the Apple cart.
So now it’s Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, everyone knows Biden is just a vessel for the far left.
Hannity will be whining this guys name like Uranium One. All through the Biden administration. Unlike with trumps friends, he will likely face punishment, and serve his time if convicted.
Trump supporters tell me a third party vote helps Biden. So, which is it?
Fair enough. But it isn't Trump supporters who made it mandatory Biden choose a "black woman." The birther thing is nonsense. Incidentally, we are all fed. Aren't we? We can choose the restaurant. You choose CNN, NYT, WAPO, MSNBC etc. I choose FOX, WATI, conservative talk radio.

Disgraceful act by the Democrat inspired domestic terrorists. This is the America that the Biden/Harris team want for all Americans. Vote Trump/Pence and Republican in November. Restore law and order and save our constitutional democracy.
Do laws really matter to any of you liberal-minded people I don't think you care about the truth which was proven by Obama and his administration and you are going to do it again with Biden and Harris
So, here we are. Congress is in recess and Trump is actively sabotaging the USPS and spreading lies about Biden and Harris. How do “we” prevent him from stealing the election? Is this not a clear and present danger?
Commissar Biden’s latest dictate is outrageous and not based on research. It’s totally political and a foretells what he and Harris would do as POTUS and VP. Vote Trump and Republican in November. Save our constitutional democracy. MAGA
Biden has been in public office for 48 years, he should have a message and gave taken questions.
Biden and Harris want to lower your taxes, let you keep your health plan, and send your utility bills through the ground.   That’s  for the people.  It’s for everyone.
Biden/Harris is the least progressive ticket I’ve ever seen. They might as well be republicans.
Campaign funds will pay it off, kinda like the funds used to pay the $465,000 that Hunter Biden owed in back taxes last week.

I keep hearing how Biden is so great at getting, processing, and making decisions based the advice of experts. This ridiculously lacking expression of current priorities leaves me with zero confidence in his abilities in that regard.
How can this be the culmination of Biden's effort to express pandemic policy improvements based on expert advice??!!!  This statement isn't slightly accurate based on the science.   #expertbiden #biden2020 #bidenscience #masksoutside #Unity2020 #anotheroption2020 #2020otheroption

Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris both said that they are going to rase income tax fees, confiscate our Guns and further rule us under the table.  They are lying to America now and it will get worse latter on.  Please think before filling in the box or pulling the handle.
nobody (on the left) is arguing that biden's handling of the protests will be good but what we do know is that obama never deployed secret gestapo vans to sporadically kidnap people off the streets and we can be cautiously optimistic that biden also won't do this

Biden is maybe the worst candidate for President ever presented to the public. And let's remember, he still hasn't former accepted nor been formerly named as the Presidential nominee. I still think the old switcheroo could be in play. Regardless, Joe's not looking good...

Good 4 Biden
So Biden and Harris have both repeatedly lied since they were introduced yesterday, if they keep it up they should be asked the same question.
the pandemic response under biden is just going to be him shouting "take the vaccine, dummy!" without providing any aid to communities that will inevitably be unable to afford the vaccine🙃
So proud of President Biden and his outstanding leadership!
Biden, to Americans: “It’s not about your rights.”
Now that Harris has been named to run with Biden, have they decided who will lead the ticket?
Ok I’m all for masks and everything, but honestly, how am I supposed to get Coronavirus outside? Think about it, and then have Joe Biden explain it to me, if he can! #stopcrazyunclejoe
Will you and Joe Biden embrace the science of prenatal life?
Trump ramps up sexist rhetoric against political rivals  trump has no shame. So I am not  ashamed of voting for Biden. Maybe we can get our country back in order after this disaster of an administration. America deserves better.
Quite the talk you gave this morning   So, if I heard you correctly, as a woman, I'm more empathetic and will be voting for Biden.  BUT, if I were a man, I'd be voting for Trump because 'men just want to get things done' with Trump.  Quite insulting.
You’re absolutely right about that. Biden and Harris will kick you and Pencey out of office in November!
Biden getting ahead of the game with the pandemic. Not even in office yet he is ahead of trump already with the virus. What a stark contrast in briefings.
That didn't take long, just over 24 hours since #Biden announces #Kamala as running mate and dominating the news cycle #Trump drops the hammer and announces major foreign policy win in the #MiddleEast, the #abrahampeaceaccord. What a way to change the narrative of the #newscycle.
If they get there with the electoral college then that’s how the system works. You absolutely can not compare voter fraud to Trump settling on some case. That’s nonsense. Biden is up to his eyeballs in fraud with his family. Thus is about the high potential for voter fraud.
I think this ad makes Biden look even better. He’s actually working for the American people. You’re probably on the train with Stormy Daniels while America dies from COVID.
Biden/Harris might be the worst ticket in like...... ever.
Now do Biden mispronouncing her name several times yesterday, including when he introduced her, does it not matter because he’s an old guy with Dementia or because he’s a Democrat?
They were talking about an article by CNN that literally said Biden might be replaced by Harris at the top of the ticket. Gutfeld had the article with him, reading from it.
Biden mispronounced her name three times yesterday, if your own running mate can’t pronounce it correctly it really shouldn’t matter.
So I guess that makes Biden a sexist since he totally mispronounced her name when he introduced her. 🤡🤡 Has Don Lemon’s sexual harassment suit been resolved yet?
It was just too funny hearing CNN try to demean Tucker Carlson for mispronouncing Kamala‘s name. They reamed him in the very next day Joe Biden said at the exact same way.
He actually believes HE did this which is scary,  He took over from the Obama/Biden administration and just like everything he touches is turned to shit making us the biggest shithole country there is.
Look, Biden has already addressed his issues with inappropriate touching, so let's not start in with the whole "thigh land" thing again...  Yes, he didn't apologize or DO anything remotely like ACTUALLY addressing it, but... I mean, there were fragments of... he didn't...  *sigh*
buddy really took biden quotes and used them against trump😳😳 shiii he got him
This is what a Biden administration will bring to the country.
Need I even bring up that Trump supporters are more likely than Biden or Bernie supporters to have dropped out of highschool or not have a college degree??? No?? Ok😌
If we settle for Biden and get justice for the POC lives lost to police brutality - get this - the riots would end😃
Why Sarah Palin Is Trending Ahead of Biden's VP Pick Announcement

The CCP is backing Biden.
Your solution to Biden's VP problem would have been Tulsi. Literally the only area where her thoughts vary from Trump's is that she'd nationalise every business with more than 35 employees. Her foreign policy would, if anything, be MORE isolationist.

Biden lays a trap for Trump by picking Harris
prior to having kamala as biden’s vp pick, i was still apprehensive about biden. now, i will actually be excited to vote #bidenharris this november.
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim this is going to be a rigged election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
Do you think Pence believes?  I can't understand how Republicans can attack Joe Biden's character with a straight face.  It is startling.
Bro, all I'm saying is that Biden's team realized why no one has assassinated Trump (because then Pence would become pres, and that could be more dangerous) and went "Joe, we have just the human shield - I mean running mate - for you!"
Joe Biden butchered her name tonight, way worse than Tucker did. 🤡🤡
So "Judge" Jeanine Pirro, what is going to happen to Biden? You must have pulled out a crystal ball from your briefcase.
LIVE INTERVIEW TONIGHT W/ TOPHER TOWN MUSIC! Why Kamala Harris Will NOT Drive Black Voters To The Polls
Trump showing off now he'll let ppl run the train for him while Biden doing hard manual labor. The difference between a bit and a man. Biden is the leader. He don't need nobody else running his train to get where he's going!
Women accused Trump. Over 20 of them, one with evidence, one who was 13.  A woman accused Biden. A woman who turned out to be an actual real life liar for hire.  Try another tack.
Wouldn't it be the secret service job,  once Biden gives them the okay
Are going to teach Biden how to say it correctly? He butchered her name way worse than Tucker Carlson.
“Nothing will fundamentally change” under a biden presidency either.
He absolutely is evil though. Not as evil as Trump, but Joe Biden is not your friend.
lol the dnc is fucking stupid fuck biden/harris
I’m no economist...and neither is Trump.  It’s like he’s trying to sell us a timeshare...every fucking day!  Biden/Harris!  Can’t wait!
I’ve got my own family from Texas in dms spreading QAnon stuff and saying Biden is part of a socialist conspiracy so there’s some work to be done before we can start having a reasonable conservation about progressive policies 😂
4yrs + 8yrs = Biden + Harris = 12 yrs BLUE!!!
I couldn't be happier that  is Biden's VP running mate.  The fact that she is from my home state of California makes it even sweeter that she's going to be on the ballot this November.  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020  #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica  #BlueWaveTsunami2020
Except that Joe Biden is the point at which they abandoned pretending to be interested in incrementing and just said “fuck the pleebs, they’ll do what they’re told.”

No thanks. I want to see Trump and Biden rumble.
These speeches gave me, a nasty suburban housewife, hope that this country can come back from the brink of ruin caused by trump. Biden and Harris are smart and empathetic and can speak in full sentences. They understand democracy. #BidenHarris
Everyone needs to report Jeanine Piro for threatening Joe Biden. This woman is psycho and dangerous!
Hoping Mary Trump does a virtual rally for Biden / Harris🤣🤣🤣
Go after Biden  Ignore his attack VP.
You sound scared.  That is not what was said and your interpretation is very flawed. What are you going to do once he's ousted?  You are truly sucking up to the wrong person,  your sight should be on Joe Biden now.
Hey a$$hole, this is my taxpayer money, it’s not a gift from you! Can’t wait for the big Biden/Harris win in November!
Biden just mispronounced her name, lol

I live in the suburbs and will be voting Biden / Harris
Biden is on record in PA saying he won’t ban fracking and if that’s your sole issue don’t vote for him.  I think the moderate Dems want fracking to end, but get it can’t happen overnight without putting people in the poor house.
Uhh…I don't recall JOE BIDEN being in office during #Ukraingate   I always thought it was DONALD TRUMP who made that phone call that lead to the #ImpeachmentHearings   I guess THE INTERNET must be fake news too (In which you might want to get off. You might've been exposed to…
Joe Biden was introduced to Harris by his son Hunter what does that tell you 😳
Ah, you’re right! Must’ve missed that part.
Probably not unemployed. I'd put money on it she won't give up her Senate seat unless Biden wins.
Actually it's pretty crowded, Kamala, Biden, Hillary, Obama, etc.
yes Kamala has a shit ton of donors.... and y’all think Biden picked her for any other reason?😂
They don’t mind Trump’s ethics at all. Biden makes them liars and hypocrites on every single point they’ve criticized Trump on.  They object to the aesthetics of Covfve. The bits where they talk about ethics are pretexts that disguise that.
The Steffan Tubbs Show is at News/Talk 710KNUS. Aurora ·  After careful debate (none) we've decided it'll be known as the "Harris/Biden" ticket on the program..
Voting for Biden and stumping for him on Twitter *is* being a Biden Bro. That bit where you’re saying “Oh, but in my HEART I’m doing this WITH RESERVATIONS”?  Doesn’t matter, because it has no effect on the wotld around you. It’s just a way to blame your own cowardice on others.
I follow   and  here on Twitter.  I find it curious that Biden is always in my timeline at the very top and Trump is never in my timeline.
Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election | Fox Business
A Stepford Wife- in trump’s little mind that’s what he expects women to be, robots that have no free will &amp; obey their husband’s. The other strong women are ‘nasty’ in his mind, a word he uses often. Senator Harris is a strong woman &amp; great for Biden’s presidential ticket‼️
First thing I did this morning, make this poster.  Did I mention that I LOVE that Biden picked Harris!!  #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
You’re absolutely pathetic‼️Kamala Harris is a huge boost to Biden’s presidential race! Have you read the Twitter responses on here?! Most don’t support you, or trump for that matter.
Truth in advertising request... would like Kamala Harris to take same test Liz Warren took to determine the extent of Black African heritage in her makeup. If Dems want millions to vote for her &amp; Biden based on "identity" then let's be sure she IS black. Only fair.
I oppose fracking as well. So, good news! Thanks for making sure that I vote against you, while voting for Biden/Kamala.
I wonder how it feels to be selected only because of your gender and color of your skin...Biden riding with the times.
You and Pence are quaking in your boots. Biden/Harris is heading for the White House. Get out!
Definitely possible. The other explanation is that Tobin feels that Biden shouldn't just BE excommunicated (likely for being pro-choice), but actually already IS.
Woot woot!!! So excited for this Biden/ Harris ticket. #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP #RidinWithBiden
There haven’t been “suburban housewives” since 1956. Women from the suburbs are going to vote for Joe Biden in record numbers. We know and appreciate diversity in our neighborhoods.
They're still convinced that Biden will forestall armed revolution while the thought of Trump running the country for at least four more years will force it before 20 Jan. They don't take into account the Trumpstapo can ALREADY stymie all armed revolution, just like in Germany.
I will remind you again that I am a woman who lives in the suburbs and I am voting for Biden /Harris. I welcome affordable housing. #BidenHarris2020
The comical thing is that they are running with the attack that Biden and Harris are “far left liberals” (which is how they would have attacked any ticket).  If they truly think Biden is “far left” (which they don’t...just scare tactics) - whooo boy.
You seem a little worried today, Donnie.  #nastywoman  #wednesdaymorning  #nastywoman  #Biden
Joe Biden that’s who!
Val, You have demonstrated that you are one of the elite young leaders in the Democratic Party. Joe Biden was fortunate to be able to include you on his short list of VP candidates. Please keep up the wonderful work you are doing on behalf of your constituents and all Americans!
Joe Biden is “radical”?!?!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
That Wall Street is excited about Kamala Harris - taking it as a sign that a Biden presidency would not be progressive - should tell you a lot.
And yet he endorses a candidate who’s made waves standing directly against precisely this. Joe Biden sees Obamacare in the way that American racists see statues of Confederate generals: as a transcendental symbol that must be preserved at any cost at all.
I asked for this ticket the day Biden locked up the nomination!
I mean, the whole point of a Biden campaign is to ignore all of the facts about his history while pretending at the same time that the Dems weren’t deeply contemptuous of Republicans saying precisely this about Trump on 2016.
And Obama isn't Catholic (so Biden filled that role in 2008 and 2012 by his own logic) so this clown Bishop Tobin has no clue what he's babbling about.
What happened to you?  Are you in the same stage of dementia as Biden?
Kamala Harris Is Biden's VP Pick -- Here's What It Means For The Election And Beyond
But hey, way to once again avoid saying anything positive at all about Biden.   I mean, since there’s literally nothing good to say about him, you go straight for sneering at what you think my “real motivations are.”  True to form for Biden Bros: go straight gor the ad hominem.
Dude.   Joe Biden already is a victory for the right. He hands them everything they’ve wanted for fifty years.   That belief you have that he’s substantively different from Trump in literally any way at all? That’s an article of religious faith totally undupported by evidence.
Did Governor of Georgia, Stacy Abram, accept nomination for Biden’s VP?
Has anyone on Biden's team sniffed Kamala hair?
Biden’s text came through as I was in my car, getting ready to walk into a job site. I had to stay in my car to compose myself before walking in because I was sobbing. Then I had to measure the kitchen 3x because I couldn’t focus. I forgot what it was like to cry tears of joy. 💛
It’s time to get some sleep, and I’ll be sleeping much better when Biden/Harris are winning!  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
I think the wording was intended and factual. Anyone with a functional brain knows Biden is unfit to serve as President, even those in news media.
Guess my follow-up question would be...if not Biden/Harris, who? Because my honest feeling is that we can’t survive another 4 years of *this*...
We Proudly Support Joe Biden.Joe Biden is for improvement. Improvement for ALL Americans.
Ms. McEnany: Consider contrasting Biden/Harris Qs from Cavenough 2019/1991 Thomas hearings with Trump/Pence stand for "innocent until proven guilty." Then ask (voters) "Is this the future Justice system you want?" PClose w/list of 1st T. wins-prison reform, SCOTUS, etc.
What is the number of women that accused Biden of sexual misconduct and how many BJs did she give to win the VP nomination?
Welp, no surprise on the Biden front today. The entirety of his policy positions for fifty years has been MORE COPS.
Biden sniffed.....sorry,  I meant picked, Harris for Running Mate.  Excuse the expression.
I swear to god Joe Biden is gonna drop dead from being a wrinkly old fuck within 3 months of being inaugurated, and then we'll be stuck with the cop nobody wanted to begin with
Wouldn't it be amazing if she were recognized for her achievements in life rather than the things she had no choice over? The headline should read something like, "Kamala Harris, Senator and Former AG nominated to VP for Biden" Instead her race and gender get top billing.

I bought a T-shirt on the Biden victory page
I was with Rice but the announcement of Harris feels really good today and I’m excited for this Biden/Harris ticket. This is Joe Bidens choice and I support it.
Pretty sure that’s what you said about Obama and Biden. Amazing thing - there’s still a second amendment!

The only way Joe Biden will endorse  a new vaccine is if Anthony Fauci, the CDC, and the FDA first approve it for general use against COVID-19 based on the outcomes of repeated, accepted double-blind clinical trials. Given those parameters, I would absolutely trust the vaccine.
Look at this news article from The Daily Caller: ’She Was My Number One Draft Pick’ — Trump Launches Immediate Attacks On Kamala Harris After Biden Names Her As VP

There is a sweet spot in the Biden cabinet for  😀
Turn off angry, sensationalized cable news and get your election coverage at The Neutral (⁦⁦ No fatigue, bickering, or bias. Just facts and balanced perspective. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Val, we look forward to your place in Biden’s administration, also!
He has the vocabulary of a 5th grade bully. Hope the Dems just let him continue the downward slide while the high road is open for Biden and Harris. The difference between the candidates could not be more evident. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue
When Biden wins and his acceptance speech, right before he's done, would it not be amazing for him to say "you're fired"? How sweet would that be!
So? She is? She attacked Biden on segregation and race, she was just a raving lunatic when she went after Kavanaugh. Not sure what your point is? Just because she’s a woman she can’t be criticized?
Yep lol Biden picked a cop and drug warrior as his VP when feelings on the police are at an all time low.
Where can I get a Biden/Harris sign in the Denver area?
Day two, Biden appoints Harris anti-corruption tsar.

NRDC Action Fund: Biden Picks Proven Leader and Seasoned Fighter in Harris
I like Bernie &amp; would have voted for him. I meant nothing derogatory against anyone. The fact is I'm well aware we NEED  Bernie's supporters. It's just so many are refusing to vote for Biden, so i thought maybe if they listen to him speak at the DNC we could change their minds.
You should be ashamed if you vote the Biden/Harris ticket.
I think she is a perfect pick for Biden and she will knock it out of the park!!
Trump sure sounded scared! He knows Pence isn’t comparable to Harris at all! And Trump knows that Biden knows more about the US government &amp; US Constitution than he ever will! Trump failed America! #TrumpVirusKillsAmericans, churches, sports, restaurants, vacations, schools, etc!
Never heard of Joe Biden until yesterday, I’m guessing.
Biden/Harris 2020! Perfect Vision!
kamala harris is a cop and joe biden is a pedophile. but do you really want the homophobic and the racist rapist in office instead? no. vote blue.
#Biden picks #KamalaHarrisForVP the one candidate that couldn't make it thru Iowa Primary. Knowing Joe is unlikely to finish 4 yr term  you're voting for #kamala for president. Didn't play well in #Iowa won't play well in the country.
Why is Biden saying she’s going to lead the country in January 2021 if he is elected? Who’s going to be her VP?
Is this the first time you’ve heard of Biden?
I don't see it that way at all, although it's a moot point since Biden chose her.  I think she'll make a fantastic VP, just cause i preferred Rice dodge mean i didn't want Kamala :) I'm just glad he picked a POC if he'd have picked Whitmer I'd have been extremely disappointed
People really think Biden boutta win the election
please just give me one time where biden calls her michelle by accident
Now let's get it done in November!!  Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate
All you've been doing on Twitter is complaining  and whining about Biden and how you hate having to vote for him, and now you're complaining about Harris. I'm sorry, but when democracy is on the line with an opponent like Trump, I'll happily take an honest, caring man like Biden.
Biden/Harris 2020!!!! Time to take out the trash!!!!
Shortly after the news broke, President Trump posted a video ad on Twitter attacking Harris as a "phony" and Biden as "not that smart" for picking her.
Musing:  An interesting choice!  She's young which could take some of the load off of Biden because she could do travels and political things he may not have the energy to do!
Kamala Harris is Biden's VP. Are you as surprised as him when he found out? Kamala Harris 'identifies' as African American and considers her experience to be American even tho her mother is from India, and her father is from Jamaica.

Yooo did you guys know Joe Biden is a devout Catholic?! 😲  If he gets elected we'll probably have nightly fireside chat rosaries from the Oval Office. How could will that be!
So many are calling him VP Biden, that’s also so wrong!!! He was but isn’t now!!!
I’m sure the powers in charge at the USPS want Biden, but not all employees will vote that way!! Some are gun owners and hunters
Sandra how can you say a Fox poll shows Biden leading Trump by 7 points? Seriously if you people in the media and DC politicians believe the American people want what Biden is selling you are all delusional.
"Trump hits back at Biden after call for national mask mandate: ‘Stop playing politics with the virus’" "Biden on Thursday called for a nationwide mask mandate"
I completely understand that reporting poll numbers for Biden &amp; Trump is news, but can we please REGULARLY acknowledge that polls are NOT always the true measure of the political environment. A repeat of the 2016 over confidence is a dangerous message.
Joe Biden and kamala Harris is the best the democrats have?
Why are we feeding into this?? Joe Biden as of right now is NOBODY. Does he even have a job? Does Kamala? Who the hell do they think they are to demand or mandate anything? Donald Trump is the President. So here’s to the mask “mandate” from the nobodies: #MasksOff #MasksDontWork

"Young voters love Trump’s plan — when told it’s Biden’s…"
Not if you and Biden raise taxes. He already said he would if elected. Go get a real job like the rest of us and see if you want your taxes raised.
Biden hasn't done anything for "us".
I teared up a little when they started talking about Bo Biden
I think Biden will debate and wipe the floor with the serial liar. Taxes of the candidates should be a mandate!!!

The enthusiasm for President Trump can’t be matched by Biden/Harris

I think Biden chose well. She has experience and tenacity. Strong pick.
I have new hope that I’ll see a woman president in my lifetime. Biden/Harris in 2020! Let’s bring this strange year to a happy ending.
Call me a tin foil wearing fool, I just think the DNC gave Biden the nomination as a life time achievement award. Harris will end up full filling his term.
These reporters are stupid, the keep saying Vice President Biden. He’s NOT the Vice President any more!!!
Interesting that you think I'm a Biden supporter.
John, that is who will be president, when Biden is removed for being unfit, February of 2021.
And Biden has to unravel a lot of crap
Don’t think I’ve felt this kind of joy in more than three years. 💙Biden/Harris💙.

Yo  You're killing me, Smalls! What are you going to do, vote for Biden? Do you really believe you can contructively influence   with negative tweets. I suspect he marches to his own drummer, but, hey, go for it! 😁😁🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🙏
I’m not so sure he would be taking votes from Biden... there’s a bunch of people who don’t like Trump  or Biden...
Why won’t the mainstream media cover what Biden said yesterday?  Could you imagine if Trump said anything close to that!?
U.S. intelligence has assessed that China is hoping President Donald Trump does not win reelection, Russia is working to denigrate Democrat Joe Biden and Iran is seeking to undermine democratic institutions.

Donna Brazile cheats by giving the debate questions 2 Hillary ahead of time. She lies on a daily basis about Repubs &amp; our Prez, yet she professes 2 be a woman of faith &amp; wants us 2 believe Joe Biden is too. Not sure she's the right messenger.
All this talk about Biden's problems are projection and you know it. Trump was saying that Biden mispronouncing words was exactly what Trump did with Thigh-land. Trump looks ill when he walks, he's losing concentration when he talks. He's destroying tus. Do you care
Alongside Joe Biden and Donald Trump's name on Colorado's presidential ballot will be Kanye West.
Do you ever wonder who is writing Joe Biden’s tweets?
You, Biden, said racism is "baked into" Trump's campaign.... And class warfare is baked into yours and that's inextricably linked to the very same racism. It's why we hate you too, Biden, sir.
Politically, what do you believe is the alternative? Are Joe Biden and the Democrat platform more Christ like? I see you don't like Trump. (Me either) just curious what you think is a better option with our choices?
Also, Putin’s fear of a Biden presidency! He’s more afraid of Biden than he was of Obama! It’s the same fear that all the dictators have. Erdogan, MBS, Kim,,, they have taken advantage of the US in ways only drumpf would allow.
Colorado! Voting by mail! Biden and Hickenlooper! Gardner needs the boot!!!

It's the Scotus pick. Secretary of state. AG. Let. Col. Vindman's, ambassadors, federal judges. D The list is huge. We need someone that understands our constitution!

Not if it’s from trumps administration. When we get a vaccine under President Biden yes I will!
Biden/Harris-dripping slime as they emerge from the swamp.
We are all humans, if you are a Biden supporter, great. If you are a Trump supporter, great. But to create division by touting what we assume the other side will do, does no good!
I do not disagree. Even if and after Biden is sworn in, there may be major unrest.
More jobs under Trump-Pence since May than all of Obama-Biden.  (Even in a Pandemic, Trump's record is better than Obama-Biden)
Kamala: It was all theater! None of it is real! I'm not real! Joe Biden is not real! It's all bullshit!

Biden: 'A Black Woman Will Become President Over My Dead Body' ....
I care about what he has to say and I plan to vote for Biden, right now he has millions of people who will vote a straight blue ticket, just as you will votes red ticket.   Now is it so hard to be decent?
I still feel good about it because Hillary won my state anyway &amp; Bill is even creepier now (it was so cringe to think of him as the first gentleman). But if I lived in a swing state that went Trump I might regret voting for Johnson over Clinton. All in for Biden/Harris this year.
He's gonna do a LOT more of this in different ways. The strategy will be to divide the left more, and play to republicans who could be on the fence toward Biden. Think about who he needs to secure and think backwards every time he makes a move. He will also distract in ways.
Trump pushed that Israel deal through because he knew that Biden would agree for votes, and he knew that this could stir up trouble with the left. He uses the Israel/ "middle east" card strategically. Watch the strategy, pay attention, don't get played by him.
100% agree. Fortunately, I live in a state where I can return a ballot to a collection box, but still...I'd crawl over glass to vote for Biden.
a photoshopped picture of you on a bike won’t do it. We want to see a live shot of you riding with secret service &amp;answering questions from reporters at the same time!   You know, like Biden did! It should be easy your very fit doctor says you’re in better shape!
Have you noticed that the Corvid-19 virus and the BLM violence has allowed the MSM to ignore Tara Reade and her allegations against Biden? Have you noticed that?
Which is why we are voting for Biden/Harris! She is awesome and Kavanaugh is a political hack!
Wait, an overzealous prosecutor with a record of hiding evidence and keeping innocents in jail declared a case she's neither working, nor familiar with, (nor even exists) "open and shut?" SSSShhhhhhhocking.
Harris is a truly bad pick for Biden! Thank you, Joe!
Biden should drop out of the race and vote for Trump/Pence.

Health questions for Biden off-limits for media, unlike Reagan, McCain and Trump.  (Of course, to the MSM Kamala Harris is a moderate and Joe Biden is articulate)
Yes I’m so relieved about it. I would have very different feelings if I didn’t see this kind of compromise, inclusion, and concern on Biden’s teams part - they’re clearly being considerate of the most progressive leaders.

Maybe. I think Biden's primary goal is to do no harm, and when you don't have strong views on anything like Kamala, you're good. This election is going to be a referendum on Trump, strong Dems will come out anyway.
Or a sex offender?
You going to make him answer? Deep State really likes you because your compromised.

Biden Touts Catholic Faith A Month After Vowing To Crack Down On Nuns.
Serious question: I get Biden is not the "progessive" but do the following appointments not mean anything to you? SCOTUS, Sec of State, AG, IG, Ambassadors, The Lt. Vindman's of the world, Federal Judges, and more. Seriously, if trump is elected you will not have any or ACA
But hey   tell me more about Biden’s dementia.  I saw Biden active on a bike. I saw trump unable to drink a glass of water or walk down a ramp.   Biden knows WWII ended in 1945. Trump doesn’t even know the 1918 pandemic was in 1918!

Awesome. We need all of this. We can save tons with Trump out of office and not lining his or his friends pockets with billions of taxpayer dollars.   Vote Biden!
"Progressives" that are still aligning themselves with the Clinton/Obama/Biden Democratic Party are part of the establishment and will change nothing.
Careful next time you’re down in Mexico, Joe Biden, they treat hair sniffers a bit different down there 😀
So remind me how Joe Biden became the nominee.  What were his characteristics and skills?  After god knows how long in government, I can’t find any major contributions.  Does Joe have an original thought that he can actually express?
...You realize the actual left also hates Biden, right?  He's a rightwing candidate that is for the status quo and won't fix a damn thing.
Of course the American people need to see Biden attempt to debate the president! Why would you not do the interview to get a job??? How is this not obvious?!?!?!? #HidenBiden #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2020

RE: Clinton Fdsn A two-year inquiry initiated by the Trump Justice Department found no evidence of wrongdoing.  Trump lawyers would find something IF something could be found. But then, Trump accuses everyone of EXACTLY the s$&amp;t he does. Especially Biden, Obama and Clinton.

The people who get their information strictly from corporate media have no idea who Joe Biden, or Barack Obama for that matter, really are and who they represent.
I’ve never stated I was for Biden lmao! I agree he’s a racist, pedo with dementia. But so is trump. Trump can’t even put together full sentences.
It’s time for black people of ALL political persuasions to start checking Joe Biden for his racist statements.

Ah yes, Joe Biden the devout Roman Catholic, has no religion and will hurt God. 🤨
Biden will take away food, water, oxygen, housing, businesses, dogs and the world will explode instantly. Alternative facts
why do you think West suppresses black votes for Biden?  Why Do you think blacks are SO STUPID to vote for a clearly mentally ill man who proclaimed slavery a choice??!!  Just because he is black?

You’re voting for who gets to pick RBGs replacement. I’d rather have Biden in charge of that pick than trump. Everyday of the week.
Jo Jorgensen is the only candidate running on the platform of bringing American military back home. Trump and Biden have shown that they're still about dropping bombs on foreign countries.

Rudy Giuliani’s daughter announces her support for Biden/Harris
Trumps “press conference “ is only a trash Biden conference. Trash Harris. Why reporters stay is beyond me!
I guess it would be beneficial for Biden to be elected. He knows exactly what legislation needs to be repealed to gdt rid of police abuse of Americans, because they have his name on them.😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I think I am going to lose some money on that one if Biden wins the election, but satisfaction of knowing the money will be put in good use makes up for it.
Got a guy in another thread right now trying to convince me Biden changing his mind about the laws he co-authored/passed is still better than Trump.😂🤣
Do you really want to talk about the past 50 years of Ds and Rs? How about just Biden's record in 50 years in Senate and VP? They've done way more harm than good, and left us with a $27,000,000,000,000 bill.
Your daughter supports Biden and Harris.   You just look like a fool.
Why is a Biden lie worse than a Trump lie?
God Biden sounds like a President. We've been desensitized to the abhorrent behavior of Trump.
According to  Kampala Harris was ranked as the most Liberal US Senator in 2019. Biden is losing votes in November.
Joe Biden now partnered with Antifa
But Biden's laws he co-authored still stay on the books 25 years later. He may have "changed his mind", but we still have to deal with the consequences of Biden's actions.
We started with one covid infection, now we have over a million infected, more than 155 thousand dead Americans, and President Trump said covid will soon disappear. It didn't! That’s the kind of opponent Joe Biden and everyone will love to run against!
Biden is in bed with the clintons. The clintons are on trial for treason. Do i need any other reason to be skeptical?
We should not even be talking about Biden becoming president. Because he will not. Period.
Trump has continued the borrowing &amp; spending. He's running up the debt as we speak with a suspended debt ceiling til end of year. He refuses to end the war on drugs. He refuses to address qualified immunity or the Biden Crime Bills allowing police abuse &amp; murder of Americans.
the crippling student debt that joe biden saddled me with, that i couldn’t get out from under is the reason i didn’t go to grad school
Thanks to the mandatory minimum drug sentences Biden co-authored and helped pass where child rapists can now serve less time than drug dealers. Harsh drug penalties and a War, but drug use is still the same as 1972 when it all started.
"Electing Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators. We cannot allow our Nation to go down that path."
"From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE."
this "...shows Biden &amp; the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine &amp; Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America First.
here's some bullshit the orange turd's trainwreck campaign emailed out this morning about Biden picking Harris:
End the Drug War, cut federal govt spending and get powers back to state/local govt under 10th Amendment, end global warfare, end qualified immunity, repeal the Biden Crime Bills,.. I'm all for the Libertarian platform.
Trump is a complete disgrace to all of America and the WORLD yet you’re going to enable him to win the 2020 election because you don’t like Biden’s VP pick? Grow up.
This shows that Joe Biden is confident and secure in himself as opposed to a weak, fragile baby like tRump. Joe will actually listen to others. Gee, what a novel idea!
This isn’t even “the alternative.” This is *now.* This is happening and has been happening and will keep happening. So go on and call me whatever you want for voting Biden/Harris. I’m still voting for them for you. Yes, you.
Biden- Corporate United States worships money and power even as Earth Extinction event to end all other events locked down on the sacred rights of words we stand by post Coup. The Trump Russian Oligarchy= Where is the Purple Majesty... as Earth is locked into heat and entropy to.
I hear you but ..... Biden2020 Biden 2024 Harris 2028 Harris 2032 looks pretty darn good to me !!!! Celebrate that!!!!
How does she reconcile this:
My problem is Biden spent 50 years in DC as a Senator &amp; VP. He couldn't change his mind about legislation he created &amp; passed when he was in a position to do something about it? Instead we still have to deal with the laws he left on the books allowing police to abuse Americans.
How does she justify running as his VP? Politics of course.
I finally found something I agree with them on: I also believe Biden's sexual assault accusers (and Trump's)
Biden loss for sure. Trump 2020!
Kamala's record of not investigating police abuse/corruption in CA matches directly with Biden's Crime Bills that gave police the authority/incentives/weapons to harass/detain/search/arrest/abuse/kill poor &amp; minority Americans. #LetHerSpeak #GoJo2020
Any person voting D because they "represent minorities" is being sold BS. Biden created the laws police are using to harass/detain/search/arrest/abuse/kill poor &amp; minority Americans, &amp; Kamala's record as CA AG is not investigating police abuse/corruption. #LetHerSpeak #GoJo2020

Haha your opinion doesn’t matter Biden&amp;Harris SMH gross.
The UK press clearly didn't cover Biden's conversion to Satanism.

Excellent ad for Biden/Harris 2020 in this remark
Wow!  Brilliant move Mr. Biden!  Keep your friends close and your enemies closer...
Gonna be honest, I saw Biden’s VP pick coming.   Still not happy with our election choices and I’m not a fan of the existing system but the changes I’d like to see would take much longer than I like.
YES! With Kamala Harris as Biden's VP pick, Newsom has a chance to appoint history-making senator

What's the difference between Biden and Trump? Who they want to give govt money (our tax dollars) to: poor people and businesses or rich people and businesses. That's it.
My favorite anti-Biden meme, although it does have 1 inaccuracy...he didn't vote against Roe v Wade, he just didn't support it in a 1974 interview.

So remarkable he had to drop it after he said some of the most racist ignorant shit I ever. Heard the democratic party is so sorry this dude shouldn't be allowed to work at a waffle house let alone run a country. Biden just throw in the towel buddy. I can't wair for the debates
Biden, he’s probably the nominee!
I made a thing. also: vote Biden!
This actually trends if you follow crazy logic so I'm trying. Trump is in power because he made a deal with the devil.. God apparently can't defeat the devil totally (that's why he still exists)..So Biden must be more powerful than God (and therefore blasphemous) to defeat Trump

Seems like he’ll say anything to win — Biden is a life long Catholic. Certainly more religious that Pres Trump. And more cautious gun regulation is not the same as taking your guns away. This feels like he’s getting desperate and over exaggerating to stoke fear.
Obviously Trump believes Biden is stronger than God. Strange for such a religious man.

Spent an hour waiting to get postcard stamps, to write postcards for Biden/Harris.  Turns out you have to order them online, and wait 7 days to get them.  I called your office, spoke to Hannah.  You need to be working, organizing protests, or fighting the Dictator.  Not tweeting.
Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
All I have is a high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way. Maybe the undereducated would be more likely to vote “left” if you assholes weren’t so goddamned condescending.
I have high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way.
Will Biden do something about the shower heads. We can’t forget the shower heads.
Less so than Trump's collision course with history. As I alluded to, with Biden we at least have a fighting chance to survive. Trump and republicans are an unmitigated disaster. Vote strategically, think long term. Vote your values locally where they especially count.
Yep, that's weird to me too. But Dem/Rep is some not sort of mirror-opposite pair. We the People at least have a voice with Dems. Republicans serve *only* the wealthy with "trickle down" as their solution to everything. Next POTUS will be Biden or Trump. Choose strategically.
I'm there.  Going to the Post Office this morning for stamps for my Biden/Harris postcards.
This is troubling. She has the right to her opinion, but this comes across as an endorsement for Biden.  Both parties do good, both do bad. What does she think about Biden / Harris stance on abortion?
Agree, lesser of two evils. But the fetus has no voice, we need to be the voice. Democrats have shown for decades that there is no budging on their pro-abortion position. Biden claiming to be Catholic yet pro-abortion? Respect human life begins with the fetus.
The presidential race is only one of many. Very meaningful work can be done locally. So the answer is always now. As for the next president, unfortunately it is again a two-party race - Biden or Trump. So vote Biden to fight another day. Trump is on a very destructive course.
There is so much wrong in this statement, I’m not even going to bother with responding other than to say, Mr. President   YOU ARE WRONG—AGAIN!  Vote Biden/Harris. We can do better in November!
Trump is a not representing Republican values and is hurting our nation, and the party has the audacity to call Biden/Harris radical left?
I enjoy that Presidential campaigns are turning into meme offs. Biden needs to step it up.
Wait, so Biden working hard to make progress while Trump just sits and does nothing? I thought he was "Sleepy Joe?" I'm confused.

Trump doesn't seem to understand that Biden is a private citizen and has no authority to do anything about the virus. This is what Trump does - projects his own failures onto other people.
What if the governors all started listening to Biden now? Acting like he's president...
When Biden becomes president and appoints Obama to the Supreme Court, your appeals to your convictions to crimes in office will meet a wall. #BidenHarris2020
Biden Leftist is the new Military Intelligence
Maybe making you rething the prespective you're incessently shouting and walking away from when someone hits a nerve?  Biden's not a help, he's an enabler.
Who Biden? Maybe it’s trump
You’re calling out CatholicVote, so you support Biden? A fake Catholic?  Really?
So you are saying you support Biden ? Please speak up, do you consider Biden, who says he is Catholic, even a good Catholic?  Answer please? Trump is no saint, but Biden ?
What the literal crazy?
And this Sunday Biden will go to church while Trump will be off on a golf course somewhere. His true religion
Bullshit!!! Obama/Biden added 11M jobs, you’ve lost 11M+ jobs!!!
Don't confuse democrats; lawful, rational, voting citizens like me, with rioters.  There's a chance the rioters might vote for Biden but I'm guessing they are disconnected from society to the extent they won't vote at all.  Nobody is courting them for support; we don't need them.
As #TrumpKillsUSPS, ask for your ballot early, vote Biden, close your envelope, sign it and take it to a drop box near you. That is the only way to work around the corruption of Trump and his cronies, including Putin. Vote! Go the extra mile. This country depends on it
I think I figured it out. You don't know who this guy is. That's why you don't care he is in very public neurological decline. He's your father. You should care that he can't read any longer. At least as much as you do about Joe Biden. #TrumpIsUnwell
Hahahahaha. She’s below average. Especially if your vote is really for her and not for Biden since he’s got dementia
You are an excellent person to match with Biden. Keep him in line along with he senate 😏
.  I absolutely loved hearing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak to our country today. They both are so articulate, so passionate and extremely intelligent. They love our country, they love their families and they will restore our democracy!
He’s doing if again. Quid pro quo. You elect me I’ll eliminate the tax I imposed on you. Someone tell Biden to make the same forgiveness claim.
He just gave rave reviews for Kamala Harris and referenced Biden as the next president of the US.
Also, your repeatedly calling Joe Biden "evil" sort of gives it all away.
U guys realize Biden is the same as trump only less of a cunt
My guess is he might actually be taking votes away from Donald - the Republicans who just can't bring themselves to vote for Joe Biden.
I’m voting Biden-Harris.   Let’s do this.  2020💙
Pure comedy to see Trumpers make moral arguments, or bring up corruption, or in one case "race baiting" to use against Biden/Harris vs Trump.  Republicans circled around a racist, corrupt, amoral, liar whose self absorption has caused more Americans to die than any war. FU!
I guess this is the only black person they know so they had to get him to run as a spoiler, so all black people will vote for Kanye and Joe Biden will lose????  Clueless!
Finally! This country has a big, wide ray of hope with a Biden/Harris ticket. Can we elect them tomorrow?
Wrong, Liz. Watch this. November 3rd we elect Biden/Harris. In a landslide.
Joe Biden is in the early stages of dementia.  So there’s that.
What about the Trump vs Biden debate? Isn’t that who the race is with Trump and Biden? What happened to that?
Dr. Biden, we are all ready!
Joe Biden’s selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate is a home run.  She’s an amazing public servant and will be a stellar VP.
The USA is no longer a world leader.  Thank you, I hope we get health care, also.   I agree. Our climate can't wait another day. Trump gutted EPA regulations &amp; pulled us out of the Paris Accord. Biden will rectify all of that.
As I have already said, Biden was my second to last choice.  I watched Kamala shred Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr. I enjoyed it. I am sick of white men being in power.   I actually wanted a Warren/Harris ticket, but god forbid we have an all female ticket.
We can only hope that Biden/Harris do a better job.  The Democratic party has evolved since 1994.
Biden was my second to last choice.  We had numerous more qualified female candidates.
What? You trying to be funny?  Hillary just acknowledged that the Democratic ticket is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   Maybe Tim should stop running his mouth.
Yes, all Republicans are pro-life. Republicans voted for Trump because they think he is pro-life. They are one-issue voters.  Biden is RESPECTED by people on both sides. That's a plus.  Answer my question - you want Trump?
I'd be more ready if it weren't Harris... or Biden.... but at this point I'll take Hillary over the current dumpster fire
The guy who wanted 5 kids to get the death penalty just for being guilty of being black is trying to tell us Biden is racist. I think you better spend your dollars convincing Ohio and Pennsylvania that we are going back 50 years and returning to a manufacturing economy.
Why are you so sure it won't get better under Biden/Harris?
Lauren, you are the type of leader we need in the white House, not Trump, not Biden, not Kamala
Had to break it to you but I never said I wanted Biden to lose
Biden has been out and about following social distancing protocol. God I can’t wait for the debates to start.
I’m in. Great Pick Joe Biden.
After giving it some VP Biden has made the right decision picking Kamala Harris for his running mate as VP in the 2020 election.
Oh, am I going to enjoy how they’ll kick your ass, Donnie. You’ll be humiliated and I hope you live long enough to suffer from jail for all you’ve done right after Biden takes over
People who think Joe Biden cares about me are stupid, im voting for him but only because I rather get punched in one eye than both
I absolutely agree. Four years of Biden, eight years of Harris! #BidenHarris #BlueWave2020
Biden just lost any chance of becoming President She is widely unliked by people on both sides
Yes. Now you can vote for that man in the White House.  We are fighting for our country. Vote Biden/Harris!
Apple autocorrect would like to announce Joe Biden’s running mate selection, Senator Kampala Harris #BidenHarris #ByeDonJr
truth Biden is a political liar and always has been and in 47 years he gave us the big time crime bill against Kamala Harris’s constituents
That Biden chose a Leftist Communist
Because “WE THE PEOPLE” for Biden don’t need the foolishness! People are sick of Trump and his blind followers!
Biden/Harris 2020: Get Bus...ted.
The Leftist Communists will have the Whitehouse if Biden is elected!! That is just the worst situation for America ever!!
Sitting here listening to... ...DONNIE FUCKSTICK.... blabble, blabble, blabber. WHEN ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO SAY SOMETHING INTELLIGENT ?? Now that we have a Biden/Harris ticket YOU ARE RUNNING SCARED !!
Certainly the pandemic has taught everyone that our health insurance shouldn't be tied to unemployment.  I am going to hold out a little hope that Biden/Harris will do the right thing.
everybody talking about who they wanted joe biden’s running mate to be, like bruh... i jus want her😔
I absolutely love this piece. Mail in ballots are the only way I have voted since turning 18. #2020Elections
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden’s running mate
It’s kind of comical that Harris called Biden a racist, demanded an apology, never got it, yet is now his running mate...
What lessons does Biden pick hold for 2024 deputy PM picks here? Starmer will want to balance his ticket northwards — Nandy has to be in with a shout. Blair did similar by picking Prescott as his running mate. Imagine Johnson/Sunak is already nailed on.
Biden/Harris! It's on like Donkey Kong!
Neither Biden nor Pence has military experience, either. I've long respected you, your service and your positions, but this one reeks.
Joe Biden confirms my exclusive:
Congratulations, Vice-President Kamala Harris!   Biden's announcement has brought me the first spark of hope I have felt in years!
Make no mistake, Kamala Harris is the real presidential candidate. If elected Joe Biden will not make it past 2/1/2021 before he is declared mentally unfit, and replaced by her. This is a bait and switch like no other.
And Biden won't become president til 2021.
Understand from Democratic Party source that Joe Biden is about to nominate Kamala Harris as his running mate
I'm thrilled! Biden made the best possible choice!
Why is Biden announcing this like a judges house episode of X Factor
We need to hold both houses of Congress and the White House. We can get there if #ProgressivesForBiden &amp; Independents join us to vote for Biden, then we should have a new president.
And just like that trumpies try to make Biden look as bad as Trump.  This will never happen; Trump has waay too much baggage, too many accusations, too many payoffs, too many divorces and too many human failures.  #MeToo is alive and well, thankfully.
The best choice for  Biden VP should be someone who has govern,  everything else will in place.
For Biden pick as  VP  Gretchen Whitmer .......
You have absolutely nothing.  All you can do is try to tear down Biden, because you can't run on the disastrous results of the last 3 1/2 years.  Can't wait until you're gone, and the SDNY puts 45 behind bars.  Lock him up!!
What else is new?  It's been this way since the late ‘80s.  I'm rooting for Harris.  She'd make a great president if Biden were to be incapacitated.
You interpret Biden's actions as sexual.  I think they're more misplaced grandfatherly affection; not necessarily sexual.  Agree it's weird and gross, but he's not Trump with huge amounts of sexual baggage that trumpies choose to ignore.
I disagree.  There is no evidence he ever did anything sexual.  You perpetuate this false narrative.  Your cult leader did say “In 10 years I'll be dating her.  Can you believe it?”.  20+ allegations of sexual assault against Trump and you perpetuate this lie about Biden.
I don't excuse it.  I think it's creepy.  I am disappointed in the DNC's selection.  I’m not voting for Biden as much as voting against Trump who is 1000x worse.  As usual it's the choice of the lesser of 2 evils.
Those videos show Biden sniffing hair, that's all.  I agree it's weird but one could make a credible case for grandfatherly affection in all cases.  Nobody has filed suit although I think a couple said it was awkward.  Contrast this with 20+ allegations against Trump.
They can sign it. No one would understand it. This is my thing. Why does his family seemed publicly obsessed with Biden's health while being publicly obtuse to their father's health?
I would vote for a Biden/Obama ticket.
if his name was Joe Biden, you would be all over this. Right?  It can't be dementia if he didn't know in the first place.
This fucking idiot right here... and people are whining about we need to make a case for them to vote for Biden.  SMFH.
How awesome would this be if Buttigieg was picked as Biden’s VP. Lmao!! 🤣 I’m really rooting for this 🤣😉
I hope the 51 million plus people unemployed understand that their 401K will go down when Biden is president. I'm sure this is the most pressing thing on your plate right now while you fight eviction, go to a food bank and apply for unemployment. #TrumpPressConference
I vote for B...  yes option B and Biden.
so this is tge new employment scenario under Democratic Rule and Biden huh????
Biden can’t support his own train of thought for more than a few minutes. I’m not saying he’s too old to be president, but I don’t think he’s all mentally there enough to take on such a large responsibility as being the president of the United States of a America.
Joe Biden rides a bike, while daddy rides a golf cart!
Ok let's tally this up. China bought Biden &amp; the resulting carnage was Hunter got a job. Russia buys Heir Father &amp; the resulting carnage is 165,564 dead from the #TrumpVirus, dozens dead from Russian bounties, &amp; 51M+ unemployed. The only good thing is #MaryTrump's bestseller.
VOTE   FOR   BIDEN   !!!
VOTE  FOR  BIDEN   TKS   !!!
TELL   ALL    TO  VOTE   FOR    BIDEN  TKS   !!!
Biden is doing just fine. Looking forward to watching his inauguration in January 2021. So will the rest of the world.
Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, AOC, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, All socialist trying to create hostility in our society to gain political power and to push their socialist agenda.
I would vote for Biden if he picked his dog Major as his running mate.
I don’t know what happened with you two, but best wishes. I’m just happy Sandy is wearing a mask and voting Biden. My world is small.
Joe Biden is a Catholic ????  Don't make me puke.
Win what? No one delights in your public demise. Get some help. Get back to writing &amp; push your art. I don't think you are hurting Biden. I think you are hurting yourself &amp; your family. I'm going to be straight with you. I am not a fan of your music. But, I hate watching this.
You'd rather have the Orange Monster in the White House for 4 more years? I know Biden's not ideal, but he'll surround himself with qualified people, not grifters. He'll at least start steering the ship in the right direction.
Do Biden voters watch Fox?
Seriously are Democrats brainwashed it's amazing how they say one thing and do another just like Nancy pelosi blaming Trump for not doing things fast enough on coronavirus but yet it was her dancing around in Chinatown saying to not block people and Joe Biden saying xenophobe wth
Why would anyone even think this?  Can somebody defend this position or are her marbles just as loose as Joe Biden?
He wasn't trailing Biden for the last 3 years
Have you shown your father half as much interest in his medical care that you have shown Biden? I know you are kind of the ignored one because you don't have his name &amp; you don't have a vagina, but that reality that you don't SEE your father's brain is rotten fruit is glaring.
The idea that Kanye should suspend his mental illness long enough for Biden to get elected is ridiculous. The run is the disease.
No one would do what you've done!  Competent presidents would have nipped this in the bud in December of last year.  They wouldn't ignore everything around them for months.  I've been working from home in March and I don't see any end it sight -- until President Biden!
Educate yourself and read, Biden has been called out for his pro-abortion stance.
Do I want to hear a debate of Trump  saying Biden is going to destroy GOD and Biden saying you are a ridiculous fool. I will pass. It is not my type of comedy.
Biden was also 100% against gay marriage until the SCOTUS ruled on the decision. He suddenly supports their rights to marry.
if Biden's thumb was on life support and Biden's thumb were on the ballot, I'd vote for Biden's thumb.  Doing anything else only contributes to the total destruction of the United States.
If Biden can hurt the Christian god then either he’s more powerful than their god, or their god is a pussy.
Biden’s one tough MF if he can hurt god!😂
War Biden! Before I just was picking lesser of two evils now you say I’m voting for Kratos? #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Trump is god in this scenario. Biden will hurt Trump if he wins....like his feelings, I guess?
Stupid Biden
It seems like the obvious voting strategy (at the national level) is "Biden plus Republicans in the Senate to check him." I suspect the outcome will be "Biden plus the Senate Republicans take a shellacking."
Next week:  "Biden's green deal means cars are illegal, dishwashers illegal, no cops, no airplanes, no toilets.  Think about that, no toilets.  I think about that.  My hotels have the best toilets.  Biden will take all the toilets out of the suburbs and give them to inner city"
Has anyone else noticed that Biden looks a lot like Walter?  Coincidence?   #JeffDunham #WalterJeffDunham
This is not what is going to bring down Joe Biden.  It's reaching as hard as they can to find something, anything to stick to Biden.   COVID19 is what is on America's mind, and this is meh!
The funniest part about  saying Biden will "Hurt the Bible. Hurt God. He's against guns. He's against energy. " is I haven't been to church in never, but that's what your sermons are like? God, guns, and energy?  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
So Joe Biden said that the African-American isn't diverse because AFRICAN-Americans' ancestors are from Africa, but Hispanic-Americans can have ancestors from Spain, Mexico, Brazil, etc.  How is that insulting?  Who is insulted?
No, your guns will NOT be taken away. And, Joe Biden wants to allocate MORE $ to police dep’ts. Don’t believe this douchenozzle. 864511320
Still baffling that the leaders of the free world, the most powerful nation on earth, are giving people a choice of Biden or Trump as president.
"Biden hurts God"  Dude, don't we have to vote for the guy who can hurt God?  I mean maybe he wasn't talking about The God. Just some little Greek or Egyptian god. Little "g".  But still, that's pretty impressive. I think I will vote for that guy no matter what, right?
This is what Trump said today about Joe Biden, a practicing Catholic. What church does Trump go to? Trump plays golf on Sundays, right? How can Biden "hurt God"? Does Trump sound like a leader is this video?
😂😂😂😂  Honey, read up.
It is your vote. What is it with some white women? He hasn’t destroyed and killed off enough us yet?  His health appears worse than Biden’s. So you approve more of Pence the CINO (Christian in name only) and one of that man in the White House’s “followers”?
I’m sorry but that headline is one of the dumbest I’ve ever read and I can’t imagine anything in your article that could possibly change my opinion.   You’d pick trump/pence over Biden/someone you don’t like?
I know. That man in the White House’s VP is a CINO (christian in name only) and a “follower”. How could Biden’s VP be worse?  For some that R means everything to them 😢.
Are you a never trump?  If you are unable to vote for Biden depending on his VP pick wa wa, maybe you are party over country. Sounds like an excuse.
This guy is telling people about Biden's relationship with God?
"More progressive than Biden" IS NOT PROGRESSIVE. HE VOTED FOR SEGREGATION!!!Someone intel-check me here:  if he suppresses Biden's votes, isn't he also suppressing Trump votes?  Feel free to drag me if I'm missing something obvious.
2020 Election: What Biden's Democratic Platform Proposes For People 50+ via
Biden is not the POTUS. He’s not a doctor. Technically he’s just creepy Uncle Joe right now. #MeToo #MAGA2020 #DontTouchMe #KnowYourRoleAndShutYourMouth
That won’t happen if Biden retreats to the way that the Obama administration dealt with Iran.
The President of the United States 🇺🇸 is Sabotageing the United States Postal Service to Try &amp; Suppress Free &amp; Fair Voting  in The United States of America 🇺🇸. Now .. Today he Admitted that on National TV !  Vote Biden-Harris 2020 Save Free &amp; Fair Elections in USA 🇺🇸 ! Vote 2020!
Trump went on National TV &amp; said Yes if re-elected he will End The Payroll tax ie- Social Security ! On National TV ! Vote Biden-Harris 2020 !  Vote By MAIL !
Payroll Tax is Social Security !  tRump will  Eliminate Social Security IF  re elected.  Vote Biden- Harris. 2020  !!
How rich. Biden has been hiding in his basement.
Anyone voting for Trump over Biden for religious reasons  is brain dead anyway...
You have got to be kidding!! People are not stupid. The economy and unemployment was a mess for 8 yrs under Biden and Obama and they blamed Bush . Get your facts straight
Biden called Trump's China travel restrictions back in January xenophobic. Biden and Harris apparently vying for the most dishonest ticket in US history. Harris is a liar or her ambition supersedes concerns that she has that Biden is a racist and a serial sexual abuser.
I’m a suburban wife, mom, and teacher. I’ll be voting for Biden/Harris. 💙🇺🇸
Joe Biden is insane. We have 50 state governments with health departments that can decide what is best for their states. We don't need a coastal liberal to tell us all what we have to do.
seeing Biden behind that desk on TV Saying rational things - it’s like OMG th SYS what leadership fees like - I had forgotten
Let's start calling Biden and Harris, "Mean and Nasty".
Liar.  next,  next,  next,  All Biden. Toss ups in Ohio, North Carolina, then add 80,000 dead Americans many in TX, GA and IA and I like my chances.  Better stop the mail and call Putin.
You nailed it:  Trump Train Wreck.  Biden/Harris going to mop the floor with you.   #1Term. #Loser
Biden criticized Trump for taking out General Qasem Soleimani but now says that Trump has coddled terrorists. Declining mental faculties and dishonesty is not a good combination
This sounds like misty-eyed optimism.  The only way he ratchets up his favorability is if Biden's poll-power drops significantly.  Trump's "love" comes only from his base, and that's static.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Seniors for Biden: Social Security Anniversary Event hosted by Jill Biden and Louis Gossett Jr.” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
'Open and shut': Kamala Harris argues case is clear against Trump in introduction as Biden's running mate  via
Leftism is things like universal healthcare, which I thought Biden was waffle-ish about.
It's not a joke, it's a nebulous term people (including Trump) are trotting out to invoke fear of a Biden presidency.
Anti Trump isn't a platform. The democrats need to be FOR things. Easy to articulate and rally around. (Their version of "build the wall") Biden is just another old man, with rambled sentences. FAR better than Trump, but not inspiring. Trump has fear and anger on his side.
Shes locked up almost as many black people as biden. I thought we were against police shes a cop. Hmmmmm seems you dont know much outside of playing basketball
Trump is going to have a Rough time with Joe Biden Also !  Is time to Drain the gOp Swamp !
I’m excited about the Biden/Harris ticket. And if the “professionals” turn out to be correct, President Harris will be inaugurated in Jan 2025. And Mayor Pete? He will be her VP.  Exciting times for our country.
First order of business for Biden/Harris
You have zero So do 100% I am posting this reply. I know Pres Trump/ Pence  have do a much better job through a turmoiled 3 3/4 yrs . Better by far than 8 corrupt yrs Obama/ Biden. Biden/Harris more corruption,Dems are socialists. SAD . Not good , not happening
I so thought Biden would pick her!I guess she as too much corrupt baggage to Obama. Very familiar to Biden though
She did say that she believed the women that accused Biden of aggressive sexual advances and sexual assault.
Really I so see it waay differently. Kamal is a real fraud . Also has lied numerous times as had Biden..  Biden for sure in his comments about college degreees etc
So I really want to ask ALLDemocracts are you comfortable  with Biden choosing Kamala Harris as VP? As well are you comfortable being a Democract /Socialist Party ??
Since Putin is still alive how about a Biden/Putin ticket?
My only comment is WHAT? 😊 she is totally incompetent and I know many in Calif. think so as well. Minorities, prisoners , common people.. actually Biden during debates.. so.. as a GOP I’m good. I have Trump/Pence 🇺🇸
I wouldn't be surprised. His base is energized. No one I know is excited about Biden.
Biden won because he wasn't as extreme as the other candidates. With his declining mental faculties, there is a real possibility that she could president during his first term. People that were worried about Harris will be even more worried tonight. This pick is made for Trump!
Biden became the presumptive nominee running as a moderate as compared to ultra liberals like Harris. Harris did poorly in the primaries because of her far left liberal views. The point is Biden is no longer a moderate and his association with Harris and AOC prove it.
Having a California liberal on the ticket is inconsistent with the idea that Biden is a moderate. AOC is one of his advisors. Her attacks on Biden during the debates puts into question the level of respect that she has for Biden.
I really would love to see a Dem team of rivals if Biden wins. Bring in Warren, Castro, Sanders, Booker, and Klobuchar to fix this mess.
Looks like the stock market likes a Biden-Kamala option.
Kamala Harris Is Biden’s Choice for Vice President
Biden picks the candidate who believes his rape accuser...well done Joey. #KamalaHarris
Joe Biden has selected a person with a cervix who is a descendant of slave owners.
Biden/Harris! We got this!
Joe Biden has selected his puppeteer with a cervix as his running mate.
Pedophile Joe creepy Biden who happens to have Alzheimer’s is not a presidential candidate who by the way wants socialism
If you have anything similar to this Trump lawsuit about Biden, I’d love to see it. Otherwise, in America, we are innocent until proven guilty in court, and Biden has never even been charged with anything like this. But keep believing the propaganda, it’s what helps Trump most.
And Trump is defunding Social Security and Medicare. At least Biden isn’t tearing away the money from grandmas and grandpas who need it.
So, let me explain why I’m on board with VBNMW this year. I’m Jewish, my hubby is Mex-Am, and we have 3 girls. We have faced hate from Trumpers for 4 years. Even got death threats. Nazis love him. And they hate Biden. So I go with who the Nazis hate.
If you could provide evidence of your claims, I’d be happy to read them. I know of one assault accusation, and it pisses me off. Those I wanted never did those kinds of things, but they didn’t win. I don’t have to love everything about Biden, but I’m repulsed by everything Trump.
I do. Again, guy who’s bankrupted multiple businesses, multiple rape charges, friends with lots of pedos, 170K+ Americans dead, or Biden. I’ll happily go with Biden.
Lol, I’m no neoliberal, just someone who sees the danger in voting for anyone but Biden, as that’ll certainly give the win to Trump. But hey, enjoy whatever you’re on, clearly it’s working well for you 😂
H1N1, Ebola... no pandemics? No, they just didn’t hit American shores like COViD has, because we had a plan in place that Trump dismantled. And please show me the credible rape allegation against Biden, I’d be happy to provide the same for Trump.
Trump has been accused of raping at least 20 women, including one who was 13 at the time. Biden sniffs hair. And you think they’re the same?
I did the same &amp; voted for my fave. None of my top 5 got the nom. Biden is the only other candidate with at least as much name recognition as Trump, which means he has the best chance at beating him. So that’s why I’m voting for him, because that’s what matters most right now.
Cool, but you know that means Trump will win, right? This isn’t the year to take a stand; we tried and ended up with Biden anyway. Please consider holding the fight off until 2024 so we can get the country closer to where it needs to be, and I promise I’ll be back to joining you.
So... you want to ensure Trump wins by peeling off Biden voters? Because until you commented, I’d never heard of that candidate, and my guess is, there’s several million other Americans that haven’t and won’t vote for him. Stop sabotaging America.
Sorry you’d rather have someone actually accused of rape by almost 20 women over someone who’s bad at respecting space bubbles. And while we’re comparing, remind me of how many Americans died total due to pandemics under Obama-Biden and how many have died with Trump? Yeah.
1. Biden is not immune, never said he was, just that he’s better than Trump. 2. Trump will be on the ballot this Nov, and this is the only time I’ve supported VBNMW. 3. We get the country back on track and move further left in 2024.
Not a neoliberal, just don’t want to let this country continue with Trump. Didn’t vote for Biden in the primaries, just smart enough to recognize that if I don’t vote for him, Trump wins. Sorry you haven’t come to that conclusion yet, hope your vote doesn’t give Trump the win.
America doesn’t actually practice democracy. If we did, we wouldn’t have an electoral system that gives the win to someone who actually lost. And Biden is a far better choice than Trump, hands down.
For this election, anyone is better than Trump. None of my top 5 picks were nominated, so instead I’m voting for Biden as he’s the only other candidate with a chance at winning. Keep fighting the good fight, I’ll join again in 2024. But right now, we need Trump out.
That’s where I’m at. None of my top five got the nom, but I’d take Biden over Trump in a heartbeat.
Even if they did have justification, they wouldn't.  They'd roll him out like a Weekend at Bernie's skit before they'd let Pence step in, or his base would collectively lose their sh*t.  Similarly, the Dems would never admit failure with Biden, unless it was the plan all along.
Seeing the reticence to invoke 25A now, what causes you to believe it would happen with Biden?
How in the WORLD ? Is Biden rising in the polls of how he would handle the Coronavirus ????? Truly inaccurate reporting or polls!! What the heck ? I don’t in ANYWAY agree!!!
Still rather have Biden over Trump. This year we need to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho to ensure we can have an election in 2024, because having Trump get re-elected means we could officially slide into authoritarianism.
As long as he doesn’t pick someone named Trump or Pence, I’m still voting for Biden ❤️
Biden says Trump executive order is 'a reckless war on Social Security'
Have you loony Libs seen Biden’s “press” conferences???
Biden campaigning about returning decency and honesty to the White House proves once again that the last thing Joe Biden is honest. Here he perpetuates a lie debunked years ago.
Why would Joe Biden need a helmet?
Proving yet again that Reliable Sources is anything but reliable. Nearly 40% of the American people believe that Joe Biden is suffering from declining mental faculties.
But if you vote for Creepy Joe Biden aren’t you doing the same with a mental ill person?
Did trump just bribe (trying to buy) the American people by saying "If I'm victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax," Trump said. "Joe Biden and the Democrats may not want that, they don't want that."
Joe Biden wears a mask while biking... but doesn’t wear a helmet.   Hey Joe, more than 26,000 U.S. children have been sent to the emergency room for a traumatic brain injury related to bicycle riding.   THIS sums up his mental capacity of Biden right there.
Joe Biden is not the president, genius. He is not an elected official.  Why doesn't your boss tell Moscow Mitch to hold a vote on the bill that passed the House months ago?
I'm blown away that it's come down to Biden vs. Trump, but here we are.  It's the GOP's only play though, because championing Trump but calling Biden out looks like hypocrisy.  They're both relics from another era, and really should never have been considered in the first place.
Biden isn't president and HOLY HELL Trump's entire life is a scam.
Wasn’t that what Biden’s sexual assault accuser also said his response was when she rebuffed him? This was well before he “coined the phrase”.
We have been ever since Trump was installed in office. It’s been a clown show and Putin’s been pulling the strings. Can’t blame China for trying, Russia makes it look easy. Problem is, Biden isn’t an easy mark like Trump, so all this does is hurt the validity of a win.
And cases will be zero...  You are losing to Biden!!
Problem: Biden thinks Trump supporters read. They don’t. Therefore with this ad, they only see cars, billboards, and toilet paper.
Trump says Thigh-land, Roasted endlessly, Biden "Accidentally" says blacks are not diverse, Forgiven.
And if Biden and BO were so progressive, why wasn't there a 1st Step Act in the 8 yrs under in the BO/Biden administration? Listen, im not above being impressed by credentials and formalism and politeness, but when discussing policy none of that matters.
Biden also voted for the War in Iraq. How many rural whites, poor blks &amp; brown folks young men were killed in that unnecessary war that eroded all of our civil liberties and is bankrupting our country to this day? Trump and his tacky RE properties had no real power over blks.
Everyone acknowledges that the war on drugs was a failed experiment and big stain on the our country. We threw millions of ppl in a cage for max time, for non violent crimes. Biden, however, still thinks it was the right thing to do. What has Trump done thats equivalent to that?
Its a legitimate point, but let's think about who did the most harm to black and brown folks. Biden was the mastermind behind punitive crack/cocaine laws and wrote the legislation that paved the way for an entire generation of black and brown fathers to ripped from their families
“Maybe he [Biden] does have a stutter  but I know when he delivered the crime bill speech back in the 90s he didn’t stutter then. I saw the video.” -Anonymous blk man
Monday:  "Biden has full-blown dementia and doesn't even know what he's saying.  He shouldn't even be driving!"  Thursday:  "Biden is not only 100% lucid, he's cogently and explicitly describing his obviously racist thoughts."
How can Democrat’s support Biden? Simple question can someone give to me a real response? If your response is never Trump. I say back pathetic to not care what happens to OUR COUNTRY !!🇺🇸
You do realize that 4 more years of Trump is the alternative, right!?!  Biden could choose a warm egg salad as his running mate and he wouldn't lose my vote.
It does for the next four years at least. Anyone who would put us at risk by voting Biden and his progressive squad, can never profess to be conservative again. Don’t give a damn how you try and justify.
John Lewis would also agree with Joe Biden that all black people are the same.
. enjoyed your podcast with  Selfishly I want him in Biden’s administration vs a state gov or city’s mayor.  We want him at the highest in the land.
We don't need a debate to know we're voting for Biden. I would vote for a warm egg salad sandwich over you.This woman HAS to end up in the West Wing with Biden. And when she does we best be holding her accountable for nonsense like this.
“Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.”
80 days before Harris/ Biden vs Trump/Pence election. will it America be great again or will we be held hostage the next 4 years. Where is Hunter and Biden is the most racist person on earth. Just saying.
Barack Hussein Obama would like you to vote before the debates reveal Biden’s true level of mental deficiency.
Correction: BLM single handedly donates $48MM to Biden's campaign
While I agree that "Blue No Matter Who" in the presidential race is important, being hostile towards people with legitimate concerns about Biden/Harris isn't going to get them on your side.
I won’t survive it. 😥😥😥. Biden and Harris will win. We will vote even if we have to walk over hot coals or broken glass in our bare feet. We will vote and we will get rid of these criminals!
...and their union with 300,000 members just endorsed #Biden
Oh, I don't just mean interjecting on on political opinions, I mean potentially holding an office in the Biden Administration. Clinton and Biden go back a long way politically.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president #SmartNews
Cool. But how many Trumpers or undecided voters are gonna go "hmm 🤔 you know I never really paid attention to facts before, but now that this Black/Asian-American woman is saying those facts &amp; telling me Mike Pence is wrong, I'm gonna vote for Biden!"
If Biden wins every state carried by Hilary and re takes PA, MI and WI then game is over
You might want to get used to hearing the Clinton name. With Biden potentially winning the Presidency, there is also the potential that Hillary Clinton will re-enter the political arena in some form or another.  Not to bait a rabbit mob responding. but there is the possibility.
Yeah some lawyer nobody has ever even heard of getting a soft slap on the wrist. Hopefully I'm wrong about that outcome. If that is the outcome, Republican Party is dead as dead gets. Deader than Biden. Burnt toast 🔥🔥🔥
I’m not excited about a Biden Harris ticket. And I think people and survivors specifically have their very legitimate reasons for not voting for them. But if Angela Davis can settle for this ticket then so can I. Get in the car girls, we’re settling 🥴
Hunter Biden
Republicans are so scared of a barely moderately-to-the-left Joe Biden that they are willing to dismantle the constitutionally-mandated  to win, and on top of that if we lived in a country that made sense, their party would be disbanded as a punishment.
Over thirty million people protested this summer and yet the president could not fill an arena in Oklahoma. Not to dismiss the issue or anything, but I would tend to think Biden turnout will probably still be decisive.
When someone offers to save you from a burning building you take their hand. Joe Biden is the hand.
They’re just Biden time
"Didn’t Barr announce neither Obama or Biden are under investigation?"  you mean like when Comey said publicly and lied under oath that Trump wasn't under investigation??? and the entire time they were illegally spying on him 🤔
fake obstruction charges doesn't change what Obama did or the truth that's slowly getting declassified bit by bit  Barr won't announce charges against Obama and Biden until after some of the other big fish get fried anyway  today is just the tip of the iceberg  enjoy the show🤣
If Biden wins the entire investigation will be buried forever  #Hannity
If Biden is sinking...then what do you call Trump as thousands of Americans die and more go unemployed?
Where the fuck is  Thought he was going to help Biden get elected?
So much for unity on your part. This is divisive and narcissistic performative nonsense at a time when Democrats should be united behind the nominee, Joe Biden. You should be ashamed of yourself acting like a mere pedestrian on social media.
The latest   / Marist poll found Joe Biden 11 points ahead of Donald Trump:
Stop shaming people who will vote for Biden/harris. I don't want to but I know they will bend to the will of the people because their history shows it. If you don't vote then you truly are giving up and allowing people to due needlessly.  these retweets are dense.
this is a Harris-Biden team, Not a Biden-Harris team #Hannity
Yeah ask Nancy she’s a Catholic and so is Biden!
But if you don't vote then you don't get the chance to have the protests and the movement matter. Trump will never budge or change anything. But Biden/harris will have to bend to the will of the people. If history shows anything its that they do bend when it comes down to it.
Biden should not agree to debate unless a fact chk is done about every statement
If Biden was still with it I imagine he’d be pretty pissed off at whoever is writing lie after lie on his Twitter.
If Harris gets elected then I wonder if they move Biden's basement to the White House fixing to be called the Black House or move the now called Black House to Biden's basement? Just asking. lol
The USCCB said that a staffer who told the bishops’ news service she was elated that Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate spoke in a personal capacity.  The conference did not address the substance of her remarks.
Joe Biden doesn’t deserve to be President! He’s a moose knuckled tater tosser!
Ya think they had a choice? 4 more years of a lunatic or Biden!
Biden is the biggest racist on earth. Harris is the biggest fake on earth. She now thinks she is black if that gets her in power.
well, he probably didn’t pick her. The DNC picked her and then told Biden that he picked her. He knows that he can’t remember anything, so he believed them and ran with it.
So in other words they are going to censure conservative videos if they say anything about 'Baffoon' Biden or 'Lot Lizard' Harris.
Again, hope I'm wrong, but mark my words-- Biden wont be any better. In fact he'll be just as bad. And if something happens to him and Kamala becomes president? I'd expect the same fash actions as trump's regime.  I really want to be wrong : /
And Biden is somehow even less progressive than Obama. And Kamala is a fucking cop. She would rather incarcerate innocent people to let them fight fires for free than let them live their lives freely. They arent agents of change. If I am wrong Ill GLADLY eat my words.
Like Im gonna vote for biden/harris but it doesnt matter in the end, theyre still gonna bomb foreign nations most of our country will never see or be aware of, kill our own people, and subvert progress for profit. Climate change will kill us before we get anywhere
We couldn’t even hold Obama accountable, and mf’s out here pretending like we’re going to somehow hold Joe Biden to a higher standard lmao
#Tucker it is not "the Biden-Harris team", it is "the Harris-Biden team"
people like "stop badmouthing kamala and biden, we need democrats even if its just baby step changes for the better!!" lmao bitches the world wont survive any more incremental change, this is beyond the time for dramatic and massive change or we will die as a species but ok mb
Have u all noticed a lot of ads for Biden and not one for Trump on this platform? Trump got Twittergated and we know it. Indictments are coming. I believe the report is complete and getting plenty of popcorn and lots of beers. lol
Y’all bout to go vote for Biden . Him and Kamala more racist than trump 🤦🏾‍♂️
The legislature would change that and they have a veto proof majority. This was discussed at length when Warren was being considered for VP. It will be a non issue if Biden wants her in his cabinet, as it would have had she been chosen.
Yes please. Let’s vote him out. Biden has members of Sunrise on his team at the very least.
Biden wasn’t the best pick given the field of candidates. But, he’s the only alternative to Trump.
I don’t support any of these people in any way whatsoever, but, umm, I’m pretty sure Lenin, Mao, etc would be laying the groundwork for a revolution, not endorsing Biden 😂😂
You are no more aware than Biden.
Like we’re prospering now? Get the fuck outta here!!  #Biden-Harris2020
I would crawl through a prison sewer like Andy Dufresne at Shawshank to vote for Biden/Harris
Not a Biden sign.
Well I’m not going to defend Biden. Why the democrats chose an old white guy is beyond me, but even with his weaknesses he’s still several times better than this incompetent President.
Yeah but I think we are getting better. I am a little weary of them cause if do win will want conservative policies but nice helping Biden win.
Kamala Harris probably won't be a loud voice advocating for legalization, but she can reassure Joe Biden about the California experience. It's gonna be okay, Joe. Legalization works.  by  #CannabisCulture #CannabisSociety #ColoradoCannabis
Spent an hour waiting to get postcard stamps, to write postcards for Biden/Harris.  Turns out you have to order them online, and wait 7 days to get them.  I called your office, spoke to Hannah.  You need to be working, organizing protests, or fighting the Dictator.  Not tweeting.
What does she care? She’s not running for office or is she? Maybe she has been offered a seat on the Biden Harris Cabinet of Undetected or Unpunishable Crime.
Uh that parody is joe Biden saying back during busing he didn’t want his kids going to a jungle school. Look it up dummy.
Do you still trust USPS with your ballot?  #copolitics #coleg #usps #Election2020
Progressives on MSM saying they're dedicated to their principles and goals and that supporting Biden/Harris isn't really giving in. Huh #NeverBidenHarris
Few steps forward followed by miles in reverse... 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Yet you’re voting for Biden simply because he’s a democrat... please
Doing nothing and a watching it happen is just as bad as doing it. Trump is bad, but Biden is right there neck for neck
Huh? What’s that even mean? You contantly teeet about Biden, so....?
Biden would have no response. No response is the same as a bad response. Biden was missing for like 6 weeks of his campaign and you somehow think that makes a promising presidency 🤔 seriously questioning your logic
If I were Biden I would hire this dude and spray paint “New World Order” on the front...
Oo we got vocab now! Literally everything on that little list you made Biden has said he will make no change to. I don’t get where you think he will do anything better. He has said numerous times he will change nothing
I always hope so, but does it actually?   And though I hate voting for the lesser of two evils, I’m afraid to not vote for Biden becuas trump has got to go!
Say one is better (between trump and Biden) than the other makes me question your ethics. They are the same. To sit there and ask me “what would you rather have - the same shit for 4 years in red or the same shit for 8 but in blue??” Of course I’ll pick the 4 years
Corporate news works for the same donors as the ones donating to Trump.  Corporate news might be happier w/ Trump, juicier stories. Biden will be boring at best.
Biden / Harris is the Fakest ticket I have ever seen. Totally propped up by media
No. But I have at least 2 close friends, not trumplicans, who are refusing to vote for Biden. It's...insane. And I've told both of them that. 🤷‍♀️
Isn't that Biden's argument?
To EVERYONE - if you want to keep your Post Office better vote Biden
I think you and I disagree on Trump and Biden and the legitimacy of Catholic's voting for one or the other. I do appreciate you fighting against racism. Come to Denver and let's grab a beer.
Yeah and some of his takes are pretty decent (only watched like 5 or 6 vids kuz they long). Today is him saying lenin would vote for biden was a special kind of silly 😜
Biden seems to have done fine. A distinguished congressional career spanning decades. Well respected VP, both in the United States and abroad. Presidential candidate. Soon to be president. And he’s a good and decent man. Yep - Joe’s done alright... #BidenHarris2020
Beau Biden did not have to go to Iraq. He was DE Atty Gen'l. Bob Mueller is a decorated Vietnam vet. If you vote for a coward, you might as well be one yourself.
Clearly messing with mail-in-ballots is the real issue, but I Trump is also sabotaging the mail to prevent by Biden Harris T-shirt from getting here promptly.
I hate Harris so much, I'll never vote for Biden.  This week I realized Trump can win again.  I see the stupid Obama-Clinton   running the same failed campaign as in 2016.   #NeverKamala
I know republicans don’t believe in polls, for good reason, but there are strong indications that it’s gonna be a landslide win for democrats. I’d rather be Biden in the lead by 11 than Trump down by that much. You can only pull off so many miracles when you don’t believe n Jesus
Everyone except me? I ALONE!!  I watched interview clip and an interview w/ Barnet. I think the “are you a junkie?” question was a continuation of his hypothetical. But, I like Biden. You have your preference. I have mine. The original post was on trump’s lies not Biden’s brain.
The Simpsons say VOTE FOR BIDEN
Joe Biden lying again... what a shock.
It was a solid press conference, now let’s have the Biden team answer some unscripted questions
The Dems were asking people to vote woke three times in a row, and since the economy wasn't tanking anymore, in 2016 the voters could react. This time a Biden/Harris vote is only about 1/3 woke. People can handle that.
Do you remember the Obama campaigns?   You could see vast support in places beyond Twitter.   I see it now, but not for Biden.   Biden and McCain signs are 1 in the same.
Ever seen a Biden yard sign?   Yea me neither.
Look at the little CNN, MSNBC puppets...no questions for Biden or the other one.
Nixon was more liberal than Obama, and president my boss was more liberal than biden...
Defeating trump and letting Biden become President for 8 years is an equal if not greater threat because it’s more long term. I don’t get what you’re not getting
It's temporary and who's wishlist is UBI on?   During primary the Democrats HATED the idea of UBI.  The liberal media literally ignored him, called him wrong name, showed pictures of random Asian guy claiming he was Yang.  If UBI was on wishlist Yang would be nom, not Biden.
I saw a Biden 2020 thin blue line sign today in someone’s front yard.  I almost crashed my truck
I'm envisioning the ad where Republicans (many formerly of this administration) endorse Joe Biden one by one - Rex Tillerson, John Kelly, James Mattis, Colin Powell.  Can we make that happen?
Biden is the most racist person on earth. BTW where is Hunter?
In CA, OR and CO, no matter how the people vote, those states will go to Biden.
President Trump  CREATED the biggest economic expansion in history. Lowest unemployment f/all in history.  Brought manufacturing back to the USA. Trade Deals! America First!  Obama/Biden=FAILURE. Economic disaster. Foreign policy disaster.  Harris &amp; Biden: Serial LIARS.
Huh? SS has spent over 400k annually on his golf trips. Him paying himself with GVMT $ negates the "not receiving pay"  I'm not voting Biden, I can't stand the current left politicians, but I'm also not a moron that falls for Trump's BS.   Keep being a blind follower, you do you.
Joe Biden is not fit to be president..he hides in the basement and all you idiot's speak for him. You are just using his name with the help of his wife..you should be ashamed of yourself. Talking about Bo...the one thing he has left to remember and you used it.
Biden and Harris our coming for our guns while calling for refunding the police. I'm out, Trump it is.
I'm being an adult and not voting for Biden.
How am I toxic for responding to your claim?   Also, I’m not a Bernie Bro, but a registered independent.   Like most independents, I don’t like the choices, but between Biden and Trump, the choice is obvious.
Would a dog wear pants like this? (Trump) Or like this? (Biden)
Yup and Harris will take over if elected and Palosi will be VP.Biden will probably announce his retirement on Jan. lol.
What it really sounds like is you are voting for Biden, and I don't like neoliberals!
Twitter/Social Media is always toxic, however the “Biden and/or Kamala isn’t who I wanted but we HAVE TO vote for them” and the “you can’t criticize them!! they’re our only hope!” is gross
Maxine Waters says Biden 'can't go home' without Black woman as VP - Business Insider
Babbling Biden and Kumalot will remove 100,000 a day.
Biden and Harris are all about confiscating guns and lobbing the softball term "mandatory buyback". So they don't want the police to protect us and they don't want us to protect ourselves. I'm Out, #Trump2020
Senator, it's great you're working to help unemployed Coloradans but if you don't stand up to Trump's facist tyranny that's tearing down the USPS to suppress voting rights, then you're a traitor betraying all Americans. W/ Biden's lead growing in CO, it doesn't bode well for you.
Biden was VP for eight years and has spent his life in Congress. He knows the countries. He had a press release yesterday naming them and the limitations of the deal Trump "negotiated."
Seriously Biden has to dial this back or Trump will crush him and idiot libs won’t understand why.
lol when did Biden say he would be one term lololol I swear
Perhaps why they’re having so much trouble framing Biden...not your typical “liberal elite”, so the canned attacks fall flat.
Biden and Harris actually know what their doing
#thanksobama and yes Joe Biden will be the fist President to rebuild a better economy for a second after being being VP when it was done the 1st time! All trump has done is ride on Obama's coattails and try to take credit for the things Obama has already done.. trump is a loser
It's not about beating Trump, it's about UHC, jobs, housing, and peace. Biden-Harris have nothing to do any of these. The party needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.

Of course, the odds right before the election more closely reflect polling average, where the odds now factor in three months of uncertainty. Bush in 2000 squandered a bigger August lead than Biden's.
But to point out the obvious. If he does not concede, his followers will stand behind him. Many of them have guns. Most, probably. They also make up the majority of LEOs, military, secret service, etc. It could take more than just "swearing in Biden" for transfer of the office.
even the vaccines not a cure dumbass 😂 so please put your plastic bag on your head and sit the fuck down 😂 yeah.. and you think Trump is going to be out of office in November? Biden had no chance even before he chose Kumswallah Harris as his running mate 😂 now it's a
“But Kamala is a cop and Biden votes for the Crime Bill.”
I do understand that.. maybe you’re not comprehending that I’m not a trump supporter nor am I supporter of Biden because I support the people that make this country run, not just rich people. I don’t know why you care so little
When will Biden answer questions?
Tweet saved for when Biden/Harris push your shit in
All I have is a high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way. Maybe the undereducated would be more likely to vote “left” if you assholes weren’t so goddamned condescending.
Venture way -- way -- behind the BFF bonhomie between #Biden and #Obama in this excellent  trip thru their complex friendship and the affiliated fault lines.  And yeah, Alex also gets big points for "BFF bonhomie"
I have high school diploma. I’m for Biden all the way.
If the race does not start to tighten in the coming months, will the forecast start to favor Biden more? I’d like to hear Nate’s thought about that.
Awesome. 832 days till Biden's retirement party.
I love how Trump bashes Biden for not taking questions, yet Trump might take the question but not answer it.
Dude. You’re funny. Biden can barely function. Trump is the only one that can get it DONE
I would like to see a #Biden campaign ad that is just a compilation of  gutting Trump officials during hearings. #BidenHarris2020
Biden trying to take credit. Why?
Biden does not like Harris and Harris does not like Biden. It was obvious 3 days ago. He can't even operate his phone cause it was upside down. It is a disgrace and a sham show.
Trump gets tough questions from the media, Biden has not been asked one tough question yet. Biden tries to take credit for the mid east peace talks and how does that happen when he has been in the basement forever. Unbelievable. And the Dems think he can win that way.
As the article notes: "If the court agrees, that could increase the likelihood that the results of the presidential race between President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden won’t be known for days after the election."
Yes I’m going to vote for Biden/Harris because I live in a swing state. Yes I think it’s incontrovertibly true that they have used their careers to make the world a worse place and they both deserve the wall. Yes I think voting for them makes me complicit in doing evil.
I can't...had to stop watching...nothing but lies, lies and more lies...I am so frustrated...I was so happy when Biden announced Harris....I hate this motherf*cking rollercoaster ride....😟😟😟
"The Election of 1800" for    &amp; other #NeverTrump /  folks  🎵 I have never agreed with [Democrats] once We have fought on like 75 different fronts But when all is said and all is done [Biden] has beliefs; [Trump] has none 🎵
It is about my rights! Joe Biden is a civilian, just like me. He's not a policy maker, just like me. Fear mongering &amp; stepping on my toes to move his agenda is 100% about my rights. I comply with wearing a mask inside if I am going to be within 6 feet of others but not outside!
get in the same boat with the rest of us, and let's row back to shore, because we are way out in the deep end with no captain. vote for Biden/Harris because at least they aren't criminals should be their 2020 campaign tag line.
You know they won’t. Only cover for cowering Biden the fool. The media is dead and it’s just all Yellow Journalism.
And you think Biden will open pandoras box in allowing previous presidents to be imprisoned???? Every living president deserves to be in jail, including president "my boss"...
I actively voted for Sanders and contributed to his campaign. I’m passively voting for Biden.
I voted for Sanders in the primary. I’m not out here vote shaming anybody. I stated why I am choosing to vote for Biden because of the people in my family and community who are immigrants, low wage workers, and rely on social welfare. I don’t have your ideological purity
I agree. I also don’t like Biden or Harris. But I’ve never liked any presidential candidate I have voted for.
We so very much need to come together &amp; FIGHT tRump &amp; help people vote SO I HOPE WE ALL FOLLOW EACH OTHER OUT OF  SOLIDARITY TO HELP ELECT JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA HARRIS!
The spin machine will not accept that the left bashed President Trump for his brave decision to shut down travel &amp; months later agree it was a good decision. That would have been 2 more months of exposure if Hillary was at the helm and Joe Biden would not even be a consideration!
yep, saw a dude this morning arguing that “voting against the iraq war was seen as an act of treason” to justify why biden voted yes
Joe Biden was a WONDERFUL VP for President Obama! HE WILL BE A POTUS FOR ALL OF US! #BidenHarris2020
how’ve they been faring under biden and kamala?
The burden of proof lies with the one making the outlandish claim my dude. I don’t need to prove Biden is or isn’t anything. You do. And you can’t because all you have are made up conspiracy theories bred on message boards.
#Trump2020LandslideVictory  The exchange of embassies between Isreal and the UAE is a demonstration of Trumps negotiating ability.  For those that claim that he is beligerant Trump has a plan.  That plan required going against the established doctrine of BIDEN, OBAMA CLINTON.

You think that voting for Biden will level the playing field? You’re just plain wrong
Have you watched Trump speak lately? And you think Biden is the one in cognitive decline? You may want to reevaluate why you believe what you believe. Do you believe it because of evidence, or just because Trump told you too. Trump has serious cognitive issues.
Vote for Biden.  Do you still want a country worth fighting for
Need to since Biden has no energy.
Harris selection could majorly boost Biden among Latino voters, polling firm says
It’s nuts, I think it’s underappreciate how much stuff like that matters to your overall look/brand. Biden already struggles with so much else you’d think he’d have his online presence buttoned down 😅
If you live in Massachusetts vote your conscience. But please vote for Ed Markey in the democratic primary.  (Still, for immigrants, unions, and the environment Biden is demonstrably better).
Not voting for Biden/Harris because they are “insufficiently liberal” when Donald Trump is the only other option is INSANE.
Vote Biden.  It is your best chance for the healing of America.
They aren’t in terms of views but if you are telling me right now that one party is better than the other and that trump is better than biden or vice versa then you’re wrong
I don’t like either party, I think both Trump and Biden are horrible candidates to represent the United States.

Vote Biden. Get the crazy out.
Pence went on to say that he would beat Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, shouting "I'm going to beat their ..." before being led offstage by a handmaiden.
People make it sound like protest and lower class frustration will just go away if Biden is in office. If he doesn’t give us what we want why would we stop? At least he’s not going to ghost an entire country like Trump.
And at least Biden has the decency to clarify and apologize for a comment that came out wrong. Your dude just double and triples down on his racism
Vote for Biden.
Trump can win this - don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise.
The ticket that matches me ideologically: Sanders- Warren.   The most powerful potential ticket against Trump: Warren- Buttigieg.  The ticket we got: Biden- Harris.   ...K.
Vote for Biden Harris
right 🤣 Biden is ahead of Trump 🤣
It's weird right? The world is trash right now and suddenly the bots (and Trump) are pretending Biden is the incumbent to blame it all on him.
The “suburban housewife” will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge! -Donald Trump
I don’t like mandatory voting bc I don’t agree it’ll produce results that better reflect the will of the people—ppl who don’t want to vote will just troll vote or vote thoughtlessly. It’s probably not the end of the world as long as I still have the option not to vote for a Biden
I will never forget that Obama/Biden left Otto Warmbier.
Too many of us are complacent when Dems are in power. If Biden gets elected, it’s our job to hold him accountable through direct action, public art, letter writing, calling, and actual activism (as opposed to snarky memes and twitter hashtags).

We are not voting our way out of this problem. Biden will fix NONE of this - do you honestly think voting magically gives you a smooth, legal transfer of power?  You ignored every stolen election, including in 2016. It was a coup. I said it out loud then, ya’ll called me crazy.
Where were you when our rights were stripped away by the Patriot Act? (Which Biden helped write)?   Where were you when the Obama admin orchestrated brutal police violence against Occupy?  Where were you when people were brutalized at Standing Rock for a pipeline that is leaking?
Truth. I haven't been excited about Biden since he announced his run.
The Ds were told in advance about covid too, and all they did was sell their stocks. Would Biden have handled this slightly better? Probably. Would we still have 60 million unemployed and 30 million homeless? Probably.
Highly recommend y’all click the link &amp; read some good reasons why we should vote for Biden even though he &amp; Harris are not the ideal ticket. This election is your chance to help save the country &amp; also the world! (Words &amp; shirt by
I pledge allegiance. To the flag. And to vote for Joe Biden on November 3rd.  Amen.
The fact that Biden isn't +30 or more shows just how stupid our populace really is.
HEY TO ALL PATRIOTSTHAT SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION, THE 2ND AMENDMENT, THE MILITARY  AND OUR VETS, THE SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY.   JOE BIDEN AND KAMILA HARRIS  PLAN TO RAISE 1 BILLION DOLLARS FOR THEIR ELECTION THROUGH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS.   KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.

"Meanwhile on Bizarro Earth, GOP backs claim that it's Biden  who doesn't understand science."
I'm voting to get Trump out of office even if Joe Biden announces he will ban propane and propane accessories.
Those speaking of a #ClimateCrisis, don't really know what they are talking about. This includes Joe Biden, Al Gore,  etc. non-scientists. Global temperature has increased ~0.5 C over the last 40 years, and only ~0.2 C over the past 22 yrs. That's a fairly stable #climate!
Will Biden do something about the shower heads. We can’t forget the shower heads.
That’s the point. They tell us he’s a huge threat, only voting Dem will save America! While they clap sideways, tear paper, &amp; vote FOR his judges, budgets, surveillance powers, Space Force. Impeach ONLY on conspiracy against Biden. Why are they enabling the “worst threat ever!!”?
So on the short term, nothing. If we somehow win this election, do you think Biden, Pelosi, or Schumer are going to allow investigations and prosecutions, or is it going to be a 2009 “time to turn the page” redux?
This! #AngelaDavis on voting for Biden.
The healthcare expansion debate is more nuanced and incapable of tweeting about. I am just not spooked by the idea Biden is a closet leftist. Doesn’t match the reality I see. Doesn’t match how actual leftists feel about him.
That was Quick! Joe Biden Is Already Outsourcing Jobs - His Facebook Page Is Managed in the UK  via
Joe Biden Introduces Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) As Running Mate  via
I'm voting to get Trump out of office even if Joe Biden announces he will ban beef and beef by products.
I'm voting to get Trump out of office even if Joe Biden announces he will immediately ban fracking.
At this point, the entire GOP has BECOME Trump.  So if you want to restore integrity to our country, your only choice is Biden/Harris.
I'm voting to get Trump out of office even if Joe Biden invites Greta Thunberg to be a roommate in the White House.
Vote for a better undivided America.  Vote Biden
their venn diagrams are a circle, cuz that’s the point - not that obama was worse than romney, that he was the fucking same. same goes for biden/trump. you need to work on your reading comprehension
I disagree,  With  Biden has chosen to NOT alienate many former  voters. Correct, his voting block is a lock, but he needs US to push him over the edge. A #Socialist would have blocked that.
Less so than Trump's collision course with history. As I alluded to, with Biden we at least have a fighting chance to survive. Trump and republicans are an unmitigated disaster. Vote strategically, think long term. Vote your values locally where they especially count.
Biden/Harris do not have a solution. Sanders/Warren/Castro are nursing the divide in Texas, hoping O'Rourke never becomes accepted as a national figure. This is what gerry mandering and urban enclaves do. They nuture extreme positions in both parties.
Show me where in the Biden/Harris policy they mention any of the things you’re listing? They’re not there.
Yep, that's weird to me too. But Dem/Rep is some not sort of mirror-opposite pair. We the People at least have a voice with Dems. Republicans serve *only* the wealthy with "trickle down" as their solution to everything. Next POTUS will be Biden or Trump. Choose strategically.
Also worth noting Biden/Harris aren’t Sanders/Warren
I'm there.  Going to the Post Office this morning for stamps for my Biden/Harris postcards.
Biden has no idea what he is saying. If he’s not told what to say, he goes off on Grandpa Simpson-esque tirades that make no sense
As I said before, TX 3 is very much in play. We have Biden up 2 there (Trump won by 14 in ‘16 but Beto got with 3) and Van Taylor is only at 43%.
Biden/Harris 2020: Fuck cows (apparently)
I tried to imply that the people had voted him in.  People can’t be voted out, only in......and Biden isn’t getting voted in lol
wait so tr*mp literally admitted he’s trying to defund usps so ppl can’t mail in ballots and you STILL won’t vote for Biden? Smh 🤦🏼‍♀️
Fox Host Vaguely Predicts Biden Death Before Election -- "I just have this feeling that Joe Biden isn't going to be on this ticket. I have a sense that something is going to happen before the election..."
⬇️⬇️⬇️MAGA hats from China. Biden caps made in USA 🇺🇸⬇️⬇️⬇️
Maybe if Biden could win, but only by &lt; 1 mil votes so he could see how bad he sucks.
I feel bad for anyone who believes Kamala Harris will do anything to move Joe Biden on any issue----he wouldn't have picked her if that were the case..........but hey, allow yourselves to be duped again-------everyone for themselves at this point. #BidenHarris2020---a joke ticket
Stop perpetuating a total lie. He NEVER said that. Go give Biden his pudding.
This is troubling. She has the right to her opinion, but this comes across as an endorsement for Biden.  Both parties do good, both do bad. What does she think about Biden / Harris stance on abortion?
Everybody who hates the Corporate Democrats? You know, the over powerful Clintons, Obamas, Pelosi, Schumer?   This is the same attitude that got Trump into the WH 4 years ago.   I hate Harris so much, I don't care if Trump wins this time, too.  I won't vote for him or Biden.
How long before Trump goes full Putin and arrests Biden?
The Biden/Harris ticket is like an incomplete round of antibiotics. It’ll kick the immediate problem away while creating conditions for further escalation. “Anybody but Trump” won’t go very far come 2024.
Wait till he goes full Putin and arrests Biden.
Agree, lesser of two evils. But the fetus has no voice, we need to be the voice. Democrats have shown for decades that there is no budging on their pro-abortion position. Biden claiming to be Catholic yet pro-abortion? Respect human life begins with the fetus.
biden - do you mean equalize pay for women of ALL races?
My absolute favorite the other day was a friend shared a post calling out Biden and Trump and I commented about voting third party. And another friend was like “hOw Do YoU kNoW sHe’S nOt gUiLtY EiThEr” like shut the fuck up. Where’s your proof?
He is the one that is scared. Trump is terrified about Biden winning, and I am sure his deals with Putin is a big part of it
And how is that different from you saying you don’t want to vote for Biden because of what some of his supporters say to you?
My point is this: You can go ahead and vote for Biden but the blood on your hands won't make you sleep any better. I'll fight anyone of you.
I don't like it at all. Trump has no problem going left during a pandemic. He can pull it back though. Biden can't.
#Kamala and #Biden don’t want to take your guns, they want to take guns from you all!

If Donald Trump supports UBI and Medicaid until the rest of the year he will destroy Biden and his neo-con agenda.
I'm unfollowing anybody who supports Biden/Harris or Trump.
They are smarter than that Seattle will still vote Biden, might even get some people to give up houses.  Homeless group moved into a vacant house in 2010, had a for rent sign, city wouldn't allow eviction.
■Instead of sending pallets of US cash at night like Obama/Biden, this Prez shows some guts to the violent, oppressive mullahs ●US confiscates Iranian fuel from four tankers, official says  #FoxNews
Should there be a national mask mandate? Joe Biden has shown his support for this, while President Trump believes it should be up to state governments and individual people. What do you think? Vote now on our live poll 👇
Biden Team Asked Vice Presidential Finalists What They Thought Their Trump Nickname Would Be
This is one of the worst apologies yet. “... a phrase that I saw and copied from others as a sample of some people’s reactions” to Biden picking Harris.For the liberals who say “I can’t vote Biden/Harris” Please consider this document I made detailing how Trump/Pence will different from   on immigration alone.  Biden/Harris are way closer to our ideal
Biden to Sanders:
Talk about corrupt as Joe Biden and of course his running mate
Rebuttals:  1. Harris and Biden have repeatedly shown that they are pro-police and are unwilling to enact meaningful reform (example: thousands of people Harris had arrested for Marijuana related crimes and Biden’s “shoot them in the legs instead” statements regarding protestors
Are you suggesting that Biden wasn't referring to us all sleeping and showering with masks on?
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks    How do you spell mask ⁦ ?
I thought you were 100 % against Biden
You should run against Biden
Kamala hated Biden not too long ago
This is my own fault for not reading this fully until now, but I really do endorse this plan. More progressive than I gave it credit. ⁦  #BidenHarris2020   The Biden Plan for Securing Our Values as a Nation of Immigrants –
Ummm..you do realize Biden doesn’t write his tweets..right?
Everybody together, NOW!  Biden-Harris, yes!!!
Sounds like to 2016 Joe Biden is the worst candidate even worse than Hillary Clinton
Susan Rice hints at possible Biden administration role while touting Harris pick    Liar (A) supporting of Liar (B) 🤣
Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election  #FoxBusiness What do you might??!! It will definitely cost him!!
Trump says 'suburban housewife' will vote for him over Biden, cites low-income housing policies   Did ⁦ ask ⁦ first before he made this decision?? ⁦
Please stop!  This is Trumps America right now and you are not doing your job.  Unrest can’t work, can’t travel can’t even hug my parents. This is not a TV show this is people’s lives and you have not done your job. Vote Joe Biden and 1st woman VP Kamala Harris.
Is this all you can come up with. VOTE Joe Biden.
A vote for anyone but Biden/Harris is a vote for Trump/Pence. Period. You don't have to vote for Biden... but you should know if you do not you are voting for Trump. Work to reform the system in 86 days... for 2020 the math doesn't work any other way.
Nah I think about that all the time. Imagine a UHC system where you don’t have to worry about that. I get about thinking about now. I’ll be honest I just don’t trust Biden that he’ll do the right thing. He’s taking a lot of money from the insurance companies
If  is not AG or a Supreme Court Justice (provided a Biden win), then something is wrong. 😒
Biden's going to need a food tester, isn't he?
Congratulations, Ms Harris!!! You have my vote!! Biden has my vote but you made it all the better!!!! Biden/Harris 2020!!!!!!!
Sealed the deal for a giant loss. Wow Joe you are confused.  Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate, setting aside tensions from primary
Excited to vote for Biden/Harris 2020
Here we go! #VoteBlue2020 #BidenHarris2020
If anyone says Biden’s lost their vote because of the choice, then we deserve a Trump dictatorship. 🤮 This is an important pick, but getting rid of 45 is more important than anyone’s feelings. Country or personal preference? It’s that simple.
This is the only VP tweet I’m liking today. Hope Biden waits until at least tomorrow to announce.
It's called comedy! I find both skits about Trump and Biden very funny! Being that your father was my inspiration for becoming a comic, lighten up! It's what comedy is all about!
But he says they’re all his buddies! They get along great. Private calls with Putin and no need to reveal the discussions? They’re coordinating dirt on Biden. He asked the Ukraine as well. Believe what you investigate not what you hear or see on TV.
More for a Biden loss, but his take surprised me a bit too.
Bullshit Obama and Joe Biden almost ran Social Security still was broke
Black male leaders warn Biden ‘will lose’ election if he doesn't name Black female running mate   ⁦ is going to lose the election if he runs with a chimpanzee!
Since when is God pro-guns? Asking for a friend. #DemocratsArePatrioticToo #GodTalk
CNN’s Brian Stelter called out over 'tone-deaf' criticism of conservative media for questioning Joe Biden’s mental health   ⁦ is a pathetic moron!
Hillary Clinton says Biden needs to consider three things when choosing a VP    Not #CrookedHillary (⁦ on the other hand, it might be good, after all you know how to lose. ⁦ 45🇺🇸
The Republicans during the last election basically said having character is not a prerequisite for President. Remember “grab’em by the p___y” and making fun of the handicap gentlemen? So why do they now keep throwing up Biden character issues? Like that’s ever mattered to them.
“Entire media companies essentially exist just to tear down Joe Biden, is there an equivalent on the left, tearing down Trump?” I don’t know how you kept a straight face when you said that. CNN is the 24/7 bash Trump fake news outlet king of them all. You lying hypocrite.
There’s no comparison Trump is so much smarter and so much more together and he made America great and he’s gonna make America great even better now let’s see what Joel Biden have done for 40 years besides become very rich
It shows you know nothing about Social Security Obama and Biden took money out of Social Security and Medicare to pay for Obamacare
That’s a lie they got their special interest open borders abortion free make up for illegals love with Biden 40 years besides become very wealthyOn the American people
If Joe Biden gets in there he’s gonna raise taxes on every American so he can feel his own pocket like he’s been doing for 40 years vote for Biden is voting for socialism communismAnd I’ll open borders destroy the country
Voting for Biden isn’t even a vote for Biden.  He is the billboard, not the messenger.
You are a ignorant as they come.  Go ahead vote for Biden, the dementia candidate.
Biden is a sick, demented old person. TRUMP2020 is coming. Get your hankie ready.
Biden can't even tie his shoes alone anymore.   TRUMP2020 TRUMP2020 TRUMP2020 TRUMP2020
Maxine Waters: Biden ‘can’t go home without a Black woman being VP’    Because Maxine Waters said so?
Why are Biden's gaffs held to a real presidential standard and Trump's gaffs ignored /memed /excused / laughed at? Says a lot about who we think is actually presidential/
No way Biden wins in a fair election.  If Biden wins then the elites have successfully taken over elections and power.  You’ll never see a GOP President or Congress again and the USA as founded is finished.
So tell me one thing that Joe Biden has done in 40 years besides getting rich off America
I'm already voting for Biden, but it is things like this that solidify that for me.
“Unlike the African American community, the Latino community is very diverse.”   -Joe Biden
Which reporters are now having to look into Biden’s ability to hurt #God? Heaven historically takes forever with FOIA requests.
I saw an ad for Joe Biden and was all like, What's Joe the nickname for? Joe-ithy? I need to go to bed...🥴
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity   Idiot!

White supremacy looks like the president’s allies helping Kanye get on the ballot to get black people to vote for him instead of Biden.  White people using black people to control black people for the benefit of white people.
Last night I listened to a Democrat Congressman brag about Biden and I just don’t understand how anyone in their right mind  would have the slightest inkling for supporting this idiot
