Trump again threatens executive orders to extend benefits after stimulus talks fall apart
It's unclear how the president might be able to do those things unilaterally, particularly extending expanded unemployment benefits. And the president did not specify at what amount the expanded benefits would continue.
Good Call, Classic Narcissist. But he's also a Sociopath, he doesn't care at all about the 160,000 Trump allowed to die by reckless ignorance.  Shows no empathy for the families, and the millions of sick. This man is unfit for Presidency. Heck, he's unfit to be  a Human Being.

Teacher’s viral essay shows how Trump’s COVID-19 failures are turning Republicans away from party
And in a related story, 160,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus thanks to Donald Trump’ gross negligence and incompetence.
I also realized that most of trump’s supporters to do not follow him on Twitter. This makes a lot of sense to me. It is impossible for a sane person to follow him and still think he is fit to be president. Same for Biden.
Gov. John Bel Edwards has issued a letter to President Trump asking that the federal government help the state keep the Louisiana National Guard (LANG) active in the COVID-19 crisis at 100 percent funding instead of 75 percent.
Ummmm....Trump raped teenagers on Epstein's Island so.......
Don’t you know the old saying? The one that never existed before but Trump would swear he’s been using it for months, years, decades even! “You’re either an Anti-Semite or a Yo-Semite.”
There are plenty of us who don’t feel abortion is an answer. Lots of Republicans say they are against the practice but have been caught paying for daughters, girlfriends or mistresses abortions. If you like I can pull the list starting with the ones in the Trump administration.
I am not even as high on Trump as I used to be, but I call it like I see it. I think we need to involve a third candidate (or fourth?) in the national presidential debates. Why are the democrats and republicans so scared to allow this?
If Trump has a press conference, and his only word is “Up.”, Biden will say, “If I’m elected president, down.” because his whole platform is getting Trump out of office.
It seems to me that the left doesn’t want to win this, or they are trying to force their real pick through. Biden’s platform is “We need to get Trump out of office.” There were many better candidates than Biden available but the left got their guy 🤷🏻‍♂️

This is commonsense if you are paying attention.   If satan himself came and impregnated their daughter and revealed himself as trump they'd still vote for him.  They won't wear a mask because it's their body, their right to choose..  But!   You know the rest.
Trump doesn’t care for Hispanics. Perhaps you’ve heard of the locked up sick and dying children in your area?
Speaking of learning, have you ever studied political history?. I would hazard a guess that you have not, much like the other &gt;30% of trump followers. And of that percentage, many are too stupid to vote.

Trump was talking about banning tiktok because China made it and they was using it to get information out of our phones when you have it on ya phone. I think Microsoft bought it so now it won’t be banned
Wanna know what's weirder than that mushroom cloud, Fox news is the only one talking about it rn... It was on MSNBC for a min, but CNN, and MSNBC are on to Trump and Isaias.
Oh, we know you'd be covering it if Joe said it.  By the way, how many articles have you written about Ivanka and others' use of private email for gov't business?  How many about Trump's health?

The first thing that came to Trump’s mind when asked about John Lewis, a civil rights leader, was “he never came to my inauguration.” Y’all this man is a cartoonish supervillain. Cmon.

Postal union leader warns Trump assault on USPS and mail-in voting puts nation on ‘dangerous path toward dictatorship’
Trump broke Bill and the weekly standard
#TRUMP 2020: They are dying. That’s true. And it is what it is!!!  #ItIsWhatItIs
I bet trump won’t even say happy birthday to Obama that man don’t like us
I'm pretty sure the real reason Trump hates TikTok is because he found out his assistant could not print out videos and expect them to move.
Trump tactics/he’s not president material
It's simple really.  Open up the economy.  Get out of the way of the private citizen.  If you'd minimize government interference in our lives, we'll take care of the rest.  It's what we hired YOU...and TRUMP...to do.  Drain the damn swamp and let America grow!
Swan: "Look at S. Korea for example. 51M population, 300 deaths." Trump: "You don't know that." S: "I do." T: "You don't know that." S: "You think they're faking their statistics?" T: "Uhhhh...I won't get into that because I have a very good relationship..."  301 deaths.
Trump refers to the rising U.S. death toll as “it is what it is”. He used the same phrase with Chris Wallace. 150,000 dead. “It is what it is.” A line that would be career-ending for any other elected politician. And he’s said it twice.
They vanish like that immigrant caravan in South America that Trump played up, only to disappear after the last elections ?
Okay, first, list how the US has been destroyed by Trump and Oence? And please, don’t say ignorant things like the virus and division. We all have seen that came from the Chinese, Obama/Biden and the left wing of the democrats.

Neuroscientist explains why Christian evangelicals are wired to believe Donald Trump's lies | Being taught to suppress critical thinking begins at a very early age. It is the combination of the brain's vulnerability to believing unsupported facts
This is how liberals have won for years. Not allowed to counter them at dinner parties because its civil. Thats just how they manipulate us! They never give us the same courtesy??!!! Which is why Trump is here!
Exactly. Trump knows a lot about quantum physics. People don’t know that. But he does. He’s actually a very stable genius, except when he is observed.

Tucker, you, and your useless, lying, President Trump. . Continue to try to fool the Great People of America. It's no longer working.

I blocked him. I don't need to hear from another Trump sycophant. I say his opinion is poorly educated, and probably shouldn't have left his head.
Your 24/7/365 obsession with trying to “get” President Trump is beyond sad at this point. Your anti-Trump tweets fall flat 24/7/365.
Unpopular opinion :  Over the next four years, Donald trump could be talked into giving us Medicare for all before Joe Biden could.   Imagine if we could've had a president to give us Medicare for all while also being sane. Wouldn't that have been nice?
And the same case can be made that trump is the best president and that the South didn't fight the civil war over slavery.  All three would be garbage cases.  It's time for you to stop tweeting...
I too have cursed out PACs and Trump Team for using #BigTech censorship to raise money, while nothing is done about it. I'm no anti-Trumper, but as of now, I abstain from voting in Nov. I will not wear a 😷or 🤿 to vote, and I wont 📫my vote either.
Except authoritarian Orban, populists generally chose libertarian response, advocacy for absolute “freedom” against “statism.” Trump, GOP govs opted for few restrictions on movement &amp; assembly, while fomenting opposition to “fake scientists” and Dem govs.
They only listen to Big Brother #MSM  But the funny part is that #Leftists who have spent 4 years screaming unfounded accusations that #Trump2020 is racist  Are reduced to whining that Biden isn’t any more racist than Trump

Donald Trump and Kanye West reminds you of the slave and a slave master. Kim and you’re children you are going to be effected by your husband. Uncle Tom Kanye will never live this down. Think about that and get ready for it. Uncle Tom Kanye is a trader to black people

I’m tired of the negative, worried about coronavirus and politics it’s to much.  I just wish Donald Trump and his Racists would just go away and take Judas with him. You know that fake as Kenya west pretending to be a billionaire fake niger. I feel sorry for kim and her children.
Got to do what you been doing.... FIGURING IT OUT. They ain’t NVR made that much $ before 😂 they was acting too different, Trump caught on.
1- we here on the left understand that it's inappropriate to assign someone else their orientation, however, the same Trump supporters and cowards that have the flag in your pfp don't feel that way. 2- this literally sounds like something a closeted homosexual would say.
Because no one, not even Lincoln has done more for POC than Donald Trump.
I can answer this - hell yes we are. 3 family or friends loss to C19 allegedly. 94 yr old aunt died in her sleep. WAS NOT SICK BUT NURSING HOME DOCTOR LISTED COD AS C-19 RELATED - A TOTAL LIE.  The other 2 were over 75 yrs old.  The other sad thing Trump lost 3 votes

Kudlow is a weasel who’s helping distract from his boss’s utter failures including wrecking the economy by not rationally dealing with the virus that put 25 million people out of work in the first place because of Trump’s incompetence.
This Trump supporter was killed for his love for Donald Trump but Trump didn't acknowledge it..
These are just a few examples of him refusing to urge people to wear a mask after the experts changed the guidelines

Fox &amp; Trump truly have u ppl brainwashed. Good bye
My eyes r wide open. Biden is no savior, saint or deliverer. He’s made mistakes. But he’s not riding in like evangelicals praised Trump like he’s the 2nd coming. And Trump stood there &amp; said “I alone can fix it”. After he said he doesn’t ask for forgiveness (he doesn’t need God)
One thing for sure. No one knows how Biden will govern. But we all know how Trump has. And America is worst off today than it was 3.5 yrs ago. Good bye
Well I was never a democrat.. but I’m definitely voting for trump..
Then you are due for glasses. B/c you are a blind cult member of the Trump cult. And ppl like u are the reason God’s protective hand has been removed from the US
I’d be thrilled if they just stepped down and slunk away in tne dark, but don’t hold your breath. So much for the Constitution and their oaths of office. Hail Putin, Heil Trump seems to be their motto. And from the rest of the GOP? Crickets. Spineless when the country needs
Trump is NOT &amp; never has been a Republican. No everyone does not have a handle on it. But the leader of the riches, most powerful country w/ the best dr &amp; facilities is leading the world in deaths &amp; infection rates.
..u are right this conversation is meaningless if u cannot see the damage Trump has caused this country in economic terms, spiritually, race relations, health &amp; safety &amp; our international standings. Good bye
Let me respond before you block me again lol, Trump is a supporter of the Confederacy that's by it self disqualified him to be president. Trump never denounce KKK leader David Duke why? I tell you why, because he's a racist himself.
BREAKING NEWS: Donald Trump to sign executive order mandating that all NBA rims must be 10ft above the court.
The problem I see with all this stuff is that it is feeding red meat to trump and his ilk. And will also cause issues with some independents and moderates who aren't full on protesters.
Still not as weird as Trump v Biden
Per ODNI and others, that’s not correct either. China and Iran are inclined to have Biden win. Russia is against Biden and prefer Trump. Of course all of this is way more nuanced than described but claims of bribery require proof. If you have it, I’m interested.
I read a news article in a which a Catholic bishop praised Trump for parting with the WHO because they are pro-abortion
Trump is utterly without shame or a scintilla of empathy.
Things in general could always be worse, I suppose, but what president is worse than Donald Trump and why exactly?
Trump warned you they're trying to steal the election

Name the policies tRump put forth to achieve this numbers you are quoting.
Please tell me what policies tRump put forward for black unemployment to be at record low. Because President Obama got black unemployment down to 7% for 16% so please tell me.
The trivial bullshyt yall cancel from day to day is why you only have #Joebiden as an alternative to #Trump while the #gop runs rainman #Kanye.
When I see these kids in the Trump crowd I think of this haunting photo from 1990 by Cheryl Gerber.
"Bothsidesism" =  Both sides are equally effed up so why bother.  This is a classic right wing/fascist propaganda tactic which would ultimately benefit Trump.  Don't fall for this bullshit. The goal is to get Trump outta office so we can work on repairing our country.

Right on President Trump
He went on to say that Trump needs to start talking more about how great the economy was doing before the pandemic and that he’s made some terrific judicial appointments.
Macho manly patriots courageously following in the footsteps of Patrick Henry and Daniel Boone by fighting the tyranny of the so called “scientists” who are plotting to make Trump look bad! 😂

Do stop getting our hopes up! 💔
This really sums it up for me lately. Part of me doesn’t want to give up, but the heady combination of daddy/overlord/messiah/authoritarian complex coupled with Fox/trump and his Rallies...it’s too much for the undereducated &amp; ignorant. 🤷🏻‍♀️
TRUMP NOW SUPPORTS OBAMACARE  PASS IT ON
Thats some of your black lives coming off the plantation and going on to support Trump !
Only the best people!  Jewish advocacy groups slam Trump's pick for German ambassador for bigoted comments
I mean if trump does this I will be very surprised but I would give him props
Thoughts?  Anything yet on #ObamaGate, the 3 year fake "Russia Trump collusion" implosion, Biden's role &amp; the media's refusal to talk about any of it?  Are you ever gong to interview  about the continued persecution of Gen. Flynn?
"The orders include extending enhanced unemployment benefits and the federal eviction moratorium, imposing a payroll tax holiday and further suspending federal student loan payments."  I'll believe it when I see it.
Maybe someone coughed on Trump.
If he does that, he hands Michigan to Trump.
And Trump's at a fucking country club, laughing with people that don't have masks and somehow still not getting the goddamn virus.
They not even sure if trump can extend it he just talking lol
I predict Trump will sign an EO for Obamacare, that already exists, while trying to stop it through the courts...
I listened to two today. Both said ANTIFA is everywhere &amp; Dems were socialist. Forget that trump gave billions to Wall St &amp; farmers. Forget tht RW white supremacist groups have killed 100s since 9/11. Incl cops. It’s crazy.
THE LEFT WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO MAKE TRUMP LOOK BAD.   THE LEFT IS PROBABLY HOPING CHILDREN GET SICK AND DIE FROM A VIRUS OR EVEN WORSE A SCHOOL SHOOTING.   WE KNOW THAT OUR LIVES DON'T MATTER TO THEM.
Wrong! Regular dose is 200mg and they gave veterans 2400 mg they tried and succeeded in killing our veterans to say Trump is wrong, it doesn't work and even hastens death! Yall are the liars/killers
THE LEFT WILL DO ANYTHING (LIE, CHEAT, AND STEAL)TO STOP PRESIDENT TRUMP.  POTUS IS A THREAT TO THE  CHINA REGIME, AND THEY'LL STOP AT NOTHING TO RIG OUR ELECTIONS. THE LEFT IS IN BED WITH CHINA AND SO IS CREEPY JOE.

I think the kkk should say they are supporting Biden to get trump votes 🤣
Trump is the man bay! Can’t wait till he wins so we can watch everyone leave as we waive bye!
You mean the pre-existing conditions that were ALREADY COVERED THANKS TO OBAMACARE? Until Trump and the GOP sabotaged it?!
if there’s one thing trump supporters do, it’s give me a good laugh over their blatant ignorance 😅
Trump is a racist white supremacist and Biden is a racist white supremacist.. that’s it.. that’s the tweet
11/4/20 Coverage for pre-existing conditions will be gone.. Trump really wants to be Obama. He’s like a psycho killer with an obsession... steals from  hoping some Obama magic will rub off on him. Will never forget  stole  speech
If Trump wins - or steals - the election we will all be in a Yoo-Barr movie.
Does not matter what Trump does it will not work.  So let’s prepare for Armageddon
President Trump is the bomb💥Gotta love the guy!
The thing that dems and media has hated about trump is that he tells the truth calls and calls them out. The Democratic Party has never dealt with a president who publicly calls them out for there bs. I was raised as a Democrat but thank god my eyes were opened years ago.
And you call yourself a newsman? That was Trump being Trump! After all it is what it is!
We already have enough Nazis with Donald Trump.
And Trump has now taken over the post office and fired over 14 people to slow down the mail for the election

Russia had their hands all in the 2016 election and just know their going to have it in this one as well all in favor of Trump because he’s their puppet
it's about time! I wonder if Trump will announce at his next rally that Falwell has "hurt God."
It has come out that Pompeo knew Russia was paying for American soldiers to be killed. He didn’t want to face trumps fury so he did not want Trump to know about it. Evidently it really was true 🤬 and Trump is good for America? 1/

Trump will be re elected and I can wait for all y’all to move away! Oh and rub it all in your faces it’s gonna feel soooooo good. Yalls hope is a 50 year politician who can’t come out and face the real world that keeps making racist statements lol. Left wing Joe
Are you his stenographer? That very protection is covered in the ACA. Trump/Barr are in court *now* to remove it! Do better.
Like, I'm not advocating it.  But I'm hella surprised someone whose spouse or kid has died because of Trump's refusal to address #Covid19 hasn't tried to take matters into their own hands.
"If election results are not settled by January 20, Donald Trump would have to vacate the office until a winner was declared.IF Democrats hold the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) would be elevated to president until the election results were finalized."
Forget the oaths they swore to protect and defend the Constitution. They have sold their Senate majority out to Putin to save their own skins because they know when Trump goes down they are all going with him.
Trump’s faking popular achievements because he’s so far behind in the polls. Fake accomplishment. Fake president.
Seriously?! This was what President Obama did under the ACA, which Trump/Barr are currently suing to have removed!
I’m pretty sure Trump can no sooner “swoop” than he can tie his own shoes.
Thanks, Obama! Meanwhile,Trump &amp; Barr are in Court *now* to take away that coverage. You can’t make it up!
Didn’t God say “Love thy neighbors” but we all know Trump ain’t too happy with our neighbors down South, Mexico😑
I still don't understand the inability for anybody to make any of this matter.  Past politicians have been ousted for comments like this, and Trump does it every day.
Republicans are cooperating with a Russian propaganda campaign. Traitors.
Note how Elizabeth is reporting this like Trump is sane, rational and logical.
Trump owned you again. #reallyBadFakeNewsCNN #EnemyOfThePeople

True, Pels aren't playing Zion.  But Wizards aren't playing Beal, Wall, or Bertans, and are up 7 early in Q1....  But did you know Trump and his cohorts are leading a kleptocracy that is robbing America? #NBA
Russia contacted him. He didn't reach out to Russia. And he turned them down. Nothing there. But keep trying. At your age, you'll be dead before they find anything on Trump.
So, the Senate Republicans refused to act so Trump can come in and pretend to be the hero? I’m so fucking done with these people. Please let karma rain.
Listening to  lifting up the positions of  and remembering all the times he has skewered hip hop. Saying the left now attacks him because he supports Trump conveniently forgetting his own positions.
It's not about trumpeting Trump.   It's about banning Biden from heading the highest office in the land.   The fact that the president is an infinitely better choice is simply icing on the Red, White and Blue cake.

I’m watching Trump on the news he extended unemployment to the end of the year for y’all...
The last person any other world leader wants to see in office after this coming election is Trump.  He is the exact opposite of a pushover
Um that’s already the law.   Wait. So Trump wants the courts to rule that protections for Pre Existing conditions under Obamacare is unconstitutional so that Trump can then issue an executive order protecting pre existing conditions????   Wow.
Kanye West Admits His Fake Campaign Is A Ploy To Help Donald Trump Win  via
Is this “winning” as Trump famously says? Idk, and I don’t care. What I do care about is that it reminds people that you don’t have to let them win, and for all the noise they make, they don’t speak for many, and the world will not end if you refuse to kneel.
An example of why Trump resonates with people is his continued use of the term “China virus”. All other GOP pols would have long since buckled, and adopted the PC language that inevitably furthers the left’s narrative.
My 4 and 5 year old nephews have a larger vocabulary than Donald Trump. Literally. Watching him speak is so annoying.
Ummm...Trump has yet to say a harsh word against Putin. I wonder why?
What if Trump is pronouncing stuff just as the speech writer is writing it?
Did you know Ebola has been around for 44 years? It also has been mainly confined to a few countries in Africa with deaths between a few dozen &amp; a couple hundred during outbreaks.  There have been outbreaks in 2018 &amp; 2020 &amp; it has not spread here while Trump has been president.
Trump did away with taxes?
These "briefings" are nakedly Trump campaign events, where he downplays the virus, tells us how great he's done, and how great Republican states have done. Waiting for the shepherd's crook to emerge and pull him off, cause this must be the gong show and not reality.
Trump supporters love comparing BLM to the Nazi's. Stupid just like the man they voted into office
The biggest mistake we made was saying masks help other people. Not a joke, not an exaggeration. Trump cultists and most other Republicans will make it their goal to destroy whatever you asked them to help with because they’re selfish children.
President Trump is extending the unemployment, rent, student loans and a federal payroll tax holiday for ALL workers retroactively starting July 1st through end of year! He got sick of the bickering and is doing it himself through the end of the year😳 #TrueLeader HE’s DONE!!!
Yesterday was him sounding the alarm that we need to be ready as a militia of we the people. If they remove trump, we have to take down the deep staters responsible ourselves.

who ever voted for donald trump see me.
Texas Lt. Governor thanks the “olds” for their sacrifice. They gave their lives to protect Donald Trump’s presidency but it didn’t work. Sorry.
He has the credentials to be a top Trump advisor.
Trump's policies put 35 million people out of work, killed 150,000 Americans and shrunk the GDP by 33%. Supporting him is dangerous, foolish, and frankly criminal.
Joe Biden isn’t great for the black vote . Joe Biden also isn’t a sociopath like Trump . If you don’t stop a sociopath in their reign, they will ruin what’s in their path.  Trump is a sociopath
I have always been a little miserable most of the time. I am at a new level of misery with Trump. I will be happy to go back to normal miserable. Just Biden my time till he is gone.
Voting for a third party is voting for Trump with this.  And the country will suffer .
Please the GOP is stalling so Trump can swoop in and save the day and look the hero. Re-Election Stunt. I am not buying it for a second. Just Biden my time.
#KanyeWest proving he lies as much as Trump and just as insane. Interfering with an election in this manner should be a criminal offense
Biden spreading lies! You and Obama’s presidency has no room to talk about anyone’s cause it sucked. Joe you have had 50 years and done nothing if you ask America they are voting for you not cause of any accomplishment it’s cause they hate trump
I don’t know many falling for that. But I don’t think we can get any worse than trump
#Dems a week back: Trump is opening schools. He is going to kill our children.  Chuck Schumer today: We have to open schools to save our economy.  👏👏👏
Remember, there was also a time where people thought it was a conspiracy theory that the govt illegally spied on the Trump campaign, and that Russia collusion was a hoax. Both turned out to be true. Keep that in mind when things start happening.
The president like most has not tried to veto a veto proof majority so it is hard to give him credit for it. If that were the case he gets credit for the Russian sanctions we know he does not like. 2/2

So, basically, Trump throwing a bitch fit because Pelosi wants to keep police, firemen and public servants on the payroll in cities/states that desperately need the money, which will result in Trump grossly underfunding any initiative by BILLIONS.   Got it.
I am a Christian and when I think of Jesus and Trump I just want to 🤮. Imagine the thousands who follow him who claim to be Christians. They spew hatred and cause division. How could this have happened in America? You’d think people would have learned after the Jim Jones cult.

That’s the problem. It’s never the right time. We always have to wait wait wait.. we should be tired of waiting for change. And Biden or Trump being president doesn’t fix our structural problems as black people. It’s a distraction
You know trump just signs the bills right ? Elected politicians need to be held accountable as well. If he signs a bill it’s because our checks and balances allowed him too.   But again. I think this a convo we can unpack in person
Trump made all kinds of promises to lower drug prices in 2016. Then he had a private meeting with leading pharmaceutical manufacturers and it was a dead issue until now — when he’s running again.
Let me clarify something, you should not worship anything that isn’t God. I do not worship Donald Trump, I believe in him. No Donald Trump isn’t our savior.... God is. Donald Trump has a mission from God to save our nation from devil worshipping pedos. Pls pray for 45🙏🏼
Dems haven't been willing to negotiate from day one. You haven't figured that out yet? They're trying to force laws through without passing them by putting them in a bill they think Trump has to sign. Like, no stimulus checks unless vote-by-mail is in the package? WTF?
Did Trump really shut y’all down? I’m asking for my daughter.
Donald Trump is a snake oil salesman and he always has been.
Instead of China. Great move by President Trump.
Thank you mr President Trump.  We stand behind you 100%.   Always!!!!
In defense... What is the difference between trump and Biden... Both racist... Both extreme threat to black people... Why choose any of them....
INDEED YOU'RE CORRECT AD1  The really sad thing about that is with the exception of perhaps 6 White women wh I've seen expressed regret for voting for Trump, most are remainng silent.  They're speaking out would do a lot to encourage others to stop drinking Trump's Kool Aid.

Why the NY AG couldn't have waited until after the election is beyond me. It's almost as if she's working for Trump. She just handed most Republicans a reason to swallow that little bit of vomit in their mouths and vote for him.
Joe Biden can say any inane thing his pea brain can come up with and the Democrats/MSM will carry water for him! Wish President Trump had some water carriers but alas Republicans just aren’t up for it!

Lies lies Joe you have not done anything good in 50 years and all your promises are the same that Democrats promise every election and it never changes now trump has made the most changes and the dude has only been in government 3 1/2 years that’s truth
Trump needs to pic the top 3 constitutional lawyers in Congress, and figure out a challenge proof way to get a temporary extension out there so people aren’t kicked out of their homes.
Electoral college is proportional to the Senate and House. If they were fixing the congressional, it would be just as easy to fix the Presidential at the same time. One way to ensure a deep investigation into election fraud is to have Trump win overall while losing congressional.

Biden shouldn't debate period and only if Trump releases his tax returns
Yep. They centered their entire personality and identity around a politician (gee, where have we seen that before?) so they cant handle that Biden won out, and so he's enemy #1. It doesnt matter what Trump does, because Biden is "literally the same and will do the same stuff".
Biden stop spreading your lies. Trump is the first president that has been fair across the board and this is from the middle class. You and Obama did nothing but made my life more expensive because of your Obamacare policy.

Trump owes billions. He's a negative billionaire.
It's all bullshit dude. We have already had Clinton under oath. She was investigated and cleared by 3 republican lead Congressional investigations. All before the 2016 election. It was bullshit then and still is. Trump hasn't asked for another investigation because it was all BS.

Here's the thing, if there's evidence these powers are trying to help Trump--like they did last time--then the people NEED that information.  We might want to ask why enemies of the state would support a candidate.
Pull up in a Obama coupe and the inside trump
The problem from the beginning is trump has been held to very low expectations.The media has enjoyed the ratings of trump and have helped in his rise while still the expectations are to a lower standard.
Remember the George Floyd death &amp; trump said George would be proud of the unemployment numbers that came out that day. His niece said that he’d the N word on a regular basis.  He was sued for discrimination, was he not? That’s not including his comments on “shithole” countries.

Nope. My dad is a die hard Trump supporter. I haven’t spoken to him since I found out. My mom doesn’t sway any particular way. My brother is more on the conservative side.   I’m pretty sure I’m the black sheep of the family. Lol
Seems the goal of the Trump team in hilighting these is to make it seem Biden isn’t really on the side of Black Americans. No way they vote for trump in large numbers, but maybe they don’t turn out. You are in trouble if this is your election strategy.
I know, right?? I muted the word Trump.  Though at times my morbid curiosity makes me unmute it... it’s like a train wreck. Can’t look away.
After all the economic destruction Trump has caused she still thinks he‘s a good CEO? was this recent? Even my dad used to think having a “businessman” as president would be good for the country. He admitted he was wrong pretty quick!

When did Trump ever grow up in another culture and live for sustainable periods in other countries? He grew up rich in New York.

Cool, perhaps you'd like to link to some videos of English speakers (other than trump) pronouncing it that way to further illustrate your point
Not voting is a vote for Trump which is why the GOP has historically fought to suppress people’s right to vote. Biden could select Barney the dinosaur as his VP and I’d still vote for him over 4 more years of Trump destroying America.
Trump is billions in debt, needed help writing his SAT and was let into Wharton as a favor, where he was the worst student the professor ever had. He eats from a fried chicken bucket, slathers tanner on his face with a spatula, and travels to florida to golf. He’s #OrangeTrash

Trump/Republicans deliberately hurting Americans by slowing down the postal service just to appease Trump, make the postal service seem like a failure and to hurt mail in votes.   Republicans are truly traitors to America.
Why or how you've gotten brainwashed into thinking that Trump is intelligent is baffling. You seem like an intelligent guy, Dinesh, you can be better than this.
This post says way more about you than it does Trump.  None of it good.
Neither does Trump.
Sadly Trump misspeak so many time that it’s not even news anymore.
Which Trump hasn't done, so what the fuck is your actual point?
And you are? I still haven’t got my Trump bucks lah brudda .
He only mentioned HBCUs in 1 campaign event (Charlotte, October 2016). Omarosa really got HBCUs on the agenda- then he fired her. Trump had no choice to sign bill- it was veto proof. None of his 8 vetos have been against veto proof majorities. He also never publicly endorsed it.
Did  say anything? Matter of fact, the last time Trump was at church, he gassed peaceful protesters to pose with an upside down Bible. He didn't even go in!
SHOULD TRUMP REMAIN IN OFFICE  White Americans will be the big loosers.  Blacks and other peoples of color are already at the lowest economic rung.  When you are already on your back, you can't go much lower. Whites Americans are losing wealth even as these words are being typed.

Fair enough. I’ll vote for who i want for president since I’m there. I’ll write in a vote. Still not voting for Trump or Biden.
I love how you framed this action as if it was acted in good faith by this administration. To Trump this is a business move to protect Americans tech companies, and score some geopolitical points.
This just in.  Compelling evidence has been discovered that President Trump is colluding with intelligent Americans to win the presidency in November, 2020.

If there is a debate - which I really doubt - Trump’s unfitness will be revealed. He may become completely unhinged &amp; violent or implode &amp; crumble. I don’t believe Trump will show
Joe desperately wanting to work for the sinking ship that is the Trump campaign.   Btw, you only take the DEMENTIA TEST IF PEOPLE AROUND YOU THINK YOU SUFFER FROM IT.   Each time Trump or his toadies point out that Biden hasn’t needed to take it, just magnify why Trump did.
Trump exceeds his constitutional authority, and House Dems weren’t willing to approach the limits of theirs in holding him accountable. That kind of asymmetry will allow this to happen regardless of any law.

Help me with your understanding of what intentional actions Trump took to "enrich" HBCUs.
We are inundated w/ news of 45’s failures &amp; verbal “gaffes” everyday. Why don’t you tell us what you are going to do if elected? Most people aren’t going to read lengthy plans on your website. Tell it to us like you tell us Trump’s errors.

Lol. No. Nice try though. Trump is not playing any form of chess and his inability to walk down a ramp or drink a glass of water was not intentional.   His father had Alzheimers. The disease is hereditary. This is why he was given tests for it btw. Not saying he has it...yet

Trump doesn't believe the experts. Saving lives does not interest him. The virus is a drag. Life must return to normal now for the sake of the economy and his reelection. Live and let die. A vaccine is coming.
How is the recovery rate 99% and over 150k people already died in this country alone? Numbers probably from Trump.🤦🏾‍♀️
Funny he uses “critics” for what he describes are Trump loyalists.
The propaganda of the left is pushed by Twitter as they suppress Trump's supporters and even his campaign! Their tweet was removed by Kamala Harris' former press secretary who now works for   (imagine that) Election interference
SHOULD DONALD TRUMP WIN, OR EVEN STEAL THE ELECTION, then America is far beyond resurrecting. In part, it will mean the 47% of White women who voted for trump decided they wanted 4-more years of the same. Also, that the preponderance of White voters are satisfied with status quo.
As long as Biden gets rid of Hope (Hicks) and all of Trump’s other evil minions, that is all we need as a country.
Than if Trump did. Or is revolution just inevitable at this point? Is there no longer a democractic path to a more equitable society? I don't know. It's hard, I struggle with  these thoughts everyday.
It's unforgivable and I will never forgive them. But will we even have a functional Democracy if Trump wins again? Do we have one now? Not really, but the chances of restoring some form of democracy and eventually implementing leftist policies may be more likely if Dems win...
The fact that we’re gong to have an election for the highest office in the land and the candidates we’re choosing between are him and Trump, well, it doesn’t say GREAT things about America.
I love how to defend a mentally declining man you have to bring up someone else. The man is mentally unwell. No need to mention anyone else when we are speaking of joe. If you’re comfortable with this man running the country, regardless if you like trump or not, you’re crazy.
Trump is a treacherous &amp; treasonous man whose loyalties are to Putin &amp; his wallet. Ovr last 3.5 yrs he has proven that. And the majority of the country now see that. And he’s incompetent w/ 160,000 dead Americans to his credit.
What does she say about trump?
I’m not a liberal u ignorant trump lover. I’m a Republican, retired vet, gun owning evangelical who recognizes that trump is not a Republican or conservative. And he does not love America or what this country stands for.
Yes, I made that point earlier in another comment where I implied he was going to get sued for intellectual property theft by Trump, something HE THREATENED he should do to Giulliani.
There was no conclusion to jump to. Im looking at the words used. Every politician does it but Trump the only one who’s name gets thrown around.
Why don’t you worry what Trump is hiding w/ his taxes, refusing to let administration ppl talk under oath, using “acting” positions instead of confirmation hearings, and lots more? Worry abt democracy &amp; freedoms being stolen by Trump than a Prince overseas.
Hence the theoretical...  A list of subscribers and where they live being given to the US Govt is problematic.  It’s not nearly as problematic as an app that might be able to tap a phone for video and sound being used by a foreign power.  Trump’s stupid ‘fix’ is for a real issue

The impression this ad leaves with me is that Donald Trump spent his life widening the range of his moral weaknesses and moral debt, until there came a time when his creditors decided to call in their debt with favors that harm the fabric of American democracy.  /1
I'm not misinterpreting it at all. I even posted the definitions of platform and publisher for you. But as usual, liberals are in denial. Have a good day, because you're looking at four more years of Trump.

Exactly, also in March it wasn’t as wide spread, a shortage of ppe and a public run on masks could’ve kept medical staff from having any and the home made mask thing hadn’t started. This was best info at time, it changed, trump wouldn’t tell people to wear masks until last week?

Harry Shearer has been back in the studio with more parody songs aimed right at Donald Trump. His new retro-styled funk and R&amp;B track "COVID 180" is out today.   "Whole month of February/ It's under control/ Just a few cases/ Then we rock and roll"
Now we know what Trump really meant when he said, "It will magically disappear."
Yep, you said it better than ole toilet sitting trump. #dumptrump
The economy has tanked. Americans are dying. Thousands are out of work and about to be evicted. Trump, the consummate self-dealer, is running for re-election and trying to distract us. Don’t forget: Trump is fine with Putin’s BOUNTIES ON AMERICAN SOLDIERS.

Republicans are responsible for the Southern Strategy. They were racist and corrupt before they decided to support Trump. They don't care about policy, only about staying in power by any means.
Yeah, it kinda does. Republicans have overwhelmingly supported Trump, the Republican Party is now the party of corruption, fascism and racism. It's time to #DefundtheGOP.

As an American, I can assure you that Trump has done virtually nothing to benefit average Americans. He has defied our laws, our Constitution, and diminished our Democratic institutions. Every move he has made is self dealing, directly or indirectly.

From a historical stand point, what you've said is not factual. You can cough up casual statements if you care to, but I'm mindful that historians will be reading through our posts looking for accurate information. I'm stating that Trump asked for and got help from the Russians.
You are contradict yourself Joe Ro.  One does not cheat and win at the same time.  Had it not been for cheating, Trump would not be in the Oval Office.  There is no way a cogent statement can be made to make the statement of Trump winning the presidency accurate.
Oh is  concerned!?Abt sexism?!Yet she voted for the rapist Kavanaugh &amp; thought the rapist/abuser Trump “learned his lesson”! Aren’t we sick to death of this sycophantic a$$hole in congress?! Vote her out! The rest of the filth too! #RepublicansAreEnemiesOfThePeople
Silly Trump. Doesn't he know it's only okay to attack the faith of Muslims?
This is standard death cult fare, the only difference being Trump outsources far less of the doomsaying to surrogates than others have in the past. But make no mistake, this IS the GOP line, for 41 years &amp; counting.
I choked on my coffee.   And then I started thinking about mapping candidates to FF characters. Trump's obvious. But Biden... Maybe Strago? Tellah? Kanye is Ultros, don't  me.
HUGE TRUMP SUPPORTER!!!
According to Trump, Joe Biden is both “weak” and “sleepy” and possesses unlimited super powers that can “hurt god”.
*ALL* GOP are swamp rats - with Donald Trump being the biggest rat of all 🥺👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
The governors didn’t lie to us about this virus.  Trump did.  Then he started stealing away PPE shipments that governors ordered after telling them to take care of it. It’s time for you to see what’s in front of you. Why do you believe these lies?
Amen. Venezuelan Americans are an important voting bloc in Florida and other states. Ana can help there. She also used to work for John McCain so she despises Trump as much as we do.
Welcome to Louisiana! We hope you are prepared to step back in time by at least 100 years!!
I see. So you’d rather have an autocratic dictatorship than do what you can to sane the country. We can’t live to fight another day when our freedoms have been stripped. If you support Bernie, you’d be voting joe. Bernie is imploring everyone to focus on removing trump.

Can’t wait for Trump to screw up your name and you taking to twitter saying Trump was using an ancient Hindu dialect with a Zoroastrian accent from the 5th Century bce.
You are distorting your tweet. It was not that he would sue only b/c of quarantine. It was that Trump wanted to unilaterally force NYC &amp; tri-State area to isolate entire area based solely on the FL gov (his supporter) telling you do so. Not on science or scientific evidence
Why would you write this considering Trump immediately corrected himself? Don’t you see how this makes you appear foolish?
Remember when Trump ridiculed CA for their proactive actions? Or how he failed to do anything in Feb? Or when he called it a Dem hoax? Or when he said it go away in April? Or when he said it was under controlled? Or when he said it would go from 15 patients to zero? All lies

Mitch’s wife makes millions off of her China connections. Ivanka got numerous patents from Chinese govt. But Trump’s pure loyalty is to Putin. Trump will destroy the NATO alliance &amp; Chinese/US relations on orders of Russia. He’s the greatest US traitor ever developed by Russia.
Just like a trump member to deny facts. We see how Hitler could’ve gotten an entire country to harm &amp; then kill millions of innocent Jews &amp; others. Trump supporters refuse facts &amp; believe the cult leader is right. Look up cult mentality. Look up the facts. Trump is a cult leader
You watch too much Fox. The federal government lied to all of us abt this coming pandemic. So all lacked preparation. Supplies were withheld from some states &amp; given freely to others. Trump demanded loyalty &amp; praise from governors. Stop being a bottom feeder on his &amp; Fox lies
Aren’t all trump cultists? Not voters. But the die hard cultists we see. They never seem happy. Failing at the game or capitalism then sucking the toes of those who won it must be an internal struggle.

First that was Nixon, the president trump wishes he was. Second different eras brought about bad bills, it’s all about reacting to information. Third:
You would think my representative  would be worried about *this* instead of clutching his pearls about NYC and the NRA.  Why are we ignored? Trump doesn’t care about Louisiana! He just wants your vote, and then to move on quickly from associating with swamp people.

Believe that when Nov 3rd comes and you have another 4 years of him as President.   And yes, you liberals are so deranged that if it took tanking the economy and hurting millions just to get rid of Trump, you'd do it in a heartbeat.
Quite ironically, Trump’s died orange hair and orange-faced complexion will match the Orange jumpsuits worn by NY State prisoners. He will certainly resemble a Pumpkin with his generous girth in that orange jumpsuit. The November 3 election is 4 days after Halloween. Scary!

Not a good man. Like, can you at least accept that you're voting for a bad man, just "less bad" than Trump? I mean, it sucks and that's why you want the criticism to end, but it'll make you feel better if you face reality instead of hiding from it, you know?
Trump no more wants to spend the next 4 years “working” as President  than the man in the moon. He is only running for re-election to avoid various federal &amp; NY state prosecutions and investigations. Will cost him many millions of $ in legal fees &amp; possibly fines and forfeitures.

Trump vs Biden
Trump: "He's a Socialist!!" Bernie: "Yeah, I am. So?"  Trump: "...Shit. I didn't have plan for that. You were supposed to deny it and be put on the defense."  We all know what's going to happen with Biden. You all are betting the farm on Trump fatigue. Good luck.
Trump said "thigh-land", didn't he?
You apology rings hollow Joe!    VOTE DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT 2020!!  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Trump said during a speech one time “I love the blacks” and was called racist. But this is fine. My lord how do African Americans support this party?
Every night prayers for our country and President Trump 🙏🏻🇺🇸🙏🏻
This is why I agree with those who propose if Biden wins a commission or special Congressional committee to investigate every single example of the Trump family's graft and corruption the last 4 years. Even if they are not all prosecuted, the public must know about the abuses.
Fake newz loves to say Trump has failed at handling Corona virus when he has actually handled it to perfection!! I'd even prefer his medical opinion over Dr Fauci.
VOTE DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT 2020!   Four. More. Years!!!  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This is the day Donald Trump did what I have tried and failed to do for almost six, long years: Melt  brain with my abject stupidity
This must kill you guys to have a big story and are completely unable to bash Trump with it. You were up all night racking your tiny little brains "How can we blame orange man for this?"  You actually have to cover news, do you even remember how?

Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
That’s exactly why Trump voters will vote Kanye instead. Similar thing happened w/Bernie in ‘16. After he dropped out, right-wing was praising him as a noble politician who was wronged by the evil Clinton controlled DNC. As a result right-wingers started actually supporting him.
Maybe you can find the answer in Trump's bible in two corinthians. Only in Trump's bible you might find that Biden can hurt omnipotence.

Hey No Leg To Stand On, you up?One thing I believe is that when it comes to trump, it could always get worse. He could still continue to lose more voters to Biden.

President Trump is utterly weak and helpless to protect us from Covid-19, so in order to make himself feel powerful, he sets his sights on ... TikTok? I swear, it’s just a parody administration at this point. We are 88 days from Election Day. The nightmare ends soon.
So what? They attack Trump every damn day!
The fact that so many people hate this man and yet believe Donald Trump to be a man of God truly boggles my mind. Biden’s beliefs are not in lockstep with mine, but at least I can see signs of his faith. Trump only has faith in himself and money.
President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered an unspecified ban on transactions with the Chinese owners of the consumer apps TikTok and WeChat.
The new order bans TikTok under the National Emergencies Act and is set to take effect in 45 days.
Trump piss because the youngsters played a joke on him during his election Rally when he thought lots of people would show up and they didn’t that’s why he wnat to ban Tik tok that’s people jobs he don’t score though
Options are Trump or Biden. There are no other options. Either GOP or Dems. If you don't vote GOP Wins. If you vote 3rd party GOP Wins. At this point less than a 100 days away if you not helping get Dems in, you're helping GOP.

Instead of just holding up a Bible that he doesn’t own, at a church he’s never been inside, for a photo op.... Trump maybe should read a Bible once in a while.
Blame the governors if you want to blame someone Trump acted quickly and decisively even though congress bashed him for doing so

Trump said Friday the Chinese-owned video app TikTok will be banned in the U.S., which he said he can do through emergency economic powers or an executive order.
It's not helpful for Trump to think out loud, period.
Regan wouldve definitely been a trump if they would had the internet back then
And Trump is doing what exactly? You hypocrite.
um okay? what this had to do with you supporting trump nutty ass shawty?
Wow! I know what Antifa means, which is why I think it’s despicable that you say OUR president among the likes of Hitler &amp; Stalin. They’ve killed millions of minorities while Trump has helped millions! What an unAmerican thing to say!
Methinks the real reason Trump is banning Tiktok is because he got punked by a bunch of Tiktok kids who bought up all the tickets for his Tulsa rally and didn't show...just so he'd have a half empty stadium.
Trump 2020!!!
I really wish Joe Biden was the radical socialist Donald Trump says he is
Trump maybe not all bad

President Donald Trump will be holding a press conference around 4:30 p.m.
Trump is facing jail time if he can't get reelected, so he will do anything including setting off a nuclear bomb in New York City.
Well can be sure that trump is satan's right hand man, he has destroyed the United States and setting things up for Putin to take over the world.
Well if things go as they have in the bible, I expect that about 1/3 of the population in the United States will perish from the pandemic, storms, fires and or floods. God cleans house when things get too bad, trump has been a great help in stirring up hatred.
Trump just have to destroy everything he touches, he's not satisfied with preventing the smart foreigners from coming here,  which will cause a serious shortage in high tech companies.
Trump wants his dictatorship so bad,  the pandemic ruined everything, but he is a diehard And a police state is what Putin believes in
You do realize Trump and a large number of his staff vote by mail, right? It’s a thing that happens. Many states use it. Louisiana has early voting so we don’t all have to stand in lines for hours on Election Day if we choose not to.
You would quit Twitter if Trump lost? A) I’m not putting that in the hands of strangers. B) Part of my job is social media, so I kinda have to pass on that.   I do not believe he will win. I’d classify him as the underdog. But stranger things have happened.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a “delay” to November’s presidential election. The president is also making allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.TRUMP 2020
They're desperate  More than 100 Americans have died after taking hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 despite Donald Trump insisting people had 'nothing to lose' by trying the unproven drug
Maybe someone coughed on Trump.
Wrong! Regular dose is 200mg and they gave veterans 2400 mg they tried and succeeded in killing our veterans to say Trump is wrong, it doesn't work and even hastens death! Yall are the liars/killers
Oh, I almost forgot....Person, Man, Woman, Camera, TV. Did I get it right? Am I as smart as trump now?  Am I!? Am I!? 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I'm thinking it might have something to do with  tweet a little earlier today? Something has Trump's undies in a bunch..

Biden shouldn't debate period and only if Trump releases his tax returns
Yep. They centered their entire personality and identity around a politician (gee, where have we seen that before?) so they cant handle that Biden won out, and so he's enemy #1. It doesnt matter what Trump does, because Biden is "literally the same and will do the same stuff".
I'm quite sure that they are. I'm sure that Putin thinks that he hasn't milked enough out of trump yet.
The problem from the beginning is trump has been held to very low expectations.The media has enjoyed the ratings of trump and have helped in his rise while still the expectations are to a lower standard.

Donald Trump is Satan himself and his brain dead clueless idiot supporters are pure evil.
Let me ask a few questions:  When President Obama and Vice President Biden were in office, did they take your guns away? NO! Did they take away your religion? NO! Did they take away your bibles? NO!   DONALD TRUMP IS A LIAR!

I think most people agree that Trump has said many problematic things. Why is it so hard to admit that Biden has as well?
I feel like throwing up🤮just saw an ad attacking Trump over coronavirus w some chick blubbering, blaming Trump 4her grandma dying alone. These ppl R so dishonest its galling. Lack of resources? Leadership? When he shut down air traffic from China  Called him xenophobic

I can't stand Trump, but if you are blaming the pandemic on him, you are foolish. No one causes or stops pandemics. We can do some things to mitigate the impact, but catastrophes will still come. This is like blaming Katrina on Bush.

Well, we already got to a point where the Onion cant satire anything because reality is too dumb.  I wonder if we're going to reach a point where she cant parody Trump because he unintentionally devolves too deep into his own self-parody?
Biden’s interview w/ Axios = equally tragic (and they took it *super* easy on him too but good on this guy for going after Trump).  Most depressing: this is the best we can do? EitherArt Garfunkel with dementia, or a lazy narcissistic 70 year old Richie Rich?

I am voting for Trump again, here in Louisiana. I am a Hispanic woman, a lawyer, a Christian, a wife and a mother.
So fucking sad. Can't say that I blame them though. If it weren't for Covid &amp; I had the money I would totally go to Canada to get away from this nightmare that is trump.
It’s about time! The silent majority will be at the polls voting Trump 2020!
Vote  for  the trump it’s important!
That's because it was a joke. The entire time they were asking serious questions, he appeared bored &amp; annoyed. Ya boy thinks that his only job requirement is to kiss trump's ass.
1) PERSON, MAN, WOMAN, CAMERA, TV 😂🤣 2) trump was already called out on Fox about Biden defunding the police. FAKE NEWS!
SEC is seriously asleep under Republican administrations. Just wtf  "Eastman Kodak's top executive reportedly got Trump deal windfall on an 'understanding'"
Trump has over 20,000 documented lies since he's been in office, so who's the pathological liar? Obama?
Nation's testing czar: It's "time to move on" from talk about hydroxychloroquine.    Trump’s Flu
Trump &amp; Kushner should be sentenced to life in prison.
Steve, it’s BS, to continue blaming Democratic Governors. Trump &amp; Kushner are to blame.
i think it was defined by racism well  before Trump.
Awww... Whoever reported me? Didn't work. I speak the truth. You don't like it? TOO DAMN BAD.  I will continue to voice my opinion and fight the good fight.  You want LIES and stupidity? Stay with asshat Trump. You're the Moron. Oh, and FUCK OFF.  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I hope Clinton and Trump share a cell
Russian election interference collusion with the Trump Campaign is a hoax and a total waste of taxpayer money for that pathetic joke called the Mueller investigation
PERSON, MAN, WOMAN, CAMERA, TV 😂🤣#TrumpVirus tax cuts for the rich only &amp; trump already got called out on Fox for saying that Biden wanted to defund the police. Fake news! What else ya got?!
Yes, please do. Vote for anyone besides Trump.
Ok well the Democratic Party has disappointed you....what has trump done for you? I know both parties are so flawed but the dems are so much closer to what you want than trump and the republicans. Sit this one out and there may not even be another chance...it may be authoritarian
Van Jones "Today is the day Trump became....oh wait"
Will Trump say there were good people on both sides? I suppose that woman represented “leftist mobs of Antifa.”
I think insread of debates where Trump can run wild, there should be questions via zoom with digital clocks that cut them off so Trump can’t run his mouth like Fidel Castro.
Trump killed plans for a national testing strategy, because COVID-19 'hit blue states hardest'
An insult to our Democracy deserves much more than an insulting response. Trump and his crew should be hauled in front of the The International Criminal Court for crimes agsinst humanity. For 150000 dead Americans and for kids in cages, concentration camps.
God can only hope he can. The direction our country was going after 8 years of the previous administration left it with many, many issues that had to be corrected.  May God Continue to Bless President Trump 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️
Several. I never realized how many had the thought procese and ideas until Trump"took hold".  I can't just live and let live or let it go. THEIR RACISM, THEIR ignorance, THEIR inability to have compassion or empathy for THEIR fellow human being is something I will not tolerate.
Yes, these evangelicals, gotta love all the FAKE CHRISTIANS that have been exposed since Trump took office, eh?
Dont be fooled into the narrative that Trump will destroy Biden in a debate. Though true, the moderators will pull all the stop necessary to make Biden look normal in the conversations during the debate.
. "Pres Trump says he plans to ban TikTok from the US" Ur mad b/c Tik Tok users made u look the fool. Newsflash! U are a fool! Besides, this is the bullshit you're worried about in the middle of a little thing called a pandemic? Suck it!
Read op-ed about this anti-trump organization. The author wrote that the organizers were opportunistic and former republican operatives who would sell their souls, their children and their mothers for the almighty dollar. They haven’t worked for republican causes in years.
No, Trump &amp; his supporters are white supremacist.
Can’t take Trump out. Not worth the paper or the ink, or the airtime.
It is. We currently have about 30 or so patients on it
Where the hell do you get your misinformation? It's proven time and time again, Trump LOVES the uneducated and #MagatsAreMorons
155!  Not a good golf score, not a good beat Trump Plague score!  Get off the golf course and focus on eradicating this virus!
It will take school to open, more people to get sick, close schools and people will die. Then trump will be proven wrong and look stupid. That’s how things work theses days.
And it don't stop. I'm going to #Download #TikTok right now just to follow    Fuck #Trump #TrumpOut2020
Funny that these protests were non violent and they had guns, yet your beloved “peaceful protesters” are responsible for many acts of violence, murder, destruction, and mayhem. The upside down world of idiot American hating Liberals. You will lose. Trump’s still your DADDY 🇺🇸🤣🤣
Boy, wait til you find out tax payers have paid 138 million dollars for Trump to golf.
#TikTok #tiktokban  Trump is worried about Time Tok but not #COVID  Okay 🙄
People’s unemployment insurance has ended....McConnell sends the senate home for a 3 day weekend...Trump golfs on the weekend as usual. I’m not sure they’re even pretending to care anymore. Why didn’t they pass the house’s bill to extend unemployment insurance till January?
Oh, he "lost" it a long time ago..   is a narcissistic SOCIOPATH who is really jealous of President Obama. It's sad but hysterically funny at the same time. Trump should've never been allowed near our WH with his pathologies let alone holding the highest office.
Why did you vote no for the bill passed in May in the house that would have extended the unemployment insurance until January. It would also gave stimuli checks to individuals and families. Why wouldn’t McConnell take that Bill to the senate floor for a vote. LIAR just like trump
Cha-Ching gov. They have the where with all to move, and you shut things down because Nutty Nancy said to do it. It would hurt Trump. Now they are finding out they can work from home no matter where home is. As that great American philosophier said “Dooh”.
The liberal media won't tell you this.  Yesterday Dr. Fauci told Congress: - Trump's leadership has saved lives. - He agrees with Trump's decisions. - Trump is working with America's smartest doctors and experts to combat COVID-19.  All they want to do is attack
Can I demand a trial by combat for this election? I'd beat up Biden and Trump, be inaugurated, and then immediately step down, allowing VP Sanders to take the reins.
Trump can suck my bbd if he thinks he can ban tiktok
trump said that mf going down as early as tomorrow bro idk why tho 😂
Fuck trump
Y’all wanna replace Trump with who? Somebody worse? Okay. Lol

And your point? I don't see fruit I'm keeping with repentance from Trump. And I'm not voting for a pastor so that isn't important to me.
So trump passed sometbing for extended unemployment but i wonder how its finna play out and how much
Most serious threat to American lives and freedom is Donald Trump. Failure to act on Trump Virus. Failure to do anything at all about bounties on American Soldiers. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Will someone explain to me what else Trump needs to do to satisfy you guys of this pandemic? U Want him on front lines giving tests? 😂Joe Biden would have done nothing different. If Trump mandated masks and lock down the country you lefties would just call him a dictator!

As it stands now the state has to pay 25% of the cost for National Guard through December 31st. That's about $2.5 million a month adding up to about $10 million.

What did you do today besides sit on twitter calling out Trump? What would you do differently? Should he just sit in his basement or can he have leisure time?
Trump will win 2020 no matter who he picks.

Trump 2020 Prophecy -  Kim Clement  via
IIRC W's reaction time in that video was pretty impressive. Trump, I am willing to bet, is not fast.
Was Trump right to ban #TikTok? IMHO, yes.   This should make Twitter and Facebook nervous — their practices are just as egregious with the one redeeming difference being they aren’t directly linked to an oppressive communist state.

Trump wants a fight with China the way he is acting towards them..At a time when world leaders should be coming together to fight this virus Trump is picking fights!
Amazing how this is a complete 180 from the "intellectual right" position for the last three years that Trump critics are out-of-touch tofu-eating coastal liberal elitists
Awe you triggered by a funny? Sorry fragile one. China virus got you all sensitive and shit. Sarcasm and humor are only ok if it’s about Trump huh boomer?
Wake up. Trump is not to blame. If you understood how government works you’d be screaming at the democrats to stop this crap and get it done! Sorry
These relentless Trump haters would rather tear our country apart then concede that things are starting to look up. China virus is the only reason we backslid on economy. “We believe Truth over facts”.biden
These people hate Trump so much they would do anything to get rid of him. Can’t educate these dummies with facts so stop trying.
Nice try boomer. Trump 2020
Trump and Kanye certainly deserve to be in Arkham 🙄
I hate Donald Trump I can’t even fake
Trump is a threat to national security every day that he remains in office.
Same American here, not voting for the greatest threat to the United States since the Civil War, Donald J. Trump.
Can you point to me what Trump needs to apologize for?
And if you think trump and Biden will approach that issue in the same way then you are delusional.
I'm no fan of Trump.   Democrats have a huge open door, so they elect Joe Biden as their candidate. 👀  Why can't we have a high character, thoughtful, no racist option for President? Is that too much to ask?  This election, like last election, is a race to the bottom. #grieving
I would like to know how many guns DUMP. Oops I mean TRUMP OWNS. Not his sons but him himself
Trump signed an executive order to ban tik tok? Things are getting real dictatorship like over here in America 👀
this mindset has been coddled and cultivated on the right for years....It didnt start with Trump and wont go away when he is gone...what happened to Republicans and so-called conservatives?
The new order bans TikTok under the National Emergencies Act and is set to take effect in 45 days.
what you expect I support God thru Donald Trump . It’s part of my sevice as worship God bless America
While CNN trolls Trump, they neglect #SaveTheChildren. Shame
Gov. Mike DeWine underwent a different type of test this afternoon; one considered to be more accurate than the rapid-result test which showed him to be positive for #COVID19
Unfortunately these Trump haters don’t want to hear facts🤷‍♀️
Everything is attack Trump. Your narrative is worn out. What about this video? I’ll wait!
President Trump also stated in the order that ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, must sell the app within the 45-day period.
The orders say that the ban on the Chinese-owned apps will take effect in 45 days.
I will take Trump over this career criminal lying politician. What do you have to say about this?
Why would you only report on one side of the story.  The negative side to be exact. Put Trump aside, don’t really care but your have shared Nothing on Biden, Yates or Riots. Just being realistic and want the real story.
you are right Trump.  The ones who control the banks cannot stand you.  The owners of this world basically.  You are not a political person so that is not in their agenda.  You will always be hated the most because of change.
So this then puts him on equal footing with Trump?
You are right.  Never in history has anyone been attacked more than Trump.  It's for a good reason.  The first non-political person to be voted in for a long time.  It shows that people are tired of long time career politicians.  Change. These people act like scientologist.Angry

Keep telling yourself that crap. Trump gets things done. I feel pity for people like you.
So Trump is a fascist because he won’t close down the country or Force a mask mandate or bc he won’t force the schools to stay closed down. There’s not one thing Joe Biden would have done better about this virus. Not One!!
This or Trump? Is this really the best we have?
Tbh both Trump and Biden is proving we need an age cap on government seats
I understand totally.. My sister is a narcissist.. She loves Trump! She always talks about how POSITIVE she is and before our mom passed away in 2011, my sister took my mother to the cleaners! She abused her verbally as well.. So I know
Not a treatment for covid. Who cares what you doubt about my education or job. You lied and twisted what Trump said. Disinfectants are used in healthcare. Look it up 🤷‍♀️
I had no idea trump thought Biden is SO POWERFUL that he could hurt God? Trump must be terrified! We all know what a religious man trump is!  He actually stood in front of a church sign and held a Bible one time. I saw it with my own eyes just how much faith that man has...
I'm sorry but the pandemic isn't Trump's fault and the economy is far from ruins. The Stock market has almost completely recovered and unemployment caused by shutdowns all over the country is continually improving. You're just as mental as Joe. #Trump2020
How in the f*** did he squander it? My god man that isn't anywhere in the vacinity of reality! The economy was actually SHRINKING before Trump won. Go away old man! #Trump2020

What is your point. Trump has said he knew Epstein. Shouldn’t you be looking at all the pedophiles in Hollywood and Bill Clinton who are on the flight logs to Epstein island? Oh wait child sex trafficking is not as bothersome to you as your hate for Trump!🤷‍♀️ go figure.
Oh ya thanks to trump where the number one exporter of gas in the world. Not because of Obama but because of Trump!!
Also wrong. Thanks to trump gas ain’t $5.00 a gallon.. unless you live in Cali
There's a lot to absorb in this story but my initial impression (and news of LaPierre's corruption is years old now) is that this has less to do with gun politics and more to do with conservatism's 21st-C turn toward outright grift, from Palin to Trump. It's a way to get rich
You to do ! I mean it fir my self ! You are a man Donald John Trump Yiu are not a President that’sa duty you chose to accept don’t get the two twisted presidents can’t cry or die they are non entity’s! Men cry and die they are people be a good person Potus T continue ! Drop any
Absolutely! Pre China virus covid, we were doing great things in America. Look it up! Oh wait, you can’t see truth through your I Hate Trump Shield. 🤷‍♀️
I don’t trust any bureaucrats and it’s almost the same with every elected official. We have problems with too many stupid people voting, too many lying politicians, too much lying media. I trust POTUS TRUMP only because he loves America where he makes his fortunes
Your hate for Trump is impeding your ability to reason. It also lets us know you have a double digit IQ. Awe bless your heart Grammy😂
Pro-Trump protest or anti-Trump protest? Opinions differ on where John's politics were headed when he died...
It's always about trump whenever something bad happens in this country, so why not now
Yes it NEVER used to be this hard I blame Trump 😂
He didn’t want to play follow the kindergarten games Pres Trump took a cognitive test &amp; ACED IT. Why won't Joe take it? What is he hiding? We want to know what YOU think. Take the short poll NOW:
Wrong how’s Trump supposed to go by the Obama Plan when Obama forgot to replenish the stockpile? No one knew who bad this virus is! Idk what Democrats tell you, there is no experience or expertise on a new virus
Alternative Headline: Trump is lying to American citizens for political gain.
Obama is done. This is all you have to say because nothing Trump is campaigning (lying) on is working. You have no talking points and he is under several criminal investigations but you stand by him. We will flip everything in November. Can’t wait.
You sure are, while people die. Support Americans with a living rage for unemployment. Your task force and testing will be evaluated in years to come, written about telling future generations “what not to do”. Trump’s lap dog, since he hates animals.
Would be nice during a pandemic to allow more to do this instead of shutting it down in a month so people don’t have a chance to complete it. Any way to not give mine money to states and the poor. Just make sure they are not counting in the #Census2020. Make sure Trump can decide
All I know is your Leader Trump wouldn’t wear a mask, social distance and promoted an unsafe drug. Still wants to hold rallies and infect people during a pandemic. Doesn’t require a mask. Sends other children to school except his child. His child’s private won’t open, not safe.
No he just controlled the interview. Trump will eat w Wal reporter alive by deflecting if they control the interview.
Yet the Supreme Court has a far higher approval rating than the Trump/Pence clown show.
From what you see trump do the Government and what you saw Obama do and Eric holder you should ge able to see why I’m where I am.Barack Onamamsy beBi but Hes anything but scary weak or a punk to the game he just didn’t give a fuck! WS he right? I can’t say Floyd was innocent type
Mr President Trump is a real citizen, free and independent.  This is what a freeman will do the rest are all sellouts to special interests.  Don't let our president be the last president and vote Trump.
Why bring up trump! You fixing to regret hating him . And your life is now on the line both now and eternal. People demand things they don’t even want and will tske your life to get it abd discard it and you in the blink of a eye they are really frivolous. I think all race
Can’t answer for Him like I can trump we are equal so I stay in my place trump and I are men we go thru the same straits we can relate Gods a whole nother matter!
This guy does not deserve to be President, you should be President after President Trump Sir.
Some kids have died from it, but facts don't matter to Trump. The day I heard Kellyann Conway use the term 'alternative facts' t hit me just how bad this so called presidency was going to be. That was somewhere near the beginning.
The latest high-profile departure underscores the turmoil at Foggy Bottom, and officials fear it will weaken an important watchdog already under fire from top Trump…   To work for Trump is to be forever tainted.
What more could Trump do?
Did you read the reports? No, you just spew CNN talking points. You hate Trump so much that you would post shit without reading it. Not guilty of Russia collusion.🤷‍♀️
Yea, we do see what was done. You attempted to impeach Trump on a dossier that the DNC bought and paid for. Lie after lie and the result is innocence. What did you say when Biden threatened Ukraine to fire prosecutor or not get the money?
This East Texas widow did NOT hold back in the obituary she wrote for her husband, who died recently after a battle with #COVID19. We spoke to her today about why she penned such a pointed message.  #ETX #ETXNews

Trump supporters deal in facts sir.
Exactly. Couldn’t have said it better myself. I would love to hear the voice in his head. That should be a SNL/ Alec Baldwin skit haha. Trump is such a loser with too many psychological problems to list
Honestly, I’m torn. However, we need to impeach Kavanaugh immediately, and a few other Trump appointees.
Trump has been harder on Russia than the last three presidents. You people grasp straws because you still can’t believe Trump won.

I just watched the fox, trump interview and got called a pig and told I was ugly. when I commented on the video. Trumps followers are just like Trump! Degrading me because of my right to freedom of speech? So sad.....
If you’re bold enough to walk around in a Trump face mask I KNOW you’re a racist
Can't believe he's doing this, etc. He said we're friends &amp; should be able to respect each other's opinions or choices or something like that. I said I could never respect a Trump voter &amp; hung up on him. That relationship is dead. He also said he's not a racist, but... So gross.
Another one bites the dust. An old &amp; semi distant friend told me today that he's not voting for a president, but against a party he sees as becoming too socialist. Yep. He's voting for Trump. I was appalled. For a couple of minutes I just told him how horrible Trump is, that I
I think Trump's right though.  That story that we have came out too quick to be accurate.  Makes no sense.
I follow quite a few Trump diehards but I never see them come to terms with this.
a woman I know in nv. just sent me a video. some nurse stating Hydroxychloroquine is the cure! Please spare me.This woman loves trump! Well, she can go ahead and take it..I will stick with Fauchi
Hold up. It’s not Trump wanting to burn down America and its values! I’m pretty sure that’s the Democrats
You can't be shocked. Anyone associated with Trump is a criminal.
Try to change your profile, adding truth. Wait! You do have “agitator” on there.  I had thought that showing POTUS TRUMP and 🇺🇸 you might be rational, maybe a person interested in productive activity.  I admit to making that error.  I have real tasks at hand.  Bother others.
Kamala Harris. Not so much for identity reasons, though those are not nothing. More because the fact that she is loathed by the left will make it more laughable when Trump’s people try to paint the ticket with the socialist brush.
GOP senators let virus benefits expire while they investigated Obama
I can go on and on! I am praying that trump will be gone soon! Sorry for this long book. Has this happened to anyone?
Clean your own house and wake up! These are the very ones who will follow whatever the majority in their little town will be voting. I am in the South where the majority is not democrat , but I will be voting for Biden. Trump is a liar, a poser, narcissist...
I just got tired of you always trashing Trump and others who are actually standing up for Christian beliefs and who don’t support the liberal progressive agenda that is destroying our country who also support abortion, same sex marriages and other things that are in opposition
We all have different views in life, politics, and religion. I may not believe in abortion or some other things, but I will not vote for trump just because he calls himself a Republican. Here is the text I received
So I was slammed for NOT voting for trump! My ex sister in-law sent me a text telling me that well, I’ll post it in the comments. First off, as a Christia one shouldn’t have to stand on a box and shout how you are not if you don’t vote for trump.
Ya thanks to Trump
So the same should apply to trump.  One sided thinking!!!!!

I agree, one death is too many but, once again, the experts say to open schools.  I'm still waiting for the answer to my question about what makes Trump an idiot.
Dude you’re stupid talking points are just ridiculous. If there was really something on Trump the Democrats would have said it already. I am absolutely sure Adam Schiff would have leaked it out.

Trump never keeps a promise and never misses an opportunity
Exactly why Trump should have sat back and repeated everyday he's waiting for their calls for assistance and calling them out. He squandered an opportunity.
Jonathan you did awesome. Best interview ever. Trump stuttered around, looked pretty ignorant. You ask reasonable questions that a President should know. What an embarrassment to our country!!!!!
President Donald Trump said U.S. military generals have told him they think the massive explosion which rocked Beirut on Tuesday, killing more than 70 people, was likely a bomb.
“I’ve met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that this was not some kind of manufacturing explosion type of an event. They seem to think it was an attack. It was a bomb of some kind," said Trump.

Are we going to just accept this? Trump's blasé attitude to the #TrumpVirus is a gross negligence. He has no compassion or respect for the American people which he has sworn to serve. "Oh well" he says " #ItIsWhatItIs " - #TrumpFailsAmerica

Can any trump supporter tell the truth? I, personally have seen several Biden interviews. A few people suggesting that Biden skip the debates (which are not really necessary as there is no one who doesn't know how they are voting) is not "Democrats"!
Watch the full "Axios on HBO" interview with President Trump
Trump’s presidency is basically a poorly run high school play, and it deserves ZERO respect or deference.
What is wrong with you if you can’t see Trump’s deceit, gross incompetence, and psychopathology on full display here? He can’t handle being pressed and challenged by someone who won’t throw him slow pitches with a foam ball. It’s frankly pathetic.
I'm against all this black lives matter bullshit narrative the left has pushed to get Trump out of office and get votes. He did resist,  but it doesn't hide the fact that he was murdered.
The people responsible are the liberals allowing that to happen, that’s not Trump.   These cities refuse Trumps help.  How can it be his fault?   All liberal destruction...
Lowkey on here, some of y’all argue like Trump

That strategy didn’t work! That’s why it got so bad. Every person in the Obama administration tried to take Trump out so why would trump listen to anything Obama had to say.

This is why we voted for Trump. We tired of Iraq and Afghanistan, and the people who wanted more. Trump had the balls to say Iraq was a mistake and that we should stay out of Syria.   How many enemies does being against war give a man in D.C?
Why would he need to publicly signal this?  Reminds me of 2016 when Paul Ryan and other Republicans tried to sabotage the Trump campaign. Who denounces then? No one.

Nothing new here but straight to the point.  Holding people accountable hasn't happened.  The trust the plan people might finally be vindicated if only a little.  The writing on the wall has been that Trump was preparing the biggest October surprise ever.  We will see...

Trump said Friday the Chinese-owned video app TikTok will be banned in the U.S., which he said he can do through emergency economic powers or an executive order.
Thank Trump for that. He shut the country down early. Yay Trump.
Quick question: if GOP is so worried about mail in voting, why is the Trump campaign sending out emails encouraging trump supporters to vote by mail. 🤔
Absolutely NOT! It doesn't matter who the VP pick is. It is imperative that we get Trump out of the office. Last chance to save the Democracy.
So how do these Dumbsses convince anyone that trumps pandemic response has been anything but a colossal clusterfuck of epic magnitude? More White Power?
I’ve listened to the Orange Menace ramble for an uncomfortably long time. It’s not just a snippet that is suspect. It’s the entire speech. At the end of the day, Trump is divisive and amoral, and that is why even though Biden wasn’t my first choice, he’s getting my vote.
We just want to #ReleaseVolume5 of the counterintelligence report. It is in the Senate Intel. Trump has fired so many people trying to avoid this investigation to go forward, of course with Trump enablers like you. Also why not help unemployed citizens by doing your job with $$$.
God may never fail but Trump sure did. He has never prayed to God in his life.
I think more people are. I run through a really nice neighborhood and 4 years ago the yards were filled with 'Trump Pence' signs. This election- nothing. They don't want to admit they are going to vote Blue, this is La after all. But I think that might happen
Whatever comments she has said in regards demons and aliens Nevertheless, it is only being said now, to distract the "cure" she has exposed.  Explain why Americans are being allowed to die???Re-elect President Trump.
you seem a bit slow Mr. Jeffries. Are you able to reason or just like? Trump never said to inject bleach. 1. It was never an instruction to do anything. 2. It was a question. 3. He said disinfectant, not bleach.
Wait a second.  We all make choices and Mr. Cain was no different.  No one knows how things could have been different but blaming President Trump is the easy part.  How about finding a way to save lives:  "Dr. Stella"has a plan why are they not using it?
Amazing.. MSN article states that Trump wants the election Nov. 3! Like he has a choice? He just wants to feel like he is the one that decides this! God, he really gets under my skin..Don't know how anyone would vote for him..Perplexed in Louisiana!

This is one of the main points anyone who's NOT in the proTrump or antiTrump movements cards about:  People need plans of action, hell action itself not just rhetoric to feed the base of support.  That's why BLM will turn on the Dems at somepoint as well.

I feel like Louisiana could be competitive for Biden. I know a LOT of Republicans up here in Shreveport. I also know a LOT of Republicans who will be voting for Biden or a third party candidate over Trump in November.
The bigger question is, who thinks trump actually reads newspapers?

IIRC W's reaction time in that video was pretty impressive. Trump, I am willing to bet, is not fast.
Was Trump right to ban #TikTok? IMHO, yes.   This should make Twitter and Facebook nervous — their practices are just as egregious with the one redeeming difference being they aren’t directly linked to an oppressive communist state.

Amazing how this is a complete 180 from the "intellectual right" position for the last three years that Trump critics are out-of-touch tofu-eating coastal liberal elitists
Awe you triggered by a funny? Sorry fragile one. China virus got you all sensitive and shit. Sarcasm and humor are only ok if it’s about Trump huh boomer?
Wake up. Trump is not to blame. If you understood how government works you’d be screaming at the democrats to stop this crap and get it done! Sorry
These relentless Trump haters would rather tear our country apart then concede that things are starting to look up. China virus is the only reason we backslid on economy. “We believe Truth over facts”.biden
These people hate Trump so much they would do anything to get rid of him. Can’t educate these dummies with facts so stop trying.
Nice try boomer. Trump 2020
Trump and Kanye certainly deserve to be in Arkham 🙄
I hate Donald Trump I can’t even fake
Trump is a threat to national security every day that he remains in office.
Same American here, not voting for the greatest threat to the United States since the Civil War, Donald J. Trump.
Can you point to me what Trump needs to apologize for?
And if you think trump and Biden will approach that issue in the same way then you are delusional.
I'm no fan of Trump.   Democrats have a huge open door, so they elect Joe Biden as their candidate. 👀  Why can't we have a high character, thoughtful, no racist option for President? Is that too much to ask?  This election, like last election, is a race to the bottom. #grieving
I would like to know how many guns DUMP. Oops I mean TRUMP OWNS. Not his sons but him himself
Trump signed an executive order to ban tik tok? Things are getting real dictatorship like over here in America 👀
this mindset has been coddled and cultivated on the right for years....It didnt start with Trump and wont go away when he is gone...what happened to Republicans and so-called conservatives?
The new order bans TikTok under the National Emergencies Act and is set to take effect in 45 days.

Everything is attack Trump. Your narrative is worn out. What about this video? I’ll wait!
President Trump also stated in the order that ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, must sell the app within the 45-day period.
The orders say that the ban on the Chinese-owned apps will take effect in 45 days.
I will take Trump over this career criminal lying politician. What do you have to say about this?
Why would you only report on one side of the story.  The negative side to be exact. Put Trump aside, don’t really care but your have shared Nothing on Biden, Yates or Riots. Just being realistic and want the real story.
you are right Trump.  The ones who control the banks cannot stand you.  The owners of this world basically.  You are not a political person so that is not in their agenda.  You will always be hated the most because of change.
So this then puts him on equal footing with Trump?
You are right.  Never in history has anyone been attacked more than Trump.  It's for a good reason.  The first non-political person to be voted in for a long time.  It shows that people are tired of long time career politicians.  Change. These people act like scientologist.Angry

Keep telling yourself that crap. Trump gets things done. I feel pity for people like you.
So Trump is a fascist because he won’t close down the country or Force a mask mandate or bc he won’t force the schools to stay closed down. There’s not one thing Joe Biden would have done better about this virus. Not One!!
This or Trump? Is this really the best we have?
Tbh both Trump and Biden is proving we need an age cap on government seats
I understand totally.. My sister is a narcissist.. She loves Trump! She always talks about how POSITIVE she is and before our mom passed away in 2011, my sister took my mother to the cleaners! She abused her verbally as well.. So I know
Not a treatment for covid. Who cares what you doubt about my education or job. You lied and twisted what Trump said. Disinfectants are used in healthcare. Look it up 🤷‍♀️
I had no idea trump thought Biden is SO POWERFUL that he could hurt God? Trump must be terrified! We all know what a religious man trump is!  He actually stood in front of a church sign and held a Bible one time. I saw it with my own eyes just how much faith that man has...
I'm sorry but the pandemic isn't Trump's fault and the economy is far from ruins. The Stock market has almost completely recovered and unemployment caused by shutdowns all over the country is continually improving. You're just as mental as Joe. #Trump2020
How in the f*** did he squander it? My god man that isn't anywhere in the vacinity of reality! The economy was actually SHRINKING before Trump won. Go away old man! #Trump2020

There's a lot to absorb in this story but my initial impression (and news of LaPierre's corruption is years old now) is that this has less to do with gun politics and more to do with conservatism's 21st-C turn toward outright grift, from Palin to Trump. It's a way to get rich
You to do ! I mean it fir my self ! You are a man Donald John Trump Yiu are not a President that’sa duty you chose to accept don’t get the two twisted presidents can’t cry or die they are non entity’s! Men cry and die they are people be a good person Potus T continue ! Drop any
Absolutely! Pre China virus covid, we were doing great things in America. Look it up! Oh wait, you can’t see truth through your I Hate Trump Shield. 🤷‍♀️
I don’t trust any bureaucrats and it’s almost the same with every elected official. We have problems with too many stupid people voting, too many lying politicians, too much lying media. I trust POTUS TRUMP only because he loves America where he makes his fortunes

Wrong how’s Trump supposed to go by the Obama Plan when Obama forgot to replenish the stockpile? No one knew who bad this virus is! Idk what Democrats tell you, there is no experience or expertise on a new virus
Alternative Headline: Trump is lying to American citizens for political gain.
Obama is done. This is all you have to say because nothing Trump is campaigning (lying) on is working. You have no talking points and he is under several criminal investigations but you stand by him. We will flip everything in November. Can’t wait.
You sure are, while people die. Support Americans with a living rage for unemployment. Your task force and testing will be evaluated in years to come, written about telling future generations “what not to do”. Trump’s lap dog, since he hates animals.
Would be nice during a pandemic to allow more to do this instead of shutting it down in a month so people don’t have a chance to complete it. Any way to not give mine money to states and the poor. Just make sure they are not counting in the #Census2020. Make sure Trump can decide
All I know is your Leader Trump wouldn’t wear a mask, social distance and promoted an unsafe drug. Still wants to hold rallies and infect people during a pandemic. Doesn’t require a mask. Sends other children to school except his child. His child’s private won’t open, not safe.
No he just controlled the interview. Trump will eat w Wal reporter alive by deflecting if they control the interview.
Yet the Supreme Court has a far higher approval rating than the Trump/Pence clown show.

This guy does not deserve to be President, you should be President after President Trump Sir.
Some kids have died from it, but facts don't matter to Trump. The day I heard Kellyann Conway use the term 'alternative facts' t hit me just how bad this so called presidency was going to be. That was somewhere near the beginning.
The latest high-profile departure underscores the turmoil at Foggy Bottom, and officials fear it will weaken an important watchdog already under fire from top Trump…   To work for Trump is to be forever tainted.
What more could Trump do?
Did you read the reports? No, you just spew CNN talking points. You hate Trump so much that you would post shit without reading it. Not guilty of Russia collusion.🤷‍♀️
Yea, we do see what was done. You attempted to impeach Trump on a dossier that the DNC bought and paid for. Lie after lie and the result is innocence. What did you say when Biden threatened Ukraine to fire prosecutor or not get the money?

Honestly, I’m torn. However, we need to impeach Kavanaugh immediately, and a few other Trump appointees.

I just watched the fox, trump interview and got called a pig and told I was ugly. when I commented on the video. Trumps followers are just like Trump! Degrading me because of my right to freedom of speech? So sad.....
If you’re bold enough to walk around in a Trump face mask I KNOW you’re a racist
Can't believe he's doing this, etc. He said we're friends &amp; should be able to respect each other's opinions or choices or something like that. I said I could never respect a Trump voter &amp; hung up on him. That relationship is dead. He also said he's not a racist, but... So gross.
Another one bites the dust. An old &amp; semi distant friend told me today that he's not voting for a president, but against a party he sees as becoming too socialist. Yep. He's voting for Trump. I was appalled. For a couple of minutes I just told him how horrible Trump is, that I
I think Trump's right though.  That story that we have came out too quick to be accurate.  Makes no sense.
I follow quite a few Trump diehards but I never see them come to terms with this.

Hold up. It’s not Trump wanting to burn down America and its values! I’m pretty sure that’s the Democrats
You can't be shocked. Anyone associated with Trump is a criminal.
Try to change your profile, adding truth. Wait! You do have “agitator” on there.  I had thought that showing POTUS TRUMP and 🇺🇸 you might be rational, maybe a person interested in productive activity.  I admit to making that error.  I have real tasks at hand.  Bother others.
Kamala Harris. Not so much for identity reasons, though those are not nothing. More because the fact that she is loathed by the left will make it more laughable when Trump’s people try to paint the ticket with the socialist brush.

I just got tired of you always trashing Trump and others who are actually standing up for Christian beliefs and who don’t support the liberal progressive agenda that is destroying our country who also support abortion, same sex marriages and other things that are in opposition
We all have different views in life, politics, and religion. I may not believe in abortion or some other things, but I will not vote for trump just because he calls himself a Republican. Here is the text I received
So I was slammed for NOT voting for trump! My ex sister in-law sent me a text telling me that well, I’ll post it in the comments. First off, as a Christia one shouldn’t have to stand on a box and shout how you are not if you don’t vote for trump.
Ya thanks to Trump
So the same should apply to trump.  One sided thinking!!!!!

I agree, one death is too many but, once again, the experts say to open schools.  I'm still waiting for the answer to my question about what makes Trump an idiot.
Dude you’re stupid talking points are just ridiculous. If there was really something on Trump the Democrats would have said it already. I am absolutely sure Adam Schiff would have leaked it out.

President Donald Trump said U.S. military generals have told him they think the massive explosion which rocked Beirut on Tuesday, killing more than 70 people, was likely a bomb.
“I’ve met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that this was not some kind of manufacturing explosion type of an event. They seem to think it was an attack. It was a bomb of some kind," said Trump.

Watch the full "Axios on HBO" interview with President Trump
Trump’s presidency is basically a poorly run high school play, and it deserves ZERO respect or deference.
What is wrong with you if you can’t see Trump’s deceit, gross incompetence, and psychopathology on full display here? He can’t handle being pressed and challenged by someone who won’t throw him slow pitches with a foam ball. It’s frankly pathetic.
I'm against all this black lives matter bullshit narrative the left has pushed to get Trump out of office and get votes. He did resist,  but it doesn't hide the fact that he was murdered.Guess I’ll say it. I know there are a lot of families that wish this is all they had to worry about. I don’t give a dam about Biden or Trump. The senate is the only thing I care about.  The only way to take control is to get rid of people not working for the people.

Nominating conventions are traditionally meant to be media bonanzas, as political parties seek to leverage the attention the events draw to spread their message to as many voters as possible.

You are correct that there are private company plans outside of the affordable care act. You choice to get one, I wouldn't. That said, if Trump cancels the ACA and implements his own version, they would still exist. An EO can't stop companies from offering their own.

Disagree. Vehemently.  Biden is 100x more in the pocket of corporate interests and 100x less interested in the working class than Trump. And Trump isn’t that good.  If you can’t bring yourself to vote Trump, vote #ThirdParty. Make your voice heard.

How many abortions do we think Trump has paid for over the years? I'm guess at least half a dozen.
So here's my theory.  Trump is taking a huge crap in the well because he knows that he's likely to lose re-election. He's screwing the economy for short term gain, fucking the healthcare system, and trying to cause as much damage as possible. If he can't get praise, nobody can.
Because the Treasury Dept is buying bonds like crazy? Like $1T worth. They're manipulating the market to make Trump's numbers go up.
Not to keep harping on this, but Trump is very pro-coal. Where as Hank isn’t just a proponent of propane, but he is actively anti coal.
The fact that people think Hank Hill would vote for Trump is upsetting. Hank Hill would never vote for a man who eats his steaks well-done.
I have a theory:  the GOP refused to deal on purpose, so that Trump could issue an executive order for aid and look like a hero.  That will bolster his poll numbers, even if the order is challenged.  Plus, Dems will look bad if they challenge it.

So then, given those ARE the facts, what other purpose is there for a wall? I say it’s race driven since there’s not other logical explanation.  Go ahead and blindly follow Trump, there are plenty of you, which is embarrassing.
It doesn’t protect her from a certain race or skin color, like Trump’s wall is attempting to do.

Wouldn’t it be funny if all the Governors who didn’t want to be seen with him do the same? “Oh so sorry, I’ve been exposed (or I’m positive)” start doing this everytime Trump landed in their state
“Damage Control” is a full time job for Hannity when it comes to Trump.
I won't wish death. But if I were capable of stopping one of them from running, it would be Trump.
Everything about voting this year makes me nervous. Republicans blocked a bill that would make the voting machines harder to hack. Trump is going so hard on mail in voting, his Post Master has stock in UPS. (How is that legal??)
What Uncle Joe was trying to say was 95% of Blacks can't stand trump, while its only about 80% of Hispanics!
Yep Jim, at least President Trump can string coherent sentences together unlike Joe Biden. Why don’t you tweet about his racially insensitive remarks (Biden) made yesterday regarding Black people. #Crickets
can congress start sending trump stooges, who spit on subpoenas (&amp;/or the US Constitution), to gitmo?
can someone explain to  that #SCOTUS are supposed to be impartial judges of the law, not partisan hacks.  and ESPECIALLY not traitors to the USA.   unlike, apparently,    &amp;  - under trump - they are all traitors.
that sounds like a triggered trump-Russia-RINO who dgaf about the USA or anything other than worshipping the donald
Take a look at my latest oped:  The media portrays Uncle Joe as a familiar face, reliable statesman, and known quantity in contrast with the volatile Mr. Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history.
This is not the appointment of an ambassador, but provocateur an antagonist. This is like a doctor giving a sick patient poison instead of medicine. trump is not only incompetent, but petty to this nation's peril. We must cleanse ourselves of this foul knave &amp; heal our alliances
Trump Tries to Make It Hard for Anyone Else to Behave Ethically, Either
You don't have to be of any specific religious affiliation to understand the importance of faith in our lives. Trump is a despicable person for questioning one's faith. Freedom of religion is still part of America's vision of freedom for all.
Problem is that his mistake was telling the truth about his racist opinions.
The point is the hypocrisy of Trump trying to say Biden is a racist, I don’t believe he is, his comment was though, and the hypocrisy of Trump.  For the record, I don’t think Trump is fully a racist. He’s just stupid.
I can. He shouldn’t have said it.  It was a stupid comment.  Now, your turn on Trump.
Every day with trump is a very bad day...
I can't handle Nicholas Cage movies. For some reason his face bothers me. Like actually physically makes me cringe.   To be fair I had the same reaction to Trump when we had to watch his show in my freshman career class.
Interesting how you keep ignoring Trump’s hypocrisy
Interesting how you keep ignoring Trump’s hypocrisy
Interesting how you all keep deflecti g to Biden and ignoring Trump’s hypocrisy.
Yes, we all have to know what Trump means. I tell you what, publish an Idiot to English translation book so we can understand what he means when he speaks. And if he’s talking about MS13, then some of them aren’t nice people. 🙄
Where Do Republicans Go From Here?
Who is afraid to debate? Biden has debated 12 times in the past year against MUCH more intelligent and articulate people than Dipshit Donnie. Trump is horrible in debates, because it shows how uniformed (ignorant) he really is
So the mayor doesn’t condemn the action because it is violent and bad, he condemns it only because he says it will help Trump get re-elected.  Sad.  He should condemn the riots altogether.
Maybe, but never trump also means: Never Barr Never Carson Never Kudlow  Never Pompao  Never Executive Brach of Government
If Trump says it, then it must be right, right?🤣
President Trump claims Biden is ‘against God’ and will ‘hurt the Bible.’
So what do luxury vacations, privates jets, and fine dining have to do with you owning your stupid guns? You’re okay with corrupt leaders? Oh, never mind - you’re a Trump supporter-question answered
Trump’s racism is too overpowering to see any other.

You might think Trump’s popularity is low at 44% until you see that the worthless congress is 18%. And I think 18% is too high. Too many hard left a Democrats and talk talk talk RINOs
But at least Trump is protecting the taxpayers!! Get your crayon out because you need to multiply $179K times 400 rounds of golf.
Wasn’t it Jesus that said “No, I want to be the one to cast the first stone.  Everyone line up behind me!!!” Yeah that’s it. You Trump supporters are all such great Christians!!!! 🙄
Trump being the good Christian he is, what church does he attend? But I digress, learned from Jesus that you build walls to keep the oppressed out. When Jesus was talking to the prostitution and the Pharisees could t believe it....
Hoping they were Trump supporters.

President Trump issued executive orders Thursday evening prohibiting Americans from transacting with the owners of popular mobile apps TikTok and WeChat.

"Active" evil to me requires something more than mere consequence, so I say Trump. But in terms of harm caused, thus far, it goes to Bush.
If “pro life” and “Trump supporter” are your ideas of insults, you’re right...you’re wasting your time here. I proudly claim both titles. (BTW, my name is not Karen, but you idiots have overused that one to the point it’s not offensive, it’s just tired).
Trump speaks and the country cringes from embarrassment.
Mark Epstein, Jeffrey's brother, is on the record saying that DJT was on Jeffrey's plane "numerous times" and "They were good friends.  I know [Trump] is trying to distance himself, but they were."
This refusal to wear masks is proof positive that Americans are idiots. That’s how we got trump. That’s how we got 160,000 covid deaths. That’s how trump has any chance of being re-elected.   #Stupidity

Just like your father Billy you cherry pick verses in the Bible as although the Bible is the most important book and nothing but truth. So how can you give support to Trump who is the corrupt president in the last 120 years.
AXIOS on HBO: President Trump Exclusive Interview (Full Episode) | HBO  via
I was honestly uninformed. My daily routine was to check  daily. I thought the election was handed to Hilary when Trump got the nomination. I didn’t know about the racism or understand the extent of failed business.
If my prescriptions don’t show up soon, I swear... Break out the pitchforks. The USPS was doing its job until the latest Trump appointee got claws into it.
In a sane world, any other president with trump’s dismal performance record would have resigned from shame a long time ago.
Who cares what Chris Wallace says? He has no credibility with conservatives and Trump supporters. Some other Fox personalities have credibility but no one pays attention to Wallace  Chris Wallace says Trump wouldn't want more debates if he was leading
Turns out 57% of White voters voted for Trump in 2016. So, looking for a silver lining, 50% would be a 7% decline.
For sure! They invest obscene amounts of money in American companies, and they also provide a partnership so those companies can operate in China. It's a win-win for those companies. Until Trump signs an ill-considered, vaguely worded ban on Tencent. 😬
Won’t help trump. Most of his cult are anti-vaxxers.
He's only hurting Trump and himself lol
Trump is campaigning for Biden.
Wait, did Trump just ban Crusader Kings III? I paid money for that.

Exactly.  I mean, when he called Mexicans murderers and rapists that’s when I had enough.  No wait, that was Trump 🤔
The people love Trump. The media worships an empty headed corrupt fool aka Biden.
That’s Trump. 🤷‍♂️
Something Trump has never understood: People will forgive or overlook your mistakes if you simply acknowledge them.
So Trump normally has a sales spin on everything and normally it’s optimistic. So when he said today that he had rich enemies and that he wouldn’t be seen for awhile, how do you take that? #SaveTheChildren #Trump
We as Christians ask a lot what can I do. We can get out the vote. This election is about keeping our right to worship  who is going to vote Trump the moral choice
Def, but only because I want to see Biden, “Hurt the Bible. Hurt God,” like Trump said he would if he wins. The former won’t put up much of a fight (inanimate objects are notoriously lazy), but God is supposedly a badass.😏
So clearly the play must be to fail at the negotiations so trump can his executive thing and try to look like a hero. He never why MCConnell didn’t bother taking part. They don’t want to make deal. Probably will take parts of it &amp; put it in the EO maybe.
I think that one of the debate moderators should ask each candidate for their favorite bible verse. Pretty certain Biden could do it. Trump? NEVER.
You hurt God by ignoring simple rules like being greedy, lying, cheating on your spouse, deliberately putting lives in danger for personal gain... If only Trump had the capacity to hear his own words.
Trump banned flights coming in from China and ppl critized him for it! Had he not done that it would have been a million times worse. I blame fauci. I believe they know how to help the situation but helping the situation doesn’t make money for him and gates.
at the VERY least - every "christian" who supports trump has repeatedly blasphemed the Holy Spirit.  so, their consciences are seared - they do NOT know good from evil.  there is NO repentance from the eternal sin of blaspheming the Holy Spirit.
US Covid deaths are also higher than the US KIA in both the Korean War and Vietnam War combined. Again, Trump’s attitude is like “So? And?”
trump's lying about rona, nonstop, actually created millions of jobs, instead of losing SIXTY MILLION+ AMERICAN JOBS?  we're at 35 - 40% of the American workforce UNEMPLOYED, since march.  trump has been lying about rona since november.
Hey Mercedes, think you'll appreciate this one, showing how utterly ridiculous &amp; hopeless is your trolling for Trump: The dumbest “person” on this planet!
al qaeda was destroyed within the first month that trump infested the white house?!?

Trump do not care for black people or people of color.  You need to study Black History and while you are studying.  Study the civil rights movement.  As long as trump is in office, Police will continue to kill black people.
I wish I could vote for the Biden that Trump rambles about and not the actual Biden. Fake Biden sounds fucking awesome

Totally true. Trump as president of the USA is like a really bad reality show and everyone is wondering why the writers make him out to be such a dumb fuck AssHole.
It would help if you didn't weaponize their children &amp; grandchildren. Either you people or just plain stupid ir just plain evil. Hard to decide. Trump is killing your party &amp; y'all are letting him. U R Just As Guilty As He Is!!!
This is my reaction to most things people think Biden should do. He is ahead. Trump and COVID19 are doing the heavy lifting. Why rock the boat?
It's supposed to be funny. It was a thing in spring of 2019. Throwing cheese slices at babies, cats, dogs. There's a pic of a cheese slice on Trump's face, too.
Can we have the version of Joe Biden that Trump keeps yodeling about? He sounds pretty good.
Yea-but if you visit your friend in the hospital whos been in a car accident, you cant catch “car accident” from him. End of argument.
All the white dude podcasters who are out there right now like "I don't *get* Sarah Cooper's Trump vids, like what even is the joke??" are really telling on themselves, autism-wise

So, Mercedes, you're still peddling your schlapp-happy balderdash about mail-in ballots.  Just what is it you'll do when your dangerous, destructive, racist, delusional, deranged, pathological liar, sociopath, neo-fascist Trump is evicted from the White House?

That’s called being smart and letting Trump display what’s wrong with Trump on a daily basis. Better to have people think you’re stupid then to open your mouth and prove that you are. And Trump proves it daily!!!
When do we move from....boy Biden makes a lot of racially related gaffes to Biden is a plain ol racist? With Trump they have to twist his words around to make his comments seem racist. Don't have to do that with Biden. Just cue the tape!
What is Trump hiding in his taxes? Biden has released his - where is Trump’s?  I would be careful if I were you - we all know Trump really failed. Not a good look if he has to release it.
Like Obama's campaign speech for Biden while attacking Trump at John Lewis' funeral? Like that??
So saith the Reverend Trump???
A grieving widow is not letting her husband’s death from COVID-19 be in vain, penning a scathing obituary with a pointed message for President Trump and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, along with those who refuse to wear masks.
We can only pray that’s true. Meanwhile, Trump will do anything and everything to try to steal the election. He has already started by undermining voting by mail.
I would love to hear Trump respond to this simple question: "What is the Bible?"
What church does Trump regularly attend? *crickets*

Who is advising Trump to lower expectations for Biden in the debates? By September, if Biden shows up sober and completes one coherent sentence, he'll exceed the expectations Trump is setting with these idiotic attacks.
And yet, no matter how often God puts his hands on Trump, he never learns.

The only way I'm not voting for Joe Biden based on his VP is if his VP's last name is Trump.

Uh, yeah. She's not my first choice, but I want Trump GONE. We can't start moving in the direction we want if he's still president.  Also, don't ignore your down-ballot races! Vote in your local/state elections. It's how we apportion electors in the EC for the most part!
TRUMP WILL WIN IT!
Sure. trump’s DOJ &amp; AG Barr are ignoring the Clinton Foundation because it’s a massive criminal organization. Uh-huh. 🤔
If you would decide against him because of his pick for VP, you don't want Trump.gone badly enough. It's either Biden regardless of which woman he chooses or another 4 years of Trump. Easy decision for me. Why not for you?

No, im just being a twitter troll, I'm voting for Biden. Never voted for Trump

Heads up... Trump still doesn’t have a health plan to replace Obamacare. Bet he misses his end of month deadline too
You can’t please everyone. Actually Biden is probably the hardest candidate for Trump to run against. None of his labels are sticking. I would prefer Biden to just serve one term, however (something he has discussed.)

How do these people explain the fact that their Chosen One (trump) promised to “lock her up” hundreds of times but Hillary Clinton has not been indicted let alone convicted of anything. She’s not even under investigation.
Trump claims Biden will "hurt God." This is a campaign in search of a message.
Literally no one denies that Trump and Epstein new each other. But everyone likes to deny that their favorite actors and politicians are actual pedos

Omg you’re right. Trump is definitely a pedo. I saw he even stood next to Epstein before too😱

The #trumpCrimeFamily also ripped off donors via the fake trump foundation, students via the fake trump university and customers via fake vodka, airlines, steaks, etc.   I can see why so many folks support him. 🤔
"Attorney General Underwood’s lawsuit sought the dissolution of the Foundation under judicial supervision and with the oversight of the Attorney General's Charities Bureau." And Trump effectively pled guilty, and dissolved it under court supervision.
Not so sure it's a gift. Many now-former NRA members are so angry about what's happened to the NRA, and reminding them about it isn't necessarily going to help Trump.
They did dissolve Trump's charity using the same law.

“So you see, Biden is centrist right but not as right wing as Trump. And if we elect him, we can push him left of right and then his left will become right and the right will move left to make centrist more left than right. Right? Got it?”
The point she’s making is that. Trump has an interview strategy that involves derailing and prolonged focus on that derail and it’s not a good interview strategy to sound flustered with Trump because he’s a bastard that feeds off of that energy, notices it, and then shuts down

It’s the gd cover.  Comey is a sack too but these people let Jimbo run way out on the limb while they quietly tried to indict trump or set him up.   Horseshit.  They are all guilty

Great descriptions of who Trump is and what he has done to America.
What’s BS?  I know you don’t mean the 4 year Russia Hoax?  Obama and his goons spied on Trump, and tried to take a duly elected President down.   The most crooked Administration ever under Barry.

They’re doing everything in their power to get Trump a win. Also Kanye is Anti black
Trump could threaten to cordon off major US cities and starve them into submission. The Democrats would say, “Just make sure they get to vote!”
The Trump presidency now makes me look back with great fondness to the George W. Bush presidency.
IT IS AS ILLEGAL AS IT CAN GET!  Trump must get a charge out of his constant criminal activity...
The Trump Administration could announce tomorrow that they’re going to shoot 10,000 people at random as a warning not to oppose them. And that this would happen within 3 days. The Democrats would say, “This is why we need to vote in November everyone!”
If we're doing the best job on COVID-19, forget cases, why do we have the most deaths? More than China &amp; India combined, who have a combined 9x more people than we do! Why has no Obama\Biden official been indicted, convicted or pled guilty? Can trump say the same? HELL NO!

This week is when I put up my Trump 2020 yard sign and flag. My neighbor directly across the street voted for "Feel the Bern" in 2016.

No. Much better to choose a running mate who isn't in the Senate rather than risk losing a Democratic Senate seat. We not only need to dump tRump, but also flip the senate.

Most establishment media polls show President Donald Trump trailing in a matchup with Joe Biden, but a closer look at the data shows that these polls are built to discourage Trump voters from showing up.   Today’s polls look an awful lot like 2016.

That laugh out of fear of coming out on the wrong side of things. They know Trump will put them in their place then or through other means. Obama gave in to nearly every demand from other nations. I’d rather have a leader not cow-towing every chance they get.

It is on MSNBC. Rachel Maddow did a lengthy segment on it. She even pointed directly at Grassley and Johnson as recipients of Russian lies to malign Biden.  They're in effect, Russian assets working on behalf of Trump.
Big big bullshit. The ACA already does this. Trump, while pushing to abolish the ACA in court, is making a stupid political ploy to take credit for something Obama has already accomplished.

The abortion rate in the USA has been dropping steadily since 1980 -- under both Dem and Rep presidents -- so you're making progress. However, it's still the law of the land with Trump, so it doesn't seem he's been very effective doing God's work with respect to abortion.
OK, you do know that abortion is still legal in the USA. Trump hasn't changed anything in 3 1/2 years.
Biden was against Roe vs Wade when it first passed, primarily because of his Catholic upbringing. He changed his public opinion for political reasons. Trump was pro-Choice in 2000 before he decided to run for office; he changed his public opinion for political reasons.
What difference does it make which religion a President is? Trump is obviously an atheist, and that doesn't seem to bother you.
Well he shouldn't have been nominated. Same thing Trump supporters do. The American people shouldn't have to decipher what he means.
No way in he'll I vote for Trump but only blind person haven't noticed his decline. Stop treating people like they are idiots.
well one thing for sure your buddy will be convicted in the near future ? It’s a coming!!!! Trump lap dog!!!!
David, Solomon &amp; Cyrus all lived before Christ &amp; didn't have the benefit of his teachings. None were Catholic. Are you saying that you support Trump because he's an instrument of God? Wouldn't that be true for anyone in the office, especially if he's a real, practicing Catholic?
True. Not since Bush Sr. unless you count the National Guard. But Trump's "bone spur" deferrals were B.S. Biden's were for asthma, which wasn't much better. Just goes to show, it's a big club, and you &amp; I aren't in it.
Trump's comments about Senator John McCain -- who actually, served, was shot down and spent time in a POW camp while severely injured &amp; was tortured -- were shameful.
When a REAL soldier presented Trump with a Purple Heart as a gift, Trump grinned &amp; said, "I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier.” I consider this comment an insult to anyone who's ever been awarded a Purple Heart.
"Catholics for Trump" is an oxymoron. You can't be both. He worships $$$. He doesn't read the Bible or attend church. He lies constantly. He's been married 3 times &amp; cheated on each of them. He's a walking case of the 7 deadly sins. Please. Someone Catholic reconcile this for me!
What did Obama do for prison reform? Nothing. Atleast Trump did something. And you can have law and order without sending someone to prison for life. The rioters should be held accountable. I never heard Trump asking for life sentences. And most of the rioters are white.
Yes, obviously you don't know anything about my God, because He is all forgiving and loving, unlike all the people trying to destroy President Trump because of their hate.  Hate is the destruction of people and the work of Satan, so perhaps you should check yourself.  God Bless
Black children have the same opportunities that all other races in America have. My grandchildren go to school with children from many different countries &amp; they are all treaded equally. All of this racial crap started because of people trying to destroy America &amp; hate for Trump.
I agree Trump fits those nationalist values except for "work for what you get." Trump... work??? 🥴
How can honestly say Trump doesn’t care about black people. He had lowest black unemployment ever. He signed the 1st Step act, securing the release of MANY Black prisoners, and gave more funding to historically black colleges and universities than any President ever before him.
President Trump was told by members of the democrat party to let them mourn in peace. They didn’t even want him to give his condolences, but he did. And also, Obama took the time to use the funeral as a campaign rally.

Trump is the Alpha Omega of Worst Presidents. The end all be all
I didn't lose an election, I wasn't running.  And no one complains more about the 2016 election than Trump.... and he won it.
Or, the comparison is there to show how Trump isn't seeking unity but to be a dictator.  Again, someone saying Trump isn't good for the country isn't someone seeking to be divisive, they just may be pointing out that he is.
And it isn't just one person who's made that comparison.
Mussolini was a Fascist, and the one who coined that term as if it were a good thing.  Trump does have a lot of comparisons, seeing as how he's an ultra-nationalist populist leader... just like Mussolini.

Trump made hate profitable again.
Sometimes, but that's not how I use the term, especially when talking about Trump.
Often Trump doesn't come up until the press starts asking questions about him.
The logical breakdown is that he encourages the division between party lines across this country, while Nancy talks more about specifics on issues and how Trump is divisive as opposed to all Republicans everywhere.
Listen to her speeches, she talks about Trump as little as she can, and prefers to focus on the topic of that speech or press conference.  It's just those clips that get replayed on the news because they have a broader appeal to viewers.
Party Politics did it, over the course of time since the country was founded, but it has gone to a level I've never seen since 2016.  Listen to how she speaks at her press conferences and compare that to Trump at his, and let me know which you think speaks more divisively.
That's one of those propaganda viewpoints.   Trump isn't responsible for anything he didn't do, or anything the government did before he was elected.  And I haven't seen anyone in politics blame him for those things.
One of the key aspects to our Government is that our Government officials and Military don't swear an oath to any person, but to the Nation.  Trump acts like he's the head of Congress, but he isn't, they are a separate body of government.
Not caused the harm that Trump has done in 3.
but i guess republicans didn't want to get anywhere near November. Even though having everybody somewhat satisfied in November would have probably been better for trump.. but they would rather battle the democrats.
I would say that it's more accurate than the definition being peddled by Trump and his cronies.  And again, as their fame grew the people claiming to be Antifa grew, so I don't think that they are all organized even in small groups.

If Trump and his buddy oligarchs consolidate all the power around themselves it will be just as bad as all those ism fears put together, and the US as we know it will be gone.
It seems to me that many Republicans in DC have lost their way from being conservatives to being conspiracy theorists and supporters of oligarchs like Trump, which is disturbing to me.

Can’t here! I’m good with it! I’m #VotingBiden2020  I have a mask! I’ll wear it to vote trump out!
You love your animal! It’s all good! Two dogs, two cats and five chickens! We all love/like we like! HOWEVER, tRump hates everyone and anything,! After he goes to jail.... he will go to hell!
Will I be voting for him? Yes. Am I happy about it or do I attend rallies or post about him on social media? Nope. Yet, I’ll vote for a rock before I vote for Trump so 🤷‍♂️.
If Donald Trump is the antichrist then well hes funny. I think I can fucks with him and convince him not to chip everybody.
People who don’t vote because they don’t like Joe are putting Trump back in there that is so stupid or because they don’t want a black woman back to Trump we must vote we must vote come on people vote
I have. Trump is a predator. I’m not going to pretend otherwise. The only two people groups he doesn’t go after are nazis and white supremacists. He’s went after the disabled community, which I’m apart of. 1/2
The hand sanitizer people? Trump is an insane juvenile.
I’m not an American first. I try to be a follower of Jesus, first. I would hope the same for a faith leader. I don’t think there’s anything to “celebrate” by being a Trump voter, especially if you’re a faith leader.
Chris Wallace! You have said to President Trump and Jason Miller about Medicare for all,New  Green deal, Socialist, I wouldn’t be surprised if Defund Cop because under feed back from Bernie Sanders, AOC! Joe is keeping in secret until if he President but not happen!
They do get blamed for their actions, just as we blame Trump for his. He should be making better decisions and wording things in a less controversial way.
A biblical miracle Mary Trump doesn’t need extensive therapy being in such close proximity to those demons.   If that was me. I already be rocking in a padded cell murmuring repeadelty  “what about her emails. What about them?”
Trump is tearing families apart, on the southern border, in the suburbs, nation wide.   And now his bringing coronavirus along on his 50 state death and destruction tour.
No problem. All 4 of my siblings are against Trump. A major relief. Trump is tearing families apart, at the border, in the suburbs, nationwide.   Have a great evening.
In 2016, discussion even debate.  Now, instant Trump 2020.  No reasoning. No changing. Brainwashed.   Spooky is feeling guilty, confused and scared for questioning. An extremely irrational negative response is scary.   I avoid in person Trump discussions in LA.
This belief of mine is a major reason why I will never vote for Trump, he does not see all Americans as equals. To him, only his supporters are patriots, only those who love him love their country.
Should be a pretty eye opening experience. People wouldn’t be doing that if it was just a regular presidential candidate, trump is just complete ass and doesn’t deserve such a position
I live in LA. Everyone is for Trump. All my friends for Trump.   I didn’t have strong feelings in 2016. I just recommended voting for Hilary. I was naive to “deplorables”.   Fast Forward 3 1/2 yrs. Friends changed. Brainwashed. A switch flipped overnight.   Honestly. It’s spooky.
Trump is the fallen one?
Democratic Congress is one push negative advertising about hydroxychloroquine, several doctors said it helps! Remember Coronavirus is New we never see like this! Want blame someone put on China Democratic Socialist! President Trump doesn’t want anyone passing, life matters!
trump really said “I don’t want them to find out about me destroying the nationwide covid testing program we came up with, so tell them I’m gonna delete Tik Tok again LMAO”
In case you're having trouble following, this particular thread is about the "lie" that he was going to have a better, more affordable healthcare plan to replace Obamacare. Also, I believe there are around 18,000 other lies or misinformation from Trump that have been documented.
I never followed politics. Trump is bad, really bad. I got involved.   I am unaware to the evolution of Republicans. You have been there to see Republican lizard grow fangs, longer tail and into the Dinosaur Demon it is today.   I’m just realizing Demon Dinosaur exists. YIKES!
Saw pics of a local pastor at a trump rally Sat. Friend asked if I was surprised. Foolishly,yes. I’ll always want &amp; expect better from people,no matter the evidence that proves otherwise. I’ll always come back to hope. It might be after I yell &amp; curse at the heavens but still.
We need a President but don’t have to be a President to do better than Trump &amp; Co.   A high school principal with his Skoal dipping football coach could provide better daily Covid marching orders than Donald.

Reagan was pretty tough on Russia. Arguably tougher than you Mr. Trump.
There is no reason I can think of which would make me vote in a way that doesn't help remove Trump.
I’d be concerned if I was Mr. Trump. The kids are really smart. And they are none too pleased with Mr. Trumps behavior.
Whoever Biden carefully picks will be MUCH better than who we have now. Pence is spineless and tRump is a lying crook who is only looking out for himself. If you love your country, you will vote for the best and decent man, Joe Biden. We cannot have 4 more years of this insanity!
If Trump were not on the ticket, I would probably write in Elizabeth Warren ;-P
Because Trump...
We sure as hell aren’t turning it back over to you Joe. You and Barry most destroyed our country. If you want to make a statement, come out of your basement and debate Trump.
That's ignorant! We've been able to worship anything our entire lives. Trump isn't even a Christian. Trump=fake
Pence is thinking about Trump pounding into his ass like a pile driver!
I would like Obama as Attorney General and his only focus is prosecuting Trump continuously.
That is fucking unacceptable. Fauci even said something about it yesterday. He said anyone that tests should be quarantined till they get results. I can't understand why Trump STILL can't grasp the basics of this shit

Liar, just like Trump
Trump picks fight with middle school tweens over TikTok. The bully we didn’t know we hated.
No, but you are talking about Trump while showing Biden telling a story about how he was onboard with State Department policy.
You shouldn't set out to be non resist, and I haven't set out to manipulate anyone. I just think that a. we need to speak the same language and b. Trump is a criminal and is more interested in helping himself than Republicans or Americans. We can disagree on b. but not a.
Right!? Biden hasn't done anything to earn my vote. Just because "he not Trump" or "vote blue no matter what" doesn't cut it. I want someone with great policies. Biden is just the blue version of Trump.
You better rethink support for Trump because the left with Biden wants to take Jesus away from the people, make it "offensive" to others to publicly worship Jesus, or to keep in schools. They'd rather teach islamic faith than Christian...insanity
They are both making mistakes like that. Trump said Colorado borders with Mexico.
You mean the pedophile joe sniffy Biden or the prostitute vp
Biden isnt President yet. You're supposed to be the leader . You're incapable of that though
That's yr mistake then, you watch our news. We Americans know our news media since the 80's has tried to help Democrats, now internet and corporations are joining. This is the tell tell that he is the right man for President. If he was Joe Biden, know one we give a shit
Biden can’t even attempt to match Trumps energy and thought process.
If we could locate Biden then I'm sure he'd do the same.

There are a lot of things being overlooked by the media/DNC - child trafficking?  Murder of 5 year old children? Biden's insufficiency?  Harris' competence/cruelty?  New Peace Deal in the Middle East?  Yeup, plenty of news, just no journalist to be found.
Lesser of two evils is right. Biden helped Big Banking by voting to almost obliterate Ch 7 bankruptcy. What a great move for the little guy.
No sir. The job of elected officials is to work for those who elected them not those who bought them. I'm saying we have a better chance getting legislation passed that actually helps the people more with Biden/Harris than this selfish idiot we have now.
By calling Joe Biden Catholic, you insulted every Actual Catholic
President Trump is the most pro-life President we’ve ever had. Did you know that Biden and Harris both support abortion for any reason up until birth. You might want to reconsider who Biden really is.
As in, if Biden was Trump he would take a marker to cross out anyone who didn’t vote for him on the map
I call this “If Biden was Trump”
Yeah, actually it is.  Life itself is the single issue, for without it all other right don’t exist.  Their is a hierarchy of right and life is first and foundational. Voting for Biden would be a mortal sin

Too bad Biden/Harris wants to take it away and raises taxes! I really want to see them take away our right to bear arms

Whatever lady. You sound like a Trumper. I’m a proud Biden-Harris supporter Democrat . I’m sure they wouldn’t relish the fact that sickness has fallen on their opponents brother.
I’m an African-American female Democrat! I support Biden-Harris. Why do you keep saying that like it will make it true. I just expressed decency for another human being, his brother. I don’t like Trump.

Wow! I hope you someone shows mercy to you when you need it. I agree with you about Trump, but I’m not going to wish harm on anyone. 😢I’m for Biden but I still pray for Trump to have change in his heart  as well. #lightindarkness
Your other option is TRUMP/PENCE. The flaming hot cheeto devil and milk toast bread. If they get reelected they will burn this country to the ground. I don't care for Biden/Harris either, but I'd rather them because I think we can pressure them for policies we want.

Is Biden coloring between the lines?
An Absentee ballot is different, Biden staffer
I’ve volunteered to make calls and texts for Biden campaign.  Bc I am in your boat too.
Elect Bill Clinton so Poppy Bush and Bob Dole won't hurt progressives any longer.  Elect Bill Clinton again so Dole-Kemp won't hurt progressives worse.  Elect Obama so McCain-Palin won't hurt progressives  Re-Elect Obama so Romney-Ryan won't hurt progressives  Re-Elect Biden so..
Sanders is less a fascist than Biden or Copmala or Hillary, but without a strong Indy Left to hold him accountable, even if he was elected POTUS he would nevertheless be pressured to enact fascist policy or get himself run.   It's not the players, it's the game.
Voting for  who does not, unlike Biden-Harris or Trumpster-Pence, support abandoning working people for cannon fodder of the 1%.  Also, building an Indy Left to replace the whole system.
But of course, even Cornel West ultimately succumbs to the "Gotta elect Biden-Harris to stop Trumpster!!!" bandwagon, because it's much more profitable to ride a mainstream bandwagon than to actually fight for radical change.  Again...  #NoOneWillSaveUsBUTUS
This is why Biden ultimately settled on nominating Copmala.  She gets the #HillbotPUMAs to whitewash what was soft Left opposition to Biden's politics, and neuters the Indy Left.  Hence, we get this apologia and tribute in response to NeoCON Louise Mensch.
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign likened Trump's comments and actions as "sabotage."
Sorry, but even if Kamala isn't what the Right is claiming her to be, she's still a neoliberal cop who opposes sex workers and jails poor Blacks.  You want to vote for her and Biden to stop Trumpster? Be my guest.  Don't flame on us Black Indy Leftists who choose other means.
If you want to tell me that we should only back Biden/Harris to stop Trumpster, then you damn well better also be backing Leftists in power replacing wingnuts and "centrists".   Otherwise, get outta my TL.
Oh yeah why did y'all pick Kamala Harris as VP for Joe Biden. She didn't do well in running for president. She didn't even bother to register in my State primary. My opinion they should of pick Bernie Sanders as VP running mate. Cause he was number 2 in primary well that's y'all
Them at all which is proven true just in this Twitter feed. Joe Biden blatantly lied to you yesterday about Charlottesville. I can debunk everything he said with a Transcript. They know you won't fact check them. All you see is Orange man bad like your in a deep hypnosis
Let’s not forget that literal members of the U.S. military came out with video evidence of U.F.O. ‘s; and that celebrities are sexually abusing kids. But by all means let’s talk about Donald Trump and Joe Biden👌🏻

Joe Biden isn't even qualified to be a greeter at Walmart at this point. And Kamala needs to work in Las Vegas  doing the only thing she's good at.
Trump and Biden are both bus driver. Biden has purposely ran over a black person and said nothing. Trump has purposely ran over a black person and yelled our "20 points"
Biden should have law enforcement at the ready for the day of his inaug. to literally round up these traitorous hypocrits &amp; arrest them all.
Joe Biden declares a mandate by the federal government for you to wear a mask for at least three months if not indefinitely. Are you OK with this? Are you going to be OK when they mandate you must get the vaccine or you will not be able to buy, sell, trade, or go out in public?

That sounds like Biden would defer to the states &amp; municipalities on direct relief, &amp; would limit federal aid to either tax credits (expanded EITC or child care) or an accrued fund that locals/states would be able to tap to distribute such funds, limited by "deficit concerns".
Since Biden has publicly said previously that he opposes even the basic idea of #UBI because he prefers that the only means of earning income should be a job, I would assume that he's a solid "NO" on this.
We’ve imagined more things that are complete and total bullshit in the last 3 months than Joe Biden and Barack Obama did in their 8 years in office.
If they are threatening him, doesn’t Biden have secret service protection from his time as VP?

I see these comments, and I'm wondering are all you people who is looking for Jesus Christ at the polls going still let Trump run us into the ground. I'm not a fan of Biden or Harris, but Trump has fucked up sports, school, taxes, had the military attack civilians etc. #GTFOTRUMP
you think Biden beats Trump? No way possible. if they wanted a fair fight they would have let Bernie run against him. instead they made him drop out and “advise”.
Donald Trump gone beat Joe Biden by a landslide. May be the most lopsided victory in the history of the US. Do with that information what you will.

second thoughts on kamala: biden saw her as a safe, centrist choice and the republicans wouldn’t be able to say his administration was the gateway to a socialist america, but they would have done it with any one of the picks so why not go big?
So.....The defund the police side picked two cops - Biden and Harris - to lead them to victory?   You can’t make this stuff up, it’s 2020 y’all   🤯
Joe Biden couldn't have secret service assign women to his detail because he would grope them or purposely walk around naked in the VP house when Jill wasn't around and he owns Waters island next to Epstein's island with similar set up.
Trump's Unholy Cult, has no legs to stand on in this argument. Biden Is Catholic
not to mention biden knows he aint got the gas to hold out for four years so he KNOWS at some point kamala will be taking over. just preemptively putting a cop in charge of a nation actively fighting a police-state
"biden is electable! we just need to worry abt the centrist/right leaning vote!" *major historical events radicalize entire nation into leftists* *leftists dont vote for biden* "no wait" maybe he was never electable to begin with, and the only person to blame is dems themselves.
wheres all the leftist tweets abt how months of saying "biden is the electability candidate" was going on explicitly so that when biden lost the election due to not being electable at all they could then place the blame on leftists/bernie supporters bc i JUST saw it happen

Of course Biden chose a fucking cop as VP during the most anti-cop year. What a embarrassment
Fuck. That.  There will be NO Left influence in a  Biden-Harris admin, if they manage to even win. This is closer to Bill Clinton's 3rd term than Barack Obama's 2nd.  Leave this party behind and build our own.  #DemExit
The big takeaway I got from this, is that if the Dems win, she may well become the defacto leader of the Democratic party, especially considering Biden has referred to himself as a "transition" candidate multiple times.
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate
Yall know Biden died in February and is a hologram, right?
Ben Shapiro can say what he wants but that doesn’t mean everyone is convinced by it. It’s really hard to paint Biden as a radical Marxist and centrist voters don’t buy it.
The Democrats that are jumping up and down praising this pick are out of line. We had plenty of chances to pick someone who can win and displays democratic values but no, we pick Biden and Harris. A serial groper and a woman of color who locks up black men for misdemeanors.
So Biden picked the absolute weakest possible running mate great nbd
Y’all fail to realize kamala the most aggressive to help Biden win. Either you wanna keep trump or deal with what the man picked. Fk what y’all talking bout.
Biden picked his running mate, but I’m sure that didn’t come as a surprise

SO PSYCHED that Oakland’s own  will be our next Vice President!  Finally, a ticket that resembles our peoples and our values.   I’m ready to do my part to ensure that she and Joe Biden win this election!
"Joe Biden just picked the woman who called him a racist who hung out with segregationists, and who said she believed his sexual harassment accusers." Ben Shapiro
Only positive about Copmala is that her recent advocacy for recurring $2K checks didn't disqualify her with Uncle Joe and the ruling right-wing establishment of the Democrats.  Problem is, she's still a cop. And....an sworn enemy of sex workers.  And a perfect foil for Biden.
Why tf would Biden pick that cornball ass woman? 🥴🤦🏽‍♂️ trump in 4! Smh
All the AKA’s voting in November   Biden in 4 !
Biden picked the Indian woman, hmmm..

Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate? 😭
By choosing Kamala, Joe Biden &amp; the DNC are letting progressives know that they have no intention of giving us a voice.
Kamala Harris called Biden a racist during the debates 🤣 what a time to be alive
Maybe she’ll give Joe Biden his happy ending like she did Willie Brown good job Joe! Sniffy and iffy
Maybe she’ll give Joe Biden his happy ending like she did Willie Brown good job Joe

Joe Biden Announces Kamala Harris as VP Pick
Biden could’ve pick Viola Davis
let’s get Biden in office.
Forget Biden. Forget Pence. Kamala vs Trump debate. Pay per view. I would pay good money.
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket
Biden was basically my last choice, Harris was somewhere in the middle, but if by some miracle someone agrees to have debates, even just for VP candidates, I look forward to Harris ripping Pence an entirely new asshole, one in a place you didn’t even think an asshole could be.
Biden may not have been my choice for President, and Kamala wasn't a choice for me either. However, I am committed to making Trump a one-term President and support #BidenHarris2020
BREAKING:
Biden pick kamala. Tf took you so damn long. Knowing it was going this way
Joe Biden has chosen California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Boy, if Biden win this election... them Ks ain’t shutting up.

Kamala Harris is a cop 😭  She called Biden a racist on stage 😭
Can't believe Joe Biden stole the Vice Presidency from the Stacey Abrams.

Joe Biden has chosen his VP running mate, and his choice could be announced as early as today, CNN reports
and.......Biden forgot
Wait till Joe Biden and whoever they say his VP pick is lose in November.   Talk about cry
I wondered why Susan Rice was controversial. I now see why. I hope she isn't Biden's VP pick. From NYT - "She has been a sycophant to despots. She has been inept in her diplomacy. She has played politics with human rights and played realpolitik with the truth."

Here’s something I’m ready to laugh at. “If” Joe Biden doesn’t pick Kamala Harris, I will laugh for 3 days about all the money she wasted on plastic surgery   😭
Did Joe Biden pick his VP running mate yet?
No I'm not defending Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton. Never would either.
Give it up we all know Joe Biden can't be this coherent and is in severe mental decline would be replaced by VP picked by DNC  if he were elected which won't happen after his racist remarks and Nancy Pelosi saying China wants Joe  as president on tv .
Your kidding your voting for Sniffy the pedophile Biden.

Kamala can act surprised if she wants, she basically called Biden a racist during one of their debates.   I wonder if he told her “You ain’t black”   He is racist though lol
all Twitter opinions on Biden Veep are of no moment-Joe has to win, and he could pick Rudi Giuliani and we all would have to vote for him. It’s an existential issue for American Democracy. #trumpLies is the plague.

Biden leaving his basement is the Political Punxsutawney Phil.
At a minimum, the decision will shift the force of the campaign — at least temporarily — away from Donald Trump’s turbulent presidency onto Biden himself. That’s not a place many Democrats are comfortable.
Are people really worried about Joe Biden’s mental health? You think people would see Donald Trump doesn’t have a clue. And our country is suffering because of it!
We can’t let Joe Biden destroy the U. S.

That's fascinating.  My impression was that Copmala became more toxic to Biden and the Dems due to her recent advocacy of $2K/month and her alliance with Sanders and Markey, whom the establishment reject as too Lefty.  Didn't think the Willie Brown rumors would snap back so hard.
Harris for VP, Rice for SecState, Yates for AG, Duckworth for Veterans Affairs, Warren for SecTreas...
Well one of the signs you missed Joe Biden always redirect Questions why explain it I show  you it while making a racial slur to interviewer
How long do you think it will take Biden to undo all this crap Trump has done. Seriously, what’s realistic? Many webs to untangle. I’m just curious yalls late night thoughts.
And they are not fools, voting for Biden is a very sane thing to do. If you want America to be an authoritarian regime, Trump's your man. If you want a Free America, with the constitution as our guide, you Vote Joe Biden.
Biden has won
Its decision time for Joe Biden
Meanwhile Biden going back to the Basement..
Biden just can’t lie as he once did.
Susan Rice. That's who I think Biden will pick...but Kamala may be it.
Actually, Dore is partially sort of correct, since Biden himself has not really explicitly endorsed the #HeroesAct's provisions. We don't really know if he favors $600/wk up to January or not.
Of freedom and no puppet president which is why the DNC has picked Joe Biden .
No more and more people realize how Biden is mentally unfit for any office due to 2 surgeries for brain aneurisms back in the 80s. And the DNC are using him to handpick a president with the VP running mate.
Because I know they are rigged in favor of Biden . Plus when only 20 people attended a rally pre pandemic and the same amount watch a virtual one. Plus all y'all 🌊accounts work for Twitter.
Biden can't wipe his own ass anymore. #Trump2020
Hunter Biden’s dope woman
Ummmm....no.  This is NOT Trumpster "moving to the Left of Pelosi and Biden".  He's essentially faking a move "left" to sell an empty shell disguise of an essentially right-wing program.  That the Democrats are biting the bait by moving Right themselves does not change that fact.
Did Biden have training wheels and a airbag on his bicycle? 👻

When pressed by Errol Barnett of CBS News on whether he’d taken a cognitive test, Biden responded that the question was akin to asking the Black reporter if he would take a drug test to see if “you’re taking cocaine or not? ... Are you a junkie?”
No but they actually let him tweet and he suggested Trump is going to mine  Uranium in the Grand Canyon. Mark it Joe Biden officially lost his mind today and is mentally unfit .
Ok so y'all finally let Joe Biden tweet for himself . Wtf Uranium in the grand canyon .   Mark it Joe Biden is officially lost his mind.They (everyone else who wasn’t actually here during Katrina won’t get this) - we definitely saw the signs firsthand.

He was, is and always will be a plagiarizer! Biden’s never had an original thought in his life! He secretly wants to be Trump cause,well WINNING!
so we can fully admit at this point what Biden said was unforgivable?
it's so funny when republicans respond to criticisms of trump with "wElL ObamA and BideN diD the SaMe ThInG!!" like ok?????? i hate them too where tf are you going with this
Having a headline with these two news stories but only one photograph definitely makes it seem like Joe Biden is the Golden State Killer.

Surprise!  Another white person trying to tell me how to vote!  You think Biden is Christian?  Have you heard the crap that comes out of his mouth?  You think Harris is Christian. I bet Mayor Brown's wife doesn't think so.  You are a faux Christian. Keep your racism to yourself.
I could not agree more!! Trump will not only expose them..also they to stop them. Which is why biden and Obama are so stuck on trying to win this election..
You do realize that Biden and Kamala are not “far left” right? Talk to any progressive - they are both centrist/moderate/corporate democrats - it’s why they were chosen.
It’s to show a contrast to Biden, who cannot function without handlers. They rush the press out so Biden won’t have to answer any questions. It’s a great strategy!
Right. Biden said "I could've told you to watch your⌚" or something close to that.
Explain how Joe Biden is a socialist
I'm counting on it! I believe Biden/Harris will NOT tolerate any more nonsense from him once they take office. I entertain myself remembering Harris question Kavanaugh; she was flawless, he was essentially bitch slapped by her... She's a warrior not to be fooled with... 👍
If Biden wins, I guess I will see you all at the camps. 🙄

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Sweden, Norway, and Denmark are successful. The fact of the matter is that Biden is not making the US turn to complete socialism. The fact is that he wants to save social programs. Right uses socialism as a "boogey-man" word to make people think we're going to be like Venezuela.
Biden has been in office since 1972  1972!  If that senile old white bastard knew how to fix anything he would have done something by now.  So you are so bent on removing the one man that both Democrats and a Republicans hated when he first ran you cant see the forest for the🌲🌲
You know that this stunt is what is going to cause you to lose— think of the irony... how you’re pissing off your own older constituents who order meds by mail... thank you for helping BIDEN win!
Lies, lies, lies.. It's so funny from a Senator that backs a president who is a loyal BUYER of China. Biden wants fulfill a FAILED Trump promise. Buy all "Made in America" products. Biden wants everyone to buy American made products. Oh, what happened to Trump taxing Wall Street?
So has virtually every other politician out there. Biden? Harris?  And he's not always wrong. Bringing troops home from Afghanistan isn't wrong. Moving the embassy to Jerusalem wasnt wrong. Sending troops to Portland wasn't wrong. He wasn't wrong about HCQ either.
Biden's not the President yet. Trump lies after 2 questions. Gets pissed when he's called on the lies and walks out Greta. Pay attention.
And we knew Biden was chosen because he was there to make Obama more palatable to white folks.
Your head is in the right place. I want to genuinely believe we have the same ideas in common.   Defunding police/End of surveillance militarized police state. End of systemic racism. End of the War on Drugs. M4A. Green new deal. LGBT rights.   Biden ain’t the answer my friend.
Where’s Biden?
Where was Biden’s integrity when he had to forfeit an election for plagarisim?   Where was Biden’s integrity when he befriended segregationists and used racism to further his career?  When he lied about being arrested in Apartheid South Africa?   I can keep going on and on.
Well, we know what’s happening: Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris lie repeatedly, and they don’t want to be held accountable. This ill-advised duck-and-hide-basement-dwelling campaign strategy is pitiful. It demonstrates how utterly weak Biden &amp; Harris are.

You're right that John Kasich may be the wrong choice, but the general strategy here seems right. Who could they get to Gen z + millennials excited about Biden so that they'll come out &amp; vote? They need someone not on the left. Maybe a bunch of centrist/right-leaning celebrities?
Now you’re actually making a viable argument, but I would say I can still fight my fight regardless of who the president is as we’ve seen with the recent BLM protests across the country. Like I already said, I agree that a biden presidency would be more open.
President Joe Biden. Inmate Donald Trump. Pass it on.
So again, why should I vote for joe biden?
I need him to win, but I can’t help him win with my vote. Which is why I tell voters who don’t like him but live in swing states that it is more logical to vote for joe biden, but that voters in safe states should vote 3rd party if they are dissatisfied.
Ok, so, then you should theoretically be able to understand my argument. Like, I understand what you’re saying I just disagree with you and don’t really find the argument you pose that convincing. If I don’t need to vote for joe biden, and I don’t support him, why would I?
Funny, cause this seemed to happen pretty fast 🤔
this is just an infinite loop; as much as I tell you “I don’t support biden” for x, y, and z reasons and that even with those reasons, if I had lived in a swing state I would vote for him; you still cannot accept that I’m not voting for joe biden.
Biden already showed me his allegiances by having advisors who advocate for fossil fuels and fracking. At this point I think it’d be better for a climate strike to get things done under a biden administration than from the biden admin itself.
I was all in during the primary season.  But I found the handling of the primary debates, selective candidate MSM news coverage, &amp; Twitter Blue Checks favoritism unsettling.   Then, Dem establishment decided they didn't like the field &amp; enticed Biden to jump in. Didn't like that.
Lmao, you’re not persuading me by calling what I’m saying poison. Do you not understand that? Also, cool, he’s the best shot of getting something done, I agree, but I also think that nothing much will be achieved for climate under a biden administration.
No, do I really believe biden and other moderate democrats will keep my home city underwater? No. You know why? Their records and who they receive money from. Also, does it matter if I vote for biden or trump in my state? No.
Color me a non believer then.
This is the first smart thing the DNC has done in a while. No Democrats are voting for Trump. Time to make a play to get the independents and Republicans over to Biden/Harris.
I'm going to do what I can to get Biden/Harris elected.  But not sure what my future will be as Democrat after November 3rd.
Imma keep following you but I’m deeply disappointed that you’ve ignored the vast amounts of information showing Joe biden having ties to the fossil fuel industry through his climate advisors;also the fact that you completely ignore everything I’ve said,but that’s normal from libs
I don’t live in a swing state, if I did I would vote for Joe Biden. If you have to vote for joe biden to be able to follow a leading climate scienctist than they really aren’t worth my follow.
WHITE FOLKS &amp; THEIR RACIST GAMES try to pit Black and Brown people against each other. Will Indian-American Voters Turn Out For Kamala Harris? Biden’s running-mate won’t just be the First Black woman on a major party ticket, also the first Indian American.

Correct. Only both want to strip you of your vote. Hence why it’s so difficult for felons to reattain the right to vote. And who’s locked up more black people than Biden and Kamala? 🤔   Bro, Truth is both parties couldn’t give a fuck about Black Lives. Only Black Votes.

I don't care what anyone says.  If Biden wants someone to speak ....they will speak.  Disappointed.
Hey Comrade Rose Emoji. In November, one of two people is going to win the election, and I ASSURE you, you don't want it to be Trump. So effing STOP trying to suppress the Biden vote already. Seriously. You're playing a deadly game.

Yes all policies have trade offs and I hate my insurance as well. You are correct though that there were some losers and I personally was one. Under Biden I believe we will increase Medicaid eligibility to 200 FPL and sell Medicare and Medicaid on the marketplace.
Not to change the subject, but I am surprised no one is following the money on the Obama/Biden Iran payoff.  I strongly suspect Iranian kickbacks to Democrats made that happen.
You cannot deny that the ACA occurred under Biden's VP and since I work in healthcare equity for a living I can say it's impacts have been significant. He wants to build on it, I want a more universal option, but trump has a pipedream that you can let the free market handle it.
I can't speak well to how Biden has failed to address the needs of minority communities throughout his career, and I can educate myself better on that. I do know that the ACA, as imperfect as it is, created considerably more equity in healthcare than any previous healthcare law.

i can't believe all these people are just coming out and saying that the main reason to vote for joe biden is that he is not donald trump! like what a shitty pitch!
ge can stir up chaos and confusion and doubt and undermine the election, but in the end, I do believe he will be out in January. It’s mostly a matter of people voting democrat up and down the ballot. Biden and Harris will have their work cut out for them &amp; will NEED the houses

My hunch is Biden would want one Republican in his cabinet, like Obama with Ray LaHood, as a gesture of unity.  Sitting members of Congress are tainted as Trump enablers.  Romney is the only exception, and he’d need 1 of the big 4.  Baker? Kasich? Hogan?

The Dems wanted to send another $1,200.00 stimulus out. Or was it $2000.00 a month for several months. The Dems wanted to keep the $600 and the Reps wanted a sliding scale or $400 a week in UI. I was a Republican, the Dems care more! Reps are losing votes! Biden new POTUS!!!
That was always the plan. The plan was never to run on making things better in any real way, Joe Biden promises a change in aesthetics and nothing else.
I cannot understand why you pretend like trump and biden run identical policy platforms like obviously that’s just not true there’s a very clear difference... like ???

Joe Biden was 10 years old when the state of Delaware banned public whipping.  Not sure whether this says more about Biden's age or how fucked up Delaware is.
why can’t we have someone making this kind of sense working on Biden’s campaign? Sigh
Aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves here? She's the Democrat nominee for vice-president, and to project her as the front-runner for 2024 - or something happening to Biden is just speculating without tangible backup
Joe Biden should nominate Hillary Clinton to be the next Attorney General.
Only a coward sacrifices the future for immediate short term relief. If Biden wins we extend the neolib status quo at least another decade &amp; remind all the Obama/Trump voters why they switched leading to Trump 2.0 - better to suck up 4 more years &amp; get real change in 2024.
So......another local tv station showing their never Trump side, why don’t you see why Biden won’t or can’t answer any questions? Huh?
I’m voting for her more than Biden.

Nope never too late, we always need more medics  Also a wild card, unsure of whether a Biden administration would roll back the Trump administration's policy or also shooting medics, or if that would continue. Given Obama's handling of Occupy I'm not optimistic but who knows
That's wild! She looked exactly, and I mean EXACTLY, like Joe Biden that whole time she was Obama's VP. WAIT. IF SHE CAN DO THAT, WE WILL NEVER KNOW IF ITS HER OR BIDEN IF THEY WIN!!!!  THAT'S F'D UP!!! 🔁🔀💥‼️
To be fair Biden is a Democrat, and given that Democrats cave to fucking everyone else he might be somewhat more likely to cave to the demands of the coming climate riots
In short, if you don't have the votes to get a Congress that can enact M4A, then there would be nothing Biden could do in order to implement it anyway.
I mean I wish Biden supported M4A. Maybe people who support M4A could elect a congress that would pass the bill and put it on his desk (with assurances it would be paid for, which was his requirement)   That doesn't mean I am not voting for him.
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden could do a live Internet donkey show, as a fundraiser, at this point, and I'm still voting for them.

Hey mark!!! Why didn't Obama/Biden fix the post office 3 1/2 years ago? Bet I dont get a response. 🙄
Yes.  Why didn't Obama/biden fix it 3 1/2 yrs ago?
Perhaps it's because Biden and the dems aren't properly reaching out to those voters?  Bernie in 2016, tulsi, and yang, all were able to speak to them better.   Villifying them, lecturing to them about privilege, etc, doesn't get those voters on our side.
Or Biden,  that would be like the walking dead! Haha
Nope. Joe Biden did some things too. I don't like everything any president did in his personal life, I just know he has done more to help this country than most of them.

KAMALA HARRIS AND JOE BIDEN ARE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER.
The difference here is that  “requested” a ballot, which request comes after certain protocol(s) are met and the ballot is registered. It is not the result of a “mass mailing.” C’mon, Mr. Biden, you’re misleading the public.  MASS MAILINGS are not legal nor safe.  🇺🇸USA🇺🇸
what has Biden explicitly stated he would do that's any different from Trump. quickly
Nope.  The post office destroyed itself.  Why didn't obama/biden fix it?

I can't believe somebody tried to use  Assata as a justification for voting for Biden in my mentions
Trump is not right of Reagan. Bushes were moderates, just like Clinton. Old Biden was moderate, but this isn't his policies. He's completely controlled by the progressive Marxist faction of the party now. And Biden's way more corrupt than Trump.
You are right except you can't vote for Joe Biden right? 🤔😭😂

Sick to death of being lectured about this. 1. I always vote, even in the other not popular elections. 2. I live in Louisiana. Trump has this state easily even with a fully operational postal system. 3. If Biden loses it's 💯 on the Democrats hands for appeasing the rich.

I've also seen that bus analog about a hundred times too and I want to snarkily retort with "Well Joe Biden didn't believe in bussing"
Vote for Biden if you don't want anything to fundamentally change in this country.
Fuck anonymous ill go on any record with my views on this.  As a vet and a 18 yr letter carrier no one will bottle up my opinion.  Im very vocal about this.  Im going so far as telling Republicans on my route who i see that i need them to vote for Biden to preserve my job.

I never advocated for Biden. I had one point. Trump did not permanently fund HBCUs. One program was permanently funded by Congress, less than 15% of all HBCU funding.

That's a close one!  Kamala, Biden, Romney?  Too close to call!
As opposed to taking money from Russia (Hillary) and specifically Ukraine (Biden)?  Trump doesn't take a salary. He can't be bought, unlike Kamala who will blow you for the right job.  She acknowledges that in her affair with married Mayor Willie Brown.
I find those pod bros and their friends to be rather insufferable. They mocked and criticized him the whole way, and now look where Biden's at. They're not worth the trouble.
Just like Biden, Kamala is unethical and will do anything for power including sleeping with her married boss which she acknowledged and justified.  Both Biden and Kamala caused the increased incarceration of young blacks for non-violent misdemeanors.  Scam artists. #Blacks4Trump
If you don't know by now, then I feel sorry for you. If you don't vote for Biden, you support Trump.
Putin would be better than Biden.
(18/18) So yeah...hold Biden &amp; Harris accountable for addressing their past errors in judgement or character but don't for a second be pulling this crap where you're positioning them as a "bad" option when the alternative is SO much worse. Or do you want another 4 years of Trump?
(7/18) ...but in the absence of cooperation and collaboration, they aren't able to benefit from the others' perspectives or insights. I highly recommend everyone read Bill Bishop's "The Big Sort" if they have a problem with the Biden/Harris ticket being imperfect.
(6/18) Biden and Harris arent perfect but you what? They a helluva lot better options than the alternative and we should use their time in office to fight for real change on both sides of the aisle because there are ideas that both Republicans and Democrats have that are good...
(1/18) I don't get why ppl are so obsessed with finding every little thing that Biden or Harris did that didn't perfectly live up to the ideals of Now. I'm not pretending it didn't happen or that they shouldn't be pressured to improve on those past positions but...WTH?

I really don't think we could ever start a revolution without the liberals. there has to be some way we can show them how bad corporate democrats are. And that's my point, biden will not solve anything, which will show them that he does not care for the working people
I think that we need to take it down from the inside. elect biden, then show liberals how terrible he is too. this way democrats finally understand that the issue isn't trump, its both of our political parties.
This is such a joke you have someone 8 months debating how Biden isn’t the right pick for president then yesterday on tv saying he’s what real leadership looks like 🤮 it makes me so in raged that these people are allowed to just lie after lie and bubble people believe this crap
With you.  If kasich wants to help, he should campaign with biden in ohio. The convention is where dems say “This is who we are, these are our values”. Forcing women to give birth are not values we share.
Not everyone is “crazy” about Biden. But he and Kamala represent normalcy and progress. And Any vote other than for Biden is a vote for 4 more years of destruction &amp; death.

Hey even if trump did say nazis were fine people, which he didnt!!!, its no different than biden and fake news saying antifa and blm are fine people right, so freaking hypocritical p.o.s.

So if they get Biden out of the way and Kamala is not eligible does the presidency go to Nancy?

Joe Biden Calls For Nationwide Mask Mandate 'Immediately' | HuffPost. Trump’s Virus
Mike  Church is #LIVE: What if the #HarrisBiden Ticket Were an Old TV Show? Biden &amp; The Broad, Crappy Days, Saved By The Hell &amp; Biden's Demand For Universal Masking Is Just "B-Roll" For An October TV Ad "Trump Killed Grandma"!
No.  Not true. Her term expires Jan 03. Succession would fall to the President Pro Tem of the Senate. Right now that’s Grassley but, with no election the new senate would be Blue and they would elect a new President Pro Tem.  They can elect anyone, even a non senator.  BIDEN!
Trump and Biden trade barbs over coronavirus response, masks
People wonder why nothing sticks to Biden,  its because of this. Its only a scandal if MSM repeats it often enough.  Otherwise,  its memory holes. I've noticed no one even says what exactly he is accused of having done. At most harassment is repeatedly referred to as assault
Biden is an idiot
If Biden loses its the Democratic Party's fault. Especially Barack Obama.
Once Biden got the nomination what the fuck did people expect? I'm glad he didn't pick Kasich or some other dumb white dude
Convincing yourself that Biden or Harris are mommy and daddy or good people in anyway shape or form is deranged.
55 Things You Need to Know About ⁦ #KamalaHarris  #KamalaForVP  #KamalaForThePeople  #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
Didn’t the CDC recently release a study stating masks do ZERO on stopping droplets! And that the kind that goes around your neck increases the spread of droplets by 110%! FOLLOW SCIENCE Unless it contradicts our NARRATIVE! TRUTH OVER FACTS- Joe Biden!!
hope Biden/Harris see this
He also said he would not get behind Biden or Harris but is now endorsing that ticket! He like almost all Democrats are hypocrites and liars!!
Biden is better than you.
Let me be clear.  There are no ethical reasons to support or vote for #Trump.   There's only one ethical reason to vote for #Biden, and that's to eliminate Trump from office.  Even though that doesn't absolve him of criticism, remember that when addressing neoliberals.
You should absolutely not be surprised that Bernie supports Biden just like he's supported clinton.  Bernie is who he is, which is better than 99% out of everyone else in government.  He's playing the game on the inside, so that you can play the game on the outside
How about the post office not going thru their money like they do...any other business is responsible for their finances. They are a private organization, not to mention the letter carriers union endorsed Joe Biden. Stop election fraud...vote in person, with an ID!!!!.
As soon as you bring up biden's rape allegations and kamala's cop history, they abandon ship.  Neo liberals are starting to get more predictable than maga.  Fuck em.
Should have thought about that before you backed biden.   Don't let the doorknob hit you on the way out, son
1- and the chicaneries of the DNC is the number one reason why more people chose biden. 2- if you had confidence that Biden would win, you wouldn't be worried about anyone calling him on his bullshit. Biden is not the default candidate.  Hit those phones, son.
Dear followers,  Anybody can get it.  Trump and Biden will be dunked on here.  If you have problems with this, you know where the unfollow button is.   I have spoken.
If you going to be on my timeline with that "fall in line" bullshyt, you're definitely going to have a bad time.   Trump is absolute garbage,but Biden is worthy of critique, and this is exactly what's going to go down here for the next four years at least.  Make your preparations
There is some truth in that, I'll admit. But I still think Biden is boring enough to not make the reaction back to the right as violent. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I just think the country would benefit from a sleepy 8 years.
Republicans have no game against Joe Biden or Kamala, so the best smears they can come up with are: "THEYRE the ones responsible for the racist "riots" and covid."  Even though it's obviously themselves. Biden isnt even in office yet, fucking damnable, moronic jackasses. 🙄
I mean there are a lot of people who support a vast majority of what the Biden platform stands for. To write that off because many of them would also like to see #M4A and #GND is frankly short sighted. But at the end of the day, yeah, one major party is better than the other.
I feel your pain..I told my husband if he doesn't vote for Biden, I will divorce his ass..LOL. I told him that Trump did not create the greatest economy and asked him how many stock shares that he is hiding because I haven't seen any LOL! So I told him to lay off the economy bit!
I get your frustration, we are all frustrated and beatdown with this psycho in office. I was GOP vtr (stupid) and am no longer. I do respect the progressives/Dems uniting and putting differences aside because getting Trump out is the main goal. Biden/Harris is the bus in a sense.
I do understand how you feel, I do get that honestly but voting for someone else other than Biden or not voting is a win for Trump. They are looking for us to be negative towards Biden/Harris as ammo. We need to get Trump out then move on to have someone else to run in 2024.
Vote for Biden because that is the ONLY way to get Trump out of office logically speaking. Then everyone can work on the next 4 years for their choice to run. In order to have that happen, we HAVE to get Trump OUT! Voting for someone else or not voting is giving Trump 4 more yrs.
I just heard Colbert say Biden/Harris is so centrist, that when he was young they would have been “considered Rockefeller Republicans.”  My head almost exploded.  Her Senate record is to the left of Sanders and Biden is at this point the most progressive POTUS candidate ever.
Why Blacks should Vote None Of The Above? Well both Biden and Trump are against Reparations for Foundational Black Americans and defunding the Police...so what are Blacks truly voting for...🤔
Endorse Biden. Put up or shut up.
He’s just Biden his time...😂
Blacks who are running to vote for #Biden only to get #Trump out of there just want to go back to sleep in that Post-Racial Dream Matrix...😴 #NoAntiBlackRacism
While you nit-pick all things you don’t like about Biden and Harris, remember that you voted for Obama who was against gay-marriage. It was only after Biden’s “gaffe” that he “evolved on his decision.”
Americans need to wakeup. With Biden in office, the only money Americans will have is what the government lets you have. People want everything free, how do you think the government is going to pay for it? Higher taxes, retirement money, property, and etc. Look at Cuba!
Black People: But #Biden &amp; #Harris said they're not going to do nothing SPECIFICALLY for Blacks.  Silly Negroes: Who cares...go vote!!!
That lil press conference today with liars Biden &amp; Kamala was just a preview. Two sociopathic baby killing, authoritarians with a lust for power and contempt for half the country. Tucker is right. They hate us &amp; they want to punish us for voting for DJT &amp; IF they get power 🇺🇲dies
It’ll end up being Biden at one of the debates. If they happen.

Someone referred to Jill Biden as Lady Macbeth, a very ambitious woman!
If the DNC platform was Medicare for all, legal weed, and included outright pro-firearm language, Biden would drive record turnout and win by 300 electoral votes and 15 million popular votes.

We are experiencing the 4th turning. Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
You mean like the ones they asked Biden today? Oh wait
Also Biden was not my 1st choice but at least he is trying to change. His new plan came to fruition directly with Sanders and Warren. Saying negative things about Dems is exactly what Trump wants.
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  via
A Forbes reporter pointed out to West that he won't be on the ballot in enough states to secure the Electoral College votes needed to win. "I’m not going to argue with you. Jesus is King." Pressed on the chance that he might take votes from Biden he replied, "I’m not denying it."
If you're ever called to be polled, make sure to tell them you'll be voting for Biden. It'll make November that much more painful for them!!
Sure, ok, I get what you say. I’ve not heard of Trump in the news lately groping, raping,etc. anyone. Biden is videoed grabbing little girls as they move away from him, touching them in any manner, making them uncomfortable. Surely, you see the difference. If not, # heresyoursign
That’s the issue here in Louisiana - liberals are scared to show their “liberal pride”. My mom has a Biden 2020 mask and we went to the store and some guy was calling her a fucking idiot and to get out of the country if she doesn’t like it here (she’s from here?) it’s intense.
Seems like Sedaris is talking about people who can't decide whether to vote for Trump or Biden. People not voting for either are pretty decided.
Why has the MSP not asked for Biden’s medical records. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Because the msm doesn't want to take the spotlight off of Kamala &amp; Biden.
If you’re gonna accuse Biden of something, you should at least try to accuse him of something he actually did, instead of just making up shit out of thin air &amp; throwing it out there. This is so ludicrous it’s Twilight Zone material. It just makes you look desperate &amp; foolish.
Live Campaign commercial* (For Biden)
Kamala Harris is still a cop and I will still not be voting for Joe Biden but best of luck to them
At this point, Joe Biden could fall out of Air Force One, break his neck, and have them stand him at the podium, like, “Weekend at Bernies,” and I’d still vote for him
I will absolutely risk getting this virus to cast my vote in person for Biden/Harris.
Biden’s President candidate run is the mask wearing President. He is using a worldwide pandemic for political gain but continues to not answer questions and say what it is that he would’ve done better besides wear a mask which most states have made it mandatory a month ago
Lmao and you think Biden and Kamala are going to “handle corruption” ? Biden has been at the center of the legalized bribery for decades.
I could go on and on come on Biden supports name some accomplishments in 50 years I’m waiting
But you notice they said for at least 3 months the dems are using covid for political gain. Biden nor any other democrat can say what they would have done better during this pandemic. The dems have one agenda no matter how many Americans they take down and it hasn’t changed.
You have no clue what Biden thinks about the virus. You would never care to even look to find out. You’re so busy covering trumps ass.   We need tests with the fast results if you want to open our country back up 💁🏻‍♀️

No respect at all. I don't see journalists hounding OBAMA OR BIDEN over the LIES they did!
2/2 "Joe Biden was right and could have saved THOUSANDS of grandma's while Donald Trump did nothing and now many are dead. Grandma can't afford another 4 years of Trump, early, mail-in vote #HarrisBiden today &amp; save grandma!" These lazy pricks can't even conceal their cons now!

I don’t think anyone is enthusiastic enough about Biden to cyber bully
I excitedly told her about Kamala. She does not know who she is, and knows nothing about Joe Biden. I can’t decide  if I want to inform her, or just tell her not to vote.
Can't you SEE through this setup!? 1. Aug 13th, #CreepyJoe demands continent wide masks to "save lives" 2. In 60 days, in key states, we get the MOTHER of All Corona Spikes! 3. In 61 days, ads begin rolling for #HarrisBiden showing THIS tape with the caption "Joe Biden was 1/2
I'd really like to know how the NoMatterWhos think I'm going to vote for Biden (or anyone else) when my mail-in ballot is definitely going to be lost or not counted. Guess I better write my Republican congressman a strongly worded letter about supporting USPS, huh?
All they spread is lies she criticized the president about the economy but yet he’s the one that’s trying to get it open. Biden/Harris policy is mask wearing which is a joke because most states made it mandatory a month ago
Bret can be such a dick sometimes. Biden’s people would never get treated like that if they went on
Trump might say "Fox is Fake News.  I believe Maria Bartiromo has me ahead of Biden?"  She's fantastic."
Lmao they say trump is behind Biden on policing in the pre polls.
Please chip in today to help all Americans afford to pay their bills and not be evicted by calling for the passage of  bill in the senate for $2000 monthly stimulus payments for the duration of this crisis.
Seriously that is all that you have you and Biden are a joke.
"China prefers Biden"  -
You can vote for a man who had kept his word and made America first and done everything he said he would are vote a guy in on his mask wearing policy. Lol if Americans are really think 50 year Biden would be better for our economy after covid they are smoking crack
Can someone in here honestly say that 50 year joe would be better for the economy then trump after covid and the next 4 years. With Biden we will be invaded at a civil war homeless broke drug addicts no guns no freedom no medical insurance in a war just totally fucked
Joe Biden has advocated cutting Social Security for 40 years  by
just switched my political party affiliation from democrat to the green party, took 5 minutes online, super easy.  fuck the beyond corrupt GOP and fuck the corrupt DNC (yes I'm still holding my nose and voting for biden and kamala the cop).  can't wait for ranked choice voting
I think it should be AOC, with Warren as an early endorser and mentor. If it ends up being Kamala, she should do what Biden was too afraid to do and pick a progressive VP: AOC!
Text from the Blacks for Trump team just now: "Racial injustice ends when Joe Biden retires from public service. Vote NO on Joe!"  I've fact checked this claim thoroughly. Here's what I found:
Because Biden looking for one.

Speaking as someone who WAS a moderate Republican (now just a moderate) some of you guys just don't get it. I'll vote for Biden unless he murders someone on stage. But there is a real danger of people who despise Trump but hate Democrats just sitting this one out.
It wouldn't surprise me if  were nominated for federal prison after Biden-Harris kicks his ass in November.
She walks like her 🍌 is 10x bigger then #biden probably why he sniffs kids, its olfactory viagra for "sniff the truth way biden sniffs the youth" about to have a weird orgy at bohemian grove #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Listening to Biden and Harris gives me hope.
I find it particularly when people do this shit in states like Louisiana because it shows a clear misunderstanding of the electoral college. Like no amount of voting Biden is gonna make a difference down here so why even shame people? The state is gonna be red regardless.

Y’all. Offhand, do you know what Biden’s platform is? It’s been 8,389,124 years and I still don’t know 😭😭😭
Everyone still carrying on about this most states have made it mandatory trump does not control every state people. I would love to know what Biden would run on if there was no covid and they are now trying to make covid and the vaccine a race thing
So is Biden JS
Wait a second. Is Biden confused again and thinking he lives in China?
can joe biden read the room, copala harris? why her? anyways it’s better than trump, i hope.

I'm torn on this legit criticism when neoliberal Biden/Harris is certainly preferable to Trump facism. Perhaps this should be saved for a later date, don't see how this helps now.
Biden-Harris and the Democrats need to couch this in terms of ACTIVE MILITARY voting. Anti Post Office is Anti Troops.
More and more and more lies and propaganda from team Trump for the brainwashed sheep who support him. Biden is about to be our president. The real patriots are rising to get rid of Despot Don.

“Biden doesn’t support M4A” yes but at least he isn’t trying to KICK people off insurance. He isn’t trying to eliminate Medicare and Social Security. Let’s be pragmatic. Not idealistic.
Biden wants to reign in private prisons. Kamala is pushing for a New Green Deal. Biden is calling for racing the marginal tax rate. I can agree, this isn’t the ideal situation for progressives. But I’m scratching my head wondering how re-electing Trump helps our goals.
Just talked to my staunch Republican mom. She's voting Biden/Harris.   I'll be in the backyard digging my grave because I am 💀💀💀
Hopefully the Biden campaign will do better
Patriots this Peace Deal has to go Viral. Obama and Biden spent Billions and couldn’t Acchive Peace . The Country’s did not trust the Obama ,Biden Administration. Just like Qsaid world piece is coming. Trump 2020!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I hear that. Best pro-voting argument I heard was from AOC. She asked who do we want to have veto power &amp; power to appoint supreme court judges. On that front I can see why voting Biden would be harm reduction. But also electoral college means LA will be Republicans anyway so 🤷🏾‍♂️
Because a white male isn't getting chosen based on his race OR his sex. Biden specifically stated he wanted a women and a POC, rather than the best person for the job.
Did you know Ohio is a Bellweather state since 1860 Ohio has picked the winner except for Grover Cleveland, FDR and JFK That’s a damn good record I love my adopted state I know it will pick Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ! Don’t bet against the Buckeyes !!!
biden needs a proper meme team STAT
She also said she believed Tara Reid &amp; other women who accused Biden of sexual assault &amp; harassment.  Of course she believed Jussie Smollett too.
Black People are bashing Senator Harris more then Biden, please pay attention.
Yea biden supporters are so stupid.
Fun fact the fake news won’t tell you: this officer is an outspoken Joe Biden supporter.
Here some. good need news,Professor Alan Lichtman who predicted that Hillary Clinton would  lose and Trump would win His predictions have been on point for years. He also predicted that Trump would be impeached. He has predicted that Biden will win. Yay!

Fun fact: this officer supports Joe Biden. Thanks for the plug!
This is what Harris/Biden wants America last and fat pockets for the left
What people seem to forget in 2008 when the market crashed from the housing crisis Obama Biden gave the people $25 dollars but bailed out all the big banks and corporations they have 💩 to the people then the car dealers left to Mexico
If I thought voting for Biden and Kamala would make yall happy and shut up and stop whining for an hour I'd sign up to canvas the country. But I know that even when you win you'll still be whining and wanting to fight about something. Cause yall love to fight.
My family member is inexplicably afraid and convinced that there is some “plan” to elect joe Biden and then use the 25th amendment to make Nancy Pelosi the president... after *both* of their, what? Deaths?? Incapacitation?? Who can tell me where this conspiracy started??
On the bright side, Joe Biden is probably too old to be a 2 term president 🤗🤗
Nice try!  When Biden gets in we WILL make America great.
Biden won't get voted in anyway. #Trump2020LandslideVictory
🚨 Huge peace deal announced by   Obama &amp; Biden chose to deal with the world’s leading terrorism sponsor by sending them pallets of cash &amp; giving them an opening to make nukes.  Trump is uniting our allies to stand up to Iran &amp; protect Israel.  Stark contrast.
Yes Biden/Harris is supposed to win.   But never discount the power of the American caste system.  People will give up democracy before they give up race privilege.
Honestly love the 2010 Gmod aesthetic. Biden can't compete.
I suppose Biden will attack Trump for something so that the American people won't remember that the Obama/Biden Mid-East policy was to give vast sums to Iran and to let them have a nuke after ten years. Biden's policy of appeasement, just as happened with Munich, only brings war.
Biden is moving like his body is rented and he doesn’t know how it works going through the doorway. My God.. we live in odd times. These people are not progressives.
Those are constructive to you because you've bought into media narratives that more knowledgeable people know are fake. We don't want symbolic roles in a Biden administration.  We want free and fair elections, m4a, a GND, and wealth redistribution.
Biden has dead eyes. I think they want to show he knows how to use a telephone. The chick saying “Hi Kamala” sounds like she eats mayonnaise by the spoonful.  this is performative and gross.
I like to imagine, y’all imagine with me, that there’s massive vote for Biden/Harris in Florida so big they call it that night. Then a couple hours later N Carolina falls along with Michigan. Game over right? Champagne, bells ringing, celebration in the streets! Imagine it hard!
Think about how bad they all treated Sarah Palin a few years ago. Now they want to be nice. 🖕🏼 Harris and Biden they are terrorist to America
She's already leading in ways you need to. Please endorse her bill in the senate for $2k monthly stimulus payments.
Apparently you know nothing about Joe Biden. He doesn't live in gold plated mansions in the sky. Why? He's never been impressed with money. Probably an unreal concept for a trumpster.
I've heard this throughout this entire cycle. What are these people watching? What's so great about her debate skills? She once hit Biden, who thinks spelling "ooooo" in Cheerios is note-worthy.
I’d definitely feel better voting for you than Biden.
Yeah, trump will win in 2020 there really isn’t a doubt in my mind anymore. A trump voter will walk through fire to vote for him, more than half of potential Biden voters don’t give a shit about him or Harris.
Israel and UAE unite against Iran.  You know, the country that wants to nuke them and us; the country Obama/Biden sent Billions to appease.
I’m sure everyone remembers the college football seasons that were lost under the Obama-Biden administration...  (checks notes)  ...zero.
“She has accumulated enough experience in executive positions and as a legislator to provide competent backup. That may not sound inspiring, but it would be a contrast to the administration which the Biden/Harris ticket hopes to replace.” #BidenHarris2020
Should be Warren. Will be Biden or Harris.
You guys haven’t created sh*t. You rode the coat-tails of the Obama-Biden economy for a while until you screwed it up. Trump caused a recession in February with his idiotic tax breaks for the rich, then you bungled the coronavirus response and now 15+ million ppl are out of work.
Has she even congratulated Kamala Harris or endorsed Biden yet?
I mean people who entitled to vote for whoever they want. The DNC chose their hand and went against the movement. I’m not doing the whole Biden is just as bad. He isn’t. But people have the right to express their feelings.
Biden answered that question already.
As a businessman Trump used to be a NY Democrat and contributed to a ton of politicians until he found out how far left extreme they really were.  Kamala said she believed women like Tara Reid who said  Joe Biden sexually assaulted them.  She also said Biden has racist past.
1. Just curious John but Um WHY do you think it’s being canceled?   2. If Obama/Biden or any other allied leader were President instead of Trump, would the US still be on fire with COVID right now? If not, then we would still have football.   Soooooo the reason we don’t is Trump.
Tbh I’d vote for Joe Budden before Joe Biden
Fox's Jeanine Pirro predicts 'something will happen' to Biden before November and he won't be on ticket #SmartNews    Another false prophet Pirro
Biden might have worse PR/media team in history of politics. This added to innumerous virtual meeting gaffes is comical.
Hannity claims Biden picked Harris as running mate because she's 'a favorite of the radical far-left' #SmartNews    Hannity like always is full of crap
So what’s your solution? You have Biden or Trump to vote for in the fall. Nothing keeps us from pushing Biden to do better. But, there is no force in the world can make that sociopathic jackass Trump move one inch towards better. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
At a fundraiser Don Trump jr said :  Raise your hand if you think Biden made a WHORENDOUS pick for VP? This is trash talk beyond any trash talk I have ever heard!
I think Biden/Kamala have secret service protection now. These people know Trump will be defeated.
Harris is a joke just like Biden is a joke. If you go back in follow their votes and policies it’s a disaster everyone can use covid as an excuse to belittle  but he has been the greatest president in history and the man has held up and done everything he said!
Trump go win again, y’all to busy trying to find something bad on Biden and kamala y’all go cause division and unsurness amongst the democratic votes it’s 2016 all over again some people just don’t learn
I’m Riding for Biden!
Sometimes how he phrased stuff makes it tough on his team but the Biden crew is about to be going crazy - wait’ll Biden starts talking a lot in public lol
If we have a #fair, #honest, and #lawful #election;  I predict that #PresidentTrump will win--and #WIN #BIG. The mob/#LiesLiesLies party's claims of #prosperity ignore the eight anemic years of #Obama/#Biden and the boom period of #Trump/#Republicans-no mob/#LiesLiesLies #votes!
Don Trump jr said at a fundraiser: Raise your hand if you think Biden made a”Whorendous” pick for VP ? Can you believe this? Trash talk beyond any trash talk I’ve ever heard!!!!
Yes,  please look into threats against Joe Biden and Kamala. We're VERY concerned about the threats posed by people like
I wouldn't give a 2 stroke fuck if Biden picked Uncle Clifford as his running mate.  I'M VOTING TO GET TRUMP OUT
You have incredible gall questioning Vice President Biden’s faith for bringing Harris to the ticket. Y’all brought TRUMP to your ticket. 🤪 You laud your daughter for lying (something you also do regularly), and have a son who tortures dogs. You give a bad name to Christianity.
Oh, the tRumpers are tRolling! That Biden/Harris ticket is bothering them something fierce! They are crawling out the woodworks, rearing their nasty ugly antennae!

Trump is attacking Biden from the left and Kamala from the right
If twitter was bigger, Bern woulda beat Hillary who woulda beat Trump. Then Warren or Bern woulda beat Biden, or at least been his VP.... 0-6 lol
Second stimulus check: Where Biden, Harris stand on COVID payment proposals
Torches? This is hilarious. Is Babylon bee writing tweets for Biden now?
Kamala has a bill in the senate to help us get through this crisis by distributing $2,000 stimulus checks every month until this crisis is over. Will you endorse it to get the job done?
Fun fact: Donald Trump has refused to publicly denounce what’s happening in Hong Kong, while Joe Biden has. More lies from Donald the despot and the conservative snowflakes.
OK, enough about Harris. Just as so many VP candidates she will probably end up as another footnote in history anyway. Now lets talk about Biden's history &amp; policies writ large!
People in the US are sick, dying, and unemployed due to #COVID19, but thanks to  at least we can waste water in the shower again.
If Joe Biden was good enough for Leslie Knope, he’s good enough for me.
The left wing radicals are licking their chops doing interviews on how they can’t wait and if Biden wins he will bend to them all and do their bidding. Kamala all you got to do is look at San Fran it’s like nyc ruined
the left wing radicals will continue to lie for there agenda this video shows that. Pelosi just accused trump of a payroll tax cut scam and not being good but in 2012 she is all for it. Biden/Harris would be the worst decision in history
So if you’re mad that I’m not voting for a Biden-Harris ticket maybe ask yourself why it isn’t Harris in the top slot
I would actually vote for Kamala Harris if she was running for President but she’s not running for President. Joe Biden is running for President and I’m not voting for him.
disappointed the trump train didn’t run biden over, huge missed opportunity
🚨 NOT what Biden wanted to see:  Number of people filing unemployment DROPPED below a million for the first time since the pandemic started.  Dems &amp; so-called experts always bet against America.  But not Trump. He built the world’s strongest economy once—now he’s doing it again!
More fake news from the conservative Snowflakes. Here’s a fun thought: Why hasn’t the despot Donald Trump publicly condemned what’s happening in Hong Kong? Joe Biden has.
Biden Doesn't Even Know  Where He Is Most Days &amp;  He Lies His Azz Off Typical Corrupt Democrat💯 GodBlessAmerica🙏🇺🇸
Are u insane, no difference... u ethier vote for communism with biden r freedom with trump. Wakeup people this is no joke
lol when does Biden use “complete cogent sentences?” He speaks like he has dementia 😂
Dogs for Biden/Harris
Biden literally took the TRAIN to and from DC every day so that he could continue to parent his sons as a single father mourning the loss of his wife and baby girl.While doing this, he still sought to do the best by his constituents. What’ve YOU ever done?
Howard University community reacts to Kamala Harris as Biden's VP pick.   via
DAMN THE RULE OF LAW: Rudy Giuliani says, the U.S. Would Become ‘Banana Republic’ if Biden’s DOJ Prosecuted Trump.  But, previously, Trump's personal lawyer has persistently pushed for charges against Obama administration figures. What about rule of law?
Y'all think Biden is writing his own tweets...while alive?
Just clarifying,,,,, is Biden your “perfect” candidate???? R u sure????
I'm joe biden and I've lost my 5 ye old girlfriend.
Almost as quick as others went from “defund the police “ to “we have to vote for Biden, even though he said he won’t defund police and has a direct connection to upholding the institution of policing as we know it today and picked someone who has done the same as his vp
Most importantly, WE have to come out and vote not only for Biden/Harris but turn Senate to Dem, hold the House and go after Trumptwrs and bad players right and left up and down the ticket.
It’s really amusing to hear Trump defend Biden about the former debate with Kamala -on the busing issue! What this man baby doesn’t understand is that not all grown-ups hold grudges like the “nasty” little man he is . He can’t put his inflated ego aside for US

Kamala Harris just showed why Biden chose her as his running mate
If we Trump fans *are* taking another look at Biden, it’s a look of disgust!
So if Joe Biden grew up around black ppl he can too? Noted lol
Kanye West accuses Wisconsin Democrats spying on his campaign    America😎 Corrupt Democrats Trying Too Destroy Kanye West 💯 They Know He Will Take Votes From Corrupt Biden &amp; Trump Will Win Wisconsin! No Man Are Woman Can Stop Will Of  God🙏🇺🇸
Seniors trust Joe Biden  plus they feel betrayed by their smarmy governor and Trump -the management of COVId     Is number one on their minds they feel afraid 😱 and betrayed Perhaps this crisis will make them pay more attention to Trump desire to raid the SS fund
If conservatives knew just how conservative Joe Biden was, they would definitely vote for him over Trump.
Classy.
Joe Biden likes to let little kids rub the hair on his legs and sit them on his lap 🤔
Four years ago we were told to vote for Hillary or we would be responsible for electing trump. I voted for her, although I didn’t want to. She won the popular vote, then the electoral college decided to elected trump. So why should I vote for Biden?
That is why I’m voting green - Biden is like being in the eye of the storm, a brief repose before shit gets worse.
I loved the “we’ve added more jobs than Obama and Biden ever did.”... That’s like an investor losing $1,000,000 of your money, gaining back $500,000, and then telling you he’s got you more gains than anybody else ever has
I like how Biden and Harris aren’t spewing out a firehose of dumb fucking lies at me like I’m a one-cell organism that’s stupid enough to believe obvious bullshit. One day of it has been enough to elevate my mood a little.
Did you run a piece on Mike Pence's (or Joe Biden for that matter) legitimacy to be president? No? That's because it's racist sexist trash and you know it.
Dogs for Biden/Harris!
Opinion: Voters will be looking for more than just symbolism in Biden and Harris
As if Republicans are tuning in to this convention. What the DNC really needs to do- if they expect true progressives and Gen Z and millennials to settle for Biden- is give more time and a larger platform to the more progressive voices in the party.
Harris makes case against Trump in first speech as Biden's running mate
Joe Biden might not support #MedicareForAll but Kamala Harris does. I believe she’ll win that battle as VP. Let’s get to work. #BidenHarris2020
China if Trump, Civil if Biden
Proud of you girlfriend I am also a Tulane Alum We need to take no prisoners in this fight Trump is gonna look under every rock for dirt Also I hope our team of Biden-Harris does something about incarceration La. is number 1 in this area-disgrace - free our kids!
Biden, is too old. This is the best card he could use.
CNN Editor-at-Large: Biden May "Step Aside" for Kamala Harris
You're questioning Biden's faith while presenting as a "priest" - who just happens to have a wife &amp; kids?!?!   Get behind thee, Satan, and take 2020 with you.
““If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.” Jesus expressed comparisons.  Biden/Harris vs Trump/Pence is like  superheroes vs anti-Christs.
I think he means that he needs Obama/Biden to take care of business to open schools safely because GOP's can't get the job done. Obama/Biden took care of business and got rid of bin Laden when Bush and GOP couldn't! Thanks DeSantis for the shoutout!
#45,       Get this negative failure out the way of the American people!  Our beloved #46 POTUS Joe Biden  and #46 VPOTUS Kamala Harris  takes the lead in 2020 to save the soul of our nation and restore dignity in America...
As Robert De Niro said “I hear things, I hear thing”. This Trump interview was recently on FOX. Trump did elaborate that Biden is “shot mentality”, but “I hear things”.
do i agree with everything that joe biden/ kamala has done or their beliefs? absolutely not. but i also understand that our country simply cannot handle another 4 years of the orange guy.
Make no mistake, he’s going to troll and burn this country down. We will have to vote Biden/Harris in office to make us better.
biden is racist lmao
did you not watch the video? i’m deeply offended at biden. tf?
Yes they can vote against your interests but as whole a states delegates have to vote upon majority rule. So if 1 electorate votes for kanye and 2 for Biden. Biden still wins. There’s never been a case where the e.c caused an crazy election.
Neither would ever do that.  Biden haters black ppl . He tried his best to stop desegregation
Because Biden can’t debate!  Come on man just say it!
Girl they both do the same thing. It’s scary bc Biden’s better at pretending. I thought Clinton was the lesser evil but she was even caught trafficking black children from Haiti
I’m burned out with the coverage of the Biden/Harris coupling! Her voice and laugh grates on my last nerve ala Hillary!
Does it require brains for Biden to say he doesn't want his kids to go to school in a "racial jungle"?  How about that if you don't vote for Master Biden, "you ain't black"?  Kamala's mom is from India &amp; her dad from Jamaica.  Not black. Neither are her husband or kids.  Phony.
Call me a “neo-liberal corporatist shill.” Couldn’t care less.  Biden/Harris 2020. “Your vote doesn’t matter. You live in Louisiana.”  Yes. It. Does. It matters. You do you. I’ll vote against Trump. Happily.
Think about it  Kamalla is 55  Biden is 77  Maybe she’s just playing the odds
As Kamala Harris Joins Biden Ticket, Wall Street Sighs in Relief - WSJ
Does Kamala still believe Tara Reid's accusation that Biden sexually assaulted her? She said she believed her.  Hmmm.  Well, we already know how low she'll go for a job. (Mayor Willie Brown)
Biden got him bothered.
Messa Joe Biden don’t care nor do he understand The plight of the so-called black people . Say no to Joe!!!
She is he. To Joe Biden for president. No we can’t!!! This is my humble opinion. Not hate speech!!!
Did she ask you to endorse her $2k monthly stimulus bill yet? If she hasn't yet, here's over 371,000 people who have.
Curious if internatl newpapers wud have anything to say about Biden/Harris. Front pages from  Many more carried pics of Putin and his virus "vaccine".
I liked that the Biden-Harris announcement used Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" as bed music; I hope they continue to do that.
I voted for 2 out of the 3 men you mentioned. Like you, I am delighted to be voting for Biden/Harris. So is every other sane American, I am convinced.
if people refuse to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket bc they don’t make enough concessions to the left, that is the BIDEN/HARRIS ticket’s fault. not voters. why do republicans understand this so much better than democrats?
Biden is suprisingly smart with the #Kamala pick. Identity politics always blinds people into thinking representation can create systemic change.
Trump/Trumpist attacks on Biden-Harris are gross but bode well. “Hit me with your best shot” has never been more revealing.
Biden is a pedophile that’s the tweet
Show me where she called Biden racist. I can show u the racist tweets trump has sent out.
And the same age/experience contrast between McCain and Palin could be seen in the Democratic ticket. Yet when Biden was announced a few weeks earlier, his age was not mentioned once, even while his experience, six senate terms, and health problems are all discussed
We all have HOPE and FAITH in Team Biden/Harris will lead us Americans to a better and more prosperous United States of America. It's been time to get Trumpism out of the People's House! USA is the land of the Free and let's make that TRUTH again!
Its starting to feel like Christmas everyday! First Kamala as VP then the epic roll out of the Biden/Harris uppercut to Trump/ Pence today &amp; THIS book due in Sept!! CNN Exclusive: Details, title and cover revealed for Bob Woodward's upcoming book on Trump
*Sets your house on fire*  *Sets your money on fire*  *Sets your car on fire*  *Hands you a glass of water*  “We’ve done more to fight fires in the last 3 months than Joe Biden and Barack Obama did in their 8 years in office.”
So I pulled up the NYT front pages that covered the VP announcements of Kaine, Ryan, Palin, and Biden (7/15/16 cover for Pence seems to not be digitized). Lo and behold, a pattern could be discerned
Biden bet not lose , now that he’s picked the all madden team.. he gon fuck around and lose to the N.Y. Giants on pro.
Biden you forget. You are the one who loves the KKK
So Tucker is for Biden?  That sounds like a #VoteBidenHarris2020  campaign speech😂😂😂
when Biden announced that he would be picking a female VP, he unfairly put the focus on his running mate’s gender identity rather than on her record of service....which actually started making a lot of sense when he picked Kamala Harris lol
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Joe Biden is aging..
Everyone is like "Are you voting for Trump then?" No, you should be able to openly criticize politicians ?? No one is voting for Biden &amp; Kamala because they WANT to -- it's sadly the lesser of two evils
It's been four, long years of horror, but there is light. Celebrate being human and listen to opera. Biden-Harris 2020  Beautiful opera arias, famous female opera singers  via
Just wondering CNN expect Republicans to hug and kiss Biden and Kamala the way Pelosi, Democrats, media has been hugging and kissing Trump since he announced his entry into politics?
This is wrong. AFFH just means if towns want federal HUD dollars, they have to make plans to end discriminatory housing. It was first implemented not by Biden but by Mitt Romney’s dad when he too realized that giving Fed Money to towns to stay segregated is a bad idea.
Accusers, plural. Right. You’re so full of s h I t.  But even Biden said he wanted to hear Reade out, that she deserved to be listened to, to have an investigation opened.   What happened to that??? 😂
I’m tryna get like you bro! I need those problems haha. I think the entire Dem base feels the same way about Biden as you do. It’s almost the same way it was in ‘16 but we need to be unified to take the White House. Let me know if you ever wanna do some commentary I’m ready haha
Of course, the fact that Wall Street does not see Kamala Harris as a threat is absolutely important -- "Wall Street’s warm welcome to Joe Biden’s running mate reflects a belief that tougher financial regulation isn’t a top priority"
Biden announces Kamala Harris as his running mate...
Just realized that the Biden vs Trump debates will be two old men yelling at clouds. No way to watch that shit sanely
If Joe Biden does end up winning, that would create a nice kind of symmetry by having that the last president come from the first state.
and you're not being realistic if you think that incrementalism is going to work, when it hasn't worked in the past 40 years of quid pro quo and compromise. You're cucked.  Your only argument is vote for Biden or else. Who's the idiot, again?
let’s be real even if biden chose a pile of bricks for VP i’d still vote biden/bricks2020
Ok  serious question, why do you support them ? Biden has been a politician for 40 years what is he going to do now? What has he done in 40 years ?
This is what’s about to happen under Biden Presidency
I think you’re confused, as usual. You’re thinking of Trump. No one has accused Vice President Biden of “sexual abuse,” If you’re truly an ally of Trump, you’d be foolish to bring up sexual abuse. A 13-year-old for God’s sake!
Im so mad at them videos cause trump be smoking biden 💀
Can’t wait to get my Biden Harris yard sign!
I agree. He wouldn't have taken the Biden-Harris campaign launch well at all. First, they're coming for HIS job, oval office, White House, Marine One, &amp; Air Force One. Next, they criticized him on national television. He would have gone ballistic, hence, the sedation.
You ain name nobody sooo vote Biden plsPlease follow I will follow back. We need Vice President Biden and Kamala Harris in the White House. Please follow so I can promote. I want to do all I can for the Blue Wave. God Bless America.
Go sell crazy in Antarctica with pedojoe Biden and pedobama
I wanted our ticket to be Biden/Klobuchar.
Probably the latter if she talks more about herself rather than Joe Biden. Or rather herself and Biden as a team.
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign likened Trump's comments and actions as "sabotage."
I’m happy to read that about the Biden signs.
Joe Biden will not win the presidential election, he will not even be close! However, if he did win his life expectancy would be six months or less and the chick would be the President .
Reminder that if you don’t vote for Biden/Harris , you will have Trump for another 4 years
HAHAHA NO CHANCE IN HELL Biden-Harris wins. This presidential ticket is a JOKE. Anyone that votes for this pair I would almost feel sorry for voting for a couple of incompetent idiots that can't tell the truth and have to advance their career with sexual favors is just sad.
#BIDEN just said masks prevent contracting #Rona #EXPODENTIALLY
Your job is to support BIDEN; but you can also add that your thoughts and feelings maybe different. You maybe able to lobby for a BETTER way. Before, you answer a question Read his PLANS.
Joe Biden never stuttered lady. Go watch his old videos. He's in early stages of dementia or alzheimer's
#WATCH: Steven Maxwell speaks with Stephen Handwerk, the Executive Director of the Louisiana Democrat party, about presidential candidate Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris for Vice President.
why is he speaking about the same points since last Friday?  He looks exhausted.  I hate this Trump.  He should be on the offensive and eviscerate Biden and Kamala today.  Quite low energy briefing.
Newsfeed Now: Man hangs off semi; Biden picks running mate.  #NewsfeedNow
This is y’all excuse for not voting: But,... where’s the lie????  #BidenHarris2020
Dr.Marshall, as an advisor to the Trump campaign, I hope you are honing in on Kamala Harris’ anti-catholic bona fides, and advising them how to smack the Biden campaign to win the Catholic vote (nominal catholics or not) due to her anti- catholic bigotry.
Reaction pours in for Harris as Biden’s historic VP pick.  #FOX48News
Our ticket should have been Biden/Klobuchar.
IM IN THE DEEP SOUTH, WE HAVE NO TIME FOR ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION. THESE OLDER AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE SCARED AND YOUR PRIVELEDGED ASS AND THOSE THAT THINK LIKE YOU ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE REST OF US. 2 CHOICES BIDEN OR TRUMP THATS IT THE GOP WILL DESTROY US YOU ARE HELPING THEM
You’re too late, Biden

I knew that was coming...Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate #2020PresidentialRace #SmartNews
Biden chooses Usain Bolt as his running mate cuz he’s “Hella fast”
I have trouble believing Biden is making any decisions on his own, this is elderly abuse to force someone , obviously non compass mentos, secondary diagnosis pedophilia, onto any platform and expect coherency.  His wife or family should shut the circus down.
I just saw a campaign ad for Biden.  The word “feelings “was used four times by a brown female whose mother had died . The mother was at least 75 years old and “she” just “felt “the president didn’t do a good job.  She felt like Trump was all the problem, THATS IT!!!
I don't need to know now!  I know I'm voting for Biden❤
You dipshits,Bernie personally called President Obama and asked him to stay out of primaries. President Obama honored his wishes. You all acting like the DNC voted we as a party voted. The majority choose VP Biden. No forced hand everyone made there choice.
Guess they made that specifically for Joe Biden
You need to panic cupcake, patriots want you, you owe people in high places that will murder you to collect.  You couldn’t deliver Hillary and you cannot deliver Biden!  Like a whitetail buck with a 🎯 birthmark,
I do too, without taking anything for granted, I think it will be a blood bath.  You know my ex is elected democrat, who is voting against Biden, like she voted against Hillary.  So says my 15 year old son , lol
One thing I believe is that when it comes to trump, it could always get worse. He could still continue to lose more voters to Biden.
Totally lmao at Biden thinking Tik Tok is a breath mint. Needed that laugh 😂
Biden did but  WILL give him a break. They’ll make excuses for him and blameAnyone that would put a Biden flag on a boat must be an idiot and by rule would not properly know how to operate a boat so that makes perfect sense. 🤣🤣🤣🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Where’s Biden?
The so called black people don’t have a dog in this race. Especially not Joe Biden. Kamala Harris is Obama in a dress. Yep she’s smooth. And definitely not Trump. All though he’s a funny guy
I'm not voting for Biden as much as I'm voting against incompetence, corruption and weak leadership.

The difference here is that  “requested” a ballot, which request comes after certain protocol(s) are met and the ballot is registered. It is not the result of a “mass mailing.” C’mon, Mr. Biden, you’re misleading the public.  MASS MAILINGS are not legal nor safe.  🇺🇸USA🇺🇸

(18/18) So yeah...hold Biden &amp; Harris accountable for addressing their past errors in judgement or character but don't for a second be pulling this crap where you're positioning them as a "bad" option when the alternative is SO much worse. Or do you want another 4 years of Trump?
(7/18) ...but in the absence of cooperation and collaboration, they aren't able to benefit from the others' perspectives or insights. I highly recommend everyone read Bill Bishop's "The Big Sort" if they have a problem with the Biden/Harris ticket being imperfect.
(6/18) Biden and Harris arent perfect but you what? They a helluva lot better options than the alternative and we should use their time in office to fight for real change on both sides of the aisle because there are ideas that both Republicans and Democrats have that are good...
(1/18) I don't get why ppl are so obsessed with finding every little thing that Biden or Harris did that didn't perfectly live up to the ideals of Now. I'm not pretending it didn't happen or that they shouldn't be pressured to improve on those past positions but...WTH?
If that’s what Biden and Bitch want, then they probably screwed each other.  Haha!! MAGA KAGA

He also said he would not get behind Biden or Harris but is now endorsing that ticket! He like almost all Democrats are hypocrites and liars!!
How about the post office not going thru their money like they do...any other business is responsible for their finances. They are a private organization, not to mention the letter carriers union endorsed Joe Biden. Stop election fraud...vote in person, with an ID!!!!.
That lil press conference today with liars Biden &amp; Kamala was just a preview. Two sociopathic baby killing, authoritarians with a lust for power and contempt for half the country. Tucker is right. They hate us &amp; they want to punish us for voting for DJT &amp; IF they get power 🇺🇲dies

I suppose Biden will attack Trump for something so that the American people won't remember that the Obama/Biden Mid-East policy was to give vast sums to Iran and to let them have a nuke after ten years. Biden's policy of appeasement, just as happened with Munich, only brings war.
Biden might have worse PR/media team in history of politics. This added to innumerous virtual meeting gaffes is comical.
Yes,  please look into threats against Joe Biden and Kamala. We're VERY concerned about the threats posed by people like

Staggering how Biden and Kumoltta Harris just outright lie. Heels Up Harris said Trump ran Obama economy into ground. Now this. Are people really this stupid and uninformed?  Oh wait, some liberals might be reading this...

They are running on lies; however, let's pray for Joe Biden's health
I’m act watching it on fox entertainment. I want to see what he says about today’s professional speech by Biden!!!!
I would much rather listen to Biden. Hell, I’d rather listen to a monkey babble instead of Trump.
I don't know. I listen to Black Information Network on the radio. They are major BLM supporters  and they are praising the Biden/Harris ticket as a huge win for black Americans.
I can’t remember where I read the article, but the writer basically said ‘Joe Biden played second fiddle to a younger, less experienced black man with no issue. That’s all I need to know about him.’ I hope they work as a team through this.
I agree. Biden and Harris convincing BLM advocates that they have their interests at heart is a close second.
What channel?  They are all showing Biden/Harris!!!!!!
Watching Biden and Harris! So exciting!! #BidenHarris2020
All IN WITH BIDEN &amp; HARRIS!
In essence she ket the truth slip, that China prefers Biden
Get it. They are taking advantage of Kanye who is mentally ill to run hoping he takes votes from Biden.
Make no mistake: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are completely controlled by the radical left.  They’ll both do anything to please the Bernie Sanders wing of the party—they already proved that during the primaries.
Its ironic that that mainstream Dems from union families have the most to lose from Biden/Harris. They will lose their hard won health-care insurance to a government run plan.
Well this is one surburban housewife here in the south that will not be voting for you. I would feel much safer for the future is Biden/Harris won. But please keep believing otherwise.

Same here. John Lewis urged Joe Biden to have a black woman as VP. To show they cared about what he thought, Biden, choose Kamala Harris.
The plan is for the Dems to steal the election with mail in votes! That’s why they are keeping Biden and picked Harris as VP, so they can give America a HIGE SLAP IN THE FACE!! They will “find” more votes until they win it all!!
Biden clearly didn’t read the room correctly

The elite think that we the people are stupid. Yesterday the Wrestler Kamala The giant died and Today Joe Biden name’s his running mates coincidence I think not.
No more Joe!!! We don’t want Joe Biden for president or his running mate. We have had enough of the Obamas in the White House. It’s not a black issue or a white issue it’s a right issue
I’m ready to go vote. Biden/Harris.
I like my kernels popped!!!go Biden/Harris
Is Biden not catholic? I’m shocked.
No want Joe Biden or his running mate
We have got to keep Joe Biden out of the White House. He selected female Barack Obama to be Vice President let’s start a campaign no more joe
Lady g  what do you make of all the ppl saying Harris thought Biden was not a good candidate then changed her tone later?
Biden choose this crazy for his VP today so much hatred YIKES... #dictator #democrat #farleft #wwg1wga #Trump2020
I can't wait to cast my vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for President and Vice President.   Time to get those trashy corrupt trumps out the White House. It's time to take our country back from those criminals in the White House and corrupt Republicans in the Senate.   Vote!
So, what do you think Trump would to Biden in a debate.
Which makes her a hypocrite for joing joe biden.   I wonder what it will cost... Btw we need her senate seat RED in cali
Riding with Biden!
"I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it," Harris said at a presidential campaign event in Nevada.
i aint forget kamala called joe biden racist bout a year ago
We didn’t need any more proof that Joe Biden isn’t the so-called moderate he pretends to be—but we just got it. Just like him, Kamala Harris will say and do anything to please the radical left.
Biden has said he was picking an African-American woman for VP, and he actually chooses a Jamacan-Indian instead.  Does he really know what he did?
Kamala Harris should decline Biden offer. 🤷🏾‍♂️  Because one thing Kamala, she gon make sure somebody.......never mind.

Biden Reportedly Expected To Announce Running Mate This Week | HuffPost. Trump’s Virus
Blah, blah, blah! TDS to the max! Dems are 100% corrupt and money hungry! Biden got paid $900 million from Ukraine, which was part of our tax $$$. It may not be proven illegal but certainly not ethical...they are master thieves and will never have the presidency ever again!

I think Biden should put them all in the cages that the poor immigrant children are currently housed in.
The late nite host or comedian who finally has the balls to come out and joke about joe Biden’s run for president (or whatever this is). I just don’t understand, if I was on late nite tv or a comedian, I would think these joe Biden interviews would be GOLD. why has nobody.......
He did? In what way? 3 debates scheduled, Biden to debate in the standard THREE.
Fox News shows Biden answering a question, following it with a joke, while riding a bike, and wearing a mask.  All while the current Fox News "opinion talk shows" talking points are "Biden is hiding in a basement and mentally impaired"
Fox News knows their base is dumb and can watch this segment, then literally 10 seconds later be told Biden is hiding in a basement, and they'll believe it. Their tiny goldfish brains are the reason they are Fox News viewers to begin with.
Intelligence officials provide details on Russian disinformation campaign against Biden: report -
Trump has shown the danger posed by a corrupt unitary executive that’s also backed by unprincipled sycophants. When Joe Biden and dems win in Nov, they will do the U.S. and the world a great service by passing legislation that puts real &amp; enforceable checks on the power of POTUS.
So your going to vote for Biden who is not capable of running our country? You better open your eyes to what’s really happening in our country! Is this what you want for the future of your child?
Yes, where's  ?? Oh that's right, she's running a sham campaign for her mentally ill husband to undermine Biden😡. Sure, sure, she's an advocate for "prison reform". Only when it suits her agenda, though, amirite?
Oh Man Biden’s picks for V.P. One lady that loved and respected CASTRO and then Kamala who at debates I could tell hated Biden and thinks he is racist.Good job Joe . What a joke.
Yeah and Biden will be president...lmao!

Kanye doesn't have to do that. Biden is doing a good sabotaging his own campaign
Biden shouldn't debate period and only if Trump releases his tax returns
Yep. They centered their entire personality and identity around a politician (gee, where have we seen that before?) so they cant handle that Biden won out, and so he's enemy #1. It doesnt matter what Trump does, because Biden is "literally the same and will do the same stuff".
Latoya Cantrell mayor of New Orleans wants to destroy the economy of New Orleans .  She wants to destroy the petroleum industry with her friend  Biden and other Marxists
How tha heck can she support joe Biden for president of America. Shows just how shitty of a mayor she is.
WAKE UP DEMACRATS!! The far left has taken over your party!! Biden is and will be a puppet for these extremists!!!! We MUST STAND TOGETHER AND VOTE FOR TRUMP TO SAVE THE COUNTRY! He may not be the prez you want but he is the prez we NEED right now!!
If you saying "grab them by the pussy" didn't lose women or you saying you "like people that don't get caught" cause you to lose vets, he'll be ok. Don't let Joe Biden distract you from the fact we're voting Joe Biden
The level of ignorance of Biden supporters never ceases to amaze me.
Yeah, ummm ya know.. because uuuuhhh that thing. Just umm know ya know that only Joe Biden can beat Joe Biden in November.Interesting .  Joe Biden as VP in 2016-Jan. 2017
Snowden SHOULD be pardoned, liberals are just mad that Trump is the one who suggested it, they’d love it if BIden pardoned him
I believe TRUMP is ahead and dems screwing around with our minds saying RACIST Biden ahead so we won't notice when dems rig elections.
#SarahPalin let their words do the talking is good advice and the fact that Biden hasn’t done it in 40+ years.
Interesting perspective from #wsj A Biden cabinet would operate European style. Everyone for himself. The buck will never stop anywhere. At least  is in charge. Dems picked Biden because he is weak.
It’s either going to be Trump or Biden. Biden’s vote is split between him and Jorgensen meanwhile all the Trump supporters are standing together. 3rd party votes should have more ground to stand on but this isn’t the year to prove that point, Trump needs to be out of office.

This week the Not Real News focuses on false news that spread about Sen. Kamala Harris after presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden announced Tuesday she would be his running mate.
Awe, look at  Biden he can repeat what governors, Fauci, cDC, WHO and Trump have been saying for months.
Biden has a history of racist comments during his 40 years in the Senate.
I think we’re just saying fuck the top period. They not for us Trump or Biden. That’s it,I don’t think we’re concerned with whatever everybody else wanna do.
Joe Biden is not the meme you love — this is the dark truth about his voting record | The Independent
Please enumerate Biden’s successes. I don’t know of any achievements he made in his 40 years!
Ironic. Race relations deteriorated under the Obama-Biden administration. That is a fact and easily fact checked.
Biden has a racist track record and  Harris prosecuted minor drug offenses that increased black incarceration! These are facts not conjecture!
By not voting for Biden you are voting for tRump! If you are not happy with how things are now, then be part of the change that this country desperately needs! What we have now is a dictator that is killing our country!
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign likened Trump's comments and actions as "sabotage."
2020 Biden Accomplishments 1. Ended the #MeToo movement 2.  Made the most racist statement in politics “you ain’t black unless you vote for me” and 3 selected a vp who believes Bidens accusers and who’s ancestors owned slaves.
Apparently the “racist” part is ”false.” Not necessarily. Harris’ comments about Biden would lead one to interpret her calling him a racist. So through your point of view she did and I agree.   These “fact checkers” are being way too pedantic on this one.

You’re right.  National polls suggest 4points as Biden’s lead. HRC has the same lead at this point in time!
I’ve been predicting that the Biden/Harris administration is going to be hostile toward the disabled. This doesn’t comfort me any, I hope he isn’t brought on if they win.
Let me tell you this, Joe Biden will NEVER be President! How does it feel to know that you are nothing more than a token? Black and a woman that’s all they based your qualifications on, but you’re really NOT black so...... just because you’re a woman 😂
Pro-life movement leans into 2020 election to boost Trump, claiming issue 'has gone from liability to asset'
“It’s not about your rights”  This should be troubling to all. Our rights are protected by the Constitution. Biden doesn’t have the option to override our rights just because he thinks it’s our “responsibility.” He could say anything is our responsibility to deny us our rights.

Maybe Biden and Harris can pose for a pic with their pants unbuttoned holding a glass of "black water." I hear it's the latest in devout Christian leadership.
I can tell you this Catholic is voting for Biden and Kamala Harris!
I'm sure this question had absolutely nothing to do with trumpie saying yesterday that Biden should disavow antifa. Surely, this wasn't a plant!🤔
Voters opinions of Biden are clearly the least consequential thing in American politics right now, it does not matter one bit (unfortunately)
I agree with this, and I’ve gone back and forth between Jorgensen and Biden, but this honestly is NOT the year to vote 3rd party. 3rd party won’t win this year, and it’s splitting the Dem vote to ensure Trump wins.

The reason why  Is blocking subpoenas for James Comey and John Brennan is bc he was in on the attempted coup. He was mad at trump for not giving him a cabinet position so he decided to help get Trump impeached. he was probably offered a position in the Biden cabinet
Do you believe the WOMEN accusing Biden of sexual assault?
You said "IT WAS A DEBATE" to justify your attacks on Biden. You also said you believed Biden's sexual assault accusers. So was it a debate or do you believe them? Using sexual assault victims for votes is unethical and gross!
Do tell what has Biden done in the last 47 years? How about this malleable VP Harris switching support! Your misinformed  and pathetic🤷‍♀️

Right! When you bring home your paycheck on Friday there are four different taxes taking out of your check Federal State SS  Med Trump is giving back your federal not your SS. Then we’re going to have to pay it back if Joe Biden becomes president. Bc it’s not permanent
If Joe Rogan &amp; the Bros are committed to voting 45 out, which means voting for Biden, then I welcome their support just as I do Navarro’s. If Hispanic Dems believe 4 more years of 45 is best, they are amongst 29% of their own &amp; 13% of Black men who helped get us into this mess.
Twenty-nine percent of Latinos voted for 45 versus 8% of Blacks. Proof that Biden’s point has validity. Same point applies to the fact that 13% of Black men voted for 45 versus only 3% of Black women &amp; I welcome Navarro &amp; any others who will help regain the White House &amp; Senate.
She explains it so well.  Just listen to Joe Biden speak.... and the others.
Just a waste of time! Biden will not be President!
Where the hell did I ever mention Trump?? Seems a bit like you're the one hung up on him. I'm simply pointing out the obvious in terms of Biden's signs of worsening dementia, especially since it seems that his mental are faculties declining at an ever increasing pace.
Well, maybe Biden will keep his word to cure cancer if he is elected. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Within the party, there is some tension about how soon before the Democratic National Convention Biden should unveil his decision.
They did for now, but Biden adding them back wouldn’t surprise me at all
We ignore Joe Biden.
I’m not saying that Trump is sane by any stretch of imagination. I’m definitely saying that Biden most definitely is not a sane person either. I don’t think we have a “normal-same-level headed-stable member in either of the houses of Congress.
where is trump racist?? Where. JOE BIDEN  is racist.  Sen byrd good friends. Nancy Pelosi  father. The anti crime  bill  the assault weapon  ban. As a History major  i know better. You can't  fool me  its the Dems  party of the Kkk.
Joe Biden is a child molester. This ought to be an issue. It’s not funny. It’s disgusting.
China &amp; all the dishonest Americans who have been receiving money from China at the expense of our government "would prefer Biden." Nancy included. Drain the swamp!
Its hard work trying to undo the many laws you (Biden) helped pass that put police in a position where they had to incarcerate nonviolent citizens.   It's hilarious you position yourself as a solution.  You are part of the problem.
Wake up sir. Trump can have any woman he wants and you think he wanted her? Do you also think the woman who accused Biden of attempting to finger her is telling the truth or is it one sided?
Trump allies have ears to hear Biden, eyes to see his actions which indicate his mental challenges. It's unethical for Democrats to promote him for president. Biden's family should be ashamed of putting him before the public to see his health issues making him an unfit candidate.
At least Trump took a few tough questions  Biden takes no tuff questions and if he does he calls the black reporter a “junkie”

#Democrats are pissed that #kayne is running. They are tweeting #kayneconjob saying Trump is in on it. Question. What does it say about the Democratic nomineee if someone hates Trump but would rather vote for a crazy person with bi-polar over #Biden. How is that #Trumps fault?
No man will be perfect  but we aren't electing a pastor. Between Trump and baby killers supporting Biden, the woman sniffer, my vote will be for Trump. His actions have shown support for many good values. Now his personall life and language, not so much.
She has bashed Biden and wanted me to change to what she believed. I told her we should just agree to disagree, but she is  showing hate. I’m fine now. Just the whole thing was hypocritical and nuts.
You only see Biden stuff on Twitter and sometimes on Facebook. That's about it. Biden voters are all quarantining 8n their basements. They are currently mad Trump extended their unemployment. lol
And that’s the problem. Biden changes his mind whichever way the wind blows!!
Ok none of what I said was a conspiracy. His words, his bill, his actions. You attack our president while you refuse to acknowledge Joe Biden is a racist child sniffing fool. Typical liberal one sided conversation
You're kidding I hope. Biden can't form a coherent sentence for craps sake. He'll get creamed!
Joe biden is aganist blacks, look at both crime bills he passed, look at what he have said about Blacks, look at all the kkk members he has been friends with.
Steve, this is BULL$hit, period!  Where is Joe Biden and his staff to respond to this nonsense.  They are doing exactly what Clinton did; not respond inkind to BULL$hit IMMEDIATELY!   Unfortunately, we have a lot of IGNORANCE IN THIS COUNTRY!  WHERE IS THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN?
If Biden wins its because of voter fraud.
Are you saying Joe Biden is a damn racist?  Where you been for 45 years?
Dems having trouble with math again.... we need a sweep that get the trains of USA back on the tracks . NATION OF LAWS. SELF GOVERNED. CAPITALIST. BALANCED IN ALL ASPECTS OF FREEDOM AND CIVILITY. Not like Biden and Pelosi. thanks 😊
In my area, I see WAY too many trump ads and a few Biden ads. The comparison: trump ads are dark and depressing; Biden ads are hopeful, uplifting and deliver a message of unity. Which one to vote for? 🤔

Biden can't remember where he is much less what he is.
Will someone explain to me what else Trump needs to do to satisfy you guys of this pandemic? U Want him on front lines giving tests? 😂Joe Biden would have done nothing different. If Trump mandated masks and lock down the country you lefties would just call him a dictator!
So we shouldn’t go back to the lowest unemployment for every demographic in the country. We Shouldn’t go back to higher wages and lower taxes. Biden has never built anything in his life. He’s never had a real job.
Ya you know all the fake news don’t you?? Even Biden dodged the draft. All rich people have bankruptcies. No proof of sexual assault. Colluding with Russia was a lie and so was the bounties? All FAKE NEWS!!
Joe Biden doesn’t need to be running for President. His family needs to step in and do something  with him.

NRA being held accountable for fraud does not equal banning guns. Right to own guns is in Constitution. You might want to take a quick peek at that document. Biden does not want to defund police or take guns. More fear mongering. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

I believe TRUMP is ahead and dems screwing around with our minds saying RACIST Biden ahead so we won't notice when dems rig elections.
#SarahPalin let their words do the talking is good advice and the fact that Biden hasn’t done it in 40+ years.
Interesting perspective from #wsj A Biden cabinet would operate European style. Everyone for himself. The buck will never stop anywhere. At least  is in charge. Dems picked Biden because he is weak.
It’s either going to be Trump or Biden. Biden’s vote is split between him and Jorgensen meanwhile all the Trump supporters are standing together. 3rd party votes should have more ground to stand on but this isn’t the year to prove that point, Trump needs to be out of office.

This week the Not Real News focuses on false news that spread about Sen. Kamala Harris after presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden announced Tuesday she would be his running mate.
Awe, look at  Biden he can repeat what governors, Fauci, cDC, WHO and Trump have been saying for months.
Biden has a history of racist comments during his 40 years in the Senate.
I think we’re just saying fuck the top period. They not for us Trump or Biden. That’s it,I don’t think we’re concerned with whatever everybody else wanna do.
Joe Biden is not the meme you love — this is the dark truth about his voting record | The Independent
Please enumerate Biden’s successes. I don’t know of any achievements he made in his 40 years!
Ironic. Race relations deteriorated under the Obama-Biden administration. That is a fact and easily fact checked.
Biden has a racist track record and  Harris prosecuted minor drug offenses that increased black incarceration! These are facts not conjecture!
By not voting for Biden you are voting for tRump! If you are not happy with how things are now, then be part of the change that this country desperately needs! What we have now is a dictator that is killing our country!
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign likened Trump's comments and actions as "sabotage."
2020 Biden Accomplishments 1. Ended the #MeToo movement 2.  Made the most racist statement in politics “you ain’t black unless you vote for me” and 3 selected a vp who believes Bidens accusers and who’s ancestors owned slaves.
Apparently the “racist” part is ”false.” Not necessarily. Harris’ comments about Biden would lead one to interpret her calling him a racist. So through your point of view she did and I agree.   These “fact checkers” are being way too pedantic on this one.

I’ve been predicting that the Biden/Harris administration is going to be hostile toward the disabled. This doesn’t comfort me any, I hope he isn’t brought on if they win.
Let me tell you this, Joe Biden will NEVER be President! How does it feel to know that you are nothing more than a token? Black and a woman that’s all they based your qualifications on, but you’re really NOT black so...... just because you’re a woman 😂

“It’s not about your rights”  This should be troubling to all. Our rights are protected by the Constitution. Biden doesn’t have the option to override our rights just because he thinks it’s our “responsibility.” He could say anything is our responsibility to deny us our rights.

I can tell you this Catholic is voting for Biden and Kamala Harris!
I'm sure this question had absolutely nothing to do with trumpie saying yesterday that Biden should disavow antifa. Surely, this wasn't a plant!🤔
Voters opinions of Biden are clearly the least consequential thing in American politics right now, it does not matter one bit (unfortunately)
I agree with this, and I’ve gone back and forth between Jorgensen and Biden, but this honestly is NOT the year to vote 3rd party. 3rd party won’t win this year, and it’s splitting the Dem vote to ensure Trump wins.

The answer is going to be"no" because Biden is legally required to pick a person who is at least 35 years old. Which is two decades too old for Trump.
Joe Biden: I’ll cure cancer if elected president.   We can go back and forth all day with this.
You’re such a liar.   He hasn’t grabbed anything.  Obama/Biden caged children.  Google his track record in regards to helping blacks. He reversed Biden’s crime bill that hurt blacks.   But if you don’t vote for Biden “you aren’t black” so I guess this why you are voting for him.
Wake up everyone. A Biden Presidency will be the end of America! Go Trump 2020!
Biden will die before 2028, but he does have 49 years of doing nothing good for THESE united states.
Wooh. I rem. that interview and I intentionally skipped it.   China is definitely helping Biden. And Trump knows. My concern is if Biden wins, who is running the show? I’ve never believed a word Hillary said. It’s really time for her to meet her maker.  Thank you ✌🏻
And hunter Biden is rich because his daddy is big buddies with China. Good try
Biden is a fool🤷‍♀️
I’m so torn between Biden and Jorgensen, I don’t believe Jorgensen can win

Hey, Jack. Why not fact check this Biden lie?
Right now, Biden's choice to choose a VP should be someone to help heal the nation and Help fix the problems and Executive Orders that the past president has created

Right! When you bring home your paycheck on Friday there are four different taxes taking out of your check Federal State SS  Med Trump is giving back your federal not your SS. Then we’re going to have to pay it back if Joe Biden becomes president. Bc it’s not permanent
If Joe Rogan &amp; the Bros are committed to voting 45 out, which means voting for Biden, then I welcome their support just as I do Navarro’s. If Hispanic Dems believe 4 more years of 45 is best, they are amongst 29% of their own &amp; 13% of Black men who helped get us into this mess.
Twenty-nine percent of Latinos voted for 45 versus 8% of Blacks. Proof that Biden’s point has validity. Same point applies to the fact that 13% of Black men voted for 45 versus only 3% of Black women &amp; I welcome Navarro &amp; any others who will help regain the White House &amp; Senate.
She explains it so well.  Just listen to Joe Biden speak.... and the others.
Just a waste of time! Biden will not be President!
Where the hell did I ever mention Trump?? Seems a bit like you're the one hung up on him. I'm simply pointing out the obvious in terms of Biden's signs of worsening dementia, especially since it seems that his mental are faculties declining at an ever increasing pace.
Well, maybe Biden will keep his word to cure cancer if he is elected. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Within the party, there is some tension about how soon before the Democratic National Convention Biden should unveil his decision.
They did for now, but Biden adding them back wouldn’t surprise me at all
We ignore Joe Biden.
I’m not saying that Trump is sane by any stretch of imagination. I’m definitely saying that Biden most definitely is not a sane person either. I don’t think we have a “normal-same-level headed-stable member in either of the houses of Congress.
where is trump racist?? Where. JOE BIDEN  is racist.  Sen byrd good friends. Nancy Pelosi  father. The anti crime  bill  the assault weapon  ban. As a History major  i know better. You can't  fool me  its the Dems  party of the Kkk.
China &amp; all the dishonest Americans who have been receiving money from China at the expense of our government "would prefer Biden." Nancy included. Drain the swamp!
Its hard work trying to undo the many laws you (Biden) helped pass that put police in a position where they had to incarcerate nonviolent citizens.   It's hilarious you position yourself as a solution.  You are part of the problem.
Wake up sir. Trump can have any woman he wants and you think he wanted her? Do you also think the woman who accused Biden of attempting to finger her is telling the truth or is it one sided?
Trump allies have ears to hear Biden, eyes to see his actions which indicate his mental challenges. It's unethical for Democrats to promote him for president. Biden's family should be ashamed of putting him before the public to see his health issues making him an unfit candidate.
At least Trump took a few tough questions  Biden takes no tuff questions and if he does he calls the black reporter a “junkie”“This guy has been taking your dignity away and your respect,”” Trump said of former Vice President Joe Biden. “And I’m telling you on Nov. 3 you’re going to be getting it back.”
Biden literally said you aren’t black if you don’t vote for me. If Trump would’ve said that he would have been branded racist. How do you guys know which way is up or down anymore?
Taylor Swift is going to feel funny when Biden gets to be president and he takes your rights away you want have any freedom

Hey Jim.  Get back to us when Biden actually starts taking questions from the press.
We have a do nothing clown running with an old man who has late stage of Alzheimer’s Disease. Can’t imaging the progress Trump made being washed away if Biden be an POTUS. 585K poor folks jobs lost so they stay slaves to the do nothing party.

Trump got his nightmare ticket. Biden and Harris. That has been leaked. I liked almost all of our candidates for potus and VP but I am gratified to know he got exactly the ticket he feared hahaa. Doubt he ever had a paper cut before this not going his way
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign likened Trump's comments and actions as "sabotage."
Me too and I hope perhaps texas will ride with biden.
Hahahahaha it is so apparent that what I heard was true. That trump had soooo hoped biden wouldnt pick Harris. They reportedly have no clue how to attack her hahaha. I am actually enjoying their feeble attempts. Joe and Kam, I think u have them in a jam lmao
USPS openly endorsed Biden. Does anyone with a brain think that they will be fair and impartial? She is panicking big time. Don't let the fate of this country rest in the hands of someone else. Go to the polls and cast your vote.
USPS openly endorsed Biden. We will not allow the biased USPS to hand the election to Biden.
I hope Perez finds a spot for Beto, who endorsed joe early,  to speak at convention next week. He is not presently on list. Mistake as Texas is in play for us. Biden one point lead and Cornyn sen seat may be in trouble. Austin very progressive.
Biden called for a natl mandate on mask wearing today. I agree. Also Kamala rhetorically mused, " When will we get a vaccine?". On a show, Dr. Gupka retorted, " likely on November 1st." Lol. .y thoughts exactly
Wouldn’t it be Biden who’s in the White House? Nice try with that “spin” though 🙄
I really don’t see a Trump / Harris debate in near future; not that it would be a worry...  Now that I think about it; I don’t see a Trump / Biden debate in the near future either - Joe can’t get outta the basement...  I do believe this Dem ticket? Is YOUR worst nightmare #KAG 🇺🇸
Now do Biden
If Joe Biden is calling for a mask mandate, it's time to burn mine!
This is America. Be a patriot. Protect your fellow citizens. Step up, do the right thing,” Biden said.

Mr. Biden why didn't you chose a tiger to defeat Trump in November? Elizabeth Warren should have being your #1 VP picked.
I felt proud watching Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rollout today. They were wonderful! Very proud and blessed to have them fighting for us
Black folks are truly slave minded sheep...where was all this talk about Harris before Biden announced her as his running mate?
Biden and Harris were wondeful today, but I doubt a ticket with God and Christ on it can  defeat cheaters to the extent we now know we r dealing with. Cheaters have infiltrated sports more and more. How often we see an overt miscall cost the real " winner" the game. Cheating wins
except it's more like Harris/Biden; we know who will really be running things
Harris, Biden said at a high school gymnasium in his hometown of WIlmington, Delaware, is “smart, she’s tough, she’s experienced, she’s a proven fighter for the backbone of this country.”
Did realize Tucker Carlson was a Biden/Harris fan until last night when he informed his audience that PresidentTrashCan's agenda is dead in the waters because of the BlueWaveTsunami coming November 3, 2020. Thanks Tucker!

Screw that! Trump vs Biden and Pence vs Harris
Yeah I’m Taking Trump over Joe Biden
Minutes after Kamala Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate, sexist and false posts were circulating on social media.
It’s simple, a vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for communism and lawlessness.  A vote for Trump is a vote for our freedom and the right to continue to pursue the American dream.
Worst choice ever. I’m so excited. She even said Biden was racist
Wow, the Lincoln Project has already come out  with a wondeful ad. BIDEN AND HARRIS!!! Its wonderful. Traditional gops were not the same types as trump and his magas. I seldom agreed with their policy , but I did respect their character . They detest trump and their opp ads r gr8
He definitely is still a dangerous fraud, but at least he seems to now understand the need to beat Trump, unlike other progressive pundits like Crystal Ball, who tweeted out bullshit blaming Biden and Harris for most of the unfairness in our criminal justice system, smh.
Biden will not be President in 2020.
Joe Biden should have picked you as his VP he's going to regret it.
So I guess that means the Russians who supported Sanders campaign, and are still helping Trump, must also not like Biden’s VP Pick!
Kamala Harris literally called Joe Biden a racist and now she’s his running mate lol
I imagine u mute biden. By his own admission he makes gaffes  We r not flawless. If u expect that if me u think I am much better than I am
We have a team... maybe the strongest since Obama and Biden. I understand and relate to dems who did not favor this ticket. But all u should have to do is recall all the unnecessary lives lost bc of bozo bungling pandemic. And vote biden / harris . not being putin puppets helps
Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP is the equivalent of Palpatine picking Anakin as his Padawan. Biden will shock you, Harris will kill younglings.

Joe Biden is expected to announce his pick for vice president, as early as today, according to CNN.  #NationalNews
Kamala Harris might also be to whom he was referring when he promised to put the first black woman on scotus in RBG place and we know RBG will likely retire the moment Biden is announced to have won the WH
Thanks to John Kasich for speaking at our convention to implore fellow gops to vote Biden
As with a normal convention, Biden's acceptance speech will conclude the proceedings Thursday night. He is expected to speak live from his home state of Delaware, though the campaign has not announced a venue.

If the occasional gaffe is your concern then surely Biden is a hard No for you.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED Bravo, Ryan! There's only one way to ensure a Joe Biden defeat in 2020: sabotage mail-in ballots; close voting locations; scrub voter registration rolls; and, peel off BernieBros using a third party candidate. GOT IT!
Insane is thinking Joe biden would make a good president
I don't know if I've ever thought about it, but the utter lack of democracy in this process astounds me. Biden just gets to choose whoever he wants?? That's so much power in one person's hands
Fox News today; Bill Hemmer did Sean Combs seriously call white people Devils? Did he seriously call Biden a Devil too?
Byron York's Daily Memo: Actually, Joe Biden has plenty of time to announce VP
The VP choice may shift the focus of the race onto Biden -- not a place some Democrats are comfortable given his proclivity for gaffes and the lack of excitement behind his candidacy.
The point is that unlike your kid and Joe Biden, Trump is not in good enough shape to walk down a ramp without help, and there’s no way in hell he could ride a bike further than your 5 year old!
“Rion said that Derkach was just one of the people who have been giving her material.”  Andriy Derkach is a KGB-trained politician from a pro-Russian political party with the cheerful and apt nickname of ‘Ukrainian Putin’ — and he’s very proud of it.
Biden doesn’t wan’t to debate because he doesn’t know how stupid he’ll sound.   The Democratic party agrees. They know he’ll sound like a fucking idiot.   It’s sad to see an ill and elderly man being manipulated and abused like this.
Did you just reference polls? Polls were very certain in 2016 and they were very wrong. Biden is so unpopular that I believe hell win.
Yea. Half of the population supports Trump. He created the most powerful economy the world ever saw. He created so many jobs. My investments were growing at insane rates. (Still are). Biden is just an openly racist dementia patient.
Biden should be,what state am In,or is that my wife or my sister. 50 yrs in washington and hasnt done anything......
Biden is in no shape to debate trump,mentally
And how many do you think would be dead if Biden were President? We already know he was against the travel ban. And all of the things he said he would implement have already been implemented by Trump.
The old saying is if you every learned how to ride a bike you will never forget. It must be true because Biden forgets everything else!!!
Only that scum Biden 😡😡

Hmmmm , I’m pretty sure Biden said Trump said drink bleach, but when asked where he got that info he didn’t clarify, but hey look it up yourself . It took me 3 mins to find before I just posted false info to sound smart!!
All I can do is laugh. Biden is not who the Demoncrats have prepped for POTUS. He's a decoy. Please sign an executive order for stimulus. Demoncrats don't care if we live or die.
He will ANNOUNCE impending vaccine with grandiose ways he will disseminate it. After Ukraine we know he was willing 4 them to simply make an ANNOUNCEMENT they were investigating biden. He didn't care wasnt no there there
It has been leaked that intell is seeing russian activity to disparage and undermine biden , while boosting trump. Surprised? They r working on an even bolder scale than in 2016.and people think he will be hurt by NRA when world dictators r working 4 him? Lol

Same as last time. Trump is going to clobber Biden worse than he beat Hillary.  Watch &amp; learn people.
Although in some very specific issues it can be argued that Biden is worse than Trump. So it depends on what you focus.
I am saying that if Trump is a fascist authoritarian then Biden is a fascist authoritarian minus one.
When it comes to Latinx immigrants Biden was part of a government that deported far more of them than Trump.  That's not the same.
He was right about Biden picking Kamala
Obama deported more people than Trump. That's a plain fact.  It also has nothing to do with Biden being the same as Trump, or whether voting matters.
I hate to break it to you, but Joe Biden is much more mentally ill than Kanye West is.

House back in Washington Now! Plenty of time for vacation after Biden’s elected!
I got this . Biden is STUPID !
I am starting to worry that Biden will win the election because the consensus of why people are voting this year is “I think trump is a racist get him out of office” .. there are too many people who are uneducated in politics that are deciding a matter they don’t understand.
There are a lot of envious Biden supporters in this thread. Let's get in here and remind them why we are winning!
Oh no he's totally right. The media is going to say he won, then two years later we are going to find out that his staff destroyed millions of Biden ballots.
If those communist like AOC, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden,all those crooks win this time there will Not be another election lady if you care about your kids and your grandkids not being on their knees to Chinese communist party you better than Trump
Left fine with police unions endorsing, until they started endorsing Republicans.  Why should they support Dems who want to demonize and defund them?   Does she have a problem with  union endorsing Biden, even though they will be collecting millions of ballots?
Well here we have it all evil in again you vote Biden evil Harris, clintion , Evil witch Obama as I have said since January if democrats get in corrupt government again ppl wake up smell the coffe
You do realize no matter how bad trump may be on certain things america under Biden/Harris regime means we are ALL fucked.....

Major US postal workers union endorse Biden for president after Trump acknowledged starving the postal service of money to make it difficult to vote by mail in November's election.
Biden won’t take any question and that idiot asks that stupid question.
I get the feeling that’s a call you have about the same chance of getting as a coherent thought from Biden. It makes you wonder if these people even believe the nonsense their putting out or is it a case of enough money and they’ll say the earth is flat?
Well you argued that Obama was marginally better than Trump. Which is an accomplishment I guess. With Biden is hard to know.
So if Trump is a fascist, then Biden is fascist minus one.
Only 20% of the US population are committed democrats. If most people blame Biden then that's not gonna be a nice thing.
You have no answer for it. Just saying that Biden has leftist policies even though that's pretty questionable in most areas.
So people will blame liberals like Biden and Harris. Wouldn't that radicalize people to the right like with the Tea Party and the Alt-Right?
Vaush doesn't have a lot of points besides saying that Biden will somehow help the left in the US even though there is no evidence of that.
My point was that Biden/Harris wouldn't do this.
Newt, I love 'ya but nothing will change all this but leaders who start standing up and doing something not just talking, tweeting, blogging, podcasting. So do we just roll over and take it if (big if) Biden wins? GOP keeps saying, "Well, wait till November."

Ideologically speaking I agree. But the Democratic Party is being represented by power hungry globalists. Striking similarities between joe Biden and George bush jrs policies. I don’t see GWBjr as a good president. He got us involved in the Middle East. a known cluster fuck

Word meanings are arbitrary.  Political terms are useful insofar as they indicate a meaningful difference. With Biden and Trump it's more easy to indicate differences in something like global warming. But in foreign policy both are right-wing hawks.
Who does Harris think she is she does not pick who sits as a judge watch Biden not fit they know the ringer will come in shortly sit back and watch America burn if don’t vote Trump
Maybe libs really think that they can now do the flawless argument of saying that not voting for the Biden/Harris ticket is racist.
What will Hillary do if Biden steps down and Pelosi becomes Harris' vp? She said she wanted to help in any way that she could. Would she be willing to be in the shadows while puppeting Harris? Would Harris allow it?
Wonder how many radlibs are shocked about leftists not suddenly bending over and lining up to support Biden after he picked a cop as VP.
Biden is a right-wing nationalist.
Remember that the US is racist enough to reelect Trump. It is also racist enough to elect Biden.
The Twitter SJWs not waiting until December to hold Biden/Harris accountable (which they deserve to be) is the “new Hillary emails” of 2020. You’re literally just shooting the cause in the foot.

Everytime they come into leadership, we lose jobs, crime rates skyrocket, the cities and states get filthy, hates crimes start reoccurring (some of them wouldn't have jobs if they didn't exploit race - Al Sharpton, Kamala Harris, and Joe Biden), school performance declines!

The Supreme Court will not allow him to toss out valid mail in ballots. He can wail and scream all he wants but that’s not going to happen. There is also another scenario - Biden wins in-person votes (maybe by a slim margin) and Trump ends up needing mail in votes.
Do you think there’s any scenario, including tmassive foreign interference and indirect mail-in ballot tampering (USPS sabotage) and direct tampering (straight up interference from Fed govt), where Biden doesn’t win the popular vote anyways?

Hey bro-once biden is in office you can finally come out of the closet. Good days ahead for u!
Why are you ignoring Biden being a child sniffer #stophidinBiden
How about #JusticeForCannonHinnant instead of getting a shallow laugh? This is the bullshit you wanna tweet 😆 but nothing about all the pedos in y'alls isle either?well?  you're a coward. Biden sniffs kids on camera
I hope you didn't pay a lot for this video. The one of Biden on the train tracks was much more entertaining.
I think he underestimated Trump's chances last time, but I'm afraid we're going to see a lot more people scoffing at him and putting up their 99% Biden predictions
A FB friend posted: “I’ll eat expired, unrefrigerated sushi prepared in a hospital’s COVID ward by a homeless meth addict before I vote for Biden/Harris.” I agree! 🤣🤣🤣
Just wait til he learns that Biden might go after cheese next. We cannot let them cut the cheese.
If anybody even thinks about trying to defend this bs, delete yourself, because if you try to defend Trump's lawyer saying Kamala Harris (who was born in Oakland, CA) isn't American, you're an idiot and you're dead to me. Try Jesus...not me.
so is Biden.. 🤷🏽‍♀️
not a bunch of republicans ranting about Biden picking a VP based off of race. as if the GOP hasn’t picked white nominees the past 42 elections
Neither does Biden ) I mean if u have committed a federal offense- should u be allowed to run ?  Really ?  We need to know these things !
Because they realize that even if she wasn't their first pick, she and Joe Biden are our only hope to get rid of 45. If that's going to happen, we have to stick together. We can push for more progressive policy once the shit gibbon is out of office.  IT'S CALLED PRAGMATISM.
Donald trump sat back and let 140,000+ American citizens die under his nose.... how can Biden possibly be worse?!?
I sure hope ur right ! It’s just been dragging on to Long - I think The Who’s world is confused and needs so kind of truth to hold on too - and it needs to happen now - it’s getting to close to election time - and it’s a joke it they continue with this whole Biden - harris ticket
You have two choices Biden or Trump. Either way, you have to live with consequence of your vote or your failure to vote. The decision is yours. #vote2020
Good luck with that clown. Biden doesn't even know what day it is and his running mate doesn't know if she's Indian or African American. Y'all can't be this stupid to vote for ppl like that. Wait nvm, y'all really are that stupid.
He said not life shattering- we all know the investigation is wrapped up and there was federal crimes committed by Biden and Obama - get the info out - the more u keep it from us - the more ppl are going to say they have no evidence ‘
Trump be saying some ignorant shit but..... Biden a J O K E
I want Biden to give Hillary Clinton the authority to read him his Miranda rights. 😂
actually these people are being used by the Democratic Party to serve their needs getting Biden elected. the interesting part will be after the election when they are no longer needed.

Gonna pull a switcharoo on the Democrat party this November: Vote in Biden then IMMEDIATELY start backing the candidates that have true potential to dismantle the two party system.
Thank you ♥️, it's comforting knowing not everyone thinks he is reflective of our country but an absolute embarrassment and stain. Biden/Harris winning this Nov is crucial, as well as retaking the Senate. If we do that, I'm hopeful we can make things better and bring BIG changes
So Biden is an autocrat
Interesting?  I’m curious about the statement he made about no active investigation into Biden and Obama at this time - does this leave the door open for it to happen 60 days before the election ?  We want to know this before the election not after - it doesn’t take 6 years .....
If Biden’s elected yes. Even then Dejoy would argue he took the actions to make USPS more cost effective. How would you prove otherwise?
Joe Biden will wear his mask as Kamala wheels him to the podium..
You know we know who Joe Biden is, right?
So let me get this straight. Biden wants a “nationwide mask mandate” but how do they plan to enforce while simultaneously defunding the police? Someone explain....🙊 This gets better and better! Pass the popcorn 🍿

If Trump wanted the Nobel Peace Prize he should have helped make peace between North and South Korea. He had the perfect chance and fucked it. Also Biden and Harris are pretty hawkish so they are likely to go in the opposite direction.

Yes. A whole lot of people will go to jail IF Biden wins! But we MUST *work around* Trump’s obstacle. That’s why I’m jumping up &amp; down to ensure Dems 1. Hand deliver Absentee Ballots   2. Use drop box where available.

I’m so thankful I don’t have a job like these journalists where I have to listen to this nonsense Biden/Harris are spewing. I cannot stand being blatantly lied to or spoken to like I don’t have a brain.
I'm having a hard time figuring out which part of NoName's post bothered you? Do you feel like she's discouraging people from voting for Biden/Harris?
#PutinsPuppet  wants to use the Justice Department for a political hit piece... And weak-willed lap-dog Barr will probably do it.
can y’all let Biden and Kamala win before y’all slander them
Harris is busy “cleaning up” her social media posts!! 😂
What is the deal with this ?  I mean no criminal investigation into Biden and Obama ?  I thought that already happened !  I’m rather sick of lies - lies
Well we thought before the election but listening to Barr speak - are there even going to be any investigation into Obama and Biden ?  What the hell ?  We all know they know what was I the report by now - I’m just getting more aggravated! Really !
So I saw Barr talking - What’s the deal with saying they expect no criminal investigation into Obama and Biden ?  I thought we were expecting this to happen ?  Very confusing information right now ! Anyone agree ??)
Man is Biden creepy looking in this video yikes
knows this is a lie. The Biden-Harris team does NOT support defunding the police.
Do voters realize:  •Trump is now attempting to destroy USPS so people can’t vote by mail during deadly pandemic  •Kuschner met w/ Kanye in person &amp; they talk “almost daily” (in Trump effort to siphon votes)  •Trump solicited/blackmailed Ukraine to undermine Biden’s campaign
Jo Biden you will retire the presidency if you get in. Kamala has plans to take the presidents position by January 2021. That is what happens when you trust Democrats. Hell you should know all about being deceitful and Office. BoYa another Democrat gets justice.

Sometime next week, Biden's going to release an ad saying "I'm fighting for the little guy and standing up against Wall Street" and NONE of these media outlets will call him on it.
If Biden is unfit for a little debate then he's unfit for the office he's being propped up to run for.
Kamala "BLOW IT FOR BIDEN" Hairass
Biden conned Black America AGAIN. He said that he would pick an African American woman as VP. Instead, he picked an Indian Jamaican-Canadian who looks like an African American. He thinks Black people are one homogenous with little or no diversity - not even of thought. #Tokenism
Even Democrats don’t like Kamala Harris. In the Democrat primary, she did not even make it to the Iowa Causes or the New Hampshire primary  If Democrats don’t like her, how does Biden expect Americans to like her.
Kamala Harris blocked a hospital rescue to help SEIU   It would take hours to watch the videos of Kamala’s anti-America statements.  Harris is the successor to Biden.  Think of this nightmare: President Biden VP Kamala Harris Next in line: Pelosi

While speaking together as running mates for the first time Wednesday, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris sharply criticized President Trump’s job performance during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Honestly, I’m ok with the comparisons to 2016. It may just be the Nick Saban fan in me, but you have to play like you’re down 50 no matter how much you’re up by. I want everyone feeling Trump will somehow win this thing until Biden actually beats him. Complacency begets defeat.
Bruh it’s been time to get Trumps orange ass and Biden’s Alzheimer’s ass the fuck out of here. Most importantly, PLEASE get the federal government the fuck out our everyday lives, they’ve been doing WAY too much for WAY too long
The racism was directed at all races including blacks.  Biden, by limiting the choice to a black woman participated in the less obvious form of racism that assumes that a black woman can’t make the cut on her own merit.  Joe believes this like most liberals but I do not...
Anyone who actually believes that Biden will only lose Texas by one percent is sipping too much happy juice.

According to you &amp; Biden, Fauci was wrong on everything. Per Fauci’s own words, the President consistently implemented measures recommended by him. So if you’re not happy with the President’s performance on Covid, you can blame “never wrong” Fauci.

The major bonus that I see is at least the influence from the party will be towards a more positive outlook in the legal system rather than how the judges have looked under trump’s presidency. Human rights issues are at risk and Biden is the only option to kinda hold onto them
Opinion | Kamala Harris was the safest, most experienced and most tested choice Biden could make
Agree but not betting Trump. will be closer than folks think in fact already tightening up a bit from highs seen last month. If you want to bet Biden wait it out a bit post Republican convention then buy till you can't buy no more
Y’all I’m too upset I have to vote for Biden in November 😭
Joe Biden has selected hard-left liberal U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris to be his running mate in the November election. Harris is known to oppose nearly every policy LFF supports, and her radical record proves it.
She's arrogant and silly.  She will be the demise of Joe Biden.
I don’t think this is about Biden and the 25th amendment but like.... isn’t it, though?
I guess trump is voting for a better candidate.....
Yeah, that all seems right. Just meant as a general point about the point estimates to scare out the overconfidence. True that the steadiness so far makes Biden's est more precise, though the time left in the campaign makes that more imprecise than the Nov 1 estimate for Clinton.
Whewwww I’m so happy i ain’t gotta talk about Kamala/Biden today. Don’t wanna say the wrong thing on tv and get cancelled 😪

In 538's models, Biden's likely advantage over Trump at this point is *identical* to Clinton's just before the election. Mind Fivey Fox's warning. This'll be a close election, as we've been saying all along. Trump is still in a position where he could plausibly win the EC vote.

*stares at you in Biden*
Joe Biden better dhs when he get in office 💪🏾
😂😂😂😂😂 Par for the course.  Biden/Harris the best we can do as DEMS?!?!  Oh lawd fissin to be 4 more for Trump. Thanks dems
We gotta choose between blatant overt racism with Trump or mildly veiled racism with Biden.
We laid down for our President and kept our mouths shut. We will not shut up this time. We won’t be ruled by the Democrats again. TRUMP/PENCE 2020. Pence will tear her up in a debate. Biden won’t debate Trump. If he does he will get tore up too.
I want to know what Biden/Harris will do to stop these murders. No more disingenuous vote shaming.
Pro-Lifers: Biden-Harris ‘Most Pro-Abortion Presidential Ticket in History’
She isn’t African American.  She is Indian/Jamaican!  Shows you that Biden/Democrats really don’t think an African American could do the job.  Blacks need to wake up and see how the Democrats are using you.
mane joe biden didn’t even know where he was at a press conference a couple weeks ago 🤣.
Trump voters aren’t a monolith, and a lot of them will probably be #NeverKamala, not pro-Trump.   The GOP has to hold their nose and vote for Trump because they want the R to win but they are corporate and Trump isn’t a puppet. The Romneys of the world might vote Biden.
Definitely gotta put Joe Biden in office ✊🏿
Biden is nowhere near as rich as trump, so if biden wins we will never get another round of stimulus checks.
Love this especially cause Biden was pro segregation LMAO
I wonder where the newfound Kamala Harris “supporters” were when she was in the primaries? It’s all Black Girl Magic/HBCU love/Divine 9 pride since she’s tapped to be Biden’s political caretaker, but where was y’all energy when she was running for Biden’s nomination? 🤔
Wow. I'm not sure I can identify the religion of most nominees. What's awhile? That would mean that Obama-Biden had no Catholics either. I'm a lifelong Catholic. What I want to see come through is the person's character, no matter what demographic they are a part of. Shameful.
I am voting for the Biden Harris ticket!
Well, Ryan... You won't get a better world if Donald Trump gets re-elected. If you fight to sink Biden/Harris, you're going to cause Trump to get re-elected. Then he's going to hurt this country much more than in his first term. Don't be part of the problem.
Between August 4 &amp;11, I’ve received 21 messages from Trump’s campaign team. None of those texts had mentioned Biden but the last 2. And those two messages came right after Biden picked Harris as his VP, &amp;some are asking “what’s powerful about it?” Trump’s camp knows. #BidenHarris
Cenk's comment have been getting better after Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris rather than Elizabeth Warren. It's amusing.
why are some sean astin fans so pressed that he supports biden/harris??
That is not nearly the whole point. The DNC heard the voices of change and told them to stfu; and if you don’t like it, vote for someone else.  News flash: people are going to vote for someone else, or not vote.  A voice for Biden is a voice for corporations.
How it happened: Inside Biden's search for a running mate.
President Donald Trump says he’s “a little surprised” that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.
If biden wins, pompeo and barr will be sweating like 2 corrupt honey baked hams
I thought he did that by being Joe Biden..
Oh, I vote. I probably will even vote for Biden now that trans healthcare is being held hostage
Biden chose Kamala so he could get the black vote but that lady then did so much wrong to her own people like why would I vote for her? Fuck bruh this gonna be a tough one. They making trump look good.
Biden heard it. Unfortunately, those memories exceed his 45 second retention limit.
Kamala Harris joins the ranks of great presidents /Vice Presidents chosen to serve the USA. All were or are the lineages of immigrants. The choice of Kamala Harris as Joe Biden’s running mate will undoubtedly bring America closer to “we hold these truths to be self evident . . .”
So I finish this political twitter rant with this: 1. Don’t let anyone shame you for not wanting to vote for Biden/Harris 2. Don’t vote just to get a person out of office. Actually think about why you’re voting for someone 3. A third party vote =/= a vote for Trump
And another thing Harris is literally the worst vp Biden could’ve chose. She’s literally a cop who did horrible things to poc and poor people in California. Like make it make sense. She is the literal embodiment of Black representation is not always Black representation
I really find it funny how people who plan on voting for Biden/Harris can never tell you why they’re voting for them other than to get trump out. Like give me actual reasons. And don’t tell it’s because Biden was Obama’s vp bc we don’t like him either.
Then u brought up Biden lmao
What does Biden and Kamala Harris have anything to do with this conversation?
Now THAT is frightening!!!
I laughed SO hard when I started to read this headline:  “ Biden taps Kamala Harris”!!!!!! 😂  I have no doubt that THIS could possibly be true!!!
We're all entitled to our opinions, but Biden dominated the black vote before the dropouts. You can argue that it's more regional (southern/sunbelt voters preferred him), but in a crowded field, black voters wanted Biden.
She  is not black? Her mom is Jamaican and dad Indian from India? Democrats are pushing her in as Black to win the Black votes. Biden  does have dementia. She will be President if Democrats gets office. There should be an intense protocol  for who wants to qualify
If Biden was among the least popular, he wouldn't have handily won the Democratic nomination. In fact, he won more than 5x as many contests as the second place finisher.
She is not BLACK. Her mom is. Jamaican and her dad is Indian from India. Dems are pushing her through as BLACK, counting on BLACK votes to push Biden in and Karama will move from VP to President cus Biden has Dementia.
Dems are pushing her through as BLACK. She is not BLACK. Her mom is Jamaican and dad Indian from India. The lies have started on the first day cus she has not corrected and announced her real nationality. Dems are counting on black votes to Win Biden as Pres
I like how Biden just tried to intimate he's always stood against the big banks.  Wonder if any of the media will ask Senator MBNA about that next time they chat...
I want Karama to tell she is NOT BLACK?? She is riding in on a lie. BIDEN did not pick her. The Demonsts hand picked her and they do not want BLM or ANTIFA  to know she is Jamaican and Indian not black.
Possibly becoming the unelected President of the US came with “irrefutable evidence” that all of those women were making it up? I’ve seen video evidence of him GROPING them so you never know! 😝
Katana has already started lying like every politician does. She IS NOT BLACK. Her mother is Jamaican and her father Indian from INDIA.  Why is she not correcting the MEDIA. Biden and Karama are MISLEADING The BLACK POPULATION. Why is she not telling people?
Yes, that's exactly what is happening. When the black liberal community tells Biden that to get their votes he has to pick a black female running mate, that's what she's being chosen for- her color and her sex. Any other qualities she might have are secondary. THAT'S hateful.
i’ve heard so much worse about biden then i have about trump. but i honestly don’t really have an opinion on either. just all hearsay for me.
i haven’t really followed politics much. but what has showed up in my feeds and stuff has painted both biden and trump in a bad light. they both seem terrible. but honestly. i have no idea. no idea at all. i’m trying to not pay attention to it for as long as possible until i must
Other than the fact that Biden is a confirmed Catholic, this is another reason I find my faith in the Catholic Church waning. God does not play favorites, and bishops of all people should know that.
Are we taking bets as to when Biden steps down due to "health concerns" if elected?
Thinking about how Amy Klobuchar was pretty much certain to become Biden's VP, but the murder of George Floyd happened, and it turned out she was an accessory on the murder. Then the establishment dems started insisting Biden's VP had to be a woc just to block Elizabeth Warren.
Biden needed someone to help him lock up more black men.
Kudos on that, hope you vote Biden\Harris, so your Godchild has a chance....
Tennessee is #12 In new COVID-19 cases. What does Tennessee have to lose? Could Biden\Harris possibly do worse than trump\pence\blackburn? I don't think so.......
Taking America back to locking up more black people.
Biden/Harris are for the murder of the unborn. Therefore voting for Trump/Pence is easy.
Joe Biden is a lifelong practicing Catholic
Prepare for 3 months of vote shaming. Endless “iF yOu dOn’T vOtE fOr biDeN yOu ArE vOtIng fOr tRuMp!”  Endless demands to VOTE as if that one act will magically change your situation.
“ Bennett also questioned whether the Biden campaign will use the choice of Harris to "reach out" to police and law enforcement groups that may be tempted to endorse President Trump.” HARRIS??  After how the Democrats have ATTACKED them? 😂
Seeing as I’m 1 for 1 on the Biden administration’s executive officers, I’d like to see: Joyce Vance, Sally Yates, or Doug Jones for AG Susan Rice for State Anthony Fauci for HHS Elizabeth Warren for Treasury
So he picks the woman who SLEPT her way into her CAREER as his VP huh? 😂  Maybe Old Joe figures SHE won’t “bitch” about his “sniffing” habits?
Well if you want to say that neither Democrats nor Republicans at the White House Level have done much to vastly improve Black communities. What do you say about Biden being responsible for putting many Black people in FEDERAL prison? Again I just don’t Like Mrs. Harris’ politics
Agreed.  Why else would biden announce picking a black woman in advance if this wasn't the plan?  So predictable!
I believe that Biden is just a pawn that is used only to get into the White House. Kamala is the real candidate. Biden will be declared incompetent and removed from office. Then, in goes Harris. A democrat in the White House.
Y’all boy Biden has f*cked up more Black lives than almost any other politician Republican or Democrat but y’all want me to vote for him and Mrs. Harris. I f*ck around and not vote AGAIN 🥴
Left wing or right wing same bird it Joe Biden is just as fucked up as trump
Your not hurting my feelings. I don’t support either Trump or Biden. I don’t support anyone as President, House, Senate, or SCJ that’s over the age of 60.  Try something else.
God I hope so. America deserves better than crusty old Trump or Biden.
What to do? Joe Biden not the moderate he used to be. Revolutionary Communist Party, USA endorsing him. And Angela "We can pressure him" Davis. Plus Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke and AOC claiming he's theirs. Now Kamala Harris: our next president when he resigns?
And Dr. Biden, as well!
News Flash,  crime is up, under trump. Law &amp; Order, Biden\Harris!
If they let us, we can do a lot. Biden has been using virtual phone banks, ActBlue has a texting network.  I can write in a persuasive manner. We all have skills that can be useful.
not biden AND kamala.......y’all rlly don’t want me to vote like at all at this point
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday.
it’s “Comma-La”.   Richard should be embarrassed for his suggestions.  Richard confirmed if you don’t vote Biden/Harris you are a racist and sexist.  God Bless this country.
Why would Biden not serve his full term or if or when? #stophidinBiden
Congratulations Senator Kamala Harris on being selected as the running mate for presumptive Democratic nominee, Joseph Biden!  Senator Harris is an HBCU Alumna of Howard University and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated.  #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden couldn't recognize himself in the mirror.  Michael Brown was a criminal and tried to grab the cops gun.  "Hands up, don't shoot" was a lie
What would people say if Biden decided to only consider white males for his Vice President? People would think that he was being racist...But as long as the racism is against white folks it’s ok I guess...Sad times...I always thought that all racism was wrong!
Biden is about to get Covid!  He just doesn’t know it yet!   Enter Hillary Clinton,,,,,,   Clinton / Harris 2020
Heh, defending Biden, Kamala, and the MSM. I’m sure this dude thinks our foreign policy rocks also (as long as working class kids serve as cannon fodder).  I don’t think I could portray an out of touch democrat better if I tried.  Comical in a sad clown kinda way.
If y’all not gone vote for Biden, then who y’all voting for? I’m just trying to gauge how y’all gone split the vote
If that’s “HUGE”, just wait until you hear how Trump reads his scripts. 🙄😆 I’ll bet Joe Biden can pronounce “Yosemite” from his script.
Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema are moderates. Murk and Collins are moderates. Heck, compared to Harris, Romney is a moderate.  I'm not annoyed that the Dems have a notably progressive VP, especially since Biden prefers to moderate. But be intellectually honest about her policies
How many times will joe Biden use Covid as an excuse to opt out of a debate.
KAMALA FUCKING HARRIS AS BIDEN'S VP ???!?!?!?!?! YOU'VE GOT TO BE SHITTING ME
Biden is about to get Covid, he just doesn’t know it yet!  Enter Hillary Clinton.  Clinton / Harris 2020
In a time of political and social unrest in major US cities because of failed criminal justice systems, it is ALARMING that Joe Biden chose the person who broke and abused California’s criminal justice system from the inside out. So, what do you stand for? Right....
“I don’t work for you” -Joe Biden
Yessss please I pushed her for Bernie’s VP, Biden’s (*gag*) VP, president, anything that gives her more power to keep being awesome.
Anybody notice how the stock market reacted to biden picking heels up harris?
Joe Biden + Kamala Harris??? Together they finna throw every black man in America in prison!!!!!
If progressives want to win. Stop counting out the base of the party. Did I say 55% of Blacks live in the south?   I did. Remember it.   Biden won the nomination because he swept the south. Learn from the mistakes so we don’t repeat them.   I see a #NewBlackSouth #KeepPushing
I love Bernie. Voted for him in 2016 and 2020. You know who came to my state multiple times? Kamala Harris. Joe Biden.   I think Bernie came once.   You know who has come to Louisiana repeatedly? Trump.   He goes after the south. Democrats just give it to Republicans.
You called  a racist and a segregationist then you said you believed his accuser that Biden sexually assaulted her. How can you accept the VP nomination of such a vile, disgusting man?
He did his job today for the black community electing a black woman as VP (tokenism) even though that black women spent her entire career locking up black folks in California. I don’t even have to mention Biden &amp; his 94 crime bill. We still feeling those affects today.
Because we didn’t hold any of these candidates to have a black agenda they’re not obligated to do anything for black people. Now i ask you big brother. What reason does Biden have to fight for black folks when he already knew the majority is voting for him.
If Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are embracing the “Radical Left” that would actually be great!
Please let us know one good thing by Biden or Kamala Harris has done for the black community I think he was harsh on prison reform I cannot think of one positive thing of biting has ever done while he's been in elective office ...name one.. quit being a sheep
Like it or not, Joe Biden has spent decades building relationships. It’s paid off for him.   There is value is learning even from those we disagree with.   I don’t think Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris are perfect.   I know Donald Trump is hot garbage though.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
To be fair, no matter which of the women Biden picked, she would be termed "unlikeable", "shrill" and other words I'm not going to repeat.
A lot of people talked about her record as a prosecutor but her job was to prosecute. It wasn't her fault that a lot of defendents were black. People got mad at Christopher Darden for prosecuting OJ but were at home saying he did it. That was their job.
Damn I was really gonna vote for Biden too but idk about that whole Biden/Harris  thing
Y’all think Kamala Harris still thinks Joe Biden is racist?
Blink twice if Biden is behind you smelling your hair, we’ll get help!
Y’all was gone complain about whoever Biden picked because it’s Biden. So just make sure you vote for him on November 3rd. Mmkay?
Sen. Kamala Harris being selected as Joe Biden’s running mate is historic.   As a Black man in America I celebrate Sen. Harris becoming the Vice Presidential nominee. She adds value to the ticket that could drastically change Biden’s campaign.
Typical Dems. Global pandemic? Here’s the guy who opposes M4A for president, oh and he told WI it was safe to vote even tho the CDC said no.   Nat’l unrest over police brutality? Biden says shoot zem in ze legs and fund the police. Oh, and a cop for VP.   #BidenHarris2020
The value she brings is a connection to a new generation of voters which TBH Biden - as a older guy needed. She also connects him to women and women of color which he also struggles with. I don't think you are really being serious in ur question but there ya go.
Liz Warren was my choice for president and then VP. While I’m saddened she won’t be on the ticket in November, my heart swells knowing this amazing woman is still out there supporting Biden/Harris while working hard for us! #BidenHarris #VPPick #BidenHarris2020
Biden won’t even come out of his basement...Trump takes a assassin attempt like he spilt his coffee!🤔🇺🇸
Hey, you guys need to cut Joe Biden some slack. He did the best he could after he discovered Ronald Reagan had rather inconveniently decided to shuffle off this mortal coil some time ago.
Biden consistency makes inconsistent actions
Biden know what he doing 😂 cause AKAs gone step 😂
Say what you will about what they've done or didn't do, at the very least they're both patriots. I cant say that I'm happy, but I also don't have the energy to be upset when so much is on the line. The stakes have changed, Biden/Harris 2020
Ok, Biden announced his VP pick. Now we can all return to our regularly scheduled loathing of the US government.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate
bad move biden
🗣 joe biden went got a afro american to lead us to the slaughter house.... i said what i said
Major alert!! 🚨🚨 Sen. Kamala Harris has been chosen as Biden’s VP!! #GeauxDems
Does Biden picking Harris give Trump a serious chance to turn things around and win in November? Seriously does that make swing voters run from Biden?
No one should be at all surprised at Biden’s VP pick. The entire election system is rigged from the very moment the “candidates” are rolled out.
this runs contrary to these recent pieces
I don’t trust the inside emotions of white people enough to trust in a Biden Victory at the polls. 🥴
How am I supposed to study for 2 cumulative finals tomorrow when  was just announced as Biden's VP?   Happiest day of my life since Nov. 9, 2016!!! 🥳   So much hope!!! #BidenHarris2020 👩🏾👨🏻‍🦳🇺🇸
I refuse to vote for Biden.
Biden and Harris 2020 I guess 😭🤟🏼
My ol lady just gave me point after point after point why Kamala is a good selection. Black women bout to make sure Biden win.
Lol Kampala was the worst pick possible and Biden took a nosedive straight into that poor decision
So since Biden got dementia we really about to have the first woman president who also black
Also don't tell people to shut up about this VP pick Biden is already an incredibly difficult candidate to get excited about and this does not help that, at all. We're allowed to be critical of our candidates.
BIDEN - HARRIS sounds like a center half pairing for Leeds United
Do you remember when Kamala Harris ripped Joe Biden a new one live on national TV and then later he was like, "Poo poo, pee pee poo poop pee poopy poop" because that's the shit I'm here for.What a ridiculous response. So the things they say during a debate doesn’t mean anything. She is a liar and Biden is a poor judge of character. She was chose for only two reasons. Female minority.
I don’t ask for perfection. I detailed two important near term goals the US President must lead in our fight against COVID. Trump hasn’t done well so far and thinking Biden a better fit.
I told you that Obama sees him as that "Albatross" around his neck and had to keep him around as "Court Jester" and Token White Boy. That Bromance crap is facade.
Fuck Joe Biden
How would Joe Biden protect the social Security benefits when he has vowed to spend $2 Trillion on Climate Change ?
Hey if you have older conservative relatives, especially if they live in a rural area, make sure they know what’s going on with the USPS. My Republican grandparents are PISSED and voting for Biden.
We are in a very vulnerable position as true Americans. The DEMs have very little time left. They will break any law. Do not concentrate on your friends that have told you that they are voting for Biden/Harris. They have no idea themselves who they would be putting in Power.
Healsup Harris is enjoying the attention of Biden sniff and touch routine.
Which is why he backed Hilary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in 2016.  Which is also why he immediately backed Joe Biden over Sanders, Castro, AND Warren this time.
The poor little bused girl, and by Joe according to her! Biden/Byrd
The mass incarceration of a target demographic is violence. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have committed violence against our communities. We can not let them forget that.
The perfect Biden Gif.👍😂
Dr Claud Anderson on Kanye West, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden  via  This is a must watch video for my ppl✊🏾✊🏾!! We can &amp; must unite as a ppl to leave this world better than what our ancestors, parents &amp; even we ourselves are living through.
thanks for the follow. I keep working at it. Truth through humor. I think it's called observational humor if you're a liberal and you're a racist if you're a conservatives/Republican and Trump supporter. Joe Biden in his basement.😂
Who died and made Joe Biden king?
Need I continue to remind you. Biden had no say in his choice. He was told she was it and you will like it, mofo.
That was a different issue, and she didn't mislead Congress. She told Congress she was informed about Burisma and Biden's Son's involvement in a debriefing when she got the job. She didn't lie.
I would love to experience the privilege of choosing morality. Unfortunately, poor BIPOCs do not have that luxury in this country.   Not voting for Joe Biden = a vote for Trump and that is the [sad] fact.
Are you— you can not be serious.   There is a HUGE difference between Joe Biden winning and Donald Trump staying in office.
Biden/Harris is the only good choice this time. And Rob Anderson in my District.
No, the issue was a Presidential Impeachment.  It doesn't matter what Biden's son did in that context.  That would be a matter for an actual court, not Congress.
The GOP also called their own witnesses, they were only denied witnesses who they wanted to bring in for an entirely different matter.  It was about Trump's behavior not Biden's Son's behavior, so witnesses they wanted to talk about Biden's Son were denied.
Biden and Harris?
Biden announces Harris as his running mate. A little SNL humor.
Here's your original tweet after which I asked you to provide any court cases involving minors against Biden.
Just as strong as the "evidence" you have for Biden. Same shit... different side. You're a hypocrite.
Yes, I already saw the shitty compilation presented by the other guy. There is just as much "evidence" online about Trump. Please send references to the court cases involving minors against Joe Biden. Muchas gracias.
Please send references to the court cases involving minors against Joe Biden. Muchas gracias.
No Biden lies all the time and calls other people lying horse face pony soilders
Biden almost makes LBJ look like a Civil Rights Activist. Now we know who the inspiration for "Big Daddy" in "Django Unchained" was.
If you like what you see happening in America -all the hate, discord, being the No.1 country to harbor a raging pandemic with no leader to bring it under control, the environment being torn apart by rich people wanting to be richer - then don’t vote.If you want better,VOTE Biden!
Well thanks for taking time with me. I definitely am trying to change your mind about Trump  b/c he’s the only one left who believes in “We the People”. We won’t have to worry about immigration if Biden gets it cause we’ll be just like Cuba &amp; China &amp; Mexico, etc 😢  Thx again! ❤️

You know if Biden gets elected he won't be President long because his health and mental state is rapidly declining. So, Kamala might be our future President, &amp; mark my words, Black's will get reparations ( free monthly check) for something that was settled over 150 plus years ago
There is nothing baseless about this astute observation. She only stated what most of us already know. Epstein didn't kill himself either.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris running for president and VP is the comic relief we needed for 2020 🤣😂 #Trump2020
When the word “alleged” was used for R. Kelly y’all didn’t care and cancelled him without a second thought. But now that it’s Joe Biden it’s “oh we don’t know if he did that for a fact” save them double standards for someone else.
Biden/Harris doesn’t even seem fair.
I love this ticket, Biden and Harris yes yes
You are going to make us a socialist which becomes communist Country.  Tell the people the truth.  You &amp; Biden are lying through your teeth to the people.  God Bless President Trump &amp; God Bless America!! Trump 2020
I’m not believing what Biden and Harris are saying about the Trump administration.. I feel I’m in the Twilight Zone
What did they give Biden to make him be able to speak clearly and follow the prompt.  This is the first time I heard him be able to make a sentence.  The speech was a bunch of BS. He did not tell the people he was going to take away their choices, Freedom.
Sang in auto tune: iiiiiii don’t like joe biden
Joe Biden a pervert and Kamala Harris goes home a kisses a white man goodnight after a long day putting black people in jail for marijuana. I’ll pass on them too🏌🏾‍♂️
Isn't Harris the one who stated she believes Biden's accuser's and now she has defend him and doing a "Hillary" and enabling him. She has once again prostituted herself for the chance at power.
I’m one of those suburban wives, and I assure you I will be voting for Biden-Harris!

Biden should concern the Democratic Party. I think that Harris is a mute point. But that's me...
She supported gay marriage before Obama, Hillary or Biden.
New video by Breakfast Club Power 105.1 FM: How Important Is It For Joe Biden To Pick A Black Woman As His VP?
You mean to tell me there’s people that take Joe Biden seriously?
God forbid that Joe Biden is our next President. It will be the end of America the sequel. We lost the Panama Canal in 1977.
Biden screwed his African American supporters. He didn't pick an African American. Da Dah!
Remember when Kanye said he could beat Biden in write ins alone😩now look at us
Could the democratic party have picked two worse candidates than joe biden and kamala harris? sheeeeesh
As the late Mexican comedian Chespirito would say "She was just joking about what she said about Joe Biden."
So are we voting for Crusty Trump or Pedo Biden this year? Or Crazy Kanye ?!? #wearefucked
I know I was reaching but I wish Biden would have named Obama his vice
Does Biden know yet?😳😳🤔🤔🤔
Since she's willing to stand up to Biden, wouldn't that make her better than Mike Pence?  So, is this your way of endorsing her?
No, I wouldn't say that's true.  She is someone who ran to be President herself, and was willing to debate against him on stage.  She was higher on my hopeful President list than Biden himself was.  She's a solid choice.
Wow, so Biden is willing to pick someone who will Challenge him. Someone who isn't afraid to go toe to toe with him on important issues.  That's amazingly brave and wise of him.  You won me over, Biden/Harris 2020!
Great VP choice. Best VP choice since Biden.
Joe biden picked kamala Harris for vp. My kid could pick a booger better than that. GOOD LUCK FOLKS. #trump2020  #BidenHarris2020
I keep telling you, Biden hasn't picked anyone. She was picked for him.
I wonder if she still thinks he’s a racist? 🤔 And I wonder if Biden thought he was picking, Kamala Harris the wrestler?
Biden has picked anyone including his nose. His neferious Socialist/Communist agenda driven Democrat Handler's picked her.
Biden didn’t pick anybody. His handlers did.
Lol now y’all fake mad bout Biden picking Kamala Harris, of course it wasn’t gone be Michelle 🤦🏾‍♂️
She’s a JOKE!! No Biden vote for me!!!
Biden names Kamala Harris as running mate. Great Choice!
Biden/Harris ticket?!

Obviously meant WWI and all you “history experts” need to fact check your shit! WWI and the Spanish flu epidemic are most definitely linked! Joe Biden doesn’t even know where he is half the time!
Well he had my vote in 2016 and in 2020 ,he will only lose if Democrats are allowed to cheat by mail vote and tell Joe Biden absentee voting not the same as the fraud they want to perpetuate
What an exciting line up Biden has selected. He had to scrape the bottom of the barrel for these past losers. They are all “Has Beens.”  COME ON MAN!!!!!👎👎👎👎
Nothing like playing Racial Politics and resorting to political extortion.
The way Biden is dragging this out, his VP better be Beyoncé. Good God man just announce already.
If Biden wins ya'll deserve him.
Trying to buy that spot, are we? Isn't that unethical? Oh, I fogot it's Democrat's doing it, so it be good to go.
I’m really looking forward to who the replacements will be!  I can pretty much assure it won’t be Biden’s family or friends.
Wow, are you saying he wants a functional government that takes care of people's needs now and the future through ensuring people have a good education and having an Earth to live on?  I was on the fence before, but you convinced me.  Biden 2020 all the way!
If you take both political sides and see who's saying what, i don't think either of the two has a lead on a public perception of Mental Health.  One side thinks Trump is unfit, the other side things Biden is unfit.
It brings in to question why he needed such a test, and the way he described it opened up the door to a lot of mockery.   As much of any of Joe Biden's gaffes.
Perhaps, but I'm going to vote for the person most likely to surround himself with good people who are able and willing to run the Executive Branch.  To me, between the two, that's Biden.
If you were to compare just the two, they are both old white guys who have public image issues in regards to their mental health.  Biden has a stutter, and makes "gaffs", while Trump seems to not even have a basic understanding of most subjects, and cognitive issues.
To bad all their votes will be for Biden, even though they don’t know it.
He's not an option no matter if you believe in God or not. He is pure unadulterated Socialist/Communist Evil and they will destroy America should they gain total control. Nov is truly a war/fight for the heart and soul of the country
Everyone knows Biden sold America out
Joe Biden was born a natural born idiot and had a relapse.  🙇‍♀️What a shame that he really hates our black friends.  GO TRUMP!!!!! We will win!!!!!!
Funny week. First Trump supports Obamacare, then he supports Biden's past tax cut proposals. Are we sure Trump didn't switch to the Democratic party?
I feel sorry for the person that Biden chooses for a running mate.  That would be 4 long years of torture.
Here's a Conspiracy Theory they haven't floated yet, that neferious forces might "Scalia" Biden and he dies mysteriously in his sleep. Think about it?
The real sad thing is that the Real Joke is the Old White Man. He meant what he said, like he's in charge.
I think Biden was referring to Crackhead Hunter, when he made that comment about being a Junkie.
I’ll gladly take your $400 a week  Donald and still vote for Biden in November thank you
I’m not crazy about the girl but she has said repeatedly on The View and on twitter that she is voting for Biden.
She has said she will vote Biden on The View many times. Get your facts straight!
Joe Biden is the ring leader for being the biggest liar among the Democrats. He also has a lot of “relatives” too!!!!!!!
Spoken by a Russian asset. You are taking fake propaganda from Russia and weaponizing it in Congress to attack Biden. You are a traitor to American democracy.
He stepped on it again. Hell, he doesn't even know who they want to be President should they pull it off.
Kanye West's unlikely White House bid is getting help qualifying for presidential ballots in key states from Republicans around the country.
That's what they get paid to and if they were Fair and Unbaised they would show the uniformed masses what and who he really is and that they need to Wake Up.
It is my understanding that Biden is going to pick a female of color for his VP. I don’t care about race or sex. I want to know qualifications. Businesses are not allowed to discriminate by race or sex. Why are those DNC requirements?
President Trump believe what is right for our future, freedom by not taking advantage from China, Iran, Russia! That’s why Iran, China’s Coronavirus, Syria hadn’t dropped any nerves bomb! Pres Obama, Biden failed save lives at Syria twice! Syria President escapes  to Russia!
See what President Trump been fighting against China, Iran! Several times President Trump went back fought  China’s Tariffs and won! China couldn’t handle it still refused admit being responsible for Coronavirus, look what happened now! Countries died Biden will say we’re wrong!
This just end, Biden gets every vote under the age of 25 cause they all realize that running a government based on the views of the world's most popular imaginary friend is fuckin stupid. Separate church and state #Biden2020
Kidding me look at Joe Biden did at Ukraine’s for his son Hunter and made him richer plus Biden’s! Pres Obama knew Biden’s also Clinton’s doing! Look at FBI covered up by Comey, Strzok, McCabe! FBI bleached record for President Obama, Biden, Clinton, Rice spy Trump’s on 1/4/17!
Coronavirus is blame from China! Remember other countries is suffering! China is denied the responsible for Coronavirus! China, Iran is threat USA! President Trump is fight for our future plus it’s belong to USA! Biden gives China, we lose our future!
It is on MSNBC. Rachel Maddow did a lengthy segment on it. She even pointed directly at Grassley and Johnson as recipients of Russian lies to malign Biden.  They're in effect, Russian assets working on behalf of Trump.
That's what they get paid to do. There no such thing as Fair and Balanced in their narrative. That's what State Run Gobbelesque Media does.
Would someone please buy Joe Biden’s wife a new dress.  She is no Melanie Trump!‼️‼️
That sounds suspicious don't it?
We don't need Good Ole Ben to tell us this. We already know it would happen.
Why do you keep bringing up Biden? I have never once said Biden would make a good president.
Good morning, America! How are the Democrat's and Biden and the others promising to destroy America today?
just out of curiosity, does Chris Wallace get paid extra to defend Biden? His comments this morning showed his bias against Trump. He was asked about Biden’s comments yet his answer was basically...”yeah but Trump...” (paraphrasing) 🙄
