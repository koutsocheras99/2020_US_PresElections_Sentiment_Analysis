I'm someone who follows politics closely and I don't know much about Karen Bass. The lack of name recognition combined with this scientology news confirms why she would be a really bad pick for Biden
I agree. At this point, if Biden’s white dude dinosaurs manage to keep her off the ticket and he loses - which he will without her - they’ll have lost any ability to block her 2024 run because they’ll be seen as the reason he lost. This all assumes the US survives until then.
If they both oppose Medicare For All and GND, they’ll both lose a lot of votes. Given that trump will use massive voter suppression, Biden can’t afford to lose votes. #MedicareForAll
Biden - Kiss China’s butt Trump- Kick China’s butt
The last thing POC should do is fall for WHITE propaganda that pits their communities against each other in arbitrary, false choices. The choice is not between a Black or Latino woman, it is between the justice Biden offers and the anarchy tRump promises. Don’t get mixed up.
Postpone the Election? That Could Mean President Biden  If America really doesn’t vote, Trump would be out in January, and he won’t like what happens next  #Biden2020
I guess you really reek of Trump Derangement Syndrome  "OrAnGe MaN bAd" is a baseless way to convince people to vote for Sleepy Joe Biden
I’m voting Biden, even if he picks Michael Moore as VP. I had a hard time thinking of which choice was most repellent. MM is my best shot so far. Yours?
It's grossly unfair to Karen Bass to portray her as "not Kamala," whether it comes from Biden's old guard buddies or the K-Hive. Bass has a great biography, a solid record of leadership, and progressive values. #Election2020 #Biden #Democrats
If Biden chooses a nonentity I will lose all respect for him.
Bizarre. Instead of seeing this as proof that  is capable of leading the country with foresight appropriate preparation, Trump supporters are twisting this into some kind of grand conspiracy that Biden planned the pandemic? Unreal.
Watching Joe Biden. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris ran for president. Joe Biden is elderly. Either of these women could step into the presidency should he become ill. I think he is man enough not to feel threatened. But maybe not.
Biden making the VP decision, is that joke?
Why on earth would biden choose someone named Karen? A gift to opponents projecting negative female stereotypes.
Biden needs to remember who he owes his nomination too. I hope that Representative Clyburn is ready to pull rank on those has-been politicos.
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders #GOJOEBIDEN #RidinWithBiden2020
Joe Biden was vehemently against the Equal Rights Act of 1964. He filibustered against it. Joe Biden is no friend of minorities.  Trump received Jesse Jackson's lifetime achievement award for contributions for the Black community in 1996. Trump is a real friend of minorities.
No matter who ‘wins’ this battle over Biden’s VP, there’s going to be a price to be paid - the question is will it be at the expense of the future of the party- black women - or the past - aging white guys who’s days are already numbered.
Biden, dementia, how can he be up for anything??
Why bother? Polls indicate Biden is way ahead of Trump. Save your money.
Florida teen arrested in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
This won’t surprise you, but it’s ominous that there is further confirmation of what we suspected.
It’s the only chance you’d have to compete Joe, mail in ballots (fraud) I honestly don’t ever see a Biden sticker, shirt, or parade.  signs and patriots are out in clusters in So. Cal. The #Democrats lost their platform by selling too much fear &amp; anger.
I am not believing these reports about Biden VP nomination. The waters are very muddy right now. All , I have to say is don't screw this up. Don't let others change your mind on a good thing.
What side? Currently in 2020, that would be either a Democrat or a Republican. The Democratic Party or the GOP. Biden or Trump... How educated should the ‘United States of America’ president be? Our nation’s President?
Even if you elect a man that was for segregation
But when that mentality is used here in the states, it’s racist xenophobia (circa joe Biden) god I love American politics
The Lincoln Project are Never-Trumpers and Democrats who present themselves as Republicans but are working to get Joe Biden elected.
Goddamn they make Joe Biden sound awesome
In 2020 double speak from Leftists and Democrats is the norm and not the exception.  The "Lincoln Project" - wants to "assassinate" the Republican Party and elect Joe Biden while pretending to be Republicans.  Say no to the John Wilkes Booth Bozos!
Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden

not liberals shaming angela davis for being too radical w prison abolition and then only praising her when she said vote for biden yall r so fucking irritating lmao u only use parts of what she says to ur advantage liberals stop breathing challenge
Grateful for that! Biden 2020!
Elect Joe Biden and Biden puts Obama on the Supreme Court !🙏🏼🇺🇸
Yeah we don't want no mediocre political hack like Biden. He's got dementia. 😎
Theory: the US is on a downward spiral nearing the point of return and I think Trump is starting to realize this. He’ll lose the election just to blame Biden for the inevitable slide towards total collapse that would have happened even if he was president.
Michelle Obama as Joe Biden’s VP would absolutely rock the United States right now. You don’t think it will happen? Hang tight. She just launched a podcast for goodness sake. Why do you think Biden’s team isn’t worried?
Since the election is rigged, no need for Trump supporters to vote, Biden is going to win anyway.
This was a tweet from Biden back in October 2019!!
I think they're running out of the good clones/body doubles  Everyone is looking weird and not at all like themselves. Hillary, Kamala, Biden, and Obama all look completely different.    Who else closely examines every public official they see now?
Did Joe blow Biden say he wasn't black either? A Great Man has left the field of play.
You’re not concerned about the 3 votes that didn’t make it. You’re concerned about the 97 that did because it’s likely that most of those will be for Biden.
Well Donald Trump is killing Americans, Russia is taking full advantage. I’m hoping the patriotic American voter does everything in their power to oppose this oppressive style government and vote for someone like Joe Biden. America first not Trump/Russia first
Excellent interview with Chris. I love what you suggested as Biden first act as president. We need safe and equal voting rights for all US citizens.
That video is the best ad for voting Biden.
I knew Dems were going to turn John Lewis' funeral into a rally.  But was Biden there?
When your face was stretched, you lost a few more of your limited amount of brain cells.  * Joe Biden is a preposterous candidate - even for the preposterous Democrat party.
Plus she can kick ass in a debate better than Pense, trump or Biden.
Remember he’s a Republican they do not endorse Democrats. I’m sure he’ll vote for Biden. 💙

He’s got that idea well and truly lodged in the howling void that is his head. The screens of chaos and fire 🔥 at Kayleigh’s alarmist briefing, the ads claiming “Biden’s” America would look like scenes from Portland— luckily, video tells the real story.
#WeWillVote of course, the easiest way is not to delay the election, should cancel it and declare Biden the winner. Easy peasy.
podcast has more listeners than you because he is not a garbage person. You say you support women do you support Tara Reade or all the other women that Joe Biden touched inappropriately. No you don’t because it doesn’t fit with your narrative.
Worse... Biden is a Deep State NWO Marxist puppet.
Their not to many people think highly of democrat choice for Biden as president cause his absent mind.
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, other issues

And yet the president was accuse of the Russian help him to be in office and look who the worste of them all the left they the cause of all the Chaos and peace protests which is riots and those protesters all end up voting for Biden and also intimidating the voters.
The both of you are superficial- look below the surface. Trump downplayed the pandemic from the get go, costing 50million jobs, 150k deaths and trillions in debt. LOOK AT THE ASIAN COUNTRIES BACK TO NORMAL. Biden is the least of two evils
First thing Joe Biden should do is remove that wall starting at noon on Inauguration Day!

Hillary carried a quarter century of being demonized with her. Biden doesn't carry that baggage.
Agreed... They are sabotaging Biden by going after Kamala. Cut it out!
Either Biden wants Kamala Harris and  the leaks are to get his attention to  change his mind. Or he has his mind made up and the leaks are to soften the air if Kamala Harris isn't  picked.  🧐🤔🤔 What do you think?
If anyone thinks the Corona Virus is going to be coraled under trump, I’ve got ocean front property for sale In Arizona to sell you dopes... Biden will reign it it, not the moron trump.
Biden going end up like Hillary in 2016 and all her voters crying.
🤔what do democrats, China, North Korea, Iran, Russia have all in common? They hate and are afraid of President Trump and would like Biden to be President
No, gawd help us, the MF'r now knows the secrets. If we let his orange mug outta sight for one minute, he'd just sell 'em to the highest bidder. Biden's gonna have to change the codes on those damn nukes on day 1.
Exactly... President Biden is going to have to undo all of his tacky design choices when he takes over in January anyway.
Veep leak? Joe Biden prepped talking points about Sen. Kamala Harris
I still trust him then Biden the die - hard full blown democrat.
I've been railing against demented Joe's candidacy since it was announced. It's a confidence scam by Democrats. How can someone that mentally inept be even considered for POTUS. The damage the nation would incur from Biden in the White House is easy to calculate because it's bad.
Ya, because Biden’s gonna take away the ACA, close schools, and lower the minimum wage...🙄
I ran this thru my #MAGA translator:  ...Your [white] housing prices will go up based on the market, and [black] crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!
If Obama sides with Biden. Then FUCKING SIDE WITH BIDEN Y'ALL. Like come on now...we should not need to settle for a racist homophobic bigot cheeto looking ass president.
Who are "Biden's allies" and why would they even do this?
Of course not. There is bipartisan consensus that #China is the US priority. And the measure of success isn't softness versus toughness. It's about effectiveness. It's about shaping our relationship with China in a way that maximizes US interests.
"Even poor kids can be just as bright as white kids" - Joe Biden
Debated with my dad about Trump last night. He's pretty much voting Biden because OrAnGe MaN bad...  Maybe I should frame this 😂
Mr. Biden has no experience stimulating an economy.
The results of the 2020 presidential election will be unacceptable, whomever wins. The only question is whether a Trump or Biden victory will spur the most rioting, destruction, and mayhem.
Biden's aides are making sure he doesn't stop to wait for the escalator to go outside.
Forget it, President Biden. Trump won't do his job because he can't do his job because Putin won't let him.
Why would any body want to loose their country to socialism communist like dummy Biden!.
Trump just gifted Russia by ordering 12,000 American troops to leave Germany.  There are still 25,000 troops stationed in Germany. I sure hope to JC that these 25,000 troops have enough common sense to vote for Biden in the upcoming election.
Tell that to Biden when he takes that sweet sweet Chinese communist cash straight to his basement.
I’m not addressing Biden’s merits. I’m trying to point out that Biden’s chances of winning go up significantly if he’ll start supporting M4A and GND. Ideally, he wants to win more than remain loyal to lobbyists. #MedicareForAll #GND #BidenSupportM4AorLose
Biden won’t be around for that long...I am sure that the Dems will have him deemed incompetent after he is electrd
Biden should put #Iowa in play and buy some ad time there. It was Iowans that helped propel  (and former VP) to the White House in 2008 and 2012.
Fair point, though as you know a Biden administration would continue to press for more burden-sharing and the Asia&gt;Europe narrative is here to stay. So, Europeans might feel relieved but really shouldn't be.
Whether Libertarians in Republican garb win or lose, we're screwed.  Winning, they'll humiliate and continue to injure and punish Americans who oppose them.  Losing, they'll scream foul and muddy up the waters.  If Biden remains in power after all, they'll plot revenge.
Rare pic of Joe Biden
What about the Biden-Sanders unity plan? What about gaps in Sanders' M4A proposal? What about public opinion? What about the legislative process? What about alternative M4A design specifications? What about imperfect electoral outcomes? What about other proven pathways to UHC?

TWITTER has limited me for calling Biden/TRump tweedledum and tweedledee
Almost a month and a half since reports #Putin paid the #Taliban bounties to kill American soldiers in #Afghanistan, and #Trump still has said NOTHING.
We deserve a better choice for President than just Tweedledum and Tweedledee (Trump/Biden). It is like Jeb Bush or George Bush, no choice at all so VOTE for SOMEBODY ELSE!
Yep, this guy appears prepared to deal with Xi, Putin and Kim.    It didn't work stuffing Hillary into a van and it won't work with hiding Biden because he's senile.    They could've picked anyone and went with this.
The illusion of choice - Trump, Biden or Kanye. The people get to experience real American Exceptionalism.
As crime surges on his watch, Trump warns of Biden’s America
I’ll take Sleepy Joe Biden over Dumb Donnie Trump any day!
Because Biden's has a sex abuse allegation against him, I wouldn't be surprised if Trump brings in Tara Reade. 2016 might just play itself out again.
Then persuade Biden to support #MedicareForAll
You had 4 years to do it   #TrumpFailedAmerica
Your reporting seemed slanted towards anti-Trump. Biden &amp; Cuomo criticized steps taken by CDC and Trump. Why leave that out? #Biden was against closing travel from China because he has a “friendly” relationship with China. NY has “the best health care on the planet...”- #Cuomo.
Great!  Dementia Joe has selected Harris the Hooker for VP. Biden's notes suggest Kamala Harris may be his chosen running mate: reports  #FoxNews
Joe Biden’s notes: ‘Do not hold grudges’ against Kamala Harris
What a joke. Biden has been a do nothing ineffective political hack like many of his Democratic comrades  since the beginning of time . He has done nothing and will do nothing. He's got dementia.😎
Gen Z is using TikTok to radicalize me but now I have to vote for Joe Biden what the hell
Americans are idiots. Proof: Biden is the Fucking NOMINEE. Warren isn’t going to get Brownie points for beating Bloomberg. There were 22+ candidates and almost every one of them would’ve made a better President than Biden, but apparently everyone loves the good time grandpa.
Biden vows to fight racial inequality with economic agenda
Okay. Another reason Biden should worry is that the republican voter suppression of 2016 will be eclipsed by trumps no-shame voter suppression.  #DisbarBarr is one of our best bets for reducing voter suppression. #BidenForMedicare4All or lose.
Hope Biden wins by a larger margin that no one can manipulate. The Dems are so 'by the book' that they will not fight, but they will bark with a loud tone that they disagree with cheating before going along with it. I wish they would play by the GOP playbook if they have to.
Here we go again! They think because Biden is 15 points ahead in the polls they can pick the big insurance companies money over the people. Somebody remind them about Mike Dukakis being 15 points ahead of George H. W. and then Willie Horton came along and the rest is history!!
Cool to hear my classmate Dr. Shauna Ryder-Diggs⁩ today on NPR commenting on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as possible VP candidate.  Go Blue! ⁦⁦ ⁦
Joe Biden also said today that he was somewhere that he wasn't, again.
Some encouraging news about #coronavirus #virulence. But not good news for #Biden &amp; #Dems. They were hoping America will be on #lockdown until election time! Coronavirus Mutating to Become Less Vicious and...  Coronavirus Mutating to Become Less Vicious....
Yes, Nancy it would be smart to hope that Biden takes the oath of office in January. The alternative is distruction of all the good things you take for granted...
Biden will end up like Hillary big lost.

Trump campaign preempts Biden speech, attacking former VP's 'racial history'
Have you looked at Biden's accomplishments as a senator and as a former VP? He may not be perfect but he certainly is NOT "weak"! Do your research!
You don't think Biden meets your rigid qualifications, so, you're going to sit out this election?  Didn't that happen in 2016? We all saw how well that worked out!
In your twitter bio: "National policy chair for Bernie?"  You did us proud today. A ray of hope for a better tomorrow...however, don't you think it's time to back Biden to help defeat Trump?

Joe Biden-President.  Democrats will control the House and Senate in 2020?  Think about it!
Face it Andy, Trump would do something awful if he tried to “pay his respects” to John Lewis. Trump isn’t capable of such human emotion.    It’s better to see how a real leader like Joe Biden does it.
Joe Biden-President.  Democrats will control the House and Senate in 2020?  Think about it!
Here we go again....
Desperation knows no bounds
The same may also be true for a 1990 Trump. Granted, we all knew he was a c***t during the late 80s, but he could still speak in coherent sentences (like Biden did back then)
I lost my spleen several yrs ago and have a treatable but incurable form of cancer. I’ll be masked and gloved and won’t take any vaccine until the Biden administration assures me it’s effective and snake-oil free.

Thank You ...Joe Biden President 2020.  Democrats will control the House and Senate in 2020?  Think about it! You mark my words💙💙💙
I'm OK with any of them but think Kamala is better for AG  Biden doesn't need Kamala to win CA  He needs a VP that can help bring a swing state like Val Demings of Florida ... she's also African American (increases turnout nationwide) &amp; a former Police Officer (as is her husband)
That’s a shame.  Democrats will control the House and Senate in 2020? Think about it! Joe Biden - President
#Biden cites 'duty to care for the entire country' in unveiling plan to reduce racial disparities. #VoteTrumpOut #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Two things are critical for this election: Biden as president, and flipping the Senate to eliminate McConell’s control of legislation. Everything else is of lesser consequence.
Opinion | More voters are now saying they expect Joe Biden to win - The Washington Post
That’s too weak. Hillarys 2016 turnout was low and so might Biden’s turnout be low. He is losing votes for his status quo stance. To win, he has to inspire the non political to vote for him. #MedicareForAll #BlackLivesMatter #GND #DefundThePolice
Because that is for your next president will be if Biden is elected
All of them have been working their butts off  for Biden.
Waiting patiently for trump's rage tweets after bar's testimony and Biden's speech. I predict he will mention how Biden said Tallahassee instead of Jacksonville. He was thinking of Florida's capitol. Sure trump doesn't know what the capitol of Florida is.

I didn’t think that, but I was hoping Biden would be pushed to embrace something closer to Buttigieg, Castro, or Beto’s proposal. I don’t care what’s in the platform but Biden’s health plan sucks and it’s especially bad for an opening offer.
Biden aiming at his foot, finger on trigger...
Lying about the virus leaves my 92 yo strokes impaired husband alone, without his family, without the touch and comfort of his wife. This is inhumane. This did not need to happen. This is what happens when the leader lies more than 20,000 times. Vote the only sane choice, Biden.
Actually Barr's statement was so much of an outrageous lie that I think it makes more nurses, doctors, respiratory techs, etc. want to end this nightmare and vote solidly for Biden.
Ouch!!🤣😝🤣
Ah yes, Joe Biden version 2.4 An older model, for sure
Joe Biden to unveil racial economic equity plan that calls for investment in minority businesses, workers
We can’t pick issues we like from an assortment of candidates. A vote for anyone other than Joe Biden is a vote for #TraitorTrump.  You won’t get a Christmas miracle in November. Biden and #LoserTrump are the only viable options. It’s simple math.
Your vote for Biden won’t help him win. Biden will lose unless he supports Medicare for all, so if beating trump is our goal, then persuading Biden go support Jayapal’s MFA is imperative. #MedicareForAll #NinaTurner #GND
What are you basing this accusation on? Kamala Harris is one of many strong contenders for that seat. Just because she’s not the shoe in you think she should be doesn’t give you the right to put that negativity out there against Biden. You’re wrong for this Sunny!
America will be destroyed if Biden becomes President!  #Trump/Pence2020
Being told every f'n day to vote for Biden &amp; that not doing that is a vote for Trump reminds me of what #MalcomX said about sticking a knife 9 inches in my back, pulling it out 6 inches &amp; calling that progress.
Mahalo! My new take: I will vote for Biden, but he’ll still lose. He loses many votes for opposing MFA, so, beating trump means demanding that Biden learn that his public option won’t work. Either Biden supports Jayapal’s MFA, or trump wins. I’m not attacking, I’m begging: #M4A
I suspect that, when no one is watching, Joe Biden would return the shopping cart to the cart corral.
Watching the recording of the Sunrise Movement internal communications one of your cult members claimed to have sexually assaulted by Biden - but that it was a Good Thing according to her because that could be used as leverage.  You people should never be allowed near kids!
Yeah...  seems apt.  The truth is, when AAT, or Trumpers, get start talking about Biden’s cognitive abilities, they give themselves away.  It’s ridiculous.
So the Sunrise Movement was created to exploit kids and young adults with cult like methods, sell socialism, and push money to the Bernie Sanders Campaign.  Sanders couldn't get the job done - so now you have to convince the Sunrise Movemebt to get excited about Biden.
Biden almost has to select a Black women. While I’m okay with that, I’d really like to see him select Sen Tammy Duckworth.  Keep Kamala Harris for SC.
And now? She's  doing what she does best 🤣🤣😆😆😝😝
New York? As in the State? Turning red? You must be high. The last poll of New York had Biden in the lead by a margin of 25 points. So...
Biden should refuse to debate Trump unless it is fact checked in real-time no need to give him a platform to disseminate his lies.
Any would be great  I like Kamal Harris but think she could be better as AG and Biden doesn't need her to win California  Susan Rice would be great but Abrams or Demings could swing GA or FL Blue which would put Biden over the top  VPs are normally selected to bring a swing state
Yet another reason to re-elect President Trump, how badly would Twitter and Facebook be sterlized under Biden?
All the Republicans in my family are voting for Joe Biden
Shame, shame, shame.  Trump says he won’t go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol
#LittleGirl #KamalaHarris would do anything, including kissing #Biden's behind, to be #VP. There are no limits to her ambition! Opinion | Kamala Harris’s lack of ‘remorse’ should make her an even stronger candidate for VP
Joe Biden is a liar and a puppet.
We had a record-setting economy inherited from the Obama administration that was destroyed by Trump's inept pandemic response and has resulted in 30+million Americans unemployed and over 150k Americans dead.   But our economy will make a comeback with Pres.Biden!🇺🇸 #VoteBlue2020

I had a Joe Biden joke, but I can’t remember
I'm sure the Biden team is going to say the debates are too dangerous and try to skip them.
And don’t vote for people like Joe Biden who support abortion policies.
Biden is an accomplished lier, assisted by a codependent media which will never call him out on anything, regardless of how outrageous.
Shame on these CEOs for supporting a monster to keep a little extra profits in their pockets while our nation is suffering and failing. Vote Trump out!
Not should she have. Biden is no sacred cow. POLITICO: 'She had no remorse': Why Kamala Harris isn't a lock for VP.   via

Biden doesn't have to ... trump is doing a fine job of defeating himself 😂🤣😆  #TrumpFailedAmerica
The Real Reason Biden Is Ahead of Trump? He’s a Man
Biden is a good Catholic who takes the 1st Amendment seriously. We have a POTUS who doesn't respect the Constitution, and look where that's led us?
Biden? Eeewwwww. Who is he the placeholder for?
I want whoever Joe Biden selects. As I’ve stated before I don’t recall any of this happening when President Obama selected Joe Biden.
"Think of tariffs as what happens nine months after an ardent xenophobe and a failing businessman get hitched."
And all the bull shit about Biden look like he is in his right mind HIS NOT.
Quick to speak, Biden can end up like Hillary 2016 and Pelosi was crying with Hillary.
STOP RIGHT NOW! You won’t be there long enough to see it. Let Jill Biden work on it if she wants.
How about we removed Biden and have them all posted together. That way we can enjoy the fact that the process includes so many that look like us and can speak to our issues. That would be far more powerful.
This kind of hubris got the world into a heap of trouble on November 9, 2016.  Please consider tempering it lest you encourage Biden voters to step off the gas, believing falsely that it's in the bag--unless you want Deja Vu of the worst kind and/or you're working for Trump.
Well i appreciate the poll having both “fake” and “no” 😂🤣 Great way to split the vote.  Its like Trump, Biden....or Kanye? 😬
Biden just has to win in November. There is absolutely no way our country can handle another four years.
President and Biden are two words that should never be combined - like wasabi and peanut butter, or a birthday cake frosted with mustard.  Somethings just don't go together!
Biden you pu$$y
You think Biden’s creepy just wait till you see trump 🥰
That not true Biden will end up like Hillary in 2016 lost to Trump for president.
There's no way Biden will debate Trump.
Bunker boy said he was most likely gonna drop out if his percentages don’t go up and since that interview Biden’s has gone up while trumps hasn’t... idk you tell me 🥰✨
Bunker boy is behind Biden in votes by a landslide 💋🥰✨
But isn’t Biden ahead of trump by a landslide right now in votes? 🤔😍🥰✨
Biden is infinitely less dangerous than a Kanye or a trump. This term it’s about a “lesser of two evils” u want a child racist rapist lunatic who’s staff already deep in pockets or u want a racist rapist out of touch old fuck with a staff who actually maybe gives a fuck
I also don't support Trump. Or Biden. Racists bother me.
So Biden tells his VP candidates that they need to be ready to be president on Day 1.  Where's Biden going if elected?
Trump has lost all decency and is now trying to win voters with scare tactics? How much worse could it possibly get with Biden as President? As a country we are on a downward spiral unlike anything we could have imagined. Vote Blue!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  #GoJoe2020

You shall know them by their fruits. Joe Biden and the Democrats are the party of anarchy and destruction.
Biden misspoke ‘120 million’  instead of ‘120 thousand’. If you want to start comparing the things Trump has said compared to Biden’s long record, your candidate would lose. Remember they are both old men in their 70’s. We’re both younger; I’m sure we both have “senior moments”.
Chinese-Americans, Japanese-Americans, Korean-Americans have been ridiculed, abused &amp; beaten because Trump has repeatedly called the coronavirus the Chinese flu. Biden is not talking about holding China accountable here; he’s talking about how Asian-Americans taking the blame!
Either one as VP, doesn’t matter much. What I’m more interested in is whether or not being Biden’s VP will be an asset or a poison pill for them in 2024. There’s gonna be some major backlash when Biden inevitably falls on his ass. Being his VP might destroy their own potus run
Hold yourself breath Biden going end up like Hillary on the lose d side.👎
Still Biden going end up like Hillary
BIDEN GOING END UP LIKE HILLARY IN 2020 will he conceded!...
What’s scary is Trump and Biden is all we have because qualified people weren’t supported by their parties.
This is the America #tRump envisions. He says fear #Biden fear losing your suburbs. This is #tRumpsAmerica  This is what's coming to your suburbs with #tRump.

Hey, Joe, That Letter from Field Organizers in Florida Could Show a Very Serious Problem For You 100 Days Out
Trump wants to kill us indiscriminately. He needs to be controlled, Republican pink/white guys seem to be missing, except for pink/white male democrats, including Joe Biden. Women and people of color can end this Presidency. Let’s encourage and support each other.
Could we send sailboat postcards to Joe Biden to show our support? Are we allowed to boat by mail?
It could also be aliens who've shape-shifted into humans and are now fighting on the side of all that is good (Joe Biden), and will win the war against evil powers. All they need is help from intrepid taggers, looters, and elk statue killers.
Karine -suggestion: for the next 100 days-10 minute virtual nightly Fireside chats by VP Biden would be powerful. Thanks for the consideration.
Any idiot voting for that dementia red puppy would gladly vote for Kanye. After all, they were voting for Biden in the first place LMAO
Antifa don’t care, they even hate Biden and other Democrats.
They are both bad, Biden is the lesser of two evils. Donnie’s list of bad/dumbshit things is miles long
The guy is not qualify for the job but he make all the major players endorse Biden look bad and stupid.
You been living with them for 50 years, that’s how long Biden has been in politics.
Imagine what els they did in office for 8 years even Obama’s secretary of state was corrupt also and everyone els the work under Obama and Biden administration were corrupt.
The media covers both Biden and Trump
Donald Trump is working to get me to elect Joe Biden, so I don't need the news to tell me to do that at all
The most corrupt administration in history is the Donald Trump Administration, that there are fact to prove that, Absolutely no evidence absolutely no evidence that Obama Biden did anything that was not normal
Media will never hold Biden accountable for the viscous lies he tells.
Biden has dementia. Biden will destroy the economy. Your hard earned investments will be destroyed. Biden will tax you to death. Riots and lawlesses will make you and you family unsafe. Trump 2020
Biden has dementia. If elected Biden's leftist, Marxixt ,puppetmasters will tax you like you've never been taxed before.  Streets of America will become rioting  war zones .You and your family will not be safe. Trump 2020
Ridin’ With Biden!!!
Absolutely correct. This so called administration is a DISGRACE. Everyone please get out and vote the fool currently in Washington.  Vote Biden. Let's return some decency and respect to this country
I cannot wait to vote for President Biden. The only sad thing is the damage the current occupant of the White House may do from now to 12 noon on January 20, 2021.
My only hope is Biden's handlers choose Susan Rice and deny the true until November
If you vote for Biden...please know what you are voting for.
He will be. Trump just needs to keep on opening his mouth and President Biden will be there next January.
Lots of people started stealing trump flags, I wonder if the same happens to Biden flags.😂😂😂😂
Lol I bet the conservatives are gonna go around stealing Biden flags now 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I believe she would openly campaign against him. I’m not saying she would promote Biden. But knowing she stood up for things she would say don’t vote Trump.
Can’t believe I’m gonna vote between Biden and trump lol 😭
It’s gonna get bad. Then neutral if Biden wins. Then horrible when he inevitably f*cks up the recovery. And then bat sh*t when Tucker Carlson runs for president in 2024.
I pray once Biden is President, all the Deplorables will crawl back under their rocks. 🙄

In with you I don’t give damn who hangs out with trump as long as it’s not Joe Biden.
Holy cow fox just shows trump America and asks if this is what you want with Biden. It is most literally trump.

Only a Joe Biden sign for live in resident. A secure, guarded facility. Not a Cuomo nursing home, that would be cruel &amp; inhumane.
I’ll admit I kinda favored Bernie but I just chipped in to elect Joe Biden
Lordy
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Jason, I hope you rethink this because the alternative is heading towards socialism. You don’t actually think Joe Biden can make difficult decisions? He made terrible decisions in his 45 years in govt. Tell you what, I will not decide until after the debates, and you do the same.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
President Biden - don't forget us
Can someone please post that Trump-wearing-a-mask-James-Bond-video/Joe Biden mask lame recorder? Cant find it
Would "Get the hell on my lawn" make a good Biden slogan?
I will vote Biden
When all else fails-Blame Obama, Biden, Bush or Clinton.
ANOTHER GREAT REASON TO VOTE FOR TRUMP!!!   Biden Vows to Stamp Out 'Islamicphobia' - Frontpagemag
This alone is good enough reason to vote for him.  To be clear. I hate that Biden is the choice. I will be voting for him nonetheless. Anything besides a vote for Biden is a thumbs-up for Trump. There is NO other way to look at it.
Lol the only interviews Biden is up for involves talking to a friends who is pulling the strings behind his entire campaign haha
If you’re able to look at things prospectively without “Orange Mad Bad” glasses it’s pretty obvious.  Only the severely programmed truly believe Biden even has a slight chance.   What kind of source exists that accurately predicts the outcomes of future elections? 🤣 #Numbnuts
Why isn’t this mother horrified?! They allow Biden to sniff, kiss and touch their children!
Boy are you in for a surprise.   Trump will win the EC by hundreds &amp; the popular vote by millions.   Nominating Biden sealed the DNC’s fate. They way overestimated how many Americans are THAT gullible.
Trump’s ads claim Americans won’t be safe in Biden’s America. But we aren’t safe in TRUMP’S America. Nearly 150K Americans have died due to Trump’s mishandling the pandemic. And his defense of the Confed monuments—and of police brutality itself—leads to violence in the streets.
She's like Biden - not sure why she's there.
Well, ok-- we KNOW Kanye HAS been medically diagnosed bipolar, and yes, Biden has made numerous verbal gaffes over the years, but Trump arguably speaks more poorly than both Kanye &amp; Biden, and exhibits symptoms of several mental disorders, even according to his niece ... 1/2
Blacks people can apparently chose to not be black by not voting for Biden
Absolutely. This election will require a massive Biden vote to oust trump. A third party or non vote is a vote for trump. It’s all numbers this time.
Trump just signed an EO that lowered drug prices.   Like drugs that have proven effective in defeating China virus.   But Biden &amp; dems don’t want anyone healthy.  They want you scared &amp; they want your vote. Full stop.   #4MoreYears 🇺🇸🍊🇺🇸
Have no fear, he probably owns about 15% of Biden through dark money contributions.
The next president, Joe Biden, well make is right for you again. You have the profound honor of sane Americans who are forever grateful to you *for* doing your duty to help us with Individual 1.
Because “real blacks” only vote for Joe Biden.
You tweet 20 or 30 times a day. You’ve already said you think  is crazy so don’t you have anything to say about Biden? That’s how I know you are just FULL OF SHT. Go back to China since you hare people here. FU. You’d have more credibility if you’d analyze Biden
on the Covid_19 but looking at your tweets in March I don’t see any suggestions. As far as employment what complaints do you have for  Did your fkg 🇨🇳government ask you to make those idiot statements. Are you saying Biden is healthier? You’re just plain stupid.
Let me be the 1st to say, IF biden is ever president, this guy is moving from blue state to somewhere.  I've no idea but it may be a place where the propaganda machine isn't relevant.
Thank you for this reminder about Biden’s positions. Remember there are a few  running, please compare them with GOP candidates &amp; pray for wisdom in making your Christ like vote. We should never vote straight Blue or Red, without examining each candidate.
Dear  : slowing or disabling the postal service is a sure way to get Biden elected.
He's finally found a lucrative niche, and it all ends for him if Biden wins. Can't help but wonder if he's now wishing Trump wins so he can continue to milk the cash cow.
An honest campaign ad for Joe:  If you loved George Wallace, If you adored Strom Thurmond, Then you will like Joe Biden.
Tbh no one should be made to feel comfortable voting for Biden. It should feel exactly as bleak as it is. You should be reluctant and you should expect to be frustrated and critical of everything during a potential Biden presidency.
Lady, you came at me wanting to make sure that you set the record straight - you hate Trump's character, but embrace the same character in Biden.  Sit down.
Nominating Biden sealed your fate. Dems are finished.   America’s REAL Worst Mistake:  Two terms of a Kenyan spy
Now do Joe Biden ..  You know, the guy who:  - says he is running against Joe Biden.  - says that he's running for the Senate.  - who said over 100,000,000 Americans have died from COVID-19.  - who hides in his basement except for his scripted interviews with liberal media.  D 🤡
Mitch can’t find Covid relief $, but trump can find $ for 15,000 hired thugs to terrorize America? Tucker’s right, if Biden is elected and we flip the Senate, you won’t recognize our country, it’ll be entirely different.

People think this election is about Biden. It is not. It is about the people behind him. Biden is not capable to do anything but be led.
Not even Biden can get it done.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
This 2 guys and Obama and Hillary could give a shit what happen to this great country but more concern of the out side world, this guys got no Conscience IF people love their country they need to protect her by not voting for Biden or lose your country.
I know! Those Democrats will ignore congressional subpoenas, Biden will pardon co-conspriators, it will be madness!

Cognitive Test. Trump. Biden. Campaign. Flashpoint.
More lies from Donald Trump. He claims Joe Biden wants to “redirect” money from the police. Actually, Biden thinks police departments should receive MORE money, for better training and resourcing. Trump is the biggest liar—and the biggest crook—ever to occupy the White House.
#repost #BREAKING ABC News rates Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as leaning toward Joe Biden, who has an estimated slight edge in the Electoral College over Pres. Donald J. Trump nearly 100 days from Election Day. Read the full analysis-
Democrats have a very deep bench of strong qualified candidates for Joe Biden to choose from.
He does nothing unless it increases his brand awareness or makes him $. Sending camo pseudo-military troops into our cities is to shore up his base. Unfortunately, he’s probably right. I certainly hope the rest of us totally support Biden &amp; actually vote this time!
She’s much more lucid than Biden and she’s probably a few years older.
Trump says Biden will “destroy the American Dream.” No, Biden can’t destroy the American Dream because Trump already has.
Joe Biden been Vice President for 8 years under some circumstances trump could’ve never handled and served with the greatest President’s in our modern history or maybe ever. And what administration or election campaign has Michael Moore ran or failed against please let me know.
I don’t know why Donald trump won’t resign immediately and I don’t care for mike pence either. Joe Biden should be running unopposed for President with all trump alleged crimes, coverup, clear incompetence, obvious racist and unfitness for the office. #EnoughIsEnough #Biden2020
I don’t believe a damn thing Donald Trump says but the news media and journalists need to their job though. Stop asking just about what joe Biden’s saying and doing. Trumps the so-called president, he’s doing the lying, coverup, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
so , if you are a Biden or a Trump supporter, you must be the one holding the crack pipe, ice head

Asshole writes a piece attacking Biden’s stutter and then has the audacity to tweet this?  What a fucking hack.
I am voting for Donald Duck.  He has the same qualifications as Biden, He is NOT Donald Trump.
Biden would confuse the ball for an apple.  Or an earlobe.

Ummm...they've endorsed Joe Biden. Why would you believe they're conservative? Also, I totally agree with you. Never Trump, Never Biden.
I think Joe Biden could use some "Luru Vopo Vir Can Utriet" for his campaign. Cofeve amounts.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
They are "not OK" with non-progressives. Neither as I. We need a REAL progressive to balance Biden's conservatism.
I’d love for that. But there’s a tough scenario that must happen first, and that is Trump will have to beat Biden for a second term. Otherwise we would have to wait two additional terms with Joe wins. Unless Joe picks AOC as his running mate... and there’s a succession plan.
Biden doesn't have to campaign against trump ... all he has to do is sit back and let trump speak to win
Biden is wise to wait  He wants to hold this announcement til after the RNC convention to get the maximum bump right before the election   He also needs to see which state is the key swing state that will push him over the top   His ‘lay-low’ strategy has worked well so far
Fox News poll shows Trump trailing Biden in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania | TheHill #GoJoe for those that trust polls; its a good reason to be cautiously optimistic.
Why do u guys post this shit? Biden could not even get 40 people to login to his virtual conference

I think  would make an amazing press secretary for Joe Biden.  Send in your questions, and he'll answer in song.
I’m thinking about voting and preparing to throw trump out of office beginning after November 3rd election, all the States called for Joe Biden and NLT January 20th 2021.
Words Trump used that prove Biden is smarter than Trump:  “ ... I see the disinfectant ... is there a way we can do something like that? By injection inside . . . ?”  Genius! And very stable, he claims.
#tytlive I think Biden is more conservative than Reagan, Reagan was discount Biden.

Since you are working to get Joe Biden elected - who would arguably be the WORST President ever elected - you should change your name to the the "John Wilkes Booth Society".  You're not working to save America you're trying to load the pistol to assassinate it.
because he is waiting for that Biden phone call???:-) lol!!!
let me guess;  Trump waited days for Biden's phone call??? bwahahahahahaha
Biden is out of touch with the American people
Nope. Trump's in cognitive decline, and while Biden is gaffe-prone, he's not in cognitive decline. He's also already laid out plans for dealing with issues like the coronavirus, while Trump is derping, has no plan to deal with the virus, and lied about a plan being in the works.
You've already destroyed it they'll be nothing left for Biden.
I see NO DIFFERENCE between trump and biden
Biden not even president how tf are they blaming him 😂

Well look like they loosing voters if that the case if she want to ack stupid this lady is like Biden Dementia.
How could it be Joe Biden’s America when it’s happening now, during trumps presidency.

Biden out here stealing my jokes
This is a joke right!? Of course CNN showing where Biden said “no one can tell the difference in Asian” paraphrasing.. or mocking an Indian accent and stereotyping.. the list goes on.
Biden is right,Trump is the most open Racist President in History!
Joe Biden - representing the very best of the 2020 Democrat party.  Bernie Sanders - have you considered the fact that the Democrat party prefers Joe to you?  Do you cringe every time you think about it?  You know, because rational Americans cringe at the thought of you.
Obama and Biden are moderate republicans.  Obama wasn’t bad, per se, he just wasn’t the liberal we had hoped.
Voting for you ...Joe Biden 💎
Obama cant save Babbling Biden. John Kasich has to speak for Babbles at the DNC convention. Who's going to debate Trump?
Babbling Biden cant even speak for himself at the DNC convention. My bet is they won't let Babbles debate either.
They won't even let Babbling Biden speak publicly. John Kasich has to speak for Babbles, pretty sad DNC.
I would be giddy if Biden took a competency test and shared the results.
Joe Biden has reached peak vegetable state 🥬
His next tweet: Look at Biden selling beans in the Oval Office and bragging about his dementia test!
Poor demented soul. Shows how ignorant Biden is. If he can't differentiate between races or misidentify friends from foe, we'll be in trouble if he wins his bid.
Does Biden not think we slant eye can be Americans, too? And Yes, China is accountable for the Kung Flu.
I think the Biden show peaked at about 26 and two of them were from the Laura Ingraham staff.
For eight years #Obama &amp; #Biden did nothing to curb #Chicago violence. And nothing will change in Chicago as long as #Dems control the city! Trump announces he's sending federal agents to Chicago
Sad you dropped out of the US Presidential Elections, you should reconsider; if not, would you conseder running for VP under Joe Biden?  Would be a win-win situation.  Why or why not?
The #TrumpVirus has killed 150,000 Americans to date   By Election Day it will be 225,000 Americans DEAD due to trump’s FAILURE to take #coronavirus seriously &amp; listen to the experts   And 350,000 will be DEAD when Biden takes office on January 20   #DumpTrump
Whoever this Boris person is, is living in an alternate reality. 45’s term has started so much unrest. When Biden becomes 46, there will be parades of happiness. Not tear gassed Mothers.
