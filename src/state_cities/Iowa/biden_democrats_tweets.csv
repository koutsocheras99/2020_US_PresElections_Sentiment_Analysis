Absolutely agree..the 2party system is always a race to the bottom.  We need a transitional period to fix this system because it doesnt deal with a corrupt president.  BBC said it best...Biden is smooth jazz in the background. Trump is heavy medal screaming at you every damn day.
Biden quotes his wife quoting Kierkegaard:  "Faith sees best in the dark"
Everyone pretend you don't see these polls. Pretend Trump is ahead and we have to do literally everything possible to gather votes for Biden. Complacency could be devastating, and we CANNOT do 4 more years of Trump. It has to be a MASSIVE loss to deliver the message to Trumpism.

Biden hit his peak about two weeks ago.  Trump is closing the gap now.
Not big on conspiracies, but the best way for a Harris supporter to force Biden to tap her is: Send reporters to donors/associates who you know have shitty opinions on Harris.  Pushback inevitably falls against Biden himself &amp; can only be redressed by putting Harris on the ticket

Obviously Bush v. Gore happened and could happen again. For that to happen, the election has to be very close *and* it must make a difference in the outcome. It's a rare combination of circumstances, though serious enough for Biden to have a staffer game it out.

It is going to get a lot hotter in the Biden kitchen.
Here is my take and I credit the BBC.  Biden is like smooth jazz playing in the background. Trump is like heavy metal screaming profanities in your ear every day.  That's why Biden get elected because we need a break from all of the chaos and need some quiet.
The guy is a complete train wreck. Seems like he can hardly complete a thought that isn't scripted. He and Biden must have interesting conversations.

I need to remind you that Biden was dead in the water until South Carolina and Bernie won the previous three primaries. It's easy to forget if you're a dead-ender
Absolutely correct. And the fact that Biden does not understand this proves his neoliberal core.  We live in a shitty two party system in which they are really the same shitty party.
It's not sabotage when two top candidates drop out the day before Super Tuesday and immediately endorse Biden after he won one state? Also Bernie was polling way ahead of all of them for months lol. I know it's convenient to ignore facts but you're better than this
This is all wrong. Warren lost support after she backed down from M4A and tried to sabotage Bernie. It takes a big leap in logic to think that Biden won the primary not because of collusion and sabotage but because of his refusal to support something people like.

Still the candidate on whom I'd put my money if I had to gamble on a running mate. She's from a swing state, she has a remarkable biography, and she endorsed Biden instead of running against him.

I believe most Ds would vote for Bernie. However there are a lot of Iowans (especially no-party but also moderate Rs) who would vote for Biden but not for Bernie. If you don't acknowledge this we will have to agree to disagree. Older voters are comfortable with Biden.
Nearly three in four Iowans who voted in 2020 primary (73.6%) were at least 50 years old. Just 13% were under age 35. That in a nutshell is why many Democrats are relieved that Joe Biden is the nominee, rather than Bernie Sanders.

Completely unhinged. I‚Äôm feeling more and more shocked that he could actually identify the elephant (the SYMBOL for Trumpublicans!) Thank you    #NobodyLikesMe #NobodyLikesTrump #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpMeltdown #LyingTrump   Go #Biden #Blue #Biden2020
Kara Eastman will lose but Joe Biden will win. If she was a good candidate she would win.
Biden gave an interview in June where he said he thinks the military would escort Trump from the WH. I am skeptical; every right winger everywhere will scream bloody murder about a coup, and the military knows it.
Wait...so what time is his golf game, play date, and afternoon nap?   #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpleThinSkin #TrumpMeltdown #Trump   Go #Biden! #Biden2020 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
He can keep trying to buy my love, I will keep cashing his checks and still vote for Biden this coming election.
He is talking about the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù so when Russian hackers (already inside numerous swing state voting systems) change the outcome of what should be an overwhelming win for Joe Biden, people will actually believe there was a huge silent faction for Trump. See
Joe Biden is expected to accept the party‚Äôs presidential nomination on the final night of the convention, which runs Aug. 17-20.
Any day is a good day to cam for Trump‚Äôs resignation!Too bad there is not teeth to these days.Waiting for the election and then swearing in of Joe Biden is too long especially given Trump‚Äôs fickleness.
Just sent that tweet to someone. Their response, ‚Äúyeah well, Biden is no better so, it‚Äôs a non issue.‚Äù  Where do they come up with this s***?
Good God lady, Putin?  Where have u been?  Comey‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Higher Loyalty‚Äù is on hardcover for $5 on Amazon if your copy is all worn out already.  You‚Äôve really been mentally buggered over the last three years. You think Biden will be the Comm in Chief?  That is plumb nuts!
Pffft.  Maybe before all of the violence.  The McCloskey‚Äôs are big time Democrat‚Äôs.  Suburban rich ones.  You think they are voting Biden now?  Gun sales are astronomical and that‚Äôs not all conservatives by any means.  Shit has changed big time in the last 2 months.  Catch up.
Frankly, most people don't understand what Communism is.  They just associated the term with bad and call it a day without attempting to understand what it is.  The idea that Biden is some kind of communist sympathizer is pretty laughable given his past record.
Trump just lost the only consistent polling advantage he had over Biden: analyst  #SmartNews
If Biden wins, there won‚Äôt be a Republican House.
He would need some support from the military for a coup. He‚Äôs not going to get that, especially not against Biden.
Whahhhhhh! Cry why don‚Äôt you? Reality sucks when you‚Äôre a Basement Joe Biden supporter.
As stupid as you sound It‚Äôs still only one vote. But I guess you‚Äôre afraid that the 14 year old knows his parents love Trump so much that they have to High jack their vote because they‚Äôve been brainwashed by the Dems to cheat and help Biden win.
Sexism aside, Biden‚Äôs already said he intends to only serve one term. Shouldn‚Äôt they actively seek someone who wants to become POTUS so there‚Äôs a sense of continuity?
Need a reason to vote for Biden? How about: Joe Biden is an excellent judge of character.
Okay Dictator Donald! Smh! Biden already told us he would try to delay the election. Mail in voting and absentee are the same thing. He‚Äôs only saying this because it may produce the result he doesn‚Äôt like. Narcissists hate the possibility of losing! Only Congress can change dates
Biden cannot talk straight
More surrogate lies: Women are primary T donors, via Jr's mistress being paid a ton of bucks for her campaign work. Any proof? She's apparently not too good at her job since Ds are outraising Rs. Any proof that Biden will crush women for whom he has quite a good record?
My hope is that the GOP grows a set of balls after the election, and Congress has him removed.  Biden must crush him.
100% correct. Biden doesn‚Äôt know what city he‚Äôs in and can‚Äôt Complete a sentence. Harris is just a blowhard, literally and figuratively.
I live is a nice basic neighborhood, no golf course, but low income housing two blocks away, providing housing for at least a few people with physical disabilities and many elderly adults. My suburb is diverse and I am voting for Biden. #SuburbsForBiden
Based on my (very limited) survey of rural political sentiment (campaign signs on farm property between here and Grand Island), Biden needs to step up his farm game.  Turns out, two suburban neighbors are Trump's, too (that I know of).  It's depressing, honestly.
No to Kamala Harris. She let innocent people rot in jail and did unethical prosecutions. She will be a disaster as VP especially since she'll run for President if she is elected Vice President with Biden on day 1. Susan Rice would be a much better VP.
A Biden Tulsi card might be the only way we can get trump out of office.
I‚Äôve havent seen a Biden sign since Obama‚Äôs name was above it .. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I mean, we all kind of thought Biden wasn't the candidate for the moment last year and the moment didn't agree. So... whatever. I'm actually higher on Harris than others are, but I get your concerns. There's little electoral consequence for 2020 but potentially large beyond that.
My hope is that she's still going to be very involved in the appointment process, particularly for Cabinet-level offices that are going to require Senate approval. I'd love her to be VP, but I just can't see Biden making that choice.
I think it's going to be Harris because I believe Biden's going to pick someone with a similar style to him and Warren would be too much of a clash. But I don't know that, because I know nothing.
Absolutely! Somehow I hadn‚Äôt even thought about that. Thanks  !   #NobodyLikesMe #NobodyLikesTrump  #TrumpMeltdown   Go #Biden #Biden2020

Are they ... are they expecting Biden to run for a second term? He's 78 years old! In January 2025, he'll be 84!  I do not want an 84-year-old white dude to be president. Hell, I don't even want a 78-year-old white dude to be president, but, you know, extenuating circumstances.
Trump makes things SO easy for everyone. He hands us his unhinged word salad of insanity EVERY time he speaks or tweets. He makes himself look horrible, because he IS horrible! It‚Äôs his own words, in context.  #TrumpMeltdown #COVID19 #NobodyLikesTrump  GO #Biden #Biden2020

They want you to have to take their vaccine. And in the meantime, they want you to blame Trump for why the ‚Äúnumbers‚Äù here are so bad. So you‚Äôll vote for Biden - using only a mail in ballot.
This is ridiculous.  Joe Biden was a competent, wise, but humble VP - and he of all people would know what is needed &amp; what he wants in a VP.  We just need to trust in his choice and support him.  I think this is fake news, and I hate that phrase.

ALL VICE PRESIDENTS WANT TO BE PRESIDENT. JOE BIDEN IS A GODDAMN VICE PRESIDENT THAT WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT. Are we seriously going to do this again? How many fucking times, America?
I hear you but typically VP running mates are chosen because their personalities lend themselves to taking a backseat. Biden. Pence. Al Gore. That guy Hillary chose that nobody remembers. Most candidates choose someone who doesn't repeatedly make headlines. Harris does.
The last iteration of this did not work for reasons obvious to anyone with a pulse. The problem with dementia is that you do not understand. This is not a comment on Biden‚Äôs other policies.

Biden is the left, as it stands.
Nobody wants a VP who puts becoming president 1 day ahead of having ur back. The job is about loyalty &amp; being subservient to the president. &amp; she trashed Biden viciously during the debates. If a male candidate had trashed Biden like that he shouldn't choose the man either.
It was that or this and I‚Äôd already used that one on another one of his ‚ÄúBiden is a vote for rock‚Äù posts.  He can have an opinion but we got enough vote shaming celebrities shill for Trump and Biden like they are actually the same and neither would piss on us to put out a fire

If Biden is smart he'll listen to this article &amp; his top donors and not pick Kamala Harris as his running mate. Everything here is spot on.

Here is my take and I credit the BBC.  Biden is like smooth jazz playing in the background. Trump is like heavy metal screaming profanities in your ear every day.  That's why Biden get elected because we need a break from all of the chaos and need some quiet.
The guy is a complete train wreck. Seems like he can hardly complete a thought that isn't scripted. He and Biden must have interesting conversations.
We don‚Äôt care shut up we are voting for Biden
The notes on Harris, who is a vice presidential contender, may be in response to a seminal moment in the first presidential primary debate last year.
Best line tonight from  ‚ÄúI trust Joe Biden to work on behalf of all Americans.‚Äù  Plus, ‚ÄúI look forward to being able to exhale one we have President Biden.‚Äù  Agree my friend.
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden says he will choose his running mate the first week of August. But he was coy about meeting meet in person with potential candidates because of the challenge of dodging reporters outside his home.
Biden's notes: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Kamala Harris
Day before election:  "Joe Biden Actually an Alien the Entire Time."   Morning of election:  "Trump Actually Time Traveler (with Dementia)."
Mediocre equals standing up 4 what is right?  Who raised children when spouse died?  Or....a man who isn‚Äôt religious, says he is; says he cares about the working man, doesn‚Äôt; a man who imprisoned children fr parents. Biden is a solid, his side-kick will be the strongest VP ever.
You mean Biden right?
(3/3) According to Genderbot, Trump is more gender fluid than Biden by 2%.
A Biden rally.....
I need to remind you that Biden was dead in the water until South Carolina and Bernie won the previous three primaries. It's easy to forget if you're a dead-ender
Absolutely correct. And the fact that Biden does not understand this proves his neoliberal core.  We live in a shitty two party system in which they are really the same shitty party.
It's not sabotage when two top candidates drop out the day before Super Tuesday and immediately endorse Biden after he won one state? Also Bernie was polling way ahead of all of them for months lol. I know it's convenient to ignore facts but you're better than this
This is all wrong. Warren lost support after she backed down from M4A and tried to sabotage Bernie. It takes a big leap in logic to think that Biden won the primary not because of collusion and sabotage but because of his refusal to support something people like.
Bad analysis! Biden pulling right will cost him

I have my preferences, but I trust Joe and his team to make a solid choice.
There's also 2000.  That being said, it's prudent for Biden to have folks working on such scenarios but the main concern for most folksbis to get the vote out so we don't have to worry about it. Eyes on the prize.

Hey sis Bernie lost and endorsed Biden. So what you like us to do? And in the big picture does it make any difference when you think now.
This idea that Biden is ‚Äúbeating‚Äù Trump because some polls say so in July is crazy. 2016 redux. Polls don‚Äôt account for voter suppression, extremely rural voters, or media comeback narratives, to say nothing of foreign interference. Polls = false confidence. #Election2020
Still the candidate on whom I'd put my money if I had to gamble on a running mate. She's from a swing state, she has a remarkable biography, and she endorsed Biden instead of running against him.
He knows that's a lie. Pompeo and Trump gave away TONS of PPE from the Obama/Biden stockpile and bragged about it on the State Dept website. February 2020, if they haven't hidden it by now.

If it's a contest between Biden and Trump, nothing will dissuade me from voting for Biden. I'm tired of being pissed off each and every day for the past three and a half years. I'm tired of lies and corruption.

Yang endorsed Biden when he was the presumptive nominee.
I don't understand how you can call yourself a conservative and yet you think Trump should be voted out, when Trump is the most conservative president we've had in decades. There will be NOTHING conservative about a Biden presidency.

My husband is ashamed he voted for Trump, I asked him if he was just not going to vote, his response, "Oh yes I'm voting, for Biden" we live in Iowa
I don't need to win a debate with you. If you want to express your privilege and sense of superiority by withholding your vote from Biden, it's a free country. The fact that you dismiss the importance of SCOTUS shows you are not very discerning.
Whose ideological purity? Biden's far from my ideal candidate. I generally agree with Bernie's policies and would have supported him if he had any chance in hell of winning 270 electoral votes in any of our lifetimes.
Congratulations on being more of a pure leftist than Angela Davis.  Also enjoy feeling superior while you never have to worry about losing your reproductive rights.
Biden wasn't my first, second, or third choice in the Democratic field. We all know he's not on the progressive wing of the party. Right now the choice whether you want Biden or Trump to appoint RBG's successor on SCOTUS.
I will back Biden if he pledges M4A
I believe most Ds would vote for Bernie. However there are a lot of Iowans (especially no-party but also moderate Rs) who would vote for Biden but not for Bernie. If you don't acknowledge this we will have to agree to disagree. Older voters are comfortable with Biden.
Nearly three in four Iowans who voted in 2020 primary (73.6%) were at least 50 years old. Just 13% were under age 35. That in a nutshell is why many Democrats are relieved that Joe Biden is the nominee, rather than Bernie Sanders.

Biden just wants everyone to vote for him. Hell Obuma didnt even endorse Biden until it was just him. Oh yeah, Obuma was a traitor to the United States.
And then, they get to blame Biden for the disastrous mess it's leaving. (cf Bush's stock market collapse somehow becoming Obama's "lagging economy.")

Interesting idea.  Unfortunately, it would require Trump, McConnell, Biden, Nancy, &amp; Chuck to all stand side by side and agree to bipartisan support of this idea.  They would need to lead in the ‚Äúcoming together‚Äù for this to work.  Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt see that happening.

Joe Biden rallies Iowa Democrats 100 days out from general election - The Daily Iowan
"It's clear who takes #Iowa seriously. President  campaign has had a presence in-state since 2016 while Joe Biden parachutes in 100 days out merely to make a scripted, pre-recorded speech that lasted only three minutes to the Democratic donor class." #MAGA
Lol, is this your Warren plug? 8 years difference and the same age as Biden.  Personally, I was really hopeful that Warren wouldn't do something stupid like try to take Bernie out at the knees as a last minute bid to save herself.  Or that Booker would've caught more traction.
"We need leadership that recognizes the real threat of this pandemic and doesn't just wave a white flag of surrender, like the president is,"  said in virtual remarks to Iowa Democrats Sunday.

Now you're making assumptions. I'm not BLM and theyre stupid as fuck for going out like that with no mask. Stop trying to make it political. Why is everybody doing that? I hope Trump wins this election tbh because I hate Biden. Stay on topic if you're going to argue masks with me
My apologies I thought you meant we move to the right when we elected Trump. My point still stands though. Trump? Biden? It's the same guy with a different label.

It's like, you are campaigning for Biden.  Do you know something? Say something.
The news?? Since when is it the role of the news to present the detailed position statements and actual ideas of political candidates? Or is that just your admission that Biden needs that much help and support because he isn‚Äôt capable of handling it on his own?
Just being diplomatic. Maybe he could say "I'm glad that former President Trump is still here to help with the transition to the Biden presidency."
Why remove him from the premises? The Constitution doesn't even mention the White House.   Biden can just take the oath and set up shop with Trump still in there. He can call Trump an honored guest.  #thebeat
He WILL announce Harris. The Biden-Harris ticket has been what the DNC has wanted since he announced. It‚Äôs a given. But the problem remains that Joe is still top of the ticket. A wide field of very capable candidates and the absolute weakest is the default nominee. üôÑ
And Biden would already be in a nursing home.

Having thought things over, I've decided to support Joe Biden for president.  His values are the most in line with mine of any candidate that can beat Donald Trump and end the madness that currently is spreading throughout the country. #BlueWave
Are you going to vote for Biden or are you going to fuck over every single disabled American like me?  I say this as a person who fully supports Bernie Sanders. Unless we get Biden, the pandemic is going to end up killing millions of Americans.  Biden is better than Trump.
Join us in pledging to vote for Joe Biden in November, because it‚Äôs not just who becomes president that‚Äôs on the line, it‚Äôs the whole administration. I don‚Äôt know about you all, but I cannot handle another four years of Trump‚Äôs America.
"Joe Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0, the nation‚Äôs second domestic debacle in two generations." Nice qualifier,  that omits the international debacle of the GW Bush presidency &amp; the needless loss of 1000s of Americans &amp; Iraqis.
Lrt i dislike biden in most ways and he is barely better than trump in a lot of them but the environmental plan is whats making me feel less gross about voting for him.
thank you  ! you speak for many, if not most, of us.  we are not delicate flowers nor porcelain dolls. we've never had equal pay and biden did nothing about it with all of his turns at bat, since 1973. i'm more than satisfied with our president, he's a DO-er, TYVM.
Trump cowers to Putin.
i didn't know this woman worked in the obama-biden administration.  i thought she was a reporter.  or is she?
Taking a page out of Trump‚Äôs book. #GrifterInChief
i just heard some disturbing stats. over 30% of the people who may vote for biden are doing so because they are voting AGAINST trump and not FOR biden.  for those voters, i encourage you to stand up and write in your candidate of choice come election day!
I'd have mocked this as being the Republican talking point, but even they favor M4A now.  It's been disproven time and again, but talking to Biden voters is the most useless activity ever, so I'll just mock your ignorance.
"You're right. Biden doesn't support the GND, but it's close enough for me. It's worse, but it's what we have, so I'm on board."  Then it's over. But no. Lies and pride and being a douche beats admitting error to some people.  Really sad.
Here's some truth for ya: you don't know my position on anything except whether Biden supports the GND (he doesn't). The rest is just you jumping in defending a liar because you think not supporting Biden is wrong.  But he's lying and you don't care. That's a fact.
What are you talking about? I'm sabotaging policy because moron is lying about Biden supporting the GND? Talk about an echo chamber. What are you even smoking?
Lie: Biden supports the GND.  Truth: Biden incorporated things from the GND, but every change is worse, but that's good enough for some people and those people will lie about the differences and jump into discussions and be condescending jerks when shown to be wrong.
Tell me, do you think what Biden is supporting is exactly the same as the GND?
No, it's like claiming you're driving a Ferrari when you're driving a Ford.  Lies are lies.  This guy is lying.  So your analogy is stupid.  You can claim that Biden is helping or whatever, but to claim he supports the GND is a lie. Simple as that.
Number of times Biden has said he supports the Green New Deal: 0  This guy even admitted they aren't the same, but since it's Biden, it's the NEW Green New Deal, therefore, he's not lying.  It's just crazy.
My other source that it's not the Green New Deal:
Yeah, she compromised for something less than the Green New Deal. Duh.  I mean, it's such a stupid argument. Biden supports his own agenda and even though it's not the same as the GND, you call it that because... YOU'RE A LIAR.
Says the person that claims the only GND is Biden's!  ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
This is how Biden supporters sleep at night. What mental gymnastics it must take. Truly pathetic.
Lol what?  Your own source says that Biden isn't doing the GND! Your response was, "yeah well the GND as written is dead." And not resurrected by Biden! He does NOT support the GND! You couldn't refute the first point, so you deflected.  So sad. Just admit you're wrong when wrong
Lol  The "nuh uh" follow up.  All you've got is insults and lies. I've proven you wrong on GND already. Wanna go through the whole list of your lies?  Just be honest. Biden is a Reagan conservative and that's fine with you. Why spin it? Just be honest for once.
Oh no! What happened?! Last I heard, I think you said you were voting for Biden? üòúüôÉ
Biden supporter caught learning something...  Biden doesn't support the GND and helped kill it. The exact opposite of the original post.  Retraction? Of course not.  The lies and propaganda from these people is just so... well, typical, honestly.  Typical conservative...
The Democratic Party on Biden right here!  Stoopid M4A people wanting Americans to have basic human rights while Biden specifically denies them...  Your propaganda is so weak. Even you don't believe it.
Oh good! Someone else to educate!  So you do know that Biden simultaneously believes that health care is a human right and doesn't have a universal plan, right?  He literally admits that he's planning to deny human rights to citizens...
Ok, so you concede that you're lying that Biden supports the GND. Progress!
You forgot to put quotes around ‚ÄòBiden‚Äô
When did the GND legislate net zero emissions?  If Biden supports it, they'll be the same...
If only this were true...  I can't believe you actually believe that Biden gets a yes next to GND. Most of these are lies, which makes sense that you are a Biden supporter.  Do more research.
The good news is that at some point Biden or his VP/successor will need to run for re-election so they‚Äôll knock it off.
It‚Äôs so fucking ridiculous. If Trump or Biden came out in full support to legalize marijuana they would win the election hands down. It‚Äôs a no-brainer policy that is tangibly positive for voters and would motivate them. The rejection of it is only caused by greed and racism.

At the end of the day, it's your vote and your choice. Make that decision and don't let anyone tell you how you should or shouldn't vote. There's plenty of good reasons to vote for Biden and there's plenty of good reasons to vote for someone else. I know I'm gonna write in.
Oh. Sorry. That's just how much I care about whether or not Biden wins in Nov. ü§∑üèª
Yup. We're all aware that the crackdown won't end when Biden gets in the White House right? Biden will just find a way to legitimize/legalize it. After all, the precedent exists now...  And remember Obama's favorite phrase? "We don't look backward, we look forward."
The Pentagon has been shifting resources to prepare for war with China for about 2 decades now. Then the JOliver piece? We're gonna be hearing a lot more about how horrible China is as they start really ramping up. Biden's already released an anti-China ad.
They know which way the country is going in the future and there's definitely a blackout - which will continue if/when Biden gets in office. And you can bet they'll be sending in Feds to clear the streets in much more than just Portland under Biden!
Biden will help to get you started again
good God, has hogan said he's voting for biden?  i thought that's what you people wanted...
i encourage all bernie sanders supporters who do not want to vote for biden, to cast their vote for bernie as a write in candidate on november 3rd.
I‚Äôm not voting for Biden. I‚Äôm voting for RBGs replacement.  He wasn‚Äôt my first choice at all, but he is the other leading candidate for the major party. And at this point, I‚Äôd vote for a pool noodle with googly eyes.
i urge all bernie sanders supporters to stand up against biden and on november 3rd, write in bernie sanders as your choice for president.
Former Vice President Joe Biden was featured as the keynote speaker at the Iowa Democrats‚Äô 2020 Hall of Fame event on Sunday night, which honored IDP workers from different Iowa counties.
Good. I hope they actually have to n face some consequences. Gods know there isn't going to be any political/judicial accountability - even if Biden wins in Nov (which is far from guaranteed given the pandemic).
Good. Bernie's condition that delegates not criticize Biden made me really not want to bother running to be a national delegate.
And Biden voted for the fence in the first place.
have a cat who's hiding all the time? there are ways to coax him out. 1st off, he's hiding because he's saying, "leave me alone". he says that because he's scared. you can talk to him sweetly, offer treats &amp; gradually block his hiding spaces. hmm, we should try this on biden.
Carrying on the evening‚Äôs theme of persuading viewers to vote this fall, former Vice President Joe Biden presses the importance of electing Theresa Greenfield and of also reelecting the other Iowa Democrats in office.
Jason Amash was elected as a Republican.  You use different metrics than I do obviously.  Trump, for example, ran an honest campaign to win the Republican ticket in 2016. Biden pulled strings in back door deals.  The true delusion is not seeing truth.
You're in asshole mode again. Fair enough.  Yes, I use the metric of Biden saying something in campaigns and then going against that while in office.  There's all sorts of details on this. Why don't you care about that?
Yeah those silly progressives pointing out how insanely conservative Biden is. What a joke they are... üôÑ  So now you just have to trust the most lying presidential candidate of all time. Another way Biden is worse than Trump.
So 70% of Americans, including a majority of Republicans want M4A according to polls, and it's "not happening".  No wonder you're voting for Biden. You're about the most hopeless person I've ever spoken to on Twitter.  To what do you attribute the lack of policy that voters want?
1) Really? We had a recession under Obama and he didn't give people money.  We had tear gassed protestors... Dems didn't seem to care.  Why has dropped more bombs their first term?  On which topics has the policy of Biden been more liberal than Trump?
Do you think liberals will fight as hard against Biden as against Trump?  Do you think Dems will become more progressive and listen to Sanders more or less after winning?  If the goal is M4A do you think we'll get it sooner with a Biden win?

This is the Democratic Party on Biden.  There's no leadership. Just fall in line and give up.  Nothing will change. Give up hope. Cave to the oligarchy.  It's time to #DemExit THIS YEAR! They have failed us completely!
Some truth to that, but earning 1% is better than losing 50%. Biden is a crony capitalist, though, so the market could be o.k. under him.
Interesting theory: Trump will win re-election because Democrats will be too scared of the virus to leave their homes to vote for Biden, who they are lukewarm on.
I do think Biden is marginally better than Trump, yet I still will not vote for him.  Trump is a symptom of a much bigger problem: lack of citizen control of government (oligarchy).  Voting for Biden increases the power of the oligarchy, thus I won't be voting for him.  #DemExit
My grandfather is constantly asking me to ‚Äútell Joe Biden on xyz Twitter.‚Äù   I just say okay.
My husband &amp; I talked about that last night.  This is not Nixon, there should never be a pardon for anyone Barr, Trump, Flynn, Wolf, etc and the one thing that will piss us off is that Biden and the Dems allow pardons.
‚ÄúHealth experts call for country to shut down again.‚Äù  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Biden‚Äôs already gonna win, this isn‚Äôt necessary.
So is a Biden win priced into the stock market?
Exactly. I understand the rationalizations and the justifications. I understand fear of Trump. I can't stand the lying.  Why do ppl feel the need to pretend Biden is someone he's not in order to vote for him?
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúIowa Build Back Better Roundtable with Senator Amy Klobuchar‚Äù ‚Äì because I care about Iowa's caregivers &amp; those they care for. #TeamJoe
hey,   - your "ruling" on the matter described below is wrong.  i have ears.  two of them and they both work.  biden said both things.
Iowan, 59 yr old female and voting Biden.  My husband also voting Biden, but lots of men we know are dug in Trump supporters,  wanting the 1950s back. I'm serious, they want to go back to white male dominance .
And he says Joe Biden is incoherent.
The 2 most important decisions of the 2020 cycle, one brilliant, one fatally bad: (1) Democrats unite over 48 hours to dump Bernie &amp; exalt Biden - brilliant (2) Trump hires Fauci, acquiesces to shutting down the country - fatally bad. That is your 2020 election in a nutshell.
The Democrats wised up this time by running Biden. Hillary was polarizing. Biden is friendly, senile old grandpa. The party coming together to derail Bernie was brilliant.
Pardon his French, but he‚Äôs correct. The Republicans are trying to split the baby right now and it‚Äôs not going to work. They‚Äôre going to get crushed in November without Biden even having to campaign.
LOL, you are so funny.  As a "suburban" woman (housewife is such a 1950's term), I support Joe Biden.  Your "tough" measures remind me of a bully I once knew on the playground.   He ended up arrested for some "things" when he got older.  I hope you end up arrested for "things".
As a lefty, it feels like the hits against Biden are focused on the things the Left is leveling against Trump. This feels like another example of that. I don't think Biden's brain is any mushier than Trump's.
where's biden's?
happened to catch you talking with  and someone's former chief of staff (don't recall who) about biden's claim that the president is  first racist to be elected. is juan just talking like a fool for attention or does he believe this nonsense?
I mostly agree but I wouldn‚Äôt mind Biden talking sh^t to him right away because trump is a child and that‚Äôs all it would take to make him go off script and even dumber. Poke that ‚Äúbear‚Äù.
folks: nominally oppositional to Trump while pushing fake, foreign-propagated narratives re Biden in service to Trump, #MoscowMitch and of course Putin.  viaJoe Biden's search for a running mate enters final stretch
yeah I want links, if it's true doesn't mean Biden is better with his pedophilia self
like the rest of the Party, Biden has already surrender to the socialist of his party
RESISTERS THIS WORRIES ME! HOW ABOUT ALL OF YOU??   New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots
If Flynn betrayed country, Obama, Clinton &amp; Biden should be in a Russian prison for 100 life sentences. Along with about 100 other elected officials (Dem &amp; Rep) and another 1000 Deep State employees with truly documented violations of law. All WELL DOCUMENTED in recent books.
Didn‚Äôt you call out Biden for his racism that personally affected you?
And we will vote President Biden and Vice President Harris into office! #WeWillVote
Vice President Biden wants to win the ‚Äúmom vote‚Äù but has committed to:  - Eliminating Middle Class Tax Cuts - Healthcare for illegal immigrants  - Reducing funding for the police.   These policies are bad for Iowa families. I will stand against them. #IA01
it was utterly ridiculous the way Cavuto treated  he kept interrupting him when he had stats and proof that Obama and Biden‚Äôs economy and job loss stunk compared to  He needs to just state he hates Trump and is Democrat! crazy
Vot for Biden...and make Obama AG
then Biden has a ‚Äústroke‚Äù and abdicates his position to Kanye. perfect game theory
What‚Äôs most likely to happen is that Biden will win by a comfortable margin, Trump will vaguely say the election was illegitimate but leave the White House anyway, then transition into a Fox News fixture to gin up culture war bullshit

Hey,  ... remember April, when you called Joe Biden and the media crazy for suggesting Trump might want to delay the election?  Yeah, good times ...
It‚Äôs not about which candidate you like. Trump, as the incumbent, stands to gain more time as president if the election is delayed. Biden would lose potential time as president if the election was delayed.  (All assuming Biden wins. If Trump wins nothing would change.)
Hey first name bunch of numbers..... lol That makes no sense nobody said anything about Biden! Do you have any facts to substantiate your claims that Biden supports China or Wars? I'm feeling you don't but I'd be willing to look at any links you have.
IF YOU HAVE NOT LOOKED INTO JO JORGENSEN, PLEEEEASE DO IT.  NO TRUMP. NO BIDEN. We need this.  All of us. Need to be. FREE.
how did Trump cause 9/11 Bin Laden literally said he wanted to kill Obama because Biden would take control and is to incompetent that he would destroy the country and he is your pick?
Idk i feel like same exact scenario, background, etc but she's male and Biden flatly doesn't want someone aspiring for the presidency as his VP then you might hear some of the same. I'm sure there are sexist smears being lobbed against her, but this didnt feel like that to me
My worry is the bar is being set soooooo low for Biden by Republicans/conservatives that when he‚Äôs able to string 3 consecutive sentences together he will look like a genius
We gotta vote for Biden to get trump out of here but we gotta change the leadership in the house they  don‚Äôt care about working people they Golding before negotiations even started
There isn‚Äôt the votes unity but we might be living in a economic depression if Biden wins and the republicans keep the senate cause they are going impose some austerity that is going to do real damage to working families budgets I think dems want it to happen this way
Yeah...their profile says to stand up for what you think is right. That's somewhat problematic. What if they're wrong? Maybe Biden thought he was standing up for what is right! So should Biden then be applauded?
I wanted to stop by and say Hi. Is all going well for you Nancy? Things in this country keep changing and the future seems to be uncertain,but I am sure that when Joe Biden wins in November he will make America both united and respected again! God bless you NancyüôÇ

The point is he's doing EXACTLY what he believes needs to be done based on 40 years of SAYING EXACTLY what he's going to do.  Trump no saint - no one believes that. He's better than EVERY other politician in Washington stealing from YOU. Biden there for decades, now fix it? lol
In the second half of his remarks, Biden called Iowa a "critical battleground state" for his campaign and encouraged Iowans to vote for Democrats in Senate, House, and down-ballot races as well: "The stakes have never been higher, so we have to work harder than ever."

Hey  THIS IS Trump's America NOW! He OWNS it. You can't blame Biden, Obama, Clinton, or any other Democrat, he's owned the presidency for 3.5 years! Get a clue!
Can you give me 3-5 reasons why 4 more years of Trump would be awful? Honestly curious. Other than I don't like his tweets.  For example, he's finally standing up to China - something Biden and Obama went the other direction and appeased China. Is this good for us or bad?
This is BULLSHIT. This is what life is like NOW under Trump. Under Joe Biden, THIS WOULD NOT BE HAPPENING!!! We need a DECENT AND REAL PRESIDENT!!! Vote Blue!
This is what Donald Trump's America looks like NOW. It will NOT look like this once Biden is elected. Trump causes chaos and violence. THIS IS TRUMPS AMERICA, NOT OURS!But also we don't want biden to decide who we nominate in 2024, in 2020
I hate that Biden is taking his time but also it's probably a good thing lol

If football gets cancelled and presidential debates happen, Biden should absolutely point out that many of the viewers would be watching football instead if a Democrat had been in office.  Football fans will be pissed and I'd use that, if I were him.

Kamala wouldn‚Äôt be my first pick b/c there are more experienced people on the list (Rice, Warren) and I don‚Äôt love her prosecutorial record. But ‚Äúambition‚Äù is a stupid reason to disqualify her. Biden has called himself transitional. We need someone thinking about the next step.
I don‚Äôt know if Kamala should be VP. That depends entirely on her and Biden and their relationship and their respective visions. But I absolutely know this is stupid, sexist, insulting reasoning that would never be aimed at a male VP candidate, period.
In 2016, we pretty much knew  was gonna pick  Nobody else on the short list stood out and the search leaked like a old row boat. This time around, atm I don't know who Biden's gonna pick. I imagine we'll see a narrowed list in the next few days

I'm learning that. Slowly. On November 3rd, we'll take our final exam to see if we learned anything.  Spolier: I'm voting for this fellow "Biden".
Nope, sure won't
We got an ad that was like Joe Biden KNOWS someone who TALKED TO someone who PROBABLY THINKS we should DEFUND THE POLICE   ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
So, what does it tell you that you recognize so many descriptors of tRump in a list about Joe Biden?  Or do the bad things only matter when it's the "other side"? üôÑ (there's only really one side, anymore, the corporate one)
Kamala is a long-standing friend of the Bidens; and she‚Äôs worked with Beau and Dr. Biden. She‚Äôs had a longer personal and work relationship with the Biden family than Susan Rice. Rice is going to have to answer-rightly or wrongly-about Benghazi which won‚Äôt be pretty.
I am wholeheartedly supporting Joe Biden. The pretense that you‚Äôre too cool or woke to invest yourself in doing the same is boring as fuck.
Instead of finding a single line plucked out of a statement that you think falls short of ideal, read actual policy positions Biden advocates. The stakes are too high to play purity, fashion-show politics and pretend there‚Äôs any equivalence between Democrats and The Trump GOP
I don't know what the unhinged theories would be yet -- as far as I can tell, Biden hasn't adopted them yet. But if e.g. a Democratic President starts going down Goodman's rabbit holes, then yes, Trump should pardon to forestall malicious prosecutions.
Build neck, build back, better build back Biden üòé
I truly wish the Joe Biden I see in Trump ads was an option lol
Biden's notes on display: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô against Sen. Kamala Harris  via
So who do you think is Biden‚Äôs VP pick?  I‚Äôm thinking Kamala Harris - who is the second best choice IMO (behind Elizabeth Warren who should be at the top of the ticket) but the right choice.  She‚Äôd be an incredible younger Democratic to lead the party in the future.
Let‚Äôs build a future where we leave our kids a safer world. Fewer guns. And a stable climate instead of a #ClimateCrisis. I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden.
Why Biden? What policies does he represent that help you? How does he represent your interests? Or are your interests just limited to a 'D' behind the name &amp; you're happy?  Vast majority of registered Democratic voters favor policies like #M4A, #GND, &amp; others. He's against all.
"anarchists should be prosecuted" - 2020 Democratic Nominee Joe Biden
Nice word salad. Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt support universal healthcare
Pick one. All are accurate to Biden. The list for tRump would, of course, be far more extensive &amp; far less polite, so I'll agree there is a difference. Just not enough of one to be worthy of voting for.
I am and have been an independent since I‚Äôve been eligible to vote. Biden signed the patriot act, voted for the Iraq war, wrote the crime bill, and worked with segregationists to stop federally mandated. He‚Äôs a conservative....
Lol you‚Äôre a hack. You think we supported Bernie for his dashing good looks or charisma? It was because of policy you absolute nitwit. Biden is a moderate republican and  I truly feel sorry for you if you lack the basic empathy to support universal healthcare
If you rewind to just before the bad part, but then don't change the movie... What happens next when you hit "Play"?!?  That is what Joe Biden represents. He is not a solution. He is a band-aid on a gunshot wound. (2/2)
Biden for liars 2020
BECAUSE THE FUCKNUGGET YOU'RE BACKING DOES NOTHING TO PREVENT HIS RETURN! WHY IS THAT SO FUCKING HARD?!?  Joe Biden has outright promised his billionaire donors "Don't worry, nothing will fundamentally change." He represents a rewind to just before Trump. Nothing more. (1/2)
I am. It is too late for "incremental change". They've been pushing that bullshit for decades while actually changing little or nothing. If we want our kids &amp; grandkids to HAVE a future, WE have to act. NOW! Not in 4-8 years. Joe Biden is not an answer. He's just another puppet.
I feel for Biden...what a mess to clean up!
And we can unite against all of that, but not with Joe. Voting for Biden &amp; the Dem Party is only going against tRump &amp; nothing more. It is giving a free pass to all of the other corruption &amp; ugliness.  I'm voting Green. Their platform represents my values. DNC doesn't, at all.
Listening to Biden speaking...God, sounds great... Not duh...like Trump.
Because bernie didn‚Äôt do a good job at adapting post Nevada, manufactured consent by MSNBC and CNN and the entire field dropping out to endorse Biden. 88% of dems want Medicare for all. Wtf is your point?
If he decides to never testify before this committee again, I wouldn't blame him. Nor would I blame e.g. Biden's AG from refusing to testify, if this is how the committee conducts itself.
If the dems let a dem run on the most important issue of the election... Medicare for All. Which Biden said he would veto even if it passed everywhere else, so Biden is useless to me. Unless he did a UBI of 3 grand a month to cover medical costs for his term, then we can talk.
Phony Joni is going to stick by Trump no many how many Americans die.  Happy that both of them are behind in the polls for downplaying the pandemic that has cost the lives of 149,000 US citizens.  We need Biden more than ever.
One is talk, one is repeated action. Big difference. Also most of those girls were underaged when Biden was giving them a nice sniff.
Dems are looking at Biden's good polling numbers and doing everything they can to chip away at his lead
When Biden is elected. How long will it take for you to turn on trump?
Biden‚Äôs plan leaves over 10 million uninsured. That‚Äôs not universal lol
I‚Äôm pretty sure markets did crash and literally cities are burning and our country is currently suffering like never before but Biden isn‚Äôt president.  You are.

I was talking about Biden.  What does it tell you that you recognize so many similarities between the two? üôÑ
They way I‚Äôm describing joe Biden to older liberals is this: Trump is going to make me eat a bar of soap. Biden will only make me eat half a bar of soap, which is better. But we could try not eating soap at all.
Of course! Joe Biden (&amp; a bunch of his supporters) Elizabeth Warren Neera Tandem ...
That sucks, but that's her staff not her. The fact is w/ a week to go she's in a better position to get top 2 than him. I also personally think she'd be a better rep, regardless of if I align with Josh's policies more. But to say u trust her as much as Biden seems a bit unfounded
And Joe Biden is going to need Investigators and Spanish-speaking phone bank operators to assist in the "impossible" effort to reunite caged kids with their proper families.
And Joe Biden is going to need Spanish-speaking phone bank operators to assist in the "impossible" effort to reunite caged kids with their proper families.
Iowan for Biden!
Bah - we had better centrist choices too.  Biden is the political equivalent of Denny‚Äôs.  We ended up there because it was almost 9:00 and no one would pick a place.
The middle is &amp; has been doing everything in it's power to ostracize &amp; demonize anything &amp; anyone left of Biden (so, you know, *actually* Left). There is no longer anything even remotely Left about the Democratic Party, &amp; that is precisely the real problem.
The establishment picked Biden to protect the status quo &amp; solidify/protect the control of their wealthy &amp; corporate Masters. They scarcely even bother pretending to give a shit what voters want or care about anymore, so why with this constant gaslighting bullshit?
Same. I'd like someone fully committed to the job and able to set into the presidency if needed, but also won't run themselves. Dont know if that's Biden's thought process though
The Note: Trump attacks on Biden may not work -- and may not matter - ABC News -  via
This actually bothers me. It will be tacky as hell and probably have a somewhat lasting impact. Just like Trump redesigning Air Force One with an over the top USA theme that won‚Äôt even be ready until (hopefully) Biden is President.
Joe Biden rallied Iowa Democrats at Sunday‚Äôs Hall of Fame Celebration, saying the state is critical for his campaign and flipping the Senate in the general election.
LOL Biden outpolls Trump when asking which candidate exhibits more leadership.
Joe Biden called Iowa a critical battleground state for his campaign during the Iowa Democratic Party's virtual Hall of Fame Celebration.
I keep seeing people telling me not to relax and assume Biden will beat Trump and I really would like to meet the genius of serenity who can feel anything but terror contemplating the future
Biden has already said he will only serve one term because of his age
Joe Biden can beat himself off.  He's not a helpless Incel like Trump.
Can we get a task force assigned to this. Biden needs a boat parade immediately.
Biden has many allegation I believe what I see of Biden, for trump no evidence just hearsay no convicted.
Trump pic is edited Biden pic is realüòÇ
You will vote for creepy pervert BidenüòÇ I bit you‚Äôre the same as pervert as himüòÇ
You are acting stupid AF. Simple polling/math shows the majority does not support defunding the police. Biden has said he won‚Äôt defund the police. Actions of few do not speak for majority.
These donald adds saying that if Biden gets elected nobody will answer 911 calls are fucking ridiculous. Good Lord he's desperate and appealing to his fans.
Remember when this guy got fired for racist tweets? Sam Nunberg, the adviser who came up with the Mexico wall idea, says he still wants to see it built ‚Äî and that Trump would 'kill' Biden in a debate on border issues  #greatwhitesupremisthope
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Except that Joe Biden does not represent "triage". He's a band-aid on a goddamn gunshot wound. If you want to make an argument, at least make one that contains a lick of logic. Biden represents *nothing* that will fix the very issues that gave us Trump to begin with. üôÑ
No lie. Bernie's history is very well documented. The question would be why are you so adamant about denying his record, or that he was made for this very moment in history, while Biden's record looks just barely better than Trump's?
Dear Sarah. My name is Mark. To be perfectly fair, I think a pro Joe (Biden) lipsink) would be fabulous. #iowa
A vote for Biden is a vote for kanye
No, Trump and Biden are both statist, war mongers. I care for neither. Not voting is the only moral alternative.
If you‚Äôre serious about being president, shouldn‚Äôt you be focusing on beating Biden AND Trump?! It is clear your end game is to get trump re-elected
I simply posted a verified Trump quote, sorry it caused you so much angst.  Trump is a populist who will change with the political winds. He has no core values.  Why did you mention clueless Joe Biden?
Interesting how u say you‚Äôll beat Biden but not trump? #Biden2020
Rice was a key proponent of Libyan military intervention &amp; largely responsible for the weak response to Russian election hacking in ‚Äò16, 2 of the biggest policy failures of the last administration. She‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near Biden‚Äôs team
Is this the mythical "most progressive policy ever" that Biden is running on?
It's still hilarious that people say that this is what will happen in Biden's America while conveniently ignoring the fact that it's actually happening in Trump's America.
Not at all. We're the only ones actually demanding more than just the bare minimum of "better than tRump". That's a bar so goddamn low, I'd have to dig a fucking hole before I could trip over it, yet Joe Biden &amp; the DNC regularly manage to! #StandUp #FightBack #DemandBetter
This entire administration is a 4-year long Frye Festival. I for one cannot wait to get off the island in January after Biden sweeps in November.
"No matter where he goes, be there... It's called the Joe Biden"  "That's creepy man"  New Girl was ahead of their time with Creepy Biden jokes
Because reporters covered the event, &amp; miracle of miracles, actually reported on it instead of covering it up.   You want to know where the Democratic Party stands? Take a look at the recent voting on the military budgets.  THAT's your precious Party. And Biden is their choice.
How about anything that we want? One actual, fully delivered policy?  I'm not demanding anything except that our govt actually work for us, not just the moneyed minority. Biden &amp; the Dems don't. Deny it all you want, it's still the truth.  Biden will not protect what we've gained
You ACTUALLY believe that bullshit, don't you? Biden tells us "I'm gonna change things", but then goes behind closed doors to tell his billionaire donors "Don't worry, nothing will fundamentally change." Why in hell would you assume he's lying to them, but not you? üòÇ
Fox News poll shows Trump trailing Biden in Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania -  Iowans will vote Phony Joni out as well
Well correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure Biden nearly failed the cognitive test.
let‚Äôs not act like it‚Äôs not just a big game that we all agree to play because we‚Äôre so strongly influenced to do so. Back to back elections of Trump vs Clinton and now Trump vs Biden? Consciousness of the masses is at a putrid state. But subconsciously most realize the game!
Joe Biden is a corporate puppet with dementia that has already promised his billionaire donors that "Nothing will fundamentally change." Deny it all you want, you know it's the truth. If you want anything in exchange for your vote, you'll have to look outside the duopoly.
We‚Äôre right on track to kill this thing in the first half of 2021. But we need Joe Biden in the White House.
I hope at the convention Biden announces a coronavirus task force that includes top medical experts headed by Vice President Kamala Harris and special advisor Barack Obama
Neo con Rep for Biden. I live in Iowa. I haven‚Äôt seen many Trump signs in 3.5 years. Certainly not new ones. Perhaps I‚Äôm not observant, or perhaps they are in hiding. I‚Äôm going with the latter.
A Biden presidency is good for the plutocrats. That's all. He protects the status quo &amp; puts libs back to sleep. That was the whole point of the Dem Party rigging the hell out of the primaries.  If you want to support change &amp; actually help people? Break the duopoly. Vote Green.
This is true. Joe Biden would listen to others because he is not competent enough to make decisions without someone holding his hand.
"probably" Good to see that you're so certain.üôÑ Try taking a look at Biden's history &amp; tell me what "progressive legislation" you think he will be defending with his pick? Abortion? No. Soc Security? No. Environmental regulations? No. Maybe LGBT marriage?
I‚Äôm a mom of two kids.  I live in an Iowa suburb.  I bust my ass for my kids and vote thinking about them.  I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden because of #ClimateCrisis and I care about other people. #ImVoting4BidenBecause I care about human life and #BlackLivesMatter  #VoteForOurLives
&lt;Biden&gt;Here's the deal, folks&lt;/Biden&gt;  The Statues of racists are just emblems of institutions that need to be dismantled as well.  Taking down a statue or renaming the Edmund Pettus bridge is a good first step. If it's the last step, nothing has changed.
#ImVoting4BidenBecause our current ‚Äúplan‚Äù to open schools sucks.  Biden and Obama set up a Pandemic Team and had scientists in Wuhan among other countries that could have stopped this Covid 19 but Trump cut the funding.
I'm in very liberal Iowa City, have seen two Biden yard signs. No bumper stickers, t-shirts, etc.

‚ô•Ô∏è  Joe Biden was not my first choice heading into the election, but you can‚Äôt deny how hopeful it feels to see a real human being with empathy and intelligence in this race.
I was honestly surprised that Trump recalled the "5 words" in that interview. And I'd be surprised if Biden could do the same.  We're screwed.
sure, but I don't have a lot of confidence in either Trump or Biden to lead the country, regardless of which one might be comparatively better or worse.
Hardly..Biden is the least progressive of all the candidates. Don't buy the BS fox news is peddling.Absolutely agree..the 2party system is always a race to the bottom.  We need a transitional period to fix this system because it doesnt deal with a corrupt president.  BBC said it best...Biden is smooth jazz in the background. Trump is heavy medal screaming at you every damn day.
Biden quotes his wife quoting Kierkegaard:  "Faith sees best in the dark"
Everyone pretend you don't see these polls. Pretend Trump is ahead and we have to do literally everything possible to gather votes for Biden. Complacency could be devastating, and we CANNOT do 4 more years of Trump. It has to be a MASSIVE loss to deliver the message to Trumpism.

Imagine thinking this would tank Biden.
Biden hit his peak about two weeks ago.  Trump is closing the gap now.
Not big on conspiracies, but the best way for a Harris supporter to force Biden to tap her is: Send reporters to donors/associates who you know have shitty opinions on Harris.  Pushback inevitably falls against Biden himself &amp; can only be redressed by putting Harris on the ticket

I don't understand why otherwise intelligent people are letting terrible headlines convince them that Biden / his campaign staff think Harris is 'too ambitious'.  *Every single article* attributes those opinions to "Biden allies".  So in other words: NOT BIDEN &amp; NOT HIS CAMPAIGN.
Bro, you‚Äôre going to lose to Joe Freaking Biden
Biden will do the right thing here. The stakes are too high now.
Focus first on voting out every R member of every office throughout the country  and replacing them with Biden &amp; Ds down the line == then get behind them and push them to legislate what you want = it‚Äôs not enough to win elections, need to govern too
You heard it from the leader of the Squad: Joe Biden has the most progressive (socialist) platform of any candidate ever. #mn05 #stribpol
This was the most smooth brained thing I've read today. Why did the other countries ban it then? Why did Joe biden force his staffers to delete it?

The news?? Since when is it the role of the news to present the detailed position statements and actual ideas of political candidates? Or is that just your admission that Biden needs that much help and support because he isn‚Äôt capable of handling it on his own?
Don't listen to Obama and Biden.
Hey Biden incase you were unaware ther's a virus called covid-19 thats causing this. Are you unaware?I mean you of all people should be aware of this.. your statement is kinda like hey we are going threw something we didn't see coming when you were hitting the golf ball on hole 1
Obviously Bush v. Gore happened and could happen again. For that to happen, the election has to be very close *and* it must make a difference in the outcome. It's a rare combination of circumstances, though serious enough for Biden to have a staffer game it out.
Oh bullshit...Trump is gonna squash Biden....he hasn't  a snowballs chance in hell!!!!!
Oh yeah he‚Äôs fresh out of viable plans. There also way to defeat Joe Biden and he knows it.
I'm a mom who would like school to open *when it's safe* (which it's not), and I support Joe Biden. Your tweet makes no sense.
I love how the main line of attack on Biden is he's a doddering old man who can't remember anything, like anything this doddering old man says registers in his own head
Just being diplomatic. Maybe he could say "I'm glad that former President Trump is still here to help with the transition to the Biden presidency."
Why remove him from the premises? The Constitution doesn't even mention the White House.   Biden can just take the oath and set up shop with Trump still in there. He can call Trump an honored guest.  #thebeat

It made sense before it was 1on1, You vs Biden. I mean,  was literally sending voters out to die to stop #Bernie from being nominated. Perfect time!  In fact, I tweeted it to you Donny! Fairly early in the year too...  I'm starting to wonder if you even read my tweets?!
Okay so I want honest opinions... I don't see anyone that supports Biden anymore I see a lot of Jo Jorgensen and Trump. If you are still for Biden please PM me why.
Oh God, here we go again. Biden was reading what‚Äôs called a direct quotation. All you heard was the ‚ÄúN-word.‚Äù Listen to EVERYTHING and not just the parts that you think prove your ‚Äúpoint.‚Äù Prior to saying what someone else said, he says, ‚Äúquote.‚Äù How‚Äôs Remedial English going?

Trump should, not Biden.
Romney can't even commit to voting for Biden. Unbelievable.
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ I guess he would resign and then ask Dense to pardon him or he wo ih ld Hitler himself. My question is, if he resigns and gets pardoned, can President Biden remove that pardon! I'm just wondering.
Is it just me, or does it kind of feel like right now Joe Biden could shoot somebody on 5th avenue and still get elected? #YesItsThatBad
IA3. It was Trump +3 in 2016 and Cindy Axne won by 2 in 2018. So I guess Biden+ 2  but I am not an expert so maybe other people have a better idea.
No the American people are terrified if Biden gets elected. America will be destroyed by the Democrat party
OMG, you think people are just going to write "Biden" on a scrap of paper and send it in, don't you? I guess that's what happens when you swear in a president who doesn't have the slightest idea how government works.
He can‚Äôt get it done.  He is just trolling the Biden campaign.
He WILL announce Harris. The Biden-Harris ticket has been what the DNC has wanted since he announced. It‚Äôs a given. But the problem remains that Joe is still top of the ticket. A wide field of very capable candidates and the absolute weakest is the default nominee. üôÑ
You want to give Biden bedbugs?

You actually think Joe Biden is going to win? Everyone knows the left is dangerous and the right doesn‚Äôt give an an accurate response on the poll phone calls because of it. Biden is literally pooping in diapers. No chance

Had this program been allowsed to stand (Biden will double down) towns everywhere would have to scrap zoning, build bigger water and sewer lines to make room for high density living, expand schools and social services.  Thus would lead to massive local taxes increases.  1/2
So clearly we have two presidential candidates who are obsessively focused on Donald Trump: Trump himself and Biden. Is there anyone out there willing to run and share their own ideas?
Oh.....so your voting for Biden then?
Don‚Äôt worry. America, not Joe Biden, will keep her from becoming VP.
Biden is going to beat that man like a drum. I can't wait.
I‚Äôm thinking Biden will be loyal to the constitution as well.
I suppose that makes sense. I‚Äôve just never seen it. Everyone I know irl who ‚Äúsupports‚Äù Biden will tell you they really wanted someone else but he‚Äôs better than trump so he‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got now. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve even read anything online expressing actual support for Biden.

Man it‚Äôs almost like the way voting works that abstaining is itself a choice?!?!  Look I am wildly anti-Biden / progressive (probably more left than Bernie who was my preferred candidate). We can push on Biden, call out his bullshit, and avoid encouraging disengagement. Not hard.
Here is my take and I credit the BBC.  Biden is like smooth jazz playing in the background. Trump is like heavy metal screaming profanities in your ear every day.  That's why Biden get elected because we need a break from all of the chaos and need some quiet.
The guy is a complete train wreck. Seems like he can hardly complete a thought that isn't scripted. He and Biden must have interesting conversations.

Mediocre equals standing up 4 what is right?  Who raised children when spouse died?  Or....a man who isn‚Äôt religious, says he is; says he cares about the working man, doesn‚Äôt; a man who imprisoned children fr parents. Biden is a solid, his side-kick will be the strongest VP ever.
You mean Biden right?
(3/3) According to Genderbot, Trump is more gender fluid than Biden by 2%.
A Biden rally.....
I need to remind you that Biden was dead in the water until South Carolina and Bernie won the previous three primaries. It's easy to forget if you're a dead-ender
Absolutely correct. And the fact that Biden does not understand this proves his neoliberal core.  We live in a shitty two party system in which they are really the same shitty party.
It's not sabotage when two top candidates drop out the day before Super Tuesday and immediately endorse Biden after he won one state? Also Bernie was polling way ahead of all of them for months lol. I know it's convenient to ignore facts but you're better than this
This is all wrong. Warren lost support after she backed down from M4A and tried to sabotage Bernie. It takes a big leap in logic to think that Biden won the primary not because of collusion and sabotage but because of his refusal to support something people like.
Bad analysis! Biden pulling right will cost him
Joe Biden fucking sucks huh
Biden vows to fight racial inequalities with economic agenda
Biden can stay on message.  Trump juat pulls ideas out of his rather large a$$
What choice did this GOP and Trump leave us?  The hell on earth called Trump or Biden.  We have no choice but to save ourselves.
President Trump's policies have been harmful for rural areas in general and agriculture in particular, argues Tom Vilsack.
Most pointless, drawn-out, anti-climactic political PR ploy ever. It will be Kamala Harris. We‚Äôve known that the  has wanted the Biden-Harris ticket from the day he announced. üôÑ
I have my preferences, but I trust Joe and his team to make a solid choice.
There's also 2000.  That being said, it's prudent for Biden to have folks working on such scenarios but the main concern for most folksbis to get the vote out so we don't have to worry about it. Eyes on the prize.

Hey sis Bernie lost and endorsed Biden. So what you like us to do? And in the big picture does it make any difference when you think now.
This idea that Biden is ‚Äúbeating‚Äù Trump because some polls say so in July is crazy. 2016 redux. Polls don‚Äôt account for voter suppression, extremely rural voters, or media comeback narratives, to say nothing of foreign interference. Polls = false confidence. #Election2020
Still the candidate on whom I'd put my money if I had to gamble on a running mate. She's from a swing state, she has a remarkable biography, and she endorsed Biden instead of running against him.
He knows that's a lie. Pompeo and Trump gave away TONS of PPE from the Obama/Biden stockpile and bragged about it on the State Dept website. February 2020, if they haven't hidden it by now.

If it's a contest between Biden and Trump, nothing will dissuade me from voting for Biden. I'm tired of being pissed off each and every day for the past three and a half years. I'm tired of lies and corruption.

Could be because Vietnam is one of the countries that Pompeo and Trump rushed to send OUR PPE to, depleting the Obama/Biden stockpile completely. (Double back in  feed to this spring; the info also used to be on the US State Dept's website.)
Yang endorsed Biden when he was the presumptive nominee.
I don't understand how you can call yourself a conservative and yet you think Trump should be voted out, when Trump is the most conservative president we've had in decades. There will be NOTHING conservative about a Biden presidency.
i wish joe biden was actually as cool as the anti-biden ads make him out to be
My husband is ashamed he voted for Trump, I asked him if he was just not going to vote, his response, "Oh yes I'm voting, for Biden" we live in Iowa
I don't need to win a debate with you. If you want to express your privilege and sense of superiority by withholding your vote from Biden, it's a free country. The fact that you dismiss the importance of SCOTUS shows you are not very discerning.
Whose ideological purity? Biden's far from my ideal candidate. I generally agree with Bernie's policies and would have supported him if he had any chance in hell of winning 270 electoral votes in any of our lifetimes.
Congratulations on being more of a pure leftist than Angela Davis.  Also enjoy feeling superior while you never have to worry about losing your reproductive rights.
Biden wasn't my first, second, or third choice in the Democratic field. We all know he's not on the progressive wing of the party. Right now the choice whether you want Biden or Trump to appoint RBG's successor on SCOTUS.
I will back Biden if he pledges M4A
By voting for Joe Biden!
I believe most Ds would vote for Bernie. However there are a lot of Iowans (especially no-party but also moderate Rs) who would vote for Biden but not for Bernie. If you don't acknowledge this we will have to agree to disagree. Older voters are comfortable with Biden.
Nearly three in four Iowans who voted in 2020 primary (73.6%) were at least 50 years old. Just 13% were under age 35. That in a nutshell is why many Democrats are relieved that Joe Biden is the nominee, rather than Bernie Sanders.
Biden‚Äôs available for tapioca cups and that‚Äôs about it.
OR they're not really Biden supporters and are looking for ways to turn his actual supporters against him.
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a ‚Äúhappy day‚Äù result in the cards in any case. If Biden peacefully wins, at best it will be a ‚Äúrelieved but still terrified‚Äù. #maddow
Our neighbor just said: Obama is responsible for starting all this black rioting. She can't wait until the stuff comes out on Biden. Says Biden didn't do anything wrong in office, but did "stuff" when not in office. And, God put Trump here. Neighbor =avid Fox News watcher. ü§Æ

Biden just wants everyone to vote for him. Hell Obuma didnt even endorse Biden until it was just him. Oh yeah, Obuma was a traitor to the United States.
The amount of revenue the Trump campaign raised via those sales is astounding. Biden memorabilia hasn't quite yet caught on.
And then, they get to blame Biden for the disastrous mess it's leaving. (cf Bush's stock market collapse somehow becoming Obama's "lagging economy.")
Nail is already in. Biden just needs to shut up for 3 months. I don‚Äôt think it will be even close.
AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
Fair enough, and you are not wrong.  As long as there isn‚Äôt any alt-left, antifa crap in yours.  I would honestly like to know why anyone would vote for Biden.  If it‚Äôs only to take Trump out that‚Äôs a sad statement from the left.
Interesting idea.  Unfortunately, it would require Trump, McConnell, Biden, Nancy, &amp; Chuck to all stand side by side and agree to bipartisan support of this idea.  They would need to lead in the ‚Äúcoming together‚Äù for this to work.  Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt see that happening.
You think? Tell me,  can you name something, anything Biden has accomplished on his own? His failures and shady dealings far outweigh any successes he might have.
It questions how much Delaware really supports Biden when the legislature is having to sue University of Delaware to release the senate papers from Biden.

Joe Biden rallies Iowa Democrats 100 days out from general election - The Daily Iowan
"It's clear who takes #Iowa seriously. President  campaign has had a presence in-state since 2016 while Joe Biden parachutes in 100 days out merely to make a scripted, pre-recorded speech that lasted only three minutes to the Democratic donor class." #MAGA
Lol, is this your Warren plug? 8 years difference and the same age as Biden.  Personally, I was really hopeful that Warren wouldn't do something stupid like try to take Bernie out at the knees as a last minute bid to save herself.  Or that Booker would've caught more traction.
"We need leadership that recognizes the real threat of this pandemic and doesn't just wave a white flag of surrender, like the president is,"  said in virtual remarks to Iowa Democrats Sunday.

I don't want Joe Biden louder than Trump. I want Biden to get elected. To do that, Joe needs to stay in his basement and talk as little as possible. It has been working so far. This is not the time to change that strategy. Trump's tweets are just one of his many undoings.

What republican in their right mind would support Biden?
In other good news, the weighted polling average has Trump up in Iowa by only 0.3% - a state he won by almost 10 points. Several polls show Biden ahead. even better is Joni Ernst's great unpopularity. We could get a twofur with Biden and her senate seat!.

(2/2) The elections of 1912 and 1992 are proof; it's simple math. Any vote that isn't for Biden is a vote against Biden. Right now, Progressives need to prioritize harm reduction, we lost our chance at Bernie this time, we need to move on. Retweet this if you agree.
No it is, For you it's performative because the normal thing IYO is to shut up and take misogyny just because you don't want to do anything about it in the same situation.  She had enough influence for Biden to bring her into the fold, there's a reason for that. üòâ
After he became presumptive nominee she was never going to attack him given the stakes. Biden giving her a slot has more to do with him trying to win some progressives over by having her as a part of the operations to show he's serious about listening to them.
Axios chose an astonishingly poor photo of Joe Biden! And we viewers tend to consider that deliberate, since there are plenty of good ones available.

There's only 1 way to prevent China from owning more of our country. It's to re-elect DONALD TRUMP #POTUS ! If you think it's safe to hand the keys over to Joe Biden, who owes China MILLIONS for the favors they've done him then you're severely infected w/#TDS #MAGA  #Trump2020
at this point it is not even about the weed anymore the DNC and Joe Biden are still fully embracing the mass incarceration of non-violent drug offenders. the system is broken
In January of this year President Trump halted air travel from China, where the COVID-19 virus originated. Instead of getting on board with this appropriate control measure, Joe Biden labeled Trump as xenophobic, a China hater and a fear mongerer.‚Ä¶
Politico is owned by China just like Joe Biden, so it makes sense that they'd know. #KAG

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa ‚Äî With America dealing with multiple national crises, former Vice President Joe Biden told Iowa Democrats the country needs leadership that ‚Äústrives to finally deliver on our founding principles.‚Äù
If Biden wins you‚Äôll be calling her POTUS within 6 months
We want to hear Biden say how he's going to do all that... But he won't.. He'll say it's not because he doesn't have any idea where hes at.. or what hes doing He's afraid Trump is going to steal his ideas
Wasting their votes is not the worst of it. A vote for a third party candidate is a vote against Biden.
Sure. I‚Äôd also like more of Tara Reade‚Äôs and the other 7 women‚Äôs stories about Biden.
Lol that was funny ü§£ both these candidates are lunatics, but honestly mike is joe Biden all there in your opinion?
Joe Biden elected as second racist US president.
SOP with diplomacy, tit for tat, it will all be better again when President Biden takes over.
I remember the H1N1 pandemic and you had to be on your deathbed to be tested, but Biden would handle this much better üôÑ
They may be using Biden‚Äôs brother as his double. They look very much alike.
He thought he was going to beat Obama/Biden by picking Paul Ryan, too.
We all hate Joe Biden.
First, the POTUS made fun of Joe Biden for wearing a face mask....
Biden is a tool people.
No way this actually came out of Joe Biden's mouth.
Don't get it twisted, this is America today.. Trump's America, and it will only get worse if we keep him in office.  This America right now is a very scary place.  We need Joe Biden to save what's left of our republic.
You have no idea what you are even talking about!! You put those same words and put them against Biden you get the same results!!
All this is doing is dividing! You all say Trump is dividing Americans! No having a presidential candidate call a whole group of people racist is what you call dividing!! You have no basis on how Trump is supposedly a Racist! We can point you to how Biden is though!!
I'm not sure about this re-election strategy.....   'If we elect Joe Biden, the stuff that is happening while Trump is President is going to happen.'YOUR DOING THE SAME THING WITH BIDEN SSKSSKSHSHSKS
Three people charged in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
I‚Äôve typed this many times to many ppl in the thread. This type of overconfidence in an election win is dangerous. Especially with a candidate like Joe Biden as your Best In Show. Hillary was expected and projected to beat trump in 2016 and it didn‚Äôt happen. We‚Äôll see tho.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

Mainstream media can‚Äôt promote Bill or Hillary endorsing Biden for President if they bring it up. Especially with Creepy Uncle Joes history.
trump is our national embarrassment. VOTE JOE BIDEN!!!!
So, we‚Äôre all going to go vote in November right? I know I am, and I‚Äôm really trying not to have an impeached Trump get a second term but I also genuinely despise Joe Biden. üôÉ I‚Äôve done my research on  and  I definitely endorse him, I cannot endorse the other two.
I am an Iowan for Biden but good luck!
Voting for Biden in one election doesn‚Äôt absolve you of all the really shitty decisions that have made this country weaker in so many ways. You have used the #LGBTQ community as a bogeyman. You have used #Black folks as a bogeyman. Your party is divisive and mendacious.
Ah see now I‚Äôm more knowledgeable on electoral landslides thank you. Regardless i stand by my words in saying it‚Äôs going to happen. And the cockiness I‚Äôm seeing from the left is a very dangerous mindset. No election is a guaranteed victory. Especially with a candidate like Biden.
To be fair I feel like people are even less confident about the democratic nominee in 2020 than they were in 2016 so yes you‚Äôre right it‚Äôs not 2016. It‚Äôs an even worse situation where most people don‚Äôt even want Biden. That‚Äôs a strange situation to be so confident in a trump loss
Because Biden didn‚Äôt run.
I reckon Joe Biden would be harder, dude would probably forget why he even stopped by within a minute.
Joe Biden? More like McDoesn't know where the fuck he is half the time.
Will Joe Biden be Kamala Harris‚Äôs new sugar daddy?  VP Nod?
OMG! You're a HillBot. I am so glad she lost a Trump. Kamala is a Hillary clone and I HATE her for that.   I'll be grudgingly vote for Biden as long as he doesn't pick Harris as VP.
Yes! I was going to go along with the Biden thing because I want to get rid of Trump. But if he picks Kamala Harris, I'm writing Bernie Sander's name in. F that crap, I'm not voting for that bi%ch.
The proverity level where we live.  You have done many hurtful things to me personally. I have taken it personal. I don‚Äôt love Biden but the hate you have showed to me gives me more motivation than I have ever had to vote. I went from being a strong Republican to now
My doctor told me this morning that I am diabetic. Not only that, but she sent prescriptions to my pharmacy for glucose testing and such. $100, I can‚Äôt afford it. My Medicare advantage doesn‚Äôt cover them. I only hope I live long enough to see Biden elected.
That is ridiculous. There are plenty other women of color who aren't willing to Flip-flop on policies or walk over the top with someone just to be VP or president. Joe Biden needs a Tim Kaine kind of VP.
She is too ambitious. She will overshadow Biden. She's the type that would have no problem declaring him incompetent and she the next President. She's a Hillary clone and should never be trusted or be the vice president let alone president. #NeverKamala
We‚Äôve been on the scary path the last 4 years... Biden‚Äôs already been in the White House, thus we already know how he will act.
I am going to have a hard time voting for Joe Biden as it is. With Kamala as VP, I may not be able to bring myself low enough to vote for Biden with Hillary's clone on the ticket.
I joked that the DNC was going to "Weekend At Bernie's" Biden to the White House, but they are really committing to the bit now
Trump &amp; GOP are getting desperate. They know he's going to lose in a landslide to a weak candidate so they're using socialism as a scare tactic.   Joe Biden is NOT a Trojan Horse for Progressives, AOC &amp; Bernie. ü§£ü§£ He's actually an old style Repub. That's what is scaring them.
Biden is a well balanced, caring man who shows America needs him. Joe doesn‚Äôt need groupies, we get when we have Joe, truth &amp; visionAccording to the polls America loves Joe. We need calm but mostly someone we can trust, that Joe. With trump, it‚Äôs been 3-1/2 years ofchaos &amp; fear.
That is hilarious. Now Biden‚Äôs dementia is right wing propaganda. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Wait...I thought this was Biden‚Äôs America?? November 3rd...vote!!!!!!
Then if it's not race related why is Biden ONLY considering a female person of color for his VP pick? Unfortunately, every thing is about race these days regardless of whether you like it or not.
Yeah vote for biden cause you are screwing us.
biden forgot how to spell joe this morning.
Also Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee... idk that seems like a compromise with the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù to me
Why couldn't we have had Booker instead of Biden?? ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
Biden LITERALLY told a room full of donors that, "Nothing will fundamentally change." His words.
I wonder how many Republicans will be a part of the Biden administration? Bet there will be more fascists than progressives.
Too bad that they made the decision of Biden being the nominee before a single vote was cast. Fixing elections is fine when Democrats do it. Right?
Kamala Harris is an egomaniac. Biden will never take someone who will outshine. She insulted him he will never forgive her. We need to end all her hopes of ever becoming vice president or president She's a horrible Hillary Clinton wanna be. ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ
No one's falling for your distraction from the real news Biden is considering Karen Bass as VP. Anything you say or do is small beans compared to that.
Here lies Joe Biden:
Bring back decency. Rest in Power John Lewis. Trump refused to go honor his life. #JohnLewis #JoeBiden   ‚ÄúJoe and Jill Biden pay their respects to late civil rights icon John Lewis, who is lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda.
As President,  will fight for equal pay, combat discrimination and harassment in the workplace, invest in women-owned small businesses, expand access to health care and so much more. With the Biden Agenda for Women, we can build a tomorrow that is better for all of us.
Iam definitely voting for Joe Biden, there is no.way I would ever vote for Trump. In my opinion he represents  everything a leader of this country should not be. It may take awhile to correct the damage he has done but we can do it.  #ResistanceTaskForce

That‚Äôs nice of her to do that for Joe Biden
If he doesn‚Äôt go they‚Äôll criticize him for not paying his respects  If he does go they‚Äôll criticize him for not practicing social distancing. Damned if ya do damned if ya don‚Äôt. Whatever Biden decides to do will be considered ‚ÄúPresidential‚Äù though.
Have you read anything about Joe Biden?
Harris basically called Biden a racist in the debates. Joe like Hillary wants someone who will never threaten their position as POTUS. Kamala is not a yes girl or one to play 2nd fiddle. She's too ambititous and that's threatening to Biden. Even Hillary picked a yes man as VP.
FU K-Hive. Kamala Harris is too ambitious and will not be content to be 2nd in charge. Joe Biden has an ego like Hillary's and once you do him wrong, he never forgives.   Harris will NEVER be VP or president. Rep. Karen Bass  will be Biden's VP.

This is the funniest tweet I've ever seen. What kind of an idiot thinks Joe Biden is a leftist? Joe Biden is extremely conservative Democrat he borders on being a Republicanü§Æü§Æü§Æ  There was absolutely nothing about Joe Biden did is remotely left or Progressive.
Do people really fall for this bullshit you‚Äôre peddling about Biden? #GOPBetrayedAmerica #Resist
If 2020 first give us Biden as President, I will be moving.
this #liar will block anybody who exposes him. He willingly and openly does business with the corrupt and shady #Alibaba he told me he doesn't care. As long as he gets his money he doesn't care what they do. He is as #corrupt as #Biden I will continue to exposehim
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.  Wake up, MAGA! He hates YOU as much as he hates us...you just aren‚Äôt listening.ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #BlackLivesMatter  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  üçäü§°ü§¨üåäüíôüåäüíô‚òÆÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è
do you get enough personal pleasure from snarky comments about Biden, Obama, Hillary and Dems to keep you happy through 4 more years of DT‚Äôs regime? Your Junior High mean girl act is getting old.
so he blocks me after I exposed him for the fraud that he is. He is like Biden Jr, all he cares about is money.which is why he doesn't care about doing business with shady Alibaba, which commits intellectual property theft. And he knows they do. #MAGA #dirty #liar
Uhhh, hey ‚Äògenius‚Äô....Biden isn‚Äôt the President so who IS the President to blame here?
this is the guy who suggested I do business with shady #alibaba ,aka China, who steal a intellectual property and resell it. He said he didn't care about morality, just about making money. Don't believe a word this dirty bird says. He is just like Biden.
If Joe Biden endorsed,  Medicare For All  Green New Deal  Work Place Democracy  Banning Private Prison  Marijuana Legalization   ... I might endorse him.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Quick, where do I vote for Biden?
Why should I support a candidate that doesn‚Äôt support Medicare for All or The Green New Deal? Other than not Trump, Biden is basically a Republican.
I hope they slip a dementia test into the Biden/Trump debates. Just have ‚Äòem both randomly trying to remember five words.
Is Biden secretly paying you? Because you keep sharing things that are a HUGE positive thing for the country if Biden is elected. I mean, I was already voting for him, but this is just another cherry on top. Keep highlighting his good policies. It helps sink Trump!
Can't wait for November 2020 when Biden wins the presidency and suddenly every single conservative media outlet starts becoming way more worried about coronavirus so they can blame him for not doing anything about it when he takes office in January.
Yep. When Biden wins itll all go back to normal. I'm glad. Trump is putting to much sunlight on our problems. It must stop.
The trump ad attacking Biden is nausea inducing. He's saying Biden is for defunding the police and it's a scare tactic. It looks like a bad cut-and-paste job. Joe Biden says, "Yes, absolutely." Yes absolutely to what? Maybe someone asked him if he wanted fries with that.
I cant wait to vote for JOE BIDEN  I cant wait to vote for THERESA GREENFIELD
Mitt Romney is fear-mongering ultra religious conservative who wants to destroy Social Security &amp; Medicare. Trump is loosing and even he knows that.   Joe Biden is a conservative do nothing war-mongering noelib, but at least he's not a sociopath who's a wanna-be dictator.
Seeing Joe Biden's corpse being swallowed by the Leftist Mob should scare the shit out of every single moderate voter   But it doesn't which adds to the November fear   There probably will be a divide in the country post election
The reams of proposals reflect Biden‚Äôs belief that the nation faces immense challenges that require a far-reaching government response not seen since the New Deal.
Yes of course he is which makes him the lesser of two evils. My daughter is transgender I will not vote for anyone other than Biden in order to save my daughter from being murdered by Republicans.
Vote for Biden. He won't kill you unlike the previous tenant.
Correct...But I have to vote for Biden in order to destroy Trump Who will destroy my Trans daughter.
Biden is taking a nap and Snake Sabo can't stand you. Go back to Canada and stay there..
So is Biden going to pick a VP anytime soon or has he and he already forgot who it is?
JFC. It was...checking notes...Biden who championed the crime bill in 93 that put LARGE number of african americans in jail. Not Trump, not republicans. Floyd and Castile were actions of singular people. Not a group as a whole. Stop generalizing, it's dangerous and stupid.
Wasn't it your boy Biden who championed the crime bill in 93? Wasn't a republican. And what has Trump done specifically that has expressed that african american lives don't matter? Stop with the baseless accusations. Find something else to whine about.
And they are now starting to say this is what Biden‚Äôs America will look like, as if he is already in control and not that small handed orange toddler
I have been honest about it I'm voting for Biden. I don't like him I don't like nothing will fundamentally change I will fight him every moment that he's president I will do everything I can to make sure he never gets a second term.  Neoliberalism is evil and Trump is a sociopath
When Biden pats you on the back keep your hand on your wallet.
But, as bad as things are, if Biden wins, Trump is going to fuck things up that much worse so he can say that Biden is terrible. So, that's why we must vote for Trump, so he doesn't have to fuck things up even worse than he already has.I agree with 95% of what you're saying, but credit where credit is due the Obama administration is the one who started putting kids in cages. Trump just continued that legacy.
Sees  then gets an alert that Joe Biden has tweeted... does happy dance while logging on.... What in the name of Alexander Hamilton is this malarkey?
fuck am I gonna start overtly social media campaigning for Biden
And what Joe Biden was addressing while he was VP Senator Ron Johnson backed Biden on fighting corruption in Ukraine  Now Johnson is working with Russia to discredit Biden What does Russia have on you RON? Remember Russia hacked the RNC and Im sure is using that intel 4 blackmail
Now you're making assumptions. I'm not BLM and theyre stupid as fuck for going out like that with no mask. Stop trying to make it political. Why is everybody doing that? I hope Trump wins this election tbh because I hate Biden. Stay on topic if you're going to argue masks with me
My apologies I thought you meant we move to the right when we elected Trump. My point still stands though. Trump? Biden? It's the same guy with a different label.
1) he can do the same thing anyone with self-respect will, sit this one out. And if Biden loses, small price to pay for us to get a seat at the table. 2) That's how little I know about the man. That's on me. 3) give it a couple years
The same monster, just different colors. Like in Star wars where there's R2D2, but then in the battle scenes there's a bunch of different colored R2D2s, Joe Biden is just a blue R2D2.
He will be known as the "Killing President"  He killed people with his incompetence and lies  He's killing the environment with his policies   He's trying to kill Democracy   Stop him by voting Joe Biden
April I love your comedy but let‚Äôs do Biden sniffing and touching kids. Let‚Äôs be fair
I have a joke about Joe Biden but it... Um... I... We have to... You know... Hmm...  *Takes Alzheimer's medication*  YOU AIN'T BLACK
More focused on beating Biden than Trump..... Okie y‚Äôall ü•¥
There are 16,211,198 registered voters in Texas. So now there is 8,105,600 people willing to vote for Biden. Let‚Äôs say 35
Biden is a helluva lot closer to giving you those things you ask for than the madman in the White House. Don‚Äôt be daft!
Sean Hannity supports Joe Biden for president
Every time that ad plays with "Joe Biden" saying "yes absolutely!" to defunding the police, I cringe.  That's not his voice. Not even close. If you actually had an argument, you wouldn't have to make it up.
