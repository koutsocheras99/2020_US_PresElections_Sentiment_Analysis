Good thing the US Gov‚Äôt changes every 4 or at longest 8 years. I‚Äôll wait to hear what the Biden Administration says.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Same poll that has Biden winning!
i wonder if biden picks harris as vp and they win, would they roll out her famous solution to truancy nationwide?
Yea and Biden would have did better my ass he doesnt even know who or where he is most of time that's why the deadbeat Democrat clown party puts there lost his mind sleepy Joe Puppet in his basement so he doesnt embarrass the socialist democrat clown party which has happened!
So to recap:  -UK insists relationship with EU must be arms-length distant.. -UK-China alignment now out of the question due to C19, Huawei and HK.  -Boris can‚Äôt sell U.S. deal to public as long as Trump is POTUS, and Biden appears indifferent to the ‚Äúspecial relationship‚Äù
joe biden really needs to pick romney as his running mate, but i dont think he wants to lose such s powerful voice in the senate
TBH, Biden would at least work towards restoring US-UK relations back to pre-Trump normals.  But this does kind of throw cold water on Boris‚Äô hopes that Biden can help him sell a U.S. deal with the British public.
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúMoms for Biden Kickoff‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe  #tomsmom
Joe Biden will be sworn in on Jan 20, 2021.
Dude complains about Biden's facilities then cites... checks notes... a president who had alzheimers WHILE IN OFFICE.
You would rather Biden?
I'm not sure Joe Biden is taking oxygen!
I was a big time Warren advocate during the primary and have zero idea who any of these people are.  Warren Twitter definitely talks trash but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone (seriously) say they‚Äôre not voting for Biden.
My favorite thing about Biden is him being receptive to progressive policy.  My second favorite thing about Biden is he pays zero attention to Twitter.
A lot of people seem confused but Joe Biden won the primary and is going to do what he feels most comfortable doing.  This VP process isn‚Äôt a do-over on the primary.
The VP for Joe Biden will be "ascending" on their first day in office. Biden doesn't know where he's even at right now.   "Honey! What state are we in?"
Yeah, Biden was nothing like that as VP.
What Is¬†the Like-Kind Exchange Rule That Biden Wants Dead
A vote for Biden is a vote for Ruth Bader Ginsberg. She‚Äôs a queen it‚Äôs the least you can do, 98 days to do the right thing!! Anyone that needs help registering to vote the link is in my bio!!!
Imagine thinking Joe Biden is a part of leftism in any way. The right wing lives in a mythological universe of mass delusion.
Should we discuss the people harmed by Biden‚Äôs vote for the illegal Iraq war? Do Iraqi Lives Matter at all?
Krystal and Saagar: Did Media ACCIDENTALLY Reveal Kamala Will Be Biden's...  via
I‚Äôm starting to think Warren might have a shot, particularly because we‚Äôre seeing more evidence that she has a good personal relationship with Biden, which is part of why Carter selected Mondale.
notice how Dems are not racists, until it time to actually show they are not racist?(Joe Biden -white privileged-Warren, white privileged) Stay at Home this election, its to for Dems to show we are not blind sheep!
Every time you say you won‚Äôt vote for Biden, I‚Äôm going to register a Boomer Lib who doesn‚Äôt use Twitter to vote.
Gosh, I actually forgot until just now that if Biden wins, Jill would be our First Lady. *chef‚Äôs kiss*
It looks to me like the DNC and Joe Biden have decided to help Trump win 2020.
Whatever anyone thinks of Hillary Clinton, we wouldn‚Äôt be experiencing most of this shitshow with her as president and in charge of the executive agencies.  Trump is so fucking insane that you can make an agency-only argument for Biden.  Truly crazy times.
If this is what Biden runs with, I‚Äôll have been right all along
Still waiting on Biden‚Äôs base to throw him a boat parade.
Oh, you remember when Leftists said that working people don‚Äôt view the Democratic Party as representing them after the 2016 election?  Yeah.  Biden‚Äôs pollster got into that.  Voters are clearly seeing which party stands with corporations and which with people right now.
By the way, you can remain cynical about America while also realizing Biden is going to win.  It‚Äôs really not that hard.
I‚Äôm pretty over the presidential election - Biden is going to win because Trump is screwing up coronavirus - and back to getting into my feelings about the world.
biden needs a major colonic ...
Democrats offer no alternative. Joe Biden is just a slightly more palatable racist, sexist, greedy, scumbag. #DemExit
Holy shit, I just listened to Ted Cruz‚Äôs former communications director not only say he‚Äôs voting for Joe Biden but that every Republican who has enabled Donald Trump needs to pay come November.  ü§Ø
That's a false equivalent though.  Jill Stein and Ralph Nader were 3rd party candidates, &amp; Rand Paul is a Republican.  Bernie has always caucused with the Dems, and more importantly he has not been funded by corporations/Wall St., which HRC was in both 2008 &amp; 2016, &amp; Biden is now
Bill, they‚Äôre going to do something on health care.  It was literally the moderate message in the midterms and an issue where voters prefer Democrats.  They can also do it through reconciliation.  If Biden doesn‚Äôt try, he‚Äôll have a war on his hands.
I mean, they passed the ACA and still had the 2010 backlash so I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the right way to think about it.  Biden will face backlash with whatever he does so it will just be a question of prioritization (and the filibuster).
Let‚Äôs make the divide even bigger. Let‚Äôs increase Biden‚Äôs lead by even more and let‚Äôs deflate Trump‚Äôs ego, shall we?? #JoeBiden2020 #Biden2020 #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Interesting conversation with Biden‚Äôs chief pollster.  One interesting data point is third party voters in 2016 thought Hillary was going to win and are now incredibly motivated to get rid of Trump, despite what this dumb website would make you think.
But fewer people say the U.S. is on the right track. Plus, how we feel about the future of our jobs and the coronavirus threat. Explore the mood of the country in 8 charts.
Is Biden secretly discussing a wealth tax?  What is up with this guy?  Why is he having this weird meltdown?
If Biden wins - and wins big - it should be seen as a vindication.
I mean, to be fair, Kamala‚Äôs attack on Biden was a deeply personal one and if you‚Äôre going to hold a grudge over any attack that came from another candidate during the primary, that‚Äôs probably the one.
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt the Eisenhower you‚Äôre looking for.
Biden does not have this on the bag. You kinda sound like you think that's the case - like people did in 2016. Trump was an ass then &amp; he's an ass now. Biden has already abandoned the 50-state strategy (like Hillary.) I fear I'm seeing 2016 again, but that's just me. #vigilance
I followed Mondaire when he said he‚Äôs got Biden‚Äôs back.  Made it clear that he‚Äôs a sane progressive.  You‚Äôll go much farther in politics not trying to please the idiot socialists.
Oh I think we should hang trumps portrait right next to Obama and on the other side should be Biden.   Where ever Trump is down the road, he will hate being in between notes two.
‚ÄòWe‚Äôll Keep Asking Every Week‚Äô: Chris Wallace Says Biden ‚ÄòNot Available‚Äô For Interview.  Biden will regret it if he doesn't do an interview with Wallace  Fox News Sunday.  How can he expect votes from those folks if he won't do an interview there?
Biden isn't able to do interviews.
I promise you, Paul Ryan will not be voting for Joe Biden.
Just heard some managers who I assumed were Republicans talking about how they don‚Äôt like political signs because ‚Äúsome crazy from either side will slash your tires‚Äù and these are potential Biden voters.
I have no recollection of what my dream was about, but I woke up today with the phrase, "But Biden's beans!" repeating over and over in my head.
The USW stands with Joe Biden, not with you.
Calling it now: if/when Biden wins in November, if he wins states like North Carolina or Arizona, liberals will declare him to be the most popular presidential candidate in recent times, rather than noticing people voted for him because they despise Trump.
Ronald Klain, one of Biden‚Äôs most important advisers and someone who is receptive to smart, progressive policy and tactics, is a native Hoosier.  Just wanted to acknowledge that.  Haha.
Voters‚ÄºÔ∏èget them out of there!  Biden 2020.
Twitter would be far more interesting if Biden people were proportionately represented.  Twitter distorts everything so much that you constantly have to mentally filter what is reality and what is just Twitter.
Maybe just a gestalt Biden played by a chorus of twilighting TV stars who all have different aspects of his gropy non-entity of a personality. hat in the ring for David Shwimmer.
...the room the Constitution appears to leave for a disastrous and difficult transition if the incumbent does not accept a loss.
They‚Äôd vote for Biden if he supported M4A.
I think they should enumerate exactly what it is they expect from an Executive and see if Biden is willing to meet their terms.  He might be.  He seems reasonable.
I don‚Äôt disagree but in this instance if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden you are cutting off your nose to spite your face. A non- Biden vote is a de facto Trump vote. Basic linear math. It isn‚Äôt philosophical or complicated.
Just had a very sad exchange with ‚ÄúProgressives‚Äù who won‚Äôt vote for Biden because he‚Äôs too right wing for them. While I can‚Äôt disagree ... how ducking stupid and short-sighted do you need to be? They say ‚ÄúBiden loses nothing‚Äù if they vote Green. Erm - did anyone take Math class!!
It‚Äôs simple mathematics, sir. It IS a zero sum game. I agree with you but vote for Biden. We can move left from there. If Trump wins, progressives are DONE for 50+ years. Sometimes you have to play the short game. Respectfully.
I left.  I did a year and I‚Äôm pretty confident Biden is going to win.
I pray justice will be served. Obama, Biden and Hillary are not above the law!
Gee, too bad Bill Barr is in Biden's pocket, or he'd prosecute...someone
More like 96% of Republicans are laughing at you and will be voting BIDEN 2020‚ÄºÔ∏è
I am extremely depressed and I hope Biden winning helps but all these bad things will still be there and people don‚Äôt seem serious about building a stable majority to defeat them but maybe I‚Äôm just on Twitter too much.
Joe Biden is the Jet Forward system that‚Äôs supposed to be the non-evil alternative to the EVAs that immediately malfunctions and explodes
2020 is not 2016.  We have data that shows people‚Äôs fears of coronavirus are swinging voters towards Biden.  America is, at the very least, a temperamentally moderate country.  It‚Äôs quite possible Biden wins in a landslide.
Fascinating and not surprising.
Republicans are going to be undermined in their anti-China and ‚ÄúDemocrats love Communists‚Äù message by Donald Trump and Joe Biden actually discussing their positions on China.  Haha.  I mean, seriously?  Xi is probably on a phone call flattering Trump right now.
Why do people continue to make the argument for Elizabeth Warren on electoral grounds when Joe Biden is up by 9 points nationally?  If you‚Äôre going to make the argument, make it on policy and governing grounds.
Said NO ONE, EVER! HRC was way to confident &amp; believed to much into the polls. If you‚Äôre gonna beat Trump, Biden &amp; his voters need to treat 2020 like he‚Äôs down in the polls. I don‚Äôt care what polls say, you gotta treat them like you‚Äôre down 9 pts not up 9 pts. #Biden2020
Biden won‚Äôt speak. He‚Äôs a babbling mess.
When President Biden tells me it‚Äôs safe.
Yeah lol wtf is this ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs America‚Äù shit? This is TRUMP‚ÄôS America NOW.
Me: There‚Äôs no way Biden wins Florida.  Trump: LET FLORIDA DIE  Me: I didn‚Äôt realize he was that much of a sociopath!
There‚Äôs no way this is accurate BUT there‚Äôs data showing that people who fear they might become infected with coronavirus are swinging to Biden and it‚Äôs quite possible that partially explains this.
Biden looked so happy in his most recent meeting with Obama.   You can really tell that he admires and respects Obama deeply.

Joe Biden showed awful judgement by putting Chris Dodd in charge of anything.   Unforced error.
No way asshole.
Joe Biden on Wednesday excoriated Trump for promoting on Twitter the dubious claims of Dr. Stella Immanuel, the Houston doctor who‚Äôs claimed to have effectively treated hundreds of COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine.
Biden‚Äôs speech getting worse by the day. He‚Äôs mostly unintelligible any more.
This isn‚Äôt the first report.  By selecting Dodd, Biden basically gave a green light for neoliberals to trash hopefuls they view as too progressive.
To be fair, Biden calls himself The Gaffe Machine. I will be gladly voting for Joe, but the transcript of the debates should be both hilarious and humiliating for all Americans.
yeah and he was leading slightly in the SC polls. but just before the primary, other candidates voters kind of coalesced around Biden in a big way and then when they dropped out the night before super tuesday, I knew it was all over.
I really hope Biden chooses Kamala. Have fun trying to convince all of the criminal justice reform protestors to vote for the author of the crime bill and a cop who withheld exonerating evidence vs. the president who signed the First Step Act into law
Joe Biden may not be anywhere near great, but don't you dare equate him with Trump. There's zero comparison.
I think the gubernatorial map is way too D friendly. Obama and Trump saw big losses in their midterms, not sure why you think a Biden presidency would help democratic governors in a midterm
Strong words. You really took it to him.  You also challenged Obama/Biden's response to Swine Flu and Ebola. Sure, not the exact same virus, but the point is, the response was successful.

Bernie never went on the offense against Biden. also Democratic Party primary voters are far more right wing than most realize, even if the american public as a whole might agree with Bernie more.
Just a reminder: not voting is just that, not voting. Not a vote for Trump, not a vote for Biden, you‚Äôre not participating.
Yes. Biden shouldnot waste his time in a debate with Trump!
Why are you retweeting Joe Biden's slogan?
The real president, Joe Biden, appeared and honored his friend.
We seriously wouldn't have a problem right now if Biden and Ron Klain were running the show.
Voters give Biden higher marks on many positive traits that apply to leadership in the age of the coronavirus, including honesty, capability and caring for Americans.
at least Biden campaign HASN'T MURDERED 150,000 Americans &amp; counting-including many Hispanics-as Trump /GOP has gladly done. #maga
We are the laughing stock of the world. He sets his own country on fire. He will burn it to the ground to save his own ass. This Republican is voting Biden.
Montana and the modern CO-3 are very similar in how they vote at the house and presidential level. Biden would absolutely carry both here imo
So is this a 15-20 point Biden win? Cause if so no way Trump is carrying Montana
also why does it matter what he sees in LA since CA will obviously go to Biden lol
Hard lesson learned; get those swing states that control the electoral college! Biden in 2020 in a Blue Tsunami.ü§óü§ó
in the event Biden doesnt win, Canuck, can I please, please rent out your basement? Hell, I'd rent your dumpster- how far does your router broadcast?
Posting on Twitter doesnt mean squat! if Biden raped her as she claims &amp; really wants justice then she should sue him in civil court just as many women have. She isnt now why is that? Is she afraid of discovery? absolutely no evidence &amp; shes being used by GOP? what's UPUR EXCUSE
And losing to Biden!

Well, he isn‚Äôt a white supremest, so that basically de facto puts him in the Biden camp with the rest of us (and by us, I don‚Äôt mean you).
Guiliani and cohorts (GOP'ers) are digging a hole they think Biden will step into and hurt his campaign but are actually creating a pile of evidence against themselves. Their Ukrainian helpers will turn on them like a croc turns it's victims over and over.

5. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúdisasterous‚Äù plan for the suburbs is to provide affordable housing while trump‚Äôs is  *checks notes* Sending 100s of troops to patrol the streets and teargas your mayor #Portland
2. This is Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúraw power grab masquerading as racial justice.‚Äù  Ps research shows that providing affordable housing for populations at risk of criminal involvement, such as chronically homeless and formerly incarcerated individuals, reduces the chance of future incarceration
Sir, the very unfair media keeps complaining that the troops defending our Federal buildings are unidentified. You should give them all a patch identifying them as Trump Troopers. Biden's got nothing like that.
But Biden will go double hard on China right ? After all 2020 and how can america stay without an enemy target ?

While Biden hides in a fucking basement doing nothing!! Like the last administration did so much for black lives!!
I don't see much language about lesser evil or greater good among Trump folks. Trump is an absolute good and the Dems an absolute evil. There is no anguish or worrying about doing the less harm, there is enthusiasm on the whole. Hoping Biden picks up folks on the margins
Of course I think Marxism means the textbook definition, not anybody who happens to be left of center from Bernie to Biden.
Our ecumenical mainline campus ministry is able to hold Trump and Biden supporters and everyone in between, but i think the lines are not so hard with young adults
Biden is just a face and a name. Democrats, wake up! Nothing he says matters. His handlers will run everything! What do they want?
There are a large portion of people who dislike Biden and Trump pretty equally.
Even if he never endorsed Biden he'd be problematic enough on his own.
Meaning at first it‚Äôll look as if he‚Äôs in the lead, then as the mail in ballots are added if Biden pulls ahead he‚Äôll claim voter fraud. He‚Äôll contest it until there‚Äôs a full ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù and claim the election was rigged. Just my opinion, of course.
Obama left the trump administration all set up to confront a pandemic. trump and team totally dismantled what Obama and Biden worked so hard on to prepare for the incoming administration. Barr is a bald faced liar and he and trump need to quit blaming Obama for their ineptness.

As the ethers showed me at the top of Jan. 2020, what was once gonna be a Biden-Warren ticket also had the chance to swing Harris. He‚Äôll use ALL great plans from Warren, Bernie, Mang, and credit them all üëç We‚Äôll see what happens! Let been looking like Biden-Harris for awhile now
Poll 1: How enthusiastic are you about voting for Joe Biden? (1 = not at all, 10 = extremely)
I think that was Biden‚Äôs original plan. I think he‚Äôs been wavering between Kamala Harris and Tammy Duckworth at the point, and I think it may go to Harris though she‚Äôd make a GREAT Attorney General. I do believe he will and adopt great policies from many people and credit them.
Someone is actually excited enough for Biden to put up a sign?
I was previously unaware that votes, once cast, transform into votes for the "other guy" I'm here to announce that my vote will apparently go to Biden then since I'm not voting for Trump either. Blue no matter who's should now be satisfied, if that's really how it works.
So if I don't vote for Biden it's a vote for Trump. But.... If I don't vote for Trump isn't that a vote for Biden. Just asking because it's what the Republicans claim.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS LYING TO YOUR FACE ... AGAIN.
If Biden can do 2 push-ups,he is the next president of the United States. Trump would cheat on the first one.
We are in a state that says you‚Äôre radical left or far right... our president calls Biden radical left. He‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs center left. We need to close the gaps on far left and far right and not just focus on the presidents fear dialogue to win his election.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

And before you all jump on Joe Biden's bandwagon remember, he and Obama are the reason there is a President Trump. never was there worse leadership in this country or in the world than the one that lead from behind.
Do people care who Biden's vp Is? Because I don't.
I guess with his declining memory he's forgotten who's hand he was holding just a few years ago. He also has forgotten that President Trump has done more for blacks than Biden has done in his 44 years in congress! He's the racist! #Trump2020 #walkaway
