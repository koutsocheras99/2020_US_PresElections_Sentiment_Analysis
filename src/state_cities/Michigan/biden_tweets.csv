when Biden or the Media say that u didn’t take things serious during the 1st few months I were listening to your experts who were getting flawed data from China and WHO - when u discovered that data was a lie u acted accordingly
Joe Biden doesn't act like he knows more than the health experts. Trump ignores the health experts which causes confusion. We need a president who doesn't think he's "a natural". #COVID19 #Coronavirus #JoeBiden #TrumpHoaxedAmerica
Detroit is Riding With Biden!
Fat Drunk and Liberal is no Way to run a State.   Prediction: when Biden announces his VP pick (not Whitmer) she will open everything up.   She is a Vindictive Hyperpartisan.   Top 5 Worst Governor.
I have to give it to the Biden campaign, every few days i start to slowly talk myself into maybe considering giving some thought to possibly voting for him they do or announce some new thing that returns me to the correct path
So you rail on Biden's morality but then decide Trumps morality doesn't matter  #HYPOCRITE  #CNN
If you think Biden is as bad as Trump &amp; Decide Not To vote, then Trumps Brainwashing is working.  SMH
Let's keep our footing on solid ground. Biden is not perfect, probably no white person is when it comes to representing blacks. However, Biden is much better than Trump.
Buttigieg needs to be in the Biden Administration. Maybe Chasten too in place of DeVos!    #VoteTrumpOut
Trump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible'
‘Shameful’: Biden slams Trump for saying he would ‘hurt God’ if elected
No truth in Donalds world. I hope Joe Bidens lawyers sue Donald for defamation of character &amp; harassment. #SueTrump  #VoteJoeBiden2020 #VoteJoeBidenToSaveAmerica    Trump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible' | TheHill
Donald 🤡 will say anything to draw attention away from the virus. Joe Biden is a devout catholic who has never held a bible up for a photo op. #VoteTrumpOut   Trump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible' | TheHill
No. That’s what Biden is saying.
I believe that Rep. Dingell, like her late husband DOES care. Joe Biden? Not so sure about that.
Rice for VP. Yates for AG. Perfect. Wow. Biden will have a winning administration 🇺🇸🇺🇸#BidenVP
ask  +  to Debate over the 2 hours - Sean moderates one than Laura others or do it jointly. Format -Trump answers than Biden is on video screen answers in his own Primary words to same question. Do it before first Votes
What Biden said was moronic. And yet all you can do is attack someone else. Just typical fascist behavior by today’s left. I can easily admit trump is wrong about many things. Why can’t you just admit Biden is an idiot??
AOC better speak so she can urge young people who supported Bernie, to get out and vote for Biden!
Right there with you, Denise.. Susan would reestablish US lost stature on the world stage. 🇺🇸#VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #Biden2020 #Biden #vote
Maybe she gets the state of mind Biden is in - country before party.
I didn’t know Biden was so powerful.
Then you’re not voting for Biden. Spare me.
The most comical part about Trump attacking Biden on his religion is the fact that the attacks are coming from a thrice married philandering thief who raped his first wife and laughed about a man bleeding out on the floor.
That Biden add really doesn’t use the language of the working class! Disgusting!   btw u need to read Hegel and Marx and Engels and Lenin and Hoxha and Mao and
Biden is the Saint of Killers CONFIRMED
45's statement is therefore coherent in a sense.  Since he believes the world revolves around him, believing himself to be god, Biden is, by definition, against god.
You really think a trump voter would vote for biden? Yikes
Vote Kamala Harris. Not Susan Rice she is tied too much to Benghazi even if not true it could cause Biden to lose the election
Every time I see this person tweet I think it’s a secret Biden superpac
Biden the Gaffe Machine
Biden should start his convention acceptance speech with a prayer. Send moderate Christians in a SPIRAL.
back to my comment on your latest column and not voting for Biden. You would be willing to put with this.
So you are uncomfortable with the direction Trump has/is taking the country yet you will write someone in instead of voting for Biden? You might as well vote for Trump, by noting voting for Biden you are giving the edge to the status quo
“No guns, no police and no grocery stores! In Biden’s America you will have to grow your own non-GMO/organic food. Plus no more free air. He will tax that like no one has ever taxed air before. Believe me!”
come on Bro. That is straight up Racist.   Why covering for Biden when it is so so so obvious?
Trump said Biden is going to take away God and guns....good! That’s one of many reasons why I’m voting for him.
Damn, Biden sounds incredible. He can hurt GOD?
But will you help get him out by voting for Biden? Actually it’s not anyone’s business how people vote. I guess people want to know if you’ll be part of the solution or part of the problem.
So is Joe Biden gonna be part of the same strike team that plans on attacking and dethroning God or is he going to hurt God after the attacking and dethroning?
All good questions. I also heard that people didn't fill it out because Trump or Biden wasn't on it. Lots of voters are in the habit of ignoring primaries or misunderstanding them.
Yes. Detroit area. Some big ones, too. Mostly homemade.   The Biden people need to be giving away signs. NOW
“The Biden campaign surge in fundraising the past couple of months has helped it narrow the Trump campaign’s once-massive cash on hand advantage.”  Could have just thanked Black Lives Matter donations instead of general “Grassroots donors”, Joe.   I wish that $$ went to the ppl!
They are both nearly equally terrible, obviously Trump is worse for human rights. But they're both pedos and in Trumps case a definite rapist. Biden could be as well we just don't know yet. And Biden is a huge unknown, he could be worse than we even imagined if he wins.
Yeah, I totally get that get that. And Trump is definitely a worse person than Biden, my tweet was mostly just referring to the fact that IF we had Trump another 4 years at least we'd be done with him after that.
That's not how I feel, I was just making a statement. I definitely don't prefer Trump to Biden.............. And I wasn't 100% serious about the Bernie tweet. It's Twitter.......  I really have no idea what to do so don't judge based on two tweets.
criminal and so unethical  ask Biden why was this allowed under your admin  and Planned Parenthood won't return monies from Govt - refusing - what is Biden's position
Biden may not be the swiftest, but THIS guy should not make this election about mental acuity. Yikes.
Joe Biden's VP committee includes this guy and Chris Dodd, so there's that.
If you get the panel I would absolutely do a Jews for Biden panel discussion/fundraiser: “A shonda: my name and what I’m doing about it”
Susan Rice. Another great reason she’d be the perfect VP for Joe Biden. 🇺🇸 #SusanRice #BidenRice #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #ricktyler
Doesn't matter.  We should be debating the issues and beat him on that plus the great things that Trump has accomplished and can be reversed if Biden wins.
Republican operatives are pushing for Kanye to keep going so more votes are taken away from Biden. WAKE TF UP PEOPLE!!!!!!
We will on Nov 3rd when Biden is elected
problem described here isn’t minority rule. The problem is that one branch has become the All Powerful Oz.  Also, of course Trump shouldn’t care about the national vote. Neither should Biden. Had Hillary won it would’ve been minority rule too, just less spaced out geographically
You realize that this virus came from China not Mar-A-Lago or Trump towers... Your stupidity is not going to get Biden elected.
No accusations?  The intent of your posts is clearly to lead the reader to conclude Trump is a Pedo.  &amp; don’t put words into my mouth.  Never called Biden a pedo.  I said there is more basis in that one video to conclude Biden is a pedo than you guys have to say the same of Trump
That’s cool as long as you vote Biden!  Personally, I’ve always liked Sally Yates.
Harris is so charming. She’s also smarter than Biden
I love Corvettes. It is an American marvel and Joe Biden ain’t bad either.
For further proof of just how on-brand this is, look at how many Joe Biden + Corvette stories there are on
In 2016 Trump running opposed got about 480,000 votes Joe Biden, even with people still voting for Bernie Sanders who got 500,000 votes, just got over 800,000.
Disappointed Biden uses the term "junkie." By telling people struggling with addiction that they're garbage we prevent so many from getting help and we obstruct badly needed policy changes. We need to look at addiction as a health crisis, not a personal failing. Do better, man.
Their confidence that Kanye will take more Black voters from Biden than likes-voting-for-weird-celebrities voters from Trump is probably unfounded.
If Joe Biden were president, we wouldn't have to pay Elon Musk and Russia to take us to space.
One more thing and then this is over.  There is more basis to claim Biden is a pedo in this vid than everything you and your Trump is a pedo cohorts have come up with in these tweets.
As a Democrat we’re all worried about Biden. I voted for Bernie, but now Biden is gonna have to do. But the fact is, Trump is the worst we’ve ever had. It’s not just hyperbole when you hear someone say that “anyone is better than Trump”. That’s a fact.
Oh lord well then it’s a good thing Hunter Biden has never, in any way, held a government job.
If we’re being real, fuck Biden, but at least he’s not the “it is what it is” guy.
Saw your interview on Axios! AKA: Joe Biden’s next campaign ad.
Thank you, sir. 🇺🇸#biden #JoeBiden
That's Biden who doesn't know where he is.
But isn’t Biden going to be the nominee?  Doesn’t the public deserve to see him asked questions since he’ll be on the Presidential ballot?
Elizabeth Warren deserves to be Biden’s pick for VP. Period. 🇺🇸 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #elizabethwarren #DNC
Yeah his staff has to make all the announcements Biden can't keep things straight. This is probably why the positive covid-19 cases are on the rise in Texas. They are feeding America false statistical data to try to influence the voters in the state of Texas.
Honestly people love to claim Biden has dementia, but ignore Trump’s  complete lack of ability to form a cohesive thought, understand graphs or statistics at a 2nd grade level (see: axios interview) or even pronounce Yosemite correctly. Disclaimer: I’m also not a fan of Biden
Joe Biden has embraced the policies of the far-Left  Joe Biden will RAISE your taxes  Joe Biden will grant amnesty to 11 MILLION illegal immigrants  And, Joe Biden will KILL American jobs
Hurry, put him on the same anti-senile medication that joe Biden’s taken.
lol Biden only gives a fuck about money. Thinking he wouldn't make the same choices as Trump is delusional. And I said I'd ALMOST rather, because then he couldn't come back after the next 4 years are over. Again, let me explain before jumping to conclusions.
And you think Biden would be a better choice for any of that than Trump? I don't. The way I see it, our next president is going to fuck everything up no matter what. I think you misinterpreted my stance because Twitter doesn't really allow for me to fully elaborate on my view.
Can we get to the part where Biden wakes up in the shower and the entire Democratic Primary season was his dream?
So that's where Joe Biden is hanging out.
Everyone wonders who will be running the govt if Biden should -god forbid-win. If Susan Rice is VP, seems likely Obama will be pulling the strings. She was his go-to liar when needed. Heck, I always felt she acted like she had a crush on him-she'd do anything for BO!
Then-VP Joe Biden wrote a letter to an anonymous rape victim whose victim statement had gone viral for its eloquence. There was no reason to believe that she would later shed her anonymity and share this information.
All I’m hearing about is Trump or Biden blah blah blah. The only candidate that matters is sex man. Sex man for mayor bitches #kickinitoldschool
Me watching my friend in Italy’s insta stories (depicting a totally back-to-normal life and super fun summer) each day.   Please volunteer for Joe Biden.
Why would an endorsement signal a lack of trust?  Ridiculous.  You imagine postal workers will open mail, throw out Trump votes...and reseal and "count" Biden votes??
Something needs to be done and NOW. Trump appointed post master general and they are hatching a devious plant to deny o/t, have layoffs thus slowing down and/or invalidate the election thru mail-in ballots. This is all over YouTube and Dems doing nothing-no Biden ads, no action.
yes and then play back Biden's own words that he used during the Primary -    should do this anyways - if Pres wants additional debates
So Cher when are you going to be going to Washington to be in President elect Joe Biden's Cabinet. I'm sure he can put in one of the cabinet seats.
biden doesn't need attack ads just air that interview
Someone in Biden's camp has mapped out a great campaign. Simply let Trump hang himself.
36 years old, never voted. I hate  so much that I registered to vote and will be voting for Biden, simply to help get this dangerous, racist, sexist, idiotic MORON out of office. I can't belive my government would let the American people down the way they have.
Trump’s ratings will be high when they announce how bad he loses to Joe Biden!
Honestly at this point, Biden is just as bad. I'd almost rather have Trump another 4 years then be done with his ass, then hopefully Biden doesn't try to run again. Jorgenson sucks ass too. We're just fucked no matter what.
If Biden rolled into the White House in a wheelchair and fell asleep for 8 years he still wouldn't do as much damage as Trump has done in 4 years.
The real magic of this hell map is Biden getting a PA call early on and cable shows spending 3 hours talking about it being over, "especially if AZ is as a close as it appears"
No leadership by Trump caused this. Vote for Joe Biden!
Yes indeed! Michigan vote for Joe Biden!
If you want to be optimistic, this map is also the funny President Biden, Vice President Pence map
Think what ya want but if u have the chance please dont let ur children around Biden.
Please read this!
Have seen more signs for Joe Biden than I ever did for Hillary Clinton and it's still very few.   The Biden campaign should be giving out yard signs everywhere. It's heartening and encouraging to see other Blue voters putting it out there.   That is what creates enthusiasm.
Jason, you said it! Biden 2020. 🇺🇸 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Keep them coming and focus on the Task Force plans from Bernie/Biden teams and emphasize Biden plans to have govt control everything and zoning of suburbs
Do more Townhalls, do video debates with yourself and than a video screen where Biden responds as he did through the Primary to questions
Thanks +rest of Media especially biased Wallace/Neil/Bret - who were MIA w the Huge Scandal of a pattern of Spying by Obamagate,O/Biden for 8 yrs - spied on Merkel, spied on All Americans/Clapper lied about it; spied on AP, Rosen/Family so whey surprised he spied on Oppo campaign
Watch “Rashida Tlaib Refuses To Endorse Joe Biden” on YouTube
... bold prediction (perhaps woefully wrong) perhaps extremely hopeful- Michelle Obama is gonna be the Democratic ace in the hole and announced as Biden’s pick for VP to energize the ticket, and base at the Dem convention in 15 days. I know it’s wishful thinking, but it’s 2020.
I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my mom in March. I know Joe Biden is utterly incapable of managing any crisis, so he will have subordinates standing in. Which doctors would he rely on? Should he rely on the WHO? They are complicit in the world pandemic.
If either of them are Biden’s  VP, Trump will be re-elected
Ultimately this is why “looking forward and not back” was the biggest mistake of the Obama era. The Biden era must be different.
Rather biden that crying baby Donald
Pathetic this includes CNN lite  and  Wallace missed this + missed the huge scandals of Obama/Biden pattern of spying throughout 8 yrs w the Scandal of spying on Oppo party Wallace Bret read   articles&gt; thanks to
That is because the Democrat/Marxist party's only hope of winning the election is to make sure that business remains destroyed - caused by COVID-19. And to make the public believe it is all  fault. No amount of Monday morning quarterbacking will save China Joe Biden.
And you think any of your agenda can happen without Joe Biden? You are wrong. You are dangerous and You are further risking our climate, our democracy and our freedoms in America. I cannot believe the vile messages you spew!
Watch “Trump: Joe Biden’s A Secret Radical Leftist…” on YouTube 😂🤣😭. I wish
The way things are going in Minneapolis, Biden Might win in North Carolina and lose in Minnesota. The people who are happiest with his support of BLM are those who don't get to see BLM.
Nope. Too full of herself. Couldn’t possibly adjust to a number two spot.  #Biden
Get Howard Dean back as Chairman of the DNC. I’ve asking for months. He is a tough guy and a true leader. 🇺🇸 #DNC #biden
“Trump is terrible but he controls women’s bodies so I prefer him to Biden”
I’m sorry but I’ve learned as a once pro life Catholic that Donald Trump’s pro life movement really is about controlling women and people overall. I’m sorry but I’ll be voting for Mr. Biden.
Biden wants to raise my taxes and have us pay more at the pump and destroy manufacturing jobs. Raise the crime rate and flood the country with foreign immigrants. I.E. Cheap labor. Why would anyone vote for him?
Ofcourse, their goal is the entire destruction of the U.S.A.'s Laws, foundation, borders, and religion with Biden as the pupit dictator until replaced. Voter fraud will be a tool used by these Marxist, and covered up by the media.
2/3 AG Barr/Durham must interview Obama, Biden etc and indict both of them as well as Hillary- by the way what did Donna B/Harf/GTurner know about it - ask them on air and others that are Contributors on Fox that worked for O/B admin
Obama/Biden's admin was known for, during 8 years, Spying! First Clapper lied to Congress where we found out O/B were spying on all Americans; spied on AP, Rosen/Family; Spied on Congressional Committees; spied on Germany's Merkel - had to apologize; 1/2
More people need to abstain from voting, especially in this upcoming election. Voting is a system that supports mob rule and it doesn’t matter if you vote for Trump or Biden. Both of them are evil old men trying to take our rights away.
I don’t agree with you on this Tim. First of all Joe Biden would have never thought of doing such a nasty thing, let alone approve it. Democrats have been above board in their dealings with the electorate, they have compassion and they know they work for “the people of the USA.”
We are taking our party back and clearing the streets of the liberal scum. Dont you worry. We will get back to normal when the biden cult morons are out of the race. Theyre almost as stupid as the bernie cult. Almost...
My mom and sister are die hard Republicans, it was great to hear them say trump was an ass and the worst president. They will not vote for him!  They said the didn't like Biden but he is the better choice of the two. I am smiling! :-)
#KamalaHarrisForVP  I agree. She has the "it factor" that the ticket needs. Smart, funny, likeable. If we learned anything from 2016, women are held to a much higher standard (or Hillary would be President).
How about Biden?
The thing that really matters is you will have disappeared behind prison walls if Biden is President. #ByeDon2020 #TrumpForPrison2020
Joe Biden is a puppet as Hillary Clinton would have been had TRUMP not DEFEATED her. Do not fear my friends TRUMP will WIN WIN WIN 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Andrew, I’m sure Joe Biden is proud to have his bumper sticker on an iconic Mustang 🇺🇸#Biden2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
It was kinda hard for me to understand what he was saying. Thats because I don't speak dog. But I got what he was saying. I asked Scooby if he would vote for Trump in November. He said this. GRR GRRR GRR GRRR WOOF WOOF GRR GRRR. So I took that as a big NO. He's voting for Biden.
Kamala Harris would destroy any faith I have in Biden
Biden can be voted out. Trump isn't capable of handling the Crises's we are in. He is too inexperienced, it's just a fact. He has created more divide in this country than I've seen In my lifetime. When I see someone with so much drama surrounding them, they aren't a victim. 1/
please send to AG Barr and Durham Obama must be interviewed and Biden, Comey, Brennan, Clapper +so many others like Strozk/Page/McCabe all should be indicted just from the released docs that we now have
Agree completely. Biden will choose a fab cabinet from the VP on down. No doubt about it. 🇺🇸 #Biden2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #Vets4Biden
Hell, we aren’t safe in Trump’s America either. I’ll take my chances with Biden.
Joy I’m loving the idea of President Pelosi if Donald mess up the election. I think he would rather Biden win. 🤣🤣
Frump is a sorry excuse for a Commander in Chief! We need Joe Biden to lead our Country back to prosperity. 🇺🇲👍🏾🌊🌊
I’m getting so many texts from both parties (which is what happens when you’ve voted Republican AND Democrat over the course of nearly 20 some years). I wish “please stop texting me” worked. Trump’s party is very demanding via text. Biden’s side is more pleading, but polite.
Biden is a way better person than tRump will ever be so get over it. He’s a born looser!!!
No, it's just leaked to get your exact reaction. Let's just be cool and wait for the decision. Obama didn't choose Biden until mid-August.
It’s going to be Nikki Haley. Trump’s campaign is circling the bowl and he’ll figure that selecting a woman of color will neutralize Biden’s advantage with women and minorities. Trump doesn’t need Pence, anyway. Trump already has the racist religious bigot vote locked up.
Ironically texting everyone 👍after Biden on that livestream has inevitably led to just doing it
Check Biden’s website for detailed proposals. Have you heard any plans from Agent Orange about what he plans to do with his second term?
What are the chances that  squeals on #NobodyLikesTrump before dersh gets sent to jail and subsequently Epsteined?
They just figured out that saying Biden was the president of antifa wasn’t gonna do it
Biden might actually win.
Sorry. I guess I'm just used to people slamming Biden being Trump supporters. I can't defend everything Biden says, but right now, he's the lesser of two evils.
Nonsense. Biden wins it’s over.
To those who keep bringing up Biden's gaffes as a defense: Joe could say he comes from the planet Blobbo where the currency is peeled grapes and everyone rides around on space capybaras and I'll STILL vote for him. Just like you'll defend whatever batshit insane thing Trump says.
So when I see an ad that says you're doing a good job I should think about the lower drug prices we'll get under President Joe Biden? Sure thing!
What's sad is that people support Trump at all. Say what you want about Biden, Trump is 100x worse.
Bernie is actually on record saying that “if Joe Biden wins the election, he will be the most progressive president we’ve ever had”.
Sorry, but Trump has to go. Historically I'm a 3rd party voter, but not this time. I cannot stand by and watch my country get destroyed at such a ridiculously rapid pace. When Biden get's in, we can work together to pressure him for change. Trump pays attention to nobody.
2/3 Obama Biden Holder spied on the Press; has to apologize to Germany/Merkel - MSM had Obama Biden adm spying throughout 8 yrs - O/B historical view is a PATTERN OF SPYING and violating The Constitution + working to overthrow Israeli PM
why is anyone surprised that Obama Biden spied in an Oppo party and Presidency of  - their entire 8 years was shown to be at its core spying eg c Clapper lied to America via Congress re Spying on All Americans; AP, Rosen/family; Congressional Committees; Merkel1/3
Stop being dramatic, every single poll I've seen shows a majority of Bernie supporters voting for Biden.
Many people did what you propose in 2016, look at what we got. Now is not the time to waste a vote on someone who can’t possibly win. This really is a 2 man race. We need our country to heal. While Biden may not be perfect, he’ll at least respect the constitution.
Less than 100 days to vote for Joe Biden #WeWillVote
No worries. I will drop my vote by mail ballot off at my local clerk’s drop box to make sure my vote for Biden is counted.
I can see this coming Nov 4th!  Trump declares he is still acting president forcing his rule even  after losing to Biden.   Trump will declare Biden’s presidency as illegitimate and urge new elections!!! Country will fray at the seams.  Who agrees?
And Biden didn’t?
Swing state no more, Michigan is voting for Joe Biden! Ride the blue wave home.🌊🌊🌊🇺🇲✊🏾💪🏾🙏🏾
Sir, You need to be Secretary of State under Biden. #Biden2020 #Election2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

Would love to read an interview with a voter who's still sitting on the fence at this point and hinging his or her vote on Biden's VP pick.
Proud Detroit Suburbanite for Biden. Also, not afraid of low-income housing destroying my “American Dream” #SuburbsForBiden #detroitwillbreathe #detroitworksharder
Watching television in #Michigan just got a whole lot better
No it's the Democrats whose base is dwindling. Democrats see all of this senseless violence on TV and are afraid of it. If Biden somehow cheats his way into the White House the police will be eliminated, taxes will rise and unemployment will skyrocket.
It's funny how you Democrats never talk about Biden and what he plans to do. I guess he hasn't been told yet by the DNC?
Elizabeth Warren attacked Biden over his politics as well but I don’t see people yelling about how she’s too ambitious and will only use him to become president. Why is that, exactly? Did she do it the right way or something?
For the record, Elizabeth Warren directly attacked Biden about his politics but I don’t see a bunch of his allies saying she’s potentially going to backstab him  It’s almost like a bunch of white people are mad about a black woman who doesn’t just settle for being the help
It was a bill Obama and Biden had in place that Trump ended and has resurfaced. I agree with the latter.   Just providing context.
They take him around like they just picked him up from the COVID senior citizen home #Biden #elderlycare #Pedowood #election
Last I checked, Obama and Biden bombed seven countries, invaded Libya illegally and furthered wars in many places. It’s time to bring everyone home and end the incessant wars. The 90s called. They want your unnecessary fear of the Russian boogeyman back.
Don’t stop for one minute. Work for Biden like he is 10 points down. We have to bury the orange menace.
Way more Biden ads over the last week in MI. When you take 45 plus days to address an emergency (dam breaks), you’re going to lose support. I bang remember the last time I saw a trump lawn sign unlike Biden signs on every other block.
Can we all agree that the creators of this piece didn’t have a background heavy in American history? 🇺🇸##TrumpIsACompleteFailure #americanhistory #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #bidenRestoration PAC is still showing the  ad from 1987. When we all watch the idiot feast of the Bonespurs  interview, the Yo-semite I wonder ‘why’. Is this ALL they come up w/? Going after Biden’s mentality not a good track
When are Biden's handlers going to finally pick his running mate for him?
I’m fully convinced Joe Biden is DEFINITELY NOT in charge of this account
and we know Biden would never do it, he has too much class
Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working against Biden
I have to give it to the Biden campaign, every few days i start to slowly talk myself into maybe considering giving some thought to possibly voting for him they do or announce some new thing that returns me to the correct path
Shame on Jill Biden who want to be the First Lady, but doesn't love her husband enough to protect him and her reputation. This is despicable to me.
Biden has no toilet in the basement. He ran out of TP forcing him to go in the backyard! His handlers counted 14 brown or yellow spots in the grass. C’mon man you using coke too? I’m not CRAZY
WHO do they think will opt to vote for Kanye over Biden?
Let's keep our footing on solid ground. Biden is not perfect, probably no white person is when it comes to representing blacks. However, Biden is much better than Trump.

One could make the argument that, like Lincoln, VP Biden has managed this fine line as well.

Its simple if Biden were to actually do the work to earn our voted show leftists that he supports and plans to push/ fight for progressive policies not pander and show that he does want to move left shit would be different he would get those voters.
87% of Democrats Support 'Medicare for All,' Though Joe Biden Doesn't
Whoever you are, you are just speaking for a puppet, Joe Biden, No One believes it is really him!!!
These people could easily not do the work for Biden make demands instead fight the DNC call them the fuck out and call Biden the fuck and not make themselves look clownish but nope.
Im sorry but I am kind of in shock seeing these people who are like the voices of the progressive movement just go along with Biden and the DNC.
Seeing all these progressives just going along with this Biden isn’t it but we just gotta do it in order to get Trump where the fuck is the fight in that where are the demands you all are just falling in line and giving Biden a pass you all aren’t even holding his feet to the 🔥
Saying that we must vote for Biden all while he continues to reject progressive policies and then say this shit this gives us a sense of false hope say you do fall in line and vote for Biden he is just magically going to move to the left after he has rejected the left.
Nah fuck that shit I reject Biden.
The article should be called a left wing group falls in line and does the work for Biden.  Like seriously how can anybody be progressive and go along with this shit.
Biden can’t enunciate ‘mental fitness’, so there’s that.
I love “THIGH FOOD” don’t you? I usually order it when I go to Yo-Semite 🤣🤣🤣🤣 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ Idiot &amp; he &amp; his cult base have nerve talking shit about Joe Biden please
the Catholic hates GOD ok while  gasses people for a photo-op to hold the Bible upside down in front of a church &amp; can’t even recite one psalm or state what his favorite scripture from the Bible is 🤔 U ConMan are against GOD  NOT BIDEN
I don’t like calling people stupid, but the VP is just ONE cabinet position. It’s important yes, but any person choosing a Trump cabinet over a Biden cabinet is a straight up idiot and, at the very least imo, a fascist enabler.
I honesty don't think Biden meant any harm.  He just doesn't know what he's doing anymore...and that's not meant to be a knock on him.  Unfortunately it happens to many of us as we get up there in age.
Kanye West is a sellout and a disgrace of a black man if he allows Trump to prostitute him to steer democratic votes from Joe Biden.  A black man who tries to sabotage black progress is an Uncle Tom, and any black person that votes for him is a fool.
Actually  im disappointed that a Christian like yourself would resort to name calling, “Hidin Biden” ? Is that what you tell your children to do , make fun of others &amp; call them names ?
Wow more reasons why Biden isn’t it 👏 he does not deserve our vote 👏Cada dia veo las noticias de Biden y cada dia me cae tan mal.
Fighting to make the change only to replace him with worthless Corporate owned puppet Joe Biden is more effort than I’m willing to give. They are both so shitty I’m fine with either of em.  Neither give a shit about the working class. Waste your time if you must.
This could be the greatest pay per view event of all times..  Biden vs God  In the Blue corner. Weighing in at 181 lbs, 6 feet tall... From Scranton Pennsylvania Jooooooeee Biden  In the gold corner weighing in at 1 oz to 2000 lb at an unknown height from heaven. Goddddd

The goal is to not take away votes from Biden!
Totally agree! I would have thrown in the towel and dumped it all in Biden and Pelosi’s laps. He loves America too much. He is a natural leader! Besides, his ego would not allow him to do that. TRUMP 2020!!!
Biden is so racist he can’t even hide it when he knows he has to! That’s bad! Wow
At this point, I'm more worried that Donald Trump has completely become unstable and unfit to serve the rest of the term.   Time to seriously consider the #25thAmendmentNow   He thinks Biden is going to hurt God. So I would support his sending children/teachers back to school.
But NO Biden does mean never democrat

By attacking Joe Biden for his Catholic faith.Donald Trump has shown himself,for the hateful,divisive   Bigot,that he is .
Someone’s pandering to Black voters, and it isn’t Biden.
I heard Biden is going to make ketchup illegal because it is RED, and the old Soviet Union has a red flag China has a red flag and the Republican party is red. What a bastard. I voting for Trump now.
Agreed. Other than my parents nobody I know is voting Biden.
Donald Trump disparages Biden’s school records,while hiding his academic ,”accomplishments” from sight.
What about Biden vs. Jesus ?
Makes no difference to me if or how you vote. I respect your freedom to choose.  I choose differently than you and the respect is not reciprocated.  It’s your way or the highway?  Biden has absolutely zero chance at getting my vote.  You could have not nominated him.
You know if they really wanted Biden to debate Trump they would at least do some kind of Zoom Debate.
Nigga I don’t really care I’m still voting for Biden
Seeing Biden talk about the latino community is really something he basically says nothing just we got to embrace the latino community we got to stop seperating families we got to include them okay but what exactly are you going to do to help the latino community are you going to
Biden seriously needs to just say what exactly he is going to do what are his plans this vague shit in his videos isn’t good enough.
I’m glad you understand the hypocricy. It’s okay to go after Biden for anything but when Trump sounds like a child it’s “award-winning journalism”. Your whatbaoutism is outstandingly stupid.
Wait I thought you wanted to court my vote, Donald. This only makes me want to vote for Biden even more, even if it is a complete lie.
Zero excitement campaign.  Zero benefit to the voter. Zero to vote to protect.  Zero chance I’m voting Biden.
Maybe. You know you are correct. I am helping trump.  If Biden wasn’t such a shitty nomination I most certainly wouldn’t be helping trump.  Every action has a re action.  Biden caused trump which causes........
My dumb ass voted Hillary.  I thought for sure she would win.   I was wrong.  I’m voting trump this year.  Biden is to far right for my vote. Trump is a protest vote.  If he wins he could completely destroy so many corporate creations. Need to nominate a real Dem in 24.
Biden is the most Republican candidate running. Biden reeks of MAGA.
If I lived through Joe Biden voting with Republicans from 1973-2009 to make himself wealthy and screw the working class...... you can make another 4 years of trump.
Electing Joe Biden starts with YOU being a registered voter 😌Anyone living in Michigan through November 3rd can go to this website RIGHT NOW and follow the steps to register within 5 minutes.   Take this time now so that it's not on your plate for later:)
Guys, Joe Biden is gonna use the black materia to summon meteor if he wins the presidency.
Biden is not going to move to the left. Did anybody even see his current ad where he is driving fancy ass car I mean seriously anybody that believes that Biden is going to move to the left is seriously naive if anything he will pander a little.
Don’t talk about supporting progressive policies when your there falling in line telling others to do the same and saying that Biden is moveable and that next cycle we can maybe have the candidate of our choice really?
I mean I don’t get how this is the right thing to do wait around till next cycle to get Biden out instead of making demands I don’t get their whole shit strategy.
Are excluded from the conversation. Biden wouldn’t even support Medicare for All or Student Loan Cancellation? Oh but we all just have to deal with it like always wait around for Biden to do what exactly save the ACA go back to the Obama times slow changes and half measures.
Trump is evil and shit but give us some sign that shit is going to change and that voters are being listened to cause as I see it right now Biden wins but what exactly is going to change for all of us who are out here barely making ends meet cause so far the poor/working class
Im sorry you all can go along with this shit I voted for Hillary in 2016 after being treated like shit by her supporters and there was never an apology from her or calls for her to call out her supporters. Now here we are doing this again but with Biden but instead Biden has
Honestly in the Settle with Biden and this Vote Trump Out shit bothers me why are progressives doing the work for him when he and his campaign should be doing the work.
They say that Biden is moveable when did he support progressive policies?
This bothers me. Basically the left falls in line again instead of demanding that Biden earn peoples votes. I live in Michigan and will be voting green and shaming those that vote green is  not it.
All good questions. I also heard that people didn't fill it out because Trump or Biden wasn't on it. Lots of voters are in the habit of ignoring primaries or misunderstanding them.
Lol relax “ Q “.   Pelosi, Biden, Schumer, and many many more are owned by the exact same Corporate elite as every Republican.  Puppets on a string.  Any Democrat who voted with Republicans is a Republican.  They all take orders from same corporate interests.
Joe Biden can't wait to find out who his running mate will be.
Yes. Detroit area. Some big ones, too. Mostly homemade.   The Biden people need to be giving away signs. NOW
This is FB page of Voice of America in Albanian Language stating that Joe Biden will be the next President, elaborating also that Biden will defeat  It’s a shame that VOA confusing Albanians with such (dis) information!
Sorry but Biden his campaign and the Dems are clowns if they wanted leftists/progressives to vote for them they would do better if they wanted unity they would not continue to talk shit about the left or do everything to stop progressive candidates and policies from winning
Posting Fuck Donald Trump isn’t stopping that fucking nightmarish piece of shit there needs to be a plan to hold his ass accountable I am not seeing any of these settle with Biden people talking about they just believe that if we get him out shit is just going to stop being
Im sorry but this is not Biden doing the work. Has Biden even talked at all about defunding/abolishing ICE and releasing the immigrant children at the detention centers???????
I don’t think anybody is advising him I think they are just letting him do whatever he wants. The campaign seems to not care their whole thing is we got to get Trump out vote for Biden cause he’s not Trump and that should be good enough it’s all very entitled and out of touch.
Where are the demands from these progressive orgs telling us to settle for Biden that Biden start doing the work to earn our vote. We can’t just wait around while shit gets worst that’s some real privileged shit to tell someone who is struggling oh just wait around for Biden
Im sorry but no. Progressives/leftists should not have to do the work for Biden he should be out there doing everything to earn their vote.
Im sorry but I will not be voting for Biden Vote Green. This whole wait till next cycle to get Biden out won’t cut it. Roots Nation should be demanding they replace him instead cause he is not it.
Joe Biden is trash
Under US code #2381 Joe Biden cannot run for office because of Treason!
😂😂. Ohhh Kay?  The biggest issue with Democrats is they are turning into Republicans.  Check out Joe Biden’s 40 year voting Record.  It makes Mitch McConnel look like a liberal.  We have a dimwitted Republican vs a spastic clown Republican to pick from this election. Good luck.
Why isn’t Biden out there more? He is trying to be the president.
realDonaldTrump: How can voters be sending in Ballots starting, in some cases, one month before the First Presidential Debate. Move the First Debate up. A debate, to me, is a Public Service. Joe Biden and I owe it to the American People!
If your a resist pro Biden account or a Republican please don’t follow me. 🙏
True this country was built on hard work of immigrants including technology leadership but Biden agenda is pro Pakistan China and anti India on Indian state of Kashmir.
We should all be demanding that they replace Biden with Bernie cause this clown isn’t it.
So vote Trump out by giving Biden the nomination even though he did not deserve it and then make demands after he is elected as if Biden as if he is going to do anything what is this shit.
should we settle every single one of these leftist orgs should be demanding that Biden do the fucking work and if he is not willing to do that then call them all the fuck out call the party out and demand they fucking replace him.
Biden won’t even debate or be at the convention. I hate Trump I think he is garbage but how is doing the work for Biden and his campaign going to push him to the left Biden keeps being given everything he also keeps getting free passes for barely doing nothing.
Seeing so called progressives literally doing the work for Biden while Biden does absolutely nothing really bothers me. If you all want leftists to vote for Biden then deman he do the work and step it the fuck up.
I will be voting green cause honestly fuck Biden and the DNC.
So let me get this straight you are going to be doing the work for Biden to get progressives to vote for him. Why is everybody doing this for Biden????
And I will not be supporting RootsAction.
Joe Biden Hits Trump’s Biggest Boast With A Brutal Coronavirus Reality Check
Was the army really scrambling for 23 year olds? This lil political propaganda video you like so much is grasping at so many straws. Did Biden serve? Or #BillClintonIsAPedo ? Did he? Lol  Are you a vet?
You know what concerns me is people like  are so deep in their alternate reality, they will be completely blindsided by the actuality of a Biden victory. Despite the evidence to the contrary, they will say Democrats stole the election. I would bet money on it.
These demonic DemocRATS are totally disgusting to our Nation and National Security. The Obama Cabal had their crosshairs aimed at Trump from the very beginning. And when he WON, it is OBVIOUS that this IS a Coup d'e'tat. No question. Because Trump WON. And Biden knew about it too
Biden can’t even complete sentence. 😂😂😂
Sadly, Biden is not is the same shape mentally that he was in. Something is going seriously wrong with Biden. As Americans, why can't we just pull together and not against anyone? #AmericansNeedToStandTogether
Joe Biden can't wait to find out who they pick to be his running mate!
Crap, Biden doesn't want to share the same stage with that lying fool getting insulted and I don't blame him. He saw what happened  to Hillary. Lol Biden say I'm too old for that blank.
Be canned at Biden's 😂
Not like I was going to vote for Biden anyway.
Republican operatives are pushing for Kanye to keep going so more votes are taken away from Biden. WAKE TF UP PEOPLE!!!!!!
You mean BIDEN is fighting DNA results in a rape case. Everyone forgot about the recent allegations against him. The press is SILENT.😔
Just explained to my family that I can’t vote for trump or Biden because neither of them made Late Registration. Neither of them could make a record like Yeezus. My uncle asked me if I was on crack
Harris is so charming. She’s also smarter than Biden
We do. Joe Biden is a decent man who has spent 40 years of his life serving the nation. Trump is a crook who has spent just as long ripping people off.
You should do something about that then man. The difference could not be more clear! Trump is incompetent and puts his own personal profit ahead of our safety. Biden is neither of those. For that reason alone Trump must go.
Make it in America = Joe Biden  Manufacturing jobs = Joe Biden  How do I know this folks?   I’ve seen him do it with my own eyes. He’s done it once before and he is going to do it again!   Regrow, rebuild America.  That’s our Joe.
I can't wait for another round of Joe Biden memes.
In 2016 Trump running opposed got about 480,000 votes Joe Biden, even with people still voting for Bernie Sanders who got 500,000 votes, just got over 800,000.
Our country faces many problems and Joe Biden isn't the answer to any of them.
Like the rest of us Joe Biden can't wait to find out who they pick as his running mate...
If Michelle Obama is picked as his VP I predict a huge shift on moneyline odds:   Biden -300 (favorite) Trump +425 (underdog) #Odds #MichelleMoneyLine
I do not give shit. Write it down tell the world.  Biden voted away my pension before I was old enough to work. Biden has sucked the Corp d for 40 years. Making himself wealthy at our expense.  I 100 % don’t care.  Progress can be painful
Joe Biden can't wait to find out who they pick to be his running mate...
Let’s not forget that Mr Biden will have Media allies to help him if he gets into a jam.
I think he should do it at the WH!    Joe Biden will no longer travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
Current Odds via odds shark   Biden -165 Trump +145  #probability   Probability still remains neither  (if elected/re-elected) will do shit to help this country or its people.  #HistoryAlwaysRepeatsItself
Joe Biden is our modern day Weekend at Bernie's.
Joe Biden is our modern day Weekend At Bernie's.

Look say what you want about Biden, but most people, when asked if they need to take a test to prove that their brain works, would respond the same way. Trump's the only one who thinks the point of the test is to get extra points.
Bless his heart. At least Biden provides us some laughter...bittersweet...he may be a good man at heart..but his mind is just not up to the task....sad. #MAGA2020 #BidenNeedsToRetire #BidenIsPitiful #HowCanGoodPeopleSupportAbortion?
You don’t have to get it.  If you are voting for Biden there is much you don’t get.
Joe Biden is the national reset we need on COVID-19, but he's more than 75,000 lives away
Prediction: Joe Biden will promise to reveal VP pick after he wins election.
Lmao because they know Trump would destroy Biden.
Them and a lot of the KHivers and Biden people are in meltdown mode.
Thanks! Now I know how I WON’T vote!! You want your Dems to take this with them to the polls or just print it out and submit it as their phony ballot? Not a bad idea since they can’t think for themselves — just like your buddy Biden!
Joe Biden was most recently seen in public attending the funeral of Rep. John Lewis. Where was our(current) President while one of our Civil Rights heroes was laid to rest?
Easy vote out that POS in November!!!! Vote blue!!! Vote Biden!!!! #Biden2020Landslide #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS #BlueWave2020TakeOver
BLM and Antifa rioting in Democrat Socialist controlled cities are receiving political cover from the Democrat Socialist mayors and governors. There are articles showing the DNC and Biden Campaign providing bail money and other funding.
The longer you tolerate this shitty ACA the longer you will tolerate Corporate Puppet Nominations like Biden.  Vote against Biden.  Trump may end the ACA.  Opens up the floor for Medicare 4 All.
When you look at the math the percentage of test to death rate was his point. Swan was making a different point. Can Joe Biden calculate this? It’s a legitimate question and should be asked hard questions. Good luck landing an interview.
What Kasich Gives Biden - The Atlantic
I’m voting against Biden. Idgaf who that corporate puppet picks. Whoever it is they voted against too.
Biden is like a cheating husband. For 40 years he voted against us and was paid handsomely to do so. This idiot voted to cut social security twice.
Sugar, cupcake, we don’t need Joe Biden. We demand Medicare for all. Sweetheart you had a chance to get the Boomers, the minority’s, the working class, and the young.  You chose Biden.  Buttercup don’t expect to win. You might but I am out on Corporate Joe.  Sugarplum
No Medicare for all. No vote for Biden. Maybe 2024 if not no vote for whoever the corporate puppet nominee is.
I do. I need a lot more than Corporate pole smoker Joe Biden can offer.  He voted across the aisle against us in a bi partisan manner for over 40 years. He made himself rich doing so. Rewarded by corps who enslave the working class.  Trump is ok by me.
Well, #Democrat  has this going for him, the Revolutionary Communist Party has endorsed him  #tcot #gop #migop
Here we go, #Democrats already trying to "protect"  saying he shouldn't debate President   #tcot #gop #migop
You really want Biden. That is the most polite comment I’ve seen defending him.  You deserve a pass on a truck load of Biden hate I’m looking to bury someone in.
I’m not for Biden
Biden versus Trump. Some speculate that the future of the republic hinges on the outcome of the next election. But for smart investors it doesn't really matter who wins.
It's my understanding that Fox is not "news" but rather an entertainment channel so why would Biden waste his time?
The Jill Biden interview was NOT surprising: phony smiles, phony statements, phony comments, especially, when she said that Joe is "moderate". Ha-ha-ha! I don't know what else we could expect from her?
Biden doesn’t resort to fairytales,like Trump does.Biden has not told tall tales about George Washington’s arevolutionary war Air Force,or the Bowling Green massacre.
Eric, how do you spell Yosemite, Yoseamight? You really should Stop mocking Joe Biden.
He says Biden could have, but didn't. What took Trump so long? Just in time for election. Too little, too late.

We’ll see. Damn shame that Biden is the best they have to offer. Suspect he’s their placeholder.
realDonaldTrump: Big Pharma is taking ads against me because I am MASSIVELY lowering your drug prices, which is obviously not good for them. Medicare premiums will also be going down. I am the first President to take them on. Don’t fall for their false ads. Biden plan is for…
Bingo.  Trump is an expert liar &amp; spinner, and his team frankly is better at manipulating media to their advantage.  Trump gets a plethora of sound bytes where he sounds like someone competent.   There's nothing for Biden to gain here.
I think it's important to tune him out, to de-emphasize him. I believe in the Lincoln Project, and will vote for Biden.
I’d rather have 4 more with trump than 8 with Biden OR his VP
realDonaldTrump: My visits last week to Texas and Florida had massive numbers of cheering people gathered along the roads and highways, thousands and thousands, even bigger (by far) than the crowds of 2016. Saw no Biden supporters, and yet some in the Fake News said it was a…
So Cher when are you going to be going to Washington to be in President elect Joe Biden's Cabinet. I'm sure he can put in one of the cabinet seats.
Lmao he’s answered unscripted questions numerous times, asshat. This is not unlike when your ilk posted all of the photos of an invite only press conf that Biden had and called it a “rally” in retort to the orange clown drawing 6k ppl to Tulsa and embarrassing himself.
Joe Biden can’t debate a 5th grader or a trained parrot 🤷‍♀️
Joe Biden can’t debate a 5th grader 🤦‍♀️ ... scratch that , he couldn’t debate a trained parrot 🤷‍♀️
How STUPID IS OMAR? BIDEN is running in a basement NOT ON A PLATFORM - BITCH!
It really doesn't matter. It's all on Trump's watch. Good luck trying to convince voters that it'll get worse if Biden's elected. I can just see the ads. "I'm Don the Con. I've turned the U.S. into a cesspool and screwed the American people but if Joe's elected it'll be worse.
Someone in Biden's camp has mapped out a great campaign. Simply let Trump hang himself.
Oh im voting but not for him or biden.
Tomorrow you'll have Jill Biden on your 2pm show. Are you going to ask her harsh ???, like WHY DID YOU ALLOW YOUR SICK HUSBAND TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT? IS HE GOING TO DEBATE TRUMP OR YOU HIDE HIM AGAIN IN YOUR BASEMENT? We'll be watching!
We all know why the Democrats and liberal news media are afraid to let Biden debate Trump.
GOP PAC restoration something or other campaign ad showing Biden in 1987 talking about his school, IQ then saying he has never been right for the presidency. Not a good track. For every 1 Biden sound bite, we have 50 for Bonespurs
Biden Panic Thread
This isn't a hard choice.  While Biden was spending his years in public service, your dad was perfecting his ability to bullshit &amp; spin to his advantage.
Doesn’t matter.  There’s enough Trump haters for Biden to win unfortunately.
Trump’s ratings will be high when they announce how bad he loses to Joe Biden!
I’m voting for trump.  I am casting my vote for the gent who goes by Donald  J Trump.  Not sure what all this a vote for this equals that.  I hate Biden.
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  i think he's right...
Joe Biden is not the answer to any known question.
I feel sorry for you if you have faith in Biden 🤣 dude can't even remember he's running
I really don’t understand why this is considered such a close race. Biden’s base includes young people who want to see socialism reign, or older people who just can’t stand Trump. The voting system is a joke. Biden is a puppet for the radical left. Is this what you want?
Biden can't wait to find out who he picked to be his running mate...
"He's clean and articulate" - Joe Biden
No leadership by Trump caused this. Vote for Joe Biden!
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Yes indeed! Michigan vote for Joe Biden!
Maybe.  You are probably right. A gambling man would say the candidates who name are pre printed on the ballot have a much greater chance of winning than a write in.  I’m not voting for trump to win. I’m voting to cause Biden’s loss.
Nope.  But I’m voting trump. I hate them both.  This Biden nomination is so disgusting I’m voting like Biden did for 40 years with the wrong side.
Be aware of new "grass roots" movement of Dems NOT TO HAVE the debates btw Biden &amp; Trump. The obvious reason is NOT that Trump will say "lies" and Joe will "correct" it. They just cannot allow sick man to show his SICKNESS! The liars CANNOT full the TrumpTrain! #Trump2020 !
No they didn't, go further away from Detroit...further north the more Trump signs you will see! I haven't see one Biden sign at all
Unlike Trump,Biden realizes that it’s way past time,for our country to pay its bills.Trump has been maxing out,our credit cards.
Joe Biden and the Democrats,will deliver the vaccine,that will bring an end to the. utter lunacy,that has been the Trump era
Biden doesn’t know what day it is 😂
You making me pick Biden is your choice?   It’s an analogy and a damn good one. The play on words is Trump is AIDS, but Biden is better or HIV pos.  I didn’t actually think you have to pick one anymore than you think I’m voting Biden.
Biden not debating Trump makes him look weak as fuck.
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
You are correct. Tea Party stated they would not vote for Candidates not far enough Right.  President Obama won all 3 branches.  Mid term GOP took much back. Then they blocked virtually everything for next 6 years.   Biden loses because of a protest vote. Maybe then???
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Joe Biden is about as radical as Mitt Romney.
Joe Biden is as far left as George Bush.
If I said you have to have a sexual relationship with a HIV positive person or an equally attractive person with full blown AIDS.  How would respond without being “ Juvenile “ ?   Biden sucks. Not worth voting for. If you disagree tell me again are you gunna date AIDS or HIVpos?
Dear America,Bring back sanity to our  Biden.
Have seen more signs for Joe Biden than I ever did for Hillary Clinton and it's still very few.   The Biden campaign should be giving out yard signs everywhere. It's heartening and encouraging to see other Blue voters putting it out there.   That is what creates enthusiasm.
Biden has held a political position for over 40 years... you think he’s going to change things now? #GTFOH
Keep Joe Biden away from photo ops with tanks.
Trumps a Republican like Biden. They never do anything for the working class.
Ryan blocked me a while ago for calling him out for his ridiculous attacks on Biden... and I voted for Sanders earlier this year when he was still in the race for the nomination.
I don't blame Biden. I wouldn't want to be subjected to Trump's insults and lies either. That's a good strategy.
What does  know about #MadeinAmerica? The only thing Biden made in America was the millions of dollars China paid him. This guy's missing a few slices of bread if you ask anyone with 1/2 a brain. #Trump2020
Trump hasn’t done any damage! I don’t want Biden! And I don’t want to live in a socialist Country! Biden had over 50 years to do something ! He did nothing!He has Dementia and no one saids anything!
Am I the only one that hears  voice &amp; feels a sense of calmness? Please GOD answer the HUGE majority of AMERICANS prayers &amp; make sure Nov. 3rd we get President Joseph R. Biden to save us all &amp; to save America from the devil in the WH now! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🌊🌊🌊🌊
Looks promising...but the only poll that counts is the one taken on election day.  The only thing I'm sure of is that Joe Biden is not the person to look to when trying to fix any problem whatsoever.
Why do we need New material when the old stuff is so accurate and effective? Projection. Your cult leader uses it every day. "If Biden gets elected there'll be rioting and chaos" while, there's rioting and chaos. At least Biden won't kill off 155,000 people for Obama's economy.
Steve Hilton warns Trump campaign is 'sleepwalking into a Biden presidency': 'Wake Up'  #FoxNews
Not trying to be sacrilegious, but as Joe Biden say 'You know the thing'!
All I'm sure of is that Joe Biden isn't the answer to any problem the country is currently grappling with.
If we do not vote for vice president Joe Biden for presidency in 2020 this can happen to us again.... #VoteBidenToSaveAmericaPlease.
They know that they're gonna have their ass handed to em in November so they're just practicing and getting warmed up for when Biden is elected. The only time they give a rats ass about the debt and deficit is when a dem is in office. That's the only time they're conservative.
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
I voted for Hillary after Wasserman Schultz assisted in the cheating of Bernie.  This year,after Bernie dropped out, I committed to voting straight Republicans entire ballot. And I sent Jen in Florida running against Wasserman Schultz money instead of Biden.
Biden could pick Jesus Christ as his VP and it doesn’t matter. He himself voted against the working class for 40 years.  He himself voted to cut social security. He himself is a rapist. He himself got his moron kid a million dollar a year scam from Ukraine.  Hell no to Joe
I agree.  Im not afaraid of trump burning this corrupt corporate system to the ground.                                      Biden is also a Republican so neither one are worth voting for.  Another 4 more years of trump is what the DNC deserves for this Biden bullshit
I like Trump more than Biden.  Trump fucks off most days doing nothing. Biden will be on point doing everything his corporate puppet masters order him to daily.  Plus Biden spent 40 years in office voting with GOP. I’ll pass.
That is not fair.  Biden sucks.  Shall we count the times he voted against the working class over his 40 years in office?  Voting to cut Medicare is the reason I am voting trump myself.  Terrible nomination. Good luck though.
I can’t afford a Republican like Biden in office.  Trump may completely destroy Wall Street, Big Banking..... this clown could collapse everything!!!  I’d ❤️ to see him burn down this disgusting corporate welfare system.
I’m voting for trump.  I may have my entire ballot blood red until 2024.  Biden’s 40 year voting record is the reason.  Vote against me, f you.
This just shows that Biden will not fight for us whatsoever and is not going to be able to even fight the Republican party when trying to pass policies.
Are you fucking kidding me? ⁦ This is who you want us to vote for you don’t even want him to debate Trump so you all just gave him the nomination and he has to basically do nothing for our votes wow.
Now more than ever we need Biden to drop out and Bernie replaces him.
#realDonaldTrump   Hey Joe Biden why ya Been Hiding (going over 8 thou views in 6 days//// working here and twitter to make it go Viral Help me if you can!!!! Repost) and May The Lord look over you and your fam from Minister Thomas
Repubelicons using projection is just another day that ends in y. Biden's never been accused of racism, while your Nazi  leader has a history of being a racist his entire life. Even now, whites storming state capitals are Patriots while black peaceful demonstrators are thugs.
She was drunk and still loved Biden
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's rights...
Everything that came out of this guys mouth was that Biden was doing good in the polls and that it helped him to have Obama with him or whatever on those videos.
They had some guy from Bidens campaign this morning on MSNBC that campaign is garbage also they just think Biden is going to win cause he is Biden and because people hate Trump so basically they are just giving him the nomination without doing the work he is going to do very
I’ll probably see Bigfoot before I see a Joe Biden yard sign.
No ti think that would be you Joe Biden! The Democrats have you going through the montions to be President! But in reality they know you are not well man and sending out their even once in while from your basement is all this country needs to know it be you that alter our Nation!
using #fear &amp; scare tactics saying will b more #rioting under  ... REALLY? Maybe take a chance on #Biden because this all happened on Trump's watch! People r done w/Trump's dividing #UnitedStates w/#HateSpeech &amp; #Propaganda! #Biden2020  #YesWeCanAgain
I still see people saying D’s and R’s are essentially the same, but I don’t remember Clinton or Obama engaging a secret police on Americans, and I certainly don’t remember seeing that on Biden’s platform.
Just watched an hour long Biden infomercial!  Oh... wait... its
Biden was literally just at John Lewis’ funeral. Where was Trump? (not that he would have been welcome anyways)
Joe Biden actually wants to pay off the deficit.Donald Trump just wants to keep spending.
But, but, but isn't Biden senile? Haven't heard that one bandied about in a while.
Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate
So you’re endorsing Biden! Cool! Because you’re destroying this Democracy with your bullshit Fascism and wannabe dicctatorship. This is one Veteran that will fight you tooth and nail. My oath NEVER expired. Maybe try honoring you’re own oath. Oh wait, you know NOTHING of honor.
Joe Biden would say that he ain't really black.
He is not terrified and he is not going to lose. Joe Biden is incompetent and a liar.
Not working, Matt. Nobody cares about Biden in his basement. In a few months he'll be at the White House measuring the drapes. Donnie will be picking out jumpsuits. Orange or striped. I'd say stripes. It'll make him look taller where orange will make him look like a fat pumpkin.
Biden will win in a landslide election! Mr Vindman is a American hero for stepping up ! You are just another trumpy sucking trumps ego ! Your loyalty to America should out weigh your loyalty to this corrupt moron ! Btw , wear a mask ! 😷
And you all thought that maybe Biden and the Dems were going to move left gtfoh.
Yes, all 20 of them. Pretty bad that even trump humpers aren't buying his bullshit anymore. They're all like "I can't believe i fell for this wack job. I knew he was nuckin futs but I didn't realize trump was psycopathic sociopath. Please vote for Biden".
We're the hypocrites, Connie? We're fear mongers? That's all the right has is fear. Have ya seen your dear leaders ads? If Biden's elected, it'll be anarchy. Says the president responsible for anarchy. You don't see anything hypocritical about that? Obviously not. Lemmings.
Fact check: Trump distorts Biden's position on fracking
Biden Campaign Says He Is So Close To A VP Pick He Can Smell Her August 1st, 2020
I agree. Biden will be Biden. Whatever his corporate puppeteers want him to do he will.  No golf. No parties. Just instant obedience to corporate orders. At least trump sprinkles in 200 scandals to slow down corporate progress.
Why do progressives need to take to the street in millions?  You are sadly mistaken.  Biden is not worth missing 20 minutes of work to vote for him. We don’t care if he wins.  Those of you who want him better start organizing.  I see 2 republicans on the ballot. I hate both.
It was kinda hard for me to understand what he was saying. Thats because I don't speak dog. But I got what he was saying. I asked Scooby if he would vote for Trump in November. He said this. GRR GRRR GRR GRRR WOOF WOOF GRR GRRR. So I took that as a big NO. He's voting for Biden.
I don’t support Corporate Joe Biden. I don’t care who he picks for vp.

I know how the debate will go Biden will give his plans talk about horrible Trumps response has been, what he would do differently how he will fix the mess, Trump will insult, lie, and call fake news on everything, a debate isn't needed for me I already know I am voting Trump OUTI told Hillary in 16 that she needs Chinese bots to defeat Trump's Russian bots. She didn't listen therefore she didn't get elected. Biden's campaign did! You win by fighting fire with fire!!! He gets it!
Um African Americans are not originated in the US. Hence their name AFRICAN. They are from Africa which has 54 different countries. And you want this clown (Biden) to be your next president. You are funny.
Burn that garbage, Trump is going down November 3rd...Biden 2020 MFers 🤣
Any time pimp
JOE BIDENS MENTAL STATE IS ZERO,HE DUMB,DON'T KNOW WHAT STATE OR CTY HE'S IN.BEN DON'T KNOW CRAP.HE WILL HURT AMERICANS,RAISE TAXES.BIDEN IS TREATING BLACKS WRONG SAYING STUPID CRAP..AMERICANS DON'T VOTE FOR BIDEN, VOTE TRUMP.
I see Biden screwed up again saying crap about black people,he is always downing the black race when he speaks.Joe Biden is a mental idiot how the hell van he run a country when he don't know where he is, don't know if it's his wife or her sister,can't even speak well
The DNC did, Biden doesn’t shit unless scripted. What a joke.
If you truly were you'd realize that Trump uses us a photo op. Biden is a true Catholic. Why would you say he's not? Do you personally know him? That's what I thought
If Biden has 100 a day then Trump has a million. You really want to keep on going? Come on dude check yourself before you wreck yourself...literally
You say Biden has dementia but Trump has 2 gaffes in one day? Yeah I'd chill on that
The worst things Biden has said compares nothing to the things Trump has said that is for certain and at least Biden has the decency to apologize if he feels he has said wrong while Trump feels he can't do or say wrong which is exactly why we're in the dire situation we are in
Ride or die Joe Biden fans anytime he talks
I can’t argue that he has dealt with an incredible amount of grief. That story I shared is completely legit though, along with many other instances of his dishonesty. All I said was Joe Biden will not be a good President. I didn’t say he should or shouldn’t beat Trump.
You mean when Biden is running for his second term and Trump is in prison and bankrupt.
And I don't see Biden as garbage or even with dementia I just believe what he has is a speech impediment and that's alright. I'm sorry you feel that way about him but that's alright it's your opinion as an American and that's what being American is supposed to be about.
Dems didn't expect Trump to mess up this much and are now having Biden talk, along with suing the NRA, in order to lose harder.
I respect your opinion I only see one evil this election in fact I see Biden as someone that shares more true conservative values than Trump does
I just can't imagine Joe Biden tweeting this or completing any other thought.
biden will be just as bad as trump, but a different type of bad
Join me in supporting Biden Victory Fund via
Biden should refuse to debate that nitwit if he doesn’t release his taxes
I think you meant Biden
I wasn't referring to Biden of course I was referring to the Gov I'd rather her stay also I think Kamala is the perfect choice
Biden had a little bit of a gaffe today but thanks to Trump that got overshadowed big time. For Biden just has a speech impediment, Trump is just plain dumb and ignorant.
See I don’t think Joe Biden is a decent human being, but that’s just my opinion. I don’t think he’s a good politician, I don’t think he’s of sound mind and I certainly do not believe he will be a good President. I’m taking Trump out of the equation and just evaluating Biden.
tRump is confusing Joe Biden's policy on China with HIS policy on Russia. Stupid as the day is long.
Trump has had 2 gaffes in one day yet he says Biden is mentally ill? Lol
Biden wouldn't block Trump's prosecution if the Justice Department pursued it   Prosecuted for beating Hillary?
I'm happy Biden has at least narrowed it to two legit VP candidates. Harris or Rice are great choices although of course I'd prefer Kamala since she's more moderate but I do love both. Both are great.
She would throw away her vote if Biden picks Susan Rice.  Easy enough to understand.
Our  is amazing &amp;  would be a strong VP partner for  But I believe our future currently depends on actively championing #RacialEquity in the White House with one of our strong and well-qualified #shortlisted #womenofcolor in 2020.
Biden is picking either Harris or Rice huh? Good. I still take Kamala but both are definitely qualified.
This year yes we have to. Besides Biden's worst compared nothing to Trump's worst
[Biden takes both hands off wheel while "driving", turns completely to passenger seat camera] Look, folks...  Director: Uh, Mr. Biden. We've been over this.
The problem is Biden doesn’t even know what he’s saying anymore.
Imagine if trump asked a black reporter if he did coke before they went on air and then continued to ask if he was a junky   Just imagine the headlines “trump racist, implies African American journal..”   But Biden does it? Not a peep
If you are looking at it as a lesser of two evils decision, then I get it. I can promise you a Biden presidency isn’t going to magically turn everything around. He will be a failure.
Honestly if we don’t see Biden and trump speak to each other on a debate stage then we shouldn’t have an election.   1. You should have to be able to defend your platform in a non-scripted setting   2. If either of them catch Covid let’s be fucking honest nobody is gonna cry
I can’t predict the future but Joe Biden does not seem to be a viable candidate to run this country in my eyes. I’m not trying to compare him to Trump, I’m trying to gauge his potential to be a good President. I do not see it.
Biden will beat Trump. I don’t like Biden, I do not think he will be a good President (Easily could be the worst President of all time), but he will beat Trump. Only way Biden loses is if he absolutely shits the bed on the debate stage. It would have to be a historic meltdown.
Honestly Covid or not I think the American people deserve to at least see trump and Biden battle about IQ tests on a debate stage like this needs to happen
Who thinks Biden cares!!
After 60%+ votes have already been cast in some states, the 1st debate is planned...but will it be realized? Ahhh, different ?? Biden won’t debate because he knows he can’t match Trump, on ANY subject. That is, if Trump shows up and not The Donald!
Listen, I love Kamala, but watching Biden use and get credit for Elizabeth Ann Warren’s plans (that she’s had done for months) and potentially leaving her in the dust is *devastating* to me.
Trump if he loses the election to Biden
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Might put Biden's notifications on in case he announces his running mate by tweet...man I really hope it's Kamala...🤞
Reading  statements about the terrible explosion today in Jordan is like.... what the hell are you even talking about? What a stupid fucking goon. Possibly as senile as Biden at this point tbh. I hate this place.
Joe Biden doesn't have a virus named after him! #TrumpVirus
Not outside the realm of possibility that Biden simply doesn’t realize he needs to pick a VP.
This dumb motherfucking moron! We're lower than the world and we're lower than Europe. WTF and his stupid fucked in the head supporters point out Biden every chance they get, really? Cmon people wakeup before we're all speaking Russian.
I truly wish she did. But 99% of ppl who want to vote for her will say a vote for her is a vote for Biden or a vote for trump. I wish ppl truly believed there was more then two parties but this country’s far from that.
I don’t love Biden either but at this point I don’t know how you can look at any Trump “policy” or interview and still think he won’t destroy this country. 155k preventable deaths, hate crimes, sexism, racism, and the worst 2nd quarter ever is trumps legacy
Labor union leader challenged on Biden's promise to create jobs | Fox Business. God Bless ⁦
Biden has lied about plenty of things just like Bernie just like when Bernie said he would promise to cure cancer and boom he dropped out soon next will be Biden or he'll loose... Biden likes little kids if u want a pedo for president thts ur problem
I doubt that Joe Biden is the one with "performance problems."
Biden is winning in some of the most important swing states. Trump only won with 25% of the vote last time if our generation actually would vote Biden can win in a landslide. And tbh Nick it’s not a “lol” if trump wins again it’s going to be devestating for our democracy
Why wouldn’t we have this virus?  Every country in the world has it. But Biden who said he wouldn’t have stopped travel from China would have stopped it. How would that be? Forget that we had a virus? He could do that. What else would he have done?
Yeah, but what about Biden?
I live in Michigan and I'm voting for Joe Biden. I'm encouraging every single person I know to do the same. I can feel the momentum!
I don’t have one Trump sign by me or one Biden sign by me! Signs mean nothing. I saw at least 100 bad tweets against trump and 1 really bad tweet against trump and all kinds of bad memes about trump. I’ve seen more than 4 great tweets for Biden, 4 yes way more than 4. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Joe Biden has heard a lot about his potential choices. He is being thoughtful and weighing the possibilities, trying to make the best decision.  How is this bad? Is there a deadline?  I hate when media tries to create an issue where there isn't one.  I get that you are tired irl.
Michigan doesn't need Biden and America itself doesn't need him neither... This world would actually do better without his weird pedo ways running these streets I'm voting Republican ^^ Make America Great Again! #MAGA
It is ponderous that many people are embracing that Trump or Biden is a genius because most evidence thus far suggests the contrary. People are investing their personal identities into highly flawed candidates to put it in the most generous terms.
Saw an ad attacking Biden for exaggerating academic credentials. Clip was from 33 years ago. I began wondering how far back would we have to go to find tRump lying? Oh, right. That would sometime today. BTW where are his academic records?
The man in the White House doesn’t even know the difference between absentee voting and “vote-by-mail”
nah. biden is trustworthy. full stop.
Enjoy your visit with your parents. Be careful and wear a mask and socially distance from others. Michigan is seeing a rise in covid again. I believe MI will be a Biden state in November!
Another words. A Biden/Antifa rally. Perfectly safe.
Some people like trump some people like Biden. Get over it.
I live in Michigan and I'm voting for Joe Biden.
Undermining Biden’s campaign to create false drama...same shit the NYT used to give us the Trump Show
Yes. There were some strong candidates and Biden enters the race very late in the game and becomes THE defacto candidate? 🤨
Yes.  Still voting for Biden.
I said it before and I'll say it again, I'll vote for Biden if he has a live TV interview the day before and is standing there picking his nose with one hand while playing paddle ball with the other!
It all depends on what happens 2021-23. Maybe Crenshaw emerges as the favorite. It also depends on whether or not Biden seeks a second term. All circumstantial.
Biden has to hide he is such an butt hole he can'teven give a speach right, never knows where he's at ,a big lier. I would not be surprised if he had dimentia or elshiemer.  He is the biggest idiot to run for president.His past is on ads that show he lies all the time
Shirley Chisholm blazed the way for every Black woman Biden is considering for VP
If Joe Biden picked Bonzo or his sister, I'd support the selection. As long as he/she does not constantly look adoringly at him like some VPs we could mention (Pence).
He's the one rigging the election plain and simple.
I do not believe the world (or me) will exhale until Biden is safely ensconced in the White House and tRump is gone to wherever he is gonna go.
Biden should be listening to the younger progressives in the party...that’s where the energy comes from...democrats win when they get people excited...Bill Clinton did it, Obama did as well
I could be mad about this but to be fair Biden wasn't winning Kentucky anyways
You can vote for Biden, not vote at all, etc. In the long run, it doesn’t really matter because we’ll always be systemically oppressed as long as we have national elections, esp between two parties. So me? I don’t care what you do. Just don’t force people to vote for x person.
If you’re getting heated about who Biden will pick for VP: don’t ❤️
If the US elects Joe Biden American citizens should brush up on the Chinese language because that’s what we’ll be speaking and also Asian botany because apparently the Chinese communists plan on using the U. S. as a greenhouse.  via
I hope Biden doesn't listen to his certain allies. Picking Kamala would be a slam dunk for him, don't mess this up Joe I pray 🙏
Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.
That's funny. You're a real hoot. However, I believe Joe Biden was vice president when Barack Obama pulled us out of the great recession.
I'm ashamed to say I live in Michigan.  The biggest problem Trump has in Michigan is that he tells the truth about the black messiah (Obama).  People don't like Biden, they just don't like the fact that Obama sucked and Trump keeps saying it.
Biden will win, I think by a large margin.
Yeah I can’t imagine him showing up for Biden’s inauguration. He’ll have some excuse. I just want his margin of defeat to be so large that he can’t lie to himself about it. He’ll lie to everyone else for sure. But I just want him to have to admit to himself that he lost.
so are you gonna cheerlead and knock doors and advocate publicly for biden?
Neil Cavuto is a Biden loving scum sucking bag of shit.  He doesn't have a very high rated show and really should go to CNN, where he would be a good fit with Don Lemon or Chris Cuomo.
You wanna vote for Biden cause he’s not Trump? Fine.  But I never thought I’d see Palestinians and Arabs cheerlead for a guy who openly and proudly says “I am a Zionist.”  It’s shameful. #Palestine #FreePalestine
Trump offers many statements that are phony but current economic disruptions are not the result of one person. This derailment included the near entirety of both parties wounding the economy and abandoning the public. #US #CARES #Democrats #Republicans
Wut? Don’t think they want to raise that topic. “‘But as Bill Clinton once told me, the number one cause of Alzheimer’s is ambition,’ he added, while noting he’s in favor of Demings.”
Another idea since we are just floating them:  The US Military puts your fucking ass against a wall and installs Pence until he wins in his own right or Biden takes over?
Absolutely better off with Biden. Fuck Trump!
That’s funny I thought Biden was the moderate choice and people are voting for him because he won’t do to us what Trump has done
Democracy means you can vote and have someone to vote for you on bills. opposite of a democracy is dictatorship or monarchy  Socialism is a theory that the community owns everything.  Biden never said anything about Socialism or Removing democracy. He said “Democratic socialism.”
I don’t see it as a fear of others.. more of a personal decision on how she needs to frame the election. Pretty clear she is not a Biden fan but she’s ready &amp; willing to work on getting him elected. Odd? Yup. Anti-democratic or big deal outside of twitter? Nah. She’ll put in work
Automatic loss for Biden in Michigan
“I think she wrote an article about why she won’t vote for Biden.” Wrong.  “She said she won't endorse him but won't campaign against him. How does that make her stance on the election any better?” Because she didn’t imply she’d sit out this cycle? Don’t put words in her mouth 🤷🏻‍♂️
Congrats to the people of Georgia for joining Arizona &amp; N.Carolina in polling Joe Biden ahead of the screwball! Next on the list the state of Texas where Biden is creeping closer everyday!
Had this occurred under Obama/Biden it would have been handled swiftly and correctly.....it NEVER would have been called a hoax
I live in Michigan and I'm voting for Biden.
I think people are more worried about Trump getting another 4 years then the fact that Biden is moderate or subpar
If you think joe Biden is left wing you’re smoking crackthey're in the middle of rehabilitating GWB and Biden is already saying that prosecuting Trump (who is, according to the Democratic Party right now, a fascist, corrupt, treasonous, totalitarian existential threat to democracy) would be "bad for democracy"  what do people expect?
Someone with skills should make a  Joe Biden gaff ringtone set for us.  Probably needs the ability to get frequent updates.
Biden campaign claims lagging auto jobs puts Trump at disadvantage in Michigan
Biden first entered my awareness as Obama's VP pick at the height of my own atheist phase so this all checks out
Did Trump in fact claim that Biden insulted the Black community?  It seems like an accurate headline.
But.....you all laughed when Trump said he would beat OBAMA.  Yup  He running against BIDEN , you said.  You LIED
Yays Joe Biden's spin department.  Can you imagine Joe trying to use a smart phone?
Hunter Biden is acting like a normal Presidential nominee’s son. Dignified and quiet. Just as things should be... fucking normal!
With all those BW around Biden was like yal are tools w no direction
Wouldn’t it upset #45, if Kanye West was able to snatch his intended votes and Biden still won in those states anyway. This could very well backfire on #45!  instead of running  why not take care of yourself and focus on your family?
But anyway ... wouldn’t it be an upset if West was able to snatch #45 intended votes and Biden won in those states where Kanye’s name is on the ballet. Ijs ... this could backfire on #45!
It really suck to be  when he calls out black people for not being diverse. Just goes to prove that Joe Biden  and the Democratic Party are racist.
keeps fucking up. Why does this old wrinkled up white guy keep making racist comments towards people of color? Don't want to walk back racist comments? Don't make them in the first place. The man is a closet racist. The KKK is proud of Biden.
require politicians to run their own Twitter accounts, I want to see what Biden would actually tweet
Even worse. He says Biden will "hurt God".  I'm definitely voting for Biden because I don't want to piss off someone with that kind of power.
I agree sounds like an excuse not to vote for Biden.
If a vote for 3rd = Vote for Trump Then logically, it's also a vote for Biden
Nope, Swear to GOD! NO BIDEN SHIT ANYWHERE!   HOWEVER; FREAKING TRUMP IS EVERYWHERE! TRUMP FLAGS IN  YARDS &amp; ON HOUSES, TRUMP SIGNS IN YARDS, TRUMP BUMPER STICKERS, TRUMP HATS, TRUMP TEE SHIRTS, TRUMP SOCKS!   MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS FUCKING LYING TO AMERICANS AGAIN!  POLLS R FAKE!
I’m attending The National Education Association’s event, “Virtual Town Hall on Reopening Schools with Jill Biden and NEA President Lily Eskelsen García” – sign up now to join me! #StrongPublicSchools
Doesn't Biden support abortion ?  That's not Catholic.  He a lie.
I express myself much more completely in writing. Biden has a stutter that complicates things as well.
I can’t wait for Biden to open his mouth,
I think it is time that Republicans and Democrats admit that Trump and Biden are not good Christians. We should pray for them both.
Please pull your head out of your ass and realize that Biden is the only choice to vote for in November. #RidinWithBiden2020
Yet you want to post some drivel about how your vote for Biden hinges on his VP pick.
Also Biden..You ain’t black 😐
LOL The Anti-Christ (Trump) said Biden is going to hurt The Bible, Hurt GOD?
Biden will never debate Trump.  He scared.
the people wants Biden so...
You may be surprised...I only ever heard of Biden because of the Obama/Biden memes 😂.  But if you want to lead the country, why not debate 🤷‍♀️. Is Biden going down hill so bad he can’t debate 😬. Because that is what people will think 😐.
Biden is a tainted candidate from a tainted party.🇺🇸👎🏾
Now do Obama’s Biden/Lewis rally 😐
He has my vote with or without...but watching Biden debate would be entertaining 😁
yes those things are definitely part of it  of course you'd have to conduct a cognitive test to be sure, which is routine for someone Biden's age and especially with clear signs of decline, but he refuses to be tested
Biden will never debate Trump
Replace Joe Biden with "every politician who has taken money from corporations" and remove "until election day" and I'm in
I’d be willing to bet most Americans have made a choice...Biden could walk on stage in a diaper with a pacifier in his mouth and people would still vote for him...if I’m being honest..I would. 🤷🏽‍♀️ trump has got to go...
I literally listened to a Joe Biden video where is stated the following!   “In order for crime to flourish we need criminals.” “We must have A.) Criminals or B.) Victims”  or vice versa. But I digress!   WTF !! Really JOE!
Michigan pro-Trump Republicans say Biden’s police policies will push voters toward Trump
You have shown the American public who you are for 4 years.  The majority of America hates you with a passion. The debates will not change that.  Nothing will change that.  Biden could die and we are still voting you out
Biden lied a lot and said goofy things sometimes but nobody can say he was bad at public speaking, go watch any old video of him speaking in the Senate, he was a very component orator, better than many career politicians
I think anytime anyone tries to vote shame me to vote Biden, I'm just gonna reply with this:
RIDIN W/ BIDEN NIGGA
the second one is especially important to notice. "Obama-Biden" violently put down protest at Ferguson, Occupy, and Standing Rock, but they did it while making soothing speeches and without a new Fed paramilitary force. that's the "normal" to which Biden is promising to return
wE cAn PuSh BiDeN LeFt
Joe Biden watching the Axios interview like...
This is insulting to black people everywhere. They (Trump, Kanye, their teams) think black people are gullible and uninformed enough to vote for Kanye strictly because he's Kanye in hopes of splitting the ticket and taking votes away from Biden that never would've gone for Trump.
Prosecute every one of the accomplices for treason, dereliction of duty as sitting us senators, and the aiding in the deaths of over 200,000 Americans. Blood on their hands.  never forget, never forgive. Election 2020 BIDEN gop trials
Like you’ll get anything out of Biden winning. 😂
This is false. I guarantee it. Biden can’t complete whole sentences without burst of laugher and/or raspberries.
BWAAAAA HAAA HAAA HAAA HAAA  SO.....BIDEN HAD A 200% CHANCE TO WIN
Beside his age, could it be that Joe Biden’s mental decline be attributable to adrendachrome withdrawal? Also, has anyone notice how aged a lot of democrats are looking now that child trafficking is a focus for this administration?
2012, Joe Biden SPOKE WITH a fake Black accent &amp; told a gathering of blacks in Virginia that his OPPONENT would put y’all back in chains if elected. Same fake BLACK accent he used when he told black voters they ain’t black if they have any second thoughts about voting for him. 🤔
BIDEN RACISM FACTS  Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia,  was a Ku Klux Klan leader before becoming A DEMOCRAT SENATOR. Joe Biden brags about his fond memories of working with the old racist &amp; whenever he waxes poetic about him, he slips into a fake Southern accent.
Trump, Biden, TV ad dollars and get out the vote: MLive political reporter talks Michigan as a battleground state
Trump's clock would be kinda fucked up but in an unnatural way that you could tell he practiced it beforehand and then Biden's would have all the numbers crowded into one corner and he'd just insist it was fine and say something like "the presidency isn't just about penmanship"
CORRUPT DEMS want YOU to believe voting for PEDO JOE BIDEN is a solution to all the ills of a racist capitalist system, the fact remains that Biden is a dedicated, lifelong racist. Joe won’t save AMERICANS! Least of all ANY AMERICANS THINKING THEY R victims of police brutality.
"now that former VP Biden has finally confirmed he is indeed available to LEAVE HIS BASEMENT"...  TF kind of snarky ass comment is that? 🤣  Can't wait to watch the #TrumpTrain pull a BTTF Part III and careen right into Shonash Ravine
I'm a pretty good magician.   No seriously.  I made  and his lapdog dog walker  disappear 😂  I did Michigan a favor.  Now only if I can get rid of Trump and Biden. Then all would be well in the world.  😬
i need the drugs that are keeping joe biden alive in my veins. i need to feel that real again
It’s SAD how Black Americans R MANIPULATED BY CORRUPT DEMS INTO BELIEVING BIDEN  ISN’T A RACIST! THE BIGGEST FACT THAT IS MANIPULATED IS JOE BIDEN ISN’T RACIST BECAUSE HE WAS OBAMA’S V.P for 8YRS.! Wrong! Obama needed RACIST JOE FOR RACIST WHITE DEMS TO VOTE FOR A BLACK PRESIDENT
I have zero problem admitting Bernie isn't as sharp today as he was 20, 10, or even 5 years ago, but you'll note no ever felt the need to invent weird claims about "disability" and accuse people of ableism because it's not nearly as severe and rapid and Biden's decline
WHO’s RACIST!!🤔  Biden told the American people. “In a nutshell, the PRESIDENT’s plan does not include enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, enough prosecutors to convict them, enough judges to sentence them, or enough prison cells to put them away for a long time.”
Biden passed laws abolishing federal parole, bigger penalties for marijuana possession, &amp; established a 100-to-1 sentencing disparity for possession of crack cocaine used disproportionately by poor non white people &amp; powder cocaine used disproportionately by rich white people.
Biden's "verbal gaffes" used to mean putting his foot in his mouth, not struggling to complete a sentence or follow a coherent train of thought, it's just dishonest to deny he's different than he used to be, you worm, you absolute gullible clod
Will do when i vote for Biden nov 3rd
setting aside Biden's belligerent refusal of a cognitive fitness test, completely routine for a man his age (to say nothing of his apparent symptoms), why do I feel like this isn't the first time I've seen him shoutily suggest a Black man may be a drug addict for no reason?
DO YOU HOMEWORK AMERICA! AND ESPECIALLY BLACK AMERICANS! JOE BIDEN IS THE MOST RACIST POLITICIAN IN THE LAST 50 YEARS!  *Biden has worked tirelessly, for several decades, to make America’s profoundly racist criminal-justice system more punitive than any other advanced democracy’s
Joe Biden disagrees with you
Not Gretch out of Michigan and Biden will lose Michigan- I wonder if I can parlay that at a betting house
This is according to Joe Biden btw
I'm well aware of the propaganda efforts to obscure Biden's evident mental decline by talking about his childhood stutter, thanks
Joe Biden's stutter didn't persist into adulthood
he didn't have a stutter for decades. the reemergence of a childhood stutter is a symptom of the onset of dementia, the degenerative brain condition Biden is refusing to get tested for in this clip
this is literally gaslighting, I've been watching Joe Biden speak for my entire adult life, he *never* struggled like this until a couple years ago  meanwhile, the return of childhood stutter is itself a symptom of the onset of dementia, the condition he won't get tested for
trying to silence any acknowledgement of Biden's evident decline as "ableism" is actually very ableist since it normalizes the use of accusations of ableism as a rhetorical weapon to protect the powerful from reasonable scrutiny and criticism, discrediting the concept of ableism
RACIST JOE FACTS!   Biden said in a 1975, recently unearthed by the Washington Post. “What it says is, ‘In order for your child with curly black hair, brown eyes, &amp; dark skin to be able to learn anything, he needs to sit by my blond haired, blue eyed son.’ That’s racist!”  WOW!
Joe Biden helped kill the most effective policy for improving black educational attainment that America has ever known! Joe Biden was for desegregating America’s schools!!   Sound like RACISM ? 🤔  DON’T PLAY THE RACE CARD ON PRESIDENT TRUMP CORRUPT DEMS! You will lose BADLY!
Pedo Joe Biden described African-American felons as “predators” too sociopathic to rehabilitate” And describes white supremacist DEM SENATORS as friends!   CAN’T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS JOE! SORRY! YOU CAN’T CHILL WITH RACIST DEM SENATORS &amp; THEN TELL BLACK AMERICANS YOU LOVE THEM!
PEDO JOE Describes Obama in 2008!! 🤣 OK,JOE”s not RACIST? Right BLACK FOLKS!?  Barack Obama the “FIRST” mainstream African American who is articulate &amp; bright &amp; clean!   I guess Joe Biden had “NEVER” met “Any” smart, or “CLEAN” Black men in his lifetime ?! 🤣WOW! Sounds RACIST!
Joe Biden called statemandated school integration “the most racist concept you can come up with! Joe didn’t want his kids riding buses with BLACK KIDS!   SOUNDS RACIST TO ME BLACK AMERICANS!   DO YOUR HOMEWORK BLACK AMERICANS!   Pretty easy choice.   PRETTY MUCH A NO BRAINER!
Will Black Voters Still Love Pedo Joe Biden When They Remember Who He Was &amp; STILL IS ?  🤔   BTW, where’s video &amp; written documents of President Trump being a racist? 🤔   IS IT BECAUSE TRUMP SAID, KEEP OUT “ILLEGAL” immigrants? 🤔 YOU WANT ILLEGALS?  BETTER DO YOUR RESEARCH !
TRUMP 2020!! We do not need the Left Wing Nuts running our nation over the cliff to Socialism. Anyone who wants to live in a Socialist country is not a true American. Biden wants to raise our taxes! Why would you vote to give away more of your hard-earned money? #Trump2020
What’s your point Poindexter?  Stand for our flag?  Where is the flag in the Biden picture?  You are thick as a plank. I vote for B
Okay, I’ve noticed one thing about Biden and trump supporters.        Trump supporters your loud as hell and speak a lot of facts.                                 Biden supporters you guys are usually dumb as hell. And your only voting for him because he’s running against trump.
Even if THE RACIST BIDEN could or ever ATTEMPTED to “solve” racism in America, Joe Biden is laughable for that JOB!  Pedo Joe has spent his political life fighting for policies that make life worse for Black working-class Americans.
BIDEN 2014 RIOTS. Burning buildings, torching cars, destroying property, putting people at risk that’s destructive &amp; there’s no excuse for it. PEOPLE should be prosecuted for engaging in criminal acts. IS THAT RACIST FOR JOE TO SAY? THEY SAID TRUMP IS RACIST FOR THE SAME REMARKS!
Biden was an enthusiastic participant in this tradition through his friendship and fruitful working relationship with noted segregationist and vile racist Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina. They
Biden’s history of enthusiastic racism stretches back decades. From the moment he entered the U.S. Senate in the early 1970s, he vocally opposed busing to achieve school desegregation.  Who’s the RACIST?
Biden told Black Americans that if they did not automatically support him, “then you ain’t Black.” Who’s RACIST?
Joe Biden was forced to explain his racist comment about Indian Americans: “you cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I’m not joking!” WHO’s RACIST?
yeah, what happened to "Biden is the safe candidate because we can't count on Bernie's younger voters"? now all of the sudden we're absolutely essential to the extent we can make or break the election (but not important enough to get even minimal concessions)?  makes no sense
if there's an issue right now that's primed to move federally in a similar way right now it's marijuana legalization, but Biden reflexively opposes it and of course cops and pharmaceuticals generally hate it so 🤷‍♂️
You could have done so much more, beginning by holding the big banks accountable for 2008, but you did not. The Obama/Biden administration was the biggest missed opportunity of the nation's life. All for the sake of corporate donors. Shame!
what's your plan again? elect Biden, literally "the man from credit card" who kicked off his campaign at the home of Comcast's CEO, and then "push him left" by ????
Yes.  That's not the same argument. That is Joe Biden calling Democrats et al, decent.  I'm pretty sure we're of the same mind when it comes to Biden, so I'm not sure why you seem to be trying to call me out.
Joe Biden is not Barack Obama and there's no reason to expect his presidency, built as it will be on an open and aggressive rejection of the left (as opposed to pandering to it against the party "center"), to do anything other than attack us *hard*
How exactly do you propose we pressure Biden left? his whole deal is telling us to go fuck ourselves, always has been. and the Dem establishment are totally on board with that, clearly want to systematically push lefties out of the party. where's the pressure gonna come from?
ITS SAD HOW MOST BLACK AMERICANS R MANIPULATED &amp; BRAINWASHED BY CORRUPT DEMS! PEDO JOE BIDEN HAS 50YRS OF DOCUMENTED RACISM &amp; MOST OF IT IS ON VIDEO. CANDACE IS SO FUCKING SMART ! &amp; THANK GOD SHE HAS BLACK AMERICANS AWAKE &amp; SEEING WHATS REALLY GOING ON WITH THE LEFTIES CORRUPTION
as far as plans for change go, I have a few ideas, but it became clear enough to me they can't run through presidential electoralism when Bernie dropped out (certainly not this year and maybe never again)  what's your plan. "pull Biden left"?
We know that the latest postal union to back Biden was on June 9th, allb7 of the unions have backed Biden, and that they can't even get on congrestial primary right and it's been over a month.
Hmm. All 7 unions back back Biden
yep. Biden's nomination is, both actually and symbolically, a rejection of popular voting power. the entire gambit was to sideline us, make us irrelevant, reify corporate command of the party in the face of our challenge  and it worked. we lost. what more do people want from us?
my basic position is there's so many moving parts where there once was a Normal Democratic Process, combined with the fact Biden and the Dems aren't serious abt campaigning, there's not much sense strategizing. It's an elite power struggle now. It will be decided among the elite
“Bolton says he will 'write in somebody' rather than voting for Biden or Trump in 2020 election”  So he’s voting for Trump, then.
why do people think "you're killing vulnerable people if you don't vote for Biden" is a smart or remotely persuasive approach? all that induces in me is resentment and contempt
That's a reach. All the way back to the 80's. You guys are a joke. Trump lies all the time. He word vomits and contradicts himself in the same gdamn paragraph and never makes any sense. Biden could shoot somebody in the middle of 5th Av and I would still vote for him. #150000dead
I think Trump and Biden are both just wheels in a fucked up machine, i just think Biden is a better wheel.  If you agree hit like, If you disagree but respect my opinion comment 'respect'  Lets show the world we can agree to disagree.
Fun fact : Trump supporters and Biden supporters can like one another. Bring your war to the ballot November 3rd and respect your friends and family   ♥️
I feel a jig comin on
To his credit, this is the closest I've seen to anybody making an argument to vote FOR Biden, and not just against Trump.  It's still an incredibly weak argument, but at least he tried. 🤷‍♂️😂
I don’t love the fact that Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee but the Republican candidate is a blatant racist. November 3rd is an opportunity for us to prove that we’ve made any progress at all. It’s an opportunity to show that the work of John Lewis will be cherished forever.
My money's on  refusing to debate Biden.  Some in the media call for Biden not to debate Trump  #FoxNews
Obama the Kenyan made cages for kids so Democrat donors could pick from a wide menu. Obama and Biden likes kids rubbing their legs in pools.
but if biden passes from old age 🤔
I know exactly what's gonna happen if Biden wins and it's not any of this nonsense some people imagine about holding Trump's cronies accountable or "returning to normal"  oh no, they're coming for us
the Biden campaign is going to make "Pokemon Go to the polls" look like the Kennedy-Nixon debates
probably the only thing more delusional than Bob Avakian believing he can influence a presidential election is Bob Avakian believing that, to the extent it has any detectable effect at all, his endorsement could do anything other than hurt Biden and the left
Biden campaign will happily take the bait, calling it now
You got my vote Mr.Biden!!#
Joe Biden is 1000% percent much better. In fact there’s a homeless guy downtown Flint, MI that would be better...and he probably drank the water.
You SEE BIDEN HAS WAY MORE RACIST DIRT ON HIS HANDS! He is COVERED IN RACISM! Do your fucking HOMEWORK BLACK AMERICANS, ASIANS, INDIANS, ITALIANS &amp; MEXICANS! TRUMP SAID, NO “ILLEGAL” IMMIGRANTS! Don’t get played by the CORRUPT DEM LIB DIRTBAGS SELLING TRUMP RACIST NARRATIVES!
IS THERE ANY BLACK POSTAL WORKERS?   * Biden told Black Americans that if they did not automatically support him, “then you ain’t Black.”
How about this Racist stereotype about Italians ! Hmmm, ANY ITALIAN POSTAL WORKERS?   * Biden claimed he was taken out of context and then doubled down, claiming he would have said the same thing about Italian accents and delis. He didn’t apologize.
POSTAL WORKERS, ..ANY INDIAN POSTAL WORKERS NO ABOUT THIS?    🤔🤔🤔 Joe Biden was forced to explain his racist comment about Indian Americans: “you cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I’m not joking!”   OLD RACIST PEDO JOE!
Do they not know BIDEN has dementia? DO THEY KNOW BIDEN IS THE MOST RACIST CANDIDATE SINCE DEM GEORGE WALLACE? DO AMERICAN VOTERS (especially BLACK FOLKS) DO ANY RESEARCH ABOUT THIS OLD RACIST POS BIDEN? Seriously, it seems most Black American VOTERS R SO EASILY MANIPULATED!
Trump has nothing to do with Joe Biden being a pedophile. Y’all internet niggas is weird. Y’all would rather a pedophile be in office then someone who says stuff that you don’t like. 🙄
when you try to settle for Biden, make "settle for Biden" your whole politics, but wind up having to invent a fictional version of him anyway
can't wait for Biden's inauguration speech where he tells us "it's time to turn the page on the era of divisiveness" which of course will mean letting everyone off the hook
I will not automatically support Joe Biden's VP pick.  A female candidate must stand on her own record.  I am a progressive.  This election will be death for many, no matter who wins. This is primarily the fault of extreme right (Repugs) and center right (Corporcrats).
Democrats: "dangerous Donald is starting a second Cold War with China!"  also Democrats: "Donald Trump is weak on the despicable authoritarian genociders of China because he loves dictators. Joe Biden won't let them push us around!"
As someone who lives in Michigan this is extremely patronizing and ridiculous because it says nothing about how Biden voted for NAFTA
She ain’t wrong here...those violent mfkers in the streets are absolutely Joe Biden’s America 😐😐😐.  Think about what she is openly admitting 😳
That’s part of the reason why Biden’s VP pick to so crucial.  If he picks someone with enough Progressive cred then it will be a signal that he’s going to move more to the left than he has been in the past.  If it’s not the right pick he will have a hard time with the Left.
What’s also dumb that he would think the biden supporters would even show up to this event glorifying him =.= they at home trying hard to not want to slap u to the damn moon
Fuck Joe Biden
Fuck Joe Biden
I suppose you believe Biden/Sanders to be Communists?  What a sad and sorely misguided statement. That’s demonizing as I see it and illustrates exactly what’s wrong with the Right.
Misquote corrected : "Joe Biden is trying to take away your covefe"
I’ve had the same thoughts, but I will not compromise my conscience. I will not vote for Trump or Biden.  Perhaps that means the libertarians get my vote or I write someone in, that part I haven’t figured out.

For me it's not even about Biden. I don't hate him. But I'm thinking about RBG. She's holding on so hard. And people in departments that have no business being there like Bitch DeVos. Or the new post master. We know Biden isn't malicious.
which dem president balanced his budget and left a surplus for the next one?  Clinton. who had 8 years of positive growth, no scandals, saved the auto industry and gave us afforded able healthcare?  that`s right a black man. Obama Biden was vp then.
You could also ask the Dems, are you voting for Biden or against Trump.  Most would say against Trump.
WTF!  is suffering from amnesia and dementia? In his latest appearance, Joe Biden forgets where he is and then tries to laugh it off, hoping people will forget what just happened. This man is not competent enough to be running this country.
am i supposed to be surprised  the FBI would endorse Joe Biden?
I love how these anti-Biden commercials from this conservative pac start off saying there's a reason he's never been president, like he wasn't vice president for 8 years
And come January we won’t have him any more...💙💙💙💙 Biden 2020!!!
I'm on record as saying if Biden wins this virus will magically disappear but if Trump wins we'll somehow have a "2nd wave"

No Trump cut a deal to get out of it Now he exposed it That's y he wants to delay the election He not scared of losing to Biden He's playing his role to find children many who r ADOS lineage I've been on this story since 2013
Your comment has nothing to do with the tweet you're responding to, or the one it's responding to. You just seem obsessed with Trump, and any criticism of him must be met with an attack on his enemies- in this case, Joe Biden and black people.
I just feel like Biden election ads should just be images of the federal stormtroopers arresting American citizens and throwing them in unmarked vans, then cut to him saying - that will never happen while I am President.  Hard to top that as a statement.
How you figure? There's STILL gonna be a Dem candidate in Nov. if Biden drops out. Ideally, it would be the candidate in 2nd place (&amp; note: he would win with high numbers). But we know how the DNC works... it would be a right wing dem by their choice. So it would change nothing.
he’s right!  Joe Biden!!!
Joe Biden will restore unity and dignity to the collapse of the empire
There are zero circumstances under which Biden, or any Democratic leaders, would be inclined to agree - half inclined or otherwise. Zero.

Definitely.   I went third-party last time, but it's very different this time around.  But I wouldn't judge those who couldn't put their name next to Biden.   I guess anyway you go I can understand your reasonings..
Question to All Democratic Biden Followers? If Joe Biden knew How To Fix America Why Didn’t He Tell Obama???
Stop shaming people for considering third party candidates.  That's not how freedom works.  It's not a vote for Biden. It's not a vote for Trump.  That's not how voting works.  Do your research. Select the best candidate. Leave other people alone. And then vote.
Biden pushed for gay marriage. I really don’t care to fight with someone I’d rather have a conversation with
I shouldn't be surprised a conservative PAC is running commercials calling Joe Biden untrustworthy when the current conservative president is doing the shadiest and most untrustworthy shit imaginable...
not like it would be the first time Biden collapsed as the actual voting approached  I still expect him to win though
If Joe Biden isn't willing to compromise, then voters shouldn't be expected to.

Here's something of substance: rich democrat leaders making Biden the nominee will remain rich whether he wins or not. They don't care about those less fortunate then them, they'll never go against the interests of their corporate donors. So, yeah. Vote against the oligarchy.

His plan would still cover more Americans than Trumps. Also Trump is presiding over the worst exonomic decline in our nations history since the great depression (+40mill) so im pretty sure Biden beats Trump on “trade” as well.
I would hop across the Sahara on one foot while eating saltines to vote Biden.
From the same polling firm that had Hillary up by double digits before the 2016 election. Doesn't say if they polled just anyone, or likely voters, and the article doesn't give the breakdown of Dems vs Reps polled, so it's worthless other than to make people believe Biden is up.

There is a pandemic. And apparently TikTok is the greatest threat to America now.  What the fuck else do you need, to see how fucking delusional Trump is? Maybe him saying Joe Biden can hurt God? Maybe him boasting about his lack of wall? How about helping dismantle the USPS?

Biden is not worthy of any vote.
My dream is that Dems ditch Biden and nominate Andrew Cuomo, in a brokered Zoom convention.   For no other reason than watching  Maria  and  lip-synch the presidential debates would be the best thing ever.
Biden criticizes the black community for not being tolerant and diverse, and also says he is going to pick a black vice-president based on skin color and gender.  He is a classic white Democrat. Racist to his very core.
I am voting for Joe Biden but the fact it’s a vote against Trump is a welcome fringe benefit. Trump isn’t going to win. You underestimate just how hated he is. Democrats are not going to make the same mistakes of 2016. Hell even the GOP is abandoning him in droves.

For me getting Trump out and bullying Biden further left seems a lot less harmful than burning it all down. But hey to each their own
What exactly is your end goal here? Are you one of those Bernie or Bust accelerationists who thinks if we burn it all down we will make progress faster? What is it really? Politics takes time. Coalition building takes time. Biden can be pulled left but a fascist like Trump cant
He wont gas peaceful protestors he wont upend 230 protections for private content creators Biden will decriminalize marijuana and expunge nonviolent drug offenders, biden will end private prisons, do I need to go on or are you just going to go with “I’ll believe it when I see it”
I was a Bernie guy too but even I can see the importance of getting Trump out in November  This stupid wokescoldy nonsense of trying to out left each other is childish. Vote the fascist out and bully Biden to the left while he’s in office. Pretty fuggin simple
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
im going to launcugh my ass if kanye wins he wouldn't know what to do
After experiencing a “perfect” president, I’ll take an imperfect and willing to admit it #Biden any day.
It’s crazy that Republicans see Biden as far left or Socialist. The knock against Joe from many Democrats is he’s too moderate. Biden a Socialist. 🤣
I just saw a Trump commercial criticizing Biden for bragging about his IQ....Ironic much Don?
Hey there Biden tweet minion. How bout you try repeatedly hitting the center autofill button. It'll make just about as much sense.
Joe Biden...  -Officiated a gay 'wedding' -Supports the pro-LGBT 'Equality Act' -Wants to force the Little Sisters of the Poor to provide contraceptives -Stands 100% with Planned Parenthood  Yet we're suppose to beleive he's a 'devout' Catholic?
Who knew Biden could be so powerful.
But when Joe Biden said Trump hasn’t ever read the Bible how is this different? No factual base, one mans opinion.
The color brown is racist, but Biden, he's a real civil rights activists.  Have you guys been checked for Asperger syndrome?  I'm serious.
Most of them is majority. Among my friends 100% have doubled down 😑 and I've never seen anyone say I voted third party this time I won't or I didn't vote last time I will this time. I just see a lot of if you vote for Biden your voting for the status quo that gave us Trump
Compare the candidates? There is no comparison. Biden is a man of integrity and intellect. Trump is an ignorant cesspool of hatred. We don’t need debates to highlight this even further.  But if you really want it...
Biden hates the Bible. Right......
This is why white guys hate talking about race, the conversation is a god damn mine field, say the wrong thing &amp; its the guillotine for you. There is nothing Biden can say thats on a par with Trump for bigotry.  We can litigate Biden or we can defeat trumpism.
Biden is for infanticide.
I hope God is ready for Biden. #hurt
The veneer on Biden slips all the time and he gets away with it every time. Not a single republican could get away with saying “poor kids are just as smart and talented as white kids”
President Biden should play this dementia clip of Donald trump at every event until the very day Biden is sworn in.
BREAKING: Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has chosen JonBenet Ramsey as his VP for the 2020 election.
Does Trump realize how many conservative Irish Catholics live in Midwest swing states? It’s well known Biden’s Catholic.
If Biden wins, will he be President Vice President Biden?
Joe Biden can hurt God?  best you just give up now. If Biden can hurt God imagine what he will do to you.
Are you ever going to even mention Biden?  LOL- you jerks!
Covid would have to take Biden, the DNC, most of the Democrat leadership, and the stock market would have to crash, with bankers and stockbrokers leaping out of skyscrapers in despair, shortly before a hurricane destroyed New York City.
Trump continues to hype up Biden more than anyone else could
Where are the crowds, holding Biden flags, and chanting "USA, USA?" 🤔
Joe Biden did not write this tweet, he’s feeble and demented. You saw and heard the real Joe when he said the black community was not diverse!
Where are the crowds, holding Biden flags, and chanting "USA, USA?" 🤔
So when trump misspeaks it’s lack of intelligence when Biden does “people make mistakes” got it.
Again Biden is not perfect but he’s not a fucking fascist like Trump. Lets get the fascist out of the white house first and then we can bully Biden to the left all we want mkay??
Oh god not this again. Call me once Biden ignores science and kills hundreds of thousands of private citizens, or gasses peaceful protestors, or abducts and black bags Portlanders. Talk to me once Biden goes after 230 protections for indy content and threatens free speech.
She is crazy if she thinks it will fly. Just distracting from the point that biden can't debate.
Looks like many will be disappointed with Biden's VP pick. You know who won't be? The GOP. Because they can see that everyone will be pissed and crying. If you choose to take your ball home, because you didn't get your way, please go fuck yourself. This election is too important.
Its pretty simple dude:  People like Krystal Ball and Kyle Kulinski argue that Biden and Trump are the same on economic policy. Though this is true to a certain extent this is a class reductionist framing as it ignores all the racist social policies Trump will implement cometerm2
Do you think Kyle Kulinski doesn’t engage in class reductionist language? He spent months trying to convince his extremely white audience that Biden and Trump were the same. Are you joking? You made the claim class reductionism isn’t real and so far youve done nothing to defendit
Theyre gonna say Biden understands and sympathizes with the citizens grief and can lead the public to heal. Do they sympathize with the VULNERABLE ELDERLY and their families that this affected? BEFORE OR AFTER DEMS LOOKED FOR IMMUNITY ON PUTTING SICK PATIENTS IN WITH HEALTHY?
And I hear class reductionist say identity politics/race is a distraction all the time. Look at channels like KyleKulinski who monetize their white privilege by saying straight up asinine things like Biden = Trump. I agree Biden’s not perfect but to be so racist as to say they =?
Biden could pick a jar of botulism-laden green mayonnaise and he would get my vote.
…invest in environmental justice, protect the environment &amp; our national security, create jobs &amp; boost economic growth. Wyoming needs Joe Biden!
I try to stay out of politics on social media but how tf are there 330 million people in this country and the best options we could come up with for president are Trump and Biden. There HAS to be someone out there with a brain.
Wait until Biden says he sympathizes with the citizens and understands and can help them all heal. AFTER ALL THE DEMS GO FOR IMMUNITY AFTER PUTTING INFECTIOUS DISEASE PATIENTS IN WITH HOUSED VULNERABLE ELDERLY.
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?
Theyre trying to say Biden relates to the public because of grieving and that he could lead public to recovery.Time to show the public that Trump not only sympathized but took action. Trump lead the way healing America. Cold shoulder Biden &amp; his "C'mon man" doesnt scream sympathy
A debate with you will only increase Biden’s lead. You going down.
Joe Biden will hurt God?   Donald Trump already did that when he hijacked God's followers as his own.
Trump not even remotely rational. If Biden is president he’ll hurt the Bible and hurt God?! Gee, maybe you should pick up a Bible and read it and get a clue who God is. Gonna go out on a limb and say that no worldly leader can hurt God. Also, Biden is openly a believer 🤦🏼‍♀️
and you know biden will push defund the police.
Eat your heart out #Democrats #CNN #Biden #Acosta
Here in Wyoming we call no brains Biden SLOPPY JOE
Hey all, pastor Dave here, let me assure you of this: God will be completely unharmed should Biden win the election.
Yells at it?  Ooh, I need someone to do the 'yelling woman : confused cat' meme, but with Biden and a bible!
I think you need to reread what he said before you start attacking him. He’s making fun of Biden...
"Devout" is without a doubt the least accurate way to describe Joe Biden's religious beliefs
1: this is a sound bite, did any of you watch the full video ?    2: Trump says, and has said 20 times worse, so as far as I'm concerned it's Biden or no one.    3: if you don't vote, you voted for Trump... Thankyou and have a good day.
Ask Joe Biden where it is and then ask him to say if he lied to Congress.
can we just start calling him "Woah Biden" yet
The NRA destroyed itself. The fascist right that it and you represent is crumbling. I will continue to own my gun responsibly, along with the pistols my grandfather took from Nazis during WWII. The only thing that will be taken away when Joe Biden wins is you. Good riddance.
No Joe Biden has to be lead around like a baby. Can not get his facts right.
A vote for Biden isn’t a vote for Biden. He’s a transitional figure. If you vote Biden, you’re voting for his VP choice.
Joe Biden Says He Will Stop Building Border Wall, Supports Health Care For Illegal Aliens (VIDEO)   But Jill Biden says #DementiaJoe is a moderate.   If this is what a moderate Democrat looks like God save us from the progressives
Um. He didn't say he was voting for Biden. He may write in Jesus for all we know.
Oh, you forgot Biden has sexual assault accusations hah.
Close my eyes and circle his name. I swear outside of hate for Trump there’s no way anyone can honestly but comfortable with Biden lol.
When you defeat Joe Biden?
God help us all if this woman is even *potentially* within a heartbeat of the Presidency.
Biden cannot debate and he will not debate.  I guarantee it.  He's barely functional and he needs a lot of sleep.
Nope Biden does this
I agree with you Ryan. Both candidates are too old. It blows my mind that younger, better candidates have not emerged considering it's now clear that 74 year old Trump has no chance of making America great again and Biden is 77 years old.
Trump: All African Americans will support me because Biden said they are monolithic.
The  choice is Clear but it is surprising how many people will cut their own nose off to spite their  face . The brainwashed liberal controlled Media continues to spout drivel about Trump and Ignore the Facts about Biden/Obama , Clinton , the Washington Swamp Cabal Pedos +more !
Who would EVER vote for Trump because Biden picked the wrong woman.  This is a tell on how loony SE Cupp is.
This is perfect for Biden
How good of a job Biden is doing,cleaning up tRump's mess and all the magaT's crying about the election being rigged.

Honestly Joe Biden throwing hands with the Lord would be pretty cool. Maybe it can be part of the Tyson card.

Joe Biden unable to answer softball questions and media's silence is 'mind-blowing,' says Sarah Sanders #SmartNews
Revolutionary change can’t happen if we continue to vote in the “lesser evil” of the candidates. Joe Biden is a republican who doesn’t support M4A. He is openly racist and predatory. I don’t see a less evil candidate, I see two very evil rich white men with nothing to offer.
Any critics of the DNC and Biden platform are accused of being a Trump supporter.  It's a reflex at this point.  It's the "fake news" of the Dems.
Biden is a practicing Catholic. When was the last time Trump even went to Church?
I have been waiting a year for the Trump/Biden debates and now I’m pretty sure they won’t happen.
Biden has never done anything for the American People. It’s been about his own and his family’s enrichment while advancing the Leftist agenda.  He won’t start doing the right thing all of a sudden
...laying on the DNC floor while they gathered his scattered votes and handed them to Biden. Seeing that, was Yang, an almost unknown newbie, supposed to take on the whole Democrat establishment? Or find a way to work with or around it?
Democrats planted false stories in effort to derail Biden investigations, Grassley says #SmartNews
It looks like to me like if you are counter-establishment you are going to have to do some pro establishment things if you're going to get anything done at all. Yang endorsed Biden. What other choices did he have? Bernie looked like he was soon to be nothing but a burnt out....
But Biden is brain dead! I'm voting Green or for Kanye.
It’s obvious she’s voting for Biden. Heaven help us all! 🙁
Joe Bigot Biden is a good nickname for him!
I'm not surprised by too much these days ,after all the stuff Biden has been involved in the past 30 years , why is anybody wondering about him choosing a Black Widow Spider for a running mate , or whoever ,whatever ?
So it sounds like Joe Biden’s knowledge of Hispanics is limited to those featured on TV the Californian Mexican, the New YorRican, and the Cuban.
Michigan pro-Trump Republicans say Biden’s police policies will push voters toward Trump
I don’t need to hear your babbling blather and bs to know I’m voting for Biden.
Great to see.  Slam the DNC though. Not just Biden, but continue exposing his weakness's..   Country needs to see Cities like Minneapolis, Portland, San Francisco, such chaos with refunding police . Older crowds hates that idea.. for sure to get votes.
um pretty sure people who are voting that early for Biden are NOT going to change their minds after 3.5 years of a disaster bc of one debate. 🤔
Does anyone believed we’ll see the Durham Report? If not presented before the election and Biden wins it will be buried so deep we’ll never know the truth. Why is it taking so long. Curious it stays in the background.
IMO Biden should announce a "team of rivals" cabinet
Showing your tax returns is a public service, if Biden can show his, you can show yours ! Or are you hiding something?
I could have told you that.  Even with all their cheating and interference, Biden will win.
trump called Ted Cruz wife ugly. He called Marco Rubio little Marco. trump gave out Lindsey Graham's phone number and all of them suck his ass now. Harris pointing out a fact to Biden hardly compares in the scheme of things.
The fact that Biden vs Trump is going to be the election tells you all you need to know. A man who helped write a crime bill that wrongfully locked up millions of black men vs Donald Trump. And they are still spewing that “lesser of two evils” shit.
CHEATER'S!!
Instagram insists 'bug' that negatively affected Joe Biden was 'not partisan'
Does this suggest they found someone else in the basement with Biden?
Biden can accept his nomination from his basement where he’s been holed up for months, but Trump can’t deliver his speech from where he’s spent the past three plus years? Are you guys insane - he’s the President, leave him alone and let him lead - what is everyone so afraid of?
You use the same talking points about biden and how he's so racist that everyone uses. That doesn't make you smart. It makes you lazy. Trump has been getting sued for discrimination at his apartments in the 90s where he did not want blacks living,  i could post a million articles
Beyond bizarre. Why did the Democrats select Biden from a field of so many better candidates? It is sad watching Joe's demise play out everytime he is on camera. He really isn't capable of being the president. .    Find a new candidate. .
No hoopla: Coronavirus upends Trump, Biden convention plans
That's real👌 Maybe they should do some polling in the mainland. Not that seeing the poll numbers from George Costanza Land / Bizarro Upside Down World isn't a great entertainment value. Building up Biden's chances, then bashing the lefties dreams will make for many yummy tears.
so that’s why you were so horrible to attny General Barr. You and your husband took $700,000 from Ukrainian thugs connected to Biden. Tiktok
Nobody ever changed their mind based on any presidential debate. Everyone knows who Trump is. Everyone knows that Biden is not Trump.
My primary home is in SA TX ... and will fly/drive there to VOTE FOR BIDEN!!!!
You are crazy! No rational person would vote for #GroperJoeBiden. If you think President Trump did anything to hurt America, you are getting your information from the wrong place. Biden is the epitome of the corrupt DC establishment. He can't even complete a sentence.
I've had it with both parties.  I'm voting Kanye or Green.  I'm not sure which, but Biden is just another Trump.

I'll say this much about Biden:  Love that he's a GM guy. Firebird and a 'Vette.
I would not get to carried away. I would agree this election will be the most important in all of our lives, but in my opinion, Biden is running his campaign smoothly and without too many "things" going on that Trump can try to smear on. Voting equality is my bigger priority.
Trump picked Pence on July 15, 2016 Hillary Clinton picked Kaine on July 22, 2016 Romney picked Ryan on August 11, 2012 McCain picked Palin on August 29, 2008 Obama picked Biden on August 23, 2008  Pretty average time line to me...
President Joe Biden. Question; you think he will show up for Biden being sworn in in Jan 2021?
You play the hand you are dealt.   And, keep in mind, it's not just a president but it is also the people that surround him.    Biden will have a great team.
Barr wouldn't stand for it. He would fire all of them to protect 45 from it! I hope Biden puts someone in that will investigate all the BS Barr has done!
But Biden is scared and cognitively impaired.
Biden is honestly pretty physically fit for his age
I think no matter what happens in November the right loses unless we coalesce and stand together. Trump/house/senate=left loses their minds even more. Biden wins we all lose.
Dr.Jill Biden PLEASE think Bigger Picture for the party and pick  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think the Republicans think their party is shot to hell and won't be held to account for anything anyway so it's a free for all like drunken sailors on shore leave, but they will have to sober up sometime and realize what they have done either with Biden or no democracy.
I don't even see the point of Biden debating him. After he crushes him, tRump will lie about what was said or who won, even with the whole world watching. That's what this 🤡 does. He lies about 💩 that is on tape for the whole world to see.
If you hate a politician so much that you are rooting against a vaccine, I fear for you.  If you love a politician so much that you won't wear a mask despite what doctors and scientists say, I fear for you.   Maybe try principles in place of politics.  EVERYONE. #Trump #Biden
If it was a Biden motorcade, you’d see Antifa flags flying.
Joe Biden loves dogs!
No debates at all until trump releases his tax returns!   He has gotten away with this for too long.   Release as many years of tax returns as Biden has and then they can discuss the debates.  Trump wants the debates because he wants the spotlight.
100% agree with this!   The entire party needs to push this though.   It won’t hurt Biden at all but it will drive trump crazy since he loves to be on stage.
Joe Biden is a blatant liar, or hes senile and doesn't remember. #TrumpLandslide2020
Trump, Biden, TV ad dollars and get out the vote: MLive political reporter talks Michigan as a battleground state
So if I vote 3rd party this year, am I voting for Trump, or am I voting for Biden? Which party making the claim has it right, and which party has it wrong?
Untrue, and illogical. 3rd party vote is 3rd party vote, no more, no less.  GOP: 3rd Party vote really a vote for Biden! Dems: 3rd Party vote really a vote for Trump!  They can't both be true. It's just a line both parties use to manipulate you into accepting the status quo.
Stop making shit up, i never said i support Trump but if i had to pick Biden or Trump then i would vote for Trump. We don't need the military, tell me a country that is showing an intent to attack us by coming at our direction?. You're brainwashed by the media.
Biden is a complete joke. No rational person would vote for Joe Biden.

Joe Biden is ALSO the antithesis of everything I stand for. He's just Trump with an extra sprinkle of human rights. We had Barack Obama for 8 years, a Democrat who campaigned on "Change" - nothing actually changed. Why do you believe this will be any different?
This fits exactly w my conversations of the state campaigns. Team Trump is including door-to-door in their voter contacts. Was just told today by Team Biden that they are not.

Not to say I enjoy or support Biden at all, he sucks, Trump sucks, this election is shit
"Republicans for Biden"   "Republican Vets Against Trump"   Trump is a Disease and his drivel is driving away anyone who pays even a little
I’ll believe it when I see it. His handlers are cowards, but keep challenging Biden’s ego and he’ll debate.
Biden's bots and tweet writers are staggeringly wrong on everything. Now imagine if it was actually Biden tweeting, answering questions, interviewing or generally anything that requires going outside. How bad is this crap? Where are the moderate Dems? #savetheparty

Joe Biden won't travel to Milwaukee for 2020 DNC because of coronavirus concerns This is crazy!
I'd prefer Biden do more interviews, but in this dystopian hellscape we call politics in America the best strategy seems to be let Trump speak unimpeded &amp; hope that people can figure out he has the critical thinking skill of a houseplant.
Remember during the Democratic primaries, a bunch of "leftists" shouted how they would never vote for Bernie if he got the nomination?  Their reason being that the toxic "Bernie-bros" ruined the movement for them.  I don't see these people calling out the toxic Biden bros...weird
Uh, Biden's point was that taking a test given to people who suffered a major closed head injury is as insulting as someone asking a black news anchor to pass a drug test. The point is of course he's not a junkie and asking him to take a drug test would be insulting.
I love how the GOP is so racist they think putting a black person on the ballot will stop Biden from winning...as if African Americans are not smart enough to see beyond this.
I think he should put someone in charge of it then he can take control of what else needs to be done. I believe  will have the best people in charge &amp; not just yes man that bow to him over the American People like 45 does!
If Ranked Choice Voting existed, I'd be marking  as my top choice.  Unfortunately, we still need to get to the point where that is how we vote, leaving me voting for Biden. I would be happy to join a #Libertarian effort to make it happen at the state level.

Biden will.
Biden needs to do a commercial on the school like Trump did on the police: "I'm sorry. We can't take your child today at school. Mrs. Nelson contracted the virus and has died. Due to a shortage of funding and health concerns, we are unable to secure a substitute teacher..."

Are you going to be the HNIC if Biden gets elected? I totally could see you giving Joe a pudding pop and sending him off to a back room with his favorite TV program while you strike deals selling us out to China.
Basically he may care enough about America that he doesn't want Biden because he knows that will mean the end of us as we know it. He is still number one in importance to him but maybe we are number 2. Meh. I have lukewarm support of him as a human but for the good of US he wins.

You over shot your ask. 😉
You’re not a biden supporter, you’re a supporter of democracy and all things left. Rome wasn’t built in one day
Yes the DNC is corrupt, yes things are changing, yes Bernie should’ve been the nominee, yes biden isn’t our ideal candidate, but we have to work with what you got. It’s what people like you don’t understand
Y’all better vote for biden regardless, he’s the better of both evils
The Democrat strategy is to keep Biden under wraps so that in effect the election is between Trump and a generic Democrat. That way voters can project whatever they want onto Biden, replacing this flawed candidate with their own imagination of a competent one. #Biden2020
Noticed driving today that I see political signs for local candidates but not even one for either Trump or Biden. Seems odd... too early? do you usually get them at events/places canceled by covid?
As an AMERICAN, I could never vote for Joe Biden.
These Biden Tweets are getting better.
Yea, weirdly enough being belittled and berated DIDN'T make me feel super energized about voting for the Dem candidate back in 2016.  Perhaps bullying your voter base in 2020 will get em fired up to vote Biden!  Dems have a low bar to jump when everyone votes lesser of two evils.
An advisor would be like a ventriloquist and a guide would be like a marionette. Trump has people blowing smoke up his ass while Biden has someone else pulling all the strings.

Biden probably thinks he's actually in Yosemite now.
To be able to say they gave airtime to his campaign just as they have Biden's.
I used to be a Trump supporter before and after the election the main reason I don't fully support him is because of how the taxes are higher for the poor and lower for the rich. He's not the worst in anyway, I know he cares about the country. Some Biden pics are creepy af.
I seem to be forgetting. Remind me again when Joe Biden allowed 150,000+ Americans to die.

Right? This picture of the democratic office looking fresh outta the 20th century is a staple throughout Wyoming or other rural areas, which is unfortunate but it is also not the outreach Biden needs to win. I think Michael just likes to lament.
You know what else is "pathetic"  , not voting !! Your choices are for one of two candidates and if you can't vote for one (Trump) and "choose" not to vote for the other (Biden) then your "non-vote" becomes in favor of Trump. But, you, of all ppl "KNOW THIS" !! WTF!
Biden does not have to debate at all, we seen how the IT debates and it's truly disgusting...The Donald does not even answer the questions asked and never has...Wonderful, Bigly, Beautiful, Amazing, HUGE, Fake news, People say, People telling me...LIAR, LIAR, GUILTY, GUILTY...
All he has to do is talk and he provides more fodder for Democrats to use against him. Especially after he made fun of Biden for having trouble remembering/finding words.
Biden 2020, or Bye Don, 2020.
Biden’s a snowflake. Never been taken to the wood shed. That’s why his masters don’t want home to debate. Obvious
But Biden is the one that’s losing it lol.
Point taken. Wish Haberman would point out equal gaffes by Biden. So so many. It's actually disturbing.
Go watch Biden read. Then get back to me. Thanks. A stumble over a word is normal normal normal.
I am sitting right here in MI USA trying to control my nerves.I have gotten PTSD from this experience.I am praying to the gods or whatever that america makes it thru!I am voting Biden no doubt,so there’s that,but with the post office shit and god knows the stuff we don’t know yet
Yeah, they kinda are. I made a funny comment about his misread. Why can't it just be funny? instead Haberman wants to pretend it means something, while ignoring Basement Biden who can't even speak on his own.
I am wondering why same scrutiny is not given to Basement Biden. Who can't even string three words together. LOL.
Oh, I see. Only president's cannot make a mistake when reading aloud. Got it. Maybe watching one of those basement Biden broadcasts and get back to me.
Ah, I guess that means he just can't be president anymore. If you mispronounce a word, you're done. Better keep an eye on Biden, can barely read the cue cards when he 'answers' a 'random' question.
Thanks for reminding me why I’m voting for Biden😂😂
I’m so excited to hear #Biden’s VP pick!!!    During the celebration 🎉  the BS will start SO   🔹Practice with me ~ “What a sexist,  misogynistic comment!!” (Some folks will need a definition)😠🔹
You mean Durhams Report on OBAMA SPYING on Trump. Yup OBAMA &amp; Biden should be in JAIL.
I stg if they pass mail in votes, Biden will win and our country is going to look like Cuba within the next 5 years.. watch. DONT LET THEM TURN THIS COUNTRY INTO A SOCIALIST SHOT HOLE!
Tucker: In a normal year, Biden's VP options wouldn't be qualified
Gutfeld on Biden ducking the debates
It’s like a wildfire asking for more matches. Biden should do ALL THE DEBATES.
Like Biden?
“If Joe Biden debates, he’s just gonna sound like a blathering idiot!” -Midwest Dads
It’s because Biden has no chance in Hell to win the debate. He’ll look so stupid that they will do anything in their power to stop the debate.
If you picture a debate between Biden and Pres. Trump as your grandparents talking, you would immediately demand they be put into a home.
This show gave me a sense of balance that I fear I won't feel again until Biden's inauguration.
Hey, Biden intern, hope you’re getting paid enough to do this. Might wanna ask for a raise.
Joe Biden can’t wipe his own Ass let alone write his own tweets.
NOW THIS IS BULLSHIT YOU LOOSE GO HOME TAKE IT LIKE IT MAN NOT LIKE SOME POWER AND CONTROL FREAK. YOUR NOT ABOVE THE LAW AND YOU NEED TO SEE THAT. YOU KNOW TRUMP YOUR POLES WOULDN'T BE LOW IF YOU JUST DID A MONTHLY 2000 STIMULUS NO EXCEPTIONS END OF STORY
Communist Party Leader Endorses Joe Biden for President  via
Because if Biden wins, future elections will be stacked so you won’t have a choice anymore.
You’re right, Biden.
Attacking Biden by attacking a successful black woman. I see you.
Better than Biden
Biden Says He Can't Wait To Find Out Who He Picked For VP  via  Campaign aides say it's been Biden's most anticipated event since he found out he was running for president a few weeks ago.
Joe Biden not debating will so easily be spun into a story about him not being mentally capable enough to debate. It can and will backfire immensely
yes, they got their tax cuts so they're now moving to the 'we have to look at the debt' part of the GOP platform ready to try and hamstring the Biden recovery plan
Well if these sheeple want to follow Joe pedo Biden then civil war is eminent
Nov. 4th, Biden will too.
Not lie 20 000 times for starters?  Even if all Biden did were to end the shit show, wouldn't that be something?
Trump Will Win  Biden Will Whine  Just Like Hillary
Yes, we will. Who is writing them? It sure ain’t Biden.
Biden never did anything in 47 years for Americans
It's Trump be a landslide.  Stick a fork in Biden.  He's done.
Biden. Your a pussy Bitch Debate
Ha! That is good. You know, if Biden wins (he won't) most of the corrupt Obama gang will be back on the payroll in his administration. I'm sure Hillary will get one of the best jobs. It would be sickening.  . 🇺🇲 #Trump2020 🇺🇲 #KAG 🇺🇲 #ColoradoForTrump 🇺🇲 #StopMarxistDemocrats 🇺🇲
If I was a Democrat I would be upset with this choice, Biden is not capable and I cannot believe they are putting the party through this painful experience and embarrassment. Drop out Joe
Its not that we don’t hear much from Biden, it’s that this is about how often you should be hearing statements from a president. Trump has skewed our perception. A president shouldn’t dominate every news story and social media feed 24/7 with their statements.
Dude, Joe biden is just as bad. Also Trump did more then Obama did in 4 years then the 8 years Obama was in office. That's a fact, I remember when that was trending.
The Swamp is So Embedded  Could easily Complete its Liberal Mission Without A President Or A Cabinet  HRC &amp; Bummer/Biden Made Sure of That
And then lie and say it was Biden that got it squashed.
All too foreseeable. If Biden won’t debate, Trump will hammer him on that point until Election Day.
And knowing that any differences I have with a Biden Administration will most likely be concerning policy as opposed to core tenets of American ideology. The buffoon we have now has no empathy, dignity, integrity, or honor. I despise it daily.
DISTRACTION NUMBER 3  Trash talking Biden.
Believe it or not...i saw a Biden yard sign here in Cheyenne
And thank you - it appears we just found a running partner  for Biden that’s dumb as a five year old. Congratulations - Hillary will be waiting for you at the finish line for losers.
Biden just did a string of debates. Trump can’t even do a soft ball interview without embarrassing himself, his family, the entire  and the country.
Well what do you really expect from the  Racist Party! The  have become so disgusting! Between the racist hate, the traitor action, it's just time to vote all  out! Just disgusting all the way around! So Sad!
Women will literally go with whatever a confident man says.  As an experiment, I convinced my girlfriend that she should vote for Biden.  Last week, during her weekly testing, I dumped her for supporting Biden.
Biden doesn't have to stand up to Russia or China... He's their puppet! (please don't tell me that you don't know!)
LOL. Thats funny.  Biden can't even handle a press conference with reporters he has in his back pocket throwing snowballs questions him.  He can't handle a 1 on 1 conversation with notes to jog his mushy brain.
This Michigander is going to vote for Trump because Biden believes in killing the unborn, stealing your hard earned money by increasing taxes, and disgregarding the science of biology as mere fiction.
Will Biden debate Trump?
This is great! Incoherent Idiot Wastes Hour of Everyone’s Life Reminding Them Why They Should Vote for Biden
No. We don't. We know Trump will simply lie and blather and we know Joe Biden knows his shit. It will be a boring as hell debate. One's too many.
Just Asking For A Friend  Where Were The Union Lobbyist When Clinton Biden Obamma Were Sending Our Jobs Over Seas?  Please? If You want To Give Special Treatment to Unions You Dont Stand with Entrepreneurs
Just keep playing on Biden’s ego. Sooner or later he’ll debate due to his hubris.
J. Biden is a lier he will not protect you but will hand you over to his bosses.
Interesting that he was one of the 3 GOP officials who agreed with Biden to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor.  I wonder why the change of heart? 🙄
Just keep playing on Biden’s ego. Sooner or later he’ll debate due to his hubris.

It’s the reason Biden attracted African Americans over 50. They didn’t have the same costs tide to college debt &amp; were fooled to believe Biden was the same man Obama was. What do people who have social security care about universal healthcare or tuition free college?
Trump ads are running claiming Biden is a socialist and that he is further left than Bernie. That renders your point moot.
The “Bernie Bro” myth was started by the Hillary Clinton Campaign to paint the as agressive men. If you look as the statistics the Sanders movement beat Clinton among women &amp; beat Biden in women under 50yo.
Just keep playing on Biden’s ego. Sooner or later he’ll debate due to his hubris.
#DearMichigan, I was a life-long  member, volunteer, and activist who named my son "Reagan." I voted for very few Republicans in 2016 and will definitely be voting (in Michigan) for  (and ZERO  candidates) this November. Be smart. Vote Biden and #DumpTrump2020!
If Biden isn’t the absolute definition of a “politician,” the word should be eliminated from the dictionary
They Dont Need Biden Hydra Globalism is Already Everywhere  Trumps Exposing it But .....Its Gonna Take Political Will From All Cabinet Heads to Dismatle  These Globalist!
Somehow got an email from the Biden campaign and it was mildly cathartic to enter as my reason for unsubscribing: "Joe Biden told a Latino activist to 'go vote for Trump' so Joe Biden can go fuck all the way off."
Biden camp lies.
There is zero chance Biden gets on any stage and is asked random, not prepared questions, with or without POTUS standing next to him. Its not going to happen. His mind is gone and they will only lose votes by showing the public exactly how bad it is.
He’s right tho Biden will let China come in
Can you believe this tool   saying  shouldn’t debate  ? This is laughable. Do they think hiding Biden in the basement will successfully lead to a victory? Not a chance with all of Joes gaffes. Right now social media is beating up Joe &amp; Jill
The next Trump rally he needs to put a cardboard cutout of Biden on stage and call it an unscheduled debate.
The two primary classes of people have opposing interests depending on their relationship to the ownership of capital. Biden himself is worth millions of dollars and his staff and donors are worth billions more. They do not share your interests and *cannot* share them.
I'm sorry if this offends anyone but, I do not support Biden in any way or his party but, I do sympathize with the man personally since my mother had Alzheimer's and I lost her to it. I know the symptoms and the progression. His family know it also and should step in now.
Liberal analysis like your fails because it individualizes the nature of politics. The idea that Biden could be convinced on a to endorse certain policies as if it was purely a matter of personal argumentation is fundamentally misunderstanding class interest 1/
Biden promised he'd cure cancer as VP under Obama. Never showed the slightest effort at doing so.  He's made the same promise as President.  Not holding my breath.  He's done nothing in 47 years but make his own family rich.
Why doesn't Joe Biden run on the slogan "Make America Great Again"?  He could say he's bringing manufacturing jobs back He could say he'll eliminate the debt He could say he'll negotiate a peace treaty with Iran and NK  He could say Mexico will finance border security #TrumpLied
Ha, must need glasses along with your Dementia. True news reported by far. Tens of people, smaller tens of crowds, Grim Reaper showed up many times along the way, no wave just finger gestures, posters reporting your failure. Biden supporters didn't have to show, you own this one.
Russia owns you and look how awful that’s been for us. I think we’ll take our chances with Biden. He won’t artificially inflate the makets in hopes they don’t come crashing down (under your bs scheme that is what’s coming). #PutinsPuppet
This now independent conservative Michigander is voting for Joe Biden because he loves his country enough to recognize fascism. I want to return to debating policies, not the physical appearance of people, the tears of the left, etc.  The GOP needs LEADERS again.  #DearMichigan
Biden is proof that crime pays and evil wins.I’m fully convinced Joe Biden is DEFINITELY NOT in charge of this account
Biden has no toilet in the basement. He ran out of TP forcing him to go in the backyard! His handlers counted 14 brown or yellow spots in the grass. C’mon man you using coke too? I’m not CRAZY
Joe Biden -  "What you all know but most people dont know unlike the African/American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community"  Took 25 words for him to say   "You're all the same"
I'm not a huge fan of Biden, but he didn't get near as much negativity 4 years ago when he wasn't running for president. A lot of the shit spreading around him seems like an effort from others who benefit from him seeming like a bad person.

This article is garbage.
Biden Promises a Return to the Obama Era. That’s Bad News for Palestinians. - In These Times
Biden says he would veto Medicare for All, citing price tag
‘She is absolutely our No. 1 draft pick’: GOP pines for Rice as Biden VP - POLITICO
Its simple if Biden were to actually do the work to earn our voted show leftists that he supports and plans to push/ fight for progressive policies not pander and show that he does want to move left shit would be different he would get those voters.
87% of Democrats Support 'Medicare for All,' Though Joe Biden Doesn't
These people could easily not do the work for Biden make demands instead fight the DNC call them the fuck out and call Biden the fuck and not make themselves look clownish but nope.
Im sorry but I am kind of in shock seeing these people who are like the voices of the progressive movement just go along with Biden and the DNC.
Seeing all these progressives just going along with this Biden isn’t it but we just gotta do it in order to get Trump where the fuck is the fight in that where are the demands you all are just falling in line and giving Biden a pass you all aren’t even holding his feet to the 🔥
Saying that we must vote for Biden all while he continues to reject progressive policies and then say this shit this gives us a sense of false hope say you do fall in line and vote for Biden he is just magically going to move to the left after he has rejected the left.
Nah fuck that shit I reject Biden.
The article should be called a left wing group falls in line and does the work for Biden.  Like seriously how can anybody be progressive and go along with this shit.
Why I Joe Biden running? To avoid Hunter and himself from getting in trouble. China!!!
Wow more reasons why Biden isn’t it 👏 he does not deserve our vote 👏Cada dia veo las noticias de Biden y cada dia me cae tan mal.
Breaking: Just announced, text to vote approved by the house nation wide.  Text: 30330 to vote for Biden Nov 3rd Registration no longer necessary.   Damn! Guess Nancy came through after all
I’ll say it again, Biden is the racist old white dude that they tell you Trump is.
Shame on you  and Biden family!!!

By attacking Joe Biden for his Catholic faith.Donald Trump has shown himself,for the hateful,divisive   Bigot,that he is .
Maybe  should be on Biden’s short list for VP.
Agreed. Other than my parents nobody I know is voting Biden.
Donald Trump disparages Biden’s school records,while hiding his academic ,”accomplishments” from sight.
No he completely changed the story. It was going after the NRA bc of fraud, nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment. He stated that and than dragged in more fake news about Biden. Intelligent people read that actually is happening instead of believing people who make up stuff.
Makes no difference to me if or how you vote. I respect your freedom to choose.  I choose differently than you and the respect is not reciprocated.  It’s your way or the highway?  Biden has absolutely zero chance at getting my vote.  You could have not nominated him.
You know if they really wanted Biden to debate Trump they would at least do some kind of Zoom Debate.
This is performative nonsense - there isn't a person in the whole of the country that Biden could pick that would satisfy you.  But you did get a nice ratio out of it...so, win?
Seeing Biden talk about the latino community is really something he basically says nothing just we got to embrace the latino community we got to stop seperating families we got to include them okay but what exactly are you going to do to help the latino community are you going to
Biden seriously needs to just say what exactly he is going to do what are his plans this vague shit in his videos isn’t good enough.
Zero excitement campaign.  Zero benefit to the voter. Zero to vote to protect.  Zero chance I’m voting Biden.
Maybe. You know you are correct. I am helping trump.  If Biden wasn’t such a shitty nomination I most certainly wouldn’t be helping trump.  Every action has a re action.  Biden caused trump which causes........
My dumb ass voted Hillary.  I thought for sure she would win.   I was wrong.  I’m voting trump this year.  Biden is to far right for my vote. Trump is a protest vote.  If he wins he could completely destroy so many corporate creations. Need to nominate a real Dem in 24.
Biden is the most Republican candidate running. Biden reeks of MAGA.
If I lived through Joe Biden voting with Republicans from 1973-2009 to make himself wealthy and screw the working class...... you can make another 4 years of trump.
Biden is not going to move to the left. Did anybody even see his current ad where he is driving fancy ass car I mean seriously anybody that believes that Biden is going to move to the left is seriously naive if anything he will pander a little.
Don’t talk about supporting progressive policies when your there falling in line telling others to do the same and saying that Biden is moveable and that next cycle we can maybe have the candidate of our choice really?
I mean I don’t get how this is the right thing to do wait around till next cycle to get Biden out instead of making demands I don’t get their whole shit strategy.
Are excluded from the conversation. Biden wouldn’t even support Medicare for All or Student Loan Cancellation? Oh but we all just have to deal with it like always wait around for Biden to do what exactly save the ACA go back to the Obama times slow changes and half measures.
Trump is evil and shit but give us some sign that shit is going to change and that voters are being listened to cause as I see it right now Biden wins but what exactly is going to change for all of us who are out here barely making ends meet cause so far the poor/working class
Im sorry you all can go along with this shit I voted for Hillary in 2016 after being treated like shit by her supporters and there was never an apology from her or calls for her to call out her supporters. Now here we are doing this again but with Biden but instead Biden has
Honestly in the Settle with Biden and this Vote Trump Out shit bothers me why are progressives doing the work for him when he and his campaign should be doing the work.
They say that Biden is moveable when did he support progressive policies?
This bothers me. Basically the left falls in line again instead of demanding that Biden earn peoples votes. I live in Michigan and will be voting green and shaming those that vote green is  not it.
Yeah, Biden is a complete mess.
Lol relax “ Q “.   Pelosi, Biden, Schumer, and many many more are owned by the exact same Corporate elite as every Republican.  Puppets on a string.  Any Democrat who voted with Republicans is a Republican.  They all take orders from same corporate interests.
Sorry but Biden his campaign and the Dems are clowns if they wanted leftists/progressives to vote for them they would do better if they wanted unity they would not continue to talk shit about the left or do everything to stop progressive candidates and policies from winning
Posting Fuck Donald Trump isn’t stopping that fucking nightmarish piece of shit there needs to be a plan to hold his ass accountable I am not seeing any of these settle with Biden people talking about they just believe that if we get him out shit is just going to stop being
Im sorry but this is not Biden doing the work. Has Biden even talked at all about defunding/abolishing ICE and releasing the immigrant children at the detention centers???????
I don’t think anybody is advising him I think they are just letting him do whatever he wants. The campaign seems to not care their whole thing is we got to get Trump out vote for Biden cause he’s not Trump and that should be good enough it’s all very entitled and out of touch.
Where are the demands from these progressive orgs telling us to settle for Biden that Biden start doing the work to earn our vote. We can’t just wait around while shit gets worst that’s some real privileged shit to tell someone who is struggling oh just wait around for Biden
Im sorry but no. Progressives/leftists should not have to do the work for Biden he should be out there doing everything to earn their vote.
Im sorry but I will not be voting for Biden Vote Green. This whole wait till next cycle to get Biden out won’t cut it. Roots Nation should be demanding they replace him instead cause he is not it.
Joe Biden is trash
😂😂. Ohhh Kay?  The biggest issue with Democrats is they are turning into Republicans.  Check out Joe Biden’s 40 year voting Record.  It makes Mitch McConnel look like a liberal.  We have a dimwitted Republican vs a spastic clown Republican to pick from this election. Good luck.
If your a resist pro Biden account or a Republican please don’t follow me. 🙏
We should all be demanding that they replace Biden with Bernie cause this clown isn’t it.
So vote Trump out by giving Biden the nomination even though he did not deserve it and then make demands after he is elected as if Biden as if he is going to do anything what is this shit.
should we settle every single one of these leftist orgs should be demanding that Biden do the fucking work and if he is not willing to do that then call them all the fuck out call the party out and demand they fucking replace him.
Biden won’t even debate or be at the convention. I hate Trump I think he is garbage but how is doing the work for Biden and his campaign going to push him to the left Biden keeps being given everything he also keeps getting free passes for barely doing nothing.
Seeing so called progressives literally doing the work for Biden while Biden does absolutely nothing really bothers me. If you all want leftists to vote for Biden then deman he do the work and step it the fuck up.
I will be voting green cause honestly fuck Biden and the DNC.
So let me get this straight you are going to be doing the work for Biden to get progressives to vote for him. Why is everybody doing this for Biden????
And I will not be supporting RootsAction.
I think they are so desperate to get a Democrat in office, they are overlooking A LOT of issues with Joe Biden.
At least don’t vote at all. You can’t really want Biden. 40yr career politician who’s never actually helped anyone but himself unless it was a coincidence. So crooked he can’t talk straight anymore &amp; There’s videos of him being “strange” w/kids. Trump’s gotten really bad press.
#letitrip President Trump is Losing Ground on his Presidential General Election. Biden will get the Advantage.
She’s the fucking worst. I’m on record, I’ve said what I said, I will not vote for a biden/Harris ticket.
They Endorsed Biden you Idiot
Sounds like you won’t be voting for Biden then
No...are you cognitively challened?  Biden said that his rigorous and active campaign and interview presence was equal to a daily test...try to keep up...you're a major news outlet.
If Michelle Obama is picked as his VP I predict a huge shift on moneyline odds:   Biden -300 (favorite) Trump +425 (underdog) #Odds #MichelleMoneyLine
I do not give shit. Write it down tell the world.  Biden voted away my pension before I was old enough to work. Biden has sucked the Corp d for 40 years. Making himself wealthy at our expense.  I 100 % don’t care.  Progress can be painful
Let’s not forget that Mr Biden will have Media allies to help him if he gets into a jam.
You don’t have to get it.  If you are voting for Biden there is much you don’t get.

I was watching and listening to this. I can’t wait until this comes out. Also the Biden’s and the Ukraine.
Biden can’t handle Chris Wallace let alone a real reporter like Tucker. Of course the fake news wants a fake president to put on a show with.   Trump shoots from the hip with real bullets. We should appreciate how impressive that is instead of criticizing every time he misses.
It's my understanding that Fox is not "news" but rather an entertainment channel so why would Biden waste his time?
Biden doesn’t resort to fairytales,like Trump does.Biden has not told tall tales about George Washington’s arevolutionary war Air Force,or the Bowling Green massacre.
He says Biden could have, but didn't. What took Trump so long? Just in time for election. Too little, too late.

On the bright side, Joe Biden may not have to spend a penny on ads. Just run the Axios interview on a repeating loop every day through Nov 3.
The GOP new catch phrase is “Judge Biden by the people he surrounds himself with.”  Like all the convicted felons in the Trump organizations?
Work hard? Do tell us when does Trump work hard? He has done nothing about the pandemic, nothing in regards to protests except to call his own citizens anarchists, people who have lost their jobs, health care.... Nothing. Sure, go after Biden for not working hard. Gtfo
Should get a jammer in there just for fun, make it screech in his ear or start playing funny lines of Biden’s on repeat in his ear
Joe Biden can’t debate a 5th grader or a trained parrot 🤷‍♀️
Joe Biden can’t debate a 5th grader 🤦‍♀️ ... scratch that , he couldn’t debate a trained parrot 🤷‍♀️

You've got a real inferiority complex. You wouldn't see Biden supports because we've got better things to do than watch you drive down the road.
Great show about Biden.   please share must watch show. Biden worse than we thought.   Ep. 1312 A Warning Everyone Needs to Hear About Biden - The Dan Bongino ...  via
I’m voting for trump.  I am casting my vote for the gent who goes by Donald  J Trump.  Not sure what all this a vote for this equals that.  I hate Biden.
If asking about corruption becomes a crime, we're all in trouble in this country.   Why aren't you concerned with Biden’s involvement in Ukraine as he's running for president yet you're upset that Trump wants to know what the hell was going on?   Ukraine is charging Biden
This should be a commercial! Trump debates “Robo Biden”
He is afraid to do an interview w/ Chris Wallace and now debates.    Of course we know exactly what they're afraid of!    Just say it,  Joe Biden's incapable and President Trump will rightly win!
Maybe.  You are probably right. A gambling man would say the candidates who name are pre printed on the ballot have a much greater chance of winning than a write in.  I’m not voting for trump to win. I’m voting to cause Biden’s loss.
Nope.  But I’m voting trump. I hate them both.  This Biden nomination is so disgusting I’m voting like Biden did for 40 years with the wrong side.
Unlike Trump,Biden realizes that it’s way past time,for our country to pay its bills.Trump has been maxing out,our credit cards.
Joe Biden and the Democrats,will deliver the vaccine,that will bring an end to the. utter lunacy,that has been the Trump era
Biden doesn’t know what day it is 😂
You making me pick Biden is your choice?   It’s an analogy and a damn good one. The play on words is Trump is AIDS, but Biden is better or HIV pos.  I didn’t actually think you have to pick one anymore than you think I’m voting Biden.
Biden not debating Trump makes him look weak as fuck.
You are correct. Tea Party stated they would not vote for Candidates not far enough Right.  President Obama won all 3 branches.  Mid term GOP took much back. Then they blocked virtually everything for next 6 years.   Biden loses because of a protest vote. Maybe then???
Joe Biden is about as radical as Mitt Romney.
Joe Biden is as far left as George Bush.
If I said you have to have a sexual relationship with a HIV positive person or an equally attractive person with full blown AIDS.  How would respond without being “ Juvenile “ ?   Biden sucks. Not worth voting for. If you disagree tell me again are you gunna date AIDS or HIVpos?
Why is Joe Biden sniffing Idaho? Its crazy times we live in.
Dear America,Bring back sanity to our  Biden.
Meanwhile Orange man fake right? I think Biden was right! Y'all are being played like a fiddle. Obama got blacker!  tickles my giggle box.😂😆😆
This just shows that Biden will not fight for us whatsoever and is not going to be able to even fight the Republican party when trying to pass policies.
Are you fucking kidding me? ⁦ This is who you want us to vote for you don’t even want him to debate Trump so you all just gave him the nomination and he has to basically do nothing for our votes wow.
Now more than ever we need Biden to drop out and Bernie replaces him.

Everything that came out of this guys mouth was that Biden was doing good in the polls and that it helped him to have Obama with him or whatever on those videos.
They had some guy from Bidens campaign this morning on MSNBC that campaign is garbage also they just think Biden is going to win cause he is Biden and because people hate Trump so basically they are just giving him the nomination without doing the work he is going to do very
But Biden is just fine.  "These People Are Stupid"!
Joe Biden actually wants to pay off the deficit.Donald Trump just wants to keep spending.
Joe Biden’s health is obviously declining quickly. They are going to have to replace him. On the bright side it won’t be Hillary because her  husband is a pedophile.
Joe Biden was the bottom of the barrel. I imagine the VP pick will be too. 😂
But, but, but isn't Biden senile? Haven't heard that one bandied about in a while.
Not unlikely at all. Who’s going to the polls in masses? His supporters who think this is no big deal and listen to him about mail-in ballots. So yea, easy to see machines favoring him and then we are in for a shitstorm like you said if Biden pulls ahead a month later.
Joe Biden was a last resort pick for the Democrats. It looks like the VP pick will be last resort.
And you all thought that maybe Biden and the Dems were going to move left gtfoh.

Sorry to say this but on a lot of Biden posts the majority of people commenting are white people.
If Biden was serious about helping people he would support Medicare for All not just access.
People are dying &amp; you make jokes, this is why the majority hates you. There are even groups called Republicans For Biden! #DumpTrump2020
It's funny that you were so vague, but if you think for a second that Joe Biden has a prayer I will refer you to Dukakis for reference.
Donald Trump’s October surprise is going to be a deep fake of Joe Biden saying something horrific and there’s just nothing we can do about it
Tim.   Biden doesn’t know what his policies are yet.  He doesn’t have to do any thinking.  Whatever the corporate interests tell him to do he will.  Sad this man is the better of 2 options.  If these candidates were goods sold at market the companies would go bankrupt
He’s had enough time in politics to get things fixed. He’s failed. Move along Hiden Biden
And I don’t want to shame anybody but seriously you are telling everybody vote and you go into this whole but this is as good as we are going to get we shouldn’t question or demand more we just got to suck it up and vote for Biden because we got to take out Trump. 🙄No wonder
I mean this whole settling for less shit isn’t going to cut it everybody should be demanding that Biden and his team do better do something more beyond just giving us a story or a vague speech.
“With his dying breath he said, tell Obama to use my funeral for Biden’s campaign! Biden for president”🙄
I have a serious question so say Biden wins and Trump/his team is out what comes next so far what i hear is very vague. Okay you are going build back better so how are the Dems going to take back the house from the Republicants. Cause so far Joe isn’t for progressive policies

Biden is like we need to grow and open the country well then if he believes that why is he against pushing and fighting for basic fucking needs like housing, healthcare, canceling student loans, etc etc?
Which, btw, is why it’s critical that Biden, if elected, doesn’t back slide into the neo-liberalism that’s defined the last 40 years of the Dem Party — its the only way to inoculate us from the threat posed by the coming generation of less managerially incompetent mini-Trumps.
This shit is just sad this lady obviously has issues and is all over the place I noticed that on her IG.  This is why It was crazy seeing people canceling Buttar without hearing out the whole story all while Khive and Biden supporters who talked so much
When you do voting to that extent, you're gonna find more leftists, you're gonna find more Biden, SO I SAY TO MY PEOPLE "SLOW THE MAILING DOWN PLEASE!"
Rioters and Looters for Biden.
Can you picture Joe Biden doing the state of the union address? 😂
News Flash!!!!!! More people are following Trump than Biden.

I can't even believe I am engaging you. Biden can complete sentences far better than your man can, put them side by side and watch. Pedophile background? Sthu. That is a lie.  Goodbye  back into your conspiracy theory room.
That Instagram account for Biden I have a feeling is run by Warren people.
Are people supposed to ignore that Biden is doing very little to earn their vote are they supposed to ignore thar the party just voted down on progressive policies like M4A, legalizing marijuana and against Palestine. I mean seriously do they think people are this naive?
Settle for Biden is a joke. Gtfoh. The instagram is ridiculous who is this made for how does this make Biden appealing knowing that he won’t even support progressive policies.
No Biden will look foolish.
President Trump comes up with these nicknames for his opponents. Sleepy Joe Biden, Crooked Hillary Clinton ,lying Ted Cruz. What does he call himself?Dandy Don?
Wow they are really desperate to get people to vote for Biden knowing he is a fucking disaster.
Biden is in no way a fucking leftist you fucking clown.Everyone involved needs to PRAY then PAY for what they have done to America and Donald Trump. That includes you Joey Biden!
I am old enough to remember when Joe Biden got the waver pushed through.

Editorial: Americans are starting to realise Trump is part of the problem, not the solution
I can totally see Biden calmly, carefully punching Donald in the face, if it came to that. And the world would be okay with that.
Biden is not worthy of any vote.
Biden criticizes the black community for not being tolerant and diverse, and also says he is going to pick a black vice-president based on skin color and gender.  He is a classic white Democrat. Racist to his very core.
I am voting for Joe Biden but the fact it’s a vote against Trump is a welcome fringe benefit. Trump isn’t going to win. You underestimate just how hated he is. Democrats are not going to make the same mistakes of 2016. Hell even the GOP is abandoning him in droves.
Biden endorsed by BLM &amp; Antifa, Trump endorsed by NRA &amp; law enforcement. #VoteRED2020RemoveEveryDemocrat
im going to launcugh my ass if kanye wins he wouldn't know what to do
After experiencing a “perfect” president, I’ll take an imperfect and willing to admit it #Biden any day.
I just saw a Trump commercial criticizing Biden for bragging about his IQ....Ironic much Don?
Hey there Biden tweet minion. How bout you try repeatedly hitting the center autofill button. It'll make just about as much sense.
April, clearly you are a lib, and ipso facto wicked and godless. Don’t you see the bigger point? Do not blaspheme the Lord’s Anointed.™ Also, Biden is going to kill God and outlaw church!
But when Joe Biden said Trump hasn’t ever read the Bible how is this different? No factual base, one mans opinion.
The color brown is racist, but Biden, he's a real civil rights activists.  Have you guys been checked for Asperger syndrome?  I'm serious.
Most of them is majority. Among my friends 100% have doubled down 😑 and I've never seen anyone say I voted third party this time I won't or I didn't vote last time I will this time. I just see a lot of if you vote for Biden your voting for the status quo that gave us Trump
Biden is for infanticide.
I hope God is ready for Biden. #hurt
The veneer on Biden slips all the time and he gets away with it every time. Not a single republican could get away with saying “poor kids are just as smart and talented as white kids”
President Biden should play this dementia clip of Donald trump at every event until the very day Biden is sworn in.
Are you ever going to even mention Biden?  LOL- you jerks!
Covid would have to take Biden, the DNC, most of the Democrat leadership, and the stock market would have to crash, with bankers and stockbrokers leaping out of skyscrapers in despair, shortly before a hurricane destroyed New York City.
Where are the crowds, holding Biden flags, and chanting "USA, USA?" 🤔
Joe Biden did not write this tweet, he’s feeble and demented. You saw and heard the real Joe when he said the black community was not diverse!
Where are the crowds, holding Biden flags, and chanting "USA, USA?" 🤔
She is crazy if she thinks it will fly. Just distracting from the point that biden can't debate.
Looks like many will be disappointed with Biden's VP pick. You know who won't be? The GOP. Because they can see that everyone will be pissed and crying. If you choose to take your ball home, because you didn't get your way, please go fuck yourself. This election is too important.
Yes, we need to protect God or Biden will beat him up, and hurt the Bible, and take away all our guns and religion, according to Dear Leader today. 🍊
Biden could pick a jar of botulism-laden green mayonnaise and he would get my vote.

That’s because Biden is going to kill God. POTUS said so.
Biden will kill God if he gets a chance. We have to arm ourselves to protect the Deity! That’s why he also wants to kill the second emolument.

Here in Wyoming we call no brains Biden SLOPPY JOE
Hey all, pastor Dave here, let me assure you of this: God will be completely unharmed should Biden win the election.
Ok well we need guns to protect God. Otherwise Biden’s going to kill God, and then what?
Yells at it?  Ooh, I need someone to do the 'yelling woman : confused cat' meme, but with Biden and a bible!
1: this is a sound bite, did any of you watch the full video ?    2: Trump says, and has said 20 times worse, so as far as I'm concerned it's Biden or no one.    3: if you don't vote, you voted for Trump... Thankyou and have a good day.
Ask Joe Biden where it is and then ask him to say if he lied to Congress.
can we just start calling him "Woah Biden" yet
No Joe Biden has to be lead around like a baby. Can not get his facts right.
Biden cannot debate and he will not debate.  I guarantee it.  He's barely functional and he needs a lot of sleep.
GOP President: “I’ve never read either one, but, believe me, I know both of them better than anyone and only I can save them. Also, Biden’s gonna kill God.”
The  choice is Clear but it is surprising how many people will cut their own nose off to spite their  face . The brainwashed liberal controlled Media continues to spout drivel about Trump and Ignore the Facts about Biden/Obama , Clinton , the Washington Swamp Cabal Pedos +more !

I love how these Biden supporters throwing in a clip of Bernie supporting Creepy Joe is supposed to mean something. Bernie is part of the problem for backing Biden. He should have said "fuck you" and ran third party. But, he has no balls and resorts to blaming Republicans.
So, by using your logic, if I am not voting for Trump, then I am voting for Biden. Are you for real?

But Biden is brain dead! I'm voting Green or for Kanye.
I'm not surprised by too much these days ,after all the stuff Biden has been involved in the past 30 years , why is anybody wondering about him choosing a Black Widow Spider for a running mate , or whoever ,whatever ?
So it sounds like Joe Biden’s knowledge of Hispanics is limited to those featured on TV the Californian Mexican, the New YorRican, and the Cuban.
I don’t need to hear your babbling blather and bs to know I’m voting for Biden.
Great to see.  Slam the DNC though. Not just Biden, but continue exposing his weakness's..   Country needs to see Cities like Minneapolis, Portland, San Francisco, such chaos with refunding police . Older crowds hates that idea.. for sure to get votes.
um pretty sure people who are voting that early for Biden are NOT going to change their minds after 3.5 years of a disaster bc of one debate. 🤔
IMO Biden should announce a "team of rivals" cabinet

Instagram insists 'bug' that negatively affected Joe Biden was 'not partisan'
Does this suggest they found someone else in the basement with Biden?
Biden can accept his nomination from his basement where he’s been holed up for months, but Trump can’t deliver his speech from where he’s spent the past three plus years? Are you guys insane - he’s the President, leave him alone and let him lead - what is everyone so afraid of?
Beyond bizarre. Why did the Democrats select Biden from a field of so many better candidates? It is sad watching Joe's demise play out everytime he is on camera. He really isn't capable of being the president. .    Find a new candidate. .
That's real👌 Maybe they should do some polling in the mainland. Not that seeing the poll numbers from George Costanza Land / Bizarro Upside Down World isn't a great entertainment value. Building up Biden's chances, then bashing the lefties dreams will make for many yummy tears.
so that’s why you were so horrible to attny General Barr. You and your husband took $700,000 from Ukrainian thugs connected to Biden. Tiktok

I would not get to carried away. I would agree this election will be the most important in all of our lives, but in my opinion, Biden is running his campaign smoothly and without too many "things" going on that Trump can try to smear on. Voting equality is my bigger priority.
Trump picked Pence on July 15, 2016 Hillary Clinton picked Kaine on July 22, 2016 Romney picked Ryan on August 11, 2012 McCain picked Palin on August 29, 2008 Obama picked Biden on August 23, 2008  Pretty average time line to me...
President Joe Biden. Question; you think he will show up for Biden being sworn in in Jan 2021?
You play the hand you are dealt.   And, keep in mind, it's not just a president but it is also the people that surround him.    Biden will have a great team.
Barr wouldn't stand for it. He would fire all of them to protect 45 from it! I hope Biden puts someone in that will investigate all the BS Barr has done!
Biden is honestly pretty physically fit for his age
I think no matter what happens in November the right loses unless we coalesce and stand together. Trump/house/senate=left loses their minds even more. Biden wins we all lose.
I think the Republicans think their party is shot to hell and won't be held to account for anything anyway so it's a free for all like drunken sailors on shore leave, but they will have to sober up sometime and realize what they have done either with Biden or no democracy.

Trump is an idiot and you can vote for whoever you want but Joe Biden ain't no saint, just look at his past history.
Are you going to be the HNIC if Biden gets elected? I totally could see you giving Joe a pudding pop and sending him off to a back room with his favorite TV program while you strike deals selling us out to China.
Basically he may care enough about America that he doesn't want Biden because he knows that will mean the end of us as we know it. He is still number one in importance to him but maybe we are number 2. Meh. I have lukewarm support of him as a human but for the good of US he wins.
The Democrat strategy is to keep Biden under wraps so that in effect the election is between Trump and a generic Democrat. That way voters can project whatever they want onto Biden, replacing this flawed candidate with their own imagination of a competent one. #Biden2020
As an AMERICAN, I could never vote for Joe Biden.
These Biden Tweets are getting better.
Yea, weirdly enough being belittled and berated DIDN'T make me feel super energized about voting for the Dem candidate back in 2016.  Perhaps bullying your voter base in 2020 will get em fired up to vote Biden!  Dems have a low bar to jump when everyone votes lesser of two evils.

You know what else is "pathetic"  , not voting !! Your choices are for one of two candidates and if you can't vote for one (Trump) and "choose" not to vote for the other (Biden) then your "non-vote" becomes in favor of Trump. But, you, of all ppl "KNOW THIS" !! WTF!

Biden’s a snowflake. Never been taken to the wood shed. That’s why his masters don’t want home to debate. Obvious
Point taken. Wish Haberman would point out equal gaffes by Biden. So so many. It's actually disturbing.
Go watch Biden read. Then get back to me. Thanks. A stumble over a word is normal normal normal.
Yeah, they kinda are. I made a funny comment about his misread. Why can't it just be funny? instead Haberman wants to pretend it means something, while ignoring Basement Biden who can't even speak on his own.
I am wondering why same scrutiny is not given to Basement Biden. Who can't even string three words together. LOL.
Oh, I see. Only president's cannot make a mistake when reading aloud. Got it. Maybe watching one of those basement Biden broadcasts and get back to me.
Ah, I guess that means he just can't be president anymore. If you mispronounce a word, you're done. Better keep an eye on Biden, can barely read the cue cards when he 'answers' a 'random' question.

This show gave me a sense of balance that I fear I won't feel again until Biden's inauguration.
Hey, Biden intern, hope you’re getting paid enough to do this. Might wanna ask for a raise.
Joe Biden can’t wipe his own Ass let alone write his own tweets.
NOW THIS IS BULLSHIT YOU LOOSE GO HOME TAKE IT LIKE IT MAN NOT LIKE SOME POWER AND CONTROL FREAK. YOUR NOT ABOVE THE LAW AND YOU NEED TO SEE THAT. YOU KNOW TRUMP YOUR POLES WOULDN'T BE LOW IF YOU JUST DID A MONTHLY 2000 STIMULUS NO EXCEPTIONS END OF STORY

Biden Says He Can't Wait To Find Out Who He Picked For VP  via  Campaign aides say it's been Biden's most anticipated event since he found out he was running for president a few weeks ago.
Joe Biden not debating will so easily be spun into a story about him not being mentally capable enough to debate. It can and will backfire immensely
Well if these sheeple want to follow Joe pedo Biden then civil war is eminent
Trump Will Win  Biden Will Whine  Just Like Hillary
Yes, we will. Who is writing them? It sure ain’t Biden.
Biden never did anything in 47 years for Americans
It's Trump be a landslide.  Stick a fork in Biden.  He's done.
Biden. Your a pussy Bitch Debate
Every single Trump ad right now should be arguing that Biden is scared to debate Trump. Can’t even handle a debate? How is he going to be able to lead the country? That is the easiest political attack ad ever.
Ha! That is good. You know, if Biden wins (he won't) most of the corrupt Obama gang will be back on the payroll in his administration. I'm sure Hillary will get one of the best jobs. It would be sickening.  . 🇺🇲 #Trump2020 🇺🇲 #KAG 🇺🇲 #ColoradoForTrump 🇺🇲 #StopMarxistDemocrats 🇺🇲
If I was a Democrat I would be upset with this choice, Biden is not capable and I cannot believe they are putting the party through this painful experience and embarrassment. Drop out Joe
Dude, Joe biden is just as bad. Also Trump did more then Obama did in 4 years then the 8 years Obama was in office. That's a fact, I remember when that was trending.
The Swamp is So Embedded  Could easily Complete its Liberal Mission Without A President Or A Cabinet  HRC &amp; Bummer/Biden Made Sure of That
All too foreseeable. If Biden won’t debate, Trump will hammer him on that point until Election Day.
Believe it or not...i saw a Biden yard sign here in CheyenneI told Hillary in 16 that she needs Chinese bots to defeat Trump's Russian bots. She didn't listen therefore she didn't get elected. Biden's campaign did! You win by fighting fire with fire!!! He gets it!
Any time pimp
JOE BIDENS MENTAL STATE IS ZERO,HE DUMB,DON'T KNOW WHAT STATE OR CTY HE'S IN.BEN DON'T KNOW CRAP.HE WILL HURT AMERICANS,RAISE TAXES.BIDEN IS TREATING BLACKS WRONG SAYING STUPID CRAP..AMERICANS DON'T VOTE FOR BIDEN, VOTE TRUMP.
I see Biden screwed up again saying crap about black people,he is always downing the black race when he speaks.Joe Biden is a mental idiot how the hell van he run a country when he don't know where he is, don't know if it's his wife or her sister,can't even speak well
Maybe Joe Biden should pick who he’d want to be his Vice President and tell everyone who disagrees to fuck off
The DNC did, Biden doesn’t shit unless scripted. What a joke.
If you truly were you'd realize that Trump uses us a photo op. Biden is a true Catholic. Why would you say he's not? Do you personally know him? That's what I thought
If Biden has 100 a day then Trump has a million. You really want to keep on going? Come on dude check yourself before you wreck yourself...literally
You say Biden has dementia but Trump has 2 gaffes in one day? Yeah I'd chill on that
The worst things Biden has said compares nothing to the things Trump has said that is for certain and at least Biden has the decency to apologize if he feels he has said wrong while Trump feels he can't do or say wrong which is exactly why we're in the dire situation we are in
I can’t argue that he has dealt with an incredible amount of grief. That story I shared is completely legit though, along with many other instances of his dishonesty. All I said was Joe Biden will not be a good President. I didn’t say he should or shouldn’t beat Trump.
And I don't see Biden as garbage or even with dementia I just believe what he has is a speech impediment and that's alright. I'm sorry you feel that way about him but that's alright it's your opinion as an American and that's what being American is supposed to be about.
Dems didn't expect Trump to mess up this much and are now having Biden talk, along with suing the NRA, in order to lose harder.
I respect your opinion I only see one evil this election in fact I see Biden as someone that shares more true conservative values than Trump does
I just can't imagine Joe Biden tweeting this or completing any other thought.

I think you meant Biden
I wasn't referring to Biden of course I was referring to the Gov I'd rather her stay also I think Kamala is the perfect choice
Biden had a little bit of a gaffe today but thanks to Trump that got overshadowed big time. For Biden just has a speech impediment, Trump is just plain dumb and ignorant.
See I don’t think Joe Biden is a decent human being, but that’s just my opinion. I don’t think he’s a good politician, I don’t think he’s of sound mind and I certainly do not believe he will be a good President. I’m taking Trump out of the equation and just evaluating Biden.
Trump has had 2 gaffes in one day yet he says Biden is mentally ill? Lol
Biden wouldn't block Trump's prosecution if the Justice Department pursued it   Prosecuted for beating Hillary?
I'm happy Biden has at least narrowed it to two legit VP candidates. Harris or Rice are great choices although of course I'd prefer Kamala since she's more moderate but I do love both. Both are great.
She would throw away her vote if Biden picks Susan Rice.  Easy enough to understand.
Our  is amazing &amp;  would be a strong VP partner for  But I believe our future currently depends on actively championing #RacialEquity in the White House with one of our strong and well-qualified #shortlisted #womenofcolor in 2020.
Biden is picking either Harris or Rice huh? Good. I still take Kamala but both are definitely qualified.
This year yes we have to. Besides Biden's worst compared nothing to Trump's worst
If you are looking at it as a lesser of two evils decision, then I get it. I can promise you a Biden presidency isn’t going to magically turn everything around. He will be a failure.
I can’t predict the future but Joe Biden does not seem to be a viable candidate to run this country in my eyes. I’m not trying to compare him to Trump, I’m trying to gauge his potential to be a good President. I do not see it.
Biden will beat Trump. I don’t like Biden, I do not think he will be a good President (Easily could be the worst President of all time), but he will beat Trump. Only way Biden loses is if he absolutely shits the bed on the debate stage. It would have to be a historic meltdown.
Democrats might be experiencing the biggest cognitive dissonance in human history with their candidate Joe Biden. Fascinating to see the outcome!
Who thinks Biden cares!!
After 60%+ votes have already been cast in some states, the 1st debate is planned...but will it be realized? Ahhh, different ?? Biden won’t debate because he knows he can’t match Trump, on ANY subject. That is, if Trump shows up and not The Donald!

I’m gonna miss not having debates with an audience cause I was hoping Biden would invite all of the women Trump sexually abused to sit in the audience like that ba$tard did with The Clinton’s. The difference being it didn’t rattle Hillary it would totally shut Trump down.

Reading  statements about the terrible explosion today in Jordan is like.... what the hell are you even talking about? What a stupid fucking goon. Possibly as senile as Biden at this point tbh. I hate this place.
The biggest shock to me is watching the mainstream media completely ignore Biden’s Cognitive Decline. Nobody on talk shows, late night or news pundits will mention their concern. It’s the elephant in the room and might seriously cost them the election.
Joe Biden doesn't have a virus named after him! #TrumpVirus
This dumb motherfucking moron! We're lower than the world and we're lower than Europe. WTF and his stupid fucked in the head supporters point out Biden every chance they get, really? Cmon people wakeup before we're all speaking Russian.
I truly wish she did. But 99% of ppl who want to vote for her will say a vote for her is a vote for Biden or a vote for trump. I wish ppl truly believed there was more then two parties but this country’s far from that.
I don’t love Biden either but at this point I don’t know how you can look at any Trump “policy” or interview and still think he won’t destroy this country. 155k preventable deaths, hate crimes, sexism, racism, and the worst 2nd quarter ever is trumps legacy

Biden has lied about plenty of things just like Bernie just like when Bernie said he would promise to cure cancer and boom he dropped out soon next will be Biden or he'll loose... Biden likes little kids if u want a pedo for president thts ur problem
Biden is winning in some of the most important swing states. Trump only won with 25% of the vote last time if our generation actually would vote Biden can win in a landslide. And tbh Nick it’s not a “lol” if trump wins again it’s going to be devestating for our democracy
Why wouldn’t we have this virus?  Every country in the world has it. But Biden who said he wouldn’t have stopped travel from China would have stopped it. How would that be? Forget that we had a virus? He could do that. What else would he have done?
Yeah, but what about Biden?
I don’t have one Trump sign by me or one Biden sign by me! Signs mean nothing. I saw at least 100 bad tweets against trump and 1 really bad tweet against trump and all kinds of bad memes about trump. I’ve seen more than 4 great tweets for Biden, 4 yes way more than 4. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Joe Biden has heard a lot about his potential choices. He is being thoughtful and weighing the possibilities, trying to make the best decision.  How is this bad? Is there a deadline?  I hate when media tries to create an issue where there isn't one.  I get that you are tired irl.
Warren is Great But too far to the left (which is fine with me) But Biden cannot afford the socialist and communistic ads that would follow with her False advertisements with only part of things she's said in public America will be like Cuba or China and Russia for instance
Vote for Joe Biden and turn all states blue
Michigan doesn't need Biden and America itself doesn't need him neither... This world would actually do better without his weird pedo ways running these streets I'm voting Republican ^^ Make America Great Again! #MAGA
Another words. A Biden/Antifa rally. Perfectly safe.
Yes. There were some strong candidates and Biden enters the race very late in the game and becomes THE defacto candidate? 🤨
I said it before and I'll say it again, I'll vote for Biden if he has a live TV interview the day before and is standing there picking his nose with one hand while playing paddle ball with the other!
Biden has to hide he is such an butt hole he can'teven give a speach right, never knows where he's at ,a big lier. I would not be surprised if he had dimentia or elshiemer.  He is the biggest idiot to run for president.His past is on ads that show he lies all the time

No corruption to report about Biden.
I'm ashamed to say I live in Michigan.  The biggest problem Trump has in Michigan is that he tells the truth about the black messiah (Obama).  People don't like Biden, they just don't like the fact that Obama sucked and Trump keeps saying it.
Biden will win, I think by a large margin.
Neil Cavuto is a Biden loving scum sucking bag of shit.  He doesn't have a very high rated show and really should go to CNN, where he would be a good fit with Don Lemon or Chris Cuomo.
Wut? Don’t think they want to raise that topic. “‘But as Bill Clinton once told me, the number one cause of Alzheimer’s is ambition,’ he added, while noting he’s in favor of Demings.”
Absolutely better off with Biden. Fuck Trump!
Democracy means you can vote and have someone to vote for you on bills. opposite of a democracy is dictatorship or monarchy  Socialism is a theory that the community owns everything.  Biden never said anything about Socialism or Removing democracy. He said “Democratic socialism.”
I don’t see it as a fear of others.. more of a personal decision on how she needs to frame the election. Pretty clear she is not a Biden fan but she’s ready &amp; willing to work on getting him elected. Odd? Yup. Anti-democratic or big deal outside of twitter? Nah. She’ll put in work
Automatic loss for Biden in Michigan
Except Biden when he writes it on his little notepad. 😆
“I think she wrote an article about why she won’t vote for Biden.” Wrong.  “She said she won't endorse him but won't campaign against him. How does that make her stance on the election any better?” Because she didn’t imply she’d sit out this cycle? Don’t put words in her mouth 🤷🏻‍♂️
Congrats to the people of Georgia for joining Arizona &amp; N.Carolina in polling Joe Biden ahead of the screwball! Next on the list the state of Texas where Biden is creeping closer everyday!
If you think joe Biden is left wing you’re smoking crackBiden didn't pass the USMCA which significantly increases the requirements for domestic auto content
Yes I think he would. I don't think he actually cares about winning. Biden has been shifting on black voters this entire spring/summer. He actually has spoken out against almost every policy initiative black voters and protestors have brought up.
Obama/Biden built it Trump/Pence broke it Biden/Harris (or Rice or whoever Joe needs) Will FIX IT!
But, VOTE LIKE BIDEN IS LOSING!!!!
Trump will definitely fold at a debate with Biden. Biden will destroy him lol
Mr Biden you will still have my vote.

Joe Biden will do the exact same thing just behind the “people’s party” smoke screen. They are the same thing. Is what I’m saying.
While Biden on the other hand will not save the world from global warming, will not legalize weed, will not end forever wars, will not end anything he inherits. Rather exacerbate much like trump did after warmonger Obama
Please elaborate. I’m a lefty but joe Biden is much much worse in my eyes. Mainly because he claims to represent me and my comrades.

Jesus, the #2020Election is going to be a nightmare. And, #Trump2020 will win huge. Lost mail, confusion, etc., all breaks for Trump's advantage. Polling suggests Trump voters will vote in person, Biden voters will mail in. Best yet, it's all the Dems idea

Seems pretty reasonable to me that: A. Biden will not be able to be the nominee B. The DNC has an agenda and will be proactive in protecting their interests.
I will say, I will never vote "against" anyone, I will only vote "for" someone. I believe people should educate themselves on all candidates and vote for who would be best leading our country (neither Truml or Biden) rather than vote for the party they've always voted for.
Biden just making it harder and harder to vote for him.
This isn’t Biden. Not that some reapportionment isn’t needed. It’s happening under 45’s presidency. Policing needs reform. Crime needs addressing but traditional police methods are failing. Divisions need to be overcome, not made worse. Trump makes it worse.
Joe Biden attempt to repeat the Southern Strategic Formula at every opportunity those ways are set in stone...he's probably hoping the Hispanic voting block become the new voting block to carry the Democrats party so the can continue fakeology of the past...same old Dems.
Its not a small thing tho, its a major precedent. No app has ever been banned, ever. This opens the floodgates. What if Biden decides to ban parler? Or fox news?
I've seen a document which accuses one presidential candidate of statutory rape.  And it wasn't Biden.
There is some serious revisionist seeds being planted in the buildup to Biden's (likely) election. They intend on trying to enact Bush-Era war criminal politics. This is just another tiny piece of a much bigger, despicable plan.

Fair enough.  You're right Biden won't give us that.  My point is just that it's an easier sell to voters.
I agree with that, but I think there must also be a push back on the Biden Campaign and Neo-Lib's more generally co-opting this language. Also, I think the way his campaign is messaging is closer to how the right talks about trade (nationalism) and not the left (exploitation).
I agree 100%.  A lot of Dems were naive at best when these agreements were drawn up.  My point is a realist one, that a Biden administration is not a totally lost cause because he isn't ideological, and I'm confident he will bow to pressure from the left.
While you're right that he supported it, I disagree with your greater characterization.  Biden's longevity in politics comes from his tendency to bow to prevailing winds.  After last night, it's impossible to deny the prevailing winds are progressive, so he will keep moving left.
And you're going to pretend Biden's flavor of austerity politics and deference to global financial capital isn't  one of the factors that paved the way for a demagogue like Trump.

No, Biden has a lifelong stutter he has overcome. Your guy has a defective mind, obvious to all during the Swan interview (talk about early onset!) plus he's a compulsive liar, a selfish loudmouth, and a crook with no heart.

I don't think Trump is destroying this country. I think decades of institutional rot and slimy, money fueled politics is what's destroying this country and what gave Trump his path to power.  Joe Biden has been there spreading the rot and corruption the whole time.
YOU spat on the Democratic process and arranged for other centrists to drop out, people more popular than Biden, in order to stomp out Bernie and ALL the people who supported him.  Please follow the example of Jimmy Carter and stop trying to game the system!  Support democracy!
Communist Party Leader Endorses Joe Biden for President
Biden isn't going to do shit about the Uighur situation, and he sure was fine with letting people die from lack of healthcare before COVID.
I don't care what your roommate from France has to say. I'd love to hear your opinion.  Biden said that in a debate when his vote record came up. His actual line was something like "Bush went back on his word."  That's a fancy way to say you were tricked.
Since you mentioned protests earlier, I'd like to remind you that Biden was part of the administration that brutally cracked down on Occupy, the Ferguson uprising, and Standing Rock.
Biden shares Dubya's and Obama's body counts already. That's well over a million people. Dead. For no good reason. Because we let shit politicians like Joe Biden grasp the levers of power.

By voting for Biden you're rewarding the DNC for screwing over working class people yet again and giving up any and all leverage to shape the agenda.
How would Biden behave differently? He won't do M4A, UBI, or cancel student debt or guarantee housing; which are all things that could help stop the pandemic and revive the economy.
All we're going to get out of Biden is some mealy means tested COVID tax credit for people with less than four limbs but more than four kids who rehabilitated a Brownfield zone in the eighties.
The best choice is to be honest about who Biden is and tell the DNC to kick fucking rocks for putting their finger in the scale for a 1994 Republican.
Look at the big brain on Biden!
This is just like 2016 when people said NO to Hillary Clinton, penciled in Bernie's name, boycotted the election, voted Libertarian, voted Green, or even didn't register to vote. They ALL enabled 4 years of Trump and if they don't vote Biden, 4 more to come!!
Also your characterization of Biden is hilarious and ahistorical.
I don’t watch TV. Try again. And to say Biden and Trump are the same regarding either economic or foreign policy reveals a laughable ignorance on your part.
Biden and other establishment Democrats can't do that because the donor class that they serve, exclusively, might get sad.
Funny how so many of Joe's supporters aren't the ones at most direct risk. Also, hi from MI-06 where #neverJoe took a fat $200K check to campaign for one of the very worst GOP reps. (While the rest of us were out volunteering for the Dem.)
Prediction: Joe Biden will select Gretchen Whitmer as his VP pick. #TTA
Which do you think he's lying about?  That he has a source close to Biden who made the statement or that Biden is mentally declining quickly? You're not clear on that point.
Sara, I thought the same when I first glanced at this. What Trump is referring to is the campaigning Obama did for Hillary in 2016. He campaigned hard for her and she lost. Now it's Biden.
Pushing the lie that "back to normal" with Biden will fix everything is also incredibly short sighted and dangerous.
I know you're a Trump bootlicker, but you can't honestly believe that he is coherent half the time. Hillary "won" all the debates against him. Didn't matter. Biden has nothing to gain.

Crazy how it went from debating the use of 25th Amendment on Trump because he “lacks the cognitive ability to be president”.. to voting for someone [Biden] with clear cognitive decline...so bad that he’s not allowed to leave his house.  This is America 🤦‍♂️
In the US there are times things are uncomfortable for citizens. For example, if Biden is elected he is not my choice but he is still MY PRESIDENT and I will respect that. If he upholds the constitution he's valid, regardless if I agree with him on policy.
Lock Biden and  Obama up and throw away the keys.
It doesn't matter to me when Biden announces his shitty VP pick.  It's not going to be Rep. Barbara Lee or Nina Turner, which by the way would be the only way I'd vote for him, so IDGAF. He can wait until Nov 2nd?!?
This is what I keep saying. There have to be an array of brilliant, luminary liberal minds which could energize the democrats. Why in the fuck is Biden the the nominee (rhetorical).

Smartest play by Joe Biden so far: letting the twitterverse and mainstream media *help* vet potential running mates. (Balancing out whatever the Chris Dodds and Ed Rendells in his world might be telling him.)
Is that Joe Biden being controlled by Jeff Dunham or China President?
Anyone else wonder if the masks are just a way to keep Joe Biden from sniffing children til after the election?
He was upfront about his socialism, they'd have made a bigger deal out of it if he'd tried to hide it. If people were well-read or knew how to use google they would have known what political revolution means. Now Biden's being red-baited and we have a shitty right-wing candidate.

Saw it in SW Michigan. If saying things that aren’t accurate is the plan to advertise against Biden, then there’s plenty of Trump telling lies &amp; being vulgar, sexist &amp; racist to flood the airwaves, right?  He loves the camera, the microphone &amp; the sound of his own voice. 🤔

Yeah because of covid Trump basically gave Biden a free win
Was listening to a podcast on who Biden will pick for the VO and the said if he picked Warren that would appease the “left wing” of the party, and I don’t know if that’s true.
Funny where you stop the audio! Stern: Did you want to bang her?  Trump: Well, at 12, I wasn’t interested. I’ve never been into that. They’ve sort of always stuck around that 25 (years old) category.

Exactly what I was saying in July and now the chickens have come to roost. Due to the artificial barriers, there was a MSM blackout on Bernie, Antifa is propagandized as terrorists, BLM are criminals and Biden has called for the arrest of anarchists.
I have my own opinions on Biden and Trump, but the amount of people sharing information that’s not even close to true, and others believing it is mind blowing. Both parties are absolute jokes. THIS is America.

Mark my words: Biden included the statement that he was “pressured to pick a woman of color” for his VP because he is, in fact, picking a white woman. But he wanted to show his consideration.
Trump isn’t running against Biden.  He’s running against voter fraud and all of Silicon Valley   Don’t worry in the end Trump wins because God wins.   This election is good vs evil  Vote like your life depends on it Because it does
Cops need more political philosophy training -   What if under Biden they intend to arrest anarchists, and end up arresting right-libertarians instead of left-libertarians? Could cost cities millions in human rights violations.

Biden afraid of being interviewed by a conservative leaning reporter .where he not given reprinted softball question. Let alone a full on debate
we will see if it a even match.  When trump just bury him and biden can't even remember where at than debate will be worth it. Everyone know these debate not about substance it about mental status of the candidate . Biden saving grace been covid19 or he be out
It biden that terrified .his dementia meds won't work that late in a day. He will get destroyed in debate. Biden team will push VP debates and give every excuse to get out of presidential debate . if you can not have debate because of covid-19 you can have election either.
Class my ads. Biden is a bigotted democrat. Just like every Democrat before him.
If those on the right could truly recognize signs/symptoms of dementia, we would’ve heard much more about trump’s cognitive/intellectual deficits from them.  Cognitively, Biden’s a shell of his former self, yet still sounds scholarly next to trump. You’d deny that?

These people could easily not do the work for Biden make demands instead fight the DNC call them the fuck out and call Biden the fuck and not make themselves look clownish but nope.
Im sorry but I am kind of in shock seeing these people who are like the voices of the progressive movement just go along with Biden and the DNC.
Seeing all these progressives just going along with this Biden isn’t it but we just gotta do it in order to get Trump where the fuck is the fight in that where are the demands you all are just falling in line and giving Biden a pass you all aren’t even holding his feet to the 🔥
Saying that we must vote for Biden all while he continues to reject progressive policies and then say this shit this gives us a sense of false hope say you do fall in line and vote for Biden he is just magically going to move to the left after he has rejected the left.
Nah fuck that shit I reject Biden.
The article should be called a left wing group falls in line and does the work for Biden.  Like seriously how can anybody be progressive and go along with this shit.
Biden can’t enunciate ‘mental fitness’, so there’s that.

I don’t like calling people stupid, but the VP is just ONE cabinet position. It’s important yes, but any person choosing a Trump cabinet over a Biden cabinet is a straight up idiot and, at the very least imo, a fascist enabler.
Maybe she gets the state of mind Biden is in - country before party.
I honesty don't think Biden meant any harm.  He just doesn't know what he's doing anymore...and that's not meant to be a knock on him.  Unfortunately it happens to many of us as we get up there in age.

Donald Trump disparages Biden’s school records,while hiding his academic ,”accomplishments” from sight.
What about Biden vs. Jesus ?
No he completely changed the story. It was going after the NRA bc of fraud, nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment. He stated that and than dragged in more fake news about Biden. Intelligent people read that actually is happening instead of believing people who make up stuff.
Biden the Gaffe Machine
Makes no difference to me if or how you vote. I respect your freedom to choose.  I choose differently than you and the respect is not reciprocated.  It’s your way or the highway?  Biden has absolutely zero chance at getting my vote.  You could have not nominated him.
Biden should start his convention acceptance speech with a prayer. Send moderate Christians in a SPIRAL.
You know if they really wanted Biden to debate Trump they would at least do some kind of Zoom Debate.
Nigga I don’t really care I’m still voting for Biden
Seeing Biden talk about the latino community is really something he basically says nothing just we got to embrace the latino community we got to stop seperating families we got to include them okay but what exactly are you going to do to help the latino community are you going to
Biden seriously needs to just say what exactly he is going to do what are his plans this vague shit in his videos isn’t good enough.
Zero excitement campaign.  Zero benefit to the voter. Zero to vote to protect.  Zero chance I’m voting Biden.
Maybe. You know you are correct. I am helping trump.  If Biden wasn’t such a shitty nomination I most certainly wouldn’t be helping trump.  Every action has a re action.  Biden caused trump which causes........
My dumb ass voted Hillary.  I thought for sure she would win.   I was wrong.  I’m voting trump this year.  Biden is to far right for my vote. Trump is a protest vote.  If he wins he could completely destroy so many corporate creations. Need to nominate a real Dem in 24.
Biden is the most Republican candidate running. Biden reeks of MAGA.
If I lived through Joe Biden voting with Republicans from 1973-2009 to make himself wealthy and screw the working class...... you can make another 4 years of trump.
Trump said Biden is going to take away God and guns....good! That’s one of many reasons why I’m voting for him.
Damn, Biden sounds incredible. He can hurt GOD?
Guys, Joe Biden is gonna use the black materia to summon meteor if he wins the presidency.
But will you help get him out by voting for Biden? Actually it’s not anyone’s business how people vote. I guess people want to know if you’ll be part of the solution or part of the problem.
Biden is not going to move to the left. Did anybody even see his current ad where he is driving fancy ass car I mean seriously anybody that believes that Biden is going to move to the left is seriously naive if anything he will pander a little.
Don’t talk about supporting progressive policies when your there falling in line telling others to do the same and saying that Biden is moveable and that next cycle we can maybe have the candidate of our choice really?
I mean I don’t get how this is the right thing to do wait around till next cycle to get Biden out instead of making demands I don’t get their whole shit strategy.
Are excluded from the conversation. Biden wouldn’t even support Medicare for All or Student Loan Cancellation? Oh but we all just have to deal with it like always wait around for Biden to do what exactly save the ACA go back to the Obama times slow changes and half measures.
Trump is evil and shit but give us some sign that shit is going to change and that voters are being listened to cause as I see it right now Biden wins but what exactly is going to change for all of us who are out here barely making ends meet cause so far the poor/working class
Im sorry you all can go along with this shit I voted for Hillary in 2016 after being treated like shit by her supporters and there was never an apology from her or calls for her to call out her supporters. Now here we are doing this again but with Biden but instead Biden has
Honestly in the Settle with Biden and this Vote Trump Out shit bothers me why are progressives doing the work for him when he and his campaign should be doing the work.
They say that Biden is moveable when did he support progressive policies?
This bothers me. Basically the left falls in line again instead of demanding that Biden earn peoples votes. I live in Michigan and will be voting green and shaming those that vote green is  not it.
Yeah, Biden is a complete mess.
All good questions. I also heard that people didn't fill it out because Trump or Biden wasn't on it. Lots of voters are in the habit of ignoring primaries or misunderstanding them.
Lol relax “ Q “.   Pelosi, Biden, Schumer, and many many more are owned by the exact same Corporate elite as every Republican.  Puppets on a string.  Any Democrat who voted with Republicans is a Republican.  They all take orders from same corporate interests.
Joe Biden can't wait to find out who his running mate will be.
Yes. Detroit area. Some big ones, too. Mostly homemade.   The Biden people need to be giving away signs. NOW
Sorry but Biden his campaign and the Dems are clowns if they wanted leftists/progressives to vote for them they would do better if they wanted unity they would not continue to talk shit about the left or do everything to stop progressive candidates and policies from winning
Posting Fuck Donald Trump isn’t stopping that fucking nightmarish piece of shit there needs to be a plan to hold his ass accountable I am not seeing any of these settle with Biden people talking about they just believe that if we get him out shit is just going to stop being
Im sorry but this is not Biden doing the work. Has Biden even talked at all about defunding/abolishing ICE and releasing the immigrant children at the detention centers???????
I don’t think anybody is advising him I think they are just letting him do whatever he wants. The campaign seems to not care their whole thing is we got to get Trump out vote for Biden cause he’s not Trump and that should be good enough it’s all very entitled and out of touch.
Where are the demands from these progressive orgs telling us to settle for Biden that Biden start doing the work to earn our vote. We can’t just wait around while shit gets worst that’s some real privileged shit to tell someone who is struggling oh just wait around for Biden
Im sorry but no. Progressives/leftists should not have to do the work for Biden he should be out there doing everything to earn their vote.
Im sorry but I will not be voting for Biden Vote Green. This whole wait till next cycle to get Biden out won’t cut it. Roots Nation should be demanding they replace him instead cause he is not it.

😂😂. Ohhh Kay?  The biggest issue with Democrats is they are turning into Republicans.  Check out Joe Biden’s 40 year voting Record.  It makes Mitch McConnel look like a liberal.  We have a dimwitted Republican vs a spastic clown Republican to pick from this election. Good luck.
Why isn’t Biden out there more? He is trying to be the president.
They are both nearly equally terrible, obviously Trump is worse for human rights. But they're both pedos and in Trumps case a definite rapist. Biden could be as well we just don't know yet. And Biden is a huge unknown, he could be worse than we even imagined if he wins.
Yeah, I totally get that get that. And Trump is definitely a worse person than Biden, my tweet was mostly just referring to the fact that IF we had Trump another 4 years at least we'd be done with him after that.
That's not how I feel, I was just making a statement. I definitely don't prefer Trump to Biden.............. And I wasn't 100% serious about the Bernie tweet. It's Twitter.......  I really have no idea what to do so don't judge based on two tweets.
If your a resist pro Biden account or a Republican please don’t follow me. 🙏
We should all be demanding that they replace Biden with Bernie cause this clown isn’t it.
So vote Trump out by giving Biden the nomination even though he did not deserve it and then make demands after he is elected as if Biden as if he is going to do anything what is this shit.
should we settle every single one of these leftist orgs should be demanding that Biden do the fucking work and if he is not willing to do that then call them all the fuck out call the party out and demand they fucking replace him.
Biden won’t even debate or be at the convention. I hate Trump I think he is garbage but how is doing the work for Biden and his campaign going to push him to the left Biden keeps being given everything he also keeps getting free passes for barely doing nothing.
Seeing so called progressives literally doing the work for Biden while Biden does absolutely nothing really bothers me. If you all want leftists to vote for Biden then deman he do the work and step it the fuck up.
I will be voting green cause honestly fuck Biden and the DNC.
So let me get this straight you are going to be doing the work for Biden to get progressives to vote for him. Why is everybody doing this for Biden????
And I will not be supporting RootsAction.
I think they are so desperate to get a Democrat in office, they are overlooking A LOT of issues with Joe Biden.
Was the army really scrambling for 23 year olds? This lil political propaganda video you like so much is grasping at so many straws. Did Biden serve? Or #BillClintonIsAPedo ? Did he? Lol  Are you a vet?
These demonic DemocRATS are totally disgusting to our Nation and National Security. The Obama Cabal had their crosshairs aimed at Trump from the very beginning. And when he WON, it is OBVIOUS that this IS a Coup d'e'tat. No question. Because Trump WON. And Biden knew about it too
criminal and so unethical  ask Biden why was this allowed under your admin  and Planned Parenthood won't return monies from Govt - refusing - what is Biden's position
Biden can’t even complete sentence. 😂😂😂
At least don’t vote at all. You can’t really want Biden. 40yr career politician who’s never actually helped anyone but himself unless it was a coincidence. So crooked he can’t talk straight anymore &amp; There’s videos of him being “strange” w/kids. Trump’s gotten really bad press.
Sadly, Biden is not is the same shape mentally that he was in. Something is going seriously wrong with Biden. As Americans, why can't we just pull together and not against anyone? #AmericansNeedToStandTogether
Joe Biden can't wait to find out who they pick to be his running mate!
Crap, Biden doesn't want to share the same stage with that lying fool getting insulted and I don't blame him. He saw what happened  to Hillary. Lol Biden say I'm too old for that blank.
Biden may not be the swiftest, but THIS guy should not make this election about mental acuity. Yikes.
#letitrip President Trump is Losing Ground on his Presidential General Election. Biden will get the Advantage.
Joe Biden's VP committee includes this guy and Chris Dodd, so there's that.
If you get the panel I would absolutely do a Jews for Biden panel discussion/fundraiser: “A shonda: my name and what I’m doing about it”
Susan Rice. Another great reason she’d be the perfect VP for Joe Biden. 🇺🇸 #SusanRice #BidenRice #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #ricktyler
Be canned at Biden's 😂
Not like I was going to vote for Biden anyway.
Republican operatives are pushing for Kanye to keep going so more votes are taken away from Biden. WAKE TF UP PEOPLE!!!!!!
She’s the fucking worst. I’m on record, I’ve said what I said, I will not vote for a biden/Harris ticket.
We will on Nov 3rd when Biden is elected
problem described here isn’t minority rule. The problem is that one branch has become the All Powerful Oz.  Also, of course Trump shouldn’t care about the national vote. Neither should Biden. Had Hillary won it would’ve been minority rule too, just less spaced out geographically
You mean BIDEN is fighting DNA results in a rape case. Everyone forgot about the recent allegations against him. The press is SILENT.😔
Just explained to my family that I can’t vote for trump or Biden because neither of them made Late Registration. Neither of them could make a record like Yeezus. My uncle asked me if I was on crack
Harris is so charming. She’s also smarter than Biden
We do. Joe Biden is a decent man who has spent 40 years of his life serving the nation. Trump is a crook who has spent just as long ripping people off.
You should do something about that then man. The difference could not be more clear! Trump is incompetent and puts his own personal profit ahead of our safety. Biden is neither of those. For that reason alone Trump must go.
For further proof of just how on-brand this is, look at how many Joe Biden + Corvette stories there are on
I can't wait for another round of Joe Biden memes.
In 2016 Trump running opposed got about 480,000 votes Joe Biden, even with people still voting for Bernie Sanders who got 500,000 votes, just got over 800,000.
Our country faces many problems and Joe Biden isn't the answer to any of them.
Sounds like you won’t be voting for Biden then
Like the rest of us Joe Biden can't wait to find out who they pick as his running mate...
Their confidence that Kanye will take more Black voters from Biden than likes-voting-for-weird-celebrities voters from Trump is probably unfounded.
If Joe Biden were president, we wouldn't have to pay Elon Musk and Russia to take us to space.
No...are you cognitively challened?  Biden said that his rigorous and active campaign and interview presence was equal to a daily test...try to keep up...you're a major news outlet.
If Michelle Obama is picked as his VP I predict a huge shift on moneyline odds:   Biden -300 (favorite) Trump +425 (underdog) #Odds #MichelleMoneyLine
I do not give shit. Write it down tell the world.  Biden voted away my pension before I was old enough to work. Biden has sucked the Corp d for 40 years. Making himself wealthy at our expense.  I 100 % don’t care.  Progress can be painful
Joe Biden can't wait to find out who they pick to be his running mate...
Let’s not forget that Mr Biden will have Media allies to help him if he gets into a jam.
I think he should do it at the WH!    Joe Biden will no longer travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
Joe Biden is our modern day Weekend at Bernie's.
Joe Biden is our modern day Weekend At Bernie's.

Look say what you want about Biden, but most people, when asked if they need to take a test to prove that their brain works, would respond the same way. Trump's the only one who thinks the point of the test is to get extra points.
Bless his heart. At least Biden provides us some laughter...bittersweet...he may be a good man at heart..but his mind is just not up to the task....sad. #MAGA2020 #BidenNeedsToRetire #BidenIsPitiful #HowCanGoodPeopleSupportAbortion?
You don’t have to get it.  If you are voting for Biden there is much you don’t get.

We are.... Biden 2020
As a Democrat we’re all worried about Biden. I voted for Bernie, but now Biden is gonna have to do. But the fact is, Trump is the worst we’ve ever had. It’s not just hyperbole when you hear someone say that “anyone is better than Trump”. That’s a fact.
Oh lord well then it’s a good thing Hunter Biden has never, in any way, held a government job.
Any questions?   46 Minutes Of Joe Biden Talking Nonsense  via
Lmao because they know Trump would destroy Biden.
Them and a lot of the KHivers and Biden people are in meltdown mode.
Thanks! Now I know how I WON’T vote!! You want your Dems to take this with them to the polls or just print it out and submit it as their phony ballot? Not a bad idea since they can’t think for themselves — just like your buddy Biden!
Joe Biden was most recently seen in public attending the funeral of Rep. John Lewis. Where was our(current) President while one of our Civil Rights heroes was laid to rest?
Easy vote out that POS in November!!!! Vote blue!!! Vote Biden!!!! #Biden2020Landslide #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS #BlueWave2020TakeOver
BLM and Antifa rioting in Democrat Socialist controlled cities are receiving political cover from the Democrat Socialist mayors and governors. There are articles showing the DNC and Biden Campaign providing bail money and other funding.
The longer you tolerate this shitty ACA the longer you will tolerate Corporate Puppet Nominations like Biden.  Vote against Biden.  Trump may end the ACA.  Opens up the floor for Medicare 4 All.
I’m voting against Biden. Idgaf who that corporate puppet picks. Whoever it is they voted against too.
If we’re being real, fuck Biden, but at least he’s not the “it is what it is” guy.
I was watching and listening to this. I can’t wait until this comes out. Also the Biden’s and the Ukraine.
Biden is like a cheating husband. For 40 years he voted against us and was paid handsomely to do so. This idiot voted to cut social security twice.
Sugar, cupcake, we don’t need Joe Biden. We demand Medicare for all. Sweetheart you had a chance to get the Boomers, the minority’s, the working class, and the young.  You chose Biden.  Buttercup don’t expect to win. You might but I am out on Corporate Joe.  Sugarplum
Biden can’t handle Chris Wallace let alone a real reporter like Tucker. Of course the fake news wants a fake president to put on a show with.   Trump shoots from the hip with real bullets. We should appreciate how impressive that is instead of criticizing every time he misses.
No Medicare for all. No vote for Biden. Maybe 2024 if not no vote for whoever the corporate puppet nominee is.
I do. I need a lot more than Corporate pole smoker Joe Biden can offer.  He voted across the aisle against us in a bi partisan manner for over 40 years. He made himself rich doing so. Rewarded by corps who enslave the working class.  Trump is ok by me.
Well, #Democrat  has this going for him, the Revolutionary Communist Party has endorsed him  #tcot #gop #migop
Here we go, #Democrats already trying to "protect"  saying he shouldn't debate President   #tcot #gop #migop
Thank you, sir. 🇺🇸#biden #JoeBiden
You really want Biden. That is the most polite comment I’ve seen defending him.  You deserve a pass on a truck load of Biden hate I’m looking to bury someone in.
I’m not for Biden
Elizabeth Warren deserves to be Biden’s pick for VP. Period. 🇺🇸 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #elizabethwarren #DNC
It's my understanding that Fox is not "news" but rather an entertainment channel so why would Biden waste his time?
Honestly people love to claim Biden has dementia, but ignore Trump’s  complete lack of ability to form a cohesive thought, understand graphs or statistics at a 2nd grade level (see: axios interview) or even pronounce Yosemite correctly. Disclaimer: I’m also not a fan of Biden
The Jill Biden interview was NOT surprising: phony smiles, phony statements, phony comments, especially, when she said that Joe is "moderate". Ha-ha-ha! I don't know what else we could expect from her?
Joe Biden has embraced the policies of the far-Left  Joe Biden will RAISE your taxes  Joe Biden will grant amnesty to 11 MILLION illegal immigrants  And, Joe Biden will KILL American jobs
Biden doesn’t resort to fairytales,like Trump does.Biden has not told tall tales about George Washington’s arevolutionary war Air Force,or the Bowling Green massacre.
Hurry, put him on the same anti-senile medication that joe Biden’s taken.
He says Biden could have, but didn't. What took Trump so long? Just in time for election. Too little, too late.
lol Biden only gives a fuck about money. Thinking he wouldn't make the same choices as Trump is delusional. And I said I'd ALMOST rather, because then he couldn't come back after the next 4 years are over. Again, let me explain before jumping to conclusions.
And you think Biden would be a better choice for any of that than Trump? I don't. The way I see it, our next president is going to fuck everything up no matter what. I think you misinterpreted my stance because Twitter doesn't really allow for me to fully elaborate on my view.
Can we get to the part where Biden wakes up in the shower and the entire Democratic Primary season was his dream?
So that's where Joe Biden is hanging out.

We’ll see. Damn shame that Biden is the best they have to offer. Suspect he’s their placeholder.
On the bright side, Joe Biden may not have to spend a penny on ads. Just run the Axios interview on a repeating loop every day through Nov 3.
Then-VP Joe Biden wrote a letter to an anonymous rape victim whose victim statement had gone viral for its eloquence. There was no reason to believe that she would later shed her anonymity and share this information.
Me watching my friend in Italy’s insta stories (depicting a totally back-to-normal life and super fun summer) each day.   Please volunteer for Joe Biden.
I think it's important to tune him out, to de-emphasize him. I believe in the Lincoln Project, and will vote for Biden.
Work hard? Do tell us when does Trump work hard? He has done nothing about the pandemic, nothing in regards to protests except to call his own citizens anarchists, people who have lost their jobs, health care.... Nothing. Sure, go after Biden for not working hard. Gtfo
Something needs to be done and NOW. Trump appointed post master general and they are hatching a devious plant to deny o/t, have layoffs thus slowing down and/or invalidate the election thru mail-in ballots. This is all over YouTube and Dems doing nothing-no Biden ads, no action.
yes and then play back Biden's own words that he used during the Primary -    should do this anyways - if Pres wants additional debates
Should get a jammer in there just for fun, make it screech in his ear or start playing funny lines of Biden’s on repeat in his ear
So Cher when are you going to be going to Washington to be in President elect Joe Biden's Cabinet. I'm sure he can put in one of the cabinet seats.
Joe Biden can’t debate a 5th grader or a trained parrot 🤷‍♀️
Joe Biden can’t debate a 5th grader 🤦‍♀️ ... scratch that , he couldn’t debate a trained parrot 🤷‍♀️
How STUPID IS OMAR? BIDEN is running in a basement NOT ON A PLATFORM - BITCH!
It really doesn't matter. It's all on Trump's watch. Good luck trying to convince voters that it'll get worse if Biden's elected. I can just see the ads. "I'm Don the Con. I've turned the U.S. into a cesspool and screwed the American people but if Joe's elected it'll be worse.
B for Biden.   That’ll be a NO on A for Asshole.
#DearMichigan  My fellow Michiganders, please vote 11/3/20 to end this nightmare and put Biden in our house !  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
You've got a real inferiority complex. You wouldn't see Biden supports because we've got better things to do than watch you drive down the road.
Someone in Biden's camp has mapped out a great campaign. Simply let Trump hang himself.
Tomorrow you'll have Jill Biden on your 2pm show. Are you going to ask her harsh ???, like WHY DID YOU ALLOW YOUR SICK HUSBAND TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT? IS HE GOING TO DEBATE TRUMP OR YOU HIDE HIM AGAIN IN YOUR BASEMENT? We'll be watching!
We all know why the Democrats and liberal news media are afraid to let Biden debate Trump.
GOP PAC restoration something or other campaign ad showing Biden in 1987 talking about his school, IQ then saying he has never been right for the presidency. Not a good track. For every 1 Biden sound bite, we have 50 for Bonespurs
Great show about Biden.   please share must watch show. Biden worse than we thought.   Ep. 1312 A Warning Everyone Needs to Hear About Biden - The Dan Bongino ...  via
Trump’s ratings will be high when they announce how bad he loses to Joe Biden!
I’m voting for trump.  I am casting my vote for the gent who goes by Donald  J Trump.  Not sure what all this a vote for this equals that.  I hate Biden.
If asking about corruption becomes a crime, we're all in trouble in this country.   Why aren't you concerned with Biden’s involvement in Ukraine as he's running for president yet you're upset that Trump wants to know what the hell was going on?   Ukraine is charging Biden
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  i think he's right...
Joe Biden is not the answer to any known question.
I feel sorry for you if you have faith in Biden 🤣 dude can't even remember he's running
Honestly at this point, Biden is just as bad. I'd almost rather have Trump another 4 years then be done with his ass, then hopefully Biden doesn't try to run again. Jorgenson sucks ass too. We're just fucked no matter what.
This should be a commercial! Trump debates “Robo Biden”
The real magic of this hell map is Biden getting a PA call early on and cable shows spending 3 hours talking about it being over, "especially if AZ is as a close as it appears"
I really don’t understand why this is considered such a close race. Biden’s base includes young people who want to see socialism reign, or older people who just can’t stand Trump. The voting system is a joke. Biden is a puppet for the radical left. Is this what you want?
He is afraid to do an interview w/ Chris Wallace and now debates.    Of course we know exactly what they're afraid of!    Just say it,  Joe Biden's incapable and President Trump will rightly win!
Biden can't wait to find out who he picked to be his running mate...
"He's clean and articulate" - Joe Biden
No leadership by Trump caused this. Vote for Joe Biden!
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Yes indeed! Michigan vote for Joe Biden!
If you want to be optimistic, this map is also the funny President Biden, Vice President Pence map
Maybe.  You are probably right. A gambling man would say the candidates who name are pre printed on the ballot have a much greater chance of winning than a write in.  I’m not voting for trump to win. I’m voting to cause Biden’s loss.
Nope.  But I’m voting trump. I hate them both.  This Biden nomination is so disgusting I’m voting like Biden did for 40 years with the wrong side.
Be aware of new "grass roots" movement of Dems NOT TO HAVE the debates btw Biden &amp; Trump. The obvious reason is NOT that Trump will say "lies" and Joe will "correct" it. They just cannot allow sick man to show his SICKNESS! The liars CANNOT full the TrumpTrain! #Trump2020 !
No they didn't, go further away from Detroit...further north the more Trump signs you will see! I haven't see one Biden sign at all
Unlike Trump,Biden realizes that it’s way past time,for our country to pay its bills.Trump has been maxing out,our credit cards.
Joe Biden and the Democrats,will deliver the vaccine,that will bring an end to the. utter lunacy,that has been the Trump era
Biden doesn’t know what day it is 😂
You making me pick Biden is your choice?   It’s an analogy and a damn good one. The play on words is Trump is AIDS, but Biden is better or HIV pos.  I didn’t actually think you have to pick one anymore than you think I’m voting Biden.
Please read this!
Biden not debating Trump makes him look weak as fuck.
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
You are correct. Tea Party stated they would not vote for Candidates not far enough Right.  President Obama won all 3 branches.  Mid term GOP took much back. Then they blocked virtually everything for next 6 years.   Biden loses because of a protest vote. Maybe then???
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Joe Biden is about as radical as Mitt Romney.
Joe Biden is as far left as George Bush.
If I said you have to have a sexual relationship with a HIV positive person or an equally attractive person with full blown AIDS.  How would respond without being “ Juvenile “ ?   Biden sucks. Not worth voting for. If you disagree tell me again are you gunna date AIDS or HIVpos?
Why is Joe Biden sniffing Idaho? Its crazy times we live in.
Dear America,Bring back sanity to our  Biden.
Have seen more signs for Joe Biden than I ever did for Hillary Clinton and it's still very few.   The Biden campaign should be giving out yard signs everywhere. It's heartening and encouraging to see other Blue voters putting it out there.   That is what creates enthusiasm.
Biden has held a political position for over 40 years... you think he’s going to change things now? #GTFOH
Trumps a Republican like Biden. They never do anything for the working class.
Ryan blocked me a while ago for calling him out for his ridiculous attacks on Biden... and I voted for Sanders earlier this year when he was still in the race for the nomination.
I don't blame Biden. I wouldn't want to be subjected to Trump's insults and lies either. That's a good strategy.
Jason, you said it! Biden 2020. 🇺🇸 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Trump hasn’t done any damage! I don’t want Biden! And I don’t want to live in a socialist Country! Biden had over 50 years to do something ! He did nothing!He has Dementia and no one saids anything!

Keep them coming and focus on the Task Force plans from Bernie/Biden teams and emphasize Biden plans to have govt control everything and zoning of suburbs
Do more Townhalls, do video debates with yourself and than a video screen where Biden responds as he did through the Primary to questions
Thanks +rest of Media especially biased Wallace/Neil/Bret - who were MIA w the Huge Scandal of a pattern of Spying by Obamagate,O/Biden for 8 yrs - spied on Merkel, spied on All Americans/Clapper lied about it; spied on AP, Rosen/Family so whey surprised he spied on Oppo campaign
Looks promising...but the only poll that counts is the one taken on election day.  The only thing I'm sure of is that Joe Biden is not the person to look to when trying to fix any problem whatsoever.
Why do we need New material when the old stuff is so accurate and effective? Projection. Your cult leader uses it every day. "If Biden gets elected there'll be rioting and chaos" while, there's rioting and chaos. At least Biden won't kill off 155,000 people for Obama's economy.
Steve Hilton warns Trump campaign is 'sleepwalking into a Biden presidency': 'Wake Up'  #FoxNews
Not trying to be sacrilegious, but as Joe Biden say 'You know the thing'!
All I'm sure of is that Joe Biden isn't the answer to any problem the country is currently grappling with.
If we do not vote for vice president Joe Biden for presidency in 2020 this can happen to us again.... #VoteBidenToSaveAmericaPlease.
They know that they're gonna have their ass handed to em in November so they're just practicing and getting warmed up for when Biden is elected. The only time they give a rats ass about the debt and deficit is when a dem is in office. That's the only time they're conservative.
Ultimately this is why “looking forward and not back” was the biggest mistake of the Obama era. The Biden era must be different.
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
I voted for Hillary after Wasserman Schultz assisted in the cheating of Bernie.  This year,after Bernie dropped out, I committed to voting straight Republicans entire ballot. And I sent Jen in Florida running against Wasserman Schultz money instead of Biden.
Biden could pick Jesus Christ as his VP and it doesn’t matter. He himself voted against the working class for 40 years.  He himself voted to cut social security. He himself is a rapist. He himself got his moron kid a million dollar a year scam from Ukraine.  Hell no to Joe
I agree.  Im not afaraid of trump burning this corrupt corporate system to the ground.                                      Biden is also a Republican so neither one are worth voting for.  Another 4 more years of trump is what the DNC deserves for this Biden bullshit
I like Trump more than Biden.  Trump fucks off most days doing nothing. Biden will be on point doing everything his corporate puppet masters order him to daily.  Plus Biden spent 40 years in office voting with GOP. I’ll pass.
That is not fair.  Biden sucks.  Shall we count the times he voted against the working class over his 40 years in office?  Voting to cut Medicare is the reason I am voting trump myself.  Terrible nomination. Good luck though.
Meanwhile Orange man fake right? I think Biden was right! Y'all are being played like a fiddle. Obama got blacker!  tickles my giggle box.😂😆😆
I can’t afford a Republican like Biden in office.  Trump may completely destroy Wall Street, Big Banking..... this clown could collapse everything!!!  I’d ❤️ to see him burn down this disgusting corporate welfare system.
I’m voting for trump.  I may have my entire ballot blood red until 2024.  Biden’s 40 year voting record is the reason.  Vote against me, f you.
Pathetic this includes CNN lite  and  Wallace missed this + missed the huge scandals of Obama/Biden pattern of spying throughout 8 yrs w the Scandal of spying on Oppo party Wallace Bret read   articles&gt; thanks to
This just shows that Biden will not fight for us whatsoever and is not going to be able to even fight the Republican party when trying to pass policies.Who ever said he was perfect, not me, I do have some hate over trump once again, I don’t think he’s perfect by any means and their are some things he should be way better on, but he’s miles better than Biden. So I’m going with the better option
Btw I’m not part of the corruption people that think Biden’s the best, I see the facts for what they are, so quit saying shit that’s not right about me.
Or Biden who doesn't know what job he's running for
He isn’t, even if he is sorta or kinda bad, he’s doing what needs to be done for this country plain and simple. Also Biden can’t even speak a sentence without having notes, that’s a bit concerning.
Exactly &amp; you’re trying to prove that Biden is Innocent, you’re Dumb he’s Not Innocent! At all! He’s corrupt just like the others, Pelosi, Obama, Etc.
Thank you for this. Biden is a man whose faith has been tested through his life and has found solace,peace and strength in his Catholicism.  There are no words to describe how immoral Trump is but craven and despicable come to mind.
I understood that there is a grieving period for what could’ve been, so I waited to speak, but now that it has been many months since the Democratic primaries effectively ended I want to say: that a vote for anyone (or not voting) other than Biden is a vote for 45.
It will be used against Biden 💯. God the Democrats are cursed.
Exactly. I think this will be anti Biden. 😡
I like how Biden can be low-key racist and show clear brain deterioration in the same interview and the Democratic party are still like "yup, that's our best shot in the entire country!".
It's sad, but Joe Biden has caused much harm in his long public career which is even sadder for the many people he has harmed.
One. Went to the UP this weekend. Lots of Trump signs and Our governor is an idiot signs but only one Biden sign.
Joe Biden has offered his condolences
This isn’t about COVID. It’s about Biden’s inability to competently engage in a cogent discussion.
Dems already rigged the general election for trump when they rigged the primaries for biden
Well, little joe was trained by One of the best growlers in the history of our nation. We should expect a global kneeling tour conducted by Biden. 🙄🙄🙄
I don't think you need to worry about VP.  Please examine your own mental health if you plan on voting for Biden.  Anyone who votes for a candidate with dementia is literally insane, or doesn't love the USA. #Trump2020 #MAGA2020
"If Joe Biden is elected president that chaos and bloodshed will spread to every community in our land. You'll have a Portland everywhere,”  said.  He exudes desperation w/every word he says, rivaled only by his idiocy.
Ok and Your point about Biden being a good guy. Man oh man, also I could careless about either of them being pedos because you won’t win with that, but I wasn’t bringing that up, he brought that up, I was stating with the other reasons besides that
And you’re saying Biden isn’t?! What a joke! It’s funny how you ignore when Biden says a racist sentence but you don’t for trump. He isn’t fit in office, he won’t be in office for more than 90 days I bet you, someone will take over because he can’t handle it
And so is over half the country worrying about what’s going to happen to our great country if Biden and more Democrats get in office!
And you took a big shit right on the casket... campaigning for Biden at a funeral... a new low even for you
"What is he going to do between the time he loses and Biden is sworn in?" You must be thinking of  and
Its never going to stop spreading.  WTF.  How long until you let us free?  Oh I just heard, if Biden wins the very next day.
If Biden wins that report and any possible indictments are GONEExclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden via
Polls are likely to continue to tighten as the election draws nearer and Trump's misinformation machine churns on. We cannot get complacent, and we must do everything we can to reach voters.
We'd have a blast and fly our Biden 2020 flag high!! 😊😊
All Biden needs to do is smile and say nobody likes you and the narcistic ass will lose it
This is gonna be the hardest to flip in Oakland.  If Rochester Hills is this blue in November Biden has gotta be close to 60% in the County.
just stop talking please 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
In my opinion EPIC is just coming down to earth. Their last poll was too optimistic for Dems.   It’s gonna be between 8-12 points for Biden so 11 is pretty strong.
Biden versus Trump. Some speculate that the future of the republic hinges on the outcome of the next election. But for smart investors it doesn't really matter who wins.
So unfair. Boo hoo. Unprecedented. Biden would have won otherwise. Thanks JA for your courage and insight.
The folks you speak of were united against Biden (and every Democrat for that matter) long before this...
Kanye West indicates, in a Forbes interview via text, that he is in fact running to siphon votes from the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.  🖕🏽 Off  you mental sack of shit.
Biden is truly the druck ass uncle at the family picnic that everyone stays away from
Everything you said was true up until "we're gonna vote Trump in November." That last bit is just crazy. I get holding Biden's feet to the fire... But when has Trump given a smidge about Black Americans?
Considering that God is supposed to be omnipotent, it seems to me that having the ability to hurt him would be a selling point for Biden.
Some reporter needs to ask Susan Collins if she thinks Biden has the Presidential authority, or even ability, to hurt God.
Every time a Joe Biden video pops up on my TL I’m reminded that he is a legitimately bad candidate and that Democrats have just decided to go all in on the “well at least he isn’t Trump” concept. What a joke.
Biden Vs God
Damn this guy is scared of Biden.   How powerful does he think the US Presidency actually is?
So what are you saying? Biden should turn himself as black?
people's blacked out profile pictures lasted longer than the 'police abolitionist Joe Biden' bit did lmao
Jo Biden doesn't even realize that he's doing the bidding of Satan.
#1 is simple enough to check on...see their work product. If they’re doing good work to hurt Trump/GOP and help Biden/Dems, it shows. So far most of their ads/videos have been decent to excellent. Think  is getting rich off of it? Beats me, but I doubt it.
There seem to be 3 main concerns among Dems about    etc: 1. What if it’s just a scam/grift? 2. What if they turn on Biden/Dems the moment he/they take control &amp; work against us? 3. Even if they’re legit, Dem $ should go to Dems!
Good point about the election. Maybe you could do a segment about Biden versus Trump stocks? Certainly energy up Trump down Biden.
He’s an asshole but who else do I vote for??? Senile Biden.  U all had another Democrat option in Brenda Jones but went with the terrorist supporting antisemite.  🤷‍♂️
Love you Biden!!!! Get that grown baby outta there!!!!
I think one debate is enough and Biden should incorporate Obama is a much better President than you...…….And watch Donny lose it!
Joe Biden said I’m not black if I don’t vote for him 😭
It's also a very small city. The Bloomfield Twp percentage will be more critical and I'll be looking to Orion, Independence, and Commerce too.   Biden won't win those last three but the percentages will matter.
I don't know. Democrats are running their strongest candidate ever against him and straight-ticket voting is back.   I think Biden will win Oakland County by at least 100,000 votes so Bouchard, calculating for drop-off needs probably 75,000 Biden voters - That's not small.
Joe Biden get 60% in Oakland County challenge.
Biden isn't hiding he just doesn't have to say anything to show his superiority over Trump......Trump does that for him
And he makes fun of joe Biden 😄
Hey trump team...I think it’s safe to say it’s time to put the “Biden is losing his marbles” bit in the trash....
Putin is pulling his strings. He is owning Trump, and will do what he can to destabilize us by making truth impossible to discern.  We need Russian experts to join Biden camp
Based on what I'm hearing Biden will win Detroit.
Biden is being smart ! He doesn't need to say anything , He is sitting back letting Donny dig a big hole for himself
I watch it in like Thank You God That Obama Not our President and Thank You God That hilary ain't because Obama Biden Hilary really Fuck this Country into a Coma and Thank You President Trump for all you do and my first vote will be for President Trump #TrumpBeatsBidenAss
Sooo there like 11k of you give or take most of you not even in the USA pathetic but what ever Nov 3rd #TrumpBeatsBidenAss #NoBallsBiden  You all be like 😭😭😭 Your alls bitching and crying be music to our ears to think biden can do what Hillary Couldn't thats adorable
Except old KKK all the biden is incapable of debating a toddler!
I blame the Trump admin for not being prepared and denying it's existence. I blame them for promoting early reopenings which caused even more unnecessary death.  He failed.  I am absolutely positive if Clinton was president (or Biden), there would be many fewer deaths from Covid.
What intimidates me is the idiots with a Biden or Hillary number sticker driving the opposite direction the arrows on the ground point and cussing at others for them driving the wrong way.
#BasementJoe... Biden should not debate President Trump, Clinton’s ex-WH spokesman says
JFK won the South and Texas and the election in great part to his VP choice LBJ. Biden helped Obama with White voters. Bush 2 had help from his VP. Going back to Lincoln. Andrew Johnson helped him win the South. Usually they make little difference but not always. No LBJ. No JFK.
I’m not bullying you. Do what you want. I’m just saying that if you’re a U.S. citizen who has the ability to vote for Joe Biden in the 2020 general election and willingly chooses not to, fuck you.
Trump is terrible. Fuck you if you still won’t vote for Biden.
100 bucks says if Biden wins and Democrats end up with 51 seats in the Senate that RBG announces retirement in the first hundred days.
SpaceX and NASA successfully return space ship and astronauts to earth. Joe Biden still lost in space.
Still nothing... VOTE BIDEN!
Is Clyburn, signaling it’s ok for Biden to choose a non black VP? Trial balloon?
Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate
Trump pulled an inside straight draw and barely won the election and governed like he had a mandate like Reagan 84.  Trump is going to lose in a landslide to Biden.
Son joe Biden veneers crazy big
as long as Biden has a pulse
Fact check: Trump distorts Biden's position on fracking
According to Joe Biden, "they ain't black". Lol
Obama and Biden tried for 8 years to kill the middle class. Now theyve upped the game and want full blown global socialism. You know how many people die in socialism? How many is a global one gonna get? Lets not find out #Trump2020Landslide
I fully expect Joe Biden to pick his running mate before they print the ballots!
We know they lied and hold them to account, because there is no doubt thag Joe Biden will lose. Just talk about it in public. Youll see. Hes already lost. Covid isnt the only fear they have been conditioning.
Ready to meet President Biden?  It's in your future.  LOVE YOU!!!
So I see Trump is officially campaigning for Biden now...
I envision all the Democratic candidates except for the Hawaii and love dust women plus a few more invitees sitting with Biden and debating who should take what post.They can pull straws if two people want the same job.  VP is tough-group votes for one from Biden’s short list?🍀
You don’t study politics. Rendell was a well known politician for years. He isn’t going to pick the VP. Biden will.
Trump’s Poll Numbers SURGE Passed Obama’s as Biden Campaign Begins to IM...  via
Well, Biden's stated point-blank that it WILL be a woman, so they're just gonna have to deal with that regardless.  As for her "not being black enough"...Obama had a white mother and is relatively light-skinned, so that makes zero sense to me...but I'm a white dude, so (shrug)...
You have the older people even more worried. Stop worrying about Trump like a 9th grade cheerleader.. He's the President. You and Biden better worry bout if you have jobs after this year. The way it looks a 10 year old could do it better than you.
"Terrified" of Biden's massive draw...
More lies.
Also, the best way for Harris *to* position herself for another run at POTUS would be to DO EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO ENSURE BIDEN'S AGENDA IS SUCCESSFUL.  Undermining him behind the scenes isn't gonna make her look good, it'll just make it more likely that a Republican wins in 2024.

⁦ Shit, is this right?  That Biden will likely end up enjoined from any attempt to grant new DACA applications?
I feel better about both of those and if Biden is doing well he could expand in those areas.
There is really no choice, I will be voting for Biden. I can’t handle another 4 years of Trump!
This echoes Biden levels of racism. Likening poor people to non-whites. Race was not relevant here until you brought it up.
it's interesting watching the Biden campaign attempt to court the suburban 'middle class' (small business bourgeois)  at the same time that there's this culture war going in which we're supposed to believe that white ppl in the middle of the country are all irredeemable racists
Does that mean we should accept 26K dying/yr? Of course not. That's why the House passed ACA 2.0. That's why Biden's plan would be ACA 2.0 + a robust PO. Maybe it'll get through, maybe not. Hopefully we can cut it down to, say, 10K/yr over the next four years.
You haven’t read Biden’s plan, nor have you read the ACA 2.0 bill just passed by the House, have you?
They don’t want a hearing they want a linching mob. That is a dictatorship or communism, we tell you what it is you don’t have a say in anything we are the dukes and dutches. A view of the inside of the World Order, if Biden becomes president.Yes, noted devout Roman Catholic Joe Biden is the anti-Bible candidate who wishes to hurt God, not the dude who didn't know it's 2nd Corinthians, and had protestors violently removed from a church for a photo op.  But tell me more about how Biden is Sephiroth, please.
You’re certainly not a lawyer! Perhaps you (and even a law student) student should post such a list of Joe Biden’s actual behavior.... but don’t use the standard of “I heard it on Facebook so it must be true”. 🙄
Facebook removes pro-Trump ad aimed at Joe Biden, claiming false information
Why can't we call Biden Beijing Biden he loves China so and he will not make a good POTUS!!!! mail in ballets will not work put your mask on and vote.
Gutfeld on Biden ducking the debates | Fox News
Communist Party Leader Endorses Joe Biden for President
I don’t watch TV. Try again. And to say Biden and Trump are the same regarding either economic or foreign policy reveals a laughable ignorance on your part.
Can someone explain to me the push by right wing evangelical churches to brainwash their masses into thinking Biden is going to make the United States socialist? A) Biden is about as moderate a candidate as you can get. B) Luke 3:11, 1 John 3:17, Acts 2:44, etc.
I know you're a Trump bootlicker, but you can't honestly believe that he is coherent half the time. Hillary "won" all the debates against him. Didn't matter. Biden has nothing to gain.
In the US there are times things are uncomfortable for citizens. For example, if Biden is elected he is not my choice but he is still MY PRESIDENT and I will respect that. If he upholds the constitution he's valid, regardless if I agree with him on policy.
Saw it in SW Michigan. If saying things that aren’t accurate is the plan to advertise against Biden, then there’s plenty of Trump telling lies &amp; being vulgar, sexist &amp; racist to flood the airwaves, right?  He loves the camera, the microphone &amp; the sound of his own voice. 🤔
I love this analogy. There's the obvious reference, and if someone doesn't know it, they would think Biden is roping/reeling in a Dope! Works across generations

Say what you want about Joe Biden, but at least he has decency and empathy.
“We assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former vice president Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia ‘establishment.’”
No but supporting one of the most impactful black men in history and reviving numerous awards for your work in the black community is different than having a black friend. At least with Biden we can point to actual policies he’s passed that destroyed the black communities.
Right. “One” party. Joe Biden’s crime bill, FDR’s new deal. Every bill helps and hurts people disproportionately.
Why do we need to hear from Bill Clinton? I’m not grooving on this list. Ed Rendell should NOT be advising Biden. Not any of the other white men of his age and I’ll, IMO.
Biden campaign claims lagging auto jobs puts Trump at disadvantage in Michigan
Hot Take:  I don't care who the VP is. There is not a single woman Biden would choose I have a problem with.  Also, I don't care who speaks at the convention.  Nothing Biden or the DNC will do changes my vote, donations, or volunteer time in any way.  I. Do. Not. Care.
I remember the Obama years fondly. He helped the economy. Got more people's health care. Anyone that tells you 4 yrs of Biden will be any different is lying to you to scare you.
Agree so hard. We have to take this step by step - Biden is just the first.
the Biden personalized virtual outreach is actually good lowkey
Let Vance and (very soon) James do their thing. They will likely uncover stuff which a Biden DOJ won’t be able to ignore.
isn’t joe biden a gun owner uhhhhhh?
hopefully straight ticket voting can get us that district w Biden and Slotkin doing well
Kanye west might be the way to fix shit ..   Kanye west Trump Biden Pedowood Andrenochrome SaveTheChildren
What if we’re actually supposed to vote for Kanye... because think about it ... Biden is a pedophile and communist, trump is pushing dictorship and making himself look bad and kanye is expressing the beliefs we currently have towards the gov with his deleted tweets. 😶
Suddenly, because of a news anchor mistype, Obama's the real candidate. A switch from last month when supposedly Obama wasn't saying shit to help Joe Biden. Go on. Say it's Obama's 3rd term. See what that does for coward Trump, who wouldn't run against Obama when he could have.
The degree to which liberals will try to justify their nominee's racism, rampant callousness and general instability is so fucking absurd that I wonder how the Dem think-tanks ever decided Biden was the right candidate. This election cycle is a fucking disaster.
Everyone knows Biden will have to be brought on stage for grueling hours of debate, right? Does everyone really want to see that? Can liberals really admit to themselves that its something they're looking forward to? Well I mean I am bc it's gonna be a garbage fire lmao
Is senile joe Biden worse than trump?
Biden’s handlers need to get it together you’re going to BLOW IT for all of us here
Yeah they’re both bad and I resent this political system, but they’re not bad in the same way.  45’s bad endangers non-whitecishet ppl &amp; Biden’s bad will make a woman VP, put progressives in Supreme Court, protect the L+ community, dreamers, the ACA, &amp; the environment. Just sayin
i'm not crazy about rice or harris, but they're gonna do what they do regardless of who biden picks, and they're already calling him a commie, as they've been doing for almost a century now.
Biden Sucks. Vote Biden.
I know that Obama didn't pick Biden as his VP until mid to late August.  But Obama was a once-in-a-country's-history kind of dude.   Biden is Band-Aid to stop a brain hemorrhage. His VP is de facto the next presidential candidate, so I understand the caution. But get on with it.
I've been trying my best not to say anything about Biden's VP candidates, but Democrats are starting to devour themselves speculating on who's in or out, losing sight of who the opposition really is.  Dude just needs to make a pick so we can move on with the next thing.
We the 6% also see Biden brings no change just a reset to really shitty lives we had before 2016. That’s not really a prize.  Will we “get on board” come November???
Undecided are people who maybe have seen what Biden’s been up to and that the third run doesn’t wash the stink off.  I hate Biden but despise Trump so it’s a real emotional roller coaster until November.
And every news network will run with the 2 second clip of Biden saying "[W]e all make them from time-time." on repeat
Oh, I wouldn’t wait in line for 8 hours to vote Biden IN.  He’s easily the worst D candidate of my lifetime, and I’m counting Geoffrey Fieger for governor of Michigan.  But to vote Trump OUT?  I’d wait as long as it took.
Trump pretends Biden is tired and has dementia by manipulating photos of Biden PRAYING and then goes out and says Biden is "against God" and will "hurt God". Donald Trump is lucky his Christian supporters are dumb as fuck. And that's not by accident.
Ugh. Sometimes I wonder if Biden actually paid close attention to Obama, a skillful wordsmith. I don't recall Obama ever needing to clarify his words.
I don’t know. What is Trump at? Let’s use that as our baseline, and Biden will never catch up.

Trump bringing god into his political attacks on Biden is more than just rank hypocrisy, it’s yet another dangerous attack on the bedrock principles of American democracy. That alone would be enough to forever disqualify him in my book.
Based on Trump’s Axios performance, I am now thinking that his aides won’t want HIM to debate Biden!!!
In what way has Biden ever appeased the far left?  The Scientologist lady?  Ugh.  I know the far left.  I am the far left.  We are not appeased.
Biden spills beans on GM's future electric Corvette in campaign ad
Joe Biden has a non-religious leftist agenda? Of all people, seriously - of all people - Trump is calling out someone’s faith?? Can he really be that stupid — him who held the Bible upside down &amp; backwards?
Joe Biden makes a boneheaded comment about African-Americans and Trump - of all people - acts outraged? I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so hard.
Yep. In this case follow Biden’s words as there are no actions to follow.
If Warren vacates her Senate seat to become VP, the governor gets to appoint her replacement.  Massachusetts has a republican governor.  There’s zero chance in hell Biden would pick Warren and flip a Senate seat red.
Sloppy wording. Biden will kill the Hyde Amendment. It’s literally impossible to support that if you believe in a non-reincarnation afterlife.

There are so many reasons to vote for Biden over trump, but getting rid of Betsy as Secretary of education has to be at the top. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
On the other hand, it doesn't do much good for Biden to say to eliminate it. Filibuster is entirely a Senate rules thing, so Biden saying to abolish it would do nothing other than maybe lose mods/Rs and get a couple D senators to support it  Not big payoff, but big cost
Sadly all features not bugs. Can’t wait until the Biden admin makes things right again with our allies. 🙏
Given how often we see pictures of Biden in churches, quite often kneeling in prayer - that’s going to be a hard label to stick.  His pro-choice leanings are a better attack vector for Trump.
How can Biden hurt God?  Please elaborate.  If he can do that, then he is much more POWERFUL than you.
Biden doesn't grab women by the pussy, sexualize his daughter, hang out with Epstein, hold a bible upside down for a photo op, or not care about thousands of people dying. #biblicalidiot
Your foolish attempt to attack Biden about “hurting God or the bible “ is pathetic.  With your egregious history toward women, God is already hurt and holding the bible upside down and backwards proves you don’t read scripture!
Right...Joe Biden regularly attends church and owns guns
I checked, and can't believe you are over 35. Biden/Plaza 2020
We lived in fear of Obama coming to take our guns away for 8 years. Now they are saying Biden is taking our guns away? How would we be able to live without guns? Without guns we'd be just like ....like all those people in all other countries around the world!!!
If Biden was for "no religion" and if he killed God, I would love him. But the Bidens are actually Catholics who regularly attend masses. (Unlike Trump, who rarely goes to church, except for photo ops)
Biden was friends with Robert E Byrd dick Russell and Strom Thurmond nut I guess since he’s a democrat and we have trump in office we can just ignore that
God creates dinosaurs God destroys dinosaurs God creates Biden Biden destroys God  ...  Biden creates dinosaurs?
He’s not attacking Biden. He’s describing himself
Seems like I may wanna check this Biden guy out.
How weak is God that he can't stand up to someone like "Sleepy Joe" Biden, who, according to Trump, is suffering from "serious cognitive decline"?
Biden will, personally. After he takes down God.
hahahahaha ... “shreds”. Biden is a devout Catholic and Trump doesn’t know the proper orientation to hold up a bible. Please.
To be fair, he left open the possibility that God could win the fight, but not before Biden does some damage.
Biden could be Carrot Top's running mate and I'd vote for the ticket!!
Is Biden going to use executive action to take guns? Like with bump stocks?
And the obvious fact that Biden is a deeply devout Catholic and Trump doesn’t know the proper orientation for holding a bible.
Anyone who votes for either Biden or Trump is fucking stupid. There is a woman running who hasn't been caught telling blatant lies recorded on video, who can maintain her line of thought while composing grammatically correct sentences.
Except for obvious fact that Biden is a practicing Catholic and Trump doesn’t know which orientation to hold a bible.
I would wait in a 24 hour line to vote for Joe Biden.
Haha, he’s full on demented. Biden is going to magically vanish all the guns in the US with no notice 😂
Trump just said Biden is against God, but I'm pretty certain Biden is facing down Satan come November.  #HeIsReallyLosingHisMind
Of course he will. Basically Biden being an utter embarrassment is his only chance. The sad truth is that this may very well happen.
ANYWAY joe biden is a rabid dog that should
Well this time it’s only working cause people are getting sick and dying. But Biden’s poll numbers are tanking rn🤦🏾‍♂️
lrt: biden might be marginally better than trump on a few issues, but biden getting elected doesn't mean our work is done, it just means that we can actually start the work of opposing him
If their aim is to attract conservatives this would be an unwise choice. My mom is a hard conservative considering Biden but she hates Whitmer.
So what's the probability that Biden will choose a Black running mate *now*—300 zillion percent, or only 200 zillion percent?
Mixed feelings about that. God I love how hard Hillary fought and everytime she spoke it was experience, intelligence and thoughtfulness coming through. When Biden speaks, it's empathy that comes the the forefront. Both great candidates, Biden is the one we need now.
See we know joe biden and trust joe Biden. But trump ya see now you’re helping trump. You want 4 more years of trump don’t u
“ just keep running joe you don’t even have to win” - Terry McAuliffe (biden/obama bro)
Lol really goes to show how traditional politicians see communities. Aside from being low key racist, this mindset makes politicians like Biden set policy based on flimsy preconceived notions about community support for certain policies, not what’s most equitable or just.
I mean, the white folk will always like the racism.   What I want progressives to see after November is that even if it's Biden/Harris, he's just a rubber stamp for Pelosi and Schumer, so pressure/go after them. In addition to building benches for the next gen of leaders.
Like is it really the greatest idea to give Trump 3 months of ads scaring the shit out of gun owners before they vote?  There’s a huge pro-2A demographic poised to vote for Biden who’ll now pause to reconsider.  This could’ve waited.  Unless it prevents campaign contributions...?
Doesn't Kanye have more in common with Trump supporters?  I feel like he would take more votes from Trump.  Like are any Biden voters suddenly going to vote for a pro-life candidate that keeps defending Trump?

I want Joe Biden to give a speech just about Trump's crimes and what he'll do to make everyone involved in each of them get their day in court in cuffs.
I like  idea. Art of the deal. Biden agrees to debate after Trump releases his taxes.
Release your taxes and Biden will debate no taxes no debate
Biden is a pedophile
Biden is also a pedophile

No don’t see Biden accepting a debate, at any point.
Let's review:  Choices... Biden / Trump .  Everything else is gravy
1) Trump has been testing negative for covid repeatedly.  2) Biden literally refused to interview once. “All his interviews”? that’s a gross overstatement  3) transgender people aren’t mentally stable for the army. That’s why suicide rates are high in that community.
At least Biden has a strategy, unlike that orange faced orangutan you work for.
Trump was a better president that Obama and Bush. Biden helped Obama be a horrible president. I could argue and say Bush was an awful president. You could also argue that you’re “self made” and fail at that too.
Biden isn’t a real American and neither are you.
Fuck Biden  come take it Joey
May e Dr Jill Biden will do his debates for him.
Yep the bottom starting when Obama and Biden colluded with our fbi to spy on an incoming president and all the lies that ensued.  Let’s not let that happen again ever.
This click does fucking rock thank you  for bring this high quality content to my attention, I wasnt going to vote for Biden but now I see that hes my guy!
There are numerous video recordings of both Biden and Trump lying their asses off - and you think you have to SETTLE for that?
That's shortsighted. Only one candidate has a proven track record of creating a booming economy from a broken one.  And only one has a proven track record of breaking a booming one.  Biden is the only person running for president that was very involved in creating prosperity
I'm totally riden' w/Biden! But DAMN! I wish I could be drivin' THESE Biden wheelz!

Yeah except Biden literally started his campaign with an altered clip of Trump “supporting” the racists at Charlottesville. It goes both ways.

“It will go away like things go away” should be Biden’s next ad slogan against him
What a digusting piece of work Biden is.
Some Republicans who are sick of Trump but won’t vote for Biden, could vote for Kanye. If people want a change, they will not vote for Kanye. If people don’t want Trump but want to keep Republican, they could take the vote from Trump. That would drive Trump crazy to think that.
Trump is nice to Biden.
I know you have been out of touch lately.  June 26, Biden agreed to the usual three debates.   So far you’re guy has demanded four and agreed to none. So whose hiding?
But note the partisan split. As of 12:08, the (uncontested) Senate primary votes are  Dem In person: 21204 Dem Absentee: 43228  GOP In person: 9755 GOP Absentee: 5104  If it's like today, Trump will be leading the Michigan vote until 10 or 11pm, even if Biden has way more votes

Yeah a lot of southern Wayne county is heavily WWC and prob went for Bernie (although they went Biden this year)
"Donald Trump’s campaign says it knocked on over 1 million doors in the past week alone.  Joe Biden’s campaign says it knocked on zero."
I think if we do vote Biden into office, that administration will handle it better. and with a few covid vaccine candidates starting phase III clinical trials soon, I think it could be contained within a year. but contingent upon a lot obviously :/
Small problem: We need a candidate worth voting FOR. Biden is a joke.
And don't forget what didn't even make the headline: Biden has a 1 point lead in Texas.
Don't forget. Several paragraphs into the story it mentions that Biden has a 1 point lead in Texas. Yet somehow Trump leading in Alabama is the headline?!?!
Talk about burying the lede. Biden has a 1 point lead in Texas in a statistical tie. Trump leading in Alabama? Not   exactly headline worthy.
. is a lying sack of shit.  This isn’t news to me, but the Biden Bros need to reckon with this.
Not ok with her at all.  But will still vote for Biden
A couple I like more, a couple I like less. But frankly he could pick any of them and it won’t change my vote for Biden one iota.
you are unquestionably a racist moron of very small  judgement throwing fuel onto a non-existent Fire. Biden picking a black woman as a running mate “illegal”?  You’re either really dumb or a racist. Oh yeah. You are both.  You should go away.
At 4:40 - Can you believe the election is now less than 3 months away? Joe Biden leads President Trump in virtually every national poll - but didn't the same thing happen with Hillary Clinton? We'll take a look at Catholic considerations for the election with John Manos.

Yes, I'd really try to troll Biden on support for our military after you passed on confronting Putin about Russian bounties on our forces in Afghanistan.  That's sure to work...
Biden's only hope is to somehow rally the nation behind a second reconstruction.
In other words, you don’t have an argument to offer. You just attack looks and characteristics like every other Biden supporter.
This bears an uncanny resemblance to a Joe Biden rally.   Dilbert Can Answer Questons  by Scott Adams  via
Joe Biden is not the President yet. Why would he be expected to be accountable &amp; be questioned over issues like the COVID virus?? Its your dad's job to be accountable.
But it will go on.  Until he is removed from office.  On November 3rd, Americans need to vote AGAINST TRUMP, therefore FOR BIDEN.  Then, if Trump doesn't leave on Inauguration Day, the military goes in and removes him.
Even here in liberalville Ann Arbor I rarely see a Biden sign. Now that I think about it, I think I’ve seen more Trump signs which is way more odd.
i.e. you don't lose anything voting for Biden, but rather put someone in office who will at least consider the merits of progressive policies.
By mainly asking you to vote AGAINST TRUMP, and not FOR BIDEN, the Biden campaign is letting us know that a vote for Biden does not mean Biden is sanctioned to do as he did pleases, and must be held accountable and held to a higher standard than his predecessor.
Anyone saying that a vote for Biden is the same as a vote for Trump, here's a useful thread. I think Biden could be better in 101 ways but that does not mean we should allow more harm under another term of Trump.
EXCEPT. That Biden did NOT. Say he would zONLY CONSIDER BLACK WOMEN!  Biden just said he would have A WOMAN for VP pick!  Said he would pick a BLACK WOMAN for SCOTUS if he got to pick a judge,   .  GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT! (Oh, fotgot you don’t do facts)
In the last day Trump and his people have called NV passing a mail-in ballot law that's similar to long time balloting laws in other states and Joe Biden choosing only from women for VP "illegal". Then Donald Trump tweeted "LAW &amp; ORDER". Just so you know where we're headed.
Listening to Susan Rice on NPR right now. She clearly has the chops to be on the cabinet, but VP? IDK. And the fact that she has a 23 year old son who is conservative is not an actual reason to believe she can persuade Trump supporters to vote for Biden.
Sadly, this is a preview of any debate. Trump shouts and continually lies such that Swan never gets a word in edgewise and shakes his foot in frustration. Biden should NOT “debate” this man. A pissing match with a skunk only results in everyone stinking to high heaven.
...without being honest or thoughtful about the harms that he would certainly also perpetrate. I think that anger and frustration can be valid and widespread without being tied to an ultimately anti-voting-Biden platform, at least in important states.
i generally agree with this, but would also say that a tremendous majority of the left was going to vote for Biden regardless— less than actual defection, I think there’s a lot of public resentment against liberals who seem so eager to basically bully folks into voting for him...
Even Biden doesn't know who is him. He introduced himself：I am Joe Biden‘s wife Joe Biden.
I was restricted for posting this in response to a friend that posted pics of Biden sniffing women’s heads. I was warned in March for a trump meme/bleach. I think they’re working for trump.
9% margin is a lot to climb for sure   But if there was a state where Biden can overcome that (in this environment) Texas has all the ingredients
what does joe biden have to do with this disgraceful showing
why the fuck does he even agree to do these things if hes not gonna prepare one iota and just give oppo material to Biden on a silver platter?  How do you say John Lewis isnt respectable when that was a layup answer? is he special?
Is that you or Biden?
Derek Chauvin will be found innocent. The Biden riots will be...something.
Nobody is waiting on a debate between Biden and Trump to figure out who they’re going to vote for.
Trump won by 1%, it’s a suburban district, it might not be safe D but more likely than not Biden will carry even if he loses nationwide
Joe Biden has compassion and integrity!!
I know 2 people who regret their 2016 Trump vote and will vote for Biden in 2020. I certainly hope there are countless more.
But then there's no excuse for totalitarian executive orders, vote-by-mail, or Biden not having to debate Trump live!
More people will turn out to vote FOR Trump than will to vote AGAINST him. Nobody's actually voting FOR Biden. Don't kid yourself.
Republicans for Biden is like Gays for Islam.  Supporting their inevitable executioners thinking you'll get off their hit list.
Long-cons, short-cons, Russian oligarch scams, anti-racism-as-HR-right-to-work pablum, emoluments scams, bog-standard (Hunter Biden) '90s-era stuff....This really is the Age of the Grift.
Anyone who is foolish enough to vote for Biden won’t laugh-unless they are told to do so by Biden and the socialists he represents.   These people are sheep and habitual followers.  I doubt they will laugh when they are all broke and our country is in ruins either.
No comparison; trump is a sociopath and a monster; Biden is the opposite
This shit mindset didn't work in 2004 and I doubt it'll work now.  "Settle for Biden" is no way to get people to the polls.
Oh yeah same, I expect Florida to be done counting 98% of its votes by 11:30pm   And yeah, I would say those early ballots will be more heavily Dem than the past since trump started attacking VBM  Biden needs to be up early ine the state to sustain central time zone counties too
It is now time to end your videos with “Vote for Biden”!

I didn't need any convincing to get out the vote for Biden, but this is a pretty good list/thread of reasons why.
That oft-cited 52% of white women figure was based on exit polls. 47% is more accurate. It’s still shocking to me that *anyone* voted for such an obviously ignorant, racist, unqualified, corrupt fraud, and I hope we see a Biden landslide in November.
CNN: "on our next segment, we will discuss the recent clip showing Joe Biden hunting and killing poor black people for sport" every fucking twitter user: "Yeah, but Biden is still better than the orange cheetoh! vote blue no matter who, then move him left after the election!"
#dearmichigan the diff between trump and biden is like the diff between an "incompetent" and "competent" colonial governor. the problem is the position, not who's in it.
anyone: "hey it's kinda fucked up that democrats actively ignore their voters and ruin their  lives because they know  they'll get their votes anyway" a thousand randos coming out of nowhere: "LISTEN buddy you have TWO choices and if you don't vote for biden i'll k*ll you"
In the end if we progressives don’t get on legacy media to control the minds of boomers we will lose. Those who are 45+ that’s aren’t progressive can be manipulate by legacy media and that’s what helped Biden win by spread misinformation about sanders.
the biden supporters were probably staying safe at home since there’s a pandemic you fucking twat
😂🤣 China and Russia already own us coz of trump!  Jobs have come crashing down coz of trump!  The stock market will be just fine under Biden the man who helped to rebuild it before.  The only threat to our economy is trump!
Why is the climate crisis serious enough to warrant a Cabinet-level profile? There are many reasons.
I back Biden because I believe he presents our best option to fighting this back. Trump may very well undo Democracy as we know it.
Most of the time the money you have spent on a wedding is non-refundable and venues and caters and the million other people you need to pay don't always play nice with postponement
On one hand yes, on the other hand if you are like a normal young couple who has been scraping by for years saving for one of these ridiculously expensive events I understand saying fuck the pandemic and going full on with your wedding because hopefully it's the only one you get
As many have said, prior to '16 there were already a lotttt of people who already despise the Clintons, esp. Hillary, no matter what. Perhaps Biden's biggest strength is his being judged more favorably by fellow old white men.
What a joke the radial left got crushed by Biden
#DearMichigan If the broken promises from #BigGretch weren't enough to prove to you that Democrats don't care about you, remember that Trump's strategy to win is NOT hiding in his basement to avoid exposure.  Biden is a facade. #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
If there is a tie, the House will elect Biden and the Senate will elect Pence. And even after that hot mess, the two parties still wouldn't reform our dysfunctional election system. It would be a glorious shit show.
Joe Biden could still easily lose this election. Don’t get bored.
Debates between Biden and Trump are unnecessary and serve no purpose other than to provide journalists with quip fodder for debate stories and TV ratings.
Fixed the headline:  Oil donors trade money for a habitable earth as Biden adopts climate stance that, most likely, is still far too weak to save planet
"Delay"  Is there a law or rule Biden was supoosed to pick his person 2-3 weeks before most previous people picked their VPs?  With this and a few otber shit-stirring "stories", treading dangerously into NYT politics garbage.
Michigan will be won by Biden and we will keep the 2018 congressional seats we won plus Peters will be re-elected to the senate
This is why I'm in a mindset to vote for Biden even if he shoots someone on 5th ave.  There's nothing they can say that will make me vote for someone else.
Biden is not proposing socialism but I’d take socialism every day in preference to fascism and I’d prefer a President who didn’t lie about everything continuously
Additionally, what this "thinking" forgets is that the right to choose is the LAW OF THE LAND &amp; supported by overwhelming majority! Biden is supporting the LAW!! Same as he supports  other LAWS!!  THE PRESIDENT CAN'T CHANGE IT!!! What's it going 2 take 4 people 2 get it?
If retired 4 star republican general and former Secretary of State under George Bush, Colin Powell AND former communist black panther, abolitionist, speaker, author, and professor Angela Davis are voting for Joe Biden and you’re not what do you know that they don’t?

I like them both. I’m voting Biden and would vote for him no matter who he chooses for VP.

The only person Biden could pick for VP that would make me end up voting for Trump (at least indirectly) is Trump.

This will be offset by the number of teachers who will vote for Biden. (PS: I’m the teacher who will vote for Trump.)
Biden's VP must be ready to become president, to play nuclear deterrence, play chess and sometimes stand stubbornly on principle,  won't get tangled won't shirk responsibility, ready to jab.  tough smart good at scowling when a cold scowl is what is really needed
Really... The best thing you've got on Biden is that he's never been arrested?  #BlueWave2020
Maybe you’ll have to pay some taxes when Biden is our president. Ah, so sad. FU
Please run with Biden, we NEED you, now!!!!!!
That’s an odd way of saying my dad fucked everything up but things will get better when Biden takes over.
Now do Joe Biden.
Biden wouldn't do it, but the most "own the cons" move by Biden and Evers would be Karofsky to 7th, and Evers appoints Neubauer to finish Karofskys term
I’ll be happy with whomever Biden picks for VP. Every one of the candidates is strong, smart, qualified. Of course I have a favorite, but I’ll be thrilled with Any. One. Of. Them. Let’s do this.
Given Biden's age who the VP is matters very much
Trump had no spell on Michigan. The options last time were not good. The Libertarians took votes away from the mainstream candidates and tipped the scales. If Biden had been there instead of HRC he would have won in a landslide.
Lol of course the Biden delegate supports the candidate using racist filters on his mailers.
Then vote Biden
Perhaps if Biden wins, more radical change is in the cards. But while that's being worked out, day 1 should see a restoration of the oversight mechanisms the Trump folks have dismantled.
Biden, empathy......oil and water. Get it?
Begala speaks of Biden's empathy. WTF? He has empathy? Did U.S. Presidential Candidate Joe Biden Say He Had ‘No Empathy’ for the Plight of Younger People?   Fuck no! He has no empathy.
Yes and as a Dem, I want to say that Biden - if elected - had better not give a free pass to all the criminals who contributed to the sh**tshow he inherits. That was Obama’s mistake (much as I appreciate him).
Please explain why trump is involved with this. Will Biden get to ban Fox news?
It’s basically been Clinton, Hillary and Biden’s “platform”
Biden fucking sucks
We all knew this lmao Trump has a silent army of support they just don’t respond to pollster calls, emails, or texts lmao. Only way biden has a chance is if more people die get sick or the economy continues to tank. If things clear up trump wins easily

Biden will change this. You are the one who gave the billionaires such a tax break that made them all this $$$
Biden will tax the billionaires that you gave a huge tax break to. He'll help the average working people, just like what happened under the Obama/Biden administration.  You sure di love to spread lies

Dude. Bush crashed the economy and Obama/Biden saved it. Now you’ve crashed the economy and Biden will fix it.  I hope people have figured out that it’s the Republicans who turn things to utter shit. Time to get out the brooms.
If by alter you mean improve, than you are correct Joe Biden!
He is a 'public servant' now (and I use that term reluctantly) - other public servants provide tax returns... like Mr. Biden!
Things the press needs to assume will happen and refuse to enable:  1. William Barr DOJ's unleashing some sort of October smear on Biden 2. Foreign misinformation flooding into the election to undermine our election 3. Trump refusing to accept the election results
A cabinet position in the Biden administration would be appropriate also.
...Ms. Duckworth handed him a parting gift — a Smirnoff Ice, the centerpiece of a viral drinking game known as “icing” — and gave a final senatorial directive:  “Get down on one knee and chug.”  Nothing but respect for my Senator. 🤝👏🤝👏
Fortunately, the Biden that’s running is the real one, not the boogeyman that you keep projecting.
I feel bad for Biden.  He has so many awesome potential running mates.  How lucky are we!  But tough going for Joe. I like these kind of problems.  Don’t you?

Beth just convinced me to vote Biden. Thread is on my profile.  That's why I stay left - because we create real conversations instead of propaganda.  All the "resist" folks who lionize anti-Trump right wing like Rick Wilson, Lincoln Project, even GW Bush &amp; John Bolton? Wrong Way!
I have mornings like that, too. Your thread inspired me this morning and I am keeping my head up.  Biden can slow Trump's damage - but these 4 years have made it *absolutely necessary* for a constitutional amendment.  Please consider 21st Century Bill of Rights!
Very Important Thread. Beth gets real!  Berners can help get Biden elected. But don't stop there!  We, The Left, *must* get Dems to help us amend the constitution with a 21st Century Bill of Rights.  Follow  and DM if you want to help re-launch the project in 2021

Trump mocks Biden but he doesn't know where states are or their capitals. Pronunciations are a consistent problem for words he probably he has rarely used. Regular dope.

I would’ve said that he won’t appoint conservative judges— until the DNC decided to host John Kasich, so who knows 🤦😂  Although imo the one thing Biden has going for him is a $2T climate plan- it’s no Green New Deal, but it’s better than Trump selling parks to big oil
If you’re uncomfortable with Trump and Biden (and leaning towards Biden), Kanye is a great third choice!

The Hill joins NBC in reporting that  is still under consideration to be  VP.  “They’re very similar. He can relate to her. It shouldn’t be surprising to anyone that she’s still very much in the mix.” #2020Election #Veepstakes
She promises to deliver MI-13 to Joe Biden in November. Okay, but since Hillary Clinton took 79% of the vote from that district in 2016, that’s like me promising to deliver up something called heat from the Sun.
Not hard to see why Whitmer remains popular. Her message is simple and consistent: making hard decisions to keep us safe. Republican attacks on her this week were something about a Zoom press conference, something about Biden defunding police, oh and btw she’s a dictator
Joe Biden has a long history of racist comments and legislative actions towards African Americans. It's who he is. It's what democrats have always been. Don't let them pander their way to your vote.

Trump has been practicing in front a mirror to much.   Trump accuses Biden in Rant: He’ll ‘Hurt the Bible, Hurt God. He’s Against God.’   "When Donald J Trump's mouth is open and his lips are moving then he's lying"
Not me: people don't like her. I recognize that racism &amp; sexism played a role in her exit from the Pres. race, but it was also clear that she had no appeal to most. Extremely capable; comes across as cold and pretentious. Biden needs a warm woman, like Stacy Abrams.

"Democrats with knowledge of the process tell NBC News Whitmer did not just re-emerge as a potential vice presidential pick, but had long remained in the top tier for the only person with a vote in the process: Biden himself." #2020Election #veepstakes
I think it’s even stranger considering Biden is a practicing Catholic and Trump has yet to attend any regular services.
This being said, nothing is going to change my mind about voting for Biden, so maybe this sort of position factors into their decision making process.
Can the Biden campaign really be this tone-deaf? I'm in Michigan and think Gov. Whitmer is great, but they have really let the expectation of a WOC grow. Again, I love Whitmer, but I'd be disappointed because I have preferences among the WOC who are rumored to be in the running.
we should maybe check into this Biden character.. I mean, I don't like the idea of him getting a holy deity into the figure four or coming off the top rope with a clothesline.. ya know?  I can't get behind that.
Yesterday the Trump adminstration literally photoshopped Biden praying at Church to look like he was mentally and physically exhausted.  The only 2 tactics Trump has against Biden is to try and make others think he's against God and has dementia ("Sleepy" Biden). That's legit it.
(Biden will) "take away your guns, destroy your 2nd Amendment, no religion, no anything, hurt the bible, hurt God, he's against God, he's against guns"..  😂  no anything?!?!   I was fine up until "no anything".

Joe Biden: A sleepy, practicing Catholic threat to God Almighty
His “team”? U mean his corrupt offspring? If that wasn’t the first sign this presidency was a joke idk what was. And that’s great on the follow. But when Biden mops the floor with trump, that’s when the country will really be able to heal and stop being a joke on the world stage.
The problem is I can't believe a word that comes out of your mouth. The PAC ad against Biden has totally backfired on you. You have to go back to 1987 to find a Joe Biden lie. With you it's a daily occurrence. #NeverAgainTrumper #TillersonWasRight
And FYI, trump inherited a rising economy from Obama/Biden. He did nothing to earn that himself. Just like he enherited his fortune from his father. And much like he bankrupted most of his business ventures he’s bankrupting the country. He’s a perfect circle of failure.
Chatfield said  “refuses” to say he doesn’t support defunding police, but Biden did just that at a virtual fundraiser last night.
More Sleezy false campaign ads from Trump.  Trump Campaign Busted For Deceptively Manipulating Biden Photos In New Ad   This will get worse as November approaches
No one’s voting for Biden because they’re upset. 1) it’s hilarious u think Biden has dementia but trump has no mental decomposition. 2) even if trump isn’t mentally compromised by a disease, his lack of intelligence, empathy, and compassion are the reasons I won’t vote for him.
Chatfield: "The more Joe Biden focuses on defunding the police and raising taxes, it'll hurt him here in Michigan. We're a blue-collar state."   "Michigan is very much in play and I think Michigan will go Donald Trump's way," he adds.   #Election2020
Chatfield calls Biden "an empty vessel" and says Michigan will deliver a win for President Trump in November.   #Election2020
Schuette, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2018, says race between Trump and Biden in Michigan might be a photo finish and brutally close.
Hey so like, are we even going to have a (virtual) single old man debate between Trump and Biden? Or are both their brains too rotton and both parties know it? #Biden2020 #Trump2020
You're defending someone who is actively trying to get Trump reelected. Someone who defends Trump's racism by saying he's only that way because of Obama, Biden, and Pelosi. Someone who consistently uses tropes to defend his political lean. Perhaps you should read his feed.
Way better than trump.  Have you heard trump speak?  I'm no biden fan, but he is way better than trump in almost every way.
Any day now, Joe Biden will realize he’s running for President
Government is so beyond broken.   Amazing solutions here:    #Election2020 #Biden #Trump whoever it is, won't make that much difference. It can't.
A Hitler reference. How original. Why don't you get on here and tell everyone why they should vote for Biden. You can't, because he's a lousy candidate and this is the best you've got.
GOP thinks Kanye's race will draw votes away from BIDEN supporters
🔴   Trump Campaign: Americans Deserve To See Trump &amp; Biden Debate    🇺🇸    Requested a NEW Debate Sep 1  🗳️   Sep 4 - 1ST Ballots Sent Out in NC  🗳️   Sep 29 - 1ST Debate  😯   Millions Will Have Already Voted Before the 1ST Debate    VOTE Trump 2020  🇺🇸
Joe Biden can't spell cognitive
Thousands of Trump signs everywhere in Michigan, and small amounts of Biden signs. The incredible thing is all the yards with local Democrats, and Trump signs. Never seen anything like it since Ronald Reagan.
My question is to all the Democrats out there, if it's proven that this whole thing with Russia was a hoax perpetrated by the Democrat party members such as Obama, Biden  etc. Will you all still support the democrats in 2020? If you do, you are the problem.
Watch the magic on November 3rd, its going to make 2016 look like a joke. The Democrats have made themselves look so stupid to their base. Stop watching the polls, he's just getting started. Imagine if he debates Libertarian Jorgensen, Because Basement Biden bails on the debates?
Any VP under Biden will be the "alpha" within a year. We all see this in Biden.
Idk how much I trust the road if Biden is on it
Bernie is not going to be the President. Ever. Either Trump or Biden are going to be President. One of them is actively undoing every gain we have made. The other is not Captain Planet, but he believes in science, and is willing to put money into Green businesses and solutions.
I KNOW that Trump isn't going to do anything for the environment except more harm. Biden may not have perfect environmental policy, but no one running for President right now does. The best candidate for the environment dropped out early. Also, elections aren't beauty pageants.
two American icons here. Joe Biden... and from the great city of Flint, Michigan, a mid-late 60's model Chevrolet Corvette.   #RidinWithBiden #JoeBiden
I've bothered the hell out of Obama-Biden and Stabenow since 2008 over Made in the USA!  Now that Obama and Biden are Wealthy beyond common sense belief, Joe Biden has the former Balls to Air TV Commercials pushing Made in the USA? This 1's 4 U Joe: BS💩!
Since bumbling Biden will hand the whole Administration over to the far-left Socialists you will be much more depressed when all of your property is seized when your taxes go up to 90% And when you have no voice in government any longer
Will #LincolnVoters actually be able to pull the lever on Biden when it comes time to vote? It's easy say yes on August 5, but a much more difficult task in November.
Hey, Jonathan, will the press please point out that Biden has always had a stutter, always.
“Why the hell will I take a test?!“ “If he can’t figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion...!” I LOVE JOE BIDEN! America, you better be ready for some cussing when Biden &amp; Trump debate because I WANT Joe to cuss-out this buffoon! It’s a long time coming!
.  will not be traveling to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination. Instead, he will accept the nomination in Delaware.
Joe Biden needs to retire and play shuffle ball-this is embarrassing
Reference to Biden?
Will you be able to give us Proof of Life for Joe Biden during the DNC Convention, Peter? 😳
Could the hold on Biden's VP pick be to Shorten Vetting by the Lawful? 🙄
Which of you wasn't Confident that Barack Obama would choose Biden's VP and it would be Michelle Obama?
Thank you  for explaining to  why #JoeBiden will accept the Dem nomination from his home! It’s called using wisdom! We’d rather have a healthy Biden when it’s time to take over from the criminal in the WH! It doesn’t damage his campaign!
Is Joe Biden just not going to travel or do anything?
Is this a joe Biden quote?
You don't think Haiti will mind paying for Biden's TV Commercials do you? 🇺🇸⚖🇺🇸
I say get Libertarian  to Debate  in place of  . Have Jo Jorgensen appeal to the Democrats as Joe Biden wants to hide in his basement.  I would do all the Debates this way. Even bring in the green party for  supporters.
Are the Biden's in some sort of trouble Mr Mitchell?
Biden is acting really weird in this video.
And all the white liberal supremacist that jumping all over Donald Trump jr. For pointing out the obvious that they're white liberal old demented man Joe Biden is NOT capable of being the president of the United States
He Predicted Trump’s Win in 2016. Now He’s Ready to Call 2020.    Biden 2020! #ThisWeekinPolitics #Biden2020

The GOP is pushing Kanye to steal the election. BY DOOPING YOU LIBERAL ASSHOLES WHO KEEP WHINGING ABOUT BIDEN. And honestly, some of y'all probably naive enough to actually vote for Kanye over Biden.
No way in bloody hell I will vote for Biden have you lost your damn mind
Because they think Kanye supporters detract from Biden and not Trump? Says a lot about them I guess....
The funniest thing, about this election if you can call it funny, is that before the covid quarantining and mass hysteria going on, the presidential election looked like it would be a toss up if it was Biden/Trump.
Trump will mop the floor with Biden and Biden won't last 30 minutes before he walks off the stage against Trump..
It’s so dumb, I don’t have the energy to find it. Biden in 87 arguing with someone about intelligence.
If Mr. Biden still has a brain - a very debatable subject at this point - it would likely have to become  a distinguished veteran and mother.

Who do you think Joe Biden will choose as his running mate?
If that’s the case has he said this?  At least Biden hs talked about his stutter/disfluency.   For some reason I feel like tRump wouldn’t admit that.
Tell the honest truth  You are so right! The media has the bar so low on this racist, criminal President that if he just shows up for a debate against Biden they’d find a way to say he won it! Double standards!
This is why the debates concern me. Rather than acknowledge facts, 45 just resorts to talking over the reporter. It's going to be the same with Biden and the moderators at the debates. And that is concerning. How can you debate someone who doesn't acknowledge basic facts?
if this were Joe Biden, the mainstream media would have a psychiatrist on every one of their mind-numbing chat shows tonight analyzing if he should be committed to a facility.  But because it's Trump, they're like, "meh..".  Disgusting.
Don't people believe that Barack Obama will be choosing Biden's VP?  Why do YOU think Obama Officially Endorsed Joe Biden, because he still has a fully operating Brain? 🤔🤔
If some people, like you, want to play the game of "hey you conservatives, defund doesn't literally mean......." then you  don't get to play the game of "well Biden didn't literally say defund the police".
How can we expect Biden to stand face to face with world leaders and fight for America when we won’t even stand face to face with Trump and fight for himself?  Joe Biden is a coward
If Joe Biden knows how to fix the Country why didn't he do it the last 40+ years? Better yet why the hell didn't he tell Obama? #JoeBiden #JoeBidenIsARacist #JoeBidenIsAPedo #JoeBidenHasDementia #Trump2020Landslide #VoteRedToSaveAmerica #VoteRedMichigan
At least Joe Biden tried to save Osama Bin Laden's Life, so there Governor!  Wait a minute, Oops, MY Bad! 🙄🇺🇸⚖🇺🇸
I didn’t want Joe or Bernie because they were old white guys, I really wanted, Harris or Cory Booker but I’m still voting for Joe Biden and whoever he picks for the vice president! Sorry that she thinks Donald Trump is a better bet. 😢
Biden voters don't understand that for black people, voting for Biden is like if one season of TWD they decided to take Negan out of the cage and had him work alongside Michonne despite all he did to everybody, especially her
Anyone who says “but Biden isn’t all there” just slap yourself. Then pause and slap yourself again.
Thousands and thousands?? Must have missed those crowds..... maybe a couple hundred in Florida.... and why would u see Biden supporters ANYWHERE close to you?
Michigander voting for Biden - can’t wait for November 3rd!
except if you insinuate that Joe Biden is Not Good, then you’re a heretic who must be excommunicated from the Church of the Democrats
Ok look you fake ass Caravaggio: I'm not saying there are no accusers. unlike Biden, I haven't heard any actual names of people accusing him. So I have a blind spot. YOURE the one threatening to beat up a woman who just talks shit and has no systematic power. YOU aren't well
I'll walk through hell fire with gasoline drawers to vote for Biden.
And how is it that BIDEN is even allowed to run for President?!
😡   Hiden Biden WILL Destroy the USA   👿   He &amp; His Communist Allies Will:  👹   Raise Taxes  👹   Lead War on Police  👹   Give FREE Health Care &amp; College to Illegal Immigrants  👹   Destroy USA Energy Independence  👹   Break Up Suburbs, Add Sec 8
I hope the  team is planning how to showcase a "debate" on a stage minus Joe Biden (since they're scared)  🤔An A.I. Joe? 🤔Set a dummy Joe up on stage? 🤔Just play clips of Joe then have Trump reply?  Work on it team Trump. It could be epic!! 🇺🇸👍🏽 #DebateChicken
Joe Biden notwithstanding, this is the case. M4A.
As a Michigander, yes, we need to get the fascist out.  But I’m not going to fake enthusiasm for Biden.  This rah rah blue stuff is delusional, we do not want to go back to what was...a classist, racist, screw working and poor people society.  Vote progressive!! #DearMichigan
There's one less Fraudulent Vote for Biden.
Why would their be Biden supporters at your rallies you doofus
like ah yes, $15 minimum wage, climate change action seeking, student loan debt forgiveness, immigration reform democrat joe biden is basically the same as build a wall fascist orange golf man
i hate the two party system but in the same vein if u try to say that biden and trump are at all similar than you haven't read any of Biden's policy proposals/goals and I will not take you seriously
Joe Biden is waiting for Barack Obama to TELL him who is VP Choice is. You didn't know?  🤫🤫
Jr.  Are you sitting down? What they're saying is that your dad has done such an atrocious job in handling the virus, protesting, etc that there's really no upside in Biden debating him. If an opponent is willing to lie repeatedly why debate them?
Spent some time north with family yesterday. Caveats about anecdotes apply &amp; yet - older folks who get news from talk radio were pro-Whitmer and wary of COVID. Younger folks who get news from Facebook thought COVID deaths were faked and Joe Biden is a pedophile. We’ve got issues!
Joe Biden is their Puppet, Don. 🙄
Hang on China because Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and Dementia Joe Biden have your back!  Sad for the USA 🤨🇺🇸⚖🇺🇸
If I am Joe Biden, my pick is Sen. Duckworth. She does a lot for the ticket. Probably wouldn't be a bad President either. Wants to increase military spending. Pro gun control surprisingly. Disagrees with parental notification on abortion which may place a serious burden on
If you look at most of the democrats like joe biden, you would think that no change is possible so we might as well just do nothing and go back to the way it was before trump.  It was crappy before trump, btw.
The Fake News isn't PART of the Conspiracy to Overthrow YOU any more, Mr President, they're on Top!  These Felonious Slanderers are on some very thin Ice, handling Biden and his Leaders.  Stole the 2018 with their Lies!  Hang on Lawful Patriots!!!  🇺🇸⚖🇺🇸
Faster Biden dispatches the old guard the better.  Biden doesn't need a ”white guy whisperer.”  That's the appeal of Biden.
Makes me so angry! Especially these people who don’t like Trump or Biden. There is only one choice!
everyone who’s saying he’s part of the problem... you are the problem lol third party will not win it’s biden or trump, one is bad but the other is worse and it’s not even close
Another good reason to vote for Biden.
Biden, today is August 2 2020. August is in the summertime so it’s warm outside! I’m just trying to help you remember stuff. Remember breakfast, then lunch, then dinner.
Clinton and Biden have something to watch againMaybe Joe Biden should pick who he’d want to be his Vice President and tell everyone who disagrees to fuck off

Trump claims Biden 'insulted the Black community' with remarks on Hispanic diversity  via   remind me again how many black people did Joe Biden try to stop from renting or buying properties in his building?
Trump claims Biden 'insulted the Black community' with remarks on Hispanic diversity  via   Trump should be called Mr. President Racist pig!
Really????? You mean to say that the  ONLY difference between Trump and Biden that matters to you is who Biden picks as his VP?  Sheesh.
Posted an anti-Trump thought tonight. Had someone "enlighten" me that Joe Biden is being controlled by Satanists and pedophiles who want to undo Trump's help for Christians.   I respectfully disagreed. I was then told I was "beguiled by the devil."   So, how was your day?
Unless you’re part of the ruling class, the American government doesn’t care about you.  Joe Biden isn’t going to change this. Donald Trump isn’t going to change this. American electoralism as it stands isn’t going to change this.
I tend to agree for the most part, but I don't care that Biden is "old" so long as he is a democrat he has my vote and any other "D" I can vote for.  We have to get Trump and as many Republicans out in order to undo this nightmare.
People are irate because it shouldn’t matter who Biden picks as VP. A decent person can look at the two choices that we have - Trump or Biden - and choose Biden without hesitation, no matter what. Because Trump is NEVER an acceptable choice.
Only this sweaty orange man can stop Biden from hurting God.
Your in denial of reality. Biden's on a sinking ship , the Titanic.
Biden had one job until the election: stay inside and shut up
Oh thank goodness! Thanks, Pastor Dave for setting my mind at ease. I will sleep soundly tonight for sure. I sure hope Biden doesn't get elected, because poor god will be defenseless if we don't have guns to protect him with. #sarcasm
Our God is a puny god who can be hurt by Biden....is that how that song goes.
Biden is either very powerful or God is a puny god.
If Biden can hurt God, than God is weak or Biden is poweful like Yoda or Gandalf.
Sadly, I wasn't following  so I wasn't able to unfollow her for saying such a selfish, stupid, and soul-killing thing.  I'm with you.  Biden can choose my not-housebroken dog for VP and he's still got my vote.
"Uhh... did Joe Biden just say that Black people are all the same". No, he said there were "notable exceptions".
She actually made a very good point. If Biden picks Harris then he will not lose any progressive voters but if he picks Rice he may loses some conservative voters.
He’s campaigning in Cleveland. Implicating Biden in his falsehoods. And can’t even correctly pronounce Thailand. Thigh land!!
Trump is obviously referring to Biden's training with Hattori Hanzo.
I don't know about the God thing... but Biden sure does want to take away some guns, and has made a big push for the green new deal... which would put 10's of thousands out of a job.  you know that though, but your job makes you a professional liar.
Don’t vote Biden plz
I know none of us want trump, but we can acknowledge that Biden is racist as hell too right?
Biden has Dementia. It's sad.
The idea that any of the corporate media calls account to power is a joke. Other than a few exceptions, most media scares people and only gives them a very small ideas to choose from. Why are they completely ignoring Jo Jorgensen? There are so many people sick of Trump and Biden.
The findings should be made public &amp; criminal referrals made where appropriate. Joe Biden needs to ensure the public that he pledges to restore ethical norms &amp; rule of law. While assuring the public that consequences not compassion will be sought for any &amp; all breaches... 11/25
have occured. The more that events like Iran Contra, CIA torture, Keating Five, Tom DeLay, Jack Abrahamoff. Clinton Affair, email scandal are tolerated the easier it becomes to obliterate norms, ethics &amp; law. It is necessary &amp; imperative that if elected Joe Biden's admin... 9/25
Biden’s home
I remember him doing that to Rudy, "Okay, Noun, verb, 9/11."  Methinks Biden saw something none of us knew until much later.
My only problem with this statement is that Biden is going to decimate Trump. I cannot imagine that any single VP option on Biden's list won't do the same to Pence.
jk vote for biden, but i love you gretch
Joe Biden is perfectly capable &amp; trustworthy with the Nuclear Football.
Biden cares about Hunter more than American people!

Isn’t she the lady who said men Need to step up and take responsibility All women should be believed During the  Brett Kavanaugh Rape allegations But when it comes to Joe Biden Accuser She also said that she doesn’t believe Joe Biden’s accuser she believes in Joe Biden
Love it.  Contribute to help Biden buy even more ads.
Yeah I get that Biden is a little off. But I like him better than Trump...plain and simple.
Why do they push “Kanye” agenda? He actually make people vote for Biden
Happy Birthday Barack, We miss you would you consider Vice President to Biden
NO! I wish people would quit even suggesting it! Trump is no longer an unknown he has a political record and Biden is smarter. Debate and switch.  Go Biden
Although I believe Biden will need at least the $377 to sanitize the West Wing of all bugs and listening devices when he wins, you  have got to be kidding with the rest of the pork you added to the House Bill.
Biden should be in jail for black mailing Ukraine over the firing of prosecutor in exchange for of release of funding then later on camera Biden is caught bragging about how he held up the funding until they fired the prosecutor.
I’m gonna miss not having debates with an audience cause I was hoping Biden would invite all of the women Trump sexually abused to sit in the audience like that ba$tard did with The Clinton’s. The difference being it didn’t rattle Hillary it would totally shut Trump down.

If Biden decides to debate trump. Biden should bring all the girls and women he attacked and called them names.
My neighborhood in MIchigan has 13 Biden signs, 11 BLM and 2 Trump.  We’re surrounded but still fighting.
B all day long. Racism and nationalism is not American. Biden kneeled in front of peaceful protestors to say " I hear you, I care". Your dad threw pepper spray at them. I want a leader that leads in decency, not scream hate.
Good. In MI the Biden campaign has added to their ad buys which is the best strategy. I just have deep concerns with  strategy based on past elections. They've a history of premature victory laps &amp; belief that good will win out without encouragement.
of time &amp; resource they're ignoring current problems the people are facing. Lastly they will claim we dont dont go after political enemies in a democracy. The messaging to mute that noise is simply pointing out the Biden admin wouldn't be doing if the members of the GOP had... 6/
next monster could be. They need to proactively destroy the  clearly predictable feigned outrage &amp; attacks claiming Biden is out for revenge not justice. They'll throw fits saying it's wasting taxpayer money going after people no longer in power. Crying it's a waste... 5/
message we're pandering not sincere. I also want a clear message by Biden's campaign to say his administration will pursue the investigations, criminal charges &amp; oversight that were blocked by the corrupt Trump admin &amp; his enablers in Congress. In that messaging it is 100%... 3/
taxes will go up to 70 % if Biden is elected
big surprise no !!!!! USA will become more like socialist South America if Biden  is elected
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
Lol mandates end Nov. 5th conveniently 😂😂 all Biden supporters don’t care because they think it helps their votes.
Don't they have some new slogan about "vote for Joe Biden anyway" or something like that?  This is going to be a shitshow.
A Biden victory in November followed by a “War on Christmas™️” in December? Pass the egg nog!
He deserves that fate. The Biden admin must break w the "sin eating" &amp; forgiveness tradition. The 45 admin prevented oversight so their scandals, criminality &amp; corruption needs to be held accountable including prosecutions as a result. Nixon not facing consequences led to 45.
Joe Biden would be accused of child abuse if he had to talk to the mental incapacitated president. Biden would use big words that the man child would not understand. The the Republican Party can cry fowl for using big words
Biden withheld money from Ukraine lmao. Some people just use whatever they hear against Trump even if it's not against him lol
Warren is Great But too far to the left (which is fine with me) But Biden cannot afford the socialist and communistic ads that would follow with her False advertisements with only part of things she's said in public America will be like Cuba or China and Russia for instance
Vote for Joe Biden and turn all states blue
It's life or death for this country and the world. If Biden gets in, he will be immediately removed because he's incompetent and Pelosi will figure out how to take over. Then communism isn't far behind.
It's funny. I talk to the people I know who voted for Bernie. They won't vote for Biden at ALL. I'm like, "You know that's a vote for Trump right?" They go off on me.  But I get shit because I am voting for Biden. I'm not progressive, or smart enough, or helping people... WTF.
I will tell you where Joe Biden is on this, he’s part of the problem and his silence condones the behavior.
Get back to me when Trump is leading by 6+ points statewide in MN. Then we can talk about 70-30 in NW MN. Right now though, Biden's outperforming Clinton by quite a bit in the state, and there's no reason to think MN07 would be an exception. Trump will win it, but not by 40.
Biden in his current mental state, may nominate Minnie Mouse for VP.
Friend or Foe?1! Monday Night Raw: Ghislaine Maxwell and Chrissy Teigen facing up against Eric Trump and Hunter Biden
Trump's not going to win MN07 by 40 lol. Not while a poll shows him down 7 in MN01 and not while Biden is winning by near or over 10 points statewide
10 (NO doubt!) - if it's a fair election...  (But I'm not sure what ways the socialist-democrats are planning on stealing the election... They're not going to win legitimately with Biden).
Yes, make America Great Again by voting for Biden.
I would never donate to joe Biden’s campaign. He will never earn my vote. He is by no way qualified to run our country. President Trump is doing a fabulous job. Donald Trump rules. I can’t even imagine Joe Biden attending a closed board meeting surrounded by world leaders.
It will restore our democracy. The Republican Party has attempted to overthrow our democracy for years. President Biden will procecute all who allowed tRump to run a corruption of our laws. This includes pompeo and his ilk.
Are you kidding. Vote for trump if you don't like Biden.Biden will bring this country back to civility. Trump has done wrong by every race except for his base the white supremacists
You need to give it a rest. He was investigated and they found nothing wrong. Your just upset your losing to Joe Biden. He will be our next President
not endorsing Biden is an endorsement for Trump. She will not be getting my vote.
Biden wants to raise my taxes and have us pay more at the pump and destroy manufacturing jobs. Raise the crime rate and flood the country with foreign immigrants. I.E. Cheap labor. Why would anyone vote for him?
Tag yourself, im appropriating gay culture to promote fucking Kamalla Harris of all people. Yall got bullied and i won't vote for biden either. Slurp my knob, cornholeio
That means Biden will be president, not you. I’ll take my chances.
That’s really funny you say that, since Obama was the president, Joe Biden was the Vice President and Hillary Clinton won the popular vote when she ran against trump. Idiot
He going to develop Joe Biden CRS Syndrome (Can't Remember Shit) in 3...2...1... 🤣
All these advertisements 30 between Joe Biden and Trump is doing do they really think people believe that the real you guys to blame Trump for anything but intern old man it should be in an old folks home Trump Elise has some balls
I have no comment on that, and if we are using an allegation as a reason to not focus on the wars. What about Tara Reade against Biden. I have no interest in playing politics. There are tons of things I disagree with Tucker on, but at least he talks about the wars.
Excellent point.  He is sick.  Needs help.  And his trashing Biden is getting tiring.
Yea except most of that Biden is exuding and way more older than Donald 😊
Chef Blaser....if you need to blame Trump for this so you can sleep better at night, then that's your issue.  But to blame one person for every Covid death in the country is nothing short of foolish.  Biden or anyone else wouldn't have done any better either.
I guess it’s time for the polls to flip Trumps turn to fundraise then the polls will flip back and Biden can make $$$
Quel Surprise.  Trump distorts????  AP FACT CHECK: Trump distorts Biden's position on fracking
No corruption to report about Biden.
let’s just get it straight, i’m mexican, i will always respect the flag, if you kneel during the national anthem you’re disrespectful. black lives matter and so does everyone’s lives but the blm “movement” has become a joke. biden is retarded asf, last of all. kanye 2020
Hey. Don't be supporting dopey Joe Biden. You seem not to realize that the majority of your followers are Trump supporters.
Are you serious? I know #covid19 is contagious but I guess so is the Trump family stupidity. 100% of parents want there kids in school just not at all costs. 2nd so Joe Biden's opinion should not influence parents but your opinion should? That's spectacular ignorance &amp; hypocrisy.
It doesn't matter constitutionally. His current term ends on January 20th. In contesting the election, he risks that a timely decision will not be made. That puts him out on Jan.20. Not Biden or Trump, it will be #PresidentPelosi
I talked to a customer today, and they were hardcore Biden fans. They were talking trash about the wall being built. I told them that the wall protects a lot of children being human trafficked. They told me so what?! That’s not the worst problem our country faced.. it’s trump 😂
And  I am hoping Biden &amp; Harris will be in :-) ♥
I think you need to #1 take a look around, YOU ARE NOT DOING YOUR JOB. You can't assess anyone else, you cannot even do YOUR JOB! You cannot even manage a crisis SO BIDEN has to do it for you!
You bet, "make American great again" because it was great until you got in the White House, now we have a mess and Biden WILL make it GREAT ♥
As the Biden Campaign launches “Moms For Biden” tonight it’s important to remember his radical agenda:  ➡️ Higher taxes ➡️ Defunding the police ➡️ Government takeover of healthcare  ➡️ Job-killing Green New Deal  Biden’s destructive policies are completely out of touch with moms!

Yeah. How out of touch is Biden now GOP? Biden was right!!!
No need to worry sweetie, it won't be a close election. 3% means nothing when Biden is getting 90% of the votes.
He’s shook. That’s why he’s talking about mail in voting. They know that’s Biden’s only chance of winning.
That’s some funny shit... vote for Biden. Dying! 😂😂😂😂😂
Biden, without a doubt.
hey Biden, operation warp speed, sounds like a plan. This contradicts your assertion that there is no plan to distribute the vaccine when it is available. ( 7/29/20 speech )
Funny how the truth can be revealed inadvertently.
Same, and team Biden is for some reason texting me asking why I won’t vote Joe. I have no problem having a grown up discussion about policy or lack there of but don’t voter shame us and tell us to fall in line, that will not work.
#LincolnProject  I agree w John that  ads arent buying influence w Biden. In part because ideologically the minds behind the group &amp; Biden arent vastly different. Second they have a real stake in this... 1/
BIDEN WILL BE HAPPY THERE
Biden is Discusting!👿
BIDEN AND CHINA ARE BUTT BUDDIES
Yeah he’s an idiot, we know. However pushing Biden on your viewers really doesn’t seem right and shaming for deciding to not to vote Biden is also down right wrong in addition to being highly non productive.
The only way Biden and the Communist Democrats are going to win is if they cheat YUGELY!  This has to be prevented!
Biden will have donkeys pulling cars by next year if he is elect our good union friends will help him get elected and will put the auto companies out of work
Except Biden when he writes it on his little notepad. 😆
Trump is the one using DHS as his own personal police force INSIDE THE COUNTRY on American Citizens, jackass.  Also, yes, Biden did write the crime bill. He regrets it.  Though what party is supported by the KKK, Nazis, and White Supremacists in this country? OH RIGHT. GOP.
Yeah! I like how he's telling everyone to wear masks in the video below, but do you see him or any of staff wearing masks? 🤔
Weekend at Biden’s
What's going on in Democratic cities and states is what America can expect in a Biden run America. Because this madness will spread if you Dems win in America. Then in that scenario it would be Biden's America ,only America will be lost if Biden wins.That's why we must vote TrumpUm African Americans are not originated in the US. Hence their name AFRICAN. They are from Africa which has 54 different countries. And you want this clown (Biden) to be your next president. You are funny.
Burn that garbage, Trump is going down November 3rd...Biden 2020 MFers 🤣
Maybe Joe Biden should pick who he’d want to be his Vice President and tell everyone who disagrees to fuck off
Jacques: Biden's 'women agenda' falls flat  via
Posted an anti-Trump thought tonight. Had someone "enlighten" me that Joe Biden is being controlled by Satanists and pedophiles who want to undo Trump's help for Christians.   I respectfully disagreed. I was then told I was "beguiled by the devil."   So, how was your day?
You mean when Biden is running for his second term and Trump is in prison and bankrupt.
I tend to agree for the most part, but I don't care that Biden is "old" so long as he is a democrat he has my vote and any other "D" I can vote for.  We have to get Trump and as many Republicans out in order to undo this nightmare.
People are irate because it shouldn’t matter who Biden picks as VP. A decent person can look at the two choices that we have - Trump or Biden - and choose Biden without hesitation, no matter what. Because Trump is NEVER an acceptable choice.
Only this sweaty orange man can stop Biden from hurting God.
Your in denial of reality. Biden's on a sinking ship , the Titanic.
Oh thank goodness! Thanks, Pastor Dave for setting my mind at ease. I will sleep soundly tonight for sure. I sure hope Biden doesn't get elected, because poor god will be defenseless if we don't have guns to protect him with. #sarcasm
Our God is a puny god who can be hurt by Biden....is that how that song goes.
Biden is either very powerful or God is a puny god.
If Biden can hurt God, than God is weak or Biden is poweful like Yoda or Gandalf.
tRump is confusing Joe Biden's policy on China with HIS policy on Russia. Stupid as the day is long.
"Uhh... did Joe Biden just say that Black people are all the same". No, he said there were "notable exceptions".
She actually made a very good point. If Biden picks Harris then he will not lose any progressive voters but if he picks Rice he may loses some conservative voters.
Trump is obviously referring to Biden's training with Hattori Hanzo.
I don't know about the God thing... but Biden sure does want to take away some guns, and has made a big push for the green new deal... which would put 10's of thousands out of a job.  you know that though, but your job makes you a professional liar.
Don’t vote Biden plz
I know none of us want trump, but we can acknowledge that Biden is racist as hell too right?
The problem is Biden doesn’t even know what he’s saying anymore.
Imagine if trump asked a black reporter if he did coke before they went on air and then continued to ask if he was a junky   Just imagine the headlines “trump racist, implies African American journal..”   But Biden does it? Not a peep
Honestly if we don’t see Biden and trump speak to each other on a debate stage then we shouldn’t have an election.   1. You should have to be able to defend your platform in a non-scripted setting   2. If either of them catch Covid let’s be fucking honest nobody is gonna cry
The idea that any of the corporate media calls account to power is a joke. Other than a few exceptions, most media scares people and only gives them a very small ideas to choose from. Why are they completely ignoring Jo Jorgensen? There are so many people sick of Trump and Biden.
Honestly Covid or not I think the American people deserve to at least see trump and Biden battle about IQ tests on a debate stage like this needs to happen
I remember him doing that to Rudy, "Okay, Noun, verb, 9/11."  Methinks Biden saw something none of us knew until much later.
My only problem with this statement is that Biden is going to decimate Trump. I cannot imagine that any single VP option on Biden's list won't do the same to Pence.
Joe Biden is perfectly capable &amp; trustworthy with the Nuclear Football.
Biden cares about Hunter more than American people!
People are going to vote for Biden because he's not Trump. No other reason than that
Yeah I get that Biden is a little off. But I like him better than Trump...plain and simple.
Why do they push “Kanye” agenda? He actually make people vote for Biden
Trump if he loses the election to Biden
Although I believe Biden will need at least the $377 to sanitize the West Wing of all bugs and listening devices when he wins, you  have got to be kidding with the rest of the pork you added to the House Bill.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Biden should be in jail for black mailing Ukraine over the firing of prosecutor in exchange for of release of funding then later on camera Biden is caught bragging about how he held up the funding until they fired the prosecutor.
I’m gonna miss not having debates with an audience cause I was hoping Biden would invite all of the women Trump sexually abused to sit in the audience like that ba$tard did with The Clinton’s. The difference being it didn’t rattle Hillary it would totally shut Trump down.

If Biden decides to debate trump. Biden should bring all the girls and women he attacked and called them names.
Reading  statements about the terrible explosion today in Jordan is like.... what the hell are you even talking about? What a stupid fucking goon. Possibly as senile as Biden at this point tbh. I hate this place.
Not outside the realm of possibility that Biden simply doesn’t realize he needs to pick a VP.
B all day long. Racism and nationalism is not American. Biden kneeled in front of peaceful protestors to say " I hear you, I care". Your dad threw pepper spray at them. I want a leader that leads in decency, not scream hate.
taxes will go up to 70 % if Biden is elected
big surprise no !!!!! USA will become more like socialist South America if Biden  is elected
Lol mandates end Nov. 5th conveniently 😂😂 all Biden supporters don’t care because they think it helps their votes.
A Biden victory in November followed by a “War on Christmas™️” in December? Pass the egg nog!
I live in Michigan and I'm voting for Joe Biden. I'm encouraging every single person I know to do the same. I can feel the momentum!
Warren is Great But too far to the left (which is fine with me) But Biden cannot afford the socialist and communistic ads that would follow with her False advertisements with only part of things she's said in public America will be like Cuba or China and Russia for instance
Vote for Joe Biden and turn all states blue
It is ponderous that many people are embracing that Trump or Biden is a genius because most evidence thus far suggests the contrary. People are investing their personal identities into highly flawed candidates to put it in the most generous terms.
It's life or death for this country and the world. If Biden gets in, he will be immediately removed because he's incompetent and Pelosi will figure out how to take over. Then communism isn't far behind.
It's funny. I talk to the people I know who voted for Bernie. They won't vote for Biden at ALL. I'm like, "You know that's a vote for Trump right?" They go off on me.  But I get shit because I am voting for Biden. I'm not progressive, or smart enough, or helping people... WTF.
I will tell you where Joe Biden is on this, he’s part of the problem and his silence condones the behavior.
Saw an ad attacking Biden for exaggerating academic credentials. Clip was from 33 years ago. I began wondering how far back would we have to go to find tRump lying? Oh, right. That would sometime today. BTW where are his academic records?
Get back to me when Trump is leading by 6+ points statewide in MN. Then we can talk about 70-30 in NW MN. Right now though, Biden's outperforming Clinton by quite a bit in the state, and there's no reason to think MN07 would be an exception. Trump will win it, but not by 40.
The man in the White House doesn’t even know the difference between absentee voting and “vote-by-mail”
nah. biden is trustworthy. full stop.
Biden in his current mental state, may nominate Minnie Mouse for VP.
Trump's not going to win MN07 by 40 lol. Not while a poll shows him down 7 in MN01 and not while Biden is winning by near or over 10 points statewide
I would never donate to joe Biden’s campaign. He will never earn my vote. He is by no way qualified to run our country. President Trump is doing a fabulous job. Donald Trump rules. I can’t even imagine Joe Biden attending a closed board meeting surrounded by world leaders.
Enjoy your visit with your parents. Be careful and wear a mask and socially distance from others. Michigan is seeing a rise in covid again. I believe MI will be a Biden state in November!
Are you kidding. Vote for trump if you don't like Biden.Biden will bring this country back to civility. Trump has done wrong by every race except for his base the white supremacists
You need to give it a rest. He was investigated and they found nothing wrong. Your just upset your losing to Joe Biden. He will be our next President
I live in Michigan and I'm voting for Joe Biden.
Biden wants to raise my taxes and have us pay more at the pump and destroy manufacturing jobs. Raise the crime rate and flood the country with foreign immigrants. I.E. Cheap labor. Why would anyone vote for him?
Yes.  Still voting for Biden.
It all depends on what happens 2021-23. Maybe Crenshaw emerges as the favorite. It also depends on whether or not Biden seeks a second term. All circumstantial.
That means Biden will be president, not you. I’ll take my chances.
If Joe Biden picked Bonzo or his sister, I'd support the selection. As long as he/she does not constantly look adoringly at him like some VPs we could mention (Pence).
That’s really funny you say that, since Obama was the president, Joe Biden was the Vice President and Hillary Clinton won the popular vote when she ran against trump. Idiot
I do not believe the world (or me) will exhale until Biden is safely ensconced in the White House and tRump is gone to wherever he is gonna go.
I have no comment on that, and if we are using an allegation as a reason to not focus on the wars. What about Tara Reade against Biden. I have no interest in playing politics. There are tons of things I disagree with Tucker on, but at least he talks about the wars.
You can vote for Biden, not vote at all, etc. In the long run, it doesn’t really matter because we’ll always be systemically oppressed as long as we have national elections, esp between two parties. So me? I don’t care what you do. Just don’t force people to vote for x person.
Excellent point.  He is sick.  Needs help.  And his trashing Biden is getting tiring.
Yea except most of that Biden is exuding and way more older than Donald 😊
If you’re getting heated about who Biden will pick for VP: don’t ❤️
I guess it’s time for the polls to flip Trumps turn to fundraise then the polls will flip back and Biden can make $$$
No corruption to report about Biden.
let’s just get it straight, i’m mexican, i will always respect the flag, if you kneel during the national anthem you’re disrespectful. black lives matter and so does everyone’s lives but the blm “movement” has become a joke. biden is retarded asf, last of all. kanye 2020
That's funny. You're a real hoot. However, I believe Joe Biden was vice president when Barack Obama pulled us out of the great recession.
Hey. Don't be supporting dopey Joe Biden. You seem not to realize that the majority of your followers are Trump supporters.
It doesn't matter constitutionally. His current term ends on January 20th. In contesting the election, he risks that a timely decision will not be made. That puts him out on Jan.20. Not Biden or Trump, it will be #PresidentPelosi
Yeah I can’t imagine him showing up for Biden’s inauguration. He’ll have some excuse. I just want his margin of defeat to be so large that he can’t lie to himself about it. He’ll lie to everyone else for sure. But I just want him to have to admit to himself that he lost.
I talked to a customer today, and they were hardcore Biden fans. They were talking trash about the wall being built. I told them that the wall protects a lot of children being human trafficked. They told me so what?! That’s not the worst problem our country faced.. it’s trump 😂
And  I am hoping Biden &amp; Harris will be in :-) ♥
I think you need to #1 take a look around, YOU ARE NOT DOING YOUR JOB. You can't assess anyone else, you cannot even do YOUR JOB! You cannot even manage a crisis SO BIDEN has to do it for you!
You bet, "make American great again" because it was great until you got in the White House, now we have a mess and Biden WILL make it GREAT ♥
As the Biden Campaign launches “Moms For Biden” tonight it’s important to remember his radical agenda:  ➡️ Higher taxes ➡️ Defunding the police ➡️ Government takeover of healthcare  ➡️ Job-killing Green New Deal  Biden’s destructive policies are completely out of touch with moms!
so are you gonna cheerlead and knock doors and advocate publicly for biden?
No need to worry sweetie, it won't be a close election. 3% means nothing when Biden is getting 90% of the votes.
He’s shook. That’s why he’s talking about mail in voting. They know that’s Biden’s only chance of winning.
You wanna vote for Biden cause he’s not Trump? Fine.  But I never thought I’d see Palestinians and Arabs cheerlead for a guy who openly and proudly says “I am a Zionist.”  It’s shameful. #Palestine #FreePalestine
That’s some funny shit... vote for Biden. Dying! 😂😂😂😂😂
Trump offers many statements that are phony but current economic disruptions are not the result of one person. This derailment included the near entirety of both parties wounding the economy and abandoning the public. #US #CARES #Democrats #Republicans
hey Biden, operation warp speed, sounds like a plan. This contradicts your assertion that there is no plan to distribute the vaccine when it is available. ( 7/29/20 speech )
That’s funny I thought Biden was the moderate choice and people are voting for him because he won’t do to us what Trump has done
BIDEN WILL BE HAPPY THERE
Biden is Discusting!👿
BIDEN AND CHINA ARE BUTT BUDDIES
I don’t see it as a fear of others.. more of a personal decision on how she needs to frame the election. Pretty clear she is not a Biden fan but she’s ready &amp; willing to work on getting him elected. Odd? Yup. Anti-democratic or big deal outside of twitter? Nah. She’ll put in work
Biden will have donkeys pulling cars by next year if he is elect our good union friends will help him get elected and will put the auto companies out of work
Except Biden when he writes it on his little notepad. 😆
“I think she wrote an article about why she won’t vote for Biden.” Wrong.  “She said she won't endorse him but won't campaign against him. How does that make her stance on the election any better?” Because she didn’t imply she’d sit out this cycle? Don’t put words in her mouth 🤷🏻‍♂️
Trump is the one using DHS as his own personal police force INSIDE THE COUNTRY on American Citizens, jackass.  Also, yes, Biden did write the crime bill. He regrets it.  Though what party is supported by the KKK, Nazis, and White Supremacists in this country? OH RIGHT. GOP.
Had this occurred under Obama/Biden it would have been handled swiftly and correctly.....it NEVER would have been called a hoax

What's going on in Democratic cities and states is what America can expect in a Biden run America. Because this madness will spread if you Dems win in America. Then in that scenario it would be Biden's America ,only America will be lost if Biden wins.That's why we must vote Trump
I think people are more worried about Trump getting another 4 years then the fact that Biden is moderate or subpar
If you think joe Biden is left wing you’re smoking crackI just took what the polling map was saying and shaded in the solids. I looked at what stated went red or blue for both of Obama’s elections and that’s how I determined which will be red or blue. Even if Joe Biden doesn’t have those toss up states he’d win
had lunch w a good friend who works in commercial real estate. Hates Trump, voted for Hillary in 16 but is leaning Trump bc Biden is too cozy with the far left &amp; talking about removing 1031 non taxable exchanges. Assuring him that won’t pass the Senate didn’t help.

If you were a betting man, do you think he'll debate Biden?
Biden comes off incoherent in scripted YouTube videos.  Imagine a free flowing presidential debate. Im on record saying, “we’ll never see it happen”.
We had 100k .223 this morning and it sold in 2.5 hours.  We should have more next week, but in limited quantities.  9mm is going to be at least a month, maybe more.  Small pistol primers are harder to find right now than Joe Biden.
Fuck Kanye West Fuck G.O.O.D. Music as a staff, record label, and as a motherfuckin' crew! And if you wanna be down with Kanye West then fuck you too!
Dr. Biden why is your mouth touching me down there..
Sadly, I wasn't following  so I wasn't able to unfollow her for saying such a selfish, stupid, and soul-killing thing.  I'm with you.  Biden can choose my not-housebroken dog for VP and he's still got my vote.
If you hem and haw about voting for Biden you are 🗑
Anyone that puts conditions on voting for Biden is 🗑
I guess that they just realized that they ARE NOT BLACK ENOUGH to vote for Biden.
Trump team transition plan: - burn all papers - transfer bank accounts to Switzerland  - make sure passports are current  - lawyer up - get out of town before Sen Biden takes office  stay safe
Yet another reason I will never vote for Biden
If elected, I hope Biden never tweets.
Hi! I’m the Novi organizer for Michigan Dems and I saw your awesome tweet. Thanks for supporting Joe Biden. Can you volunteer this week to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot?
I would support the nomination of Joe Biden’s Corvette for VP.
🐃💩 In election after election, the majority of the PEOPLE chose Biden by large margins. THAT is democracy. The many failures &amp; corruption of Trump merit his defeat, &amp; RBG deserves support for her effort to live long enough to avoid Trump picking another justice. #VoteBlue

You realize that this virus came from China not Mar-A-Lago or Trump towers... Your stupidity is not going to get Biden elected.
What about Trump? And Biden is a stutter too
I don't think Trump will debate Biden.
Only Biden supporters are going to see these tweets - we need to figure out a reasonable, effective and scientific way to deal with shit like this over the next few months so it’s not the next few years
And y’all say Biden is senile and has dementia
The other reason Democrats want Biden to shun debates
Haters gonna hate. Can’t wait until President Biden makes them crawl back in the shadows. Remember when we had a civil intellectual discussions? Trumps moronic rhetoric made that a thing of the past.
1) Hunter Biden isn’t running.  2) Unlike Trump, VP Biden has not practiced nepotism &amp; put unelected, unconfirmed, unqualified family members in top government roles.  3) Where are Trump’s tax returns?  4) Where are all the migrant kids you separated from families &amp; lost?
If Biden becomes President, he vows to ban all gas powered vehicles.  Instead, he’s giving everyone (illegal immigrants and convicted felons included) a flying car that runs on aluminum cans at NO CHARGE!  Also, he’ll make COVID illegal so everyone will be safe!
Idiot, Republicans are literally the only ones who think democrats don’t want a debate between Biden and Trump. Biden may stutter, but all Trump can do is lie.
This Trump ad’s attack against Biden is literally that he “wants to transform America”... ok soo good? It’s long overdue for an update?
That's Biden who doesn't know where he is.
after spending 30 minutes on the phone with him trying to convince him to vote for biden, i dont think so
Joe Biden needs to stop listening to tired old retreads like Ed Rendell and Chris Dodd. People like this gave us flawed Clinton-Kaine as ticket in 2016. Don't think Susan Rice is the right pick, but despite that he's talking about her smiling? ENOUGH OLD WHITE MAN MISOGYNY!
Yeah his staff has to make all the announcements Biden can't keep things straight. This is probably why the positive covid-19 cases are on the rise in Texas. They are feeding America false statistical data to try to influence the voters in the state of Texas.
Kinda feels like Biden (Biden's handlers) are starting to get cold feet. Wonder why? Afraid that once the curtain is pulled away from the "Great Oz/Sleepy Jo" we will see a shriveled up old dementia patient?
Don't they have some new slogan about "vote for Joe Biden anyway" or something like that?  This is going to be a shitshow.
Look, you cannot bring up Biden’s name in Michigan without eliciting a laugh and a shake of the head. Remember things were going very well before the COVID-19 virus. Everything that the hi-jacked Democratic Party has schemed against Trump has failed miserably.
Desperation time.  Trump is a terrible extemporaneous speaker outside his adoring throng rallies.  His campaign is pushing for more debates in hopes of a Biden gaffe or off night they can exploit.  BTW, VP Biden participated in all 11 Democratic debates.
Biden Is Right. Pay for Home Health Workers Is Paltry.
Why would Biden supporters risk contracting the #trumpvirus or waste their time attending your pep rallies?
Biden is right. Pay for home health workers is paltry
10 (NO doubt!) - if it's a fair election...  (But I'm not sure what ways the socialist-democrats are planning on stealing the election... They're not going to win legitimately with Biden).
Too late SweetTart, that toothpaste can't be put back in the tube.
And you think any of your agenda can happen without Joe Biden? You are wrong. You are dangerous and You are further risking our climate, our democracy and our freedoms in America. I cannot believe the vile messages you spew!
Michigan stands with Biden.
So having Biden say that HE WOULD VETO M4A if Congress, representing the will of over 2 out of 3 citizens, AND VOTERS, pass it is just stupid policy and politics.
The trump campaign thinks they can turn the election by going negative on Biden. They don’t see that trump is seen as incompetent and ineffective on COVID and the economy by the majority. So good for them. Keep it up.
He’s trying to fix how badly he’s bungled the Census. Biden May need to do another one. These people are a joke.
He going to develop Joe Biden CRS Syndrome (Can't Remember Shit) in 3...2...1... 🤣
Biden screwing this up w/ such a huge lead is so disappointing. The most frustrating thing about Dems is how they bare knuckle box each other so everyone’s damaged moving forward. Rice, worst pick possible solely on Obama Admin foreign policy failures. Why remind people of that?
what’s it like being an organizer? seeing biden and peters yard signs in front of one of your new neighbour’s houses and immediately noting it down to look them up in van to recruit them to volunteer
I think you should be Biden’s VP.
If there is no election,  then the presidency will be open and the Speaker of the House becomes the president. There is no requirement the speaker be a member of the House. The dems could chose Biden.
Frump is a sorry excuse for a Commander in Chief! We need Joe Biden to lead our Country back to prosperity. 🇺🇲👍🏾🌊🌊
Anyone fooled by #traitor tot is seriously delusional!  This is #TrumpsAmerica   Not Biden’s. You are a byproduct of your damaged fathers need to win at all costs. I read the book.
In 2009 the unemployment rate was 9.9%.  In 2016 it was 4.7%, a reduction of over 50%.  During the last 3 years of Obama / Biden the US economy added more jobs than the first 3 years of Trump (even before the virus).
I have faith in the men and women of our military.  And I think it might be the Secret Service who would drag Trump out of the WH, part of their job in protecting Pres Biden.
Biden quote:  ““Mark my words I think he [Trump] is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held.”  Turley, you are an embarrassment.
Please let’s hope she does, it might be a faster exit for both Biden and her.
It will be ready for Biden.

“The former vice president went on to condemn police officers who have been on duty during the protests, saying it is unacceptable “for our police — sworn to protect and serve all people — to escalate tensions or resort to excessive violence.”
Watching television in #Michigan just got a whole lot better
The only way Biden and the Communist Democrats are going to win is if they cheat YUGELY!  This has to be prevented!
No it's the Democrats whose base is dwindling. Democrats see all of this senseless violence on TV and are afraid of it. If Biden somehow cheats his way into the White House the police will be eliminated, taxes will rise and unemployment will skyrocket.
It's funny how you Democrats never talk about Biden and what he plans to do. I guess he hasn't been told yet by the DNC?

No, I won't be silent. Joe Biden is a terrible Catholic in name only. He promotes abortion, has officiated at a so-called same-sex marriage at the white house, he's cool with Marxism. Joe Biden is a horrible Catholic and he deserves all the scorn Trump gives him. Get over it.
Not it. It's Beto being in charge of gun reform for Biden (Hell ya were going to take your guns). It's the Progressive squad running the country, using Biden as a face, then again Biden will step down due to old age, so watch who the VP is because thats who they want in office.

Truth. Biden’s not perfect by any stretch, but he came out, owned up to what he said and apologized. When was the last time Trump admitted wrongdoing on anything?
Yup!!! And now we’re likely gonna end up with a Biden/Harris ticket and I can’t even. lol

Yeah right. That makes no sense. They don't want Trump so they are denigrating Biden?? Seems like more trumpy lies to me
Um African Americans are not originated in the US. Hence their name AFRICAN. They are from Africa which has 54 different countries. And you want this clown (Biden) to be your next president. You are funny.
HIDEN BIDEN AIN'T WORTH THE SWEAT OFF MY
Good job on taking control over your guest today on religion. But Joe Biden has never done anything for the church. It about policy. Trump came in office and change policy to help the church. There is 40% evangelicals in America who are voting for Trump.
Considering it's obvious Biden doesn't even use his own Twitter account I seriously doubt he's sorry for what he said and probably doesn't even know this tweet exists.  Whatever unpaid intern they got doing this account must be pretty damn tired by now.
“Trump says things that make me feel uncomfortable but Biden talks nice. Is it really that big of a deal that he supports infaticide?”
You know people like you and Fox News try to discriminate Joe Biden you are you taking the content of what he said in reality go back to Trump at Congress making fun of Mitt Romney for opening his Bible after Trump fire them made fun of him to so stay off of Joe please
So, liberals get pissed at Bernie for not mentioning black people quick enough during a speech but Biden says this shit as well as "You ain't black" if you don't vote for him and they ain't got shit to say about that, huh?  #LiberalDipshits  #LiberalHypocrisy
If you think Biden is going to “hurt the Bible,” or “hurt god,” I think you’re getting your information from the wrong source (a guy who can’t even name a passage from the Bible, and has hurt god in at least 26 ways in the form of sexual assault).
President Trump liberal fake news racist while Biden is a real life racist
Way too many...I don’t think Biden will win Michigan
A conservative oped attacking The Biden Agenda for Women doesnt deserve to have been published considering the person currently in office. I’m done w  since they can’t even have a reasonable bar for oped’s.
"Biden helped kill the most effective policy for improving black educational attainment that America has ever known...[and] worked tirelessly..to make America’s (profoundly racist) criminal-justice system more punitive than any other advanced democracy’s."
Trump is terrible, but that doesn't mean Biden is good--&gt;  "Here are three ways the 1994 crime bill [that Joe Biden wrote] continues to undermine the safety and well-being of communities of color..."
Glad you had a black person speaking for us on Biden comments. Unlike the white one you had so tire of white host telling us what offends us. How does she know is she black. Another white Dem presuming they speak for us that why millions of black voting for Trump.
(From  THIS is how the media covers for Joe Biden and his 'race comments' [UPDATE: Chris Wallace does the same thing!]
Biden proves his Christian beliefs by actively caring about the welfare of others. He is a nice guy, which is something no one could ever say about Trump. Jill and Joe demonstrate their love for each other, always.
Regardless of who’s on the ballot in this upcoming election man please be wise. Biden is better than trump. The Kanye shit is all a rebukican ploy to get less votes for Biden b/c they know how naïve black and minority voters can be. Please don’t be fooled about this shit
Are you being sarcastic? A GOP leaning partisan poll that doesn’t show Trump hit 50% doesn’t show major structural changes in the state? It might not be a true bellweather but it’s def a swing state! How is this poll more valid than DMN Biden +5 poll  or the more recent Q-poll?
I honestly don't think Biden needs to clarify his racist comments anymore  We know he's a racist Clarified
China Joe Biden thinks because he was Obama's VP he is entitled to the Black vote. I think he is very confused to say the least!
I read yesterday where Kanya was running to take Black votes from Biden, now he's saying he want to win, Look America your Vote is Much too important to be Played with as we're experiencing Now, Don't Waste Your Vote Voting Stupid
Now Joe Biden wanna apologize for some new low key racist shit he said. White folks been apologizing like a muthafucka all year but turn around and continue being racist. At this point fuck y’all apology.
Behold everyone, Biden's compilation.
And it rhymes too. So clearly God intended for us to call him Hidin’ Biden. I think that’s pretty clear at this point.
Watch them blame Dems before Biden's hand leaves the bible on Jan 20th
I love how Biden boxed himself in with the whole “I’m picking a Black Women for my VP. Which was really racist to begin with
Speaking of Confederate flags, looks like David Duke didn't get the memo that he was supposed to endorse Biden.

This some shit Joe Biden would say
It's also a very Anti-Catholic thing to say that Biden is against the Bible! Who's advising this moron to make these comments? He's just spiting out whatever wacky thing that comes into his head, and throwing his feces with both hands, it's sad and pathetic! Time to resign now!

#boycottKardashians Is anyone surprised that the family that sells themselves for money and ratings would support a man who is playing with the presidency. Kanye says he has no desire to win he just want to hurt Biden. Bankrolled by the RNC it shows their disregard for America.
Nobody is taking my guns or anyone elses, if Biden wins, its fixed!! The sleeping giant will awaken and take down the radical left once and for all...true story!!!
Biden gaffs are just that gaffs. Whereas Trump doesn't make gaffs, when he says something stupid he means it, stands by it, and then spends a month lying about it.
Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible, hurt God,' guns-I've never heard or seen anything like this in my life and I'm almost 70 years old! Donald Trump needs a Mental Evaluation a much more serious one than he bragged about that a grade school kid could master, he's a sick man-
Why my community don't see this white man Biden as a racist is beyond me!
Terry, how are these related things? How is Biden winning the Democratic nomination a byproduct of BLM? I agree with the critique of the choices produced by our two-party system, but I fail to see how this has anything to do with BLM.
Wow. That should be enough for him to lose the ele...wait. Biden said racist things. But Trump said thigh.
Yeah YouTube is cunts Especially for people like that. They're silencing dissent and if you mention the Rona by name&amp; ur monetized  you're toast. The closer to the election we get the more it's getting censored. I can't skip 45 or Biden ads aimed at my region at all anymore
Maybe Joe Biden should pick who he’d want to be his Vice President and tell everyone who disagrees to fuck off
Joe Biden says "you aint black"
I feel the same way. It seems however, that every time I start to think I need to just suck it up and vote for Biden because Trump is really that bad, Biden opens his mouth and I’m back to fk it, let it all burn.

No. Every few weeks and sometimes every few days biden says some ignorant or racist crap and his Twitter handlers have to backtrack or spin what he said. Just like Kellyanne Conway would do for trump. Show us some damn respect and stop making excuses for him.
Both of our candidates are racist as fuck. If you can’t see that you are brainwashed yourself. Trump has made racial remarks regularly and Biden has surrounded much of what he talks about with racist connotations. Let’s not beat around the bush, it is happening on both ends.

I must disagree with Speaker Pelosi on this.  When John McCain chose Palin, it was such a bad judgement call that I immediately dismissed McCain as a candidate.  However, these are not normal times.  Biden has my vote no matter his VP pick.
Polls are likely to continue to tighten as the election draws nearer and Trump's misinformation machine churns on. We cannot get complacent, and we must do everything we can to reach voters.
Always on point #RobinWilliams #JoeBiden Robin Williams – Rambling Joe Biden  via
This could be the greatest pay per view event of all times..  Biden vs God  In the Blue corner. Weighing in at 181 lbs, 6 feet tall... From Scranton Pennsylvania Jooooooeee Biden  In the gold corner weighing in at 1 oz to 2000 lb at an unknown height from heaven. Goddddd
i will scream it into the void how much black lives will be affected if trump gets elected again and yall dont wanna vote bc biden isnt perfect. ugh the privilege!!!
angela davis is voting for biden if that tells you anything!!! you are not revolutionary for doing nothing!!!¡
The truth behind why the #QanonArmy does not want you wearing a mask. Thanks Master Q for making this known.   #fridaymorning  #FridayFunDay  #Biden  #TrumpCrimeFamily
Biden campaign plans to hit Trump over auto job promises  via
I like VP picks who terrify Wall Street. #WarrenForVP
#DetroitToday First debate should be a match of "Words with Friends" and broadcast it live. T Carlson and A Cooper could be the commentators.  Tucker, "Biden used a word with Latin origin, he's hates America."  Anderson, "Trump responds with the word  'of'  STRONG word for him."
realDonaldTrump: After yesterday’s statement, Sleepy Joe Biden is no longer worthy of the Black Vote!
Basement Biden should speak EVERY DAY!!!
That’s funny; Biden talk? Even attempt to get his party leaders to negotiate? Really? They have negotiated since before Obama was president. Please!  is a puppet to “his” party. Stop being funny Hugh
I believe that Rep. Dingell, like her late husband DOES care. Joe Biden? Not so sure about that.
Maybe they could play a match of "Words with Friends" and broadcast it live.  Tucker Carlson and Anderson Cooper could be the commentators.  Tucker, "Biden used a word with Latin origin, he's hates America."  Anderson, "Trump responds with the word  'of'  STRONG word for him."
One could make the argument that, like Lincoln, VP Biden has managed this fine line as well.
Biden versus Trump. Some speculate that the future of the republic hinges on the outcome of the next election. But for smart investors it doesn't really matter who wins.
Biden hasn't been the president yet. Why don't you compare Trump to President Obama?
This could be the greatest pay per view event of all times..  Biden vs God  In the Blue corner. Weighing in at 181 lbs, 6 feet tall... From Scranton Pennsylvania Jooooooeee Biden  In the gold corner weighing in at 1 oz to 2000 lb at an unknown height from heaven. Goddddd

realDonaldTrump: Just like Radical Left New York is trying to destroy the NRA, if Biden becomes President your GREAT SECOND AMENDMENT doesn’t have a chance. Your guns will be taken away, immediately and without notice. No police, no guns!
Whoever you are, you are just speaking for a puppet, Joe Biden, No One believes it is really him!!!
Biden can’t enunciate ‘mental fitness’, so there’s that.
I love “THIGH FOOD” don’t you? I usually order it when I go to Yo-Semite 🤣🤣🤣🤣 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ Idiot &amp; he &amp; his cult base have nerve talking shit about Joe Biden please
the Catholic hates GOD ok while  gasses people for a photo-op to hold the Bible upside down in front of a church &amp; can’t even recite one psalm or state what his favorite scripture from the Bible is 🤔 U ConMan are against GOD  NOT BIDEN
Kanye West is a sellout and a disgrace of a black man if he allows Trump to prostitute him to steer democratic votes from Joe Biden.  A black man who tries to sabotage black progress is an Uncle Tom, and any black person that votes for him is a fool.
So unfair. Boo hoo. Unprecedented. Biden would have won otherwise. Thanks JA for your courage and insight.
Fighting to make the change only to replace him with worthless Corporate owned puppet Joe Biden is more effort than I’m willing to give. They are both so shitty I’m fine with either of em.  Neither give a shit about the working class. Waste your time if you must.

The goal is to not take away votes from Biden!
Totally agree! I would have thrown in the towel and dumped it all in Biden and Pelosi’s laps. He loves America too much. He is a natural leader! Besides, his ego would not allow him to do that. TRUMP 2020!!!
At this point, I'm more worried that Donald Trump has completely become unstable and unfit to serve the rest of the term.   Time to seriously consider the #25thAmendmentNow   He thinks Biden is going to hurt God. So I would support his sending children/teachers back to school.
You really think a trump voter would vote for biden? Yikes
I heard Biden is going to make ketchup illegal because it is RED, and the old Soviet Union has a red flag China has a red flag and the Republican party is red. What a bastard. I voting for Trump now.
Considering that God is supposed to be omnipotent, it seems to me that having the ability to hurt him would be a selling point for Biden.
if the right doesn’t agree with biden’s policies, idk why they keep calling them radical
back to my comment on your latest column and not voting for Biden. You would be willing to put with this.
So you are uncomfortable with the direction Trump has/is taking the country yet you will write someone in instead of voting for Biden? You might as well vote for Trump, by noting voting for Biden you are giving the edge to the status quo
I’m glad you understand the hypocricy. It’s okay to go after Biden for anything but when Trump sounds like a child it’s “award-winning journalism”. Your whatbaoutism is outstandingly stupid.
Wait I thought you wanted to court my vote, Donald. This only makes me want to vote for Biden even more, even if it is a complete lie.
come on Bro. That is straight up Racist.   Why covering for Biden when it is so so so obvious?
Electing Joe Biden starts with YOU being a registered voter 😌Anyone living in Michigan through November 3rd can go to this website RIGHT NOW and follow the steps to register within 5 minutes.   Take this time now so that it's not on your plate for later:)
So what are you saying? Biden should turn himself as black?
All good questions. I also heard that people didn't fill it out because Trump or Biden wasn't on it. Lots of voters are in the habit of ignoring primaries or misunderstanding them.
Yes. Detroit area. Some big ones, too. Mostly homemade.   The Biden people need to be giving away signs. NOW
This is FB page of Voice of America in Albanian Language stating that Joe Biden will be the next President, elaborating also that Biden will defeat  It’s a shame that VOA confusing Albanians with such (dis) information!
Under US code #2381 Joe Biden cannot run for office because of Treason!
Why isn’t Biden out there more? He is trying to be the president.
realDonaldTrump: How can voters be sending in Ballots starting, in some cases, one month before the First Presidential Debate. Move the First Debate up. A debate, to me, is a Public Service. Joe Biden and I owe it to the American People!
True this country was built on hard work of immigrants including technology leadership but Biden agenda is pro Pakistan China and anti India on Indian state of Kashmir.
You know what concerns me is people like  are so deep in their alternate reality, they will be completely blindsided by the actuality of a Biden victory. Despite the evidence to the contrary, they will say Democrats stole the election. I would bet money on it.
Crap, Biden doesn't want to share the same stage with that lying fool getting insulted and I don't blame him. He saw what happened  to Hillary. Lol Biden say I'm too old for that blank.
#1 is simple enough to check on...see their work product. If they’re doing good work to hurt Trump/GOP and help Biden/Dems, it shows. So far most of their ads/videos have been decent to excellent. Think  is getting rich off of it? Beats me, but I doubt it.
There seem to be 3 main concerns among Dems about    etc: 1. What if it’s just a scam/grift? 2. What if they turn on Biden/Dems the moment he/they take control &amp; work against us? 3. Even if they’re legit, Dem $ should go to Dems!
Good point about the election. Maybe you could do a segment about Biden versus Trump stocks? Certainly energy up Trump down Biden.
Be canned at Biden's 😂
No accusations?  The intent of your posts is clearly to lead the reader to conclude Trump is a Pedo.  &amp; don’t put words into my mouth.  Never called Biden a pedo.  I said there is more basis in that one video to conclude Biden is a pedo than you guys have to say the same of Trump
Just explained to my family that I can’t vote for trump or Biden because neither of them made Late Registration. Neither of them could make a record like Yeezus. My uncle asked me if I was on crack
Make it in America = Joe Biden  Manufacturing jobs = Joe Biden  How do I know this folks?   I’ve seen him do it with my own eyes. He’s done it once before and he is going to do it again!   Regrow, rebuild America.  That’s our Joe.
I can't wait for another round of Joe Biden memes.
In 2016 Trump running opposed got about 480,000 votes Joe Biden, even with people still voting for Bernie Sanders who got 500,000 votes, just got over 800,000.
One more thing and then this is over.  There is more basis to claim Biden is a pedo in this vid than everything you and your Trump is a pedo cohorts have come up with in these tweets.
Joe Biden is the national reset we need on COVID-19, but he's more than 75,000 lives away
Thanks! Now I know how I WON’T vote!! You want your Dems to take this with them to the polls or just print it out and submit it as their phony ballot? Not a bad idea since they can’t think for themselves — just like your buddy Biden!
Easy vote out that POS in November!!!! Vote blue!!! Vote Biden!!!! #Biden2020Landslide #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS #BlueWave2020TakeOver
BLM and Antifa rioting in Democrat Socialist controlled cities are receiving political cover from the Democrat Socialist mayors and governors. There are articles showing the DNC and Biden Campaign providing bail money and other funding.
Putin is pulling his strings. He is owning Trump, and will do what he can to destabilize us by making truth impossible to discern.  We need Russian experts to join Biden camp
The longer you tolerate this shitty ACA the longer you will tolerate Corporate Puppet Nominations like Biden.  Vote against Biden.  Trump may end the ACA.  Opens up the floor for Medicare 4 All.
What Kasich Gives Biden - The Atlantic
I’m voting against Biden. Idgaf who that corporate puppet picks. Whoever it is they voted against too.
Biden is like a cheating husband. For 40 years he voted against us and was paid handsomely to do so. This idiot voted to cut social security twice.
Sugar, cupcake, we don’t need Joe Biden. We demand Medicare for all. Sweetheart you had a chance to get the Boomers, the minority’s, the working class, and the young.  You chose Biden.  Buttercup don’t expect to win. You might but I am out on Corporate Joe.  Sugarplum
No Medicare for all. No vote for Biden. Maybe 2024 if not no vote for whoever the corporate puppet nominee is.
I do. I need a lot more than Corporate pole smoker Joe Biden can offer.  He voted across the aisle against us in a bi partisan manner for over 40 years. He made himself rich doing so. Rewarded by corps who enslave the working class.  Trump is ok by me.
You really want Biden. That is the most polite comment I’ve seen defending him.  You deserve a pass on a truck load of Biden hate I’m looking to bury someone in.
I’m not for Biden
Biden versus Trump. Some speculate that the future of the republic hinges on the outcome of the next election. But for smart investors it doesn't really matter who wins.
The Jill Biden interview was NOT surprising: phony smiles, phony statements, phony comments, especially, when she said that Joe is "moderate". Ha-ha-ha! I don't know what else we could expect from her?
Eric, how do you spell Yosemite, Yoseamight? You really should Stop mocking Joe Biden.
Everyone wonders who will be running the govt if Biden should -god forbid-win. If Susan Rice is VP, seems likely Obama will be pulling the strings. She was his go-to liar when needed. Heck, I always felt she acted like she had a crush on him-she'd do anything for BO!
We’ll see. Damn shame that Biden is the best they have to offer. Suspect he’s their placeholder.
realDonaldTrump: Big Pharma is taking ads against me because I am MASSIVELY lowering your drug prices, which is obviously not good for them. Medicare premiums will also be going down. I am the first President to take them on. Don’t fall for their false ads. Biden plan is for…
realDonaldTrump: My visits last week to Texas and Florida had massive numbers of cheering people gathered along the roads and highways, thousands and thousands, even bigger (by far) than the crowds of 2016. Saw no Biden supporters, and yet some in the Fake News said it was a…
I watch it in like Thank You God That Obama Not our President and Thank You God That hilary ain't because Obama Biden Hilary really Fuck this Country into a Coma and Thank You President Trump for all you do and my first vote will be for President Trump #TrumpBeatsBidenAss
Sooo there like 11k of you give or take most of you not even in the USA pathetic but what ever Nov 3rd #TrumpBeatsBidenAss #NoBallsBiden  You all be like 😭😭😭 Your alls bitching and crying be music to our ears to think biden can do what Hillary Couldn't thats adorable
Lmao he’s answered unscripted questions numerous times, asshat. This is not unlike when your ilk posted all of the photos of an invite only press conf that Biden had and called it a “rally” in retort to the orange clown drawing 6k ppl to Tulsa and embarrassing himself.
How STUPID IS OMAR? BIDEN is running in a basement NOT ON A PLATFORM - BITCH!
Someone in Biden's camp has mapped out a great campaign. Simply let Trump hang himself.
Tomorrow you'll have Jill Biden on your 2pm show. Are you going to ask her harsh ???, like WHY DID YOU ALLOW YOUR SICK HUSBAND TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT? IS HE GOING TO DEBATE TRUMP OR YOU HIDE HIM AGAIN IN YOUR BASEMENT? We'll be watching!
I really don’t understand why this is considered such a close race. Biden’s base includes young people who want to see socialism reign, or older people who just can’t stand Trump. The voting system is a joke. Biden is a puppet for the radical left. Is this what you want?
Be aware of new "grass roots" movement of Dems NOT TO HAVE the debates btw Biden &amp; Trump. The obvious reason is NOT that Trump will say "lies" and Joe will "correct" it. They just cannot allow sick man to show his SICKNESS! The liars CANNOT full the TrumpTrain! #Trump2020 !
#BasementJoe... Biden should not debate President Trump, Clinton’s ex-WH spokesman says
Even more of an incentive to elect Biden
Have seen more signs for Joe Biden than I ever did for Hillary Clinton and it's still very few.   The Biden campaign should be giving out yard signs everywhere. It's heartening and encouraging to see other Blue voters putting it out there.   That is what creates enthusiasm.
Biden has held a political position for over 40 years... you think he’s going to change things now? #GTFOH
Keep Joe Biden away from photo ops with tanks.
Trumps a Republican like Biden. They never do anything for the working class.
I don't blame Biden. I wouldn't want to be subjected to Trump's insults and lies either. That's a good strategy.
What does  know about #MadeinAmerica? The only thing Biden made in America was the millions of dollars China paid him. This guy's missing a few slices of bread if you ask anyone with 1/2 a brain. #Trump2020
Trump hasn’t done any damage! I don’t want Biden! And I don’t want to live in a socialist Country! Biden had over 50 years to do something ! He did nothing!He has Dementia and no one saids anything!
Am I the only one that hears  voice &amp; feels a sense of calmness? Please GOD answer the HUGE majority of AMERICANS prayers &amp; make sure Nov. 3rd we get President Joseph R. Biden to save us all &amp; to save America from the devil in the WH now! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🌊🌊🌊🌊
JFK won the South and Texas and the election in great part to his VP choice LBJ. Biden helped Obama with White voters. Bush 2 had help from his VP. Going back to Lincoln. Andrew Johnson helped him win the South. Usually they make little difference but not always. No LBJ. No JFK.
I’m not bullying you. Do what you want. I’m just saying that if you’re a U.S. citizen who has the ability to vote for Joe Biden in the 2020 general election and willingly chooses not to, fuck you.
Trump is terrible. Fuck you if you still won’t vote for Biden.
Steve Hilton warns Trump campaign is 'sleepwalking into a Biden presidency': 'Wake Up'  #FoxNews
Not trying to be sacrilegious, but as Joe Biden say 'You know the thing'!
I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my mom in March. I know Joe Biden is utterly incapable of managing any crisis, so he will have subordinates standing in. Which doctors would he rely on? Should he rely on the WHO? They are complicit in the world pandemic.
If either of them are Biden’s  VP, Trump will be re-elected
I voted for Hillary after Wasserman Schultz assisted in the cheating of Bernie.  This year,after Bernie dropped out, I committed to voting straight Republicans entire ballot. And I sent Jen in Florida running against Wasserman Schultz money instead of Biden.
SpaceX and NASA successfully return space ship and astronauts to earth. Joe Biden still lost in space.
Biden could pick Jesus Christ as his VP and it doesn’t matter. He himself voted against the working class for 40 years.  He himself voted to cut social security. He himself is a rapist. He himself got his moron kid a million dollar a year scam from Ukraine.  Hell no to Joe
I agree.  Im not afaraid of trump burning this corrupt corporate system to the ground.                                      Biden is also a Republican so neither one are worth voting for.  Another 4 more years of trump is what the DNC deserves for this Biden bullshit
I like Trump more than Biden.  Trump fucks off most days doing nothing. Biden will be on point doing everything his corporate puppet masters order him to daily.  Plus Biden spent 40 years in office voting with GOP. I’ll pass.
That is not fair.  Biden sucks.  Shall we count the times he voted against the working class over his 40 years in office?  Voting to cut Medicare is the reason I am voting trump myself.  Terrible nomination. Good luck though.
Rather biden that crying baby Donald
I can’t afford a Republican like Biden in office.  Trump may completely destroy Wall Street, Big Banking..... this clown could collapse everything!!!  I’d ❤️ to see him burn down this disgusting corporate welfare system.
I’m voting for trump.  I may have my entire ballot blood red until 2024.  Biden’s 40 year voting record is the reason.  Vote against me, f you.
She was drunk and still loved Biden
No ti think that would be you Joe Biden! The Democrats have you going through the montions to be President! But in reality they know you are not well man and sending out their even once in while from your basement is all this country needs to know it be you that alter our Nation!
using #fear &amp; scare tactics saying will b more #rioting under  ... REALLY? Maybe take a chance on #Biden because this all happened on Trump's watch! People r done w/Trump's dividing #UnitedStates w/#HateSpeech &amp; #Propaganda! #Biden2020  #YesWeCanAgain
Just watched an hour long Biden infomercial!  Oh... wait... its
Is Clyburn, signaling it’s ok for Biden to choose a non black VP? Trial balloon?
More people need to abstain from voting, especially in this upcoming election. Voting is a system that supports mob rule and it doesn’t matter if you vote for Trump or Biden. Both of them are evil old men trying to take our rights away.
So you’re endorsing Biden! Cool! Because you’re destroying this Democracy with your bullshit Fascism and wannabe dicctatorship. This is one Veteran that will fight you tooth and nail. My oath NEVER expired. Maybe try honoring you’re own oath. Oh wait, you know NOTHING of honor.
#KamalaHarrisForVP  I agree. She has the "it factor" that the ticket needs. Smart, funny, likeable. If we learned anything from 2016, women are held to a much higher standard (or Hillary would be President).
Joe Biden is a puppet as Hillary Clinton would have been had TRUMP not DEFEATED her. Do not fear my friends TRUMP will WIN WIN WIN 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I agree. Biden will be Biden. Whatever his corporate puppeteers want him to do he will.  No golf. No parties. Just instant obedience to corporate orders. At least trump sprinkles in 200 scandals to slow down corporate progress.
Why do progressives need to take to the street in millions?  You are sadly mistaken.  Biden is not worth missing 20 minutes of work to vote for him. We don’t care if he wins.  Those of you who want him better start organizing.  I see 2 republicans on the ballot. I hate both.
Bernie fans who cry like babies and stamp their feet as the walk away from Biden are (how shall I put this) Trump fans.  Quit your bitching and #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I don’t support Corporate Joe Biden. I don’t care who he picks for vp.
Anyone Biden  Chooses is far superior to the GOP VP.
In one of the stock market’s brief downward slides during its long march upward this summer, worries about the prospects of a Biden presidency began to dominate the chatter, and for seemingly solid reasons.
There is nothing...absolutely nothing Trump’s Crime Syndicate can claim about any Democrats that will persuade me not to vote for Biden.  In fact, vote Blue from top to the bottom of the ballot.
3. cont. if each told 10 people that is 3.2 million voters.  4. I care about the kids that nobody else cares about.  5.  Son of an immigrant. 6.  I am ready to support Biden if on the same Statewide ticket with him.
#Biden: I’ll debate #trump when he shows his #Trump-taxes
My guess is that who ever Biden chooses, will ultimately be President.
So I see Trump is officially campaigning for Biden now...
I envision all the Democratic candidates except for the Hawaii and love dust women plus a few more invitees sitting with Biden and debating who should take what post.They can pull straws if two people want the same job.  VP is tough-group votes for one from Biden’s short list?🍀
You don’t study politics. Rendell was a well known politician for years. He isn’t going to pick the VP. Biden will.
I haven’t anyone talking about the obvious shit show the transition will be, due to the rampant incompetence in the current administration. I’m ecstatic that Biden got the nomination, his experience should help.
Yeah I get that too.  Im either a Russian bot or a trump supporter. Who knew?  Biden absolutely sucks.
40,000 #WarrenDemocrats raised 1.5 million for Joe Biden today.
I’m getting so many texts from both parties (which is what happens when you’ve voted Republican AND Democrat over the course of nearly 20 some years). I wish “please stop texting me” worked. Trump’s party is very demanding via text. Biden’s side is more pleading, but polite.
Yes yes Biden equals socialism and communism poverty and violence and terrorism
Not true because Trump will be out of office. The truth is Trump is the reason for the protests. Biden will speak to the concerns of the people not send in troops to dominate like we're communist China.
Well, Biden's stated point-blank that it WILL be a woman, so they're just gonna have to deal with that regardless.  As for her "not being black enough"...Obama had a white mother and is relatively light-skinned, so that makes zero sense to me...but I'm a white dude, so (shrug)...
Another Biden nut case!
It’s going to be Nikki Haley. Trump’s campaign is circling the bowl and he’ll figure that selecting a woman of color will neutralize Biden’s advantage with women and minorities. Trump doesn’t need Pence, anyway. Trump already has the racist religious bigot vote locked up.
Check Biden’s website for detailed proposals. Have you heard any plans from Agent Orange about what he plans to do with his second term?
Biden wrote the tough on crime bill which created the mass incarceration situation. He also wrote the Patriot act. The war on drugs, as well as the drastic reduction in rights over the past 20 years, is a direct result of his legislature.
A little off topic I believe the trump rally’s Biden rally’s need to end along with protesting it’s just to dangerous with the pandemic going on to be doing that stuff trumps rally over a dozen people had tested positive
Trump may have a leg drop but he can complete sentences.  Biden in one rally last year forgot what office he was running for.  He shows signs of dementia he’s almost 80.
Biden might actually win.
Biden versus Trump. Some speculate that the future of the republic hinges on the outcome of the next election. But for smart investors it doesn't really matter who wins.
After 4 years of Biden’s tax cut republicans will want to end that. How do they convince voters a tax cut for them is a bad thing.  Who of you reading this couldn’t use 7500 a year fed tax cut?  How many middle class gop voters you know will vote 7509 away from themselves?
Folks.  I have been extremely critical of Biden for months.  I will not disrespect this page or it’s mission.  I have an Idea that would almost assure Democrats control all 3 branches of government for 50 years.  I want to try it out on this page to see what your think
46th President Joseph R Biden  Nov. 3rd can’t come fast enough!!! Your inauguration is where America will finally get a full nights sleep again!!! #Biden2020 #BlueWave2020TakeOver #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS #BidenLandslide2020 Love You Sir!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼♥️♥️
President Biden I don’t expect you’d have time anyway since you’ll be busy cleaning up the ENORMOUS mess the current idiot &amp; his minions have made!! Love you Sir!! We the People are here with you, standing by you, &amp; supporting you through &amp; through because we know you will do IT!
But Biden is definitely the lesser of the 2 evils and we have to pick one if we pick none we risk trump winnin
I admit Obama care needed reforming as it wasn’t fair for certain individuals but Obama saved the country most Americans aren’t educated enough but research quantum easing Biden is the lesser of the 2 evils he’s the best hope we can have believe me I much rather feel the bern
I mean yes the dnc fucked him over but Obama personally called and asked Bernie to drop out cause we need to unite against a common cause and if you listen to any of bernies words at any rally’s he started with each rally it’s not about me winning or Biden it’s about taking down
As Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden continues to gain support, wealthy taxpayers should consider taking advantage of the current estate and gift tax exemptions before it’s too late. Learn more:  #TaxAdvisors
Too late to find a better candidate so you rather the suffering continue with trump? With this belief you might as well change your bio to “I’ll be supporting trump cause im sure as hell not supporting Biden”
You’re not a democrat if you vote for trump if you do and think your a democrat you’re not educated trump is too far right to have any democratic beliefs Biden is a moderate democrat in the middle which means he will have republicans and democrats on his side good luck
Im voting for Biden I refuse to let my children suffer with Donald trump as president. Global warming isn’t a myth people are all over the streets of Michigan holding help me signs with their kids 5 6 years old no help from the president only tax cuts its time to end this shit
I wanted Bernie so bad I went to all his rally’s when I heard Obama asked Bernie to step down I was so mad but now it’s time to put others before myself we can’t allow trump to win and not voting for Biden will pave the way for Donald trump
The people who don’t vote for Biden will condemn many others to death suffering standing on corners begging for food and shelter cause trump and republicans wanna cut their income if you aren’t gonna vote for yourself think of those suffering biden wasn’t my first pick either
This is all cute and all, but Biden is going to destroy him in the gen.
More lies.
I can see this coming Nov 4th!  Trump declares he is still acting president forcing his rule even  after losing to Biden.   Trump will declare Biden’s presidency as illegitimate and urge new elections!!! Country will fray at the seams.  Who agrees?
Sep 15 - on the first presidential debate Trump will completely destroy Biden  Oct - Democrats will release some Nasty video from Trump's past  Poll numbers will show landslide victory for Biden  Nov 3 - Trump will win all the battleground States&amp; we will see a meltdown on TV😉🤞🏼
The argument against Harris is that she was a terrible primary candidate, did no homework on health care, CA is not a swing state and Senate Democrats have been absolutely useless in pandemic.  Biden needs a virus fighter like Whitmer of MI.
Would love to read an interview with a voter who's still sitting on the fence at this point and hinging his or her vote on Biden's VP pick.
That is exactly why Biden was a Corporate puppet for 50 years.  He sucks at many things but grass routes fund raising is top of the list. He does and votes exactly how the corporate puppet masters order him to. Then they pay his re-election bills for screwing the working class.
Joe Biden has his work cut out for him in 2021
Biden will undo this on day one.
Also, the best way for Harris *to* position herself for another run at POTUS would be to DO EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO ENSURE BIDEN'S AGENDA IS SUCCESSFUL.  Undermining him behind the scenes isn't gonna make her look good, it'll just make it more likely that a Republican wins in 2024.
All he needs is a harmonica
They take him around like they just picked him up from the COVID senior citizen home #Biden #elderlycare #Pedowood #election
LOL. No Biden will not do that.  Please don’t tell me that you think your supporters are so stupid as to believe these lies. How disrespectful you are. What they should believe is: #TrumpDeathCount150000 #TrumpPandemicFailure
Don’t stop for one minute. Work for Biden like he is 10 points down. We have to bury the orange menace.
This echoes Biden levels of racism. Likening poor people to non-whites. Race was not relevant here until you brought it up.
How come no presidential candidate offers a solution to reduce our addiction to cars? Biden's proposed support for EVs sounds enviro-friendly, but doesn't deal with traffic congestion or pedestrian/bicycle safety. Trump wants us all driving Buicks from the 50s.
Does that mean we should accept 26K dying/yr? Of course not. That's why the House passed ACA 2.0. That's why Biden's plan would be ACA 2.0 + a robust PO. Maybe it'll get through, maybe not. Hopefully we can cut it down to, say, 10K/yr over the next four years.
I think it’ll be Kamala Harris or Susan Rice. Who do you think it will be? “Biden says he will pick running mate by end of next week” #vppick #vp #JoeBiden #Biden2020
You haven’t read Biden’s plan, nor have you read the ACA 2.0 bill just passed by the House, have you?
They don’t want a hearing they want a linching mob. That is a dictatorship or communism, we tell you what it is you don’t have a say in anything we are the dukes and dutches. A view of the inside of the World Order, if Biden becomes president.when Biden or the Media say that u didn’t take things serious during the 1st few months I were listening to your experts who were getting flawed data from China and WHO - when u discovered that data was a lie u acted accordingly
When are Biden's handlers going to finally pick his running mate for him?
Joe Biden doesn't act like he knows more than the health experts. Trump ignores the health experts which causes confusion. We need a president who doesn't think he's "a natural". #COVID19 #Coronavirus #JoeBiden #TrumpHoaxedAmerica
Detroit is Riding With Biden!
Fat Drunk and Liberal is no Way to run a State.   Prediction: when Biden announces his VP pick (not Whitmer) she will open everything up.   She is a Vindictive Hyperpartisan.   Top 5 Worst Governor.
I have to give it to the Biden campaign, every few days i start to slowly talk myself into maybe considering giving some thought to possibly voting for him they do or announce some new thing that returns me to the correct path
So you rail on Biden's morality but then decide Trumps morality doesn't matter  #HYPOCRITE  #CNN
If you think Biden is as bad as Trump &amp; Decide Not To vote, then Trumps Brainwashing is working.  SMH
Let's keep our footing on solid ground. Biden is not perfect, probably no white person is when it comes to representing blacks. However, Biden is much better than Trump.
Buttigieg needs to be in the Biden Administration. Maybe Chasten too in place of DeVos!    #VoteTrumpOut
Trump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible'
‘Shameful’: Biden slams Trump for saying he would ‘hurt God’ if elected
No truth in Donalds world. I hope Joe Bidens lawyers sue Donald for defamation of character &amp; harassment. #SueTrump  #VoteJoeBiden2020 #VoteJoeBidenToSaveAmerica    Trump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible' | TheHill
Donald 🤡 will say anything to draw attention away from the virus. Joe Biden is a devout catholic who has never held a bible up for a photo op. #VoteTrumpOut   Trump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible' | TheHill
No. That’s what Biden is saying.
Yeah well that last minute b.s. worked for you against Clinton didn't it?  So now you're gonna try and use the same play against Biden - it won't work this time Mr. Thigh land. #TrumpIsALaughingStock
I believe that Rep. Dingell, like her late husband DOES care. Joe Biden? Not so sure about that.
Rice for VP. Yates for AG. Perfect. Wow. Biden will have a winning administration 🇺🇸🇺🇸#BidenVP
ask  +  to Debate over the 2 hours - Sean moderates one than Laura others or do it jointly. Format -Trump answers than Biden is on video screen answers in his own Primary words to same question. Do it before first Votes
What Biden said was moronic. And yet all you can do is attack someone else. Just typical fascist behavior by today’s left. I can easily admit trump is wrong about many things. Why can’t you just admit Biden is an idiot??
AOC better speak so she can urge young people who supported Bernie, to get out and vote for Biden!
Right there with you, Denise.. Susan would reestablish US lost stature on the world stage. 🇺🇸#VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #Biden2020 #Biden #vote
I don’t like calling people stupid, but the VP is just ONE cabinet position. It’s important yes, but any person choosing a Trump cabinet over a Biden cabinet is a straight up idiot and, at the very least imo, a fascist enabler.
Maybe she gets the state of mind Biden is in - country before party.
I didn’t know Biden was so powerful.
I honesty don't think Biden meant any harm.  He just doesn't know what he's doing anymore...and that's not meant to be a knock on him.  Unfortunately it happens to many of us as we get up there in age.
Then you’re not voting for Biden. Spare me.
The most comical part about Trump attacking Biden on his religion is the fact that the attacks are coming from a thrice married philandering thief who raped his first wife and laughed about a man bleeding out on the floor.
That Biden add really doesn’t use the language of the working class! Disgusting!   btw u need to read Hegel and Marx and Engels and Lenin and Hoxha and Mao and
Biden is the Saint of Killers CONFIRMED
45's statement is therefore coherent in a sense.  Since he believes the world revolves around him, believing himself to be god, Biden is, by definition, against god.
But NO Biden does mean never democrat
You really think a trump voter would vote for biden? Yikes
Vote Kamala Harris. Not Susan Rice she is tied too much to Benghazi even if not true it could cause Biden to lose the election
Someone’s pandering to Black voters, and it isn’t Biden.
Every time I see this person tweet I think it’s a secret Biden superpac
What about Biden vs. Jesus ?
Biden the Gaffe Machine
Biden should start his convention acceptance speech with a prayer. Send moderate Christians in a SPIRAL.
back to my comment on your latest column and not voting for Biden. You would be willing to put with this.
So you are uncomfortable with the direction Trump has/is taking the country yet you will write someone in instead of voting for Biden? You might as well vote for Trump, by noting voting for Biden you are giving the edge to the status quo
“No guns, no police and no grocery stores! In Biden’s America you will have to grow your own non-GMO/organic food. Plus no more free air. He will tax that like no one has ever taxed air before. Believe me!”
come on Bro. That is straight up Racist.   Why covering for Biden when it is so so so obvious?
Trump said Biden is going to take away God and guns....good! That’s one of many reasons why I’m voting for him.
Damn, Biden sounds incredible. He can hurt GOD?
Guys, Joe Biden is gonna use the black materia to summon meteor if he wins the presidency.
But will you help get him out by voting for Biden? Actually it’s not anyone’s business how people vote. I guess people want to know if you’ll be part of the solution or part of the problem.
So is Joe Biden gonna be part of the same strike team that plans on attacking and dethroning God or is he going to hurt God after the attacking and dethroning?
All good questions. I also heard that people didn't fill it out because Trump or Biden wasn't on it. Lots of voters are in the habit of ignoring primaries or misunderstanding them.
Joe Biden can't wait to find out who his running mate will be.
Yes. Detroit area. Some big ones, too. Mostly homemade.   The Biden people need to be giving away signs. NOW
“The Biden campaign surge in fundraising the past couple of months has helped it narrow the Trump campaign’s once-massive cash on hand advantage.”  Could have just thanked Black Lives Matter donations instead of general “Grassroots donors”, Joe.   I wish that $$ went to the ppl!
They are both nearly equally terrible, obviously Trump is worse for human rights. But they're both pedos and in Trumps case a definite rapist. Biden could be as well we just don't know yet. And Biden is a huge unknown, he could be worse than we even imagined if he wins.
Yeah, I totally get that get that. And Trump is definitely a worse person than Biden, my tweet was mostly just referring to the fact that IF we had Trump another 4 years at least we'd be done with him after that.
That's not how I feel, I was just making a statement. I definitely don't prefer Trump to Biden.............. And I wasn't 100% serious about the Bernie tweet. It's Twitter.......  I really have no idea what to do so don't judge based on two tweets.
These demonic DemocRATS are totally disgusting to our Nation and National Security. The Obama Cabal had their crosshairs aimed at Trump from the very beginning. And when he WON, it is OBVIOUS that this IS a Coup d'e'tat. No question. Because Trump WON. And Biden knew about it too
criminal and so unethical  ask Biden why was this allowed under your admin  and Planned Parenthood won't return monies from Govt - refusing - what is Biden's position
Biden can’t even complete sentence. 😂😂😂
Sadly, Biden is not is the same shape mentally that he was in. Something is going seriously wrong with Biden. As Americans, why can't we just pull together and not against anyone? #AmericansNeedToStandTogether
Joe Biden can't wait to find out who they pick to be his running mate!
Biden may not be the swiftest, but THIS guy should not make this election about mental acuity. Yikes.
Joe Biden's VP committee includes this guy and Chris Dodd, so there's that.
If you get the panel I would absolutely do a Jews for Biden panel discussion/fundraiser: “A shonda: my name and what I’m doing about it”
Susan Rice. Another great reason she’d be the perfect VP for Joe Biden. 🇺🇸 #SusanRice #BidenRice #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #ricktyler
Doesn't matter.  We should be debating the issues and beat him on that plus the great things that Trump has accomplished and can be reversed if Biden wins.
Not like I was going to vote for Biden anyway.
Republican operatives are pushing for Kanye to keep going so more votes are taken away from Biden. WAKE TF UP PEOPLE!!!!!!
We will on Nov 3rd when Biden is elected
problem described here isn’t minority rule. The problem is that one branch has become the All Powerful Oz.  Also, of course Trump shouldn’t care about the national vote. Neither should Biden. Had Hillary won it would’ve been minority rule too, just less spaced out geographically
You mean BIDEN is fighting DNA results in a rape case. Everyone forgot about the recent allegations against him. The press is SILENT.😔
You realize that this virus came from China not Mar-A-Lago or Trump towers... Your stupidity is not going to get Biden elected.
No accusations?  The intent of your posts is clearly to lead the reader to conclude Trump is a Pedo.  &amp; don’t put words into my mouth.  Never called Biden a pedo.  I said there is more basis in that one video to conclude Biden is a pedo than you guys have to say the same of Trump
That’s cool as long as you vote Biden!  Personally, I’ve always liked Sally Yates.
Harris is so charming. She’s also smarter than Biden
I love Corvettes. It is an American marvel and Joe Biden ain’t bad either.
We do. Joe Biden is a decent man who has spent 40 years of his life serving the nation. Trump is a crook who has spent just as long ripping people off.
You should do something about that then man. The difference could not be more clear! Trump is incompetent and puts his own personal profit ahead of our safety. Biden is neither of those. For that reason alone Trump must go.
For further proof of just how on-brand this is, look at how many Joe Biden + Corvette stories there are on
In 2016 Trump running opposed got about 480,000 votes Joe Biden, even with people still voting for Bernie Sanders who got 500,000 votes, just got over 800,000.
Our country faces many problems and Joe Biden isn't the answer to any of them.
Disappointed Biden uses the term "junkie." By telling people struggling with addiction that they're garbage we prevent so many from getting help and we obstruct badly needed policy changes. We need to look at addiction as a health crisis, not a personal failing. Do better, man.
Like the rest of us Joe Biden can't wait to find out who they pick as his running mate...
Their confidence that Kanye will take more Black voters from Biden than likes-voting-for-weird-celebrities voters from Trump is probably unfounded.
If Joe Biden were president, we wouldn't have to pay Elon Musk and Russia to take us to space.
Joe Biden can't wait to find out who they pick to be his running mate...
One more thing and then this is over.  There is more basis to claim Biden is a pedo in this vid than everything you and your Trump is a pedo cohorts have come up with in these tweets.
I think he should do it at the WH!    Joe Biden will no longer travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
Joe Biden is our modern day Weekend at Bernie's.
Joe Biden is our modern day Weekend At Bernie's.

Look say what you want about Biden, but most people, when asked if they need to take a test to prove that their brain works, would respond the same way. Trump's the only one who thinks the point of the test is to get extra points.
Bless his heart. At least Biden provides us some laughter...bittersweet...he may be a good man at heart..but his mind is just not up to the task....sad. #MAGA2020 #BidenNeedsToRetire #BidenIsPitiful #HowCanGoodPeopleSupportAbortion?
Prediction: Joe Biden will promise to reveal VP pick after he wins election.
As a Democrat we’re all worried about Biden. I voted for Bernie, but now Biden is gonna have to do. But the fact is, Trump is the worst we’ve ever had. It’s not just hyperbole when you hear someone say that “anyone is better than Trump”. That’s a fact.
Oh lord well then it’s a good thing Hunter Biden has never, in any way, held a government job.
Lmao because they know Trump would destroy Biden.
Joe Biden was most recently seen in public attending the funeral of Rep. John Lewis. Where was our(current) President while one of our Civil Rights heroes was laid to rest?
If we’re being real, fuck Biden, but at least he’s not the “it is what it is” guy.
Saw your interview on Axios! AKA: Joe Biden’s next campaign ad.
Well, #Democrat  has this going for him, the Revolutionary Communist Party has endorsed him  #tcot #gop #migop
Here we go, #Democrats already trying to "protect"  saying he shouldn't debate President   #tcot #gop #migop
Thank you, sir. 🇺🇸#biden #JoeBiden
That's Biden who doesn't know where he is.
But isn’t Biden going to be the nominee?  Doesn’t the public deserve to see him asked questions since he’ll be on the Presidential ballot?
Elizabeth Warren deserves to be Biden’s pick for VP. Period. 🇺🇸 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #elizabethwarren #DNC
Yeah his staff has to make all the announcements Biden can't keep things straight. This is probably why the positive covid-19 cases are on the rise in Texas. They are feeding America false statistical data to try to influence the voters in the state of Texas.
Honestly people love to claim Biden has dementia, but ignore Trump’s  complete lack of ability to form a cohesive thought, understand graphs or statistics at a 2nd grade level (see: axios interview) or even pronounce Yosemite correctly. Disclaimer: I’m also not a fan of Biden
Joe Biden has embraced the policies of the far-Left  Joe Biden will RAISE your taxes  Joe Biden will grant amnesty to 11 MILLION illegal immigrants  And, Joe Biden will KILL American jobs
Hurry, put him on the same anti-senile medication that joe Biden’s taken.
lol Biden only gives a fuck about money. Thinking he wouldn't make the same choices as Trump is delusional. And I said I'd ALMOST rather, because then he couldn't come back after the next 4 years are over. Again, let me explain before jumping to conclusions.
And you think Biden would be a better choice for any of that than Trump? I don't. The way I see it, our next president is going to fuck everything up no matter what. I think you misinterpreted my stance because Twitter doesn't really allow for me to fully elaborate on my view.
Can we get to the part where Biden wakes up in the shower and the entire Democratic Primary season was his dream?
So that's where Joe Biden is hanging out.
Everyone wonders who will be running the govt if Biden should -god forbid-win. If Susan Rice is VP, seems likely Obama will be pulling the strings. She was his go-to liar when needed. Heck, I always felt she acted like she had a crush on him-she'd do anything for BO!
Then-VP Joe Biden wrote a letter to an anonymous rape victim whose victim statement had gone viral for its eloquence. There was no reason to believe that she would later shed her anonymity and share this information.
All I’m hearing about is Trump or Biden blah blah blah. The only candidate that matters is sex man. Sex man for mayor bitches #kickinitoldschool
Me watching my friend in Italy’s insta stories (depicting a totally back-to-normal life and super fun summer) each day.   Please volunteer for Joe Biden.
Why would an endorsement signal a lack of trust?  Ridiculous.  You imagine postal workers will open mail, throw out Trump votes...and reseal and "count" Biden votes??
I think it's important to tune him out, to de-emphasize him. I believe in the Lincoln Project, and will vote for Biden.
Something needs to be done and NOW. Trump appointed post master general and they are hatching a devious plant to deny o/t, have layoffs thus slowing down and/or invalidate the election thru mail-in ballots. This is all over YouTube and Dems doing nothing-no Biden ads, no action.
yes and then play back Biden's own words that he used during the Primary -    should do this anyways - if Pres wants additional debates
So Cher when are you going to be going to Washington to be in President elect Joe Biden's Cabinet. I'm sure he can put in one of the cabinet seats.
biden doesn't need attack ads just air that interview
It really doesn't matter. It's all on Trump's watch. Good luck trying to convince voters that it'll get worse if Biden's elected. I can just see the ads. "I'm Don the Con. I've turned the U.S. into a cesspool and screwed the American people but if Joe's elected it'll be worse.
Someone in Biden's camp has mapped out a great campaign. Simply let Trump hang himself.
We all know why the Democrats and liberal news media are afraid to let Biden debate Trump.
36 years old, never voted. I hate  so much that I registered to vote and will be voting for Biden, simply to help get this dangerous, racist, sexist, idiotic MORON out of office. I can't belive my government would let the American people down the way they have.
Trump’s ratings will be high when they announce how bad he loses to Joe Biden!
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  i think he's right...
Joe Biden is not the answer to any known question.
I feel sorry for you if you have faith in Biden 🤣 dude can't even remember he's running
Honestly at this point, Biden is just as bad. I'd almost rather have Trump another 4 years then be done with his ass, then hopefully Biden doesn't try to run again. Jorgenson sucks ass too. We're just fucked no matter what.
If Biden rolled into the White House in a wheelchair and fell asleep for 8 years he still wouldn't do as much damage as Trump has done in 4 years.
The real magic of this hell map is Biden getting a PA call early on and cable shows spending 3 hours talking about it being over, "especially if AZ is as a close as it appears"
Biden can't wait to find out who he picked to be his running mate...
"He's clean and articulate" - Joe Biden
No leadership by Trump caused this. Vote for Joe Biden!
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Yes indeed! Michigan vote for Joe Biden!
If you want to be optimistic, this map is also the funny President Biden, Vice President Pence map
Think what ya want but if u have the chance please dont let ur children around Biden.
No they didn't, go further away from Detroit...further north the more Trump signs you will see! I haven't see one Biden sign at all
Please read this!

Have seen more signs for Joe Biden than I ever did for Hillary Clinton and it's still very few.   The Biden campaign should be giving out yard signs everywhere. It's heartening and encouraging to see other Blue voters putting it out there.   That is what creates enthusiasm.
Ryan blocked me a while ago for calling him out for his ridiculous attacks on Biden... and I voted for Sanders earlier this year when he was still in the race for the nomination.
Jason, you said it! Biden 2020. 🇺🇸 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Keep them coming and focus on the Task Force plans from Bernie/Biden teams and emphasize Biden plans to have govt control everything and zoning of suburbs
Do more Townhalls, do video debates with yourself and than a video screen where Biden responds as he did through the Primary to questions
Thanks +rest of Media especially biased Wallace/Neil/Bret - who were MIA w the Huge Scandal of a pattern of Spying by Obamagate,O/Biden for 8 yrs - spied on Merkel, spied on All Americans/Clapper lied about it; spied on AP, Rosen/Family so whey surprised he spied on Oppo campaign
Looks promising...but the only poll that counts is the one taken on election day.  The only thing I'm sure of is that Joe Biden is not the person to look to when trying to fix any problem whatsoever.
Watch “Rashida Tlaib Refuses To Endorse Joe Biden” on YouTube
Why do we need New material when the old stuff is so accurate and effective? Projection. Your cult leader uses it every day. "If Biden gets elected there'll be rioting and chaos" while, there's rioting and chaos. At least Biden won't kill off 155,000 people for Obama's economy.
... bold prediction (perhaps woefully wrong) perhaps extremely hopeful- Michelle Obama is gonna be the Democratic ace in the hole and announced as Biden’s pick for VP to energize the ticket, and base at the Dem convention in 15 days. I know it’s wishful thinking, but it’s 2020.
All I'm sure of is that Joe Biden isn't the answer to any problem the country is currently grappling with.
If we do not vote for vice president Joe Biden for presidency in 2020 this can happen to us again.... #VoteBidenToSaveAmericaPlease.
I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my mom in March. I know Joe Biden is utterly incapable of managing any crisis, so he will have subordinates standing in. Which doctors would he rely on? Should he rely on the WHO? They are complicit in the world pandemic.
If either of them are Biden’s  VP, Trump will be re-elected
They know that they're gonna have their ass handed to em in November so they're just practicing and getting warmed up for when Biden is elected. The only time they give a rats ass about the debt and deficit is when a dem is in office. That's the only time they're conservative.
Ultimately this is why “looking forward and not back” was the biggest mistake of the Obama era. The Biden era must be different.
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Rather biden that crying baby Donald
Pathetic this includes CNN lite  and  Wallace missed this + missed the huge scandals of Obama/Biden pattern of spying throughout 8 yrs w the Scandal of spying on Oppo party Wallace Bret read   articles&gt; thanks to
That is because the Democrat/Marxist party's only hope of winning the election is to make sure that business remains destroyed - caused by COVID-19. And to make the public believe it is all  fault. No amount of Monday morning quarterbacking will save China Joe Biden.
Repubelicons using projection is just another day that ends in y. Biden's never been accused of racism, while your Nazi  leader has a history of being a racist his entire life. Even now, whites storming state capitals are Patriots while black peaceful demonstrators are thugs.
Watch “Trump: Joe Biden’s A Secret Radical Leftist…” on YouTube 😂🤣😭. I wish
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's rights...
I’ll probably see Bigfoot before I see a Joe Biden yard sign.
The way things are going in Minneapolis, Biden Might win in North Carolina and lose in Minnesota. The people who are happiest with his support of BLM are those who don't get to see BLM.
I still see people saying D’s and R’s are essentially the same, but I don’t remember Clinton or Obama engaging a secret police on Americans, and I certainly don’t remember seeing that on Biden’s platform.
Nope. Too full of herself. Couldn’t possibly adjust to a number two spot.  #Biden
Get Howard Dean back as Chairman of the DNC. I’ve asking for months. He is a tough guy and a true leader. 🇺🇸 #DNC #biden
Biden was literally just at John Lewis’ funeral. Where was Trump? (not that he would have been welcome anyways)
“Trump is terrible but he controls women’s bodies so I prefer him to Biden”
I’m sorry but I’ve learned as a once pro life Catholic that Donald Trump’s pro life movement really is about controlling women and people overall. I’m sorry but I’ll be voting for Mr. Biden.
Ofcourse, their goal is the entire destruction of the U.S.A.'s Laws, foundation, borders, and religion with Biden as the pupit dictator until replaced. Voter fraud will be a tool used by these Marxist, and covered up by the media.
2/3 AG Barr/Durham must interview Obama, Biden etc and indict both of them as well as Hillary- by the way what did Donna B/Harf/GTurner know about it - ask them on air and others that are Contributors on Fox that worked for O/B admin
Obama/Biden's admin was known for, during 8 years, Spying! First Clapper lied to Congress where we found out O/B were spying on all Americans; spied on AP, Rosen/Family; Spied on Congressional Committees; spied on Germany's Merkel - had to apologize; 1/2
More people need to abstain from voting, especially in this upcoming election. Voting is a system that supports mob rule and it doesn’t matter if you vote for Trump or Biden. Both of them are evil old men trying to take our rights away.
I don’t agree with you on this Tim. First of all Joe Biden would have never thought of doing such a nasty thing, let alone approve it. Democrats have been above board in their dealings with the electorate, they have compassion and they know they work for “the people of the USA.”
Joe Biden would say that he ain't really black.
We are taking our party back and clearing the streets of the liberal scum. Dont you worry. We will get back to normal when the biden cult morons are out of the race. Theyre almost as stupid as the bernie cult. Almost...
Not working, Matt. Nobody cares about Biden in his basement. In a few months he'll be at the White House measuring the drapes. Donnie will be picking out jumpsuits. Orange or striped. I'd say stripes. It'll make him look taller where orange will make him look like a fat pumpkin.
My mom and sister are die hard Republicans, it was great to hear them say trump was an ass and the worst president. They will not vote for him!  They said the didn't like Biden but he is the better choice of the two. I am smiling! :-)
Biden will win in a landslide election! Mr Vindman is a American hero for stepping up ! You are just another trumpy sucking trumps ego ! Your loyalty to America should out weigh your loyalty to this corrupt moron ! Btw , wear a mask ! 😷
Yes, all 20 of them. Pretty bad that even trump humpers aren't buying his bullshit anymore. They're all like "I can't believe i fell for this wack job. I knew he was nuckin futs but I didn't realize trump was psycopathic sociopath. Please vote for Biden".
We're the hypocrites, Connie? We're fear mongers? That's all the right has is fear. Have ya seen your dear leaders ads? If Biden's elected, it'll be anarchy. Says the president responsible for anarchy. You don't see anything hypocritical about that? Obviously not. Lemmings.
#KamalaHarrisForVP  I agree. She has the "it factor" that the ticket needs. Smart, funny, likeable. If we learned anything from 2016, women are held to a much higher standard (or Hillary would be President).Biden is backing our governor how about you back US the residents of Michigan
Old pickle puss Biden  Have it your way at Burger King! Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce; special orders don't upset us. All we ask is that you let us serve it your way...

Really????? You mean to say that the  ONLY difference between Trump and Biden that matters to you is who Biden picks as his VP?  Sheesh.
Posted an anti-Trump thought tonight. Had someone "enlighten" me that Joe Biden is being controlled by Satanists and pedophiles who want to undo Trump's help for Christians.   I respectfully disagreed. I was then told I was "beguiled by the devil."   So, how was your day?
Unless you’re part of the ruling class, the American government doesn’t care about you.  Joe Biden isn’t going to change this. Donald Trump isn’t going to change this. American electoralism as it stands isn’t going to change this.
I tend to agree for the most part, but I don't care that Biden is "old" so long as he is a democrat he has my vote and any other "D" I can vote for.  We have to get Trump and as many Republicans out in order to undo this nightmare.
People are irate because it shouldn’t matter who Biden picks as VP. A decent person can look at the two choices that we have - Trump or Biden - and choose Biden without hesitation, no matter what. Because Trump is NEVER an acceptable choice.
Joe Biden knows how to pronounce both Thailand and Yosemite. Just saying.
You're the enemy of the people. You need to go away. 2020 Biden
As soon as you get out of the office will be able to do that Biden 2020

Your in denial of reality. Biden's on a sinking ship , the Titanic.
Biden had one job until the election: stay inside and shut up
Oh thank goodness! Thanks, Pastor Dave for setting my mind at ease. I will sleep soundly tonight for sure. I sure hope Biden doesn't get elected, because poor god will be defenseless if we don't have guns to protect him with. #sarcasm
Our God is a puny god who can be hurt by Biden....is that how that song goes.
Biden is either very powerful or God is a puny god.
If Biden can hurt God, than God is weak or Biden is poweful like Yoda or Gandalf.
"Uhh... did Joe Biden just say that Black people are all the same". No, he said there were "notable exceptions".
She actually made a very good point. If Biden picks Harris then he will not lose any progressive voters but if he picks Rice he may loses some conservative voters.
He’s campaigning in Cleveland. Implicating Biden in his falsehoods. And can’t even correctly pronounce Thailand. Thigh land!!
Trump is obviously referring to Biden's training with Hattori Hanzo.
I don't know about the God thing... but Biden sure does want to take away some guns, and has made a big push for the green new deal... which would put 10's of thousands out of a job.  you know that though, but your job makes you a professional liar.
Don’t vote Biden plz
I know none of us want trump, but we can acknowledge that Biden is racist as hell too right?
Biden has Dementia. It's sad.
The idea that any of the corporate media calls account to power is a joke. Other than a few exceptions, most media scares people and only gives them a very small ideas to choose from. Why are they completely ignoring Jo Jorgensen? There are so many people sick of Trump and Biden.

I remember him doing that to Rudy, "Okay, Noun, verb, 9/11."  Methinks Biden saw something none of us knew until much later.
My only problem with this statement is that Biden is going to decimate Trump. I cannot imagine that any single VP option on Biden's list won't do the same to Pence.
jk vote for biden, but i love you gretch
Joe Biden is perfectly capable &amp; trustworthy with the Nuclear Football.

Love it.  Contribute to help Biden buy even more ads.
Yeah I get that Biden is a little off. But I like him better than Trump...plain and simple.
Why do they push “Kanye” agenda? He actually make people vote for Biden
Happy Birthday Barack, We miss you would you consider Vice President to Biden
NO! I wish people would quit even suggesting it! Trump is no longer an unknown he has a political record and Biden is smarter. Debate and switch.  Go Biden
If she passes the Biden smell test
Although I believe Biden will need at least the $377 to sanitize the West Wing of all bugs and listening devices when he wins, you  have got to be kidding with the rest of the pork you added to the House Bill.
We're going to try because you destroyed it so hopefully Biden will in 2020
Do you honestly believe she’d vote for Trump?!? Of course she’d vote for Biden.  Only an ignoramus would vote for Trump.
Roses are Red Violets are Blue Biden is communist Red and Trump is Patriot Blue
Biden should be in jail for black mailing Ukraine over the firing of prosecutor in exchange for of release of funding then later on camera Biden is caught bragging about how he held up the funding until they fired the prosecutor.
If Biden decides to debate trump. Biden should bring all the girls and women he attacked and called them names.
My neighborhood in MIchigan has 13 Biden signs, 11 BLM and 2 Trump.  We’re surrounded but still fighting.
B all day long. Racism and nationalism is not American. Biden kneeled in front of peaceful protestors to say " I hear you, I care". Your dad threw pepper spray at them. I want a leader that leads in decency, not scream hate.
Good. In MI the Biden campaign has added to their ad buys which is the best strategy. I just have deep concerns with  strategy based on past elections. They've a history of premature victory laps &amp; belief that good will win out without encouragement.
of time &amp; resource they're ignoring current problems the people are facing. Lastly they will claim we dont dont go after political enemies in a democracy. The messaging to mute that noise is simply pointing out the Biden admin wouldn't be doing if the members of the GOP had... 6/
next monster could be. They need to proactively destroy the  clearly predictable feigned outrage &amp; attacks claiming Biden is out for revenge not justice. They'll throw fits saying it's wasting taxpayer money going after people no longer in power. Crying it's a waste... 5/

taxes will go up to 70 % if Biden is elected
big surprise no !!!!! USA will become more like socialist South America if Biden  is elected
Who will pass the Biden smell test ?
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
Sorry, can't get behind Biden because he is clearly diminished. The man was VP for 8 years and does not have a single great thing he accomplished to hang his hat on. Blue could win this election easily if they could come up with a good candidate instead they run retreads.
Who will pass Basement Joe Biden's smell test for VP ?
Lol mandates end Nov. 5th conveniently 😂😂 all Biden supporters don’t care because they think it helps their votes.
A Biden victory in November followed by a “War on Christmas™️” in December? Pass the egg nog!
He deserves that fate. The Biden admin must break w the "sin eating" &amp; forgiveness tradition. The 45 admin prevented oversight so their scandals, criminality &amp; corruption needs to be held accountable including prosecutions as a result. Nixon not facing consequences led to 45.
Joe Biden would be accused of child abuse if he had to talk to the mental incapacitated president. Biden would use big words that the man child would not understand. The the Republican Party can cry fowl for using big words
Biden withheld money from Ukraine lmao. Some people just use whatever they hear against Trump even if it's not against him lol
#DearMichigan Please DONT vote for Joe Biden!! He is mentally unstable for office.
Warren is Great But too far to the left (which is fine with me) But Biden cannot afford the socialist and communistic ads that would follow with her False advertisements with only part of things she's said in public America will be like Cuba or China and Russia for instance
It's life or death for this country and the world. If Biden gets in, he will be immediately removed because he's incompetent and Pelosi will figure out how to take over. Then communism isn't far behind.
It's funny. I talk to the people I know who voted for Bernie. They won't vote for Biden at ALL. I'm like, "You know that's a vote for Trump right?" They go off on me.  But I get shit because I am voting for Biden. I'm not progressive, or smart enough, or helping people... WTF.
I will tell you where Joe Biden is on this, he’s part of the problem and his silence condones the behavior.
Get back to me when Trump is leading by 6+ points statewide in MN. Then we can talk about 70-30 in NW MN. Right now though, Biden's outperforming Clinton by quite a bit in the state, and there's no reason to think MN07 would be an exception. Trump will win it, but not by 40.
Biden in his current mental state, may nominate Minnie Mouse for VP.
Friend or Foe?1! Monday Night Raw: Ghislaine Maxwell and Chrissy Teigen facing up against Eric Trump and Hunter Biden
Trump's not going to win MN07 by 40 lol. Not while a poll shows him down 7 in MN01 and not while Biden is winning by near or over 10 points statewide
Yes, make America Great Again by voting for Biden.
I would never donate to joe Biden’s campaign. He will never earn my vote. He is by no way qualified to run our country. President Trump is doing a fabulous job. Donald Trump rules. I can’t even imagine Joe Biden attending a closed board meeting surrounded by world leaders.
It will restore our democracy. The Republican Party has attempted to overthrow our democracy for years. President Biden will procecute all who allowed tRump to run a corruption of our laws. This includes pompeo and his ilk.
Are you kidding. Vote for trump if you don't like Biden.Biden will bring this country back to civility. Trump has done wrong by every race except for his base the white supremacists
You need to give it a rest. He was investigated and they found nothing wrong. Your just upset your losing to Joe Biden. He will be our next President
And yet Trump is the only reason vote for Biden. Odd.
not endorsing Biden is an endorsement for Trump. She will not be getting my vote.

You have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about. My kids are pissed about a lot of things right and believe me they know what’s right. They will vote for Biden.
That means Biden will be president, not you. I’ll take my chances.

That’s really funny you say that, since Obama was the president, Joe Biden was the Vice President and Hillary Clinton won the popular vote when she ran against trump. Idiot

I have no comment on that, and if we are using an allegation as a reason to not focus on the wars. What about Tara Reade against Biden. I have no interest in playing politics. There are tons of things I disagree with Tucker on, but at least he talks about the wars.
Excellent point.  He is sick.  Needs help.  And his trashing Biden is getting tiring.
Yea except most of that Biden is exuding and way more older than Donald 😊
Chef Blaser....if you need to blame Trump for this so you can sleep better at night, then that's your issue.  But to blame one person for every Covid death in the country is nothing short of foolish.  Biden or anyone else wouldn't have done any better either.
I guess it’s time for the polls to flip Trumps turn to fundraise then the polls will flip back and Biden can make $$$
mail-in voting &amp; absentee voting are the same. Quit trying to put fear/hate into this country. We're not safe in a Trump America. This country right now is filled with hate &amp; violence because of you. Stop trying to say it's going to happen when Biden is president

Hey. Don't be supporting dopey Joe Biden. You seem not to realize that the majority of your followers are Trump supporters.
Are you serious? I know #covid19 is contagious but I guess so is the Trump family stupidity. 100% of parents want there kids in school just not at all costs. 2nd so Joe Biden's opinion should not influence parents but your opinion should? That's spectacular ignorance &amp; hypocrisy.
Biden wants to be elected so he can move from his basement (root cellar)  to the much roomier White House Bunker
It doesn't matter constitutionally. His current term ends on January 20th. In contesting the election, he risks that a timely decision will not be made. That puts him out on Jan.20. Not Biden or Trump, it will be #PresidentPelosi
I talked to a customer today, and they were hardcore Biden fans. They were talking trash about the wall being built. I told them that the wall protects a lot of children being human trafficked. They told me so what?! That’s not the worst problem our country faced.. it’s trump 😂
And  I am hoping Biden &amp; Harris will be in :-) ♥
I think you need to #1 take a look around, YOU ARE NOT DOING YOUR JOB. You can't assess anyone else, you cannot even do YOUR JOB! You cannot even manage a crisis SO BIDEN has to do it for you!
You bet, "make American great again" because it was great until you got in the White House, now we have a mess and Biden WILL make it GREAT ♥

No need to worry sweetie, it won't be a close election. 3% means nothing when Biden is getting 90% of the votes.
He’s shook. That’s why he’s talking about mail in voting. They know that’s Biden’s only chance of winning.
That’s some funny shit... vote for Biden. Dying! 😂😂😂😂😂
Biden, without a doubt.
hey Biden, operation warp speed, sounds like a plan. This contradicts your assertion that there is no plan to distribute the vaccine when it is available. ( 7/29/20 speech )
Funny how the truth can be revealed inadvertently.

Biden will have donkeys pulling cars by next year if he is elect our good union friends will help him get elected and will put the auto companies out of work
What were sick and tired of is you. Day-in and day-out non-stop. Your mouth and your finger from tweeting. I'm over it Biden 2020
Trump is the one using DHS as his own personal police force INSIDE THE COUNTRY on American Citizens, jackass.  Also, yes, Biden did write the crime bill. He regrets it.  Though what party is supported by the KKK, Nazis, and White Supremacists in this country? OH RIGHT. GOP.
Huh? I'm not pushing deep state. I'm pushing that neither Biden nor Trump is the answer to our countries problems and voting for one just because you hate the other is a bad choice
Curious as to what you think happens when Biden takes office. Please tell me more

What's going on in Democratic cities and states is what America can expect in a Biden run America. Because this madness will spread if you Dems win in America. Then in that scenario it would be Biden's America ,only America will be lost if Biden wins.That's why we must vote Trump“Biden said the current trade deal is "unenforceable," and "full of vague, weak, and recycled commitments from Beijing”   Ask farmers in Michigan, they’re getting crushed by Trumps failing trade policies.

Beth just convinced me to vote Biden. Thread is on my profile.  That's why I stay left - because we create real conversations instead of propaganda.  All the "resist" folks who lionize anti-Trump right wing like Rick Wilson, Lincoln Project, even GW Bush &amp; John Bolton? Wrong Way!
I have mornings like that, too. Your thread inspired me this morning and I am keeping my head up.  Biden can slow Trump's damage - but these 4 years have made it *absolutely necessary* for a constitutional amendment.  Please consider 21st Century Bill of Rights!
Very Important Thread. Beth gets real!  Berners can help get Biden elected. But don't stop there!  We, The Left, *must* get Dems to help us amend the constitution with a 21st Century Bill of Rights.  Follow  and DM if you want to help re-launch the project in 2021

I'm beyond appalled that my only real choice is a lowlife like Joe Biden.
Trump mocks Biden but he doesn't know where states are or their capitals. Pronunciations are a consistent problem for words he probably he has rarely used. Regular dope.
Bernie signs are all over Lansing, Michigan. Including hand-painted murals and signs.  Tbh though, as a delivery driver - there are quite a few Biden signs now, too. Depends on the neighborhood though!

I would’ve said that he won’t appoint conservative judges— until the DNC decided to host John Kasich, so who knows 🤦😂  Although imo the one thing Biden has going for him is a $2T climate plan- it’s no Green New Deal, but it’s better than Trump selling parks to big oil

She promises to deliver MI-13 to Joe Biden in November. Okay, but since Hillary Clinton took 79% of the vote from that district in 2016, that’s like me promising to deliver up something called heat from the Sun.
Not hard to see why Whitmer remains popular. Her message is simple and consistent: making hard decisions to keep us safe. Republican attacks on her this week were something about a Zoom press conference, something about Biden defunding police, oh and btw she’s a dictator
Joe Biden has a long history of racist comments and legislative actions towards African Americans. It's who he is. It's what democrats have always been. Don't let them pander their way to your vote.

I think it’s even stranger considering Biden is a practicing Catholic and Trump has yet to attend any regular services.
This being said, nothing is going to change my mind about voting for Biden, so maybe this sort of position factors into their decision making process.
Can the Biden campaign really be this tone-deaf? I'm in Michigan and think Gov. Whitmer is great, but they have really let the expectation of a WOC grow. Again, I love Whitmer, but I'd be disappointed because I have preferences among the WOC who are rumored to be in the running.
we should maybe check into this Biden character.. I mean, I don't like the idea of him getting a holy deity into the figure four or coming off the top rope with a clothesline.. ya know?  I can't get behind that.
Yesterday the Trump adminstration literally photoshopped Biden praying at Church to look like he was mentally and physically exhausted.  The only 2 tactics Trump has against Biden is to try and make others think he's against God and has dementia ("Sleepy" Biden). That's legit it.

A Hitler reference. How original. Why don't you get on here and tell everyone why they should vote for Biden. You can't, because he's a lousy candidate and this is the best you've got.

Joe Biden can't spell cognitive
Thousands of Trump signs everywhere in Michigan, and small amounts of Biden signs. The incredible thing is all the yards with local Democrats, and Trump signs. Never seen anything like it since Ronald Reagan.
My question is to all the Democrats out there, if it's proven that this whole thing with Russia was a hoax perpetrated by the Democrat party members such as Obama, Biden  etc. Will you all still support the democrats in 2020? If you do, you are the problem.
Watch the magic on November 3rd, its going to make 2016 look like a joke. The Democrats have made themselves look so stupid to their base. Stop watching the polls, he's just getting started. Imagine if he debates Libertarian Jorgensen, Because Basement Biden bails on the debates?
Some of us have to go out and do our job anyway. Nice for Biden that he gets to hide in his basement, but that isn't possible for a lot of people.
Any VP under Biden will be the "alpha" within a year. We all see this in Biden.
Idk how much I trust the road if Biden is on it
Bernie is not going to be the President. Ever. Either Trump or Biden are going to be President. One of them is actively undoing every gain we have made. The other is not Captain Planet, but he believes in science, and is willing to put money into Green businesses and solutions.
I KNOW that Trump isn't going to do anything for the environment except more harm. Biden may not have perfect environmental policy, but no one running for President right now does. The best candidate for the environment dropped out early. Also, elections aren't beauty pageants.

I've bothered the hell out of Obama-Biden and Stabenow since 2008 over Made in the USA!  Now that Obama and Biden are Wealthy beyond common sense belief, Joe Biden has the former Balls to Air TV Commercials pushing Made in the USA? This 1's 4 U Joe: BS💩!
Since bumbling Biden will hand the whole Administration over to the far-left Socialists you will be much more depressed when all of your property is seized when your taxes go up to 90% And when you have no voice in government any longer
Will #LincolnVoters actually be able to pull the lever on Biden when it comes time to vote? It's easy say yes on August 5, but a much more difficult task in November.
Hey, Jonathan, will the press please point out that Biden has always had a stutter, always.
“Why the hell will I take a test?!“ “If he can’t figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion...!” I LOVE JOE BIDEN! America, you better be ready for some cussing when Biden &amp; Trump debate because I WANT Joe to cuss-out this buffoon! It’s a long time coming!

Thank you  for explaining to  why #JoeBiden will accept the Dem nomination from his home! It’s called using wisdom! We’d rather have a healthy Biden when it’s time to take over from the criminal in the WH! It doesn’t damage his campaign!

I say get Libertarian  to Debate  in place of  . Have Jo Jorgensen appeal to the Democrats as Joe Biden wants to hide in his basement.  I would do all the Debates this way. Even bring in the green party for  supporters.
Are the Biden's in some sort of trouble Mr Mitchell?
Biden is acting really weird in this video.

No way in bloody hell I will vote for Biden have you lost your damn mind
Because they think Kanye supporters detract from Biden and not Trump? Says a lot about them I guess....
The funniest thing, about this election if you can call it funny, is that before the covid quarantining and mass hysteria going on, the presidential election looked like it would be a toss up if it was Biden/Trump.
Trump will mop the floor with Biden and Biden won't last 30 minutes before he walks off the stage against Trump..
It’s so dumb, I don’t have the energy to find it. Biden in 87 arguing with someone about intelligence.
If Mr. Biden still has a brain - a very debatable subject at this point - it would likely have to become  a distinguished veteran and mother.

Who do you think Joe Biden will choose as his running mate?
If that’s the case has he said this?  At least Biden hs talked about his stutter/disfluency.   For some reason I feel like tRump wouldn’t admit that.
Tell the honest truth  You are so right! The media has the bar so low on this racist, criminal President that if he just shows up for a debate against Biden they’d find a way to say he won it! Double standards!
This is why the debates concern me. Rather than acknowledge facts, 45 just resorts to talking over the reporter. It's going to be the same with Biden and the moderators at the debates. And that is concerning. How can you debate someone who doesn't acknowledge basic facts?
if this were Joe Biden, the mainstream media would have a psychiatrist on every one of their mind-numbing chat shows tonight analyzing if he should be committed to a facility.  But because it's Trump, they're like, "meh..".  Disgusting.
Don't people believe that Barack Obama will be choosing Biden's VP?  Why do YOU think Obama Officially Endorsed Joe Biden, because he still has a fully operating Brain? 🤔🤔
If some people, like you, want to play the game of "hey you conservatives, defund doesn't literally mean......." then you  don't get to play the game of "well Biden didn't literally say defund the police".
How can we expect Biden to stand face to face with world leaders and fight for America when we won’t even stand face to face with Trump and fight for himself?  Joe Biden is a coward

And Joe Biden is allegedly supposed to be worried about debating this guy!? This an absolute mess.
Anyone who says “but Biden isn’t all there” just slap yourself. Then pause and slap yourself again.
Thousands and thousands?? Must have missed those crowds..... maybe a couple hundred in Florida.... and why would u see Biden supporters ANYWHERE close to you?
Michigander voting for Biden - can’t wait for November 3rd!
except if you insinuate that Joe Biden is Not Good, then you’re a heretic who must be excommunicated from the Church of the Democrats
Ok look you fake ass Caravaggio: I'm not saying there are no accusers. unlike Biden, I haven't heard any actual names of people accusing him. So I have a blind spot. YOURE the one threatening to beat up a woman who just talks shit and has no systematic power. YOU aren't well
I'll walk through hell fire with gasoline drawers to vote for Biden.
And how is it that BIDEN is even allowed to run for President?!

As a Michigander, yes, we need to get the fascist out.  But I’m not going to fake enthusiasm for Biden.  This rah rah blue stuff is delusional, we do not want to go back to what was...a classist, racist, screw working and poor people society.  Vote progressive!! #DearMichigan
This Michigander is waiting in anticipation to vote for President Joe Biden!  #46! I went to Cape Henlopen 5 years ago and my sister and I were commenting that there was a lot of Biden influence there.  A random guy came up to us and said "that is because he is a good guy."
There's one less Fraudulent Vote for Biden.
Why would their be Biden supporters at your rallies you doofus
like ah yes, $15 minimum wage, climate change action seeking, student loan debt forgiveness, immigration reform democrat joe biden is basically the same as build a wall fascist orange golf man
i hate the two party system but in the same vein if u try to say that biden and trump are at all similar than you haven't read any of Biden's policy proposals/goals and I will not take you seriously
Joe Biden is waiting for Barack Obama to TELL him who is VP Choice is. You didn't know?  🤫🤫
Jr.  Are you sitting down? What they're saying is that your dad has done such an atrocious job in handling the virus, protesting, etc that there's really no upside in Biden debating him. If an opponent is willing to lie repeatedly why debate them?

If I am Joe Biden, my pick is Sen. Duckworth. She does a lot for the ticket. Probably wouldn't be a bad President either. Wants to increase military spending. Pro gun control surprisingly. Disagrees with parental notification on abortion which may place a serious burden on
If you look at most of the democrats like joe biden, you would think that no change is possible so we might as well just do nothing and go back to the way it was before trump.  It was crappy before trump, btw.
The Fake News isn't PART of the Conspiracy to Overthrow YOU any more, Mr President, they're on Top!  These Felonious Slanderers are on some very thin Ice, handling Biden and his Leaders.  Stole the 2018 with their Lies!  Hang on Lawful Patriots!!!  🇺🇸⚖🇺🇸
Faster Biden dispatches the old guard the better.  Biden doesn't need a ”white guy whisperer.”  That's the appeal of Biden.
Makes me so angry! Especially these people who don’t like Trump or Biden. There is only one choice!
everyone who’s saying he’s part of the problem... you are the problem lol third party will not win it’s biden or trump, one is bad but the other is worse and it’s not even close
Biden, today is August 2 2020. August is in the summertime so it’s warm outside! I’m just trying to help you remember stuff. Remember breakfast, then lunch, then dinner.
Clinton and Biden have something to watch again
I don't get the excitement over Biden announcing his choice for running mate. I'm gonna vote for the guy regardless. Don't we have enough anxiety right now? #TrumpFailedAmerica
You go girl!!!!  I'd backpedal on my racist accusations towards Biden if it meant a possible VP spot for me too.  Sadly I'm melanin deficient so I don't have a shot anyhow.😔 #BestQualified #Bussing
I absolutely hate Joe Biden but we've got to stop this madness you have to vote.
He's getting closer but he's not quite there yet.
After Biden announces his VP that’s going to change
Biden is terrible but I’ll be voting for him (by mail). Lesser of 2 evils. But I don’t consider myself a democrat. If Biden was running against almost anyone else I’d vote republican.
Interesting. I live in a town that survives on the union jobs of GM from the 1950s-present. Trump was the first Republican to win Bay County in nearly 40 years. The amount of Biden signs here surpasses the amount of Obama signs in 2008 and the amount of Clinton signs in 2016.
Absolutely voting Biden! Cannot debate a person with multiple personalities, a con and a liar.
They have only a handful of campaign  up in Michigan, Trump signs out-number Biden signs 10-1. Its really strange.
I love how Biden and Obama bombed  10x the countries trump has and deported 5x the amount people trump has yet half the countries still like “ohh he likes basketball, he’s for the people”  🤡🤡🤡
There are just so many video clips of Biden and his (former) views... Time for POTUS T to campaign and reveal his flip-flopping on the issues that matter 🧐 It’s time to take off the gloves ‼️

More ppl died from Ebola then covid. You just lied swept it under the rug and didn’t have anyone tested. You know Biden is unfit to be president. Why don’t you just come out and say it?
Whether you vote or not, you’re going to get one of the two: Biden or trump. Doesn’t matter if you don’t like either one, doesn’t matter if you dislike both. You are going to get one or the other. There is no third option! So you are going to let others choose for you???
VP Biden makes his pick this week and I believe it's going to be Susan Rice.
Yes Sir Senator, Joe Biden IS Soft on China . . . . . as they share a bed
Because they don't have anything else to hype Biden with.
Biden and company lost this one when they ignored &amp; suppressed information about voter suppression during the primary.  Now, the GOP can suppress votes in November - and Dems and their allies don't have any way to stop them. Good luck with that mess!
Congratulations, Democrats, thanks to you and Biden, we are now living in the plot to Lion in the winter. I hope you're happy!
So did Biden pick a VP yet or naw?
The most calming period of this process has been the "alright Joe let's see if you fuck this up" stage while Dems scream loudly that no fuck up should screw this up while also knifing other factions with how big of a fuck up it would be if Biden were to shift power elsewhere.
This upcoming election is proof that the NAME means more than the opinions. Trump got in office on his name &amp; scare tactics Biden got the DNC only bc he was linked to Obama &amp; they needed someone with some brand recognition  I’d rather have Kasich or Rubio vs Bernie for God’s Sake
Biden told reporters this week that he would “have a choice in the first week of August.”
Can you imagine how comfortable Obama must have been after Selecting Joe Biden as his VP?   Do you think your Secret Service Cohorts realized that Obama could get away with Anything with Biden's lack of common sense and Integrity  🤔🤔

Yes, but it’s more likely that trump will refuse to debate Biden...
PLEASE Dr. Biden, advise Joe to swamp computer media w VIRTUAL ADS. Ask the Lincoln Project to help pay! Young voting Americans are into their electronics &amp; don’t watch evening news, CNN or FOX!  Trump is much more successful at this &amp; has the money!!
MEN LET’S NOT F*CK THIS UP!!!  IF U HARBOR ANY MISOGYNISTIC TENDENCIES, PLEASE RETREAT TO AND REMAIN IN YOUR ‘MAN CAVE’.  OTHERWISE, WHEN THE BIDEN VP SELECTION IS ANNOUNCED please CELEBRATE, CONTRIBUTE, VOLUNTEER, AND VOTE FOR TEAM BIDEN!!!  Remember 2016...no repeat.
Yeah. I can virtually guarantee that the Biden campaign wasn’t doing this, especially as their senior staff was railing on the group that was.
I agree and I'm not blaming Biden. Perhaps the original poster does. I'm not sure. I do wish he'd make a decision, however.  The social media campaign to 'help him pick' wasn't necessary. Hopefully Facebook isn't his advisor.
If you’re watching 1,000 people die every day from a mismanaged pandemic response and still “losing enthusiasm” for Biden, maybe your problem isn’t the VP choice
Tbh, the focused tear down of our women leaders is nothing new. It’s not even worse. It’s just more obvious. The things Trump and the GOP says about Whitmer now, top level Dems said in early 2017 up until they couldn’t get someone to run against her. To blame Biden is 🙄.
Why wouldn't Biden choose a full blown Perceived Communist like I see her,  🙄
As I reflect this is an amazing point Lisa. I am so inured to being torn down myself and just being like “onward” - and I am in a position of relative privilege. Biden has signaled he intends to amplify some BIPOC voices and the frenzy around that has been... awful.
You do realize that Michelle Obama will be the democratic Nominee. Biden as lost his mind will drop out the race. Dems will pick who ever they want and they will pick her.
This infuriates me. Obama didn’t announce his VP until mid August. This is twitter getting worked up, not a plan by Biden.   This feels performative. Grow up.
Ok, but that doesn't make it any better.  Lazy and sup par work ethic are pretty much in the same category.  I said all black democratic voters.  Because that is what you said, at least all biden voters.  And the majority of black voters voted for biden.
You said: "It seems to me if your young and have a good work ethic you wouldn’t vote biden."  How else can someone take that?  You called every biden voter, who is young, lazy.
how many other people are positive with how familiar Donald Trump was with Jeffery Epstein that he had his way with a kid? Dont worry biden surely had his entanglements with epstein. Just saying we deserve better than that as a country.
Yes Joe Biden, buy American Made Products!  That's until you and the Cult get that Green New Deal to sell our Economy AGAIN? 🤣  I'VE heard that U.S. Leaders can make $Billions kissing the CCP's ass.  More if they can snatch U.S. Foreign Aid too?
Conservatives: Biden lost his mind and is unfit. His latest gaffe he called Arizona a city  Meanwhile Trump: I beat Obama 4 years ago...  Dude how tf did you forget who you ran against? You're whole campaign was based around discrediting and attacking her
Susan Rice should be the VP Pick unless Obama scares Biden's Handler into choosing Michelle Obama.  Who could get knocked down faster, right with those Conspirators to Overthrow the President than One of THEM, the Princess of Benghazi? No choice
lying about what a Biden Presidency would be like with law enforcement behind him! It’s another signal to police to attack peaceful protesters and “not be so nice” to them. He’s a domestic terrorist. He wants everyone attacking each other. He’s the devil!
Joe Biden asked to comment:  "2020 could have been A LOT worse."
Same as Joe Biden's.
Former Vice President Joe Biden has won the general election endorsement of the Michigan People's Campaign, a progressive group that backed Bernie Sanders in the primary:
Trump’s absence in the summer comes as a series of polls show Biden leading in Michigan. Trump's organizers in told me this doesn't mean they are pulling out. In fact, they're making big investments in the ground operation.
I’m a mom, and I’m for Biden. Go away
Trump’s absence in the summer comes as a series of polls show Biden leading in Michigan. The Trump campaign reportedly canceled its national ad program in order to review its messaging strategy.  However, Trump reserved $11.4M in TV ads from September through Nov. 3.
Presidential campaigns and PACs supporting them spent $52M to reserve television ads in Michigan, according to data shared by    Trump and Biden already spent more on TV ads in Michigan than the candidates in 2016.
. says  will make significant investments to make affordable housing more available for Black Americans. Gilchrist said Biden's plan will benefit people in Detroit, Benton Harbor and "people of color across the state of Michigan."
You can make fun of mentally challenged people all you want but a lot of people are voting for Biden only because trump is such a huge threat to democracy.
Maybe your husband has contracted to same Virus attitude that I have?  I'd rather die of COVID-19 than watch the Biden-Obama Cult and their "Squad-infested" #NewLeft take control of our National Security, including Internal Security.  Sad but true 4 me; had enough B💩
The more closely Biden’s record is examined, the more ‘problematic’ it becomes for the Dem machine 🧐🐲🧐
The more closely Biden’s record is examined, the more ‘problematic’ it becomes for the Dem machine 🧐🐲🧐
You perfectly described trump there. Whereas Biden’s donors tell him what to believe not people on the left. Biden is going to be another standard corporate democrat just like Obama and Hillary.
Well 1. Biden isn’t a boomer. He’s older.  And 2. I edit. Say anything political. I have an example of someone near Biden’s age that also figured it out.
Trump figured it out and he’s not as smart as Biden. I’m sure he will be fine.
All jokes aside, this is one of the things about a Joe Biden presidency that I am actually excited about
I love that all these Republication PAC commercials are really just projection.  They're like "Hey, Joe Biden lied once, 30 years ago. He _exaggerated_. Clearly not presidential material."  Meanwhile  on twitter yelling about mescaline and healing crystals.
Yall keep talking about Biden in the basement like we forgot #BunkerBabyTrump hid then lied about it.
It’s cute you think Biden is a leftist. I pegged him more as a moderate Republican myself. Especially how he agrees with a majority of Trump’s policies.
My goal is to remove Trump's 1000 judges via constitutional amendment. And of course many other elements as you are aware.   will still continue under Biden. My worry is that momentum will slow. Not that there's any now. More people are becoming ready, though.
In the first six months of the Biden Administration.
Kamala/Biden is a Republican ticket. That is two Republicans on a ticket.  Seeing what Dems have done since 2008 has made me realize that America has two factions of a fundamentally conservative party.  GOP are right-wing reactionary. Dems are centrist/conservative.
96 days. Fight like Biden is behind. Crush Trump. Humiliate Trump. #EvictTrump
Yes, but  is in the top ten for worst Governors. Trump signs in Michigan outnumber Biden 8-1 state wide. She a 1 term Governor, voted in only because legalization of Marijuana was on the ballot, so she was voted in by pot heads!  We know they won't vote the next round.
We are starting to see who will be advising  due to his current status. Obama will be in the background trying to reinstall all his job killing policies. If Biden wins, I'm going to laugh at all of you who voted for him as you lose your jobs. Trump 2020!
Not sure if this is a subtweet of the other thread going on, but regardless, who is claiming that Biden's plan does not include the substantive influence of GND?  I think we can celebrate the clear influence of GND without saying that Biden's plan = GND in its totality
If we're looking not at the GND resolution, but the broader discourse and academic work that has developed around the GND, one could identify other missing links from Biden's plan too. I limited my list here to the resoWhen are Biden's handlers going to finally pick his running mate for him?
I’m fully convinced Joe Biden is DEFINITELY NOT in charge of this account
Biden has no toilet in the basement. He ran out of TP forcing him to go in the backyard! His handlers counted 14 brown or yellow spots in the grass. C’mon man you using coke too? I’m not CRAZY
Joe Biden -  "What you all know but most people dont know unlike the African/American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community"  Took 25 words for him to say   "You're all the same"
I'm not a huge fan of Biden, but he didn't get near as much negativity 4 years ago when he wasn't running for president. A lot of the shit spreading around him seems like an effort from others who benefit from him seeming like a bad person.

Its simple if Biden were to actually do the work to earn our voted show leftists that he supports and plans to push/ fight for progressive policies not pander and show that he does want to move left shit would be different he would get those voters.
87% of Democrats Support 'Medicare for All,' Though Joe Biden Doesn't
These people could easily not do the work for Biden make demands instead fight the DNC call them the fuck out and call Biden the fuck and not make themselves look clownish but nope.
Im sorry but I am kind of in shock seeing these people who are like the voices of the progressive movement just go along with Biden and the DNC.
Seeing all these progressives just going along with this Biden isn’t it but we just gotta do it in order to get Trump where the fuck is the fight in that where are the demands you all are just falling in line and giving Biden a pass you all aren’t even holding his feet to the 🔥
Saying that we must vote for Biden all while he continues to reject progressive policies and then say this shit this gives us a sense of false hope say you do fall in line and vote for Biden he is just magically going to move to the left after he has rejected the left.
Nah fuck that shit I reject Biden.
The article should be called a left wing group falls in line and does the work for Biden.  Like seriously how can anybody be progressive and go along with this shit.
I don’t like calling people stupid, but the VP is just ONE cabinet position. It’s important yes, but any person choosing a Trump cabinet over a Biden cabinet is a straight up idiot and, at the very least imo, a fascist enabler.
I honesty don't think Biden meant any harm.  He just doesn't know what he's doing anymore...and that's not meant to be a knock on him.  Unfortunately it happens to many of us as we get up there in age.
Why I Joe Biden running? To avoid Hunter and himself from getting in trouble. China!!!

By attacking Joe Biden for his Catholic faith.Donald Trump has shown himself,for the hateful,divisive   Bigot,that he is .
Someone’s pandering to Black voters, and it isn’t Biden.
Maybe  should be on Biden’s short list for VP.
Donald Trump disparages Biden’s school records,while hiding his academic ,”accomplishments” from sight.
What about Biden vs. Jesus ?
No he completely changed the story. It was going after the NRA bc of fraud, nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment. He stated that and than dragged in more fake news about Biden. Intelligent people read that actually is happening instead of believing people who make up stuff.
You know if they really wanted Biden to debate Trump they would at least do some kind of Zoom Debate.
Seeing Biden talk about the latino community is really something he basically says nothing just we got to embrace the latino community we got to stop seperating families we got to include them okay but what exactly are you going to do to help the latino community are you going to
Biden seriously needs to just say what exactly he is going to do what are his plans this vague shit in his videos isn’t good enough.
Guys, Joe Biden is gonna use the black materia to summon meteor if he wins the presidency.
Biden is not going to move to the left. Did anybody even see his current ad where he is driving fancy ass car I mean seriously anybody that believes that Biden is going to move to the left is seriously naive if anything he will pander a little.
Don’t talk about supporting progressive policies when your there falling in line telling others to do the same and saying that Biden is moveable and that next cycle we can maybe have the candidate of our choice really?
I mean I don’t get how this is the right thing to do wait around till next cycle to get Biden out instead of making demands I don’t get their whole shit strategy.
Are excluded from the conversation. Biden wouldn’t even support Medicare for All or Student Loan Cancellation? Oh but we all just have to deal with it like always wait around for Biden to do what exactly save the ACA go back to the Obama times slow changes and half measures.
Trump is evil and shit but give us some sign that shit is going to change and that voters are being listened to cause as I see it right now Biden wins but what exactly is going to change for all of us who are out here barely making ends meet cause so far the poor/working class
Im sorry you all can go along with this shit I voted for Hillary in 2016 after being treated like shit by her supporters and there was never an apology from her or calls for her to call out her supporters. Now here we are doing this again but with Biden but instead Biden has
Honestly in the Settle with Biden and this Vote Trump Out shit bothers me why are progressives doing the work for him when he and his campaign should be doing the work.
They say that Biden is moveable when did he support progressive policies?
This bothers me. Basically the left falls in line again instead of demanding that Biden earn peoples votes. I live in Michigan and will be voting green and shaming those that vote green is  not it.
Yeah, Biden is a complete mess.
Joe Biden can't wait to find out who his running mate will be.
Sorry but Biden his campaign and the Dems are clowns if they wanted leftists/progressives to vote for them they would do better if they wanted unity they would not continue to talk shit about the left or do everything to stop progressive candidates and policies from winning
Posting Fuck Donald Trump isn’t stopping that fucking nightmarish piece of shit there needs to be a plan to hold his ass accountable I am not seeing any of these settle with Biden people talking about they just believe that if we get him out shit is just going to stop being
Im sorry but this is not Biden doing the work. Has Biden even talked at all about defunding/abolishing ICE and releasing the immigrant children at the detention centers???????
I don’t think anybody is advising him I think they are just letting him do whatever he wants. The campaign seems to not care their whole thing is we got to get Trump out vote for Biden cause he’s not Trump and that should be good enough it’s all very entitled and out of touch.
Where are the demands from these progressive orgs telling us to settle for Biden that Biden start doing the work to earn our vote. We can’t just wait around while shit gets worst that’s some real privileged shit to tell someone who is struggling oh just wait around for Biden
Im sorry but no. Progressives/leftists should not have to do the work for Biden he should be out there doing everything to earn their vote.
Im sorry but I will not be voting for Biden Vote Green. This whole wait till next cycle to get Biden out won’t cut it. Roots Nation should be demanding they replace him instead cause he is not it.
Joe Biden is trash
If your a resist pro Biden account or a Republican please don’t follow me. 🙏
We should all be demanding that they replace Biden with Bernie cause this clown isn’t it.
So vote Trump out by giving Biden the nomination even though he did not deserve it and then make demands after he is elected as if Biden as if he is going to do anything what is this shit.
should we settle every single one of these leftist orgs should be demanding that Biden do the fucking work and if he is not willing to do that then call them all the fuck out call the party out and demand they fucking replace him.
Biden won’t even debate or be at the convention. I hate Trump I think he is garbage but how is doing the work for Biden and his campaign going to push him to the left Biden keeps being given everything he also keeps getting free passes for barely doing nothing.
Seeing so called progressives literally doing the work for Biden while Biden does absolutely nothing really bothers me. If you all want leftists to vote for Biden then deman he do the work and step it the fuck up.
I will be voting green cause honestly fuck Biden and the DNC.
So let me get this straight you are going to be doing the work for Biden to get progressives to vote for him. Why is everybody doing this for Biden????
And I will not be supporting RootsAction.
I think they are so desperate to get a Democrat in office, they are overlooking A LOT of issues with Joe Biden.
These demonic DemocRATS are totally disgusting to our Nation and National Security. The Obama Cabal had their crosshairs aimed at Trump from the very beginning. And when he WON, it is OBVIOUS that this IS a Coup d'e'tat. No question. Because Trump WON. And Biden knew about it too
Biden can’t even complete sentence. 😂😂😂
At least don’t vote at all. You can’t really want Biden. 40yr career politician who’s never actually helped anyone but himself unless it was a coincidence. So crooked he can’t talk straight anymore &amp; There’s videos of him being “strange” w/kids. Trump’s gotten really bad press.
Sadly, Biden is not is the same shape mentally that he was in. Something is going seriously wrong with Biden. As Americans, why can't we just pull together and not against anyone? #AmericansNeedToStandTogether
Joe Biden can't wait to find out who they pick to be his running mate!
#letitrip President Trump is Losing Ground on his Presidential General Election. Biden will get the Advantage.
Not like I was going to vote for Biden anyway.
She’s the fucking worst. I’m on record, I’ve said what I said, I will not vote for a biden/Harris ticket.
You mean BIDEN is fighting DNA results in a rape case. Everyone forgot about the recent allegations against him. The press is SILENT.😔
We do. Joe Biden is a decent man who has spent 40 years of his life serving the nation. Trump is a crook who has spent just as long ripping people off.
You should do something about that then man. The difference could not be more clear! Trump is incompetent and puts his own personal profit ahead of our safety. Biden is neither of those. For that reason alone Trump must go.
They Endorsed Biden you Idiot
Our country faces many problems and Joe Biden isn't the answer to any of them.
Sounds like you won’t be voting for Biden then
Like the rest of us Joe Biden can't wait to find out who they pick as his running mate...

Joe Biden was most recently seen in public attending the funeral of Rep. John Lewis. Where was our(current) President while one of our Civil Rights heroes was laid to rest?
I was watching and listening to this. I can’t wait until this comes out. Also the Biden’s and the Ukraine.
Biden can’t handle Chris Wallace let alone a real reporter like Tucker. Of course the fake news wants a fake president to put on a show with.   Trump shoots from the hip with real bullets. We should appreciate how impressive that is instead of criticizing every time he misses.
Well, #Democrat  has this going for him, the Revolutionary Communist Party has endorsed him  #tcot #gop #migop
Here we go, #Democrats already trying to "protect"  saying he shouldn't debate President   #tcot #gop #migop
It's my understanding that Fox is not "news" but rather an entertainment channel so why would Biden waste his time?
Biden doesn’t resort to fairytales,like Trump does.Biden has not told tall tales about George Washington’s arevolutionary war Air Force,or the Bowling Green massacre.
He says Biden could have, but didn't. What took Trump so long? Just in time for election. Too little, too late.

On the bright side, Joe Biden may not have to spend a penny on ads. Just run the Axios interview on a repeating loop every day through Nov 3.
The GOP new catch phrase is “Judge Biden by the people he surrounds himself with.”  Like all the convicted felons in the Trump organizations?
I think it's important to tune him out, to de-emphasize him. I believe in the Lincoln Project, and will vote for Biden.
Work hard? Do tell us when does Trump work hard? He has done nothing about the pandemic, nothing in regards to protests except to call his own citizens anarchists, people who have lost their jobs, health care.... Nothing. Sure, go after Biden for not working hard. Gtfo
Should get a jammer in there just for fun, make it screech in his ear or start playing funny lines of Biden’s on repeat in his ear
It really doesn't matter. It's all on Trump's watch. Good luck trying to convince voters that it'll get worse if Biden's elected. I can just see the ads. "I'm Don the Con. I've turned the U.S. into a cesspool and screwed the American people but if Joe's elected it'll be worse.

Everything that came out of this guys mouth was that Biden was doing good in the polls and that it helped him to have Obama with him or whatever on those videos.
They had some guy from Bidens campaign this morning on MSNBC that campaign is garbage also they just think Biden is going to win cause he is Biden and because people hate Trump so basically they are just giving him the nomination without doing the work he is going to do very
I’ll probably see Bigfoot before I see a Joe Biden yard sign.
But Biden is just fine.  "These People Are Stupid"!
I still see people saying D’s and R’s are essentially the same, but I don’t remember Clinton or Obama engaging a secret police on Americans, and I certainly don’t remember seeing that on Biden’s platform.
Biden was literally just at John Lewis’ funeral. Where was Trump? (not that he would have been welcome anyways)
Joe Biden actually wants to pay off the deficit.Donald Trump just wants to keep spending.
Joe Biden’s health is obviously declining quickly. They are going to have to replace him. On the bright side it won’t be Hillary because her  husband is a pedophile.
Joe Biden was the bottom of the barrel. I imagine the VP pick will be too. 😂
But, but, but isn't Biden senile? Haven't heard that one bandied about in a while.
Not unlikely at all. Who’s going to the polls in masses? His supporters who think this is no big deal and listen to him about mail-in ballots. So yea, easy to see machines favoring him and then we are in for a shitstorm like you said if Biden pulls ahead a month later.Nobody is working harder at denigrating Joe Biden than Joe Biden.

I don't think Trump will debate Biden.
The other reason Democrats want Biden to shun debates
1) Hunter Biden isn’t running.  2) Unlike Trump, VP Biden has not practiced nepotism &amp; put unelected, unconfirmed, unqualified family members in top government roles.  3) Where are Trump’s tax returns?  4) Where are all the migrant kids you separated from families &amp; lost?
If Biden becomes President, he vows to ban all gas powered vehicles.  Instead, he’s giving everyone (illegal immigrants and convicted felons included) a flying car that runs on aluminum cans at NO CHARGE!  Also, he’ll make COVID illegal so everyone will be safe!
Idiot, Republicans are literally the only ones who think democrats don’t want a debate between Biden and Trump. Biden may stutter, but all Trump can do is lie.

So having Biden say that HE WOULD VETO M4A if Congress, representing the will of over 2 out of 3 citizens, AND VOTERS, pass it is just stupid policy and politics.
He’s trying to fix how badly he’s bungled the Census. Biden May need to do another one. These people are a joke.

In 2009 the unemployment rate was 9.9%.  In 2016 it was 4.7%, a reduction of over 50%.  During the last 3 years of Obama / Biden the US economy added more jobs than the first 3 years of Trump (even before the virus).
I have faith in the men and women of our military.  And I think it might be the Secret Service who would drag Trump out of the WH, part of their job in protecting Pres Biden.
Biden quote:  ““Mark my words I think he [Trump] is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held.”  Turley, you are an embarrassment.

WHO do they think will opt to vote for Kanye over Biden?
I must disagree with Speaker Pelosi on this.  When John McCain chose Palin, it was such a bad judgement call that I immediately dismissed McCain as a candidate.  However, these are not normal times.  Biden has my vote no matter his VP pick.

#DetroitToday First debate should be a match of "Words with Friends" and broadcast it live. T Carlson and A Cooper could be the commentators.  Tucker, "Biden used a word with Latin origin, he's hates America."  Anderson, "Trump responds with the word  'of'  STRONG word for him."
realDonaldTrump: After yesterday’s statement, Sleepy Joe Biden is no longer worthy of the Black Vote!
Basement Biden should speak EVERY DAY!!!
That’s funny; Biden talk? Even attempt to get his party leaders to negotiate? Really? They have negotiated since before Obama was president. Please!  is a puppet to “his” party. Stop being funny Hugh
Maybe they could play a match of "Words with Friends" and broadcast it live.  Tucker Carlson and Anderson Cooper could be the commentators.  Tucker, "Biden used a word with Latin origin, he's hates America."  Anderson, "Trump responds with the word  'of'  STRONG word for him."

realDonaldTrump: Just like Radical Left New York is trying to destroy the NRA, if Biden becomes President your GREAT SECOND AMENDMENT doesn’t have a chance. Your guns will be taken away, immediately and without notice. No police, no guns!
Actually  im disappointed that a Christian like yourself would resort to name calling, “Hidin Biden” ? Is that what you tell your children to do , make fun of others &amp; call them names ?

Kanye West indicates, in a Forbes interview via text, that he is in fact running to siphon votes from the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.  🖕🏽 Off  you mental sack of shit.
The goal is to not take away votes from Biden!
Totally agree! I would have thrown in the towel and dumped it all in Biden and Pelosi’s laps. He loves America too much. He is a natural leader! Besides, his ego would not allow him to do that. TRUMP 2020!!!
Biden is so racist he can’t even hide it when he knows he has to! That’s bad! Wow
Everything you said was true up until "we're gonna vote Trump in November." That last bit is just crazy. I get holding Biden's feet to the fire... But when has Trump given a smidge about Black Americans?
At this point, I'm more worried that Donald Trump has completely become unstable and unfit to serve the rest of the term.   Time to seriously consider the #25thAmendmentNow   He thinks Biden is going to hurt God. So I would support his sending children/teachers back to school.
I heard Biden is going to make ketchup illegal because it is RED, and the old Soviet Union has a red flag China has a red flag and the Republican party is red. What a bastard. I voting for Trump now.
if the right doesn’t agree with biden’s policies, idk why they keep calling them radical
I’m glad you understand the hypocricy. It’s okay to go after Biden for anything but when Trump sounds like a child it’s “award-winning journalism”. Your whatbaoutism is outstandingly stupid.
Wait I thought you wanted to court my vote, Donald. This only makes me want to vote for Biden even more, even if it is a complete lie.
Every time a Joe Biden video pops up on my TL I’m reminded that he is a legitimately bad candidate and that Democrats have just decided to go all in on the “well at least he isn’t Trump” concept. What a joke.

Joe Biden Hits Trump’s Biggest Boast With A Brutal Coronavirus Reality Check
You know what concerns me is people like  are so deep in their alternate reality, they will be completely blindsided by the actuality of a Biden victory. Despite the evidence to the contrary, they will say Democrats stole the election. I would bet money on it.
He’s an asshole but who else do I vote for??? Senile Biden.  U all had another Democrat option in Brenda Jones but went with the terrorist supporting antisemite.  🤷‍♂️
Just explained to my family that I can’t vote for trump or Biden because neither of them made Late Registration. Neither of them could make a record like Yeezus. My uncle asked me if I was on crack
Make it in America = Joe Biden  Manufacturing jobs = Joe Biden  How do I know this folks?   I’ve seen him do it with my own eyes. He’s done it once before and he is going to do it again!   Regrow, rebuild America.  That’s our Joe.

Hey trump team...I think it’s safe to say it’s time to put the “Biden is losing his marbles” bit in the trash....
BLM and Antifa rioting in Democrat Socialist controlled cities are receiving political cover from the Democrat Socialist mayors and governors. There are articles showing the DNC and Biden Campaign providing bail money and other funding.
When you look at the math the percentage of test to death rate was his point. Swan was making a different point. Can Joe Biden calculate this? It’s a legitimate question and should be asked hard questions. Good luck landing an interview.

Biden Panic Thread
Doesn’t matter.  There’s enough Trump haters for Biden to win unfortunately.
I really don’t understand why this is considered such a close race. Biden’s base includes young people who want to see socialism reign, or older people who just can’t stand Trump. The voting system is a joke. Biden is a puppet for the radical left. Is this what you want?
Even more of an incentive to elect Biden
Keep Joe Biden away from photo ops with tanks.

The argument against Harris is that she was a terrible primary candidate, did no homework on health care, CA is not a swing state and Senate Democrats have been absolutely useless in pandemic.  Biden needs a virus fighter like Whitmer of MI.

There is really no choice, I will be voting for Biden. I can’t handle another 4 years of Trump!
How come no presidential candidate offers a solution to reduce our addiction to cars? Biden's proposed support for EVs sounds enviro-friendly, but doesn't deal with traffic congestion or pedestrian/bicycle safety. Trump wants us all driving Buicks from the 50s.

EPIC/MRA POLL: Biden leading by 11 points over Trump in Michigan
We have to unite behind Joe Biden no matter who he picks as VP. The team will be so much better than what we have now!
Seems like they could have summarized this is "everyone except Russia" hopes Trump loses. If for no other reason than because Biden would be reasonable.
joe biden sexually harassed someone and you have a problem with this? gtfoh
Just wait til the news about trump being investigated or being indicted is released publicly. Trump wont have time to attack or spread lies about Biden, he will be busy with damage control.
So, Joe Biden's America will look like Trump's America?
9)We "elect Presidents, not pastors", but Joe Biden hates God so we shouldn't elect him.  10)Mexico didn't pay for a wall. The debt has grown exponentially. The trade deficit grew. Iran still has no nuclear deal. Obamacare hasn't changed. But Trump "kept all his promises!"
Everyone involved needs to PRAY then PAY for what they have done to America and Donald Trump. That includes you Joey Biden!
I think more importantly, Joe and Dr. Jill Biden live their beliefs. We can judge people's hearts only by how they treat others.

Anyways im tired of arguing with you bernie or busters. Y’all spend so much energy trying to convince me not to vote for Biden. Im just one dude. Convince them. Convince the American people not to vote for Joe. Vote for Trump if you have to
His plan would still cover more Americans than Trumps. Also Trump is presiding over the worst exonomic decline in our nations history since the great depression (+40mill) so im pretty sure Biden beats Trump on “trade” as well.
I would hop across the Sahara on one foot while eating saltines to vote Biden.
From the same polling firm that had Hillary up by double digits before the 2016 election. Doesn't say if they polled just anyone, or likely voters, and the article doesn't give the breakdown of Dems vs Reps polled, so it's worthless other than to make people believe Biden is up.

Biden supports a $15/hr minimum wage but I guess you’ll just chock that up as a fluke too. Uneducate yourself, please
I can totally see Biden calmly, carefully punching Donald in the face, if it came to that. And the world would be okay with that.
There is a pandemic. And apparently TikTok is the greatest threat to America now.  What the fuck else do you need, to see how fucking delusional Trump is? Maybe him saying Joe Biden can hurt God? Maybe him boasting about his lack of wall? How about helping dismantle the USPS?
And all Biden supports will act surprised when the stock market crashes even before Biden's inauguration and blame Trump

Biden is not worthy of any vote.
My dream is that Dems ditch Biden and nominate Andrew Cuomo, in a brokered Zoom convention.   For no other reason than watching  Maria  and  lip-synch the presidential debates would be the best thing ever.
Biden criticizes the black community for not being tolerant and diverse, and also says he is going to pick a black vice-president based on skin color and gender.  He is a classic white Democrat. Racist to his very core.
I am voting for Joe Biden but the fact it’s a vote against Trump is a welcome fringe benefit. Trump isn’t going to win. You underestimate just how hated he is. Democrats are not going to make the same mistakes of 2016. Hell even the GOP is abandoning him in droves.
But his bishop is a devout politician of the same stripe as Biden. Both worship at satans altar

Donald can definitely still win. But Calene, my dear friend, even though you’re voting Biden, let’s raise the bar.
For me getting Trump out and bullying Biden further left seems a lot less harmful than burning it all down. But hey to each their own
What exactly is your end goal here? Are you one of those Bernie or Bust accelerationists who thinks if we burn it all down we will make progress faster? What is it really? Politics takes time. Coalition building takes time. Biden can be pulled left but a fascist like Trump cant
He wont gas peaceful protestors he wont upend 230 protections for private content creators Biden will decriminalize marijuana and expunge nonviolent drug offenders, biden will end private prisons, do I need to go on or are you just going to go with “I’ll believe it when I see it”
I was a Bernie guy too but even I can see the importance of getting Trump out in November  This stupid wokescoldy nonsense of trying to out left each other is childish. Vote the fascist out and bully Biden to the left while he’s in office. Pretty fuggin simple
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
im going to launcugh my ass if kanye wins he wouldn't know what to do
After experiencing a “perfect” president, I’ll take an imperfect and willing to admit it #Biden any day.
It’s crazy that Republicans see Biden as far left or Socialist. The knock against Joe from many Democrats is he’s too moderate. Biden a Socialist. 🤣
I just saw a Trump commercial criticizing Biden for bragging about his IQ....Ironic much Don?
Hey there Biden tweet minion. How bout you try repeatedly hitting the center autofill button. It'll make just about as much sense.
Joe Biden...  -Officiated a gay 'wedding' -Supports the pro-LGBT 'Equality Act' -Wants to force the Little Sisters of the Poor to provide contraceptives -Stands 100% with Planned Parenthood  Yet we're suppose to beleive he's a 'devout' Catholic?
Who knew Biden could be so powerful.
But when Joe Biden said Trump hasn’t ever read the Bible how is this different? No factual base, one mans opinion.
Most of them is majority. Among my friends 100% have doubled down 😑 and I've never seen anyone say I voted third party this time I won't or I didn't vote last time I will this time. I just see a lot of if you vote for Biden your voting for the status quo that gave us Trump
Compare the candidates? There is no comparison. Biden is a man of integrity and intellect. Trump is an ignorant cesspool of hatred. We don’t need debates to highlight this even further.  But if you really want it...
Biden hates the Bible. Right......
This is why white guys hate talking about race, the conversation is a god damn mine field, say the wrong thing &amp; its the guillotine for you. There is nothing Biden can say thats on a par with Trump for bigotry.  We can litigate Biden or we can defeat trumpism.
Biden is for infanticide.
I hope God is ready for Biden. #hurt
The veneer on Biden slips all the time and he gets away with it every time. Not a single republican could get away with saying “poor kids are just as smart and talented as white kids”
President Biden should play this dementia clip of Donald trump at every event until the very day Biden is sworn in.
BREAKING: Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has chosen JonBenet Ramsey as his VP for the 2020 election.

Joe Biden did not write this tweet, he’s feeble and demented. You saw and heard the real Joe when he said the black community was not diverse!
Where are the crowds, holding Biden flags, and chanting "USA, USA?" 🤔
So when trump misspeaks it’s lack of intelligence when Biden does “people make mistakes” got it.
Again Biden is not perfect but he’s not a fucking fascist like Trump. Lets get the fascist out of the white house first and then we can bully Biden to the left all we want mkay??
Oh god not this again. Call me once Biden ignores science and kills hundreds of thousands of private citizens, or gasses peaceful protestors, or abducts and black bags Portlanders. Talk to me once Biden goes after 230 protections for indy content and threatens free speech.
She is crazy if she thinks it will fly. Just distracting from the point that biden can't debate.
Looks like many will be disappointed with Biden's VP pick. You know who won't be? The GOP. Because they can see that everyone will be pissed and crying. If you choose to take your ball home, because you didn't get your way, please go fuck yourself. This election is too important.
Its pretty simple dude:  People like Krystal Ball and Kyle Kulinski argue that Biden and Trump are the same on economic policy. Though this is true to a certain extent this is a class reductionist framing as it ignores all the racist social policies Trump will implement cometerm2
Do you think Kyle Kulinski doesn’t engage in class reductionist language? He spent months trying to convince his extremely white audience that Biden and Trump were the same. Are you joking? You made the claim class reductionism isn’t real and so far youve done nothing to defendit
Theyre gonna say Biden understands and sympathizes with the citizens grief and can lead the public to heal. Do they sympathize with the VULNERABLE ELDERLY and their families that this affected? BEFORE OR AFTER DEMS LOOKED FOR IMMUNITY ON PUTTING SICK PATIENTS IN WITH HEALTHY?
And I hear class reductionist say identity politics/race is a distraction all the time. Look at channels like KyleKulinski who monetize their white privilege by saying straight up asinine things like Biden = Trump. I agree Biden’s not perfect but to be so racist as to say they =?
…invest in environmental justice, protect the environment &amp; our national security, create jobs &amp; boost economic growth. Wyoming needs Joe Biden!
I try to stay out of politics on social media but how tf are there 330 million people in this country and the best options we could come up with for president are Trump and Biden. There HAS to be someone out there with a brain.
Wait until Biden says he sympathizes with the citizens and understands and can help them all heal. AFTER ALL THE DEMS GO FOR IMMUNITY AFTER PUTTING INFECTIOUS DISEASE PATIENTS IN WITH HOUSED VULNERABLE ELDERLY.
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?
Theyre trying to say Biden relates to the public because of grieving and that he could lead public to recovery.Time to show the public that Trump not only sympathized but took action. Trump lead the way healing America. Cold shoulder Biden &amp; his "C'mon man" doesnt scream sympathy
A debate with you will only increase Biden’s lead. You going down.
Joe Biden will hurt God?   Donald Trump already did that when he hijacked God's followers as his own.
Trump not even remotely rational. If Biden is president he’ll hurt the Bible and hurt God?! Gee, maybe you should pick up a Bible and read it and get a clue who God is. Gonna go out on a limb and say that no worldly leader can hurt God. Also, Biden is openly a believer 🤦🏼‍♀️
and you know biden will push defund the police.

1: this is a sound bite, did any of you watch the full video ?    2: Trump says, and has said 20 times worse, so as far as I'm concerned it's Biden or no one.    3: if you don't vote, you voted for Trump... Thankyou and have a good day.
Ask Joe Biden where it is and then ask him to say if he lied to Congress.
can we just start calling him "Woah Biden" yet
The NRA destroyed itself. The fascist right that it and you represent is crumbling. I will continue to own my gun responsibly, along with the pistols my grandfather took from Nazis during WWII. The only thing that will be taken away when Joe Biden wins is you. Good riddance.
No Joe Biden has to be lead around like a baby. Can not get his facts right.

The  choice is Clear but it is surprising how many people will cut their own nose off to spite their  face . The brainwashed liberal controlled Media continues to spout drivel about Trump and Ignore the Facts about Biden/Obama , Clinton , the Washington Swamp Cabal Pedos +more !
Who would EVER vote for Trump because Biden picked the wrong woman.  This is a tell on how loony SE Cupp is.
This is perfect for Biden
How good of a job Biden is doing,cleaning up tRump's mess and all the magaT's crying about the election being rigged.
We may see a weekend at Bernie's 3.0 as Biden's mental capacity degrades.
Joe Biden: ‘Unlike the African American Community ... the Latino Community Is an Incredibly Diverse Community‘  via
Catholic Joe Biden is exponentially more religious than Trump
Woah,Biden is more powerful and scarier than I thought. Will be getting a Biden yard sign asap to stay on his good side.
“...against energy...”  Biden is the first pro-entropy candidate and I am here for it.
Honestly Joe Biden throwing hands with the Lord would be pretty cool. Maybe it can be part of the Tyson card.
Remember back when we used to  actually wonder if Biden was fit for office - good times.  Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity  #FoxNews
Joe Biden unable to answer softball questions and media's silence is 'mind-blowing,' says Sarah Sanders #SmartNews
Revolutionary change can’t happen if we continue to vote in the “lesser evil” of the candidates. Joe Biden is a republican who doesn’t support M4A. He is openly racist and predatory. I don’t see a less evil candidate, I see two very evil rich white men with nothing to offer.
Any critics of the DNC and Biden platform are accused of being a Trump supporter.  It's a reflex at this point.  It's the "fake news" of the Dems.
Biden is a practicing Catholic. When was the last time Trump even went to Church?
I have been waiting a year for the Trump/Biden debates and now I’m pretty sure they won’t happen.
Biden has never done anything for the American People. It’s been about his own and his family’s enrichment while advancing the Leftist agenda.  He won’t start doing the right thing all of a sudden
...laying on the DNC floor while they gathered his scattered votes and handed them to Biden. Seeing that, was Yang, an almost unknown newbie, supposed to take on the whole Democrat establishment? Or find a way to work with or around it?
Democrats planted false stories in effort to derail Biden investigations, Grassley says #SmartNews
It looks like to me like if you are counter-establishment you are going to have to do some pro establishment things if you're going to get anything done at all. Yang endorsed Biden. What other choices did he have? Bernie looked like he was soon to be nothing but a burnt out....
It’s obvious she’s voting for Biden. Heaven help us all! 🙁
Joe Bigot Biden is a good nickname for him!
I'm not surprised by too much these days ,after all the stuff Biden has been involved in the past 30 years , why is anybody wondering about him choosing a Black Widow Spider for a running mate , or whoever ,whatever ?
So it sounds like Joe Biden’s knowledge of Hispanics is limited to those featured on TV the Californian Mexican, the New YorRican, and the Cuban.
Michigan pro-Trump Republicans say Biden’s police policies will push voters toward Trump
I don’t need to hear your babbling blather and bs to know I’m voting for Biden.
Great to see.  Slam the DNC though. Not just Biden, but continue exposing his weakness's..   Country needs to see Cities like Minneapolis, Portland, San Francisco, such chaos with refunding police . Older crowds hates that idea.. for sure to get votes.
um pretty sure people who are voting that early for Biden are NOT going to change their minds after 3.5 years of a disaster bc of one debate. 🤔
Does anyone believed we’ll see the Durham Report? If not presented before the election and Biden wins it will be buried so deep we’ll never know the truth. Why is it taking so long. Curious it stays in the background.
IMO Biden should announce a "team of rivals" cabinet
Showing your tax returns is a public service, if Biden can show his, you can show yours ! Or are you hiding something?
I could have told you that.  Even with all their cheating and interference, Biden will win.
trump called Ted Cruz wife ugly. He called Marco Rubio little Marco. trump gave out Lindsey Graham's phone number and all of them suck his ass now. Harris pointing out a fact to Biden hardly compares in the scheme of things.
CHEATER'S!!
Instagram insists 'bug' that negatively affected Joe Biden was 'not partisan'
Does this suggest they found someone else in the basement with Biden?
Biden can accept his nomination from his basement where he’s been holed up for months, but Trump can’t deliver his speech from where he’s spent the past three plus years? Are you guys insane - he’s the President, leave him alone and let him lead - what is everyone so afraid of?
You use the same talking points about biden and how he's so racist that everyone uses. That doesn't make you smart. It makes you lazy. Trump has been getting sued for discrimination at his apartments in the 90s where he did not want blacks living,  i could post a million articles
Beyond bizarre. Why did the Democrats select Biden from a field of so many better candidates? It is sad watching Joe's demise play out everytime he is on camera. He really isn't capable of being the president. .    Find a new candidate. .
No hoopla: Coronavirus upends Trump, Biden convention plans
That's real👌 Maybe they should do some polling in the mainland. Not that seeing the poll numbers from George Costanza Land / Bizarro Upside Down World isn't a great entertainment value. Building up Biden's chances, then bashing the lefties dreams will make for many yummy tears.
so that’s why you were so horrible to attny General Barr. You and your husband took $700,000 from Ukrainian thugs connected to Biden. Tiktok
My primary home is in SA TX ... and will fly/drive there to VOTE FOR BIDEN!!!!
You are crazy! No rational person would vote for #GroperJoeBiden. If you think President Trump did anything to hurt America, you are getting your information from the wrong place. Biden is the epitome of the corrupt DC establishment. He can't even complete a sentence.

Yeah yeah yea... And Joe Biden is fit to run the country... Keep saying that... One day you might convince yourself of it.  Until then, I, along with many others, suspect you of foul play.  As a software developer, you have the ULTIMATE access to everyone's wallet!
Biden has fewer millionairs contributing who want FAVORITISM LIKE THE DID WITH CRIMINAL TRUMP
Here's hoping we will be CELEBRATING a winning Biden landslide...I honestly thought 2016 was my Break the ceiling happy feeling...I was SO depressed and in disbelief that I will NEVER take it for granted until WE get the WIN...
Thinking Biden should being going to Minnesota,  Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona etc doing the open bus, not getting out but loud speaker, wave, throwing buttons and pin tour...
Biden is an idiot 😡
Biden thinks he's witty, but it's nothing but senseless drivel. Poor guy.
Sound Like Your A Biden Voter🐀 Good Luck Friend

#drunkben’s impression of Biden saying he doesn’t need a cognitive test is pretty epic
I'll say this much about Biden:  Love that he's a GM guy. Firebird and a 'Vette.
I would not get to carried away. I would agree this election will be the most important in all of our lives, but in my opinion, Biden is running his campaign smoothly and without too many "things" going on that Trump can try to smear on. Voting equality is my bigger priority.
Trump picked Pence on July 15, 2016 Hillary Clinton picked Kaine on July 22, 2016 Romney picked Ryan on August 11, 2012 McCain picked Palin on August 29, 2008 Obama picked Biden on August 23, 2008  Pretty average time line to me...
President Joe Biden. Question; you think he will show up for Biden being sworn in in Jan 2021?
You play the hand you are dealt.   And, keep in mind, it's not just a president but it is also the people that surround him.    Biden will have a great team.
Barr wouldn't stand for it. He would fire all of them to protect 45 from it! I hope Biden puts someone in that will investigate all the BS Barr has done!
But Biden is scared and cognitively impaired.
Biden is honestly pretty physically fit for his age
I think no matter what happens in November the right loses unless we coalesce and stand together. Trump/house/senate=left loses their minds even more. Biden wins we all lose.
Dr.Jill Biden PLEASE think Bigger Picture for the party and pick  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think the Republicans think their party is shot to hell and won't be held to account for anything anyway so it's a free for all like drunken sailors on shore leave, but they will have to sober up sometime and realize what they have done either with Biden or no democracy.
I don't even see the point of Biden debating him. After he crushes him, tRump will lie about what was said or who won, even with the whole world watching. That's what this 🤡 does. He lies about 💩 that is on tape for the whole world to see.
If you hate a politician so much that you are rooting against a vaccine, I fear for you.  If you love a politician so much that you won't wear a mask despite what doctors and scientists say, I fear for you.   Maybe try principles in place of politics.  EVERYONE. #Trump #Biden
If it was a Biden motorcade, you’d see Antifa flags flying.
Joe Biden loves dogs!
No debates at all until trump releases his tax returns!   He has gotten away with this for too long.   Release as many years of tax returns as Biden has and then they can discuss the debates.  Trump wants the debates because he wants the spotlight.
100% agree with this!   The entire party needs to push this though.   It won’t hurt Biden at all but it will drive trump crazy since he loves to be on stage.
Joe Biden is a blatant liar, or hes senile and doesn't remember. #TrumpLandslide2020
Trump, Biden, TV ad dollars and get out the vote: MLive political reporter talks Michigan as a battleground state
So if I vote 3rd party this year, am I voting for Trump, or am I voting for Biden? Which party making the claim has it right, and which party has it wrong?
Untrue, and illogical. 3rd party vote is 3rd party vote, no more, no less.  GOP: 3rd Party vote really a vote for Biden! Dems: 3rd Party vote really a vote for Trump!  They can't both be true. It's just a line both parties use to manipulate you into accepting the status quo.
Stop making shit up, i never said i support Trump but if i had to pick Biden or Trump then i would vote for Trump. We don't need the military, tell me a country that is showing an intent to attack us by coming at our direction?. You're brainwashed by the media.
Biden is a complete joke. No rational person would vote for Joe Biden.
Your terror is obvious and hilarious #DesperateDonny! Knowing you are going to get spanked by Biden,( sorry, not Stormy this time), which will allow SDNY to indict and prosecute you. SUCKS TO BE YOU, LOSER!!😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻
Joe Biden is ALSO the antithesis of everything I stand for. He's just Trump with an extra sprinkle of human rights. We had Barack Obama for 8 years, a Democrat who campaigned on "Change" - nothing actually changed. Why do you believe this will be any different?Hey  ad is a lie about Joe Biden. 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
GOP voters will turn out bigly, Democrat voters will turn out for Trump.  Many Bernie Bros will stay home, after their candidate was screwed again. Many African Americans will vote for Kanye. There is no path for Biden.
You're describing America if Biden wins, which is not going to happen.
This is a great plan. If you can convince enough people to blame Trump for shit that Democratic Governors did, Biden might have a chance.

I am watching, but not sitting back.  I am knocking on doors, why isnt Biden?
But more likely, it's not a big priority, given the huge lead in support Biden is showing across this nation
Biden went off script again.
Sweet, there's your statement. We can mail that to the Biden camp
there is literally nothing “captivating” about this lame attempt on Trumps part to draw away the black vote from Biden with this stunt. 🤦‍♀️🤨
Trump is going after Gamers. Biden is going to be playing a Game &amp; Watch on his next Zoom interview.
Nope. Today she wrote on a piece on how it depends who Biden picks for his VP. Was disappointed in her and surprised
Excuse me???? 🤨  I have seen plenty of video of the Biden’s attending church. You on the other hand....NOT ONE VIDEO OF YOU ATTENDING SERVICE AT ALL!!!!
Good grief!!! These Biden attack ads in Michigan are pathetic. Your lies and desperation are showing. 🤦‍♀️🙄 Anyone believing them is a moron and needs to just stay home.
Do you believe poor kids are not white are we just simping for Biden?
This is why #NoComradesUnder1k is trending. Leftists have had this monster pushed on them, and we're just supposed to accept it. Fuck Joe Biden.
Reporter follow-up: But should they be dissolved?  Biden follow-up: Any organization that's committed the level of fraud that the NRA has should be dissolved. This isn't about guns or the second amendment. This about holding corrupt organizations accountable. The NRA is corrupt.
When Biden gets asked, "Do you think the NRA should be dissolved?" he should respond with, "They're stopping legislation that would keep our children from getting shot up in schools. I'm glad that New York's AG is holding them accountable for all their corruption!"
Michigan pro-Trump Republicans say Biden’s police policies will push voters toward Trump
It never will. Partly because you guys made the crimes up, and don't give a shit about evidence.  But mostly because Biden isn't going to win a thing.
There are viral anti-Biden Whatsapp messages that a bunch of desis have forwarded me in the past couple of weeks, and I have a shrewd suspicion that they're all emanating directly from the Trump campaign as part of a covert messaging apps strategy.  I hope I'm wrong.
They all are. We're not voting on Trump vs Biden, we're voting on whether Justice should be done or this should be covered.
Casual reminder that Big Pharma literally owns Joe Biden and much of the establishment  as a whole. They will never fight for you.

I was just going to say a Biden tweet is how I heard about it the other day
Just listened to old ad from Biden promises and decided only thing that has grown better since then is how his hair has grown😭
I don't think so. Biden was never doing well in the polls, and he won the nomination.😁
Not significant, given that Biden didn't f*ck a porn star with a new wife (his 3rd) &amp; 1 yr old child at home, THEN, paid that porn star hush money, in violation of federal law
you will definitely still vote for biden and you will be happy to do it.
Biden can't beat Trump.  Trump, on the other hand, can win it for Biden.  Trumps biggest problem is he doesn't know when to shut his mouth and Biden's biggest problem is he doesn't know what's going to come out of his mouth.  This is a low mark in Presidential Elections.
Because she's been the best one the whole time. She never attacked Biden and she could have 1000 different ways, instead she cut the legs out from everyone who dared to try.  She can talk to anybody on either side of the aisle, And she's the best leader in that town.
Again, don't care....  Biden DID NOT f*ck a porn star with a new wife (his 3rd) &amp; his 1 yr old child at home, THEN, pay this porn star hush money in violation of federal law.. #TrumpIsACriminal   ...Just saying.
They're really bad at this lol  By tying Bernie to Biden with massive ad campaigns, they're going to ensure Biden wins 400+ electoral votes  Bernie's really popular, and that's something they don't get
Trump's ads just make Biden sound so cool!!
I'm not riden with Biden.🤷‍♂️
Nah, no disqualification. Biden's existence disqualifies him, and the voters will let him know in a few months.
This is conveniently just like all the evidence for Russia and fake impeachment.   You should just make that Biden's campaign slogan. "We have evidence, you just can't see it."
I admit that it is terribly sad that you think a websites Banner changes the truth value of the things they report. But then again your side belive the collusion delusion, fake impeachment, and now that Joe Biden is a sensible candidate.
A lot more people at going to vote for Trump than are willing to admit publicly or to pollsters.  I spent time with an Indian uncle in Saginaw, MI that fits this mold.  He didn't say it outright, but he spent a lot of time talking about #AllLivesMatter &amp; that Biden is pro-Muslim.
His climate plan is genuinely shaping up to be solid. The Biden-Bernie task force got a lot here.
Yep, always one D.A.F. or D.A.S. (dumb as...) in every neighborhood!  One block over from me , an entire block of Biden supporters with signs in yards and one neighbor on same street, with lime green, jacked-up pick-up with a huge Trump flag and and Rebel flag on long PVC poles🙄
I think Beto’s endorsement of Biden is what put him over the top in Texas, where we’d been leading in the polls   If we’d maintained 1st place in TX, that would have changed the entire narrative coming out of Super Tuesday
This Biden indecisive crap is all fake narative. Its called thoroughly vetting a VP choice.  The problem is the lack of vetting the media did on trump four years ago.  Its all fun and games til 150,000 plus people die
I just signed a  petition: BLACK WOMEN LEADERS LETTER TO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JOSEPH BIDEN. Sign here:
What Biden is doing is smelling her hair-odd yes.   What your master (T rump)  has done-sex with underage girls, me thinks is not odd-it is sick.
Nah.....It is  Have you see the polls?  50% of motivated voters will never ever vote for Trump---Thus the "anti" vote also is almost entirely Biden vote.
I’m gonna be making some awkward phone calls to strangers for Biden today, so if you wanna share with me in the awkward joy here’s a link! We can share stories after and it’ll be great #Biden2020
Biden won't be president, and also does not write these tweets.👍
Lol Texas was a key. If he hadn’t endorsed Biden ahead of Super Tuesday, I think we could have pulled it out. Polling had Bernie up
I disagree. I think his endorsement right before Super Tuesday gave Biden 1st place in Texas where we’d been leading
He may not have endorsed Bernie, but it may have stopped him endorsing Biden...or at least wait until after Super Tuesday to see what happened. I think about this often
Pretty sure that Biden never tweeted covfefe.
Trump has officially done more to win my vote than Biden
A reminder that a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. A vote for Trump is a vote for a third party. A vote for a third party is a vote for lasagna. Not voting is having a yard sale. Fishing is putting in a cement driveway.
Joe Biden is the shitty half of the Obama administration.  He better not screw this VP pick up
Trump campaign temporarily halts TV advertising in Michigan, but plans to outspend Biden 4-1
1) Tulsi endorsed Biden, too.   2) Bernie has absolutely not donated “all of his campaign to the DNC.” He’s using it to help elect down ballot progressives like Jamaal Bowman.   3) Tulsi doesn’t have very much money to donate, even if she were so inclined.
No, it doesn't. But I am not a partisan who is completely blind to the world around me.  The second Trump wins, the likelihood of World War 3 starting with China is high.  They already own Biden.🤷‍♂️
I have a neighbor who has one that says something like I'm down with Biden

Biden and the DNC have chosen "Uniting America"...The theme for the DNC's unprecedented virtual convention is meant to show a sharp contrast to Trump, who Democrats say has divided the nation amid one of the nation's most trying periods.
You and Ryan have clearly not read Biden’s platform and have not been paying any attention whatsoever
Don’t blow up my twitter. But I have friends, that I would consider, well educated, and intelligent individuals that  are Democrats. They believe Biden shows early symptoms of dementia and will still vote for him because they hate President Trump.   Let that sink in...
Why won't Joe Biden condemn the riots, looting and attacks on Police Officers in America?

They believe its a war, Rob! And apparently all is fair in love and war.  Problem is, the dems will only fight respectfully.  I've always wondered why there are no foriegn countries tampering in the election to help Biden? They all hate fucking trump!  Let's get Joe some help!
when Biden or the Media say that u didn’t take things serious during the 1st few months I were listening to your experts who were getting flawed data from China and WHO - when u discovered that data was a lie u acted accordingly
There are a lot of videos showing how Joe Biden is in obvious cognitive decline.  I like this one because it shows how Biden used to be.  How he was able to speak in 2008 but he is now unable to put his thoughts together.

No, I won't be silent. Joe Biden is a terrible Catholic in name only. He promotes abortion, has officiated at a so-called same-sex marriage at the white house, he's cool with Marxism. Joe Biden is a horrible Catholic and he deserves all the scorn Trump gives him. Get over it.
Not it. It's Beto being in charge of gun reform for Biden (Hell ya were going to take your guns). It's the Progressive squad running the country, using Biden as a face, then again Biden will step down due to old age, so watch who the VP is because thats who they want in office.

It seems the only people worried about Biden's cognitive abilities are Trump and his Republican ilk.
“This is an iconic industry. How can American-made vehicles no longer be out there?” Joe Biden said in the campaign ad. “I believe we can own the 21st century market again by moving to electric vehicles.”
Joe Biden will do a real interview with a real journalist (not Gerry).
Truth. Biden’s not perfect by any stretch, but he came out, owned up to what he said and apologized. When was the last time Trump admitted wrongdoing on anything?
Yup!!! And now we’re likely gonna end up with a Biden/Harris ticket and I can’t even. lol

Biden has no toilet in the basement. He ran out of TP forcing him to go in the backyard! His handlers counted 14 brown or yellow spots in the grass. C’mon man you using coke too? I’m not CRAZY
Good job on taking control over your guest today on religion. But Joe Biden has never done anything for the church. It about policy. Trump came in office and change policy to help the church. There is 40% evangelicals in America who are voting for Trump.
Considering it's obvious Biden doesn't even use his own Twitter account I seriously doubt he's sorry for what he said and probably doesn't even know this tweet exists.  Whatever unpaid intern they got doing this account must be pretty damn tired by now.

"Biden helped kill the most effective policy for improving black educational attainment that America has ever known...[and] worked tirelessly..to make America’s (profoundly racist) criminal-justice system more punitive than any other advanced democracy’s."
Trump is terrible, but that doesn't mean Biden is good--&gt;  "Here are three ways the 1994 crime bill [that Joe Biden wrote] continues to undermine the safety and well-being of communities of color..."
Glad you had a black person speaking for us on Biden comments. Unlike the white one you had so tire of white host telling us what offends us. How does she know is she black. Another white Dem presuming they speak for us that why millions of black voting for Trump.
(From  THIS is how the media covers for Joe Biden and his 'race comments' [UPDATE: Chris Wallace does the same thing!]
Biden proves his Christian beliefs by actively caring about the welfare of others. He is a nice guy, which is something no one could ever say about Trump. Jill and Joe demonstrate their love for each other, always.
Regardless of who’s on the ballot in this upcoming election man please be wise. Biden is better than trump. The Kanye shit is all a rebukican ploy to get less votes for Biden b/c they know how naïve black and minority voters can be. Please don’t be fooled about this shit
Are you being sarcastic? A GOP leaning partisan poll that doesn’t show Trump hit 50% doesn’t show major structural changes in the state? It might not be a true bellweather but it’s def a swing state! How is this poll more valid than DMN Biden +5 poll  or the more recent Q-poll?
I honestly don't think Biden needs to clarify his racist comments anymore  We know he's a racist Clarified
China Joe Biden thinks because he was Obama's VP he is entitled to the Black vote. I think he is very confused to say the least!
I read yesterday where Kanya was running to take Black votes from Biden, now he's saying he want to win, Look America your Vote is Much too important to be Played with as we're experiencing Now, Don't Waste Your Vote Voting Stupid
Now Joe Biden wanna apologize for some new low key racist shit he said. White folks been apologizing like a muthafucka all year but turn around and continue being racist. At this point fuck y’all apology.
Behold everyone, Biden's compilation.
And it rhymes too. So clearly God intended for us to call him Hidin’ Biden. I think that’s pretty clear at this point.
Let's keep our footing on solid ground. Biden is not perfect, probably no white person is when it comes to representing blacks. However, Biden is much better than Trump.
Watch them blame Dems before Biden's hand leaves the bible on Jan 20th
I love how Biden boxed himself in with the whole “I’m picking a Black Women for my VP. Which was really racist to begin with
Speaking of Confederate flags, looks like David Duke didn't get the memo that he was supposed to endorse Biden.

That’s actually NOT TRUE... that’s what the Biden crew &amp; MSM want EVERYONE to believe..  Please give me a few examples of conservatives saying anything close to that..  You are confusing what Democrats constantly &amp; consistently say  An oldie but a goodie

This some shit Joe Biden would say
It's also a very Anti-Catholic thing to say that Biden is against the Bible! Who's advising this moron to make these comments? He's just spiting out whatever wacky thing that comes into his head, and throwing his feces with both hands, it's sad and pathetic! Time to resign now!

Are we surprised that Kanye, another multi-millionaire that got millions in COVID $$ from the corrupt Trump Administration, is agreeing to be a lap dog for the RNC. He admits to not wanting to win, there to hurt Biden, RNC paying for him to be on ballots  #BOYCOTTKANYEKARDASHIAN
Hey...any new #NoComradesUnder1k and #nocomradeunder5k, are you following Presidential Candidate Mark Charles at  and if not, why not. Stop talking abt bad choices, organize and fight them both. No Biden- No Trump. Mark Charles 2020? We have options.
#boycottKardashians Is anyone surprised that the family that sells themselves for money and ratings would support a man who is playing with the presidency. Kanye says he has no desire to win he just want to hurt Biden. Bankrolled by the RNC it shows their disregard for America.
Nobody is taking my guns or anyone elses, if Biden wins, its fixed!! The sleeping giant will awaken and take down the radical left once and for all...true story!!!
Biden gaffs are just that gaffs. Whereas Trump doesn't make gaffs, when he says something stupid he means it, stands by it, and then spends a month lying about it.
Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible, hurt God,' guns-I've never heard or seen anything like this in my life and I'm almost 70 years old! Donald Trump needs a Mental Evaluation a much more serious one than he bragged about that a grade school kid could master, he's a sick man-

Terry, how are these related things? How is Biden winning the Democratic nomination a byproduct of BLM? I agree with the critique of the choices produced by our two-party system, but I fail to see how this has anything to do with BLM.
Wow. That should be enough for him to lose the ele...wait. Biden said racist things. But Trump said thigh.
Yeah YouTube is cunts Especially for people like that. They're silencing dissent and if you mention the Rona by name&amp; ur monetized  you're toast. The closer to the election we get the more it's getting censored. I can't skip 45 or Biden ads aimed at my region at all anymore
Trump wants to debate Joe Biden so badly I think ALL  accusers to should be invited to sit front row at them.
Maybe Joe Biden should pick who he’d want to be his Vice President and tell everyone who disagrees to fuck off
Joe Biden says "you aint black"
I feel the same way. It seems however, that every time I start to think I need to just suck it up and vote for Biden because Trump is really that bad, Biden opens his mouth and I’m back to fk it, let it all burn.
When does Biden announce VP choice? Does anyone know?
He can’t lose because Biden is a horrible democratic candidate

I'm not a huge fan of Biden, but he didn't get near as much negativity 4 years ago when he wasn't running for president. A lot of the shit spreading around him seems like an effort from others who benefit from him seeming like a bad person.

I believe the only reason Biden won the nominee was because hes in the best interest of others in the DNC. Idk if Yang could of cleaned house, but hes being shown a lot more love than Biden and people were crazy for his UBI proposal.
And that's exactly why Biden *should* call for defunding the police - he's taking the hits for their lies, but also taking the hits for the truth that he's taking the Conservative/neoliberal stance against it. Conservative lite is a DNC fail.
Amid reports GOP &amp; Trump operatives are trying to get West onto state ballots for the election, West indicated he was seeking to siphon votes from Joe Biden.  West said rather than running for president, he was “walking” &amp; added “walking...to win.”

Then I think you’re more left than you realize.... and I’m with you, I fucking hate Biden.... but Trump isn’t constitutional. He breaks every law there is... publicly. It’s an issue. Other nations are laughing at us, and I can’t stand it, nor do I blame them. We look so dumb.

Don’t really think most of y’all got the right to be all appalled by Joe Biden now. He won the primaries easily. Y’all were out there voting for him when there so many other options.
I am a woman but with all due respect if Biden wants to win this campaign he needs to choose the Gov. of New York!
What Biden said was moronic. And yet all you can do is attack someone else. Just typical fascist behavior by today’s left. I can easily admit trump is wrong about many things. Why can’t you just admit Biden is an idiot??
Idk, Beto lost to Cruz by what, 2% ? I doubt Biden is leading there among likely voters but just the fact it’s close should have GOP at stroke level. Add in Covid and he could be ahead depending on turnout.  And that speech to text error was hilarious!

No. Every few weeks and sometimes every few days biden says some ignorant or racist crap and his Twitter handlers have to backtrack or spin what he said. Just like Kellyanne Conway would do for trump. Show us some damn respect and stop making excuses for him.
Does anyone think Biden will be on the same stage and debate Trump? He will back out at the last minute and come up with some bullshit excuse, or he will want to debate from his basement while his handlers are feeding him the answers
Both of our candidates are racist as fuck. If you can’t see that you are brainwashed yourself. Trump has made racial remarks regularly and Biden has surrounded much of what he talks about with racist connotations. Let’s not beat around the bush, it is happening on both ends.

I honesty don't think Biden meant any harm.  He just doesn't know what he's doing anymore...and that's not meant to be a knock on him.  Unfortunately it happens to many of us as we get up there in age.
So what would Biden have done different with the CHINA WUHAN VIRUS? We already know he wouldn’t have put a travel ban on China so our hospitals would have broke ... so seriously??
Why I Joe Biden running? To avoid Hunter and himself from getting in trouble. China!!!
Then you’re not voting for Biden. Spare me.
Study: Instagram’s algorithm favored Trump over Biden
Seems highly unlikely. The cabal clearly hates Trump. And even if there is a non-zero chance for globalist control under Trump, it's 100% if Biden gets elected.
Twitter is so biased for Biden they are willing to be regulated ! Fine with us Trump supporters !
#realDonaldTrump   "Hoax" to Donald Trump is a word to cover up the truth.    #TrumpHoaxedAmerica   #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace   #Biden
Biden; out of touch Dem base should let Joe know undocumented,(illegal) immigrants  #1- should not be in USA #2- should not be working Biden adopted Bernie Sanders far left agenda. Biden for illegals and against the American worker Biden against school of choice # Biden socialist
Seems like that'll hurt trump, not Biden. Everyone in America knows how unstable and sadistic Kanye and trump are. I can't visualize Kanye and Biden splitting the Democratic vote.
Posted an anti-Trump thought tonight. Had someone "enlighten" me that Joe Biden is being controlled by Satanists and pedophiles who want to undo Trump's help for Christians.   I respectfully disagreed. I was then told I was "beguiled by the devil."   So, how was your day?
Agreed. Many young people claimed they wanted Bernie. And how did that work out? They’re not sold on Biden. Are they voting for Trump instead? Kanye? I too cannot do this.
Biden: Are you a junkie!?  Reporter: No sir, I’m not your son! #NeverBiden
Feels good to just hear a political leader say "I was wrong" or "I'm sorry"...no love lost. Just learning opportunities. #Biden
I can’t argue that he has dealt with an incredible amount of grief. That story I shared is completely legit though, along with many other instances of his dishonesty. All I said was Joe Biden will not be a good President. I didn’t say he should or shouldn’t beat Trump.
You mean when Biden is running for his second term and Trump is in prison and bankrupt.
Y'all really tried to tell me Biden was a "safer" bet then Bernie
IKR?!?! Now Trump says Biden is gonna “Hurt God”... SMDH
Wow more reasons why Biden isn’t it 👏 he does not deserve our vote 👏Cada dia veo las noticias de Biden y cada dia me cae tan mal.
Chris you can’t ignore the stuff coming out of Biden’s mouth 👄 it’s getting ridiculous. You can’t ignore these facts
Biden for president?  Deteriorating daily Question: should undocumented,(illegal) immigrants get free health care Answer; Yes, if working, paying taxes should get free healthcare like all Americans. Biden not all working Americans are getting free health care. Biden for illegals
Comparing two different candidates is foolish. Biden is more popular, less divisive, attracting more Republicans, and ahead by more in the polls than Hillary ever was.
The most comical part about Trump attacking Biden on his religion is the fact that the attacks are coming from a thrice married philandering thief who raped his first wife and laughed about a man bleeding out on the floor.
Biden likes kids
Can you imagine if Trump said something like this!? 24/7 nonstop coverage on MSM. Don Lemon racial justice town hall shows, riots in every major city. When Biden says it, crickets. MSM is a national disgrace, it's utterly criminal how they conduct themselves
And according to me and Biden you ain't black unless....and telling a black man we are you a junky ? Ok mfp
How ironic that you’re questioning trumps mental fitness when Joe Biden opens his mouth and crazy stuff comes out every day our democracy is way way off balance here we have no candidates and one of them is going to be our president this is going to be a freaking nightmare
Biden's  gaffes??? Lazy reporters produce these types of stories.I guess constant reporting on Russia paying Bounty for American Soldiers called for to much effort. It is only a single issue election when reported by white reporters with tunnel vision.
it is true Joe Biden is going to hurt god, take that Christians, Joe Biden is now god
I’m so excited to hear from  as she gives the keynote address at the  volunteer leadership conference, Gun Sense University this Sunday!   Sign up to get an email reminder to watch with me:  #GSU2020 #TeamJoe
As a deteoiter id like to say, tell that to #district13. We have diverse Black, Latino AND Arab all from different countries and religions. Biden was VP for a Kenyan-Kansasite from Hawaii and an African-American from south side of Chicago. He should be more thoughtful.
I tend to agree for the most part, but I don't care that Biden is "old" so long as he is a democrat he has my vote and any other "D" I can vote for.  We have to get Trump and as many Republicans out in order to undo this nightmare.
Drew Biden approves!
April 11, 2018 Joe Biden’s Record On Racial Integration Is Indefensible  Biden insists that he took a brave stance in favor of busing. This could not be further from the truth… by      Asher Smith
And I don't see Biden as garbage or even with dementia I just believe what he has is a speech impediment and that's alright. I'm sorry you feel that way about him but that's alright it's your opinion as an American and that's what being American is supposed to be about.
NOTHING will stop America from electing President Biden.  86451132020 #AmericaStrongerWithBiden
Dems didn't expect Trump to mess up this much and are now having Biden talk, along with suing the NRA, in order to lose harder.
US election 2020: Trump says opponent Biden will 'hurt God'
Said the pedo Biden supporter.
I respect your opinion I only see one evil this election in fact I see Biden as someone that shares more true conservative values than Trump does
I just can't imagine Joe Biden tweeting this or completing any other thought.
Apparently Joe Biden is a radical leftist. This is proof that white people smoke a lot of weed.
Kowtowing to communism has been a code-word for racist behavior. These moves by Biden’s team threaten his base of voters.  Those republicans that have not already sworn to vote for Biden, will vote for Trump regardless; especially those who claim to hate communism.
People are irate because it shouldn’t matter who Biden picks as VP. A decent person can look at the two choices that we have - Trump or Biden - and choose Biden without hesitation, no matter what. Because Trump is NEVER an acceptable choice.
Lol...I don't need to listen to Biden kick your ass in a debate to make up my mind.  You have already done SOOOOO many shitty things to the people in this Country...
That Biden add really doesn’t use the language of the working class! Disgusting!   btw u need to read Hegel and Marx and Engels and Lenin and Hoxha and Mao and
Breaking: Just announced, text to vote approved by the house nation wide.  Text: 30330 to vote for Biden Nov 3rd Registration no longer necessary.   Damn! Guess Nancy came through after all
He’s going to strangle us too?  This Biden sounds terrible 🤣
It’s hard to have sober dialogue about Do and Trump and even Biden.... now days it’s legit ... either you with what the TV says you should be or you’re wrong..... it’s all madness
It's a slippery slope when you start saying someone is against #God. Especially someone as outspoken about their faith as  has been. I'm all about fair fights in #politics, but let's not do it about #faith just to appeal to a particular group.
You mean the same Biden that called Trump Xenophobic for his travel ban on China at early stages of the pandemic?  That Biden?
Joe Biden: ‘When I Was a Senator…I Secured a 10-Year Ban on Assault Weapons—and as President, I’ll Ban These Weapons Again’
Boy Biden find a new way to disrespect the people who saved his election every week.
I logged on to Twitter for two damn minutes today and motherfuckers are trying to petition to get Lebanon under French colonial rule and Joe Biden is saying there’s no diversity of opinion among Black people.   Guess we’ll try again tomorrow. ✌🏼
Biden is the Saint of Killers CONFIRMED
I’ll say it again, Biden is the racist old white dude that they tell you Trump is.
Sounds good. But u must take baby steps. U can't DUMP on DEMS as u did Hillary; &amp; some of u now with Biden. DEMS r one of yor CRUCIALLY NESESSARY Baby STEPS. A lot of u fell 4 Trump's bait &amp; actually VOTED 4 him. 2 things wrong there: Trump had shown in 2016 that he was a crook..
Shame on you  and Biden family!!!
🤣🤣🤣Joe Biden is too stupid to even run his own account... Lol, that's another good question... Who runs Joe Bidens account?? 🤔
Trump just says foolish things. This might have been workable against Clinton, who never spoke much about her faith at all. Or even Obama, who the right had lied about his faith entirely for years. But Biden is famously a devout Catholic. Lets Biden bring this up now.
Pls actually research what the politicians say. Just BC trump says something doesn’t make it true, same with Biden. But mostly trump. He spouts bullshit often. Use your own brain, DONT just follow your party blindly. Vote smart this nov.
I have, but obviously you have NEVER listen to Trump,if you think Biden is a racist. And i have never hear him admit that, i also know the definition of racist and Biden ain't it.
Biden will.
Oh this is funny.  Seriously?  Biden will mop the floor with Trump during a debate.
Biden forgot to order flags... or bumper stickers.  He's well stocked in basement supplies though.
It’s an insult to African Americans that this clown actually believes he will votes from Biden.
Lmao vote for Biden they said. Respectfully fuck y’all
It wasn't as good then as it is for Biden now. It looked like true tossup in 2016 and Trump only won by 3.5 points. There was only a hot minute that she lead the aggregate. Since then the suburbs have certainly shifted.
Michigan will be tough this time around....but I still haven’t seen one Biden sign/bumper sticker/flag and I live in Wayne county
I just wish Joe Biden would just let  speak. I already don’t want to vote for him but I will. But just please #StopTalking
biden will be just as bad as trump, but a different type of bad
"Well unlike the blacks who all think &amp; look like, the Latinos have diverse ideas" Joe Biden
Only this sweaty orange man can stop Biden from hurting God.
45's statement is therefore coherent in a sense.  Since he believes the world revolves around him, believing himself to be god, Biden is, by definition, against god.
He says his 13 key factors for predicting the election haven't failed yet.
If you want your town to become like downtown Mogadishu vote for Joe Biden!
Maybe Biden will pardon them. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
But NO Biden does mean never democrat
I don’t care if OAN says Biden is polling ahead in every single state. VOTE ON NOVEMBER 3.
It could be Biden/ a rock 2020 and I am all in.
This bastard Biden along with AOC and the other nutty progressives will destroy America! Trump 2020
Your in denial of reality. Biden's on a sinking ship , the Titanic.
I'll go as far as saying that I do think she'll be the VP choice and if Biden wins I think she'll get beat in the primary in 2024/2028.

Glad to know you’re on the fence between voting for Biden or helping re-elect Trump.
Biden was referring to political affiliation &amp; voting trends. Historically, African American voters are more closely aligned with the Democratic Party than are Latinos.   2016 election:  African Americans: 89% Clinton, 8% Trump  Latinos: 66% Clinton, 28% Trump
TRUMP has KID-BLOOD ALL OVER his body, &amp; he's BLAMING Joe Biden 4 it!

Vote Kamala Harris. Not Susan Rice she is tied too much to Benghazi even if not true it could cause Biden to lose the election
President Trump do not stop going! Dems are mad that you are going from city to city! Do not be like Biden and Hillary let them talk. You going because you are scare. No you are smart! Stay before the people. We know why you want debates cause Biden dementia.
Yes,   i want little Kids to wear a mask because  Joe Biden told me and he's the Best mind the DNC has
I was asking cause it seems as though people are finding a convenient reason not to vote for Biden especially at a time like this. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Does Biden have any Tattoos? Does he support abortion?
Ah yes... the uber faithful Biden who supports abortion as a GUARANTEED constitutional protection.
Playing Electoral Defense, Trump Claims Biden Opposes God
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Michigan “Build Back Better: Made in America” Roundtable with Richard Trumka and Rep. Dan Kildee” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
This is PERFECT, so when arguing with libs it’ll be very easy to point out the way MSM LIED to them over &amp; over when it was blatantly obvious that Biden’s jacked up since last fall. This will prove the point of coordinated lying across networks
You all misunderstood, Biden is actually trying to become the new Garvey and represent Pan-Africanism!!! Thank you Joe!!!
Sincere question...  How does this end?  Ride it out on an awful roller-coaster until January when Biden can finally start doing something to truly tackle this thing, or what?  #Coronavirus #Covid19 #Covid19USA #America
Biden can’t even take care of himself ! 🙄🙄🙄
How many of you are actually this stupid?
A VP has almost no power. Meanwhile, a senator has enormous power. There's no guarantee that Biden's pick will eventually be president and if it is Harris, she'll likely be replaced in the Senate with someone more progressive. Think, people. It's a marathon, not a sprint.
By attacking Joe Biden for his Catholic faith.Donald Trump has shown himself,for the hateful,divisive   Bigot,that he is .
Biden should refuse to debate that nitwit if he doesn’t release his taxes
Mr. Biden: Do not gravel in the gutter w trump. Let him spew and spout. Don't respond. Remain positive. He is baiting you.
Oh Biden 🤦🏾‍♀️ I’m really looking forward to the progressives who’ll be joining the house.
All I heard today at work were Biden gaffs. Some video with a kid not being able to ‘use his words’ to describe something. Apparently it was a jab at Biden. I wanted to share the Swan/Trump interview, but I also wanted to keep my job.
Someone’s pandering to Black voters, and it isn’t Biden.
I call bullshit. If you want to vote for Biden, you would regardless of who he choose to be VP. Bottom line, either you vote for him or you don't, plain and simple without any but ahs, ems, ers, and ohs.
It might be aimed at Biden, but this will draw more votes from Trump
They're quietly hoping Biden dies from the Alzheimer's he's clearly afflicted with.
Oh thank goodness! Thanks, Pastor Dave for setting my mind at ease. I will sleep soundly tonight for sure. I sure hope Biden doesn't get elected, because poor god will be defenseless if we don't have guns to protect him with. #sarcasm
My guess is  is not going to block Biden’s prosecution. It is coming to a head.
Biden is setting up another mass influx of illegal immigration from around the world - and a dedicated voter block in waiting.    Why wouldn't the come get all the freebies.
"Biden will kill god" is a fucking stellar cosign
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked ‘Aunt Jemima’ as his running mate  via  Good Americans died to keep that racist POS state in the Union -  Lincoln should let the South secede.
I think you meant Biden
The author of this tweet seems to have confused Biden with Trump Remember Trump hates minorities,puts Latino kids in cages, and calls black athletes son of bitches,while saying that all cities are shitholes.  Remember??
Now can y'all see why some of us were NOT.  feeling Joe Biden? Dude is a liability. Warren, Harris or Castro would have been so much better. He's gonna have an enthusiasm problem.... 😔 Better hope the hatred of 45 is enough to push him over the threshold... 😔😔
Maybe  should be on Biden’s short list for VP.
Peter Nygard: FBI raids fashion mogul HQ in sex trafficking probe  I thought it was Biden for a second 🤣🤣😂 doesn't he kinda look like him??
Omg I thought that was Biden for a second 😂😂
So our choice is between President #Thighland and Joe Biden who says on CNBC that he will beat Joe Biden.
boogeyman Biden coming to destroy holy, white, evangelical suburbia!!
"Biden had planned to go upstairs, get a bite to eat from the refrigerator, and return to the basement, but due to coronavirus fears, will be remaining down there indefinitely."
Biden is doing the same. Will you condemn him too?
Meghan:  " I really want to vote for Biden but I *really* hate poor people, this is so hard"
Don’t give a damn who Biden blesses with his VP slot.
China Biden is for abortions right up till Birth. Either I missed something or Biden is a phony as his religion!
Fuck Joe Biden, and fuck the Two Party System for giving me no other choice.
Let him continue to stay in the spotlight and make a fool of himself, because the media is waiting on Biden to say anything that can make headlines, so they can discuss them both.
China puppet Biden needs to realize that Blacks have come a long way since the sixties and we can think for ourselves.
I wasn't referring to Biden of course I was referring to the Gov I'd rather her stay also I think Kamala is the perfect choice
Biden is the racist and uses the democrat party as a white sheet!
Kamala Harris accomplished smart confident and I could easily see her being president tomorrow. She is who I hope to goodness Biden picks.
Funny cuz Biden has literally endorsed everything that’s in the Green New Deal and would be the most progressive president in history. But you’ll just say he’s “lying” so you’re just as irrational and illogical as a trump supporter🙃🤡
Sure! Show me video of Biden
Is there ranked choice voting for the individual congressional districts at the presidential level? For instance, If Biden gets a majority in ME-State &amp; ME-1, but Trump gets a plurality in ME-2, do all three continue with ranked choice or just ME-2?
Biden had a little bit of a gaffe today but thanks to Trump that got overshadowed big time. For Biden just has a speech impediment, Trump is just plain dumb and ignorant.
Every time I see this person tweet I think it’s a secret Biden superpac
we ended up with perhaps the worst of the democratic candidates who will pick an awful vp if news reports are accurate...and for #palestinians, among others, things will continue as they have been -  breaks it down:
Pot, kettle? You're the one here defending Biden. LMAO.
Our God is a puny god who can be hurt by Biden....is that how that song goes.
Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. Certain women, especially MSNBC hosts, throw shade at Hilary as often as possible. 😡😡😡
Biden is either very powerful or God is a puny god.
A Biden and BLM supporter... I'd have to question that "brain"...
That number is so low it barely registers this election. Perhaps in 2016, you had a some undecideds but I find it hard to believe there are many this time. Trump is no longer an unknown. He has a record now and voters already know Biden.
If Biden can hurt God, than God is weak or Biden is poweful like Yoda or Gandalf.
You are obviously defending what Biden said here. I don't care how you try to excuse it away.  This is not cherry-picking 13 seconds of Biden. He has a long and checkered history of saying such things. Imagine acting like this comment exists in a vacuum and is not a pattern...
Did he even mention the word "culture?"  Are you trying to say that Black Americans are not diverse in their beliefs and attitudes? Or are they just not Black if they have different beliefs and attitudes?  This is YOUR Biden moment. Embrace it!
Donald Trump disparages Biden’s school records,while hiding his academic ,”accomplishments” from sight.
"Most people don't know."  This is Biden's "dirty little secret" he has on Black Americans, by the way. He is obviously superior and "most people" are inferior.
Why don't they just replace Biden with Bernie?
Biden believes that Black people are not allowed to have a diversity of attitudes. He has already said as much and repeats it here. You aren't Black if you don't vote Dem.  People keep trying to drag culture into this when he specifically mentions "attitudes," aka beliefs.
i don't go into the politics trending too often cause i'm not educated enough to understand most of it, but its really nice knowing the lady who did a lot of my state is apparently up for VP if joe biden wins.
Considering that Biden specifically mentioned diversity of "attitudes," whatever point you are trying to make completely misses the mark.  He expects black people to be one way, believe one thing, not vary from that script, and most importantly, vote Dem.  He has said as much.
What about Biden vs. Jesus ?
Because unfortunately, like Trump, Biden is a racist. For decades Biden has legislated to the detriment of PoC--the Crime Bill &amp; the Patriot Act that he wrote destroyed the lives of black &amp; brown people...and he helped Obama deport more immigrants than any admin' in history.
Concerning?
That seems unlikely. Biden's CrimeBill that he wrote put black &amp; brown people in jail at disproportionate rates. Biden's Patriot Act that he wrote helped institutionalize racial profiling on a widespread scale. Biden helped Obama deport more immigrants than any admin' in history.
See I don’t think Joe Biden is a decent human being, but that’s just my opinion. I don’t think he’s a good politician, I don’t think he’s of sound mind and I certainly do not believe he will be a good President. I’m taking Trump out of the equation and just evaluating Biden.
Honestly I don’t wanna vote for Biden or Trump. I wanted Bernie Sanders to be president
"We had the plan from when I filed for reelection — I said, we do not stop in August. We continue forward because our residents can’t afford another four years of Donald Trump," Rep. Rashida Tlaib said Wednesday.
Trump is the Man 👨! Biden is off his rocker ! Lol
Joe Biden is going to hurt God. I said that with a straight face😂😂 #Thighland  #ItIsWhatItIs
No he completely changed the story. It was going after the NRA bc of fraud, nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment. He stated that and than dragged in more fake news about Biden. Intelligent people read that actually is happening instead of believing people who make up stuff.
Do you have proof that Biden molested children?
Biden the Gaffe Machine
Yes, but are they an incredibly diverse community of immigrants? Asking for Biden.
I hope Biden does MeToo Vishnu.  I hate me, too
The only thing Biden needs to win the election is keep his decrepit, armpit-huffing mouth shut. Someone just sit him down in front of a TV playing nothing but footage of Israelis bulldozing Palestinian homes and with prison execution chamber CCTV for the next three months.
Trump drawing them out to arrest them. To have a safer country.  All those caught on video destroying monuments. Feds are coming Ming to get you. Even Columbus was hands off. Mussolini clean up italy and Italians love him. Trump doing the same. Time will tell if he does. Biden?
tRump is confusing Joe Biden's policy on China with HIS policy on Russia. Stupid as the day is long.
Biden should start his convention acceptance speech with a prayer. Send moderate Christians in a SPIRAL.
Why do they keep allowing Joe Biden to speak!!! Can he just please shut up until after election day. PLEASE.
back to my comment on your latest column and not voting for Biden. You would be willing to put with this.
"Uhh... did Joe Biden just say that Black people are all the same". No, he said there were "notable exceptions".
Wow if Biden is that powerful he for sure needs to be President!  Get him in there now!!!
Well if Biden is going to hurt God then I’m out.  Before this I was 100% for Biden, but now I’m convinced to support Trump because God.  Said no one ever.
So you are uncomfortable with the direction Trump has/is taking the country yet you will write someone in instead of voting for Biden? You might as well vote for Trump, by noting voting for Biden you are giving the edge to the status quo
Trump has had 2 gaffes in one day yet he says Biden is mentally ill? Lol
Zero Biden signs here in Michigan. Exactly like last time, all Trump no Hillary. I’m nervous about this election.
It's Biden or fascism. That's the choice.
You know if they really wanted Biden to debate Trump they would at least do some kind of Zoom Debate.
In the mind of Trump Biden is a Greek Titan, consuming concepts and forces of nature, distant from the mortal realm. Unfortunately Biden is just a centrist responsible for decades of horrible policy, so he’s not much up to injuring divine beings.
I hope so. Bet me $50 that Biden's lead doesn't go down over the next 2 weeks?
This is performative nonsense - there isn't a person in the whole of the country that Biden could pick that would satisfy you.  But you did get a nice ratio out of it...so, win?
Seeing Biden talk about the latino community is really something he basically says nothing just we got to embrace the latino community we got to stop seperating families we got to include them okay but what exactly are you going to do to help the latino community are you going to
#JoeBiden is steady slidin'. Where's his Lean at hidin'? Pelosi the concoction potion pill posse putting her denture bite in slippin' the dribblin' lip of alcoholic toxin ill. 1 Debate and Biden. Killed. Slide thru the middle of the red and blue pill riddle. Skat for the skittle
Biden seriously needs to just say what exactly he is going to do what are his plans this vague shit in his videos isn’t good enough.
Well i'm sorry that the god you believe in is so weak sauce that he can be limited by Joe Biden. Also the NY AG doesn't have the ability to amend the constitution of the United States
This is just awesome! Biden campaign ad spills beans on GM's secret Corvette plans  via
She actually made a very good point. If Biden picks Harris then he will not lose any progressive voters but if he picks Rice he may loses some conservative voters.
'Sure, I gassed and beat peaceful protesters to clear the way for me to stand in front of a church that didn't want me so I could hold a Bible upside down, but y'know, it was really hot that day, the sun was in my eyes... Oh, where was I? Right. Biden will poop on your lawn... '
To get to Thighland do you take a left or a right at Yo Semite?
If China Biden keeps talking about the African-American community as dumb, lazy and must have the government for their every need he may wind up getting 10% of our vote.
Biden wouldn't block Trump's prosecution if the Justice Department pursued it   Prosecuted for beating Hillary?
'Sure, I gassed and beat citizens to clear the way for me to stand in front of a church that didn't want me so I could hold a Bible upside down, but y'know, it was really hot that day, the sun was in my eyes... Oh, where was I? Biden? Right. Biden will poop on your lawn... '
Thank you for proving my point. Maybe Biden can actually win a proxy war against Russia , unlike Obama. On foreign policy the left are the 2003 Republicans.
I'm happy Biden has at least narrowed it to two legit VP candidates. Harris or Rice are great choices although of course I'd prefer Kamala since she's more moderate but I do love both. Both are great.
Using other candidates donor lists is very common in the DNC, it was very strange when Bernie refused in 16. Biden using Warren's donor list is NOT confirmation of anything, especially when this photo leaked last week indicating Harris was likely.
Let's be clear, Joe Biden could call me a n***  kill my cat, burn my house down, shoot everybody I know including my kids, cut my foot off and I would still vote for him over that orange bitch.
Can Joe Biden get away with saying that?
Every time I start to think “maybe I should just suck it up and vote for this senile neoliberal hack cause Trump is really that bad” Biden goes and does an interview and I’m back to screw it, let Trump burn it all down.
Donald Trump really needs to stop trying to make Biden look cool.
hard to listen to you on fix and keep a straight face.  You make no sense and bumble more then biden when answering tough questions..lmao
The democrats and especially Joe "Crow" Biden take the Black vote for granted and sadly we will give it to them. I will be voting for President Trump on Nov 3rd!
People in Detroit have been talking about this for years. He could have said this in 2014 and it would not have been a big deal...
In this case it means President Biden though .. and the hell that will descend upon us with the leftists in charge
Soon, Biden will be against chocolate chip cookies!
If there were any doubts as to the sanity of this man, I would think that this video shows his level of madness. I don’t know why Biden is against God, I guess that Trump talks to God, and then God tells Trump to tell everyone. God in the White House? Naw...
Nope they won't &amp; Twitter, Facebook &amp; Google with only allow the censored version... To make Joe Biden look good.. They will remove the full debate off their websites...
“No guns, no police and no grocery stores! In Biden’s America you will have to grow your own non-GMO/organic food. Plus no more free air. He will tax that like no one has ever taxed air before. Believe me!”
We need to appoint the Dursley’s to run Biden’s campaign. They’ve had a lot of success containing someone that a fraction of the population thought was the chosen one. Their “be in your room pretending you don’t exist” strategy could clinche the presidency for Biden #teamofrivals
Or they will censor it to make Joe Biden look good just like they did with Killary
When Biden gets in all that will change is NATO expansion. He was Obama's VP remember, and Obama made George Bush look like Ghandi
Meanwhile Biden is over there waxing poetic about Corvettes and talking directly to everyone born between 1953 and 1962
China Biden cares more about illegals than Blacks.
I don't know if that will happen but Joe Biden just said that blacks all think alike, but Hispanics don't.
Relax. Geez. The only person saying Biden will take away your guns is Trump. Don’t you see why? He wants to scare you into voting for him.
I agree that's how Biden wins. He loses the minute libs turn this into a guns election.
Biden would be a fool not to pick her.
Republicans when a Biden quote is taken out of context
That Joe Biden fellow sounds pretty cool.
Joe Biden was the first Catholic Vice President. If elected President, he will be the second Catholic to hold that position. The first Catholic President was John F. Kennedy.
Biden just keeps shooting himself in the foot. 🤦
I laughed out loud. Still voting for Biden because fuck Trump but this tweet was hilarious.
Trump is obviously referring to Biden's training with Hattori Hanzo.
Right, because Trump is such a shining example of Christian behavior.   Joe Biden is a Catholic, and a devout one at that. His years of public service are a testament to his faith.
Wait till you hear what he said about Biden
I’m optimistic. There is a momentum that can push even Biden. Remember, FDR did the New Deal because the people wanted it, and they demanded it.
I want this to be an official part of Biden's platform
She would throw away her vote if Biden picks Susan Rice.  Easy enough to understand.
Somebody in Ohio just said Biden doesn't like the Bible or God
Not once has Biden said he’s defunding any kind of law enforcement. And Trump was corrected, on-air, by Chris Wallace to prove that.   Talk about fear-mongering, he’s blowing smoke up your ass to cover for a “non-profit” that sure spends a lot on for-profit-like expenses.
Biden is seriously so far gone. He's either pretending to have dementia to avoid prosecution, or his mental state is on a massive decline. I still can't believe this is the best dems could do, it's really becoming sad.
Imagine believing in “the almighty God” while simultaneously believing that Joe Biden has the power to hurt, in any way, “the almighty God”.  The cognitive dissonance is real.
It’s hilarious how much these Libs hate truth, how brainwashed they are and controled by their Media Demi-gods. This Lib prob still thinks Biden’s mentally sound cuz MSM tells him so. Get ready for the “Trump’s not sound” 5th grade response.
I've said it, Trump is a cornered rat. He will say whatever warped twisted thought that enters his mind. If elected Biden will come to every house and kick your dog, and if you don't have one he will give you one, and then kick it! Trump is throwing his feces with both hands now!
Biden was once Vice President, so we already know he won’t take our guns or abolish police. I can’t believe your dummy supporters swallow this garbage.
And calling in a favor forcing a man who's sick to run for president because he was able to buy land in Wyoming and who's wife ask him to get a woman released from prison to take away black votes from Biden. It won't work
I'm not even convinced that Biden is the candidate that's running against Trump. I mean the guy is clearly incoherent/incompetent and on a major mental decline. I really think the dems have no strategy and are grasping at straws here.
Trump said Biden is going to take away God and guns....good! That’s one of many reasons why I’m voting for him.
Joe Biden owns guns dummy.  Bet Trump doesn't have any.
Damn, Biden sounds incredible. He can hurt GOD?
I don't know about the God thing... but Biden sure does want to take away some guns, and has made a big push for the green new deal... which would put 10's of thousands out of a job.  you know that though, but your job makes you a professional liar.
Trump Says He Wants Debates To Start Early Because Of Mail-In Voting
Example A.. No where did Biden say he will take all the guns away. He's starting shit right there. But he will say anything at this point to get back in the polls.
Our  is amazing &amp;  would be a strong VP partner for  But I believe our future currently depends on actively championing #RacialEquity in the White House with one of our strong and well-qualified #shortlisted #womenofcolor in 2020.
Any black person that votes for Joe Biden is a betrayal to the race. This man has screamed that he is racist several times and we still keep biting the bait. Systemic racism is a choice at that point.
dems need the burbs to win with Biden. this doesn't help.
Guys, Joe Biden is gonna use the black materia to summon meteor if he wins the presidency.
#BidenTornBetweenTwoSecucessors Considering his mental faculties are absent as well as his presence at the Wisconsin demoncratic convention(Obama/his handler) WON’T allow Biden to be present &amp; RISK ALL the underhanded deeds the Democratic Party has committed! 🇺🇸Vote TRUMP 2020🇺🇸
Biden is picking either Harris or Rice huh? Good. I still take Kamala but both are definitely qualified.
But will you help get him out by voting for Biden? Actually it’s not anyone’s business how people vote. I guess people want to know if you’ll be part of the solution or part of the problem.
Biden campaign ad spills beans on GM's future Corvette plans
So is Joe Biden gonna be part of the same strike team that plans on attacking and dethroning God or is he going to hurt God after the attacking and dethroning?
This year yes we have to. Besides Biden's worst compared nothing to Trump's worst
holy fuck joe biden is an absolute moron and the fact we are stuck between choosing one of these pedos is proof nothing is real
oh no. Hundreds of thousands of votes of ppl with families who hunt and fish who were gonna vote Biden (and who voted Trump last time!) are up in the air.
Aug 8th.   March to replace Biden with a better candidate so we can beat Trump.   Look for your local protest march against Biden.   #NeverBiden
I really hate this fucking arguement. Its literally a free country, you can vote for whoever the fuck you want to vote for. Biden is an Opp, Trump is an Opp, the Democrat and Republican Parties are all opps, fuck em’ both. Write in “The Rock” if you feel like it.
You absolutely have to debate if you're Biden. Terrible look if you don't and it plays right into Trump's hands. Yes, Trump wants to debate right now because he thinks he's mentally better than Biden. Time to prove him wrong.
Well I listen to a clip yrs ago about him wanting to bring Islam to public school. That’s on video.  He say anything to win.  He tries to be on both sides but stands for nothing. Worse D candidate of all time. How did he get in?  All the D and they end up with 77 yr old Biden
I honestly think Biden has extremely outdated an offensive views on the black community. I don’t think he’s a bar person. I just think he’s old and out of touch.
Biden is not going to move to the left. Did anybody even see his current ad where he is driving fancy ass car I mean seriously anybody that believes that Biden is going to move to the left is seriously naive if anything he will pander a little.
This guy passed the cognitive test with flying colors.  Here's video of him saying Biden will hurt Bible, hurt God and is Against God
This is the 3rd SC poll that puts biden in mid-single digits.
Now I have to do my WTAF moments for Biden?!?!?!
Trump says Joe Biden is stronger than God
Don’t talk about supporting progressive policies when your there falling in line telling others to do the same and saying that Biden is moveable and that next cycle we can maybe have the candidate of our choice really?
AT THIS MOMENT JOE BIDEN KNEW HE FUKT UP 😂😂😂😂
I mean I don’t get how this is the right thing to do wait around till next cycle to get Biden out instead of making demands I don’t get their whole shit strategy.
Are excluded from the conversation. Biden wouldn’t even support Medicare for All or Student Loan Cancellation? Oh but we all just have to deal with it like always wait around for Biden to do what exactly save the ACA go back to the Obama times slow changes and half measures.
No room to criticize Biden.
Trump is evil and shit but give us some sign that shit is going to change and that voters are being listened to cause as I see it right now Biden wins but what exactly is going to change for all of us who are out here barely making ends meet cause so far the poor/working class
Biden is the gift that keeps on giving. I would be so surprised if the DNC will allow this senile old coot to get the nomination.
Really don’t wanna vote for Biden but Tdog gtg.
Im sorry you all can go along with this shit I voted for Hillary in 2016 after being treated like shit by her supporters and there was never an apology from her or calls for her to call out her supporters. Now here we are doing this again but with Biden but instead Biden has
Honestly in the Settle with Biden and this Vote Trump Out shit bothers me why are progressives doing the work for him when he and his campaign should be doing the work.
They say that Biden is moveable when did he support progressive policies?
This bothers me. Basically the left falls in line again instead of demanding that Biden earn peoples votes. I live in Michigan and will be voting green and shaming those that vote green is  not it.
Or the 48th, if 45 resigns, Pence would be 46... Biden 47 and VP 48. ekk

This is the 2nd racist thing in 2 days for Biden.  If you legit believe that systemic racism is real, (personally I don’t but maybe you do) then Joe Biden is the face of it.

The Q community has a lot of good people. I agree with some of the criticisms of it though. I've been following "conspiracy theories" and the UFO phenomenon since the twin towers came down so Q hasn't done much for me. In the end, I'll support Trump over Biden any day.

Hey  Joe Biden spills the beans on all-electric Corvette that you've been predicting. Does Joe have it right? Biden:
Joe Biden should do the four corner offense and run the clock out. No need to debate as Joel can only lose points against that bombastic boorish rump Trump.
As predicted....
What is this idiot saying ? And this is who the left wants to deal with China ? He had 8 yrs and did Nothing! Now that Trump got tough Biden wants u to think it was him getting tough ! Lmao !
Lol Biden might be a weak candidate - that’s what this means - there I said it lmao
I say this with the deepet disrespect.  FUCK JOE BIDEN!
Joe Biden, after telling black people they're actually not black if their vote isn't cast for him, subtly gaslight them by suggesting they're not as diverse as Latinos.  Or he just gaffed again but is completely mentally competent.  Either way Joe's burying his own campaign.
no....the ANSWER is Biden, period!
I know not what will be the outcome of the debates.   But I do know that   A.) Biden will finger his own ass and smell it on stage.   And B.) Trump will use a catcher’s mit to make gross comparisons to Nancy Pelosi’s vagina.
Yeah, Biden is a complete mess.
I know none of us want trump, but we can acknowledge that Biden is racist as hell too right?
Biden campaign ad spills beans on GM's secret Corvette plans
All good questions. I also heard that people didn't fill it out because Trump or Biden wasn't on it. Lots of voters are in the habit of ignoring primaries or misunderstanding them.

Anybody wants to bet? 10 to 1.  If Biden wins. He will be re elected in 2024.   5 to 1 he will not finish 1st term if President.  4 to 1 within a yr it will be announce he has dementia.   3 to 1 its announce within the 2 yrs.
He better then Biden and Trump

He thinks its fine because it was his idea to try to siphon votes from Joe Biden. Trump is LOSING and he's desperate.
If Biden and Trump got in a fist fight on stage, what would their secret service teams do? Cuff them both?
Joe Biden can't wait to find out who his running mate will be.
Yes. Detroit area. Some big ones, too. Mostly homemade.   The Biden people need to be giving away signs. NOW
He is playing the long game while many people are focused on right now. Wake up and smell the coffee people, enough of the “Biden isnt much better” bs too these are the cards we’ve been delt, play accordingly
Sorry but Biden his campaign and the Dems are clowns if they wanted leftists/progressives to vote for them they would do better if they wanted unity they would not continue to talk shit about the left or do everything to stop progressive candidates and policies from winning
The only one who has a chance is Kara Eastman. Mike Siegal’s district won’t flip. Sarah is beating the brakes off Georgette Gomez and can fund a BIG field operation; as large as she wants and I don’t know who the last person is. Kara needs to get Biden supporters on her side in
Posting Fuck Donald Trump isn’t stopping that fucking nightmarish piece of shit there needs to be a plan to hold his ass accountable I am not seeing any of these settle with Biden people talking about they just believe that if we get him out shit is just going to stop being
Biden camp replies that what he meant to say was; "they all look alike". Nothing like handing #Drumpf a second term #Dems, this is looking worse than Hillary
Im sorry but this is not Biden doing the work. Has Biden even talked at all about defunding/abolishing ICE and releasing the immigrant children at the detention centers???????
[Biden takes both hands off wheel while "driving", turns completely to passenger seat camera] Look, folks...  Director: Uh, Mr. Biden. We've been over this.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden is racist but the people in America wants a president that tells the truth
How will Joe address the nation?   Other countries are going to be thinking is this all America can come up with.  300 million ppl and pick Biden who has dementia.  Poor joe this is to hard to grasp and trump haters is closing eyes to what visible
I don’t think anybody is advising him I think they are just letting him do whatever he wants. The campaign seems to not care their whole thing is we got to get Trump out vote for Biden cause he’s not Trump and that should be good enough it’s all very entitled and out of touch.
I just donated  to go to the fundraiser to hear from Biden and his new VP.  Jesus.
The problem is Biden doesn’t even know what he’s saying anymore.
Where are the demands from these progressive orgs telling us to settle for Biden that Biden start doing the work to earn our vote. We can’t just wait around while shit gets worst that’s some real privileged shit to tell someone who is struggling oh just wait around for Biden
Fortunately, there is a huge deficit to make up for. Bigger than the deficit he had with Clinton at this point. Biden's VP announcement should boost him, depending on who it is.   Picking Kamala Harris could destroy him in the Midwest.
Unless Biden wins... Then it's just swept under the rug.
I know they’re just polls etc. But that Collins # is really disappointing.
The best thing Biden can do is to not say anything bc every time this dude opens his mouth he says some stupid shit
Can #Trump or #Biden pronounce #supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ? That would be a good first #Debate2020 question.  #thursdayvibes
Wth is Biden talking about. This guy's a disaster!
Im sorry but no. Progressives/leftists should not have to do the work for Biden he should be out there doing everything to earn their vote.
I know you don’t like Trump, but if you really think Biden is better choice, then you have mental issues. Hatred aside, he’s done some good things in office. I smh sometimes too, however, I have seizures trying to understand Biden.
And as protestors destroy are ST and Nancy says “ppl will do as they do”. Nancy walking in China town.  WHO and D and Biden said Trump shouldn’t close flights.  The world hasn’t figure this out.  I can trust you too
to clarify, the reason joe biden was obama’s vp is *because* he is racist. the dnc is fine with this because they are very clearly also racist.
Bob pointed this out and I dunno why I missed it but Biden is still the "presumptive nominee" and it's August 6th  3 mos till the election...I dunno if I've seen that before. Something weird af is happening rn.
Im sorry but I will not be voting for Biden Vote Green. This whole wait till next cycle to get Biden out won’t cut it. Roots Nation should be demanding they replace him instead cause he is not it.
Go Trump Go! Imagine tricking libs into believing we shouldn't have debates. Lol. Keeping Biden hiding in the basement is the best tactic they have.
Joe Biden is trash
We've watched you bungle the job for years. We've seen Biden in office for decades. We don't need to watch him mop the floor with you to know he's the better candidate.
“The Biden campaign surge in fundraising the past couple of months has helped it narrow the Trump campaign’s once-massive cash on hand advantage.”  Could have just thanked Black Lives Matter donations instead of general “Grassroots donors”, Joe.   I wish that $$ went to the ppl!
Biden's favorite smooch.😝
Everytime I see a video of Biden saying some dumb shit, I'm just like:
Lame, Trump can't pronounce "YOSEMITE" &amp; that's a fact, not a fantasy like the goofy shit you type.  I don't give a fuck if Biden forgets his name, he's got my vote.

Do you think he has a chance at all? I love Doug Jones and he deserves his seat. I hope Biden gives him the AG position if he doesn’t win his seat back. He was a early endorser and I think he’ll get a position in the new admin.

Agreed. If Joe Biden can get 50% of the white vote he will win the biggest blowout in electoral history.
Trump will be hard to debate because he will say anything and deny any facts Biden presents.
They are both nearly equally terrible, obviously Trump is worse for human rights. But they're both pedos and in Trumps case a definite rapist. Biden could be as well we just don't know yet. And Biden is a huge unknown, he could be worse than we even imagined if he wins.
Yeah, I totally get that get that. And Trump is definitely a worse person than Biden, my tweet was mostly just referring to the fact that IF we had Trump another 4 years at least we'd be done with him after that.
Remember when the President Glitched out on TV in a Batman Comic.   - Biden 2020
That's not how I feel, I was just making a statement. I definitely don't prefer Trump to Biden.............. And I wasn't 100% serious about the Bernie tweet. It's Twitter.......  I really have no idea what to do so don't judge based on two tweets.
Biden is a lost cause.
There should not be a debate until Trump releases his tax returns. Period. If he doesn't, no debates. We know Joe Biden and he can go directly to the American people with his plans for the country. Trump wants a "Real Housewives..." show as a debate platform. He has nothing else.
The one-minute ad, which was shared exclusively with the  before its digital and television release on Thursday, is meant to drum up support among Black Americans, a key constituency for Biden. The ad, titled “Better America,” also takes a direct swipe at Trump.
What Vice President Biden team needs to do is forget about having debates, and just let Johnathan Swan of Axios interview 45, two (2) more times.

Biden needs to counter Trump propaganda with ads about  WHERE ARE TRUMP SCHOOL RECORDS, WHERE ARE HIS REAL HEALTH RECORDS, WHAT ABOUT TRUMP FAKE UNIVERSITY,  WHAT IS HE TRYING TO HIDE, WHY DO YOU NEED A NDA TO EXAMINE HIM OR HIS TAXES, Ect...  Come on Joe- HIT BACK!!!🤔

If you are looking at it as a lesser of two evils decision, then I get it. I can promise you a Biden presidency isn’t going to magically turn everything around. He will be a failure.
Honestly if we don’t see Biden and trump speak to each other on a debate stage then we shouldn’t have an election.   1. You should have to be able to defend your platform in a non-scripted setting   2. If either of them catch Covid let’s be fucking honest nobody is gonna cry

"Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report"
I can’t predict the future but Joe Biden does not seem to be a viable candidate to run this country in my eyes. I’m not trying to compare him to Trump, I’m trying to gauge his potential to be a good President. I do not see it.
Biden should refuse to debate until Trump releases them.
We should all be demanding that they replace Biden with Bernie cause this clown isn’t it.
So vote Trump out by giving Biden the nomination even though he did not deserve it and then make demands after he is elected as if Biden as if he is going to do anything what is this shit.
They don't want to admit that Joe Biden Isa is a terrible candidate with horrible policy. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
should we settle every single one of these leftist orgs should be demanding that Biden do the fucking work and if he is not willing to do that then call them all the fuck out call the party out and demand they fucking replace him.
Biden won’t even debate or be at the convention. I hate Trump I think he is garbage but how is doing the work for Biden and his campaign going to push him to the left Biden keeps being given everything he also keeps getting free passes for barely doing nothing.
Seeing so called progressives literally doing the work for Biden while Biden does absolutely nothing really bothers me. If you all want leftists to vote for Biden then deman he do the work and step it the fuck up.
I will be voting green cause honestly fuck Biden and the DNC.
So let me get this straight you are going to be doing the work for Biden to get progressives to vote for him. Why is everybody doing this for Biden????

What if Biden's been acting like he's in cog. decline so he doesn't have to stand trial for coming up with idea to use the Logan Act against incoming Pres Trump???  Don't put ANYTHING past the Democrats when power is on the line. They make actors in Pedowood look like amateurs.
Biden will beat Trump. I don’t like Biden, I do not think he will be a good President (Easily could be the worst President of all time), but he will beat Trump. Only way Biden loses is if he absolutely shits the bed on the debate stage. It would have to be a historic meltdown.

I feel like you’re wildly under-selling the amount of Americans who refuse to vote for Biden. It’s not just online smugbros, there’s a ton of ex-hippie boomers for example.  America will suck regardless, but Trump winning would make it a permanent, potentially world-ending  suck.
Congressman Khanna, you are more of a leader for the people than Biden or Harris will ever be. Please keep up your pressure if they get elected.

This should put to rest any notion that Biden doesn’t intend to act like he’s the president when he’s the president.

Biden is a warmonger who along with Obama/Hillary invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and fueled Syrian/Yemeni war and sent American soldiers to fight useless wars. How is any of that showing empathy and leadership?
A vote for Biden is a vote supporting his warmongering with Obama, their invasion of Libya, their drone bombing in seven countries and the death of 100,000 brown people. F off with your democracy. A vote for Biden is a vote for war and murder.
Edgy take of the day:  "We are bombarded by death, disease and the dawning of a new Great Depression. . . . But as a silver lining, we no longer have to suffer the bullshit of presidential campaign reporting."  -- Hamilton Nolan,
It’s cool. Biden/Obama led Libyan invasion, drone bombed seven countries, fueled arms to Syria/Yemen conflict and led to 100,000 dead brown people. So if you vote for Biden, I consider you having voted to bomb brown people.

Dems aren’t “looking for the perfect candidate.” If this was any other country progressives like Bernie wouldn’t even be the same party as Biden. We don’t want the perfect candidate. We just want a candidate period. I’m voting for Biden but Biden is not progressives’ candidate.
Btw I’m still begrudgingly voting for Biden. Not sorry. If you can’t acknowledge Trump is worse than Biden you need let go of your inflated image driven ego and learn to think critically. Stay mad
I live voting for Biden on “polls” hahaha. Trump 2020!
Biden is whatever I don’t like
They probably have Biden signs in their yard! Hiden Biden!
These polls suggest that Biden has a lock on the popular vote, and an almost certain lock on a November victory. State polls suggest the same. He's ahead of Trump by 6 points or so in Michigan, for example.

Nope, but Biden has put Texas in play.
Biden and Harris for 2020
Biden good,  trump very, very horrible traitor.
I hope someone makes a digital animation of a Biden/Harris train, because wowie.
I just saw the gal bullying the 12 y/o and I’m leaving it on Coward’s Ratio look up my likes if you want to find it. Like listen man, I get you’re that mad about Biden and Kamala....I don’t know how to finish that sentence.
Joe Biden Calls For Nationwide Mask Mandate 'Immediately'
Of course. Plus she deserves it. My guess though is Biden will lose more white votes than the black votes he gains. I hope I am wrong.
He talks out of both sides of his mouth. One time he says one thing. Then five minutes later he's saying something different. And he can't stand it when Biden is right and he's not.  Trump has to be center of attention for everything. He can't stand it when Biden or Harris talk.
I think it's the opposite. The people who aren't partisan are going to see that even Biden partisans believe Trump's talking point that Biden isn't up for it.
There is nothing that undermines Biden more than this obsession that he won't be president for 4 years and probably run for reelection.
Where's Biden?
What’s the point anyway?  Biden will do what he wants so Ro’s vote against the platform means nothing.
And yet Biden is a big enough man and ethical leader to choose someone as his running mate that doesn’t always pander to him. This is a refreshing change! We will have better outcomes in leadership when we are permitted a diversity of ideas and solutions.
Tax reductions seem unlikely given the enormous fiscal response to the Covid-19 business disruptions. Biden’s tax plan offers a glimpse of what we may be facing in 2021 and beyond.
Dolly Parton should be the Secretary of Humanity in the Biden Administration.
when u talk of Stock Market share how many people are in the stock Market incl pension funds. In addition, when Biden Harris say they would Mandate Nationally - it is an example of the Nanny State and Dems plan to have Govt Control over everything eg zoning Suburb 1/2
Trump is already blaming Biden for everything and calling him a liar... also said number 1 in the world for Ventilators?!... please end this shit #TrumpKillsUSPS #TrumpThreatensAmerica
It's already collapsed and the world is already laughing. It's time for a Biden rebuild.
Yep a very cynical ploy by Trump. Vote for Joe Biden!
I think Biden is better than Trump that’s it. I don’t like Biden he’s just the better of the two shitty candidates.
Thank you for agreeing with me. You’re right, you weren’t talking about Biden’s covid response, but you quoted my tweet about Biden’s covid response with a completely new topic and acted like my tweet you quoted was in opposition of your comment. Be honest in your discourse plz
Has Joe Biden congratulated Trump on the historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates?
My super power would be to snap us right to Jan21, 2021 for Biden’s inauguration.
Hey Kamala Harris, Care to explain why prison stocks rose, as soon as u were announced as Biden’s running mate? Or are u just gonna continue doing what your doing at the expense of others. I hate choosing the lesser of two evils
I always wonder how tf Trump shoves Big Macs down his gullet every day and has even lived this long. What kind of sick joke is the universe playing? And Biden looks like he could croak literally any second. It’s the same feeling of waiting for the screensaver to hit the corner.
#SayHisName  it's sad i have to hear about this on twitter i guess the news is to busy bashing joe biden.
Amazing to see a so-called Christian call out the faith of Joe Biden (a regular Catholic churchgoer) while embracing #ImpotusAmericanus who has trampled every teaching of Jesus Christ!!! Absolute hypocrisy!!! #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide
In short, fascism won’t be changed in one election, but we can chip away at it by voting in the direction that we want. Like it or not(and I fucking hate it) Biden is our most progressive VIABLE candidate. And that sucks ass but it’s reality.
And look at the fact that RBG’s term is ending. You DO NOT want trump to be in command when it’s time for her to be replaced... anyway, my point is no voting for Biden won’t immediately change anything but it will make it easier to get the change we want to see in the future
One single person to take command of everything. Look at Trumps cabinet and how damaging they have been to the country. Let’s be honest here, Biden probably isn’t going to even live through his full term. But the cabinet he puts in will have be way better than the current one
Future that I would want to see, NOT because Biden represent the future I want to see, but because if he gets elected Trump will be out office. My main focus is just getting trump out of there ASAP because he can’t handle this pandemic. Biden sucks but he at least will be able to
With that out of the way let’s address the second thing you said. I’m not claiming voting for Biden will end the oligarchy. Not even close. Voting for one candidate can’t accomplish that, but that’s not the goal of voting for him... voting for him is just one step toward the
Is biden harris having one at 5 20
Since you decided to share a definition with me earlier I think it’s only fair I get to do the same. You still keep straw Manning my arguments. Trump is demonstrably worse than Biden. I don’t like Biden. I think we can agree that we need to abolish the two party stystem right?
The Biden campaign is looking more and more like "Weekend at Bernies."
America makes progress after kicking and screaming and whining, but progress is made just the same. We need to work to make sure the Trump years were just a blip of “waaa we don’t wanna” sandwiched between Obama and Biden/Harris, with a more just and equal America for everyone.
2/3 let Voters exactly what Harris/Biden promised Dem Voters-    Get  info on Harris re not prosecuting Catholic Church abusers &amp; his documents- how she went after Sickle Cell Student then talk to
attack Harris’/ Biden’s Primary positions! Why, bec Harris will certainly take over from Biden- then will push her own agenda - if Biden wins and can remain Pres for 1st term - I believe he will resign near the end so Kamala will be Pres leading into the  election 1/3
Okay that’s not a good thing, but that’s child’s play compared to systematically destroying the USPS in the middle of a global pandemic. Not even in the same realm. Like I said, Biden isn’t good, but Trump is off the charts fascist. It’s not even a comparison.
okay then i don’t wanna hear shit about progressives or “bernie bros” losing biden the election in november. y’all don’t want or need our votes but then blame us for everything when shit goes south. and for the record I still am voting for biden.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Yes and I’m choosing to vote for the guy who’s not actively engaging in voter suppression(fascism). Don’t get me wrong I can’t stand Biden or Harris, but we can’t let Trump erode our democracy another 4 more years
Fantastic 2 days of introducing Biden/Harris! Speeches brought tears of joy. Truth, empathy &amp; plans for America! Bravo team, well done!
One Tough Question For DOJ If Biden Is Elected: Whether To Prosecute Trump

Oh, “it’s on” alright. Pence has no idea. He hasn’t a hope in hell. 🇺🇸 #biden Harris
Says it all. Simple as that. Biden/Harris 🇺🇸#freep #detnews #PureMichigan #BidenHarris
So did The Simpsons predict a Biden/Harris ticket and were they in the white house, we need to know
*herman laying in peace*  Biden: kamala is my running mate  Herman:
Bernie: sets of easy to digest plans with bills backing them up  Biden: I’m gonna restore the soul of America and I’m not Trump. C’mon man!
I’m been trying to convince my socialist friends to settle for Biden for months, and this short video makes me want to stop that.   Shane, go phone bank for Joe, rather than shit talk leftist who have legit reservations on how bad the Dems are.
Not sure what that has to do with anything. Biden being old just means that he's from a different generation than the populist wing, which was true for HW too
By the way Biden's is obviously George HW Bush, who was the VP of a popular more conservative president and fought of a conservative populist in the primaries.
The weirdest part of 2020 is that Joe Biden essentially dominated his primary, is up 7, and his supporters don't expect him to really be president, as if this hasn't been something he and his circle have wanted for 40 years.
I think it’s great they asked a respected Republican governor to endorse Biden at the DNC. And it’s spelled soul.
just watched your show. I loved how Biden teed up the mispronunciation of Kamala for you. I laughed out loud
Everyone is saying "what are we supposed to vote for t*ump now?" Like no ofc not but its also not bad to recognize and understand what harris and biden have done. Honestly no one's going to be happy but just vote for Biden and Harris and understand that they both suck ass
⁦ Dude, you do know, if Biden wins he won’t take the Oval Office until next January 20, right? Not this November, as you have in this story. Seriously? For shame. And your copy editor should be fired.
The point I'm making is that Biden/Harris have a better chance of helping someone.
I feel you, I understand the gravity of it all. I can’t vote for a guy just because he’s not another guy. So I either stay home, or write in Andrew yang. Biden is more of the same and will usher in someone even worse than Trump
But I read the KH IS not a far left progressive. She’s closer to cent where Biden is. Warren would have been far left.
I get Trump’s an idiot. But this is decency? Biden/Obama invaded Libya illegally, dropped record drone bombs on 7 countries, fueled Syrian/Yemeni conflict with arms and left 100,000 dead brown people. Seriously wondering if humanity doesn’t extend to non-Americans.
Bleeding liberal here. Biden/Obama admin invaded Libya illegally, dropped record drone bombs on 7 countries, fueled conflict in Yemen and Syria and left 100,000 brown ppl dead. But sure, speaking well is so important you forget about war and murder.
I get you can’t vote for Trump. I’m a liberal too. But calling Biden decent and humane? Obama/Biden invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries in record numbers, fueled Yemen and Syrian conflict and left 100,000 dead brown people. Does your humanity not extend to brown ppl?
No new country was invaded for the first time this century.  The Dems savage Trump for being a “threat to humanity”  100,000 brown people died from Obama/Biden wars and drone bombing in Libya, Syria &amp; Yemen.  The Dems? Endless praise and voting for more.  Posturing assholes
When we read this headline.   BIDEN/HARRIS WIN WHITE HOUSE.
Ok, I had a tear in my eye listening to both speeches. It was hope for what’s likely to come. Biden was good, but Harris was stellar.
After the 50th lie poured out of Biden’s mouth, I had to change the channel. Therefore never heard a single word Harris had to say; oh well. No loss.
My mistake Cher.  That's supposed to say if there is one. Cher. Do yo think your friend Joe Biden is going to be President? Just curious Cher.  Me I have this really really good feeling that he will be.  And my feelings usually have been accurate. So now do you think he will be?
Question: Obama/Biden invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries, fueled conflict in Yemen and Syria and led to 100,000 dead brown people. Does compassion only extend to American people? How can a liberal vote for this warmongering?
I understand you’re excited. But where’s the justice for the 100,000 people who died from Obama/Biden invasion into Libya, drone bombing seven countries and fueling arms to destroy Yemen? Does compassion and healing not extend to brown people, Rabbi?
Because, for better or worse, the model is now becoming a major part of the story. You can't reliably model this election, but now people will think Biden has an easy path. They shouldn't, but we know they will, which makes the model a significant variable.
missing major point &gt; the Media is going to be working w Biden Harris - and will cover for them - they will have 98% media support
The presidential race has really heated up now that Harris will run as Biden's VP, but there is still work to be done now and well after Nov. ➡️Communities of color are still asking for police reform/abolishment ➡️The injustice to Breonna Taylor has yet to be rectified (1)
Wow Harris and Biden huh, that’s pretty cool :) love the direction our country is going
The truth about Biden's tax plan
This #nastywoman will vote for Biden-Harris 2020. Vote Blue if you’re Nasty!
Yeah, but is Biden a Slytherin or a Gryffindor? These are the important questions we should be asking.
VP Biden and Sen Harris are both centrist Democrats  🤦🏻‍♂️
Without guns maybe Dick wouldn't shoot people by mistake. And...the taxes are mostly on the Rich. The stocks will crash  again in the Fall due to COVID. Biden can't raise taxes anyway until things get better. The GOP takes from the Poor and working poor and gives to the Rich.
Occultists: I am the embodiment of an ever-changing universe, a supernatural alchemist capable of transmutation of soul, an infinite capacity for change, nothing is beyond my power.  People: We know it's terrible but please vote for Biden/Harris  Occultists: Sorry, can't do it.
Don’t care for Biden, didn’t vote for him, blah about Harris, but like to say they’re the same is a quantum LEAP
I can’t wait to vote Biden/Harris in November!!!
I was talking to a few of my neighbors last night, they support Biden, and one of them said she worried what white men will think about Harris. I said I don’t give a shit what white men think, I care about what black women think. #BidenHarris2020
Typical Donald 🤪. Notice he called her nasty and mean ... he insults all women. I think he meant she was HIS number one pick for Biden. As in "the worst pick".
Attacks on Joe Biden have fallen flat so those hoping for his failure—progressives and conservatives alike—are targeting Kamala Harris with sheer aggression and malice.
55 Things You Need to Know About Kamala Harris - POLITICO
Trump is 3 years younger than Biden..weighs 75 pounds more..Biden can ride a bicycle..Trump would die within 30 seconds trying to ride a bicycle..so the death mongering is ridiculous..
So you don’t care about the warmongering from Biden/Obama admin that invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and led to 100,000 brown people dying? You dont care about dead brown people? you don’t care about innocents being jailed under Kamala?
Joe Biden is a secret Muslim? What happened? Did Obama secretly convert him? Did Obama convert Biden over to Marxism as well? Is Scranton, PA really part of America? Joe! Where's your birth certificate?
Yes!!!  Is that suppose to scare us? That’s part of why I am voting for Biden/Harris.
If Biden can get passed it, we can as well. They are working together to govern.
We are not listening to anything coming from a Biden camp.
The real sad thing about this Biden/Harris ticket is that as a Palestinian there really is no good option for president. Both candidates and their VPs are unabashedly pro-Israel and don't even attempt to hide it with the typical two state solution lines.
“Geography matters less than it used to in the general scheme of things,” Ms. Rizzo said. “She is the daughter of immigrants. Florida is a state of immigrants.” Counting on Fl! #BidenHarris2020
Times up for Trump for sure, but a tough on crime prosecutor and Pro Police Biden? Not sure It's going to be a great thing for BLM. Definitely a team that I will be closely evaluating over the next 4 years.
You will never ever ever get a perfect politician. There will never be a garden of eden so to speak, but you can vote people in and work towards change. Biden 2020!
AND still voting for Biden/Harris
So many wonderful jobs open for so many wonderful people with the Biden administration 🇺🇸 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBidenHarris2020
Right! Biden proved he’s a real man.
“ sent word to Biden’s team that while she was flattered, she no longer wanted to be considered for the running mate slot, according to a high-ranking Democrat familiar with the process. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman”
You actually asked Joe Biden that Cher? What was his answer? You couldn't be any happier Cher.  Im as happy as a clam or better. Look I'll show you how happy I am that Joe picked Kalama. 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😛😛🤩🤩😀😀😀😅😅😅😄😄😁😁😁😁😆😆😆😆😆🙃🙃🙃🙃😜😜😜😜. I even did a flip.
Loved meeting you back in 2018 Abdul. I think you’re right on this. I hope you also keep forcefully pushing the Biden campaign on Medicare4all since that is one of the main reasons I was a huge supporter of you back then.
Biden had a cheat sheet on his desk so he wouldn’t forget where he was. Also, is holding the phone upside down. . .
I wince when I hear people who support abolition movements toward ICE and defunding the police cheering on Biden's VP pick, who will set those movements back a generation. #KamalaHarris
You LIAR Biden is not against NRA yes background test and Ar47, etc
Umm, lemme handle this one tomorrow. After Biden/Kamila day.
Am I naive or did Biden's team do a great job keeping a secret? Patriots used to do it. Back in the old days.
Every Dem who has opinion about Biden and Harris:   Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.   You’re arguing about a fart when someone shit on your white carpet and then walked through it 9,428,016 times.   Grow up.
I know isn't great Cher.  Im so so happy. I tweeted her to send my congratulations to her. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are to do a great job. In fact they right now doing a great Birthday. Trump is already running scared. He knows that Biden has the upper hand and may just win.
Amen, Jason. Amen. With Biden in the WH, Elizabeth Warren will have her day. Good things ahead. We just need to get out the vote. 🇺🇸#BidenHarris #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt
Was......Ridin with Biden:-(((( til he chose Krapala
I hope you will run again for Governor of Georgia again or take a Cabinet position in the Biden administration.
I feel like she's a good antithesis to Biden, and that they can round each other out a little more. I think she'll help capture more voters who want somebody with a harder edge.
Not only is  incredibly smart and thoughtful, she’s a great mentor for so many Latinas in politics. The Biden-Harris team is in good hands! #TheFutureIsLatina
I sincerely hope you will be part of Biden administration in order to bring back the level of intelligence, dignity, moral character and honesty this country enjoyed during the Obama years, then we can truly make America again.
I want the two party system dismantled and new people brought into office more than anything, but when our currently leader is beginning to mimic HITLER? there’s only so much you can do.  I will be voting Biden and Harris in November, because I’m scared not to. you should be to.
This isn't the first time that the GOP has outright lied about what our candidates have said. Just the other day, Michigan Republicans said that Biden wants to defund the police–when he has literally said the opposite in a June 10th Op. Ed.
I'm sick of people telling me to vote for Biden because he can be dragged to the left. The DNC rigged 2 primaries to avoid progressive policy. They sure as hell aren't going to cave to it when they are in power! #VoteGreen2020 #GreenMovement #DemExit2020
I already know Biden/Harris isn’t the most ideal ticket right now. I voted for Bernie Sanders and I held out hope Biden would choose Warren as his VP. Don’t want to hear any negativity now. I just want you to vote for #BidenHarris so we can #DumpTrump
If you are spending today not criticizing the literal warmonger Biden who invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and left behind 100,000 dead brown people, quit with your social media posturing.
My dream was Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang and here we are with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris...
How did ‘holding them accountable’ work when Biden/Obama invaded Libya leaving thousands dead or drone bombed seven nations? There ain’t no excuse to vote for a war criminal. Atleast Trump hasn’t invaded a new country.
Biden/Obama bombed seven countries, destroyed Libya and drone bombed merrily. Kamala prosecuted innocent people. You don’t have to do this. Disagreements are fine but not with a warmonger and a criminal top cop.
More important question: Why did she endorse Biden after calling him a racist segregationist and saying she believes the women who accused Biden of sexual misconduct?
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate
okay in all seriousness kamala was a dogshit pick even before police brutality came up in the discourse again. her history as prosecuter, DA and AG is a bad look but is great when juxtaposed with “minimum sentencing” biden, the DNC continuing to push lukewarm dipshits who are...
This ad is basically an own goal, eh.  So far, you've spotted Biden/Harris 3 goals and there's 8 minutes left in the 3rd period.
Biden picking Harris as his VP is the most bone headed, tone deaf move he could have possibly made. He just made it way harder for me and I’m sure many other true progressives to want to vote for him.
Okay. All hands on deck. What Joe wants Joe gets! Biden/Harris it is 🇺🇸 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #BidenHarris2020
Hi I'm just tweeting you to CONGRATULATE you on recieving the highest honor for any woman thus far.  Joe Biden selected you to be his running mate. That is great news. You and Joe Biden will make a great team as our President ( Joe Biden ).
Yes Cher this is a time to celebrate and dance around with love in our ❤❤❤❤💘💘. Because it is the day that Former Vice President Joe Biden selected Sen Harris as his running mate. All of us woman should all go and play your song WOMANS WORLD.  It would sound perfect now.
Until Kamala Harris comes out and honestly explains why she refused to pursue and prosecute Steve Mnuchin the head of our treasury for gaming for closures when he was at One  West I will not vote for Biden
It's a good ticket and it shows Biden has a thick skin. I like the idea of a cabinet of rivals, historically it has resulted in great leadership.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Congratulations to Senator  I think this is an excellent choice. #BidenHarris2020
Biden-Harris for the WIN!
Mannn Biden got me scratching my head
Horrible decision I will not vote for Biden!
Fun fact: Joe Biden's first choice for VP was John W. Davis.
Until Kamala Harris explains why she did not prosecute Steve Mnuchin for gaming foreclosures with One West which incurred company fines to the tone of 100M dollars, I will not be voting for Biden.  Of all the qualified and incredible running mates, he chose the poorest candidate!
The NRA has nothing to worry about your safe. It’s everything else Biden and Harris get their hands on we need to worry about. Lucky for us Trump will be re-elected no worries.❤️🇺🇸
She couldn’t beat Bernie. Or Biden. She will be destroyed
Things that are infinitely more surprising that Biden’s VP pick: Milo’s DNA test results!
And with KH at his side Biden can remain the statesman that’s restrained him because KH has proven attack and destroy skills. I may have preferred our Michigan governor, But we get to keep her! For now at least until cabinet choices come up...
Biden couldve picked teddy ruxpin as his vp and hed have my vote by default
I’m stoked for a Biden/Harris ticket. Imagine competent leadership!
Be honest, the only good thing to come out of a Biden win is that we end Trump. And that is definitely good. But don’t pretend like our so called democracy will be better. We will still have perpetual war, poor healthcare, income inequality &amp; abusive cops.
I heard Trump warns we will have to take our Castor Oil if Biden wins. The giant Little Rascal tablespoon size.
I can't wait for VP Harris to be the girl power face of what's sure to be a brutal, sustained, and punitive crackdown on protests using faceless federal troops the SECOND Biden wins. Assuming he does of course, and that's no slam dunk.
I bought a Biden/Harris campaign button a month ago. Got my wish. Thank you!

In November, we're going to elect Biden/Harris, flip the Senate, retain the House, and gain in State Legislatures.
REPORT: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Just waiting for Biden to announce Hillary in blackface as his VP nominee to really put a cap on this day.
He has taken more action than ANY world leader and was the first to do so. Democrats including Biden called him racist for shutting our borders to China and Europe long before anyone else did. We also quarantined before any other country. Stop watching CNN.

Based on the convention’s line-up, reason makes me believe  that these people will not be Biden’s pick. What do you think? #BidenVP
Big homeless numbers, big numbers of people camping out for food donations, big numbers of people unemployed,big numbers of people sick&amp;dying of Covid. Big numbers of people frustrated w/ your incompetent, divisive, corrupt, BS. BIG NUMBERS OF PEOPLE SICK OF U &amp; VOTING FOR BIDEN
So sad. I saw a campaign called “settle for Biden”. Settle. I still can’t understand if they’re serious or it is in jest. That’s the 2020 election in a nutshell
This is a really narrow-minded tweet. Biden’s pick isn’t about sending a message to black women or white women. His pick will be based on who he trusts the most and clicks with. All of the woman are incredible. Stop trying to divide. We need to rally around Biden and his pick!
I think through this pandemic, she HAS shown that she has what it takes. Why can’t this just be about Democrats rallying around whoever Biden chooses? At the end of the day, this person will be who he clicks with the most. Every one of those women are qualified.
trump will never do it.  The day after Biden is inaugurated, it needs to happen so kids can get a month and a half of regular school in and we can start to get back to normal.
what is Biden afraid- let voters have as much info as possible move up the one debate or    Ask   to do a debate before 1st votes - use video for Biden and use his own Primary words to respond to questions when it is his turn
Did you see the info babe's eyes lift when she said the Chinese want Joe Biden?
So, Trump just said that the 1917 (née 1918) pandemic "probably ended the second World War. All the soldiers were sick." I'm sorry, but if you still support him after everything that's happened, you're not just stupid, you're hopeless. Don't give me any bullshit about Joe Biden.
Whitmere, Warren, Wilma Flintstone, or whomover...Biden still gets my vote!
Trump should spy on the biden campaign. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Biden was always goofy Joe. 30 years ago, he was claiming someone else's boyhood history as his own, for example. He's a bit worse now. We're not really electing him, of course, but whoever we think is pulling the strings. Maybe that'll be the VP?

If I had the exact same opinion of Donald trump and Joe Biden (which I don’t), the tweeting alone would be justification enough for me to vote Biden.

You're doing the same stuff the wallstreet journal did to pewdiepie? But you don't think young people are going to see through that? HA!
It made be crystal clear to us, but I think, at least to Joe Biden, he is blind to it! Or at the very least not consciously aware?

Postal carriers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake
I understand you live in fear and sound foolish.   Facts are facts. Trump wins we start nominating a progressive 2 years before 2024 election.  If Corporate puppet Biden wins we waste a decade on this pos corporate owned pimp.   Why waste any more than 2 years on this?
It really does.  If Trump wins 2 years from now we start nominating a progressive. If Biden wins a decade is wasted on shitty Centrist Corporate owned puppets.
Pick Trump. In 2 years we can nominate a Progressive. If Biden wins a decade is wasted on Corporate Puppets.
The day after Michigan Bernie's campaign was saying he wouldn't dropout ( It was over
Joe Biden had a major rally in Detroit on March 9 and then trounced Bernie the next day in Michigan. There was nobody saying postpone the primary. Nobody wearing masks voting. COVID hitting ended Bernie's hopes to drag things out for delegates.
I'm afraid that come november, even if Biden gets elected, people are going to assume they can sit back and stop protesting for important causes because the president will "fix everything" which is NOT the case. Regardless of who wins, don't stop fighting. They won't change
Vote for Biden anyway.  Count on Biden to put together a team of advisors that he will actually listen to.  He’s not going in thinking he has to know everything.  He just has to know how to lead.  Besides we have a better shot at surviving the next 4 years with Biden for Prez.
If I have to stand there 24 hours to vote for Biden, I will!

I love that the bar is so low that Biden can tweet out about just basic human decency and people will quote tweet it like “THIS is what we need in a president”
Joe Biden is going to force our children to read the Curand (muslim bible) in schools.
R: Don’t vote for Biden, he’s a pedo.   D: Don’t vote for Trump, he’s a pedo.   That’s a fucking issue.
Joey Two Times Biden
I love your posts and not looking to argue..... Joe Biden isn’t intelligent enough to have written the Patriot Act.  Corporate interests wrote it and had Biden claim he wrote it. Then lobbyists threatened to primary anyone who dared to vote against it.
. JOE BIDEN IS NOT IN CHARGE DID OBAMA HAVE ANY THING TO DO WITH THIS WOMAN'S POSITION?                                           Vote:  REPUBLICAN  2020 - 2022
Do you want to lose your social security? Trump wants to end it. Biden voted to cut it 4 times.
Ever wonder why American Presidents are prohibited from taking monies or lavish gifts from foreign countries?  Because it compromises them.  Biden has been compromised by American corporate interests as well as Ukraine who gifted his moron son millions of dollars.
We’re on the same side here Joe. Just everyday we see Biden’s dumbass and I think what could’ve been instead. Doesn’t mean I’m not also aware of everything else. I’m allowed to be upset with the DNC.
the better candidates to win. Then will guilt you to vote for their shitty candidate. Im aware of the bigger issues, it only took me 5 seconds to make that tweet. You can continue to have your head up the DNC’s ass and be happy with candidates like Biden but I wont 🐑
Of course. Plus she deserves it. My guess though is Biden will lose more white votes than the black votes he gains. I hope I am wrong.
He talks out of both sides of his mouth. One time he says one thing. Then five minutes later he's saying something different. And he can't stand it when Biden is right and he's not.  Trump has to be center of attention for everything. He can't stand it when Biden or Harris talk.
Change is happening  We will get better president for 2020 . Joe Biden for the win 💁🏼‍♀️🙏🏻
r u kidding, the demon'crats will do anything to win  elections...how do people like Whitmore...the squad..polosi..Schumer  ..Schiff.. problem child M. Watters..shit for brains the thief biden...Kamala the mirror fake news Harris ...who votes for these pos...they cheat !
thanks so much, Angela... 😊
Everything is going to come out IF we can successfully elect Biden/Harris. The Trumpublicans and Trump syndicate WILL see PRISON! That's why this is all or nothing for this corrupt regime! Vote! No matter how you do it! Vote!
Like I keep telling people: you ain’t voting for Biden, you’re voting for RBG’s replacement - For starters.  Like do people have any idea how much damage DeVos did to the educational system and the students in less than four years?!
I am  And she’s a evil witch! She is not good for anything but starting trouble with racism! She’s very good at that ! Why do they say she’s black when her notionally is different! Please answer this!And you know Biden is not all their!
Vote for Biden/ Harris.What have you got to lose?
Lol. Time will tell cuz Biden is winning
Biden will lock Trump,in the bunker.
Every time you feel the urge to take a shot at Biden or Harris, redirect that shit toward Trump. There is a country to save.

My father (MI) Trump My mother (MI) Trump My step father (MI) Trump My uncles (IN) Trump My my aunts (IN) Biden Myself (Macomb County) Biden My wife (Macomb County) Biden My mother in law (MI) Biden My father in law (MI) Trump
I never said it did.  To me voting Green is a way not to vote for Biden or Trump.  I am voting Trump. A vote he should never have got and a vote Joe is expecting based on my voter registration.
I respect your point of view. The corporate interests used millions to insert their corporate puppet and set back the progressives movement.  I would hate it if I voted green and Biden won.  A vote for trump is most revolting thing I can do to the cheating DNC.
Yep a very cynical ploy by Trump. Vote for Joe Biden!
Can someone tell me one good thing about Biden?
I am voting trump because I hate Corporate owned puppets. Those folks are Republicans who like to feel good about themselves pretending to care about the less fortunate.   If trump wins in two short years we start nomination process. If Biden wins a decade is wasted.
I appreciate your point of view.    I am voting trump.   Why?  If Biden wins we don’t have a primary in 2024.  To hell with that. Four more years of trump is a million times better than a waste of ten years with Biden.
Biden / Harris ... lock em up
Per Biden's rule, perhaps you're not really Latino. 😉
That’s understandable because BIDEN did not pick her. The leftists who pull his strings picked her.
Biden voted against the working class from 73-2009. He voted for cutting social security 4 times. He was for such liberal favorites as Citizens United. He is for no Wall Street or Banking super vision.   Which of those is driving you to vote Joe?  What votes Joe made do you like
He can reach into my pants. What does that even mean?  For 47 years he voted with GOP. Now a ten minute talk to Bernie and all is well?    Hell no buddy.  Never Biden.
I’m obviously bored here and am immaturely splitting hairs here but Biden served from 73-09 as a “ Republican “ err democrat Senator. 47 years in DC.  Shitty 47 years.  As you can tell I’m bored.  Take care
Prison populations will explode if people are dumb enough to fall for her and Biden’s bullshit
Ending the ACA is step 1 in implementing Medicare for All.  No problem so far.   Seriously Biden is the least attractive bring nothing to the table candidate in more than 50 years.  His nomination and failure to get elected will sadden so many Centrists. Thoughts and Prayers
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
“Biden believes in killing babies at 9 months” God I don’t have the mental capacity for this today.
She signed to agree with Trump on more than a few unsavory issues, and with the “Defund the police” sentiment being so strong atm it’s just another example of Biden being shortsighted in the face of his goals. “I Need to get my black vote back up, get a black lady right?” Wrong1
Not to me.  Biden is a Corporate owned puppet.  No Medicare for all no vote for Joe.
Look at the big picture.  Bernie had largest crowds at every rally. Huge stadiums at times.  Biden had a rally today. 63 folks showed up. Corporate interests are saving millions for themselves nominating Biden. I would rather lose to trump than be cheated by the DNC again.
Funny how trump gave the 1% a permanent tax cut. The rest of us got a small temporary cut. Now he is making up stuff about Biden. Remember when Obama/Biden fixed the economic mess left by Bush? I guess Biden will have to clean up an even bigger mess this time. #TrumpDepression
Ma’am I’ve got many history books. Ever notice in school they never mentioned Nixon?  The history books our kids get in school is the history corporate America wants our kids to believe.   100 of the richest Americans forced Biden on us. We will do all we can to beat him
The Biden campaign is looking more and more like "Weekend at Bernies."
I watched this multiple times. You're missing the point. Biden can disagree with somebody &amp; realize they have a lot to offer even if they have a different opinion on something. This is leadership  &amp; Character.   Donald Trump will fire you if you disagree with his ideas.
I’d  care if Corporate interests didn’t nominate Biden.  DNC cheats us. Then cry’s when GOP cheats them.
You should spend some time doing research before you blast out comments on Twitter. It's clearly documented that Joe Biden grew up with his stuttering problem.  Biden has overcome his insecurities about stuttering. Trump has never overcome his insecurities resulting in narcissism
I won’t vote for Biden
Per this debate video on June, 2019, #KamalaHarrisVP skewered &amp; grilled #BidenCoalition?!? WTHeck. 😲 Now, they are Friends?  Fishy. Slimy.   Kamala Harris confronts Joe Biden in tense exchange on race relations  via
No thanks Sir.  Corporate interests inserted their puppet Biden into the nomination.  Maybe 2024. Good luck.
So what are you saying?  Sounds like your saying “ Bernie raised funds, Wall Street won’t allow him to win.  You are voting Biden.  I think that is what your saying.  I respect your decision. 👍🏻.  It’s a free country.  I’m voting against Biden the corporate selected nominee.
If this is true then donald trump and biden both have an IQ of 228
Well duhhh!  Exact reason I’m asking Green voters to vote trump.  Keep worthless corporate owned Biden out of office all together.   Ten steps ahead of you there.
Hell know to Biden and Harris!
So did The Simpsons predict a Biden/Harris ticket and were they in the white house, we need to know
DOJ? PFFT. Please with a criminal as AG. I can't wait to see these criminals go to prison. Biden has already said he will not stand in the way of investigation and incarceration of these criminals.
I know folks not voting for Trump, but it has the feel of a bit larger Trump win than ‘16. I think Trump is the beneficiary of the pandemic lockdowns, followed by BLM riots and a cognitively challenged Biden!
If Biden wins, Trump will be spending 2021 in court and potentially jail. If he wins and they lose control of the senate, Pence will be President because Trump will be removed.
Biden/Harris 2020 on you bitch ass niggas
Obama Biden sold 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia and personally profited from the sale. Just like you profited from Ukraine and China.
Wouldnt someone who champions Biden and the cop be outing themselves as well?
Awesome!!!! GO BIDEN AND HARRIS!!
Netflix is not a propaganda machine? I mean, Obama is part of netflix is he not?  Yes the US (cia..intelligence agencies)have done and allowed some creepy things...u see Trump is cleaning out deep state  pedophiles, thieves like biden, child traffickers...that's why trumps hated
Yeh...just like the deep state dumbasses biden..Harris...Schumer..Pelosi...r going to "really" change things for the better...this time.. really ? just vote for Trump..do yourself &amp; your family a favor...Trump has done more in 3  years than the last 4 puppets put together, awake!
- Biden is leading in 5 of the top 6 battleground states and the other one he is tied with Trump.   - His current average overall approval rating is 43.4%  If you don’t believe the polls, okay so be it, but he’s blatantly making shit up here. Come on now lol be better.
Are we supposed to vote for Biden and Harris because they are the best the Democratic Party has to offer or because one was Obama’s VP and the other is an African American woman?   Tell me the policy reasons I should vote for them. Don’t try to win me over with heartstrings.
When we read this headline.   BIDEN/HARRIS WIN WHITE HOUSE.
Time to get to work, Andrew! So, where is your Biden photo in relation to Verlander?

I’m not voting Biden and I did vote Hillary.  Polls are BS.
My mistake Cher.  That's supposed to say if there is one. Cher. Do yo think your friend Joe Biden is going to be President? Just curious Cher.  Me I have this really really good feeling that he will be.  And my feelings usually have been accurate. So now do you think he will be?
Seriously. This is my Biden. Where have you been my dudeeee?!? The moment to be on the upswing is now and you arrived 👍🏻 Thank you for killin it!

I’m not mad at you because of your pension. I’m happy and proud for you.  Your vote to these Corporate owned Puppets to continue voting against the working class.  I hate Joe Biden , the anti christ of the Dems. He voted against me 1973-20009. I can understand boomers like him.
Please add Joe Biden to the mix.
How it happened: Inside Biden's search for a running mate
You mean the lady that gave Hillary Clinton all the answers during the debate? No!     She’s probably already giving CNN, MSMBC ideas on how to put and ear piece on Biden’s ear so they can do the same
I'm not gonna pretend that Biden, any dem or a politician is squeaky clean. I'm not naive. That said, we've seen trump enrich himself and his cronies right out in the open. How many of the small business loans went to his friends and himself.
Whitmer told Biden she didn't want VP spot, urged him to choose Black woman  via
I bet 100.00 she is on a pension. Biden and the corporate elite voted to abolish those in the 70s for most of us. They were grandfathered in to keeping it.  My dad likes Biden too. He earned his pension and loves his party.  In my estimation this party dies with the boomers
He didn’t say that.  He said it’s further to the left than it’s ever been, but that platform has nothing to do with Biden.
That is frickin halarious. You know Biden could do that cuz clown donald can barely make it off the news conference stage without holding onto a wall or column. Watch trumpy when he exits from a stage. His balance is way off; something not right there.
Hey. You vote how you vote. I’ll handle mine.  The most damage I can do to this filthy Biden nomination is to vote trump.  The greens are a wonderful  option.  A trump vote is double damage. A vote trump should not have received and a vote a progressive would have got.
Because here’s the thing: you’re not voting for Biden.  You’re voting for Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s successor.  It’s choosing between getting shot in the knee or shot in the gut, but if you choose neither, then someone else takes the bullet for you.
I assume I'm considered a "house-wife" since I stay home to raise my son and finish my multiple degrees. But I can say that trump got it very wrong. This "house-wife" (I hate this term) is voting for Biden/Harris!!!
I dislike them both, but as I’ve said over and over again, I’m not voting for Biden, but RBG’s successor.
The concerns are legitimate, because voting for Biden is painful.  However, this isn’t an election where you vote to get someone IN, this is an election where you’re trying to get someone OUT.  If Joe doesn’t do the right thing in four years, then vote him out too.
Biden passes over Whitmer, taps Kamala Harris for vice presidential nod  via
As bad as Biden and Harris are, they at least have people like Warren, Sanders, and the BLM movement nudging them in different directions.  All I can hope is that they listen, because four more tears of Trump is just the start of the worse alternative.
I understand your position. I was in it every election from 88 forward trying to get a Republican out of office.  Since we now nominate republicans I haven’t a worry in the world.  Either way these clowns are bad options. 1 has a max of 4 years left. Biden will waste 8.
Anybody realize joe Biden been in office for longer than any of us have been alive, (most of my followers) and still Has yet to change anything, what makes anyone think he will now ?😂
The leverage will or will not be made in November.  If Biden wins progressive agenda is delayed a decade or more. Trump wins, we start fundraising at the mid terms.  We nominated a Republican. I prefer the other Republican which we can get rid of in 4 years.
That’s were our opinions differ. 100 of the richest Americans donate to the Super Pacs.  They decided Biden was best for them.  Now you decide if Corporate interests have scared you into voting for their choice?  I’m not scared.  Never Biden
Bruh I promise I’ll still vote for Biden/Harris as a lot of us will.   I’m not gonna be fuckin thrilled about it tho. Please just admit you’re a moderate if you love this pairing, PLEASE.
No chance in hell im voting Biden.  The corporate scare tactics are bullshit.  They bail themselves out every time anyway. 24 trillion deficit on the Conservative watch?  It’s all a bunch of bullshit. Never Biden.
...I barely rock with Biden and nothing could ever make me roll with Kamala!
WTF are you to judge my progressiveness?   DNC loaded up corporate puppets with cash to run against four progressives.  All corporate puppets lost. That is an act of political war.  Biden and every corporate puppet on all of our ballots should be voted against. Biden voted w GOP.
Here’s Biden and Paul Ryan’s
Kamala and Biden have always been friends. Don't doublethink!
Are you saying Biden doesn't have money he brought in Kamala for money? 🙄🙄..  Do you follow American politics? First of she got this VP ticket based on her black race (Mixed Indian race is added bonus, if she is pure Indian, she won't be in the race for sure)
So apparently some of the first real oppo they release on  is basically reminding voters that the Biden-Harris White House will end the discriminatory cash bail system in this country
Politics is a chess game. Few Americans play chess. Joe Biden doesn't. In this game, he is NOT a King, he is a little soldier that Dems move to the left. Pretty soon, he'll fall of the chess board. Kamala is NOT a Queen either. She is a chameleon, who is easily changing colors.
The positive would be a Biden Harris loss.
Biden sets the progressives movement back a decade if he wins.  He brings nothing to the table.  This democrat is voting trump and you should too.
We nominated a corporate owned pimp which would push progressive adgenda back a decade if he wins. If trump wins, at mid terms of his second term we could start backing a progressive.  No votes for Biden.
No . If Biden wants to run , he has to debate . Nobody gives a shit about the VP 🤷‍♀️
She’s a terrible person to be giving more power to , between her and Biden they will explode the prison population in this country
I was talking to a few of my neighbors last night, they support Biden, and one of them said she worried what white men will think about Harris. I said I don’t give a shit what white men think, I care about what black women think. #BidenHarris2020
That’s exactly why I’m not voting for Biden.  Your comment meant for Dank just resonates in my mind. An anti Biden tv add should be produced using your very own beautiful words. Honestly you have talent.
Most Americans r not that stupid, biden? Somatic narcissist dumbass..Harris a covert narcissist mirrors everyone...what? MSM has deceived many to hate Trump...the spirit is called leviathan ...Jezebel/narcissist have this spirit also..it twist truth
Hell no. .....  Say Biden wins..... progressive agenda is pushed back a decade at best.  If Trump wins we start fundraising in 2 years for a progressive replacement to trump in 4 years.  No one who demands Medicare for All should vote for Biden.
Yeh cus it's a joke..lost 9 billion ? The postal service needs to b put into the private sector,so the scum in Washington  like biden..Pelosi, Schumer, Harris, who like to skim the take, b thankful we now have a president who is stopping the  skim, surprised u didn't know that
Corporate interests picked Harris. Biden is the complete puppet.
HARRIS IS A HYPOCRITE WHO SAID SHE BELIEVED THE WOMAN WHO COMPLAIN THAT BIDEN IS A PEDOPHILE. HAVE A GOOD DEMOCRAT KKK
Joe Biden is a secret Muslim? What happened? Did Obama secretly convert him? Did Obama convert Biden over to Marxism as well? Is Scranton, PA really part of America? Joe! Where's your birth certificate?
He is, but he also realizes that he needs his voters to support Biden or trump will win again
Seems like #Russia's Putin wants Trump to win the election and #China's Xi Jinping wants Joe Biden to win the election 😂😂😅  #MAGA #KamalaHarris
The real sad thing about this Biden/Harris ticket is that as a Palestinian there really is no good option for president. Both candidates and their VPs are unabashedly pro-Israel and don't even attempt to hide it with the typical two state solution lines.
No she didn’t change her mind! She’s looking at this as a opportunity if Biden gets sick she can take over as President!
Don’t think so! She won’t be debating ! It will be trump and Biden!

You do know Biden and Harris stance on crime and mandatory sentencing , they are the reason we’re in the mess we’re in now . Prison populations will explode if these 2 ass clowns get more power

Joe and Beau Biden of course.
Joe Biden has hired me, "the gray fox", to "steal" the election... Easy for me ..
Wasn't that long ago Harris said that Biden was a sexist and molested women...so these things are no longer true?
I take it this means Harris no longer believes that Biden is a racist and a sexist...my how opinions change when you're bought off.
You actually asked Joe Biden that Cher? What was his answer? You couldn't be any happier Cher.  Im as happy as a clam or better. Look I'll show you how happy I am that Joe picked Kalama. 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😛😛🤩🤩😀😀😀😅😅😅😄😄😁😁😁😁😆😆😆😆😆🙃🙃🙃🙃😜😜😜😜. I even did a flip.
Loved meeting you back in 2018 Abdul. I think you’re right on this. I hope you also keep forcefully pushing the Biden campaign on Medicare4all since that is one of the main reasons I was a huge supporter of you back then.
Lmaooo I’m scheduling a Biden rally on the corner of 25 and Shelby
I disagree. Biden’s pull with those Obama / Trump voters is masssive and under reported. They will turn out where it counts.. People seem to forget that Trump won by &lt; 100k perfectly placed votes. If I recall correctly he won MI by 17k. Those votes are gone.
You may not like him, you may love him, but one day his campaign will be studied in social media marketing classes around the world...he’s a genius and joe Biden is a racist pedo pig
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
If pwning the libz is good enough for the "red pilled" crowd why shouldn't we vote Biden/Harris just to piss y'all off?  LOL
Went to the grocery store after hearing that Kamala Harris will be Biden's VP  Could not stop smiling at the little Black girls who will grow up and see themselves in her.  Let's do this.
Proud to be a Biden Supporter!
I don't want to do it. I don't like Biden one bit.  He doesn't' represent me at all. But I will do it, because I must, because the alternative is a threat to democracy itself.
OMG  The woman that pointed out your racist behavior during the debates is now your running mate what is this world coming to? Show your white privilege Joe Biden your brain is mush old man
Go google Biden’s voting record from 73-09. Then stick your head in a soiled toilet and flush.  You have no idea what you are talking about.
I know isn't great Cher.  Im so so happy. I tweeted her to send my congratulations to her. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are to do a great job. In fact they right now doing a great Birthday. Trump is already running scared. He knows that Biden has the upper hand and may just win.
Agreed. This was my hope since Biden became the presumptive nominee. So pumped. It’s been a joy watching most of the reaction.
Vote Trump nothing harms Corporate pimp Biden more.
I hope you understand now that Joe Biden can careless about you. You have an opportunity to redeem yourself, cut the cord with Sleepy and focus on your career. By him being racist and picking only a women with color you should be upset. He will never win with her!
Green is great. Trump votes are more damaging to Biden.  I’m not sure how many 29 dollar Bernie donations I made.  Close to 3500 I can account for. ( I smoke ) can’t always remember.....  DNC fucked me out of 3500ish. Trump it is this ballot
They will when we start winning. This Biden nomination saved me a small fortune in political contributions. I gave 100 to that 70 something year old lady to retire.   That lady, is gunna be most of us if we don’t eliminate the corporate owned DNC and their gaggle of puppets
May I ask are you turning out to vote Biden?  Only fair to say I am not.
I cannot get rid of a Biden, Kamala Harris header 😵
Do I just roll with people that are a lot further left than Biden/Harris, and they really ARE a good representation of most dems? Idk who I wanted him to pick, but she’s just never been someone I’m excited about.
She’s a liar also! But then Biden is also!
Oh my God this woman is a liar! She knows Biden is a racist!
This was the difference between Sanders and Warren. This is why I had to vote Biden in my state primary.   DON'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE FANTASTIC
Bullshit! He picked who he wanted.   I wanted Warren/Harris. Then Biden/Warren. But I GOT Biden/Harris and guess what? It's STILL going to be a successful ticket and they'll accomplish great things.  COVID has validated Warren policies. She'll be unstoppable in the '21 Senate
Remember when Trump told Chris Wallace there’s no enthusiasm for Biden. Keep thinking that, big guy.
Well considering Biden doesn't even know where he is you better hope you're right on that.
My dream was Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang and here we are with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris...
What a terrible choice. Good ole Joe. Politics at its best. Biden sucks.
Um-lil creepy.  Your crystal ball telling you that Biden is going somewhere?
Biden-Harris has been my dream ticket for some time, so I love today’s news. I also love how many other absolutely incredible women have been in the public eye as serious contenders more than prepared for the office.
Do ⁦⁦ &amp; ⁦⁦ remember this ⁦ statement or are they too busy soaking in the praise from the liberal media who only loves republicans when they attack republicans?

Hi I'm just tweeting you to CONGRATULATE you on recieving the highest honor for any woman thus far.  Joe Biden selected you to be his running mate. That is great news. You and Joe Biden will make a great team as our President ( Joe Biden ).
Oh my Gosh they are throwing everything in the mix to try to get this idiot elected!!! Let’s see if this really happens when the TRUMP Administration is our and BIDEN is in!!!
Are you on drugs?  Did they not have books in your school?  Joe Biden voted with the GOP from 73-09.  He can unify a damn thing. Don’t even let me get started on you.....
Whoo hoo! Biden/Harris 2020!  💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Yes Cher this is a time to celebrate and dance around with love in our ❤❤❤❤💘💘. Because it is the day that Former Vice President Joe Biden selected Sen Harris as his running mate. All of us woman should all go and play your song WOMANS WORLD.  It would sound perfect now.
My fear is I’ve seen this movie many times before.  Biden wins the DNC will fuck up the next 10 years with their corporate puppets.  The key is to cause them to lose. And try again in 2024.

Crazy as it sounds......  I too thought of 3rd party.  Idiot Biden could still win.  I’m voting in a “ Bi-partisan manner for Trump”.  I hate trump. But I’m not wasting 4,8,12, up to 16 years on Biden and Harris corporate asses.
Kamala Harris used to work with Hunter Biden doing what who knows? She enforced that 1994 crime bill against black defendants to its full extent. As a student of former mayor Willie Brown , whom she had an alleged affair with  Willie said she would make a lousy president!
You're out your damn mind. Trump has done WAY more for the Black/Hispanic communities than any other president. Biden on the other hand says you aint black if you don't vote for him
Progressives will definitely NOT get on Board with a Biden/Harris ticket you can be sure of that
Ridin' with Biden and Harris!! Lets dump Trump!
me when im seeing all this new biden/kamala merch
You're not making any sense, if Russia has already purchased Biden then  that's who they would want in the office ad president.   Russia has purchased Donald, Mitch McConnell,  and grassley
Please help support Joe Biden 2020, add a #Twibbon now!
Okay somebody needs to do some research. Every single thing Biden did regarding this situation has already been evaluated. Watch the entire tape &amp; read the articles.   Stop using propaganda that's faults.  Research dude research.
Two racist people and Biden cannot even talk or form a sentence or answer questions Harris wants to defend police, to losses
Presumptive of me, but I'm really proud of Joe Biden for choosing a woman who hit him hard in the debate. He's showing us he's a man who can take criticism and doesn't hold grudges. How refreshing.
This fella has a real good YouTube show.  I watch it daily.  He is a Republican but not the idiot wearing an AR15 to the grocery store kind.  Kind of a silly post,  maybe he is paid by the comment or retweet.  Biden’s nomination took me from MSNBC and politics until 2023 ....
Ok is that why she went and met with Biden last week .
Biden has to win first. Cast your vote wisely.  I don’t need a corporate owned incumbent in 2024. I’m voting trump. This way we can nominate a progressive or elect yet another Republican.  Corporate Dems are worthless
Remember the debate where Kamala Harris heavily criticized Biden on busing? Picking Harris speaks volumes about the kind of man Joe Biden is. Does anyone think President Man-Baby would or could pick someone who wouldn't kiss his fat ass day in, day out?
Kamala Harris is announced as Joe Biden's running mate(VP), her mother is a tamilian (Dad is an African American). Joe Biden's memory is getting so bad, if Biden wins, he may not continue as a President for long, Kamala may take over. Congrats Kamala 👍🏼
Why was msmbc so late in announcing Biden’s vp pick
Hey everyone, only rational reasons for spreading your cheeks after a rigged primary and STILL voting for Biden after a shitty VP pick in the replies!
I’m crying right now! I always thought she would be the perfect strong lady to stand up for America and be the perfect partner for President Biden! America should be Dancing in the streets to have such a brilliant beautiful WOMAM as VP! trump is shakin in his boots!

Biden/Harris was the obvious ticket. She can now push police reform as a former AG, she's got a ton of charisma that'll remind people of Obama, and it'll set Dems up for 12 years in office when she runs in '24. #BidenHarris2020
I can't wait for VP Harris to be the girl power face of what's sure to be a brutal, sustained, and punitive crackdown on protests using faceless federal troops the SECOND Biden wins. Assuming he does of course, and that's no slam dunk.
Joe Biden just lost his 2020 election good going 😂
Joe biden ran for president in 1988 and got caught for lying and it took him out the race, then he ran again after that in 2008 and lost to your “great” Obama, so please tell me how you want somebody like this in office LMAO
Kamala Harris is, objectively, the worst possible choice for the Democrats to put in the White House alongside Joe Biden.  Not because she is a woman, but because when she had the power to help people facing injustice from law enforcement, she did nothing. She. Did. Nothing.
Fuck. I knew i should have bought one of those Biden Harris websites when they were doing the primaries coz i knew this was coming
Biden/Harris - the comprehensive rapist/mass incarceration bootlicker 2020.  Trump is Rapist/Religious Mysogynist.  There is no "win" here.
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate  via  #MIDems
Excellent choice! “Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate”
Biden chose  Well done!
Text is in, and Biden just took to Twitter
Okay so the White House website has a presidential briefing scheduled for 5:30 Eastern. I think it would be funny if Biden went live at 5:29.
Trump: 'Some people would say men are insulted' by Joe Biden choosing a woman as VP
If biden picks whitmer my dad might vote for them. Just depends how they feel about military spending.
Have you noticed how Trump doesn’t talk about his own plans for the future but all he does is critisize Biden? Maybe it’s because he doesn’t have any plans?
There's a difference between a country wanting somebody as president and country manipulating an election to get their candidate. We already know Russia is actively manipulating, using social media. Germany would like to see Biden. Does that make them an enemy of the state.
Wow he never said that. But since you can't remember what city you are in it makes sense you would say that. Nice new slogan SETTLE FOR BIDEN shows real enthusiasm huh.
I'm trying to get your point here. So who really cares if China wants Biden to be president. We all know Russia, a much more dangerous entity, wants and will manipulate to have Donald j Trump remain president. You forget they helped him win in 2016.
And he accuses VP Biden of cognitive slippage. There are montages, like this, of coo coo for Cocoa Puffs moments from DJT. Yikes.
Biden campaign puts VP team in place ahead of announcement  via
Yeah except even trump is trying to do something for the voters Biden doesn’t care about.  Kind of amazing we nominated a Corporate owned pimp.
I am pretty sure Biden said he will accept the nomination from his home so I think the majority of the convention will be virtual
Biden is the absolute worst nomination ever.  Read that.
I think you mean Biden &amp; Obama.  bragged about blackmailing the Ukrainians. Joe got his useless son huge jobs &amp; contracts without any qualifications.  was friends with leaders of Cuba &amp; Venezuela. Did nothing against Russia, China, NK &amp; helped Iran.
No I think it’s Byee Biden! You are a disgrace!
Could have stopped at “people aren’t impressed with Biden”
With his first breath after Biden makes the announcement
I think Kamala Harris is going to be Biden's VP pick.  She checks all the boxes for the Dems.  If Whitmer is picked for the job; she should resign as Governor of MI.  It's only fair to the taxpayers of MI.
is a tool! Instead of reviving fabulous Robin Williams' career, killed him again like the ex-wife(ves) who siphoned $$ forcing him to take so-so projects just to pay bills. Zelda could have also aired Other Jokes to showcase Robin's talent.
Not hopeless vote Biden to get rid of donald and his corrupt administration.
Joe Biden lies about college law school degrees, scholarship and graduat...  via
Have these all been researched to actually go to black people? Many of the ones shared are organized by companies who collect under the guise of helping black lives but research shows it goes to major political campaigns including Hillary, Bernie, and Biden.
I gotta ask, why aren’t Dems taking this approach? Seriously, just start making up awesome stuff about Biden and who cares about how realistic it is?
This coming from the campaign attempting to cast doubt on Biden’s mental faculties. Orwellian is appropriate.
Fake news
Trump executive ordered it back into existence.  Biden sucks.  Looks like trump cares where Biden doesn’t.
Ted or whatever your real name is......  would you like me to post your campaign contributions from Corporate America.  More and more Americans are putting together that corporate interests pay you to vote against the people.  Your no Joe Biden or anything but you have no room
Joe Biden only cares about corporate interests. He has been a corporate puppet since 1973.  He is so weak and revolting he may lose.
Can you comment on your neighborly discussions with Vice President Biden
Trump is sabotaging the USPS.Theres a new post master general.Just happens to be a friend of  convient I’m telling you now his own words about a corrupt election,will come true.Unfortunatley Biden will be on the short end.
Cher Cher Cher my one Cherie. Im voting for Joe Biden don't worry. I'm one of his supporters. So dont worry it's all under control. Well for me. It's under control at least. We have have to get the giant 🍊🍊🥕🥕🥕🎃🎃🎃 out of office. Sorry I got carried away. I added a pumpkin
If I had the exact same opinion of Donald trump and Joe Biden (which I don’t), the tweeting alone would be justification enough for me to vote Biden.
Like his advisors helping pick the vp or like online ones like the bernie bros? Ive never seen like a extremely amped biden guy on twitter haha
Theres biden bros?
He should but he has some form of dementia like Biden!
Let's charge Ron Johnson with treason for using Russian propaganda to smear Biden. Don't believe his lies such an Russian asset
No but we saw Trump peaking through Biden's basement window
No white person fully understands what it means to be black in this country.   Any black person who thinks Trump is a better choice than Biden is seriously wrong.  Whittmer should not be Biden's choice for VP. I favor Susan Rice for the spot.
Rice is the correct choice in my eyes. Harris accused Biden for being a racist. It would be very hypocritical to be his VP and the Republicans will be all over this. She would make a great AG nevertheless.
Biden is a Corporate Owned Pimp who voted with the GOP from 1973-2009.  No Thank You.  Maybe 2024
Yep, Trump is a lier. Vote for Joe Biden!
I will vote for Biden no matter what, but what he is doing is both sexist and racist IMO. He is choosing his running mate based on sex and color rather than ability. This is one of the reasons Trump has so many supporters still.
Yes! He has gotten away with lies and treason him Hililary and Joe Biden knew ratings also he was thVP! So he now has dementia and will claim he knows nothing!
Have ya heard the gibberish that comes out of Covidiot45. Every time he opens his mouth, a bunch of incoherent bullshit falls out on the floor. Doesn't matter. I'd vote for Biden even if he had a closed head injury and could only manage to druel before I'd vote for this criminal.
We can’t let Biden Abolish the Constitution and the 2nd amendment.
Did he say “ I am joe biden and i am gonna beat joe biden Dad?
Biden supporters aren't baffling to me. It's quite simple: they hate Trump, that's all that matters to them.
And vote for Biden is we will go straight to hell with a socialist country!
It’s all a act! For the cameras! Biden wouldn’t know if he was in church or still the basement! His wife g has to tell him how and when to talk!
This insane Trump move should be in every Biden ad in battleground states - aimed at Seniors and those close to that age. Dear Lord "Trump promises permanent cut to payroll tax funding Social Security and Medicare if he’s reelected"
With Biden the VP will be president within 6 months. Joe is sick
As soon as I vote against Biden I’m unregistering from this shitty party.
China just called, when Biden loses can they get a refund?
2020 Polling: Why Trump Vs. Biden Is Not Trump Vs. Clinton : NPR
That clown Biden voted to cut Social Security twice.      Could u share something positive about Biden ( I know that’s near impossible ) instead of trump does this or that?   Biden is a Corporate owned pimp.  Not many folks I know are voting Biden.  We’re not afraid of trump.
Is she the one that Biden's handlers have picked to be his running mate?

Hell yes! And if you let Joe Biden be President your in trouble  Because all hell will break lose worse then now! We need our Police in our Country! Joe Biden and the Democrats want to take our rights! That can’t happen We need to be safe from crime and evil !

Now we know why China gives millions to the Biden’s huh?
Yeah joe Biden is mentally incompetent for sure!
Truly the Dems and the media are all crazy! They look like fools propping up Joe Biden! He is not a well man!
Fair enough. My view is influenced by assessment that Harris ran a weak  primary campaign and never did her homework on health care.  And choosing Rice keeps Biden in the shadow of Obama when he wants to make a fresh and independent  statement.  I think it’s Whitmer or Demings.
What is Biden selling? Socialism.
That first word was a typo, right? If you use Spell Check it would correct to BIDEN...
For all he has done for the American people. Simple truth. Have you studied Biden’s platform? Didn’t think so.  I should feel sorry for you, but I don’t.
It’s your story, tell it any way you want.  But seriously no progressive anywhere is pleased with the shittiest nomination ever.  Some will vote green, some will skip the election, others are voting trump and a few will try not to puke while voting for Biden.  Maybe 2024?
This so true! And he’s not a racist ! Not like Joe Biden!I'm not a socialist and neither is Biden. Biden holds more conservative values than Trump actually. As I feel being a conservative means you're a true man of God, spreading the love of Jesus Christ.
lol yeah the #resist in your bio along with several blue wave emoji, a Joe Biden/Kamala header, &amp; profile full of Dem tweets didn’t give it away. You’re an absolute joke 😂 peace

“It’s not about your rights” —-Joe Biden, 8/13/2020  The new Harris/Biden ticket slogan    #SlowJoe #PhonyKamala
That’s funny that anyone thinks he is getting crushed by the racist Biden
The Anti-Biden people are much better off trying to push Conservatives to vote for Libertarians, but that makes too much sense and is maybe too much work for them.
The reason I say he has more conservative values is because a true conservative is a man of God and there's no question that Biden is more a man of God than Trump is
Biden is not far left and if your mind was not easily influenced by conspiracy theories you'd realize this in fact he has more conservative values than Trump has...
Also this has nothing to do with Trump I was just telling you what Biden said...what you don't believe there are crooked cops? Really?
No they're not...you do realize that Biden is for the exact opposite right?
lol he thinks Biden has dementia?
Asking Palestinians to pick between Trump and Biden is not asking us to pick the “lesser of two evils.”  It’s asking us to pick the lesser of two abusers.  #Palestine #FreePalestine

Neither is Biden..but do you think people should be allowed to have military weapons?

you say the right is racist and sexist then look at who you picked for your vp. it is based on race and sex. do you think they looked into anything else? Biden’s top 5 choices were all women and 4 of them were black. Who is the sexist and racist now?
Hey Joe Biden I see you have a nasty pet running with you. You can kiss my ass thinking you gonna mandate anything to me. I wear a mask when I'm out only. See I love the American people that's why I wear mine. Your a disgrace to us good americans. All Americans stock up on
Biden will probably have his hands all over Harris since he likes touching women and she is a nasty animal that needs here rabies vac.These 2 are the biggest joke I have ever seen. DON'T VOTE FOR BIDEN N HARRIS THEY WILL F#*K US AMERICANS OVER VERY BAD DON'T BE
You got to watch governor Whitmer she all mad cause she can't see glory and stars now that she was not picked by Biden,She is a sell out,she suppose to care for michiganders but she sure was kissing biden feet to be elected vp.another joke
Hey there's the 2 biggest liars and crooks around. Hope yall know all the blood spilled from americans and the children are on your heads Kamala and Biden and rest of the dems.Democrats are nasty,liars,crooks and MURDERERS. KAMALA AND BIDEN SUCK WITH THE OTHER DEMS
Make them viable during the midterm and primaries. Voting for them now is wasting a vote and giving Trump the win. Biden and Kamela would be the better option of the only two we actually have.
Gee, why would you agree to be a predator's running mate? #BidenHarris2020    Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Yeah its gonna be a daily reminder to vote for Biden and his hairy legs
Man he really flew down those last 10 feet, fucking idiot. Biden could run circles around humpty dummy!
That seems right, Biden putting in the work while the lazy ass narcissist enjoys the ride
Trump would wreck everyone on the bus coming from our away games in high-school. Ya Wlad ya Wlad. Shu!! Tuhkoosh ma3 biden. Why??? Cuz he sniffs girls hair in third hour. Lmaoo
Then you’re not voting Biden lol
That's fantastic! So he's for Biden now I guess.
Kamala is nothing but a lieing low life person,she talks nothing but bull crap.She will do nothing to help americans,all she and Biden are gonna raise your taxes,do away with fraking which will cause a lost of jobs,I guess if you vote for them can pay big money
As  picks  for VP,  Issues Stark Warning #civility #KamalaHarris
Big Biden accounts could have RTed that poll but refused to that's on them like
Recently yeah, that's all I've been watching of either guy. I think Biden's strategy lately has been good in that there hasn't been a lot of material, but the problem is that the material that there is lately hasn't been good, the Vette commercial excepted which was quality
Let's worry about getting Biden and Kamala in the office before berating them on policies and past behavior. Sure, we can scrutinize. But I fear we run the risk of wavering minds voting 3rd party. Not a risk we should be willing to make.
Then a non vote for Trump is a vote for Biden. I’m not voting for Trump then lol
Bad, but shit Biden's looking worse lately. I watched a few videos of him now vs him during Obama, and it's brutal. I'm hoping for some type of clarity during the debates
Might not logically follow, but still true. Biden hasn't been looking good.
Kamala is a leftist along with others like Old ass Bernie.they are nothing but trouble DO NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN &amp;KAMALA THERE GONNA DESTROY AMERICA.ALL AMERICANS NEED TO OPEN THERE EYES AND SEE HOW BAD THEY ARE.ETS KEEP AMERICA GREAT WITH TRUMP.
Hell  yes Biden is a joke,and kamala is to.they are both racest. This election is the biggest circus event ever. Joe Biden is the stupid ring master.. Kamala Harris is no damn good for America..Dems are so far left it's pitiful.this election is a JOKE,JOKE
It’s got to be a coordinated thing; it happened so suddenly. Can’t believe it was to overshadow Biden’s VP pick, but it was definitely on purpose.
Biden lost my vote with that pick. It’s sad because I had higher expectations for him.
Vote for America!  Vote for Liberty for all! Vote Trump 2020 and John James 2020!  We need people who love OUR Country! Trump does not take one dime from this country and he has only been in office for 3 years!  The Biden group have been around for 45 years...look at the mess!
What's this shit I heard about Joe Biden tag-teaming with Kamala?
Trump Warns of What China Will Do if Biden Wins in November
Why do you think she deserves 95% of the African Vote?  Because she's an African American female or some other reason.   Name one good thing she's done as a Senator?   Just for kicks, name one think Biden has done in 47 years in Washington.
Biden and Harris could both shoot me on 5th Avenue, and I'd still vote for them. #truth
I want at least that. Biden isn’t as right wing as Trump and certainly not as impulsive.
So get four more years of Trump then? If you can’t have it 100% your way, you’d prefer total defeat? That’s childish.  I dislike Biden. He’s creepy. He’s corrupt. Likely not sincere. Now take those qualities, shift them even farther right, and you get Trump. That’s worse.
Well, we *had* other options.  They’re not available anymore. Not for THIS election cycle.  Biden, even if only barely, is better than Trump. The least we can do is vote for the lesser evil and try harder to support truly progressive candidates. Maybe Yang can win in 2024.
When she ran for Senate she did a lot of things to build her name up. Now just a couple years later she is going against everything she stood for in order to sell her souls to the devil aka Joe Biden
Progressives: I feel you. Biden wasn’t in my top 5 for the presidential primary. Your jaded feelings are valid, but don’t lose the hope.  We have two allies in  &amp;  They can only pull off big upsets if they get Bernie-level fundraising. Follow &amp; donate!
Joe Biden doesn’t want to help you. He wants a return to the status quo, and he’ll use your fear of four more years of Trump to do it. (Just a reminder, the status quo fucking sucked for everybody)
We cannot take anything about this race for granted, and I look forward to turning out the 12th district and all of Michigan for Vice President Biden and Senator Harris in November, to protect our country and democracy.

If you did the research you'd know how corrupt the Trump admin is too  Yes. I'm willing to take Biden over Trump knowing full well both are still evil. Trump is more evil. As I said in 2016, we deserve better choices. Socialism&gt;fascism any day.

hey Dan I was listening to news this afternoon and heard biden has to elect a black women lol.this president election has nothing to do with us americans. It only is about money and racism. This is all a joke. The hell with dems there liars and crooks

nope Biden claimed it first  when he became vp
Biden is the king of stupidity
that’s very true. I have seen it too. but Biden should not be running because he just insults people during his interviews.
if Biden is soooo smart, then why is everyone trying to make him avoid debates with him. Because he can’t make a single coherent sentence.
Dear me, at least he is talking in sentences.  Joe Biden has can't even say words on the first or second time.
You know I am done with you. If you choose to be idiotic that is on you. but if Biden gets voted in (God for in that ever happens) then just watch all the bad decisions that he makes and how the country will be in complete ruin.

and that will happen under Biden.

and why would i believe Biden. Who doesn’t know what he is saying half the time.
They say they're pro life but don't understand how some Democrats are too like Biden they just don't think it should be government controlled. If anything they should be furious with the person that invented abortion in the first place that's what I do.
You might want to come up with a new come back “you moron”. It’s getting old already. I don’t think Biden is much better.
Rice, though never elected to anything, is a foreign policy expert with a very close personal relationship to Biden. Whitmer has been a governor for less than two years, with no federal government experience.  But she's white. And to Biden, that's the winning ticket. (10/10)
Whitmer's selection also has the added bonus of delivering Michigan's first Black governor if Biden is elected, as our lieutenant governor is Garlin Gilchrist, a Black man. (8/10)
I wouldn't be surprised if Biden is making the following calculations:  "Black people will largely come out and vote for me no matter what because they're scared of Trump. Progressives will come out because they're scared of Trump... (5/10)
They are all for workers' rights and so on. But they are not joining the protests in the streets. In fact, they are made fairly uncomfortable by most talk about race and racism, as it seems Biden often is. (4/10)
These moderate (white) voters would be okay with a woman being one heartbeat away from the presidency. But not a Black woman. Especially in the age of Black Lives Matter.   I grew up in Delaware and Pennsylvania. I lived with the kind of white moderate Democrat Biden is. (3/10)
My prediction: Joe Biden will select Gretchen Whitmer as his VP candidate.  Why? Because she's white.  Biden's whole theory from the jump of the campaign has been to flip moderate (white) Midwestern voters who voted for Trump in 2016, narrowly giving him the White House. (1/10)

Seven years and hundreds of millions donated and the biggest gain in institutional racism you describe was criminal justice reform by a politician that never received a penny.  Despite that, BLM will assuredly endorse people like Joe Biden who helped jail more blacks.  Good luck.

If you truly were you'd realize that Trump uses us a photo op. Biden is a true Catholic. Why would you say he's not? Do you personally know him? That's what I thought
If Biden has 100 a day then Trump has a million. You really want to keep on going? Come on dude check yourself before you wreck yourself...literally
You say Biden has dementia but Trump has 2 gaffes in one day? Yeah I'd chill on that
The worst things Biden has said compares nothing to the things Trump has said that is for certain and at least Biden has the decency to apologize if he feels he has said wrong while Trump feels he can't do or say wrong which is exactly why we're in the dire situation we are in
Ride or die Joe Biden fans anytime he talks
I can’t argue that he has dealt with an incredible amount of grief. That story I shared is completely legit though, along with many other instances of his dishonesty. All I said was Joe Biden will not be a good President. I didn’t say he should or shouldn’t beat Trump.
You mean when Biden is running for his second term and Trump is in prison and bankrupt.
And I don't see Biden as garbage or even with dementia I just believe what he has is a speech impediment and that's alright. I'm sorry you feel that way about him but that's alright it's your opinion as an American and that's what being American is supposed to be about.
Dems didn't expect Trump to mess up this much and are now having Biden talk, along with suing the NRA, in order to lose harder.
I respect your opinion I only see one evil this election in fact I see Biden as someone that shares more true conservative values than Trump does
I just can't imagine Joe Biden tweeting this or completing any other thought.
biden will be just as bad as trump, but a different type of bad

Biden should refuse to debate that nitwit if he doesn’t release his taxesstuff like the sudden decision that Harris is an epic debater always catches me off guard, like my sister first mentioned it to me and it was just so out of left field I couldn't even think of what to say about it, aside from cynically knifing Biden she was terrible!
if you go to that thread you'll see I never suggested that merely endorsing Biden made you a liberal, that doesn't matter, the Debate Me Bro is completely uninterested in what you actually have to say, they just want to put points on the board with shitty circular word games
he wants to browbeat minorities into voting for Joe Biden while saying lots of fucked white savior shit in the process, habitually punches left with whining about "tankies", and enjoys being loudly wrong about theory, how very communist!
I can't really come up with a good reason for anyone to vote FOR Biden/Harris.  I can list LOTS of reasons to vote AGAINST Trump.
PRESIDENT Joe Biden sounds great!
solidarity with the Pod Jons, we are united in the Biden camp regarding us with open disdain
I've only seen one pro Biden sign in all of Michigan, but hundreds of Trump signs!
Truth over lies. Unity over division. Science over fiction. Hope over Fear.  ----Biden/Harris 2020
that's Biden you're thinking of
Mine too. Funny, you guys supposedly had so much on Trump yet waited until the night he won to “resist”. You should have mentioned this when you could have destroyed him. Tell me, what is Biden (really Harris) going to do for the country?
I really detest Corporcrats. But if Brother West can vote for Biden/Harris, so can I.
If that were legit trump could just hire him in the administration and use his good ideas. Instead they want to prop him up as a candidate who would technically be running against trump as well as Biden They truly think we cant see the bullshit.
I DO NOT want to vote for biden/harris, HOWEVER I will
I only follow Biden to troll him and try to convert his followers
We can try to soften the criminalization of drug use as much as we want to but “boot camp” is still criminalizing drug use. I’m voting for Biden and Harris. Senator Harris is more than qualified to be VP. We can admit that without trying to make her time as a prosecutor “heroic.”
Biden could be eating Trump’s lunch all debate but the minute Trump calls him “Sleepy Joe”, I’m laughing myself into a coma
me, a person who has never organized: vote for Biden and then we get back to organizing!
i have seen one joe biden lawn sign in the hundreds of miles i’ve driven on the east side of michigan. joe biden is so fucked
Biden/Harris 2020 “we’ll beat your meat”
I think Joe Biden’s brain might be bankrupt.
Boy, that just makes Biden seem even better..
I will not allow anyone to say "Joe Biden" without the title "Sheikh."
Research her record as Prosecutor and get back at me. We'll talk, plus you can watch her own attacks on Hiden Biden from the primaries.  Don't be lazy! C'mon Man!
when Biden launches an abortive invasion of Venezuela in his second year and tries to drone Maduro and liberals cheer, that'll rule
dont forget, biden is a sexual predator too... it's disappointing to see that the men w the most political power in the us are preying on girls and women just because they think they can😔
My tweet speaks for itself!😂😂 my opinion has not changed. Last time I checked Biden is white, I will still vote for him though! ✌🏽
🤣OLE RACIST HAPPY FINGERS HAIR SNIFFING SLEEPY PEDO JOE &amp; CORRUPT DEMS R SCARED SHITLESS TO DEBATE! DEMS DON’T WANT DEBATES! THEY GOT NOTHING!  TRUMPS=AMERICA : BIG ASS WALL TO KEEP ILLEGALS OUT, PATRIOTS KEEP OUR GUNS, &amp; WE ALL HAVE JOBS, GOD &amp; FAMILY! BIDEN=LAZY AMERICANS
They have to know Biden is declining that’s why they hide him in the basement. So is this the dems strategy? Makes ya wonder.
I think Obama’s biggest mistake was underestimating what an ass #MoscowMitch would be.  He has already said if Biden wins and he is still majority leader nothing will get voted on
I think the hope is Biden wins and we get competent Presidential leadership and by spring things are more under control
So if Something happens to Biden, which it very well might, Hariss will take over? Big Yikes.
I think you missed my point. In any event, anybody Biden offers a job will do well under his experience and leadership, whether or not they've had a similar position before. Buttigieg is an asset to the party that should be nurtured rather than sidelined.
It mobilized libs, which is why the worst candidate won too. They go back to sleep when biden goes in. We don't.
Joe Biden just picked Kamala Harris to get the black vote and to get more $$ for his campaign... it’s all for money. This election straight ass. We don’t have no good candidates in my opinion.
In ‘must-win’ Michigan, Trump campaign takes fight door to door as polls show Biden with strong lead
WEIRD  Every media...is slamming Trump.  And only praise BIDEN.  Almost as if.... COMPLETE BIAS.
Uh that was the 90’s and you think trump or reps were different. No. And since then has Biden changed. Yes. So have we as a country but trump hasn’t and that sir is the difference.
Did  just threaten Biden? Twice? 😳
You're letting your racism show again hiden Biden! 🙄
she's simply not an attractive person sorry  that said, the horny posts prove they like her more than Biden
well, the Democrats, and Biden in particular, have barely showed any more initiative or desire to address the crisis at its real scale so they'll absolutely find themselves holding the bag of a depression economy as soon as they get in not to mention the vaccine rollout
Do people really believe Biden will stay mentally fit for four more years?
i just can’t believe biden and trump are the best we could do. it’s embarrassing
That is a shame. Someone's career excludes them from your friend list. Just remember, Obama/Biden was when BLM was formed. Also, Occupy and Standing rock. You seem to have no refuge, politically.
Endorsement for Biden confirmed lmao
Watched as much as I could stand of the biden harris show live now. Be ready for story telling and Trump bashing straight through...
OK AMERICANS! Here’s what Pedo Joe Biden &amp; I think I’m Black Kamala Harris want for AMERICA!  * NO GUNS ! DISARM YOU * SHUT DOWN NRA ASAP * NO POLICE IN RURAL AREA’S OR SMALL CITIES (ONLY LIMITED IN BIG CITIES) they want smaller forces.  * RIP DOWN TRUMPS WALL * WIDE OPEN BORDERS
I didn't say that and Biden has my vote Obama did a lot of "good" things to but he also bombed innocent people in the middle East every day and deported the most people out of any president. Know the truth about the people u support buckaroo.
Liberty is accountability in government. To restore liberty and accountability, we must end qualified immunity.  Trump - against Biden - against Harris - ?  #EndRacism #EndTheFed #MeToo #Equality #2A #BlackLivesMatter
tl;dr: Kamala is good, in fact, she's practically Bernie Sanders and a totally sincere person. Biden obviously picked her because he turned a new leaf and stopped being a lifelong racist after she called him one in the debate. He picked her because he was so humbled peepeepoopoo
SHE IS 200% A PHONY &amp; A SELLOUT TO  ALL BLACK AMERICANS IF SHE IS TRULY IS A BLACK AMERICAN WOMEN!! WOW!  SHE KNOWS DAMN WELL PEDO JOE BIDEN IS A “LIFELONG RACIST” &amp; EVERYONE OF HIS POLITICAL POLICIES HE HAS BACKED THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER HAS HURT BLACK AMERICAN COMMUNITIES!
If Biden becomes pres. the child trafficking epidemic is gonna get way worse.
Nope. Biden said he would be choosing a woman before he knew his actual pic. Nice try.
Biden already overwhelmingly won the Black vote in the primaries. Kamala is for the “not racist” vote.
low key I'd be pretty surprised if we got through a full Biden term without getting into some kind of armed conflict somewhere
DEM BACKED ANTIFA SISSY BOYS &amp; DEM WHITEY HATER BLM GROUP,  R AGAIN bitching about wanting all Confederate statues ripped down that Democrats put up in the ‘60s! 🤣LMAO! The DEM vandals who support Biden really don’t know their history! Dumb fucks think REPUBLICANS R RACIST! 🤣🤣
I have been watching Biden since he first entered the Senate in 1973. I have not been impressed. I wish we had a different candidate. But it reflects well that he chose Harris over Rice. She's smart, tough, and teachable. I'm now ready for Biden/Harris! #BidenHarris2020
My cousin is savage, dude.  Said, "Biden wrote the Crime Bill and Kamala used it to imprison more black men for Weed than Lebron James has Points."
they don't even try to hide it anymore. Dude straight up said, "if you don't vote for me, YOU AIN'T BLACK." lmao  the democratic campaign manager/ the democratic hivemind really thought Biden saying that shit was a BOSS MOVE.   fuck you. next you'll tell me how unmexican I am.
Dude, imagine being Black &amp; having to vote for the guy who wrote the Crime Bill and the lady who is the all-time leader in incarcerating Black people with it (Biden/Harris)...... or Trump.
Kamala Harris is officially Joe Biden’s running mate. Michigan supporters say it’s about time.
If Biden becomes pres. the demand for children by the elite will take off. They’ll have the nation’s head to facilitate the child traffic market.🇺🇸 #AdrenochromeHarvesting  #BidenHarris2020
I may skip voting this year. I DNT like any an I think it was dumb move of Biden to pick Harris. He jus handed trump presidency again if u ask me. I want real candidates. Not ones who fake races an calls ppl racists. This world is goin 2 hell in a basket 🤪🤪🤬🤬🤬😠😠😠
You are stuck in antiquity, ancient and old. A true DINOSAUR. This "Suburban Housewife" that owns her own business and works 100 + hours a week CANNOT WAIT TO VOTE FOR BIDEN. BYEDON!!!
I wonder if Kamala Harris still believes Joe Biden's accusers? Cause if she doesn't why the change of heart? I  hope the media pounds her with these questions but they probably won't....
Prediction:  Trump will make a joke  (or lots of jokes)  about how he should debate Kamala instead of Biden, because she's the real ticket.  Enough to goad Joe into making a statement that he's not going to step aside once elected.
You checked your "Christianity" at the door, pal. Biden is an ardent Catholic. Seems like you might need to revisit the teachings of Christ. And why, as a man of the cloth, are you wading in to politics?
I'm part Cherokee as my grandmother was full Indian.  Me myself do not get caught up on a person's color . Independent will be my vote .Biden had 8 yrs not good .plus been in politics for several more .he has been horrible.
News Brief: Biden Names Running Mate, College Fall Sports Canceled, Belarus Election  #education
Joe Biden, by picking Kamala Harris, has demonstrated that the Democratic Party is inclusive.  It is a party of diverse views, backgrounds, races, genders.  It is not a party of white men who just say yes sir to their dear leader.
Biden’s main issue for a campaign should have been ECONOMY!  PEDO JOE’S ISSUES R GUN CONTROL &amp; OPEN BORDER IMMIGRATION! N.Y. &amp; CHICAGO INVITE ILLEGALS PROCLAIMING THEMSELVES SACTUARY CITIES. The 2 BIG DEM RUN CITIES need IMMIGRANTS because locals running out of people to shoot.
Even though we all have our personal opinions concerning Sen. Kamala Harris as Biden’s running mate, we should not let those opinions blind us from our overall goal of kicking Donal Trump out of the White House!💙
it's the #KHive in honor of kopmala Harris who is going up start a Marxist revolution as Biden's VP, we have to stan

Trump: Biden Is Insulting Men Everywhere by Picking Woman as Running Mate  via
I’ve never directly donated to a political candidate before. But I’m putting my money where my mouth is. I’m supporting the Biden / Harris campaign with a t-shirt purchase because I strongly feel it’s a positive direction to take our country in.
I think Biden's plan is to get teump re elected lol where is  at?! We need you
This is all that tRump will do when they come for him.  “It’s a witch hunt!!”  “Boo hoo! No one likes me!”  “Best administration ever!”  “Biden is corrupt!”  Waaaa!  Waaaa!

#KamalaHarris Is #Biden’s Choice for #VicePresident #dailytreal A former rival for the #Democratic presidential nomination, she will be the first #woman of color to be nominated for national office by a #majorpolitical #treal party. #trump
Let's be doubly clear on why. Biden is no better than Trump - Biden just hides it better. He's racist, misogynist, and wants to cut all social safety nets (the latter, he's been VERY clear on). I cannot, in good conscience, vote for that. I just can't.
I absolutely am. I'm a strong left Independent. Dem party gave me NOTHING to vote for. I'm not asking for everything I would like to see happen. But I'm not being offered ANYTHING from Biden. So no. I'll be voting Green to give 3rd party viability. M4A is my MINIMUM requirement.
ROFLMAO! It'll be history alright. A fucking fascist is gonna get a second term. Jesus Christ.  Biden did a GREAT job at pushing out the largest voting bloc.   All he had to do was select a progressive. He couldn't even do that.   I'm voting Green and my conscience is clear.
I don’t know which one of you jokers signed me up for the Biden emailing list but rest assured that I will find you.

Oh let me guess, Biden insulted men by picking a black woman for VP... 🙄 save your insecurities for a therapist, Donald. Social media isn't the place to air personal struggles as a "professional".
The wealthy donors to the Democratic Party have sex with children and/or torture &amp; kill them. Biden himself has participated. #BidenHarris2020  #Adrenochrome #HollywoodPedophiles
A Biden/Harris ticket is sensible and a step in the right direction.
biden and kamala definitely arent my choice for this race but theyre the best and really only choice we have if we wanna vote trump out. bernie wouldve been great but a majority of america isnt ready for a progressive president meaning trump wouldve won in a landslide
Why Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer wasn’t chosen to be Biden’s running mate in 2020 presidential election
I do not like Biden I do not like Kamala Harris
fuck Biden no more Biden
-ing BLM. It’s a politically motivated group that donates their proceeds to the Biden campaign and other Democratic political groups.
After Biden's son Beau died of a brain tumor. Biden's other son, Hunter, fucked his brother's widow then dumped her when he knocked up a hooker.
The people I see upset/mocking the Biden-Harris ticket in my feeds are leftists, self proclaimed libertarians who don’t vote, &amp; q-anons who also don’t vote. I’m not saying I’m pumped or judging, just curious as to what weight they carry this election. It’ll be interesting to see.
Joe Biden definitely not winning now
Harris as VP pick actually rules because you don't even have to feel a little bad about not voting for Joe Biden
Did Biden choose Kamala just to get the Black vote?
Picking a cop as the #VPPick during the largest social uprisings in a generation, fighting police brutality/systemic racism is probably the most tone deaf move #Biden could have made here. Learn to read a room, dude.
Kamala Harris is Biden’s VP? The Democrats really are doing everything they can to self sabotage themselves for this election
i guess she passed the sniff test? idk biden already forgot who he picked anyways
I love how some Dems are bitter about Biden-Harris like, "politics sucks. We have no choice really." That's what primaries are for and you had more than a dozen choices and guess what? They didn't get the majority.
Biden announces #VPPick the same day that hundreds of Sanders Delegates to #DNC2020 vote NO on the Democratic Party Platform because it omits #MedicareForAll. This is an attempt to dominate the news cycle and drown out our dissent, which is valid and sorely needed #DrawTheLine

If Joe Biden picks anyone other than a POC for his VP. We will still vote for him to get 45 out. Be we will also know where we stand. Good enough to date but not good enough to marry and take home to mama..#Veepstakes
Biden can ride a bike with a mask on. Trump can't hold up a glass of water with one hand.
thanks George.  trump and supporters are on the premise that Biden is not there mentally.  Biden can ride a bike  and talk to reporters, trump has trouble walking down a ramp.  believe only half of what you see and nothing you hear.
Biden is a tainted candidate from a tainted party.
If you have four very qualified people who each have different skills they bring to the table. You choose the person with complimentary skills. So biden choosing a black woman would help get much needed representation for people who biden just doesn’t cover alone.
Especially if they expect Biden to remember all those names.
Biden will take a page from the NYT and pick two VPs, uuuhhhhh, the gay one and one of the women I guess
my Biden family members are already freaking out because "Biden is getting roasted for moving left!" which I guess refers to conservatives calling him a socialist, it's begun
You've forgotten Beto. Beto raised the most money his first day of the 2020 campaign, $6.1 million, only beaten by Biden's $6.3 million. Beto out raised Bernie. He also has turned Texas into a battle group state. Beto is a major talent for Biden.
No matter how unfit Biden may or may not be, he’ll ALWAYS be more fit than Trump.  😆😆
Mayor Pete is trending. No, he won't be VP, but consider how well he'd campaign for president after Biden.  This VP better be electable.
I think the most important characteristic of Biden's VP - for the future of the country - is how well they'll perform in their own presidential election against whatever carnival barker the GOP puts up,  2024 or '28. Democrats will need more than one shift to fix all this.
I'd vote for Biden if he picked Peewee Herman
You believe videos now ?  See....Biden billion dollars bribe.  Or  Creepy joe biden swearing in ceremony video
I would never agree with Biden
I’m excited to see who he picks but I’ll vote Biden no matter who it is ❤️
Joe Biden for prison 2020!!!!
Did Biden say that he's pick a black woman?
Bill Barr is merely projecting. Sure... Biden, Nancy, and Chuck want to tear down the very system that props them up. Pretending Democratic leadership is left wing and not just center-right corporatists is laughable.
Sadly, it seems like this was just an ego trip for them. Being better.  Being correct. Being right. Being chosen. Being the hero. Being the saint. I honestly didn’t feel that from HRC. Nor Biden. Nor Obama. And not from Harris actually.
Seeing people line-up “their” VP choice as if that’s now the line they’re going to draw over supporting Biden or not... gtfo. Literally all of the people being talked about are 3 billion percent better than the best of the other side. We don’t need perfection, we need capability.
As long as Biden doesn’t pick Belloq, Gmork, Starscream, Lady Deathstrike, Annie Wilkes, Killmonger, a Murder Hornet on top of a jagged can lid, Cinnamon Toothpaste, or either guy from The Lighthouse as his running mate, we’re going to need you to STFU when it’s time.
I know Joe Biden's VP choice!
No shit fck Biden
YES! CANNOT WAIT! HOPEFULLY IT IS A STRONG WILLED AFRICAN AMERICAN FEMALE LEADER!! WE GOT THIS! TIME TO BRING HOME THE #BIDEN #BACON #VictoryIsOurs
Trumps not sinking. Biden’s mind is sinking. You must be sinking to support the guy. Sad. Both of ya.
and you didn’t even blow this up ... Biden is awful
It never makes sense. I've had Democrats telling me Schumer actually doesn't want to reopen schools (then why do schools need tons of reopening funding but UI payments are negotiable?) or that Biden will prosecute Trump (then why is he calling it "bad for democracy"?)
ALL 7 USPS Unions have backed Biden!  Give us a break with your bullshit!   WE WANT IN PERSON VOTING WE WANT VOTER I.D.
If you watch Trump's angry alzheimer's grandpa routine at every press conference and think "yeah, he's killing it", you've got way worse mental problems than Joe Biden. And he's definitely got a few.
This man is a danger to the United States!!! Shit to the world!! His obvious plan to sway the black vote away from Biden so that Trump wins is DANGEROUS!!! If people dont take this shit serious and stop this madness, there is no hope! Dont fall for the foolery
Joe Biden could not run a hot dog stand
Soy demands Biden.
Is all well with Biden and that bussing issue you had previously?  You're a kowtowing boot lick!
Unless you have future knowledge of what is going to happen then you can prepare for potential outcomes which your current potus seems to be out of the loop of but I cannot believe but trump will get back in.. LMFAO Biden really the best opposition!!!!!!!!!
Is that why NY is BEGGING them to come back??😂😂 Every day you make a bigger ass out of yourself, stole that bit from Biden apparently 🙄
If your for Biden . You definitely like to touch dicks .
Nobody BELIEVE YOU.  You helping BIDEN
How would you classify Biden?   For the record, I don't labels.  I am a small government  / less war / less spending voter.  Democrats are never any of those things.
Remember, Biden's VP will be hand-picked by the DNC because Biden has always just been a place-holder to stop Sanders.  The DNC is fully aware of his cognitive decline, which is why we will likely see NO debates, and no speech at the Convention by the Mumbling-Republican, Biden.
Biden for Prison 2020
I heard #KamalaHarris is #biden VP 🤔
Biden sucks.  It doesn't take too much imagination to denigrate a Centrist, Corporatist whose platform reads like a Republican.  The fact that the DNC is using our hate for Trump to give us NOTHING that would hurt their Corporate Donor income should tell you their priorities.
Nope, don’t Biden or Trump.
Yep.  Keep lying to your viewers about how far ahead Biden is and watch him lose just like Hillary did.  Biden's entire platform is "I'm not Trump".  I find it hard to believe that will excite enough voters for a Biden win.  Either way, we get a Republican.
Sounds like you should have been "Hiden from Biden"
I'd vote for Biden if it means we get rid of her so good strategy
Friend rolled his motorcycle into a bar parking lot. Got his beer &amp; a stranger said "So you're a Biden supporter?"  Friend was confused. "What?"  Stranger pointed out my friend's blue bandana. He must support Biden.  This is the level of fucking moron we're dealing with, kids.
Okay Hiden Biden, Who tweets for you?
Yea well Biden said Obama and me the other day so yea they’re really letting their light shine bright
The media is working for BIDEN.  Isn't that illegal or something ?
I absolutely despise Biden, but I can’t wait for the excuses to come flying from conservatives about this one
So it would appear, we have zero Republican representation in this area, Biden says we have group think here.
they're in the middle of rehabilitating GWB and Biden is already saying that prosecuting Trump (who is, according to the Democratic Party right now, a fascist, corrupt, treasonous, totalitarian existential threat to democracy) would be "bad for democracy"  what do people expect?
Someone with skills should make a  Joe Biden gaff ringtone set for us.  Probably needs the ability to get frequent updates.
Biden campaign claims lagging auto jobs puts Trump at disadvantage in Michigan
Biden first entered my awareness as Obama's VP pick at the height of my own atheist phase so this all checks out
Did Trump in fact claim that Biden insulted the Black community?  It seems like an accurate headline.
But.....you all laughed when Trump said he would beat OBAMA.  Yup  He running against BIDEN , you said.  You LIED
Yays Joe Biden's spin department.  Can you imagine Joe trying to use a smart phone?

Wouldn’t it upset #45, if Kanye West was able to snatch his intended votes and Biden still won in those states anyway. This could very well backfire on #45!  instead of running  why not take care of yourself and focus on your family?
But anyway ... wouldn’t it be an upset if West was able to snatch #45 intended votes and Biden won in those states where Kanye’s name is on the ballet. Ijs ... this could backfire on #45!
It really suck to be  when he calls out black people for not being diverse. Just goes to prove that Joe Biden  and the Democratic Party are racist.
keeps fucking up. Why does this old wrinkled up white guy keep making racist comments towards people of color? Don't want to walk back racist comments? Don't make them in the first place. The man is a closet racist. The KKK is proud of Biden.
require politicians to run their own Twitter accounts, I want to see what Biden would actually tweet
Even worse. He says Biden will "hurt God".  I'm definitely voting for Biden because I don't want to piss off someone with that kind of power.
I agree sounds like an excuse not to vote for Biden.
If a vote for 3rd = Vote for Trump Then logically, it's also a vote for Biden
Nope, Swear to GOD! NO BIDEN SHIT ANYWHERE!   HOWEVER; FREAKING TRUMP IS EVERYWHERE! TRUMP FLAGS IN  YARDS &amp; ON HOUSES, TRUMP SIGNS IN YARDS, TRUMP BUMPER STICKERS, TRUMP HATS, TRUMP TEE SHIRTS, TRUMP SOCKS!   MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS FUCKING LYING TO AMERICANS AGAIN!  POLLS R FAKE!

Doesn't Biden support abortion ?  That's not Catholic.  He a lie.
I express myself much more completely in writing. Biden has a stutter that complicates things as well.
I can’t wait for Biden to open his mouth,
I think it is time that Republicans and Democrats admit that Trump and Biden are not good Christians. We should pray for them both.
Please pull your head out of your ass and realize that Biden is the only choice to vote for in November. #RidinWithBiden2020
Yet you want to post some drivel about how your vote for Biden hinges on his VP pick.
Also Biden..You ain’t black 😐
LOL The Anti-Christ (Trump) said Biden is going to hurt The Bible, Hurt GOD?
Biden will never debate Trump.  He scared.
the people wants Biden so...
You may be surprised...I only ever heard of Biden because of the Obama/Biden memes 😂.  But if you want to lead the country, why not debate 🤷‍♀️. Is Biden going down hill so bad he can’t debate 😬. Because that is what people will think 😐.
Biden is a tainted candidate from a tainted party.🇺🇸👎🏾
Now do Obama’s Biden/Lewis rally 😐
He has my vote with or without...but watching Biden debate would be entertaining 😁
yes those things are definitely part of it  of course you'd have to conduct a cognitive test to be sure, which is routine for someone Biden's age and especially with clear signs of decline, but he refuses to be tested
Biden will never debate Trump
Replace Joe Biden with "every politician who has taken money from corporations" and remove "until election day" and I'm in
I’d be willing to bet most Americans have made a choice...Biden could walk on stage in a diaper with a pacifier in his mouth and people would still vote for him...if I’m being honest..I would. 🤷🏽‍♀️ trump has got to go...I noticed that... Kamala Harris was Biden's handlers' pick y'know...
Vote for Biden.
Love it, keep doing it, if Biden can do that it's fair game. That is hilarious.
I'm glad you are free to support Trump so much. I stand with for the children in cages, and I proudly stand with Biden/Harris.

Another question you can ask: Why is the sky blue? Why can't Biden complete a sentence?
Dumbass question. How come Biden &amp; Harris can't answer any questions? Let me guess, because they don't have any answers. Biden is too busy cashing checks from the Ukraine and China.
Biden &amp; Harris can't answer any questions! Ask some relevant questions, like "President Trump, how did you accomplish so much in 3 years? Biden has been a politician for 45 years and has no accomplishments."  . #NeverBiden
Because they can't answer any questions and they don't have any accomplishments to discuss. Biden will be in a nursing home by November.
Obama &amp; Biden were too busy corrupting America and filling the swamp.
Just saw my 1st Joe Biden ad on the local station here in deep red WY. It sounded great, but not sure how the mandatory mask bit will go over here, so many covidiots!!
I’m voting for Biden/Harris because they can actually do the job without the lies and blatant corruption.  They are true diplomats and can mend fences with our allies.  Also, I’m tired of the division that has happened to our country.
How embarrassing for up and coming young artists to be seen with doddering old fool, Biden. How does this help their cache with fans? 😂
Vote for Biden and save us all, please.
Clinton and Obama are definitely wonk Ivy wasps as this article portrays. Biden is the lone Irish Gipper, the feeler, the westerner, the American.
Bernie's plan also didn't abolish private insurance. I can't believe you grouped her in with those Neolibs. I have noticed you and Abby are crickets on Bernie sheepdogging progressives into voting for someone as horrible as Biden and Kopmala! You both are better than this!
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT, Mr. President, I thought you said Biden was the one who would "hurt God and the Bible"?!?!?!
Biden Harris says enough likes someone who sends people to jail and a women who doesn’t let them out smh dems are laughable
Impressive well-written, well-reported piece on Biden/Harris in Politico. Best I've read in a while.
Obama/Biden /Comey Cabal! 👀 Jordan is ready to fight! 💪
Would you rather have Joe Biden’s memory or Kamala Harris’ laugh?
Agreed. I live in West MI and it's rampant around here.  "Libertarians" voting for Trump. It boggles my mind. I actually committed to Biden unless my friend commits to Dr. Jo, as I told him I'm just voting to negate his vote. (Petty? Maybe. But too many Ron Paul folks &lt;3 Trump)
As long as you say the same about Trump (without mentioning Biden)
Totally agree. But if I (generally conservative) were to tell a dem that I’m voting 3rd party, though, this is the typical response, “but that’s a vote for Trump!” which is just not true, because I’d never vote for Biden. And especially not Bernie lol. Maybe I’m an outlier, idk.
Vote for Biden. You don’t have to be in love, bro!

‘The President Was Not Encouraging’: What Obama Really Thought About Biden #SmartNews
I figured Trump would win in a 65% to Biden's 35% in this election , so this is realistic in numbers ,
Biden and Harris will have to do something to heal the divide, invite some republicans to positions, I mean idk something.
This Biden drinking water ad is the stupidest thing I've seen since Obama drank Flint water
You lost me at Biden being a better president than trump. I do however get what your saying, I would just reverse the analogy.
The atmosphere for protest and agitation will likely lessen under Biden *for a while*. But the evictions, recession and other crises will generate protests again, and Biden will not stop the crushing of those mvmts.
Anything dems offer that sounds good is and always will be either abandoned or will cement in the advanced made by the right.   Case in point. Biden will maintain trump ICE policies.
She's notorious for oppression of Black Americans as a DA. Called Joe Biden a racist. Damn bear EVERYTHING she says is race based... so who's the racist?
The anti war protests were amongst the largest ever, and the overt lies that made the case for iraq were unraveling well before boots were on the ground. All it would have required for Biden to do the right thing was listen. But he didn't because hes a lifelong warmonger.
Once again, there is no reason for anyone on the left to feel as if they must vote for Biden. He will not reverse any Trump policies when in power.
Great to be in-studio yesterday at  in Casper to talk about the important issues facing Wyoming, as well as why Kamala Harris's radical policies would hurt our state and the nation.
if trump wins stocks goes up, biden wins stocks go down. i’ll refer to this on election day
Biden’s a racist, he picked a running mate on color and gender. No bigger racist than that!
Biden go on Red Scare
Joe Biden is a "law and order" democrat
You know if Biden gets in this will all be swept under the rug. It’s been going on forever. To hell with the election get the results out! We deserve to know ASAP.
No the most extreme Ticket was unqualified Trump! And the  has done everything to cover for his 21,000+ lies, the disaster of 166,000+ DEAD American's! Biden/Harris has come forward with plans to fight the Virus, not worry about shower heads! You're a disgrace just like Trump
Wait, wait, I can do that too: I have Dem friends in the bluest of blue states and not one of them is voting for Biden.  See how easy it is!
Joe Biden Tries to Take Credit for Trump Brokered Peace Deal as Rashida Tlaib Yells At Clouds
Nope. I’d agree Trump would get credit if the economy were churning along when Biden takes office, but it currently is and almost certainly will be in free fall at that point.
I think we need tons of people voting in person for Biden/Harris on Election Day. I may risk it and go. I am so worried he’ll declare victory on Election Day if he’s ahead on in person voting. That would be harder if Joe comes out on top on election night.
Maybe the First Couple's mail-in ballots will be "lost" somewhere until they are discovered a week after the election of President Joe Biden.
Even better the Joe Biden?? 👀👀
I won’t credit Obama, but I certainly hope I get the chance to credit Biden.
Are you freaking kidding me? This dipshit is getting 42 percent in the latest poll against Biden. How the fuck is that possible??
Who would your father support?   He was a man of character and did what he thought was right.  Your dad loved joe Biden and you said you did too?   WTF are you not endorsing the man who has always been there for your family?  Trump treated your father horribly!
It’s really more of a suggestion of what Biden thinks should be done.  He won’t actually be sworn in until January, so that’s when it would start. By then, we’ll likely have a vaccine.
Bongino rips idea of Hillary Clinton, Susan Rice joining a Biden admin: 'How thin does your bench have to be?'  #FoxNews
Agh. Made some typos I’ll never be able to go back and correct. FOR SHAME. Despite*** not knowing wtf he is talking about at all.  But here he is on Joe Biden working to appeal to evangelicals “No religion, no anything... hurt the Bible, hurt God”
He gets hand cuffed 1 minute after Biden is sworn in.
Biden 50%, President Trump 36%
We must ensure Biden-Harris win the electoral college AND the popular VOTE
Biden says a mandatory mask mandate will save 40K lives in the next three months. So at a (generous) 1% death rate, that means there would have to be 4 MILLION NEW CASES in the US between now and Election Day. #notgonnahappen
The world is already laughing that Biden is the best that the DEMs could come up with.
The Biden/Harris photo was perfect. Made in sketchy light. Really great.
Jill Biden and Douglas Emhoff are building a beautiful virtual friendship
Perhaps, but you have to admit Trump inherited an economy that was roaring along, while Obama inherited one that was in a death spiral. Ironically, if Biden wins, he’ll inherit an economy in worse shape than the one Obama did.
So isn’t it time to enthusiastically endorse Biden/Harris? Your dad would.
You realize you said overt fascism about the current President of the United States, and are still willing to give him 4 more years? You think this place will be around in 2024 or 2028? Seriously? By then he will have nabbed Putin-like control. We can at least hold Biden to the🔥
That, and Biden's sign interpreter.
So if your waiting for stimulus checks to pass might as well not it’s gonna be a election issue his year each person Trump and biden will say vote For me and I’ll Give you a bigger stimulus watch
I wonder when Biden found out who his VP candidate was going to be? #ChinaJoeBiden  . Standing for the flag is patriotic not wearing a mask. .    . Biggest losers.
Nonsense, Democrats assure me, Berners who don't vote for Biden/Harris are under the influence of Russia.
Don't believe a word Biden says. Pure bullcrap pulled out of thin air. Remember, Biden liked Robert KKK Bird. #NeverDemocrat
Biden. You made a bold face lie about wearing masks and saving lives. Nobody could say with any accuracy that wearing a mask will save 40,000 lives. Total bullcrap. Standing for the flag is Patriotic, not wearing a mask. When are you going to answer questions from media?
I love it - my former party members are now “Republicans for Joe Biden!”  I knew there were still good and bright Republicans!  #RepublicansForBiden
An Encouraging Rollout for the Biden-Harris Ticket  via
Kamala Harris is everyone’s worst nightmare. Thanks no balls Biden.
Also...Biden has 50 years of lies to answer for, so can't wait to see if he gets asked similar questions.  Oh, wait...he won't even take questions.
I really hope either Biden or Harris have Moist Von Lipwig on speed dial cuz once they in office, we gon’ need him.
THIS is leadership. Not Joe Biden.
What would you do?  Some guy on a moped drives by my house daily and screams expletives towards my Biden yard sign. There are young children on my block.
I wonder, too. You could say the DNC strategy was a success since it beat Bernie Sanders. Seems like a costly victory, though, if you permanently lose a good part of your base, which I think the party has. Then pick a limp candidate like Biden and search for political Viagra. Wow
Hope in Joe Biden.... ok... 🧐. Your TDS is over 9000!
She knows Biden’s winning. She’s trying to find the way to deal with that
Really? Joe Biden had 50 years in government, and didn’t “fix” this. Now, all of a sudden, it’s a priority and he can fix it.  Nope, not buying it!
Those are completely made of statistics. Multiple sources and polls say that only about 10% of Sanders supporters won't be voting for Biden and for Yang idk. But either way, you're lying out of your ass and making yourself look like a fool
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia  via
I'm confident the Biden/Harris admin will be capable of so much more than a toothless memo. We're gonna need a stronger Constitution.
No. There is no saving us now. Neither Biden nor Trump will do anything to curb the corporations that are ruining the planet. In fact, they will help. Bernie was the only hope for policies and actions that might save us and the planet.
Biden and Harris call for three-month nationwide mask mandate
Hey Hiden Biden, Take your face mask mandate and shove it up your ass. #MasksOffAmerica
Whom do Democrat Catholics serve? Taking a stand yet?  Franklin Graham: Dem Pro-Abortion Ticket ‘Great Concern to All Christians’  via
Should there be a national mask mandate?  Presumptive  Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, wants one.. what do you think?   will talk about it with you tomorrow morning on West Michigan LIVE.
When I watch Mr.Biden and listen to his,as people say,rambling on,and lack of putting words together too form intelligent speech.  I feel sorrow for him,and at Sametime shame for his staff,and family for keeping him in the limelight. Let the poor man retire. He really needs help
Election gambling odds. You bet $100 to win $43 with Biden ($143 payout) or You bet $100 to win $125 with trump ($225 payout) . You could bet $100 on Kanye and if he wins you win $50,000 ($50,100 payout). Something to watch. Trump was +1150 at a point in 2016.

To bad you don’t know the truth. Our President built the economy from the bad one Obama and Biden couldn’t bring back in 8 years . Matter of fact trump made the best economy our country has ever seen before, because our President killed all the bills that stopped
Yes. They are probably staunch supporters of Biden and the like.
I don't feel about Joe Biden.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
Name calling shows me a lot. Smh. Do better. Biden is horrible and trump would be the lesser of the 2 evils
I think it's not true. It seems like they called for governors to require mask wear:  but I can read the comments either way.
hey Donald, do you what will happen if you lose the election? Biden will sign the hero’s act and you’ll look like an uncaring ass. Your screwed up team of    are sabotaging your election chances. Are you that Blind?
Fully agree. I haven’t seen a single person who I’d consider as “far-left” excited about Biden or Harris.
Biden &amp; Harris can stuff their masks where the sun don't shine!
Hes also probably closer to Biden’s views than AOC
Hey  I don’t appreciate being used as your strawman. This holier-than-thou approach is why incremental change is so hard for the left.  Also, if you think Biden/Harris would truly be as bad as the current assholes, you are out of your collective goddamn gourds.
So, here we have  announcing an historic peace agreement in the Middle East.  And the best Biden can do is demand masks on everyone for the next three months - even if you’re not within 10 miles of another human being. What a sad &amp; scary excuse for a leader.
Fascism is already here. You already live in a police state. We already have concentration camps. Biden/Kamala will not save you from this, they ARE this.
every time i hear biden and harris being described as “far left” my already dead soul dies even further just that much more

ohhhh what i would do to see a trump vs biden debate 💀😂
it's where Biden sits
We can vote AND tear it all down, it's definitely an option.  Just the harm reduction of voting Trump out of office makes it worth doing IMO even if Biden and Kamalla are horrible.  Just don't forget to fight them as well, we can't have the left go to sleep like during Obama
I believe the Biden Harris ticket will do much more for the progressive movement moving forward than trump will. There is more hope with them in office than what we have right now!
The problem with 3rd party voting by progressive democrats, its a vote taken away from removing trump from office for no other reason but to hope and protest. Why not give the Biden Harris ticket a shot to show they will listen to progressive ideals and put some in place to start
Why are you endorsing Biden/Harris? Thanks though.
Wait....Democrats want everyone to be vegan?   Hmmm.  I’ll still vote for Biden.
Kamala Harris believed Joe Biden's accusers — until she didn't  #KamalaHarris
If you thing feeble Joe Biden is going to be good for America after 47 years in government, you might no be too intelligent.    #BidenIsARacist
Not to mention tRump is projecting onto Biden what Americans already do to him.
And what other 'camps' will happen in the future if Biden wins? #scarythoughts
Just one of the many reasons to vote Biden/Harris 😇
I am so over people complaining about Biden being the nominee. I’m sorry, I don’t love him either, but some of y’all need to learn to accept it before Trump gets re-elected.
Biden and Kamala have locked up more black people than anyone in history..a speech doesnt undo that.. theyre both garbage!!! 💯
Will you be voting Biden/Harris? Asking for a country.
Trump breaks everything he touches. Hopefully a Biden administration will be able to restore the department’s image as mentioned in the article. Congress should also look at legislation to prevent the DHS from being used inappropriately in the future.
Or, as someone put it a couple days ago, she could be a sack of potatoes with a smiling face and I'd still vote for Biden.
It's true that African Americans didn't show up in quite as large of numbers, though in 2008 they voted with 60% and 2016 it was 59%.  As a Michigander, I knew Trump would win. But he's lost a lot of support here. And every third party voter I know from 2016 = Biden.
Trump campaign uses the totally false claim that dead people vote.  Trump campaign uses a dead persons Twitter account to attack Biden and Kamala.  Vote decency and truth, Vote #BidenHarris2020   #ONEV1
Absolutely none. She is more fake than Biden and the people need to see that.
Other than being the most pro-abortion ticket in history, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are puppets for the pro-China, open borders, Wall Street Chamber of Commerce crowd. They'll continue policies that ship jobs oversees while shilling for Big Tech
OMG you still have millions out of work and hours are being cut a monthly 2000 STIMULUS per person is what biden said hes going to do if he is the president its about the people not Trump's agenda TRUMP DOES NOT CARE about the people only HIMSELF 😥
One Biden/Harris rally &lt; One Trump Boat Rally
This is the future of the Biden/Harris Administration. This stuff will go on and on and on without end. Think before you vote.
Aww was Harris mean to your buddy that was bought &amp; paid for by you? We are still trying to figure out how he paid off all his bills with cash. I hope the Biden/Harris admin look into that. I'll take an angry/mad Black women over a LYING POS like you!
I am not dismissing a priori the case for Trump &gt; Biden.  That doesn’t when we (Catholics) should adopt the rhetorical style, obnoxiousness, bellicosity, and internal incoherency which comprise the four pillars of his administration and shout, “INTEGRALISM!”

Republicans trying to figure out how to bash joe biden's vp pick after joe biden has practically chosen a republican 😑 🤔
Just suddenly remembered last night that one of my best friends had a cat named Joe Biden.
Biden picked VP who slept w/married man, 30 yrs older than her, to get appointed to government commissions paying over $400,000. Isn't that theft? Corruption? Conflict of interest?
Biden picked VP who slept w/married man, 30 yrs older than her, 2 get appointed to government commissions paying over $400,000. Isn't that theft? Corruption? Conflict of interest?
I use tweetdeck so much I don't know how to navigate the native twitter site.  Detroit Free Press did a thing on Whitmer's hesitation. She's young and probably wants to build a stronger party base as governor.   Unless Cain had a scoop on Biden, he wouldn't have known
THIS WOULD BE AMAZING IF IT HAD A MONTHLY 2000 DOLLAR STIMULUS IN IT BECAUSE ITS NOT JUST HEALTHY PEOPLE GETTING TJIS AND DYING FROM IT ITS EVERYWHERE SO WEATHER IF UR HOMELESS OR WHO EVER YOU ARE A MONTHLY 2000 STIMULUS WOULD REALLY HELP.
I am still incredulous that Kamala Harris likened coronavirus to Ebola to demonstrate Biden’s ability to lead by stopping an Ebola pandemic. 😂🤣Ebola was an outbreak. 4,000 miles from the U.S. We got 2 cases. It’s going to be a long 3 months.
In ‘must-win’ Michigan, Trump campaign takes fight door to door as polls show Biden with strong lead
You mean the Biden 💩???  Nope, we don’t.
Joe Biden mangaled it too!!! And she's his running mate!
You're incapable of having an honest conversation.  I literally advocate for doing all of that RIGHT NOW alongside voting.  I reject that I'll be "at the mercy of Biden" any more than we're at the mercy of someone worse right now.
You never Trumpers don’t want to watch Biden make a fool of himself.  I used to respect you.
Because I care about harm reduction?  Because I'm more under threat by Trump than Biden, even if only a little?
There is only one reason we now have a Biden-Harris ticket....even the Democrats want Trump to WIN!  #MAGA  #Trump2020  #GodBlessTheUSA
Just as I would under Biden because he is also bad
He has scared this white person, right to the point of voting for Joe Biden.
Then why are you spending so much time attacking me, someone whose MAIN FUCKING GOAL is to bully Biden into adopting better policy?
My entire argument is to bully Biden, you're the one saying to keep Trump in office
YES I KNOW, IM NOT TELLING ANYONE TO STOP FIGHTING BACK IM LITERALLY JUST SAYING VOTE FOR BIDEN AND THEN FIGHT BIDEN WHILE HE'S IN OFFICE BECAUSE TRUMP IS WORSE
YES, AND THAT IS LESS BAD AND MAKES IT EASIER TO FIGHT BACK. Do you realize you're literally arguing to keep Trump in office because Biden won't be good enough?  The only choices are Trump or Biden right now, I hate Biden but you're fucking stupid if you think he's just as bad.
I never defended any of these people.  But if you don't think that things will at least be a LITTLE less awful when Biden is in office and we can bully the fuck out of him, agitate, and protest, then you're just lost buddy.  I hate Biden and I haven't ever defended these people
Yes, that's why I fight fascism... but that doesn't mean you shouldn't also engage in harm reduction through electoral means when Trump literally is using secret police, brutalizing protesters, and threatening us to a much greater degree than Biden is.
No, of course Joe Biden doesn’t own
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event
You sick old man. I am WOMEN, HERE ME ROAR, Talk about something really important like how many people have died under your lack of leadership!! Do you think God is happy with you, or any of us for that matter. Talking about Biden and how God feels about him.
Good luck getting anywhere with the Biden Harris ticket.
Maybe somebody needs to let Biden know that. Today during his announcement with Kamala present, he referred to her as Kamela. You know like Pamela only with a K.
Please don’t write any more headlines containing the phrase “Biden tapping a woman”
That’s my point. Biden should be asked those questions too. They all should.
Amen
So you’re telling me Joe Biden is the old dude from O Brother, Where Art Thou?
Give up.  VP Biden and Sen Harris are going to show you the door.
Give up.  VP Biden and Sen Harris are going to wipe the floor with you.
Give up.  VP Biden and Sen Harris are going to kick your ass.
Speculation or assumption. I bet its the "dirt" on Biden and his son Hunter. Remember back when Rudy went to the Ukrain looking for evidence on Hunter and Joe Biden? Yeah bet they pull that joker card out of thin air. They'll say Biden is a criminal or some shit like that. Watch.
Very good article.  While reading it, I thought about how Abp Gregory would handle a president Biden presenting himself for communion and then exiting the church to immediately promote abortion on demand to the assembled press gaggle while holding his bible.
Wyoming Here   /  all the way in this family! On a side note my son turns 18 this year &amp; is also Biden/Harris all the way!
That's what I say to.
Glad you'll base your vote on policy. I'm appalled that Biden's VP pick was limited on criteria - race and gender. He shut out so many other accomplished candidates just because of their biological traits. I do believe that's the true definition of racist and sexist.
Trust me took time. Trial and oh several errors. but the wait was well worth it. Don't know if the age difference makes the differents... shhh don't tall anyone, I'm 52 he is 38. So there is that. 😊
has biden figured out how to login to twitter yet
Liberal leaning Mom asked what I thought about Biden's pick; my response  - I don't agree with picking candidates based on race or gender.
Have to say I found my guy on a video game I came to WY to meet him in person after phone dating for 6 months. I even came to WY in Jan. "Born in Chicago" so I know snow. 🤣 We have been together since 2008, have a 11 year old son together with my other 2 older kids. &amp; Very Happy
Obviously he is scared that Biden won’t show.
Yeah signs for 45 up all over the place. Here and in Montana. I don't understand any of them. I don't feel safe putting a Biden sign up because they are die hard here and they might burn down my house. Not kidding either. So me &amp; my family &amp; close friends just say hidden. 🤣
Yeah I don't think you can get much redder then Wyoming. That's the only thing that sucks about WY. I just don't understand how they can back someone that has done so much damage to farmers. I just don't get it here. But luckily I still have my family to talk to none are for 45!
I want over 1/2 of Biden’s cabinet to be women AND his choices need to be vetted and doled out dribble dribble dribble
C’mon man (Joe Biden voice)! You can’t just say crap like that and bounce!!
"Less people suffer under Biden than Trump"  I don't think that's true. Biden hasn't meaningfully committed to dismantling anything trump has put into place and given how democrats govern it's certain that he won't reverse most or any programs trump has enacted.
"on core legislation and aren't betraying"  what issues do biden/harris agree with the left on?  ICE? M4A? Corruption? Taxes? Police Violence?
I hear what you’re saying and I thought surely they were going to replace Biden too! But I think they would have done it before he picked his VP. I think he’s it.
Joe Biden looks amazing in his well fitted suits.
Biden is doomed
Me too, but I think Kamala will inject some more newsworthy and positive press. I’m in Michigan and the 300 lbs orange fatass is 12% behind Biden right now. He will not win Michigan again. If he does win The GOP will not win the Senate. We can Impeach that MF’r for good this time
Weird Al Yankovick would be more help than Biden in making a tough decision.
No I’m not much of a FB guy. I got on here mostly to f*ck with Trump any way possible! I screwed up by voting for him in 2016. I’m trying to atone for it, so I got on here and will see if can do more for Biden/Harris campaign. Thank you for a laugh! It is healthy, keeps you young
We have several, because we are hunters here. Not just BS hunters, I mean we have gotten our hunting license, have our kill processed so we get the meat out of it. Lovely roasts, steaks, hamburger "Not hamburders 🤣" &amp; sausage made from it. Nothing goes to waste. The right way!
didn’t biden tell Obama not to kill bin laden?
Good for Biden/Harris. It's way better then a racist traitor sitting in the WH! You know the guy that has allowed 160,000+ American's to die because he did nothing for 70 days when it started, "oh that's right he called it the Dem's HOAX" Remember 15 closer to 0.. He was LYING!
VP Biden, they’re removing mail counting machines. They’re completely dismantling the postal service. There needs to be a nationwide plan by the DNC. Ballot drop boxes everywhere? Something must be done. Mail in isn’t going to work. This is getting really scary.
They dont care about those ones i guess the ones biden supposedly touching
As i said will be damn hard to do worse than trump. So im willing to bet biden will be far better
I started clapping to fill in the awkward, uncomfortable silence that followed after Biden introduced Harris, as she was approaching the podium.

Suburban mother absolutely voting Biden/Harris.
I’m still in shock the lefties aren’t gonna replace Biden! Anybody thought about that? He’s really it! They’re really gonna go with him! 🤣
I'm not saying but trump anything. Biden will be better than trump for progressive agendas period. Can't change my mind
Saying joe will be just as bad is speculation at best. Having an actual person in office that listens is far better than a man who listens to no one on anything because hes the smartest person in every room. Not changing my mind. We will be better off with biden. Period
I was not even considering Biden. But after the announcement today, Harris is the VP, I will consider.
I haven't made an excuse stated a fact on what the video is. Its ignorant that all people want to do is point out his past while largely ignoring trumps past and present to this very day. You want to vote 3rd party that has 0 shot at winning this time around to spite biden
Not to mention the countless other groups who are significantly more at risk under Trump than we would be under Biden.  It's not to say he isn't awful or that you shouldn't criticize him, you should and he is, it's that we have to not allow a literal fascist to win
Yeah, but we don't have to support him.  There's a difference.  I hate Biden and as soon as he beats Trump, the kid gloves come off and I'll be every bit as vicious against him as I am against Trump.  I just can't not vote when Trump's re-election is a threat to my very existence
I haven't actually.  I've been having a really hard time getting myself around to voting Biden and I will absolutely argue that it's the least bad option but nowhere have I told anyone not to criticize Biden.
Yeah, &amp; got paid well for it too. Burisma, &amp; China are the most relevant foreign policy experiences of the Biden clan. If only the kickbacks can be applied to lessen the economic impact of the Democrat wish list. Living on the dole is no way to go through life.
It’s mind-blowing to me that people who lived through 2016 still say things like “the next President” &amp; “the next Vice President” re: Biden/Harris 🤦🏻‍♀️ Like, I did this too. It feels incredibly dumb to look back on now. Yes, polls look good. But polls aren’t votes. So just...stop.
Trump tries to paint Kamala Harris as both too liberal and too moderate
Yes. The moron line was negative, but I'm sure people know what I mean. It's either Trump or Biden. Anything else is a waste of time and energy. From the top on down and back up, a Blue ticket will get us out of GOP hell.
I don't want to vote for Biden, but voting for him and getting him elected puts Trump out of office who is actively a fascist and doing unspeakable things that probably would at least be easier to combat under Biden
Still seeing so much butt hurt. Warren was my choice too for president. But guess what? It didn't happen. I got onboard with Biden immediately. Because I'm not a moron. Negative energy will never create the change you want. Numbers matter. We have to get a super majority. Period.

Can't I settle for Biden and say people should vote Biden but also shit on him and his VP pick because they're actually awful?  I 100% agree that it's a war against the fash but let's not kid ourselves about what we are being forced to vote for.
Biden &amp; Harris vs Trump &amp; Pence. I'll  sleep easy tonight. Trump 2020!
Most of them know her general nature is that of a slaver and a ruthless overlord . She already has plans to get rid of Biden and if they win he won't last 10 months if that.
Mayor Lightfoot: Biden Key to Getting Gun Control for Chicago... just what the law abiding citizens need. 🙄
Both are already left. Ows and dapl i do not get what your point is when concerning biden on either one. And biden supported the patriot act to a certain extent. Not fully. Trump and biden are not the same and that's extremely dangerous to spread that rhetoric
Yep.  Put  into the browser and landed here.  Don’t miss the ActBlue statement at the bottom.  Guess Antifa is endorsing Biden.
“Fatilities” “Doxxers”...yet, he nicknamed Biden, Sleepy Joe! Donald himself, just today, cannot properly pronounce common everyday words like “Doctor” or “Fatalities” but has 2 grown sons trying their best to convince us Americans that it’s Joe who cannot read. It’s an SNL skit!
Exactly. And the Biden/Harris ticket IS a higher standard than Trump/Pence. But, apparently all of you highly intellectual people who know more than the rest of us get to piss moan and cry about how things don’t match your higher standards. It gets old. Again, grow up.
Absolutely, was the only reason I hoped that VP Biden wouldn't pick her for his VP.
What a "tell" you're making here. Admitting Biden isn't capable of debating President Trump.  Oh and just fyi... Tulsi cleaned Kamala's clock on the debate stage. Pence will also defeat her in the VP debate.
Easiest job in the World? Crowd control at a Biden/Harris rally.
Keep up the good work...this media propaganda machine must be checked...everyone should take the hands of those that listen only to the msm and force feed them the ACTUAl truth.... as for biden....what a tool!
I got all teary eyed listening to Kamala y💯talk about Beau Biden. She’s the one, She’s gonna be damned good! Way to go Joe ❤️
I Joe Biden is "slipping", I'm in trouble. I couldn't pull off a speech like that if my life depended on it and I had 6 years to practice. 🤣
Biden &amp; Harris will not win. Say goodbye to your communist ideology.
Old people love to be like “I’m not happy about biden but we have to fight like hell to get trump out!” But to them “fighting like hell” means yelling at young people to vote and then not doing anything else. Maybe you guys should try campaigning harder :-)))
Biden had 50 years to make a difference and now he talks like he can change the world What a  Piece of shit dont buy it
Biden is doing a decent job of reading his speech.
Omg joe biden is soooooooooooooooo ooooooooooolllllllllddddddddd
Biden just laying it out like it is. Being direct, as he should be.
WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden introduces Kamala Harris as his running mate
Around 11% of Wyoming's electricity was generated by renewable energy in 2018, 4/5 from wind power. Wind is an abundant resource in WY as it gains strength blowing over the mountains &amp; across the prairies.  wants to increase clean energy jobs in US. WY needs Joe Biden!
Biden and Kamala are live from Wilmington. We must do everything we can to get them elected. This is vital.
Dammit to hell! Biden and Harris probably won't start talking until after my 5pm meeting starts.  Glad I'm recording!
…We treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor. We are the United States of America. And together, there is not a single thing we cannot do.”    🇺🇸  — Joe Biden

Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and his VP, Kamala Harris, will host their first campaign event together today in Wilmington, Delaware. Tune in to  at 4:30 for the special report.
Honestly, when I read the inflamed tweets of people saying they'll never vote for Biden/Harris, I cannot tell if they are honest or if they are dense Trump supporters attempting to ratf*ck us into depressing the vote.
A great endorsement for Biden/Harris.
Dr. Biden, I am so hopeful to see your work as First Lady.
If you honestly think people believe your bullshit, you’re nuts. Biden...a devote Catholic attends church. Maybe the pandemic has temporarily closed some but once dumb Trump is out of office hopefully we can get the virus under control and we can get back to normal.
Wel, got 1 ✋. I work for a coal company and I may not like some of da things that Pres Trump does r says but he is da only one that is leving the door open for coal. We may hve to work hardr to keep it but its bettr than what I would have to look frward to w Biden. #votemywallet

Anyone know what time Biden/Harris is supposed to speak this afternoon??
Suburban housewife here. I will be voting Biden/Harris if I need to crawl to the polls.
Still trying to figure out what Lebrons stands for I thought he was fighting racism and prison reform but supports Biden and Harris, and China shits getting Wierd
I just want to get this out of the way, I will be voting for Biden/Harris. That being said I absolutely will reserve the right to be fully pissed off that THIS is what we’re being forced to choose.
In a fist fight I would probably take Biden.  He seems like he's good at taking hits to the head.     In a debate I have to take Trump because Biden often seems to forget where he's at.  In an election. 🤦‍♂️
Y’all know people can want to get Trump out of there more than they dislike Biden and Kamala right? Us expressing how we feel doesn’t mean we aren’t voting.
If you're not voting for Biden/Harris...you are a tRump supporter! Not voting, voting 3 party, voting for 45...all means you are a tRump supporter! How is 45 working out for you? If good, then YOU are the problem!
Buddy I litteraly said fuck Biden look at my header
I'm embarrassed to see Biden signs in my neighborhood. How do people get that clueless?
And Biden is better I’m a single issue voter gun rights
It’s actually a simulation. They ran the election simulation 40,000 times and Trump won 29/100 on average and Biden won 71/100.
Expect the 25th amendment to come into play if there is a Biden-Harris victory.
The problem with USA is we’re already too wall-street Goldman Sachs. Kamala harris nor joe LegHair Biden nor trump helps that at all.
Already calling it the HARRIS/biden ticket.....presumptuous
Joe Biden couldn't fill a phone booth!
Probably, but it's the biden guy whose on here posting about how he would vote for hitler over trump.
Now they have given 45 the chance and he failed. They like Biden.
His whole job is to siphon young white male votes away from Biden. Everyone with a functioning frontal lobe would know that.
Oh, but just watch the instantaneous flip if Biden wins.
Who's he kidding! She wasn't anyone's choice, let alone Biden. Some staffer picked her name out of the hat of Black Women Demoncratic Radicals. #JoeAndTheHoe
Well I see Biden sniffed out a running mate. I will wait to see if he makes it to the election.
Oh How About 3 Each! 4 Pres. DEBATES 3 VP Debates  More info The Better If Your a Winner you Should Stand  Loud n Proud  Picking Kami Who Black Folk Hate Dems Just Banned TyT liberal News From Convention  Kami is Like a JellyFish. Too Funny  Truth; StatusQuo Joe Biden/ Fake Kami
The man performed a “gay marriage” ceremony for Pete’s sake.  Biden’s done a little more than advocate on both issues wouldn’t you say?

Biden has publicly and repeatedly stated his refusal to submit to the Roman Pontiff in regard to gay marriage and abortion, as well as actively working in opposition to those Church teachings, and is therefore outside communion with the Church.  That is a demonstrable fact.
Why is it that no one wants Biden on the debate stage?
Jerome Alexander for Biden's Transportation Secretary. I'd throw a party, and open top shelf bottles. 🍾🥃🕺
Incredulity, Heresy, Apostacy, and Schism are the options.  There is no “Bad” on the list.  Apostacy does not apply to Biden.
this is probably a long shot but i hope biden and harris really wake up and listen to the people and start to fix this corrupt system.
Biden/Harris will absolutely kill your kids and maintain everything the current Trump administration is doing.  That's what they're being paid to do.
i don’t like biden or harris but do i want another 4 years of a fucked up, bible-wielding, uber-conservative tr*mp administration?? HELL NO!
Biden VP Pick Prompts Support, Criticism In Michigan
To be honest I just am not happy about it. I didn’t like Biden I’m the first place and now he’s picking Harris. I liked her for how she actually criticized the man but now she’s throwing that out the window and saying she’s “honored” to be his running mate????
There’s one simulations where Biden wins by more than 400?? Lol holy shit that’s the dumbest model ever
With Biden being listed as a criminal suspect in Russia, it would be grounds enough for him to step down and allow Kamala to take over.
Biden/Harris might as well be a republican ticket
💥Me, too! Biden/Harris!
Well, Biden's VP nomination is the scariest one if you like your guns and your thoughts! She will take them both away, and take your money, and we are on our way to Venezuela! Watched her treat an innocent man absolutely despicable!! Scary times we are in!!
Would really help of the american public could grasp ‘chance to win’ vs actual polling numbers. They can’t, so this stuff from Nate makes people think Biden is up 42 points
Keep your models to yourself, idiot. The populace is too dumb to understand ‘chance of winning’. They think that means Biden is up 71/29 in actual polls. You did this shit in 2016 and caused major issues.
If white supremacy doesn't end, America would. Did you hear me? The Civil War was God's first punishment to this nation because of slavery &amp; America is still not listening. Their fight against black lives to matter? Biden &amp; Harris has to respect us or America loses
Kamala Harris is officially Joe Biden’s running mate. Michigan supporters say it’s about time.

I can’t stop thinking that Tulsi would beat Trump in a landslide but here we are with Biden and Harris and another 4 years of Trump.
Biden released 20+ years of tax returns.    Nothing to hide with Biden because he isn’t a currupt con man stealing from the American people like trump.   trump proves he has something huge to hide, corruption, fraud, and his failure as a “business man”
We’re not comfortable with a foreign nation interfering with our elections. Last time I checked Hunter wasn’t running for president. There’s no indication that China is acting at the same level as Russia in trying to get Biden elected. Only idiots think China created this virus.
The "suburban housewife" is a fascist-right fiction suggested to you so that you stop losing your shit around your staff. Women in my neighborhood (just outside of Grand Rapids, MI) are appalled by your misogyny and race baiting. The Biden/Harris signs are going up!
All in all I think this is a big arrow upward for Biden in an election that I don't think is going to be close no matter who his VP candidate is.
Remember how everyone loovved ice cream eating Joe Biden when he was Obama’s VP and now all the sudden he’s evil? That’s called a smear campaign. Republicans want you to think he’s evil so their candidate wins. That’s literally politics.. I’ve had it up to here with you motherfuc
Tucker Carlson calls Biden-Harris the 'first entirely hollow presidential ticket in American history'  #FoxNews
I'm comforted by the fact that all these The Bachelor fans🌹will have the stability of a Biden Harris administration in which to wring their hands and gnash their teeth.

Encourage Joe Biden to join in. He sounds like he is in stage 3 alzheimers now. 👍😇
Biden/Harris.....Knee pads &amp; pee pads..........#votered
So often we don't get what's obvious in politics. Candidates need to make big splashes to take the headlines. But Biden's choice of Harris tells me that his administration will elevate and prioritize calm, stability, and logic.  #BidenHarris2020
Kamala WILL DESTROY pence and trump. Biden has been too above the fight. Kamala will take it to them, be in their face and not let them get away with anything . Cheeto and pence’s worst nightmare
Sharing memes about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a really fucking stupid way to show you’re not pleased with the choice. They’re our only hope to get Trump out of office and you’re potentially hurting that by shitting on them as well.
Why would Biden want a Republican as his VP?
Ronald Reagan warned us against Biden
The best you can hope for from Biden being elected is a bunch of interpretationalist federalist judges restricting your rights and solidifying the grip of their master's corporate masters on every facet of life.
The Senate and House tend to swing opposite of the POTUS. The Senate is red and that's not going to change. The house is blue but if Biden gets elected in two years it will be red. In both cases the only change that can occur is to the party platform, and there's no incentive.
Democrats genuinely believe that they need the white vote, to the point where they'll ignore this. Hence Biden. Hence Harris.  They don't understand that they've lost the white vote for decades.
Joe Biden on SVU. 😬 This did not age well.
Let's do this! #BidenHarris

How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: Inside the history-making VP pick
Like I'm sorry do not fucking guilt me to vote in this election I'm fucking sick and a vote for Biden/Harris isn't protecting anyone
Entirety of conservatism: "Look at Biden/Kamala being hypocrites!"  Biden/Kamala: Lol we're gonna fuck.
Trump Campaign: Biden sees race!  Minorities: Kill white people lol
Biden benefits from this angle.
Kamala Harris would be a reasonable vice presidential pick for a young, vigorous, healthy presidential candidate. But because of Biden’s age and apparent mental fragility, Kamala’s seeming lack of gravitas could make voters nervous. President Pence or President Harris?
I agree. But I figured Biden would cost Biden.
I can’t stand Facebook joe Biden worshippers lmao like please leave me alone
Hoo boy, this is awkward, but actually, Craig ... Biden just picked someone else
Yeah, but they've done pissed off more of their base than Hillary's selection did and check out the wording of the quoted tweet. Not the only one implying Biden is stepping aside before being sworn in.
It would be crazy to hear a free press ask Joe Biden questions. I would love to hear him respond to questions about Hunter’s Kid with the lady of the pole? Proud grandpa or would he deny it. Dumb we don’t know! I don’t think he knows. Just think of the questions!!!
Didn’t vote for him or Clinton in 2016. Won’t vote for either Trump or Biden this time. Vote for actual good candidates instead of the tired cyclical party politics that’s gone in for 20 years.
Seeing some people on here actually hint at retaliation for Biden's choice. You are not progressives. You are not woke. You are just as bad as what we're fighting against. Take your "conviction" and shove it. This election decides whether this country exists anymore. 🤦🏼‍♂️
Kamala Harris named vice presidential running mate to Joe Biden  via
I’ll still vote for Biden, but ffs did he have to choose a literal cop in the year 2020? And somehow the left will tell me that this is in “honor” of George Floyd.
Biden and Harris suck. All it will do substitute one horrible group of people for another.

I believed in Tulsi. She's the only politician I have ever contributed to financially which made it especially heartbreaking when she backed out and endorsed Biden. I didn't take it as hard as  but shit man. She could have made real change. That was the problem.
Listen. It’s Biden Harris or we’re leaving the country.   This is not hyperbole.
I agree 100% she was my pick but I didn't post about my choice because I would like any and still vote for Biden no master who.. But I 100% hoped it would be her.
type  and after the slash put any amount of random letters or jibberish, and you'll find another savage burn against Biden 😂😂🤣🤣😂😂
Kamala Harris is gonna have Joe Biden arrested for nonviolent possession halfway through the first time. You heard it here first.
If Biden wins then we know the land of the free is lost, and we will have to come together to get it back, no matter what.
Fox News said” Biden taps Kamala “ now that’s funny
Now, Biden needs what Harris represents. Time for us to learn more about VP Harris.
Fmr Gov Blanchard on what his advice to  would be if a job with a Biden Admin were offered...
So y'all are already openly admitting that Biden probably doesn't have a full term in him?
🤣 If you think that'll be good just wait until the Presidential debate between Biden and POTUS... 🤣💀 sn I think Pence will debate her well. How quick will she shoot to identity politics or start spewing opinion on covid19... 🤣
Look Joe Biden can be deaf &amp; blind &amp; have both HIV &amp; AIDS at this point and ill vote for him. Anything better than the mf in there right now
Yeah, she loves Biden now after blasting him on the debate stage about bussing years ago! She also said she believed the woman who accused Joe of misconduct even though there was no follow through proof.
Your girl is going to cost Biden the election. 🤦🏼‍♂️
Benghazi fiasco that she lied about being caused by a anti-muslim video. Also unmasking people. However, Biden is in the middle of that whole mess too! January 5th 2017 hush hush meeting.
Like literally the first time I've been EXCITED about voting for Biden
Mitt wasn’t even that bad compared to Biden trump or Hillary
And miss the chance to watch Biden call Trump a liar in a place where trump can't run like a child?
fuck joe biden, vote green 💚
So uhh...ummm... 👀👀👀 Biden-Harris 2020 🤷🏻‍♂️
Tulsi would have been a much better candidate than Biden or Harris.
The Democrats have made the last 4 years about race. She accused Biden of being a racist. And is choosing to be his VP. You honestly don’t see a difference?
we should still acknowledge that biden is fucking awful lol
Doug, #biden leads us out of the horror of the last three years, and he can heal us. #trust
Tears? I'm honestly really looking forward to the Biden admin mostly because it's gonna be a shitshow, of course not nearly as bad as Trump but Democrats have a their own special way of fucking stuff up
Joe Biden is just emulating his mentor Obama who, when he announced his pick for VP, everyone said “What the F Why would you do that?”
Well, she secured the electoral vote for biden in california....hahahahaha
Republicans heads are exploding as they realize their cause is lost, and that the lying conman won’t win re-election ! “Kamala Harris is Joe Biden’s pick for Vice President”
Well Joe Biden Chose Kamala Harris This Trumpster Could not Be Happier Shes so Fake So Nasty And Not African American!   She Pretended to Be!      Until her Dad said Wtf?  She Put Parents in Jail For Truancy   Shes Never had a Add that Said Anything  Americans Hates Her!
The democrats have made the entire Trump administration about racism. She called Biden a racist. You’re not seeing any hypocrisy in that?
It's sad seeing so many go down that pity party road. The only way Biden will lose in 2020, is if "progressives" throw in their towels again. I'm sorry you didn't get your pick. But the world doesn't stop for you. If you vote third party or abstain, you're a Trumper. Period.
See you soon. Do you realize Biden has full blown dementia? This is the best you guys can do? What does this say about your vision? Defunding the police? So crazy.
Notice that Biden, like so many of us, apparently has to also dial in by phone in case the video locks up. 🤣No need to worry about it now! Democrats can now TEXT TO VOTE according to the new law Trump just passed! Since he didn’t want to fund the postal service they’re allowing it for Democrats.   TEXT the word: BIDEN TO: 30330   No registration/ID/signature/mask!   We did it!
But basement Biden is ahead by 7% in national polls with a margin of error of -24%
Joe Biden is calling for a 3 month mask mandate, but he hasn’t addressed the riots or the looting! GTFO
I look at Biden/Harris and they terrify me. He’s been a liar for his entire career. So phony he was forced out of the race for plagerizing last time he ran for pres. She says out loud that she believes Tara Reid yet still supports Biden. Can’t trust either to go against grain.

It really does.  If Trump wins 2 years from now we start nominating a progressive. If Biden wins a decade is wasted on shitty Centrist Corporate owned puppets.
Pick Trump. In 2 years we can nominate a Progressive. If Biden wins a decade is wasted on Corporate Puppets.
The only reason they chose her is so they can call Trump a woman hating racist. She doesn’t even need a brain. Now Biden looks less racist and they have 2 virtue signal boxes checked to respond to Trump with.

If I have to stand there 24 hours to vote for Biden, I will!
Your privilege is allowing your political purity to outweigh the needs of the many who will immediately benefit from Trump no longer being in office.  Is Biden perfect?  No.  Is he leagues better than Trump. Without question.  Your privilege blinds you to that.
Pretty sure this is a BIDEN BOT
Dr Biden: I believe this country is stronger when the least of us is supported and lifted up. A rising tide lifts all ships.   Melanie: A rising tide lifts the ships and make us the stronger country of the least people. Close enough.
Because that shit was laughable. ZOOM OUT. It’s so simple. He knew Biden had been super dirty in Ukraine. He asked to look into it. Dems spun it in an insanely dishonest way. It didn’t work. Guess what? HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT BIDEN. The rest was a legal assassination attempt. MISSED
Umm no. Not what happened. He said, they found no evidence of Russian collusion. What you just said was a false translation from the fake news. As far as Ukraine, Biden is up on  federal charges over there for crimes. All trump did was point it out. Dems are really that ballsy
How about Harris before being a vp candidate called Biden a racist and she also said she believed all his accusers in regards to sexual assault.
Change is happening  We will get better president for 2020 . Joe Biden for the win 💁🏼‍♀️🙏🏻
Vote for Biden/ Harris.What have you got to lose?
Biden will lock Trump,in the bunker.
And  will be the first to resist President Biden and a Democratic bill to raise corporate and upper income personal tax rates. But hey, he’s got those 4 delegates from America Somoa.
I never said it did.  To me voting Green is a way not to vote for Biden or Trump.  I am voting Trump. A vote he should never have got and a vote Joe is expecting based on my voter registration.
I respect your point of view. The corporate interests used millions to insert their corporate puppet and set back the progressives movement.  I would hate it if I voted green and Biden won.  A vote for trump is most revolting thing I can do to the cheating DNC.
I am voting trump because I hate Corporate owned puppets. Those folks are Republicans who like to feel good about themselves pretending to care about the less fortunate.   If trump wins in two short years we start nomination process. If Biden wins a decade is wasted.
I appreciate your point of view.    I am voting trump.   Why?  If Biden wins we don’t have a primary in 2024.  To hell with that. Four more years of trump is a million times better than a waste of ten years with Biden.
Biden / Harris ... lock em up
Biden/Harris..... Making America California. I’ll pass 👎🏽
Biden voted against the working class from 73-2009. He voted for cutting social security 4 times. He was for such liberal favorites as Citizens United. He is for no Wall Street or Banking super vision.   Which of those is driving you to vote Joe?  What votes Joe made do you like
He can reach into my pants. What does that even mean?  For 47 years he voted with GOP. Now a ten minute talk to Bernie and all is well?    Hell no buddy.  Never Biden.
I’m obviously bored here and am immaturely splitting hairs here but Biden served from 73-09 as a “ Republican “ err democrat Senator. 47 years in DC.  Shitty 47 years.  As you can tell I’m bored.  Take care
Prison populations will explode if people are dumb enough to fall for her and Biden’s bullshit
Ending the ACA is step 1 in implementing Medicare for All.  No problem so far.   Seriously Biden is the least attractive bring nothing to the table candidate in more than 50 years.  His nomination and failure to get elected will sadden so many Centrists. Thoughts and Prayers

She signed to agree with Trump on more than a few unsavory issues, and with the “Defund the police” sentiment being so strong atm it’s just another example of Biden being shortsighted in the face of his goals. “I Need to get my black vote back up, get a black lady right?” Wrong1
Not to me.  Biden is a Corporate owned puppet.  No Medicare for all no vote for Joe.
Look at the big picture.  Bernie had largest crowds at every rally. Huge stadiums at times.  Biden had a rally today. 63 folks showed up. Corporate interests are saving millions for themselves nominating Biden. I would rather lose to trump than be cheated by the DNC again.
Ma’am I’ve got many history books. Ever notice in school they never mentioned Nixon?  The history books our kids get in school is the history corporate America wants our kids to believe.   100 of the richest Americans forced Biden on us. We will do all we can to beat him
I’d  care if Corporate interests didn’t nominate Biden.  DNC cheats us. Then cry’s when GOP cheats them.
I won’t vote for Biden
What more could we ask for! She’s already proven to have zero integrity and just like Biden, the more she says, the worse she looks! Thank you Clintbama’s.... Excellent choice!

I’m not mad at you because of your pension. I’m happy and proud for you.  Your vote to these Corporate owned Puppets to continue voting against the working class.  I hate Joe Biden , the anti christ of the Dems. He voted against me 1973-20009. I can understand boomers like him.
Congratulations to Senator Harris and Vice President Biden for standing tall in adversity!! WELL DONE! Now we have to do our part VOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I bet 100.00 she is on a pension. Biden and the corporate elite voted to abolish those in the 70s for most of us. They were grandfathered in to keeping it.  My dad likes Biden too. He earned his pension and loves his party.  In my estimation this party dies with the boomers
Hey. You vote how you vote. I’ll handle mine.  The most damage I can do to this filthy Biden nomination is to vote trump.  The greens are a wonderful  option.  A trump vote is double damage. A vote trump should not have received and a vote a progressive would have got.
I understand your position. I was in it every election from 88 forward trying to get a Republican out of office.  Since we now nominate republicans I haven’t a worry in the world.  Either way these clowns are bad options. 1 has a max of 4 years left. Biden will waste 8.
The leverage will or will not be made in November.  If Biden wins progressive agenda is delayed a decade or more. Trump wins, we start fundraising at the mid terms.  We nominated a Republican. I prefer the other Republican which we can get rid of in 4 years.
That’s were our opinions differ. 100 of the richest Americans donate to the Super Pacs.  They decided Biden was best for them.  Now you decide if Corporate interests have scared you into voting for their choice?  I’m not scared.  Never Biden
If you think COVID - 19 is dangerous, Biden - 20 will destroy our country!
No chance in hell im voting Biden.  The corporate scare tactics are bullshit.  They bail themselves out every time anyway. 24 trillion deficit on the Conservative watch?  It’s all a bunch of bullshit. Never Biden.
...I barely rock with Biden and nothing could ever make me roll with Kamala!
WTF are you to judge my progressiveness?   DNC loaded up corporate puppets with cash to run against four progressives.  All corporate puppets lost. That is an act of political war.  Biden and every corporate puppet on all of our ballots should be voted against. Biden voted w GOP.
The positive would be a Biden Harris loss.
Biden sets the progressives movement back a decade if he wins.  He brings nothing to the table.  This democrat is voting trump and you should too.
We nominated a corporate owned pimp which would push progressive adgenda back a decade if he wins. If trump wins, at mid terms of his second term we could start backing a progressive.  No votes for Biden.
No . If Biden wants to run , he has to debate . Nobody gives a shit about the VP 🤷‍♀️
She’s a terrible person to be giving more power to , between her and Biden they will explode the prison population in this country
That’s exactly why I’m not voting for Biden.  Your comment meant for Dank just resonates in my mind. An anti Biden tv add should be produced using your very own beautiful words. Honestly you have talent.
Hell no. .....  Say Biden wins..... progressive agenda is pushed back a decade at best.  If Trump wins we start fundraising in 2 years for a progressive replacement to trump in 4 years.  No one who demands Medicare for All should vote for Biden.
Corporate interests picked Harris. Biden is the complete puppet.
HARRIS IS A HYPOCRITE WHO SAID SHE BELIEVED THE WOMAN WHO COMPLAIN THAT BIDEN IS A PEDOPHILE. HAVE A GOOD DEMOCRAT KKK
This VP is different. Even Biden says, he’s no spring chicken. Kamalalala is the Deep State’s choice for president! If Biden strokes all the way out, 🧨💥Who and what she is, shows everyone the utter lack of integrity &amp; willingness to be radical these LEFTIST CRATS truly are!
For now ... until December when Biden picks her for a cabinet post ...
“Trumps a racist, pervert, uses people of color for personal gain, babbling idiot!!”  And what did you and the DNC decide on?  A racist, pervert, using people of color for personal gain, can’t formulate a sentence (Biden’s not a babbling idiot like trump but it’s not great)
When something’s okay. “Believe all women” until it turned on Biden. “White people have to stop using people of color for personal gain” until Biden did it. “We need a president whose well spoken and not a hot head “ which Biden isn’t even close too.  “BUTTTT TRUMPPP”  Ya know,
*pretends to be shocked*  Biden, is completely using a women of color just for votes. Not because he believes she’ll do the best job. Sad. You know all the other outrage when white people, were using people of color to justify things they’ve said or done or this and that
Welcome to my Ted Talk.🐸🍵
“If you don’t vote and like Kamala Harris cause she a black women you’re racist and sexist. Hate her because of her views”  Is it okay to pick her strictly because she’s black and a women even though she isn’t most qualified, if at all??  “BIDEN WOULD NEVER THATS A TRUMP THING!!”
Her and Biden are chomping at the bit to gain more power and incarcerate more people than ever before
Kamala Harris is no “friend” of the people , between her and Biden more black people will end up incarcerated than ever before 🤷‍♀️
You do know Biden and Harris stance on crime and mandatory sentencing , they are the reason we’re in the mess we’re in now . Prison populations will explode if these 2 ass clowns get more power
Between her and Biden , the prison population will explode 🤷‍♀️
Taking on a prosecutor VP is suicide for Biden. He just lost a lot of pot smoker libertarian votes. I'm probably the only right wing pot smoker on earth.
Gotta remember, this isn’t a typical VP situation. Kamala is the deep state’s choice for PRESIDENT! We all know Biden’s not gonna make it very much further anyway but, the second they’re ready, they’d make him retire and have her in the oval. With her integrity... makes sense.
grand standing fraudulent virtue signaling politician of all. She was pleading to censor Trump on Twitter in order to get some cheers and when it didn’t land, she akwardly laughed through the lack of applause. She’s  screeching nails on a chalkboard FAKE. NO BUENO! NO BIDEN!
OMG  The woman that pointed out your racist behavior during the debates is now your running mate what is this world coming to? Show your white privilege Joe Biden your brain is mush old man
Maybe because they know the economy will survive since there’s no way Biden can win now 😂
The point in using those videos is to say “this is the type of nonsense that will continue if Biden is re-elected”. When he’s re-elected and the house flips over, the mess in those videos will be done. Voting him back into office will show the support is there to make it happen.

It means Biden is so racist, he can’t even keep it a secret. OVER &amp; OVER!
Do I just roll with people that are a lot further left than Biden/Harris, and they really ARE a good representation of most dems? Idk who I wanted him to pick, but she’s just never been someone I’m excited about.
You don’t understand because you don’t think backwards like a Democrat. It’s not about what she stands FOR. It’s a new way to attack Trump &amp; his voters. Anti-Biden/Harris will be considered “anti-women” &amp; “anti-people of color” 🙄 IT WONT WORK but, it will be PAINFULLY CRINGEY!👇🏽
How does any decent person say “I believe them” yet still support Biden? It’s one thing to be a little too flirty or make inappropriate comments, especially considering he grew up in a different era. Um excuse me..FINGER RAPING A STAFFER...UNFORGIVABLE!  Really Democrats? REALLY?
Well considering Biden doesn't even know where he is you better hope you're right on that.
you and Biden as a ticket have given me hope. I haven’t slept well since that lying Putin puppet was elected. Thank you. Tonight I can sleep. ❤️💚
You Ain't Black Biden?  Listen to yourself.  Get some perspective.
Are you on drugs?  Did they not have books in your school?  Joe Biden voted with the GOP from 73-09.  He can unify a damn thing. Don’t even let me get started on you.....
My fear is I’ve seen this movie many times before.  Biden wins the DNC will fuck up the next 10 years with their corporate puppets.  The key is to cause them to lose. And try again in 2024.
Crazy as it sounds......  I too thought of 3rd party.  Idiot Biden could still win.  I’m voting in a “ Bi-partisan manner for Trump”.  I hate trump. But I’m not wasting 4,8,12, up to 16 years on Biden and Harris corporate asses.
Kamala Harris used to work with Hunter Biden doing what who knows? She enforced that 1994 crime bill against black defendants to its full extent. As a student of former mayor Willie Brown , whom she had an alleged affair with  Willie said she would make a lousy president!
Was there any Democratic primary contenders more conservative than Biden and Harris? Seriously asking
Two racist people and Biden cannot even talk or form a sentence or answer questions Harris wants to defend police, to losses
This fella has a real good YouTube show.  I watch it daily.  He is a Republican but not the idiot wearing an AR15 to the grocery store kind.  Kind of a silly post,  maybe he is paid by the comment or retweet.  Biden’s nomination took me from MSNBC and politics until 2023 ....
Awesome. Didn’t she call Biden a racist and also say she believes Biden’s accusers! What a joke,
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris As Democratic VP Running Mate
Biden has to win first. Cast your vote wisely.  I don’t need a corporate owned incumbent in 2024. I’m voting trump. This way we can nominate a progressive or elect yet another Republican.  Corporate Dems are worthless
Why was msmbc so late in announcing Biden’s vp pick
Anyone have the clip/video of Harris crying about how racist Biden was for wanting segregated schools and busses? That’s one of my favorites.
If you vote for Biden your nightmare in Portland will just continue forever
Thankfully he is in MA and Biden will win that state by 20%
Trump replied: “He said that. Some people would say that men are insulted by that, and some people would say it’s fine. I don’t know.”  Somehow that became:   Biden is insulting men everywhere (without quotation marks”””btw!)  You really do have to be a detective to read the news
No reason to mail in now:   FOR DEMOCRAT VOTERS ONLY Now available:Text To Vote!   No registration required No ID required No Signature required  On Nov 3rd,   Text the word: BIDEN to # 30330
Wow he never said that. But since you can't remember what city you are in it makes sense you would say that. Nice new slogan SETTLE FOR BIDEN shows real enthusiasm huh.
Biden will do the debates... as long as Alan Dershowitz can be his champion and fight in his stead 😂
Yeah except even trump is trying to do something for the voters Biden doesn’t care about.  Kind of amazing we nominated a Corporate owned pimp.
I want them to roll up in that Corvette and do a big donut in front of Biden's house.
That's a bold face lie.  has done more for working Americans in 3 years than you have done in 40+. America cannot afford the Joe Biden 95+trillion dollar plan along with a tax hike for working Americans.

Have these all been researched to actually go to black people? Many of the ones shared are organized by companies who collect under the guise of helping black lives but research shows it goes to major political campaigns including Hillary, Bernie, and Biden.
Since when is it legal to go around all over TV lying about someone in order to damage their character? Could we go around saying it was actually China Joe Biden who started Covid by molesting a lab monkey and bringing it back to the US to secretly marry it?
Sounds like a great VP choice for Biden.... The only chance they have to win this election is to convert a good republican for VP😂
Uh-huh. And he says Biden is the one with cognitive difficulties.
Trump executive ordered it back into existence.  Biden sucks.  Looks like trump cares where Biden doesn’t.
Ted or whatever your real name is......  would you like me to post your campaign contributions from Corporate America.  More and more Americans are putting together that corporate interests pay you to vote against the people.  Your no Joe Biden or anything but you have no room
Joe Biden only cares about corporate interests. He has been a corporate puppet since 1973.  He is so weak and revolting he may lose.
The only thing Biden will be picking will be his ear. The deep state chooses everything he does from his outfits to his interviews.
He’s also quite handsome but, that also has nothing to do with my point. I’ll play along tho... fair to say, Biden doesn’t exactly have that gift either but, the press never comes at him even a little bit like they have with Trump. Anyone being honest, will see my point here.
man oh man, all my ignorant family members posting about how Joe Biden is a creepy pedo sure seem to forget that there is actually a creepy old man in our family who was accused and sent to jail for molesting his granddaughter, but we conveniently forget about that don't we?
That goes with the statement Trump made; If Joe Biden gets elected China will own this country. Scary!!!!!
But still pending VP pick to vote Biden?
Let's charge Ron Johnson with treason for using Russian propaganda to smear Biden. Don't believe his lies such an Russian asset
Obviously, it’s hard for anyone to imagine Biden coming up with an idea that would work but, don’t be fooled, he’s always had a staff of people coming up with his ideas for him🙄
Biden/Mary Trump 💝
All these Rose twitter 🌹 peeps that were foaming at the mouth for Biden to quit are impinge over hurdles for Alex Morse.
Imagine if the FBI tried to create false narratives that the Biden campaign colluded with Russia.
Raise your hand if you believe Joe Biden has signs of dementia and is incapable of remembering what he is talking about.
Wow, seems like a lot of the smartest people around are saying the same things about Biden... he seems so sharp on tv tho
LaBomba... “Just like Obama except a Hispanic because everyone knows they’re the divirsiest”   Now available: Vote for Biden by texting: BIDEN to # 30330   No ID required No signature required No Voter registration  necessary  Even better than mail-in ballots  Democrats only!
If my aunt had balls...she’d be my uncle!  Thankfully, Trump is no democrat and obviously, Biden isn’t Republican.   SADLY, we won’t hear much truth about anything political from our “free press” and since they’re making EVERYTHING POLIYICAL, don’t expect much truth from your TV
Never seen any evidence of Russia helping Trump. I hear it all the time but, haven’t seen one example.   Biden on the other hand, has the biggest election interference machine ever created via mainstream media, every social media platform in existence, &amp; print.  Where’s the beef?
Maddie loves Joe Biden and that’s no malarkey! #Dogs4Biden
And Joe Biden is as sharp as a tack mentally.
Gee I don't know what could go wrong.  NYC primaries California Voting Rolls USPS endorsing Biden  Seems pretty straight up to me.  😒
Anyone know what’s scarier than Covid-19?  Biden-20.
Here we are August 9, 2020 and still no V.P pick for Joe Biden. 🤔
Meathead Trump never colluded with Russia. Russia and China do not want him in office. They want Biden. Why do you think that?! Because they can manipulate Biden and not Trump!
I’m really looking forward to when Joe Biden signs executive orders banning the use of fossil fuels, guns, and requiring all the ice cream machines to work at McDonald’s, now that Republicans have decided that there’s no need for the most important branch of government.

Biden could really screw us now. Biden wins disaster for country. Trump wins his disaster continues. At least the Gov has common sense
Ok I’m fine with your decision. I’m voting against Biden in hopes he loses. Then the DNC may not nominate another corporate owned pimp. If they do again, I’ll vote against them again.   It’s policy not party.  If my wife blew my neighbor I wouldn’t have him ove for dinner.
Your on the Joe Biden ACA Medicare raping of America plan.  The progressive plan has no premiums no deductible no copay.
Biden has proven he is loyal to only those who pay him millions.  I don’t have millions. He don’t have my vote.
In response:  people like you are enablers.  You accept the trash presented to you and look for a positive in the rubble.   He isn’t trump is all you have.  I agree trump sucks.  Why can’t you admit Biden is a shitty corporate owned nomination. Your enabling harms every American
You're in Michigan. I'm in Macomb County. A few Trump signs. Saw one Biden sign.a lot of American flags. Silent majority.
I’m 6 miles from Canada now.  I’ll send you a pic of Americans begging to cross to buy prescriptions once I get out of work. ACA most expensive to consumer healthcare plan in the world.  Biden loves it. The corporate interests paid his campaign bills and ordered him to protect it
As long as Biden loses, nothing else matters.
Honestly,  I saw electing a “ Black “ president as a doorway to kick down ending a string of Old White Men.   Biden is the most galvinized corporate puppet ever. 73-09 he didn’t miss a Corporate ass he could kiss.  Worthless Joe is a waste of time.
Seems fair. If you vote for Biden, you should lie and say you voted Trump when Biden eats it
Biden is senile. If you vote for him you're voting for the CCP. End of story.
You must be a real open minded one with such a witty perspective. Great news for you then, just got put into law that all you need to do to vote for Biden it’s text Biden to 30330.
If I had to vote between a head of lettuce or Joe Biden, I'd vote for the head of lettuce, Biden is truly clueless and I would be terrified of who's actually pulling the strings for Biden because that's who you're getting with a vote for Biden...
I love  and
The Democrats think Kanye needs help, but they are silent about Joe Biden. 😂😂😂😂😂😂

Biden is not getting most of our votes. He needs to kiss gop ass like he did from 73-09 if he wants to win.
I’m fully convinced Joe Biden is DEFINITELY NOT in charge of this account
Biden has no toilet in the basement. He ran out of TP forcing him to go in the backyard! His handlers counted 14 brown or yellow spots in the grass. C’mon man you using coke too? I’m not CRAZY
Joe Biden -  "What you all know but most people dont know unlike the African/American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community"  Took 25 words for him to say   "You're all the same"
I'm not a huge fan of Biden, but he didn't get near as much negativity 4 years ago when he wasn't running for president. A lot of the shit spreading around him seems like an effort from others who benefit from him seeming like a bad person.
I will do whatever is necessary to vote Biden in And Trump OUT!
This article is garbage.

Its simple if Biden were to actually do the work to earn our voted show leftists that he supports and plans to push/ fight for progressive policies not pander and show that he does want to move left shit would be different he would get those voters.
87% of Democrats Support 'Medicare for All,' Though Joe Biden Doesn't
These people could easily not do the work for Biden make demands instead fight the DNC call them the fuck out and call Biden the fuck and not make themselves look clownish but nope.
Im sorry but I am kind of in shock seeing these people who are like the voices of the progressive movement just go along with Biden and the DNC.
Seeing all these progressives just going along with this Biden isn’t it but we just gotta do it in order to get Trump where the fuck is the fight in that where are the demands you all are just falling in line and giving Biden a pass you all aren’t even holding his feet to the 🔥
Saying that we must vote for Biden all while he continues to reject progressive policies and then say this shit this gives us a sense of false hope say you do fall in line and vote for Biden he is just magically going to move to the left after he has rejected the left.
Nah fuck that shit I reject Biden.
The article should be called a left wing group falls in line and does the work for Biden.  Like seriously how can anybody be progressive and go along with this shit.
Why I Joe Biden running? To avoid Hunter and himself from getting in trouble. China!!!
Wow more reasons why Biden isn’t it 👏 he does not deserve our vote 👏Cada dia veo las noticias de Biden y cada dia me cae tan mal.I noticed that... Kamala Harris was Biden's handlers' pick y'know...
Vote for Biden.
Love it, keep doing it, if Biden can do that it's fair game. That is hilarious.
I'm glad you are free to support Trump so much. I stand with for the children in cages, and I proudly stand with Biden/Harris.
Would have been epic if he said Biden.

Another question you can ask: Why is the sky blue? Why can't Biden complete a sentence?
Dumbass question. How come Biden &amp; Harris can't answer any questions? Let me guess, because they don't have any answers. Biden is too busy cashing checks from the Ukraine and China.
Biden &amp; Harris can't answer any questions! Ask some relevant questions, like "President Trump, how did you accomplish so much in 3 years? Biden has been a politician for 45 years and has no accomplishments."  . #NeverBiden
Because they can't answer any questions and they don't have any accomplishments to discuss. Biden will be in a nursing home by November.
Obama &amp; Biden were too busy corrupting America and filling the swamp.
Just saw my 1st Joe Biden ad on the local station here in deep red WY. It sounded great, but not sure how the mandatory mask bit will go over here, so many covidiots!!
Plug your nose and vote blue! I’ll personally assure you that Biden is a good man and Kamala is a great woman. Look at the fool that’s in there now? If you don’t vote you are giving Chump a vote!
I’m voting for Biden/Harris because they can actually do the job without the lies and blatant corruption.  They are true diplomats and can mend fences with our allies.  Also, I’m tired of the division that has happened to our country.
How embarrassing for up and coming young artists to be seen with doddering old fool, Biden. How does this help their cache with fans? 😂
Bernie's plan also didn't abolish private insurance. I can't believe you grouped her in with those Neolibs. I have noticed you and Abby are crickets on Bernie sheepdogging progressives into voting for someone as horrible as Biden and Kopmala! You both are better than this!

Would you rather have Joe Biden’s memory or Kamala Harris’ laugh?
Totally agree. But if I (generally conservative) were to tell a dem that I’m voting 3rd party, though, this is the typical response, “but that’s a vote for Trump!” which is just not true, because I’d never vote for Biden. And especially not Bernie lol. Maybe I’m an outlier, idk.

She's notorious for oppression of Black Americans as a DA. Called Joe Biden a racist. Damn bear EVERYTHING she says is race based... so who's the racist?
Great to be in-studio yesterday at  in Casper to talk about the important issues facing Wyoming, as well as why Kamala Harris's radical policies would hurt our state and the nation.
No the most extreme Ticket was unqualified Trump! And the  has done everything to cover for his 21,000+ lies, the disaster of 166,000+ DEAD American's! Biden/Harris has come forward with plans to fight the Virus, not worry about shower heads! You're a disgrace just like Trump
Wait, wait, I can do that too: I have Dem friends in the bluest of blue states and not one of them is voting for Biden.  See how easy it is!
Joe Biden Tries to Take Credit for Trump Brokered Peace Deal as Rashida Tlaib Yells At Clouds
Nope. I’d agree Trump would get credit if the economy were churning along when Biden takes office, but it currently is and almost certainly will be in free fall at that point.
Maybe the First Couple's mail-in ballots will be "lost" somewhere until they are discovered a week after the election of President Joe Biden.
I won’t credit Obama, but I certainly hope I get the chance to credit Biden.
It’s really more of a suggestion of what Biden thinks should be done.  He won’t actually be sworn in until January, so that’s when it would start. By then, we’ll likely have a vaccine.

Perhaps, but you have to admit Trump inherited an economy that was roaring along, while Obama inherited one that was in a death spiral. Ironically, if Biden wins, he’ll inherit an economy in worse shape than the one Obama did.

Don't believe a word Biden says. Pure bullcrap pulled out of thin air. Remember, Biden liked Robert KKK Bird. #NeverDemocrat
Biden. You made a bold face lie about wearing masks and saving lives. Nobody could say with any accuracy that wearing a mask will save 40,000 lives. Total bullcrap. Standing for the flag is Patriotic, not wearing a mask. When are you going to answer questions from media?
Kamala Harris is everyone’s worst nightmare. Thanks no balls Biden.
Also...Biden has 50 years of lies to answer for, so can't wait to see if he gets asked similar questions.  Oh, wait...he won't even take questions.
THIS is leadership. Not Joe Biden.
I wonder, too. You could say the DNC strategy was a success since it beat Bernie Sanders. Seems like a costly victory, though, if you permanently lose a good part of your base, which I think the party has. Then pick a limp candidate like Biden and search for political Viagra. Wow
Really? Joe Biden had 50 years in government, and didn’t “fix” this. Now, all of a sudden, it’s a priority and he can fix it.  Nope, not buying it!
Those are completely made of statistics. Multiple sources and polls say that only about 10% of Sanders supporters won't be voting for Biden and for Yang idk. But either way, you're lying out of your ass and making yourself look like a fool

No. There is no saving us now. Neither Biden nor Trump will do anything to curb the corporations that are ruining the planet. In fact, they will help. Bernie was the only hope for policies and actions that might save us and the planet.

Election gambling odds. You bet $100 to win $43 with Biden ($143 payout) or You bet $100 to win $125 with trump ($225 payout) . You could bet $100 on Kanye and if he wins you win $50,000 ($50,100 payout). Something to watch. Trump was +1150 at a point in 2016.

Biden and Kamala have locked up more black people than anyone in history..a speech doesnt undo that.. theyre both garbage!!! 💯
Trump breaks everything he touches. Hopefully a Biden administration will be able to restore the department’s image as mentioned in the article. Congress should also look at legislation to prevent the DHS from being used inappropriately in the future.
Absolutely none. She is more fake than Biden and the people need to see that.
OMG you still have millions out of work and hours are being cut a monthly 2000 STIMULUS per person is what biden said hes going to do if he is the president its about the people not Trump's agenda TRUMP DOES NOT CARE about the people only HIMSELF 😥

Aww was Harris mean to your buddy that was bought &amp; paid for by you? We are still trying to figure out how he paid off all his bills with cash. I hope the Biden/Harris admin look into that. I'll take an angry/mad Black women over a LYING POS like you!
Couldn't have said it better.....  Biden/Harris:  Make America Bad Again...Way t go Post
THIS WOULD BE AMAZING IF IT HAD A MONTHLY 2000 DOLLAR STIMULUS IN IT BECAUSE ITS NOT JUST HEALTHY PEOPLE GETTING TJIS AND DYING FROM IT ITS EVERYWHERE SO WEATHER IF UR HOMELESS OR WHO EVER YOU ARE A MONTHLY 2000 STIMULUS WOULD REALLY HELP.
You never Trumpers don’t want to watch Biden make a fool of himself.  I used to respect you.
There is only one reason we now have a Biden-Harris ticket....even the Democrats want Trump to WIN!  #MAGA  #Trump2020  #GodBlessTheUSA
No, of course Joe Biden doesn’t own
Trying to scare of of a Biden administration while using actual footage of Trumps America!! 😂👌
That’s my point. Biden should be asked those questions too. They all should.
Give up.  VP Biden and Sen Harris are going to show you the door.
Give up.  VP Biden and Sen Harris are going to wipe the floor with you.
Give up.  VP Biden and Sen Harris are going to kick your ass.
Wyoming Here   /  all the way in this family! On a side note my son turns 18 this year &amp; is also Biden/Harris all the way!
That's what I say to.
Glad you'll base your vote on policy. I'm appalled that Biden's VP pick was limited on criteria - race and gender. He shut out so many other accomplished candidates just because of their biological traits. I do believe that's the true definition of racist and sexist.
Trust me took time. Trial and oh several errors. but the wait was well worth it. Don't know if the age difference makes the differents... shhh don't tall anyone, I'm 52 he is 38. So there is that. 😊
Liberal leaning Mom asked what I thought about Biden's pick; my response  - I don't agree with picking candidates based on race or gender.
Have to say I found my guy on a video game I came to WY to meet him in person after phone dating for 6 months. I even came to WY in Jan. "Born in Chicago" so I know snow. 🤣 We have been together since 2008, have a 11 year old son together with my other 2 older kids. &amp; Very Happy
Yeah signs for 45 up all over the place. Here and in Montana. I don't understand any of them. I don't feel safe putting a Biden sign up because they are die hard here and they might burn down my house. Not kidding either. So me &amp; my family &amp; close friends just say hidden. 🤣
Yeah I don't think you can get much redder then Wyoming. That's the only thing that sucks about WY. I just don't understand how they can back someone that has done so much damage to farmers. I just don't get it here. But luckily I still have my family to talk to none are for 45!
C’mon man (Joe Biden voice)! You can’t just say crap like that and bounce!!
I hear what you’re saying and I thought surely they were going to replace Biden too! But I think they would have done it before he picked his VP. I think he’s it.
Love how you carry Biden’s water because you know he can’t. It’s touching.
Joe Biden looks amazing in his well fitted suits.
Biden is doomed
Weird Al Yankovick would be more help than Biden in making a tough decision.
We have several, because we are hunters here. Not just BS hunters, I mean we have gotten our hunting license, have our kill processed so we get the meat out of it. Lovely roasts, steaks, hamburger "Not hamburders 🤣" &amp; sausage made from it. Nothing goes to waste. The right way!
Good for Biden/Harris. It's way better then a racist traitor sitting in the WH! You know the guy that has allowed 160,000+ American's to die because he did nothing for 70 days when it started, "oh that's right he called it the Dem's HOAX" Remember 15 closer to 0.. He was LYING!
VP Biden, they’re removing mail counting machines. They’re completely dismantling the postal service. There needs to be a nationwide plan by the DNC. Ballot drop boxes everywhere? Something must be done. Mail in isn’t going to work. This is getting really scary.
They dont care about those ones i guess the ones biden supposedly touching
I started clapping to fill in the awkward, uncomfortable silence that followed after Biden introduced Harris, as she was approaching the podium.
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers   #KamalaHarris #BidenHarris2020Landslide 😁😁
I’m still in shock the lefties aren’t gonna replace Biden! Anybody thought about that? He’s really it! They’re really gonna go with him! 🤣
Yeah, &amp; got paid well for it too. Burisma, &amp; China are the most relevant foreign policy experiences of the Biden clan. If only the kickbacks can be applied to lessen the economic impact of the Democrat wish list. Living on the dole is no way to go through life.
Yes. The moron line was negative, but I'm sure people know what I mean. It's either Trump or Biden. Anything else is a waste of time and energy. From the top on down and back up, a Blue ticket will get us out of GOP hell.
Still seeing so much butt hurt. Warren was my choice too for president. But guess what? It didn't happen. I got onboard with Biden immediately. Because I'm not a moron. Negative energy will never create the change you want. Numbers matter. We have to get a super majority. Period.
Biden Welcomes Kamala, Who Absolutely Hammers Trump  Who writes this crap "Absolutely Hammers Trump" what an f-ing moron.
Biden &amp; Harris vs Trump &amp; Pence. I'll  sleep easy tonight. Trump 2020!
Most of them know her general nature is that of a slaver and a ruthless overlord . She already has plans to get rid of Biden and if they win he won't last 10 months if that.
Mayor Lightfoot: Biden Key to Getting Gun Control for Chicago... just what the law abiding citizens need. 🙄
Yep.  Put  into the browser and landed here.  Don’t miss the ActBlue statement at the bottom.  Guess Antifa is endorsing Biden.
“Fatilities” “Doxxers”...yet, he nicknamed Biden, Sleepy Joe! Donald himself, just today, cannot properly pronounce common everyday words like “Doctor” or “Fatalities” but has 2 grown sons trying their best to convince us Americans that it’s Joe who cannot read. It’s an SNL skit!
What a "tell" you're making here. Admitting Biden isn't capable of debating President Trump.  Oh and just fyi... Tulsi cleaned Kamala's clock on the debate stage. Pence will also defeat her in the VP debate.
Easiest job in the World? Crowd control at a Biden/Harris rally.
Keep up the good work...this media propaganda machine must be checked...everyone should take the hands of those that listen only to the msm and force feed them the ACTUAl truth.... as for biden....what a tool!
I got all teary eyed listening to Kamala y💯talk about Beau Biden. She’s the one, She’s gonna be damned good! Way to go Joe ❤️
Biden &amp; Harris will not win. Say goodbye to your communist ideology.
Biden had 50 years to make a difference and now he talks like he can change the world What a  Piece of shit dont buy it
Around 11% of Wyoming's electricity was generated by renewable energy in 2018, 4/5 from wind power. Wind is an abundant resource in WY as it gains strength blowing over the mountains &amp; across the prairies.  wants to increase clean energy jobs in US. WY needs Joe Biden!
…We treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor. We are the United States of America. And together, there is not a single thing we cannot do.”    🇺🇸  — Joe Biden
A great endorsement for Biden/Harris.
Wel, got 1 ✋. I work for a coal company and I may not like some of da things that Pres Trump does r says but he is da only one that is leving the door open for coal. We may hve to work hardr to keep it but its bettr than what I would have to look frward to w Biden. #votemywallet
Happy urban apartment dwelling single childless woman😁, er, spinster😐, currently living in rural fuck all; and I'm voting for Biden/Harris &amp; all D down ticket. Because I'm not into proto neo-fascist genocidal nihilistic grifting impeached habitual traitors.
If you're not voting for Biden/Harris...you are a tRump supporter! Not voting, voting 3 party, voting for 45...all means you are a tRump supporter! How is 45 working out for you? If good, then YOU are the problem!
Buddy I litteraly said fuck Biden look at my header
I'm embarrassed to see Biden signs in my neighborhood. How do people get that clueless?
And Biden is better I’m a single issue voter gun rights
Expect the 25th amendment to come into play if there is a Biden-Harris victory.
The problem with USA is we’re already too wall-street Goldman Sachs. Kamala harris nor joe LegHair Biden nor trump helps that at all.
Already calling it the HARRIS/biden ticket.....presumptuous
Joe Biden couldn't fill a phone booth!
Now they have given 45 the chance and he failed. They like Biden.
His whole job is to siphon young white male votes away from Biden. Everyone with a functioning frontal lobe would know that.
Oh, but just watch the instantaneous flip if Biden wins.
Who's he kidding! She wasn't anyone's choice, let alone Biden. Some staffer picked her name out of the hat of Black Women Demoncratic Radicals. #JoeAndTheHoe
Well I see Biden sniffed out a running mate. I will wait to see if he makes it to the election.

There’s one simulations where Biden wins by more than 400?? Lol holy shit that’s the dumbest model ever
With Biden being listed as a criminal suspect in Russia, it would be grounds enough for him to step down and allow Kamala to take over.
It don't matter what side you choose both suck but I still vote Biden instead of trump.
Well, Biden's VP nomination is the scariest one if you like your guns and your thoughts! She will take them both away, and take your money, and we are on our way to Venezuela! Watched her treat an innocent man absolutely despicable!! Scary times we are in!!

I can’t stop thinking that Tulsi would beat Trump in a landslide but here we are with Biden and Harris and another 4 years of Trump.
We’re not comfortable with a foreign nation interfering with our elections. Last time I checked Hunter wasn’t running for president. There’s no indication that China is acting at the same level as Russia in trying to get Biden elected. Only idiots think China created this virus.
Tucker Carlson calls Biden-Harris the 'first entirely hollow presidential ticket in American history'  #FoxNews
I'm comforted by the fact that all these The Bachelor fans🌹will have the stability of a Biden Harris administration in which to wring their hands and gnash their teeth.
Biden/Harris.....Knee pads &amp; pee pads..........#votered
So often we don't get what's obvious in politics. Candidates need to make big splashes to take the headlines. But Biden's choice of Harris tells me that his administration will elevate and prioritize calm, stability, and logic.  #BidenHarris2020
Why would Biden want a Republican as his VP?
Ronald Reagan warned us against Biden
The best you can hope for from Biden being elected is a bunch of interpretationalist federalist judges restricting your rights and solidifying the grip of their master's corporate masters on every facet of life.
The Senate and House tend to swing opposite of the POTUS. The Senate is red and that's not going to change. The house is blue but if Biden gets elected in two years it will be red. In both cases the only change that can occur is to the party platform, and there's no incentive.
Democrats genuinely believe that they need the white vote, to the point where they'll ignore this. Hence Biden. Hence Harris.  They don't understand that they've lost the white vote for decades.
Let's do this! #BidenHarris
“Biden’s Baby Shampoo: For a head you can’t stop smelling.”   (by Adam Ward)
Ayaan Hirsi Ali calls out Biden for quoting Muhammad pronouncing Sharia law in remarks to Muslim voters  #FoxNews
Getting Bernie so close in the primaries will push the party left, but Biden is as hardline corporate Dem as it gets and showing that platform to be viable will do the exact opposite.
Entirety of conservatism: "Look at Biden/Kamala being hypocrites!"  Biden/Kamala: Lol we're gonna fuck.
Trump Campaign: Biden sees race!  Minorities: Kill white people lol
Biden benefits from this angle.
Kamala Harris would be a reasonable vice presidential pick for a young, vigorous, healthy presidential candidate. But because of Biden’s age and apparent mental fragility, Kamala’s seeming lack of gravitas could make voters nervous. President Pence or President Harris?
Yeah, but they've done pissed off more of their base than Hillary's selection did and check out the wording of the quoted tweet. Not the only one implying Biden is stepping aside before being sworn in.
It would be crazy to hear a free press ask Joe Biden questions. I would love to hear him respond to questions about Hunter’s Kid with the lady of the pole? Proud grandpa or would he deny it. Dumb we don’t know! I don’t think he knows. Just think of the questions!!!
Seeing some people on here actually hint at retaliation for Biden's choice. You are not progressives. You are not woke. You are just as bad as what we're fighting against. Take your "conviction" and shove it. This election decides whether this country exists anymore. 🤦🏼‍♂️I'm not a socialist and neither is Biden. Biden holds more conservative values than Trump actually. As I feel being a conservative means you're a true man of God, spreading the love of Jesus Christ.
Let me get this straight...Biden has the support of the Post Office and Trump has the support of the Police...it’s Letters vs. Cops...Who will win? 🍿
lol yeah the #resist in your bio along with several blue wave emoji, a Joe Biden/Kamala header, &amp; profile full of Dem tweets didn’t give it away. You’re an absolute joke 😂 peace
Joe Biden is a Perv and always touching little girls watch the videos
“It’s not about your rights” —-Joe Biden, 8/13/2020  The new Harris/Biden ticket slogan    #SlowJoe #PhonyKamala
That’s funny that anyone thinks he is getting crushed by the racist Biden
Did you notice Twitter’s new “US government Account” designation and “policies?”  “In the case of state-affiliated media entities, Twitter will not recommend or amplify accounts or their Tweets with these labels to people.”   This does not apply to Biden or Pelosi or Harris...
The Anti-Biden people are much better off trying to push Conservatives to vote for Libertarians, but that makes too much sense and is maybe too much work for them.
The reason I say he has more conservative values is because a true conservative is a man of God and there's no question that Biden is more a man of God than Trump is
Biden is not far left and if your mind was not easily influenced by conspiracy theories you'd realize this in fact he has more conservative values than Trump has...
Also this has nothing to do with Trump I was just telling you what Biden said...what you don't believe there are crooked cops? Really?
No they're not...you do realize that Biden is for the exact opposite right?
lol he thinks Biden has dementia?
I'm not a Democrat but I will tell you that I see Biden with more conservative values than Trump has
Neither is Biden..but do you think people should be allowed to have military weapons?
Trump raises more money than Biden in Michigan, even amid the pandemic  via
I can’t believe I gotta vote for joe Biden
You were the best senator and grilled everyone came in front of you. And you are going to be the best VP after you and Biden win
Hey Joe Biden I see you have a nasty pet running with you. You can kiss my ass thinking you gonna mandate anything to me. I wear a mask when I'm out only. See I love the American people that's why I wear mine. Your a disgrace to us good americans. All Americans stock up on
Biden will probably have his hands all over Harris since he likes touching women and she is a nasty animal that needs here rabies vac.These 2 are the biggest joke I have ever seen. DON'T VOTE FOR BIDEN N HARRIS THEY WILL F#*K US AMERICANS OVER VERY BAD DON'T BE
You got to watch governor Whitmer she all mad cause she can't see glory and stars now that she was not picked by Biden,She is a sell out,she suppose to care for michiganders but she sure was kissing biden feet to be elected vp.another joke
Hey there's the 2 biggest liars and crooks around. Hope yall know all the blood spilled from americans and the children are on your heads Kamala and Biden and rest of the dems.Democrats are nasty,liars,crooks and MURDERERS. KAMALA AND BIDEN SUCK WITH THE OTHER DEMS
Man he really flew down those last 10 feet, fucking idiot. Biden could run circles around humpty dummy!
That seems right, Biden putting in the work while the lazy ass narcissist enjoys the ride
It will be funny when the Biden,Harris campaign talks about trump and his family donations to Kamala
That's fantastic! So he's for Biden now I guess.
I think Kamala’s  past might be a bit of a negative but she has done good things. I don’t think the vote for Biden needs to come down to his VP choice. His decency and complete sentences make him a better option than Trump
VP means almost nothing. I don’t think it’s anything to worry about. I think Biden only does 1 term and being VP makes Kamala the front runner in 2024, but statistically VPs don’t go on to win the following election. Last 2 times were Bush 1 in 1989 &amp; Van Buren in 1837.
Kamala is nothing but a lieing low life person,she talks nothing but bull crap.She will do nothing to help americans,all she and Biden are gonna raise your taxes,do away with fraking which will cause a lost of jobs,I guess if you vote for them can pay big money
Big Biden accounts could have RTed that poll but refused to that's on them like
Recently yeah, that's all I've been watching of either guy. I think Biden's strategy lately has been good in that there hasn't been a lot of material, but the problem is that the material that there is lately hasn't been good, the Vette commercial excepted which was quality
Let's worry about getting Biden and Kamala in the office before berating them on policies and past behavior. Sure, we can scrutinize. But I fear we run the risk of wavering minds voting 3rd party. Not a risk we should be willing to make.
Then a non vote for Trump is a vote for Biden. I’m not voting for Trump then lol
Bad, but shit Biden's looking worse lately. I watched a few videos of him now vs him during Obama, and it's brutal. I'm hoping for some type of clarity during the debates
Might not logically follow, but still true. Biden hasn't been looking good.
Kamala is a leftist along with others like Old ass Bernie.they are nothing but trouble DO NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN &amp;KAMALA THERE GONNA DESTROY AMERICA.ALL AMERICANS NEED TO OPEN THERE EYES AND SEE HOW BAD THEY ARE.ETS KEEP AMERICA GREAT WITH TRUMP.
Hell  yes Biden is a joke,and kamala is to.they are both racest. This election is the biggest circus event ever. Joe Biden is the stupid ring master.. Kamala Harris is no damn good for America..Dems are so far left it's pitiful.this election is a JOKE,JOKE
Trump lowkey not wrong about Biden I’d never vote for him even if I could vote 😭
Biden lost my vote with that pick. It’s sad because I had higher expectations for him.
Why do you think she deserves 95% of the African Vote?  Because she's an African American female or some other reason.   Name one good thing she's done as a Senator?   Just for kicks, name one think Biden has done in 47 years in Washington.
Biden and Harris could both shoot me on 5th Avenue, and I'd still vote for them. #truth

Biden loves little kids he's a damn creep and he's more racist then anyone I've ever seen also people make remarks of racial slurs all the time shit happens people make white racial jokes but yet don't see me complaining? Idgf what people say it's what they do..
If you did the research you'd know how corrupt the Trump admin is too  Yes. I'm willing to take Biden over Trump knowing full well both are still evil. Trump is more evil. As I said in 2016, we deserve better choices. Socialism&gt;fascism any day.

The Biden/Harris ticket can honestly stake claim they are responsible for imprisoning more poor people and ruining more lives than any ticket in history.
Hey all I see the stock market dropped after they an ounce the biden vp elect. Stock market is down to -104.53

Biden 2020-2024, Harris 2024-2032 then Abrams 2032-2040. Let the healing begin!
It will be the down fall of America if biden and kamala get elected. Democrats would screw up a wet dream.
Hey Nancy Pelosi since you ass hole democrats can't come to an agreement how bout you,shumar,biden,and other dems take the Americans that get evicted and have no money to feed there kids let these americans move in with you. I think that's a good idea since yall don't
hey Dan I was listening to news this afternoon and heard biden has to elect a black women lol.this president election has nothing to do with us americans. It only is about money and racism. This is all a joke. The hell with dems there liars and crooks
I could give two shits about who he picks. A woman of color who will do absolutely nothing for black Americans, just like Biden and Obama.
Why are all these MAGA people following me?!? I neither want nor do I need any of their attention or insights! They have literally nothing they can bring to the table for me. Now hear this....... I am voting for Joe Biden and his future running mate, end of story, full stop!
Here’s a Vegas question for everyone. What’s the over/under in minutes for how long it takes Trump to make a snide remark tweet regarding Biden’s VP choice? Or should we use seconds 😒#Trumpvptweet
Biden’s VP pick must be kept secret until last second to minimize campaign against her. HER being Hillary Rodman Clinton.

If he wants the black vote, he needs a vow of solidarity. Or else they will vote for Kanye (as Ye admitted that was the only reason he was running). Gretchen would be a FINE pick. But I think if Biden wants to WIN, now is not the time.
If Joe Biden believes blacks lack diversity and Joe Biden asks a black reporter if he is a junkie, does Joe Biden believe all blacks are junkies?

Seven years and hundreds of millions donated and the biggest gain in institutional racism you describe was criminal justice reform by a politician that never received a penny.  Despite that, BLM will assuredly endorse people like Joe Biden who helped jail more blacks.  Good luck.
Jason Nichols: Biden's take on AA voters and 'diversity' was not wrong   ⁦ wondering if your characterization would be the same if Trump said it? As we always say, if not for double standards the left would have none at all.
This! Also at least Biden is in the middle of what a Republican and a Democrat is which is IMO exactly what we need to help cool the waters that have been boiling at a high
I told Hillary in 16 that she needs Chinese bots to defeat Trump's Russian bots. She didn't listen therefore she didn't get elected. Biden's campaign did! You win by fighting fire with fire!!! He gets it!

Maybe Joe Biden should pick who he’d want to be his Vice President and tell everyone who disagrees to fuck off
The DNC did, Biden doesn’t shit unless scripted. What a joke.
If you truly were you'd realize that Trump uses us a photo op. Biden is a true Catholic. Why would you say he's not? Do you personally know him? That's what I thought
If Biden has 100 a day then Trump has a million. You really want to keep on going? Come on dude check yourself before you wreck yourself...literally
You say Biden has dementia but Trump has 2 gaffes in one day? Yeah I'd chill on that
The worst things Biden has said compares nothing to the things Trump has said that is for certain and at least Biden has the decency to apologize if he feels he has said wrong while Trump feels he can't do or say wrong which is exactly why we're in the dire situation we are in
I can’t argue that he has dealt with an incredible amount of grief. That story I shared is completely legit though, along with many other instances of his dishonesty. All I said was Joe Biden will not be a good President. I didn’t say he should or shouldn’t beat Trump.
And I don't see Biden as garbage or even with dementia I just believe what he has is a speech impediment and that's alright. I'm sorry you feel that way about him but that's alright it's your opinion as an American and that's what being American is supposed to be about.
Dems didn't expect Trump to mess up this much and are now having Biden talk, along with suing the NRA, in order to lose harder.
I respect your opinion I only see one evil this election in fact I see Biden as someone that shares more true conservative values than Trump does
I just can't imagine Joe Biden tweeting this or completing any other thought.
Join me in supporting Biden Victory Fund via
I think you meant Biden
I wasn't referring to Biden of course I was referring to the Gov I'd rather her stay also I think Kamala is the perfect choice
Biden had a little bit of a gaffe today but thanks to Trump that got overshadowed big time. For Biden just has a speech impediment, Trump is just plain dumb and ignorant.
See I don’t think Joe Biden is a decent human being, but that’s just my opinion. I don’t think he’s a good politician, I don’t think he’s of sound mind and I certainly do not believe he will be a good President. I’m taking Trump out of the equation and just evaluating Biden.
Trump has had 2 gaffes in one day yet he says Biden is mentally ill? Lol
Biden wouldn't block Trump's prosecution if the Justice Department pursued it   Prosecuted for beating Hillary?
I'm happy Biden has at least narrowed it to two legit VP candidates. Harris or Rice are great choices although of course I'd prefer Kamala since she's more moderate but I do love both. Both are great.
She would throw away her vote if Biden picks Susan Rice.  Easy enough to understand.
Our  is amazing &amp;  would be a strong VP partner for  But I believe our future currently depends on actively championing #RacialEquity in the White House with one of our strong and well-qualified #shortlisted #womenofcolor in 2020.
Biden is picking either Harris or Rice huh? Good. I still take Kamala but both are definitely qualified.
This year yes we have to. Besides Biden's worst compared nothing to Trump's worstStay home if you can not vote for Biden. But wondering how you could have been crazy about the duck?
You tagged me!
Thanks Rose, you’re nice!
Great choice of words. Save it for the election, when Trump gets his ass BEAT by Biden and Harris. Enjoy your weekend.😄

Your only speaking to the rich! Obama/Biden reversed the worst Recession, since the Great Depression, and created more jobs than Trump. Then Trump ruined it all, overnight!
Yet, more people are unemployed than when Obama/Biden took office in 2009! In fact, unemployment has only been higher once, in the last 100 years, during the Great Depression!
And Trump has been in Washington less than 4! Who knows politics more than the other? Who's done more for Americans... Biden, that's who!
Really? 5 out of 6 swing states have Biden leading Trump!
She's far from "radical"! 23% of Republican voters like her more than you! 16% of Republican voters like Biden more than you!
And yet Biden &amp; Harris and all the rest of their circus monkeys had zero masks on. Interesting
YEAH!  GO  Biden-Harris GO 🙌👏👏
This tard would have wrote this about ANY person Biden picked.
Careful what you wish for. If Biden makes it, we're in for a world of socialist hurt 😩
Could Biden in a debate compare the number of times the duck has golfed with the number of times President Obama golfed And have the duck explain the difference.
Quit lying,  your approval rate is not that high. Nor has it ever been. This girl from swing state Michigan is along with thousands of other women from Michigan are voting for Biden. Suck it up Trump start packing!
The only difference you will see in our politics when Biden is elected is that you will have both DEMS &amp; GOP criticizing everything where as not 1 GOP dares to criticize the duck.
Jill Biden will be a very active 1st lady in comparison to the one that has to walk 2 steps behind.
That's wishful thinking from the magas. Has a contract been put out by the duck on Biden &amp; all are tripping all over themselves to fill it.
We can't stand to have anything good, we always have to tear it apart. After this election our country will never be the same again. The duck will have taken us to hell &amp; Biden will have to bring us back.
They're having everything their way with Trump, why do they want Biden to win?
I agree with that, I think Biden is only in this for one term. He didn't want to run for President, her was pulled Out to run.
Kanye thinks he is a serious contender to harm Joe Biden? Inflated at best, delusional at worst.
Here is my proposed track on confronting Harris is hypocrisy in joining Biden. “ you’ve clearly forgiven the VP for his racism and misogyny by joining his ticket, how will you extend that forgiveness to Republicans moving forward?”
Two of my friends already pissed at me for saying Biden picking Copmala makes me lean back toward staying home this election.   If Democrats put HALF the energy into insisting on good candidates that they do into voter shaming, we'd never be in this mess in the first place.
If we not supposed to vote for Biden/Kamala then who tf else is a viable option 😒

Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals  #FoxNews
Biden has NO Chance of winning Michigan. I live in a "once solid" Democrat County.  Biden won primary because he is the only candidate they promoted here. Sorry to say, but this is TRUMP Country now
She got the Nod because of color and gender. Kinda has a familiar tone in the "Now Rasist" Democratic Party. Everyone knows that a Sanders/Biden Ticket was the only chance of beating Trump but the Dem's are run by corruption and Hypocrisy. Looks like 4 more  for Trump!
Report what you want. Threatening others isn't my style. I simply meant he will disappear from the presidency, because Biden is going to take it from him. Spin it however you like. Trump is a narsisistic control freak who throws a tantrum whenever someone calls him out on his BS.
Maybe 12, Biden I believe won't run for second term.
I’m LOVING what I see. I hope American people realize we’ll NEVER see these numbers or better, EVER AGAIN, if Joe Biden gets into office! Our 401k’s and investments will DROP like a ROCK the day after, if you don’t win. GOD SAVE US ALL!!
Exactly Biden, so we can keep America!
Nope.. threatening another is not my style. However that kind of behavior is right up Trump's alley, so I see how you may have gotten confused. Let me put it in simpler terms. Trump's about to have a change of address. Biden 2020 😄
Kamala Harris spent the entire primary calling Joe Biden a racist. Defend that
Must be a Trumper finding out Harris was chosen as Biden running mate, now knows his racist days are over.
Lol, Biden &amp; Harris...get your bail money ready.
I just saw Biden ad, Bernie is calling to them if they’re listening
Biden definitely fumbled the bag
It can be a can of Tomatoes and I still will walk over hot coals to vote for Biden. Plus its not true. You can easly look up googled.
Exactly. The tail wagging the dog. Anyone who thinks Biden won't capitulate to the radical left is kidding themselves. Usually candidates moderate for the general election, but not Biden when he signs on to Sanders' policy wishlist
there's a good chance the DNC will continue to hide biden, letting harris take over more of the campaigning, only to lose to trump then blame the sanders camp.  I hope i'm wrong
Lol look out Gary, you're racist too in Kamala's book. Just like she accused Biden during the primaries
He played himself. People already didn’t like Kamala at the beginning of the race and this isn’t gonna make anyone change their mind and want to vote for Biden. It sucks because we need all the help we can get in order to get Trump out and this is only gonna make it harder.
If I do stream tonight it's only going to be if I am drunk and it's only going to be to make fun of Biden and Harris.

Kamala "Joe Biden is a racist" Harris. The ads will be priceless lol
Biden announces that 2020 will proceed on brand.
Imagine thinking the Biden and Harris ticket doesn't represent everything wrong with the Democrat party. They literally helped build and enforce the current enforcement environment.  You can't vote out of this mess: they were chosen FOR YOU.
Well, Biden is despised by the left and right, so he picked some despised by the right and left to balance the ticket. Opposites and all that.

Biden will change the whole atmosphere of the country. The bitterness and hatefulness may be lowered to just the few magas.
The question is less about personal beliefs, than the policy they'll implement. Trump has been far more friendly to religious liberty than what Biden has pledged to do, with the backing of Sanders

Biden hasn’t announced who he picked for VP because he forgot who he picked.
It is idiotic some of the things people put out there like magically if biden is elected the virus will just go away. This is the worst health crisis our country has faced &amp; that is an insult to all the people that have died due to the ducks inaction.
They aren't switching gears. They have had the duck &amp; his kiddies photo shopping pictures to make biden look senile. All the while the duck does that everytime he gets a mic in his hand.
You are twisted off you think anything of that will happen once Biden is elected. You'll be fine

Biden didn't pass the USMCA which significantly increases the requirements for domestic auto content
Yes I think he would. I don't think he actually cares about winning. Biden has been shifting on black voters this entire spring/summer. He actually has spoken out against almost every policy initiative black voters and protestors have brought up.
Obama/Biden built it Trump/Pence broke it Biden/Harris (or Rice or whoever Joe needs) Will FIX IT!

I know Biden isn’t perfect. He wasn’t even on my radar as a presidential choice. But any notion of a moral equivalence between him and Trump is hilarious.
I doubt if the duck even knew Biden was catholic.

I mean if these kids can learn how ...  Biden can.
This is how I will look voting Biden/Harris in November.
That is true unless you have a 401k, then Biden is your enemy!
They did endorse BS before Biden, Hillary in 2016, and Obama in 2012 so IDK how likely a Trump endorsement would be even before this chicanery.
But biden is better in almost all of those states?
I'm so grateful for  Thanks for tackling the real issues with decisiveness, perseverance, and focus.  Side note: I was real worried #Biden was going to take #BigGretch from us. She's saved countless lives, and selfishly, I'd like her to continue protecting us.
We don't have an intelligent option between Trump and Biden. Next.
I'd be more inclined to buy this analogy if wearing a mask also meant incubating COVID 2 which would appear 4 years down the line.  Biden is like sending kids back to school with masks.
I don't care what Party you are in at this point.  If you don't Back Biden/Harris and you are female...you're not For Women.  Prove me wrong.
Biden has done it before. Yes with mistakes, but he is not God. I am losing a lot these last 3 years, I am 74, I want hope for my wife and family before I go home.
I also believe the best candidate should be elected: the one who actually wants to fix the problems. Kamala and biden will not fix anything.  There's only one good choice,  and
Finally, we get another poll confirming that Kam ala and Biden are positive in approval. Trump and Pence are underwater.

I’m political - not hiding it. Just dropping facts on your argument. They weren’t able to get that amendment repealed before 2010. So, is it Obama &amp; Biden’s fault or the feckless GOP for putting it in first? An arsonist complaining about how long it takes to put the fire out.
False.   6 months ago the ecomony was as good as its EVER been with record low unemployment.   The Dems found a way to use a fear mongering and mass shutdowns to destroy economy and blame Trump.   Want to see the economy die?  Elect Biden

Pence: Kamala Harris as Biden's VP confirms Democratic Party controlled by radicals
I see what you folks are doing (Don Jr. made a similar claim earlier). You are so scared of Biden that you are trying to make the election a contest between Harris vs. Trump instead of Biden vs. Trump. How desperate and sad. Luckily Harris is a better candidate than Trump.
Both Biden and Harris have long careers characterized by bowing to prevailing political pressure.  This has meant some bad policies in the past, and some good.  What it means now is that if progressives exert enough pressure over the next 4 years, we can get progressive policy.
In ‘must-win’ Michigan, Trump campaign takes fight door to door as polls show Biden with strong lead
The Dem party establishment has no respect for the working class people of this country.  One can vote for a Biden-Harris ticket out of necessity, but to claim it to be anything more than a least-worst is a slap in the face to the ethics of human decency.
There are a lot of oddities. Like WAY more scenarios than I a comfortable with have Biden winning MS or LA but losing AZ, NC, FL, MN. It's totally odd stuff ATM and I am not sure if these are outliers or really 7-10%.
So, she's announcing that she will be putting out a contract on Joe Biden? That he will be somehow rubbed out before the election? That's what it sounded like she said. (By the way, did this clip cut out just BEFORE she took a giant swig from her wine bottle she keeps at hand?)

Upton’s gonna endorse Biden and when he does it’s important to me that people remember I called it.
A Biden/Harris ticket is not awesome if you want true progress as a Democrat. Neither of them have shown commitment towards the popular progressive policies the people actually want. They’re better than Trump... but many people “don’t like it but will support it anyway”.
Joe Biden is receiving briefings now. Thank goodness there’s an adult hearing the important things. 😳
Anyway I’m never forgiving Gen X for intending to vote for Warren then when she dropped out voting for Biden. I literally... why.

I'll still hold my nose and vote for Biden. I may have voted for Amash instead had he not dropped. At least he was anti war, wanted to cut military budget, and wanted to demilitarize the police.

Kamala Harris was by far the hardest on Biden during the debates. Those clips will be SOMETHING to see.
Biden not stealing my governor to be vice president is the sort of basic political good sense that is always nice to see. Democratic governors of Michigan are just way more valuable than Democratic senators from California.

Why Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer wasn’t chosen to be Biden’s running mate in 2020 presidential election

Chrissy, will you feel the same way if Donald Trump wins, not Joe Biden?  I agree but don't see the losers wanting to celebrate.
Watch this. Watch it again. Share it with people. Biden Harris cannot win this election.
Honestly, I believe the vitriol we saw rise up as response to Obama’s 8 years will rise even higher this November b/c of Harris. Those same people, will not only see shades of Hillary, but shades of Obama, in Biden-Harris. This is the lit match this entire powderkeg had coming.

That said, Trump invites petty criticism because he's petty and he refuses to admits his mistakes. If we want to compare actually like gaffes, find any time Trump voiced a racially sensitive or incorrect statement and play his clarification/apology back to back with Biden's.
Listening to Biden talk is like listening to coach Steve from big mouth and trump is like Lola

Have you EVER met anyone perfect? Would you prefer someone who will allow any and all Muslims into America to literally destroy us from inside out? If so vote Biden. At least he’s trying and I believe God will and is using him in ways unseen.
How is the Tara Reade case going? The reason they let Biden talk is so he will say something so stupid to distract from Tara Reade.
WE ARE GOOD!! WTF? HEY MAN! YOU LOVE  ❤️ BIDEN, RIGHT?? ‘CAUSE YOU GOTTA LOVE HIM IF YOU’RE BLACK RIGHT??!!
My husband is now just starting to get it.  He won’t vote for Trump now, but we still disagree all the time because he won’t vote for Biden.  If he votes for Kanye. I’m done.

Biden said during the interview, a full version of which will air Thursday. "Come on, man. That's like saying you, before you got on this program, you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not. What do you think? Huh? Are you a junkie?"
Joe Biden has been criticised after saying,'If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black'. The former vice-president made the comment in an interview with Charlamagne tha God, a co-host of the radio show 'The Breakfast Club'.
Biden raised eyebrows when he said in an interview, "Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”

Biden campaign claims lagging auto jobs puts Trump at disadvantage in Michigan
Seems pretty reasonable to me that: A. Biden will not be able to be the nominee B. The DNC has an agenda and will be proactive in protecting their interests.
I will say, I will never vote "against" anyone, I will only vote "for" someone. I believe people should educate themselves on all candidates and vote for who would be best leading our country (neither Truml or Biden) rather than vote for the party they've always voted for.
Biden just making it harder and harder to vote for him.
This isn’t Biden. Not that some reapportionment isn’t needed. It’s happening under 45’s presidency. Policing needs reform. Crime needs addressing but traditional police methods are failing. Divisions need to be overcome, not made worse. Trump makes it worse.
Joe Biden attempt to repeat the Southern Strategic Formula at every opportunity those ways are set in stone...he's probably hoping the Hispanic voting block become the new voting block to carry the Democrats party so the can continue fakeology of the past...same old Dems.
Its not a small thing tho, its a major precedent. No app has ever been banned, ever. This opens the floodgates. What if Biden decides to ban parler? Or fox news?
I've seen a document which accuses one presidential candidate of statutory rape.  And it wasn't Biden.
There is some serious revisionist seeds being planted in the buildup to Biden's (likely) election. They intend on trying to enact Bush-Era war criminal politics. This is just another tiny piece of a much bigger, despicable plan.
She should go take one and make a video of her doing it, and she should just keep saying the whole time "I don't know why trump and biden were scared to join me"
I love it when you start to believe your own bullshit.  Although it does get annoying posting the same things over and over to you people again and again only to have to block and continue to live in your own little world.  Biden 2020!
They're going full neocon Bush 3.0 with Biden's admin. This is especially disconcerting because her specific appointment clearly indicates the direction of MSM. We're going to have to fight like hell because it's really looking like we're headed towards a 202x military conflict.
There's Biden supporters??
Yes, noted devout Roman Catholic Joe Biden is the anti-Bible candidate who wishes to hurt God, not the dude who didn't know it's 2nd Corinthians, and had protestors violently removed from a church for a photo op.  But tell me more about how Biden is Sephiroth, please.
So long as I wasn’t forced to vote for Biden if I’m not voting for trump.

Biden is a place holder. Dems can and will draft someone from the Convention floor. They let Biden keep talking like this so Dems will be willing to accept whoever they choose. And no time to properly vet this new person.

Why do you think tha Susan Roce was not selected as VP to Biden? Is she in line for a cabinet position?
As a resident of Michigan my entire life, I’m very disappointed that our Governor Whitmer was not selected as Biden’s running mate because of her RACE. Maybe she can lift the lockdown 🔒 on our beautiful state now that she has failed to convince the campaign she’s liberal enough
BIDEN WEAK , HARRIS FAKE
Whitmer sent word to Biden's team that while she was flattered, she no longer wanted to be considered for the running mate slot, according to a high-ranking Democrat familiar with the process. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman.
The Michigan governor had caught the interest of Joe Biden and his vice presidential vetting committee, who were drawn to her prominence in a crucial battleground state and her aggressive response to the coronavirus outbreak there.
What 25% black from the largest slave owning family in the Caribbean? Her mom Indian dada half black. 1 of 400 pages of blacks slaves and 396 Irish indentured servants harris family owned. And biden mentor was grand wizard of KKK. How could you get more racist ticket ?
This list is long if harris and biden damage to black community.  She only 25% black so stop dragging out that card. She the great child of largest slave owner in Caribbean .her dad's half black mom Indian . Biden best friend was clan wizard . can you get a more racist ticket?
Biden/harris never be elected. You couldnt get a more racist ticket if the KKK themselves put them up.
Yeah I dont see trump giving whitmer a job. Biden has 0 chance of being elected.  A known bigot and the great grand child of largest slave owner in Caribbean .i dont think so. And before you say snopes says may not be true I show you 1 of 400 pages I can show you
Why would Kamala call Biden a racist and infer he’s a predator and then ACCEPT his nomination 😂. How twisted and messed up is that... and when she locked up a Tom of blacks for weed then LAUGHS about smoking herself
But she’s a two faced liar and Biden probably didn’t even realize what was happening when he picked her (who called him a racist and also said she believes Biden’s accusers... weird)
The closest marker we have to compare a potential Biden market with, would be the Obama market.  They printed, propped, practically invented modern QE, etc. I bought everything cyclically under him, as we do now, helluva SPX chart, too. So, my answer would be trade as you do now.
#KamalaHarrisForVP  Biden: let’s give the people what we want! Press sec: it’s “what they want” Joe... Briden: right, what I said.
Well he did pick Biden as his VP.... so yeah haha
I'm showing up to the fucking poll to vote my ghoul of a fucking state rep out, so I might as well take the effort it takes to draw a circle in the Biden spot. But I'm not going to be fucking happy about it.
It was never about qualifications. It was always about appeasing Biden's faltering base. Too many fleeing his failing campaign.
Great choice Mr. Biden.  Can't wait to vote for this team!!
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.
Oh my god this really is just going to be 2016 all over again. Defund the police cry out Americans all over the nation fed up with the status quo. Nominate a cop for VP and extra-fund the police says Biden.
Susan Rice as vice president under a doddering President Biden could be a recipe for national-security chaos and disaster.
The early speaking slot suggests Whitmer is not the vice presidential pick after all but Biden still hasn't made his running mate selection public.
You must be mistaken!  This isn’t from Biden!
AP sources: Whitmer met with Biden as he nears VP decision
I have a strong belief that Biden is going to lose.
Great. Hope they get Biden
A trip to Delaware has people talking up Gov. Whitmer's chances. Here are the pros and cons of adding her to the Democratic ticket in the fall.
One way or another, we’re likely to know Biden’s choice before the Democratic National Convention begins next Monday.
I will vote for Mr. Biden regardless of who his VP pick is.  I think he needs a strong pick only because of his advanced age. ❤️

me too. Let’s not vote for this joke... what ever happened to hunter Biden? He got real quiet real fast

Biden please educate us on  being racist again...2/3 a coup, Obama/Biden had a pattern of 8 yrs of spying so why is anyone surprised that they spied on Oppo party and a Presidency  They spied e.g. Merkel, AP, Rosen/Family, Congressional committees; All Americans=Clapper lied under oath; Brennan lied, Comey leak/spied
No need to worry about it now! Democrats can now TEXT TO VOTE according to the new law Trump just passed! Since he didn’t want to fund the postal service they’re allowing it for Democrats.   TEXT the word: BIDEN TO: 30330   No registration/ID/signature/mask!   We did it!
But basement Biden is ahead by 7% in national polls with a margin of error of -24%
Joe Biden is calling for a 3 month mask mandate, but he hasn’t addressed the riots or the looting! GTFO
Joe "I don't do white running mates" Biden is definitely turning out to be the real deal.
I look at Biden/Harris and they terrify me. He’s been a liar for his entire career. So phony he was forced out of the race for plagerizing last time he ran for pres. She says out loud that she believes Tara Reid yet still supports Biden. Can’t trust either to go against grain.
Ffs. Did someone on the Biden campaign discover Twitter or something?

We are so fortunate to have you as Joe Biden’s running mate. Major hurdles, of course,   Massive sexism (at 72 yrs I so understand), birthism (no surprise), that craziness about no red meat (anything to be just plain crazy). We just fight the good fight!!!!
This should put to rest any notion that Biden doesn’t intend to act like he’s the president when he’s the president.
I understand you live in fear and sound foolish.   Facts are facts. Trump wins we start nominating a progressive 2 years before 2024 election.  If Corporate puppet Biden wins we waste a decade on this pos corporate owned pimp.   Why waste any more than 2 years on this?
It really does.  If Trump wins 2 years from now we start nominating a progressive. If Biden wins a decade is wasted on shitty Centrist Corporate owned puppets.
Pick Trump. In 2 years we can nominate a Progressive. If Biden wins a decade is wasted on Corporate Puppets.
The only reason they chose her is so they can call Trump a woman hating racist. She doesn’t even need a brain. Now Biden looks less racist and they have 2 virtue signal boxes checked to respond to Trump with.
So what the hell is your point?  Because he repeated a grade that makes him ineligible to be POTUS?  Really Soledad I expected better from you than this bs!  Move on, #Biden-Harris to save USA!
I'm afraid that come november, even if Biden gets elected, people are going to assume they can sit back and stop protesting for important causes because the president will "fix everything" which is NOT the case. Regardless of who wins, don't stop fighting. They won't change
Biden is a warmonger who along with Obama/Hillary invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and fueled Syrian/Yemeni war and sent American soldiers to fight useless wars. How is any of that showing empathy and leadership?
Vote for Biden anyway.  Count on Biden to put together a team of advisors that he will actually listen to.  He’s not going in thinking he has to know everything.  He just has to know how to lead.  Besides we have a better shot at surviving the next 4 years with Biden for Prez.
A vote for Biden is a vote supporting his warmongering with Obama, their invasion of Libya, their drone bombing in seven countries and the death of 100,000 brown people. F off with your democracy. A vote for Biden is a vote for war and murder.
It’s cool. Biden/Obama led Libyan invasion, drone bombed seven countries, fueled arms to Syria/Yemen conflict and led to 100,000 dead brown people. So if you vote for Biden, I consider you having voted to bomb brown people.
And people say Biden can’t say anything intelligent 😀

"Hell no, I'm not resigning ... I thought (the post) was humorous. I had no idea people would react the way they did. I think people have gone overboard on this … It's an election year."
Dr Biden: I believe this country is stronger when the least of us is supported and lifted up. A rising tide lifts all ships.   Melanie: A rising tide lifts the ships and make us the stronger country of the least people. Close enough.
Because that shit was laughable. ZOOM OUT. It’s so simple. He knew Biden had been super dirty in Ukraine. He asked to look into it. Dems spun it in an insanely dishonest way. It didn’t work. Guess what? HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT BIDEN. The rest was a legal assassination attempt. MISSED
That would be Biden! Isn’t he so nice about the Black people! I can’t believe they would vote for him or Harris! Don’t trust either one of them! No he’s not joking on what he saids! I wouldn’t vote for evil racist never!
Umm no. Not what happened. He said, they found no evidence of Russian collusion. What you just said was a false translation from the fake news. As far as Ukraine, Biden is up on  federal charges over there for crimes. All trump did was point it out. Dems are really that ballsy

How about Harris before being a vp candidate called Biden a racist and she also said she believed all his accusers in regards to sexual assault.
I love your posts and not looking to argue..... Joe Biden isn’t intelligent enough to have written the Patriot Act.  Corporate interests wrote it and had Biden claim he wrote it. Then lobbyists threatened to primary anyone who dared to vote against it.
I just saw the gal bullying the 12 y/o and I’m leaving it on Coward’s Ratio look up my likes if you want to find it. Like listen man, I get you’re that mad about Biden and Kamala....I don’t know how to finish that sentence.
Do you want to lose your social security? Trump wants to end it. Biden voted to cut it 4 times.
Ever wonder why American Presidents are prohibited from taking monies or lavish gifts from foreign countries?  Because it compromises them.  Biden has been compromised by American corporate interests as well as Ukraine who gifted his moron son millions of dollars.
Of course. Plus she deserves it. My guess though is Biden will lose more white votes than the black votes he gains. I hope I am wrong.
He talks out of both sides of his mouth. One time he says one thing. Then five minutes later he's saying something different. And he can't stand it when Biden is right and he's not.  Trump has to be center of attention for everything. He can't stand it when Biden or Harris talk.
I think it's the opposite. The people who aren't partisan are going to see that even Biden partisans believe Trump's talking point that Biden isn't up for it.
There is nothing that undermines Biden more than this obsession that he won't be president for 4 years and probably run for reelection.
Change is happening  We will get better president for 2020 . Joe Biden for the win 💁🏼‍♀️🙏🏻

I never said it did.  To me voting Green is a way not to vote for Biden or Trump.  I am voting Trump. A vote he should never have got and a vote Joe is expecting based on my voter registration.
I respect your point of view. The corporate interests used millions to insert their corporate puppet and set back the progressives movement.  I would hate it if I voted green and Biden won.  A vote for trump is most revolting thing I can do to the cheating DNC.
Yep a very cynical ploy by Trump. Vote for Joe Biden!
Can someone tell me one good thing about Biden?
I am voting trump because I hate Corporate owned puppets. Those folks are Republicans who like to feel good about themselves pretending to care about the less fortunate.   If trump wins in two short years we start nomination process. If Biden wins a decade is wasted.
I think Biden is better than Trump that’s it. I don’t like Biden he’s just the better of the two shitty candidates.
Thank you for agreeing with me. You’re right, you weren’t talking about Biden’s covid response, but you quoted my tweet about Biden’s covid response with a completely new topic and acted like my tweet you quoted was in opposition of your comment. Be honest in your discourse plz
I appreciate your point of view.    I am voting trump.   Why?  If Biden wins we don’t have a primary in 2024.  To hell with that. Four more years of trump is a million times better than a waste of ten years with Biden.
Biden / Harris ... lock em up
Biden/Harris..... Making America California. I’ll pass 👎🏽
Per Biden's rule, perhaps you're not really Latino. 😉
That’s understandable because BIDEN did not pick her. The leftists who pull his strings picked her.
Biden voted against the working class from 73-2009. He voted for cutting social security 4 times. He was for such liberal favorites as Citizens United. He is for no Wall Street or Banking super vision.   Which of those is driving you to vote Joe?  What votes Joe made do you like
Hey Kamala Harris, Care to explain why prison stocks rose, as soon as u were announced as Biden’s running mate? Or are u just gonna continue doing what your doing at the expense of others. I hate choosing the lesser of two evils
I always wonder how tf Trump shoves Big Macs down his gullet every day and has even lived this long. What kind of sick joke is the universe playing? And Biden looks like he could croak literally any second. It’s the same feeling of waiting for the screensaver to hit the corner.
He can reach into my pants. What does that even mean?  For 47 years he voted with GOP. Now a ten minute talk to Bernie and all is well?    Hell no buddy.  Never Biden.
I’m obviously bored here and am immaturely splitting hairs here but Biden served from 73-09 as a “ Republican “ err democrat Senator. 47 years in DC.  Shitty 47 years.  As you can tell I’m bored.  Take care

In short, fascism won’t be changed in one election, but we can chip away at it by voting in the direction that we want. Like it or not(and I fucking hate it) Biden is our most progressive VIABLE candidate. And that sucks ass but it’s reality.
And look at the fact that RBG’s term is ending. You DO NOT want trump to be in command when it’s time for her to be replaced... anyway, my point is no voting for Biden won’t immediately change anything but it will make it easier to get the change we want to see in the future
She signed to agree with Trump on more than a few unsavory issues, and with the “Defund the police” sentiment being so strong atm it’s just another example of Biden being shortsighted in the face of his goals. “I Need to get my black vote back up, get a black lady right?” Wrong1
One single person to take command of everything. Look at Trumps cabinet and how damaging they have been to the country. Let’s be honest here, Biden probably isn’t going to even live through his full term. But the cabinet he puts in will have be way better than the current one
Not to me.  Biden is a Corporate owned puppet.  No Medicare for all no vote for Joe.
Look at the big picture.  Bernie had largest crowds at every rally. Huge stadiums at times.  Biden had a rally today. 63 folks showed up. Corporate interests are saving millions for themselves nominating Biden. I would rather lose to trump than be cheated by the DNC again.
Future that I would want to see, NOT because Biden represent the future I want to see, but because if he gets elected Trump will be out office. My main focus is just getting trump out of there ASAP because he can’t handle this pandemic. Biden sucks but he at least will be able to
With that out of the way let’s address the second thing you said. I’m not claiming voting for Biden will end the oligarchy. Not even close. Voting for one candidate can’t accomplish that, but that’s not the goal of voting for him... voting for him is just one step toward the
Is biden harris having one at 5 20
Since you decided to share a definition with me earlier I think it’s only fair I get to do the same. You still keep straw Manning my arguments. Trump is demonstrably worse than Biden. I don’t like Biden. I think we can agree that we need to abolish the two party stystem right?
Ma’am I’ve got many history books. Ever notice in school they never mentioned Nixon?  The history books our kids get in school is the history corporate America wants our kids to believe.   100 of the richest Americans forced Biden on us. We will do all we can to beat him
The Biden campaign is looking more and more like "Weekend at Bernies."
2/3 let Voters exactly what Harris/Biden promised Dem Voters-    Get  info on Harris re not prosecuting Catholic Church abusers &amp; his documents- how she went after Sickle Cell Student then talk to
attack Harris’/ Biden’s Primary positions! Why, bec Harris will certainly take over from Biden- then will push her own agenda - if Biden wins and can remain Pres for 1st term - I believe he will resign near the end so Kamala will be Pres leading into the  election 1/3
I’d  care if Corporate interests didn’t nominate Biden.  DNC cheats us. Then cry’s when GOP cheats them.
Okay that’s not a good thing, but that’s child’s play compared to systematically destroying the USPS in the middle of a global pandemic. Not even in the same realm. Like I said, Biden isn’t good, but Trump is off the charts fascist. It’s not even a comparison.
okay then i don’t wanna hear shit about progressives or “bernie bros” losing biden the election in november. y’all don’t want or need our votes but then blame us for everything when shit goes south. and for the record I still am voting for biden.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Yes and I’m choosing to vote for the guy who’s not actively engaging in voter suppression(fascism). Don’t get me wrong I can’t stand Biden or Harris, but we can’t let Trump erode our democracy another 4 more years

One Tough Question For DOJ If Biden Is Elected: Whether To Prosecute Trump
Most candidates run to the center in the general election. Biden is moving left.  via
Oh, “it’s on” alright. Pence has no idea. He hasn’t a hope in hell. 🇺🇸 #biden Harris
Says it all. Simple as that. Biden/Harris 🇺🇸#freep #detnews #PureMichigan #BidenHarris
Joe Biden : Demagogues are great for Jewish worshipers
Hell know to Biden and Harris!
So did The Simpsons predict a Biden/Harris ticket and were they in the white house, we need to know
Bernie: sets of easy to digest plans with bills backing them up  Biden: I’m gonna restore the soul of America and I’m not Trump. C’mon man!
I’m been trying to convince my socialist friends to settle for Biden for months, and this short video makes me want to stop that.   Shane, go phone bank for Joe, rather than shit talk leftist who have legit reservations on how bad the Dems are.
Not sure what that has to do with anything. Biden being old just means that he's from a different generation than the populist wing, which was true for HW too
By the way Biden's is obviously George HW Bush, who was the VP of a popular more conservative president and fought of a conservative populist in the primaries.
DOJ? PFFT. Please with a criminal as AG. I can't wait to see these criminals go to prison. Biden has already said he will not stand in the way of investigation and incarceration of these criminals.
The weirdest part of 2020 is that Joe Biden essentially dominated his primary, is up 7, and his supporters don't expect him to really be president, as if this hasn't been something he and his circle have wanted for 40 years.
just watched your show. I loved how Biden teed up the mispronunciation of Kamala for you. I laughed out loud
The point I'm making is that Biden/Harris have a better chance of helping someone.
Wouldnt someone who champions Biden and the cop be outing themselves as well?
I feel you, I understand the gravity of it all. I can’t vote for a guy just because he’s not another guy. So I either stay home, or write in Andrew yang. Biden is more of the same and will usher in someone even worse than Trump
Awesome!!!! GO BIDEN AND HARRIS!!
Netflix is not a propaganda machine? I mean, Obama is part of netflix is he not?  Yes the US (cia..intelligence agencies)have done and allowed some creepy things...u see Trump is cleaning out deep state  pedophiles, thieves like biden, child traffickers...that's why trumps hated
I followed you and I care, as I am sure all reading this do too! I understand and this year has been awful. I have those feelings daily too. You are not alone. Try to feel the hope of Biden/Harris and we have work to do to make sure it happens. We are stronger together! 💙💙💙
I get Trump’s an idiot. But this is decency? Biden/Obama invaded Libya illegally, dropped record drone bombs on 7 countries, fueled Syrian/Yemeni conflict with arms and left 100,000 dead brown people. Seriously wondering if humanity doesn’t extend to non-Americans.
Bleeding liberal here. Biden/Obama admin invaded Libya illegally, dropped record drone bombs on 7 countries, fueled conflict in Yemen and Syria and left 100,000 brown ppl dead. But sure, speaking well is so important you forget about war and murder.
I get you can’t vote for Trump. I’m a liberal too. But calling Biden decent and humane? Obama/Biden invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries in record numbers, fueled Yemen and Syrian conflict and left 100,000 dead brown people. Does your humanity not extend to brown ppl?
No new country was invaded for the first time this century.  The Dems savage Trump for being a “threat to humanity”  100,000 brown people died from Obama/Biden wars and drone bombing in Libya, Syria &amp; Yemen.  The Dems? Endless praise and voting for more.  Posturing assholes
Yeh...just like the deep state dumbasses biden..Harris...Schumer..Pelosi...r going to "really" change things for the better...this time.. really ? just vote for Trump..do yourself &amp; your family a favor...Trump has done more in 3  years than the last 4 puppets put together, awake!
- Biden is leading in 5 of the top 6 battleground states and the other one he is tied with Trump.   - His current average overall approval rating is 43.4%  If you don’t believe the polls, okay so be it, but he’s blatantly making shit up here. Come on now lol be better.
When we read this headline.   BIDEN/HARRIS WIN WHITE HOUSE.
Majority of Americans (even 49% #Democrats) think   would not finish first term if elected  #tcot #gop #migop
Out-of-touch #Democrat  thinks helping Americans through this pandemic equates to war on Social Security  #tcot #gop #migop
Joe Biden couldn’t put a 25 piece puzzle together, but he’s going to put the economy together! 😂😂
After the 50th lie poured out of Biden’s mouth, I had to change the channel. Therefore never heard a single word Harris had to say; oh well. No loss.
I’m not voting Biden and I did vote Hillary.  Polls are BS.
My mistake Cher.  That's supposed to say if there is one. Cher. Do yo think your friend Joe Biden is going to be President? Just curious Cher.  Me I have this really really good feeling that he will be.  And my feelings usually have been accurate. So now do you think he will be?
Kamala Harris won't stop talking about Beau Biden, it's very suspicious that she would spend this much time talking about a dead person. Possible ties to necromancy? - The Gray Fox
Question: Obama/Biden invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries, fueled conflict in Yemen and Syria and led to 100,000 dead brown people. Does compassion only extend to American people? How can a liberal vote for this warmongering?
I understand you’re excited. But where’s the justice for the 100,000 people who died from Obama/Biden invasion into Libya, drone bombing seven countries and fueling arms to destroy Yemen? Does compassion and healing not extend to brown people, Rabbi?
Because, for better or worse, the model is now becoming a major part of the story. You can't reliably model this election, but now people will think Biden has an easy path. They shouldn't, but we know they will, which makes the model a significant variable.
missing major point &gt; the Media is going to be working w Biden Harris - and will cover for them - they will have 98% media support
The presidential race has really heated up now that Harris will run as Biden's VP, but there is still work to be done now and well after Nov. ➡️Communities of color are still asking for police reform/abolishment ➡️The injustice to Breonna Taylor has yet to be rectified (1)
Hmmm, Joe Biden has chosen the first female Redguard VP.. -The Gray Fox
When you're Joe Biden. But, pretty much ALL the time. 😘
Wow Harris and Biden huh, that’s pretty cool :) love the direction our country is going
I’m not mad at you because of your pension. I’m happy and proud for you.  Your vote to these Corporate owned Puppets to continue voting against the working class.  I hate Joe Biden , the anti christ of the Dems. He voted against me 1973-20009. I can understand boomers like him.
Please add Joe Biden to the mix.
I'm not gonna pretend that Biden, any dem or a politician is squeaky clean. I'm not naive. That said, we've seen trump enrich himself and his cronies right out in the open. How many of the small business loans went to his friends and himself.
Congratulations to Senator Harris and Vice President Biden for standing tall in adversity!! WELL DONE! Now we have to do our part VOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I bet 100.00 she is on a pension. Biden and the corporate elite voted to abolish those in the 70s for most of us. They were grandfathered in to keeping it.  My dad likes Biden too. He earned his pension and loves his party.  In my estimation this party dies with the boomers
That is frickin halarious. You know Biden could do that cuz clown donald can barely make it off the news conference stage without holding onto a wall or column. Watch trumpy when he exits from a stage. His balance is way off; something not right there.
The truth about Biden's tax plan
VP Biden and Sen Harris are both centrist Democrats  🤦🏻‍♂️
Hey. You vote how you vote. I’ll handle mine.  The most damage I can do to this filthy Biden nomination is to vote trump.  The greens are a wonderful  option.  A trump vote is double damage. A vote trump should not have received and a vote a progressive would have got.
I assume I'm considered a "house-wife" since I stay home to raise my son and finish my multiple degrees. But I can say that trump got it very wrong. This "house-wife" (I hate this term) is voting for Biden/Harris!!!
I understand your position. I was in it every election from 88 forward trying to get a Republican out of office.  Since we now nominate republicans I haven’t a worry in the world.  Either way these clowns are bad options. 1 has a max of 4 years left. Biden will waste 8.
Anybody realize joe Biden been in office for longer than any of us have been alive, (most of my followers) and still Has yet to change anything, what makes anyone think he will now ?😂
The leverage will or will not be made in November.  If Biden wins progressive agenda is delayed a decade or more. Trump wins, we start fundraising at the mid terms.  We nominated a Republican. I prefer the other Republican which we can get rid of in 4 years.
That’s were our opinions differ. 100 of the richest Americans donate to the Super Pacs.  They decided Biden was best for them.  Now you decide if Corporate interests have scared you into voting for their choice?  I’m not scared.  Never Biden
Bruh I promise I’ll still vote for Biden/Harris as a lot of us will.   I’m not gonna be fuckin thrilled about it tho. Please just admit you’re a moderate if you love this pairing, PLEASE.
If you think COVID - 19 is dangerous, Biden - 20 will destroy our country!
No chance in hell im voting Biden.  The corporate scare tactics are bullshit.  They bail themselves out every time anyway. 24 trillion deficit on the Conservative watch?  It’s all a bunch of bullshit. Never Biden.
...I barely rock with Biden and nothing could ever make me roll with Kamala!
WTF are you to judge my progressiveness?   DNC loaded up corporate puppets with cash to run against four progressives.  All corporate puppets lost. That is an act of political war.  Biden and every corporate puppet on all of our ballots should be voted against. Biden voted w GOP.
Occultists: I am the embodiment of an ever-changing universe, a supernatural alchemist capable of transmutation of soul, an infinite capacity for change, nothing is beyond my power.  People: We know it's terrible but please vote for Biden/Harris  Occultists: Sorry, can't do it.
Don’t care for Biden, didn’t vote for him, blah about Harris, but like to say they’re the same is a quantum LEAP
Politics is a chess game. Few Americans play chess. Joe Biden doesn't. In this game, he is NOT a King, he is a little soldier that Dems move to the left. Pretty soon, he'll fall of the chess board. Kamala is NOT a Queen either. She is a chameleon, who is easily changing colors.
The positive would be a Biden Harris loss.
Biden sets the progressives movement back a decade if he wins.  He brings nothing to the table.  This democrat is voting trump and you should too.
We nominated a corporate owned pimp which would push progressive adgenda back a decade if he wins. If trump wins, at mid terms of his second term we could start backing a progressive.  No votes for Biden.
No . If Biden wants to run , he has to debate . Nobody gives a shit about the VP 🤷‍♀️
She’s a terrible person to be giving more power to , between her and Biden they will explode the prison population in this country
I was talking to a few of my neighbors last night, they support Biden, and one of them said she worried what white men will think about Harris. I said I don’t give a shit what white men think, I care about what black women think. #BidenHarris2020
That’s exactly why I’m not voting for Biden.  Your comment meant for Dank just resonates in my mind. An anti Biden tv add should be produced using your very own beautiful words. Honestly you have talent.
Most Americans r not that stupid, biden? Somatic narcissist dumbass..Harris a covert narcissist mirrors everyone...what? MSM has deceived many to hate Trump...the spirit is called leviathan ...Jezebel/narcissist have this spirit also..it twist truth
Hell no. .....  Say Biden wins..... progressive agenda is pushed back a decade at best.  If Trump wins we start fundraising in 2 years for a progressive replacement to trump in 4 years.  No one who demands Medicare for All should vote for Biden.
Yeh cus it's a joke..lost 9 billion ? The postal service needs to b put into the private sector,so the scum in Washington  like biden..Pelosi, Schumer, Harris, who like to skim the take, b thankful we now have a president who is stopping the  skim, surprised u didn't know that
Corporate interests picked Harris. Biden is the complete puppet.
HARRIS IS A HYPOCRITE WHO SAID SHE BELIEVED THE WOMAN WHO COMPLAIN THAT BIDEN IS A PEDOPHILE. HAVE A GOOD DEMOCRAT KKK
So you don’t care about the warmongering from Biden/Obama admin that invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and led to 100,000 brown people dying? You dont care about dead brown people? you don’t care about innocents being jailed under Kamala?
Joe Biden is a secret Muslim? What happened? Did Obama secretly convert him? Did Obama convert Biden over to Marxism as well? Is Scranton, PA really part of America? Joe! Where's your birth certificate?
This VP is different. Even Biden says, he’s no spring chicken. Kamalalala is the Deep State’s choice for president! If Biden strokes all the way out, 🧨💥Who and what she is, shows everyone the utter lack of integrity &amp; willingness to be radical these LEFTIST CRATS truly are!
Yes!!!  Is that suppose to scare us? That’s part of why I am voting for Biden/Harris.
He is, but he also realizes that he needs his voters to support Biden or trump will win again
We are not listening to anything coming from a Biden camp.
For now ... until December when Biden picks her for a cabinet post ...
The real sad thing about this Biden/Harris ticket is that as a Palestinian there really is no good option for president. Both candidates and their VPs are unabashedly pro-Israel and don't even attempt to hide it with the typical two state solution lines.
“Trumps a racist, pervert, uses people of color for personal gain, babbling idiot!!”  And what did you and the DNC decide on?  A racist, pervert, using people of color for personal gain, can’t formulate a sentence (Biden’s not a babbling idiot like trump but it’s not great)
When something’s okay. “Believe all women” until it turned on Biden. “White people have to stop using people of color for personal gain” until Biden did it. “We need a president whose well spoken and not a hot head “ which Biden isn’t even close too.  “BUTTTT TRUMPPP”  Ya know,
*pretends to be shocked*  Biden, is completely using a women of color just for votes. Not because he believes she’ll do the best job. Sad. You know all the other outrage when white people, were using people of color to justify things they’ve said or done or this and that
Welcome to my Ted Talk.🐸🍵
“If you don’t vote and like Kamala Harris cause she a black women you’re racist and sexist. Hate her because of her views”  Is it okay to pick her strictly because she’s black and a women even though she isn’t most qualified, if at all??  “BIDEN WOULD NEVER THATS A TRUMP THING!!”
Times up for Trump for sure, but a tough on crime prosecutor and Pro Police Biden? Not sure It's going to be a great thing for BLM. Definitely a team that I will be closely evaluating over the next 4 years.
No she didn’t change her mind! She’s looking at this as a opportunity if Biden gets sick she can take over as President!
Don’t think so! She won’t be debating ! It will be trump and Biden!
White larpers pulling a Joe Biden on this guy and telling him you ain't really black...

Her and Biden are chomping at the bit to gain more power and incarcerate more people than ever before
Kamala Harris is no “friend” of the people , between her and Biden more black people will end up incarcerated than ever before 🤷‍♀️
You do know Biden and Harris stance on crime and mandatory sentencing , they are the reason we’re in the mess we’re in now . Prison populations will explode if these 2 ass clowns get more power
Between her and Biden , the prison population will explode 🤷‍♀️
You will never ever ever get a perfect politician. There will never be a garden of eden so to speak, but you can vote people in and work towards change. Biden 2020!
AND still voting for Biden/Harris
Joe Biden has hired me, "the gray fox", to "steal" the election... Easy for me ..
Taking on a prosecutor VP is suicide for Biden. He just lost a lot of pot smoker libertarian votes. I'm probably the only right wing pot smoker on earth.
So many wonderful jobs open for so many wonderful people with the Biden administration 🇺🇸 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBidenHarris2020
Wasn't that long ago Harris said that Biden was a sexist and molested women...so these things are no longer true?
I take it this means Harris no longer believes that Biden is a racist and a sexist...my how opinions change when you're bought off.
You actually asked Joe Biden that Cher? What was his answer? You couldn't be any happier Cher.  Im as happy as a clam or better. Look I'll show you how happy I am that Joe picked Kalama. 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😛😛🤩🤩😀😀😀😅😅😅😄😄😁😁😁😁😆😆😆😆😆🙃🙃🙃🙃😜😜😜😜. I even did a flip.
Loved meeting you back in 2018 Abdul. I think you’re right on this. I hope you also keep forcefully pushing the Biden campaign on Medicare4all since that is one of the main reasons I was a huge supporter of you back then.
Biden had a cheat sheet on his desk so he wouldn’t forget where he was. Also, is holding the phone upside down. . .
I wince when I hear people who support abolition movements toward ICE and defunding the police cheering on Biden's VP pick, who will set those movements back a generation. #KamalaHarris
Gotta remember, this isn’t a typical VP situation. Kamala is the deep state’s choice for PRESIDENT! We all know Biden’s not gonna make it very much further anyway but, the second they’re ready, they’d make him retire and have her in the oval. With her integrity... makes sense.
I disagree. Biden’s pull with those Obama / Trump voters is masssive and under reported. They will turn out where it counts.. People seem to forget that Trump won by &lt; 100k perfectly placed votes. If I recall correctly he won MI by 17k. Those votes are gone.
grand standing fraudulent virtue signaling politician of all. She was pleading to censor Trump on Twitter in order to get some cheers and when it didn’t land, she akwardly laughed through the lack of applause. She’s  screeching nails on a chalkboard FAKE. NO BUENO! NO BIDEN!
You LIAR Biden is not against NRA yes background test and Ar47, etc
Every Dem who has opinion about Biden and Harris:   Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.   You’re arguing about a fart when someone shit on your white carpet and then walked through it 9,428,016 times.   Grow up.
OMG  The woman that pointed out your racist behavior during the debates is now your running mate what is this world coming to? Show your white privilege Joe Biden your brain is mush old man
Go google Biden’s voting record from 73-09. Then stick your head in a soiled toilet and flush.  You have no idea what you are talking about.
Maybe because they know the economy will survive since there’s no way Biden can win now 😂
I know isn't great Cher.  Im so so happy. I tweeted her to send my congratulations to her. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are to do a great job. In fact they right now doing a great Birthday. Trump is already running scared. He knows that Biden has the upper hand and may just win.
Amen, Jason. Amen. With Biden in the WH, Elizabeth Warren will have her day. Good things ahead. We just need to get out the vote. 🇺🇸#BidenHarris #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt
Vote Trump nothing harms Corporate pimp Biden more.
The point in using those videos is to say “this is the type of nonsense that will continue if Biden is re-elected”. When he’s re-elected and the house flips over, the mess in those videos will be done. Voting him back into office will show the support is there to make it happen.
I feel like she's a good antithesis to Biden, and that they can round each other out a little more. I think she'll help capture more voters who want somebody with a harder edge.
Green is great. Trump votes are more damaging to Biden.  I’m not sure how many 29 dollar Bernie donations I made.  Close to 3500 I can account for. ( I smoke ) can’t always remember.....  DNC fucked me out of 3500ish. Trump it is this ballot
Not only is  incredibly smart and thoughtful, she’s a great mentor for so many Latinas in politics. The Biden-Harris team is in good hands! #TheFutureIsLatina
"Flashback--Kamala Harris: ‘I Believe’ Biden Accusers"  #news #feedly
"Flashback: Kamala Harris Said She Believes Joe Biden’s Accusers, “I Believe Them” (VIDEO)"  #news #feedly
They will when we start winning. This Biden nomination saved me a small fortune in political contributions. I gave 100 to that 70 something year old lady to retire.   That lady, is gunna be most of us if we don’t eliminate the corporate owned DNC and their gaggle of puppets

I want the two party system dismantled and new people brought into office more than anything, but when our currently leader is beginning to mimic HITLER? there’s only so much you can do.  I will be voting Biden and Harris in November, because I’m scared not to. you should be to.
May I ask are you turning out to vote Biden?  Only fair to say I am not.
It means Biden is so racist, he can’t even keep it a secret. OVER &amp; OVER!
I cannot get rid of a Biden, Kamala Harris header 😵
Do I just roll with people that are a lot further left than Biden/Harris, and they really ARE a good representation of most dems? Idk who I wanted him to pick, but she’s just never been someone I’m excited about.
You don’t understand because you don’t think backwards like a Democrat. It’s not about what she stands FOR. It’s a new way to attack Trump &amp; his voters. Anti-Biden/Harris will be considered “anti-women” &amp; “anti-people of color” 🙄 IT WONT WORK but, it will be PAINFULLY CRINGEY!👇🏽
She’s a liar also! But then Biden is also!
Oh my God this woman is a liar! She knows Biden is a racist!
How does any decent person say “I believe them” yet still support Biden? It’s one thing to be a little too flirty or make inappropriate comments, especially considering he grew up in a different era. Um excuse me..FINGER RAPING A STAFFER...UNFORGIVABLE!  Really Democrats? REALLY?
This was the difference between Sanders and Warren. This is why I had to vote Biden in my state primary.   DON'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE FANTASTIC
Bullshit! He picked who he wanted.   I wanted Warren/Harris. Then Biden/Warren. But I GOT Biden/Harris and guess what? It's STILL going to be a successful ticket and they'll accomplish great things.  COVID has validated Warren policies. She'll be unstoppable in the '21 Senate
Remember when Trump told Chris Wallace there’s no enthusiasm for Biden. Keep thinking that, big guy.
If you are spending today not criticizing the literal warmonger Biden who invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and left behind 100,000 dead brown people, quit with your social media posturing.
Well considering Biden doesn't even know where he is you better hope you're right on that.
My dream was Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang and here we are with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris...
How did ‘holding them accountable’ work when Biden/Obama invaded Libya leaving thousands dead or drone bombed seven nations? There ain’t no excuse to vote for a war criminal. Atleast Trump hasn’t invaded a new country.
Biden/Obama bombed seven countries, destroyed Libya and drone bombed merrily. Kamala prosecuted innocent people. You don’t have to do this. Disagreements are fine but not with a warmonger and a criminal top cop.
More important question: Why did she endorse Biden after calling him a racist segregationist and saying she believes the women who accused Biden of sexual misconduct?
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate
What a terrible choice. Good ole Joe. Politics at its best. Biden sucks.
Lol I love Rashida! She still never really endorsed Biden or Kamala! 😂 but I understand she still has to do things like this
This ad is basically an own goal, eh.  So far, you've spotted Biden/Harris 3 goals and there's 8 minutes left in the 3rd period.
Biden picking Harris as his VP is the most bone headed, tone deaf move he could have possibly made. He just made it way harder for me and I’m sure many other true progressives to want to vote for him.
Okay. All hands on deck. What Joe wants Joe gets! Biden/Harris it is 🇺🇸 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #BidenHarris2020
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist?
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist?
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist?
Hi I'm just tweeting you to CONGRATULATE you on recieving the highest honor for any woman thus far.  Joe Biden selected you to be his running mate. That is great news. You and Joe Biden will make a great team as our President ( Joe Biden ).
Oh my Gosh they are throwing everything in the mix to try to get this idiot elected!!! Let’s see if this really happens when the TRUMP Administration is our and BIDEN is in!!!
Are you on drugs?  Did they not have books in your school?  Joe Biden voted with the GOP from 73-09.  He can unify a damn thing. Don’t even let me get started on you.....
Yes Cher this is a time to celebrate and dance around with love in our ❤❤❤❤💘💘. Because it is the day that Former Vice President Joe Biden selected Sen Harris as his running mate. All of us woman should all go and play your song WOMANS WORLD.  It would sound perfect now.
My fear is I’ve seen this movie many times before.  Biden wins the DNC will fuck up the next 10 years with their corporate puppets.  The key is to cause them to lose. And try again in 2024.
It's a good ticket and it shows Biden has a thick skin. I like the idea of a cabinet of rivals, historically it has resulted in great leadership.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Congratulations to Senator  I think this is an excellent choice. #BidenHarris2020
SOLID pick! Let’s do this 🔵🇺🇸   #BeatTrump #BidenHarris2020 #Biden2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP #Biden #Democrats #USA #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #HistoricPick #Kamala
Biden-Harris for the WIN!
Crazy as it sounds......  I too thought of 3rd party.  Idiot Biden could still win.  I’m voting in a “ Bi-partisan manner for Trump”.  I hate trump. But I’m not wasting 4,8,12, up to 16 years on Biden and Harris corporate asses.
Fun fact: Joe Biden's first choice for VP was John W. Davis.
Kamala Harris used to work with Hunter Biden doing what who knows? She enforced that 1994 crime bill against black defendants to its full extent. As a student of former mayor Willie Brown , whom she had an alleged affair with  Willie said she would make a lousy president!
You're out your damn mind. Trump has done WAY more for the Black/Hispanic communities than any other president. Biden on the other hand says you aint black if you don't vote for him
The NRA has nothing to worry about your safe. It’s everything else Biden and Harris get their hands on we need to worry about. Lucky for us Trump will be re-elected no worries.❤️🇺🇸
Progressives will definitely NOT get on Board with a Biden/Harris ticket you can be sure of that
me when im seeing all this new biden/kamala merch
She couldn’t beat Bernie. Or Biden. She will be destroyed
Please help support Joe Biden 2020, add a #Twibbon now!
Things that are infinitely more surprising that Biden’s VP pick: Milo’s DNA test results!
Was there any Democratic primary contenders more conservative than Biden and Harris? Seriously asking
Two racist people and Biden cannot even talk or form a sentence or answer questions Harris wants to defend police, to losses
This fella has a real good YouTube show.  I watch it daily.  He is a Republican but not the idiot wearing an AR15 to the grocery store kind.  Kind of a silly post,  maybe he is paid by the comment or retweet.  Biden’s nomination took me from MSNBC and politics until 2023 ....
Awesome. Didn’t she call Biden a racist and also say she believes Biden’s accusers! What a joke,
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris As Democratic VP Running Mate
Ok is that why she went and met with Biden last week .
Biden has to win first. Cast your vote wisely.  I don’t need a corporate owned incumbent in 2024. I’m voting trump. This way we can nominate a progressive or elect yet another Republican.  Corporate Dems are worthless
I’m stoked for a Biden/Harris ticket. Imagine competent leadership!
Why was msmbc so late in announcing Biden’s vp pick
Hell yeah!  I’m way more excited about Kamala than Biden but let’s do this!!! #bluewave #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris2020
Biden/Harris was the obvious ticket. She can now push police reform as a former AG, she's got a ton of charisma that'll remind people of Obama, and it'll set Dems up for 12 years in office when she runs in '24. #BidenHarris2020
I can't wait for VP Harris to be the girl power face of what's sure to be a brutal, sustained, and punitive crackdown on protests using faceless federal troops the SECOND Biden wins. Assuming he does of course, and that's no slam dunk.Fake News! Not sure what “reliable” source you even got that from! I’m sorry but it’s not right, also I would be shocked if Biden did 1 of those things on that list you gave! 😂😂😂 he wouldn’t just like Obama, named 10 things, but he only did 1 of those 10 things. A Joke!
What’s funny is with Biden &amp; his running mate, very Little change, Hmmm maybe that proves to you that Biden isn’t a good choice. It’s also in a rise and trumps still in office
"...suburbs are shifting in terms of demographics and political loyalties, becoming less white and more Democratic in recent elections."  So if you don't vote for Biden your not black, confirmed.
😂😂😂😂 omg I don’t even think he’s perfect, but he is doing and caring for the country unlike Biden did &amp; Obama. Here’s a thing btw that Biden said, a few things that where racist, this is from a democrat btw!
Biden’s been supporting China for the past 40 yrs it’s their, that’s out their, look it up, That’s a fact. What did Obama did back when H1N1 was in 2009, why did it take him 8 months to finallly do something?
Also True, Facts are facts! The letter is racist and it shows how Biden is, We don’t want that as our leader in the Novel Office!
Shall we start with Joe Biden?
It is mainly focused on the Democrats and liberals not so much as Biden, he’s just gonna be a puppet and listen to what the liberals want him to do
Fine believe what you want, but Biden isn’t gonna be better I’m telling you
Ok But still Biden is not going to be a great president is what I’m stating he isn’t gonna do anything for the country, he doesn’t care, the liberals don’t care
Well then explain to me the three racist things that Biden said? He even picked a black candidate so then the blacks would vote for him
Destroy economy = more votes for Biden? How does that even make sense?
Clearly you don’t see that the left is what started this bullshit and not Donald trump! Get more Educated and see the truth for what it is! Biden will destroy this country.
Am I thrilled, excited, or inspired by the Biden-Harris ticket? Absolutely not. It's truly disappointing. Am I going to vote for them without hesitation? Of course. The alternative is four more years of Tr*mp.
💔 vote for Biden
I am a boomer and will fight like hell to see Biden/Harris elected😊
Branding really makes a difference... Pence says “socialized medicine and abortion on demand” and I hear “healthcare for all and women’s rights.”   Happy to cast my vote for a Biden Harris ticket on Nov 3
Kamala Harris being the VP is a joke let alone when Biden dies and she becomes president. Please for the love of god look into her history as DA and AG
Somebody said “countdown til Biden calls her homegirl” 😭😭
If Biden doesn’t win with his running mate as the first black woman to ever be on a major party ticket (THIS IS LITERALLY HISTORY) , then it’s just not meant to be
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Also why doesn’t everyone else see the creepy rape faces? Hunter Biden &amp; pelosi’s son have them too 🤮
No I was referring to Biden, Not trump! I’m not saying trumps perfect, but he’s far better than Biden
Hopefully, President Biden will be able to restore things.
Michigan Gov. Whitmer Met Biden In Person As VP Decision Looms  via
Who ever said he was perfect, not me, I do have some hate over trump once again, I don’t think he’s perfect by any means and their are some things he should be way better on, but he’s miles better than Biden. So I’m going with the better option
Btw I’m not part of the corruption people that think Biden’s the best, I see the facts for what they are, so quit saying shit that’s not right about me.
Or Biden who doesn't know what job he's running for
He isn’t, even if he is sorta or kinda bad, he’s doing what needs to be done for this country plain and simple. Also Biden can’t even speak a sentence without having notes, that’s a bit concerning.
Exactly &amp; you’re trying to prove that Biden is Innocent, you’re Dumb he’s Not Innocent! At all! He’s corrupt just like the others, Pelosi, Obama, Etc.
Thank you for this. Biden is a man whose faith has been tested through his life and has found solace,peace and strength in his Catholicism.  There are no words to describe how immoral Trump is but craven and despicable come to mind.
I understood that there is a grieving period for what could’ve been, so I waited to speak, but now that it has been many months since the Democratic primaries effectively ended I want to say: that a vote for anyone (or not voting) other than Biden is a vote for 45.Biden 60% will make the Oakland County GOP cry.
Yes.   Also, Warren with the KO punch to Bloomberg was pretty interesting. I thought Bloomberg was gonna steal the Biden lane for a minute.   Biden owes Warren for that. LOL
That would be crazy. Biden would have to win Texas if he won the third district
Finally!!! Biden, Harris blasted by mainstream media for not taking questions from reporters

This is a terrible headline, but the story itself is a very good inside baseball/process view.  As for Whitmer, she had made it clear for months that while she was flattered to be considered, she wasn't interested at this time; she's busy saving Michigan.

Chameleon Harris can’t make up her mind and Slow Joe Biden can’t find his mind. If only they would mind their own business, it would be no problem. But, they may well wind up leading the country. Where will they lead it? Who will lead them? Reject this puppet show.
I never thought anyone could compare in speaking ability to President Obama. Harris did it today. She hit it out of the park. It was one of the best speeches other than ones by JFK that I have heard. She will be formidable. Pence and Trump are no match. Biden was excellent too!
We know there's always behind-the-scenes negotiating for a job as important as Vice President, but let's put what's important front and center: Kamala Harris is an eminently qualified, battle-tested candidate. Her record earned her the nomination.
IMO Biden needs to secure the moderate vote more than the liberal vote and Kamala was a good choice for that. Really there weren’t many candidates who were a woman of color and also qualified to govern the country. I agree that it’s not the best look but also people need to chill

Ok sure but there 3 months till the election do you think enough people are going to vote independent (and agree on a candidate) to make even a dent against Biden or trump Conservatives are anti change that's their whole schtick, you need a liberal supreme court for real change
Climate change is an existential threat we need to address immediately, right?  Biden has a $2 trillion dollar climate plan approved by the Sunrise Movement.  So, is the message "we need to fight climate change now, but the Earth can survive 4 more years of Trump"?
Given the current situation, I think its extremely important that I/we vote for Biden/Harris, but just because I have less criticisms of them than I do their opposition, doesn't mean that those criticisms disappear
There's a lot of talk saying people with severe criticisms of Biden/Harris unrealistically want a perfect candidate and I think that's a BIG stretch. Gigantic even.
I'd prefer incremental progress and Biden passing a public option getting us from 20% uninsured to 3%.   I guess you'd prefer Trump taking us from 20% back to 40% once they finish gutting the ACA in his 2nd term on the hopes a socialist revolution will happen.  2/2
They truly have no consistent message against Biden.  He's on decline. But he also leading Antifa. He's bought by Wall Street. But also lead by radical socialists like AOC He wrote the crime bill. But he's going to let gangs loose in the suburbs.

why are you voting for biden and Harris if you're not racist? You clearly don't know anything about them
i am disappointed in joe biden’s choice  for VP but i’m also disappointed to vote for joe so...... i guess it’s fine
Biden/Harris support return to Iran deal which takes the Mullahs/Hezbollah off their death bed and resuscitates terror and violence toward Israel. They support threatening Israel to make concessions and deals with Jew hating Abbas etc.
And they along with Bernie endorsed Biden.
Looking at the various "if the election were held today" polls and the comments under them, it's pretty clear Democrats/liberals aren't happy with Biden/Harris ticket. Almost all of the "what about the 3rd party option" replies are from the "resist" types.  Just an observation...
She has publicly called Joe Biden a racist. Now she's joining him on the ticket. Either she doesn't have integrity or she has become a racist or she was slandering an old man for her win! What do you think?
So because the Obama team didn't do it this way they automatically assumed that Biden's team wouldn't?  It makes sense, really--get the oppo out there to see if anyone gives a shit *and* to see how the prospective VP candidate handles/responds to it being dumped.

So here’s a question: How long has his digital/graphic design team known she was his pick? Or did they create logos, websites, graphics, site content, etc for EVERY likely choice just in case? Are there Biden/Warren, Biden/Whitmer &amp; Biden/Rice websites buried on the server?
The pressure for Biden to have some major legislation will be intense not just from Bernie or Warren but yeah that’s makes sense.   If there is no Senate Majority we might as well sit back and watch Netflix.
If Biden wins there will literally be a Qanon caucus in 2022.   I wish I was joking
I think folks are under the impression that Biden himself is acting as his own web developer or something.

Interesting that the stock market took a hit near the end of today. If Biden wins. We will find out what the crooks were up to these past years.
Biden made the best choice possible imo. And the others will be part of his team. As a lawyer. I respect her intelligence and ability. Joe needs a fighter. He will unite Dems and have a great cabinet. Trump can win only by cheating. And he will try.
The bussing comments made by Biden against Harris in the debate were overstated. Bussing was never a great solution to a big problem. But it also allowed many of color here in Detroit to get to better schools and many from poor neighborhoods. In retrospect. It was a disaster.
My favorite part of Biden selecting Kamala as VP is watching lefty twitter meltdown.  Bruh, y'all shot your shot when Biden won the nomination. Y'all already said you weren't voting for him.  But enjoy all those likes and retweets from the "Kamala is a cop" crowd.
Anyone else feel like Biden just shot himself in the foot by picking Kamala? :/
I have stayed out of the frey. But I believe this is a great choice. She can take on Trump and Pence and Mitch. Trump can’t attack too hard. She knows the law and how to take on Trump. Biden may have Warren at Treasury. Those tax returns. Schiff as AG. Abrams at HEW.
Newt you are 100% correct that Biden desparetely needs to shore up his support in the black community, although not the first to notice it.
Welp, the far left and the far right hate the pick, so Biden must have made the correct choice.
Clinton had the most progressive platform of any GE candidate ever. It wasn't left enough for some. So Biden, some1 more moderate than Clinton, won this time. He's made the same concessions to the left (maybe more). If he loses, u think we're going to get some1 more left in 2024?
No. Portland is a niche issue on Twitter and people who watch Fox News. They are already voting for Trump. Portland isn't going to swing anyone towards or away from Biden. It's silly.  These polls are stable and what little movement they have is within their own margins of error.
“Biden picked WHO???”
Nobody including Joe Biden cares what this guy thinks
If that's a criticism, then Biden couldn't raise his kids properly.
I wonder if Trump is jealous of the VP process Biden is going through. Biden will be the decider.   Trump was definitely forced to have Pence more than he wants to admit.
This is absolutely true. Trump needs to leave office, but Biden keeps doing horrible things like this since he feels entitled to votes at this point.

Joe Biden has tried to cut Social Security for decades. That is his life’s work. He forgot.
Joe Biden has tried to defund social security for decades.
And Joe Biden for now is NOT the President and can speak from his home or anywhere he wants but not on the People's property. To make such a comparison indicates your total ignorance. There will be no GOP and history will tell the story not Trump.

You are too kind Benjamin. This vile lie has cost many lives and much destruction. Biden is repeating it for personal gain without care for his country.
Macob is a bellwether and yes i think Biden will win Macomb.   Biden doesn’t have to win Macomb to win Michigan.
To bad the impeachment in the shirt tales of the Coronavirus was beating and failed just like the virus will fail. The economy is going to come back roaring with a vaccine, shortly. Also Biden and Hillary and many of their friend shall be indited.
I suspect this as well. I think Biden made up his mind a few weeks ago but wants to wait as long as possible in order to shorten the bullshit attack season as much as he can. Plus, Obama didn't announce *him* as his running mate until *August 23rd* 2008 anyway.
The backlash wouldn’t be as bad now given a) the lawsuit, b) expanded subsidies and c) ten years later I think more people understand it’s purpose than did at the time...but I just don’t see it happening. Biden said he wants to do so but I don’t see that in his healthcare plan...
It’s time for Biden to pick his VP. And for his great team of female and male surrogates to campaign. Harris. Warren. Mayor Pete. Bernie. Amy. Yang. Pelosi. Schiff. Abrams. Whitmer. He has a dream team of talent. Get started. Early voting is coming. Start now.
Joe Biden is repeating the Ferguson lie. It didn’t happen Joe! It wasn’t systemic racism.

Thank God. Imagine the relief of getting to protect the Senator or VP Biden instead of the grifter family.
A Biden/Harris ticket is not awesome if you want true progress as a Democrat. Neither of them have shown commitment towards the popular progressive policies the people actually want. They’re better than Trump... but many people “don’t like it but will support it anyway”.

Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals
The right was going to attack whoever Biden picked as “the most liberal VP pick of all times!!!!!” However, their attacks on  reveal just how racist and misogynistic they are as a collective group.
I cannot WAIT til Biden and kamala release all those kids from cages and TEAR DOWN YOUR WALL!!! 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
Was good til I woke up and saw Trump tweet that Biden kid racist PLEASE! This from a KKK family
you're right, it doesn't make any sense for Hitler to be Biden's VP. whoever suggested such a hypothetical must be a real bologna head.
#KamalaHarris Ultimately will be President if Biden wins, and I just don't think she is up to the task. Her policies would greatly hurt the economy in a time of crisis and she would further add to the political division in the nation.
Great! Biden needed someone more liberal on the ticket. That’s an awesome endorsement!

Yes, noted devout Roman Catholic Joe Biden is the anti-Bible candidate who wishes to hurt God, not the dude who didn't know it's 2nd Corinthians, and had protestors violently removed from a church for a photo op.  But tell me more about how Biden is Sephiroth, please.All MAGA are like that and have no idea what;s going on except Hunter Biden and all that bull....
The two people I criticized most at the beginning of this campaign have now become the presidential and vice-presidential nominees. As much as I'd like to see Biden with more progressive ideals, anything is better than Trump so the Biden/Harris ticket has my vote.
So, w/all the talk of the Trump judges. 2020 elex can have big impact on the next judges for the circuit courts  My approach was, any judge born 1960 or before = may flip (tho of course this is hard to measure.)  IOW, almost all circuits could flip in Biden p.1 or Trump p.2

That sounds like you're making a factual statement. Can you back that up? That Biden didn't choose Harris? I would like to see your source.
Join me in supporting Joe Biden!
Get Trump out you won’t be sorry if you vote for Biden and Kamala our country will be normal and they will get things done for every one🙏🏽
They could get their wish next week when they dump Biden for Clinton.
I've always thought Pelosi's theory of the election is 2020 will resemble 2008, when the bottom fell out of the economy in September. But this September we're more likely to see a pretend vaccine introduced, Barr indicting a Biden or 2 and Dems signing off on checks for everyone.
Joe Biden and the Great Leaders of 2020 Are Part of a Club
Trump is disgraceful trash.   Biden Harris 2020🇺🇸
Biden's got his pit bull. This is awesome.
With Harris as Biden's VP pick, and Biden being an aged individual, don't call it too soon!
Biden’s bugs has a nice ring to it. But I’m told it is worms that have eaten his brain🤷‍♂️
Are we a LAWLESS country? 46 states warned they'll be disenfranchised &amp; their ballots not counted! Trump now asserts Harris is INELIGBLE due 2 parents heritage! Sen.Ron Johnson admits his Russia probe was 2 get negative info on Biden 2 secure Trump win! #Resistance NOW!
So the challenge is to paint Joe Biden as too old but somehow has an e-mail scandal.
I'm sorry if you're upset, but please vote for Biden. We deserve better than a wannabe dictator. Thanks.
Harris’ past position on surgeries was wrong and did serious harm. But she has also done significant good in advocating against “panic” defenses. Painting the Biden-Harris as anti-trans is misleading.
Also not true. Did the Obama-Biden administration do enough? Absolutely not. But they did put in place better policies in federal prisons. Those policies were rolled back by the Trump administration:
I guess Biden will have to sign an executive order outlawing high capcity magazines. Trump showed us the way to get things done.
appreciates msm positive coverage/deal w/Israel &amp; UAE. Other countries “coming into the deal.” Brushed off Biden taking credit.POTUS says Obama &amp; Biden did a terrible deal w/Iran that Prez stopped, Biden doesn’t even know the names/countries prez is in negotiations w/now.
This is a misrepresentation of Biden’s position and record of action for trans rights:
Trump is the alternative or did I miss something? I have a lot of issues with Biden and Harris but the alternative is far far worse.
Ha  I can't imagine there would be a substantive change in US/Israel policy with a Biden administration.
I like the line “your privilege if not voting for biden is hurting poor people and people of color” while they bash poor people and people of color for not being enthusiastic about biden and for not voting for biden lol
No questions...no debates. Why bother if you're Biden? Hiding in the basement is working!
look i just think that if joe biden and others can work to destroy the lives of the working class and black people, they deserve people hollering outside their homes 24/7. fuck this "we have to treat these monsters with civility" nonsense
I can honestly see Biden-Harris (assuming they can even manage to win despite this openly proclaimed effort to steal the election) going either way on all these things. their records tell me to be cynical; my hope comes from the tendency of events to overtake politicians
if you want every leftist to vote biden, try to figure out people's thinking rather than placing yourself in some imaginary category of "Adults Who Get Their Hands Dirty" (when all you ever do is sign the occasional check and watch MSNBC while making little tutting noises)
if you look at Biden's and Harris's records, it should be a genuine question for you how many of Trump's actual policies they will discontinue. his *style* will of course be gone overnight. will the tough-on-crime dem and the top cop really shrink ICE?
the cases against voting biden I'm hearing from the left are such above-it-all displays of moral purity as "I survived sexual assault and I believe Tara Reade" and "biden's drug laws killed my relatives." definitely people who are way too comfortable. for sure. great take
I finally can't agree with swing-state voters who won't vote Biden for left reasons, but seeing them demonized by people whose engagement w/politics is just clueless, ahistorical fandom makes me sick
Let’s face it, everybody knows this is about not electing Joe Biden, it’s about trying to get Harris to be the next black woman president. He’s even admitted that he is a transitional candidate.
Op-Ed: If Biden wins, don't expect Trump to accept defeat and head for the exit

No one know who they pick when they go into the voting booth. I hope there are some women who are tired of the male BS and vote to Biden/Harris.
kind of disheartening that a good portion of the people i saw bitching about third party voters in 2016 are the same people in 2020 saying “tell me exactly why i should vote for biden/harris.”

Biden whipped votes for that war!
"Or, as one former Biden official put it: 'I don’t think he really cares about what a 30-something Pod Save America host thinks about him, and that honestly might be why he’s the nominee.'"  Sensibilities like this are why I think Biden has a good shot at winning.

James Woods thinks that America has, at most, another four years to survive because Republicans like Mike Pence and Nikki Haley won’t defend America, let alone Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They’ll all just leave America to the wolves. Trump alone is the last defender. Bye America
You don’t have to support Biden. You should still vote for him because leftists need to infiltrate the DNC as opposed to being outsiders to the party.  did a video today and made the same arguments.
How Biden could Turn it all around in Two weeks if he Wins
I’ve got my own negative feelings towards Biden but you’re correct to here to professional politicians speak was a nice change of pace
It would be harious to watch Biden introduce himself 15 times to foreign leaders because worms have eaten his brain and taken his short term memory.
Hi Gaby! I'm very behind on the JBU podcasts, but I'm investing time to catch up! You shared a powerful quote from Angela Davis on the episode where you and Alison's TOPIXXXX was Joe Biden a few weeks back. Can you share that quote with me by chance? Thanks. &lt;3 xx
At least Kamala Harris did not insult Biden's wife or his father. Ted Cruz is not more forgiving than Biden nor is he more desperate.
No, Biden isn’t great, but I’m over my disappointment. He’s a transitional figure and his campaign all but openly acknowledges it. He’s the next step that moves us forward - why is this so hard to understand??
TRUMP is a disgrace. He lies, cheats, manipulates, and doesn't give a shit about anyone unless it benefits him. All the business owners I know are voting for Biden.
When people tell me that I have to vote for Joe Biden.
When I’ve gotten into it with them, it’s their privilege that shows. One guy’s line in the sand was that Biden wouldn’t give him free healthcare (I don’t even know that to be true tbh). I want healthcare, and decisive action on climate change, and a drastic reduction in military
This is on my mind again after hearing Biden raised $48 million in the last two days   When you can raise $$$ like that so fast it feels like the trade offs of investing in more expensive states like TX lessen
Gretchen Whitmer and Michiganders KNOW  that to be false. #FascistTrump #TrumpIsATraitor  # Vote for Joe Biden
Liberals think Biden is the compromise, while for many leftists, Bernie was the compromise.
they seem as afraid of kamala as they were/are of biden.
Flo should have been Biden's VICE PRESIDENT pick.
Guess I'm not voting for Biden now because he's running mate isn't AOC. Thanks Whit.
Now Kamala is ridden w/Biden, racist's are salivating. Saying Kamala's parents weren't US Citizens (SHE was born in US). How do they explain many of our early Pres w/parents born b4 America! (English subjects) They were White? Oh! Now I get it! #resist
There’s a new Republican talking point in town, and it “argues” that Biden is a pushover that will not be able to contain the growing progressive calls for change. If only this were true...❤️ #JoeBiden #trumpPressBriefing
You fool! It's Biden. Biden is the cadaver. Biden you have to clap to make sure he's still awake.
Ah. Well in that case, you could make the argument that Indiana’s voting Trump either way and your presidential vote doesn’t matter.  Although this year in particular, an overall popular vote number for Biden will matter in arguing against Trump trying to delegitimize the result.
What state are you in?   If it’s purple, you can do one of those third party vote swapping deals where someone in safely blue states votes your favorite third party while you vote Biden for them.
Just realized that this is broken lol. It works to for seeing if Trump wins the state but not for Biden
This is a super interesting and in depth article

Yeah, if Biden is elected he’s going to let it spread all over the US
Hi you can complain about Biden/Harris all you want but if you claim to support progressive policy and still vote third party or abstain you're a dumbass. 💜

Biden is gaffe galore and to an extent thinks in old ways. But it is extremely unfair to say he "becomes less likable every time he opens his mouth."  He is genuinely empathetic, and sensible. All low bars but they count for something.
He is going to eat Biden for breakfast and s*** him out.
Or Biden should just man up and debate like every other presidential candidate has done for the history of the United States. Why does he have to have conditions, or special circumstances?  His lying is more notorious than Trump's.
YEAH and honestly, while I'm going to vote, I can't blame others for choosing to not vote, since the rhetoric has been "yeah biden and harris worked to destroy your lives and community, and promise to do the same if elected, but shut up and fall in line because ~harm reduction~"
But has he funded his Billions to the Biden Campaign to help win the Election?  Hope so, its been Crickets from Bloomberg, since he dropped out of the Primary race.
Am I crazy about a Biden/Harris ticket No. Will I fight sexist and racist attacks against Kamala at every given opportunity? You bet.

Holy fuck listen to Biden #cornpop

I'm so excited about the Biden/Harris ticket 😭😭 But I'm afraid to get my hopes up after what happened 4 years ago.
.  who is actually a cop, is another fierce Black woman who was high on the VP list. I’m really not sure who the roses would have been happy with as VP. Besides Bernie, who is older than Biden and completely defeated the purpose of a VP for a septuagenarian
Biden: nobody is excited about him, nobody asked for him, but there he is and I guess this is our only option. Congrats Joe, you’re the Sbarro of candidates.
whether your voting for Biden or not, idrc either way, anyone who wants the Dems to be social democratic party needs to realize that excising the donor class from power is an absolutely necessary step to achieving that goal
COVID and the material conditions of the moment will probably push Biden to do some marginally good things (Enhanced UI, stimulus checks, etc.) but all these fucking jackals in the article below will work there ass off to make sure the measures are only temporary

They believe you should cheer for biden and shut up so u don’t help trump lmao u can’t win with the libs lmao
My euphoria over watching Biden-Harris was short-lived. :-(
The “joe biden is near death and cannot possibly serve a full term in office without dying” is something I hear enough from people anecdotally that I’m not going to laugh this off as fox BS, because it has obviously gotten through to people and could maybe work
Everything communicates.  Between the two campaigns' grassroots efforts via text, there's a stark difference.   Trump's is "Text TRUMP to 88022."  Biden's is "Text UNITED to 30330."  One is inwardly focused on the individual.🤡  The other is outwardly focused on uniting us. 🇺🇸

The way to visualize this for gamers is that Biden wins on a success of 1d20 unmodified vs DC 6. Plenty of tabletop gamers know how often you roll a 6 or under, especially when it counts. So don't forget to vote! It lowers the DC (to get the swamp troll out of DC).

Donald Trump should be very scared right now.  Joe Biden is out here acting presidential AF.   #BidenHarris2020
Biden: during the vetting process, I met with a lot of women and “Each of them was qualified to be president.” This was his criterion.
My basic thought: we can continue to be critical of Harris’ complicated record, push HARD on this Biden/Harris ticket and admin, and value the power of the people and mass social movements over electoral politics... (1/2)
Watching VP Biden swear in new senators was must-see TV in the Capitol.
he’s created roughly $7 trillion (one-third of the entire nation’s normal annual GDP) out of thin air and used much of that money to buy corporate stock and bonds to keep the stock market afloat. In its 107-year history, the Fed has never,ever done this
At 5:20. In November the winner will be either Biden/Harris or President Trump and Vice President Pence. But there are others running, including Brian Carrol, of the American Solidarity Party, a party based largely on Catholic social teaching. He joins us.

At 4:40. As many had expected, presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has selected California Senator Kamala Harris to join him on the ticket. Al takes a look at some of her positions and what her selection says about the state of religion and politics in the US.

My social media feeds are so much more tame now that Biden has made Kamala official.   This is what it's supposed to be like. You elect officials so that you don't have to worry about politics every frikin minute of the day.
It's the "Biden/Lady with nails on chalkboard voice " ticket ladies and gentlemen!
I wish people could just agree to disagree on the simple fact that we simply just need Trump out of office and that is the FIRST step. Joe Biden is not my first pick nor would Kamala Harris, however what I do know is that in the bigger picture Trump needs to be gone.
No. This election is too consequential to throw away your vote on a third party candidate. We can survive 4 years of Joe Biden. Donald Trump will be even more unhinged and volatile if elected again.

Biden sealed his victory with the pick of    You know and we the people know it.  The only person that doesn’t realize it is old white men like yourself.  Truth hurts
Obama, your liberal champion, with a very small political record before his presidency, became a warhawk capitalist in record time upon entering the office. You want to believe that Biden and Kamala, two blood drenched career politicians, can be influenced to do good? (3/5)
So many people are saying “let’s get Biden in office first and then figure things out later” and I just wanna say... folks got Obama into office hopeful for positive change, and he actively made things worse for a lot of people. And people considered him a progressive! (1/5)
.  says Biden's selection prioritizes Black women and Black voters with someone who is ready to govern. In addition, he can reset the narrative about his relationship with women, which had come into question.
Biden goes up to accept, pulls out his upper plate and gums "eye queet!"

2016 Bernie was railroaded by the DNC, but this time he had a ton of money and was supposed to have a ton of support. Guess what, young people suck as a voting block. Older people vote and they chose Biden for us.
Who’s you guys. I voted for Warren both times during the primaries. If you think that Biden will be worse than Trump you’re a ducking moron and are helping the same people you pretend to fight. There are no other parties. None. There is no Green Party or whatever.
There are two parts to this argument. Is there a net positive to having Biden over trump (I think the answer is clearly yes), and can anyone claim that it is immoral to support a lesser evil. I think the answer to the second question is no, but if you care about minimizing pain,
“I believe Joe Biden’s accusers... unless he’s gonna give me that VP position I’m so desperate for in which case, fuck those women!”
“Kamala is the most progressive VP selection ever!” Ok, but on a progressive scale of 1-10 she’s like a 3.5. That’s a really low fucking bar. How low do your standards as a human being have to be to view a Biden-Harris ticket as even remotely acceptable?
We could’ve had a Bernie Sanders-Nina Turner ticket in 2020, instead there’s motherfuckers out here acting, with a straight face, like we should be happy, or even satisfied, with... Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? Get the fuck out of here and take both of these assholes with you
Basically, we have one chance to stop a depression and Senate Republicans see it as one chance to give Joe Biden a depression.
I’ll heed this advice, but it’s fun to start imagining what Whitmer’s position in a Biden admin. might be
I wish no Ill on Joe Biden.  He's been through a lot, and I truly believe he wants to help the country.  But if something were to happen, I have faith in the transition of leadership.
When I was a child, I called my friends "dodo head" or something like that, because I didn't have a good response.This isThat! *I've been watching a ad in Mi. against Biden from 1987. No joke! Because it's all they have."Dodo head". hahaha yeah! 33 yrs ago.
Riots in chicago, Biden picked Harris and already heard Sleepy Joe and Commiela Harris attack adds, Post office keeps getting screwed with. NZ has some c-virus after 102 days of none of it. Still banned from canada. General twitter rage as usual.
That’s why she’s perfect as Biden’s VP. Biden wrote the bill to through black folks in prison and she enforced it lol. Biggest litmus test in politics is can u fuck over working people and people of color. If u can welcome aboard lol.
kamala is a joke. biden is a joke. trump is even bigger joke. so we all should vote for Biden by default.
Calma. Sir Allan Lichtman  has called it for Biden.
Wtf now we know joe biden and kamala Harris has contempt for both millennials and Gen Z.
A deeply flawed candidate indeed but he represents the party that is making the best effort to represent the powerless. It would be an easier call to not vote Biden if the other side wasn’t even more ignorant and further passing law to stop wealth redistribution
This video made me feel things I haven't felt since pre-2016 Hillary heartbreak and I'm very excited to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. #returntodecency
Biden climate action plan ambitious.  Big needed focus on justice. 100% carbon-free electricity grid by 2035. Really important. Unfortunately, carbon capture w sequestration unlikely to be a winner. Goal is to get off fossil fuels, AND create lots of jobs.
💯. Plan on voting for as many progressive candidates as I can. Also plan on voting for Biden/Harris. We can do both. Small steps. Giant leaps are a fools errand. Just look at the GOP response to Obama, who was not a progressive by any means.
I’ll vote against my will for Biden/Harris (our ONLY option) because we literally will not survive another 4 years with this cabinet and its members who act only in the interest of the president.
I don’t want to vote for Biden/Harris either, and at the moment I barely feel like I can, but I can’t not vote when there are huge opportunities to fix the House and Senate. Vote for congresspeople who will push for change the executive office won’t.
I have mixed feelings about #BidenHarris2020. But I do recognize that we cant fight for Black futures w/o livable Black communities. Environmental justice is racial justice. Climate justice is racial justice. So #BidenHarris have my vote. And we push.
If Australian main stream media is anything like the US (liberal left “progressives”) and you believe your media then you think Biden will win in an historic landslide. In reality where most of us live, Trump stomps Biden.
Biden and Harris 2020 🤦🏾‍♂
Is this an anti-Biden post?
The sad thing about this is two twats like Biden and Harris, despite their baggage, are much better options than Trump and Pence.
My neighbor(76y old) is Jamaican with an East Indian descent, she said she was in tears yesterday bc she felt represented on the national stage, she even asked me to get her a Biden/Harris yard sign bc she’s not good with online stuff
Perfect. You may not like Biden or Harris, but your protest vote isn’t going to help right now. Which is exactly when we need help.
The people stand with Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris! Americans demand true leadership, not liars and cheats. #VoteBlue #VoteForJoe #Joementum #Kamala!
Biden up 17 points with voters aged 65+? Guess the GOP should’ve avoided all that messaging where seniors should sacrifice themselves to reopen the economy.
Is this an anti-Biden post?
I don't know why everyone is acting like Kamala Harris isn't exactly what is expected of the Biden campaign. Biden is a centrist at best and he's looking to win the Republican vote. You're out here acting like he's some socialist savior when really he's further right than Obama
Kamala Harris is officially Joe Biden’s running mate. Michigan supporters say it’s about time.
Biden touches children in public WAY more than Trump. You have one example I have 20. I'm voting third party. Democrats threw the election.
Does this make Biden even more Catholic?
Just ordered $250 worth of Biden/Harris face masks to give as gifts to my closest African American female friends. Put it all on my little credit card but just applied for a second job so it’s worth it. As a woman and a mother I’m so excited for this historic moment!
And that’s one reason why people should vote for that ticket. Complaining about her her stance on Palestine, criminal justice, etc is supposedly one way to keep them from pandering to Republicans (tho all the BLM protests amounted to Biden saying we should up funding for police?)
6. Look, I know how much this sucks, our political system is fucked &amp; I share all your issues about Biden, but abandoning the political process doesn’t absolve you of your responsibilities, it just makes everyone around you do more work with the limited tools at their disposal
4. Biden can create a cabinet that is more progressive than he is, he can overturn every racist EO 45 every signed, he can appoint hundreds of women &amp; PoC judges into the federal court system, we’re talking lifetime appointments here in this flawed judicial system
2. it’s simultaneously true that Biden is awful but still much better than Trump (it’s a false equivalency to say they’re both the same, they’re not): one will have a black/Asian VP, put progressives in the  defend ACA, put qualified women &amp; PoC into their cabinet,
1. being a global citizen means participating in civic institutions because your vote has global repercussions, so it’s not vote or protest/organize, it’s vote AND organize/protest, let’s hold Biden accountable &amp; build off these protests
here’s my pitch for voting in the GE even if, like me, you voted for Bernie &amp; you really dislike Biden (a thread)
What about this? Does this make Joe Biden even more Catholic?
Hey  83 days until President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Enjoy your last days. #MI07
Nothing at all subtle about this morning's Trump tweet, especially if you saw yesterday's from the campaign -- which  wrote about here
Did you see her debate Biden? She can handle it.
Liberals have this fantasy where Pence doesn’t simply just recite what Kamala said about Biden during the primary
counts on the Biden/Harris' women vote. Stone laughs. Dirty Tricked? Bust AS&amp;SfakestevieSinger.  FreeMe.
Nope no one in the senate likes her she is in a very small minority in that caucus Amy is well liked and regardless of what position she holds her relationship with Biden makes her someone that will have to be dealt with

No. Harris is digusting. Biden's disgusting. There's no way around either.
Your eminence, Joe Biden is a Catholic.
One piece I can't find - how correlated are outcomes in nearby states? i.e. if Georgia goes for Biden, is FL definitely in the Biden column? or if NC goes for Trump, is SC definitely a Trump win? Iowa vs Wisconsin?

You accidentally reference the wrong Joe Biden account.
I'm... conflicted about voting...  Both from the stance that a vote gives legitimacy to the majority, not a voice to the minority, and stances closer to those taken in this article:    I cannot, with clear conscience, promote voting Biden. or voting at all.
Biden/Harris is like being offered a burnt hotdog that has been left outside in the mud for a week.  It's going to taste terrible and I would rather not eat it.  But when the only  other actual option is DOG SHIT, guess what, I'm going to eat the hot dog 2/2
CFPD getting refunded under the Biden administration is nothing huh. Spoken like someone who doesn't understand how it feels to be harassed by debt collectors.
I knew the Dems were pretending this whole time. But now I see with glaring certainty that my vote is not wanted nor really sought by them.  I was fully prepared to be lulled into voting for Biden but with Harris that olive branch I was holding my my fingertips just snapped.
The DNC has made it patently clear that my vote is less important than that of the white swing voter.  Spend your labor on bringing in those Obama-Trump voters, and Biden might have a shot at winning this.
So, neoliberal superexploitation is cool, as long as it is intersectional and multicultural.  If Biden loses, I won't blame rose twitter or white radicals, but rather the DNC that has for decades told the left to eat shit and be satisfied.
I'm fucking ecstatic for Biden's pick for VP. Kamala Harris is an amazing woman.
Haha. I’d love to see the look on just about anyone younger than 35 being told that in person.   My Twitter feed is in flames as the progressives are pissed over Biden-Kamala being two regressive cops who just jail black people.
Pease check and listen the clip below....
Same honestly we need progressive policies not whole identity politics. If fixing the nation to how it was before trump is what’s going on. That’s terrible because things weren’t so well before trump either. Biden and Harris don’t have young blk voter support
man, it really looks like Biden wants to lose this election
Joe Biden has sexually assaulted at least one woman, is complicit in locking children in cages like animals, and he praised and glorified white supremacists (which Kamala Harris called him out for), and Kamala Harris has yanked healthcare from trans folks.
Before Kamala Harris became Biden’s running mate, Shirley Chisholm and other Black women aimed for the White House
Almost had it. But then you went and typed  “Joe Biden was the best choice of a group of bad candidates because he provided at least some degree of assurance his party had not been completely hijacked by activists.”  Nope! He was/is not the best at anything but maybe plagiarism.
Oh definitely. I didn’t want Biden but Biden is what we got. RBG can’t hold on longer, we should do better to ensure that she doesn’t have to brave through the next 4 years only because we let our pride dictate who we choose (or sit out).
No. They actually won’t! Medicare for all. Biden Harris are NO UBI nope Free college nope Green new deal nope Jobs guarantee not gunna happen Corral wall street. Money out of politics. No and no again    Corporate bailouts...oh yeah. That one we get. 😡😡😡
In the end it’s our fault as leftists we picked a guy to lead our movement who loves Obama and Biden lol two guys responsible for their terrible policies that gave us trump and that trump weaponized against Americans everyday lol. We got duped.
It is choosing the lesser of the two. We’ve seen how Biden operated at the helm during the Obama presidency and we’ve seen how Trump has behaved at the helm - it’s not even a comparison.
Lmao  dissed Pamela Harris cause she wanted to "Ban Fracking which is bad for the environment...  So like  Vote Biden :)
For whatever reason democrats continue to self sabotage. Hillary in 2016. Then Biden/Harris 2020. How is the party this out of touch? You almost wonder if they’re actively trying to lose.
Does anyone have an Historical estimate on how long these Biden Harris yard signs will take to get processed and sent out

Kamala Harris only appeals to people who were going to vote for Biden anyway. Take it from someone who won more delegates than her in the primary. #BidenHarris2020
Now can we move on?
From the annoying Contract of America Republicans in President Bill Clinton’s 1st midterm to the Tea Party in Obama’s first midterm, having Qanon affiliated candidates in a Biden Midterm is when I lose all respect for the GOP.
Biden really gotta make it even harder to vote for him, huh? ACAB includes Kamala.
What?  Tax plans aren't a secret.  Capital gains for rich (which is what carried interest gets taxed under) would be taxed like normal income under Biden.
If Biden or Harris were going to “work for the people,” you ShitLibs would’ve squashed their campaigns  If you were being honest— something I’ve never known you to be — you’d rewrite this as “Biden &amp; Harris will work for 1% of the people.”  And we all know WHICH 1%If your not voting for President Trump because you don't like him, then thats like eating a dog turd because you don't like broccoli. If you are voting for Joe Biden because you think he's a moderate Democrat, then that's like eating a dog turd because someone told you to.
Kanye is Trumps and Kushners house N-word. Do you really think they are persuading him to run so West can win? Of course not...run house N-word, draw votes from Biden-Harris and watch Trump continue to decimate Black and Brown communities that he has done virtually nothing for.
Simply reprehensible and unacceptable. He knew exactly what he was doing, and it should be a long time before he works in the league again. NBA says the photographer who posted offensive Kamala Harris meme is no longer in bubble  via
No, it's not over the top of you understand history and frankly I grew up when a worst president was given two terms. And my apparent goals keep getting destroyed by people like Biden &amp; harris
Biden used a small vetting team to help decide his VP pick.
And THAT is only going to help Biden/Kamala. Your vote would be wasted. Please don't do that with November's vote!
Yeah, they found the DA had done NOTHING WRONG except the fact he was investigating the company where Biden's son worked. He was NOT CORRUPT like Joe had stated he was!
See what President Trump's son, Eric says about Biden's pick for VP.
At least a Biden Cabinet will reflect what America is, not who look and act like Trump. Competent people.
I am truly concerned this is a small step and foreshadowing to potential attempts at Obama/Biden indictments. The concurrent and impending corruption from this Administration just kills.
Biden didn’t pick anything. He can’t form coherent sentences.
No, South Carolina picked Biden. The Party elites picked #AnyoneButAProgressive
Dr. Claudes powernomics is better than anything Biden/Harris could ever come up with. #IHearYouYe

Biden refused to support M4A.
And Biden still won’t support it 🙄
Joe Biden is a WHITE SUPREMACIST and will champion WHITE SUPREMACY with a SO CALLED BLACK FACE!
I agree with  here. You should intentionally mispronounce a name. However I don’t think people intentionally do that. Biden even mispronounced her name the other day and I’m sure he didn’t mean to
I’m not clear - is the suggestion that if Biden wins, he will force a federal policy of using prisoners for work crews? I thought that was only a California thing, not national.
He's got to be younger than Biden and Trump?
Y’all finna bait me into voting for Biden/Harris and then when I later on critique Biden/Harris y’all gonna go “but you still voted for them tho 🤪” and I’m not going.
Biden, while horrible, at least doesn’t have a track record of election fraud and voter suppression; it’ll be easier to primary him then to get Trump out after four more years of advancing overt fascism.
I see a number if people saying to vote third party and oh but Biden/Harris will be just as bad as Trump and I just shake my head and assume they are bots because LIKE IT OR NOT THIS COUNTRY IS ESSENTIALLY A TWO PARTY SYSTEM. SUCK IT UP AND VOTE (2/?)
Right! They just might get cussed out by Biden or Harris, and I’ll be here for it! A bully needs to get popped real good in his mouth to get back! #Kamala
Where in the world is Joe Biden?
Uh, no. People ONLY wear masks when at supermarkets. Outside just walking nobody cares. If the mandate Biden talks about requires me to wear a mask when going out for a run, I won’t comply bc I have been doing it for 4 months without an issue
are you struggling to say VOTER SUPPRESSION because that’s exactly what Trump is doing by handicapping #USPS! I just can’t wait to see how y’all give President Joe Biden the benefit if the doubt as you struggle to report on the criminal in the WH! Geez.
Not voting for trump, Biden or Hillary once in my life will be something I brag to my grandchildren about
Campaigns usually preview their priority for major legislation, as Obama did with stimulus &amp; ACA. But Biden has been mostly negative &amp; event responsive so far (now mostly focused on COVID &amp; economy), so unclear how that would translate beyond whatever doesn’t pass from HEROES
Isn’t Joe Biden Racist For Mispronouncing ‘Kamala’?
Then Biden shouldn't be a Candidate.

Sexist and racist????? Uhm didn't you dumbocrats openly pick the senator because of gender and race???? The associated press reported Gov. Whitmer even suggested to Biden that he should pick a black woman. So who is being sexist and racist again? The hippocracy is overflowing.
Jim Clyburn’s endorsement swung the SC vote totals emphatically enough to make Biden the frontrunner—and eventually, the nominee.   Biden bet his whole race on that. Bernie crossed his fingers and hoped enough leftists would turn out nationwide that it wouldn’t make a difference.
Warren’s polices were much better than Bernie’s and she got called a snake. The platform Biden’s eventually going to run with will have a lot of important planks—many out there by Sanders and Warren staffers.  If leftists call it “shit” and don’t vote? Just makes change harder.

They want him removed because he has outlived his usefulness to them. They got their judges, now they want to discard trump and find a candidate that might have a chance to beat Biden. They just have to find someone who is just as big a tool as trump, without a side of dementia.
Joe biden sucks but trump is an existential threat to democracy so I am settling for Biden. #settleforbiden
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Biden/Harris voters 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
I think 2016 is a much better example of Bernie being cheated. This primary election, the moderate candidates simply consolidated behind Biden before Super Tuesday and the moderates outnumbered the progressives within the party
ahhh okay I misunderstood a tiny bit there. Yeah its weird that people will broadly support policies M4A (58% of primary voters in SC supported it but the state went for Biden for example) and I'd be interested in understanding why that disparity exists
I agree with all of these things as well. Im voting Biden because I think we have the best shot of getting those things under that administration and not our current one. But it's also true that a lot of Americans ARE very moderate and this ticket reflects that.
also some people dont look at policy for voting unfortunately. People recognize Biden from the Obama administration and want to return to an era of "stability", rather than pressing forward into unknown territory (socialistic policies) because they want to maintain their comfort
but the primaries are the opportunity for people to express this type of support. In Michigan, Biden won EVERY COUNTY. This is due to low voter turnout from our age bracket (18-28 voter turnout is 16%) skewing the country further right/moderate than what it should/could be.
Who I think Biden will pick for his cabinet IF he wins:  1. Secretary of State: Susan Rice 2. Secretary of the Treasury: Elizabeth Warren 3. Secretary of Defense: Pete Buttigieg 4. Attorney General: Val Demmings 5. Secretary of the Interior: Jamie Rappaport Clark
Trump organizers are knocking on doors and holding in-person events in Michigan, but  told me today Democrats don't feel its "practical or smart" to do the same for  just yet.
precisely. I just think it'll take a bit more time for the American populace to be "primed" for a socialistic/social democrat political leaning/president/etc. I can't be mad about Biden/Kamala because imo its much closer to reflecting the majority of Americans and their leanings
So we all know Trumps a POS...  and Biden’s held office for 40+ years and hasn’t created any type of change...  how did we get to this point again of voting for what YOU believe is to be the “lesser of two evils” VOTE THIRD PARTY #Joforpresident
Despite the OBVIOUSLY BULLSHIT that prisons have stocks and therefore are used for profit by pure common sense economics... It should worry people that we can’t let the Biden administration get away with this shit if he wins either. We are settling for Biden but we can’t leave 1/
Public university grads can do anything - including run for President, Vice President, and Governor.
The senior Biden advisor (&amp; former Bernie spox) cont'd:   "Wayne County are Black Voters. So, while the majority of the electorate in Michigan are not Black voters obviously we have to do real work in speaking to Black voters in Michigan—particularly in Wayne Co." #Election2020
As a real Christian, I'm offended that you are attacking Biden (Catholic) &amp; Harris (Baptist) as if your White Evangelical/Gnostic/Judaizer cult is of Jesus Christ. It's not &amp; you aren't of Christ. You don't support life as you support the Trump demonic leadership reign
They’re serving the broader coalition, which is necessary not only to enact progressive policy to defeat the literal actual fascism staring us in the face.   I think Biden’s a poor candidate, &amp; his nomination is a failure of the party. But I’d like there to be a 2024 election, so

Views of Harris are unlikely to move voters or voter blocs, but could change impressions of Biden; prior running mates have had minimal &amp; fleeting top-line effects but have changed or mollified voters’ concerns about presidential candidates
Kamala Harris is a disgusting enabler.
It's pretty self explanatory to ANYBODY paying actual attention that Biden can barely string together a coherent sentence
She didn't threaten him. U ppl R freakin idiots. Do you have a thought of your own? ITS ABOUT BIDENS MENTAL DECLINE that Democrats will replace Biden with Harris &amp; he won't be on the ticket anymore. She did sleep her way 2 the top so it's not unlikely

I’m voting for Biden only because trump is an existential threat to our democracy but he needs to support Medicare for all. He said he would veto it should it ever come to his desk. Biden sucks but trump is obviously worse so I’m settling for Biden #settlingforbiden
Harris is the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket, and she and Biden noted the historical significance.
Do you think liberals will learn anything about electability when leftists don't vote for Biden in droves?

Biden is Catholic. I believe you’re commenting on your own lack of tolerance for those who don’t share your beliefs.
For many Black women, Sen. Kamala Harris' selection as Joe Biden's running mate represents a full-circle moment after fighting for generations to have their voices heard and political aspirations recognized.
Biden’s vulnerability there is by _far_ his greatest strength as a candidate. I want a male leader willing to have those types of emotions on public display. “Manliness” as a construct in its current form needs to be buried forever.
According to a business I frequent once a week,  opinion was, won't vote TRUMP 2020. NEVER VOTE FOR BIDEN. It's Kanye or not vote for President. Just keep that vote untouched. Exactly, what GOP WANTS! THREE candidate mess splitting ticket again like past with Perot.
Biden and Kamala showcase the worthlessness of their opinions and accusations.  Haven’t they devalued accusations of sexual assault, racism, and bad policing?   Politicians need to be more honest and righteous.
I googled antifa and no references to Biden came up.  What do you do with lying reporters asking lying questions to a lying president?
He's also supporting Biden,  so... He been a dip stick fur the left for years.
Trump has no idea how to even turn on a computer. He’s just jealous that Biden can make the “magic box” do things!
True... but if Two Supreme Court Justices are tapped to  say “STEP DOWN” because they were wrongfully put there that also could be a great choice after Biden places a Black Woman on the bench!
Kamala Harris (  “He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."

Only TWO people died of Ebola pandemic under Obama/Biden in America, compared to over 166,000 deaths of COVID-19 under   #FailedLeadership
Joe Biden is so much better than Trump it's hard to believe they're of the same species
Flashback: Kamala Harris women accusing  'I believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it' To Kanamla:  Should Biden Run? “He’s going to have to make that decision for himself, I wouldn’t tell him what to do.” Now his VP?
If you think Biden’s gonna try a Muslim ban, appoint conservative SCOTUS judges, invite foreign interference in our elections, gut the USPS, undermine NATO, build a wall, AND try to race-bait his way out of a pandemic, by all means don’t vote for him.
I'll bet you Jim Acosta &amp;  won't run one story with all the facts of what Kamala Harris said about Joe Biden during the debates? How she believed Bidens accusers, and now she doesn't? Yet she stated she believed Brett Kavanaghs accusers even after the FBI said no.
It's August 12th, day after Biden said "no" maybe made an offer to handle national ROADS as nuttin here yet!
But have either Trump or Biden stated how they would plan on punishing the Houston Astros?
You sound pathetic. It’s okay that Black woman have voted for white men and women for years whether they liked it or not. You hate to see that FINALLY we have a great pick in #BidenHarris like we had in Obama/Biden years ago. Sorry, we are not sorry! Get over it! #KamalaHarris
Your Suburb or Your Roads: Biden Will Do in One or the Other
.  recommended  pick Black woman for VP slot
Dems probably won’t get control of the Senate and Biden is moderate, so not much to worry about unless he... you know... (78 years old man)
As a suburban woman I’m sorry to tell you that I never went through with the wedding ceremony with my house. My partner and I (he was a life long Republican) will both be voting Biden/Harris in any event, so it’s not an issue.
I really think the Biden campaign is tone-deaf af, not necessarily malicious, because it feels like they’re pandering to Obama-era nostalgia that many democrats feel. I mean Biden only felt emboldened to run because of his relationship to Obama
A video has been released that appears to show the moment former vice president  asked Sen.  to be his running mate.
Reason 83 to vote Democrat: The third of Job Biden's plans to Build Back Better is to make child and parental care possible without devastating the long term finances of a family.
Trump is running ads on crime (79% of ads) &amp; protests/riots (31% of ads); Biden is running more diverse ads, focused most on COVID (69%) &amp; the economy (60%). Trump is only 12% positive vs. Biden 64% positive.
There's no defending her!! she comes from slave owners her family has benefited from the oppression of the African American and Jamaican people!!   she is still a slave driver She put them all in forced labor prison And so did Joe Biden  Research and wake the hell up
Nope. You frauds can try and sidestep the debates however you want, you know the president will knock Biden's dick in the dirt.
Can someone find me statistics on people who voted for Trump in 2016 but are voting Biden this year, vs people who voted for Hillary in 2016 but are voting for Trump this year? I’m willing to bet the latter can be counted in one hand while the former is in the thousands or more.
Choosing a non-centrist running mate is a departure for Democrats. But Biden &amp; Harris match a public that is more symbolically conservative but more liberal on policy. They propose more liberal policies without selling an ideological revolution, running instead on restoration
I know people absolutely hate Biden and Harris but as a gay person please for the love of god vote Trump and Pence out. They have been the absolute worst toward LGBT+ rights, really not a debate.
I'd be more scared that they have a HIGHER AA percentage then anywhere else since she incarcerated mostly AA on Weed charges &amp; gave the toughest sentences that Biden's bill was directly responsible 4 &amp; the fact the area is very religious 2. It had ZERO 2 do with Racism. Nada
i feel so split, on the one hand i completely agree that voting for biden/harris will not solve years of generational, systematic oppression (esp when harris is an opp herself!) but i also can’t stand people acting like it’s not the only option right now
Ben Shapiro: At this point, Trump is running against Harris not Biden
Biden is the racist 🐲
Not voting for Biden is a vote for trump !!
This does nothing to perpetuate the idea that Biden is unwell. He handled himself with class in the primary debates and the American public deserves to watch him debate Trump.
It has nothing to do with hope😂 there is a ZERO percent chance Betsy DeVos is a part of the next cabinet. There is a 0% chance Trump's postmaster general for the USPS is kept on. There is a 0% chance that Biden would appoint a conservative SCOTUS judge. These aren't guesses....
.  is scheduled to make his first appearance with newly chosen running mate,  , during an event in Delaware on Wednesday.
Hopefully we can push Biden/Harris on this 🤞
Wow. "Suburban Housewife" here. Also, small business owner, active volunteer, liberal voter who would never vote for trump. I am extremely excited to vote for Biden and Kamala Harris.
Niggas gotta go vote Biden then go home and cry themselves to sleep. Hate it here I can’t wait to dip
Governor Gretchen Whitmer wanted out.
You think majority of white people voting Biden over trump? Lol
It makes me so sad and confused that people r actually voting for Trump or Biden.
That's why trump is surrounded by incompetence and Biden will build an administration that has what's best for the country as its agenda . trump and his cronies are all about what's best for them.
The bottom line here is Trump can’t be elected president again. The only chance to stop that is voting for the Biden ticket.
All I’m gonna say is don’t say shit to black women OR sexual assault survivors for feeling hesitant about voting for Biden. Everybody else is free rein
Maybe to add a little spice in addition to the Biden/Trump and Harris/Pence debate, let’s have Doug Emhoff debate Karen Pence and Jill Biden debate Melanie Trump.
I'll take Biden pushing states and potentially the Senate to dems due to his consolidation and expansion of independent and even some right leaning voters over Bernie potentially winning the presidency and maintaining the current balance of Congress. thats just me tho
i hate the biden/kamala ticket as well, literally 2/3 of my least fav candidates from the primary (worst was Bloomberg obv), i just angy at people saying they won't vote at all because donald trump is the imminent danger imo. i said it earlier but im gonna be MUCH pickier in 2024
Everyone looks so dumb being mad at those who don’t wanna vote for Biden. Like be mad at everyone who got us here in the first place...misplaced anger babes :/
Trump Just Tweeted a Video on Biden's 'Racism Problem' That Is BRUTAL
That is what they find for Palin:  But they find the Biden pick helped Obama (re-assuring voters about his experience).  Also, can sometimes split voters without helping or hurting. Paul Ryan made Romney gain with conservatives &amp; lose with moderates.
To start the conversation,  can point to myriad data showing the role of #NaturalGas in lowering #emissions.
dems are force feeding us extremely problematic options and then jumping down everyone’s throats to “VOTE🤩✨” I’m not blind to the fact that we have to get trump out of office, but dems are being tone deaf acting like they’re entitled to our vote for biden/harris in the midst..
joe biden and trump are basically the same! even though joe is for $15 min wage, student loan forgiveness, has the most comprehensive climate change plan of any candidate from the primary, will have the opportunity to replace at least 1 supreme court judge...  my brain is smooth!
Sure, you're a closet Biden supporter 😉
He was remembering how you enjoy his macaroni and cheese. Love your pic with Biden too. I am hopeful after this nightmare .
Trump is an existential threat and that’s why I will vote for Biden. Not because I think he will take our country in the right direction, but strictly harm reduction.
Interesting.  reports Whitmer told Biden’s team she no longer wanted to be considered for his running mate before her Aug. 2 flight to Deleware. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman.
Or maybe it's on Biden for not having policies that resonate with the progressive wing of the party.
NEW: In late spring, Whitmer said she no longer wanted to be considered for the VP. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman.  But Biden still wanted Whitmer in the mix, and he personally called her in mid-June to ask if she would continue. Whitmer agreed.
AP: Whitmer asked to be removed from veepstakes in late spring and recommended Biden pick a Black woman. But Biden still wanted Whitmer in the mix, and she agreed to second round of vetting.
They are very scared now. This was the perfect pick for Biden. He picked someone that is ready to be President. He picked someone that can bring unity back to this country. It’s ok if we never see eye to eye on things. But we still respected each other. First time I’m going Blue!
No longer under consideration as Joe Biden’s running mate, Governor Whitmer returns to micromanaging the state economy and our daily lives by issuing Executive Order #169 setting operating hours for grocery stores &amp; pharmacies.
Trump maintains a ~2% advantage in the Electoral College over the popular vote. He has a chance to win but Biden has a chance at a landslide. Economic conditions are quite uncertain &amp; more mixed than reported (due to stimulus income &amp; market gains)

🔴 LIVE PODCAST: 8/12/20 | Ep. 2109 Michael Patrick Shiels: Governor Whitmer Calls Biden-Harris A "Fierce Team" on
The important part of this story for the perspective of the American public is that HMO's and insurance companies have posted *record profits* since the passage of the ACA.  Care costs more than ever. And Biden/Harris oppose the best fix -which is M4A. Why, DNC insiders, WHY?!?!
I totally forgot about Hillary's awful running mate - Tim Kaine. That ticket was never going to win.  I don't like Kamala, and I cannot stand Biden - but I like what Democrats *think* Kamala is. If that makes sense.   No, it doesn't make sense! But I think they could win.
12 hours left. I’m hoping Biden leaks it pulls into the lead.
#TrumpOnHannity #Trump:We CAUGHT #Obama-#Biden uh that's why I didn't think that #SusanRice could get it cuz she's part of this whole #IllegalThing that happened which is one of the #WORST perhaps THEWorst #PoliticalScandal #InTheHistoryOfOurCountry.And #TheyGotCaught.#NowLetsSee
Yes she will raise him up:  Biden that is.
Very very disappointed in the selection of Biden’s running mate. But am I surprised? Never.
if she was smarter she would have dropped out and endorsed Bernie before super Tuesday, gotten the vp nod, trounced trump at the polls, then usurped the presidency Richard the 3rd style by pouring strychnine in Bernie's oatmeal. Now she has to watch Kamala do it with Biden :|
not all the best law schools are Ivies, but Harris and Biden went to crappy law schools!
Today we #Unite as Democrats behind our democratic nominees Biden/Harris to defeat Trump in November! We have significant work to do to win in the Midwest, this is going to be an incredibly close election within 3 points. Don't listen to the polls #DoTheWork  #BidenHarris2020
Poor Joe Biden, he's been forced further left than he's ever been, and he's been forced to pick a VP he doesn't want. Even, if he was all there mentally, this wouldn't be the way he wanted to become president.Joe Biden is the right guy to coordinate the rehab of our government. I hope he calls on all the living ex-Presidents for council, and expect he will.  He is also the right man to take Trump out behind the woodshed &amp; make sure he faces consequences. 2/5
Is this the right ticket for right now?  Yes. Yes, it is.   Joe Biden is the right man to apologize to our allies for Trump.  He has the right motivations &amp; respect. He is doing this for Beau. And he is doing this for the American people. He has the relationships &amp; sincerity. 1/5
I guess they think we cannot remember (or find) these things... Hey! Whoever is sending Biden's tweets... Please let him know that the internet is forever!
Biden actually did help right the 1994 crime bill. It’s a valid critique. But at least he now acknowledges the issues of the justice system unlike who we have now. So his statement is bull.
Didn’t the USPS workers union endorse Biden/Harris?  I’m sure they will just do their jobs and not be biased in any manner 🥴
She’ll be the kiss of death to Biden campaign.
Harris-Biden (Beavis &amp; Butthead) 🤪😂 The Demonrats are going down in 🔥
Historically vice president were opposites to their president. Really thats all she needs to say of she wants to keep the narrative that there is really any substantial difference between her and biden, or between them and Republicans for that matter. They're the same. Viels off.
Ignore him.  He’s trying to steal attention away from Biden &amp; Harris.
I'm pressuring Joe Biden to support liberal policies by attacking anyone who criticizes or pressures Joe Biden into supporting liberal policies.
crawl on my hands and knees over broken glass to get to the polls and vote for Biden/Harris.
If you want to see Trump defeated in November, spare a couple of dollars for the Lincoln Project.  Their ads are stronger than anything the Biden campaign dare put out there.
I agree.  A majority in my state decided to change the law to allow all voters to vote by mail if they choose. I am 70 years old and was counting on voting by mail in November. Now, I plan to risk my health to go to the polls to ensure my Biden/Harris vote counts no matter what
Much needed change when Biden and Harris win  the ticket. And there is no longer the likes of people like you wandering the peoples White House halls any more.
I agree with you!  POTUS will win big. I am one of the silent majority but I am building up the courage to put my TRUMP/PENCE sign in my front yard. Just on my street in my small town so many have their signs out. I have not seen one Biden sign.🇺🇸
That may be true, but the goal is to keep Biden from being elected. What do we do RIGHT NOW?!
You were the best senator and grilled everyone came in front of you. And you are going to be the best VP after you and Biden win
She's just Biden her time 'til November.
I think Biden-Harris are only "mandating" masks because they have to cover their badly botoxed/cosmetically altered faces until they look "human" again.
Harris-Biden are going to go down in flames 🔥 POTUS is ripping Biden a new one in his presser right now, for daring to assume that he can mandate ANYTHING... STFU #BunkerBoyBiden #HeelsUpHarris  Live coverage of the Harris-Biden campaign (Beavis &amp; Butthead - Save the Swamp)

What Joe Biden and that lady one state to make it mandatory to wear mask is taking your rights away once you take your rights away from that they’ll go after the other right they’ll be able to come in your home at any time they want
Joe Biden that lady can shut their mouth they don’t have the right to tell people what to do this is not a Third World country we we can do what we want we don’t have to wear a mask if we don’t want
Lol, the Dems are already getting rid of Biden?

I wonder where the enthusiasm is for Biden.
real unfortunate that a vote for anyone other than trump is a vote for biden :-/
Biden already released a statement trying to help take credit for it. Now that's hilarious.

friendly reminder that donald trump used to donate to democratic political campaigns. most notably hillary clinton, joe biden, and kamala harris 🙃
Joe Biden will be 78 in November.
During the primaries, Biden and Harris were probably my last 2 choices for who I wanted to get the nominations. I can’t say I’m a huge fan of the ticket. But you have to be delusional to still be able to turn a blind eye to all the garbage from the other side of the aisle.
Nah. This is a big deal:    This is a bigger deal:
What Trump is doing is wrong wrong wrong.  If mail in voting is made unsafe by this madman, I will crawl over broken glass and risk COVID to vote for Biden/Harris.  Trump will be a one term wrecking ball.
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris for VP | Sterling K. Brown #theDailyShowWithTrevorNoahEarsEdition   via
A presidential primary campaign and many hit pieces from leftist breitbart dot com later, and it’s seen as “the sky is falling” for progressives when Joe Biden picks Harris has his running mate
I think so also. Both of them have a personality or character flaw that's out to destroy. I remember Biden's debate with Paul Ryan. Biden was vicious &amp; I think Kamala will be like that also. They are the combination that, if elected, will bring down America. Voters remember this.
Pushing the left even farther away with your “suck it up” and vote for Biden/Harris strategy.
She did not make a threat, she made a statement that isn't too far fetched since Biden is very old &amp; fraile now &amp; can hardly put 2 sentences together.
Hmm ok these are bad policies to back, so I probably wouldn't be a fan of hers or Biden, but I'm going to vote for them this upcoming election so that we don't end up with Trump
Biden doesn't know where he is. I'd be embarrassed to defend him. #WheresHunter
I just want to see how the Liberals act to the critics that talk about Harris having descendants that owned slaves . Also about her accusing Biden being a sexual harasser &amp; now he’s the cats meow . If this was a conservative, the Libs would be marching &amp; crying .Tad hypocritical
We are going to have a Conservative majority in November. You sex workers should vote for Trump. Because under a socialist regime of Biden and Harris you will no longer be making money. You will have your financial assets seized by the government.
It will be funny when the Biden,Harris campaign talks about trump and his family donations to Kamala
Please can we all just agree to vote for Biden/Harris. Please. I don’t care if he’s not the perfect choice but really, he’s the better one. Get this fucking tangerine out of the spotlight.
I like Kamala.  Not my first choice, but I think she's phenomenal and I'm thrilled she's on the ticket with Biden. My only real concern is about her KHive.  Worse than Bros ever thought of being. And now they think they are the base?
It's amazing what four years of 45 on this platform have done for me. I'm not having any discussions, arguments, or "exchanges of opinion" anymore here. If you support 45, we have nothing to discuss. Want to take pot shots at Biden and Harris? Do it. Blocked.
So explain Biden today? What's that, you can't? Congrats on becoming a complete hack.
He is a known commodity. Obama remains the countries most popular President and Biden was a part of that.
What a disgusting Whiskey voiced hag.  Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back  via
Was watching Biden Harris.
On March 16, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made an unprecedented promise mid-debate: to choose a woman as his running mate, no matter what.    ☝️
And that’s the reason people like you . Cannot come into power . I predict you will leave Washington in a pine box . With that bobble head for Soros Biden and Obama. You will reap what you sew. Tread lightly
Did i say conservatives are good? I just don’t like socialists that weaponize race to their advantage. If you don’t vote for Biden you’re not black 👍🏼
Say trump and Biden are switched in this situation. What do you think people like you and liberal media’s would do with information. The DNC, hypocrisy at its finest.
Every woman I know who lives in the suburbs (it's not 1957, dude) thinks you are contemptible and is voting Biden/Harris.
Joe Biden and this lady are only going to screw our country up
Joe Biden and this lady don’t know what they’re talking about people need to open their eyes excuse me Black people are not the only people on this planet
Oh yeah Joe Biden and Obama stopped a bola
Dude this lady accused Joe Biden of being racist before?
Do people actually believe that Joe Biden will do anything for the United States he’ll do nothing but raise taxes trumps done more for us
Joe Biden says he’ll fix the country what it yeah race Texas defund the military take away your Second Amendment and then there goes your head remember right you people have to realize he is he is not going to be in control he’s just a puppet
I’d like to watch my news not Joe Biden he thinks people are crazy if they’re going to get rid of the Second amendment of people that allow Will not allow it
Joe Biden I could give you shit you don’t need no money need to go to an old folks home
I’d like to watch my News not see old man Biden on my TV screen I don’t like him go to an old folks home
Not voting for Joe Biden or you just screw the United States up
And I agree but a vote for Biden just because of him being “the lesser evil” isn’t going to make our country any better sure historically third parties don’t win but who says we can’t change that?
Our President Biden has never done anything like that.  Lies. We know this. So look to your tin god Trump.
Well Joe Biden becomes president there goes the world higher taxes higher food military lower military cuts and then will probably get taken over by another country
Man am I bummed Biden didn't pick Marianne Williamson.
Just read that Giuliani's daughter has endorsed Biden/Harris.
I have been in the resistance day one. I have Phone banked for months for Biden &amp; Democrats. I started a 501(c)(3) nonprofit called Vote Voiced to GOTV in MI. I am the Voter Engagement Chair of the Western Wayne County Branch of the NAACP in Michigan.  #Vote2020
Watching Joe Biden school Sarah Palin in 2002 was a historical high point in politics.  Pence vs Harries is going to be the pinnacle! Never have we seen 2 candidates so unevenly matched. I cannot wait to see Harris decimate Pence. I hope he cries.
Trump thinks that everyone who lives in the suburbs is as racist as he is.  He's wrong.  Trump Revives Racist Appeal To Suburbs After Biden Chooses Woman Of Color For VP  via
Trump lowkey not wrong about Biden I’d never vote for him even if I could vote 😭
She locked up more poor blacks on petty drug charges than almost any other prosecutor in the US. And who made that possible for her? Joe Biden.
It wasn't that long ago when the Democrats had 24 choices.  They voted for Biden.  Sanders and Williamson supporters now have three choices: Biden, Trump or throw away your vote.  Compare Biden to Trump and make your own decision.
maybe its because every democrat has run on reducing freedom of religion, and taking away at least some guns.  Biden and Kamala both have.
According to Trump, Biden will hurt God. So Biden is powerful.
You will raise taxes greatly and billionaires will leave and take their money with them. Sorry, Mr. Biden.
You have sat on your very large and prominent perdonker dunk and murdered 170,000 innocent Americans. Your inaction killed a lot of suburban mothers children and loved ones. These wonderful suburban women will vote for BIDEN/HARRIS to save this country from you.
Not surprised Biden picked Kamala Harris for VP, because before you fuck kids, you gotta lock their parents up. #BidenHarris2020 #SniffEmNFuckEm2020
THE #Democrat Party stood for racism long before Trump switched to the Republican Party and put AMERICA first.  While Biden still thinks China "isn't so bad". China is pulling for a Biden Inc. to win. Where's Hunter?
Lmao. And just like that the Biden Campaign gives up on a state with a population less than than the city of Detroit. And there goes a whopping 3 electoral votes. Lol.
And now the of rest  the story, China Joe will be unable or unwilling to mount a campaign. IF Biden INC won't debate, where will the #Democrat Party be? Harris campaign was at 2%, TWICE what Hunter's father's 1%. Economy MUST fail, schools CANT't open.  Or Trump will WIN WIN WIN!
God damn it, my dad is gonna ask me any day if "you SJWs are happy about Biden's VP pick"
Oh really. Cry me a river, knuckle draggers.
This picture of Biden always makes me think of the Martians from the movie "Mars Attacks"...
A sign of the times. Remote meetings. Glad to Biden is a Apple guy.
Instead of Trump Ag bribes that solve few problems, and are skewed to ag industrialization, let’s have a real plan to address the core problems that confront retaining the family farm.  Kamala Harris joining Biden ticket is a win for rural Iowa and farmers
I know yall want to hate but this is a winning pair. Biden/Harris let's go
Trump campaign tweets mugshots of alleged criminals, all of them Black, to claim Biden is pro-crime  via   Trump's entire staff is criminal and they are all walking free to include HIM
I mean she also called Biden a racist very recently if were gonna go fact digging around irrelevancies. Oh wait one deals with donations to an attorney general and the other deals with the fact that the newly appointed Democratic VP candidate called her running partner a racist.
But that same woman called Biden a racist as well 🤔 interesting
a RW hold on the SCOTUS for a generation if RBG retires, corporate control on policy, increased income inequality, loss of 1st am rights &amp; police reform are on the ballot not just Biden&amp; Trump. Purity tests &amp; disillusion arent justification enough to risk the suffering 45 causes.
So 2020 election is boutta be Joe Biden/ Kamala Harris or Trump/Pence,,,-
"Joe Biden is a racist!" - Kamala Harris
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
So if voting independent is a vote for Trump or a vote for Biden, then why vote independent at all? They don't want you to cause its easier to divide, control, and conquer when it's two.
At this point, he would simply look like a copycat.  Still, I always thought he would if Biden did, so maybe.
i hate that biden and harris and trump and pence are our only god damn options i hate america
I guess this will help Biden carry California! 🙄
He already has.
I want this for Biden’s cabinet. Cuz I feel like the monstars can also be rehabilitated at this time, as well.
Biden campaign statement/announcement on VP pick
Trump campaign &amp; RNC statements on Biden’s VP pick, Sen. Kamala Harris:
is rattled.    President Trump blasts Biden’s VP pick, Kamala Harris, as 'meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful' senator
Keep in mind everyone that during the biggest racial uprising since the late 60’s, the  is going with the Author of the crime bill in Joe Biden which unjustly targeted and incarcerated vast numbers of minorities in this country.   And...
Those who will still not find relief in a Biden/Harris administration.
please. i don’t care how you feel about biden or kamala harris. PLEASE don’t vote third party. get trump out of office
Biden and Harris
Agreed. That being true, I would vote for her over Trump or Biden in a heartbeat.
She isn’t my first choice. Neither is Biden.   But I do respect her &amp; believe she will make a great leader, when it comes to that.  Also, she’s 55, so if she does a great job &amp; earns our votes, she might provide a steady &amp; capable presence in DC for the next 12 years.
I saw your grandson Owen at the local pitch  n’ putt. Was upset to see the Apple had fallen far from the tree. He wore a shirt that said ByeDon! Libtard can’t even spell Biden!
Plus I heard.  ( not sure if it's true or not yet.) Biden said a while back, "He needed a vice president that can take charge an control. When he quits 6 months after being elected."
If Joe Biden becomes president we have to look for higher taxes business is shutting down the virus is spreading more higher cost-of-living going up in peoples paycheck not going up he is Do not elect him as president
Is Joe Biden choosing a black woman to Con Black people down?
While I would have preferred Elizabeth Warren as VP, I respectfully disagree with your assessment. I think independents and Never Trumpers are more than fine with Harris. If a conservative academic still prefers Trump over Biden/Harris IMO they were a lost cause to begin with.
If people actually believe these commercials that are run by Joe Biden blaming the president Donald Trump for everything they’re not using common sense
You just don’t like trump Joe Biden is too old
Oh good Joe Biden has someone to change his diaper
Trump has done more for the United States than any other president has in the past Joe Biden How we need to diaper change every four minutes?
Trump has done more for the United States than any other president has in the past Joe Biden How we need to diaper change every four minutes
Should we make a Biden Bear?  One with a heart?
The Kamala Harris VP pick will make liberal suburban wine moms happy but is probably the nail in the coffin for a widespread progressive vote.
At this point "can they speak coherent sentences" is the bar. I don't think Biden/Harris is perfect, but it's fine for now (I would've preferred Warren).   Also, glad he didn't pick Whitmer b/c we need her to stick around Michigan.
welp, there it is. I’m in for the Biden/Harris and I’m not happy about it
I’m a white woman and am so thrilled with Biden’s VP pic. I can only imagine how black women must feel right now. Wow! What a moment.
joe biden and kamala harris the duo we never asked for but will settle
Awww poor Stretchin’ Gretchen!  Well shit, I’m not voting for Biden, I’ll tell u that right now. No way am I changing Kamala Harris becoming president.

In all seriousness VP picks kinda dont matter (except Palin) and if you were hesitant to vote for Biden based on his VP pick you were looking for an out so you could vote for Trump #facts #BidenHarris2020
#BREAKING The Vice President spot on the democratic ticket will be  she is  pick.
Chills and tears! Yes! Go Team Biden!
I’m in for Biden-Harris. #BidenHarris2020
Biden Harris 2020 officially. Great choice
Biden supporters don’t give a shit about what offends Trump.
Joe Biden just picked Steve Harvey as his VP. Oh wait that’s wrong #VPPick
“It got so bad Joe Biden went on a bike ride the other day with a mask on” ignored the reporter that was so close to him Biden had to ride around him! And that he was riding in a group and SS detail must stay within 6 feet to protect him. So yes Biden was appropriate to wear one!
TEXT OU812 to find out FIRST who is DEFINITELY MAYBE going to be Biden's VP
Love Biden the way I love Obama!  I will fight for him all the way!
Love Biden!  💙💙💙
Seeing that there are more Women voters than Men I would say this is just another colossally stupid statement. Mentioning Race is just typical racist trump.  Trump claims ‘men are insulted’ because Biden might pick a Black woman vice president
Money older than joe biden
I would love a Biden/Harris ticket!
Distraction, not that it matters... There is NO ONE on planet Earth that Biden can choose as his "V.P." that would cause him to LEGITIMATELY win the Presidency.
Did you see the info babe's eyes lift when she said the Chinese want Joe Biden?
I doubt Biden even knows who Kamala is or what it means that she "unfollowed" him... Guess he didn't like the way she "smells"?🤣😂🤣
My God, Politco really is putting hit pieces on every VP candidate aren't they. None of the main contenders, especially not Kamala or Whitmer would cost Biden any state. It's crazy to say and think that would happen. People vote for the nominee, not the running mate.
It's very possible this isn't related to Biden, but if it is, I have no idea what this means. Maybe a speech together? Maybe Cabinet meetings. Maybe recording something for the Convention? South Bend is also really close to Michigan, so maybe it's not even Pete.  No idea.
They won't announce the VP until after they announce Biden's replacement!
According to who?
Maybe Joe Biden will use the Toimb of the Unknown Soldier.    I am not serious but can you imagine the backlash that would  happen?
Also, in case you haven't noticed, Bernie is working with Biden.
I think it's important for this country to survive and that only happens if Trump is not in control of this country.  Frankly if you think Trump and Biden are the same, you are WAY not paying attention.  Biden earned votes. Obviously Bernie didn't, or he'd be the nominee.
Boo hoo. Where has Bernie been during the BLM protests?  Kamala has been out there protesting, and working her ass off.  For her record, the receipts have been brought time and again to prove stories on her are wrong. I'm voting Biden no matter who is VP is. Can you say the same?
I seen the fist Biden sign near me and it’s a big banner I was shocked to see next time I drive past I’ll get a picture
It doesn't matter who they chose for VP, Biden and the demoncrats are going to lose... They've awakened more people to the truth (not their intention, I'm sure) than we could have ever done in so short a time.  They're screwed, and they KNOW it!
This is the only part of their base that has any energy to it. They need it, because Biden is doing nothing for any of them. Everytime Biden talks, Trump gains voters back. This is all they got.
All Lies  nice try and keep watching CNN and other networks that just bush the Liberal agenda.  Biden = Communism!!!  The True Russia hoax.
is / was an  advisor to Joe Biden for the debates.
Biden is also for cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
You just feel stupid because Biden's actually saying racist crap. We don't have to spin it.
Who tf is confident in Biden lol
Well this is where you lose me as your fan. You will lose your ability to make money under a Joe Biden dictatorship. Trump is the one that can save America as we know it . Let me say this any openly lefty Trans will not be supported by me. I rather not know your politics.
I wouldn't mind you following me, you being a  Wrestling fan. Had you not openly declared yourself for Biden and against Trump. Such stupidity by someone following my account will not be tolerated without a rebuttal. So consider yourself rebutted. Have a nice day.
Your  hero  Barack Obama (who's the actual heel along with Biden and virtually the entire Democratic Party) you want to use wresting terminology for this current e? Then Trump &amp; his supporters are the Faces, the heroes.
Biden is such an ass even his campaign ads he talks about doing everything that Trump has already done you mean to tell me people watching the ads don’t know that?
According to Biden, 150 million of us have died from gun violence, and 120 million have died from COVID...  So, there should only be 60 million of us left? 🤔😬
And there's this...  Nancy says "China would prefer Joe Biden"
Since the Trump campaign is endlessly running the ad where Mr. Biden says something stupid, will this recording come up during the race? During the debates?  Trump On Tape: I Grab Women "By The Pu**y”  via
All the more reason we don't want nor need Joe Biden.
Amy I don't care who he picks. What I want is for everyone to stand and vote for Biden no matter who he picks. Cable news will dissect her to death. Ugh!
Oxygen? Here’s Joe Biden riding a bike...when was the last time Trump’s fat ass got on a bike?
These EO's are dead on arrival on Monday. But here's a thought for the brainless Magat's. For laughs let's say this walking colostomy bag gets away with this. When Jan 20th comes Biden by EO can erase the Cap on SS. Repeal all of trumps tax law. Make space force disappear..
We know that. Milano is a Biden supporter. What do you expect.
Awww.. poor dear.  Did someone ruffle Trump’s reputation?  Deservedly so..  Kanye has admitted that it’s only to pull votes for Biden, so...
JOE BIDEN SHOULD PICK WHO HE WANTS🗣
I'm sure Biden will not have any boat parades.
Biden supports basically none of the policies that Sanders supports and from the bottom up any dumb fucking asshole who insists otherwise knows nothing about them beyond their name and listed party. Just sad that one of those fucks is the president...
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
I hope she can. Because quite frankly under Biden and his  minions we will all have less freedom to do just about anything including you  Arielle Scarcella. My one hope is that you vote for Trump in November and save America as you know it. Because  the new America would be scary
Madam Speaker, why are the 2 Rep's that are helping Putin funnel negative propaganda about Biden still allowed to serve on the senate?  When are you all gonna hold Trump and his gang accountable for their treasonous acts, and not to mention the Kanye fiasco....Enough us enough!!
Calling it, by fall, there will be a real effort by the trump campaign to pull "youth support" away from Biden.
I believe what we see happening at the hands of Repubs is by design...a long game with big money and foreign power behind it.  If Biden wins and Dems hold the House and take the Senate, they will find a smoldering pile of ash left by Repubs because that's how they play.
Michigan republicans would vote for Biden to get Whitmer out of Michigan
I thought you asked why Biden was excommunicated.
Biden literally said roe v wade went too far
Biden? Church?  I’m pretty sure he was excommunicated a while ago.
Maybe Joe Biden should pick who he’d want to be his Vice President and tell everyone who disagrees to fuck off
Cheats  Analysis | Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’
😂  Future President Joe Biden will be elected.  He will take you out behind the woodshed &amp; make sure you are prosecuted   He’ll help set up a framework for fixing what you’ve broken  Then he’ll step aside &amp; we’ll have compassionate, intelligent leadership for the next 11 yrs 🇺🇸
Look, Joe Biden isn't racist. It's just his words, thoughts, actions and friends who are racist.
Trump claims Biden 'insulted the Black community' with remarks on Hispanic diversity  via   remind me again how many black people did Joe Biden try to stop from renting or buying properties in his building?
Trump claims Biden 'insulted the Black community' with remarks on Hispanic diversity  via   Trump should be called Mr. President Racist pig!
Really????? You mean to say that the  ONLY difference between Trump and Biden that matters to you is who Biden picks as his VP?  Sheesh.
Posted an anti-Trump thought tonight. Had someone "enlighten" me that Joe Biden is being controlled by Satanists and pedophiles who want to undo Trump's help for Christians.   I respectfully disagreed. I was then told I was "beguiled by the devil."   So, how was your day?
Unless you’re part of the ruling class, the American government doesn’t care about you.  Joe Biden isn’t going to change this. Donald Trump isn’t going to change this. American electoralism as it stands isn’t going to change this.
I tend to agree for the most part, but I don't care that Biden is "old" so long as he is a democrat he has my vote and any other "D" I can vote for.  We have to get Trump and as many Republicans out in order to undo this nightmare.
People are irate because it shouldn’t matter who Biden picks as VP. A decent person can look at the two choices that we have - Trump or Biden - and choose Biden without hesitation, no matter what. Because Trump is NEVER an acceptable choice.
Only this sweaty orange man can stop Biden from hurting God.
Your in denial of reality. Biden's on a sinking ship , the Titanic.
Biden had one job until the election: stay inside and shut up
Oh thank goodness! Thanks, Pastor Dave for setting my mind at ease. I will sleep soundly tonight for sure. I sure hope Biden doesn't get elected, because poor god will be defenseless if we don't have guns to protect him with. #sarcasm
Our God is a puny god who can be hurt by Biden....is that how that song goes.
Biden is either very powerful or God is a puny god.
If Biden can hurt God, than God is weak or Biden is poweful like Yoda or Gandalf.
Sadly, I wasn't following  so I wasn't able to unfollow her for saying such a selfish, stupid, and soul-killing thing.  I'm with you.  Biden can choose my not-housebroken dog for VP and he's still got my vote.
"Uhh... did Joe Biden just say that Black people are all the same". No, he said there were "notable exceptions".
She actually made a very good point. If Biden picks Harris then he will not lose any progressive voters but if he picks Rice he may loses some conservative voters.
He’s campaigning in Cleveland. Implicating Biden in his falsehoods. And can’t even correctly pronounce Thailand. Thigh land!!
Trump is obviously referring to Biden's training with Hattori Hanzo.
I don't know about the God thing... but Biden sure does want to take away some guns, and has made a big push for the green new deal... which would put 10's of thousands out of a job.  you know that though, but your job makes you a professional liar.lol yeah the #resist in your bio along with several blue wave emoji, a Joe Biden/Kamala header, &amp; profile full of Dem tweets didn’t give it away. You’re an absolute joke 😂 peace
Biden actually did help right the 1994 crime bill. It’s a valid critique. But at least he now acknowledges the issues of the justice system unlike who we have now. So his statement is bull.
Historically vice president were opposites to their president. Really thats all she needs to say of she wants to keep the narrative that there is really any substantial difference between her and biden, or between them and Republicans for that matter. They're the same. Viels off.
Asking Palestinians to pick between Trump and Biden is not asking us to pick the “lesser of two evils.”  It’s asking us to pick the lesser of two abusers.  #Palestine #FreePalestine
Ignore him.  He’s trying to steal attention away from Biden &amp; Harris.
I'm pressuring Joe Biden to support liberal policies by attacking anyone who criticizes or pressures Joe Biden into supporting liberal policies.
Biden praises the Israel-UAE normalization agreement. He even tries to take credit for it.  Raise your hand if you’re surprised.  #Palestine #FreePalestine
Much needed change when Biden and Harris win  the ticket. And there is no longer the likes of people like you wandering the peoples White House halls any more.
I agree with you!  POTUS will win big. I am one of the silent majority but I am building up the courage to put my TRUMP/PENCE sign in my front yard. Just on my street in my small town so many have their signs out. I have not seen one Biden sign.🇺🇸
You were the best senator and grilled everyone came in front of you. And you are going to be the best VP after you and Biden win
She's just Biden her time 'til November.
Lol, the Dems are already getting rid of Biden?
President? So you know that Biden is a place holder???
Ask her about how she thought Biden was a creep, you know before she was selected to run with him
you say the right is racist and sexist then look at who you picked for your vp. it is based on race and sex. do you think they looked into anything else? Biden’s top 5 choices were all women and 4 of them were black. Who is the sexist and racist now?
I wonder where the enthusiasm is for Biden.
real unfortunate that a vote for anyone other than trump is a vote for biden :-/
What a big difference between these two men. Trump needs a walker to walk. While Biden is cruising around town on his bike
friendly reminder that donald trump used to donate to democratic political campaigns. most notably hillary clinton, joe biden, and kamala harris 🙃
Joe Biden will be 78 in November.
Make them viable during the midterm and primaries. Voting for them now is wasting a vote and giving Trump the win. Biden and Kamela would be the better option of the only two we actually have.
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris for VP | Sterling K. Brown #theDailyShowWithTrevorNoahEarsEdition   via
A presidential primary campaign and many hit pieces from leftist breitbart dot com later, and it’s seen as “the sky is falling” for progressives when Joe Biden picks Harris has his running mate
Pushing the left even farther away with your “suck it up” and vote for Biden/Harris strategy.
Yeah its gonna be a daily reminder to vote for Biden and his hairy legs
Hmm ok these are bad policies to back, so I probably wouldn't be a fan of hers or Biden, but I'm going to vote for them this upcoming election so that we don't end up with Trump
Biden doesn't know where he is. I'd be embarrassed to defend him. #WheresHunter
I just want to see how the Liberals act to the critics that talk about Harris having descendants that owned slaves . Also about her accusing Biden being a sexual harasser &amp; now he’s the cats meow . If this was a conservative, the Libs would be marching &amp; crying .Tad hypocritical
We are going to have a Conservative majority in November. You sex workers should vote for Trump. Because under a socialist regime of Biden and Harris you will no longer be making money. You will have your financial assets seized by the government.
It will be funny when the Biden,Harris campaign talks about trump and his family donations to Kamala
Please can we all just agree to vote for Biden/Harris. Please. I don’t care if he’s not the perfect choice but really, he’s the better one. Get this fucking tangerine out of the spotlight.
Trump would wreck everyone on the bus coming from our away games in high-school. Ya Wlad ya Wlad. Shu!! Tuhkoosh ma3 biden. Why??? Cuz he sniffs girls hair in third hour. Lmaoo
He is a known commodity. Obama remains the countries most popular President and Biden was a part of that.
Then you’re not voting Biden lol
Did i say conservatives are good? I just don’t like socialists that weaponize race to their advantage. If you don’t vote for Biden you’re not black 👍🏼
Say trump and Biden are switched in this situation. What do you think people like you and liberal media’s would do with information. The DNC, hypocrisy at its finest.
Every woman I know who lives in the suburbs (it's not 1957, dude) thinks you are contemptible and is voting Biden/Harris.
Our President Biden has never done anything like that.  Lies. We know this. So look to your tin god Trump.
Man am I bummed Biden didn't pick Marianne Williamson.
I have been in the resistance day one. I have Phone banked for months for Biden &amp; Democrats. I started a 501(c)(3) nonprofit called Vote Voiced to GOTV in MI. I am the Voter Engagement Chair of the Western Wayne County Branch of the NAACP in Michigan.  #Vote2020
Watching Joe Biden school Sarah Palin in 2002 was a historical high point in politics.  Pence vs Harries is going to be the pinnacle! Never have we seen 2 candidates so unevenly matched. I cannot wait to see Harris decimate Pence. I hope he cries.
As  picks  for VP,  Issues Stark Warning #civility #KamalaHarris
Trump lowkey not wrong about Biden I’d never vote for him even if I could vote 😭
maybe its because every democrat has run on reducing freedom of religion, and taking away at least some guns.  Biden and Kamala both have.
According to Trump, Biden will hurt God. So Biden is powerful.
It’s got to be a coordinated thing; it happened so suddenly. Can’t believe it was to overshadow Biden’s VP pick, but it was definitely on purpose.
THE #Democrat Party stood for racism long before Trump switched to the Republican Party and put AMERICA first.  While Biden still thinks China "isn't so bad". China is pulling for a Biden Inc. to win. Where's Hunter?
And now the of rest  the story, China Joe will be unable or unwilling to mount a campaign. IF Biden INC won't debate, where will the #Democrat Party be? Harris campaign was at 2%, TWICE what Hunter's father's 1%. Economy MUST fail, schools CANT't open.  Or Trump will WIN WIN WIN!
Vote for America!  Vote for Liberty for all! Vote Trump 2020 and John James 2020!  We need people who love OUR Country! Trump does not take one dime from this country and he has only been in office for 3 years!  The Biden group have been around for 45 years...look at the mess!
I mean she also called Biden a racist very recently if were gonna go fact digging around irrelevancies. Oh wait one deals with donations to an attorney general and the other deals with the fact that the newly appointed Democratic VP candidate called her running partner a racist.
But that same woman called Biden a racist as well 🤔 interesting
I want at least that. Biden isn’t as right wing as Trump and certainly not as impulsive.
So get four more years of Trump then? If you can’t have it 100% your way, you’d prefer total defeat? That’s childish.  I dislike Biden. He’s creepy. He’s corrupt. Likely not sincere. Now take those qualities, shift them even farther right, and you get Trump. That’s worse.
Well, we *had* other options.  They’re not available anymore. Not for THIS election cycle.  Biden, even if only barely, is better than Trump. The least we can do is vote for the lesser evil and try harder to support truly progressive candidates. Maybe Yang can win in 2024.
So if voting independent is a vote for Trump or a vote for Biden, then why vote independent at all? They don't want you to cause its easier to divide, control, and conquer when it's two.
When she ran for Senate she did a lot of things to build her name up. Now just a couple years later she is going against everything she stood for in order to sell her souls to the devil aka Joe Biden
Progressives: I feel you. Biden wasn’t in my top 5 for the presidential primary. Your jaded feelings are valid, but don’t lose the hope.  We have two allies in  &amp;  They can only pull off big upsets if they get Bernie-level fundraising. Follow &amp; donate!
i hate that biden and harris and trump and pence are our only god damn options i hate america
We cannot take anything about this race for granted, and I look forward to turning out the 12th district and all of Michigan for Vice President Biden and Senator Harris in November, to protect our country and democracy.
I want this for Biden’s cabinet. Cuz I feel like the monstars can also be rehabilitated at this time, as well.
please. i don’t care how you feel about biden or kamala harris. PLEASE don’t vote third party. get trump out of office
"A vOtE FoR SoMeOne OtHEr ThAn BiDeN iS a VoTe FoR tRuMp"
Biden’s like “ACAB? All cops are the best?? Okay! Sign me up!”
Biden and Harris
I saw your grandson Owen at the local pitch  n’ putt. Was upset to see the Apple had fallen far from the tree. He wore a shirt that said ByeDon! Libtard can’t even spell Biden!
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
While I would have preferred Elizabeth Warren as VP, I respectfully disagree with your assessment. I think independents and Never Trumpers are more than fine with Harris. If a conservative academic still prefers Trump over Biden/Harris IMO they were a lost cause to begin with.
Oh wait it does Joe Biden said he would only pick a African American Lady! Hypocrite!
Should we make a Biden Bear?  One with a heart?
At this point "can they speak coherent sentences" is the bar. I don't think Biden/Harris is perfect, but it's fine for now (I would've preferred Warren).   Also, glad he didn't pick Whitmer b/c we need her to stick around Michigan.
welp, there it is. I’m in for the Biden/Harris and I’m not happy about it
joe biden and kamala harris the duo we never asked for but will settle
Can I just vote for Biden/Harris now please?
Great choice Joe! Biden/Harris 2020
Whitmer.will be offered a cabinet job if Biden wins
Before that you will see Biden is smashed by Trump
#BREAKING The Vice President spot on the democratic ticket will be  she is  pick.
Biden just announced Kamala Harris is his running mate!!
I’m in for Biden-Harris. #BidenHarris2020
Biden Harris 2020 officially. Great choice
Biden camp is running a remarkably tight ship
Biden supporters don’t give a shit about what offends Trump.
TEXT OU812 to find out FIRST who is DEFINITELY MAYBE going to be Biden's VP
Need one similar which says,  "Real Atheists  For Biden".
Money older than joe biden
if KHarris didnt go on a debate stage and openly call Joe Biden racist to his face IN TEARS a bit ago then this VP pick would have been made a month ago and those two would be looking good   now he makes that pick and trump has boat loads of ads against them lol
If you haven’t read the green new deal then you shouldn’t vote  If you haven’t seen any debates yet you shouldn’t vote  If you haven’t seen any appearances from Biden/trump tht you watched to entirety you shouldn’t vote  If you haven’t looked into who funds him then don’t vote
I would love a Biden/Harris ticket!
Did you see the info babe's eyes lift when she said the Chinese want Joe Biden?
nope Biden claimed it first  when he became vp
Biden is the king of stupidity
that’s very true. I have seen it too. but Biden should not be running because he just insults people during his interviews.
if Biden is soooo smart, then why is everyone trying to make him avoid debates with him. Because he can’t make a single coherent sentence.
Dear me, at least he is talking in sentences.  Joe Biden has can't even say words on the first or second time.
You know I am done with you. If you choose to be idiotic that is on you. but if Biden gets voted in (God for in that ever happens) then just watch all the bad decisions that he makes and how the country will be in complete ruin.
Biden = communism = USSR (remake)
and that will happen under Biden.
and what do you think Biden would have done better?
Or whoever the Democrats might pick as Biden's replacement.
My God, Politco really is putting hit pieces on every VP candidate aren't they. None of the main contenders, especially not Kamala or Whitmer would cost Biden any state. It's crazy to say and think that would happen. People vote for the nominee, not the running mate.
They won't announce the VP until after they announce Biden's replacement!
According to who?
and why would i believe Biden. Who doesn’t know what he is saying half the time.
Maybe Joe Biden will use the Toimb of the Unknown Soldier.    I am not serious but can you imagine the backlash that would  happen?
Also, in case you haven't noticed, Bernie is working with Biden.
I think it's important for this country to survive and that only happens if Trump is not in control of this country.  Frankly if you think Trump and Biden are the same, you are WAY not paying attention.  Biden earned votes. Obviously Bernie didn't, or he'd be the nominee.
You might want to come up with a new come back “you moron”. It’s getting old already. I don’t think Biden is much better.
Rice, though never elected to anything, is a foreign policy expert with a very close personal relationship to Biden. Whitmer has been a governor for less than two years, with no federal government experience.  But she's white. And to Biden, that's the winning ticket. (10/10)
Whitmer's selection also has the added bonus of delivering Michigan's first Black governor if Biden is elected, as our lieutenant governor is Garlin Gilchrist, a Black man. (8/10)
I wouldn't be surprised if Biden is making the following calculations:  "Black people will largely come out and vote for me no matter what because they're scared of Trump. Progressives will come out because they're scared of Trump... (5/10)
They are all for workers' rights and so on. But they are not joining the protests in the streets. In fact, they are made fairly uncomfortable by most talk about race and racism, as it seems Biden often is. (4/10)
These moderate (white) voters would be okay with a woman being one heartbeat away from the presidency. But not a Black woman. Especially in the age of Black Lives Matter.   I grew up in Delaware and Pennsylvania. I lived with the kind of white moderate Democrat Biden is. (3/10)
My prediction: Joe Biden will select Gretchen Whitmer as his VP candidate.  Why? Because she's white.  Biden's whole theory from the jump of the campaign has been to flip moderate (white) Midwestern voters who voted for Trump in 2016, narrowly giving him the White House. (1/10)
Boo hoo. Where has Bernie been during the BLM protests?  Kamala has been out there protesting, and working her ass off.  For her record, the receipts have been brought time and again to prove stories on her are wrong. I'm voting Biden no matter who is VP is. Can you say the same?
I seen the fist Biden sign near me and it’s a big banner I was shocked to see next time I drive past I’ll get a picture

You just feel stupid because Biden's actually saying racist crap. We don't have to spin it.
To stop the American people’s time from being further wasted on unproven rumors, could the media possibly attempt to not imply or claim either candidate is under foreign control without any evidence? #US #politics
Honestly, instead of Trump, it should be Biden.
Who tf is confident in Biden lol
Well this is where you lose me as your fan. You will lose your ability to make money under a Joe Biden dictatorship. Trump is the one that can save America as we know it . Let me say this any openly lefty Trans will not be supported by me. I rather not know your politics.
I wouldn't mind you following me, you being a  Wrestling fan. Had you not openly declared yourself for Biden and against Trump. Such stupidity by someone following my account will not be tolerated without a rebuttal. So consider yourself rebutted. Have a nice day.

Biden is such an ass even his campaign ads he talks about doing everything that Trump has already done you mean to tell me people watching the ads don’t know that?
All the more reason we don't want nor need Joe Biden.
This is why this pandemic will never be over in the USA. Hopefully when Biden takes over in January he'll lock the country down for a month and have a mask mandate.
Amy I don't care who he picks. What I want is for everyone to stand and vote for Biden no matter who he picks. Cable news will dissect her to death. Ugh!
I think the student loan freeze, eviction moratorium extension, and 400 dollars unemployment bonus is relevant as well. As someone who shall not likely be voting for Trump or Biden I can appreciate when either campaign makes a clearly good move, because it is so rare.
If Biden knows how to run the country why didn't he tell Obama?
We know that. Milano is a Biden supporter. What do you expect.
JOE BIDEN SHOULD PICK WHO HE WANTS🗣
!!! Joe Biden names TOAD TOADSWORTH as his running mate after long running VP speculation  “YHELLO,” says Toad, clocking in at a mighty 6’7”
Actually i think biden is just a senile corporate front man
Biden supports basically none of the policies that Sanders supports and from the bottom up any dumb fucking asshole who insists otherwise knows nothing about them beyond their name and listed party. Just sad that one of those fucks is the president...
Biden: “can you get me Minnesota” BG: “... Sir it’s Michigan” Biden: “you passed my first test”
Can we simply decide the winner of this election by having President Biden race aginst Trump on bicycles?  Can Trump even ride a bicycle?
I hope she can. Because quite frankly under Biden and his  minions we will all have less freedom to do just about anything including you  Arielle Scarcella. My one hope is that you vote for Trump in November and save America as you know it. Because  the new America would be scary
That’s fine dude. Biden will do the right thing in January.
Joe Biden, too easy
I thought you asked why Biden was excommunicated.
Biden? Church?  I’m pretty sure he was excommunicated a while ago.
And don't be surprised after Biden announces his female VP that the orange traitor dumps Pence and adds Nicki Haley to his ticket. Desperate!
Burn that garbage, Trump is going down November 3rd...Biden 2020 MFers 🤣

I tend to agree for the most part, but I don't care that Biden is "old" so long as he is a democrat he has my vote and any other "D" I can vote for.  We have to get Trump and as many Republicans out in order to undo this nightmare.

Someone who knows the fine art of projection. You can tell when he goes off script. It’s patriotic to wear a mask. It may be great, it may be good, it may be not so good. Covering all the bases. 🙄😂😷😂🙄
I guess they think we cannot remember (or find) these things... Hey! Whoever is sending Biden's tweets... Please let him know that the internet is forever!
What benefit is it to him to go on a Sunday talk show.  The crazy ass clown show he is running against commits suicide daily at press conferences &amp; refuses to take the measures to slow down the crisis that’s been swirling around him since March... Biden keeps gaining in polls.
So you complain about Harriet handling us off, but you say trump and Biden are supposed to restore the black community?...ok.

It's just not so thinly veiled racism to erase black voters who picked Biden.
I bought the Impolite Arrogant Women shirt from Warren's campaign. If Biden/Harris offered a line of shirts with quotes like this, I'd purchase every last one.
Joe Biden talking about requiring masks outdoors for the next 3 months:  "It's not about your rights"  Yeah, we know that, Joe.  Leftists don't believe in human rights.  Our prediction?  Every leftist governor will start following whatever Harris/Biden recommend immediately.
My questions...  Will Republicans push for Kanye to be included in the Presidential debates?  Should Biden?  (might be illuminating)
Also that’s taking votes away from Biden too, Biden needs all the votes to get Trump out of office. Every vote counts in this election
Trump recently said that Sen Biden insulted all men by picking a woman running mate. Not that Trump has ever worried about hypocrisy, but that’s a hard one to ignore.
When will Trump challenge Heels up Harris to take a DNA?  How will that play out considering that Biden was suppose to pick "the first BLACK FEMALE?
The Clintons are central to a pustule of corruption. Bill in the White House, Hillary in the senate and in Obama’s cabinet, the Clinton foundation. They’ve sucked in Pelosi, Schumer, Schiff, Nader, RINOs, Obama, Biden and Harris, et al. It’s a cancer in our government.
I know if my grandpa was still alive today he would be voting for Biden instead of Trump. He voted straight red his whole life and hated Trump before he died. The last thing he said about Trump was “He’s a cocksucker”
I think Biden-Harris are only "mandating" masks because they have to cover their badly botoxed/cosmetically altered faces until they look "human" again.
Tax reductions seem unlikely given the enormous fiscal response to the Covid-19 business disruptions. Biden’s tax plan offers a glimpse of what we may be facing in 2021 and beyond.

And you'll be dead right about the post-election analysis if Biden and Kamala fail to defeat Trump.
I like Kamala.  Not my first choice, but I think she's phenomenal and I'm thrilled she's on the ticket with Biden. My only real concern is about her KHive.  Worse than Bros ever thought of being. And now they think they are the base?
It's amazing what four years of 45 on this platform have done for me. I'm not having any discussions, arguments, or "exchanges of opinion" anymore here. If you support 45, we have nothing to discuss. Want to take pot shots at Biden and Harris? Do it. Blocked.
In my trip to the #Michigan Upper Peninsula last week I counted election signs for fun while driving. Well... #Trump 32  #Biden 5 I also started counting Family Dollar and Dollar General stores...but lost count of them, too many!  Coincidence?
Team Biden/Harris 2020!
I wondered how Kamala Harris felt about being chosen as Joe Biden’s running mate based solely on her gender (1 of only 2) and the color of her skin, rather than her achievements and the possibility of being POTUS (which is not legally possible). Apparently, she’s elated.

Biden has a solid plan on what he wants to do for healthcare actually. I really suggest you look it up on his website. It’s goes into the details pretty good with what he wants to accomplish.

Again, my sense from personal experience is that the power elite are cosmic eff-ups, that can't walk and chew gum, think Biden before memory-ward fodder. Parasites function solely by virtue of the (Randian) sanction of the victim ("men of the mind"). Think tapeworm beating chest.
The difference is when ppl are still dying under biden/harris you wont give a shit anymore

If Biden can get passed it, we can as well. They are working together to govern.
I don’t think so.  If Trump loses and refuses to leave, on Jan. 20 he becomes a trespasser in the WH and de facto threat to Pres Biden. The Secret Service would have ample resources to restrain and remove him.  stay safe
It’s gonna be Biden is really a black Muslim who wants to hurt God and the Bible...  but Harris isn’t really black.
How Biden decided on Harris  SERIOUSLY,  MSN WENT WITH THAT HEADLINE?
I agree to a point, although Biden has said some very questionable things in the past and he’s also a creep towards women as well. I don’t want to willingly send my vote to either of them if I’m being honest, but 🤷🏾‍♂️
Wouldn’t be that way if more people realized that Biden and Trump aren’t the only two people on the ballot.

It did, tho. She made leftism palatable. The number one critique of progressive policies, like it or not, is that it’s ‘not pragmatic’. Her framing - the ‘plan’ narrative - changed that.  And now it’s in Biden’s platform. BIDEN, of all people. That’s a HUGE win for the left
It’s called I’ll show you Trump. Has nothing to do with working together. Just like Harris calls Biden a racist then accepts his offer to be VP. ALL HYPOCRITES

Well any of the list were horrible candidates, all would bring Biden down. But of the list Kamala is maybe the least offensive... IMO. She helps suggest a possibility of law and order. She is a senator, so some legislative experience. But probably bad for attracting minority vote
Considering I have no faith that Biden could last 4 years, I am opposed to voting for ‘president Kamala Harris’
Her staying in helped Sanders more than it helped Biden. When Buttigeig / Harris / etc dropped out, their vote was going to (1) Biden or (2) Warren.  The left consolidated around Sanders. Warren staying in spoiled the moderate vote more than the Sanders vote.
Take a solid look at Biden’s platform, and how many of her plans made it in. He’s got the most progressive platform of any modern presidential nominee.   She didn’t get anything for herself, but she got more for the left than any modern pol but Sanders. The hate for her is crazy.
I stand with the team!  ...  Let's win it together!

Kamala Harris is selected as Joe Biden’s running mate!  This photo was taken when Harris was the keynote speaker at the NAACP Freedom Fund Dinner in 2019.
So excited that Biden has selected  to be his running mate.  Let’s get this done!
Democrat voters aren't voting for Joe Biden - they're voting for a list of "influencers" who'll be controlling what amounts to be a sock puppet.  Also - that stock background photo was from the 2012 Republican National Convention.  You can't make this stuff up, folks.
That’s a great ticket! Thank you President Biden.
1) Insufficient base turnout in MI,PA, &amp; WI beat Hillary 2) Benghazi won't trump Covid 3) Dems and Indies are so fired up that VP pick matters little re:turnout. Covid, bad economy, and Trump will drive turnout on both sides. That's why Biden will win. Keep riding that bike Joe!
In all seriousness VP picks kinda dont matter (except Palin) and if you were hesitant to vote for Biden based on his VP pick you were looking for an out so you could vote for Trump #facts #BidenHarris2020

How is it laughable? I am not trying to defend Trump, but Biden has a history of being terrible to women. This is just one of the most recent examples.
Had a nightmare Biden picked a white man as his VP and oh man. 2020 nightmares are a different breed.
You are heavily overestimating the intelligence of Biden’s team.

You do realize Joe Biden isn’t a socialist right. You’re mistaken for Bernie 😂😂😂
Based on the convention’s line-up, reason makes me believe  that these people will not be Biden’s pick. What do you think? #BidenVP
I have a question for all the republicans who are voting for Joe. Are you just voting for Biden and for the rest of your ballot voting for Republicans or straight Democrat? Just curious not going to criticize I’m just curious that’s all.
Agree, but look at Biden, build back better. Similar message, without the seat of your pants diplomacy. American manufacturing is key. We can’t have all workers from home making no physical product.
Come on man, I am so forward looking to having a conversation with the president. Joe Biden is a Buffoon!
You do realize those characteristics are diametrically opposed to Biden, right?
I don’t expect Biden to last 4 years, maybe not even 1. So I’m sure as hell not voting for ‘president Susan Rice’.
Distraction, not that it matters... There is NO ONE on planet Earth that Biden can choose as his "V.P." that would cause him to LEGITIMATELY win the Presidency.
I doubt Biden even knows who Kamala is or what it means that she "unfollowed" him... Guess he didn't like the way she "smells"?🤣😂🤣
And, you are also misinformed about the Federal deficit.  Recall that Obama / Biden inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  Federal deficit trend (note the increase under Trump before the virus hit):
This isn’t a 100% by any means, but it sure seems like Susan Rice is going to be Joe Biden’s VP pick. The betting markets have completely flipped in the last 24 hours in which Kamala Harris was a big fave &amp; now Rice is the favorite on her own.
The other way to look at jobs, number employed (again Fed data).  Employment rose steadily from 138 M in Dec. 2009 to 152 M in Dec. 2016 under Obama / Biden.
You are also misinformed about jobs.  After Nov. 2010 unemployment fell steadily from 10.5% to 4.9% at the end of 2016 under Obama / Biden (Fed / Bureau of Labor Statistics data).
You are misinformed.  After Q2 2009 real gdp rose every quarter for the next 7 1/2 years under Obama / Biden.  Federal Reserve data:
Please, Governor Whitmer, don't go to Washington as Biden's VP. We need you here in Michigan.
She would graciously say that. Black folk, me in that number, as a reliable voting block are tired of being overlooked. That is very real, and Brother Biden should pay attention to that very real sentiment.
If course I’ll vote for Biden, although Gov. Whitmer and Warren are both qualified they aren’t my 1st choice or 2nd thru 5th choice but in Gov Whitmer’s case it’s all selfish on my part because I’d kind of like to keep her in Michigan. There’s still a lot of work to do

Quick question to you Biden Republicans. Are you voting straight Democrat this election or just for Biden in your ballots?
My grandpa was a real republican. He never liked Trump even before he ran. In February 2016 before he died his last words he said about Trump “He’s a cocksucker” I don’t think he would’ve voted in 2016 but if he was still alive today he would vote for Joe Biden I believe.
According to Biden, 150 million of us have died from gun violence, and 120 million have died from COVID...  So, there should only be 60 million of us left? 🤔😬

Yes. Very much.  And it really bothers me that Biden is the only thing between the VP becoming president. So high likelyhood that the 2021 president is chosen based on race and color.
Probably not until the convention.
Biden is a thoughtful man who measures his words carefully. It's the bs projection of Trump's diseased brain. Have a VP prediction?🌟
If you think that Biden picking Kamala as his VP is what would get a Joe Rogan fan to not vote for him, which you do, you're showing your racist ass. Who cares what a bunch of racist fans of a racist ass think but another racist ass?
Dear Joe Biden, please immediately change your statements from “if” to “when I am president”. It is so much more powerful.

I just took what the polling map was saying and shaded in the solids. I looked at what stated went red or blue for both of Obama’s elections and that’s how I determined which will be red or blue. Even if Joe Biden doesn’t have those toss up states he’d win

Just a question: Where tf were all of you when Biden was VP under Obama for 8 years with these complaints? 🤣 Now you're all digging up shit like detectives. Nope I dont excuse his old career politician ass but…
it’s clear you only read Trump tweets. Biden referred to Trump labeling it the “Chinese” virus as xenophobic, not the travel ban. He actually agreed with it because it was backed by science. You’re not going to win the argument that Trump handled this well. Move along ❤️
So will you vote for Biden and Harris Ben ?
and you know that how? Biden actually believes in science. Him and Obama literally developed a pandemic response guide in 2016 for the next administration (and it wasn’t followed). Funny you even brought him up when we were talking about Trump’s failed response.
And true to form, if Biden does lose, those with questions will be blamed as opposed to the folks whose job it was for the last 3 almost 4 years to present the right candidates and platform. Or if they win you will have leadership that promised nothing but to not be Trump. 🤦‍♂️
biden shoulda chose big gretch 🤦🏾‍♀️.
The reason they want a Democrat back in office is the same reason why they're sitting on their asses &amp; also the same reason why you dont get any calls or people knocking on your door for Biden. Because liberals dont want to have to think or really do anything but go back to sleep
Biden actually grabbed Tara Reade’s pussy.   I am voting Green. #VoteGreen2020  #MedicareForAll
And elect Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris on November 3rd! #ForDennis #BidenHarris2020 #MakeAmericaGoodAgain    10/x
As a result, I have decided to make this donation of the Trump Stimulus Check to the Biden Campaign in honor of the life of  father, Dennis Singer (FYI, I had obtained Alex’s permission before doing so). While I am wary about wanton politicization of the death 8/x
Thread:  I had been planning on donating the Stimulus Check of $1200 I was sent with “Trump’s Signature” to the Biden campaign as I fortunately am not in financial situation where I need the check due to my family’s wealth (I technically qualified for the check due to my job 1/x
Why does biden sound like a tim n eric character
Psst! Biden wants to cut it, too. 🤪
Oh cool Democrats must have some more tricks up their sleeve? So who are the utimate nominees who will have integrity?? I could get behind Andrew Yang and Tulsi ticket! Since neither Biden or Harris could even spell integrity let alone represent it.... is this a bait and switch?
So wait, if Biden and Harris are elected do I still get to eat red meat?
Bowel Biden
Joe Biden would vote for it
You said Biden was a rapist and said you believed the woman that came out against him..Now 6 months later your supporting him..what’s that say about you? That you can be bought like every other politician..
Bush and Biden are both complicit. Bush for proposing it, Biden for voting for and enthusiastically supporting it. How disgusted were you back when Biden did that?
Gretchen=370 billion (100 MI +270 Billion) due to me to, Democrat jobs 2018, 6 Trillion. I got arrears child support 400 mo., insulting. Biden says he's giving it to me. Timetable and dates? I trust nobody with power/money. No to Darla.  Stop pimping me.  Fox for President 2020

We will have a competent secretary of education who isn't hellbent on destroying public education. We will have people in cabinet positions that aren't simply there because they wrote fat checks to his campaign, like Trump. At least Biden will listen to science.
also before I log off for a bit: I absolutely never want to hear any of you fuckers call voting for Biden "harm reduction" ever again especially since harm reduction involves compassion for people and neither Biden or Harris are examples of people with compassion

How did you feel about Joe Biden helping start the Iraq War?
then I'll get told that oh what Biden or Harris did 30/15/last week doesn't matter because people "grow" and "change" but growth and change requires an acknowledgement that you fucked up and you're actively working on correcting your wrongs and i haven't seen ANYTHING like this
Obama and Biden spied on them do some research look into things can’t get your info from cnn
Biden did not run on M4ALL, Bernie Sanders did and lost   Think if Trump had control of the healthcare system in the midst of a pandemic.
Biden saying he can force companies to follow aoc trash green deal,If your a scientist then you would understand that deal would cause more harm,capitalism isn’t driven by the government
none of the dems in congress are going to do anything about the USPS and yet I'll get told by hordes of wet brained liberals on this site that not voting for Biden is voting for trump. well maybe the dems should have been a little more fucking proactive in the past 3 years
The Biden sign has the weird E, the Obama signs had the weird O. What’s wrong with just spelling the candidates last name out normally on the damn sign.
So Biden listening to people who have stated they want to tear down America and build it the way they want,Bernie saying Biden is gone far left,then look to Venezuela 4 years destroyed is that what you want cause that’s socialism
I just think we should hold the corrupt politicians like Biden who start all the wars more morally accountable than an E-5 playing video games on Twitch 🤷‍♀️
Disgraced ??? The Obama and Biden spying on trump or Democrats letting cities be destroyed and then asking the tax payers to rebuild them??? What are your selfish goals ?dont vote them solves your problem

The reason the DNC silenced Julián is because unlike Kamala when he criticized Biden he held his ground. She did it for the debate, he did it because he is a principled leader.
Spin ???? You just spun that he called all Mexicans rapist and liars, proved my point you sound like you work for cnn,we know Biden was for segregation,against busing and the crime bill,all you have is spin,I will vote the way I want and I want freedom not some socialist trash
Ms Harris garnered exactly 0 delegates from her own party. Biden chose his running mate based on gender AND race! Is that not the textbook definition of sexism and racism?
Good lord. This “Joe Biden is a puppet of the left” stuff is beyond stupid. It’s demented.

You’ve all been subjected to a move of the goal posts.  These are ALL right of center candidates. Biden, Harris, even Warren. Bernie was the only centrist.  If you support policy positions that 60% of Americans want, then you’re a centrist. Check the polls - M4A, 60%
I will predict how this is going to go, because this is how Putin does it: (1) In October, Bill Barr will arrest Joe Biden. It doesn't really matter if Biden did anything illegal, he will be in jail. (2) No matter what the outcome, Trump will declare victory in the election. 1/4
I understand not liking Biden, but for the love of all that is decent just fucking vote for him (through whichever median available) there’s no way he’s worse than this.

Young people sharing memes about how voting for Joe is exactly the same as voting for a literal fascist is ignorant at best and helping trump get re-elected at worst. Joe Biden is far far far from perfect, but at least he respects the election and understands how a virus works.
Too many people in politics believe that the only way to win is the way the last person won. That it can’t be done better. That’s always been BS and Joe Biden is proving that this year.
The first year of the Biden presidency is going to consist of repairing all the damage.
That’s precisely the point of “having to” vote for Biden as someone long disenfranchised ...
We’ve tried the power of love, we’ve tried the power of reason... if Biden loses or refuses to listen to us, we must turn to the only remaining option... the power of an unimaginable orgy of symbolic property damage, since property is the only thing they give a fuck about

I will vote by mail... but in all honesty... I would put on a mask and suffer a 18 hour wait in the rain to vote for Biden in a swing state.
#VoteForBiden because Biden isn’t going to withhold funding for the POST OFFICE
Trump has a substantial lead over Biden among all white religious groups in this Pew survey: white Catholics (17 point lead), white mainline Protestants (18 point lead), white evangelical Protestants (67 point lead:
One of the things liberals keep pushing is the flawed logic that,  "You are what you vote for" Joe Biden is a creepy hair sniffer. Have fun being that. Lol
Only voting Biden cause I have no choice.
Life gives us choices. Sometimes, the choices aren’t pleasant. Bernie lost. Biden won. Biden chose his VP. Do you vote for the current person in office or Biden? Being obtuse is complaining about the two choices after 40 states have decided against what you wanted.
Uh... no. That’s literally not at all what I said.   If Ava wants to vote Biden, that’s fine. I’ll likely be voting Biden. I have no choice. But pretending this shit never happened and sweeping it under the rug in the guise of “it’s anti-Black” is mad corny to me.Oh hell no. Biden for the win. Warren freaks me out
#MiFor Biden/Harris We must do better, get AB then drop off at drop box or clerks office. Can’t count on mail! Or mail 4 weeks early! Michigan SOS: More than 10,000 primary election ballots invalid, many due to late arrival  via ⁦
It made be crystal clear to us, but I think, at least to Joe Biden, he is blind to it! Or at the very least not consciously aware?
Postal carriers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake
Well, what do you think your chances of survival are for you and your loved ones with Trump? The funny thing is that MAGA is now a great slogan for those who vote for Biden. You are still MAGA, Make America Great Again by voting for Biden. Do you think its greater now than 2015?
I'm afraid that come november, even if Biden gets elected, people are going to assume they can sit back and stop protesting for important causes because the president will "fix everything" which is NOT the case. Regardless of who wins, don't stop fighting. They won't change

Finally!!! Biden, Harris blasted by mainstream media for not taking questions from reporters
Joe Biden has promised to appoint a Secretary of Education who has actually been a public school teacher.   I can't wait.

That would be Biden! Isn’t he so nice about the Black people! I can’t believe they would vote for him or Harris! Don’t trust either one of them! No he’s not joking on what he saids! I wouldn’t vote for evil racist never!
This is a terrible headline, but the story itself is a very good inside baseball/process view.  As for Whitmer, she had made it clear for months that while she was flattered to be considered, she wasn't interested at this time; she's busy saving Michigan.

I love your posts and not looking to argue..... Joe Biden isn’t intelligent enough to have written the Patriot Act.  Corporate interests wrote it and had Biden claim he wrote it. Then lobbyists threatened to primary anyone who dared to vote against it.
. JOE BIDEN IS NOT IN CHARGE DID OBAMA HAVE ANY THING TO DO WITH THIS WOMAN'S POSITION?                                           Vote:  REPUBLICAN  2020 - 2022
Do you want to lose your social security? Trump wants to end it. Biden voted to cut it 4 times.
Ever wonder why American Presidents are prohibited from taking monies or lavish gifts from foreign countries?  Because it compromises them.  Biden has been compromised by American corporate interests as well as Ukraine who gifted his moron son millions of dollars.
Of course. Plus she deserves it. My guess though is Biden will lose more white votes than the black votes he gains. I hope I am wrong.

That’s understandable because BIDEN did not pick her. The leftists who pull his strings picked her.
If the stock market starts to fall. Trump will blame it on fear of Biden election.
“Biden believes in killing babies at 9 months” God I don’t have the mental capacity for this today.
Funny how trump gave the 1% a permanent tax cut. The rest of us got a small temporary cut. Now he is making up stuff about Biden. Remember when Obama/Biden fixed the economic mess left by Bush? I guess Biden will have to clean up an even bigger mess this time. #TrumpDepression
The Biden campaign is looking more and more like "Weekend at Bernies."
What about excusing the rape claims against Biden as well? Rose McGowan calls out Kamala Harris for taking funds from Weinstein
America makes progress after kicking and screaming and whining, but progress is made just the same. We need to work to make sure the Trump years were just a blip of “waaa we don’t wanna” sandwiched between Obama and Biden/Harris, with a more just and equal America for everyone.
I watched this multiple times. You're missing the point. Biden can disagree with somebody &amp; realize they have a lot to offer even if they have a different opinion on something. This is leadership  &amp; Character.   Donald Trump will fire you if you disagree with his ideas.
You should spend some time doing research before you blast out comments on Twitter. It's clearly documented that Joe Biden grew up with his stuttering problem.  Biden has overcome his insecurities about stuttering. Trump has never overcome his insecurities resulting in narcissism
Romney is looking for a job in Biden’s administration. They will both be disappointed.
No thanks Sir.  Corporate interests inserted their puppet Biden into the nomination.  Maybe 2024. Good luck.
So what are you saying?  Sounds like your saying “ Bernie raised funds, Wall Street won’t allow him to win.  You are voting Biden.  I think that is what your saying.  I respect your decision. 👍🏻.  It’s a free country.  I’m voting against Biden the corporate selected nominee.
If this is true then donald trump and biden both have an IQ of 228
Well duhhh!  Exact reason I’m asking Green voters to vote trump.  Keep worthless corporate owned Biden out of office all together.   Ten steps ahead of you there.
Fantastic 2 days of introducing Biden/Harris! Speeches brought tears of joy. Truth, empathy &amp; plans for America! Bravo team, well done!
Yes, it could be important. Big conflict of interest. Chameleon Harris looks like a swamp creature. Biden Harris a very establishment beltway business. Let’s take a good look.
Hell know to Biden and Harris!
So did The Simpsons predict a Biden/Harris ticket and were they in the white house, we need to know
I think it’s great they asked a respected Republican governor to endorse Biden at the DNC. And it’s spelled soul.
David, I appreciate what you wrote and I admire your enthusiasm and optimism but this is absolutely the worst possible combination of nominees for a progressive platform.  I will be voting for Biden, but I almost certainly will be changing my registration to Independent soon.
If you have no standards... ‘Kamala Harris slammed by Rose McGowan for accepting past donations from Harvey Weinstein’, ‘Biden raped Tara Reide’

to litigate the case against Trump. Her historical place as a Black women. Biden can be the good nice guy. She can tear Trump and Pence in two. She is smart. Tough. But she has a warmth as well.  It will make a big difference. In dome years the VP is irrelevant. LBJ took
Those who believe the VP position means little have no idea. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it doesn’t. Joe Biden helped Obama by assuring voters that he was not a radical leftist. And he was white. This year the VP is critical due to Biden’s advanced age. Her ability
Come on! Harris makes her real-life campaign debut and blames the China COVID and job loss on Trump.

Are we supposed to vote for Biden and Harris because they are the best the Democratic Party has to offer or because one was Obama’s VP and the other is an African American woman?   Tell me the policy reasons I should vote for them. Don’t try to win me over with heartstrings.
Pollsters are fearful due to missing the Trump victory so they are reluctant of being too strong for Biden despite their own polling. My guess is that the polling for a Biden victory is accurate. Harris will increase his lead in the polls. Trump will be defeated unless Putin and
Chameleon Harris can’t make up her mind and Slow Joe Biden can’t find his mind. If only they would mind their own business, it would be no problem. But, they may well wind up leading the country. Where will they lead it? Who will lead them? Reject this puppet show.
Time to get to work, Andrew! So, where is your Biden photo in relation to Verlander?
Biden VP Pick Prompts Support, Criticism In Michigan
I never thought anyone could compare in speaking ability to President Obama. Harris did it today. She hit it out of the park. It was one of the best speeches other than ones by JFK that I have heard. She will be formidable. Pence and Trump are no match. Biden was excellent too!
Absolutely!!! I love that Beau Biden’s legacy is part of this too!

👍🏼✌🏼Biden lays a trap for Trump in picking Harris
You mean the lady that gave Hillary Clinton all the answers during the debate? No!     She’s probably already giving CNN, MSMBC ideas on how to put and ear piece on Biden’s ear so they can do the same
’Fundamentally Wrong On All Of The Issues’: Jason Chaffetz Predicts A Biden And Harris Loss
Chameleon Harris is not a wise choice. What did we expect from Joe Biden. C’mon man!
Whitmer told Biden she didn't want VP spot, urged him to choose Black woman  via
He didn’t say that.  He said it’s further to the left than it’s ever been, but that platform has nothing to do with Biden.
Ok sure but there 3 months till the election do you think enough people are going to vote independent (and agree on a candidate) to make even a dent against Biden or trump Conservatives are anti change that's their whole schtick, you need a liberal supreme court for real change
Because here’s the thing: you’re not voting for Biden.  You’re voting for Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s successor.  It’s choosing between getting shot in the knee or shot in the gut, but if you choose neither, then someone else takes the bullet for you.
I dislike them both, but as I’ve said over and over again, I’m not voting for Biden, but RBG’s successor.
The concerns are legitimate, because voting for Biden is painful.  However, this isn’t an election where you vote to get someone IN, this is an election where you’re trying to get someone OUT.  If Joe doesn’t do the right thing in four years, then vote him out too.
Biden passes over Whitmer, taps Kamala Harris for vice presidential nod  via
As bad as Biden and Harris are, they at least have people like Warren, Sanders, and the BLM movement nudging them in different directions.  All I can hope is that they listen, because four more tears of Trump is just the start of the worse alternative.
Anybody realize joe Biden been in office for longer than any of us have been alive, (most of my followers) and still Has yet to change anything, what makes anyone think he will now ?😂
Bruh I promise I’ll still vote for Biden/Harris as a lot of us will.   I’m not gonna be fuckin thrilled about it tho. Please just admit you’re a moderate if you love this pairing, PLEASE.
Are you saying Biden doesn't have money he brought in Kamala for money? 🙄🙄..  Do you follow American politics? First of she got this VP ticket based on her black race (Mixed Indian race is added bonus, if she is pure Indian, she won't be in the race for sure)
So apparently some of the first real oppo they release on  is basically reminding voters that the Biden-Harris White House will end the discriminatory cash bail system in this country
Politics is a chess game. Few Americans play chess. Joe Biden doesn't. In this game, he is NOT a King, he is a little soldier that Dems move to the left. Pretty soon, he'll fall of the chess board. Kamala is NOT a Queen either. She is a chameleon, who is easily changing colors.
I can’t wait to vote Biden/Harris in November!!!
I was talking to a few of my neighbors last night, they support Biden, and one of them said she worried what white men will think about Harris. I said I don’t give a shit what white men think, I care about what black women think. #BidenHarris2020
Trump is 3 years younger than Biden..weighs 75 pounds more..Biden can ride a bicycle..Trump would die within 30 seconds trying to ride a bicycle..so the death mongering is ridiculous..
Joe Biden is a secret Muslim? What happened? Did Obama secretly convert him? Did Obama convert Biden over to Marxism as well? Is Scranton, PA really part of America? Joe! Where's your birth certificate?
Biden/Harris support return to Iran deal which takes the Mullahs/Hezbollah off their death bed and resuscitates terror and violence toward Israel. They support threatening Israel to make concessions and deals with Jew hating Abbas etc.
Biden is a Catholic.  Granted a common-sense and not an  Opus Dei Catholic.  Still, a Catholic.
Seems like #Russia's Putin wants Trump to win the election and #China's Xi Jinping wants Joe Biden to win the election 😂😂😅  #MAGA #KamalaHarris
And they along with Bernie endorsed Biden.
“Geography matters less than it used to in the general scheme of things,” Ms. Rizzo said. “She is the daughter of immigrants. Florida is a state of immigrants.” Counting on Fl! #BidenHarris2020
No she didn’t change her mind! She’s looking at this as a opportunity if Biden gets sick she can take over as President!
Don’t think so! She won’t be debating ! It will be trump and Biden!
So because the Obama team didn't do it this way they automatically assumed that Biden's team wouldn't?  It makes sense, really--get the oppo out there to see if anyone gives a shit *and* to see how the prospective VP candidate handles/responds to it being dumped.
Joe and Beau Biden of course.
“ sent word to Biden’s team that while she was flattered, she no longer wanted to be considered for the running mate slot, according to a high-ranking Democrat familiar with the process. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman”
So after all the fuss about Secret Chartered Flights from South Bend last night...he asked her via FaceTime.
I disagree. Biden’s pull with those Obama / Trump voters is masssive and under reported. They will turn out where it counts.. People seem to forget that Trump won by &lt; 100k perfectly placed votes. If I recall correctly he won MI by 17k. Those votes are gone.
Fun story: A year ago, when there were still like 300 Democratic candidates, I whipped up a fundraising page for ALL of them as a joke. As each one dropped out I removed them from the page. For months it’s been just Biden, of course, but I haven’t promoted it until today. 1/
Proud to be a Biden Supporter!
So here’s a question: How long has his digital/graphic design team known she was his pick? Or did they create logos, websites, graphics, site content, etc for EVERY likely choice just in case? Are there Biden/Warren, Biden/Whitmer &amp; Biden/Rice websites buried on the server?
I don't want to do it. I don't like Biden one bit.  He doesn't' represent me at all. But I will do it, because I must, because the alternative is a threat to democracy itself.
Go google Biden’s voting record from 73-09. Then stick your head in a soiled toilet and flush.  You have no idea what you are talking about.
Agreed. This was my hope since Biden became the presumptive nominee. So pumped. It’s been a joy watching most of the reaction.
Vote Trump nothing harms Corporate pimp Biden more.
I think folks are under the impression that Biden himself is acting as his own web developer or something.
Was......Ridin with Biden:-(((( til he chose Krapala
Green is great. Trump votes are more damaging to Biden.  I’m not sure how many 29 dollar Bernie donations I made.  Close to 3500 I can account for. ( I smoke ) can’t always remember.....  DNC fucked me out of 3500ish. Trump it is this ballot
They will when we start winning. This Biden nomination saved me a small fortune in political contributions. I gave 100 to that 70 something year old lady to retire.   That lady, is gunna be most of us if we don’t eliminate the corporate owned DNC and their gaggle of puppets
This isn't the first time that the GOP has outright lied about what our candidates have said. Just the other day, Michigan Republicans said that Biden wants to defund the police–when he has literally said the opposite in a June 10th Op. Ed.
May I ask are you turning out to vote Biden?  Only fair to say I am not.
I cannot get rid of a Biden, Kamala Harris header 😵
She’s a liar also! But then Biden is also!
Oh my God this woman is a liar! She knows Biden is a racist!
This was the difference between Sanders and Warren. This is why I had to vote Biden in my state primary.   DON'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE FANTASTIC
Bullshit! He picked who he wanted.   I wanted Warren/Harris. Then Biden/Warren. But I GOT Biden/Harris and guess what? It's STILL going to be a successful ticket and they'll accomplish great things.  COVID has validated Warren policies. She'll be unstoppable in the '21 Senate
What a terrible choice. Good ole Joe. Politics at its best. Biden sucks.
okay in all seriousness kamala was a dogshit pick even before police brutality came up in the discourse again. her history as prosecuter, DA and AG is a bad look but is great when juxtaposed with “minimum sentencing” biden, the DNC continuing to push lukewarm dipshits who are...
Biden-Harris has been my dream ticket for some time, so I love today’s news. I also love how many other absolutely incredible women have been in the public eye as serious contenders more than prepared for the office.
Do ⁦⁦ &amp; ⁦⁦ remember this ⁦ statement or are they too busy soaking in the praise from the liberal media who only loves republicans when they attack republicans?
So if you criticize her record, her unauthentic grandstanding in Congress and leftist policies, you’re a sexist and racist??? Group called 'We Have Her Back' warns media against 'sexist' or 'racist' coverage of Biden VP pick | Fox News
Whoo hoo! Biden/Harris 2020!  💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Can’t wait for  racist-ass response to Biden’s VP choice.   #VicePresident #Trump #Biden
Until Kamala Harris comes out and honestly explains why she refused to pursue and prosecute Steve Mnuchin the head of our treasury for gaming for closures when he was at One  West I will not vote for Biden
SOLID pick! Let’s do this 🔵🇺🇸   #BeatTrump #BidenHarris2020 #Biden2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP #Biden #Democrats #USA #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #HistoricPick #Kamala
Horrible decision I will not vote for Biden!
Until Kamala Harris explains why she did not prosecute Steve Mnuchin for gaming foreclosures with One West which incurred company fines to the tone of 100M dollars, I will not be voting for Biden.  Of all the qualified and incredible running mates, he chose the poorest candidate!
Interesting that the stock market took a hit near the end of today. If Biden wins. We will find out what the crooks were up to these past years.
Ridin' with Biden and Harris!! Lets dump Trump!
You're not making any sense, if Russia has already purchased Biden then  that's who they would want in the office ad president.   Russia has purchased Donald, Mitch McConnell,  and grassley
Okay somebody needs to do some research. Every single thing Biden did regarding this situation has already been evaluated. Watch the entire tape &amp; read the articles.   Stop using propaganda that's faults.  Research dude research.
Presumptive of me, but I'm really proud of Joe Biden for choosing a woman who hit him hard in the debate. He's showing us he's a man who can take criticism and doesn't hold grudges. How refreshing.
Biden made the best choice possible imo. And the others will be part of his team. As a lawyer. I respect her intelligence and ability. Joe needs a fighter. He will unite Dems and have a great cabinet. Trump can win only by cheating. And he will try.
The bussing comments made by Biden against Harris in the debate were overstated. Bussing was never a great solution to a big problem. But it also allowed many of color here in Detroit to get to better schools and many from poor neighborhoods. In retrospect. It was a disaster.
Ok is that why she went and met with Biden last week .
Remember the debate where Kamala Harris heavily criticized Biden on busing? Picking Harris speaks volumes about the kind of man Joe Biden is. Does anyone think President Man-Baby would or could pick someone who wouldn't kiss his fat ass day in, day out?
Kamala Harris is announced as Joe Biden's running mate(VP), her mother is a tamilian (Dad is an African American). Joe Biden's memory is getting so bad, if Biden wins, he may not continue as a President for long, Kamala may take over. Congrats Kamala 👍🏼
Hell yeah!  I’m way more excited about Kamala than Biden but let’s do this!!! #bluewave #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris2020
I can't wait for VP Harris to be the girl power face of what's sure to be a brutal, sustained, and punitive crackdown on protests using faceless federal troops the SECOND Biden wins. Assuming he does of course, and that's no slam dunk.
Joe Biden just lost his 2020 election good going 😂
I have stayed out of the frey. But I believe this is a great choice. She can take on Trump and Pence and Mitch. Trump can’t attack too hard. She knows the law and how to take on Trump. Biden may have Warren at Treasury. Those tax returns. Schiff as AG. Abrams at HEW.
Newt you are 100% correct that Biden desparetely needs to shore up his support in the black community, although not the first to notice it.
Fuck. I knew i should have bought one of those Biden Harris websites when they were doing the primaries coz i knew this was coming
Biden/Harris - the comprehensive rapist/mass incarceration bootlicker 2020.  Trump is Rapist/Religious Mysogynist.  There is no "win" here.
Excellent choice! “Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate”
Biden chose  Well done!
Okay so the White House website has a presidential briefing scheduled for 5:30 Eastern. I think it would be funny if Biden went live at 5:29.
Have you noticed how Trump doesn’t talk about his own plans for the future but all he does is critisize Biden? Maybe it’s because he doesn’t have any plans?
“Biden picked WHO???”
Give me one solid reason to vote for Biden.
There's a difference between a country wanting somebody as president and country manipulating an election to get their candidate. We already know Russia is actively manipulating, using social media. Germany would like to see Biden. Does that make them an enemy of the state.
I'm trying to get your point here. So who really cares if China wants Biden to be president. We all know Russia, a much more dangerous entity, wants and will manipulate to have Donald j Trump remain president. You forget they helped him win in 2016.
And he accuses VP Biden of cognitive slippage. There are montages, like this, of coo coo for Cocoa Puffs moments from DJT. Yikes.

#JoeBiden If you had two words for Joe Biden what would they be?            🚮 Shoulders beware 🚮
So sad. I saw a campaign called “settle for Biden”. Settle. I still can’t understand if they’re serious or it is in jest. That’s the 2020 election in a nutshell
I hope not; Basemeent Biden is going down and taking Gretchy Whitmer with him
How about Joe Biden answer for rubbing that young girls chest. You people are sick as f
Biden is the absolute worst nomination ever.  Read that.
📣 I don’t know who Biden’s running mate will be. I *do* know that  is joining the  online this evening; use the link if you’d like to join her!
No I think it’s Byee Biden! You are a disgrace!2/3 a coup, Obama/Biden had a pattern of 8 yrs of spying so why is anyone surprised that they spied on Oppo party and a Presidency  They spied e.g. Merkel, AP, Rosen/Family, Congressional committees; All Americans=Clapper lied under oath; Brennan lied, Comey leak/spied
Joe "I don't do white running mates" Biden is definitely turning out to be the real deal.
Ffs. Did someone on the Biden campaign discover Twitter or something?
I need to ask you if you are for or against abortion? &amp; Either for or against the LGBTQ? I am just asking a simple question. I agree with Biden about the economy, &amp; I Pray you are there to help him as well. To be honest, I lost trust in politics years ago.😰
Oh hell no. Biden for the win. Warren freaks me out
Ill be looking forward to seeing the Running VP behind bars. Shes an active terrorist and a communist. If Biden is elected we can put her away forever. In her own system.   42 U.S. Code § 1985.Conspiracy to interfere with civil rights

I have complete confidence in the Biden Harris team! Hopefully the cabinet includes many of the other candidates.
I feel like you’re wildly under-selling the amount of Americans who refuse to vote for Biden. It’s not just online smugbros, there’s a ton of ex-hippie boomers for example.  America will suck regardless, but Trump winning would make it a permanent, potentially world-ending  suck.
Congressman Khanna, you are more of a leader for the people than Biden or Harris will ever be. Please keep up your pressure if they get elected.
We are so fortunate to have you as Joe Biden’s running mate. Major hurdles, of course,   Massive sexism (at 72 yrs I so understand), birthism (no surprise), that craziness about no red meat (anything to be just plain crazy). We just fight the good fight!!!!
This should put to rest any notion that Biden doesn’t intend to act like he’s the president when he’s the president.
Postal Union Endorses Biden-Harris As Trump Threatens USPS
So what the hell is your point?  Because he repeated a grade that makes him ineligible to be POTUS?  Really Soledad I expected better from you than this bs!  Move on, #Biden-Harris to save USA!
Biden is a warmonger who along with Obama/Hillary invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and fueled Syrian/Yemeni war and sent American soldiers to fight useless wars. How is any of that showing empathy and leadership?
Vote for Biden anyway.  Count on Biden to put together a team of advisors that he will actually listen to.  He’s not going in thinking he has to know everything.  He just has to know how to lead.  Besides we have a better shot at surviving the next 4 years with Biden for Prez.
A vote for Biden is a vote supporting his warmongering with Obama, their invasion of Libya, their drone bombing in seven countries and the death of 100,000 brown people. F off with your democracy. A vote for Biden is a vote for war and murder.
Edgy take of the day:  "We are bombarded by death, disease and the dawning of a new Great Depression. . . . But as a silver lining, we no longer have to suffer the bullshit of presidential campaign reporting."  -- Hamilton Nolan,
It’s cool. Biden/Obama led Libyan invasion, drone bombed seven countries, fueled arms to Syria/Yemen conflict and led to 100,000 dead brown people. So if you vote for Biden, I consider you having voted to bomb brown people.
2/2  is full of Crap so much data incl Dossier/FISA ABUSES; documents via Freedom of Info by   why do u let Tarlov say if I haven’t seen anything yet re Historic spying on Oppo party w so many lies by Obama/Biden Rice Comey McCabe
How does the rest of the panel let Tarlov get away w her BS - there is plenty of Documented information that Obama/Biden spied on  campaign and Presidency and it is a continuation of 8 years of spying eg Clapper all Americans; AP; Rosen/Family; Merkel  1/2
Dems aren’t “looking for the perfect candidate.” If this was any other country progressives like Bernie wouldn’t even be the same party as Biden. We don’t want the perfect candidate. We just want a candidate period. I’m voting for Biden but Biden is not progressives’ candidate.
Btw I’m still begrudgingly voting for Biden. Not sorry. If you can’t acknowledge Trump is worse than Biden you need let go of your inflated image driven ego and learn to think critically. Stay mad
I live voting for Biden on “polls” hahaha. Trump 2020!
Biden is whatever I don’t like
They probably have Biden signs in their yard! Hiden Biden!
These polls suggest that Biden has a lock on the popular vote, and an almost certain lock on a November victory. State polls suggest the same. He's ahead of Trump by 6 points or so in Michigan, for example.
"Hell no, I'm not resigning ... I thought (the post) was humorous. I had no idea people would react the way they did. I think people have gone overboard on this … It's an election year."

Joe Biden is going to force our children to read the Curand (muslim bible) in schools.
Biden good,  trump very, very horrible traitor.
R: Don’t vote for Biden, he’s a pedo.   D: Don’t vote for Trump, he’s a pedo.   That’s a fucking issue.
I hope someone makes a digital animation of a Biden/Harris train, because wowie.
I just saw the gal bullying the 12 y/o and I’m leaving it on Coward’s Ratio look up my likes if you want to find it. Like listen man, I get you’re that mad about Biden and Kamala....I don’t know how to finish that sentence.
Joe Biden Calls For Nationwide Mask Mandate 'Immediately'
Of course. Plus she deserves it. My guess though is Biden will lose more white votes than the black votes he gains. I hope I am wrong.
He talks out of both sides of his mouth. One time he says one thing. Then five minutes later he's saying something different. And he can't stand it when Biden is right and he's not.  Trump has to be center of attention for everything. He can't stand it when Biden or Harris talk.
I think it's the opposite. The people who aren't partisan are going to see that even Biden partisans believe Trump's talking point that Biden isn't up for it.
There is nothing that undermines Biden more than this obsession that he won't be president for 4 years and probably run for reelection.
Where's Biden?
What’s the point anyway?  Biden will do what he wants so Ro’s vote against the platform means nothing.
r u kidding, the demon'crats will do anything to win  elections...how do people like Whitmore...the squad..polosi..Schumer  ..Schiff.. problem child M. Watters..shit for brains the thief biden...Kamala the mirror fake news Harris ...who votes for these pos...they cheat !
And yet Biden is a big enough man and ethical leader to choose someone as his running mate that doesn’t always pander to him. This is a refreshing change! We will have better outcomes in leadership when we are permitted a diversity of ideas and solutions.
Everything is going to come out IF we can successfully elect Biden/Harris. The Trumpublicans and Trump syndicate WILL see PRISON! That's why this is all or nothing for this corrupt regime! Vote! No matter how you do it! Vote!
Dolly Parton should be the Secretary of Humanity in the Biden Administration.
when u talk of Stock Market share how many people are in the stock Market incl pension funds. In addition, when Biden Harris say they would Mandate Nationally - it is an example of the Nanny State and Dems plan to have Govt Control over everything eg zoning Suburb 1/2
Trump is already blaming Biden for everything and calling him a liar... also said number 1 in the world for Ventilators?!... please end this shit #TrumpKillsUSPS #TrumpThreatensAmerica
It's already collapsed and the world is already laughing. It's time for a Biden rebuild.
Every time you feel the urge to take a shot at Biden or Harris, redirect that shit toward Trump. There is a country to save.
no biden voters allowed to read my tweets
My father (MI) Trump My mother (MI) Trump My step father (MI) Trump My uncles (IN) Trump My my aunts (IN) Biden Myself (Macomb County) Biden My wife (Macomb County) Biden My mother in law (MI) Biden My father in law (MI) Trump
Yep a very cynical ploy by Trump. Vote for Joe Biden!
I think Biden is better than Trump that’s it. I don’t like Biden he’s just the better of the two shitty candidates.
Thank you for agreeing with me. You’re right, you weren’t talking about Biden’s covid response, but you quoted my tweet about Biden’s covid response with a completely new topic and acted like my tweet you quoted was in opposition of your comment. Be honest in your discourse plz
Has Joe Biden congratulated Trump on the historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates?
My super power would be to snap us right to Jan21, 2021 for Biden’s inauguration.
Per Biden's rule, perhaps you're not really Latino. 😉
Hey Kamala Harris, Care to explain why prison stocks rose, as soon as u were announced as Biden’s running mate? Or are u just gonna continue doing what your doing at the expense of others. I hate choosing the lesser of two evils
I always wonder how tf Trump shoves Big Macs down his gullet every day and has even lived this long. What kind of sick joke is the universe playing? And Biden looks like he could croak literally any second. It’s the same feeling of waiting for the screensaver to hit the corner.
#SayHisName  it's sad i have to hear about this on twitter i guess the news is to busy bashing joe biden.
Amazing to see a so-called Christian call out the faith of Joe Biden (a regular Catholic churchgoer) while embracing #ImpotusAmericanus who has trampled every teaching of Jesus Christ!!! Absolute hypocrisy!!! #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide
In short, fascism won’t be changed in one election, but we can chip away at it by voting in the direction that we want. Like it or not(and I fucking hate it) Biden is our most progressive VIABLE candidate. And that sucks ass but it’s reality.
And look at the fact that RBG’s term is ending. You DO NOT want trump to be in command when it’s time for her to be replaced... anyway, my point is no voting for Biden won’t immediately change anything but it will make it easier to get the change we want to see in the future
One single person to take command of everything. Look at Trumps cabinet and how damaging they have been to the country. Let’s be honest here, Biden probably isn’t going to even live through his full term. But the cabinet he puts in will have be way better than the current one
Future that I would want to see, NOT because Biden represent the future I want to see, but because if he gets elected Trump will be out office. My main focus is just getting trump out of there ASAP because he can’t handle this pandemic. Biden sucks but he at least will be able to
With that out of the way let’s address the second thing you said. I’m not claiming voting for Biden will end the oligarchy. Not even close. Voting for one candidate can’t accomplish that, but that’s not the goal of voting for him... voting for him is just one step toward the
Is biden harris having one at 5 20
Since you decided to share a definition with me earlier I think it’s only fair I get to do the same. You still keep straw Manning my arguments. Trump is demonstrably worse than Biden. I don’t like Biden. I think we can agree that we need to abolish the two party stystem right?
The Biden campaign is looking more and more like "Weekend at Bernies."
America makes progress after kicking and screaming and whining, but progress is made just the same. We need to work to make sure the Trump years were just a blip of “waaa we don’t wanna” sandwiched between Obama and Biden/Harris, with a more just and equal America for everyone.
2/3 let Voters exactly what Harris/Biden promised Dem Voters-    Get  info on Harris re not prosecuting Catholic Church abusers &amp; his documents- how she went after Sickle Cell Student then talk to
attack Harris’/ Biden’s Primary positions! Why, bec Harris will certainly take over from Biden- then will push her own agenda - if Biden wins and can remain Pres for 1st term - I believe he will resign near the end so Kamala will be Pres leading into the  election 1/3
Okay that’s not a good thing, but that’s child’s play compared to systematically destroying the USPS in the middle of a global pandemic. Not even in the same realm. Like I said, Biden isn’t good, but Trump is off the charts fascist. It’s not even a comparison.
okay then i don’t wanna hear shit about progressives or “bernie bros” losing biden the election in november. y’all don’t want or need our votes but then blame us for everything when shit goes south. and for the record I still am voting for biden.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Yes and I’m choosing to vote for the guy who’s not actively engaging in voter suppression(fascism). Don’t get me wrong I can’t stand Biden or Harris, but we can’t let Trump erode our democracy another 4 more years
Fantastic 2 days of introducing Biden/Harris! Speeches brought tears of joy. Truth, empathy &amp; plans for America! Bravo team, well done!
One Tough Question For DOJ If Biden Is Elected: Whether To Prosecute Trump
Most candidates run to the center in the general election. Biden is moving left.  via
Oh, “it’s on” alright. Pence has no idea. He hasn’t a hope in hell. 🇺🇸 #biden Harris
Says it all. Simple as that. Biden/Harris 🇺🇸#freep #detnews #PureMichigan #BidenHarris
So did The Simpsons predict a Biden/Harris ticket and were they in the white house, we need to know
*herman laying in peace*  Biden: kamala is my running mate  Herman:
Bernie: sets of easy to digest plans with bills backing them up  Biden: I’m gonna restore the soul of America and I’m not Trump. C’mon man!
I’m been trying to convince my socialist friends to settle for Biden for months, and this short video makes me want to stop that.   Shane, go phone bank for Joe, rather than shit talk leftist who have legit reservations on how bad the Dems are.
Not sure what that has to do with anything. Biden being old just means that he's from a different generation than the populist wing, which was true for HW too
By the way Biden's is obviously George HW Bush, who was the VP of a popular more conservative president and fought of a conservative populist in the primaries.
DOJ? PFFT. Please with a criminal as AG. I can't wait to see these criminals go to prison. Biden has already said he will not stand in the way of investigation and incarceration of these criminals.
The weirdest part of 2020 is that Joe Biden essentially dominated his primary, is up 7, and his supporters don't expect him to really be president, as if this hasn't been something he and his circle have wanted for 40 years.
I think it’s great they asked a respected Republican governor to endorse Biden at the DNC. And it’s spelled soul.
just watched your show. I loved how Biden teed up the mispronunciation of Kamala for you. I laughed out loud
Everyone is saying "what are we supposed to vote for t*ump now?" Like no ofc not but its also not bad to recognize and understand what harris and biden have done. Honestly no one's going to be happy but just vote for Biden and Harris and understand that they both suck ass
⁦ Dude, you do know, if Biden wins he won’t take the Oval Office until next January 20, right? Not this November, as you have in this story. Seriously? For shame. And your copy editor should be fired.
The point I'm making is that Biden/Harris have a better chance of helping someone.
Wouldnt someone who champions Biden and the cop be outing themselves as well?
I feel you, I understand the gravity of it all. I can’t vote for a guy just because he’s not another guy. So I either stay home, or write in Andrew yang. Biden is more of the same and will usher in someone even worse than Trump
Awesome!!!! GO BIDEN AND HARRIS!!
Netflix is not a propaganda machine? I mean, Obama is part of netflix is he not?  Yes the US (cia..intelligence agencies)have done and allowed some creepy things...u see Trump is cleaning out deep state  pedophiles, thieves like biden, child traffickers...that's why trumps hated
But I read the KH IS not a far left progressive. She’s closer to cent where Biden is. Warren would have been far left.
I get Trump’s an idiot. But this is decency? Biden/Obama invaded Libya illegally, dropped record drone bombs on 7 countries, fueled Syrian/Yemeni conflict with arms and left 100,000 dead brown people. Seriously wondering if humanity doesn’t extend to non-Americans.
Bleeding liberal here. Biden/Obama admin invaded Libya illegally, dropped record drone bombs on 7 countries, fueled conflict in Yemen and Syria and left 100,000 brown ppl dead. But sure, speaking well is so important you forget about war and murder.
I get you can’t vote for Trump. I’m a liberal too. But calling Biden decent and humane? Obama/Biden invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries in record numbers, fueled Yemen and Syrian conflict and left 100,000 dead brown people. Does your humanity not extend to brown ppl?
No new country was invaded for the first time this century.  The Dems savage Trump for being a “threat to humanity”  100,000 brown people died from Obama/Biden wars and drone bombing in Libya, Syria &amp; Yemen.  The Dems? Endless praise and voting for more.  Posturing assholes
Yeh...just like the deep state dumbasses biden..Harris...Schumer..Pelosi...r going to "really" change things for the better...this time.. really ? just vote for Trump..do yourself &amp; your family a favor...Trump has done more in 3  years than the last 4 puppets put together, awake!
- Biden is leading in 5 of the top 6 battleground states and the other one he is tied with Trump.   - His current average overall approval rating is 43.4%  If you don’t believe the polls, okay so be it, but he’s blatantly making shit up here. Come on now lol be better.
When we read this headline.   BIDEN/HARRIS WIN WHITE HOUSE.
Ok, I had a tear in my eye listening to both speeches. It was hope for what’s likely to come. Biden was good, but Harris was stellar.
Majority of Americans (even 49% #Democrats) think   would not finish first term if elected  #tcot #gop #migop
Out-of-touch #Democrat  thinks helping Americans through this pandemic equates to war on Social Security  #tcot #gop #migop
After the 50th lie poured out of Biden’s mouth, I had to change the channel. Therefore never heard a single word Harris had to say; oh well. No loss.
My mistake Cher.  That's supposed to say if there is one. Cher. Do yo think your friend Joe Biden is going to be President? Just curious Cher.  Me I have this really really good feeling that he will be.  And my feelings usually have been accurate. So now do you think he will be?
Kamala Harris won't stop talking about Beau Biden, it's very suspicious that she would spend this much time talking about a dead person. Possible ties to necromancy? - The Gray Fox
Question: Obama/Biden invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries, fueled conflict in Yemen and Syria and led to 100,000 dead brown people. Does compassion only extend to American people? How can a liberal vote for this warmongering?
I understand you’re excited. But where’s the justice for the 100,000 people who died from Obama/Biden invasion into Libya, drone bombing seven countries and fueling arms to destroy Yemen? Does compassion and healing not extend to brown people, Rabbi?
Because, for better or worse, the model is now becoming a major part of the story. You can't reliably model this election, but now people will think Biden has an easy path. They shouldn't, but we know they will, which makes the model a significant variable.
missing major point &gt; the Media is going to be working w Biden Harris - and will cover for them - they will have 98% media support
The presidential race has really heated up now that Harris will run as Biden's VP, but there is still work to be done now and well after Nov. ➡️Communities of color are still asking for police reform/abolishment ➡️The injustice to Breonna Taylor has yet to be rectified (1)
Hmmm, Joe Biden has chosen the first female Redguard VP.. -The Gray Fox
Wow Harris and Biden huh, that’s pretty cool :) love the direction our country is going
Please add Joe Biden to the mix.
I'm not gonna pretend that Biden, any dem or a politician is squeaky clean. I'm not naive. That said, we've seen trump enrich himself and his cronies right out in the open. How many of the small business loans went to his friends and himself.
That is frickin halarious. You know Biden could do that cuz clown donald can barely make it off the news conference stage without holding onto a wall or column. Watch trumpy when he exits from a stage. His balance is way off; something not right there.

This #nastywoman will vote for Biden-Harris 2020. Vote Blue if you’re Nasty!
Yeah, but is Biden a Slytherin or a Gryffindor? These are the important questions we should be asking.
VP Biden and Sen Harris are both centrist Democrats  🤦🏻‍♂️
Without guns maybe Dick wouldn't shoot people by mistake. And...the taxes are mostly on the Rich. The stocks will crash  again in the Fall due to COVID. Biden can't raise taxes anyway until things get better. The GOP takes from the Poor and working poor and gives to the Rich.
I assume I'm considered a "house-wife" since I stay home to raise my son and finish my multiple degrees. But I can say that trump got it very wrong. This "house-wife" (I hate this term) is voting for Biden/Harris!!!

Most Americans r not that stupid, biden? Somatic narcissist dumbass..Harris a covert narcissist mirrors everyone...what? MSM has deceived many to hate Trump...the spirit is called leviathan ...Jezebel/narcissist have this spirit also..it twist truth

Typical Donald 🤪. Notice he called her nasty and mean ... he insults all women. I think he meant she was HIS number one pick for Biden. As in "the worst pick".
Attacks on Joe Biden have fallen flat so those hoping for his failure—progressives and conservatives alike—are targeting Kamala Harris with sheer aggression and malice.

Trump is 3 years younger than Biden..weighs 75 pounds more..Biden can ride a bicycle..Trump would die within 30 seconds trying to ride a bicycle..so the death mongering is ridiculous..
So you don’t care about the warmongering from Biden/Obama admin that invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and led to 100,000 brown people dying? You dont care about dead brown people? you don’t care about innocents being jailed under Kamala?
Joe Biden is a secret Muslim? What happened? Did Obama secretly convert him? Did Obama convert Biden over to Marxism as well? Is Scranton, PA really part of America? Joe! Where's your birth certificate?
Yes!!!  Is that suppose to scare us? That’s part of why I am voting for Biden/Harris.
He is, but he also realizes that he needs his voters to support Biden or trump will win again
We are not listening to anything coming from a Biden camp.
The real sad thing about this Biden/Harris ticket is that as a Palestinian there really is no good option for president. Both candidates and their VPs are unabashedly pro-Israel and don't even attempt to hide it with the typical two state solution lines.

So many wonderful jobs open for so many wonderful people with the Biden administration 🇺🇸 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBidenHarris2020
Right! Biden proved he’s a real man.
“ sent word to Biden’s team that while she was flattered, she no longer wanted to be considered for the running mate slot, according to a high-ranking Democrat familiar with the process. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman”
Wasn't that long ago Harris said that Biden was a sexist and molested women...so these things are no longer true?
I take it this means Harris no longer believes that Biden is a racist and a sexist...my how opinions change when you're bought off.
You actually asked Joe Biden that Cher? What was his answer? You couldn't be any happier Cher.  Im as happy as a clam or better. Look I'll show you how happy I am that Joe picked Kalama. 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😛😛🤩🤩😀😀😀😅😅😅😄😄😁😁😁😁😆😆😆😆😆🙃🙃🙃🙃😜😜😜😜. I even did a flip.
Loved meeting you back in 2018 Abdul. I think you’re right on this. I hope you also keep forcefully pushing the Biden campaign on Medicare4all since that is one of the main reasons I was a huge supporter of you back then.
Biden had a cheat sheet on his desk so he wouldn’t forget where he was. Also, is holding the phone upside down. . .
I wince when I hear people who support abolition movements toward ICE and defunding the police cheering on Biden's VP pick, who will set those movements back a generation. #KamalaHarris
You LIAR Biden is not against NRA yes background test and Ar47, etc
Every Dem who has opinion about Biden and Harris:   Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.   You’re arguing about a fart when someone shit on your white carpet and then walked through it 9,428,016 times.   Grow up.
I know isn't great Cher.  Im so so happy. I tweeted her to send my congratulations to her. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are to do a great job. In fact they right now doing a great Birthday. Trump is already running scared. He knows that Biden has the upper hand and may just win.
Amen, Jason. Amen. With Biden in the WH, Elizabeth Warren will have her day. Good things ahead. We just need to get out the vote. 🇺🇸#BidenHarris #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt
Was......Ridin with Biden:-(((( til he chose Krapala
I hope you will run again for Governor of Georgia again or take a Cabinet position in the Biden administration.
I feel like she's a good antithesis to Biden, and that they can round each other out a little more. I think she'll help capture more voters who want somebody with a harder edge.
Not only is  incredibly smart and thoughtful, she’s a great mentor for so many Latinas in politics. The Biden-Harris team is in good hands! #TheFutureIsLatina
I sincerely hope you will be part of Biden administration in order to bring back the level of intelligence, dignity, moral character and honesty this country enjoyed during the Obama years, then we can truly make America again.
I want the two party system dismantled and new people brought into office more than anything, but when our currently leader is beginning to mimic HITLER? there’s only so much you can do.  I will be voting Biden and Harris in November, because I’m scared not to. you should be to.
This isn't the first time that the GOP has outright lied about what our candidates have said. Just the other day, Michigan Republicans said that Biden wants to defund the police–when he has literally said the opposite in a June 10th Op. Ed.
I'm sick of people telling me to vote for Biden because he can be dragged to the left. The DNC rigged 2 primaries to avoid progressive policy. They sure as hell aren't going to cave to it when they are in power! #VoteGreen2020 #GreenMovement #DemExit2020
I already know Biden/Harris isn’t the most ideal ticket right now. I voted for Bernie Sanders and I held out hope Biden would choose Warren as his VP. Don’t want to hear any negativity now. I just want you to vote for #BidenHarris so we can #DumpTrump
Remember when Trump told Chris Wallace there’s no enthusiasm for Biden. Keep thinking that, big guy.
If you are spending today not criticizing the literal warmonger Biden who invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and left behind 100,000 dead brown people, quit with your social media posturing.
My dream was Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang and here we are with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris...
How did ‘holding them accountable’ work when Biden/Obama invaded Libya leaving thousands dead or drone bombed seven nations? There ain’t no excuse to vote for a war criminal. Atleast Trump hasn’t invaded a new country.
Biden/Obama bombed seven countries, destroyed Libya and drone bombed merrily. Kamala prosecuted innocent people. You don’t have to do this. Disagreements are fine but not with a warmonger and a criminal top cop.
More important question: Why did she endorse Biden after calling him a racist segregationist and saying she believes the women who accused Biden of sexual misconduct?
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate
okay in all seriousness kamala was a dogshit pick even before police brutality came up in the discourse again. her history as prosecuter, DA and AG is a bad look but is great when juxtaposed with “minimum sentencing” biden, the DNC continuing to push lukewarm dipshits who are...
This ad is basically an own goal, eh.  So far, you've spotted Biden/Harris 3 goals and there's 8 minutes left in the 3rd period.
Biden picking Harris as his VP is the most bone headed, tone deaf move he could have possibly made. He just made it way harder for me and I’m sure many other true progressives to want to vote for him.
Okay. All hands on deck. What Joe wants Joe gets! Biden/Harris it is 🇺🇸 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #BidenHarris2020
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist?
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist?
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist?
Hi I'm just tweeting you to CONGRATULATE you on recieving the highest honor for any woman thus far.  Joe Biden selected you to be his running mate. That is great news. You and Joe Biden will make a great team as our President ( Joe Biden ).
Oh my Gosh they are throwing everything in the mix to try to get this idiot elected!!! Let’s see if this really happens when the TRUMP Administration is our and BIDEN is in!!!
Yes Cher this is a time to celebrate and dance around with love in our ❤❤❤❤💘💘. Because it is the day that Former Vice President Joe Biden selected Sen Harris as his running mate. All of us woman should all go and play your song WOMANS WORLD.  It would sound perfect now.Joe Biden is the right guy to coordinate the rehab of our government. I hope he calls on all the living ex-Presidents for council, and expect he will.  He is also the right man to take Trump out behind the woodshed &amp; make sure he faces consequences. 2/5
Is this the right ticket for right now?  Yes. Yes, it is.   Joe Biden is the right man to apologize to our allies for Trump.  He has the right motivations &amp; respect. He is doing this for Beau. And he is doing this for the American people. He has the relationships &amp; sincerity. 1/5
Biden actually did help right the 1994 crime bill. It’s a valid critique. But at least he now acknowledges the issues of the justice system unlike who we have now. So his statement is bull.
Didn’t the USPS workers union endorse Biden/Harris?  I’m sure they will just do their jobs and not be biased in any manner 🥴
She’ll be the kiss of death to Biden campaign.
Man, I can't believe Biden said that shit 😡😡😡
Historically vice president were opposites to their president. Really thats all she needs to say of she wants to keep the narrative that there is really any substantial difference between her and biden, or between them and Republicans for that matter. They're the same. Viels off.
Ignore him.  He’s trying to steal attention away from Biden &amp; Harris.
I'm pressuring Joe Biden to support liberal policies by attacking anyone who criticizes or pressures Joe Biden into supporting liberal policies.
crawl on my hands and knees over broken glass to get to the polls and vote for Biden/Harris.
If you want to see Trump defeated in November, spare a couple of dollars for the Lincoln Project.  Their ads are stronger than anything the Biden campaign dare put out there.
I agree.  A majority in my state decided to change the law to allow all voters to vote by mail if they choose. I am 70 years old and was counting on voting by mail in November. Now, I plan to risk my health to go to the polls to ensure my Biden/Harris vote counts no matter what
Much needed change when Biden and Harris win  the ticket. And there is no longer the likes of people like you wandering the peoples White House halls any more.
Maybe you should get someone to read this to you since you're unaware of it. It's Joe Biden's iPad on January 27th regarding the pandemic
OMG I'm listening to you right now read your notes about Biden ignoring scientific evidence regarding the virus and following left-wing liberals. You need to listen to yourself.. you're the one trying to stop testing to keep number low to let people die.
Biden: 'A Black Woman Will Become President Over My Dead Body'  via
I agree with you!  POTUS will win big. I am one of the silent majority but I am building up the courage to put my TRUMP/PENCE sign in my front yard. Just on my street in my small town so many have their signs out. I have not seen one Biden sign.🇺🇸
That may be true, but the goal is to keep Biden from being elected. What do we do RIGHT NOW?!
She's just Biden her time 'til November.
What Joe Biden and that lady one state to make it mandatory to wear mask is taking your rights away once you take your rights away from that they’ll go after the other right they’ll be able to come in your home at any time they want
Joe Biden that lady can shut their mouth they don’t have the right to tell people what to do this is not a Third World country we we can do what we want we don’t have to wear a mask if we don’t want
Lol, the Dems are already getting rid of Biden?
President? So you know that Biden is a place holder???
Ask her about how she thought Biden was a creep, you know before she was selected to run with him
I wonder where the enthusiasm is for Biden.
real unfortunate that a vote for anyone other than trump is a vote for biden :-/
Biden already released a statement trying to help take credit for it. Now that's hilarious.
What a big difference between these two men. Trump needs a walker to walk. While Biden is cruising around town on his bike
friendly reminder that donald trump used to donate to democratic political campaigns. most notably hillary clinton, joe biden, and kamala harris 🙃
Disappointed by losing his Zionist backers, disappointed Adelson hasn't donated yet, and frustrated Israeli leaders say they will accept a Biden win, Trump delivered this prize to Israel in hopes of regaining Zionist votes.
This is nothing.. today someone replied to me saying.. Biden will be weak on COVID not like Trump... ( I’m guessing he/she works for the virus team, maybe??)
I told my 8yo daughter that when Biden gets elected, we will have our first female VP.  She was so excited.
Joe Biden will be 78 in November.
During the primaries, Biden and Harris were probably my last 2 choices for who I wanted to get the nominations. I can’t say I’m a huge fan of the ticket. But you have to be delusional to still be able to turn a blind eye to all the garbage from the other side of the aisle.
Nah. This is a big deal:    This is a bigger deal:
What Trump is doing is wrong wrong wrong.  If mail in voting is made unsafe by this madman, I will crawl over broken glass and risk COVID to vote for Biden/Harris.  Trump will be a one term wrecking ball.
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris for VP | Sterling K. Brown #theDailyShowWithTrevorNoahEarsEdition   via
A presidential primary campaign and many hit pieces from leftist breitbart dot com later, and it’s seen as “the sky is falling” for progressives when Joe Biden picks Harris has his running mate
I think so also. Both of them have a personality or character flaw that's out to destroy. I remember Biden's debate with Paul Ryan. Biden was vicious &amp; I think Kamala will be like that also. They are the combination that, if elected, will bring down America. Voters remember this.
Pushing the left even farther away with your “suck it up” and vote for Biden/Harris strategy.
She did not make a threat, she made a statement that isn't too far fetched since Biden is very old &amp; fraile now &amp; can hardly put 2 sentences together.
Hmm ok these are bad policies to back, so I probably wouldn't be a fan of hers or Biden, but I'm going to vote for them this upcoming election so that we don't end up with Trump
Biden doesn't know where he is. I'd be embarrassed to defend him. #WheresHunter
I just want to see how the Liberals act to the critics that talk about Harris having descendants that owned slaves . Also about her accusing Biden being a sexual harasser &amp; now he’s the cats meow . If this was a conservative, the Libs would be marching &amp; crying .Tad hypocritical
Watching her spew one lie after another is laughable.  She is a lot like Joe Biden, because just like Basement Joe she is also delusional and detached from reality.
Kamala Shaves Head In Preparation For Meeting With Biden  via
We are going to have a Conservative majority in November. You sex workers should vote for Trump. Because under a socialist regime of Biden and Harris you will no longer be making money. You will have your financial assets seized by the government.
It will be funny when the Biden,Harris campaign talks about trump and his family donations to Kamala
Please can we all just agree to vote for Biden/Harris. Please. I don’t care if he’s not the perfect choice but really, he’s the better one. Get this fucking tangerine out of the spotlight.
So explain Biden today? What's that, you can't? Congrats on becoming a complete hack.
He is a known commodity. Obama remains the countries most popular President and Biden was a part of that.
What a disgusting Whiskey voiced hag.  Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back  via
On March 16, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made an unprecedented promise mid-debate: to choose a woman as his running mate, no matter what.    ☝️
And that’s the reason people like you . Cannot come into power . I predict you will leave Washington in a pine box . With that bobble head for Soros Biden and Obama. You will reap what you sew. Tread lightly
Did i say conservatives are good? I just don’t like socialists that weaponize race to their advantage. If you don’t vote for Biden you’re not black 👍🏼
Say trump and Biden are switched in this situation. What do you think people like you and liberal media’s would do with information. The DNC, hypocrisy at its finest.
Every woman I know who lives in the suburbs (it's not 1957, dude) thinks you are contemptible and is voting Biden/Harris.
Joe Biden and this lady are only going to screw our country up
Joe Biden and this lady don’t know what they’re talking about people need to open their eyes excuse me Black people are not the only people on this planet
Oh yeah Joe Biden and Obama stopped a bola
Dude this lady accused Joe Biden of being racist before?
Do people actually believe that Joe Biden will do anything for the United States he’ll do nothing but raise taxes trumps done more for us
Joe Biden says he’ll fix the country what it yeah race Texas defund the military take away your Second Amendment and then there goes your head remember right you people have to realize he is he is not going to be in control he’s just a puppet
I’d like to watch my news not Joe Biden he thinks people are crazy if they’re going to get rid of the Second amendment of people that allow Will not allow it
Joe Biden I could give you shit you don’t need no money need to go to an old folks home
I’d like to watch my News not see old man Biden on my TV screen I don’t like him go to an old folks home
Not voting for Joe Biden or you just screw the United States up
And I agree but a vote for Biden just because of him being “the lesser evil” isn’t going to make our country any better sure historically third parties don’t win but who says we can’t change that?
Our President Biden has never done anything like that.  Lies. We know this. So look to your tin god Trump.
Well Joe Biden becomes president there goes the world higher taxes higher food military lower military cuts and then will probably get taken over by another country
Man am I bummed Biden didn't pick Marianne Williamson.
Just read that Giuliani's daughter has endorsed Biden/Harris.
I have been in the resistance day one. I have Phone banked for months for Biden &amp; Democrats. I started a 501(c)(3) nonprofit called Vote Voiced to GOTV in MI. I am the Voter Engagement Chair of the Western Wayne County Branch of the NAACP in Michigan.  #Vote2020
Watching Joe Biden school Sarah Palin in 2002 was a historical high point in politics.  Pence vs Harries is going to be the pinnacle! Never have we seen 2 candidates so unevenly matched. I cannot wait to see Harris decimate Pence. I hope he cries.
Trump thinks that everyone who lives in the suburbs is as racist as he is.  He's wrong.  Trump Revives Racist Appeal To Suburbs After Biden Chooses Woman Of Color For VP  via
Trump lowkey not wrong about Biden I’d never vote for him even if I could vote 😭
She locked up more poor blacks on petty drug charges than almost any other prosecutor in the US. And who made that possible for her? Joe Biden.
It wasn't that long ago when the Democrats had 24 choices.  They voted for Biden.  Sanders and Williamson supporters now have three choices: Biden, Trump or throw away your vote.  Compare Biden to Trump and make your own decision.
maybe its because every democrat has run on reducing freedom of religion, and taking away at least some guns.  Biden and Kamala both have.
According to Trump, Biden will hurt God. So Biden is powerful.
You will raise taxes greatly and billionaires will leave and take their money with them. Sorry, Mr. Biden.
God, I wish Biden and Harris were half as radical as these hysterical right-wingers like to pretend
You have sat on your very large and prominent perdonker dunk and murdered 170,000 innocent Americans. Your inaction killed a lot of suburban mothers children and loved ones. These wonderful suburban women will vote for BIDEN/HARRIS to save this country from you.
Not surprised Biden picked Kamala Harris for VP, because before you fuck kids, you gotta lock their parents up. #BidenHarris2020 #SniffEmNFuckEm2020
THE #Democrat Party stood for racism long before Trump switched to the Republican Party and put AMERICA first.  While Biden still thinks China "isn't so bad". China is pulling for a Biden Inc. to win. Where's Hunter?
Lmao. And just like that the Biden Campaign gives up on a state with a population less than than the city of Detroit. And there goes a whopping 3 electoral votes. Lol.
And now the of rest  the story, China Joe will be unable or unwilling to mount a campaign. IF Biden INC won't debate, where will the #Democrat Party be? Harris campaign was at 2%, TWICE what Hunter's father's 1%. Economy MUST fail, schools CANT't open.  Or Trump will WIN WIN WIN!
God damn it, my dad is gonna ask me any day if "you SJWs are happy about Biden's VP pick"
Oh really. Cry me a river, knuckle draggers.
A sign of the times. Remote meetings. Glad to Biden is a Apple guy.
Instead of Trump Ag bribes that solve few problems, and are skewed to ag industrialization, let’s have a real plan to address the core problems that confront retaining the family farm.  Kamala Harris joining Biden ticket is a win for rural Iowa and farmers

I thought Biden would pick nitWhitmer because she has less baggage than others
Trump campaign tweets mugshots of alleged criminals, all of them Black, to claim Biden is pro-crime  via   Trump's entire staff is criminal and they are all walking free to include HIM
I mean she also called Biden a racist very recently if were gonna go fact digging around irrelevancies. Oh wait one deals with donations to an attorney general and the other deals with the fact that the newly appointed Democratic VP candidate called her running partner a racist.
But that same woman called Biden a racist as well 🤔 interesting
a RW hold on the SCOTUS for a generation if RBG retires, corporate control on policy, increased income inequality, loss of 1st am rights &amp; police reform are on the ballot not just Biden&amp; Trump. Purity tests &amp; disillusion arent justification enough to risk the suffering 45 causes.
So 2020 election is boutta be Joe Biden/ Kamala Harris or Trump/Pence,,,-
"Joe Biden is a racist!" - Kamala Harris
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
So if voting independent is a vote for Trump or a vote for Biden, then why vote independent at all? They don't want you to cause its easier to divide, control, and conquer when it's two.
At this point, he would simply look like a copycat.  Still, I always thought he would if Biden did, so maybe.
i hate that biden and harris and trump and pence are our only god damn options i hate america
I guess this will help Biden carry California! 🙄
He already has.
I want this for Biden’s cabinet. Cuz I feel like the monstars can also be rehabilitated at this time, as well.
Biden campaign statement/announcement on VP pick
Trump campaign &amp; RNC statements on Biden’s VP pick, Sen. Kamala Harris:
is rattled.    President Trump blasts Biden’s VP pick, Kamala Harris, as 'meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful' senator
Biden's been around about 40 years in politics, including VP. Still waiting for the fierce leadership.
Keep in mind everyone that during the biggest racial uprising since the late 60’s, the  is going with the Author of the crime bill in Joe Biden which unjustly targeted and incarcerated vast numbers of minorities in this country.   And...
Those who will still not find relief in a Biden/Harris administration.
please. i don’t care how you feel about biden or kamala harris. PLEASE don’t vote third party. get trump out of office
Biden should not agree to a debate until Obese Orange releases his taxes
Agreed. That being true, I would vote for her over Trump or Biden in a heartbeat.
She isn’t my first choice. Neither is Biden.   But I do respect her &amp; believe she will make a great leader, when it comes to that.  Also, she’s 55, so if she does a great job &amp; earns our votes, she might provide a steady &amp; capable presence in DC for the next 12 years.
I saw your grandson Owen at the local pitch  n’ putt. Was upset to see the Apple had fallen far from the tree. He wore a shirt that said ByeDon! Libtard can’t even spell Biden!
Plus I heard.  ( not sure if it's true or not yet.) Biden said a while back, "He needed a vice president that can take charge an control. When he quits 6 months after being elected."
If Joe Biden becomes president we have to look for higher taxes business is shutting down the virus is spreading more higher cost-of-living going up in peoples paycheck not going up he is Do not elect him as president
Is Joe Biden choosing a black woman to Con Black people down?
Vote for Biden! Wink, wink.
While I would have preferred Elizabeth Warren as VP, I respectfully disagree with your assessment. I think independents and Never Trumpers are more than fine with Harris. If a conservative academic still prefers Trump over Biden/Harris IMO they were a lost cause to begin with.
If people actually believe these commercials that are run by Joe Biden blaming the president Donald Trump for everything they’re not using common sense
You just don’t like trump Joe Biden is too old
Oh good Joe Biden has someone to change his diaper
Trump has done more for the United States than any other president has in the past Joe Biden How we need to diaper change every four minutes?
Trump has done more for the United States than any other president has in the past Joe Biden How we need to diaper change every four minutes

The Kamala Harris VP pick will make liberal suburban wine moms happy but is probably the nail in the coffin for a widespread progressive vote.
At this point "can they speak coherent sentences" is the bar. I don't think Biden/Harris is perfect, but it's fine for now (I would've preferred Warren).   Also, glad he didn't pick Whitmer b/c we need her to stick around Michigan.
welp, there it is. I’m in for the Biden/Harris and I’m not happy about it
In 2018 I tweeted the ticket will be Biden/Harris. I am proud to see that come true today!   I’m voting  &amp;  on November 3rd! 🗳✅ #BidenHarris2020
joe biden and kamala harris the duo we never asked for but will settle
Awww poor Stretchin’ Gretchen!  Well shit, I’m not voting for Biden, I’ll tell u that right now. No way am I changing Kamala Harris becoming president.

Biden Harris 2020 officially. Great choice
Biden supporters don’t give a shit about what offends Trump.
First they have to pass the Biden Basset smell test
“It got so bad Joe Biden went on a bike ride the other day with a mask on” ignored the reporter that was so close to him Biden had to ride around him! And that he was riding in a group and SS detail must stay within 6 feet to protect him. So yes Biden was appropriate to wear one!
TEXT OU812 to find out FIRST who is DEFINITELY MAYBE going to be Biden's VP
I used too. I admit it. Now I wave it proudly with my Biden 2020 yard sign. We're all Patriots.
Love Biden the way I love Obama!  I will fight for him all the way!
Love Biden!  💙💙💙
Seeing that there are more Women voters than Men I would say this is just another colossally stupid statement. Mentioning Race is just typical racist trump.  Trump claims ‘men are insulted’ because Biden might pick a Black woman vice president
Money older than joe biden
LGBTQFUBARPCBS !  Biden to Ensure His Presidency ‘Addresses the Unique Needs of…Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Women’
I would love a Biden/Harris ticket!
My God, Politco really is putting hit pieces on every VP candidate aren't they. None of the main contenders, especially not Kamala or Whitmer would cost Biden any state. It's crazy to say and think that would happen. People vote for the nominee, not the running mate.
It's very possible this isn't related to Biden, but if it is, I have no idea what this means. Maybe a speech together? Maybe Cabinet meetings. Maybe recording something for the Convention? South Bend is also really close to Michigan, so maybe it's not even Pete.  No idea.
They won't announce the VP until after they announce Biden's replacement!
According to who?
Maybe Joe Biden will use the Toimb of the Unknown Soldier.    I am not serious but can you imagine the backlash that would  happen?
basically anyone but Biden would be a lock LOL the guy cant do press
Also, in case you haven't noticed, Bernie is working with Biden.
I think it's important for this country to survive and that only happens if Trump is not in control of this country.  Frankly if you think Trump and Biden are the same, you are WAY not paying attention.  Biden earned votes. Obviously Bernie didn't, or he'd be the nominee.
Boo hoo. Where has Bernie been during the BLM protests?  Kamala has been out there protesting, and working her ass off.  For her record, the receipts have been brought time and again to prove stories on her are wrong. I'm voting Biden no matter who is VP is. Can you say the same?
I seen the fist Biden sign near me and it’s a big banner I was shocked to see next time I drive past I’ll get a picture
This is the only part of their base that has any energy to it. They need it, because Biden is doing nothing for any of them. Everytime Biden talks, Trump gains voters back. This is all they got.
All Lies  nice try and keep watching CNN and other networks that just bush the Liberal agenda.  Biden = Communism!!!  The True Russia hoax.
is / was an  advisor to Joe Biden for the debates.
Biden is also for cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
You just feel stupid because Biden's actually saying racist crap. We don't have to spin it.
Biden is covered with Byrd droppings
Who tf is confident in Biden lol
Well this is where you lose me as your fan. You will lose your ability to make money under a Joe Biden dictatorship. Trump is the one that can save America as we know it . Let me say this any openly lefty Trans will not be supported by me. I rather not know your politics.
I wouldn't mind you following me, you being a  Wrestling fan. Had you not openly declared yourself for Biden and against Trump. Such stupidity by someone following my account will not be tolerated without a rebuttal. So consider yourself rebutted. Have a nice day.
Your  hero  Barack Obama (who's the actual heel along with Biden and virtually the entire Democratic Party) you want to use wresting terminology for this current e? Then Trump &amp; his supporters are the Faces, the heroes.
Biden is such an ass even his campaign ads he talks about doing everything that Trump has already done you mean to tell me people watching the ads don’t know that?
Since the Trump campaign is endlessly running the ad where Mr. Biden says something stupid, will this recording come up during the race? During the debates?  Trump On Tape: I Grab Women "By The Pu**y”  via
All the more reason we don't want nor need Joe Biden.
Amy I don't care who he picks. What I want is for everyone to stand and vote for Biden no matter who he picks. Cable news will dissect her to death. Ugh!
Oxygen? Here’s Joe Biden riding a bike...when was the last time Trump’s fat ass got on a bike?
These EO's are dead on arrival on Monday. But here's a thought for the brainless Magat's. For laughs let's say this walking colostomy bag gets away with this. When Jan 20th comes Biden by EO can erase the Cap on SS. Repeal all of trumps tax law. Make space force disappear..
We know that. Milano is a Biden supporter. What do you expect.
Awww.. poor dear.  Did someone ruffle Trump’s reputation?  Deservedly so..  Kanye has admitted that it’s only to pull votes for Biden, so...
So when are we gonna find out who is Biden's running mate?
I'm sure Biden will not have any boat parades.
Biden supports basically none of the policies that Sanders supports and from the bottom up any dumb fucking asshole who insists otherwise knows nothing about them beyond their name and listed party. Just sad that one of those fucks is the president...
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
I hope she can. Because quite frankly under Biden and his  minions we will all have less freedom to do just about anything including you  Arielle Scarcella. My one hope is that you vote for Trump in November and save America as you know it. Because  the new America would be scary
Madam Speaker, why are the 2 Rep's that are helping Putin funnel negative propaganda about Biden still allowed to serve on the senate?  When are you all gonna hold Trump and his gang accountable for their treasonous acts, and not to mention the Kanye fiasco....Enough us enough!!
Calling it, by fall, there will be a real effort by the trump campaign to pull "youth support" away from Biden.
I believe what we see happening at the hands of Repubs is by design...a long game with big money and foreign power behind it.  If Biden wins and Dems hold the House and take the Senate, they will find a smoldering pile of ash left by Repubs because that's how they play.

Michigan republicans would vote for Biden to get Whitmer out of Michigan
Get Biden for America.. #Biden_is_Trump_vaccine
I want Harris... Whitmer is my state Governor.. she’s great... but Harris should be the VP , I see it essential step to boost Biden chances
😆 It’s pretty pathetic that the only dirt that the don trump campaign team could dig up on Biden was from 1987.
I thought you asked why Biden was excommunicated.
Biden literally said roe v wade went too far
Biden? Church?  I’m pretty sure he was excommunicated a while ago.
Biden is backing our governor how about you back US the residents of Michigan

😂  Future President Joe Biden will be elected.  He will take you out behind the woodshed &amp; make sure you are prosecuted   He’ll help set up a framework for fixing what you’ve broken  Then he’ll step aside &amp; we’ll have compassionate, intelligent leadership for the next 11 yrs 🇺🇸
Look, Joe Biden isn't racist. It's just his words, thoughts, actions and friends who are racist.
I thought only omnipotent God could hurt God.  Did Trump just call Biden God?
Trump claims Biden 'insulted the Black community' with remarks on Hispanic diversity  via   remind me again how many black people did Joe Biden try to stop from renting or buying properties in his building?
Trump claims Biden 'insulted the Black community' with remarks on Hispanic diversity  via   Trump should be called Mr. President Racist pig!If your not voting for President Trump because you don't like him, then thats like eating a dog turd because you don't like broccoli. If you are voting for Joe Biden because you think he's a moderate Democrat, then that's like eating a dog turd because someone told you to.
Kanye is Trumps and Kushners house N-word. Do you really think they are persuading him to run so West can win? Of course not...run house N-word, draw votes from Biden-Harris and watch Trump continue to decimate Black and Brown communities that he has done virtually nothing for.
No, it's not over the top of you understand history and frankly I grew up when a worst president was given two terms. And my apparent goals keep getting destroyed by people like Biden &amp; harris
Biden used a small vetting team to help decide his VP pick.
And THAT is only going to help Biden/Kamala. Your vote would be wasted. Please don't do that with November's vote!
Yeah, they found the DA had done NOTHING WRONG except the fact he was investigating the company where Biden's son worked. He was NOT CORRUPT like Joe had stated he was!
See what President Trump's son, Eric says about Biden's pick for VP.
At least a Biden Cabinet will reflect what America is, not who look and act like Trump. Competent people.
I am truly concerned this is a small step and foreshadowing to potential attempts at Obama/Biden indictments. The concurrent and impending corruption from this Administration just kills.
Biden didn’t pick anything. He can’t form coherent sentences.
No, South Carolina picked Biden. The Party elites picked #AnyoneButAProgressive
Dr. Claudes powernomics is better than anything Biden/Harris could ever come up with. #IHearYouYe

Biden refused to support M4A.
And Biden still won’t support it 🙄
Joe Biden is a WHITE SUPREMACIST and will champion WHITE SUPREMACY with a SO CALLED BLACK FACE!
I agree with  here. You should intentionally mispronounce a name. However I don’t think people intentionally do that. Biden even mispronounced her name the other day and I’m sure he didn’t mean to
I’m not clear - is the suggestion that if Biden wins, he will force a federal policy of using prisoners for work crews? I thought that was only a California thing, not national.
He's got to be younger than Biden and Trump?
Y’all finna bait me into voting for Biden/Harris and then when I later on critique Biden/Harris y’all gonna go “but you still voted for them tho 🤪” and I’m not going.
Biden, while horrible, at least doesn’t have a track record of election fraud and voter suppression; it’ll be easier to primary him then to get Trump out after four more years of advancing overt fascism.
I see a number if people saying to vote third party and oh but Biden/Harris will be just as bad as Trump and I just shake my head and assume they are bots because LIKE IT OR NOT THIS COUNTRY IS ESSENTIALLY A TWO PARTY SYSTEM. SUCK IT UP AND VOTE (2/?)
Right! They just might get cussed out by Biden or Harris, and I’ll be here for it! A bully needs to get popped real good in his mouth to get back! #Kamala
Where in the world is Joe Biden?
Uh, no. People ONLY wear masks when at supermarkets. Outside just walking nobody cares. If the mandate Biden talks about requires me to wear a mask when going out for a run, I won’t comply bc I have been doing it for 4 months without an issue
are you struggling to say VOTER SUPPRESSION because that’s exactly what Trump is doing by handicapping #USPS! I just can’t wait to see how y’all give President Joe Biden the benefit if the doubt as you struggle to report on the criminal in the WH! Geez.

Campaigns usually preview their priority for major legislation, as Obama did with stimulus &amp; ACA. But Biden has been mostly negative &amp; event responsive so far (now mostly focused on COVID &amp; economy), so unclear how that would translate beyond whatever doesn’t pass from HEROES
Isn’t Joe Biden Racist For Mispronouncing ‘Kamala’?

Trump, Biden has to have more control of the system.  Trump just wants to give it oxygen.
You and Joe Biden. Together, you can make it happen!
The moral of the story is the planets and the sun they orbit are not in exact geometric proportions. It’s chaotic, and held together with gravity.   It’s a fucking miracle, and we’re lucky to be aware of the universe.   We would do well to vote for Biden and push his ass to ...

T is a terrible person. Things I’ve read about Biden is similarly just as bad. US has taken a definite dive over the course of more than just 4 years. And it’s going to be (doesn’t matter who’s voted in) another 4 years of trash. I hope 2024 we get people voting in primary’s

Sexist and racist????? Uhm didn't you dumbocrats openly pick the senator because of gender and race???? The associated press reported Gov. Whitmer even suggested to Biden that he should pick a black woman. So who is being sexist and racist again? The hippocracy is overflowing.
Jim Clyburn’s endorsement swung the SC vote totals emphatically enough to make Biden the frontrunner—and eventually, the nominee.   Biden bet his whole race on that. Bernie crossed his fingers and hoped enough leftists would turn out nationwide that it wouldn’t make a difference.
Warren’s polices were much better than Bernie’s and she got called a snake. The platform Biden’s eventually going to run with will have a lot of important planks—many out there by Sanders and Warren staffers.  If leftists call it “shit” and don’t vote? Just makes change harder.
Joe Biden is not “extremely conservative” lol

They want him removed because he has outlived his usefulness to them. They got their judges, now they want to discard trump and find a candidate that might have a chance to beat Biden. They just have to find someone who is just as big a tool as trump, without a side of dementia.
Joe biden sucks but trump is an existential threat to democracy so I am settling for Biden. #settleforbiden
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Biden/Harris voters 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
I think 2016 is a much better example of Bernie being cheated. This primary election, the moderate candidates simply consolidated behind Biden before Super Tuesday and the moderates outnumbered the progressives within the party
ahhh okay I misunderstood a tiny bit there. Yeah its weird that people will broadly support policies M4A (58% of primary voters in SC supported it but the state went for Biden for example) and I'd be interested in understanding why that disparity exists
I agree with all of these things as well. Im voting Biden because I think we have the best shot of getting those things under that administration and not our current one. But it's also true that a lot of Americans ARE very moderate and this ticket reflects that.
also some people dont look at policy for voting unfortunately. People recognize Biden from the Obama administration and want to return to an era of "stability", rather than pressing forward into unknown territory (socialistic policies) because they want to maintain their comfort
but the primaries are the opportunity for people to express this type of support. In Michigan, Biden won EVERY COUNTY. This is due to low voter turnout from our age bracket (18-28 voter turnout is 16%) skewing the country further right/moderate than what it should/could be.
Who I think Biden will pick for his cabinet IF he wins:  1. Secretary of State: Susan Rice 2. Secretary of the Treasury: Elizabeth Warren 3. Secretary of Defense: Pete Buttigieg 4. Attorney General: Val Demmings 5. Secretary of the Interior: Jamie Rappaport Clark
Trump organizers are knocking on doors and holding in-person events in Michigan, but  told me today Democrats don't feel its "practical or smart" to do the same for  just yet.
precisely. I just think it'll take a bit more time for the American populace to be "primed" for a socialistic/social democrat political leaning/president/etc. I can't be mad about Biden/Kamala because imo its much closer to reflecting the majority of Americans and their leanings
So we all know Trumps a POS...  and Biden’s held office for 40+ years and hasn’t created any type of change...  how did we get to this point again of voting for what YOU believe is to be the “lesser of two evils” VOTE THIRD PARTY #Joforpresident
Despite the OBVIOUSLY BULLSHIT that prisons have stocks and therefore are used for profit by pure common sense economics... It should worry people that we can’t let the Biden administration get away with this shit if he wins either. We are settling for Biden but we can’t leave 1/
Public university grads can do anything - including run for President, Vice President, and Governor.
The senior Biden advisor (&amp; former Bernie spox) cont'd:   "Wayne County are Black Voters. So, while the majority of the electorate in Michigan are not Black voters obviously we have to do real work in speaking to Black voters in Michigan—particularly in Wayne Co." #Election2020
As a real Christian, I'm offended that you are attacking Biden (Catholic) &amp; Harris (Baptist) as if your White Evangelical/Gnostic/Judaizer cult is of Jesus Christ. It's not &amp; you aren't of Christ. You don't support life as you support the Trump demonic leadership reign
They’re serving the broader coalition, which is necessary not only to enact progressive policy to defeat the literal actual fascism staring us in the face.   I think Biden’s a poor candidate, &amp; his nomination is a failure of the party. But I’d like there to be a 2024 election, so
Joe Biden just said yesterday Trump is causing chaos in the world   Today Trump announces peace in the Middle East

Whitmer's quick rise to national stage - &amp; Biden’s VP list - leaves Democrats happy she will remain governor, excited for future; it could open door to new donors for her 2022 reelection bid &amp; the battle for control of the Legislature

Did you think racist Biden would pick an African/American....Kam(comi)la's daddy's ancestor owned slaves
Views of Harris are unlikely to move voters or voter blocs, but could change impressions of Biden; prior running mates have had minimal &amp; fleeting top-line effects but have changed or mollified voters’ concerns about presidential candidates
Kamala Harris is a disgusting enabler.
It's pretty self explanatory to ANYBODY paying actual attention that Biden can barely string together a coherent sentence
She didn't threaten him. U ppl R freakin idiots. Do you have a thought of your own? ITS ABOUT BIDENS MENTAL DECLINE that Democrats will replace Biden with Harris &amp; he won't be on the ticket anymore. She did sleep her way 2 the top so it's not unlikely
It's supposed to be a clown train with Biden driving the clown train
#Resist #Election2020 #politics #Democrats2020 #Dump45 #Resistance #Elections2020 The 2020 phrase that should be banned already: “progressive enough.” It is diversionary and divisive. We support Biden/Harris, enthusiastically, because it is the right thing to do for our country.
I’m voting for Biden only because trump is an existential threat to our democracy but he needs to support Medicare for all. He said he would veto it should it ever come to his desk. Biden sucks but trump is obviously worse so I’m settling for Biden #settlingforbiden
Harris is the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket, and she and Biden noted the historical significance.
Do you think liberals will learn anything about electability when leftists don't vote for Biden in droves?
And you think that’s Biden?
Voting for Biden and Kamala just because they’re not Trump shows more problems of the Democratic Party than the Republican Party.

Biden’s vulnerability there is by _far_ his greatest strength as a candidate. I want a male leader willing to have those types of emotions on public display. “Manliness” as a construct in its current form needs to be buried forever.
According to a business I frequent once a week,  opinion was, won't vote TRUMP 2020. NEVER VOTE FOR BIDEN. It's Kanye or not vote for President. Just keep that vote untouched. Exactly, what GOP WANTS! THREE candidate mess splitting ticket again like past with Perot.
Biden and Kamala showcase the worthlessness of their opinions and accusations.  Haven’t they devalued accusations of sexual assault, racism, and bad policing?   Politicians need to be more honest and righteous.
I googled antifa and no references to Biden came up.  What do you do with lying reporters asking lying questions to a lying president?
He's also supporting Biden,  so... He been a dip stick fur the left for years.
Trump has no idea how to even turn on a computer. He’s just jealous that Biden can make the “magic box” do things!
True... but if Two Supreme Court Justices are tapped to  say “STEP DOWN” because they were wrongfully put there that also could be a great choice after Biden places a Black Woman on the bench!

If you think Biden’s gonna try a Muslim ban, appoint conservative SCOTUS judges, invite foreign interference in our elections, gut the USPS, undermine NATO, build a wall, AND try to race-bait his way out of a pandemic, by all means don’t vote for him.
I'll bet you Jim Acosta &amp;  won't run one story with all the facts of what Kamala Harris said about Joe Biden during the debates? How she believed Bidens accusers, and now she doesn't? Yet she stated she believed Brett Kavanaghs accusers even after the FBI said no.
It's August 12th, day after Biden said "no" maybe made an offer to handle national ROADS as nuttin here yet!

Dems probably won’t get control of the Senate and Biden is moderate, so not much to worry about unless he... you know... (78 years old man)
As a suburban woman I’m sorry to tell you that I never went through with the wedding ceremony with my house. My partner and I (he was a life long Republican) will both be voting Biden/Harris in any event, so it’s not an issue.
I really think the Biden campaign is tone-deaf af, not necessarily malicious, because it feels like they’re pandering to Obama-era nostalgia that many democrats feel. I mean Biden only felt emboldened to run because of his relationship to Obama
A video has been released that appears to show the moment former vice president  asked Sen.  to be his running mate.
Reason 83 to vote Democrat: The third of Job Biden's plans to Build Back Better is to make child and parental care possible without devastating the long term finances of a family.
Trump is running ads on crime (79% of ads) &amp; protests/riots (31% of ads); Biden is running more diverse ads, focused most on COVID (69%) &amp; the economy (60%). Trump is only 12% positive vs. Biden 64% positive.
There's no defending her!! she comes from slave owners her family has benefited from the oppression of the African American and Jamaican people!!   she is still a slave driver She put them all in forced labor prison And so did Joe Biden  Research and wake the hell up
Nope. You frauds can try and sidestep the debates however you want, you know the president will knock Biden's dick in the dirt.
Can someone find me statistics on people who voted for Trump in 2016 but are voting Biden this year, vs people who voted for Hillary in 2016 but are voting for Trump this year? I’m willing to bet the latter can be counted in one hand while the former is in the thousands or more.
Choosing a non-centrist running mate is a departure for Democrats. But Biden &amp; Harris match a public that is more symbolically conservative but more liberal on policy. They propose more liberal policies without selling an ideological revolution, running instead on restoration
I know people absolutely hate Biden and Harris but as a gay person please for the love of god vote Trump and Pence out. They have been the absolute worst toward LGBT+ rights, really not a debate.
I'd be more scared that they have a HIGHER AA percentage then anywhere else since she incarcerated mostly AA on Weed charges &amp; gave the toughest sentences that Biden's bill was directly responsible 4 &amp; the fact the area is very religious 2. It had ZERO 2 do with Racism. Nada
i feel so split, on the one hand i completely agree that voting for biden/harris will not solve years of generational, systematic oppression (esp when harris is an opp herself!) but i also can’t stand people acting like it’s not the only option right now
Ben Shapiro: At this point, Trump is running against Harris not Biden
Biden is the racist 🐲
Not voting for Biden is a vote for trump !!
This does nothing to perpetuate the idea that Biden is unwell. He handled himself with class in the primary debates and the American public deserves to watch him debate Trump.
It has nothing to do with hope😂 there is a ZERO percent chance Betsy DeVos is a part of the next cabinet. There is a 0% chance Trump's postmaster general for the USPS is kept on. There is a 0% chance that Biden would appoint a conservative SCOTUS judge. These aren't guesses....

5 Takeaways On The New #BidenHarris Presidential Ticket
It makes me so sad and confused that people r actually voting for Trump or Biden.
The bottom line here is Trump can’t be elected president again. The only chance to stop that is voting for the Biden ticket.
All I’m gonna say is don’t say shit to black women OR sexual assault survivors for feeling hesitant about voting for Biden. Everybody else is free rein
Maybe to add a little spice in addition to the Biden/Trump and Harris/Pence debate, let’s have Doug Emhoff debate Karen Pence and Jill Biden debate Melanie Trump.
I'll take Biden pushing states and potentially the Senate to dems due to his consolidation and expansion of independent and even some right leaning voters over Bernie potentially winning the presidency and maintaining the current balance of Congress. thats just me tho
i hate the biden/kamala ticket as well, literally 2/3 of my least fav candidates from the primary (worst was Bloomberg obv), i just angy at people saying they won't vote at all because donald trump is the imminent danger imo. i said it earlier but im gonna be MUCH pickier in 2024
Everyone looks so dumb being mad at those who don’t wanna vote for Biden. Like be mad at everyone who got us here in the first place...misplaced anger babes :/

That is what they find for Palin:  But they find the Biden pick helped Obama (re-assuring voters about his experience).  Also, can sometimes split voters without helping or hurting. Paul Ryan made Romney gain with conservatives &amp; lose with moderates.

dems are force feeding us extremely problematic options and then jumping down everyone’s throats to “VOTE🤩✨” I’m not blind to the fact that we have to get trump out of office, but dems are being tone deaf acting like they’re entitled to our vote for biden/harris in the midst..
joe biden and trump are basically the same! even though joe is for $15 min wage, student loan forgiveness, has the most comprehensive climate change plan of any candidate from the primary, will have the opportunity to replace at least 1 supreme court judge...  my brain is smooth!
Sure, you're a closet Biden supporter 😉
Michigan  says #BidenHarris will bring ‘fierce leadership’ to White House
He was remembering how you enjoy his macaroni and cheese. Love your pic with Biden too. I am hopeful after this nightmare .
Trump is an existential threat and that’s why I will vote for Biden. Not because I think he will take our country in the right direction, but strictly harm reduction.
Interesting.  reports Whitmer told Biden’s team she no longer wanted to be considered for his running mate before her Aug. 2 flight to Deleware. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman.
Or maybe it's on Biden for not having policies that resonate with the progressive wing of the party.
NEW: In late spring, Whitmer said she no longer wanted to be considered for the VP. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman.  But Biden still wanted Whitmer in the mix, and he personally called her in mid-June to ask if she would continue. Whitmer agreed.
AP: Whitmer asked to be removed from veepstakes in late spring and recommended Biden pick a Black woman. But Biden still wanted Whitmer in the mix, and she agreed to second round of vetting.
They are very scared now. This was the perfect pick for Biden. He picked someone that is ready to be President. He picked someone that can bring unity back to this country. It’s ok if we never see eye to eye on things. But we still respected each other. First time I’m going Blue!
No longer under consideration as Joe Biden’s running mate, Governor Whitmer returns to micromanaging the state economy and our daily lives by issuing Executive Order #169 setting operating hours for grocery stores &amp; pharmacies.
Trump maintains a ~2% advantage in the Electoral College over the popular vote. He has a chance to win but Biden has a chance at a landslide. Economic conditions are quite uncertain &amp; more mixed than reported (due to stimulus income &amp; market gains)

I totally forgot about Hillary's awful running mate - Tim Kaine. That ticket was never going to win.  I don't like Kamala, and I cannot stand Biden - but I like what Democrats *think* Kamala is. If that makes sense.   No, it doesn't make sense! But I think they could win.
12 hours left. I’m hoping Biden leaks it pulls into the lead.
#TrumpOnHannity #Trump:We CAUGHT #Obama-#Biden uh that's why I didn't think that #SusanRice could get it cuz she's part of this whole #IllegalThing that happened which is one of the #WORST perhaps THEWorst #PoliticalScandal #InTheHistoryOfOurCountry.And #TheyGotCaught.#NowLetsSee
Yes she will raise him up:  Biden that is.
Very very disappointed in the selection of Biden’s running mate. But am I surprised? Never.
if she was smarter she would have dropped out and endorsed Bernie before super Tuesday, gotten the vp nod, trounced trump at the polls, then usurped the presidency Richard the 3rd style by pouring strychnine in Bernie's oatmeal. Now she has to watch Kamala do it with Biden :|
not all the best law schools are Ivies, but Harris and Biden went to crappy law schools!
Today we #Unite as Democrats behind our democratic nominees Biden/Harris to defeat Trump in November! We have significant work to do to win in the Midwest, this is going to be an incredibly close election within 3 points. Don't listen to the polls #DoTheWork  #BidenHarris2020
Poor Joe Biden, he's been forced further left than he's ever been, and he's been forced to pick a VP he doesn't want. Even, if he was all there mentally, this wouldn't be the way he wanted to become president.
You’re right, we need to see Biden pretend like he may choose a progressive VP, so that we can believe he really cares about the left
Honestly, the Biden/Harris ticket announcement gave me the shivers, I feel the energy go up my spine and I get goosebumps.  This is the winning ticket and you can feel that good history is going to be made!
I think that small percentage of Bernie voters that don’t vote for Biden will be smaller than didn’t vote for Hillary in 2016. We couldn’t survive 4 more years of trump and that has to be obvious to more people than in 2016. Imagine no more post office.
#AyaanHirsi, I'll follow you! You, a #DemocraticMuslim, showing HOW #BidenPolicy's interpreted by the #MuslimBrotherhood as #ApprovalOfShariaLaw! #Biden spoke WANTING #IslamicFaith 2B taught more often in #AmericanSchools BUT #ForbidsChristianity. #AmericaThisIsReal! #ItCANHappen
I think that the vast majority of us Bernie supporters are voting for Biden. I think the percentage that don’t vote for Biden will be smaller than didn’t vote for Hillary. Trumps so bad (160k dead is hard to ignore) that all Biden has to do is exactly what he is doing now.
joe biden really didn’t read the room huh
That is such a cool backstory to #KamalaHarris Tonight’s pick by #JoeBiden is a perfect example of selfishness &amp; patience. Harris chose to exit the presidential contest early. People were upset; but her selflessness stood out to Biden. #BidenHarris2020
A Biden/Harris ticket is interesting.  Like when my mom told my dad I got a C+ in a class, and his reply was “interesting.”  Kamala Harris threw everything she said and felt about Joe Biden out the window when she got tapped for VP nominee. How convenient!!!
What people fail to realize is, despite Harris’ and Biden’s policies, they are willing to listen to progressive, have a conversation in change.
Same for me, but you can leave Biden off.
joe biden say Build America Back Better  5 times fast challenge
Biden really chose a POC for VP who doesn’t even have the interests of POC in mind. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Of course  He's going to try an one up Biden But Can he find a stuckup person of color? Maybe  Ben Carson?
Lansing State Journal: Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his VP running mate
Somehow the right is so far gone that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden apparently aren’t moderates..........
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP. And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?). Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn’t get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
Democrat/Socialist 2020 Ticket   🥴   What a Pair! 😈  She Called Hiden Biden a Racist   🤪  Joe Forgot  😡  Both Threatening to Tax American Millions For New Green Deal   😧   Jobs Will Move Back To Their Friends in China  🇺🇸   VOTE President Trump &amp; Republicans Nov 3   🇺🇸
Like I do not like Biden or Harris but I do genuinely believe that he would be better than Trump, BUT we shouldn’t also be blindly allied with a party to not suffer. Third party gives me v “right idea wrong time” but I ALSO should not have to compromise.
Biden/Harris reinforces the likelihood that Democrats move substantially left on policy positions without embracing (&amp; sometimes explicitly challenging) a consciously ideological reinvention or an abandonment of the party’s traditional coalition of constituencies approach
idk what to do fr cause I understand both of the “vote third party” and “vote Biden” groups.
I asked state Sen. Adam Hollier about the historic nature of Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris.   It made him think of his 3-year-old daughter's first Halloween costume. She went as a president standing on a glass ceiling:
Dems were successful with a Dem Senator Veep candidate 4 times: Kennedy/Johnson (1960), Carter/Mondale (1976), Clinton/Gore (1992), Obama/Biden (2008). They were unsuccessful 4 times: Stevenson/Kefauver (1956), Dukakis/Bentsen (1988), Gore/Lieberman (2000), Clinton/Kaine (2016).
Lmao! Blind damn republicans! All about yourselves aren’t ya? We are all gonna vote Biden/Harris and givr America back to the people! Y’all are outta here 👋🏼
all these tweets are so funny but i can’t help but be angry that my only option as a decent human being is voting for a biden/harris ticket 🤡
Please remember that while Taylor supports Biden, Biden is still a disgusting rat.   BUT I would do anything for Trump to be out of the White House, that doesn’t mean I support everything Biden does.   In 2024, we need to learn and vote for not disgusting, rich, white men.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
my day has been ruined by joe biden with tits
Tweets that do mean more coming from someone who also just said he was voting for Biden, I suppose.
I’m ready! Kamala is ready, too! Go Biden/Harris!
It could also be read as saying “If these election results are wrong, it’s because we didn’t account for Trump cheating.” Which poses 2 problems 1.) it shows the analysts’ bias 2.) creates a false dichotomy— either Biden wins or Trump cheated.
I absolutely get the Kamala criticism. I do not like her, and I do not like Biden. I just don’t see how people are surprised?? I’m trying to think of the Supreme Court &amp; Covid response, and otherwise I’m trying to keep my energy local.
Biden is crushing in the polls. Harris does not change the polls in any way. Ben is triggered by this fact.
So who are y’all voting for If it isn’t Biden?
Biden sabotaging himself??? Maybe he knows he's not capable of being President? 🤔
That was the hint that it would be #KamalaHarris Biden wouldn’t have chosen  unless he knew Harris would be comfortable with her.
Really??? ANOTHER reason to vote Biden!
MSU legend Magic Johnson 'very happy' Kamala Harris is Joe Biden pick for vice president
I read this and thought this was political with all the Biden/Harris news.
KAMALA!!! Biden’s first big decision is a huge winner. America is the biggest winner. Our country finally just took a defining step into the future. It is a unifying pick that will enable the US to focus on the work ahead. FANTASTIC!#KamalaHarris

I’m not a Biden fan. But, committed to voting for the nominee against Trump. I don’t think KH is perfect, but want to hold space for the Black community (specifically  Black women) to celebrate a historic occasion. Even if there’s room for necessary criticism. We can do both.
Mike! I can’t wait to have you back serving our country again! I hope you answer the call in a Biden/Harris Administration. Thank you for your service and sacrifice.
Please get joe Biden to support Medicare for all. His current position is that he would veto it.
I would agree that her stance on healthcare might be more moderate than, say Bernie’s. But it’s a more progressive policy than Pete’s (very close though), and much more progressive than Biden’s ACA expansion. In my mind, her MFA plan seems much closer to Bernie than Biden.
'A fierce team.' Whitmer praises Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's VP pick.
The primary campaign reduced Harris &amp; Biden favorability, but Biden started much higher
Hot take: 1. I’m still voting for #Biden  2. #Harris ain’t it. 3. Before you  me. Know that #WomenOfColor were my top 2 picks. #Duckworth and #Abrams were the winning choices. #Election2020
Biden picks Kamala and I am sooooo here for it let’s go
Not y’all being excited that Kamala Harris is Biden’s VP nomination😭😭😭😭
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
I wanted to poke at VP Biden for having a framed Hagar the Horrible comic on his desk as a pinnacle of Boomer Humor (TM). But if you look closer, it's Hagar lamenting to God after a tragedy.   Let's elect a president who has felt the ultimate in despair and still kept going.
So you’re going to vote for Trump cause you don’t like Biden/Harris? And you call Biden a dementia patient but trump can’t even say Yosemite and brags about passing a baseline dementia test.
I’m very confused in which ways you consider Harris to be “moderate”. I suppose your definition of center is a bit different than mine since you say Biden is to the right of it.   Especially as a legislator, there are honestly few more progressive reps in the house/senate.
The fact Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his VP doomed him. That chick is a horrible person. A terrible prosecutor. She hates Black people for real. She don’t give a fuck. Yeah, her record proves what I said. Look it up!! #fuckkamalaharris #VPHarris #dumb #blm #ReparationsNow
#Resist #Election2020 #politics #Democrats2020 #Dump45 #Resistance #Elections2020 Way to go, Joe!  I feel like we just won the election! Kamala is a great choice.  Now let’s fix this mess!

I feel like my Faith has been restored. Makes you appreciate the old times when we were really Americans. Glad the racists showed their true colors!! #Biden/Harris2020
Kamala Harris attacks Joe Biden's record on busing and working with segregationists in vicious exchange at Democratic debate
Michigan State basketball legend Magic Johnson weighs in on politics after Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his vice president  #MSU #Spartans #GoGreen #B1G
Hey  — Biden picked his VP, you don’t have to audition anymore, so maybe stop holding us hostage to score political points? 🤷🏼‍♀️
Imagine how long it took Biden's staff to explain the RipKamala hashtag to him the other day.
I don’t disagree but it’s what we have. For this election we have to get rid of the scourge of the Earth that is trump. If Biden and Harris win that’s means more down ballot progressives will win too. We have to get rid of trump and then work on getting more progressives elected.
Side note: s/o to Team Biden for having no leaks. This announcement came when  wanted it to happen.
It isnt the best pick but neither was Biden. It’s infinitely better than what we have
I agree with  I said that it didn’t matter which women Biden picked, but then as we see the racial injustices going on in the country, #BreonnaTaylor murder unsolved, black mayors being attacked, I thought, YES it does matter!
me a month ago: abolish the police!!! do don’t trust cops me in nov: TRUMP/PENCE ◼️ BIDEN/HARRIS: ☑️
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris To Be His VP Running Mate In Historical Moment
Biden actually picked Kamala as his running mate. That’s so dope. #CHANGE
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who had been in the running, celebrates Joe Biden's pick:
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate
Great!  Can’t wait to vote for Biden/Harris and get the disaster that is trump and his administration out of the White House!!
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris To Be His VP Running Mate In Historical Moment
To think that either party is going to do anything like that, seems wishful at best  IMHO They pushed Biden in front of Bernie because they have no intention of changing anything that would significantly help the working class
BREAKING -  chooses  as vice presidential running mate.
It’s not an election, it’s an appointment from governor Newsom. De Leon, who is still not great angered the California democratic establishment by challenging Feinstein. Garcetti was on the committee that picked Kamala for Biden and clearly wants the seat.
For the record, these are my current views:  - I will be voting for Biden/Harris in November.  - I am very much looking forward to voting for Kamala Harris’s progressive primary challenger in 2024
Kamala Harris: -A cop -Imprisoned parents for children missing school  Criterion Collection’s New Federico Fellini Box Set:  -Features 11 movies in 4K restorations -6 Audio Commentaries -Not a cop  and Joe Biden picked WHO to be his running mate?
Are you a Michigander who has supported  from the beginning? Would love to hear your thoughts on her selection as Biden's #VP running mate. DM or email elawler
I love how you didn't mention Biden being Pres, cause we all know he's gonna be dead in a year or so
The selection will make Harris the third woman — and first Black candidate — to be nominated for vice president by a major political party.
Dassit. I ain’t fucking voting this year.    Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Senator Harris was my 2nd choice, but she gave no vision of how the US can change the 40yr slide into the “conservative” cesspool we find ourselves in. Elizabeth Warren knows how to change the script.  Joe Biden is a “go along/get along” status quo maintainer.  Kamala??? 🤷‍♀️No need to worry about it now! Democrats can now TEXT TO VOTE according to the new law Trump just passed! Since he didn’t want to fund the postal service they’re allowing it for Democrats.   TEXT the word: BIDEN TO: 30330   No registration/ID/signature/mask!   We did it!
But basement Biden is ahead by 7% in national polls with a margin of error of -24%
Joe Biden is calling for a 3 month mask mandate, but he hasn’t addressed the riots or the looting! GTFO
I look at Biden/Harris and they terrify me. He’s been a liar for his entire career. So phony he was forced out of the race for plagerizing last time he ran for pres. She says out loud that she believes Tara Reid yet still supports Biden. Can’t trust either to go against grain.

The only reason they chose her is so they can call Trump a woman hating racist. She doesn’t even need a brain. Now Biden looks less racist and they have 2 virtue signal boxes checked to respond to Trump with.
Vote for Biden anyway.  Count on Biden to put together a team of advisors that he will actually listen to.  He’s not going in thinking he has to know everything.  He just has to know how to lead.  Besides we have a better shot at surviving the next 4 years with Biden for Prez.
And people say Biden can’t say anything intelligent 😀

You mean nobody asked when he stopped beating his wife? What do you expect from MSM?  Think you'll ever hear a question like that posed to Joe Biden? How about ANY serious questions? Like what day is it? What month is it? What city or state are you in Joe? Great vetting MSM!!
If I have to stand there 24 hours to vote for Biden, I will!
Pretty sure this is a BIDEN BOT
"Hell no, I'm not resigning ... I thought (the post) was humorous. I had no idea people would react the way they did. I think people have gone overboard on this … It's an election year."
Dr Biden: I believe this country is stronger when the least of us is supported and lifted up. A rising tide lifts all ships.   Melanie: A rising tide lifts the ships and make us the stronger country of the least people. Close enough.
Because that shit was laughable. ZOOM OUT. It’s so simple. He knew Biden had been super dirty in Ukraine. He asked to look into it. Dems spun it in an insanely dishonest way. It didn’t work. Guess what? HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT BIDEN. The rest was a legal assassination attempt. MISSED
Umm no. Not what happened. He said, they found no evidence of Russian collusion. What you just said was a false translation from the fake news. As far as Ukraine, Biden is up on  federal charges over there for crimes. All trump did was point it out. Dems are really that ballsy
Joe Biden is going to force our children to read the Curand (muslim bible) in schools.
R: Don’t vote for Biden, he’s a pedo.   D: Don’t vote for Trump, he’s a pedo.   That’s a fucking issue.
How about Harris before being a vp candidate called Biden a racist and she also said she believed all his accusers in regards to sexual assault.
Change is happening  We will get better president for 2020 . Joe Biden for the win 💁🏼‍♀️🙏🏻
r u kidding, the demon'crats will do anything to win  elections...how do people like Whitmore...the squad..polosi..Schumer  ..Schiff.. problem child M. Watters..shit for brains the thief biden...Kamala the mirror fake news Harris ...who votes for these pos...they cheat !
Everything is going to come out IF we can successfully elect Biden/Harris. The Trumpublicans and Trump syndicate WILL see PRISON! That's why this is all or nothing for this corrupt regime! Vote! No matter how you do it! Vote!
Vote for Biden/ Harris.What have you got to lose?
Biden will lock Trump,in the bunker.
Every time you feel the urge to take a shot at Biden or Harris, redirect that shit toward Trump. There is a country to save.
no biden voters allowed to read my tweets

She signed to agree with Trump on more than a few unsavory issues, and with the “Defund the police” sentiment being so strong atm it’s just another example of Biden being shortsighted in the face of his goals. “I Need to get my black vote back up, get a black lady right?” Wrong1
What more could we ask for! She’s already proven to have zero integrity and just like Biden, the more she says, the worse she looks! Thank you Clintbama’s.... Excellent choice!

Joe Biden : Demagogues are great for Jewish worshipers
DOJ? PFFT. Please with a criminal as AG. I can't wait to see these criminals go to prison. Biden has already said he will not stand in the way of investigation and incarceration of these criminals.
Wouldnt someone who champions Biden and the cop be outing themselves as well?
Awesome!!!! GO BIDEN AND HARRIS!!
Netflix is not a propaganda machine? I mean, Obama is part of netflix is he not?  Yes the US (cia..intelligence agencies)have done and allowed some creepy things...u see Trump is cleaning out deep state  pedophiles, thieves like biden, child traffickers...that's why trumps hated
I followed you and I care, as I am sure all reading this do too! I understand and this year has been awful. I have those feelings daily too. You are not alone. Try to feel the hope of Biden/Harris and we have work to do to make sure it happens. We are stronger together! 💙💙💙
Yeh...just like the deep state dumbasses biden..Harris...Schumer..Pelosi...r going to "really" change things for the better...this time.. really ? just vote for Trump..do yourself &amp; your family a favor...Trump has done more in 3  years than the last 4 puppets put together, awake!
- Biden is leading in 5 of the top 6 battleground states and the other one he is tied with Trump.   - His current average overall approval rating is 43.4%  If you don’t believe the polls, okay so be it, but he’s blatantly making shit up here. Come on now lol be better.
celebrating with unadulterated joy the Biden Harris ticket.
Majority of Americans (even 49% #Democrats) think   would not finish first term if elected  #tcot #gop #migop

Joe Biden couldn’t put a 25 piece puzzle together, but he’s going to put the economy together! 😂😂
Kamala Harris won't stop talking about Beau Biden, it's very suspicious that she would spend this much time talking about a dead person. Possible ties to necromancy? - The Gray Fox
Hmmm, Joe Biden has chosen the first female Redguard VP.. -The Gray Fox
Please add Joe Biden to the mix.
I'm not gonna pretend that Biden, any dem or a politician is squeaky clean. I'm not naive. That said, we've seen trump enrich himself and his cronies right out in the open. How many of the small business loans went to his friends and himself.
Congratulations to Senator Harris and Vice President Biden for standing tall in adversity!! WELL DONE! Now we have to do our part VOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That is frickin halarious. You know Biden could do that cuz clown donald can barely make it off the news conference stage without holding onto a wall or column. Watch trumpy when he exits from a stage. His balance is way off; something not right there.
I assume I'm considered a "house-wife" since I stay home to raise my son and finish my multiple degrees. But I can say that trump got it very wrong. This "house-wife" (I hate this term) is voting for Biden/Harris!!!
If you think COVID - 19 is dangerous, Biden - 20 will destroy our country!
...I barely rock with Biden and nothing could ever make me roll with Kamala!
Most Americans r not that stupid, biden? Somatic narcissist dumbass..Harris a covert narcissist mirrors everyone...what? MSM has deceived many to hate Trump...the spirit is called leviathan ...Jezebel/narcissist have this spirit also..it twist truth
Yeh cus it's a joke..lost 9 billion ? The postal service needs to b put into the private sector,so the scum in Washington  like biden..Pelosi, Schumer, Harris, who like to skim the take, b thankful we now have a president who is stopping the  skim, surprised u didn't know that
HARRIS IS A HYPOCRITE WHO SAID SHE BELIEVED THE WOMAN WHO COMPLAIN THAT BIDEN IS A PEDOPHILE. HAVE A GOOD DEMOCRAT KKK
This VP is different. Even Biden says, he’s no spring chicken. Kamalalala is the Deep State’s choice for president! If Biden strokes all the way out, 🧨💥Who and what she is, shows everyone the utter lack of integrity &amp; willingness to be radical these LEFTIST CRATS truly are!
He is, but he also realizes that he needs his voters to support Biden or trump will win again
For now ... until December when Biden picks her for a cabinet post ...
“Trumps a racist, pervert, uses people of color for personal gain, babbling idiot!!”  And what did you and the DNC decide on?  A racist, pervert, using people of color for personal gain, can’t formulate a sentence (Biden’s not a babbling idiot like trump but it’s not great)
When something’s okay. “Believe all women” until it turned on Biden. “White people have to stop using people of color for personal gain” until Biden did it. “We need a president whose well spoken and not a hot head “ which Biden isn’t even close too.  “BUTTTT TRUMPPP”  Ya know,
*pretends to be shocked*  Biden, is completely using a women of color just for votes. Not because he believes she’ll do the best job. Sad. You know all the other outrage when white people, were using people of color to justify things they’ve said or done or this and that
Welcome to my Ted Talk.🐸🍵
“If you don’t vote and like Kamala Harris cause she a black women you’re racist and sexist. Hate her because of her views”  Is it okay to pick her strictly because she’s black and a women even though she isn’t most qualified, if at all??  “BIDEN WOULD NEVER THATS A TRUMP THING!!”

Joe Biden has hired me, "the gray fox", to "steal" the election... Easy for me ..
Taking on a prosecutor VP is suicide for Biden. He just lost a lot of pot smoker libertarian votes. I'm probably the only right wing pot smoker on earth.
Wasn't that long ago Harris said that Biden was a sexist and molested women...so these things are no longer true?
I take it this means Harris no longer believes that Biden is a racist and a sexist...my how opinions change when you're bought off.
Gotta remember, this isn’t a typical VP situation. Kamala is the deep state’s choice for PRESIDENT! We all know Biden’s not gonna make it very much further anyway but, the second they’re ready, they’d make him retire and have her in the oval. With her integrity... makes sense.
grand standing fraudulent virtue signaling politician of all. She was pleading to censor Trump on Twitter in order to get some cheers and when it didn’t land, she akwardly laughed through the lack of applause. She’s  screeching nails on a chalkboard FAKE. NO BUENO! NO BIDEN!
OMG  The woman that pointed out your racist behavior during the debates is now your running mate what is this world coming to? Show your white privilege Joe Biden your brain is mush old man
Maybe because they know the economy will survive since there’s no way Biden can win now 😂
The point in using those videos is to say “this is the type of nonsense that will continue if Biden is re-elected”. When he’s re-elected and the house flips over, the mess in those videos will be done. Voting him back into office will show the support is there to make it happen.

Do I just roll with people that are a lot further left than Biden/Harris, and they really ARE a good representation of most dems? Idk who I wanted him to pick, but she’s just never been someone I’m excited about.
You don’t understand because you don’t think backwards like a Democrat. It’s not about what she stands FOR. It’s a new way to attack Trump &amp; his voters. Anti-Biden/Harris will be considered “anti-women” &amp; “anti-people of color” 🙄 IT WONT WORK but, it will be PAINFULLY CRINGEY!👇🏽
How does any decent person say “I believe them” yet still support Biden? It’s one thing to be a little too flirty or make inappropriate comments, especially considering he grew up in a different era. Um excuse me..FINGER RAPING A STAFFER...UNFORGIVABLE!  Really Democrats? REALLY?
Remember when Trump told Chris Wallace there’s no enthusiasm for Biden. Keep thinking that, big guy.
Well considering Biden doesn't even know where he is you better hope you're right on that.
you and Biden as a ticket have given me hope. I haven’t slept well since that lying Putin puppet was elected. Thank you. Tonight I can sleep. ❤️💚
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist?
You Ain't Black Biden?  Listen to yourself.  Get some perspective.
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist?
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist?
Oh my Gosh they are throwing everything in the mix to try to get this idiot elected!!! Let’s see if this really happens when the TRUMP Administration is our and BIDEN is in!!!
Kamala Harris used to work with Hunter Biden doing what who knows? She enforced that 1994 crime bill against black defendants to its full extent. As a student of former mayor Willie Brown , whom she had an alleged affair with  Willie said she would make a lousy president!
You're out your damn mind. Trump has done WAY more for the Black/Hispanic communities than any other president. Biden on the other hand says you aint black if you don't vote for him
Progressives will definitely NOT get on Board with a Biden/Harris ticket you can be sure of that
me when im seeing all this new biden/kamala merch
Please help support Joe Biden 2020, add a #Twibbon now!
Was there any Democratic primary contenders more conservative than Biden and Harris? Seriously asking
Two racist people and Biden cannot even talk or form a sentence or answer questions Harris wants to defend police, to losses
Awesome. Didn’t she call Biden a racist and also say she believes Biden’s accusers! What a joke,
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris As Democratic VP Running Mate
Why was msmbc so late in announcing Biden’s vp pick
Biden/Harris was the obvious ticket. She can now push police reform as a former AG, she's got a ton of charisma that'll remind people of Obama, and it'll set Dems up for 12 years in office when she runs in '24. #BidenHarris2020
Anyone have the clip/video of Harris crying about how racist Biden was for wanting segregated schools and busses? That’s one of my favorites.
Kamala Harris is, objectively, the worst possible choice for the Democrats to put in the White House alongside Joe Biden.  Not because she is a woman, but because when she had the power to help people facing injustice from law enforcement, she did nothing. She. Did. Nothing.

Trump replied: “He said that. Some people would say that men are insulted by that, and some people would say it’s fine. I don’t know.”  Somehow that became:   Biden is insulting men everywhere (without quotation marks”””btw!)  You really do have to be a detective to read the news

Wow he never said that. But since you can't remember what city you are in it makes sense you would say that. Nice new slogan SETTLE FOR BIDEN shows real enthusiasm huh.
Biden will do the debates... as long as Alan Dershowitz can be his champion and fight in his stead 😂
I am pretty sure Biden said he will accept the nomination from his home so I think the majority of the convention will be virtual
I want them to roll up in that Corvette and do a big donut in front of Biden's house.
That's a bold face lie.  has done more for working Americans in 3 years than you have done in 40+. America cannot afford the Joe Biden 95+trillion dollar plan along with a tax hike for working Americans.

Since when is it legal to go around all over TV lying about someone in order to damage their character? Could we go around saying it was actually China Joe Biden who started Covid by molesting a lab monkey and bringing it back to the US to secretly marry it?
I gotta ask, why aren’t Dems taking this approach? Seriously, just start making up awesome stuff about Biden and who cares about how realistic it is?
This coming from the campaign attempting to cast doubt on Biden’s mental faculties. Orwellian is appropriate.
Sounds like a great VP choice for Biden.... The only chance they have to win this election is to convert a good republican for VP😂
Fake news
Uh-huh. And he says Biden is the one with cognitive difficulties.
The only thing Biden will be picking will be his ear. The deep state chooses everything he does from his outfits to his interviews.
He’s also quite handsome but, that also has nothing to do with my point. I’ll play along tho... fair to say, Biden doesn’t exactly have that gift either but, the press never comes at him even a little bit like they have with Trump. Anyone being honest, will see my point here.
Like his advisors helping pick the vp or like online ones like the bernie bros? Ive never seen like a extremely amped biden guy on twitter haha
man oh man, all my ignorant family members posting about how Joe Biden is a creepy pedo sure seem to forget that there is actually a creepy old man in our family who was accused and sent to jail for molesting his granddaughter, but we conveniently forget about that don't we?
Theres biden bros?
That goes with the statement Trump made; If Joe Biden gets elected China will own this country. Scary!!!!!

Have ya heard the gibberish that comes out of Covidiot45. Every time he opens his mouth, a bunch of incoherent bullshit falls out on the floor. Doesn't matter. I'd vote for Biden even if he had a closed head injury and could only manage to druel before I'd vote for this criminal.
Never seen any evidence of Russia helping Trump. I hear it all the time but, haven’t seen one example.   Biden on the other hand, has the biggest election interference machine ever created via mainstream media, every social media platform in existence, &amp; print.  Where’s the beef?

Can someone wake up Joe Biden, give him his applesauce, and tell him what VP he picked?
So, apparently, the Chinese want Biden to be president,  the Russians want Trump to be re-elected, and it's bad  because they might influence the election. Yes, it might, as long as we have dumbasses who believe everything they read online. How about people stop being dumbasses?
So if Biden picks our tyrant queen to be his VP maybe she'll be so busy campaigning for his election to issue her daily executive orders.  Maybe only every other day.Guess  thought he was going be President &amp; make the appointments during his term? The left spends all its time debating principle &amp; then the clock runs out.

I don’t think so.  If Trump loses and refuses to leave, on Jan. 20 he becomes a trespasser in the WH and de facto threat to Pres Biden. The Secret Service would have ample resources to restrain and remove him.  stay safe

And, you are also misinformed about the Federal deficit.  Recall that Obama / Biden inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  Federal deficit trend (note the increase under Trump before the virus hit):
This isn’t a 100% by any means, but it sure seems like Susan Rice is going to be Joe Biden’s VP pick. The betting markets have completely flipped in the last 24 hours in which Kamala Harris was a big fave &amp; now Rice is the favorite on her own.
The other way to look at jobs, number employed (again Fed data).  Employment rose steadily from 138 M in Dec. 2009 to 152 M in Dec. 2016 under Obama / Biden.

Hates Trump, voted for Hillary in 16 but is leaning Trump bc Biden is too cozy with the far left &amp; talking about removing 1031 non taxable exchanges. Assuring him that won’t pass the Senate didn’t help.Postal carriers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake
Well, what do you think your chances of survival are for you and your loved ones with Trump? The funny thing is that MAGA is now a great slogan for those who vote for Biden. You are still MAGA, Make America Great Again by voting for Biden. Do you think its greater now than 2015?
I'm afraid that come november, even if Biden gets elected, people are going to assume they can sit back and stop protesting for important causes because the president will "fix everything" which is NOT the case. Regardless of who wins, don't stop fighting. They won't change
Joe Biden has promised to appoint a Secretary of Education who has actually been a public school teacher.   I can't wait.
I love that the bar is so low that Biden can tweet out about just basic human decency and people will quote tweet it like “THIS is what we need in a president”
Single is a single head. Sorry trump voters certainly aren’t looking at Biden
Joey Two Times Biden
. JOE BIDEN IS NOT IN CHARGE DID OBAMA HAVE ANY THING TO DO WITH THIS WOMAN'S POSITION?                                           Vote:  REPUBLICAN  2020 - 2022
We’re on the same side here Joe. Just everyday we see Biden’s dumbass and I think what could’ve been instead. Doesn’t mean I’m not also aware of everything else. I’m allowed to be upset with the DNC.
the better candidates to win. Then will guilt you to vote for their shitty candidate. Im aware of the bigger issues, it only took me 5 seconds to make that tweet. You can continue to have your head up the DNC’s ass and be happy with candidates like Biden but I wont 🐑
Thank you so much  You were great to hear last night on the Biden/Harris phonebanking launch too!
Like I keep telling people: you ain’t voting for Biden, you’re voting for RBG’s replacement - For starters.  Like do people have any idea how much damage DeVos did to the educational system and the students in less than four years?!
Lol. Time will tell cuz Biden is winning
1. Mr. President, why doesn’t your ads show VP Biden labeling you as a xenophobic for banning travel to and from China?  2.Why doesn’t your ads mention that Biden/Harris never talked about Corona during debates?
That’s understandable because BIDEN did not pick her. The leftists who pull his strings picked her.
“Biden believes in killing babies at 9 months” God I don’t have the mental capacity for this today.
Funny how trump gave the 1% a permanent tax cut. The rest of us got a small temporary cut. Now he is making up stuff about Biden. Remember when Obama/Biden fixed the economic mess left by Bush? I guess Biden will have to clean up an even bigger mess this time. #TrumpDepression
I watched this multiple times. You're missing the point. Biden can disagree with somebody &amp; realize they have a lot to offer even if they have a different opinion on something. This is leadership  &amp; Character.   Donald Trump will fire you if you disagree with his ideas.
You should spend some time doing research before you blast out comments on Twitter. It's clearly documented that Joe Biden grew up with his stuttering problem.  Biden has overcome his insecurities about stuttering. Trump has never overcome his insecurities resulting in narcissism
we said acab and biden rlly said no ❤️ like read the room joe
If this is true then donald trump and biden both have an IQ of 228
I know folks not voting for Trump, but it has the feel of a bit larger Trump win than ‘16. I think Trump is the beneficiary of the pandemic lockdowns, followed by BLM riots and a cognitively challenged Biden!
If Biden wins, Trump will be spending 2021 in court and potentially jail. If he wins and they lose control of the senate, Pence will be President because Trump will be removed.
Obama Biden sold 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia and personally profited from the sale. Just like you profited from Ukraine and China.
Are we supposed to vote for Biden and Harris because they are the best the Democratic Party has to offer or because one was Obama’s VP and the other is an African American woman?   Tell me the policy reasons I should vote for them. Don’t try to win me over with heartstrings.
Time to get to work, Andrew! So, where is your Biden photo in relation to Verlander?

You mean the lady that gave Hillary Clinton all the answers during the debate? No!     She’s probably already giving CNN, MSMBC ideas on how to put and ear piece on Biden’s ear so they can do the same
Whitmer told Biden she didn't want VP spot, urged him to choose Black woman  via
He didn’t say that.  He said it’s further to the left than it’s ever been, but that platform has nothing to do with Biden.
Ok sure but there 3 months till the election do you think enough people are going to vote independent (and agree on a candidate) to make even a dent against Biden or trump Conservatives are anti change that's their whole schtick, you need a liberal supreme court for real change
Because here’s the thing: you’re not voting for Biden.  You’re voting for Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s successor.  It’s choosing between getting shot in the knee or shot in the gut, but if you choose neither, then someone else takes the bullet for you.
I dislike them both, but as I’ve said over and over again, I’m not voting for Biden, but RBG’s successor.
The concerns are legitimate, because voting for Biden is painful.  However, this isn’t an election where you vote to get someone IN, this is an election where you’re trying to get someone OUT.  If Joe doesn’t do the right thing in four years, then vote him out too.
Biden passes over Whitmer, taps Kamala Harris for vice presidential nod  via
As bad as Biden and Harris are, they at least have people like Warren, Sanders, and the BLM movement nudging them in different directions.  All I can hope is that they listen, because four more tears of Trump is just the start of the worse alternative.
Kamala and Biden have always been friends. Don't doublethink!
Are you saying Biden doesn't have money he brought in Kamala for money? 🙄🙄..  Do you follow American politics? First of she got this VP ticket based on her black race (Mixed Indian race is added bonus, if she is pure Indian, she won't be in the race for sure)
So apparently some of the first real oppo they release on  is basically reminding voters that the Biden-Harris White House will end the discriminatory cash bail system in this country
Might want to tell  to put his Pom Poms  away as well. He seemed to like Biden’s choice..🤷🏼‍♂️
i am disappointed in joe biden’s choice  for VP but i’m also disappointed to vote for joe so...... i guess it’s fine
Biden is a Catholic.  Granted a common-sense and not an  Opus Dei Catholic.  Still, a Catholic.
Seems like #Russia's Putin wants Trump to win the election and #China's Xi Jinping wants Joe Biden to win the election 😂😂😅  #MAGA #KamalaHarris
She has publicly called Joe Biden a racist. Now she's joining him on the ticket. Either she doesn't have integrity or she has become a racist or she was slandering an old man for her win! What do you think?
Joe and Beau Biden of course.
Just watched clip of Biden/Harris meeting and hugging...gave me chills. I haven’t felt this good/excited about a ticket, a movement, since Obama/Biden! 💪🏻🌊🇺🇸🤜🏻🤛🏾🙋🏼‍♂️
Lmaooo I’m scheduling a Biden rally on the corner of 25 and Shelby
You may not like him, you may love him, but one day his campaign will be studied in social media marketing classes around the world...he’s a genius and joe Biden is a racist pedo pig
Proud to be a Biden Supporter!
attacks on  during the Dem debates..are ok. We want that. If  had 1/2 the courage Kamala has , he may have actually stood up to Trump!? Things could’ve turned out differently. She will provide that  balance making Biden’s Admin even stronger. 💪🏻🙏🏻
I don't want to do it. I don't like Biden one bit.  He doesn't' represent me at all. But I will do it, because I must, because the alternative is a threat to democracy itself.
Agreed. This was my hope since Biden became the presumptive nominee. So pumped. It’s been a joy watching most of the reaction.
I hope you understand now that Joe Biden can careless about you. You have an opportunity to redeem yourself, cut the cord with Sleepy and focus on your career. By him being racist and picking only a women with color you should be upset. He will never win with her!
Biden-Harris has been my dream ticket for some time, so I love today’s news. I also love how many other absolutely incredible women have been in the public eye as serious contenders more than prepared for the office.
Do ⁦⁦ &amp; ⁦⁦ remember this ⁦ statement or are they too busy soaking in the praise from the liberal media who only loves republicans when they attack republicans?

Ridin' with Biden and Harris!! Lets dump Trump!
You're not making any sense, if Russia has already purchased Biden then  that's who they would want in the office ad president.   Russia has purchased Donald, Mitch McConnell,  and grassley
Okay somebody needs to do some research. Every single thing Biden did regarding this situation has already been evaluated. Watch the entire tape &amp; read the articles.   Stop using propaganda that's faults.  Research dude research.
Presumptive of me, but I'm really proud of Joe Biden for choosing a woman who hit him hard in the debate. He's showing us he's a man who can take criticism and doesn't hold grudges. How refreshing.
Remember the debate where Kamala Harris heavily criticized Biden on busing? Picking Harris speaks volumes about the kind of man Joe Biden is. Does anyone think President Man-Baby would or could pick someone who wouldn't kiss his fat ass day in, day out?
Kamala Harris is announced as Joe Biden's running mate(VP), her mother is a tamilian (Dad is an African American). Joe Biden's memory is getting so bad, if Biden wins, he may not continue as a President for long, Kamala may take over. Congrats Kamala 👍🏼
Hey everyone, only rational reasons for spreading your cheeks after a rigged primary and STILL voting for Biden after a shitty VP pick in the replies!
I’m crying right now! I always thought she would be the perfect strong lady to stand up for America and be the perfect partner for President Biden! America should be Dancing in the streets to have such a brilliant beautiful WOMAM as VP! trump is shakin in his boots!
Hell yeah!  I’m way more excited about Kamala than Biden but let’s do this!!! #bluewave #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris2020
Joe biden ran for president in 1988 and got caught for lying and it took him out the race, then he ran again after that in 2008 and lost to your “great” Obama, so please tell me how you want somebody like this in office LMAO
Fuck. I knew i should have bought one of those Biden Harris websites when they were doing the primaries coz i knew this was coming
Biden/Harris - the comprehensive rapist/mass incarceration bootlicker 2020.  Trump is Rapist/Religious Mysogynist.  There is no "win" here.
Excellent choice! “Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate”
Biden chose  Well done!
Okay so the White House website has a presidential briefing scheduled for 5:30 Eastern. I think it would be funny if Biden went live at 5:29.
Trump: 'Some people would say men are insulted' by Joe Biden choosing a woman as VP
If biden picks whitmer my dad might vote for them. Just depends how they feel about military spending.
This is absolutely true. Trump needs to leave office, but Biden keeps doing horrible things like this since he feels entitled to votes at this point.
There's a difference between a country wanting somebody as president and country manipulating an election to get their candidate. We already know Russia is actively manipulating, using social media. Germany would like to see Biden. Does that make them an enemy of the state.
I'm trying to get your point here. So who really cares if China wants Biden to be president. We all know Russia, a much more dangerous entity, wants and will manipulate to have Donald j Trump remain president. You forget they helped him win in 2016.
And he accuses VP Biden of cognitive slippage. There are montages, like this, of coo coo for Cocoa Puffs moments from DJT. Yikes.

Not hopeless vote Biden to get rid of donald and his corrupt administration.
That is the opportunity. To drive real policy change championed by a Biden administration with diversity from the VP level down.
I look forward to learning Vice President Biden's pick for VP.  I know if  is selected, and I am Nominated on August 29th Donald Trump would have no chance to win Michigan.

Yes! He has gotten away with lies and treason him Hililary and Joe Biden knew ratings also he was thVP! So he now has dementia and will claim he knows nothing!

Yeah joe Biden is mentally incompetent for sure!
Truly the Dems and the media are all crazy! They look like fools propping up Joe Biden! He is not a well man!
Fair enough. My view is influenced by assessment that Harris ran a weak  primary campaign and never did her homework on health care.  And choosing Rice keeps Biden in the shadow of Obama when he wants to make a fresh and independent  statement.  I think it’s Whitmer or Demings.
What is Biden selling? Socialism.
That first word was a typo, right? If you use Spell Check it would correct to BIDEN...
For all he has done for the American people. Simple truth. Have you studied Biden’s platform? Didn’t think so.  I should feel sorry for you, but I don’t.

He's a good man. He is all about the people, putting money back in American pockets....mental biden only talks about raising taxes.
What about the Hong Kong Flu or the Black Plague? Whenever someone opens his mouth today, something “racist” is going to fall out. Biden holds the record on that!!

Michigan is a swing state.  Yesterday while out going to a store for the first time in weeks,  we saw trump/pence signs in the vast majority of yards. Local news said Biden still leading but his lead is narrowing.  That scared me.  Your opinion?
Biden won't win.  We won't let it happen.  How's that!
Joe Biden will be fine, He has not bankrupt 13 companies, or failed to pay his taxes. And he is not a malignant narcissistic sociopath.
Frankly a special-needs 5th grader could do a better job than Donald Trump.   Joe Biden will bring us back to normal. 4 years of Trump's corruption and narcissism was 4 years too many.
And the only word Trump knows. Is Trump. And Biden can drink a glass of water on his own. #YoSemites  #COVFEFE  #Thighland
Up with a tooth ache ☹️ so I'm reading. Just read an interesting article about our governor. Apparently she took a chartered flight to Delaware to meet with Biden.

Kanye West indicates, in a Forbes interview via text, that he is in fact running to siphon votes from the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.  🖕🏽 Off  you mental sack of shit.
The goal is to not take away votes from Biden!
Totally agree! I would have thrown in the towel and dumped it all in Biden and Pelosi’s laps. He loves America too much. He is a natural leader! Besides, his ego would not allow him to do that. TRUMP 2020!!!
Biden is so racist he can’t even hide it when he knows he has to! That’s bad! Wow
Everything you said was true up until "we're gonna vote Trump in November." That last bit is just crazy. I get holding Biden's feet to the fire... But when has Trump given a smidge about Black Americans?
At this point, I'm more worried that Donald Trump has completely become unstable and unfit to serve the rest of the term.   Time to seriously consider the #25thAmendmentNow   He thinks Biden is going to hurt God. So I would support his sending children/teachers back to school.
I heard Biden is going to make ketchup illegal because it is RED, and the old Soviet Union has a red flag China has a red flag and the Republican party is red. What a bastard. I voting for Trump now.
I’m glad you understand the hypocricy. It’s okay to go after Biden for anything but when Trump sounds like a child it’s “award-winning journalism”. Your whatbaoutism is outstandingly stupid.
Wait I thought you wanted to court my vote, Donald. This only makes me want to vote for Biden even more, even if it is a complete lie.
Every time a Joe Biden video pops up on my TL I’m reminded that he is a legitimately bad candidate and that Democrats have just decided to go all in on the “well at least he isn’t Trump” concept. What a joke.
Electing Joe Biden starts with YOU being a registered voter 😌Anyone living in Michigan through November 3rd can go to this website RIGHT NOW and follow the steps to register within 5 minutes.   Take this time now so that it's not on your plate for later:)If you think Trump is going to do anything other than help his buddies steal as much from us that they can, you’re thinking wrong. Biden would be so much worse though.
I noticed that... Kamala Harris was Biden's handlers' pick y'know...
Vote for Biden.
Love it, keep doing it, if Biden can do that it's fair game. That is hilarious.

Another question you can ask: Why is the sky blue? Why can't Biden complete a sentence?
Dumbass question. How come Biden &amp; Harris can't answer any questions? Let me guess, because they don't have any answers. Biden is too busy cashing checks from the Ukraine and China.
Biden &amp; Harris can't answer any questions! Ask some relevant questions, like "President Trump, how did you accomplish so much in 3 years? Biden has been a politician for 45 years and has no accomplishments."  . #NeverBiden
Because they can't answer any questions and they don't have any accomplishments to discuss. Biden will be in a nursing home by November.
Obama &amp; Biden were too busy corrupting America and filling the swamp.
Just saw my 1st Joe Biden ad on the local station here in deep red WY. It sounded great, but not sure how the mandatory mask bit will go over here, so many covidiots!!
I’m voting for Biden/Harris because they can actually do the job without the lies and blatant corruption.  They are true diplomats and can mend fences with our allies.  Also, I’m tired of the division that has happened to our country.
How embarrassing for up and coming young artists to be seen with doddering old fool, Biden. How does this help their cache with fans? 😂
Vote for Biden and save us all, please.
Clinton and Obama are definitely wonk Ivy wasps as this article portrays. Biden is the lone Irish Gipper, the feeler, the westerner, the American.
Bernie's plan also didn't abolish private insurance. I can't believe you grouped her in with those Neolibs. I have noticed you and Abby are crickets on Bernie sheepdogging progressives into voting for someone as horrible as Biden and Kopmala! You both are better than this!

Agreed. I live in West MI and it's rampant around here.  "Libertarians" voting for Trump. It boggles my mind. I actually committed to Biden unless my friend commits to Dr. Jo, as I told him I'm just voting to negate his vote. (Petty? Maybe. But too many Ron Paul folks &lt;3 Trump)
As long as you say the same about Trump (without mentioning Biden)
Totally agree. But if I (generally conservative) were to tell a dem that I’m voting 3rd party, though, this is the typical response, “but that’s a vote for Trump!” which is just not true, because I’d never vote for Biden. And especially not Bernie lol. Maybe I’m an outlier, idk.

This Biden drinking water ad is the stupidest thing I've seen since Obama drank Flint water
You lost me at Biden being a better president than trump. I do however get what your saying, I would just reverse the analogy.
The atmosphere for protest and agitation will likely lessen under Biden *for a while*. But the evictions, recession and other crises will generate protests again, and Biden will not stop the crushing of those mvmts.
Anything dems offer that sounds good is and always will be either abandoned or will cement in the advanced made by the right.   Case in point. Biden will maintain trump ICE policies.
She's notorious for oppression of Black Americans as a DA. Called Joe Biden a racist. Damn bear EVERYTHING she says is race based... so who's the racist?
The anti war protests were amongst the largest ever, and the overt lies that made the case for iraq were unraveling well before boots were on the ground. All it would have required for Biden to do the right thing was listen. But he didn't because hes a lifelong warmonger.
Once again, there is no reason for anyone on the left to feel as if they must vote for Biden. He will not reverse any Trump policies when in power.
Great to be in-studio yesterday at  in Casper to talk about the important issues facing Wyoming, as well as why Kamala Harris's radical policies would hurt our state and the nation.

I think we need tons of people voting in person for Biden/Harris on Election Day. I may risk it and go. I am so worried he’ll declare victory on Election Day if he’s ahead on in person voting. That would be harder if Joe comes out on top on election night.
Even better the Joe Biden?? 👀👀
I won’t credit Obama, but I certainly hope I get the chance to credit Biden.
Are you freaking kidding me? This dipshit is getting 42 percent in the latest poll against Biden. How the fuck is that possible??
Who would your father support?   He was a man of character and did what he thought was right.  Your dad loved joe Biden and you said you did too?   WTF are you not endorsing the man who has always been there for your family?  Trump treated your father horribly!
It’s really more of a suggestion of what Biden thinks should be done.  He won’t actually be sworn in until January, so that’s when it would start. By then, we’ll likely have a vaccine.
Bongino rips idea of Hillary Clinton, Susan Rice joining a Biden admin: 'How thin does your bench have to be?'  #FoxNews
Agh. Made some typos I’ll never be able to go back and correct. FOR SHAME. Despite*** not knowing wtf he is talking about at all.  But here he is on Joe Biden working to appeal to evangelicals “No religion, no anything... hurt the Bible, hurt God”
He gets hand cuffed 1 minute after Biden is sworn in.
Biden 50%, President Trump 36%
We must ensure Biden-Harris win the electoral college AND the popular VOTE
Biden says a mandatory mask mandate will save 40K lives in the next three months. So at a (generous) 1% death rate, that means there would have to be 4 MILLION NEW CASES in the US between now and Election Day. #notgonnahappen
The world is already laughing that Biden is the best that the DEMs could come up with.
The Biden/Harris photo was perfect. Made in sketchy light. Really great.
Jill Biden and Douglas Emhoff are building a beautiful virtual friendship
Perhaps, but you have to admit Trump inherited an economy that was roaring along, while Obama inherited one that was in a death spiral. Ironically, if Biden wins, he’ll inherit an economy in worse shape than the one Obama did.
So isn’t it time to enthusiastically endorse Biden/Harris? Your dad would.
You realize you said overt fascism about the current President of the United States, and are still willing to give him 4 more years? You think this place will be around in 2024 or 2028? Seriously? By then he will have nabbed Putin-like control. We can at least hold Biden to the🔥
That, and Biden's sign interpreter.
So if your waiting for stimulus checks to pass might as well not it’s gonna be a election issue his year each person Trump and biden will say vote For me and I’ll Give you a bigger stimulus watch
I wonder when Biden found out who his VP candidate was going to be? #ChinaJoeBiden  . Standing for the flag is patriotic not wearing a mask. .    . Biggest losers.
Nonsense, Democrats assure me, Berners who don't vote for Biden/Harris are under the influence of Russia.
Don't believe a word Biden says. Pure bullcrap pulled out of thin air. Remember, Biden liked Robert KKK Bird. #NeverDemocrat
Biden. You made a bold face lie about wearing masks and saving lives. Nobody could say with any accuracy that wearing a mask will save 40,000 lives. Total bullcrap. Standing for the flag is Patriotic, not wearing a mask. When are you going to answer questions from media?
I love it - my former party members are now “Republicans for Joe Biden!”  I knew there were still good and bright Republicans!  #RepublicansForBiden
An Encouraging Rollout for the Biden-Harris Ticket  via
Kamala Harris is everyone’s worst nightmare. Thanks no balls Biden.
Also...Biden has 50 years of lies to answer for, so can't wait to see if he gets asked similar questions.  Oh, wait...he won't even take questions.
I really hope either Biden or Harris have Moist Von Lipwig on speed dial cuz once they in office, we gon’ need him.
THIS is leadership. Not Joe Biden.
What would you do?  Some guy on a moped drives by my house daily and screams expletives towards my Biden yard sign. There are young children on my block.
I wonder, too. You could say the DNC strategy was a success since it beat Bernie Sanders. Seems like a costly victory, though, if you permanently lose a good part of your base, which I think the party has. Then pick a limp candidate like Biden and search for political Viagra. Wow
Hope in Joe Biden.... ok... 🧐. Your TDS is over 9000!
She knows Biden’s winning. She’s trying to find the way to deal with that
Really? Joe Biden had 50 years in government, and didn’t “fix” this. Now, all of a sudden, it’s a priority and he can fix it.  Nope, not buying it!
Those are completely made of statistics. Multiple sources and polls say that only about 10% of Sanders supporters won't be voting for Biden and for Yang idk. But either way, you're lying out of your ass and making yourself look like a fool
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia  via
I'm confident the Biden/Harris admin will be capable of so much more than a toothless memo. We're gonna need a stronger Constitution.
No. There is no saving us now. Neither Biden nor Trump will do anything to curb the corporations that are ruining the planet. In fact, they will help. Bernie was the only hope for policies and actions that might save us and the planet.

When I watch Mr.Biden and listen to his,as people say,rambling on,and lack of putting words together too form intelligent speech.  I feel sorrow for him,and at Sametime shame for his staff,and family for keeping him in the limelight. Let the poor man retire. He really needs help
Election gambling odds. You bet $100 to win $43 with Biden ($143 payout) or You bet $100 to win $125 with trump ($225 payout) . You could bet $100 on Kanye and if he wins you win $50,000 ($50,100 payout). Something to watch. Trump was +1150 at a point in 2016.

Plus California has the highest income inequality. And highest taxes and cost of living so how is she and Biden gonna make it better? Look at the history of those two before you decide
To bad you don’t know the truth. Our President built the economy from the bad one Obama and Biden couldn’t bring back in 8 years . Matter of fact trump made the best economy our country has ever seen before, because our President killed all the bills that stopped
Yes. They are probably staunch supporters of Biden and the like.
I don't feel about Joe Biden.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
Name calling shows me a lot. Smh. Do better. Biden is horrible and trump would be the lesser of the 2 evils
I think it's not true. It seems like they called for governors to require mask wear:  but I can read the comments either way.
hey Donald, do you what will happen if you lose the election? Biden will sign the hero’s act and you’ll look like an uncaring ass. Your screwed up team of    are sabotaging your election chances. Are you that Blind?
Fully agree. I haven’t seen a single person who I’d consider as “far-left” excited about Biden or Harris.
Biden &amp; Harris can stuff their masks where the sun don't shine!
Hes also probably closer to Biden’s views than AOC
Hey  I don’t appreciate being used as your strawman. This holier-than-thou approach is why incremental change is so hard for the left.  Also, if you think Biden/Harris would truly be as bad as the current assholes, you are out of your collective goddamn gourds.
Fascism is already here. You already live in a police state. We already have concentration camps. Biden/Kamala will not save you from this, they ARE this.
every time i hear biden and harris being described as “far left” my already dead soul dies even further just that much more

ohhhh what i would do to see a trump vs biden debate 💀😂
it's where Biden sits
We can vote AND tear it all down, it's definitely an option.  Just the harm reduction of voting Trump out of office makes it worth doing IMO even if Biden and Kamalla are horrible.  Just don't forget to fight them as well, we can't have the left go to sleep like during Obama
I believe the Biden Harris ticket will do much more for the progressive movement moving forward than trump will. There is more hope with them in office than what we have right now!
The problem with 3rd party voting by progressive democrats, its a vote taken away from removing trump from office for no other reason but to hope and protest. Why not give the Biden Harris ticket a shot to show they will listen to progressive ideals and put some in place to start
Why are you endorsing Biden/Harris? Thanks though.
Wait....Democrats want everyone to be vegan?   Hmmm.  I’ll still vote for Biden.
Kamala Harris believed Joe Biden's accusers — until she didn't  #KamalaHarris

Not to mention tRump is projecting onto Biden what Americans already do to him.
And what other 'camps' will happen in the future if Biden wins? #scarythoughts
Just one of the many reasons to vote Biden/Harris 😇
I am so over people complaining about Biden being the nominee. I’m sorry, I don’t love him either, but some of y’all need to learn to accept it before Trump gets re-elected.
Biden and Kamala have locked up more black people than anyone in history..a speech doesnt undo that.. theyre both garbage!!! 💯
Will you be voting Biden/Harris? Asking for a country.
Trump breaks everything he touches. Hopefully a Biden administration will be able to restore the department’s image as mentioned in the article. Congress should also look at legislation to prevent the DHS from being used inappropriately in the future.
Or, as someone put it a couple days ago, she could be a sack of potatoes with a smiling face and I'd still vote for Biden.
It's true that African Americans didn't show up in quite as large of numbers, though in 2008 they voted with 60% and 2016 it was 59%.  As a Michigander, I knew Trump would win. But he's lost a lot of support here. And every third party voter I know from 2016 = Biden.
Trump campaign uses the totally false claim that dead people vote.  Trump campaign uses a dead persons Twitter account to attack Biden and Kamala.  Vote decency and truth, Vote #BidenHarris2020   #ONEV1
Absolutely none. She is more fake than Biden and the people need to see that.
Other than being the most pro-abortion ticket in history, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are puppets for the pro-China, open borders, Wall Street Chamber of Commerce crowd. They'll continue policies that ship jobs oversees while shilling for Big Tech
OMG you still have millions out of work and hours are being cut a monthly 2000 STIMULUS per person is what biden said hes going to do if he is the president its about the people not Trump's agenda TRUMP DOES NOT CARE about the people only HIMSELF 😥
One Biden/Harris rally &lt; One Trump Boat Rally
This is the future of the Biden/Harris Administration. This stuff will go on and on and on without end. Think before you vote.
Aww was Harris mean to your buddy that was bought &amp; paid for by you? We are still trying to figure out how he paid off all his bills with cash. I hope the Biden/Harris admin look into that. I'll take an angry/mad Black women over a LYING POS like you!
I am not dismissing a priori the case for Trump &gt; Biden.  That doesn’t when we (Catholics) should adopt the rhetorical style, obnoxiousness, bellicosity, and internal incoherency which comprise the four pillars of his administration and shout, “INTEGRALISM!”
Suburban woman here!   I’m excited to vote for Biden Harris in November.  Can’t wait to get the currupt incompetent traitor out of the White House and stop being embarrassed daily by #TraitorTrump looking forward to an actual response to covid.   #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica

Republicans trying to figure out how to bash joe biden's vp pick after joe biden has practically chosen a republican 😑 🤔
Just suddenly remembered last night that one of my best friends had a cat named Joe Biden.
Biden picked VP who slept w/married man, 30 yrs older than her, to get appointed to government commissions paying over $400,000. Isn't that theft? Corruption? Conflict of interest?
Biden picked VP who slept w/married man, 30 yrs older than her, 2 get appointed to government commissions paying over $400,000. Isn't that theft? Corruption? Conflict of interest?
I use tweetdeck so much I don't know how to navigate the native twitter site.  Detroit Free Press did a thing on Whitmer's hesitation. She's young and probably wants to build a stronger party base as governor.   Unless Cain had a scoop on Biden, he wouldn't have known
THIS WOULD BE AMAZING IF IT HAD A MONTHLY 2000 DOLLAR STIMULUS IN IT BECAUSE ITS NOT JUST HEALTHY PEOPLE GETTING TJIS AND DYING FROM IT ITS EVERYWHERE SO WEATHER IF UR HOMELESS OR WHO EVER YOU ARE A MONTHLY 2000 STIMULUS WOULD REALLY HELP.
I am still incredulous that Kamala Harris likened coronavirus to Ebola to demonstrate Biden’s ability to lead by stopping an Ebola pandemic. 😂🤣Ebola was an outbreak. 4,000 miles from the U.S. We got 2 cases. It’s going to be a long 3 months.
In ‘must-win’ Michigan, Trump campaign takes fight door to door as polls show Biden with strong lead
Joe Biden mangaled it too!!! And she's his running mate!
You're incapable of having an honest conversation.  I literally advocate for doing all of that RIGHT NOW alongside voting.  I reject that I'll be "at the mercy of Biden" any more than we're at the mercy of someone worse right now.
You never Trumpers don’t want to watch Biden make a fool of himself.  I used to respect you.
Because I care about harm reduction?  Because I'm more under threat by Trump than Biden, even if only a little?
There is only one reason we now have a Biden-Harris ticket....even the Democrats want Trump to WIN!  #MAGA  #Trump2020  #GodBlessTheUSA
Just as I would under Biden because he is also bad
He has scared this white person, right to the point of voting for Joe Biden.
Then why are you spending so much time attacking me, someone whose MAIN FUCKING GOAL is to bully Biden into adopting better policy?
My entire argument is to bully Biden, you're the one saying to keep Trump in office
YES I KNOW, IM NOT TELLING ANYONE TO STOP FIGHTING BACK IM LITERALLY JUST SAYING VOTE FOR BIDEN AND THEN FIGHT BIDEN WHILE HE'S IN OFFICE BECAUSE TRUMP IS WORSE
YES, AND THAT IS LESS BAD AND MAKES IT EASIER TO FIGHT BACK. Do you realize you're literally arguing to keep Trump in office because Biden won't be good enough?  The only choices are Trump or Biden right now, I hate Biden but you're fucking stupid if you think he's just as bad.
I never defended any of these people.  But if you don't think that things will at least be a LITTLE less awful when Biden is in office and we can bully the fuck out of him, agitate, and protest, then you're just lost buddy.  I hate Biden and I haven't ever defended these people
Yes, that's why I fight fascism... but that doesn't mean you shouldn't also engage in harm reduction through electoral means when Trump literally is using secret police, brutalizing protesters, and threatening us to a much greater degree than Biden is.
No, of course Joe Biden doesn’t own
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event
You sick old man. I am WOMEN, HERE ME ROAR, Talk about something really important like how many people have died under your lack of leadership!! Do you think God is happy with you, or any of us for that matter. Talking about Biden and how God feels about him.
Good luck getting anywhere with the Biden Harris ticket.
Maybe somebody needs to let Biden know that. Today during his announcement with Kamala present, he referred to her as Kamela. You know like Pamela only with a K.
Please don’t write any more headlines containing the phrase “Biden tapping a woman”
That’s my point. Biden should be asked those questions too. They all should.
Amen
So you’re telling me Joe Biden is the old dude from O Brother, Where Art Thou?
Give up.  VP Biden and Sen Harris are going to show you the door.
Give up.  VP Biden and Sen Harris are going to wipe the floor with you.
Give up.  VP Biden and Sen Harris are going to kick your ass.
Speculation or assumption. I bet its the "dirt" on Biden and his son Hunter. Remember back when Rudy went to the Ukrain looking for evidence on Hunter and Joe Biden? Yeah bet they pull that joker card out of thin air. They'll say Biden is a criminal or some shit like that. Watch.
Very good article.  While reading it, I thought about how Abp Gregory would handle a president Biden presenting himself for communion and then exiting the church to immediately promote abortion on demand to the assembled press gaggle while holding his bible.
Wyoming Here   /  all the way in this family! On a side note my son turns 18 this year &amp; is also Biden/Harris all the way!
That's what I say to.
Glad you'll base your vote on policy. I'm appalled that Biden's VP pick was limited on criteria - race and gender. He shut out so many other accomplished candidates just because of their biological traits. I do believe that's the true definition of racist and sexist.
Trust me took time. Trial and oh several errors. but the wait was well worth it. Don't know if the age difference makes the differents... shhh don't tall anyone, I'm 52 he is 38. So there is that. 😊
has biden figured out how to login to twitter yet
Liberal leaning Mom asked what I thought about Biden's pick; my response  - I don't agree with picking candidates based on race or gender.
Have to say I found my guy on a video game I came to WY to meet him in person after phone dating for 6 months. I even came to WY in Jan. "Born in Chicago" so I know snow. 🤣 We have been together since 2008, have a 11 year old son together with my other 2 older kids. &amp; Very Happy
Obviously he is scared that Biden won’t show.
Yeah signs for 45 up all over the place. Here and in Montana. I don't understand any of them. I don't feel safe putting a Biden sign up because they are die hard here and they might burn down my house. Not kidding either. So me &amp; my family &amp; close friends just say hidden. 🤣
Yeah I don't think you can get much redder then Wyoming. That's the only thing that sucks about WY. I just don't understand how they can back someone that has done so much damage to farmers. I just don't get it here. But luckily I still have my family to talk to none are for 45!
I want over 1/2 of Biden’s cabinet to be women AND his choices need to be vetted and doled out dribble dribble dribble
C’mon man (Joe Biden voice)! You can’t just say crap like that and bounce!!
"Less people suffer under Biden than Trump"  I don't think that's true. Biden hasn't meaningfully committed to dismantling anything trump has put into place and given how democrats govern it's certain that he won't reverse most or any programs trump has enacted.
"on core legislation and aren't betraying"  what issues do biden/harris agree with the left on?  ICE? M4A? Corruption? Taxes? Police Violence?
I hear what you’re saying and I thought surely they were going to replace Biden too! But I think they would have done it before he picked his VP. I think he’s it.
Joe Biden looks amazing in his well fitted suits.
Biden is doomed
Me too, but I think Kamala will inject some more newsworthy and positive press. I’m in Michigan and the 300 lbs orange fatass is 12% behind Biden right now. He will not win Michigan again. If he does win The GOP will not win the Senate. We can Impeach that MF’r for good this time
Weird Al Yankovick would be more help than Biden in making a tough decision.
No I’m not much of a FB guy. I got on here mostly to f*ck with Trump any way possible! I screwed up by voting for him in 2016. I’m trying to atone for it, so I got on here and will see if can do more for Biden/Harris campaign. Thank you for a laugh! It is healthy, keeps you young
We have several, because we are hunters here. Not just BS hunters, I mean we have gotten our hunting license, have our kill processed so we get the meat out of it. Lovely roasts, steaks, hamburger "Not hamburders 🤣" &amp; sausage made from it. Nothing goes to waste. The right way!
didn’t biden tell Obama not to kill bin laden?
Good for Biden/Harris. It's way better then a racist traitor sitting in the WH! You know the guy that has allowed 160,000+ American's to die because he did nothing for 70 days when it started, "oh that's right he called it the Dem's HOAX" Remember 15 closer to 0.. He was LYING!
VP Biden, they’re removing mail counting machines. They’re completely dismantling the postal service. There needs to be a nationwide plan by the DNC. Ballot drop boxes everywhere? Something must be done. Mail in isn’t going to work. This is getting really scary.
They dont care about those ones i guess the ones biden supposedly touching
As i said will be damn hard to do worse than trump. So im willing to bet biden will be far better
I started clapping to fill in the awkward, uncomfortable silence that followed after Biden introduced Harris, as she was approaching the podium.

They will call her a cop. Question her ability to lead. Lie about her record/her background. They will use Birtherism. Slander both her and Joe. But they have no idea how much black women can take, and still rise above. Biden/Harris will bring competence back to the White House!

Okay but my thing is like... we’re here now. Electoral college is also still here. We have our options. Choose wisely. That is *all* we can do. Complaining and throwing out the obvious (that ya don’t wanna vote either) isn’t gonna help us. Hopefully buying time w Biden will. 🤷🏽‍♀️
When does Kamala get fitted for her official Biden mask?
Yeah, Biden’s VP choice clearly shook him.

It isn't a threat, it's a promise for every good citizen.  No one thinks your a Biden supporter. Biden doesn't support his own candidacy.
It will not change my mind. I’m voting for Biden regardless of who he chooses. ❤️
Black women are the core base of the Democratic Party. Joe Biden can’t win in November without their vote.
Of course it counts, it's exactly what I'm telling you will happen after the election.   They will write a headline that makes it look like foreign actors are against Biden, while the reality is foreign actors are against Trump.👍
There are no reasons to vote for Joe Biden.🤷‍♂️

GOP voters will turn out bigly, Democrat voters will turn out for Trump.  Many Bernie Bros will stay home, after their candidate was screwed again. Many African Americans will vote for Kanye. There is no path for Biden.
You're describing America if Biden wins, which is not going to happen.
This is a great plan. If you can convince enough people to blame Trump for shit that Democratic Governors did, Biden might have a chance.

Trump is going after Gamers. Biden is going to be playing a Game &amp; Watch on his next Zoom interview.
Nope. Today she wrote on a piece on how it depends who Biden picks for his VP. Was disappointed in her and surprised
Excuse me???? 🤨  I have seen plenty of video of the Biden’s attending church. You on the other hand....NOT ONE VIDEO OF YOU ATTENDING SERVICE AT ALL!!!!
Good grief!!! These Biden attack ads in Michigan are pathetic. Your lies and desperation are showing. 🤦‍♀️🙄 Anyone believing them is a moron and needs to just stay home.
Do you believe poor kids are not white are we just simping for Biden?
This is why #NoComradesUnder1k is trending. Leftists have had this monster pushed on them, and we're just supposed to accept it. Fuck Joe Biden.I remember a movie in 2016 how one party try to steal another party election.   Now part 2 is coming In 2020.  This time they use the postal system bc even with help from the FBI they couldn’t do it.    Hunter Biden won’t be used in this Scam

You say Biden is creepy but a case can be made for Trump as well so wouldn't that make you a hypocrite?
New York. You want my money. You better get your streets together. If you think Biden can do it. Look at SF ran so great by house speaker. Poop app and that’s no lie.  Ppl walking nude. Cop cars 10 yr old rusting and broke down. It’s been on major news station in past. Can’t hide
I'm not a socialist and neither is Biden. Biden holds more conservative values than Trump actually. As I feel being a conservative means you're a true man of God, spreading the love of Jesus Christ.
I hope Biden wins.  So the world can laugh harder than they ever have at Americans.  Americans will think its a SNL skit and it really is creepy, sleepy, dementia joe.  Now that scary.  I want him to win so the dumb/Dem look like bigger fools.  Republicans forever after joe.
2/3 a coup, Obama/Biden had a pattern of 8 yrs of spying so why is anyone surprised that they spied on Oppo party and a Presidency  They spied e.g. Merkel, AP, Rosen/Family, Congressional committees; All Americans=Clapper lied under oath; Brennan lied, Comey leak/spied
Biden did not run on M4ALL,Bernie Sanders did and he loss!
lol yeah the #resist in your bio along with several blue wave emoji, a Joe Biden/Kamala header, &amp; profile full of Dem tweets didn’t give it away. You’re an absolute joke 😂 peace
No need to worry about it now! Democrats can now TEXT TO VOTE according to the new law Trump just passed! Since he didn’t want to fund the postal service they’re allowing it for Democrats.   TEXT the word: BIDEN TO: 30330   No registration/ID/signature/mask!   We did it!
No more a problem than the USPS unions supporting Biden and trusting them to safely get ballots where they need to go from Republican leaning Districts. #escapefromnewyork

Voting Biden is freethinking but voting for trump means your a self hating and can’t think for yourself?
Bernard thought courting Joe Rogan was more important than reaching out to Black voters, and Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris had the least amount of money in the race. They’re our nominees Bc they paid attention ✌🏾
But basement Biden is ahead by 7% in national polls with a margin of error of -24%
seriously? you have already answered the question. Any understanding of the modern world from say WWI to the present mandates a vote for Biden. Putin is an active threat to democracy. Pandemics are coming and climate change is real. DJT is a disaster of a human being.
Amongst registered voters. Not likely voters. This poll is skewed. Sorry. I’m totally independent, very left. Not the neolib, CNN/MSDNC left, I mean left left, I talk to real people and read polls daily, no one trusts Biden. I’m sorry.  From everything I see so far, he will lose.
Twitter and YouTube are the only platforms I use, my little sister uses Instagram and my big sister uses FB. They visited me tonight and my older sister told me that biden's predator pics have been circulating on FB and my coworkers have said the same. Anyone else noticed this?
I'm not saying I'm going to fucking like voting for Biden/Harris, but fucking hell people, don't throw all the power Bernie has given us down the toilet because the DNC is a corrupt mess. Water is wet. The DNC will never represent leftists. It can't, it's entire ethos is neo-lib.
they own %97 all media Osigah .   You should probably not like that unless you just want to hear only how great Biden, harris, clinton,  Obama on &amp; on
Biden is wearing the Octogenarian Powersuit Model 5 which allows Kamala Harris to smoothly operate Joes body.
i like the idea of extra pay.  But you guys have to bully people around .  it reminds me of Harris  wanting or bullying gun owners around    She even bullied Judge K. around in the  hearings. She Will  bully  Biden around
shouldn't you be knocking doors or making calls for Biden instead of responding to a 5 month old tweet

Mr. Biden should have said to his  advisers , Harris and the rest of these Lib's are not any good . i should of picked  Hillery.    F. me   i painted myself in a box.    Back to the drawing board guys
Joe Biden is calling for a 3 month mask mandate, but he hasn’t addressed the riots or the looting! GTFO
Me either been a friend of BILL W. For 17 years.. ugh but lately omg 😮
Joe "I don't do white running mates" Biden is definitely turning out to be the real deal.
I look at Biden/Harris and they terrify me. He’s been a liar for his entire career. So phony he was forced out of the race for plagerizing last time he ran for pres. She says out loud that she believes Tara Reid yet still supports Biden. Can’t trust either to go against grain.
I'm blocking you for now.  But when Biden wins 'BIGLY' in November, when Moscow Mitch loses control of the Senate and Pelosi maintains control of the House, I will unblock and remind you of this post.
Ffs. Did someone on the Biden campaign discover Twitter or something?

I need to ask you if you are for or against abortion? &amp; Either for or against the LGBTQ? I am just asking a simple question. I agree with Biden about the economy, &amp; I Pray you are there to help him as well. To be honest, I lost trust in politics years ago.😰
Why did OBAMA TURN HIS back on his ppl and city of Chicago. A few reason.  He thought he was a movie star.  I couldn’t believe how he plaster in so many magazines.   He could have accomplish a lot. But no. He decided he to good for his ppl. He could have tried harder.  Biden?

I saw my first one in metro Detroit last weekend. I've seen plenty of "Anybody but Trump" but exactly 1 Biden. It's crazy. Everybody hates Trump, but nobody likes Biden.

it’s clear you only read Trump tweets. Biden referred to Trump labeling it the “Chinese” virus as xenophobic, not the travel ban. He actually agreed with it because it was backed by science. You’re not going to win the argument that Trump handled this well. Move along ❤️
From both Bidens actually now that Harris (a former Trump dononation recipient) has been declared an honorary Biden
So will you vote for Biden and Harris Ben ?
and you know that how? Biden actually believes in science. Him and Obama literally developed a pandemic response guide in 2016 for the next administration (and it wasn’t followed). Funny you even brought him up when we were talking about Trump’s failed response.
And true to form, if Biden does lose, those with questions will be blamed as opposed to the folks whose job it was for the last 3 almost 4 years to present the right candidates and platform. Or if they win you will have leadership that promised nothing but to not be Trump. 🤦‍♂️
biden shoulda chose big gretch 🤦🏾‍♀️.

Oh cool Democrats must have some more tricks up their sleeve? So who are the utimate nominees who will have integrity?? I could get behind Andrew Yang and Tulsi ticket! Since neither Biden or Harris could even spell integrity let alone represent it.... is this a bait and switch?

Joe Biden would vote for it
You said Biden was a rapist and said you believed the woman that came out against him..Now 6 months later your supporting him..what’s that say about you? That you can be bought like every other politician..
Bush and Biden are both complicit. Bush for proposing it, Biden for voting for and enthusiastically supporting it. How disgusted were you back when Biden did that?

We will have a competent secretary of education who isn't hellbent on destroying public education. We will have people in cabinet positions that aren't simply there because they wrote fat checks to his campaign, like Trump. At least Biden will listen to science.
Biden actually did help right the 1994 crime bill. It’s a valid critique. But at least he now acknowledges the issues of the justice system unlike who we have now. So his statement is bull.
also before I log off for a bit: I absolutely never want to hear any of you fuckers call voting for Biden "harm reduction" ever again especially since harm reduction involves compassion for people and neither Biden or Harris are examples of people with compassion

none of the dems in congress are going to do anything about the USPS and yet I'll get told by hordes of wet brained liberals on this site that not voting for Biden is voting for trump. well maybe the dems should have been a little more fucking proactive in the past 3 years
The Biden sign has the weird E, the Obama signs had the weird O. What’s wrong with just spelling the candidates last name out normally on the damn sign.
So Biden listening to people who have stated they want to tear down America and build it the way they want,Bernie saying Biden is gone far left,then look to Venezuela 4 years destroyed is that what you want cause that’s socialism
I just think we should hold the corrupt politicians like Biden who start all the wars more morally accountable than an E-5 playing video games on Twitch 🤷‍♀️
Disgraced ??? The Obama and Biden spying on trump or Democrats letting cities be destroyed and then asking the tax payers to rebuild them??? What are your selfish goals ?dont vote them solves your problem

At this point I’m just going to vote for Biden in person.
Yes we wouldnt want Joe Biden sending them off to die in pointless wars based on lies or anything.
We are so fortunate to have you as Joe Biden’s running mate. Major hurdles, of course,   Massive sexism (at 72 yrs I so understand), birthism (no surprise), that craziness about no red meat (anything to be just plain crazy). We just fight the good fight!!!!
This should put to rest any notion that Biden doesn’t intend to act like he’s the president when he’s the president.
Oh ok, so Biden lettting kids run his leg kissing strangers little girls on the mouth forget Tara Reid???? Lowest unemployment for blacks ever,where’s the homophobia?? Don’t come with news that spins it man,maybe you should call out Biden and Harris,instead you say he grew

The reason the DNC silenced Julián is because unlike Kamala when he criticized Biden he held his ground. She did it for the debate, he did it because he is a principled leader.

Go back to sleep Joe Biden.
Ms Harris garnered exactly 0 delegates from her own party. Biden chose his running mate based on gender AND race! Is that not the textbook definition of sexism and racism?
Good lord. This “Joe Biden is a puppet of the left” stuff is beyond stupid. It’s demented.
Ah yes, the Lenin who spent like half his writing beefing with Mensheviks and SRs would be ridin’ with Biden
The Anti-Biden people are much better off trying to push Conservatives to vote for Libertarians, but that makes too much sense and is maybe too much work for them.
You should vote for Biden/Harris as many times as you can!  Do you live in Chicago?!?  Lol!
Ppl who blame Trump for the not properly handling the pandemic. How did Obama and joe handle the swine flu. Just stop testing.   I wish we could have the figures Biden vs Trump.  Trump shutting down flights.  WHO, Nancy Joe said trump wrong. Nancy in China town. I wish got it.
If they were citizens with ID and they were all alive, Biden wouldn't have a chance. How about only Americans voting in an American election, what a concept!
The only reason they chose her is so they can call Trump a woman hating racist. She doesn’t even need a brain. Now Biden looks less racist and they have 2 virtue signal boxes checked to respond to Trump with.

The polls in 16 were correct.  I believe Hillary was up by 3 points on Election Day and she won by 3 points.  Polls don’t account for electoral college.  Biden is up way more than 3 right now, if that continues the electoral college won’t matter.  He’ll crush that too.

Biden is a warmonger who along with Obama/Hillary invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and fueled Syrian/Yemeni war and sent American soldiers to fight useless wars. How is any of that showing empathy and leadership?
Vote for Biden anyway.  Count on Biden to put together a team of advisors that he will actually listen to.  He’s not going in thinking he has to know everything.  He just has to know how to lead.  Besides we have a better shot at surviving the next 4 years with Biden for Prez.
A vote for Biden is a vote supporting his warmongering with Obama, their invasion of Libya, their drone bombing in seven countries and the death of 100,000 brown people. F off with your democracy. A vote for Biden is a vote for war and murder.
It’s cool. Biden/Obama led Libyan invasion, drone bombed seven countries, fueled arms to Syria/Yemen conflict and led to 100,000 dead brown people. So if you vote for Biden, I consider you having voted to bomb brown people.

Kamala Harris is such a flip flopper. In the primary she's for Medicare for All. Now on the Biden ticket, no way  She's for whatever you'll vote for.  #PhonyKamala
And she dam* sure doesn’t speak for me. She’s carrying water for white supremacy so she missed the 3500 Black Women who were polled and chose Kamala &amp; Biden at the top. Her and Coondace can sit together in the sunken place... ALONE
How dare you sit down with a white woman and pretend like you speak for all of us. You don’t. You must have missed when they polled 3500 Black Women and Kamala &amp; Biden were at the top. If you want to carry water for White supremacy leave us out of it

A WaPo article described Biden as “much less unpopular” than Hilary Clinton. I guess they thought it would be misleading to describe him as “more popular?” Accurate, I guess.

You’ve all been subjected to a move of the goal posts.  These are ALL right of center candidates. Biden, Harris, even Warren. Bernie was the only centrist.  If you support policy positions that 60% of Americans want, then you’re a centrist. Check the polls - M4A, 60%
I will predict how this is going to go, because this is how Putin does it: (1) In October, Bill Barr will arrest Joe Biden. It doesn't really matter if Biden did anything illegal, he will be in jail. (2) No matter what the outcome, Trump will declare victory in the election. 1/4
They probably have Biden signs in their yard! Hiden Biden!
You mean nobody asked when he stopped beating his wife? What do you expect from MSM?  Think you'll ever hear a question like that posed to Joe Biden? How about ANY serious questions? Like what day is it? What month is it? What city or state are you in Joe? Great vetting MSM!!
These polls suggest that Biden has a lock on the popular vote, and an almost certain lock on a November victory. State polls suggest the same. He's ahead of Trump by 6 points or so in Michigan, for example.
I understand not liking Biden, but for the love of all that is decent just fucking vote for him (through whichever median available) there’s no way he’s worse than this.
Enough ppl wanted Bernie to keep Biden from winning.

Young people sharing memes about how voting for Joe is exactly the same as voting for a literal fascist is ignorant at best and helping trump get re-elected at worst. Joe Biden is far far far from perfect, but at least he respects the election and understands how a virus works.
Too many people in politics believe that the only way to win is the way the last person won. That it can’t be done better. That’s always been BS and Joe Biden is proving that this year.
The first year of the Biden presidency is going to consist of repairing all the damage.
That’s precisely the point of “having to” vote for Biden as someone long disenfranchised ...
Biden / Harris 2020 - "At least we're not fascists". Hopefully that's a winning strategy.
We’ve tried the power of love, we’ve tried the power of reason... if Biden loses or refuses to listen to us, we must turn to the only remaining option... the power of an unimaginable orgy of symbolic property damage, since property is the only thing they give a fuck about
Biden gets to pick one, it’s only fair...

No, VP Biden chose her as his running mate because she will win.
Your privilege is allowing your political purity to outweigh the needs of the many who will immediately benefit from Trump no longer being in office.  Is Biden perfect?  No.  Is he leagues better than Trump. Without question.  Your privilege blinds you to that.

this is accurate, anyone who claims to be a leftist and equates Trump with Biden is an insane person. I don't like Biden at all, but he's getting my vote because he's not Trump.  The democratic party deserves to continue receiving persistent criticism, though.

But hey, at least Biden is a real Catholic and believes in God. The Cheeto doesn’t and yet the religious right accepts him without question. SAD!
I will be unblocking  when Biden defeats Trump in November - just to rub it in his face.
I just hope Joe Biden keeps talking. 😂👌🏽
I really hope it’s not a golden shower thing. Because we already know Trump’s a piss-piggy, and it won’t benefit the Biden campaign at all.
So here we go again the democrats are taking black votes for granted by putting Kamala "the Gorilla" Harris Brown on the ticket. She is suppose to help democrat candidates in the South. Remember " you ain't black if you vote for President Trump. China Joe Biden!

1. military budget thing is irrelevant because they both will do it 2. Biden is pro public choice healthcare which will cover 97 percent of people. a 6 percent increase from now which is millions of people 3. Biden is also GND, lgbt rights, etc the utilitarian calculus is simple

Umm no. Not what happened. He said, they found no evidence of Russian collusion. What you just said was a false translation from the fake news. As far as Ukraine, Biden is up on  federal charges over there for crimes. All trump did was point it out. Dems are really that ballsy

All the questions the Press Corps poses to Trump lately, are softball, lame ass questions. It almost seems you (not you, Kelly) are afraid of him. Just like everyone in his administration. A Press Conf is of little value these days. I don't blame Biden and Harris for passing

Biden/Harris is the most laughable ticket in US history. You have to be so far gone into insanity to vote for these people... Even if you don't like Trump's personality, most of his policies are solid and good for our country.

The only reason Joe Biden has any chance of winning is because of minority voters. If only whites could vote, Trump would easily be reelected.
Here’s what I just CANNOT wrap my head around...Does Jill Biden hate her husband? Or is she so power seeking that seeing her husband utterly humiliate himself doesn’t bother her enough to stop it? Even then has ANYONE told her that Joe won’t have a lick of power should he win?

Life gives us choices. Sometimes, the choices aren’t pleasant. Bernie lost. Biden won. Biden chose his VP. Do you vote for the current person in office or Biden? Being obtuse is complaining about the two choices after 40 states have decided against what you wanted.
Uh... no. That’s literally not at all what I said.   If Ava wants to vote Biden, that’s fine. I’ll likely be voting Biden. I have no choice. But pretending this shit never happened and sweeping it under the rug in the guise of “it’s anti-Black” is mad corny to me.
How about Harris before being a vp candidate called Biden a racist and she also said she believed all his accusers in regards to sexual assault.
If but Trump is your only case for Biden then you have no case at all to me, because the Democrats were suppose to produce a candidate that can beat Trump
Ava, you really shouldnt make any more political films and profit off of the “black plight” after saying you dont care about Kamala and Biden’s history of opression. Its not ignorant but inherently evil.
I’m not saying it’s wrong to vote Biden/Kamala. I probably will. I’m simply saying it’s wrong to pretend Kamala is a perfect, unproblematic candidate. She has harmed the Black community just as much as Trump has. Possibly more.
There are two people on the ballot. I asked which one did you prefer. Your answer was neither. So, it goes back to my original post. You can vote for Biden, trump or abstain. This is a democracy. Not enough people agreed with you during the primaries. So what are you going to do?
Well the joke is on all of us because we will be nothing in 4 years regardless of who is president.  Either a Trump destroys the tax revenues and out debt becomes unfinanciable, or Biden green new deals and sells us to China and out debt becomes unfinanciable.  Pick your poison

Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris have put more Black Men &amp; Women in jail than any Republican I know. I think it’s justified to demand they make it right if they want our vote.
If Ava was saying that she wanted to vote Biden/Kamala while also acknowledging the harmful policies they supported, I’d respect it. But a Kamala vote isn’t something I’m doing happily. And no Black person should be, especially someone who claims to care about mass incarceration.

Kanye is targeting the same Black men 45 is so if they go w/ him in a swing state like Wisconsin ( Milwaukee) and he pulls from 45 number he got last time ( even a little) that helps us. A lot. White ppl who claim Kanye will pull from Biden don’t understand our community. He’s
Anyone can see she’s a phony say or do anything for the job,saying Biden and class in the same sentence shows me you have no clue at all
One of my fellow teachers, that is a Democrat, sent me this about her true feelings on Biden/Harris...
Numbers in Detroit for our primary. That tells me folks really want to see 45 go. I think 45 is definitely trying to take as many Black men from D’s as he can but Kanye running might Actually help in Wisconsin Bc then they won’t vote 45 or Biden but Biden can offset those numbers
Conversation w/ a man I’ve known for years the other day who said He’s never voted for a white person in his life but he’s voting for Biden Bc he can’t stand 45. He didn’t vote for Hillary in 2016. As long as we keep it below 20% we’re good Bc turnout will be high. We did HUGE
Pretty sure that if Joe Biden had picked Gretchen Whitmer as his VP candidate, there would be ZERO questions about her being "eligible." That's birtherism and the GOP in a nutshell.  #birtherism  #KamalaHarrisForVP
Kinda like Biden when he’s getting pounded in the debates.
1st time there. Great time.  Don’t go if you don’t like Trump, and I’m dead serious.  I want to see one person walk down the street with a Biden shirt.   Things are expensive there. But a vender can put a tarp down for the night, and nobody loots.  Tons of 9.99%peaceful white ppl
Biden will lock Trump,in the bunker.
Lol, the Dems are already getting rid of Biden?
Yes they will, The devil is busy, Big Celebrities in NBA will cause record number of minorities 2 vote 4 Biden many will vote 4 the 1st time believing the lies &amp; you can expect Kamala Harris 2 be on Oprah show &amp; cover of her magazine wit Oprah's cult following support #Trump2020
President? So you know that Biden is a place holder???
Joe Biden called on the Governor’s to issue a mask mandate. Trump needs to clean his ears out.

Ask her about how she thought Biden was a creep, you know before she was selected to run with him
It was opposite day for the Obama Biden Administration
Biden only wants to be president because the desk is shiny and the title but as for the responsibility he'll leave that to the puppeteers
Now now we all know behind every strong man is a crooked Biden
Sure, during a time when people are protesting police brutality &amp; saying #DefundThePolice Biden choosing the cop who governed like a Republican isnt a liability  You people just say shit. Thats all. You just run your mouths &amp; let the cultist behavior of your followers do the rest
Trump is already blaming Biden for everything and calling him a liar... also said number 1 in the world for Ventilators?!... please end this shit #TrumpKillsUSPS #TrumpThreatensAmerica
how did the Dem end up with sleepy, creepy Joe with Dementia? Ppl want to vote Trump out. The whole world can laugh louder at all s with Biden. Why didn’t he speak at Lewis's funeral?  If he gave a great speech, he could have won.  He went to the funeral.  But??!
It's already collapsed and the world is already laughing. It's time for a Biden rebuild.
Trump has pretty much eliminated daily intelligence briefings. Biden has already started receiving them.  via  One must have a modicum of intelligence to digest "Intelligence Briefings"

Biden thinks he's calling for a date with a masked man.
A slim majority of voters, 53 percent, approve of Biden picking the California senator to join the Democratic ticket, according to a POLITICO/Morning Consult flash poll conducted on Wednesday, the day after the selection was announced.
That’s what I think when Joe Biden says he will VETO Medicare4All even if it passed in Congress.   #NeverBiden #NeverKamala
Every time you feel the urge to take a shot at Biden or Harris, redirect that shit toward Trump. There is a country to save.
So far my political calls have been:  2016 - If Dems block Bernie n give it to Hilary, Trump will win 2019 - Dems r def not gonna let Bernie have it, gonna b Joe Biden  Early 2020 - Biden is gonna pick Kamala Harris  My track record is on point, how do I get paid for this?
7 Ways a Biden-Harris Administration Will Support American Moms
I’m not Biden or trump. But the initial post has to do with trump.. so I’d say mentioning him is fair game I don’t know what in the world you’re smoking
you say the right is racist and sexist then look at who you picked for your vp. it is based on race and sex. do you think they looked into anything else? Biden’s top 5 choices were all women and 4 of them were black. Who is the sexist and racist now?
no biden voters allowed to read my tweets

real unfortunate that a vote for anyone other than trump is a vote for biden :-/
Someone better wake up Biden and let him know he mispronounced his VP pick’s name 8/13.
Imagine having to vote for Joe Biden the first time you get to vote in a Presidential election.
Post the rest of the segment where Biden gets it wrong a day after Tucker.  🤣
So what are you going to call Biden?  He messed up her name the day after Tucker.  And it’s his VO pick.  🤣
Lol.  Biden can’t pronounce her name correctly either.
You may want to mention to Biden he should probably pronounce it correct also.  🤣🤣
“Every single American should be wearing a mask when they are outside for the next three months at a minimum.”
Can someone ask if masks are so important why wasn’t she wearing one when visiting Biden in taxpayers money.
Biden and Harris have received their predictable and scripted directives and wasted no time proclaiming the “benefits” of contact tracing and mask wearing.    Sickening.    This is the election of our lives.    If you STILL think this is about a virus...   All hands on deck.
According to one expert, “[VP choices] can change voters’ image of the nominee, and they can also move voters’ perceptions of the presidential candidate’s ideology.”
You know what’s worse than keeping convicted criminals in jails for crimes they were legally convicted for? Separating children from families and locking them in concentration camps. Time to get off the high horse. I wanted a Yang/Gabbard ticket. Boo hoo, now go vote 4 Biden.

Former First Lady Michelle Obama‘s first public post on Kamala Harris becoming Biden’s VP pick: “I’ve been thinking about all those girls growing up today who will be able to take it for granted that someone who looks like them can grow up to lead a nation like ours.”
Joe makes me think that we could actually be better off with Trump! At least in 2024 we'll have another chance. If Biden's win we're looking at 12 years of neo-liberals nightmare.
The world has been laughing at the U.S. since Jan 20, 2017 when you were inaugurated. When Joe Biden wins this election, the world will breathe a collective sigh of relief.
Lol!  He can’t really be this dumb can he?  If she or Biden were at all left, Biden wouldn’t have had to cheat to be the nominee &amp; Harris wouldn’t have had to drop out because of her terrible record and ridiculously low poll numbers.  This “radical left” BS is a losing strategy.
What a big difference between these two men. Trump needs a walker to walk. While Biden is cruising around town on his bike
Trump can’t want to win.  He keeps claiming that Biden &amp; Harris are leftists that want to raise taxes on the rich, implement M4M, demilitarize the police and other things that poll very high.  Not a winning strategy.  If I didn’t know better, I’d vote for the person he describes.
Yep a very cynical ploy by Trump. Vote for Joe Biden!
You won’t see this on the fake news media cnn cbc cbcnews cbcwindsor     fake news  had it on for 10 seconds and cut to back door biden and kamala.…

please help support the Biden Harris ad campaign with $.
The fact you all are grasping at straws to discredit Kamala shows how concerned and surprised you were that Biden chose her and I absolutely love to see it.
Thank you for agreeing with me. You’re right, you weren’t talking about Biden’s covid response, but you quoted my tweet about Biden’s covid response with a completely new topic and acted like my tweet you quoted was in opposition of your comment. Be honest in your discourse plz
This wasn’t an argument about Biden? This discussion is specifically about trump, so why wouldn’t we include trump?
The idea of the speakers is to bring hype to the Biden/Harris ticket and to make a plea to their followers to get on board. One tangible outcome would be that he gets more recognition that may help bring him, his ideas and policies closer to Washington.
Tbh, I feel the same way about Biden. 😅
You’re right... This whole thread is ridiculous. You went from one strawman to another, with nothing but BS op-eds as your “proof”.   All because my gun ownership won’t change under Biden and I won’t match your anger. 😂
A great error! Biden is a devout Catholic and proud of it. You owe a huge apology to Biden and your church members.
Has Joe Biden congratulated Trump on the historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates?
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
The Biden/Harris anthem.
Hey Joe Biden I see you have a nasty pet running with you. You can kiss my ass thinking you gonna mandate anything to me. I wear a mask when I'm out only. See I love the American people that's why I wear mine. Your a disgrace to us good americans. All Americans stock up on
Specifically, its like public transit in Metro Detroit.  Honestly, I'm usually pro-voting. But crime bill Biden and Kamala the cop have me pretty discouraged.
It wasn’t Bernie who got robbed, it was his young voters and their hopes of a better future. With Biden nothing will fundamentally change
Biden will probably have his hands all over Harris since he likes touching women and she is a nasty animal that needs here rabies vac.These 2 are the biggest joke I have ever seen. DON'T VOTE FOR BIDEN N HARRIS THEY WILL F#*K US AMERICANS OVER VERY BAD DON'T BE
Oh really?  Then why did she waste taxpayer money and take a chartered plane to visit Biden last week?  🤔
Ever notice how Biden is comfortable enough in his own skin that he allows &amp; encourages everyone to call him Joe? Meanwhile liddle lyin’ dondie is so insecure he DEMANDS everyone call him Mr. President or Mr. Trump or Sir? Except Melania of course who everyone says calls him tiny
#RepublicanSenatorsAndCongressmen Have you people got no spine and no balls? The writing is clearly on the wall that Obama, Biden, Comey amoungst others colluded to overturn the duly elected president in 2016. Committing treason and an attempted coup of the US Prsidency! Wakeup!!
You haven't been paying attention. Our country has already collapsed thanks to your incompetence &amp; ignorance. Biden &amp; Harris will bring our country back from your disastrous administration. #BidenHarris2020
Mask mandate nationwide (including outdoors)  suggested for the next 3 months by Joe Biden
I know we all hate Biden/Harris. But if Dems can take the senate, Bernie will be the chair of the budget committee, he will have more pwr than the VP. I think we should concentrate on taking whatever power that we can.
My super power would be to snap us right to Jan21, 2021 for Biden’s inauguration.
Biden/Harris..... Making America California. I’ll pass 👎🏽
Per Biden's rule, perhaps you're not really Latino. 😉
2) Lets face it.Trumps a big fat egotisical baby who whines when he doesn’t get his way. He’s run this country into the ground and God help Biden for having to pick up the pieces from the hell Trump created. Not even including the even BIGGER racial divide he created
1) Because Biden will not make us an embarrassment to other countries. He would’ve done what was necessary to prevent Covid- clossd schools, masks mandates instead of encouraging the spread. He’d not hold funding over states and babygvt functions that disagree with him.
wow just amazing are President Trump gets things done period.  President Trump does say some probably not good stuff sometimes but he gets things done for are country.  it is refreshing not having a bs artist in office like obama a do nothing president.  whom would vote for biden
I think Dems will be surprised as to how #Biden will involve everyone in major moves of any kind. Back in the early 70’s we hippies turned vegetarian, worried about lake &amp; air pollution, built energy-saving homes &amp; planted our own foods on farms. We oldsters cared for the earth!
The lesson I learned from 2016 is that centrist neolibs like Biden, Clinton, Kerry, and Gore usually lose and shouldnt be nominated.
Haha! After 3 plus years of  the Trump campaign is trying to scare Biden voters with education fears? Hahaha! Seriously, DeVos and her failures is a reason to vote for Biden!
The only thing he inherited from Obama and Biden was a failed healthcare system.  Not sure what planet you inhabit but come join us on earth when you get a chance.  Thanks.
Also if Biden wins we are for sure 8 years away from a truly progressive candidate.
Remember that 270 Billion the Democrats just stole from me?  Apparently they were gonna replace it with the VP and 200,000.00 job by withdrawal.  Nope, Kamala wants Biden’s life and job...my best guess.  I don’t commit crimes.  Not that type of party.  Fox for President 2020
I was reading about Biden's position on a $15/hr national minimum wage and I can't forget the insufferable #YangGang is still belligerently fighting against this. Yang himself has said he would get rid of minimum wage in favor of UBI.
friendly reminder that donald trump used to donate to democratic political campaigns. most notably hillary clinton, joe biden, and kamala harris 🙃
I just watched your YouTube piece, from another follower, “Get the f¥%k in the Biden Minivan”, &amp; it made my day! I even closed my eyes &amp; when I heard Barry White I had to laugh. I think I was just out of HS when that was released! Thanks for the lift of spirit!👍
Huge communist✅ Maybe you could explain your whitehouse meeting with Biden, Comy, Rice...to overthrow the results of the last election? Maybe you could explain why mail-in voting is so damn important to democrats. Maybe you could explains your changing in HR-4310 for propaganda
You got to watch governor Whitmer she all mad cause she can't see glory and stars now that she was not picked by Biden,She is a sell out,she suppose to care for michiganders but she sure was kissing biden feet to be elected vp.another joke
Hey Kamala Harris, Care to explain why prison stocks rose, as soon as u were announced as Biden’s running mate? Or are u just gonna continue doing what your doing at the expense of others. I hate choosing the lesser of two evils
Hey there's the 2 biggest liars and crooks around. Hope yall know all the blood spilled from americans and the children are on your heads Kamala and Biden and rest of the dems.Democrats are nasty,liars,crooks and MURDERERS. KAMALA AND BIDEN SUCK WITH THE OTHER DEMS
The cognitive dissonance of libs still winching about Brett Kavanaugh while simultaneously smearing Tara Reade and defending Joe Biden is really amazing.
I always wonder how tf Trump shoves Big Macs down his gullet every day and has even lived this long. What kind of sick joke is the universe playing? And Biden looks like he could croak literally any second. It’s the same feeling of waiting for the screensaver to hit the corner.
Where is the Biden or Whitmer cruise?! Haha People that were once split are voting for Trump or not at all. Drive around Michigan, cities that were once blue are now red. Truth hurts
#SayHisName  it's sad i have to hear about this on twitter i guess the news is to busy bashing joe biden.

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
So, Biden appointed his executioner, Kamala Harris. Too bad.  Fox for President 2020.
They're gonna keep paying them until the DNC gets their way.  They ain't winning the presidential election.   They will get smashed and rounded up after Trump wins his 2nd term.  If, by some miracle,  Biden wins. You won't see them anymore
Are there any former govt workers who should be put back into govt in the Biden Admin that Trumpski fired?! Comey, Brennan, or any others?!
Kamala said she would give me the VP.  Only way she could give it to me is a withdraw.  She won’t do it for my kid, Darla. Why? So, Kamala must be planning to kill Biden for the Presidency herself.  Not a withdrawal? Darwin, Gretchen, Dunnings? My guess. Fox for President 2020.
Is Kamala Harris going to campaign from Biden's bunker with Him!
It’s been 48 hours since Biden made his announcement about Harris, and already it’s like 2008, 20012, and 2016 combined to make this horrible racist-sexist monster that I’m afraid will grow in size until we lose again and things get even worse.
Joe Biden will be 78 in November.
I Agree.  Yovanovitch, Hill and Vindman should all be brought back into the Biden Administration in some diplomatic or national security capacity.  They were all wrongly retaliated against by the "Orange One".
Y'all got to imagine voting for more than just survival. I promise you politics are more complex than that. There are valid criticisms of the Biden/ Harris ticket. You got to let that rock and figure how to hold Biden's administration accountable.
There's no way I'm risking my life for Kamala and Biden  #StayHome
Be prepared for the anti-trumpers to complain that Russia has a vaccine before us &amp; that it is his fault #trump2020 I can already hear Biden say that
Then you want President Trump! Biden has already caved to the Mob!
Make them viable during the midterm and primaries. Voting for them now is wasting a vote and giving Trump the win. Biden and Kamela would be the better option of the only two we actually have.

Wth did the President really say this shit.  Sabotage by a President...damn Trump serious. You put a bully in the White House and he bullying. The President said they, not voting for me well I'm gonna stop funding the place you using to vote for Biden. Gangsta President.
In short, fascism won’t be changed in one election, but we can chip away at it by voting in the direction that we want. Like it or not(and I fucking hate it) Biden is our most progressive VIABLE candidate. And that sucks ass but it’s reality.
Joe Biden IS Trump. No more corporate owned whores playing leader. Tear it all down. Watch this now. Oldie but complete truth.
And look at the fact that RBG’s term is ending. You DO NOT want trump to be in command when it’s time for her to be replaced... anyway, my point is no voting for Biden won’t immediately change anything but it will make it easier to get the change we want to see in the future
She signed to agree with Trump on more than a few unsavory issues, and with the “Defund the police” sentiment being so strong atm it’s just another example of Biden being shortsighted in the face of his goals. “I Need to get my black vote back up, get a black lady right?” Wrong1
Haven't Joe Biden and Kamala Harris receive their secret service protection yet?
One single person to take command of everything. Look at Trumps cabinet and how damaging they have been to the country. Let’s be honest here, Biden probably isn’t going to even live through his full term. But the cabinet he puts in will have be way better than the current one
So bad lmaoooo, meanwhile Biden’s campaign team is putting out great videos
Future that I would want to see, NOT because Biden represent the future I want to see, but because if he gets elected Trump will be out office. My main focus is just getting trump out of there ASAP because he can’t handle this pandemic. Biden sucks but he at least will be able to
With that out of the way let’s address the second thing you said. I’m not claiming voting for Biden will end the oligarchy. Not even close. Voting for one candidate can’t accomplish that, but that’s not the goal of voting for him... voting for him is just one step toward the

Postal union endorsed Biden. No one trusts them to send cash in the mail, no one trusts them with votes.
Maybe Biden is the plant to help Trump win , like who’s to say they not on the same size
the united states operates on a plurality rule system. If Trump gets 39%, Biden gets 32%, and 29% vote for Kanye on the meme, Trump wins.
The Biden campaign is looking more and more like "Weekend at Bernies."
20 million Black babies murdered since 1973.  I guess those black lives don't matter to Biden or Harris.
I know I’ve asked this before but why was it ok for Bernie to be anti-busing but not Biden? And just so we’re clear, Bernie isn’t anti-brown and he’s not a segregationist. He and Jimmy Carter and Biden had their reasons none of which were rooted in racism.
My vote is my business you have your one vote also Trump hasn’t wrote crime bills against colored people like Clinton/Biden so what’s the BLACK AGENDA what We getting

Why won't Joe Biden condemn the Riots, Looters or Attacks on Police Officers?  Does he support this?
Joe Biden picking Harris over Abrams gives me the same feeling as the Seahawks not giving the ball to Marshawn on the goal line
Biden can't remember the 1990's
There is a large number of young people who are not sold on Kamala and that's understandable. If she wants to win over that trust, her and Biden need to come up with 1-3 year plan to legalize weed nationally and get everyone who is locked up for weed out.
America makes progress after kicking and screaming and whining, but progress is made just the same. We need to work to make sure the Trump years were just a blip of “waaa we don’t wanna” sandwiched between Obama and Biden/Harris, with a more just and equal America for everyone.
Biden/Harris theme song.
No he didn’t that’s a lie. It was a stagnant economy with slow growth and burdensome taxes and regulations. President Trump worked on those two things which allowed the economy to grow. Lowest unemployment speaks for it self. Biden/Harris will kill the economy &amp; millions of jobs.
Joe Biden needs Black voters. So why does he keep insulting us? | Benjamin Dixon
Trump is a narcissistic sociopath with dementia like his father, ppl have got to stop covering up for him. This country is in danger &amp; all the GOP cares about is their own profits and power. U must vote 4 Biden/Harris your life and the country depends on it.
Some people say crazy things.  No big deal. Unless you find asshats to hire them and a few million idiots to believe them.
I can’t believe how many people say Joe Biden is a pedophile when they have absolutely zero information to back up the claim.
2/3 let Voters exactly what Harris/Biden promised Dem Voters-    Get  info on Harris re not prosecuting Catholic Church abusers &amp; his documents- how she went after Sickle Cell Student then talk to
attack Harris’/ Biden’s Primary positions! Why, bec Harris will certainly take over from Biden- then will push her own agenda - if Biden wins and can remain Pres for 1st term - I believe he will resign near the end so Kamala will be Pres leading into the  election 1/3
the trump &amp; biden campaigns both   acuse one another of doing the same thing.
Joe Biden raised $26 million in the 24 hours after he named Kamala Harris as his running mate, doubling his previous one-day record.
There is n o doubt Trump economy was the best before the pandemic you cant blame that on him blame China or get better ticket than Biden/Harris
I think that Biden chose Harris *because* she wasn’t afraid to call him out like that; and he knows she’ll not only help him shape better, more inclusive policies, but also put him back in line, if need-be. But then again, just my opinion, like yours is just your opinion.
Okay that’s not a good thing, but that’s child’s play compared to systematically destroying the USPS in the middle of a global pandemic. Not even in the same realm. Like I said, Biden isn’t good, but Trump is off the charts fascist. It’s not even a comparison.
No need to be rude when I’m being civil and polite. Also, our current #POTUS is known for blatant racism, so your comments could have been as equally pointed at both presidential candidates, as they could at Biden and Harris.
Gov. Whitmer : Mr.Biden ,  i recommend you pick a black female any one we don't care  She has to be extreme left  like a Harris or the other goofy one   thanx
okay then i don’t wanna hear shit about progressives or “bernie bros” losing biden the election in november. y’all don’t want or need our votes but then blame us for everything when shit goes south. and for the record I still am voting for biden.

I don’t like Biden nor Harris but imma vote for them cuz I hate that orange nigga we have now
Unemployment claims have steadily been at over one million since March, yet they’ve created more jobs in the last 3 months than Biden and Obama created in their 8 years in office 🤔 make it make sense. How is it so easy to straight up lie?
Yes and I’m choosing to vote for the guy who’s not actively engaging in voter suppression(fascism). Don’t get me wrong I can’t stand Biden or Harris, but we can’t let Trump erode our democracy another 4 more years
Don’t disrespect Biden
A presidential primary campaign and many hit pieces from leftist breitbart dot com later, and it’s seen as “the sky is falling” for progressives when Joe Biden picks Harris has his running mate
Black women historically in politics &amp; beyond have been labeled "angry" or "mad," a trope forced upon them for being assertive. A group of nearly 700 Black women last week in an open letter decried racist &amp; sexist tropes ahead of Kamala Harris being announced as Biden's VP pick.
Now she's advocating for police to be arrested when for decadds as prosecutor she protected them?! 🤣 nice front Kamala. Biden put this vicious law in play with Obama and she gung-ho supported and protected the police. 🙄
What more could we ask for! She’s already proven to have zero integrity and just like Biden, the more she says, the worse she looks! Thank you Clintbama’s.... Excellent choice!
Our people need to continue the action. It will be a 4 year break period if Biden wins. Black people wi get soft and sit down which isn't going to help at all
Pushing the left even farther away with your “suck it up” and vote for Biden/Harris strategy.

Wife, mother, retired professional living in the suburbs. Biden/Harris all the way. The insanity has to stop.
The Kamala Harris announcement was the first breath of pure oxygen America needed to get us back in the fight. Just please promise us that they will arrest Trump right there on the podium while Biden is swearing in! If I see that happen, I know JUSTICE IS COMING!  Prosecute Trump
She recommended that Biden pick the most qualified candidate for the job. There, I fixed it.
Mr. BIDEN, what's "A Racial Jungle?" Does  know what it is? Is she Black Enough' to know? I want to know where the integrity of my old America went... none of you clowns represent us anymore... not a damn one of you! Your lies are no different than the others!

So you know PAC wouldn’t vote for Biden but don’t know Hermain Cain in hell? 😵🤦🏾‍♀️
Hmm ok these are bad policies to back, so I probably wouldn't be a fan of hers or Biden, but I'm going to vote for them this upcoming election so that we don't end up with Trump

People who critiqued Obama from the left got shouted down, especially immigration activists. It worries me that the same will happen for those of who us who still seek progressive, meaningful change if Biden / Harris are elected.
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia  via  Trump funded propaganda network OAN's "reporter" feeds Dotard questions that paint Biden as "Anti Fascist," as if that's a bad thing. Hitler=Fascism
Largely without any major investment from the Democratic Party, Black women have worked through grass-roots organizations to register new voters and motivate them to cast ballots.

You need to pick a nickname and stick with it. It’s too late in the game to rebrand Sleepy Joe. Also, trying to paint Biden-Harris as “radical left” is ridiculous and won’t win you a single vote. Dumb!
Dont understand  all the people that will vote for BIDEN AND HARRIS . just amazed how anyone could vote for these two . Quite sad actually , like they will do anything  positive ! We are screwed if they win . This country will no longer be  AMERICA as we once knew.
Kanye throwing his name in the election is going to do more harm than help. We need ALL of our votes to go to Biden and Kamala (unfortunately), and if voters are ignorant enough to vote for Kanye (who isn’t gonna win) it splits votes where they don’t need to be split.
" inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden and then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground"
Maybe Maria will step in it like  and other Fox Opinion Hosts.  ‘Biden will not make it on the ticket’?....I think I can hear her balls dragging on the ground they are so big. #FireJudgeJeanine 🍷
That's not really true because jobs were not "created". They were just people going back to work from the stay at home order. This is not to say the Obama/Biden jobs were legit jobs either. I'm just saying we should be more honest

In the spring, Gov. Whitmer sent word to Biden’s team that while she was flattered, she no longer wanted to be considered for the running mate slot, the AP reports. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman.
Reading bout kamala Harris is giving me a headache tbh there are so many conflicting reports! But even from what i read she’s better than both biden and trump tho
Biden doesn't know where he is. I'd be embarrassed to defend him. #WheresHunter
Fantastic 2 days of introducing Biden/Harris! Speeches brought tears of joy. Truth, empathy &amp; plans for America! Bravo team, well done!
One Tough Question For DOJ If Biden Is Elected: Whether To Prosecute Trump
*by comparison to Trump-Pence. There are a lot of people in prison for bs marijuana charges (or simply for being poor and black/brown) who would argue how fundamentally decent Biden or Harris are overall. But, yes, we have to vote for them.
Biden can't get a sentence out without messing up his words. With either choice for President, we're doomed.
Most candidates run to the center in the general election. Biden is moving left.  via

Typical white fauxgressivism coming into the mentions of a internment camp survivor Bc a privileged White boy got his feelings hurt &amp; u probably didn’t even read Biden’s plan. BTW, Biden has done more than Bernard has on climate change. The Paris Accords.. Biden. Please point me

I’ll remind you my opener was me pointing out that despite all the NRA scare tactics, my gun rights will continue to be intact under Biden/Harris.   You then wanted to whine and argue about a bunch of BS hypotheticals. The only one complaining is you. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Biden did ZERO in 8 years to blunt China's military and economic buildup. Now he wants us to believe he's going to be tough on China? Fool me once...
Don’t forget about Trump. He went from racist, predator reality star to President and will win it all again unless we all choke down a vote for Biden. I’m not thrilled either, but perhaps in 4-8 years we can get someone truly good. #hope #endthedichotomy

If you're going to watch, look at them like your friend's abusive partner.   They attempt to gaslight, then they make subtle threats, you watch them,  and they're never too much of a mess when you're close.   Just be ready to act when they show who they are. Support #Biden/Harris
Man he really flew down those last 10 feet, fucking idiot. Biden could run circles around humpty dummy!

That seems right, Biden putting in the work while the lazy ass narcissist enjoys the ride
I just want to see how the Liberals act to the critics that talk about Harris having descendants that owned slaves . Also about her accusing Biden being a sexual harasser &amp; now he’s the cats meow . If this was a conservative, the Libs would be marching &amp; crying .Tad hypocritical
That’s why they can’t say anything none of them have been proven it’s supposed to be innocent until proven, but in the Democrats eyes it’s guilty until proven and then will still kill you but now you talk shit about Biden Harris and they don’t like it kind of funny isn’t it.?
None of those women accusing trump were credible either so, if you’ll allow Biden to freely touchy and Harris is ok with it, then you out to stop talking about Trump and false cnn msnbc fake news as well. Me said grab em but no proof he did so that’s that!
Joe Biden : Demagogues are great for Jewish worshipers
Polls and projections aren't the same but polls are accurate and were correct in 2016, 2018 etc. The margins are different and the political climate is not comparable. If nothing crazy happens in 80 days this is an easy W for Biden.
Every single one of these “trading” or “fintech” accounts I follow is against the Biden/Harris campaign simply because....our capital gains taxes/Wall Street *MIGHT get taxed more????   Fuckin greeedy assholes, greed always prevails, especially in America.
Mad love and respect for your choice!! You're going to make history like your former president did.. Obama was the beginning of the being woke movement. Thank you Biden Harris for giving the nation hope!!
And Biden doesn't even know wtf he's talking about ALL day in every interview!  Build back better!!!  Where did he snag that from.  #plaigarism  Again!
I agree #blm is an army of murderous bigots  And the KKK was created by democrats And Democrats were the ones that owned slaves And Biden and Kamala fought for years to lock up minorities.  Funny all the racism in the DNC,  and they accuse conservatives of being racist
When black voters beef about how ‘black’ or how many blacks a candidate threw in jail, this is what Biden meant when he said we’re incapable of diverse, critical thinking.....it’s that kind of thinking that got Trump elected over Hillary in these swing states. Be better.
You forgot to name all the other #dnc sex criminals..... Bill Clinton  Joe Biden Adam Schiff  And dozens upon dozens more  Kinda weird, all the sex offender masters on the #dncplantation isn't it?

Yeah. You don’t. It’s not. Lol. It’s like the bare minimum act. And even then, Biden still sucks. He’s a weird old white guy who wrote the prison bill and seems like a fucking creep. But, at the end of the day, it’s more likely he keeps some people from dying.
The Biden/Harris memes are so spicy lmaoooo fuck the dnc
Lets not forget this
The real kamala could beat Biden/kamala at the polls 😂
She did compare the 2 and response! You can’t compare they 2 they are not even close too the same thing. Kamala is a fucking 🤡- Biden just lost the election by naming her VP! I think Biden is trying too throw the election
Biden/Harris, with the full support of Big Gretch and Michigan. And the added cheerleading from Canada. Sorry we can't do more than encouragingly love and support. Canada endorses Biden/Harris with open arms and look forward to our family reuniting
Herman Cain really died from a disease that  he could have prevented getting ro come back from the dead to tell us that Biden Harris 2020 is going to be nuts. THEIR candidacy is the nuttiest thing here? Twitter need to shut his people down.
Not saying it’s right, but it’s because the rhetoric is different, right? Trump does a lot of his racial damage with his words. Biden’s actions aren’t progressive at all but he doesn’t spew hate speech and mobilize the radically racist right. I could be wrong tho
Sounds as if  will have my vote. Hell, even Jo Jorgenson will be better than Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris at this point.
Trump empowers ALL Americans by giving them more opportunities, more of thier hard earned money, more jobs, more religious freedom, more school choice, more liberty. Kamala empowered young black men by sending them to prison, Biden empowered blacks thru segregation...all facts
I'm a progressive and I am NOT voting for Biden and Kamala. Pass it on.
So did The Simpsons predict a Biden/Harris ticket and were they in the white house, we need to know
*herman laying in peace*  Biden: kamala is my running mate  Herman:
Fuck Joe Biden
Democrats don't like her also. remember the last debates she was in. I still don't know how Biden could pick her   for what she said to him
We are going to have a Conservative majority in November. You sex workers should vote for Trump. Because under a socialist regime of Biden and Harris you will no longer be making money. You will have your financial assets seized by the government.

lol, There attacking the President also.  Biden the Classic  messed her name up on the dog &amp; pony show news conference. But Biden picked her for her Race &amp; being a female. She was very thankful
Harris will start giving everyone “her word, as a Biden”
She clearly must be watching MSNBC &amp; CNN... the demoncratic news. What’s wrong with your memory? It wasn’t a couple of months ago that YOU were reading Biden the riot act for being a racist. What I’ve learned democrates cast blame for all they themselves have committed. COWARDS
Bernie: sets of easy to digest plans with bills backing them up  Biden: I’m gonna restore the soul of America and I’m not Trump. C’mon man!
