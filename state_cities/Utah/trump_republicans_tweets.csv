Trump is casting seeds of doubt casting on his probable defeat.  The delegitimization of the election is already underway.
I believe they knew what they were doing when they passed the horrible NDAA that's enabling Trump's domestic warfare, and ramped up the endless wars and debt that Trump has only continued.   is our only hope for real change this year. #VoteGoldToSaveAmerica
Straight from the donkey's mouth:   Donald Trump doesn't care about our rights. Like Biden, he gives lip service and occasional platitudes and "what about the other guy?" Vote Libertarian if you really value your rights. Dr. Jorgensen would abolish the ATF.
Why is nobody talking about the missing 11%?   is out there for everyone who wants a good candidate to vote for instead of warmongering, debt-happy, corporatist, constitution-hating Trump and Biden. This election is too important for them to be running.
Why did Republicans nominate Trump for a second term? The party of conservative values and law and order no longer exists, it's a sham. Join  and vote for  and other Libertarians if you still value your rights.  #TrumpIsNotWell #VoteGoldToSaveAmerica
"This election is too important for Trump and Biden to be running" -    Libertarians will make waves this year. Why not endorse a good candidate instead of an octogenarian warmonger who fanned the flames of mass incarceration and endless war and debt?
Don‚Äôt you hate it when Trump says something dumb and everyone asks you to refute it?  Mitt speaks out without hesitation. Why can‚Äôt you?
This election is too important for Trump and Biden to be running. Maybe they can try again in 2028 after Dr.  scales back the federal government to its constitutionally enumerated powers so who wins the Presidency can't hurt anyone so much.
Nah. We only "don't have a chance" because defeatists and shills keep saying so and don't report on our candidates or include them in polls. I'm going to use my little vote to move the Libertarian Party closer to 5%, a far greater victory than electing Trump or Biden. #VoteGold
No. Duverger's Law is a self-perpetuating historical observation, not a rule. If enough people vote for a candidate she will win.  But even if she doesn't, getting the Libertarian Party to 5% so we can have a level playing field is more of a victory than electing Biden or Trump.
POTUS Trump has got to lose the election so overwhelmingly, there can not be even a tiny bit of doubt of the outcome or things will get ugly.  #WeWillVote
By law Election Day is statutorily set as "the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November" equalling "the first Tuesday after November 1‚Äù.  Trump CANNOT move or delay the election.
Try to list some reasons we should remove Trump without touching federal powers enabled and supported by Biden.  The problem is how much power the Oval Office has, not who sits in it. Dr. Jorgensen would scale the federal government back to its constitutionally enumerated powers.
Getting the Libertarian Party to 5% of the vote would be a far greater victory than electing Biden or Trump.  When do we stop crawling back to our old masters and start voting for good candidates? I say now. Duverger's Law is self-perpetuating.
Getting a 3rd party to 5% would be a much more significant victory than crawling back to D or R yet again. Biden and Trump are both awful candidates, one is just awful more loudly than the other. There's a reason they're keeping Biden locked up.

It's literally not. If she gets enough votes, she'll win.  But even if she doesn't win, I won't regret voting for her to help get the Libertarian Party to 5% so we can get federal funding next election. That's much more of a victory than electing Biden or Trump.

Trump just spoke with Putin and never asked about bounties on US soldiers.  But you'll give him a pass.

Your opinion is wrong but I respect your right to have and share it üòâ  Dr. Jorgensen is a great candidate, or at least streets ahead of Biden or Trump.  Stop supporting the duopoly. A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump and this election is too important.  Vote for real change.

Next time Trump says he cares about our troops just remember this.
You do realize trump has no control over the NYPD right? That‚Äôs a state and local issue.
I know you are Canadian and don‚Äôt know US law. Trump has no control over the NYPD, that‚Äôs a state and local issue, so trump has nothing to do with this situation at all.
Trump doesn‚Äôt have control over the NYPD, holy shit. Y‚Äôall say he‚Äôs a dictator but then you want him to intervene where he has no jurisdiction.
For one this is the NYPD so trump has no control over them, that‚Äôs in the had of state government. They use unmarked vehicles to get close to suspects that have warrants for their arrest without the suspects fleeing the scene at the sight of a police vehicle.

"Illegal?"  REALLY??      Just for the hell of it, Trump, PROVE IT'S "ILLEGAL???"
To each their own. I think Trump and Biden fall from the same tree, but I appreciate that you've thought about all the options and you're not just voting because muh team. Take time to examine Dr. Jorgensen's platform if you haven't already:
Being "progressive" by common definition is not a goal of mine, and Biden was VP during the presidency that enabled Trump's domestic warfare. He's not a good candidate.
If there were somehow really only 2 candidates, I don't think I'd vote. Trump and Biden are both unconscionably bad options to me.  I think getting Trump out is a phyrric victory if it means we get Biden in. I'm going to use what little influence I can to push for real change.
You have a lot more in common with Dr. Jorgensen than Trump or Biden. You maybe just aren't aware of her positions or you think the solutions you've heard of are the only ones.
Not at all. Biden wrote the 1994 Tough on Crime bill, and claims (falsely but proudly) to have written the Patriot Act. He's a bad candidate, and Trump is obviously awful.  I'm voting for a good candidate instead of an awful one. Care to join?
Biden wrote the Tough on Crime bill that facilitates the militarization of police, and he was VP when Obama signed the NDAA that "legalized" Trump's kidnapping raids and domestic warfare.  Biden is a bad candidate. Even if none of this is true, what has he proposed to fix things?
I thought you were moving after Trump rolled up Clinton....so why do you care
You definitely didn't read it then ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  She's the only candidate who supports ending qualified immunity and demilitarizing police. Biden wrote the laws that militarized them, and we've seen what Trump does with that.
Biden either wrote or voted for all of the worst legislation we had during his 40+ years in government, and sat idly as VP while Obama expanded our unconstitutional wars, built child cages, and signed the NDAA that enables Trump's domestic terrorism. He's an awful candidate.
Dr. Jorgensen is the Libertarian nominee, not a write in. She's got ballot access in enough states to win- all states if courts will stop requiring petitioning during a pandemic.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. They're both awful candidates, I'm voting for a good one.
Trump voters got us Trump, not Stein voters.  If Dr. Jorgensen gets enough votes, she will win the election. Will you help or not? Blaming people for voting for good candidates is not the way we improve things.
This election is too important for Biden &amp; Trump to be running. Maybe they can try again in 2028 after Dr. Jorgensen scales the federal government back to its constitutionally enumerated powers so who gets elected can't hurt anyone so much.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.

Trump isn‚Äôt a legislator. It‚Äôs not his job to propose solutions. That‚Äôs Congress.   And the GOP did introduce a police reform bill. The Dems blocked it.
This is the problem with a lot of the anti-Trump takes I see.   They blame all of this suffering on Trump alone, as if there are not systemic problems that allowed him to come to power and that will remain in place unless we make structural changes in this country.

They shouldn't, but Obama signed an NDAA that ignores the rights of "terrorists" and Trump renewed it. Now the government "can" detain indefinitely whomever the government says is a terrorist. Very problematic. We need a court challenge.

I was a fiscal-responsibility, limited-government Republican until the 2015 debates where Trump &amp; others preached socialism &amp; anti-vax conspiracies.  It's time for reality in politics. Electing  is the way.Leadership matters. Trump‚Äôs moral bankruptcy has been a corrupting influence all the way down the ranks of the GOP. If you‚Äôre someone who values principles, unity, compassion, and character, know that in Utah you have another option: the  #utpol
We have trump because the Republican party has been eroding for 30 years, until their offering of a candidate in 2016 was a corrupt, racist, lying, sociopth. And Fox news is the garbage barge of lies that floated him in. #CorruptGOP
I will absolutely shed a tear for Herman Cain when Trump does.
Your right in that I'm a Anti-Trump Republican.  It's amazing to me that appearantly to be Pro-Trump you almost have to be Anti-Fauci/Anti-Science.  In any case, we are all people. I wish you well. We will both Iive with the results on the election.
Dr. Fauci is the best and most respected communicable disease expert in the United States. I can understand why Trump followers who dislike him. Trump followers tend to be anti-science.
Because trump created the virus ad cancer....lol
Trump is wanting to delay the election, what do you think? #utpol #Utah
BREAKING - Utah Rep Chris Stewart goes against Trump for the 1st time.
John Lewis died of cancer.  Herman Cain died from being trump stupid.  Huge difference.
And trump has no idea that his no mask required killed Herman Cain.
Ohhh. Your an expert!!  What do you see in your ‚Äúmother‚Äù you fo t see in trump?  Amazing.
We The People Cannot Allow Trump &amp; His Corruption To Harm Our USPS!
USPS is getting help... But in exchange Mnuchin gets the "proprietary" info re: USPS's most lucrative "private" accounts... (obviously, so Trump can leverage the info to  UPS, FedEx, or highest bidder...) (BTW-I hate our mobbed-up WH).
Didn‚Äôt get me here. Nancy might not get every last thing right. But she deserves support for her troubles. She is the woman at the moment.
Do you don‚Äôt care? Or don‚Äôt know Trump is defendant in pedophile case? He is just what you fear and worry about the ‚Äúgays‚Äù being but oh ok for him?
Exactly! Because she isn‚Äôt oppressed! She isn‚Äôt a victim. So you agree then? Sorry I thought you were arguing that voting for Trump as a black person is wrong.
Do you not understand that black people who support trump or isolated from the black community? That is why she made this video. To stand up for what she believes in. Is it not ok to stand up for what you believe in anymore?
Oh so if people aren‚Äôt oppressed, it has nothing to do with trump, but if they are, it is trumps fault. Got it:
We need to do this! The movement needs some leadership. Pres. Trump needs to see the support to gone him a boost. All he sees are people heating on him. Who will stand up and lead? I don‚Äôt have enough followers.
If you‚Äôre in a swing state and you don‚Äôt put a mask on and go vote, you‚Äôre making a big mistake. It‚Äôs your kind of attitude the deep state wants. I hope you come to your senses. If you‚Äôre in a red state that you know Trump will win I‚Äôm then that‚Äôs fine...I guess.
Let me get this straight. You refuse to wear masks and are happy to spread a virus that is killing people -literally by what they are breathing in- &amp; you think YOU are the Jews in this scenario? ü§£  I assume you say heil to your fuhrer trump every night when you say your rosary.
Have you listened to the rabid trump crowd? They're more energized than ever. It is unimaginable that there are still this many morons in this country, but they are here and ready to vote for their fuhrer. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure but THEY DONT CARE.
Putin butt buddy trump
If it was, and I am a trump supporter, he should be prosecuted. I don‚Äôt think he would be so stupid. I think if it was insider, it was more likely it was someone in the know, I doubt Trump, but if he is he should be prosecuted.
With all due respect and only 98 days left to stop Trump, this is a luxury neither Americans nor anyone else in the free world can afford. Please save the same-isms for after Nov 3rd. Thnx

FB is all in for Trump- I imagine K's cabal insisted.
UK Brexit Ldrs are almost in lock-step w/Trump's failed policies... Beginning with  CambridgeAnalytica's interference &amp; cyberwar on working class voters of both countries in 2016. Wonder Why?
Trump still using Putin Talking Points in pressers after his private meetings with Putin.
Troubling actions by Trump:  - Trump puts his own postmaster over USPS, effective 7/1/2020.  -New PM does policy change that effectively says 'slo-mo mail in response to COVID-19 constdaints.' -Trump's recent tweet excludes USPS:
IMHO-  The legitimacy of ballots that Arrive by Nov 3rd or are Counted by Nov 3rd is on the table. Some think this may be the legal strategy Trump uses to remain in office...
98 days to Nov 3rd &amp; Trump ceased airing political ads in battleground state MI? Just what is he plotting that does not require traditional campaign tactics? #CheckYourVoterStatus #VOTETrumpOUT

Because his kind refuse to wear masks and then infect one another. If he's not doing it, he's surrounding himself with other people who are not doing it, and you're all passing it to everyone else. Trump's fault, but they sure protect him. Hypocrites.
This is NOT America. This is NOT who we are. This is straight out of a dictators play book. Trump!

This is why Trump has a low approval rating for his handling of the pandemic: pushing to test the injection of disinfectants and praising doctors who suggest cures from alien DNA. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Barr saying judge agreed does not mean judge agreed. Age cannot be used as a mitigating factor for sentencing. Moot point now...given Trump's pardon.

Does anyone know of Howard Stern is involved? I never see his name yet he is one of the worst Trump haters.
Trump is protecting Federal buildings in cities where the government officials are too scared to MAN UP and END these terroristic protests!
Kinda like they had the PPP loans in order to help out small businesses, but giant corporations also took that money and most refused to give it back. It's never as simple as just one single item that gets voted in. That's why Trump wants to include a payroll tax cut. /1
I‚Äôll take the card and check. I would be honored, you are freaking hilarious and have made my week!!! I look for another tweet about every 7 minutes. Because 8 is a special number in the Trump family. I want to give you all the karma I can.

Yeah and that might be true. But it shouldn‚Äôt be. I don‚Äôt let trump dictate how I treat people. I get what Andrew is saying- it would be nice to a have a president that did more unifying. But we don‚Äôt have that right now- so do what you can in your own sphere of influence!
Why does what Trump says have any effect on how you or me should treat and see POC?? I find it irrelevant. Surely there are policies that can affect different minorities  uniquely, however that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT! (And you should :))

is that  true for tRump campaign ?
1. He‚Äôs testing the ‚ÄúTrump as King‚Äù waters. 2. He is setting up a way to delegitimize the results if they take time. 3. It‚Äôs drowning out certain realities like Ghislaine Maxwell, -33% GDP and the death of Cain.

Don't worry they will certainly also be shocked and upset when Ex President Trump will comment and attack on president Joe Biden or whoever lead the nation. FOR SURE, right?
I don't think it's so much that Trump is removing troops from Germany, but WHY he is moving them out of Germany. It's not like Trump is acting out some ideology, I suspect he is doing this for personal gain.
Hard to blame him. It‚Äôs hard to be motivated to go out &amp; vote when voting is what got us Trump vs Hillary in 2016. &amp; Trump vs Biden 2020. Of course voting is important, I don‚Äôt disagree with that. But I don‚Äôt blame anyone one bit for not being motivated to vote for politicians.

There is a big diff between voting by mail/voting with an absentee ballet (which is what Trump did, because he lives in Washington, but his residency is in Florida). States are mailing out millions of vote by mail ballets. Which can be filled out fraudulently by anyone.
I called Trump out for not making an attempt to show respect to John Lewis (he could have negotiated with the family)  I am calling Obama out for his political speech at John Lewis's funeral...It was wrong, wrong, wrong.  Death should not be about politics, it is a damn shame.

Not if President Trump refuses to leave and has his only Secret Police and forces to stop it from happening.  He has been planning this since last December when he got the rest intelligence report
i trust him. trump is winning. covid-19 has a lower death rate of the flu.
Every election has taken place on schedule going back to the ratification of the Constitution.  President Trump's suggestion that this year's election be postponed can easily be read as a tacit admission that he has failed where every other President in history has succeeded.
Trump has broken the law many times in the White House.  He hasn't been held accountable yet, because establishment politicians of both major political parties are weak and lack popular support after decades of corporatism.
I'm sure trump has learned a lesson
more or less what Trump is going for is implementing Market Rate Housing. Build more expensive houses so the rich move into the more luxurious housing, middle class move into high class housing, poor move into middle class, and people in poverty move into the previous lower class
death sits squarely on the shoulders of  who knew the rally should not be held.  If it wasn‚Äôt for Donald Trump and his disregard for science Herman Cain would be alive today. Very sad.

Think of the good it could do. Someone would be like "I love Donald Trump", the Trump would retweet it, and then they could edit it to "Donald Trumps a bitch" and it'd be on his page.
Now Trump is suggesting he will postpone the election.  Which he can't do.
Trump knows he's going to lose, so he's actually advocating for *delaying the election*.
Trump always seems to be doing Putin's bidding.
If Trump thinks is will harm the German economy sadly mistaken. Germany absorbed East Germany with all of his problems and managed to make it into a the leader of the EU. Germany's going to be fine

This was from almost 3 months ago. Models predicted 1.5‚Äì2.2 million deaths *if we did nothing*. We have now surpassed 150,000 *confirmed* American deaths (with tens of thousands more not confirmed), and our case &amp; death rates continue to climb. In the US, this is Trump's virus.
I feel like coronavirus was punishment from god for electing trump and if he‚Äôs re-elected we‚Äôre doomed
Tell me, donald trump is a Christian So, according to you, we shouldn't call him a kaafir but Ahle kitaab.  Is that what you're trynna say?  Read Quran, and see on what basis of characteristics, a person is called kaafir
Absolutely he is protecting mr trump. I listened to Barr‚Äôs  speech. That speech should have been spoken by our president. Mr T, has  many many enablers who protect him every friggen day. Makes me want to vomit!!!  HOW SAD is this image for our America.
In other words, this doesn‚Äôt make them any money, it proves President Trump right and exposes Fauci and the W. H. O. for the frauds they are.

I'm the "wrong" viewed in the family. To put it forth, she voted for trump and so did the rest of my family. Simply they are going to vote for him again and I can't do anything about it cause I'm not 18 yet.
This just in: Trump says a true thing!
I really think they don't realize it. They don't look into that far, they just think its a Trump thing so they are cool with it
I really believe trump will steal this election. Barr is certainly willing to help him do that. I don‚Äôt see Biden doing anything at the moment to combat it either. In fact I don‚Äôt see Democrats doing anything! I am a lifelong Dem and am very concerned.
I did... I told all that berated me that the comment was meant for trump. I just may survive this misunderstanding.

They did the Chinatown after Trump blamed Chinese people and literally people were attacking other Americans. And yes they made mistakes. But Trump once said it starts and ends with the President.l (paraphrasing). His words. Now he has to live by them. This after two Ebola deaths

I hear you, man. I guess I just think Trump is so much worse than (almost) the most moderate Democrat out of the primaries.
I challenge you, sir, to stop licking trump's taint
I will also add this, you not voting isn‚Äôt sending a message to the DNC or the RNC. Rubio and Jeb had their chances in 2016. Voters picked Trump. Same with Biden. You‚Äôre anger should be directed at the voters, not the parties.
Trump‚Äôs America
There‚Äôs two implications with that stand:  1. That you believe Biden would be just as bad as Trump. Do you really believe that?  2. That implicitly you are okay with Trump getting a second term. Do you really believe that?
Because Trump is still worse
Every single time. I don‚Äôt care that she‚Äôs conservative and pro-life, it‚Äôs her constant attempts at ‚ÄúGotcha!‚Äù that make her unbearable. Nasty, as her dude trump would say.

Listening to Barr testify and all the Republicans sticking up for him, the entire Republican party IS corrupt and if we don't stop them in November we can kiss our asses goodbye, this is no joke, America is in deep shit under Trump and Barr!!!
Trump and Barr are screwing this country beyond belief. Wake the hell up America or face the damn shit hole this country has become but it will get MUCH worse.

Hi trump fan here this idiot doesn‚Äôt speak for usFirst:   families of departed people don‚Äôt let Trump come to funerals, let alone speak  Second: I can see that Trump‚Äôs victim-mentality is what appeals to you, but most of us already get far too much of it from him, for any more victim-mentality here on Twitter to have any appeal
Trump likes to say he‚Äôs different from previous 44 Presidents:  aside from being the only Pres to never reach 50% popularity, while other Presidents are welcome at funerals, asked to speak, and get standing ovations, he‚Äôs the only one, whom one family after the next, have barred.
Raping the US Treasury for personal gain is certainly something I don‚Äôt think anybody else could have done. And Trump couldn‚Äôt have done it either without his enablers, McConnell, Barr, et. al.
Trump says this will be the most rigged election in history.  I hope he‚Äôs proven wrong, but given that he (and probably his financier, Putin, and voting-machine company owner daughter) is the one attempting the rigging, this is the closest he‚Äôs ever come to telling the truth.

I don‚Äôt like Trump.  With that understood, please seek professional psychological help.  I mean that sincerely.

It‚Äôs been clear for years, that Jordan thinks rudeness is persuasive, and with MAGA, he‚Äôs probably right.     Trump has modeled that ‚Äústrength‚Äù is rudeness, jumping to conclusions, refusing to acknowledge those conclusions were wrong, evasiveness, yelling, lying, and bragging.
Obama/BIDEN had 7 years to replace the masks. Why didn't they? Trump has replaced the masks where Obama/Biden didn't. See the difference?
Trump should vacation there.
Not true. Trump got millions fed by getting ALL TIME RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT. As a direct result children were fed, kids were schooled, homes were purchased, less food needed in food banks due to jobs, etc.
If victim-mentality can come to be considered a political ideology (and maybe it can), it is the most damaging ideology to be championed in the USA since 1776  Trump‚Äôs endless ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre out to get me‚Äù creates a ALTERNATE REALITY in his supporters, so they facilitate his $ skimming
Repub‚Äôs LACK of ideology is becoming clear  They‚Äôve got praising Trump and re-interpreting insane/moronic statements to make them sound normal, and a few racist dog-whistles.  ‚ÄòLaw &amp; order‚Äô is a less effective message, when the majority recognize it‚Äôs the messenger damaging order
So basically your saying that doctors only lie to all Americans and trump is your righteousness and you worship a man that think he knows everything but clearly knows nothing but drinking bleach
This just in: Donald Trump believes something. You can take that baby TO THE BANK!

At least in China, the ‚Äúlaw &amp; order‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem as much like provoked-chaos, so Feds can quell it.....all orchestrated to reassure Trump‚Äôs base that he ‚Äòdominates‚Äô.
Well said.    We‚Äôve lost our standing in so many foreign relationships.... stupidly sacrificed for what?    Our allies have justifiably stopped trusting us; our adversaries easily manipulate Trump‚Äôs ego.    Friendships built for centuries, who came to our aid in wars, are damaged
I‚Äôve never lived in a time where the top candidates didn‚Äôt debate each other on a national platform. we have yet to see Trump debate Biden. Hmmm I wonder why that is... ü§î
The ONLY people with DECENCY willing to associate with Trump are ones who ‚Äòhold their nose‚Äô and stay as quiet as possible about him, to maintain essential positions of responsibility, to try to limit Trump‚Äôs damage to the country.

Obama/Biden left a 100 million mask deficit in the strategic national stockpile, according to the LATimes. Trump more than replaced them and got enough ventilators in record time. Was the LATimes lying?

I remember who his Father was. His Father would br disappointed in him. I guess you haven't heard about Romney's dirty deeds.  That's why he's marching.  Anything to take Trump down before Trump reveals it all.
Your leaders will also continually fall back on a dated statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics. The AAP had to revise their statement to say that only "health concerns should dictate when schools reopen." Also, the AAP is not the CDC. #uted
Do Trump supporters know that if THEY wore masks, the economy would get a $1T boost and might actually give him a fighting chance.   They are owning the libs by giving an election to the libs.Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.
Trump is NOT well:
Every day is a long year until Trump is removed from the White House.
Making America "Great" Again  Trump is so familiar with bankruptcies that he thinks that's the barometer of success.
That is the reason why there is a federal government.  The Clean Water Act is a federal law enforced by EPA, states, and municipalities.  Is it too difficult for President Trump to sign and executive order and mandate best practices to stop the spread of a deadly virus?

155,000 dead. Shockingly sad. Massive, massive failure by the Trump administration and we're all paying the price.
I don't think Trump would want to delegitamize a loss for anything more than pride unless he truly believed it wasn't legitimate. Of course there's the risk of this talking himself into believing that a legitimate election isn't.
Technically, yes... but Herman Cain signed the Trump release of liability form sooooo... technically it is a suicide.
Obama cared about the nation and our democracy. Trump does not.
The fact that it great to see Bush and Obama again and, personally, not so much to see Bill Clinton (Epstein files) helped me to realize that I don‚Äôt like Trump because of his political afilitiation but because Trump is the most corrupt incompetent Presidential in history.
I don‚Äôt get it. Why are they afraid to say no to Trump?  Let say there is a serial killer or rapist around the neighborhood. Would you let your children go outside to play?  Opening schools without testing children first is simply a nationwide mass murder.
He did turn out good administrator. One of very few Trump appointees that did. Yeah he didn‚Äôt have NASA experience but he made the decision to go all in and learn each dept and mission. He listened to the experts, asked their advice, and go to bat for them to higher up.
Donald Trump held a crowded rally during a pandemic and flouted safety protocols, which resulted in Cain and many others getting infected and dying.  When you're done mourning, let's talk about the implications of this decision and how it parallels his broader pandemic strategy.
Yes, I am voting   And if trump challenges my vote use the many tweets I have said this in as confirmation.
"They're better than Trump" is the lowest bar you could clear, and I would say that all three of them only just barely clear it; if we're going just off of body count none of them do. Orange man is indeed bad, but doesn't make everyone who isn't orange man good by default.
Any comment on trump suggesting to delay the election? Of course not
Trump thinks it‚Äôs fine we go back to school, work, and normal activities but to dangerous to vote and delay election. Must have got that idea from his boss Putin?

There probably isn't any because its all a backroom process with select individuals. And all the people who would investigate report on it hate Trump and so why would they do that.
Over-priced, same-named cabinets isn't evidence for leftists, but feelings are. It's worth boycotting Domino's to them over some random rep commenting on a Trump admin's tweet abt pizza 5 years ago, but not this. That's what's wrong with leftism.
If Trump loses we have much bigger problems than him not accepting it.
I agree.  Our lives depend on Trump losing the election on November.  Trump‚Äôs freedom depends on winning the election on November.
Name one way Trump is trying to manipulate election day?
Trump is an ignorant crook.  Trump uses his lawyers to create legal distractions and intimidate people.  This agonizing, chaotic, and deadly administration must end on November 2020.  No more. Never again!
I've seen just as many videos like these of democrats supporting Trump. You'll find what you want to find.  Trump actually upholds Republican standards more than the last 2 Republican presidents. Just cause hes kind of a jerk in public doesnt make him a bad president.
Trump and El Chapo have one thing in common: they both use people and disposed them like they were toilet paper.  They have both killed innocent people and show no remorse for the pain and destruction they left behind.
Every time Trump calls out Mail-In Voting, remember that Trump uses Mail-In Voting. He doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a fraud, he‚Äôs worried about his chances against it.
And then backtracked and then deleted his back tracking. Apparently he thinks only Utah works and all the other states present a danger to Trump and the election needs to be postponed.
Right Libertarianism has totally been corrupted by religious fascists. It‚Äôs sad, the ‚Äúsmall government‚Äù conservatives will always occupy a tender place in my heart, their message and platform used to mean something. Tea-Party weaponized those ideas and Trump flatlined them
That's what I would say. What I've seen so far have been efforts to disallow new applications and advanced parole, but there might be other changes I haven't seen. What I do know is that if someone's DACA status expires, it will be very hard to regain DACA status under Trump.
John Lewis will always be remembered for his life defining act of blowing-off President Trump's inauguration in a fit of partisan pique over losing the 2016 election, which completely washed away everything else accomplished in his previous life. Sad.

I like this. It gives me hope. But just because the Constitution would mandate "President Pelosi" doesn't mean the fight would end, right? What happens if Trump's justice department says something different?
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail
Just remember, the election is run by states, not by the Federal government. States are sovereign. Trump has no authority over the election. States alone do. We don't have a national election, we have 50 state elections for federal office. Get ready for epic wrench throwing.
Suddenly, just like that, Democrats renounce their justification for delaying the November election as an alternative to mail-in voting fraud. Trump is certainly a  master of pushing their buttons.
Herman Cain just died from Trump Rally complications.
Why haven't you condemned Trump's election tweet yet?
He‚Äôs been laying the groundwork to blame loss on fraud for a while. Perhaps knowing Congress won‚Äôt allow this, he is prepping the excuse to drop from the race by claiming it wouldn‚Äôt have been a fair fight. In any case, straight from the #DictatorPlaybook
CONDEMN TRUMP'S ELECTION TWEET, PLEASE.
Remember back in March, when people were saying Trump could theoretically use COVID to preempt the election, and we all laughed at them for being conspiracy nuts?

Not much good news for tRump.  Biden vs. Trump 2020: Live Updates
Well that 20th of January also applies in this situation aswell. If trump refuses to step down his term ends the 20th of January. So on that day, the army, secret service, etc. Will serve the new president and will ignore Trump, so he wont have control over them anymore.
Somehow the American version of "Keep Calm and Carry On" isn't working.
But still Trump gets removed from office, that's all good for me. And when they have the election I could vote for someone besides Biden.
If trump does removed via this, the Republicans dont have a second candidate they'll have to scramble for one. So it will be Biden vs whoever's running.
Do it Trump, delay it till February!! I'll be happy seeing you getting dragged out of the White House because you didnt have the election before January 20th.
I just checked to see of  had anything to say about the Kremlin approving of Trump's move to remove our troops from Germany.  Suprising nobody, he hasn't said anything.  If he does say something I am sure it will be Susan Collins level disappointment.
I‚Äôd like to throw a whole cobbler at Trump.
I realized how low I had sunk when I was telling my husband I would sell my soul to have Bush rather trump right now.
Karma is a Trump.

Trump is a narcissistic politician bully who does not cate about anybody except himself.  He has access to an infinite number of resources to protect him from getting infected with the COVID 19 virus... 99.9% of Americans do NOT such a blessing.

The coronavirus didn't care that you lied about it for 5 months either. The coronavirus didn't care that you encouraged people to not wear masks. It won't be stopped by a new FBI building that benefits only Trump. It won't be stopped by DoD pork. Do it right, sir.
tRump is going to give Afghanistan to the Taliban.  Trump Did Not Ask Putin About Russia's Bounties on U.S. Troops
Mail in ballots start about 3 weeks before election Day here. They have to be received before midnight election Day.  It's simple really. The voter is responsible for having the vote in on time. tRump is arguing that people will steal ballots from his supporters and vote Biden.
Here's a question. If it's ANTIFA and #BLM doing all the burning and looting, why are they not burning and looting tRump properties? ü§î Maybe it's time someone did? Maybe.
This is why the administration first started supporting hydroxychloroquine. After Trump touted it, Fox and others overhyped it.   It makes sense partisan would double down after already hitching to that wagon.
That was exactly the argument I got in Oregon from tRump supporters. They are very much rights and responsibility oriented people.  Except the responsibility ends at looking out for others. üò° That's a great pic btw. üòÅ‚ù§

Twitter has already taken a stance in this election. They would never do such a thing. They only enforce their ‚ÄúCommunity Guidelines‚Äù against conservatives. They are desperate for Trump to lose so they‚Äôll bend the rules against him but not CNN.
is only good for creating riots, spreading fake news, and dissing on Trump. Your ratings suck. I remember the days when I used to watch CNN, but now I can‚Äôt even go to an airport without losing my mind. Stop trying to make sure Trump doesn‚Äôt get a 2nd term, because he will.
Suuuuuure... Idaho, Texas, Florida, Utah have Republican Governors loyal Trump follower.  I wish no state, Dem or Rep, had to be part of the 1,200 Americans dying from COVID 19 daily.  Governor Cuomo showed the world how to control a pandemic and save lives.  Learn from him. ALM.
I don't hate Trump. I'm pro Trump. You reread my posts wrong.

Trump better play nice to Biden.   If Trump and his Goya beans loving family are found guilty of bank fraud, insurance fraud, and tax evasion, they may need to beg Biden for a pardon or get ready to serve time in prison.  This the MAIN for having mercenaries killing Americans now

Inherited. The economy was already going up thanks to Obama Care.  That is to say, before Obama Care 45% of Americans had insurance. After 85% had insurance and at the same rates. 90% profit increase.  tRump is a con artist doing the bait, switch, and distract con. Hustlers know
good maybe the dnc would actually learn their lesson. wait they dont care if trump loses. 2020 made it clear they wanted to defeat bernie more than trump. democrats are just anti gun republicans
tRump inherited this economy. And millions of jobs went overseas in the 80s and 90s. He said "government contractors will be required to buy products made in America not from overseas as they do now" that is job creation. Walmart and McDonald's are Americas top employers. üö´Good
That was tRump. Biden laid out his plans to bring back jobs. Starting with government contractors.  Said he has a plan to create business opportunities for POC unlocking the doors that block them.  What conference were you watching? He laid it all out.
Just a friendly that the next stimulus check you will get isn‚Äôt from Trump... it‚Äôs from the government. NOT TRUMP.... don‚Äôt associate them

Spencer, just say it. You want us all to wear masks and you did not and will not be voting for Trump. Then you will win over the hearts and minds of Democrats in Utah......oh wait, no....nothing you say will be enough. Both sides have their stake in the ground. Carry on. #UTPOL

Barr, "We did not invade The Philippines so McArthur could walk through the surf onto the beach for a photo op" No McArthur wanted that photo to look cool to improve his image. Same thing tRump does daily.
not if trump is elected
Checks Twitter, sees this, thinks "This is probably a Trump thing somehow," and of course it is.
I am afraid so.  Ignoring a pandemic.  Exposing children to a deadly virus.  Sending mercenaries to instigate violence everywhere.  Nobody talks about Trump‚Äôs income taxes or his involvement on the Epstein young girls trafficking. What happens in Mar A Lago, stays in Mar A Lago.
Well I could deal with that, as if we dont have the election before jan 20, Trump will be removed from office. It is in the constitution so he cant do anything to stop it.
Thank you President Trump!
Basically trump said it was a way to treat COVID with out any scientific evidence and because he has money or knows his cronies has money in the medicine
White House/Trump sends "Petition for Rulemaking" to the #FCC to regulate social media. FCC must review and decide if they want to make new rules or not. Given Trump has installed puppets everywhere, does anyone have any doubt what will happen here?
But mitt didn't heap praise on trump.
Trump would create any situation he needs to go to shit just to blame of Democrats. He's incapable of taking responsibility and being accountable. He especially dislikes the criticism of him is trending on Twitter.   Let's make #TrumpleThinSkin blow up.
Another member of Trump's Moron Brigade.  How Tom Cotton accidentally told an appalling truth
That‚Äôs a lie. We love her. Trump loves her. She is welcome to be here - all patriots are welcome.
A President is elected to lead and unite the nation during difficult times.  A President does not hide the truth of a deadly pandemic.  A President preaches love for each other because we are ONE nation.  Trump failed all of us, including his followers.
Because he is rich, Kanye is surrounded by people that can at least make an attempt at fulfilling his grandiose schemes.   Trump has taught us about narcissism and antisocial personality disorder, Kanye is teaching us about #bipolardisorder.
I mean is anyone surprised? Trump can't pay respects to anyone since he respects no one but himself. Pretty sure his own kids aren't respected.
In case you were wondering, Trump is a really thin-skinned cry baby. Trending topics trend because people are talking about them. That's not illegal. Just because you can't handle it doesn't make it wrong.
Every anti-mask argument is 100 percent less important when you know Uighurs are in Chinese internment camps being forced to make masks due to the new demand, but Trump's America doesn't have time to address that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Trump sends his mercenaries to BLM peaceful protests BUT he can‚Äôt send one of his mercenaries to protect the employees and the public shopping for groceries?   If Walmart was Mar A Lago, Trump would not think twice to post his mercenaries to protect his young girls merchandise.

It's really no surprise Trump's most supportive demographic is uneducated whites.
There's two Trump viruses. One is Covid-19, the other is the disease that has infected the people who still believe in him.
tRump will screw this up just like he has with the virus, impeachment, ect. He can't help himself. He's been screwing things up his whole life. It comes naturally to him.  Officials Push U.S.-China Relations Toward Point of No Return
Trump sure has no real solution to these problems, he‚Äôs just made them worst.
I need a female trump supporter to explain to me why they support trump, especially after the deragatory and degrading things he‚Äôs said about women. I don‚Äôt understand and I genuinely would like to know.
CHALLENGE: Find footage of Trump that isn't unflattering.
Don‚Äôt throw a tantrum. This is still US and the constitution still gives even the NBA commissioner the right to vote his conscience with his wallet.  Pathetic, cause if he‚Äôd supported Trump you wouldn‚Äôt have tweeted a word.

Trump sounds like someone driven by narcissism and cowardice.
Hahah don‚Äôt get me started on politicians involved in sex trafficking and relationships with sex traffickers. :) i don‚Äôt care what trump said, I don‚Äôt care what republicans did or didn‚Äôt do, all I care about right now, is raising awareness on sex trafficking. Move on if you‚Äôre
Yeah and that might be true. But it shouldn‚Äôt be. I don‚Äôt let trump dictate how I treat people. I get what Andrew is saying- it would be nice to a have a president that did more unifying. But we don‚Äôt have that right now- so do what you can in your own sphere of influence!
Why does what Trump says have any effect on how you or me should treat and see POC?? I find it irrelevant. Surely there are policies that can affect different minorities  uniquely, however that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT! (And you should :))
It would be like the last possession in The Longest Yard with Adam Sandler. Trump would be Michael Irvin.   FOUL!!!!! MY COURT, MY BALL!!!!
The recent executive orders to increase the affordability and accessibility to life-saving medication will benefit all Americans. The more we can increase transparency and accountability in #DrugPricing, the better. #Healthcare
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre wrong per say, I agree with trump on more things than you do. I think if trump loses that means the progressives sweep everything. That‚Äôs a terrifying thought. But I get voting for a 3rd party, I did it last time
1. He‚Äôs testing the ‚ÄúTrump as King‚Äù waters. 2. He is setting up a way to delegitimize the results if they take time. 3. It‚Äôs drowning out certain realities like Ghislaine Maxwell, -33% GDP and the death of Cain.

The election between Hillary and Trump and Biden and Trump is one of the stupidest things I‚Äôve ever seen.
Don't worry they will certainly also be shocked and upset when Ex President Trump will comment and attack on president Joe Biden or whoever lead the nation. FOR SURE, right?
Hard to blame him. It‚Äôs hard to be motivated to go out &amp; vote when voting is what got us Trump vs Hillary in 2016. &amp; Trump vs Biden 2020. Of course voting is important, I don‚Äôt disagree with that. But I don‚Äôt blame anyone one bit for not being motivated to vote for politicians.

All of Trump‚Äôs appointed henchmen are doing everything they can to rig the system to keep their Emperor in the throne.   How many *mysterious* natural gas leaks will happen on Election Day adjacent to polling centers in low-income areas???
Donald Trump is what is killing Americans by the tens of thousands!
There is a big diff between voting by mail/voting with an absentee ballet (which is what Trump did, because he lives in Washington, but his residency is in Florida). States are mailing out millions of vote by mail ballets. Which can be filled out fraudulently by anyone.
I called Trump out for not making an attempt to show respect to John Lewis (he could have negotiated with the family)  I am calling Obama out for his political speech at John Lewis's funeral...It was wrong, wrong, wrong.  Death should not be about politics, it is a damn shame.
There is a lot about Trump's White House people do not know, or they do know and do not want to speak on it , I have contacts in the West Wing myself and a couple cabinet members...
We know why they are obfuscating on HCQ.
Did the Marlins go to a Trump rally with no social distancing and no masks? Just a thought.
Oh, we will. And your tweet will age as badly as Trump‚Äôs.
President Obama loves our country and does not trust Donald Trump to ever do the right thing, in my honest opinion.
Opinion | I Hope This Is Not Another Lie About the Republican Party
i trust him. trump is winning. covid-19 has a lower death rate of the flu.
Every election has taken place on schedule going back to the ratification of the Constitution.  President Trump's suggestion that this year's election be postponed can easily be read as a tacit admission that he has failed where every other President in history has succeeded.
Trump has broken the law many times in the White House.  He hasn't been held accountable yet, because establishment politicians of both major political parties are weak and lack popular support after decades of corporatism.
death sits squarely on the shoulders of  who knew the rally should not be held.  If it wasn‚Äôt for Donald Trump and his disregard for science Herman Cain would be alive today. Very sad.

Now Trump is suggesting he will postpone the election.  Which he can't do.
Trump knows he's going to lose, so he's actually advocating for *delaying the election*.
Trump always seems to be doing Putin's bidding.
If Trump thinks is will harm the German economy sadly mistaken. Germany absorbed East Germany with all of his problems and managed to make it into a the leader of the EU. Germany's going to be fine
well, an ideal outcome, imo, is trial 3 is a success &amp; vaccines are put into production and distributed in December. Someone, aside Trump, is elected &amp; addresses the fucked up shit in the US, halting all actions when going into office. Science is actually used.

I'm from Utah and I love Portland. I visit there 7 times a year. I love the people and the city. Trump's little stunt is disgusting, just more of his bull shit lies. Trump is a mentally ill, double digit IQ Racist buffoon. Wake the hell up America.
The old Lindsey Graham would have stood up to trump about removing troops from Germany, the new Lindsey Graham will help build the plan for removal. He has lost his sole!
Trump ran circles around all the establishment politicians of both major political parties.  They cannot stop him from doing tremendous damage.  Maybe he is unintelligent but what excuse do they have?
willing to bet my entire life that all these fools support Trump too
No question. Trump must win or America will cease to exist.
Trump supporters are the only ones that don‚Äôt realize Trump hates and despises them. His new housing shenanigans is not for his base because they don‚Äôt live in suburbs, this is for his gang of thugs.
Any country disagreeing with trump he thinks he‚Äôs punishing like a toddler.
Biden ought to commit to establishing a task force to energetically undo every one of Trump's executive actions that can be reversed.

Who owns stock in hydroxychloroquine? trump? He will not let this go. When will everyone see that he don't care how many people die. trump has failed us. He will not face putin for killing our soldier's. THAT SHOULD BE HUGE for everyone! Vote him out!
The Russians paying large bounty for each American soldier killed. I will never let that go. Never. Calling you out Esper. Calling you out Pompeo. Calling you out Radcliff. Calling you out Trump. All of you are treasonous bastards. All of you!

1) please check the thread where I said Biden was as bad/worse than Trump. I objected to calling Trump a Literal Fascist, on analytical grounds. You have to understand your enemy to defeat it, and you don‚Äôt.   2) see above. again, you‚Äôre making a LOT of personal assumptions
Picture all the liberal freebie seeker got a dam job and Trump will still be in the white hose you need to quit smoking so much pot it‚Äôs affecting you‚Äôre reality
This was from almost 3 months ago. Models predicted 1.5‚Äì2.2 million deaths *if we did nothing*. We have now surpassed 150,000 *confirmed* American deaths (with tens of thousands more not confirmed), and our case &amp; death rates continue to climb. In the US, this is Trump's virus.
Absolutely he is protecting mr trump. I listened to Barr‚Äôs  speech. That speech should have been spoken by our president. Mr T, has  many many enablers who protect him every friggen day. Makes me want to vomit!!!  HOW SAD is this image for our America.
In other words, this doesn‚Äôt make them any money, it proves President Trump right and exposes Fauci and the W. H. O. for the frauds they are.
I'm the "wrong" viewed in the family. To put it forth, she voted for trump and so did the rest of my family. Simply they are going to vote for him again and I can't do anything about it cause I'm not 18 yet.
This just in: Trump says a true thing!
I really believe trump will steal this election. Barr is certainly willing to help him do that. I don‚Äôt see Biden doing anything at the moment to combat it either. In fact I don‚Äôt see Democrats doing anything! I am a lifelong Dem and am very concerned.
They did the Chinatown after Trump blamed Chinese people and literally people were attacking other Americans. And yes they made mistakes. But Trump once said it starts and ends with the President.l (paraphrasing). His words. Now he has to live by them. This after two Ebola deaths
It‚Äôs a private business.  Just like you can restrict me from Trump Properties.
Might as well give the money to charity. I‚Äôll wait for someone to explain the logic of this deal. A failed camera company awarded 7x market cap loan to start a new division. What a joke
Everything that trump has messed with will be addressed and then some. The KKK is a terrorist organization and will be dealt with.
Oh Trump is in the same boat! Don't worry I'm not a sheep to either party. Both candidates cannot put more than a few coherent sentences together without a teleprompter.
Trump shows us every day he‚Äôs no stable genius. Need to add something to his cognitive test: person, woman, man, camera, TV, I don‚Äôt remember
Yes, on November 3rd remember what huge liars Donald Trump and his kids are, and how ignorant they are about what constitutes freedom of speech. Vote Joe Biden! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

you and Teddy need to come up with a plan soon for the terrorist in Portland because trump has stated he is totally fed up no pun intended and is going to put out a warrant for your arrest for aiding and abetting
I think we should agree with briebart just this one time and encourage trump supporters to take their magic drug Hydroxychloroquine often!!!
Waiting for the Counterrevolution
I hear you, man. I guess I just think Trump is so much worse than (almost) the most moderate Democrat out of the primaries.
I challenge you, sir, to stop licking trump's taint
I will also add this, you not voting isn‚Äôt sending a message to the DNC or the RNC. Rubio and Jeb had their chances in 2016. Voters picked Trump. Same with Biden. You‚Äôre anger should be directed at the voters, not the parties.
Trump‚Äôs America
There‚Äôs two implications with that stand:  1. That you believe Biden would be just as bad as Trump. Do you really believe that?  2. That implicitly you are okay with Trump getting a second term. Do you really believe that?
Because Trump is still worse
Every single time. I don‚Äôt care that she‚Äôs conservative and pro-life, it‚Äôs her constant attempts at ‚ÄúGotcha!‚Äù that make her unbearable. Nasty, as her dude trump would say.

Listening to Barr testify and all the Republicans sticking up for him, the entire Republican party IS corrupt and if we don't stop them in November we can kiss our asses goodbye, this is no joke, America is in deep shit under Trump and Barr!!!
Trump and Barr are screwing this country beyond belief. Wake the hell up America or face the damn shit hole this country has become but it will get MUCH worse.

BLM- keep protesting, keep destroying property, keep getting people hurt on both sides, keep getting people killed on both sides.   You just proved the point that your side cannot be reasonable or logical.   You just proved the NEED for trump.

Fake newsers have no concern for what they spew, until it hits home, which unfortunately it rarely does.  This time it did!  Radio host mocked Trump by saying Seattle protests were peaceful, then rioters torched his apartment building
I believe that when Trump says ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù he means ‚Äúmake America white again.‚Äù He wants to take us back to the 1950‚Äôs, when white men were in charge of everything. And ‚Äúclear out the swamp‚Äù means ‚Äúclear out people who will stop my crimes.‚Äù #DictatorTrump

also the point isn‚Äôt what Trump‚Äôs political opponents did is also bad or not bad. that doesn‚Äôt justify Trump in any way. he is the President, so he should listen to the in house expert, Fauci, and maybe just let him do the talking

Moving the numbers from the CDC to the WH is a bad move for Trump.

Trump tells the G7 to put Putin back into the group.   Germany says hell no.  Trump orders 12000 troops out of Germany.  Who you think pulling the strings?
8. Remember, you don't directly remove the water to drain the swamp--you make permanent structural &amp; environmental changes &amp; the water drains itself.  So when I say Trump hasn't drained the swamp, you now know what I mean.  In fact, to a large extent, he *can't* drain the swamp.

Fair enough.  But also, what has Trump done besides talk?   (the EO was worthless grandstanding)
Exs:  -All Whites are racists -Whites aren't a distinct group  -There's no riots -The riots are Trump's fault  -It's not safe to be around people in groups, everyone must quarantine to save the grandmas -Let the aggrieved protest. They must be heard for the health of society  etc
I didn't even think it was possible that someone as inept as Trump would make it through the primaries after I watched the first debate. Boy was I wrong. I also didn't think it would wreck the country like it has. I just thought I was going to have to hold my nose for four years.

Trump really beefing with the postal service.
This Rafael thing got badly in my head. Dreamed of myself in a sort of fighter jet accompanied by Putin and trump.  Crazy!
Trump really messing with the DACA subscription, making it 1 year vs 2. Can‚Äôt live with this uncertainty.
TRUMP 2020!! LAW AND ORDER!! PROUD TRUMP SUPPORTER. Am i going to be tracked down and killed because i say i support Trump?
Would love to see it.  She will kill it. Any thought that trump will replace pence before the election?
What does BLM mean? I know it doesn't stand for black lives matter. A black man in Milwaukee shot and killed by another black man for holding a Trump 2020 sign, assassinated in broad daylight for having an opinion, How pathetic. You are not allowed an opinion unless its pro dem.
***POLL***  Which do the Democrats hate more:   Trump?  or   America?
GRU hacked DNC emails and gave them to Wikileaks. Veselnetskaya previewed them to Junior (plausible deniability) at Trump Tower before Assange dumped them. Coordinated messaging that Bernie got screwed. Barr continually acknowledges investigation is legit, until he doesn‚Äôt.
Trump &amp; the GOP are bringing segregation back. What the hell is going on? #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
You're half way there:  Democrats hate Trump More than they hate America  FTFY
Needs an adjustment:  Democrats hate Trump More than they hate America  FTFY
A quote I saw from Evan McMullin's Topline newsletter today: "As long as the disgraceful remnants of the Republican Party in Washington continue to abet Trump's abuse of power, we're unlikely to see it stop until a new administration and a new Congress are sworn in."
153,840 dead in the #USA due to the #coronavirus and counting the #CovidiotInChief says nothing.  And the tests are still not as available as #trump proclaims #LouisGohmert and #Barr = #COVIDIOTS  #DemonSperm , #witches and #Astralsex  #craycray
Every time I swipe over to see what‚Äôs trending it always has to do with people hating on Trump. If he wins.. I personally be surprised af #NobodyLikesTrump
If the DNC were able to clone Trump three times, and then decided to have all three trumps run against the one Trump on the GOP, and I had to vote for either existing Trump, or three cloned Trump's, then I would vote GOP, hypothetically speaking.
I may hate myself, but I don't hate myself enough to vote for Trump
Biden selecting Kamala will drive down the black vote. Her record as a prosecutor is too much baggage. So far Trump cannot attack Biden but he can lay in wait to attack his VP and use her negative to bring down Biden's positives. Cant take that risk.
So... is the entire world holding a conspiracy theory, spending billions, and killing their own citizens. Or is Trump just an idiot and a bastard.  One is a lot more believable üíÅüèª

Similar to the 50 stars representing the 50 states, the 3 stars probably represent their Holy Trinity: the Trump, his family and hydroxychloroquine (just kidding about the last one, they can't spell it. Not sure what the third one may be)

I believe she‚Äôs holding out just long enough so trump can‚Äôt have another justice in the court
That does explain the trump kids, minus Tiffany. Somehow she‚Äôs defied the odds.
Because to support trump is to ignore, either willingly or because of a mental deficit of some kind, any and all evidence that he is lying about everything that he says. It‚Äôs a compulsion with him to lie when the truth would serve him better. He‚Äôs sick.
Looks like #MotherNature ala #HurricaneHannah doesn't approve of the #wall  #Trump "only done to make me look bad"

Everyone should report Trump's tweet. As a former real estate agent I understand that it is unethical  to insinuate that people who make less money are criminals and shouldn't be allowed in certain neighborhoods. IMO Trump made his money off the backs of poor people.

Just to be clear I‚Äôm not a fan of the trump persona
say what u will about herman Cain but it's kinda rude that trump busted to his death :/
I thank God for you Trump every morning when I wake up  and every night before I go to sleep. We the people love you and are truly great full for all you do and have done! God bless you!!!
I appreciate how hard Trump worked on the pandemic. If the Dems, media, and the U.N. were working to solve the problem instead of prolonging it for political advantage, things would already be a lot better. Joe Biden‚Äôs rhetoric does nothing to fix anything.
I, nor the students I teach, are an expendable asset so you can try and turn around an absolutely cratered economy, caused by Trump‚Äôs ineptitude and stupidity.   #TrumpVirus
He openly mocked the virus and preventative measures. Trump needed token black people at his death cult rally and Trump killed his buddy.

I still think Trump is going to win. I live in a deep blue state and haven‚Äôt seen a single Biden sign. It‚Äôs bizarre. Anti-Trump animus didn‚Äôt work last time, I doubt it will this time.
I was not a Herman Cain fan but I am sorry he suffered through an avoidable death.  A death that I feel some responsibility lies at the feet of Trump.  He has blood on his hands.
Trump supporter here... the comments from Dems are more scathing than the Republicans, it‚Äôs hilarious
I don't have the full quote but perhaps you should look up Nancy Pelosi telling people to "come on down to Chinatown, everything is fine here" one MONTH after Trump shut down international  flights. IlFebruary 25th to be exact. So maybe we should put some blame on her too???
The only way people will listen is if we turn out and VOTE and give President Trump a resounding and record breaking win to include winning the "popular" vote. Vote as if your life is on the line... Because it is! God bless America!
Or the Stewart-Trump Voting Report Card:
"However Chris Stewart...said that while he did not support delaying the election, Mr Trump had a legitimate point about postal voting being hard to monitor.‚Äù
Even when he disagrees with Trump, it‚Äôs qualified. Here's Stewart in a BBC article today, calling into question mail-in balloting, sans evidence:
We must not lose sight of the 150,000+ dead Americans -- mothers, brothers, fathers, daughters, grandparents -- lost to administrative incompetence and denial of science. We must not allow Trump to distract us from the deaths or from the economic disaster that is his true focus.
Chris Stewart &amp; other GOP collaborators brought our country to the point where we have to actually remind would-be Tyrant Trump that he cannot delay elections. I will not congratulate my opponent for posting an easy tweet after being complicit for so long.
The President's impeachment defense lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, who was close friends with the President's close friend, Jeffry Epstein, is caught up in an allegation of sex trafficking with Trump's other buddies Ghislaine Maxwell &amp; Prince Andrew.
There are rules against dressing like a slob at a place of business? That‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs America for you.

#TrumpDisaster.  Pandemic isn't enough.  Trump attacks USPS.
I agree with you on being anti-Trump and it being a distraction. I differ about saving the Senate. Trumpism is very different than Republicanism and a cleansing of the filth is needed.  Living with D-rule for 4 years is the price to pay for allowing Trump to destroy the party.
Know what makes me laugh about all of these trump nut gobblers? They say when the players kneel it disrespects their flag.   But isn‚Äôt changing the colors on the flag to black blue disrespectful, too? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
‚ÄúSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said "The election will be held on the date set by Congress, the historic date." He also challenged Trump's claims of potential fraud, saying: "With regards to mail-in voting ‚Äî in my state, we've had it for some time. It works extremely well."
WAY TOO MANY of these people... he‚Äôs promoting a business, the GDP, the...the...the...WAKE UP YOU SHEEP!!!! I promise everyone this, that by the November election, you will have heard all that you could never want to hear about ‚Äúpizza‚Äù! Trump is 20 moves ahead of all of you!!!
And ... ‚ÄúTeleTracking's ties to Trump Organization financiers‚Äù
Conferates considered other people as property, and profited from that ownership.
I can agree with you that there is a political agenda when it comes to race. That being said, the math doesn't lie. The numbers show that there is an issue of police brutality against people of color. Regardless if you hate Pelosi and love Trump or vice versa. We can agree that
Trump only represents his own values.
Yea, we'll pay it about the same time we pay for Trump's $TB tax cuts for the rich and corporations. Your bill is $17,392. Would you like to pay by check or credit card? Oh, you want to pass it on to your grandchildren. Got it, fool.
They‚Äôre making the point that THEIR LIVES MATTER TOO. Why is that so difficult?
We are less than 100 days from the election, and the Trump campaign has spent $1 billion on advertising.   Here's a hint. The problem isn't the message...
I am a teacher in Utah and according to  and the new Utah state standards for safety, my school and classroom will be more dangerous than an anti-mask protest or a Trump rally. I teach 7 year olds, are we really willing to put them in this much danger? #uted #utpol

Oh, let them just eat cake.
I gave Sen Mike Lee a day to respond to Trump‚Äôs suggestion that the 2020 election be postponed. I can only assume the Constitutional Scholar‚Äôs head is so far up Trump‚Äôs ass no one can hear him object.
I think the difference is that Biden seems to understand what Trump will do to stay in power. Hillary was right about Trump the person. Biden seems to understand Trump's actions and motives on a completely different level, IMO.
Ah, so black lives DON‚ÄôT matter?

Sen. Mitt Romney continued to hammer on President Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy, saying it helps China and Russia but offends U.S. allies.

I‚Äôd be very surprised if he took a stand. He‚Äôs refused to take one on masks and such, so I doubt he‚Äôd speak out against Trump. I would love to be wrong on this.
Having ballots postmarked by election day is fine and you don‚Äôt run the risk of disqualifying votes because the postal service was slow.   Trump actually made that point when he retweeted this video the other day.   #utpol

No. President Trump can‚Äôt delay the election and it‚Äôs a stupid idea. Mail-in voting is a good thing.  But here‚Äôs something I learned this week: Most states (31) require mailed ballots to be RECEIVED by Election Day. That‚Äôs stupid. #utpol
No, the argument isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs illegal for Trump to delay the election. It‚Äôs that he doesn‚Äôt have the power. The people who run elections in each state don‚Äôt work for him, unlike the DHS agents invading Portland or separating kids.
I gave up on Trump in mid-March. It's up to the rest of us to save our country.  VOTE BIDEN

Trump only pushed that scenario after he saw our U.S. GDP drop almost -32.9 percent due to Covid.
This is not how it is suppose to be done. Trump‚Äôs America is a disaster

In other words, Trump can do what he wants till it affects Stewart's reelection.
This is part of the con going on. Trump is crazy, but it doesnt seem to matter. Republicans get to come out against something he was never going to do, sell themselves as reasonable, to get what they really want-limiting options for people to vote.
Ya know that 'doc' graduated from  Trump University!!!!!
Totally agree. I should've put /s on it or something. We must vote, and we must vote Trump out of office. Failure to do so and, I believe, the "American Experiment" is over. The thing is, Trump doesn't kid. He intends to delay the election, indefinitely if he can. It's fightening
#BunkerBoy Trump makes it sound like mail-in ballots are just sent out to everybody. They only go out to REGISTERED VOTERS, dude! It's the same process as voting absentee. #IdiotInChief #WeWillVote
I live in Bluffdale (south of SLC-but luckily still in Salt Lake County), Utah and have been voting by mail for years! Trump is, of course, full of üí©.

Trump: "Young people are almost immune to this disease." He's an absolute moron.
That's the entire point of not bailing out the USPS with any COVID relief.  The GOP has been trying to shut it down so it can be privatized for over a decade, and Trump's crusade against mail-in voting is just what they need to finally destroy it.
Are you saying you side with Barr and Trump?
Maybe you should focus on stopping the trump virus in your own country and stop whining.
If trump thought it would help him win he would write us all a 1 million dollar check His only goal in life is to make more money and help his buddy Putin because Putin will help him make more money
If Trump has the police and military on his side (which he basically does) he can do whatever he wants.
Mail in voting, smart people know it, stupid people don‚Äôt know it!! trump, your the stupid one!!
Dad said: never miss a chance to watch Trump make a huge asshole of himself..

UT Rep Chris Stewart supporting Trump's concerns about vote-by-mail, saying that while it works in Utah, it won't scale on a national level. MOTHERFUCKER SCALABILITY IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFITS OF VOTE-BY-MAIL.  But of course, he knows this. He's a liar and a spineless coward.

Funny, Utah (a VERY conservative state) has been doing mail in ballots for over a decade. Are you saying that our election results in Utah are not accurate?  Great!  Utah went for Trump - so perhaps he didn't really win!
Allow ME to translate THIS for everyone: ‚ÄúOrange Man Bad! I HOPE Democrats use mail-in ballots to steal the elections, so Trump will be our of there!‚Äù
Also I haven't slept through the night in over a year and I'm starting to lose it a lil from that. Then Trump does this shit &amp; says, hey, you guys would be OK with a dictatorship, right? And every politician isn't screaming from the rooftop. A bug bit on the inside of my pinkyüò≠

Trump is probably happy contact tracing is practically nonexistent, because linking Herman Cain's contraction of COVID-19 and subsequent death to the Tulsa rally would be a real "shoot someone on 5th Ave" moment.

Don't treat this as a joke. It's easy to think Trump is just trying to create publicity (good or bad). We can't idly even pretend to entertain this kind of idea.
BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
To clarify, a Trump 3rd term/monarchy is an acceptable alternative? I am pitching a fit to my representatives right now and will resist within the system until election day is cancelled, but I'm pretty sure it's gonna go loud  at that point regardless of our actions on Facebook.
Laura, I won't say anything about what I think of you except this, all of the false information spread by you,  fellow ‚ÄùJournalists‚Äù &amp; Trump along with his sycophants about Covid-19 has cost lives on both sides. Start telling the reality of CV-19, it kills impartial of Politics.
Easy. STEP ONE: Trump supporters and GOP voters STAY HOME and refuse to participate in this SHAM of an election. STEP TWO: DRAIN THE SWAMP. STEP THREE: MAGA
God, let‚Äôs hope night, Trump might come back to life in the end.

I don't know about that, Marie. That would certainly explain a lot about how Donald Trump came to exist.

I am a Utah voter and I can testify that vote-by-mail is secure.  I don't always like the results, but I trust the paper &amp; the paper trail it provides. I can track my vote. Don't let Trump lie to you.

masks are dangerous....its a political strategy against Trump....to win they are willing to cause economic collapse no matter how much suffering it will cause.....fake pandemic  #maga #americafirst
Based on the polls we probably should delay the election. Cancel, even. And just replace Trump with Biden sooner than later.
Is that the point? If they couldn't get Russia to cheat for them, they're trying other ways. If they can find money for Trump's magical wall. They can find money for the Post Office.

To all the people commenting about a parody account getting political...here's a fun fact. 70% of Trump's twitter followers are bots/russians. So in essence, 70% of his followers are parody accounts. If you dont like it, then unfollow. Fuck donald trump.
I am shocked at your disloyalty to our President! Because we aren't delaying the election, Trump supporters &amp; GOP voters should BOYCOTT this election and refuse to vote! Why give this RIGGED MAIL-IN process any legitimacy with a vote??
Trump Blows Up the Left with Election Delay Tweet
But just in April you thought Biden was 'way over the line' when he said he believed Trump would want to delay the election? Do you ever post 'mea culpas' or just move on and not acknowledge?

We all knew that it was a matter of time before a well-known Trump supporter would succumb to the virus. Even with the terrible odds that it couldn‚Äôt be, it was still a black man that died for Trump‚Äôs cause.
Many people would handle almost everything better than Trump. Pretending someone else in charge would've prevented the pandemic hitting the US (hard) is naive.  I doubt there would've been much difference in (re)action taken earlier than April.
President Obama‚Äôs eulogy for John Lewis was just what I needed today. A glimmer of hope during an awful time. As flawed as we are as a country, we still deserve better than Donald Trump. This speech is a reminder we used to have it.
Don‚Äôt agree with trump on much, but credit where it‚Äôs due. Alien dna is used in medical treatment

Absolutely Correct! Trump is a Russian-Elected-President. Russia hacked into our very unsecured computer voting system. Computer data can be manipulated without leaving evidence, but a piece of paper (mail-in ballot) cannot be hacked. With Mail-in Ballots, Russia cannot interfere
Not if President Trump refuses to leave and has his only Secret Police and forces to stop it from happening.  He has been planning this since last December when he got the rest intelligence report
Yeah, only Trump would be out stumping politically in this environment.
And Trump is saying to ‚ÄúSupport it‚Äù, so are you implying something?

So, I just got this forwarded to me. This is where we're at with some of these Cult of Trump members. There is no logical barrier that they are unwilling to to take a hatchet to in order to keep up the illusion that Trump is some genius playing 5D chess.
Not very good optics for a number of reasons, especially when America gets to contrast the Trump's rambling, stuttering tangents with Obama's oratory skills on the same day. It'll make Trump sound even dumber than usual.

Please. It's obvious to EVERYONE that Trump plans to do everything he can to remain in power if (when) he loses the election. He's not going to accept losing, and engage in the long-standing American tradition of a peaceful transition of power.
I‚Äôll admit I gotta give trump some credit. He‚Äôs the only person in my whole life who I‚Äôve had so much hate for no one else has gotten close to the amount of hate I have for him
That being said, Facebook has clearly been playing favorites with conservatives. Zuckerberg has met personally with Trump at least a couple of times, and there are right-wing propaganda outlets such as Breitbart on their Facebook News program.
He didnt defend his wife against Trump, what makes you believe he would defend the constitution.
Herman Cain was vehement about Covid being a hoax, was anti-mask, and was last seen at a Trump rally without a mask. But we have to pretend this is a somber occurrence? Fuck that.
One of Donald Trump's very first actions in office was to convene a Blue Ribbon Panel to investigate voter fraud. So, I'm also sure you remember what happened, right. A year later the committee was quietly disbanding having found almost zero voter fraud. Google it.
‚ÄòNo reason to delay‚Äô November election, Utah official says in response to Trump warning results will be ‚Äòfraudulent‚Äô
He should be charged with manslaughter for Cain and every other person from those stupid rallies who has died and he can't legally do anything about the date of the election. Tweeting is not the job and trump is a ridiculous ignorant fool.
They'd have to open each ballot, then the postal worker would have. To alter them. They couldn't just throw away trump ballots as the number totals would clearly reflect lost votes. So every employee would have to be in on this conspiracy. It's insane.Trump is NOT well:

I don't think Trump would want to delegitamize a loss for anything more than pride unless he truly believed it wasn't legitimate. Of course there's the risk of this talking himself into believing that a legitimate election isn't.
Technically, yes... but Herman Cain signed the Trump release of liability form sooooo... technically it is a suicide.
Obama cared about the nation and our democracy. Trump does not.
The fact that it great to see Bush and Obama again and, personally, not so much to see Bill Clinton (Epstein files) helped me to realize that I don‚Äôt like Trump because of his political afilitiation but because Trump is the most corrupt incompetent Presidential in history.
I don‚Äôt get it. Why are they afraid to say no to Trump?  Let say there is a serial killer or rapist around the neighborhood. Would you let your children go outside to play?  Opening schools without testing children first is simply a nationwide mass murder.
He did turn out good administrator. One of very few Trump appointees that did. Yeah he didn‚Äôt have NASA experience but he made the decision to go all in and learn each dept and mission. He listened to the experts, asked their advice, and go to bat for them to higher up.
Donald Trump held a crowded rally during a pandemic and flouted safety protocols, which resulted in Cain and many others getting infected and dying.  When you're done mourning, let's talk about the implications of this decision and how it parallels his broader pandemic strategy.
Yes, I am voting   And if trump challenges my vote use the many tweets I have said this in as confirmation.
"They're better than Trump" is the lowest bar you could clear, and I would say that all three of them only just barely clear it; if we're going just off of body count none of them do. Orange man is indeed bad, but doesn't make everyone who isn't orange man good by default.
Any comment on trump suggesting to delay the election? Of course not
Trump thinks it‚Äôs fine we go back to school, work, and normal activities but to dangerous to vote and delay election. Must have got that idea from his boss Putin?

Trump is an ignorant crook.  Trump uses his lawyers to create legal distractions and intimidate people.  This agonizing, chaotic, and deadly administration must end on November 2020.  No more. Never again!
I've seen just as many videos like these of democrats supporting Trump. You'll find what you want to find.  Trump actually upholds Republican standards more than the last 2 Republican presidents. Just cause hes kind of a jerk in public doesnt make him a bad president.
Trump and El Chapo have one thing in common: they both use people and disposed them like they were toilet paper.  They have both killed innocent people and show no remorse for the pain and destruction they left behind.
Every time Trump calls out Mail-In Voting, remember that Trump uses Mail-In Voting. He doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a fraud, he‚Äôs worried about his chances against it.
He's right for questioning Cox supporting Trump because he disagrees on 1 thing? And now you're throwing out opinion about a wannabe dictator. You're welcome to that.
Good hell you guys are idiots. I know what he's referring to. I support Trump but I also don't agree with this, just like Cox. We don't have to agree with EVERYTHING that a politician says and we can still support them. It's actually how 2 parties are supposed to work together
What the hell are you talking about? Of course it's an American thing. All I'm saying is the  can disagree with Trump on mail in voting but still support him as president. You're proving my point.
And then backtracked and then deleted his back tracking. Apparently he thinks only Utah works and all the other states present a danger to Trump and the election needs to be postponed.
Right Libertarianism has totally been corrupted by religious fascists. It‚Äôs sad, the ‚Äúsmall government‚Äù conservatives will always occupy a tender place in my heart, their message and platform used to mean something. Tea-Party weaponized those ideas and Trump flatlined them
That's what I would say. What I've seen so far have been efforts to disallow new applications and advanced parole, but there might be other changes I haven't seen. What I do know is that if someone's DACA status expires, it will be very hard to regain DACA status under Trump.
John Lewis will always be remembered for his life defining act of blowing-off President Trump's inauguration in a fit of partisan pique over losing the 2016 election, which completely washed away everything else accomplished in his previous life. Sad.
I like this. It gives me hope. But just because the Constitution would mandate "President Pelosi" doesn't mean the fight would end, right? What happens if Trump's justice department says something different?
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail
Just remember, the election is run by states, not by the Federal government. States are sovereign. Trump has no authority over the election. States alone do. We don't have a national election, we have 50 state elections for federal office. Get ready for epic wrench throwing.
Suddenly, just like that, Democrats renounce their justification for delaying the November election as an alternative to mail-in voting fraud. Trump is certainly a  master of pushing their buttons.
Herman Cain just died from Trump Rally complications.
Why haven't you condemned Trump's election tweet yet?
He‚Äôs been laying the groundwork to blame loss on fraud for a while. Perhaps knowing Congress won‚Äôt allow this, he is prepping the excuse to drop from the race by claiming it wouldn‚Äôt have been a fair fight. In any case, straight from the #DictatorPlaybook

Not much good news for tRump.  Biden vs. Trump 2020: Live Updates
Well that 20th of January also applies in this situation aswell. If trump refuses to step down his term ends the 20th of January. So on that day, the army, secret service, etc. Will serve the new president and will ignore Trump, so he wont have control over them anymore.
Somehow the American version of "Keep Calm and Carry On" isn't working.
But still Trump gets removed from office, that's all good for me. And when they have the election I could vote for someone besides Biden.
If trump does removed via this, the Republicans dont have a second candidate they'll have to scramble for one. So it will be Biden vs whoever's running.
Do it Trump, delay it till February!! I'll be happy seeing you getting dragged out of the White House because you didnt have the election before January 20th.
I just checked to see of  had anything to say about the Kremlin approving of Trump's move to remove our troops from Germany.  Suprising nobody, he hasn't said anything.  If he does say something I am sure it will be Susan Collins level disappointment.

The coronavirus didn't care that you lied about it for 5 months either. The coronavirus didn't care that you encouraged people to not wear masks. It won't be stopped by a new FBI building that benefits only Trump. It won't be stopped by DoD pork. Do it right, sir.
tRump is going to give Afghanistan to the Taliban.  Trump Did Not Ask Putin About Russia's Bounties on U.S. Troops
Mail in ballots start about 3 weeks before election Day here. They have to be received before midnight election Day.  It's simple really. The voter is responsible for having the vote in on time. tRump is arguing that people will steal ballots from his supporters and vote Biden.
Here's a question. If it's ANTIFA and #BLM doing all the burning and looting, why are they not burning and looting tRump properties? ü§î Maybe it's time someone did? Maybe.
This is why the administration first started supporting hydroxychloroquine. After Trump touted it, Fox and others overhyped it.   It makes sense partisan would double down after already hitching to that wagon.
That was exactly the argument I got in Oregon from tRump supporters. They are very much rights and responsibility oriented people.  Except the responsibility ends at looking out for others. üò° That's a great pic btw. üòÅ‚ù§
I think it‚Äôs funny how conservatives love to scream ‚Äúfacts don‚Äôt care about your feelings‚Äù and yet they support trump?? Like y‚Äôall hate facts tf are you talking about lol
trump: i want to do this us supreme court: you can‚Äôt do that trump: i‚Äôm gonna do it anyway . . . . andrew jackson really is trump‚Äôs favorite president, huh.
In other words don‚Äôt follow example of Trump and republicans in US on reopening?
trump said no need to get the smell of poor on you i am ok with people being homeless
TRUMP2020  Build Back Better?  Sounds like he is trying to copy Trump.  Biden is a disgrace to America!
If you hate trump so much why waste your time looking at his twitter feed?
Twitter has already taken a stance in this election. They would never do such a thing. They only enforce their ‚ÄúCommunity Guidelines‚Äù against conservatives. They are desperate for Trump to lose so they‚Äôll bend the rules against him but not CNN.
is only good for creating riots, spreading fake news, and dissing on Trump. Your ratings suck. I remember the days when I used to watch CNN, but now I can‚Äôt even go to an airport without losing my mind. Stop trying to make sure Trump doesn‚Äôt get a 2nd term, because he will.
Suuuuuure... Idaho, Texas, Florida, Utah have Republican Governors loyal Trump follower.  I wish no state, Dem or Rep, had to be part of the 1,200 Americans dying from COVID 19 daily.  Governor Cuomo showed the world how to control a pandemic and save lives.  Learn from him. ALM.
I don't hate Trump. I'm pro Trump. You reread my posts wrong.
Excellent,  the truth will be the end of tRump, that's KARMA taking abig ole bite out of his ass       ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
‚ÄúBuuuhu... mami, dadi... nobody likes me! Vlady doesn‚Äôt talk to me anymore!  Trump mocked John Mc Cain for getting captured and tortured!  Trump order to block John Mc Cain‚Äôs from a Navy ship!   Trump soiled John Mc Cain‚Äôs after he passes away and he wonders why we hate him?
Trump better play nice to Biden.   If Trump and his Goya beans loving family are found guilty of bank fraud, insurance fraud, and tax evasion, they may need to beg Biden for a pardon or get ready to serve time in prison.  This the MAIN for having mercenaries killing Americans now
Do you have trouble keeping track of all the ways Trump has fumbled relations with China? or what twists and turns the Michael Flynn case has taken? or the threats we've received from North Korea?
Trump questions how Fauci has a high approval rating 'but nobody likes me' It's a no brainier Trump, Fauci has earned our respect üëç You on the other hand...have innocent American's blood on your hands!  Don't worry though, It's all a Democratic Hoax üò°

Inherited. The economy was already going up thanks to Obama Care.  That is to say, before Obama Care 45% of Americans had insurance. After 85% had insurance and at the same rates. 90% profit increase.  tRump is a con artist doing the bait, switch, and distract con. Hustlers know
good maybe the dnc would actually learn their lesson. wait they dont care if trump loses. 2020 made it clear they wanted to defeat bernie more than trump. democrats are just anti gun republicans
tRump inherited this economy. And millions of jobs went overseas in the 80s and 90s. He said "government contractors will be required to buy products made in America not from overseas as they do now" that is job creation. Walmart and McDonald's are Americas top employers. üö´Good
That was tRump. Biden laid out his plans to bring back jobs. Starting with government contractors.  Said he has a plan to create business opportunities for POC unlocking the doors that block them.  What conference were you watching? He laid it all out.
Just a friendly that the next stimulus check you will get isn‚Äôt from Trump... it‚Äôs from the government. NOT TRUMP.... don‚Äôt associate them
Guess I did since tRump is an alien and his DNA is all over the place.
Rush, the one playing death is going to get an Oscar for getting buried after getting shot by one of Trump‚Äôs mercenaries.  There is a special place in hell for individuals like Rush Limbaugh.

By the way, your face looks like President Trump's but in a microwave. I hope all is well.
Trump keeps digging up new conspiracy theories and hoaxes about the pandemic. He won't listen to the scientists because they won't tell him what he wants to hear. He wants a quick and easy cure. A panacea. He wants it to be an attack on him personally. He is responsible for death
Spencer, just say it. You want us all to wear masks and you did not and will not be voting for Trump. Then you will win over the hearts and minds of Democrats in Utah......oh wait, no....nothing you say will be enough. Both sides have their stake in the ground. Carry on. #UTPOL
Because the only person who can fire him or censure is tRump.
"Shame on you, Mr. Barr!" - Nadler Accuses Barr of Sending Federal Officers to Portland to Get Footage For Trump Campaign Ads - Then Wouldn't Let Barr Respond! (VIDEO)
I do not blame him. I don‚Äôt read Trump‚Äôs tweets either.
If you're in the media and you promote the idea that Trump has somehow turned a corner and is being responsible and a leader now... you should be stripped of your journalistic credentials and degree. He can't. Incapable of doing that. Requires selflessness.
Barr, "We did not invade The Philippines so McArthur could walk through the surf onto the beach for a photo op" No McArthur wanted that photo to look cool to improve his image. Same thing tRump does daily.
not if trump is elected
Checks Twitter, sees this, thinks "This is probably a Trump thing somehow," and of course it is.
I am afraid so.  Ignoring a pandemic.  Exposing children to a deadly virus.  Sending mercenaries to instigate violence everywhere.  Nobody talks about Trump‚Äôs income taxes or his involvement on the Epstein young girls trafficking. What happens in Mar A Lago, stays in Mar A Lago.
Well I could deal with that, as if we dont have the election before jan 20, Trump will be removed from office. It is in the constitution so he cant do anything to stop it.
Thank you President Trump!
White House/Trump sends "Petition for Rulemaking" to the #FCC to regulate social media. FCC must review and decide if they want to make new rules or not. Given Trump has installed puppets everywhere, does anyone have any doubt what will happen here?
But mitt didn't heap praise on trump.
Trump would create any situation he needs to go to shit just to blame of Democrats. He's incapable of taking responsibility and being accountable. He especially dislikes the criticism of him is trending on Twitter.   Let's make #TrumpleThinSkin blow up.
Another member of Trump's Moron Brigade.  How Tom Cotton accidentally told an appalling truth
That‚Äôs a lie. We love her. Trump loves her. She is welcome to be here - all patriots are welcome.
A President is elected to lead and unite the nation during difficult times.  A President does not hide the truth of a deadly pandemic.  A President preaches love for each other because we are ONE nation.  Trump failed all of us, including his followers.
Because he is rich, Kanye is surrounded by people that can at least make an attempt at fulfilling his grandiose schemes.   Trump has taught us about narcissism and antisocial personality disorder, Kanye is teaching us about #bipolardisorder.
I mean is anyone surprised? Trump can't pay respects to anyone since he respects no one but himself. Pretty sure his own kids aren't respected.
In case you were wondering, Trump is a really thin-skinned cry baby. Trending topics trend because people are talking about them. That's not illegal. Just because you can't handle it doesn't make it wrong.
Every anti-mask argument is 100 percent less important when you know Uighurs are in Chinese internment camps being forced to make masks due to the new demand, but Trump's America doesn't have time to address that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Trump sends his mercenaries to BLM peaceful protests BUT he can‚Äôt send one of his mercenaries to protect the employees and the public shopping for groceries?   If Walmart was Mar A Lago, Trump would not think twice to post his mercenaries to protect his young girls merchandise.
The fact that Trump went from ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù to ‚Äúkeep America great‚Äù and then back to ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù because everyone was miserable tells you everything you need to know about how this experiment is going

Remember that time  had a private meeting behind closed doors where Putin vaccinated Trump against the Russian bio-weapon? #PresidentKaren
America was completely prepared and ready and then the Trump Administration undermined every inteligent mitigation effort at every turn as if a Russian had threatened to kill them if they didn't.
Remember when woke people were all kinds of upset at the trump rally leaving trash behind, and now those same people are trashing entire cities and leaving all kinds of trash in the streets? That‚Äôs crazy
So "Wall of Moms" is not just a description, it's an organization capable of suing (and being sued)? Are they connected in different cities? Interesting place to start a conversation about legal organizations, trademarks, franchising, etc.

I don't know all the rules about airtime for elections, but isn't there something that says stations have to give equal time to all candidates, so if Kanye is a candidate, if a station airs an episode of Kardashians he's in do they have to give free air time to Biden and Trump?
Agreed that there's equal GOP that's been in office just as long. They all need to go which is why Trump has been preaching "drain the swamp" for 4 years. He didn't discriminate and say "drain the dems." All career politicians have been trembling since he got there.  #TermLimits

Yeah and that might be true. But it shouldn‚Äôt be. I don‚Äôt let trump dictate how I treat people. I get what Andrew is saying- it would be nice to a have a president that did more unifying. But we don‚Äôt have that right now- so do what you can in your own sphere of influence!
Why does what Trump says have any effect on how you or me should treat and see POC?? I find it irrelevant. Surely there are policies that can affect different minorities  uniquely, however that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT! (And you should :))
The recent executive orders to increase the affordability and accessibility to life-saving medication will benefit all Americans. The more we can increase transparency and accountability in #DrugPricing, the better. #Healthcare

1. He‚Äôs testing the ‚ÄúTrump as King‚Äù waters. 2. He is setting up a way to delegitimize the results if they take time. 3. It‚Äôs drowning out certain realities like Ghislaine Maxwell, -33% GDP and the death of Cain.

There is a big diff between voting by mail/voting with an absentee ballet (which is what Trump did, because he lives in Washington, but his residency is in Florida). States are mailing out millions of vote by mail ballets. Which can be filled out fraudulently by anyone.

Every election has taken place on schedule going back to the ratification of the Constitution.  President Trump's suggestion that this year's election be postponed can easily be read as a tacit admission that he has failed where every other President in history has succeeded.
Trump has broken the law many times in the White House.  He hasn't been held accountable yet, because establishment politicians of both major political parties are weak and lack popular support after decades of corporatism.
death sits squarely on the shoulders of  who knew the rally should not be held.  If it wasn‚Äôt for Donald Trump and his disregard for science Herman Cain would be alive today. Very sad.

Absolutely he is protecting mr trump. I listened to Barr‚Äôs  speech. That speech should have been spoken by our president. Mr T, has  many many enablers who protect him every friggen day. Makes me want to vomit!!!  HOW SAD is this image for our America.
In other words, this doesn‚Äôt make them any money, it proves President Trump right and exposes Fauci and the W. H. O. for the frauds they are.
This just in: Trump says a true thing!
They did the Chinatown after Trump blamed Chinese people and literally people were attacking other Americans. And yes they made mistakes. But Trump once said it starts and ends with the President.l (paraphrasing). His words. Now he has to live by them. This after two Ebola deaths
It‚Äôs a private business.  Just like you can restrict me from Trump Properties.
Might as well give the money to charity. I‚Äôll wait for someone to explain the logic of this deal. A failed camera company awarded 7x market cap loan to start a new division. What a joke
Oh Trump is in the same boat! Don't worry I'm not a sheep to either party. Both candidates cannot put more than a few coherent sentences together without a teleprompter.
Trump shows us every day he‚Äôs no stable genius. Need to add something to his cognitive test: person, woman, man, camera, TV, I don‚Äôt remember

I challenge you, sir, to stop licking trump's taint
I will also add this, you not voting isn‚Äôt sending a message to the DNC or the RNC. Rubio and Jeb had their chances in 2016. Voters picked Trump. Same with Biden. You‚Äôre anger should be directed at the voters, not the parties.
Trump‚Äôs America
There‚Äôs two implications with that stand:  1. That you believe Biden would be just as bad as Trump. Do you really believe that?  2. That implicitly you are okay with Trump getting a second term. Do you really believe that?
Because Trump is still worse
Every single time. I don‚Äôt care that she‚Äôs conservative and pro-life, it‚Äôs her constant attempts at ‚ÄúGotcha!‚Äù that make her unbearable. Nasty, as her dude trump would say.

I just hope Americans are smart enough to put a stop to Trump and Barr in November. Right now most Americans are pretty damn dumb the won't even wear a mask. I don't have much faith sadly.
Listening to Barr testify and all the Republicans sticking up for him, the entire Republican party IS corrupt and if we don't stop them in November we can kiss our asses goodbye, this is no joke, America is in deep shit under Trump and Barr!!!
Trump and Barr are screwing this country beyond belief. Wake the hell up America or face the damn shit hole this country has become but it will get MUCH worse.

Trump hasn't been awful, he's a total clown though. He doesn't make the economy go, the American people are the engine behind the economy. The two party system, and all of the party before country and divisiveness that comes from it is absolutely trash. It will be our downfall.

British Writer Pens The Best Description Of Trump I‚Äôve Read - London Daily
Do people on the left actually think President Trump created the virus and personally distributed it throughout the country?  Seems like it.  I am wondering if there is an epidemic of early-onset Alzheimer's disease that we have totally missed.
Nah, I gotta say this cuz it‚Äôs been on my mind. As soon as we start saying that ONE MAN has that kind of power, we give up our power. It‚Äôs just dangerous verbiage is all. I am not a trump supporter.. but placing blame is just too easy and, frankly, feels unamerican.

4 million cases of Covid 19 is beyond belief. It results from the corrupt Trump administration who wouldn't listen to the experts to avoid the calamity we are now experiencing. Is this the guy you want in office for another four years?
Trump's sending in the troops is without question unlawfully using force for his re-election. This buffoon of a president is dangerous and is killing our country.
Well said AOC! "Having daughters is not what makes someone a decent man. Treating people with dignity and respect is what makes a decent man." Ted Yoho is just another bozo GOP dude like Trump who is unwilling to apologize for his mistakes.

With a scant few exceptions, Republicans are scared shitless of The Base. Without them, Trump is only the loud, obnoxious drunk at the end of the bar.
Trump is certainly MAGA in the Covid 19 numbers. Congratulations 45 for making it to 4.1 million cases, 0ver 146,000 deaths and rising - Trump has lost control and we have a psychopath running our country
The negligence of this administration is appalling. Any competent President would have jumped on Covid-19 with a hair-on-fire, rapid response. Trump's attitude is so casual. "We'll just have to see what happens..."
Trump's going to lose and he knows it.
‚ÄúWatch,‚Äù Mr. Trump said, ‚Äúon Nov. 4, everything will open up.‚Äù  Looks like Trump has accepted that he's going to lose!
White House defends Trump's well-wishes for alleged sex criminal Ghislaine Maxwell
Prohibiting the counting of undocumented immigrants from the census is plain an simple unconstitutional. How often do we allow the Trump administration to break the law? Unbelievable.

Wow, we have some serious work to do with China. Trump has, for the most part, screwed things up pretty bad as this article points out.

how much does Trump pay this chump?  yeah alot of them or Mothers.  just love to spread the lies and BS don't you.  The reaspn being is that you have NOTHING.  Trump has NOTHING and he is going to lose
Maybe that is why we had so many 'feet' on the ground in China and then someone named Trump got rid of them to 'streamline'.  It doesn't excuse MONTHS of inaction by this President and blocking by Moscow MItch
except it wasn't.  Republican senate investigation, DoJ investigation.  multiple intelligent agencies.  Trump himself asking for help from the Russians.

Today it was reported the economy is at a record low of 32.9% in the 2nd qtr of 2020, the WORST mark going back to World War II and for the 2nd week in a row JOBLESS filings are UP. So Trump tweets he wants to delay the elections &amp; his conspiracy theory about mail in voting.
I don't care what Republican officials have to say about Donald Trump's latest. They are crystal clear where they stand, and they deserve his fate.
The only reason this is coming up is because Donald Trump knows hes going to lose this election.
Hey Liar Joy Reid.. He survived Stage 4 Colon Cancer. He had a Compromised immune System. It wasn't the Trump Rally. Herman Cain was a Free Man and made his choice accordingly..

9. No 1 person can do what needs to be done to drain the swamp entirely, b/c permanent systemic changes are required.  That's not to say Trump can't do anything, though. He could make some changes that could/would hopefully be made permanent later.
Trump tells the G7 to put Putin back into the group.   Germany says hell no.  Trump orders 12000 troops out of Germany.  Who you think pulling the strings?
8. Remember, you don't directly remove the water to drain the swamp--you make permanent structural &amp; environmental changes &amp; the water drains itself.  So when I say Trump hasn't drained the swamp, you now know what I mean.  In fact, to a large extent, he *can't* drain the swamp.

Exs:  -All Whites are racists -Whites aren't a distinct group  -There's no riots -The riots are Trump's fault  -It's not safe to be around people in groups, everyone must quarantine to save the grandmas -Let the aggrieved protest. They must be heard for the health of society  etc
well, an ideal outcome, imo, is trial 3 is a success &amp; vaccines are put into production and distributed in December. Someone, aside Trump, is elected &amp; addresses the fucked up shit in the US, halting all actions when going into office. Science is actually used.
I didn't even think it was possible that someone as inept as Trump would make it through the primaries after I watched the first debate. Boy was I wrong. I also didn't think it would wreck the country like it has. I just thought I was going to have to hold my nose for four years.
Pretentious Academia in rest of the world: Fight fascim, fight trump, fight Modi, but don't question our ineptness.  Humara pretentious academia: Fight twitter trolls &amp; declare us as your ultimate saviours.We are the experts &amp; you don't know shit &amp; have no right to disagree.

Trump really beefing with the postal service.
This Rafael thing got badly in my head. Dreamed of myself in a sort of fighter jet accompanied by Putin and trump.  Crazy!

Would love to see it.  She will kill it. Any thought that trump will replace pence before the election?
What does BLM mean? I know it doesn't stand for black lives matter. A black man in Milwaukee shot and killed by another black man for holding a Trump 2020 sign, assassinated in broad daylight for having an opinion, How pathetic. You are not allowed an opinion unless its pro dem.
***POLL***  Which do the Democrats hate more:   Trump?  or   America?
GRU hacked DNC emails and gave them to Wikileaks. Veselnetskaya previewed them to Junior (plausible deniability) at Trump Tower before Assange dumped them. Coordinated messaging that Bernie got screwed. Barr continually acknowledges investigation is legit, until he doesn‚Äôt.

A quote I saw from Evan McMullin's Topline newsletter today: "As long as the disgraceful remnants of the Republican Party in Washington continue to abet Trump's abuse of power, we're unlikely to see it stop until a new administration and a new Congress are sworn in."

That does explain the trump kids, minus Tiffany. Somehow she‚Äôs defied the odds.
Because to support trump is to ignore, either willingly or because of a mental deficit of some kind, any and all evidence that he is lying about everything that he says. It‚Äôs a compulsion with him to lie when the truth would serve him better. He‚Äôs sick.

Everyone should report Trump's tweet. As a former real estate agent I understand that it is unethical  to insinuate that people who make less money are criminals and shouldn't be allowed in certain neighborhoods. IMO Trump made his money off the backs of poor people.

I think if Biden stays quiet and does nothing that Trump can attack for the next 97 days, Trump will do himself in. Trump's campaign is built on creating fear, panic and attacking others which his loyal base loves. The rest of us are just watching him implode.
Jesus Christ. Trump is out of touch, confused &amp; babbling.  He is clear on one point though, his loyalty is to Putin &amp; not to American troops.
Donald Trump Jr took a meeting with Veselnetskaya at Trump Tower for the purpose of getting campaign assistance for Trump. How is this not a direct violation of 11 CFR Section 110.20(g)?
This is Donald Trump saying without hesitation that low-income families don't deserve a roof over their heads.  Absolutely despicable, psychopathic behavior from the President of the United States, but what's new?
As if we didn't already have a housing crisis in this country (including in many suburbs), the Trump administration is actively working to make the problem worse.  Vote this scumbag out of office in November.
In case it wasn't clear, Donald J. Trump aligns ideologically with urban NIMBY "progressives."  Fighting affordable housing in your neighborhood is not progressive and actively harms people who just need a place to live that's within their price range.

Can't believe that the Senate and Congress can't see what's going on here. Putin has been planning this since the Soviet Union lost the cold war. He couldn't believe his luck when he got the stooge he wanted elected Pres. Trump is turning over üá∫üá∏ to üá∑üá∫. Wake TFU!!!
Because he is working with them to overthrow our government. Anyone who doesn't see that is BLIND! He is a traitor, a liar, a cheat, and a thief...and that isn't covering all the other horrible attributes he has. Trump is a traitor and he is moving toward dictatorship, watch him.
Honest to god I don‚Äôt care if I get in trouble for the tweet but like anyone planing on killing trump anytime soon????
This might be just a ‚Äústory‚Äù. I hope it is. But the sad thing is, story or not, that it is believable at face value.  Extremist uncompassionate conservatism unfortunately has found a voice in Trump‚Äôs America. Bigly sad for our country and all of us.
It is baffling to see people willing to give up their freedoms and American ideals only for the simple reason that they can‚Äôt stand Trump‚Äôs personality!

All I can say it‚Äôs too bad he went to the rally and followed the misguided cruel leadership of trump
Yeah and that might be true. But it shouldn‚Äôt be. I don‚Äôt let trump dictate how I treat people. I get what Andrew is saying- it would be nice to a have a president that did more unifying. But we don‚Äôt have that right now- so do what you can in your own sphere of influence!
Why does what Trump says have any effect on how you or me should treat and see POC?? I find it irrelevant. Surely there are policies that can affect different minorities  uniquely, however that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT! (And you should :))
There are rules against dressing like a slob at a place of business? That‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs America for you.

Don't worry they will certainly also be shocked and upset when Ex President Trump will comment and attack on president Joe Biden or whoever lead the nation. FOR SURE, right?
I don't think it's so much that Trump is removing troops from Germany, but WHY he is moving them out of Germany. It's not like Trump is acting out some ideology, I suspect he is doing this for personal gain.

There is a big diff between voting by mail/voting with an absentee ballet (which is what Trump did, because he lives in Washington, but his residency is in Florida). States are mailing out millions of vote by mail ballets. Which can be filled out fraudulently by anyone.
This is not how it is suppose to be done. Trump‚Äôs America is a disaster

I called Trump out for not making an attempt to show respect to John Lewis (he could have negotiated with the family)  I am calling Obama out for his political speech at John Lewis's funeral...It was wrong, wrong, wrong.  Death should not be about politics, it is a damn shame.

I am in Utah, sadly my state will vote for Trump. Come on America, surprise me! Vote!
Trump‚Äôs anti science, mask culture war has needlessly killed thousands of Americans, and you‚Äôre busy clutching your pearls because somebody had the audacity to point it out?  Please.

Herman Cain was vehement about Covid being a hoax, was anti-mask, and was last seen at a Trump rally without a mask. But we have to pretend this is a somber occurrence? Fuck that.
Trump has broken the law many times in the White House.  He hasn't been held accountable yet, because establishment politicians of both major political parties are weak and lack popular support after decades of corporatism.

more or less what Trump is going for is implementing Market Rate Housing. Build more expensive houses so the rich move into the more luxurious housing, middle class move into high class housing, poor move into middle class, and people in poverty move into the previous lower class

Today it was reported the economy is at a record low of 32.9% in the 2nd qtr of 2020, the WORST mark going back to World War II and for the 2nd week in a row JOBLESS filings are UP. So Trump tweets he wants to delay the elections &amp; his conspiracy theory about mail in voting.

Trump gets things done. He has held true to most of his promises and I'd like to see what more he can accomplish. Biden is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the left's agenda. If he wins, I don't think it will be him running the show, it will be all of the extreme liberals.
The only reason this is coming up is because Donald Trump knows hes going to lose this election.

Now Trump is suggesting he will postpone the election.  Which he can't do.
Trump tells the G7 to put Putin back into the group.   Germany says hell no.  Trump orders 12000 troops out of Germany.  Who you think pulling the strings?
8. Remember, you don't directly remove the water to drain the swamp--you make permanent structural &amp; environmental changes &amp; the water drains itself.  So when I say Trump hasn't drained the swamp, you now know what I mean.  In fact, to a large extent, he *can't* drain the swamp.

If Trump thinks is will harm the German economy sadly mistaken. Germany absorbed East Germany with all of his problems and managed to make it into a the leader of the EU. Germany's going to be fine

well, an ideal outcome, imo, is trial 3 is a success &amp; vaccines are put into production and distributed in December. Someone, aside Trump, is elected &amp; addresses the fucked up shit in the US, halting all actions when going into office. Science is actually used.
I didn't even think it was possible that someone as inept as Trump would make it through the primaries after I watched the first debate. Boy was I wrong. I also didn't think it would wreck the country like it has. I just thought I was going to have to hold my nose for four years.

What does BLM mean? I know it doesn't stand for black lives matter. A black man in Milwaukee shot and killed by another black man for holding a Trump 2020 sign, assassinated in broad daylight for having an opinion, How pathetic. You are not allowed an opinion unless its pro dem.
***POLL***  Which do the Democrats hate more:   Trump?  or   America?
Trump ran circles around all the establishment politicians of both major political parties.  They cannot stop him from doing tremendous damage.  Maybe he is unintelligent but what excuse do they have?
GRU hacked DNC emails and gave them to Wikileaks. Veselnetskaya previewed them to Junior (plausible deniability) at Trump Tower before Assange dumped them. Coordinated messaging that Bernie got screwed. Barr continually acknowledges investigation is legit, until he doesn‚Äôt.

A quote I saw from Evan McMullin's Topline newsletter today: "As long as the disgraceful remnants of the Republican Party in Washington continue to abet Trump's abuse of power, we're unlikely to see it stop until a new administration and a new Congress are sworn in."

Every time I swipe over to see what‚Äôs trending it always has to do with people hating on Trump. If he wins.. I personally be surprised af #NobodyLikesTrump
No question. Trump must win or America will cease to exist.
If the DNC were able to clone Trump three times, and then decided to have all three trumps run against the one Trump on the GOP, and I had to vote for either existing Trump, or three cloned Trump's, then I would vote GOP, hypothetically speaking.
Trump supporters are the only ones that don‚Äôt realize Trump hates and despises them. His new housing shenanigans is not for his base because they don‚Äôt live in suburbs, this is for his gang of thugs.
Any country disagreeing with trump he thinks he‚Äôs punishing like a toddler.
So... is the entire world holding a conspiracy theory, spending billions, and killing their own citizens. Or is Trump just an idiot and a bastard.  One is a lot more believable üíÅüèª
Biden ought to commit to establishing a task force to energetically undo every one of Trump's executive actions that can be reversed.

I think if Biden stays quiet and does nothing that Trump can attack for the next 97 days, Trump will do himself in. Trump's campaign is built on creating fear, panic and attacking others which his loyal base loves. The rest of us are just watching him implode.
Jesus Christ. Trump is out of touch, confused &amp; babbling.  He is clear on one point though, his loyalty is to Putin &amp; not to American troops.
Donald Trump Jr took a meeting with Veselnetskaya at Trump Tower for the purpose of getting campaign assistance for Trump. How is this not a direct violation of 11 CFR Section 110.20(g)?

I appreciate how hard Trump worked on the pandemic. If the Dems, media, and the U.N. were working to solve the problem instead of prolonging it for political advantage, things would already be a lot better. Joe Biden‚Äôs rhetoric does nothing to fix anything.

I wish Congress would do more to hold them accountable.  Trump is breaking laws left and right.   I think Democrats think it will hurt their chances at the ballot box. Trump is going to use voter suppression to attempt a win. They need to fight him now.
I was not a Herman Cain fan but I am sorry he suffered through an avoidable death.  A death that I feel some responsibility lies at the feet of Trump.  He has blood on his hands.
Trump supporter here... the comments from Dems are more scathing than the Republicans, it‚Äôs hilarious
I don't have the full quote but perhaps you should look up Nancy Pelosi telling people to "come on down to Chinatown, everything is fine here" one MONTH after Trump shut down international  flights. IlFebruary 25th to be exact. So maybe we should put some blame on her too???
The only way people will listen is if we turn out and VOTE and give President Trump a resounding and record breaking win to include winning the "popular" vote. Vote as if your life is on the line... Because it is! God bless America!
I keep saying  needs to stop Trump now. We can not afford to wait.
Trump is not funding the post office.
Cain attended the Trump Tulsa Rally.
Or the Stewart-Trump Voting Report Card:
"However Chris Stewart...said that while he did not support delaying the election, Mr Trump had a legitimate point about postal voting being hard to monitor.‚Äù
Even when he disagrees with Trump, it‚Äôs qualified. Here's Stewart in a BBC article today, calling into question mail-in balloting, sans evidence:
We must not lose sight of the 150,000+ dead Americans -- mothers, brothers, fathers, daughters, grandparents -- lost to administrative incompetence and denial of science. We must not allow Trump to distract us from the deaths or from the economic disaster that is his true focus.
Chris Stewart &amp; other GOP collaborators brought our country to the point where we have to actually remind would-be Tyrant Trump that he cannot delay elections. I will not congratulate my opponent for posting an easy tweet after being complicit for so long.
The President's impeachment defense lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, who was close friends with the President's close friend, Jeffry Epstein, is caught up in an allegation of sex trafficking with Trump's other buddies Ghislaine Maxwell &amp; Prince Andrew.

#TrumpDisaster.  Pandemic isn't enough.  Trump attacks USPS.
I agree with you on being anti-Trump and it being a distraction. I differ about saving the Senate. Trumpism is very different than Republicanism and a cleansing of the filth is needed.  Living with D-rule for 4 years is the price to pay for allowing Trump to destroy the party.
‚ÄúSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said "The election will be held on the date set by Congress, the historic date." He also challenged Trump's claims of potential fraud, saying: "With regards to mail-in voting ‚Äî in my state, we've had it for some time. It works extremely well."
WAY TOO MANY of these people... he‚Äôs promoting a business, the GDP, the...the...the...WAKE UP YOU SHEEP!!!! I promise everyone this, that by the November election, you will have heard all that you could never want to hear about ‚Äúpizza‚Äù! Trump is 20 moves ahead of all of you!!!
And ... ‚ÄúTeleTracking's ties to Trump Organization financiers‚Äù
Conferates considered other people as property, and profited from that ownership.
I can agree with you that there is a political agenda when it comes to race. That being said, the math doesn't lie. The numbers show that there is an issue of police brutality against people of color. Regardless if you hate Pelosi and love Trump or vice versa. We can agree that
Trump only represents his own values.

100% Mom for Biden.  A Trump lackey speaking for parents is a bad joke - not one is fit to raise a child any more than 45 was.
I agree and that was one of the only good things about Trump in my opinion is that he put a light on this.
Biden looks great to the mainstream media consumer. I know because I recently was one   Turn the TV off though and do a little research on your own and then you realize Trump IS great ü§©

I gave Sen Mike Lee a day to respond to Trump‚Äôs suggestion that the 2020 election be postponed. I can only assume the Constitutional Scholar‚Äôs head is so far up Trump‚Äôs ass no one can hear him object.
I think the difference is that Biden seems to understand what Trump will do to stay in power. Hillary was right about Trump the person. Biden seems to understand Trump's actions and motives on a completely different level, IMO.
Trump likes to say he‚Äôs different from previous 44 Presidents:  aside from being the only Pres to never reach 50% popularity, while other Presidents are welcome at funerals, asked to speak, and get standing ovations, he‚Äôs the only one, whom one family after the next, have barred.
Ah, so black lives DON‚ÄôT matter?
Surreal, like that really is functional.
The founders admit to being Marxist, doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the organization is Marxist.

Raping the US Treasury for personal gain is certainly something I don‚Äôt think anybody else could have done. And Trump couldn‚Äôt have done it either without his enablers, McConnell, Barr, et. al.

You are the most despicable lying racist next to Trump. Your broadcast tonight was just for an ignorant base rally for his losing bid for reelection. You claim that so many agencies are after Trump is a fairy tale of lies and evil. Your chicken little rally cries are bullshit.
Oh so he's privileged because he likes Trump and disavows a Marxist group lol.  Learn how privileged any color is in this Country.
Trump says this will be the most rigged election in history.  I hope he‚Äôs proven wrong, but given that he (and probably his financier, Putin, and voting-machine company owner daughter) is the one attempting the rigging, this is the closest he‚Äôs ever come to telling the truth.

No one needs anymore Trump
Sen. Mitt Romney continued to hammer on President Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy, saying it helps China and Russia but offends U.S. allies.
Donald Trump promised he would surround himself with "the best and most serious people." This is what his version of that looks like: 15 cabinet appointees; 13 of them are white; 13 of them are men. THIS IS NOT WHAT THE UNITED STATES LOOKS LIKE.
I think the Covid cases ‚Äúplateauing‚Äù is more related to the Trump regime taking over the Covid data and it‚Äôs reporting.

I agree. The fact is that many of my ‚Äòfriends‚Äô, mostly on Facebook, remain silent about human trafficking. It‚Äôs disheartening.   I‚Äôve considered the same re: the election... worried if Trump doesn‚Äôt win (obvious reasons) and worried if he does win (civil war)  So much ugliness üòû
didn't Putin just win a lifetime presidency or some such crap?  Trump just talked to him recently. Didn't talk about bounties, but sounds like he may have talked to him about how to hijack a country. I have no doubt.

Several battleground states only count ballots that arrive by Election Day. So, delaying mail would be a form of voter suppression.

I‚Äôd be very surprised if he took a stand. He‚Äôs refused to take one on masks and such, so I doubt he‚Äôd speak out against Trump. I would love to be wrong on this.
Having ballots postmarked by election day is fine and you don‚Äôt run the risk of disqualifying votes because the postal service was slow.   Trump actually made that point when he retweeted this video the other day.   #utpol

No. President Trump can‚Äôt delay the election and it‚Äôs a stupid idea. Mail-in voting is a good thing.  But here‚Äôs something I learned this week: Most states (31) require mailed ballots to be RECEIVED by Election Day. That‚Äôs stupid. #utpol
No, the argument isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs illegal for Trump to delay the election. It‚Äôs that he doesn‚Äôt have the power. The people who run elections in each state don‚Äôt work for him, unlike the DHS agents invading Portland or separating kids.

Totally agree. I should've put /s on it or something. We must vote, and we must vote Trump out of office. Failure to do so and, I believe, the "American Experiment" is over. The thing is, Trump doesn't kid. He intends to delay the election, indefinitely if he can. It's fightening

That's the entire point of not bailing out the USPS with any COVID relief.  The GOP has been trying to shut it down so it can be privatized for over a decade, and Trump's crusade against mail-in voting is just what they need to finally destroy it.

Maybe you should focus on stopping the trump virus in your own country and stop whining.
If trump thought it would help him win he would write us all a 1 million dollar check His only goal in life is to make more money and help his buddy Putin because Putin will help him make more money

We all knew that it was a matter of time before a well-known Trump supporter would succumb to the virus. Even with the terrible odds that it couldn‚Äôt be, it was still a black man that died for Trump‚Äôs cause.
Many people would handle almost everything better than Trump. Pretending someone else in charge would've prevented the pandemic hitting the US (hard) is naive.  I doubt there would've been much difference in (re)action taken earlier than April.
President Obama‚Äôs eulogy for John Lewis was just what I needed today. A glimmer of hope during an awful time. As flawed as we are as a country, we still deserve better than Donald Trump. This speech is a reminder we used to have it.

Absolutely Correct! Trump is a Russian-Elected-President. Russia hacked into our very unsecured computer voting system. Computer data can be manipulated without leaving evidence, but a piece of paper (mail-in ballot) cannot be hacked. With Mail-in Ballots, Russia cannot interfere
Trump Wreck 2020 should be their campaign slogan.

Genius! Trump Finds a Legal Way to Stifle Democratic votes
Is that why trump keeps talking about Trump 2028 and talking about delaying the election and saying mail in votes are fraudulent (while using it himself)?

I think that was the point of Trump and Hillary.
So, I just got this forwarded to me. This is where we're at with some of these Cult of Trump members. There is no logical barrier that they are unwilling to to take a hatchet to in order to keep up the illusion that Trump is some genius playing 5D chess.
Not very good optics for a number of reasons, especially when America gets to contrast the Trump's rambling, stuttering tangents with Obama's oratory skills on the same day. It'll make Trump sound even dumber than usual.
Trump wants to #MAGA
I don‚Äôt like Trump.  With that understood, please seek professional psychological help.  I mean that sincerely.

It‚Äôs a Trump thing. Lol
Trump
Please. It's obvious to EVERYONE that Trump plans to do everything he can to remain in power if (when) he loses the election. He's not going to accept losing, and engage in the long-standing American tradition of a peaceful transition of power.
I‚Äôll admit I gotta give trump some credit. He‚Äôs the only person in my whole life who I‚Äôve had so much hate for no one else has gotten close to the amount of hate I have for him
That being said, Facebook has clearly been playing favorites with conservatives. Zuckerberg has met personally with Trump at least a couple of times, and there are right-wing propaganda outlets such as Breitbart on their Facebook News program.
read the article, Howard knows this man well  Bush Cheney crowd do not like Trump if that says anything
He didnt defend his wife against Trump, what makes you believe he would defend the constitution.
Herman Cain was vehement about Covid being a hoax, was anti-mask, and was last seen at a Trump rally without a mask. But we have to pretend this is a somber occurrence? Fuck that.
no one thought trump would win, including Trump himself. Truth is he did not *want* to win, he wanted to run... but his debtors had other plans...
One of Donald Trump's very first actions in office was to convene a Blue Ribbon Panel to investigate voter fraud. So, I'm also sure you remember what happened, right. A year later the committee was quietly disbanding having found almost zero voter fraud. Google it.
‚ÄòNo reason to delay‚Äô November election, Utah official says in response to Trump warning results will be ‚Äòfraudulent‚Äô
He should be charged with manslaughter for Cain and every other person from those stupid rallies who has died and he can't legally do anything about the date of the election. Tweeting is not the job and trump is a ridiculous ignorant fool.
They'd have to open each ballot, then the postal worker would have. To alter them. They couldn't just throw away trump ballots as the number totals would clearly reflect lost votes. So every employee would have to be in on this conspiracy. It's insane.
Don‚Äôt you have some more of Trump‚Äôs campaign money to steal?

"Very likely" fact based. I doubt you know the details or if there were other underlying heath factors. Not to mention he literally just died, but immediately: this is Trump's fault! -- while out the otherside of your mouth you are cautious not to imply it could be self inflicted
gives Trump to much credit.  I WOULD believe that Trump was jealous of the attention being on John Lewis' memorial and needed to grab some attention for himself.  Because Trump is a child.

That‚Äôs because there wasn‚Äôt. It wasn‚Äôt even a heated campaign! People have no brains, then or now. I believe Trump is doing a great job but these liberal or far left democrats can‚Äôt see past their own hatred of Trump and work together. But they refuse to. He is not Hitler!

Do NOT ever use "SHAMELESS" in context with Trump, EVER! He knows NO shame, and NO depths too low!!

Yeah, sort of like listening to Donald Trump...
Suggesting something so fundamentally corrupt &amp; anti-democratic should be a deal-breaker for your support and Cox's support. But the good news is that Trump's suggestion will go nowhere, except anger a lot of people, &amp;  Republicans will lose a lot of power in a few months.

Trump has a plan, right? Oh maybe not!
Pretty sure that the Trump Train doesn't have breaks or make stops. It's a one way ticket to willful ignorance. The riders spent their life savings on the ticket. They aren't looking back.
Trump wants to delay the election because he knows he won't win. In three months, we will have (another) blue wave election, and, as a bonus, it's also a census year, which means Dems will get more control in more states over drawing districts.
Your desperation is showing &amp; it‚Äôs pathetic. Utah has had safe &amp; secure mail in voting for decades. Your 2016 voter integrity commission was forced to disband because ‚Äúno credible evidence was ever presented.‚Äù

I wonder why all of a sudden, voting by mail is such a problem when it‚Äôs worked fine for years. I‚Äôve done it. Trump‚Äôs family has done it. Show up to the polls. Cool. Vote by mail. Also cool. It‚Äôs strange Trump wants to vilify and spread bad info about voting by mail.
How excited are you for Kamala Harris to be running our country?  Honest question: would you rather have her or Trump?
Would you like a list of private companies that have bankrupted citizens? Or private companies that scammed people out of life savings (Trump ran one in fact)?
Thank you.  Now speak up about Trump's spreading of false information about mail-in voting and his attempts to sabotage the USPS.
Trump has given this country a lifeline to avoid having both him and Biden in office! Let's get #delaytheelection and #PresidentLeahy trending y'all! This is the answer!
Imagine playing golf with him.   Scenario 1 - 15-foot putt "That's a gimme, right?"  Scenario 2 -  After hitting it OB twice and 3 shoots out of the sand. Hey, Trump what did you get? "Par."

R.I.P. Herman Cain.  Tulsa County reported 261 confirmed new cases on Monday, a one-day record high, and another 206 cases on Tuesday. By comparison, during the week before the June 20 Trump rally, there were 76 cases on Monday and 96 on Tuesday ~
Wow. You supporting Trump or just calling us stupid?
Herman Cain has died of complications from the coronavirus. He was 74.  It's not clear when or where he was infected, but he was hospitalized less than two weeks after attending Trump's campaign rally in June.
In theory, you could argue that Trump is just trying to make it ‚Äúsafer and easier‚Äù too. That‚Äôs the problem.

Trump sounds like someone driven by narcissism and cowardice.
Hahah don‚Äôt get me started on politicians involved in sex trafficking and relationships with sex traffickers. :) i don‚Äôt care what trump said, I don‚Äôt care what republicans did or didn‚Äôt do, all I care about right now, is raising awareness on sex trafficking. Move on if you‚Äôre
All I can say it‚Äôs too bad he went to the rally and followed the misguided cruel leadership of trump
Yeah and that might be true. But it shouldn‚Äôt be. I don‚Äôt let trump dictate how I treat people. I get what Andrew is saying- it would be nice to a have a president that did more unifying. But we don‚Äôt have that right now- so do what you can in your own sphere of influence!
Why does what Trump says have any effect on how you or me should treat and see POC?? I find it irrelevant. Surely there are policies that can affect different minorities  uniquely, however that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT! (And you should :))

is that  true for tRump campaign ?
1. He‚Äôs testing the ‚ÄúTrump as King‚Äù waters. 2. He is setting up a way to delegitimize the results if they take time. 3. It‚Äôs drowning out certain realities like Ghislaine Maxwell, -33% GDP and the death of Cain.

I don't think it's so much that Trump is removing troops from Germany, but WHY he is moving them out of Germany. It's not like Trump is acting out some ideology, I suspect he is doing this for personal gain.

I‚Äôm pretty sure Mr Trump knows he doesn‚Äôt have the power to delay the election. He‚Äôs simply floating an option based on decent evidence of states on the struggle bus in regards to mail in ballots
There is a big diff between voting by mail/voting with an absentee ballet (which is what Trump did, because he lives in Washington, but his residency is in Florida). States are mailing out millions of vote by mail ballets. Which can be filled out fraudulently by anyone.
I called Trump out for not making an attempt to show respect to John Lewis (he could have negotiated with the family)  I am calling Obama out for his political speech at John Lewis's funeral...It was wrong, wrong, wrong.  Death should not be about politics, it is a damn shame.
There is a lot about Trump's White House people do not know, or they do know and do not want to speak on it , I have contacts in the West Wing myself and a couple cabinet members...

Not if President Trump refuses to leave and has his only Secret Police and forces to stop it from happening.  He has been planning this since last December when he got the rest intelligence report
i trust him. trump is winning. covid-19 has a lower death rate of the flu.
Every election has taken place on schedule going back to the ratification of the Constitution.  President Trump's suggestion that this year's election be postponed can easily be read as a tacit admission that he has failed where every other President in history has succeeded.
Trump has broken the law many times in the White House.  He hasn't been held accountable yet, because establishment politicians of both major political parties are weak and lack popular support after decades of corporatism.
I'm sure trump has learned a lesson
more or less what Trump is going for is implementing Market Rate Housing. Build more expensive houses so the rich move into the more luxurious housing, middle class move into high class housing, poor move into middle class, and people in poverty move into the previous lower class
death sits squarely on the shoulders of  who knew the rally should not be held.  If it wasn‚Äôt for Donald Trump and his disregard for science Herman Cain would be alive today. Very sad.

If you're concerned about Trump's call to postpone the vote (it is super concerning) this has great information. The more informed we are as a people, the more power we have to do what is right. #Vote2020
SIDE NOTE: THIS IS ALSO RACISM AT ITS FINEST. Trump has mainly associated blacks with poverty levels in the past- proceeds to associate crime with poverty- in turn taking more rights away from minorities here. oh my hell.

They did the Chinatown after Trump blamed Chinese people and literally people were attacking other Americans. And yes they made mistakes. But Trump once said it starts and ends with the President.l (paraphrasing). His words. Now he has to live by them. This after two Ebola deaths
Hahahahaha!! Thanks! That really escalated quickly. I truly despise trump.
Lol. Oh Trump.
Carlos is correct here. GWB was a worse President than Trump. Trump has not invaded any sovereign nations.
It‚Äôs a private business.  Just like you can restrict me from Trump Properties.
"It is, by any objective measure, an assault on the Government of the United States." I've got news for you. Trump and you are not the government. Bad cops and anonymous DHS are not the government. The government is all of us. "We the people..." Not we the privileged.

Trump shows us every day he‚Äôs no stable genius. Need to add something to his cognitive test: person, woman, man, camera, TV, I don‚Äôt remember
Yes, on November 3rd remember what huge liars Donald Trump and his kids are, and how ignorant they are about what constitutes freedom of speech. Vote Joe Biden! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

Q Anon... it‚Äôs a set of far right conspiracy theories linked to Trump‚Äôs administration
The best thing Trump has done has been to awaken people in the middle to the fact that America isn‚Äôt the best country anymore and maybe we should emulate those who have passed us by.
you and Teddy need to come up with a plan soon for the terrorist in Portland because trump has stated he is totally fed up no pun intended and is going to put out a warrant for your arrest for aiding and abetting
I think we should agree with briebart just this one time and encourage trump supporters to take their magic drug Hydroxychloroquine often!!!
Waiting for the Counterrevolution
I hear you, man. I guess I just think Trump is so much worse than (almost) the most moderate Democrat out of the primaries.
I challenge you, sir, to stop licking trump's taint
I will also add this, you not voting isn‚Äôt sending a message to the DNC or the RNC. Rubio and Jeb had their chances in 2016. Voters picked Trump. Same with Biden. You‚Äôre anger should be directed at the voters, not the parties.
Trump‚Äôs America
There‚Äôs two implications with that stand:  1. That you believe Biden would be just as bad as Trump. Do you really believe that?  2. That implicitly you are okay with Trump getting a second term. Do you really believe that?
Because Trump is still worse
Every single time. I don‚Äôt care that she‚Äôs conservative and pro-life, it‚Äôs her constant attempts at ‚ÄúGotcha!‚Äù that make her unbearable. Nasty, as her dude trump would say.
Except the research shows that third party voting (or not voting) always tends to favor one of the two candidates. Right now a lower turnout would favor trump, so by not voting you are really helping him ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Fewer gaffes from Trump? Come on. Trump just lied about being invited by the Yankees. Who does that?
I just hope Americans are smart enough to put a stop to Trump and Barr in November. Right now most Americans are pretty damn dumb the won't even wear a mask. I don't have much faith sadly.
Listening to Barr testify and all the Republicans sticking up for him, the entire Republican party IS corrupt and if we don't stop them in November we can kiss our asses goodbye, this is no joke, America is in deep shit under Trump and Barr!!!
Trump and Barr are screwing this country beyond belief. Wake the hell up America or face the damn shit hole this country has become but it will get MUCH worse.
Go Peterson. Cox is just another puppet for trump just like Herbert. We never have combat this virus right nor will we. Money and super packs have to much power over our politicians

Why is there not more outrage over Trump disrespecting John Lewis by failing to go to the Capitol today? Do we just expect Trump to behave poorly so it‚Äôs not news? It‚Äôs shameful disrespect by the president
We should just pay Trump and his family directly, with tax payer money. Like a ransom. Would cost less than the disastrous policies and decisions that are made only to generate corruption.
It is awkward. When you‚Äôre golfing with friends it‚Äôs weird having a stranger there too. But it sucks for singles too. Sometimes you just want to golf alone but they put you with a group. The presidental candidate that can fix this will get my vote, unless it‚Äôs Trump.
Trump doesn‚Äôt show respect to anyone who opposes him whether  you‚Äôre a civil rights icon, a former POW and long-time senator, or a former president.

I don't thing Donald Trump's use of #SleepyJoe has near the reach of Crooked Hillary. I think most of America agrees that we would be better with a president that is asleep all the time. Can't cause problems when you're asleep.

Did Trump keep the receipt? If not, he's not going to get his money back. No, it's Mexican pesos. No, Mex tacos. No, it's DOD $ for schools &amp; housing. No, it's my &amp; your money. He can't return the broken wall back to Home Depot or was it Lego? Welcome to the United States.
Nice sentiment. Wish our country would be that way. Get rid of Trump, it would be paradise without his scandals. üòÄ
The only exception will be in November if Trump loses. Then "Light'em if you got'em"
But probably not.  Trump is still Trump
Right, because there's never been a restraining order put in place without just cause. The reports of this happening are nebulous at best. It's politics.  Democrats are mad that Trump sent federal agents in, when they had themselves planned to let the federal buildings burn.

You won‚Äôt use our money to help us. If trump would have followed other, more educated leaders he would have shut down the country for 3 weeks. Paid people to stay home. 3 weeks and we would have been able to return to normalcy. It‚Äôs frustrating to watch him bungle this every day.

Just went camping with my family. Discussed factchecking, Trump, politics, science, etc., with my mother. She‚Äôs gone full blown -insert any conspiracy theory here-, Trump was appointed by god, factchecking is rigged, ignorant as fuck, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that‚Äù crazy. I‚Äôm beyond...
Politics and culture in this era: Bill O'Reilly gets inside the mind of Donald Trump:

Trump is playing dictator using the military against the American People. This image bankrupts soft power of the US across the globe, giving China huge advantages to expand. You do nothing to remove Trump from office. Ask him (and Pence) to resign!

Roping Trump into this pandemic is your last ticket to the promised land. And golly-gee I sure hope it works out for you considering how much time, effort, money/resources you‚Äôve clandestinely squandered to bring it about.
If you think anyone is safe with Trump..Go get some professional help
Trump salutes like üí© he looks exhausted must be from playing golf.
I think we all would, but it's always been this way, to a point. Not to the level Trump has taken it, obviously, but mudslinging has always been part of campaigns. You're right though, the sensationalism is the real annoyance. It's terrible.
I despise Trump, but this is dumb. That's the best she could do?
Lie! That‚Äôs not even #trump
God gave 10 hexes to Egypt for the leader to be so corrupt. Trump is that leader!. Hint Portland. God gave us the virus, God is done there. Get ready for earthquakes, hurricanes, power outages, major wars, food shortages, until Trump (Pence) resigns. Then God will bless the US.
Tell Senator Lee if he loves this nation and defends the US Constitution to tell Dictator Trump (and Pence) to resign. Hint Portland. Otherwise our troops have died for nothing!. God will no longer bless this nation and we will be no more!
If you think the whole world of leaders came together collectively to stage a fake viruis to unmantle Trump as president, then i really think you need some fucking help with paranoia. Because that has to be the DUMBEST fucking reason ive ever heard.
Senator Lee if you love this Country and defend the US Constitution! Tell Trump and Pence to resign! Otherwise our  Real Troops have died for nothing.

They should have called Trump out. Not that he would tell the truth but they could have asked him some questions.

Great job not showing a black man's hand on Trump, we all know how unrealistic that would be.
They are not outnumbered enough, I think the Democrats have united since 2016, and the vast majority of Independents are leary of Trump, and a few Republicans have turned off FOX news, it is coming to a vote in your area

Undoubtedly spreading Mr Trump's hatred and lies.
Because Republicans could careless about their country. It‚Äôs all about how much money they can make off the Government. The GOP are going to milk the government for all it‚Äôs worth. Trump how can i screw you and get more $$$$$$$.
you still have over 90 days to convince me why I should vote for you besides "not being as bad as Trump." Where is your condemnation of Gestapo style terror tactics? Where is your endorsement for #Medicare4All? Where is your endorsement for a #GreenNewDeal?
