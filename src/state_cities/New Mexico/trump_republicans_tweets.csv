Trump really trying to have niggas that were going to vote,  that NEVER vote , not even be able to vote. Like damn üòÇ
Exactly. Not every law is "controversial" but by definition they have to be political. The reason this is not semantics is because I think it is the legislative aspect that has a lot of people stressed out about mask wearing more so than what it does/does not signal about Trump.

Well, I guess from a purely political POV, Trump today throwing in the towel on fighting COVID (as if he ever fought it) virtually guarantees a blue wave. It‚Äôs horrific that another 150,000 or so will die by the end of the year and millions more become sick
And Trump wants everyone to catch the virus so they can get that DNA-COVID test and get the CHIP VACCINE. That's why he delayed reacting. Pre planned between him, Xi and Putin.
pull the plug on Trump‚Äôs lies. Or pull the plug on
Trump killed him
He had access to more than has been told. Why do you think Trump is trying to discredit him?
He better hope he doesn't have an undiagnosed heart condition. Trump is the new Jim Jones &amp; these people are happily drinking the Kool-Aid.
So he should not be believed because he doesn't like Trump? Oh and he had an affair. Got it. Trumphaters are bad. Includes all Democrats, Independents and non voters. Affairs are bad. Paying  porn stars and Playboy models for sex is ok cuz that's not an affair. Got it clear now.
Trump didn't start the War of 1812 either. That's not relevant. There often are delays in election results, primaries or general elections, especially in close ones.

Trump is preventing the future we could have, which requires TRUTH.  He has poisoned our information stream and believed Putin over our Intel and military patriots. I am a Navy Brat, don't attack our military!  #WhyIDontLikeDonaldTrump
You‚Äôre making the assumption people w/low incomes don‚Äôt work. Teachers, policemen, and the workers we‚Äôre now calling essential can‚Äôt afford to buy.  After the war govt helped fund decent neighborhoods for workers.  Now we just give real estate tax breaks to builders like Trump.
Why is he allowed in front of a news camera anymore? Seriously. A good question for the news agencies? We don‚Äôt let people in front of national news cameras that pathologically lie and cause deaths, so why allow Trump to do the same? It is NOT complicated.

Rhetorical question, of course: "OK, But Really: What If Obama Brushed Off Russian Bounties on American Soldiers?"

This. Right. Here. This is the main difference between Biden and Trump. Trump had all kinds of illusions about how he, himself could benefit from the presidency, and he absolutely does not give a shit about the history and the heart of this country.

You do know that Washington state has had mail-in-ballots #VoteByMail for many years, right? Safe. Accurate. No fraud.  The only reason you're "concerned" is that Trump is afraid that he'll lose the election, and wants to stop his loss anyway he can.
I am sad that President Trump was fooled by these people.
Jesus is our only savior. Q and Trump saving the world from the Deep State does not make sense from a Bible prophecy perspective.

yes , a speech by Obama vs a speech from the dictraitor say it all. its not really about trump for the followers as much as it is the propaganda driven hate created and propped up by fox and all of the right wing hate machine.
According to the constitution, but that doesn‚Äôt mean so much any more since Trump and Barr started taking a wrecking ball to it.
Trump is NEVER right. He's a idiot. He's a lier he's a cheat. He stole the presidential election and he's ruining r democracy.
Have you been following what has been happening in the USA to date, since Trump took office?  If you have, you wouldn‚Äôt be so dismissive.
Let's never forger that the Tea Party movement and Donald Trump's political career was entirely, entirely, based on white rage that a black man was President of the United States.
He died from cancer NOT 4 trump.

Trump supporters should support Trump by delaying their vote until after November 3rd, 2020.
Trump supports, as with following Trump's lead on wearing face masks due to the pandemic, I think you should also follow Trump's lead on this issue too by delaying the submission of your ballot to anytime after November 3rd, 2020.
Loyalty to Trump will literally kill you.
Yes. And I bet trump is pissed he wasn't invited. It's a beautiful service. R.I.P John
Challenging systemic racism is not easy, but it is worth the money and the work. This new move by Trump once again reinforces obstacles for poor people and people of color. Trump tells suburban voters they will 'no longer be bothered' by low-income housing

Nice to hear from you Puppet Trump!!!
The same thing thats wrong with Trump, working with him must be total Hostile environment. Louie should be counseled.
I try to talk to them once. If they are unreasonable I block. That has n almost all of them.  I I have had reasonable debates with 3 trump supporters in the last 3 months but no minds have n changed.
Lol, it‚Äôs on Trump
Donald Trump just lost the last talking point he had for the election: conservative columnist Then Thursday morning the world learned that the United States GDP dropped by 9.5 percent, in a record worst for the country. We have to control virus then econo
Nope.  Let the chips fall where they may.  I believe Pres Trump is correct on how legitimate voting may be considering the lengths dems have gone to remove him over the last 3 1/2 yrs, but election day cannot change.
Don‚Äôt worry, sir. Your place in legal history is secure - right under Trump‚Äôs left butt cheek. Though, since you‚Äôre so big on bothsiderism, feel free to visit the right one too.
I know most people are convinced that Q and Trump will save the world, but I think the Rapture and Tribulation are coming soon. Jesus is our only savior and not Q.

This wannabe dictator is incredibly dangerous. By the way, he voted by mail in the last election. #Trump #DumpTrump2020 #BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential #election
What if I did end up voting for trump? Would y‚Äôall feel different about me?
I don‚Äôt know how trump does it. I tweet  bout 2 stupid things a day and I‚Äôm exhausted.
If there‚Äôs anything lawyers need to learn recent history, it‚Äôs that the law will not save us. We‚Äôre getting down to government foundations here, which are always expressed through violence.  Trump can cancel the election if those responsible for enacting state violence let him.
So keep on "debating" like the typical arrogant and ignorant Trump supporter with no citations.
Donald Trump is the most prolific mass murderer in American history
Bruh. We all know the trump administration wants nothing to do with you.
I know it's not going to happen but could you imagine a Biden Michelle Obama ticket oh my God it that would be so powerful. Trump would just walk out of the White House getting the station wagon and the kids and all the shitthy people and leave WOW !
I love how Cowboys for Trump is commenting when the trump administration is now openly distancing from them. Facepalm.

Trump fired entire pandemic team in 2018 and ignored the notebook on how to deal with a pandemic he was left so yes, it is his fault.
The Law &amp; Constitution are holding up no matter how hard Trump tries to   break them.
Herman Cain, a former GOP presidential candidate and Trump campaign surrogate, has died after being hospitalized with COVID-19.  via  His diagnosis came less than two weeks after he attended President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign rally in Tulsa, OK
Time for Trump to go.  In person or by mail, I can assure you- Trump won‚Äôt get my vote. Believe me.
Actually it means Trump just found out why that wouldn‚Äôt work.
Why do you think Trump's stance is so awkward? It's hard to stand up straight with Putin's hand up your butt making your mouth move.
NM Sec. of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver today released a statement on President Trump‚Äôs suggestion to delay the November general election. ‚ÄúLet me be clear: the 2020 General Election in November will not be delayed,‚Äù  said. #nmpol

Why is my big brother dead and Trump continues to live and spew forth his bile on a daily basis?
Every single one of them will side with Trump. Just like with the impeachment.
You should do some research. Lana‚Äôs spoke out about Trump many times- she‚Äôs literally doing a fundraiser for native Americans in her new book
That man needs to be removed, impeached and disallowed for ever running for public office. Can you impeach a Secretary of State? That response of his is endemic of the Trump criminality creep.
His magical thinking is powerful today because he is cranky about the amazing John Lewis receiving so much love today.  Trump can't stand it when someone else receives love and better ratings.
"Trump praises demon sperm doctor..."
Really?  What parts are they re-writing?  Oh yea.. NONE This is just more fear mongering.  If anybody has tried to subvert our constitution is has been Trump.  Every action he takes tries to circumnavigate the balance of power built into our system.  He is a danger to our country
Fuck #Trump, this is #JohnLewis's day.
Trump declares Fox News unwatchable HAHAHAHA
Donald Trump should resign. Now. Pass it on.
Why someone with serious underlying conditions like he had would put his life at risk for Trump is baffling. I just don‚Äôt understand the thought process of those Trump sycophants.
Hey  take Trump's advice. DISTANCE and wear a mask! ü§†ü§†ü§†ü§†#Nmpol
Republicans in office agree with Trump, that‚Äôs why we need to vote them out.  Many Republicans and their Leaders are compromised like Trump, that‚Äôs why we need to vote them out.  Several Republicans spent July 4th in Russia, that‚Äôs why we need to vote them out.
I know I'm going to regret this but I will ask.... I hate politics because they are ALL liars... Obama did some bad things, trump is race baiting daily how can anyone honestly vote for anyone? For the record I've voted on both sides....just asking..
Trump floats delaying election over mail-in voting, legal experts say that power rests with Congress  via
Trump has the blood of Cain and over a hundred thousand innocent souls on his hands. His response to the virus has been reckless (at best); his holding of public rallies against the advice of  internationally renowned scientists, unconscionable.  VOTE!

I will never say "claim down Liz". I've been really keeping up with CNN "Trump's fake news" for the updates of covid and heard what another dumb stuff he is pulling.  My face hurts cause of too many face palm moments.
He is jealous of Lewis' praise today.  A moment without attention is agony for Trump.
Watch the documentary Kill Chain.  Trump should have lost Michigan in 2016.  Abrams should have won in Georgia.  Paper ballots are more secure.  They can be recounted / audited.
Hi Lauren, sorry for introducing the Cowboys(fake cowboys) for Trump bot into your Twitter feed, I pointed out that Couy's hateful rhetoric was wrong and now the bot follows me around on here, even when all I do is post meat loaf recipes and pictures from my  watch

Temper tantrum Trump
I‚Äôm beginning to think that die-hard, blind Trump followers are the true RiNOs. Any Republican worth their salt has already demonstrated their commitment to the Constitution.  ‚ÄúCountry over Party‚Äù is more than just a slogan, and real Republicans are wearing it with pride.
‚ÄúCain was among the highest-profile public figures in the United States to have died from Covid-19. Cain had attended Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis.‚Äù
What does this have to do with your perceived opinion? He‚Äôs trying to put off the election which he cannot do without congress. If you‚Äôre thinking trump losing the election is going to result in that Qanon tinfoil hat shit you‚Äôre sincerely naive.
‚Äúpolling this month shows white suburban Americans are far more worried about the economy and healthcare than crime‚Äù

Don't be so naive, if Trump said to wear a mask in January every Democrat would be against masks.   He shut down travel from China and just as soon as he did Democrats called him racist and xenophobic.

I think you're overstating the ability of the debates to effect the race that much. Voters aren't stupid, and if somehow don't get that much worse, then they'll still remember the incompetence of the Trump administration
This is INFINITELY worse. Nixon wasn‚Äôt a paragon of virtue, but he pales compared to The Hemorrhoid. Even ‚ÄúTricky Dicky‚Äù spins in his grave over Trump.....

So, the point of this poll is what?  That we are where we are in this Pandemic because of Republicans? Maybe.  Me, I believe leaders are elected to, ohhh, I dunno...lead? TRUMP IS THE ONE KILLING US ALL.  And CONGRESS IS WATCHING THE MASSACRE.
Because this is where we are, America. Where TF is CONGRESS? Trump is a wannabe gangster with balls the size of gummy bears.  To compensate he sends in his ‚ÄúSecret Police‚Äù to stop folk from Free Speech, nabbing them into unmarked cars.  WHO is for The Constituents? Fire them all.
At this point, there is nothing Trump could or would ever do that would convince me he cares about anyone but himself. #TrumpFailedAmerica  #GOPComplicitTraitors

This some Trump mess
I would say she is approaching DEFCON 3 about now. She has a target on her back. Trump's knows which till she has her hands in. He's sending the troops to examine her under a microscope. Shouldn't be hard though since she pushed through sanctuary status bullshit. A Fed offense.
I‚Äôm not a Trump fan but I support some federal help, I bet the police do too.  Overcome your TDS!
Trump: "There were two? I thought there were more."
I couldn‚Äôt agree more  If President Trump gave any guidance  would label him a dictator and not follow any of his guidance because you hate him.  Own your own shitty decisions.  You forget there are hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans who support our President!!
Both were ‚ÄúProgressive ‚Äú way before Trump came along.

#ChinaJoe said, Trump is wrong to hold China accountable for coronavirus because Americans can‚Äôt tell the difference between a South Korean and someone from Beijing.  Where‚Äôs the media outrage?!  Racist?!  Joes gotta go (to assisted living).
It's kind of important to understand that, to Trump and the GOP, property has as much value as lives, and often more value.
I never said I was. I don‚Äôt agree with trump on everything. I will say this. The feds are here to help I‚Äôm not assuming that it‚Äôs not genuine. The fact is apd needs help. They‚Äôre short handed so even if feds are just giving some relief so apd to able to get things done...

I fear this is what is going to happen BECAUSE Trump is sending in his troops. In ABQ yes there is a high crime rate, always has been. What we don't have is riots, which will happen as a result Trump is daring folks to do so. #TrumpsGestapo

Don't really care what your party affiliation or non-affiliation is, as long as you vote against Trump and GOP, who are clearly dragging us into fascism.

This is because we are a Dem led state!Trump administration considers sending more federal officers to Albuquerque, state and city officials respond | KRQE News 13
There is no question whatsoever and  no evidence of any raceism whatsoever in Donald Trump's life. There is some question about Joe Biden being closet raceist and a lifetime in public service no less as a southern politician.
Get off the f'n Liberal Bus! They're not f'n; Secret Police, you dip! There was and is nothing secret about them, (Lemon drop)! Trump had a press conference, announcing their deployment throughout specific troubled Cities, who refused to take a part in quelling the violence! ü§´

And asshole cops like this racist gem have just got absolute support by trump because they are ‚Äúdeserving of our respect for keeping us safe.‚Äù
You just can't stand the idea that Trump genuinely cares about Americans and America. So you say it's all about politics to him. You are such a hypocrite. Why don't you come out of the closet and admit that you're a Democrat?
So today, you hung up on a caller when he said that to Keller, it's all about politics and that he doesn't care about the people. You disagreed and hung up on him. And then, 15 minutes later you accuse President Trump of using federal agents as a political move.
For our safety, sanity and health - we need #TheEnemyOfThePeople Trump the fuck out! He is #KillingUsAll.  We need ROGUE SF.
Gestapo Trump.
Trump justs gave every single family who has grieved/grieves a loved one murdered &amp; maimed by anarchist police the finger.  Once again this Ass Hat has turned his back on folks with unnecessary pain in their hearts.
What's different is that Trump is eager to divide us using racism and its ever-present sibling, fear, as a wedge.

TRUMP is a business man that rebuilt our economy. He has no military background. His downfall is being an ass and not listening to his military advisor. He ain't perfect, but he is better than Biden and the Marxist left.
Because we have 2 choices. And Biden will give this country away. He will destroy the family unit worse than it is now and give into Marxist theology. At least Trump is trying to save what's left the best he knows how.
Inside Trump‚Äôs Failure: The Rush to Abandon Leadership Role on the Virus  The roots of the nation‚Äôs current inability to control the pandemic can be traced to mid-April, when the White House embraced overly rosy projections to proclaim victory and move on.
Nope. Everyone needs to.  Unfortunately, you won't have a chance currently, Joe is the best option this close in order to defeat trump.Someone should point this out to the MSM the next time they cry when President Trump talks longer than 5mins in the Rose Garden.
I supported him in 2016 before Trump became the nominee. I'm glad he is able to work w/ the President now. Hope he runs again.
But they also know how temporary their work can be and how that was installed not for men like them but for men like Trump.
True, but we did want to stay home during a pandemic and that is going to impact the economy. I would have rather heard about what % of that could have been spared if the gop had not called it dems new hoax and still acts like it's no big deal, okay per Trump, to risk lives.

President Donald Trump's administration will continue to reject new applications for an immigration program that allows young, undocumented immigrants to live and work in the country but will let current "Dreamers" renew those protections.
These judges will turn their back on #MoscowMitch. Why? Because good always prevails over evil. They know what he is doing is pure corruption and at some point will throw mitch under the bus for all of it because Trump will be gone &amp; Mitch will still be slithering around.

Me either. Fear is not an emotion that is even relevant to what is happening in America by white supremacist fake police and their grandmaster Trump.

trump‚Äôs america!!! I hate him!
What really bugs me isn‚Äôt the Trump and others don‚Äôt know how to handle any crisis. It is that won‚Äôt ask for help when their plans go down in flames.
Twitter should have a blackout. Trump would be disarmed by SM so, he will hurl himself at cameras while fuming, which we know works out really well for him. üòÅüòâ

There are no protests in Abq. We are quiet people for the most part. If Trump wants to fight Native Americans he might just want to go ahead and shot himself in the foot now because that, that is genocide.

While I agree with the sentiment, I'm not sure it will withstand a Constitutional challenge.  Art 1, Sec 2.3 seems to allow it, but the 14th Amend, sect 2 appears to revise representation.  The Courts may have to figure it out.   -
True. Sensational headlines were more important, and keeping quite to see if Trump would bring them into his inner circle. They only started pushing back when they were certain they were only in the friend zone.  *them/they = ALL SENATORS &amp; REPRESENTATIVES
