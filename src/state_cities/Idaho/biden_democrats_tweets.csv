Joe Biden needs a running mate who understands the international challenges with Russia and China and can be President on day 1 if needed. That‚Äôs Senator Harris. Not Congresswoman Bass.
Hillary is stepping in last minute for dementia Biden and Clinton name needs to be "scandal" free as long as possible.
Well said. Al Gore was a loyal VP who certainly didn‚Äôt lack for ambition. Joe Biden was a loyal VP to Obama and doesn‚Äôt lack for ambition. So an African American woman can‚Äôt be loyal with the same level of ambition? That‚Äôs an awful take by Rendell, Dodd and company!
Joe Biden's search for a running mate enters final stretch.

She has said she‚Äôs not interested. Hasn‚Äôt this family given enough? I‚Äôm trusting Biden to chose the right fit for him, and for America.
Realistically though, those are your choices. The president on 1/21/21 will be Biden or Trump.  Pick the one that gets you more of what you want and push that direction. Then, after the election, continue to push them.
Biden's plan is a public option: "Medicare for all who want it". It's a big step toward what you want.  Biden's plan is decriminalized marijuana. A big step forward.  etc.  All improvements on the status quo, all better than Trump. He's not your 1st choice, but he's the best left
Four other Presidents lost the popular vote but won the Presidency via the E.C. THAT is the way it was designed. Americans ARE WATCHING..but staying silent..until Nov. 3rd.   Biden is in EARLY-STAGE DEMENTIA.  Trump wins easily! #KAG2020LandslideVictory
Joe Biden!!!!! A pervert that has been accused of sexually attacking a woman that work with him! Where‚Äôs the outrage women???? What‚Äôs the deal???? You had plenty when it wad kavanaugh!
I'm an overall fan of LBJ. But lets not pretend he was to the left of Clinton, or Obama, or Hillary, or Biden.   LBJ was really good (domestically) for the late 60s, but he'd be one of the old white dudes you hate if he were in Congress now.
Fox has never got it right. They‚Äôre wearing trump issued blinders.  Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.
Plenty is said about his record.  Give me something you don't think was covered and I'll do a google search and pull articles from every mainstream site out there.  Biden gets plenty of negative coverage.
Ah there you're just complaining about demographics.  Biden had strong support within the party establishment, Bernie is... disliked. So of course there aren't articles out there talking about "the establishment" getting ready to sink Biden in favor of Bernie.
Bernie was a unique lightening rod. He generated great enthusiasm among his supporters but also his detractors.  But I saw plenty of "Never Biden" or "Never Warren" or "Never Pete" stuff. They all took their lumps.
Endorsements aren't "corrupt" or "damaging".  It wasn't corrupt or damaging when AOC and Omar and Tlaib endorsed Bernie in the fall. It wasn't corrupt or damaging when Pete and Amy or Obama endorsed Biden.  It's normal politics.
To get the news "overwhelmingly negative" for Bernie they have to count any non-positive news. So Bernie has a heart attack and the news reports on it, it's negative. Biden leads in the polls and the news reports, it's negative.  In reality, that's just what was happening.
I will be happy with whomever Biden picks as his VP.
The same poll shows this, you loser: ‚ÄúThe new national telephone and online survey finds Biden with 48% support among Likely U.S. Voters to Trump‚Äôs 42%.‚Äù
MA voted on Super Tuesday. Warren dropped out just afterwards.  But polling (as well as results after she dropped out) showed that Warren supporters basically split between Bernie and Biden. Her being in the race didn‚Äôt change the outcome.

The only thing is there wouldn't be an uprising because people's eyes would be closed to reality like they were under Obama. Everything the protesters are protesting existed under Obama and will exist under Biden but people weren't paying attention.
Pretty sure Biden's dead

EVERYBODY thought the DELIBERATE CHINA PLAGUE would go away as in our ENTIRE lifetime this is the 1st time it EVER happened..Sleepy eyed CREEPY Biden would have COLLAPSED our entire country by now!!

It is soooo obvious ....  our local   whines about Trump Jr making a Barbi joke but totally IGNORES Biden saying the covid vaccine might not  "be real" ...  they are such obvious lackeys.
Can't stand Biden but after 6 months of grief and disappointment. I made a choice to vote for him. It would be wrong to assume I support Joe Biden. He does not represent me or what I stand for but Trump must go. Biden is a means to an end. Sorry. Time has run out.
On this week‚Äôs episode of the Beyond the Bubble podcast, we discuss why Democrats and Republicans are taking different approaches to voter canvassing, and the latest on the Biden veepstakes.
In January Biden said he would completely ban vaping. President Trump has acknowledged several times that vaping and flavors are important to adults who quit smoking. Very clear policy differences between them on vaping right now
And Joe Biden said that a new covid vaccine might not be "real" ...  hmmmmm which one of these is more newsworthy ?
Minor problem with your little assessment ... Biden's words and actions belie all three of the qualities you attributed to him. #ReplaceBiden
Pete won Iowa. Followed by Bernie. Followed by Warren.   Biden was 4th in Iowa.
Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Warren had 8 Amy had 7  2nd place did not drop out to endorse 4th. 3rd and 5th dropped out to endorse a close 2nd.
Wondering where the articles showing concern about Joe Biden are at the Idaho Statesman .... there are a very few articles and NONE question his cognitive issues, his policy issues, or recent statements.   Hmmmmm  WHY ???
Under a Biden administration, certainly. Trump and Kushner - never. They haven't even been able to gets tests of adequate PPE.

Look at Idaho.  19 in 20 odds he wins.   I'm still volunteering to work a polling place. I am encouraging everyone I know to vote Biden.  If they can't do that I encourage them to sit this one out.   Doing my part as a never trumper to cut those odds.  Dang idahoans.

Biden: ‚ÄúMark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow.‚Äù  #WeWillVote #OneTermTrump #Trumpbounty #RememberInNovember  Trump's tweet about delaying the election is just the beginning of a much more dangerous plan
If I have to crawl over broken glass, wearing a mask I will vote. The only way I wouldn't  vote for Joe Biden is if I was unconscious or dead.
I hate Trump but I'm pretty confident he's still going to eek out a win. The media will eventually pivot to asking where Biden has been (seriously, where the hell is he) and Biden will come out and look stupid and that lead will shrink fast.
Camel-Face Harris to run along side her hero (Not)Biden . Remember how she dismantled him at the debate ? We do -but he already forgot-he probably forgot her name .. or who she is ! Burn !ü§Æ

In Jan., the terms of all representatives, 1/3 of the senators, the president &amp; the vp expire. Elections are controlled by the states.The Repub controlled states might choose not to vote which would insure a Pres Biden, and a much bluer Congress. Either way, the GOP is toast.
Also, I admit not only disgust for Biden but reluctance to get off the fence. I'm insecure about who Biden picks for VP will push me back up to my spot on the fence.
OK, so why don‚Äôt you step aside,and we‚Äôll know on Nov. 3rd that Joe Biden is our new President. You need to end the madness now.
I hear you. But confess it, that I refused to vote for Hillary or Trump last election. Though I can't stand Biden I feel terrorized enough to vote for him. Dear God, spare us from another Trump term.
And also the veil is being lifted as to who will really be Biden's handler if he's elected - it's going to be the Obama show
A great loss (epitome of 'representative').   "Though I am gone, I urge you to answer the highest calling of your heart and stand up for what you truly believe."  So ... don't vote for . Biden &amp; the other centrist hacks oppose most of what progressives "truly believe".
And where does he say he's supporting Biden? Otherwise, it's just noise.

Biden! He surely has people on staff tasked to work with Labor--call or email them and ask what you can do. Call your locals and internationals and ask what's in the works. If you're not satisfied they're doing enough, make some noise and good trouble, starting w/your locals.

All three did. Clinton and Biden voted for Iraq. Biden was calling for invading Iraq before 9/11 even. All three did so in Libya. Obama and Biden facilitated a fucking genocide in Yemen (which is still ongoing, fyi).

Biden will have inadequate time to respond, all the allegations against Trump are already known, and people will be casting their vote before it can be thoroughly debunked.  If they're really good, they'll keep it really general so it cant ever be confirmed or debunked.
Now, it's well documented that Joe Biden has had issues updating his sense of personal space from the 1970 model to the 2010 edition.  This sets the perfect stage for an allegation of encouraging or operating a child sex trafficking ring a few days out from the election.

Literally the number 1 criterium for Biden‚Äôs VP pick should be their ability to win the presidency in 2024. There is absolutely no scenario wherein Biden could or should serve multiple terms.

It is unconscionable that there is not a new moratorium on evictions. Congress has not funded further unemployment insurance or stimulus payments. Soon, we won‚Äôt recognize this country. Biden will have to tackle these problems when he takes office/real people are going to suffer.
While I don't presume to know who Biden will pick, Kamala would make an EXCELLENT Vice President! I've thought so all along.

Having to vote for Joe Biden is like having your to play football when your coach start his own son who plays like shit
Yes, both he and Warren should have remained in the race. Biden mostly went unchallenged in the debates (no doubt because the others didn't see him as a viable threat), had they crushed him (which would have been easily accomplished) -he would NOT be the nominee.
Now that is a Presidential act by VP Joe Biden... paying respect to Rep. John Lewis.

Trump is losing big to Biden in voter polls. Here‚Äôs how this will likely play out on Election Day
Aside from whether you're a fan of hers or not, why is anyone considering giving up a Senate seat from Massachusetts? The Republican Governor will appoint a replacement. Dumb. Joe Biden's first 100 will be conducted at warp speed and we need all the Dems in the Senate we can get.
Joe Biden:   Oh crap .... why didn't someone tell me ?
I guess this would be what Joe Biden‚Äôs equal opportunity for women looks like?
This has needed to happen for yrs parents need to take their schools back ! If joe Biden is elected the schools will be federalized .
Coming to a city near you if joe Biden is elected . This a test city of what socialism is . Socialism never ever has worked it transforms into communism its the step 1 into becoming communism. The election is two choices America vs communism. Should be easy choice .
these people hate America and the if Joe Biden gets elected this will be all of America cities . They will go to the suburbs next.

Both Sanders &amp; Warren should have stayed in until the convention &amp; we should have 'fought' there (still could if 'protesters' would take the momentum to the convention &amp; demand his replacement but, not likely). I'd be happy with either one. Regardless, I will NEVER vote for Biden
This is terrifying, you guys.  are laying the foundation for deadly force. Expect more of these ‚Äúbags‚Äù to be discovered in the coming days and weeks. Next find may very well yield a copy of The Communist Manifesto and a Biden 2020 campaign button. #FascismInTheUSA

Lmao Biden cant even speak for himself at the dnc convention. funny how Trump draws millions of viewers when he speaks while Biden draws a whole 19 when he speaks.
This is just silly if we couldn't invoke the 25th for Trump what thinks anyone would do it with Biden ugh
Lol, what a dumb headline. Biden can barely string a sentence together, the liberal mobs are burning the cities, while you continue to root it on?  The red wave is coming and I‚Äôm sitting in my beach chair getting a nice tan. Want to do my back for me?
Mindlessly retweet  because this is about hurting  Never you mind that Joe Biden won't do shit for you. He's 83% of the exact same policies we hate in Trump and 17% the corporate sell out that created him.
I'm ordering a Philly cheesesteak and a lager and then I'm asking him why he refused to ever criticise Biden's atrocious record.

Hard to blame a loss on a rigged election.  We have many bubbles needing deflated.  Any president these days is in a pickle.  If Biden is elected we will continue the slope of hurt financially.  Is it that you won‚Äôt, or are you not allowed to do what‚Äôs necessary?
Follow  if you don't already. Despite what Republicans and Fox news, and in fact, a lot of pundits are saying, Biden is putting out great content everyday. Get on the #BidenTrain
That‚Äôs the problem! They are made of up neocons and war mongers. Why would we want Biden to be beholden to their demands? Biden is already Centrist enough - He doesn‚Äôt need any more advice from the military industrial complex than he‚Äôs already getting‚Ä¶
‚Äúfor others, the election of Joe Biden and a sudden lurch back to the left.‚Äù  LOL The election of Joe Biden means a lurch back to the CENTER.
The plan to wreck the economy and Trump‚Äôs second term election will not work.  He only loses through voter fraud unless some new candidate other than Biden appears.
Maybe Ive had to many concussions( Ive had 9, is that to many? ) but if Biden can hold his own ( I can believe Iam saying this) he very well could be our next President but if Trump can rattle him a few times, come out on all cylinders well this might look like a mike Tyson fight

I will be voting. But for  Biden is a DISASTER already happening and waiting to happen. I don‚Äôt see how someone can support someone that can‚Äôt even speak or stay on topic.

It‚Äôs not really close at all right now actually.  Biden is crushing Trump in almost every swing state on RCP.
Warren has positioned herself as the compromise between Bernie and Biden. It made sense for her to stay in and see how that message played out when it was down to basically those 3.  It didn‚Äôt work, but it wasn‚Äôt 100% crazy.
Warren was regarded as having the best ground game, and didn‚Äôt do well. Biden didn‚Äôt have anyone on the ground in several ST states he won. Hillary had the far superior ground game in the 2016 general...  I‚Äôve begun to suspect that ground doesn‚Äôt matter as much anymore.
There's a big difference here between the two as far as just your headliner goes- Impeached Trump infringes on other copyrights and is usually served up with cease and desist orders. Joe Biden uses honesty and permissions.
And if we‚Äôre going to play the ‚Äúwhat if game‚Äù Bloomberg hurt Biden far more than Warren hurt Bernie.  Without Bloomberg in the race Biden stands an outside shot at CA and CO. And would have gained ~20-30 delegates more than he did.
Even her campaign tactics back this up: Warren had positioned herself as the compromise candidate for those who didn‚Äôt like Bernie or Biden. It‚Äôs not shocking that when she drops and Bernie/Biden are the candidates left they basically split between the two.
In NC she had 10.5%. Bernie would have gained .5%. Biden won NC by 8.9. Still would have won.  The math and polling says not a single state would have flipped, and he would have only gotten a handful of delegates.  Which is exactly what happened when she did drop. Neat.
A 5% net gain of Warren‚Äôs 15.7% in ME would have been a swing of .8 to Bernie, Biden won it by 1.2%. Still would have won.  In Texas she had 11.4%. Bernie would have gained about .6%. Biden won by 4.5%.  In MN she had 15.4%. Net gain for Bernie ~.8%. Biden won by 8.7%.  Etc...
Warren voters were 20% of MA. Bernie had a 5% edge over Biden as 2nd choice.  So if Warren drops out, Biden goes up, Bernie goes up slightly more. His 5% edge with 20% of voters yields a 1% net swing.  Biden won MA by 6.9%. If Warren drops out Biden only wins it by like 5.9%.
I'm not sure where in Biden‚Äôs voting record you get evidence that he's a constitutionalist.  When you find it please reply.  Also note. This doesn't mean I'm supporting the other guy either.
You know that he didn‚Äôt differentiate between republicans and democrats here, and didn‚Äôt mention trump? He is talking about Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton, Biden, Pelosi, McConnell, all of them are in the club.
And beyond polling, we can also look at 3/10 or 3/17 after Warren actually does drop out to see what happened.  And what happened was Biden‚Äôs margin of victory got bigger.  Bernie was helped by the divided field far more than he was hurt. Polls and results both prove it.
This is where Warren supporters stood the day before Super Tuesday. Bernie does take slightly more, but only slightly.  Applied to states/delegates it makes very VERY little difference. Bernie might win TC#X and might gain another 15 delegates total. But Biden would still lead.
NOQ Report - Conservative Christian News, Opinions, and Quotes: Joe Biden‚Äôs silence on violent Antifa and BLM riots is deafening
Warren voters were roughly evenly split between Bernie/Biden for 2nd choice. If she drops out before Super Tuesday it probably only results in 10-20 more delegates and 1-2 more states. Biden still leads by a lot.
I think the Trump campaign needs to find another hill to die on. If Biden is suffering from dementia at least he‚Äôs not a monster suffering from dementia.

Everybody saying "Biden can be moved left" better be protesting.
When Pete and Amy dropped out they were not ahead of Biden in delegates.  After SC Biden was a close second in delegates. He was only behind Bernie by like 5. Everybody else was at least 30 back from Biden.
That‚Äôs just incorrect.  After South Carolina, which was before Super Tuesday, Biden was #2 in delegates. He was only abou 5 behind Bernie and like 30 ahead of Pete.
Delegates are bound (on the first ballot). They can‚Äôt change their mind at the convention. A Biden delegate can‚Äôt vote for Bernie (or vice versa).  A ‚Äúcontested convention‚Äù happens when no candidate gets a majority on the first ballot. That‚Äôs not going to happen here.

Granted, before that we also didn‚Äôt have tangible evidence of how absolutely awful Trump could be in the position, only speculation. Biden does have a remarkable lead on Trump, even pulling over states that aren‚Äôt normally swing states.

I agree. Who could actually want Biden as a president. He has his own agendasCamel-Face Harris to run along side her hero (Not)Biden . Remember how she dismantled him at the debate ? We do -but he already forgot-he probably forgot her name .. or who she is ! Burn !ü§Æ
If you can predict that with Biden then you can surely see the mental illness in Trump. My daughter has Aspergers and Trump has all those signs plus lots lots more
This time last year my hopeful prediction was a Biden / Harris ticket. At that time there was not a collective backing for Biden...but now here‚Äôs hoping!!  Harris would be a smart pick for VP or to replace the despicable Barr as Attorney General.
Just like the HRC conspiracy, it will move uncomfortable Biden voters for the critical time period, then fade into the category of 'funny/obscure' electoral trivia.
This is what our whole country will be like If the radical socialist democrat get control of our whole country . Under a joe Biden presidency the criminals will be the protected .  is the one standing between this type of America and a law and order America.
Biden will have inadequate time to respond, all the allegations against Trump are already known, and people will be casting their vote before it can be thoroughly debunked.  If they're really good, they'll keep it really general so it cant ever be confirmed or debunked.
Now, it's well documented that Joe Biden has had issues updating his sense of personal space from the 1970 model to the 2010 edition.  This sets the perfect stage for an allegation of encouraging or operating a child sex trafficking ring a few days out from the election.
He is clearly on drugs...that they likely gave him.  They did the same thing with Hillary, but it was far less noticeable.  Biden's bell has completely cracked and he is unfit for any further service to this country.  the Liberal/Socialist "Cult" has taken control of him.
You mean like Biden
No, that‚Äôs Biden who doesn‚Äôt know where he is!
#Biden   I want to know this woman!
If you woke up tomorrow to ANY headline in the world news, what would that headline read?  #WearADamnMask  #Biden
You would need a personality like #POTUS to fight off these predators. Can‚Äôt help but feel #Biden Is running to protect his son.
While I don't presume to know who Biden will pick, Kamala would make an EXCELLENT Vice President! I've thought so all along.
And that will stop overdoses ü§î tell me how that makes any sense . Atleast before the election we are seeing socialism being used in America so it‚Äôs easy to see what a joe Biden ran country would be like . The Purge
Biden, you will never get my vote or any of my families vote. You sir are the scum of the earth.   VOTE RED TO SAVE AMERICA   GODBLESSAMERICA üá∫üá∏
Evangelicals are raised to  value faith more than doubt. Critical thinking is based on doubt, which is discouraged.  Biden's base has a lower percent of  white evangelicals.
This should be a lesson for Dems in the upcoming election.  Unite behind Biden or  Trump will win again.
Lmao capital police confirmed no death threats were mad but you clearly just believe what your tv tells you. Did you know they sky is falling and you should hide in your basement like your canidate Biden.
Get Ready America ! Susan Rice is skating in behind Biden to take the White House . You want to know what America will look like ? Take a good hard look at NYC, Chicago, Portland, San Francisco, Baltimore,etc. Hell will look good compared to a Democratic run White House .
Trying to Appease Muslims, Biden Inadvertently  Calls for Jihad
President Trump did more in three years than Biden and Democrats did in 40+. Their big policy accomplishment was to decimate the black Family and murder black and unborn babies.
President Trump accomplished more in three years than Biden and the Democrat Party has in 40 plus. His leadership changed for the best, the direction of this Nation. Biden is bought and Paid for by China.

Thank you, President Biden!!!
Having to vote for Joe Biden is like having your to play football when your coach start his own son who plays like shit
This has needed to happen for yrs parents need to take their schools back ! If joe Biden is elected the schools will be federalized .
Coming to a city near you if joe Biden is elected . This a test city of what socialism is . Socialism never ever has worked it transforms into communism its the step 1 into becoming communism. The election is two choices America vs communism. Should be easy choice .
these people hate America and the if Joe Biden gets elected this will be all of America cities . They will go to the suburbs next.
Lmao Biden cant even speak for himself at the dnc convention. funny how Trump draws millions of viewers when he speaks while Biden draws a whole 19 when he speaks.
Lol, what a dumb headline. Biden can barely string a sentence together, the liberal mobs are burning the cities, while you continue to root it on?  The red wave is coming and I‚Äôm sitting in my beach chair getting a nice tan. Want to do my back for me?
Biden could actually pass away and probably still poll higher than Trump
the the joe Biden plan to destroy suburbs how we know it needs to explained and put to the people. His HUDD plan is to complete destroy suburbs to move to progressive agenda and the green new deal and really a UN plan . If U live in the burbs Joe is coming 4 you!
Vote joe Biden the suburbs are over eventually they will tell you where you will live what to wear and when and what to eat . People love him or hate   is the only thing standing between the real true free America to a socialist that will be communist country.
Self defense all the way ! These cities are the example of what America will be if joe Biden is President. It will actually get worse .
Even with Biden leading in polls, as Hillary did in 2016, Trump can still win.  Overconfident Dem, Sore (Bernie) loser, October surprise, ...  Remember November, Vote.
I will be voting. But for  Biden is a DISASTER already happening and waiting to happen. I don‚Äôt see how someone can support someone that can‚Äôt even speak or stay on topic.
These nut jobs can never get in power or America will be communist country over night . America you vote joe Biden that‚Äôs it , it over finished signed sealed delivered our country will be over as you‚Äôve ever known it .
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Bernie needed small donors, Biden doesn't. He's got all the big money and isn't asking us to support him by showing us that he supports us - fuck him.
Lmao a whole 5 people makes it biden country. This is the funniest thing ive seen all day.
Another example of a joe Biden America
is the only one me to keep this from being what United States could end up being under Joe Biden leadership
America they end up in the suburbs next .  is the only fire wall to save our country and have law and order. Biden gets in its over this country will die
I've always been an independent but will vote Biden. Absolutely have to. I cannot stand trump and his cronies.
They sold us to China and let liberal policies destroy America. 4 yrs of  thank god got back about a decade of loss but if Biden is elected our country is done this is no exaggeration it‚Äôs completely and factually true . 4 more of DJT will erase what those 4 ruind
BIDEN IS TRYING TO STEAL THE ELECTION.
Joe Biden didn't write this tweet #Trump2020
Granted, before that we also didn‚Äôt have tangible evidence of how absolutely awful Trump could be in the position, only speculation. Biden does have a remarkable lead on Trump, even pulling over states that aren‚Äôt normally swing states.
The real ‚Å¶ why would anyone elect a racist do nothing going no where politician and if it‚Äôs just because you hate Trump don‚Äôt do that to yourself. It‚Äôs really freedom vs socialism prosper vs go broke . Biden will ruin America
Biden winning in November
I already said I agree with that point. Still doesn‚Äôt make him unelectable üôÑ   I think we should just Trump get re elected and let everything burn because Biden makes gaffs. Makes sense.
And Biden is still 1000% better than Trump. Anyone who says different are delusional.

Well it doesn't fit the democrats agenda of fear and panic until november 4th so of course everything needs to be closed and the economy needs to not rebound. How else could Biden ever stand a chance.
Ok.  I am acutely familiar with dealing with a person with dementia.  Biden is not well, period.
America you vote in Joe Biden the schools will totally be put into the socialist liberal radical indoctrination. The New York Times put out an article today saying the problem with our schools is the white parents that they shouldn‚Äôt be involved. 99% of our big cities R black led
No the only part of riots, looting and violence are in Democrats run states. You vote Biden and what Portland looks like now will be nothing. Enjoy Hell that your Soros paid government is giving you.
I wonder if Biden knows the difference between granite and marble?  They‚Äôre both ROCKS but similar.  According to Sleepy Joe most Americans can‚Äôt distinguish between the two.  And yes, Haley is a rock star!
‚Å¶ needs to change this.   Democrats‚Äô Judicial Selection Process Favors Corporate Lawyers and Prosecutors
If Biden is elected it will ONLY HAPPEN BECAUSE THE LEFT FRAUDULENTLY PUT HIM THERE ! Period ! He is a has been . Trump is already the winner but the left will do everything to RIG THE ELection . Mark my words !!!! Let‚Äôs do something about it !!!üá∫üá∏

Has Ben Shapiro declared his support for Biden yet?
People are terrified that if they display support for Biden then others will think they‚Äôre idiots.
Express that anger in November.  Don't let Biden positive polls lull you into complacency.  Don't let Bernie butt hurt keep you home.  Don't even think about Kanye.  Vote!do you really feel that Trump will not be reelected in Nov? I'm a little shocked by this.  I guess Cernovich wants to see a Biden White House. What a waste!
Mr Biden, you would be the next to worst president in history, Obama has the first spot.
you scoffed at this when Biden brought this up back in April. What say you now? Crickets! You don‚Äôt have the balls to stand up or act, no matter what he does.
Wrong! Biden's energy policy will bring thousands of jobs rebuilding our energy grid &amp; our infrastructure while decreasing global warming. You are just looking for more ways to line your own greedy pockets!
READ the post! It literally said and I quote "no boat parade for Biden".  See that last word? #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
That's why he's not staying in his basement. However, even if he did, he would still win bc trump sends Biden higher in the polls every time trump opens his mouth, mainly because he is such a liar. hahahahahahah #TrumpIsALoser
Barr is an ass. This has nothing to do with Biden! He‚Äôs just made it obvious that everything that is taking place is about getting Trump re-elected...
Idaho will definitely go trump but many republicans are disgusted with him. Not enough to make a difference but I am going to cast my vote for Biden anyway.

Donald Trump wants to delay the election because watching Joe Biden campaign is hilarious stuff and he doesn't want it to end.
When Joe Biden says he's "in the hood" he doesn't mean the one with neighbors.
I‚Äôve got a conservative doing it to me because I suggested that there were plenty of issues to pick with Joe Biden‚Äôs capabilities and policies and that we didn‚Äôt need to spread misleading videos. Informed me that saying this proved I had no brains.
Attempting to explain how Joe Biden‚Äôs mind work is not within my area of expertise.... not gonna even touch it.
I don‚Äôt even like Biden. But I will support upholding and defending the Constitution regardless. (FTR, I despise Trump, too.)
Then will come  those who remember their oath to defend the Constitution over some trespasser in the White House. The troops may or may not agree with Biden, but the Constitution says what it says. And Biden‚Äôs a Gold Star dad. They‚Äôll respect his family‚Äôs sacrifice.
The real Republicans will be voting Biden. Biden is closer to being Republican than Trump is.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Yep, I'll agree that Biden's health concerns me.  But in the same vein of 2016, I'm simply hoping that other members of his administration will help shore up his weaknesses and pitfalls in a sense.
I don't know what four years of Biden would look like (at least not precisely).  In 2024, if we are at a point in saying Biden was an obvious mistake, then I'll gladly flip to voting for a respectable Republican president.  I'm just tired of hearing Trump voters say
"Trump has done an acceptable job and deserves another four years".  It's not even about supporting Biden to me; he wasn't even a top 3 candidate of mine in the primaries.  It's simply about change.  Change in that I know what another four years of Trump can look like.
But honestly the war with the communist sphere of influence and even isis is far from over and we all know electing Joe Biden is pretty far from the solution but in order to make this outcome make sense I'm going to have to be pretty anti Trump along with the rest
Not only that, but could end up being the next POTUS given Biden's failing health.  Anyone feel ill yet?
Biden represents nothing but corporate interests and donors. Also a candidate who doesn‚Äôt even want to pass a law that a majority of the country wants doesn‚Äôt deserve my vote no legal weed, no Medicare for all, no green new deal, no universal college. It‚Äôs a disgrace really.
Maybe because weed is disproportionately used to target POC and I‚Äôm assuming your white. Blacks and whites smoke at the same rate, yet black people are 4x more likely to go to jail. Biden won‚Äôt fix that because he‚Äôs a republican playing as a Democrat.
Choice between Biden and Trump.  So what you're saying, it's a choice between Florida in the next few decades being under 2 inches of water, as opposed to 3 inches of water.  Can that even be called a 'choice' ?
Let's make America Great Again by voting Biden!!!! #Biden2020Landslide
No worries.  Bernie said Biden will fix it.  So vote for Biden!
Lol it makes me wonder which candidate is actually going to eat shit at the election probably Biden
Bernie Sanders now is supporting Joe Biden at the top of his lungs.  Joe Biden announced recently that he would veto any bill for #MedicareForAll.    Bernie Sanders is a sell-out.  If you vote for the democratic party, you are a political chump.
Yes! I showed him things outside of Fox News. Now he doesn't support Trump, but now I have to work on him to vote for Biden. He rather vote independent at this point. I still have work to do!!!
Sickening. Biden will tear it down
If this isn't the America you want then vote Biden!!! #DictatorTrump NEEDS TO GO!!!!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
If the election wasn't so important I would, but I won't waste my vote. Voting Biden

When Trump loses to Biden, &amp; it's beginning to look that way becuz he's bungled this COVID-19 crisis badly.  Americans will be trading in one corporate despot with a lesser more benign corporate despot.
Can Biden actually put 5 words together cogently ?
I‚Äôm a cool zoomer tho üò§üò§üò§üò§. Now I do live in Idaho which they think joe Biden is a commie here but most other people from school are racist and tWo GeNdeRs oNlY and it does not bring hope to me for this generation. There are literally white supremacy groups at my school ü§¢.
I don‚Äôt hear Biden bragging about remembering five words.
Agreed, I don't see a plausible path to a Democratic majority where they don't beat Tillis.  I'm curious about Ohio. If Biden wins the election but loses Ohio (which is a pretty plausible outcome) this could be the last election where we even talk about it as a swing state.

Then again, if the end game is to actually imprison Trump, letting his serve out his term only to let the SDNY slap cuffs on him after Biden‚Äôs inauguration might be the way to go.

Even Joe Biden needs him to retire.
This is another reason this has to happen after Biden is nominated although a completely open Democrat convention where Bernie lays claim to the nomination would make for great TV.
Let‚Äôs see Biden go to Texas!
What I've been saying for months the that Biden will withdraw from the race immediately after he is nominated. At that point, under DNC rules, the DNC (about 700 people) will replace him with whomever they want. I'm guessing Harris at this point.
Actually,  if Biden cannot run after he formally accepts the nomination,  the DNC could replace him with Kamala or anyone else at that point.
Once Biden is formally nominated,  the Democrat National Committee can replace him as nominee with anyone they want should he be unable to run.

Re your editorial "Putin Needs A Trump Victory:" Well China needs a Biden victory and China is a MUCH GREATER threat! Also not true that Trump is Putin's fervent admirer. He's tough on Russia &amp; China and puts America's interests 1st. So what is not to like about that?
I fucking hate Joe Biden. And democrats that actually think he'll move left, when they keep stopping any progress.
Biden doesn't even support M4A, during a pandemic, and people think he's going to change his mind later??? We've been seeing for years the need for it, what else has to happen for it to actually be implemented?
Not supporting Biden or 'working for him' in no way means they're working for trump, what an empty argument. And what makes you think Biden would actually support Medicare for All or anything that would make the country better?
And since the teachers unions wants to shut schools,when they endorse Joe Biden it will be the kiss of death for his candidacy.
Lol I thought the same thing accept Obama being Vice President for Biden!
Biden doesn‚Äôt know what state he‚Äôs in or what year it is. Democrats should be ashamed of this choice and will give Trump 400 electoral college delegates. Klobucher would have whipped his ass. Biden/Harris will be soundly beaten. The polls won‚Äôt capture the truth
Clearly, Biden will refuse to debate,  because he is almost 80 years old and probably incapable of playing a game of Chutes and Ladders with my 3 year old grandson. The Democrats don‚Äôt care.  He would just be the Bobblehead in the Backseat of of the Presidential Limo.
Hahahaha man I will never understand how completely ignorant people are . Biden can‚Äôt even wipe his own ass. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
Do you think Biden‚Äôs EC margin will be greater than Reagan‚Äôs 1980 thrashing of Carter?
Running Joe Biden is a form of elder abuse. Do liberals have any self respect. This is a medical issue and they are acting like all is OK. Go back and watch Being There and watch how they treated Chance the Gardner.
If you want to prove to yourself that google and the media are manipulating us do the following: Google ‚Äú Biden incoherent again today‚Äù. Since Biden today held 2 different public events today and failed on when or where it‚Äôs appropriate. See what you get.
Biden was incoherent today. A new poll has Trump getting 41% of the Latino vote. If he picks Kamala, he will lose the black male vote who hate her. The threatened school shutdown and city violence will hurt Biden. Trump does not deserve re-election but he will get 400 delegates.
Biden didn‚Äôt know what year it was yesterday.
I so hope that Stuart Varney is right!  The American people have to be smarter than voting for that burnt out bulb, Joe Biden.  It would be like hiring a child molester to take care of your children.
You're just as ridiculous as he is üòÇ Biden and Trump aren't much different, and recognizing the similarities between them will help you out
Good old liberals being wrong as usual. I didn't know socialists were willing to sacrifice minorities, I thought thats what democrats and republicans were doing by supporting Biden and Trump.
Uh no, like I was telling him, nice try  No one said Biden is worse, but liberals refusing to accept that Biden helped build what trump is doing, and other democrats helping trump, it's ludicrous to think that voting for what helped give us Trump, would fix what he's done.
I can't believe people still think #Biden is good when he won't even support that
Or like Biden supporters?
Yeah, and Biden helped trump, Biden and Obama in office helped pave the way for trump and for what Trump has been able to do, yes, Biden and Obama both helped
But I love how you purposefully missed the point because you don't want to actually accept the fact that Biden is why we have trump, and why Trump's been able to do what he has
Yes I'm so condescending with speaking the truth. If you actually paid attention to rose Twitter, your actually know what they're thinking. Biden paved the way for trump to do what he's been doing, democrats in office have helped trump do what he's doing. Stop fooling yourself.
But Biden paved the way for trump to do that, you cannot fix the issues with the person that propped up the system that allowed the injustices to happen.
Oh bless your heart again. Biden set it up for trump to do that, Biden and Obama killed black and brown people  If you actually paid attention to what rose Twitter was saying, you'd actually understand that Trump killing minorities is a big issue
Liberals, man, so ridiculous. I'm still waiting to find out how Bernie is racist but biden isn't. Oh, this dude thinks the Khive is good.
No one is pretending anything, voting for either trump or Biden isn't a vote for progress.
'whatever your problem is, let it go' maybe the problem is just eating the shit sandwich given to us by the DNC, and people maybe don't want to keep eating it, when there are other options. If people don't vote for Biden, or Trump, neither earned it, and it's on them
Your tweet was literally just that. Biden needs to earn the votes he gets, you trying to guilt or shame people into voting for him, won't get people to vote for him
No politician is entitled to my vote  If biden wants me to vote for him, he needs to earn it
#VoteBlueNoMatterWho #Biden democrats are really shooting themselves in the foot with this one.
If Trump gives in on mail in voting, it‚Äôs fair to say that he will use this as exit strategy post election. He will threaten to fight result bc of mail in voting fraud but then will make a deal with Biden/gang of 8 to walk away for guarantee pardon by Pence in lame duck session.
You are full of crap. The demented is right in your face. My 6 year old grandson can pass the test with 100%. Biden is Brilliant compared to you!
Biden will look beyond and say ‚Äú we need healing not revenge so all‚Äôs good ‚Äú. Centrists suck ass!
I‚Äôll wait for Biden‚Äôs Vaccine
That‚Äôs his vaccine. I‚Äôll wait for Biden‚Äôs
Lol. We‚Äôre u on mars watching it.  He aced that interview and kept his cool.  Wallace asked some tough questions that Biden couldn‚Äôt even dream of
I think essentially calling Biden a racist was substantially different than voodoo economics.  Questioning Biden‚Äôs morality and character versus highlighting policy differences.
I am Joe Biden running for umm umm you know what that thing is!!!
Joe Biden is corrupt and always will be
Joe Biden and Obama, ‚ÄúWinchester‚Äù  The radical left Democrats, we‚Äôre coming for you and they will own you!!!
Joe Biden and the radical left Democrats, are lying to the Suburban Voters,  they will take away your dream, for living in the suburbs, and do away with single family homes, people better do the research before they vote!!!
Joe Biden, and radical left government, will take all your rights and freedom Away
Only Uncle Joe Biden knows what a Voter Registration Physician is.  They probably blow air into his nostrils....Hot air!
Biden is completely incapable of doing an in depth interview with anyone.  If he cannot keep up with an interview, how could he possibly lead our country.  Wake me up.  This is a nightmare!
#PelosiVirus #BIDEN remain silent,shame on them
Man, this is getting nasty! And you know George Soros is working with the Muslim Brotherhood. They want America destroyed. They will vote for Biden because as we know  Biden is nothing but worthless at best and will be dancing by the puppeteer.
I saw this retweet and immediately thought biden
Lol! You know this is actually going to happen and it‚Äôs been the plan all along?  I would love worthy black female candidate. However anyone willing to back Biden and what he represents would be a disgrace.
And Biden has an island right next to Epstein‚Äôs.ü§î
Mmmmkay. I've seen Biden, Trump, Warren etc supporters say something against it. I follow so many accounts with a rose in it, but couldn't figure out what was so bad about it.
Ah, the condescending attitude of the elderly. There isn't much of a difference between Trump and Biden, and Biden helped build the system that gave us Trump. Wouldn't it be great if politicians actually earned our votes, though? Whoever does win in November, it won't be us.
I read a statistic today. Did you know that 100% of black people that don't vote for Joe Biden, aren't black?
Well I think their plan is; to defund the police with the hope that Biden gets elected and then they‚Äôll get their version of the SS
Would like to remind everyone that this war in the US that Trump started is not over. Democrats could loose but unlikely. Biden has a 15% lead on Trump. People are tired of Trump's lie after lie and his temper tantrums. In the long run this will hurt Trump more.
I‚Äôll bet anyone $100 that Biden will not debate Trump live in anyway shape or form! Anybody?$$$ if he did it would expose his mental problems.
Come on Biden I dare you to debate Trump
I‚Äôve done a ton of dementia screens. Both Biden and Trump should have a dementia work-up that includes MRI and a standardized mental status exam. The results should be released to the public and done at the same academic center.
He's also going to defeat Joe Biden.
Biden is merely a puppet for the Liberal Fascist Left.  He is currently incapable of independent thought and is descending in a spiral of no return.  And yet he appears to be the only figurehead they can come up with.
