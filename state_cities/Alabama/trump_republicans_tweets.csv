Where oh where is the trump lap dog lie repeatedly coronavirus czar Pence. And what the hell is he doing?
It's called Trump invited me to a stupid Coronavirus pandemic no mask or social distancing Tulsa rally and I took my dummy preexisting condition ass there and signed a waiver to exonerate him of all responsibility
sounds like John Lewis wasn‚Äôt important enough to mention today. Just another All About You campaigning, taking shots at Trump and trying to prop up your demented VP. From the clapping , looks like mist peopke there didn‚Äôt care about Lewis either. Disgraceful
Trump offers to pay for funeral of slain soldier Vanessa Guillen.  One thing for sure, Biden, Obama and Hillary would never use Their üí∞to pay for a soldier‚Äôs funeral. But they sure could stand in front of Bengahzi coffins to lie

Herman said it's thundering and lightning outside. Trump said I only heard thunder run outside and stand under that tree. Herman says I have a preexisting condition. Trump says walk outside and stand under that tree.

President Trump Throws Out Idea of Delaying November Presidential Election
Now Trump wants us to guess when it will be election day!
50 are reporters, 90 are campaign handlers, 20 are Trump campaign members and the rest are well......

Remember when the WH Press Secy was asked if Trump‚Äôs tweets are policy? The answer was yes, they are. 1. At that point all R Sens were reqd to read his tweets as he leads their party. 2. They should have put a stop to him. 3. If they don‚Äôt stop him now, they are equally as guilty
#SOUNDOFF President Trump has asked on Twitter whether the Nov. 3 election should be delayed until people can safely vote. Do you think the election should be postponed? Tell us.
Let‚Äôs make this one clear: Only Congress has the authority. NOT President Trump.
This is a thread about how presidents and vice presidents are chosen and how Trump's declaration that a vote be delayed is unlikely to get him what he wants. 1/N

More has been brought out into plain view, about the evil inner workings of the "Aristocracy of Pull", since Trump took office; than ever before in history. Planned or coincidence? Plans take the random out of coincidence.
Herman Cain was at the Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Herman Cain was there with no mask.  Herman Cain tested positive for coronavirus. Herman Cain died from coronavirus.
This morning, Trump tweeted: ‚ÄúWith Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT Election in history.‚Äù
They're not attacking Trump here, but they did make a point to note he was "not wearing a mask and not social distancing." I'm so sick of Alabama news media.

I keep saying Trump is a dangerous man. When Trump talks about delaying the election, he is testing to see how far he can go. Trump is going to see if he can bypass an election and stay in office. America never say never, we are heading toward a war here in America.
He'll play the "COVID Card"  It's like the "Race Card" only more effective  It will render the "Trump Card" impotent
The danger is Trump
A reminder:  1. The Pres. falsely claimed millions of illegal votes were cast in 2016.  2. He personally set up a commission to uncover the truth. 3. His commission disbanded when it could find no evidence of voter fraud.   Those are the facts.
seriously do you really care about the military? Then why aren‚Äôt you upset about the bounties being placed on our military? Trump is literally doing everything Putin wants yet no one in the repugnant party has the balls to stand up to Trump but Romney. STFU
He jumped the gun. It appears as if some in the Alabama GOP and most of his church still like the quiet parts to be quiet. Trump is the only one who gets to say the quiet parts loud.
Sen. Jones is pro-mom and working to end the maternal death crisis in Alabama, especially for Black moms, who die at tragically high rates.   Does Tubs know this is a problem? Hard to say since his only sentences are a noun, a verb, and praise for Trump.

It will continue snowballing and will gain further momentum. It will vindicate the tactics that were used to destroy Trump and the GOP. There will be no dialing it back once the Democrats are back in charge. They won't be able control their own supporters
Assuming the Left captures total control of the government in November and the GOP is wiped out and Trump is defeated, it will stop, right? Things will calm back down to the placid Obama years. Nope
Because Dr. Fauci WAS invited. Remember when he stopped him from coming to briefings for a few days, until the press started asking questions? He stopped him, be again, he was getting all of the attention. Trump can‚Äôt stand it

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd use the word waste.  But I think we need to be very clear about how important it is to defeat Trump.  Biden was not my first nor tenth pick.  But he was first pick for many and it is extremely important that Trump does not remain in office.

In the last presidential election I promoted that SCOTUS was reason enough to vote for Trump. That is turning out to be an empty idea.
Ummm. Yeahhh. I‚Äôm with you on most things  but any yayhoo that‚Äôs adding a Q to their tag is not going to present a challenge in being identified as a Trump supporter in spite of the Q.

Hear it? We‚Äôre living it. I am not an Obama fan. Never have been, but the woke racist has gotten worst under tRump‚Äôs watch. He‚Äôs allowing it to happen. He encouraged the police to use more force. We can‚Äôt let any of them no matter their color to get away with this.
I‚Äôm not looking for a white savior. Never will. Not even white Jesus, but tRump in office, the state this country is in, to sit back &amp; keep him there, is giving ammunition to our enemies. It‚Äôs my opinion do what works for you, but to knowingly allow a man that paints the targe
I‚Äôm not saying Biden is a prefect fix. I‚Äôm not saying Biden will be the savior to black ppl bc he is NOT! We have to save ourselves, but allowing tRump to stay in off is not an option for ME. We already know what he‚Äôs capable of, his winning will only incite his base to do more.
I agree with you, but having alliances prevents war, control rivals, control allies, enable balance, stops other allies from joining others, etc...trump can't keep pissing on our allies because we need them! What if there was a war?

Exactly, because  racist a$$ can go strategy to he!! HIS version is the REVISIONIST sanitized version and he doesn‚Äôt want the ACTUAL VERSION to be known. Trump did one good thing; he opened the closet door on the rest of the bigots in Congress
Apparently those type people, run rampant in republican circles. Mr. Trump just snatched the covers off of the rest of them!

Lol at people masturbating to Portnoy interviewing Trump. He‚Äôs a racist interviewing a racist. Non story.
If you‚Äôre trying to say that Trump hasn‚Äôt gone on record admitting that he‚Äôs racist, I guess you‚Äôre right. If you‚Äôre saying Trump doesn‚Äôt use racism to appeal to his supporters then you‚Äôre wrong. He‚Äôs been banging that drum since he called Mexicans criminals and rapists in 2015.

Yeah, I don't know what I'm going to do election time yet.  I know it won't be Trump, but between his alleged assault cases and how poorly he handled that, his rewriting of history, and his poor voting record, I don't know if voting for Biden is ethical either.
Thank GOD tha President Trump whose Swift and decisive action saved 2.26 million of the 2.4 million Americans that were predicted to die from this pandemic
Obama has class while Trump is classless.
You have spat on your so called dearest friends memory by playing sycophant and yes man to Trump while we all know that you know better, don‚Äôt pretend his memory matters to you, power is all that matters to you. McCain as are the rest of us, are SMDH!!!

Sure they do, but is laughable to think that Trump treats it as a front and center issue. That also doesn‚Äôt address that he failed to mention that the opioid crisis hits communities of color just as hard, if not harder, than rural white communities

It will never happen, but he has been harassed in every way possible before the time he took office.  I find it so hard to believe that it is possible for democrats to get mail-in votes for this upcoming election. Look at all of the deceipt that was done before Trump took office.

If Fox is out here yelling this shit, most of the base goes along with it for a while. Many probably goto their graves thinking Trump was robbed of reelection by mail in voting and/or non-citizens voting
But unless they clean house at Fox to rid themselves of the Trump stench, Hannity Dobbs, Ingraham and company will claim the election was rigged. Most of their careers are more-less all in on Trump. Any transition into a saner post-Trump era won‚Äôt be quick or seamless
But Trump gets kudos from his supporters: White supremacists, MAGAs, evangelicals, rich white folks, the GOP (or at least those who support him), the KKK and all those 'good people' that he's so proud of!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

If Trump can delay the election in *any* way, he will do so. If there's any means in which he can circumvent the Constitution or the Congress, he will do that. Don't think for a second that this idea is one that's going nowhere.  His people are already looking. #Election2020
Wow trump really did ask for a delay of the election. Well there it is folks.
'Constitutionally impossible': Experts say Trump can't postpone the November election
"If the results were clear..." Trump lost the 2016 election by 3.0M+ but won the EC. By Barr's standards, what would constitute a "clear" loss by Trump? 10M? 20M? Barr has the same problem with "clear' as  he did with "suggested" during his confirmation!

Wondering if Trump's new election date is in 2032 as it will take that long for us to get out of the hole that the GOP has created for our democracy? Q for Trump's donors: Will any of us be still alive when the new election date arrives? Or will you buy us a new banana republic?
Let this sink in a second: arguably the most prominent black Republican was *literally* killed by attending a Trump rally. If you tried to make this stuff up, people would just snort.
GOP will stand silent on Trump's delay of the election and thee GOP senate will probably endorse the change! Such is the depth of the hole that the GOP has fallen but on 11/3, the hole will be capped and they can have the misery that they created all to themselves!

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Wondering if AG Barr will step in to control the MAGA blow back in Michigan once this rule takes effect? Or will he ignore the confederate and swastika flags and armored  militias that will surely make their presence known? These are Trump's 'good people', so we know the answer!
He attended Trump's Tulsa rally and proudly didn't wear a mask. Paying with your life in order to show allegiance to a reality star conman... what a way to go. RIP.

#Trump explicitly floated delaying November's presidential election on Thursday, lending extraordinary voice to persistent concerns that he would seek to circumvent voting in a contest where he currently trails his  by double digits. GTFOH
So you know there will be cheating ie LA county has 125% of its population on voter registration which is a million people. You will be screaming Trump cheated if he wins but if Biden wins it will just be a conspiracy that there was fraud. The only audit will be if Trump wins.
What convicted friend did Trump pardon?  Manafort is still imprisoned for crimes having nothing to do with Trump, Stone granted clemency (not pardon, still has a felony record), Flynn was railroaded so the DOJ dropped charges (not convicted of anything).  Your TDS is severe...
I cannot wait to vote Donald Trump out of office.
I mean look at all the arrests this year for voter fraud. Everyone screamed Russia interference in the last election with no proof and now they are cool with it when there is literal proof it is happening. If there was mail in voting and Trump won the country would say fraud.

Trump fabricated his invitation to throw out the first pitch for the Yankees? Out of jealousy of Dr. Fauci? He's a sick, pathetic man.
trump needs to deliberately expose himself, get Covid, then try all the ‚Äúcures‚Äù he espouses. Hydroxy, bleach, heat lamps, give ‚Äòem all a shot. See what works. Or doesn‚Äôt. Lead by example.
It‚Äôs funny how  is basically doing the same thing as Trump and going so far as to punish these ‚Äúscoundrels‚Äù as federalis are literally kidnapping civilians. No difference between Biden and Trump.

Trump says doctor who speaks of using alien dna for treatment, is "important voice that we should listen to". Called my doctor and asked about getting that alien DNA treatment and he hung up on me.
What‚Äôs amazing about Trump is how he comes across as a true pathological liar and also he‚Äôll have these moments of being incredibly candid. Like when he said ‚ÄúHeathcare is hard. Who knew?!‚Äù
I'd rather have no deal at all and lay it at the feet of the Republicans and Trump if I'm the Democrats than cuck and have a shitty deal that causes more harm than good.  The country will blame the Republicans if nothing gets done. There's no reason to cave.
To be Devil‚Äôs advocate, Trump wants any type of relief on an issue he has had none. The longer this goes, the more people effected, it looks bad on him. Is it fair? Not really, but when you are sitting President you get things put on you.

President Trump speaks at White House
Even if you don't like  This is a sorry excuse for representation by Democrats. This wasn't an investigation. This was grandstanding. They didn't care about Barr's answers. They were busy making statements with many just lying. Spinning for answers.
Stupidity is in the trump gene pool
Yes, the comment about Trump forcing people into nursing homes was complete sarcasm to the original poster.
The Nigerian lady apparently believes lizard people run the world.
Meanwhile, why America is distracted with his hearing, so far today we've lost another 696 Americans to #COVID19 bringing the total of dead up to 151,770.  It didn't have to be this way. Donald Trump and the Republican party have to answer for all of the fallen in November.
Hey, so Trump ordered the positive into nursing homes...  Imagine being this disconnected.
In other words, no one should have sex with Trump.
Colluding with another country is a big deal . Protecting our enemies is a big deal !! Why did the Trump administration promise to lift sanctions unilaterally before bri g sworn in? Why did Congress pass a law that prevented the president from unilaterally lifting restrictions??

Trump wouldn‚Äôt have that authority though

If someone is either not on FB, or possibly on FB but has mostly liberal friends, I can see how it can be hard to fully understand just how much people in Republican areas of the country want Trump to be right about hydroxychloroquine.
Trump 2020
So Twitter partially suspends Donald Trump Jr.'s account yet they have no problem with letting his father lie and spread conspiracy theories (almost) unimpeded.  This is called not having the balls to do the right thing. What's he gonna do if you ban him? Tweet about it?
I‚Äôm talking bout Trump. Stop letting politics get in the way of what‚Äôs right. I‚Äôll have to do research on Biden cases if he have any. But just Bc y‚Äôall connect with Trump and love him doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not a convict who has done terrible dark activities. It‚Äôs disgusting.
Maybe Trump's new doctor is a video porn addict? Just saying...
I‚Äôm glad you brought that up. The case with Ghislaine Maxwell is a HUGE political case. It‚Äôs dirt on both sides. Democrats and Republicans. However the case goes is however the voting turnout goes. Ask Trump and Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton how Epstein island was.Ask both sides
The polls which show single digit races in states like PA, FL, MI, WI and AZ prove this: Despite Trump‚Äôs horrific handling of the pandemic, there are voters who are willing to overlook it (and even support his handling) and once again, the Berners who still push their populist
This is the video that Trump Jr. was put on Twitter lockdown for. Why? What is Twitter afraid of? Why can‚Äôt what these doctors have to say be heard?
Trump just threw the country and his MAGAs the finger saying 'Get over it!' in the process! Is a Voodoo doctor next? Or is St. John the Baptist?

Needs to make money to pay lawyers. Won't get it from us even if it contains steamy encounters with Page. Spin books. Maybe it will help get him charged &amp; jailed.
I wonder whether anyone has tried to convince Trump that graciousness is seen as powerful, especially when it's expressed toward a fallen rival. If I was his advisor, that'd be the approach I'd take. His pettiness toward Lewis (and McCain earlier) is not helping his image at all.
Then how in hell is Trump still on Twitter???????
Thinking that there is so much more to criticize/condemn  than just his narcissism to report. A few, CNN in particular, do not seem intimidated by Trump / GOP. Now FOX, excpt for Chris Wallace, is the only one that outright supports Trump and labels his narcissism as pure genius!
A week after appearing to project a more serious tone about the coronavirus, President Trump is back to pushing an unproven anti-malaria drug as an effective treatment and challenging the credibility of the nation's leading infectious disease expert.
Trump thru Cuchinelli have declared war on American veterans and have tried to take away their 1st and 4th A rights? AND AMERICA SAYS NOTHING! Is this what they risked their lives for in standing up for Americans? The entire country should be fuming! Including MAGAs!

TLP: Trump / GOP have demonstrated an extreme affinity for inflicting pain on as many people as possible, including themselves when one strays from the fold! Is this pain a trait exhibited by the former GOP, before Trump? It seems wholly out of control in 2020.
Trump didn't say anything about protesters, he said antifa which you admitted above engage in opportunistic rioting, violence, looting and burning. So how exactly  are they trying to fool middle America? Everyone with eyes and a brain have been watching it on tv can see it.
#RandyLevine is a great friend of mine from the Yankees  told reporters as #Fauci was preparing to take the mound. #LiarTrump says they asked him to throw out the first pitch, and I think I‚Äôm doing that on Aug. 15 at Yankee Stadium. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Right, she specifically said she was working on turning out voters agaisnt Trump and she didn‚Äôt need to endorse Biden to do that
The progressive vote is not gonna be largely convinced that Biden is a good candidate, we already think he‚Äôs bad, but what can flip progressives is that trump is worse- that‚Äôs a strategy that she can do and that she‚Äôs decided is most helpful in stopping Trump.
She‚Äôs working to turn out voters in November for him, which is way more important than an endorsement. She‚Äôs targeting people who don‚Äôt like Biden already so she‚Äôs focusing on ‚ÄúYes he‚Äôs not perfect but trump is worse so hold your nose and vote for him with me‚Äù
She‚Äôs focusing on turning our her constituents to vote against Trump; if anything she cares far more about beating Trump than ideological purity because she‚Äôs still working to elect Biden despite their policy differences
She is anti Trump and is focusing on her primary. I take it majority of her supporters/constituents are not big favorites of Biden but don‚Äôt want Trump. Predict she will endorse after primary.

Asked if he plans to pay his respects to Rep. John Lewis at the Capitol, Trump responded: "No, I won't be going. No."
When Trump dies, I'm confident that Obama will attend his funeral and pay his respects. He'll probably even come up with some nice things to say about him. Because Obama's a class act and Trump is just trash at every level.
In 2016 I voted for Trump as the lesser of 2 evils. In 2020 I‚Äôm voting for Trump because if Democrats win America is over.
This move by Trump will endear himself to his MAGAs and evangelicals who support him! Not so sure that the GOP senators up for re-election will be so happy to hear the news! Trump needs to get on McConnell for say a few words of respect for Lewis as he lies in state!

Ron, Donald Trump is a racist. Full stop. That's why he has no interest in doing anything personal to honor John Lewis. I'm not saying that not being there is PROOF of his racism. Instead, it is the result of his long-evident racism.
If anybody had paid attention to Trump's re-election campaign, his paying more attention to republican-run states is the most obvious step he can take! But it may be too little, too late! As COVID-19 continues to spread, Trump's support for GOP states will not stop it!
Does that plan include bringing Trump families manufacturing to the USA and relinquishing Chinese patents?
Just guessing that the KKK is trying to let Trump know that they still are there to promote his racist views and actions! Surprised that they don't have flags with swastikas flying in full view for their fellow Arkansans to relish and throw the finger at the rest of us!

Trump and the faux-radicals in much of the MSM share a tactic here. Both obliterate the distinction between "protesters" and "rioters." The former to depict all as illegitimate, the latter as peaceful and legitimate. Don't fall for either oversimplfication.

For those GOP members that kisses up to Trump's ass and those MAGA idiots better never say that the COVID-19 is hoax again. You wanna keep believing that then tell all those people that has already died from it maybe there ghost will tell you how ignorant you are! #DyingforTrump
Uniting citizens to vote against Trump isn't election fraud.
What an incredibly stupid statement. Trump's been around for four years and you think he started this? How dumb.
Trump's desperation keeps showing more and more everyday. He can't delay the election because Congress &amp; the Constitution would be up all over his ass if he does and if their is no election by then Pelosi takes over automatically by January 20th regardless. Trump is desperate.
I don‚Äôt understand why conservatives love Trump, he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about you, it‚Äôs all for himself and his ego, it‚Äôs not about you and your needs
BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
First Trump wants to delay the election because he's thinks mail-in voting gonna rigged his election then one of his supporters just died due to the Coronavirus in that Tulsa event and all he's doing a tweeting about Pizza? Seriously,We have a derange man-child as president.
Can‚Äôt wait for a bunch of people freaking out when a kid puts Trump 2020 on his uni.
Today is the day Donald Trump became President.
President Trump: Coronavirus is not that serious. Children should go back  to school  Also President Trump: Coronavirus is so dangerous that we should postpone the election
remember when you said that Biden's accusation that Trump would try to delay the election was  "Over the line" and Biden "should know better"?
I know Trump not talking about delaying the election, if this man don‚Äôt be quiet
Lawmakers torch Trump plan to pull 11,900 troops from Germany
Trump is another jim Jones preached all that üí© while leading all those Americans to their deaths even Herman cain! Trump calls himself the chosen one well we call him the grime reaper cause every where he goes death follows! You, Trump and the republicans are liars for death!
Kids can go to school but I can‚Äôt vote? This move is showing how truly scared you are to lose.   (Just FYI everyone Trump cannot delay the election, it is written into the constitution that Congress has the authority to change the day of the election not the President)
He knew this pandemic was real but he listen to Trump and go his just deserve! Besides he talk all that crap about president Obama so I don't feel sorry for him! He believed in Trump and Trump didn't even say anything good about him! Maybe because he was black and didn't care!
Donald Trump trying to change the election date is like Gus Malzahn knowing the only way Auburn could win the Iron Bowl was to add an extra second to the clock
I expected people to get sick after the Trump rally, but did not anticipate Herman Cain dying.
I think #Biden &amp; #Pelosi both want #Trump‚Äôs head on a pike. And he knows it, too. So don‚Äôt look for him to resign. ‚ÄúPeaceful Transition of Power‚Äù is the only card he has left. It‚Äôs too late to play it. But he‚Äôs desperate and has no other options. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Living in Bama, I have a lot of #Conservative friends. And while they‚Äôre still telling me Trump‚Äôs gonna win, etc etc, they‚Äôre also suddenly buying scrubbed assault rifle components w/o serial numbers so they build untraceable guns. They know what‚Äôs coming. #BlueWave2020
As  has observed, Trump‚Äôs main business ‚Äúskill‚Äù his entire life has been a constant, desperate, bid the buy just a little more time &amp; keep his creditors off his back. This is no different.
MSM either gigantically ignorant of basic math or maliciously lying to make Trump look worse.   I think we know which it is.
really starting to think this ‚Äútrump‚Äù guy is up to no good!
Alabama ( Roll Tide). In the past I always voted for the person. In 2016 I voted AGAINST Hillary. Not because she was a woman.  She didn‚Äôt have a moral center. Then there was the embassy attack, concluded with ignoring Bills many dalliances so she could be in line. Trump 2020

So according to   Trump's average approval rating for foreign policy (40%) is slightly above the average of polls' taken during Obama second term (39%) [and George W. Bush's 2nd term average was 38%, and never above that after mid 2006]
Trump backed militia‚Äôs presence was academic. If they needed to be there in the first place they would have stayed. Allowing the legality excuses gives away your Constitutionional Rights.

The one good political opinion I have had in my life is that I have been shouting into the void since 2016 that Trump's true base is White People with Boats
You‚Äôre another one of those folks that everytime Trump tweets your all over it.. get. A. Life.
So, the cases and death rate starting to plateau starting on the day Trump ordered hospitals to start sending numbers to HHS instead of the CDC does NOT support the argument that the pandemic is nothing to worry about.  Compare the number trend in new cases in red states vs blue.
1.) It‚Äôs amazing how easy it is to make Trump look bad in interviews  2.) Love the small hands shot

Trump is NOT perfect but at least he recognized the Day of Prayer and has prayed "publicly" more than any of the last several Presidents combined.

I watched Netflix "Fear City" last night. NYC real estate &amp; 80s building boom was discussed in Ep.3 &amp; I wondered if trump would be mentioned (only a 10-sec vintage clip.) I was also wondering if &amp; how much the mob demanded from djt for TT constr.  That info was noticeably absent.

Trump, Kushner, and their cronies took a single study that said it would be an effective treatment for the Rona as gospel truth and invested heavily in it, and now they're taking a *serious* bath because turns out investing based on the first study out the gate is a BAD idea.
I hope your organization and others like yours are making plans to defend against the Trumpster efforts to STEAL the election. Every org that can, needs to be ready for some sorts of legal defense to the unlawful acts by Trump and Trumpsters to steal election.
Yes! What are we going to do when Barr assists Trump in Trump's determination to steal the election?

I rather hear it from a real doctor than a doctor that could be on Trump's payroll to prove it.
Why everyone wouldn't be surprised if that doctor that believes in Alien DNA &amp; Demon Sperm is another Trump stooge under his propaganda payroll. Pushing that #Hydroxychloroquine works seems like another desperate move out of the Trump playbook. #TrumpPressConference

Trump has no integrity. Trump‚Äôs example is: rules can be corrupted, disregarded, trashed. Trump as ‚Äòleader‚Äô trashes the order of law.  Trump wants respect. Respect is garnered from integrity. Respect of Trump is that of a rabid dog.  - not respect.
Trump's AG stooge Barr is getting his ass grilled and rattled.   The GOP side is not helping his case especially they are doing Trump's bidding! #BarrHearing

2. In a rare united front, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have all pulled a video from their platforms that promoted false cures and disinformation about the Coronavirus. The video was shared by President Trump on Twitter last night.

Trump takes on the lawlessness in our cities.:
Trump sticks to his hydroxychloroquine pitch even though it has been proven to be ineffective against COVID-19.  via
Trump is actually inciting the far-Right and radical-Left.
Trump has stolen all the GOP election fund, you are on you on Kevin bootlicker.
Trump is antisocial.
Trump lacks integrity.
I hate y‚Äôall. Dem leaders are just as responsible for deaths due to their greed as Trump is for his sheer incompetence.
This is incredible! Sadly, it‚Äôs not surprising, as we KNOW there are many in the US who would rather see Americans die, lose their jobs/businesses, suffer from depression/substance abuse/suicide, miss school/sports/church &amp; live in fear as long as Trump gets run out of office.
I hate Joe Biden SO much but I will be voting for him (reluctantly). Because I HATE Donald Trump even more.
The more Trump whines and complains the more we get hashtags like #ThePresidentIsACrybaby because he's acting like one.
If Trump considered 40 young, what do you think he thought of the teenagers he bragged about ogling in pageant dressing rooms?
Ima be old man talking to my grandkids about 2020. All the racists shit, only fans, Donald Trump ass....Man just every fucking thing.
Hey Mr. "I can't see reality", here's an idea keep defunding police.  Trump has offered to send military control but met with opposition. He should just refuse money when they beg for it to cleanup and rebuild everything destroyed. #NoClue
Until President Trump is re elected!
Please please PLEASE enlighten me about what Trump has fixed instead of fucked up. BexUse that's the problem with you guys on the right. You think trump is some sort of Messiah instead of seeing him for the grifter he is.
Actually, Trump had his chance and blew it. There... I fixed it for you.
Trump has shown by his actions rules do not matter. This is his crap of leadership manifest.
Most drivers probably support Trump.
Please allow me to fix that for you, Senator Schumer. trump still doesn't have an adequate strategy about anything. Period. Full stop.
Of all the crimes and corruption Trump has committed he is the last person to speak about Twitter trends are "illegal" because they aren't nice to him. This is the same person that couldn't handle Alec Baldwin being him on a SNL sketch! Trump really hates the 1st Amendment.
Trump fucked up by letting us know that he checks the trending topics.
So silencing peaceful protesters by having your secret police use brutal force when they aren't fighting back isn't illegal but trends that you don't seems to like is? What a dumbass whining MF Trump is. Dictatorship &amp; Hypocrisy showing on Trump's forehead right now.
Once again the crybaby president is complaining about certain trends is "illegal" because they aren't nice to him. Are presidents suppose to suck it up to criticism but I guess it don't apply to Trump because he's not a president he's a whiny bitch ass dictator playing president!
No one can tell me that Trump hasn‚Äôt had covid. All of these people are around you, but you‚Äôre the only one who hasn‚Äôt gotten it....? Yeah, ok.

We are IN FACT going to stomp Trump in 100 days. About 10% and 375-165 EVs. We ARE going to do it with a center-left candidate &amp; ticket with the help of Lincoln Project, independents &amp; the massive votes from regular traditional Dems - the largest voting block in the USA.
When Trump wins again, all those anti Americans that want socialism should be shipped off to an island somewhere and treated like socialists. They should have no freedom at all. Maybe then they would wake up and realize how good they had it in America.
this is one of the most pathetically stupid tweets I've EVER read. Literally out of tens of thousands, this one cannot be topped for stupidity. Voting for an independent 3rd party instead of Biden helps Trump get re-elected - which would end our freedoms and nation as we know it.
This is an insult to the Sith Lords. They are far more clever than Trump ever could hope to be. Even with Ren's temper tantrums
Everything about Trump is fake, a scam, a con, a cheap construction, an "I'll do it in two weeks" dodge. His baby-brained cultists will never admit it, but even they know. #maga #kag #WWG1GWA #Trump2020
There is not a single person on this planet who believes you are sincere with this Tweet and would ever do anything to achieve the kind of society Rep Lewis worked his whole life toward. History will remember him long after you are a mere sad footnote in this #Trump disaster.

It is a curse that literally the only person good at making goofy nicknames in Washington is also Donald Trump
If you support Trump, you‚Äôre a racist
Literally every part of his tweet is amateurish. It does not even assert what he implies it does. The model probably builds in 25-30% chance it could be very close, with trump only winning a third of those. He would have to win WI, AZ, FL, NC, OH, GA, IA, TX. All of them
Many people are free from Mortal Sin unlike Trump, who does not repent either for such Mortal Sins.
The model does NOT assert that. But YOU asserted that Trump "absolutely" has a greater than 8% chance to come back. That is based on what? a notion and "2016". I"m not sure he even has an 8% chance of winning Florida, which he cannot win the election without. FL voters locked in
What is a disservice is for you to say "absolutely" there is a greater than 8% chance that trump could come back. You do not know that with anything approaching absolute certainty. Trump is not a failed incumbent. But you all refuse to accept that he is not still 2016 outsider
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.  #wtpBLUE
Yeah, we hear ALL the "but trump could win if" explanations a gazillion times. Do you really not know that every single media person feels compelled to point this out? ARe you not aware that we hear it every day?  2016 has nothing to do with this

An example of this is that there was a law passed to enable Amber alerts for older people after Aniah Blanchard went missing in Auburn last year. Trump never filled the position that was supposed to put this law into action so the AL state legislature had to pass another law.
Joe Biden is far from my first choice. However, Trump has either failed to fill positions or filled them with the worst people possible. At this point, people who know how to do their jobs would be a massive improvement.

I wonder how much dirt she and Epstein have on Trump.  Can't you see another pardon in the works.
Did Trump ask Putin about murdering our soldiers or interfering in our elections.  Or was this just a  I Love You and miss you call. Did Putin let Trump kiss his butt some more. Defeat Trump in November.  Voting Biden, he won't be kissing Putin butt.
Trump is so concerned about coronavirus and the economy that he has to spend the weekend playing golf at his private resort. Only the very rich and powerful are allowed to go there.  So America,  just get over it and die, because Trump doesn't care about you.

This may be the most laughable, least informed comment I have ever read. There is nothing normal about them. They go places regular Democrats have always been scared to go. The also anger trump and bait him into keeping up his unhinged behavior.
Do you know how dumb a comment that is. Are you even aware that ads and videos viewed on social media are now at least as impactful if not moreso than TV ads. Many millions of people see their videos. In 2016 Trump dominated digital online ads. Not so in 2020

Trump is on live Utube I love my Trumpy ‚ù§Ô∏è üíï üíó Speech time!!!
Trump &amp; the Republicans need to get off their lazy butts and pass this Hero's Act. They have wasted enough of America's time and money not doing the job we hired them to do.
You‚Äôre confused. It‚Äôs actually Congress that is paid and rarely works. Trump isn‚Äôt paid due to the fact that he donates his money back to America.
She can't remember all the Trump Lies that she has to tell. Thank goodness for her trusty little lie book to flip though.
I think it's funny the amount of money Trump is spending on tv campaign ads in Florida. Is anyone even watching network tv during the pandemic? My tv viewing is Netflix, Amazon &amp; Hulu. Thankful that I will miss those ads or lies from Trump. Voting Biden on November 3rd.
We need a President whose last name is not Trump.
UFO trending Said vehicle found and watch in October too Also President Trump Speaking on Utube live on Livestream Plz share
Seems like  doesn't want to hear from his constituents during this unmitigated disaster #Trump has brought upon us. No one answers the phones at his DC/Bama offices &amp; you get a 403 Error message if you try to send him an email thru his website. Can't say I'm surprised.

This is about the percentage I think the election numbers will reveal. I have the election at 52%Trump -47% Biden - 1% 3rd party candidate.  What‚Äôs your prediction?
what‚Äôs the most amount of money would you pay for donald trump to win the 2020 election?
I very much disagree, but you are entitled to your opinion. I hope Terrence doesn‚Äôt change. He has his beliefs also. I happen to support him and Pres. Trump. And I‚Äôm very happy he did not catch COVID.
More foolishness to come (from Trump). Since he's not interested in running the country, and never has been, he'll be dreaming up more and more disruption.
First 10 seconds of today‚Äôs presser, Trump calls COVID-19 the China Virus. Vote this man out.
It would be so nice if all the Trump haters would UNFOLLOW him!
If "Gimme three steps" was a Trump tweet
I desperately want Trump to (figuratively) die on this hill, stay until 1/20/21, get kicked out of office by the Constitution, have Nancy Pelosi become president by default, RBG retires immediately, and BAM - welcome new Associate Justice Barack Obama.
Are you talking about our President. President Trump is the elected president and leader of the United States of America. Therefore your tweet does not make sense. You must be a Democrat.
After denying the legitimacy of COVID-19 and attending a tRump rally in Oklahoma without a mask,  Herman Cain dies from coronavirus.
Herman Cain survived stage 4 colon cancer, and as a result had a comprised immune system as do most cancer survivors who undergo treatment.   Shame on those blaming Trump's Tulsa rally. There's no basement to the depravity of these people.

False. He has pledged to support the agenda of a President Biden.  This is not about Trump nor even a refresh of the Republican Party anymore.
So we can definitely assume trump is meaning canceling the election entirely? No. If we can postpone until covid is wraps. I‚Äôd like to see him go further on this topic. Neither you nor I know his full extent.
Ok. Who DIDN‚ÄôT have trump suggesting delaying the election on their card
it takes brass cojones for a 15 year old to change the radio station while driving with Jim Dunaway riding shotgun. That kid has a huge future ahead of him. The next Chuck Norris, a five-star general or Trump's next press secretary?
He should drink bleach and stick a UV lamp up his ass to prove his fidelity to Trump
how were they not used the same way when obama sent back more illegals and deported more illegals that trump has
We did take it seriously.our other choice was Hillary Clinton. No thanks. If Democrats would work with Trump, his policies would help everybody.
Peggy Wallace Kennedy: Trump understands, as my father did, that ‚Äúthe two greatest motivators for disaffected voters‚Äù are ‚Äúhate and fear. Mr. Trump exudes the same willingness to fight rather than to seek rational solutions much like my father did in 1968‚Äù
Peggy Wallace Kennedy: In his campaign ‚Äúmy father, Gov George Wallace, understood the potential political power of downtrodden and disillusioned working class white voters who felt alienated from government, and Donald Trump is mining the same mother lode‚Äù
All Google search pages have anti Trump and/or pro liberal articles. I completely ignore because I know what there agenda is and I will not be brainwashed.
WTF this drug works now we now our government officials really want population control, please people of this great nation don not make the mistake and vote for QUID PRO QUO JOE, TRUMP 2020 üá∫üá∏üôèüèΩ
So wrong as usually for a Trump supporter. Everytime an incident of voter fraud has been discovered it is republicans committing the crime. Just google it.This admin &amp; its local arm has shut down polling stations across the country to stop people from voting!
You and your policies are unamerican. You don‚Äôt represent American values. You along with trump need to be voted out this November.
Ugh, Lawrence O‚ÄôDonnell is sucking Jonathan Sean‚Äôs dick in his Trump interview. I‚Äôm gay and I find that bromance nauseating. It destroys your illusion of being impartial when you go on MSNBC to immediately get your ego stroked.
Evidently the big liberal headline right now is that Trump didn‚Äôt ask Putin about unverified intel. Of course if he had they would say he was endangering foreign relations. And all of it is speculation from Anon sources.
Let‚Äôs see... Sleepy Joe is east Coast and ‚Äú Blowjob ‚Äú Harris from Californicate .. they just left out MIDDLE AMERICA.. this can only help President Trump in November üá∫üá∏
y‚Äôall realize he wasn‚Äôt good at running his business either? Read Mary Trump‚Äôs book. He‚Äôs just a crook and every possible way.
If they want a job and to raise their standard of living, then they might want to vote for a Trump.
It is called freedom to live where you want if you can afford it. Trump didn‚Äôt start white flight. It is what everyone (not just whites) does when their neighborhoods become dangerous and infested with crime.
A name your price for a procedure. When daddy trump bless me I gotcha $1200
-he‚Äôs a Calvinist  -he‚Äôs very politically conservative and states those positions as if they were the biblically demanded ones at times  -he has backed off his criticism of Trump and now says he will vote for him  (some of the reasons for ire aimed at him from different groups)
Well, you wait on that. I think I will enjoy the life I have at present and hope to have 4 more years of Trump Presidency before the Democrats turn it into a socialist country.
Why does nobody ever talk about this being Trump‚Äôs profile picture?

Conservative Twitter: Arrgh!! Trump tweeted something stupid again!!  Me: Such a pity that I have Trump on mute... let's see, what to have to lunch...
Thank you for this editorial and plea to save us from ruin. President Trump has tried very hard, but vicious Democrats, MSM, and endless investigations have hampered his efforts. We cannot give up.
That is why I am so grateful to Trump. He saw that no one else was running that proposed policies that would MAGA or had the courage and stamina to do the job. He &amp; his family have suffered because he won. Look at what Barr has been subjected to. It is shameful.
"Trump wasted valuable resources on his stupid ventilator policy!"
That sounds like a challenge. Give it 10 minutes. I‚Äôm sure another bit of total absurdity will trump it
Also they made their point and went home. Even if Trump had decided for some reason to deploy troops the "threat" would be over by the time they even got there.
Watch the moment Trump walked out
Mitt Romney is not out of a job. He ran on supporting Trump and then stabbed him in the back.He is a liar and I am ashamed I voted for him.
Then we need to support Trump who is fighting for hard-working American citizens. He does, however, realize that you have to have successful American companies &amp; businesses to offer jobs to us. The opposite is slavery to the federal government. Do you want that?
Do you think the American people watched this? I hope so. It is an example of what Democratic ‚Äúleadership‚Äù will be like. TRUMP 2020
Didn‚Äôt even know who he was. Why he would be believed over a doctor or scientist is hilarious. And his ideas seem well thought out. Maybe Trump will appoint to lead the Rona. Don‚Äôt fuel the fire, Doug. Leave that loser alone
If Democrats win the House, Senate, &amp; Presidency, there will be no coming back for Republicans. We will be a socialist country with high taxes &amp; federal government running our daily lives. What Trump policies are the never-Trumpers against? What do they want?
Trump questions how Fauci has a high approval rating 'but nobody likes me'  What is with this guy? Trump always wants credit for nothing...  Thank you Fauci for trying to save this nation when Trump and his administration would not listen...
I heard there is no Covid outside the US. All of those reports were made up by the media, tech, and Dems. Supported by MI6 and others. It‚Äôs a conspiracy against Trump. AOC, Greta Thurnburg, and Hillary are the masterminds behind it all.  üòÇüòÇ

When people don‚Äôt like me, I don‚Äôt care because I am 100% good with who I am. When the President realizes people don‚Äôt like him, he pitches a fit like a toddler. The majority of AL will vote for Trump, &amp; C19 is going to be his running mate here. I am staying home!
He has no shame. He is a hater of Trump and he and Schiff will ski through any amount of slime to use their gavel on tv.

We get it you hate trump, but could it be to most states including mine making you wear mask?? Probably the more reasonable answer, but keep hating Trump.
Wtf is going on in your city? I mean come on the naivety in your post and logic is almost unbearable. Just look at rampant ‚Äúcovid cases‚Äù and pair them with democratic cities. Trump left the defense agaisnt covid to mayors, govenors and state guidelines.
Everywhere Trump has been awful (and there has been so much "awful"), Biden offers nothing better. In the relative handful of policy areas this administration has done ok, the Left plans to spin it all back and then some. I can't back Trump, but I can sure back not-Joe.
You guys thought burning books were bad.  "The President did not Tweet the video in question, he Retweeted it. Therefore, the account owner of the Tweet he Retweeted will face enforcement action," another Twitter spokesperson said.
I agree with you! Dems were extremely rude to AG and Trump is rude to so many people. I guess we‚Äôre moderates who like to treat people with respect
Biden just answered a question about dealing with rioters. He said HE would use local law enforcement to quell riots. Would he have that authority when Trump did not?
Biden talks about Trump holding a bible upside down and Bidens on priest won't let him have communion. Hmmm.
Do people still think Trump said to inject bleach? Are people just that stupid?
Headline: "AG Barr Claims Trump's Tweets Unreliable"
You remain a joke of a chairman &amp; felonious attacks of Trump. Your narrative is clear.  You‚Äôre an enemy of the state and you should be prosecuted as a criminal. The American public or not fools they can see through your lies  &amp; childish behavior.
sad that people are talking about myths and conspiracy theories about Trump not leaving office. Why are you wasting tax payer money. Total wasted your time and got called out with false statements
The community health centers targeted in the order already sell discounted drugs to patients, and the Trump administration may not have the legal power to force deeper discounts at enough pharmacies to make a difference. |
so you say you don‚Äôt want to be political yet you brought race directly into your statements about voting. Trying to insist Trump is racist
Barr is so unbelievably FOS and able to profusely lie very calmly with no prob. Yet another Trump wannabe.
stop your bias and being so unfair to republicans politicians , President Trump ministration and his family also republicans supporters.
Baloney. There are numerous studies that show the importance of this drug. It been in use for 65 years. Trump Derangrment Syndrome is costing lives.
If Trump wins again, I wonder how shocked the media will be. They think we listen to them and take our marching orders from them. They are shocked that we don‚Äôt.
Op-Ed: 5 months after the pandemic took over our lives, after nearly 150,000 died in US and after the economy went into intensive care, Pres Trump said last week that he was ‚Äúin the process of developing a strategy‚Äù to fight the coronavirus. Why the rush?

Burn it all down. They strive to be re-elected. When they agreed with Trump, went along with him , was so that they could be re-elected. Saw a St of AL Rep today celebrating the founder of KKK. I thought ‚ÄúHe wants to be the new Geo Wallace. ‚Äú Who wants to be the new Trump?
Joe, did you not see this coming when you allow protests yelling obscenities and becoming worked up into a mob frenzy? You probably want them to halt because you think this has gone too far and will help Trump (whom you hate) get re-elected. Have they come to your house yet?
Definitely not TRUMP he has just as many black supporters per capita as white
Trump support: cognition and crime. This is Biden's week points with swing voters.   Feelings toward Trump pro and con are influencing the election as opposed to feelings for Biden.  Rich is out of step with pollsters in the midwest.
Handling of the virus: is why Trump has lost any support; supporters: virus beyond his control.  Race relations: defund the police preposterous; social/mental health workers are not coming out for a 911 call; supported by them but do not allocate funds from the police
Rich Thau on   Midwest focus groups with 1) Obama-Trump and 2) Romney-Clinton swing voters.  Group 1) 7 of 9 takes Trump over Biden; other people (VP &amp; cabinet)will control him because of his faculties; like economic prospects with Trump  #Election2020

You misunderstand. I voted for Kerry, another write in, Obama, and Bernie. Alabama still voted in droves for Bush, McCain, Romney, and Trump. See how it didn't matter whether I wrote in or voted for the Dem? Actually, the Obama vote was in NYC and didn't matter there either.

Trump is the answer to what he speaks of
Trump vs everyone else in AL 62-38. Third party votes and write ins had no effect on the outcome.
Trump v everyone else in my state in 2016: 62-38. Have fun with your silly logic. That works in places like Michigan - not Alabama.
‚ÄúAnd if Trump wins?‚Äù ‚ÄúSame.‚Äù
Your gonna ruin this country. Tryna split the black vote so trump can win again. Please stop Kanye and just join Biden‚Äôs camp
100% correct God help us! President Trump has to be re-elected for America‚Äôs sake
1/2 Why do the Left folks, most of media too, always ignore the corruptness of the Obam-Biden in regard to many things but particularly the Deep State, FBI, CIA , DOJ higher ups targeting the  opposition campaign of Trump-Pence. Unprecedented. Corrupt. Disgraceful. Criminal.1/2

Is Romney up for re-election? I think he has some more years left in the Senate before he runs again. What a snake! He campaigned to support Trump and now votes with the Democrats.
I canceled my PEOPLE magazine subscription after writing &amp; calling them to complain about their Trump trashing before the last election.They had to refund my  they are begging me to start my subscription again.But they didn‚Äôt care enough to change then.

No, it is literally a vote for Bernie, but i get what you're driving at. You'd have a point if the EC didn't exist or if i was in a state that didn't vote 62-38 Trump in 2016 and the state had lost love for him. He will win my state at least 58-42.
Perspective: In a classic bit of Trump gaslighting, not only has any hope for increased school funding dematerialized, but the administration is threatening to defund individual school districts if they don‚Äôt comply with the order to reopen.
1. Trump will spin it whether it is close or a huge defeat. Egomaniacs don't care if logic is sound in trying to build themselves up.  2. Until my state is ready, my vote is meaningless anyway. So, why not vote my conscience instead of being pragmatic when it won't change a thing
Or it is a different approach knowing the same facts you do. I can vote Biden, Bernie, Mickey Mouse, or Trump, and it won't change a thing in Alabama's EC vote. They aren't ready yet.
I love the Bernie is backing Biden crowd. I didn't write in Bernie because I thought he would win that way. I voted for him because I understand Alabama enough to know they loved Trump. He won 62-38 against all other options. He will win my state at least 58-42 this time.
Then, it wouldn't be close anywhere except maybe swing states...oh, wait. I tell you what if I'm not feeling too idealistic this time, I will vote Biden since my vote doesn'tmean anything. Trump will still win my state at least 58-42. Stay tuned for me being right.
First, I do not vote party line dogmatically. That just reinforces the two party system.  Now, back to Trump. 62-38. That's Trump v not Trump in AL. Tied for 6th biggest win he had. Split didn't affect anything.
Compare to whom Obama awarded medals to Trump‚Äôs awards. Entertainers vs. patriots.

Sen. Coons is a little late. When the MSM constantly trashes our President and preaches what a bad country America is, then you encourage mobs and anarchy. These are not Conservatives, Trump supporters, and Christians who are rioting.
Mnuchin told reporters at the Capitol that extending an expiring unemployment benefit but reducing it substantially was a top priority for Trump. The secretary called the $600 wk aid ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù and a disincentive for people to go back to work. Not for my family!
I feel the point of his original ‚Äúraise your hand‚Äù is that the rapidly-expanding global ripples caused by Trump, his family, and the totally unqualified and incompetent people advising/surrounding him have gotten us to this point. &amp; of course, there‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs civil war looming...

That is not true. Check out the stories how he has helped people and not told everyone. The Dems want you to believe that to get your vote. Trump is a very generous man with his money.
You people accept lies even when you don‚Äôt do your research. Trump did not delay starting on stopping the Virus. Pelosi was prancing around China town with no mask and saying the celebration should continue. Dems were more concerned  with impeachment than the Virus.
Thank you for fighting for us. Trump 2020
This is not true. The Dems are not stopping the Terrorist in the streets, is that what you want for the United States? This is what will happen if Biden is elected. They spied on Trump and will turn this country into a socialist country!!!

It won't count. EC makes sure of that. All of Alabama's votes will go to Trump.

No, but only because my state will go hard Trump. His worst qualities endear him to them. Since my voice will be silenced by the electoral college, I don't have to be pragmatic.  Looks like another right in for Bernie. Two in a row.

Kat, if you think this election doesn‚Äôt make a difference, then I guess you don‚Äôt need to vote. I think this election will determine how fast we move to socialism. I am voting for Trump because I think he will at least delay it. It is VERY important to me &amp; my family.

I mean I might WISH I was dead by the end if Trump was in a talkative mood, but assuming the main goal is getting there in one piece it seems like a no-brainer.
Yeah, see, the thing is, I don't trust Trump and never really have. You can't say the same about the media sources that got you all excited about Russiagate.
You‚Äôre the problem. Your rhetoric does nothing but fan the flames of violence. You are afraid to hold people accountable when they break the law. You‚Äôre afraid to hold illegal immigrants accountable when they cross the border illegally. You are the problem not Trump. Resign liar
People like you and Trump are responsible for the economy tanking and deaths rising. Kneel before God, beg forgiveness, and vow to live according to the Gospel before it is too late.

This is my go to gif for trump - especially if you use the entire speech
What are you doing about the continued unchecked gun violence and murders in your city? You are spending more time worried about Trump than the people dying in your own city. How about try to effectively govern and protect your own city first.
Biden doesn't think Woodrow Wilson re-segregating the federal government &amp; showing the pro-KKK film Birth of a Nation at the WH was racist, doesn't think FDR throwing Japanese-Americans in internment camps was racist, but Trump saying "China virus" makes him the only racist POTUS

Trump will try and steal the election, of that I have no doubt. But like everything else Trump attempts, he will fail and lose.  Trump is a born loser.
Trump and his Republican enablers represent the worst aspects of human nature. They are determined to undermine our democracy for their own gain. They should be treated as an enemy, driven back underground and shunned.
With Trump and his Republican accomplices, it isn't as much about ideology as it is petty animalistic greed and lust for power. They have come up from the underbelly of our society at a time of crisis, using fear and division as a weapon against their own people.
Democrats will not beat Trump unless you all can get that voter fraud worked out.....I mean, "mail in voting"

I want to thank you for the years of dedication and service. Trump's trying to shut you down before the election please sue him because his motive is political and he must be held accountable.
Yeah, it wasnt til I read their twitter that I realized they got honey dicked by Trump.
What you see as missteps, I see as chess moves. I have learned in watching President Trump that he uses distractions to achieve certain goals. This is a distraction.  I'm not sure what the goal is yet but I'm sure we will discover it in due time.
I hate to be a downer, but how different is that from President Trump‚Äôs belief in hydroxy chloroquine?  There is no evidence that your belief is true.  The structural barriers to equality are formidable and there are few men like  .
Mr. Griffith don‚Äôt say you don‚Äôt blame Trump for the pandemic and also say it‚Äôs his fault for economy failing. Jeff you should be making these arguments.
World leaders know that Trump will do as he says because he has time and time again. He said allies will have to start paying more for their defense and they followed.  He said he would move US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and he did. He said he would end Iran deal..
Another one of Trump's fanboys bites the dust. To bad.  Seems like the rest of Trump's pawns would take the hint and run while they can.
It was instant.. thanks trump!
America the fascist shithole run by Administration that only lies.
I sure hope so, she is by far the best qualified. Trump will try to waponize her appearances on TV after Benghazi but I don‚Äôt think that will matter to anyone except his base.

Ignorant. President Trump voted absentee ballot. Joe, unless you‚Äôre totally gone, you know the difference. Why make such a vacuous statement that is totally disingenuous? Don‚Äôt you respect the intelligence of Americans to know the difference? Or don‚Äôt you have any real issues?

Trump is attacking America anyone who will help him not be reelected. He's desperate he's got 97 days left and he's on a mission. We have to pay attention because it will get worse. We have to be prepared.
I agree with you about the Trump scheme to destroy the postal service so we can not vote by mail. Hopefully they are suing him for eliminating them for political gain, employees need to sue for their families.
I bet the CEO has an inside with the Trump campaign or family members.

Trump is moving troops out of Germany because Angela Merkel made him look stupid, which isn't very hard to do, but when standing next to a peer, she made him look like.... well she made him look like this üëáüèΩ

Again proving my point and I am still laughing. I think Trump is far from anyone that might be sent from God. I however absolutely will not support anyone or any party that doesn't protect Christian values and morals. Now why don't you go read your Bible and get back to me.
Conservatives weren't whining about the EO. It's what he was doing with it. An executive order is a constitutional power given to the president. And SCOTUS protected Obama's DACA order, which just sets a precedent increasing the power of the executive office. Currently: Trump.
Obama imposed regs which affected small businesses that couldn't afford it which eliminated any competition to the major conglomerates. It's almost as if that was the plan. Trump is preventing a monopoly (already illegal) from treating people differently based on political party
And it'll be hard to undo when he's gone. Thanks to recent SCOTUS decision on DACA. They actually increased Trump's power by ruling against him.
Attending tRump University, yes?
This is exactly what He did with Trump property and was fined for not renting to people of color

I keep saying Trump is a master chess player.  He‚Äôs been in the loop and was being prepared for Presidency for many years.  His strategies may seem awkward to some but the majority of us know he doesn‚Äôt make decisions on the fly.  Everything he does is thought out.
Did you watch Biden yesterday when he took 4 questions, had notes, news outlets pre planned and he still screwed up! No way he will face Trump on stage!! Watch and seeüò°
I was disappointed that Trump said yesterday that we will still be getting drugs from China. We should buy nothing from them! Cheaper and safer for us and would make many jobs in labs across the country!ü§î

As a vet say something about these images of wannabe soldiers deploying around country in full out camo/ military field gear. People watching tv think these are our soldiers. Not General Trump‚Äôs toy army soldiers. It‚Äôs very bad for the image of our folks proudly wearing uniforms!
Ask Jim about the mystery volume on Kodak day before the big announcement by Trump yesterday. There‚Äôs a üêÄ in them buys. Think Trump‚Äôs SEC will look at that? Highly doubt that.
Look at Kodak stock volume the day before the big announcement by the Orange King yesterday. I smell Kushner/ Trump cutouts. Around 30-50k shares to over 1.5 million!! Grifters gonna grift. Smell‚Äôs like a rat.Think Trump‚Äôs SEC will look? No way.
General: Trump‚Äôs gestapo toy soldiers clad in camo and full military gear come across as our soldiers to most of the public. Please would you and other respected former leaders speak out. They‚Äôre hurting the image of our brave folks in uniform serving us all. Thanks
Thank you for your service sir. And thank you for still serving by speaking out. I wish more of our former military leaders would speak out. This President brings shame to our soldiers everyday playing General Trump with his toy soldiers clad in camo. Folks see our soldiers üò¢
And I‚Äôm always winning like I‚Äôm Donald Trump!
I am more confident now because the media and democrats are fully exposed. My only concern is voter fraud because they have been pushing vote by mail for the past 4 months. I know I will be voting for President Trump and all Republican down the ballot.
The media is 24/7 hate Trump. They are just following the narrative of the Democrats. The fake news media is truly the enemy of the people.
Anyone think trump has invested in hydrochloriquine?
why have you not directly asked Trump if he has financial ties to the Med?
Unfortunately so many are brainwashed and fell to the theory that only Trump can fix things, and we all know his promotion of the meds, which by the way, and physician would have lost their license for promoting an unstudied drug for use by all.
Apparently trump and a few others have stock in it. Why has no one asked him if that is true.

President Trump was right again. They need to make it available over the counter. So many lives would have been saved because the media and democrats hate President Trump. They would rather people die than give him credit.
I afraid the machines will be hacked yet Trump has now put his own guy over the postal service.
Cavuto and Napiltano are both bought and paid for...the judge is still mad that Trump will not put him on the Supreme Court...
Idk I will have to figure all that out. The Ga primary was a disaster. We had a brand new voting system $105 and they kept breaking down, closed polling places in minority area, and long line. Now Trump put his own person in charge of the post office.
Which will we see at this briefing, Twitter or Teleprompter Trump?  Jekyll or Hyde.
I don‚Äôt think they looked very impressive to the American public that watched.  President Trump May have to thank them this fall!!
Well when you look at what democrat voters are saying : not really. They think dems should let Barr talk so he can incriminate himself and /or Trump. They can't fathom that the questioners don't want him going into too much detail. Mainly because it would implicate dems.

Exactly and it pisses me off. Sometimes it seems like President Trump is on an island by himself except for his supporters. Hopefully it will be a landslide victory with Republicans riding his coattails to victory
For starters y‚Äôall can‚Äôt tell me that ain‚Äôt Donald Trump üòÇ
That‚Äôs really crappy but I bet your sentiment is shared by so many. I will continue to wear my Trump gear and not afraid to show my support.

To put the GOP recommendation of 1.75 bil for FBI building in perspective, if actually used to help Americans, each man, woman, and child would get $500.  Or we can misuse a relief bill for a pet project Trump is demanding.
I was at the gym earlier and an older Spanish lady approach me. I always wear a MAGA or KAG hat at the gym. She said how much she loves President Trump and was afraid to wear her hat because of people giving her evil looks. This tells me the silent majority is increasing everyday

Trump and a few of his officials bought stock in it, then had the US buy up the supplies of it in anticipation.

yeah we know that.  anyone with common sense should realize that.  i'm sooo anti-trump but if i was invited to the white house, i would go just out of curiosity.  anybody would

TRUMP YOU BETTER HURRY AND GET THOSE STIMULUS CHECKS OUT MAN.  THATS A VOTE CHANGER. I CAN BE BOUGHT.
Let these cities deal on their own.  If they don‚Äôt Feds so be it &amp; see how that works out,  but no way in Hell you can blame on Trump!!!!
I find that you are easily manipulated and that the fire you once showed for Trump have been far to easy to douse. Either stand up for what you truly believe and be real or don‚Äôt, but trying to bring the rest of us down will not work!
Nope
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to have a solution to this. It‚Äôs not masks. It‚Äôs not shutting down the economy. Hopefully it is American ingenuity that will allow for therapies and vaccines to ultimately conquer this."  I wonder if HCQ will be apart of these treatments.
Blame Obama, he did nothing for what the protesters are protesting!  How‚Äôs it Trump‚Äôs fault?
cnn also says they are a news media. Both just as unbelievable.  CNN Polls: Biden leads in three key states Trump won in 2016  #SmartNews
Trump said this months ago didn‚Äôt he ?
LOL! Trump said that he had a great relationship with the Blacks. He also pointed out his own personal African American.
Even worse is the right wing media repeating it &amp; Trump supporters believing it.
Trump made his money before becoming a politician. Why is his tax returns relevant? Can‚Äôt say the same about dirty Joe.
I don't understand why Black people and women voted for Trump.  Then again I don't understand why people don't vote either.
It seems Fox will post anything to support Trump but how well he's doing on the Virus , all countries but the U.S. have it pretty well in check we are out of control.

They wanted the ban on evictions to expire. All these Republicans are slum lords. Trump is obvious, but Hannity owns over 500 rental homes &amp; these senate Republicans own lots of rentals. Now they can evict evict evict!
The Trump family scooped up a bunch of that PPP money for themselves too while American small businesses go under.
It was the elderly that got Trump elected in America. Now the elderly are being exterminated by Trump using Covid-19. It's funny if you think about it.

We can thank Trump, Fox News &amp; the rest of right wing media for this anti-mask hysteria, and the resulting mass deaths, multi trillion dollar bailouts, and the coming economic collapse. No folks, the collapse hasn't happened yet, 11% unemployment is just a preview.

Look, you either support the Constitution on this or you don't.  Section 2 of the 14th Amendment says that the census is for counting "the whole number of persons in each state".  It has nothing to do with immigration status.  Trump's wrong.  As usual.

Trump doesn't seem to mind mail in voting too much
Why is Trump pushing for his supporters to vote by mail if the system is as fraudulent as you say?
It's almost certainly Trump.  He is unfortunately also lawless, amoral, dangerous, and must not be allowed to have a second term.

You always vote for the lesser of two evils. Or you can write in some one. Trump ain‚Äôt ideal but better than the alternative.
I agree! He called Trump a racist. People need to go back &amp;read what Biden has said about black people. He said social workers need to go to black peoples house &amp; teach them how to raise their children. That was HORRIBLE for Biden to say. Look at the Washington Post article.

What is your opinion about the possiblity that Trump would try to have the post master general (that he just appointed) claim that mail in ballots from certain (dem) cities in swing states are invalid bc of voter fraud or etc? He would try to do that to tip the election.
Omg all I have to do to be successful is to start a business and say how great trump is biiiiiitch...

Please take Trump's plan to move troops out of Germany seriously and stop him !
IF this plan occurs,it will be a continuation of Trump/Putin plans to weaken America inside &amp; outside our borders! I pray Americans will understand this and   you and all military people will explain this to American families so they will vote him out!
Barr faked his way through the entire day. He is a criminal the same as Trump is.  They ARE working together to weaken America. We need to work together to encourage a gigantic wave of votes to oust Trump thereby ridding ourselves of Barr at the same time!
McConnell is responsible for the power that Trump has now, at this very moment.  They planned it for many years, including Obama's term.

One of many absurdities is Trump blames the Soviet collapse solely on Afghanistan expenditures, implicitly dismissing decades of U.S. pressure accelerating dramatically in 1980. This was the kind of talking point Dems used to downplay the Reagan/Bush achievement.

Trump's intent to steal the election or disregard the results is on full display at his press conference. Fascism is on full display. It is time for all citizens of good will to do everything possible to fight Trump's power grab.

He chose not to wear a mask or social distance contrary to the recommendation of the health experts and professionals, following the ignorant advice of Trump.  Additionally, how many others did he infect?  How many of them may die?  He chose to risk the lives of others.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

Not that we do not need to fear what happened in 2016 to happen in 2020, but the Supreme Court is asked to rule on forcing Electoral delegates to vote according to the popular vote. Remember trump was never popular.
All 3, Clinton, Bush and Obama, together provide sharp relief against our extremely unfortunate reality of Trump. Dignity, honor and patriotism...these values mark our past, regardless of political difference. Let's please, please be this again. Vote 11.3.
Once again, Trump proves that the "rule of law" only applies in certain situations. Do you think he knows he can't just move the election?
trump isn‚Äôt saying its to dangerous to vote. he is saying that the liberal left will use mail in voting to cheat, therefore to protect the Americans who don't want the country to be destroyed, we would move the election.

I desperately want Trump to (figuratively) die on this hill, stay until 1/20/21, get kicked out of office by the Constitution, have Nancy Pelosi become president by default, RBG retires immediately, and BAM - welcome new Associate Justice Barack Obama.
But do you have a choice in engaging in a private institution if economic realities don't provide you another choice? If walmart is the only grocery store for 3 hours and they say "well you can't shop here if you support Trump" isn't that in function the same thing?
And Trump just SLASHED prescription costs. Somebody isn‚Äôt happy!!
Are you talking about our President. President Trump is the elected president and leader of the United States of America. Therefore your tweet does not make sense. You must be a Democrat.

Don't  me for that last typo please.  You criticise Dems for predicting 4% growth and only getting 2%. Remind me of Trump's promise of DP growth from his tax cuts? I'll remind you. 6%.  Yeah, he got to 3 1/2% one quarter. Dems were closer.
Tens of thousands more will die, especially if they make kids go to school.  And yes, because Trump has no plan we have to live like this until Biden takes office.
This is on you and every other senator who refused to remove Trump when you had a chance. The  foot dragging on Covid response has tanked our economy and cost 150,000 lives. We will not forget on November 3rd.

A respected Republican figure dies from coronavirus after refusing to wear a mask at a Trump rally or anywhere else &amp; some people are praising him? I honestly can't comprehend dying to "own the libs" or praising Herman Cain's choice of "freedom" after the fact. 2020 is amazing
Where did I mention Trump?
After denying the legitimacy of COVID-19 and attending a tRump rally in Oklahoma without a mask,  Herman Cain dies from coronavirus.
That is basic Trump business practice.  Make a profit no matter who you fuk!
will need to consult with Herman Cain.  Who is doing very very well, according to Trump just yesterday.
You mean  is not a King?   Well in that case,  Trump!     Hold my beans.

Leave it to Donald Trump to try anything to keep his hold on power.

You are right...Collins is a flipflop and has supported Trump.  She couldn't even vote to remove...and is disgusting example of woman in congressional role.  Her support of Trump was her decision made with dire consequences.  She doesn't deserve the office!
Herman Cain survived stage 4 colon cancer, and as a result had a comprised immune system as do most cancer survivors who undergo treatment.   Shame on those blaming Trump's Tulsa rally. There's no basement to the depravity of these people.

So before I‚Äôve even had time for breakfast, Herman Cain died from COVID after attending a mask-less Trump rally, GDP fell 33% in Q2, and Trumps threatening to postpone the election. Just another day in Trumpland, 2020
Herman Cain‚Äôs death is on tRump. Simple.
Damn  is dead. Black folk gon‚Äô stop listening to Trump. He‚Äôs literally having people killed
In trump‚Äôs defense, he handed a lot of power over to state‚Äôs to allow them to dictate their own virus response plan (see California vs Texas) Some places have been able to crush the curve, others haven‚Äôt. Our state leadership is also to blame
Exactly!! Let's not be distracted by Trump's nonsense! His world is collapsing around him, so he's cornered like a rat! Desperate, scared and insane. He's a terrible danger to the country and the world!
False. He has pledged to support the agenda of a President Biden.  This is not about Trump nor even a refresh of the Republican Party anymore.
Sir, the economy was ‚Äúbooming‚Äù in spite of Donald Trump, not because of him.
while under this administration openly racist behavior has become much more prevalent, some of y‚Äôall really need to remember that the BLM movement was created during the obama era and that racism is not a ‚Äútrump‚Äù thing, it‚Äôs an ‚Äúamerica‚Äù thing.

2012- How can you continue to support &amp; vote for Obama? He's a CELEBRITY President  The same person voted for Donald Trump
how were they not used the same way when obama sent back more illegals and deported more illegals that trump has
If that's the main reason you didn't vote for Hillary, you may want to reassess your personal values. I'm sorry but people like you who didn't vote for her for petty personal reasons when knowing Trump was the alternative, are the reason an incompetent is in the Whitehouse today.

Going by your bio, I‚Äôm surprised you didn‚Äôt bring up the theory of Trump planning to cause the USPS to fail to process mail in votes in a timely fashion. That‚Äôs a much better conspiracy theory.
If Republicans don‚Äôt like it, they need to clean up the mess they‚Äôve created in the White House. Their silence is once again complicity. Trump has gotten away with everything he has wanted to do and feels emboldened and now the R‚Äôs have lost control of him and their party.
what if, say, a trump-supporting mailman picks up a ballot from a house with a biden sign in the front (or vice versa). do you trust that person not to "lose" the ballot?
Absentee mail-in voting is good, but universal mail-in voting is bad. Why, you ask? Because it‚Äôs been pointed out that he and many people in his WH have used absentee mail-in voting in the past. More of the in-your-face hypocrisy we have become all too accustomed to with Trump.

The problem is that he's going to make this a reality, as the USPS delivery is already slowing down and some facilities face shutdown.   We need to pay careful scrutiny on this...Trump's machinations against our democracy is more than rhetoric, case in point, Portland, OR.

Did you look at the budget Trump offer up? If his budget could get passed we wouldn‚Äôt be adding to the debt.
I hope people that didn‚Äôt vote for Trump last time will reconsider this time.
Do you just sit and think, ‚ÄúTrump is a leadership pandemic that has us in the middle of a public health, economic, housing, and education crisis...‚Äù? We are not even touching national security. The next president will need 8 years to undo the damage.

I think Dr. Stella Immanuel was a secret love message from Trump to  and  #alpolitics
A name your price for a procedure. When daddy trump bless me I gotcha $1200
Trump should have allowed him on Air Force 1 w/o a test.
There's no doubt about it. As I have commented several times before that Trump feels that he must appeal to rural and suburban white Americans, usually, through fear mongering in order to win. Winning is Trump's only concern. He doesn't care how he does it....
33/40 has been on a roll. Trump and his supporters are so up in their heads and it‚Äôs made them crazy. They know what‚Äôs coming.
Sounds about right. Trump's absence is simultaneously a condemnation of him and welcome.
Here's Trump's next doctor about to come on board the Trump crack medical team!
you‚Äôre definitely desperate. who said we stan wendy‚Äôs? all i said was that they said they don‚Äôt support trump , you took it and ran with it
I bet Putey reads Trump bedtime stories.
Looking at  interview with Mary Trump. They are right, trump needed a VP that could reel him in instead of a bunch of yes men and opportunistic around him. No matter how much I do not like their politics GWB/Chaney were a great team.
The fuck are you talking about, dude? Republicans will still have the judiciary and most likely the senate. Christ, you‚Äôre think. In no world is Biden worse than Trump.
Trump is such a kind, caring soul. If the American people don't vote him out in November, I'll have lost all faith in humanity.
There‚Äôs a campaign ad that says  received donations from ‚Äúradical left Hollywood Liberals.‚Äù Fortunately this ad miss their mark. Even his ‚Äúfriends in Hollywood‚Äù realize Alabama needs a representative in Washington who is for the people and not party &amp; trump.
A picture of Donald Trump‚Äòs girlfriends if he wasn‚Äôt born a millionaire.
Well, you wait on that. I think I will enjoy the life I have at present and hope to have 4 more years of Trump Presidency before the Democrats turn it into a socialist country.
Like Trump, he‚Äôs running scared and playing the race card in a state where he knows it will play well. Graham was once well respected, but has been in Washington too long. He‚Äôs lost his moral grounding and has surrendered his principles. It‚Äôs time for new leadership.
Am I wrong in thinking what he did gave trump the election?
u POS turd .. spying on the Trump campaign is illegal &amp; BULLSHIT.. Obummer &amp; all his F‚Äôn cronies need to be indicted #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver üá∫üá∏
There is no helping energy....they crashed like they did in the 80's.  Glut of oil has driven prices down as well as Trump economic downturn because of his inability to formulate and exercise a plan to handle Covid.
There is no end to Trump‚Äôs lies and deception, at least not until January 20, 2021. Can you even imagine how dangerous a second Trump term would be?
And Trump wasn't invited.....that speaks volumes about the state of our country and  no leadership.  Trump cannot even publically recognize the contribution this man made to our country, our laws and our lives.  He is incapable of it...he has no humanity....
LOL...the family didnt even ask Trump to attend to hand out the printed programs at the door!!! LOL!!!  HE IS IRRELEVANT SOOO!!!
This is hilarious the Trump bots are whinning they have lost followers well at this point if they listened to Trump her followers might be in an ICU.
Can we just send Trump, his Circle of Evil and his followers?
Go do some MAGAt trolling....they are just as ignorant, hateful, insulting and mean spirited as Trump.  There is no redeeming them so we have to get every voter to polls for Biden and Dem candidates!
DID ONE OF  ORBITERS JUST CALL ME   TRUMP
Is Cotton referring to trump as a necessary evil?
trump was probably holding on to near worthless shares of Kodak stocks that he has now gotten rid of.
If we keep house and get majority in Senate we could impeach and remove his ass.  But we want all three.  Biden is not being overconfident...he is not the weak ignorant strutting peacock that Trump is...Then we can prosecute Trump and his evil minions who enabled him...
I‚Äôm embarrassed so many Alabamians have been fleeced by Trump but I‚Äôm not shocked. Doug Jones is working for Alabama. #defeatTommytuberville  #NobodyLikesTrump
As Trump touts executive orders on drug pricing, Dems and drug-makers raise concerns
Why does nobody ever talk about this being Trump‚Äôs profile picture?
Can you run one against Tommy Tuberville he will win due to football.  He is sayin he is gonna help Trump drain the swamp. We need Doug Jones to stay in for Alabama to grow
Thugs? Damn, trump got y‚Äôall wildin
I love listening to your show! And I'm confident ur a real true blue progressive! But I get terribly disappointed when Red Scare &amp; Russia fear mongering passes for "resisting" Trump. Parroting MIC propaganda &amp; restarting the Cold War is NOT resisting!
Donald. Trump.
Congress should not have any more access to testing than the rest of the country. If they provide it for themselves, they need to assure that the American people have the same ability to be tested. Regardless of what Trump says, a test is NOT available to everyone who wants one.
Nice job w/questions by  ; Trump also really shows his ignorance.
Probably some of those paintings with Jesus smiling behind Trump.
Trump doesn't care...he does not know how to lead, but we will make sure that the ignorant asshole is prosecuted for the murder of americans with depraved indifference when he could have taken action to prevent those deaths.
I think they dropped that shtick when Trump took over the party.   Now they‚Äôre just rooted in pwning the libs.
WTF!!!!  I cannot wait for Trump to be prosecuted for his crimes and crap against the American public!
Unless you distance yourself from tRUmp, your reputation will be forever tarnished.
ü§Æ 1-What is wrong with tRUmp‚Äôs hands/fingers? 2-You forgot to include the two people responsible for tRUmp‚Äôs election, Julian Assange &amp; Putin 3-the likenesses are a bit off, why would anyone pay $37,000 for this garbage?
I'm trying to get AL TV news to do more fact checking of Trump. Maybe you want to get them to fact check Nadler.           #alpolitics
Bots eat burritos? But using God to promote Trump is a sin.
Do you think Fred Trump was "Father of the Year?"
Sounds like some of what Barr tried with that attorney of TRUMPS that is writing a book. I wouldn't sign a thing they are witnesses to the terror Trump caused. I see prison in his future.
HAPPENING NOW: President Trump delivers remarks on restoring energy dominance in Midland, Texas
Does anyone else believe that when Trump tweets "Law and Order" that it's a signal üîäthat another elite has been arrested or executed?  #WWG1WWGA #QAnon2020 #PatriotsInControl #Patriots #tictock
Trump policies are helping Texas economy recover, while Biden would crush energy jobs
You do know he is currently trying to expend federal funds to protect trump tower's value, and has regularly used the position for personal profit, right?  Then again, maybe in this vein he's not a sellout, but I don't think a thief is any better.
It‚Äôs like everytime I go on Twitter I‚Äôm given yet another reason to hate trump with my entire being.
Another unearned photo-op for the strongest example yet against the case for American meritocracy, Ivanka Trump.
Typical president: "see we need to encourage freedom from communism overseas!"  Trump: "yea we sold crack to the inner cities to give genocidal drug cartels guns, so?"
Biden: "we're moving the low income housing out of the suburbs so that we can encourage a spirit of entrepreneurship this nation was built upon!!!!"  Trump: "man don't you hate those poor minorities?! They'll be out of your suburb before long!"
Today on the  Show: Battleground State Analysis Predicts Trump Reelection
Trump administration weighing drug testing for food stamps.
Any other president would do the same b.s. but would mask it in the "American shining city on a hill" mantra. Trump just straight up says "yeah we've funded some genocides and overthrew governments for corporate interests ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
One of the best things about Trump is he forces everyone to acknowledge this country for what it really is and what it really does, not what we want it to be
There is literally no other reason. His entire campaign is that he isn‚Äôt Trump.
Give him a dose of trump‚Äôs drug and let him go with the orange guy!!

ü§£ü§£ü§£ tRUmp wants credit for everything and blame for nothing.
Just being true to himself
Trump is a serial abuser of women which includes his daughter and has actually had charges filed against him in federal court for rape of a minor.  No such charges remotely filed against Biden. This is a lie and you are a liar.  Repeating this untrue story is libel and slander.
I would like to file a discrimination charge against Trump....I  would like to make it a class action suite....anybody want in or know an attorney who will take this on.
Yes they are trying to, but it seems to be backfiring. I wonder if they secretly want Trump to win.
More bribes for votes.    Step up suckers, hold you noses and take a taste.   3 1/2 years without a nickle for #infrastructure, but "Trust Trump Now".  You better get it now, because he doesn't give a damn about you, never did.  He just loves your vote.

Sen. Jones speaks very eloquently about what he believes and why he supports what he does. He is running against Coach Whatever-Trump-Says.
That is a lie. Jones is no where near Warren or Sanders ideologically &amp; saying otherwise is either ignorant or intentionally misleading.  Jones fought to end the Military Widows Tax, why are Repubs against that? What about other leg Trump signed?  Folks: vote policy, not party.
Take a look at this video. SMH. This is Trump's America. #BlackLivesMatter Thank you,  #TrumpIsARacist Hey, y'all, please #WearADamnMask üò∑

Trumps America is looking more and more like 1964. He is has become a #Fascist  With record unemployment, about to have record Homelessness, over 150,000 dead from the #TrumpVirus, Trump has made the United States of America a complete failure.  Time to take out the trash.
Go back to find out who threw the fit about announcing Russia involvement in our election.  Trump threatened that if Obama did he would go after him.  The investigations prove that Russia did exactly that. Denying the truth doesn't negate it,  it only shows your denial of facts.
It makes no sense! I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump because I thought he would govern from the left but I was completely wrong. How could any conservative not look at the things Trump has been fighting for and not be enthusiastically voting for him this go around?
I take the flu vaccine and have my children vaccinated, does that make me a sheeple? I‚Äôm not onboard with Covid vaccine because trump is rushing it. However, continue not wearing a mask and ask your doctor for Hydroxychloroquine and we‚Äôll see who‚Äôs voting Nov 3rd.
He only got tested because he was about to go on a trip with trump. I hope he made out with Jordan before he left yesterday
The actual reports are almost all just graffiti. Or someone shoots off a  little rocket and then Barr/Trump calls it a ‚Äúfirebombing.‚Äù It‚Äôs not great, but the people inflating it are the trump regime not the people in Portland.
Didn't JFK say this? "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."   The fed govt's own playbook for dealing effectively with uprisings advises against the very approach Trump's fed forces are taking.   I'd say their approach is failing.
President Trump says he will accept RNC nomination in NC.
Trump never suggested people do that. Why do you continue with your stupidity??!
Conservative Twitter: Arrgh!! Trump tweeted something stupid again!!  Me: Such a pity that I have Trump on mute... let's see, what to have to lunch...

it's ashame that Donald Trump has made name calling okay, weren't any of you taught as children, it's not nice to call people names... Damn shame!!!
The federal government has its own playbook for dealing effectively with dissent/grievances/rioting at home and abroad. The fed officers in Portland &amp; other cities are decidedly not following that playbook. Why then have they been given other orders? What is Trump's purpose here?

Please do a little, just a little research before you speak and try to pass lies off.
If democrats can find a way to lose they‚Äôll do it. I expect then to campaign on Medicare 4 all, gun regulation and everything else that will charge republicans to the polls for trump. I just wish they‚Äôd wait till after the election but I have 0 confidence they will

Barr failed today.  If you could not see it you are blinded by your own hate and racism. He is violating the Constitution, first, fifth, sixth, seventh,eight and tenth amendments in addition to others. The illegal Gestapo SS Goon squads were imposed by Barr and Trump.
Teated before he got on Air Force 1 w/ Trump.

Stupid ass...this is Trump's freaking America!
For all you disrespectful loonie toons calling trump crazy you just need to pipe down. The liberal, Marxist, socialist left has shown their true colors and I don‚Äôt say this lightly but true Americans want nothing to do with it or you! Let Barr speak or don‚Äôt ask him anything!
Broke a law in a country theyre...seeking asylum in? You obviously are missing how important immigration is to agriculture and all the industries white people don‚Äôt wanna work in. Even if you support trump you should protest the tyranny of the democrats.
While Trump is wasting money sending federal agents to majority black &amp; Democratic cities, he should be sending industries &amp; money to those cities. That's what caused much of the decline, not "so-called" Democratic leaders. Democratic leaders have done well to maintain cities...
Who originally paid for the Steele dossier? A Republican for Marco Rubio to beat Trump. And when Trump was determined that he was going to beat RUBIO... they sold it to the Democrats!  GET OUT! GO WATCH YOUR VIDEOS OF WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT TRUMP
Go back and review...he didn't answer the yes/no question asked and they had to repeat it several times...do you not understand how questioning is done?  Get facts before you decide to show your ignorance on social media.  We are tired of the lies and bs from Trump's minions.
Thank you for this editorial and plea to save us from ruin. President Trump has tried very hard, but vicious Democrats, MSM, and endless investigations have hampered his efforts. We cannot give up.
Liars one an all covering for one another.  Dems ate his freaking lunch despite the empty screaming of your GOP ignorant asshats.  We refuse to allow Trump, Barr or anyone else deny rights of Citizens under the Constitution.  Unlike most GOP, we have actually read it!

Exercising 1st amendment rights is not suppression of information. Dems cannot be socialists and fascist at the same time.  No dems are repressing free speech...however, Trump and Barr have by creating illegal military force to suppress protesters in Portland. Get the facts!
That is why I am so grateful to Trump. He saw that no one else was running that proposed policies that would MAGA or had the courage and stamina to do the job. He &amp; his family have suffered because he won. Look at what Barr has been subjected to. It is shameful.
