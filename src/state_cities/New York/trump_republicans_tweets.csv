1) if your opinion is racist, then it *IS* racist 2) I call out any politician if I don‚Äôt agree w/ a decision 3) You are trying to distract instead of admitting that Trump did not do what was necessary to protect us 4) Following Trump blindly is *actual* herd mentality

Chris Cuomo doesn‚Äôt even know how to spell the word class. To suggest that Trump is responsible for Herman  Cains death is beyond vile. This is the same Chris Cuomo that broke the stay in place order that his own brother had mandated. What a jerk!
If trump does "win" the election again in 2020, it will be due to Russian interference in the election. We have REAL evidence it happened in 2016. The SEE nothing SAY nothing DO nothing radical right republicans are falsely discrediting and/or ignoring evidence.

Well, Amy, it's absolutely possible that Herman Cain got the virus at the Trump rally and since the official announcement says they aren't sure where he got it, odds are he got it there. But he was in Arizona just prior, and traveled elsewhere, too.  Let's not pretend we know.
The sad thing is that his blind support of Trump cost him his life. Would love to ask him, ‚Äúwas it worth it?‚Äù

Do you think Joe Biden fights back the urge to puke each time he calls POS Trump "Mr President"?????
So Biden has never said and Chris Wallace held him to his bullshit!! So if Biden is defunding police then TRUMP IS EXECUTING HIS TAKEOVER OF THE COUNTRY AS A DICTATOR. Ps. Hope he is feeling good about killing Herman Cain!! #TrumpIsNotWell #Trump
Uh oh. This makes Trump look good. You might have to take this one down. Truth slipped into this tweet instead of propaganda?
Trump is a disgrace to America
You can express all of your opinions..  Trump bashing?  Thats easy.
I had this argument with my Trump loving family over this in the early days of the pandemic - they couldn‚Äôt understand how the two might possibly be connected. They just wanted to get back to normal üò¢
Excuse me, but how this goes is this: in the early stages of the virus, many European and American doctors published their findings that HCQ was helping treat COVID patients.  When everyone wanted a cure. President mentions HCQ.  And all you lose your shit because you hate trump.
In other words, they got nothing for Biden so they‚Äôre gonna wait until he announces his running mate and run against her.
It‚Äôs funny anyone who questions trump is on the left!! I would say these two are fair and balanced but still lean right but that‚Äôs ok they call out crap!
This is the wrong hill for you guys to die on. I can understand being a conservative, but trump is a madman and his attempts to win through causing chaos are killing people on both ‚Äú sides‚Äù - and there should not be sides, we are all Americans!!!
Why is left cause he questions trump?
Liberals like to fantasize a Trump electoral coup bc it is the disruption of a great ‚ÄúInstitution‚Äù (democracy) which is the worst injustice they can think of, and imagining fascism coming helps them escape the fact that they have always failed to stop or recognize the current one
I'd be sad if he wasn't recklessly at the Trump rally bragging about sitting in the crowd right before testing positive.

No  we should treat them like people walking around with blindfolds and chainsaws. They are stupid , a danger to themselves and others ‚Äî and belligerent about it. Very embarrassing to be an American in trump times
It‚Äôs funny no one even said anything about supporting trump you just assumed because the tv trained you on what to believe and how to react. Very effectively.  Skedaddle Joe . you‚Äôre a goner. You‚Äôre successfully brainwashed on a virus favoring based on beliefs or venue üòÇ
And a significant portion of those supporters are unstable people, armed to the teeth and willing to do anything for their Dear Leader.  Donald Trump will never go peacefully into the night. He will need to be ripped out of the Oval Office root and branch.
Prediction: Donald Trump will lose in November.  And then all hell is going to break loose.  The vast majority of this country has no idea how dangerous our foreseeable future is.
Haha.. Pretty funny statement coming from a gullible Trump supporterüòÇü§£üòÇü§£
Trump supporters really need to take stock. Laying his personality which is clearly not ‚Äúpresidential‚Äù to the side. Objectively, what has he done to make this country better, safer, or more prosperous. GDP is down approx 40%, &amp; the gov‚Äôt has no uniform plan to fight a pandemic...
People aren‚Äôt dying because of Trump their dying because DEMOCRATS don‚Äôt give two fucks about the police and rioting, but Trumps wants to stop the KILLINGS IN DEMOCRATIC STATES and he‚Äôs to blame? Sad

I also didn‚Äôt see millions in damages, months long racial divide, and multiple innocent civilians killed in any ‚Äútrump supporter‚Äù protests. Can‚Äôt say the same for BLM. Nice try though bud.
Not to undermine your larger point in any way, but there has always been a fence around the White House, and the plan to raise it to 13 feet predates the Trump administration.
Exactly. The press is allowing Trump to do this. Shame on them.
tRump is not Hitler. He is a Charlie Manson wanna be. He‚Äôs killed a lot of people, but he will never, ever, meet his elemental goal which is to divide our country along racial lines. Not on my watch, yours? Stand.
No one in press calls trump out to his facewhen he states that 2020 will be the most rigged election. No one says to his face that mail in voting is not fraudulent. Not one member of the press will state the obvious to trump, that 2016 was rigged and Hillary should be President.
If it isn‚Äôt obvious.  Trump is trying to lay the groundwork to say that the results of the election can‚Äôt be verified due to election fraud.  We need to make this the biggest landslide in the history of the US, like bigly, like no one has ever seen.

If they don't strongly stand up against him delaying the election, we as a nation need to revolt and get every single one of these Trump loyalists out of office.
Herman Cain is the only person we know of that's attended a rally, contracted coronavirus, and died. Trump is continuously endangering people.
tRump and his followers are idiots and usually at fault.
Dems choosing to vote against the $600/wk stimulus check is questionable. Millions of people need that money and the entire market is at risk to collapse as a result. They just want the economy in shambles so Trump loses.
Donald Trump, you stupid fuck, the GDP dropped 9.5%, the largest decrease ever, on your watch.  Neither you, nor any of your dumbfuck supporters, can bring up the economy as one of your bragging points.  You were a pathetic fuck-up at business, and you're even worse as president.

Correct. Just as there is the extremely occasional instance of in-person voting fraud. As you‚Äôve said, nothing is foolproof. And Trump has chosen this election to be concerned enough with mail-in voting fraud that he‚Äôs floating changing the election date. That‚Äôs not justified.
Nope, Trump broke it; it's ours, the #TrumpVirus

I love your perspective on this Brian. We should've seen this coming.  But I honestly think Trump is acting authoritarian out of raw vanity. I flatly think he's not smart enough to be an autocrat. But I understand journalists can't say he's just dumb.
Don‚Äôt kid yourself trump is balancing between trying to look tuff and his pandering
Trump takes word of Putin on election medaling after of our intel says they have and doesn‚Äôt bring up American bounties. Holds secret calls with Putin. Dod pulled out of armes agreement to test a bomb which now has Putin testing an even more lethal one!
Trump is afraid the election will be stolen from him by smart people.
When u have the facts u argue the facts. When u have the law u argue the law. When u r tRump u just make things up and hope that the deplorable believe it. So sad.

Do you know how many others receive ballots that aren‚Äôt theirs? Do you know how many attempt to use them illegally? The answer is: practically no-one. You can look up the stats. Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù are baseless and a transparent attempt to deligitimize the results should he lose.
Especially if trump doesn‚Äôt get elected.
Also for the record it's importanat to say: vote for a candidate you believe in, biden isn't the only option, think about voting for the green party nom Howie Hawkins and then if trump still wins in November remember... direct action is more than just voting

lots of people still use it for voting. why, even Trump used it -- yes, he voted by mail in the last election.  If it's good enough for him, it's good enough for us.
I‚Äôm voting for the Supreme Court. I‚Äôm waiting g for Trump‚Äôs list and that will be the determining factor of whether I vote for

Seems to me what's really happening is a desperate man trying to make excuses and hold onto power any way he can. The only reason to delay the election is that he knows hes currently getting owned by Joe Biden. And ppl dont even like Biden they just want Trump gone that bad

Trump was gonna cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, but the bone spurs prevented him.

Trump actually appeals more to Hispanics than any rep before him. Trumps policies aren‚Äôt the issues. They are actually well liked. It‚Äôs him. He drives people away. He makes people like you vote in direct opposition to all your beliefs just because Trump bad!  He‚Äôs broken you

I was just thinking this when I read that tweet and then the infinitely wise  said exactly what was in my head.  When republicans die of Covid, we laugh. When Democrats do, we blame Trump.
Oh, I thought that was Trump's hair being prepared in the morning.

Like Trump, the late Herman Cain lied on his Twitter account.
BS, I'm in NY &amp; there's still plenty of Trump bumper stickers, house signs etc... no violence or vandalizing happens to them!
I agree with people when they say Trump is a master of the media.  He tweeted today about delaying the election knowing it‚Äôll be the top story over the biggest drop in GDP in US history.  He can‚Äôt delay the election even if he wanted too but it distracts from worse news.

That's exactly what I DON'T want in a president. What's next: "I just ordered a nuclear attack on North Korea" followed by a smiley face tweet: "JUST KIDDING!  :)" CORNYN. IT. WAS. NO. JOKE.  The real joke is Trump and the enabling GOP.
Not at all,  but I'm also not voting Trump...I'm voting none of the above because that should be a choice on the ballot when your choices suck....
nobody voted to bailout trumps business partners, or move our troops around Europe, harass Russia with low yeild nukes in Poland, or bomb Syria, or posture thru the hormuz/SCS and sanction the entire world ILLEGALLY. We voted for free and fair trade. Fuck Trump and his pipelines.
Do you think Trump is smart?
Trump, always thinking of others, just as his niece described in her book.
President Trump has totally trolled never Trumpers with his Election Day tweet. Neil Cavuto is losing his f...ing mind! Beautiful thing to listen toüòÉ

Very sorry you bought into the Trump misinformation train. RIP.
A tough mama bear! I believe that Joe Biden will bring us together do a great job he did as VP and clean up the disaster trump has done from taking away Regulations to our virus and our economy he has experience he‚Äôll have strong women behind him helping all the way! Vote 11/3/20
Herman Cain is fed up too. Oops, no he‚Äôs not.  He‚Äôs dead because he opposed common sense Covid protection at a tRump rally just like you did.

Of course Trump did not confront Putin about the bounty on US soldiers. Putin has only to look at Trump‚Äôs cowardly avoidance of military service to spot a coward. Now Putin OWNS Donald. Trump is Putin‚Äôs little toy puppet!
and if you want facts of why he shouldn‚Äôt ban these countries well let‚Äôs see if the seven countries trump singled out terrorists from these countries haven‚Äôt killed a single person on US soil

You do understand he's a stutterer all his life?  So now we're going to mock his handicap.  Makes sense that you'd be a trump supporter.
Trump is completely humorless. He is never kidding.
He has to interrupt John Lewis service. What a disgusting human Trump is.
Unfortunately they won‚Äôt be able to vote because trump is trying to delay the election!
Trump lose the popular vote when before all this happened. He's losing even more now. In Kentucky and a couple other Republican-run states they remove voting areas and force people to wait in line over 8 hours to vote in person. The right has to cheat to even have a chance.
Pompeo even told Dem congressman when asked if trump could delay the election..." the justice dept.will have to see about that"  or similar words
Just heard -- now that Trump is not going to pay people more to stay at home than they would get from going back to work that Cuomo is now going to take OUR tax $ to compensate those in the city so they continue to get the same. He NEEDS TO GO!!!
By tomorrow (maybe later today) Trump will double down and say he wasn‚Äôt joking. That‚Äôs the way he works. Tweets something outrageous, Republicans say he was just joking/trolling, doubles down.
You can‚Äôt blame the Trump Rally for killing Herman Cain. I mean that literally: wasn‚Äôt every attendee required to sign a liability waiver?
Donald Trump isn‚Äôt a president, he‚Äôs not a leader, he‚Äôs not somebody to be admired or followed. To the contrary, John Lewis was a great man and a great leader. Trump has no business at that funeral and he knows it. He won‚Äôt be invited to future gatherings either. He‚Äôll be in jail
Between this and the Clyburn thing, Bill's basically just doing a Trump speech
Watch for Trump to double down by tomorrow (maybe later today) and say that it was not a joke.
5 min later in an interview, Trump will say it was not a joke.
So you openly believe, with no evidence, that Obama isn't American despite seeing a birth certificate, but also openly believe that trump is great despite the obvious corruption and lies?
Herman Cain died because he went to Trump's rally
Trump is literally on camera in an interview saying he didn't look into it, and that it never reached his desk so he didn't read about it. Even the smallest hint of American soldiers being killed should have meant an investigation.
You know trump spent more on golfing in his first year than Obama did in 8, right?
What‚Äôs worse: I know a USPS retiree who supports Trump and won‚Äôt acknowledge this. Our society is too naive, blind, or just ignorant.
Your all brain dead,, been the plan along...we will be a dictatorship, hes basically given Europe to Putin, by removing troops, and china and north Korea can have the far east,and trump left to have america
LMAO how is it a scam when trump himself is admitting it's worse than he thought? And wearing a mask?
"we would" lmfaoooo you're actually using an assumption of what could have happened, but didn't, in comparison to the actual bad job and thousands of deaths caused by the incompetent trump administration? Did you inject bleach? Did Obama call the swine flu a hoax and ignore it?
LMFAO what evidence of that is there? Because there's a LOT of evidence that trump is corrupt like pepper spraying church goers for a photo shoot, not releasing his tax returns, golfing when Americans are dying, having taxpayers like you and me pay for him to use his own Hotels..
To bad guess he shouldn‚Äôt have listened to Dr Trump and chuck Wolerey

Remember when Trump said he wasn‚Äôt afraid of the NRA and he would do something on gun control? That was a good one.
...well, let‚Äôs do the math. One thing is a fictional being, annnnd the other one seems to also be a fictional being. So, by my calculations, you are most likely a Trump supporter.
He‚Äôs not voting for Trump. He HATES Trump and feel he has ruined the office of POTUS.
Wonder if Herman Cain signed the Trump rally waiver
#WeWillVote   Dump Trump!
Did you ask  what he thinks about Trump floating the idea of postponing the November election? Waiting for WNY media to get Jacobs on record.
Exactly what it is being used for now. To get Trump out of office. I am now convinced of that.
=&gt; In the Trump era, the truth is often ghoulish, but suppressing it is repugnant and totally unacceptable. #HermanCain
Your right , and the election wasn't postpone during the Spanish Flu, when millions of people were sick and dying. Trump does love starting chaos and as we all know he can't be trusted, he may try to pull something...
I‚Äôll give him this though-Trump‚Äôs complaining we may not have a definitive media call on election night creating a potential catastrophe of uncertainty because states will be too busy counting mail in ballots for weeks/months is kinda like what I‚Äôve been warning about all along.
Mark obviously just does this shit for show. He couldnt care less about John Lewis. Trump did lower the flag and his response was respectful anyway. He followed some good advice. If you dont have anything nice to say, then dont say anything at all.
I wonder if Trump can be charged with murder in Herman Cain‚Äôs death? Oh wait! Trump had everyone sign a WAIVER absolving him of legal liability. Folks, here‚Äôs an idea: if your candidate makes you sign a waiver absolving him from murdering you, you may want to rethink your choice!
i‚Äôve said it once and I‚Äôll say it again FUCK DONALD TRUMP
Yes it is. How do you feel about  trying to cancel the upcoming election? BTW, I notice you‚Äôve voted in lockstep w/ trump on every unqualified judge  has put forward.
Trump is using this to leverage a decision to force the issue on mail in voting. Give this time. Trump usually wins these battles.
I was referring to the person who posted the "thank god" for trump thing - not your comment.
Apparently only votes cast for Trump should be counted.
The difference is: You don't have the power of the presidency.  Trump is POTUS right now. And Trump seems bound &amp; determined to wreck the country rather than cede power to the Democrats when he loses the election. And the whole GOP seems determined to support him in that cause.
I know politics is a lot of smoke &amp; mirrors, so help me out: is Trump floating the idea of delaying the election a distraction from the latest abysmal economic numbers or a distraction from Herman Cain dying of coronavirus after attending his Tulsa rally?
President Donald Trump suggested delaying the 2020 presidential election on Thursday, tweeting it will be "the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history."
#WeWillVote - saying Trump is a terrible leader and human being doesn't even begin to describe things
GREAT article from April by Jonathan Turley, excoriating Biden for his absurd suggestion that Trump might try to delay the election. Turley calls out this baseless and ‚Äúcrazed‚Äù conspiracy theory, and *puts finger to ear* stand by: I have breaking news.
Relying on John Roberts to turn his back on Trump is a sign of just how fragile our democratic republic has become under Trump.  And the fact that no-one in the GOP will hold Trump accountable paves the way for the US to become a dictatorship under Trump.
This isn‚Äôt accurate. If Trump wasn‚Äôt president Cain would be alive. I appreciate you treading lightly but now is not the time. Lives are at stake
I didn't know Covid knows what party to kill and what party to save.  As a libertarian like myself how do you think Covid thinks of us  ?  Well come to think of it Trump did say the "enemy for intelligent"  referring to the Virus.
Killed by trump - great job
Legally they can't do anything. But when has that stopped Trump?  Legally he can't extort other countries to invent dirt on his political opponent. But he did that &amp; got away with it.  Legally he can't profit from emoluments. But he's been doing that for 3 1/2 years now.

Trump knows his reign will end in November- which is exactly why he wants to delay the election. He's scared. He's a coward. #VoteHimOut2020
He attended Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis. #Trumpvirus killed him! Literally!
Biden warned that Trump would try to delay or postpone (not "stop") the election, which is exactly what Trump floated today.  The fact that you are trying to Both Sides this is ridiculous.

Not trying to play stupid.  I just can‚Äôt get on your level of reality because, frankly, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre on it.  Taking issue with a drug touted by doctors who used it successfully to treat doctors solely because trump advocated for it is the height of bias.
Trump voters represent the worse our society has to offer
Ohhh yeah this tweet from Trump stinks of desperation. This is as close as we'll probably get to him admitting he knows hes in big trouble on election day.
Herman Cain is getting ratio‚Äôd on his own death tweet because he didn‚Äôt wear a mask to a Trump rally, caught coronavirus, and died lmao ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Herman Cain really sacrificed himself just to go to a Trump rally.  Sad.

Too stupid, just lying. Or just making it up.....That is the entire problem with Trump--trying to figure out which statement defines him at any one time
I know John Lewis was your best friend and all, however President Trump may not have such a huge man crush on him as you do. Its okay isnt it? Maybe the dems can start impeachment proceedings...
So, in 1932, congress predicted that someone like Trump would try this stunt, so they passed the 20th amendment. It took 88 years for someone dumb enough to actually broach it.
Trump is so brilliant at using  leverage. He has the left in freakout mode. Freedom=Trump!  #Trump2020 #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder

Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
Eww Donald Trump retweeted his own tweet. Also eww, he‚Äôs destroying this country.
150,000 Americans DEAD                      Putin put Bounties on American troops.                                                      trump whines about HIS popularity.      Economy completely destroyed.          Selfless? Hardly . Narcissistic, Incompetent, Traitorous, Racist!
mr.trump you're A COWARD OF THE LOWEST FORM! you have no decency when you can't even confront Putin on his paying mercenary's in Afghanistan to kill our soldiers! Why don't you resign!
For Trump to not ask about the claim when speaking with Putin and to dismiss it as ‚Äúfake news‚Äù without proper investigation is, in itself, a violation of his oath of office. It is also completely unsurprising and further evidence that Trump is Putin‚Äôs Manchurian candidate.
Trump, Barf, and McConnell will see them in hell.

There is something insidious about the stock market today.  You will hear "Markets plummet due to Trump tweet" Wall Street is a club. Once in a while the retail investor needs to be taught a lesson. "Get back in line, son." Institutional investors and machines control markets.
‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs tweet came shortly after a report was released showing the U.S. economy shrank 9.5 percent from April through June, the largest quarterly decline since the government began publishing data 70 years ago‚Äù

President Donald Trump proposed delaying the election in a tweet on Thursday, but only Congress has the authority to delay the election.
Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election - BBC News.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
The feedback loop from Trump‚Äôs tweets to Fox News (and vice versa) to elected Republicans is fascinating and will be studied for years to come. The Democrats have nothing quite like it.
No, the  cannot delay the presidential election without a change in law.
150k dead from the Trump virus. Worst quarter in GDP in history.
Trump: Schools MUST reopen, its safe to do so...
So Trump stays in power until pandemic is over. This will incentivize him to continue dragging feet, prolonging pandemic, increasing death toll, more economic carnage. Good plan.
Indeed, knowing sooner would have made a big difference. Delay of leadership from the Trump administration has contributed to the now 150,000 deaths from covid. We are going to have to VOTE our way back to being a covid protected healthy nation.
Thank you President Trump!!What goes around comes around I have no sympathy for Caine's who died 2day who was a trump supporter I have yet to  hear trump extend any sympathy for his demise.  Have you which proves he is  racist.

you have lost your integrity as a journalist and your humanity to sociopathic partisanship.  Your comment on Herman King‚Äôs death was that he could have caught  it at Trump rally.  What happened to you Chris?
#morally #challenged #detached #unfit #republican #anglo #male what do we have to lose? 32.9% #GDP biggest #quarterly decline on record.  Republican Elected Officials #spouses #drumpf #trump #presidency is ruining the #suburbs.  He‚Äôs going to bankrupt this country if you let him.
I think you mean ignorant and i'm not the ignorant one. Please do some research. Trump might say some crazy things and he's a narcissist but he's a real American and has done great thi ngs for this country.
I feel like the parents that want their kids to go back to school, are really saying please take this child off my hands. It's been 3 months and i can't take this kid anymore!  If Trump not sacrificing his kid's life, why sacrifice your child?
We would all like schools to reopen - We‚Äôre not idiots. But it‚Äôs not safe. No one wants to gamble with their child‚Äôs life. Trump is killing people by the thousands. He won‚Äôt care if he adds a few children to the mix.
Every time Trump says something idiotic   tries to claim it was just a joke.
Because they're all in the same corrupt pedo child trafficking group. Their day will come. People don't like Trump because he knows to much. He even said he used to be in the club and wants to expose them for what they want to do to America.
You don't look at what a president says you look at what he does and Trump has done more for this country than Obama.
Trump is not sending his kid to school so why be stupid and send your kids?
What you are doing is special pleading, exempting politicians (Obama) you agree with from the very standards you set for politicians (Trump) you disagree with.  It's also opportunism.

I agree and he left in place the mechanisms for a lot of what Trump amped up.
This makes the teeth grit in anger. Because Mike Singletary aka Samurai Mike should be treated with the utmost respect. Trump is a d-bag. Nothing more, nothing less.

Trump looks bad on his own; he needs no help in doing that.
A hoax the way it‚Äôs being used by democrats to blame Trump like he brought the Virus here. You are the partisan‚òùüèæ. Every‚òùüèæof them that died knew the risks. It‚Äôs a choice they made as adults &amp; truth be told nobody knows if aüò∑ works so get off your soapüì¶. Herman Cain was a giant!
She gets paid to cluck üêîüêîüêî about Trump.  It's insufferable.  Makes me wince to hear her ill-thoughtout and self-righteous drivel.  I'm embarrassed for her.  Race-baiting is the best card she has oh, so I can't blame her for playing it, I'm just embarrassed for her.
So lets tolerate trump. Cool?
But you do care. You use it so more people hear what you say. But there's a line between use and misuse. Make friends. Talk, ask questions. What we do here is mainly about connecting. It's not primarily gaining followers. Many such as yourself may not even care about numbers.
Former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has died after Covid-19-related complications. Cain's death comes weeks after he attended President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
These people will grasp at opportunities to jump ship &amp; try to save their reputations but only if they‚Äôre losing. If they‚Äôre winning they will continue to ride the wave. The wave is crashing &amp; they want off. Remember who they are while supporting Trump, it‚Äôs their true selves.
Hermain Cain went to a Trump rally without a mask. Republicans just don't get it and now he's dead. That's the tweet.
Are you talking about trump or Biden
A million Republicans decided not to vote for Trump today, if not more. This was a suicide mission and it's clear the party will not go down supporting him. A monumental mistake.
The media should have ignored Trump.
How about the trump family and all republicans send their kids back to school, the rest of us will wait and watch how that turns out before we send our kids back.
Trump is undeniably immature and nuts.  Other countries must laugh at us for tolerating him.
I am a Never Trumper.  He is unfit. He's a coward.  Trump is a clear and present danger to the people of the United States and to the Constitution.   In short he is depriving a village of an idiot.
Thought you are a journalist. No president, including Trump, has the power to delay election.   A suggestion is not an action. I'm sick and tired of people who are masquerading as journalist but in reality a partisan political journalist.
I think you‚Äôre the one who is blind! Did you not hear the divisiveness that came out of Obama‚Äôs mouth earlier today, in what was supposed to be a funeral, he turned it political. The man hated and destroyed America, then a tough guy like trump comes in and the sheeple can‚Äôt.....
If Obama is a ‚Äúgreasy politician‚Äù what does he call Trump privately?
I hope you don‚Äôt have any children cause that would not be good!!! Your touting 56% as if mom wants their kids back in school. Sadly that is not the case!! This mom can‚Äôt wait for  to be the next president and Trump a distant albeit horrifying memory!!
I thought Trump said he knew it was a pandemic before anyone else.
We got trump because racist white uneducated men were upset that we got a Black President.
Trump is manipulating it!!
EXACTLY!!!!!!! THIS IS WHY THE MEDIA HATES TRUMP AND IS TURNING EVERYONE AGAINST HIM. TRUMP IS A HERO, HE GAVE UP HIS LIFESTYLE TO BE THE PRESIDENT FOR FREE TO GET RIDICULED BY THE PRESS AND BY A BUNCH OF IGNORANT ASSHOLES!

If Biden wants a female VP, he should pick one from a state that Trump won in 2016.  Biden's VP will be pro-abortion, no matter whom he picks.   If he picks Harris, it remains to be seen if the left keeps quiet because of her record prosecuting drug offenders.
It‚Äôs not the post office, it‚Äôs the Trump mega donor who he hired as the post master who is calling all the shots in mail delivery now!! This was done purposefully so mail in voting ends up benefitting Trump!!!
Trump has yet to get COVID but came into contact with multiple people who had it.. there‚Äôs a cure obviously
I'm sure he does feel some shame. He's given interviews about it, in fact. For a year+. Save the criticism for those who still stand by Trump. When defectors from enemy powers come to our side, we welcome them. We don't say "Now you're defecting?"
Creepy Joe will finally be able to sniff her hair!
I am concerned that Trump is carrying on about VBM as a cover-up, but knows he has the postmaster in his pocket!
So, no mention of his mask less attendance at Trump‚Äôs rally? No lesson learned which might be discussed for public wellbeing?
Before we all start jerking Dubya off, let's be real. Much of what Trump is now doing can be linked to the Bush administration. Bush created the organization currently picking up citizens in unmarked vans. He lied us into a war that is still going on now. C'mon!
Trump's future will be in Federal Prison, not the White House.
Someone thought of him doing that to try and take the heat off of Trump!

you replied and I quote, "Yet he still acted quickly." I countered with, (the travel ban had holes.) he acted impulsively, that what he did. and calling it the Chinese virus is just wrong and for you to sit up here and give tRUMP credit for his hubris is maddening. shame on you.

We had a 33% drop in the GDP, the worst ever recorded and this is all BS to distract you from the fact trump and his  , broke America. Literally and figuratively.
Yeah... Trump never said Covid itself was a hoax. He referenced it in his state of the union address. Even Snopes says he didn't say it like that, you need context in your life. Also, Trump doesn't run states individually. That's why we have Senators and Governors. Blame them.

Great list. Plus his choice of Russian oligarchs and convicted drug dealers as tenants for Trump Tower. Plus he bought a yacht from an arms dealer and had to sell it when he bankrupted the Plaza Hotel.
Maybe we should have elected Cain. He turned a business around in 14 months. Trump destroyed ours in four.
So the GDP shrank by an unbelievable 33% and it‚Äôs already out of the news because trump purposely tweeted about delay the election and that‚Äôs all MSM cares about. This country is done.

It doesn't matter what Trump or Barr says about the date of the election. Neither has any control of it. Only the Senate can vote to change the date.
Trump just said some of the American people are stupid when it comes to mail in voting. Such a great president.
Trump finally got his wall.
OMG, Trump is pathetic.
Of course Trumpism is a cult. Trump is the consummate fraud and perfect cult leader. His cult members are easily brainwashed and not too bright. Just listen to any of them. It is bizarre.
Even after serving 8 years as POTUS,  still continues to show the world why is a great president. I can‚Äôt say the same or remoteky close to anything good about Donald Trump.
Even his lawyers no he lies:    #NobodyLikesTrump Really #NoOneLikesTrump
I don‚Äôt know, feels more like a dog whistle to distract everyone from the latest news on the economy.  If Trump is a master at anything it is getting everyone to talk about him.

Trump is a traitor. He doesn‚Äôt hide his allegiance to Putin. For him to do nothing about  Putin putting bounties on our troops‚Äô heads should be grounds for removal. He has no conscience nor love for this country. He has to be removed.
Didn‚Äôt Trump once tell Sarah Palin that a chain joint in Times Sq. Was genuine NY pizza. Wonder about his sophistication of his NY Pizza judgment. Bet he never had old Gloria‚Äôs In Flushing.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a "delay" to November's presidential election.  But the dates of presidential elections are set in federal law, and cannot be changed except by Congress.
And suddenly - the 2nd quarter GDP numbers are out of the news cycle. Trump is taking candy from the journo babies.
COVID-19 tanks U.S. economy in second quarter, outlook shaky   We are right where the democrats want us, so they can blame it on Trump, but they will fail because everyone knows Trump boomed the economy before and he'll do it again.

No, that‚Äôs Trump. He thrives on dividing this country &amp; making sure the GOP hates Dems. Such a petty man who strikes out at anyone who doesn‚Äôt kiss his ass &amp; genuflect to him. There r no surprises with him. Only way he wins is if he cheats. #NobodyLikesTrump

Is trump still taking Hydroxychloroquine?????
The only deception being tweeted is by Trump &amp; Co. He keeps pushing drugs (don‚Äôt u anti-vaxers hate these drugs? Btw) that do not work &amp; keeps telling u that u don‚Äôt need a mask. Unfortunately, he is lying about HCQ. He is deceptive about masks. Shitty leader
Well that is a true statement. The Dems didn‚Äôt politicize this virus...Trump did. Now, thousands of ppl r dying because of his politicization and incompetence when dealing with COVID19.  Trump loves the word ‚Äúhoax‚Äù so much &amp; u just start salivating when he uses it. ü§î
This whole nightmare is just going to go on and and on. The country NEEDS to be shut down again but there is NO way Trump will do that. He has stopped listening to REAL doctors.  So, sadly, this will continue into 2021 when - God and our votes willing, Biden starts to change it.
Well, tbh, Trump wasn‚Äôt in office to screw everything up until recently. #Biden2020

No, the drug was not donated to the government. They had to pay for it. That‚Äôs y Trump is pushing it so hard. He‚Äôs trying to get some money for the 63 million doses he can‚Äôt move. He can‚Äôt move it cuz it doesn‚Äôt work. Get your facts straight.

Massive hypocrisy from this clown shoes who whines daily about Bernie voters not voting for Biden. I'm voting for Biden in NY and not happy about it, so grow up or you just want Trump to win
This is from March (AGAIN) when Trump was lying to us about the amount of cases coming into our country. Stop trying to spin reality. It just doesn‚Äôt work. U r blocked &amp; reported for spreading lies.
Trump doesn't deserve to be retired. He deserves to be imprisoned for crimes against the United States. He should be stripped of his citizenship. The people of the United States should not have to continue to pay.
They really ‚Äúown‚Äù‚Äô it for sure. Now what? What is Trump going to do to conquer it? I mean, what does it really matter now? Fix the problem instead of finger pointing. So much more mature &amp; productive to fix it.
Trump needs to be arrested for violating his oath of office and committing atrocities against the people of the United States.
He did not stop travel from Europe UNTIL it was already here... I have facts on my side. Your POTUS is incompetent &amp; no amount of name calling will change that. Trump is STILL not handling this virus...what is the hold-up?
Never will America buy that this is on Cuomo...NEVER. This is all on Trump. Every last death is Trumps. Watch what happens in November. There will be a hefty price to be paid.
March 9th...yep, back when the POTUS told America that it was going to disappear like a miracle. Cuomo went off Trump‚Äôs intel info. Be better.
They were going off Trumps numbers...U know when he said 15 cases would be 1 soon?  In the end, Trump had the intelligence &amp; he created the narrative that governors &amp; mayors went by until reality hit.  Lowly governors had to go off Trumps intel info. Nice try though.
Listen, Trump has access to intelligence that NOBODY else had...facts. Ant your buddy blocked me cuz it‚Äôs an inconvenient truth that Trump dropped the ball early &amp; often.

So, there you have it: Jimmy Carter did not throw a first pitch at the 1979 World Series, despite many, many outlets reporting otherwise.  When people (myself included!) say Trump is the only sitting president since 1910 to not throw a first pitch, tell them they're wrong.

Do you think that Trump is aware of the likelihood that he will never receive the love and respect, nor the heartfelt eulogies John Lewis received.

Doesn't have the power... right. And Trump doesn't have the power to drive on the left side of the road, because those two yellow lines will stop him!
thinking about becoming culturally significant for tweeting something about how Trump must sit on his own balls eleven times a day and immediately calls Jared to yell at him about it
Part of me hopes you are right about this. It would be incredible to see Trump drag the whole party down with him.
This is slightly off topic but I'd just like to comment -- Trump "adored" Herman Cain?   That's a normal statement for a grown man to make about another grown man, right?
Don't remind him. Trump reads this tweet as "he died for you." Trump probably loves the idea of people dying for him--it feeds his ego.
Trump goes golfing while America's ship is sinkingüö¢ Remove the  #CareerCriminal in WH!!
I‚Äôm sure he feels no guilt over this despite it being widely regarded that he contracted COVID at Trump‚Äôs OKC rally

Never put Red Bull in your coffee.
Actually you got that backwards. It is the libiots that destroy property, not the conservatives. We believe in people being responsible for their actions. Oh, and Trump will win by an even greater number.
Any tweets from Trump yet? Hope this drags on through November 3rd
The voters are plotting a coup to unseat Trump!!

This is one very logical explanation.   The main point has to be, though, that Trump's pandemic failure is absolutely deliberate.
Your boy is just making excuses for when he loses. He won‚Äôt accept defeat . You‚Äôve heard trump speak. You really think he‚Äôs all there. I mean we all now he has the best words and knows more about everything than anyone ever etc
Dear baby Jesus. Trump looks like he‚Äôs about to devour an entire 13 year old girl!
Mr. Trump, you are no Abraham Lincoln.

It‚Äôs very straightforward. Wear a mask, wash your hands, physically distance. Why would anyone listen to Trump calling it a hoax?  America can‚Äôt flatten the curve!  It‚Äôs a conspiracy, alright!  I asked a magat to explain why America can‚Äôt get a grip on Covid. Crickets.

I think you're agreeing with her, as that was the whole point of her original tweet -- and her objection to Trump's.

Sounds counterintuitive and politically suicidal, doesn't it? Until you realize that Trump probably views their deaths as collateral damage - unfortunate but necessary to preserve his brand. #HermanCain #COVID19
States run the elections. State officials have already said the elections will proceed as usual, in the ordinary course by law. Trump knows he‚Äôs going to get crushed and he is trying to distract from the #TrumpVirus and the #TrumpDepression
Wow now trump trying to delay elections voting due to death of Herman Cain who died from coronavirus after suffering a month with it and black voice for trump as well showing love at his campaign without a mask, hope this will be wake up call for trump and take Covid Seriously
Only congress can delay election day! Not you! Not Barr! Not Trump! ONLY CONGRESS!
Yeah they wouldn‚Äôt even show up at the White House and your executive order.  John Lewis is being buried today but to the racist orange egomaniac trump is the only person in the world.  Loser.
üí©eater for trump.  Fool.
33% decline in GDP in the 2nd quarter. Economy collapsing due to Trump's incompetence. Vote him out.
He doesn't need a majority to wreak havoc. Check out some nightmare scenarios here:  If he can just skew the vote, he can declare the whole thing bogus &amp; try to get SCOTUS or the House--voting by State!--to choose the POTUS.
I'm so sorry for Herman Cain's family &amp; friends that he contracted &amp; died from Covid. It's truly tragic. However, I will not mourn a man who helped package &amp; sell Trump's lies, incompetence &amp; inaction on the disease which has sickened over 4M Americans &amp; killed at least 150K.
TRUMP: It‚Äôs too dangerous to have an election.  ALSO TRUMP: Of course it‚Äôs safe to send kids to school lolz
Fair amount of Republican members of Congress have rejected Trump's suggestion that the election should be delayed.
Yup, and states run the elections. Trump can pontificate all he wants, but the election will be held and the winner of the majority of electoral votes will be the winner. If red states want to follow his lead and not hold the election, they just won't be counted.
. weighs in on the Trump tweet suggesting a delay of the presidential election.  Important context from
President Bill Clinton, who took office more than 27 years ago, in 1993, is younger than both Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
Glad you are voting straight R!   Thank you.  But think about it Trump walking down slippery ramp slowly was a thing to the left. So getting assistance from a nurse should be a HUGER thing yet crickets from the left.
I'm saying, How? How does it lead to Prez Pelosi? All Trump has to do is convince a few GOP Govs/Statehouses to choose their states' electors by fiat rather than by popular vote, "for the safety of the voters", &amp; it's bye-bye democracy.
Cuomo on Trump's postpone-the-election tweet: "The president speaks about a lot of things that he has an opinion on. The things I tend to pay attention to are the things he has legal jurisdiction to do."
Trump Virus...own it
We take it for granted that voters choose the electors, but that part of democracy is not enshrined in the Constitution, a loophole Trump is bound to try to exploit. #TrumpIsTheEnemyOfThePeople
Ignore Trump‚Äôs lies and distractions. He knows he‚Äôll be crushed in the election.
Trump floats November election delay, but it won't happen.
Mr. Nadler, Trump is merely RECLAIMING HIS TIME

Herman Cain is dead and Trump is advertising Pizza üçï
No only an act of congress can. But if it makes everyone feel better, we can have Nov 3 and the Trump supporters get to vote on November 31st!
Herman Caine died of Covid after claiming it was a hoax and proving himself wrong by not wearing a mask to Trump's klan rally. He can fuck off in hell.
So are you saying Trump is directly responsible for Cain's death?
It‚Äôs the trump virus. TRUMP virus.  PLOP GOES THE DONNY!!
It is Trump and the Republikkkans that have politicized the issue. The rest of us are it as common sense

Terrible. He really shook up the 2012 primary in an interesting way, showing that non-politicians can change the dynamics.   However, this just goes to show the whole Tulsa/no mask rally was insane. This is on the Trump campaign.
Trump is an idiot plain and simple

President Donald Trump suggested delaying the 2020 presidential election on Thursday, tweeting it will be "the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history."
My goodness. Did he contract the virus at Trump's ill-advised rally?
She has at least 4 bodies on her, for sure. Five, if you include ‚Äúwe came, we saw, he died *cackle*‚Äù Ghadaffi. I suppose that we can link her to the deaths that her Middle East policy wrought. The arms sales to Al Qaeda in Syria/ISIS.  I also blame her for forcing Trump on us.
What Trump is saying is: I know I am going to get crushed.
It'd be unproductive to spend time calling Trump &amp; his propaganda tweet INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT. Thinking people already know that. What we need to discuss &amp; plan for is how we remove Trump in the most peaceful way possible should he lose the election &amp; refuse to leave office.
Oh look Trump wants to delay the election what a surprise
I think 4 years of Trump with unified govt in Congress could have gone one of two ways: --a marked shift further towards authoritarianism --the complete implosion of the GOP.  I think the past two years, we've got a taste of both.
Time for Texans to wake up before trump totally destroys it!
Democrats should raise the possibility of moving the elections up, so trump can‚Äôt do anymore damage to America!!
How about Trump is sent to Walter Reed and have a tube shoved down his rancid mouth opening? Think that would give him a sense of urgency? Probably not-he'd take it personally.
You mean 5 years ago? Trump said it was one guy coming in from China, or we have 15 cases that will go down to one. How could all of this mayhem transpire in only 5 damn months?
Trump can't delay the election; only Congress has that power.  He's trying to distract from this:
Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election - BBC News
Hate Trump.
This is Trump and every idea he comes up with before literally anyone who works with him says, ‚ÄúUh...that‚Äôs idiotic, impossible and illegal.‚Äù
Trump: everything's fine; kids need to go back to school; everyone back to work.  Also Trump: things are so bad, we're going to have to postpone the election.
Trump has violated the constitution more times than Jeffery Epstein violated children.
So Trump wants to delay the election due to a corrupt mail in process. He wants to delay the election due to a national emergency until such time it is safe for people to go out and vote. He also believes the country should be open and schools open full swing. WOW, just wow
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
After trump‚Äôs suggestion of delaying elections, Democrats should suggest early elections to rid trump from causing more damage to the country!!
If my father was Donald Trump I'd be hammered every minute of the day.
It's Thursday, so that means Donald Trump, the President, is shining his golf clubs and ready to leave tomorrow for one of his overpriced pretentious shit-holes. Who needs the 5-day work week anyway?
The trump offspring must have given her lessons.
like i know everyone on here likes to treat trump as some sort of aberrant entity but if you look at the numbers he's pretty much just a dumbass that says the quiet part out loud. he hasn't meaningfully expanded executive power - hell, the muslim ban is basically torture memo 2.0
Still no mask mandate, plan, or shutdown of Texas, California, etc. Trump makes me sick.
Trump has a glow about him-a radio active glow.
Will say and do anything...AP News: Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to November‚Äôs presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
The lack of self-awareness in the Trump family is staggering.
Trump thinks Eric is a waste of blue eyes. They‚Äôre rightfully Ivanka‚Äôs.

As far as I‚Äôm concerned it took balls too come out like that! And the destruction of her credibility is scary as shit! Personally I have ben listening too the few since the beginning because I can clearly see the contradictions. And president Trump needs too put an end too this!!
Yeah...I know that now. But it's still troubling to see the way that it happened. In the middle of a peaceful protest. Given the BS that's going on in Portland, and Trump's threats to send his goon squad to Democrat-run cities, it's easy to see where the outrage came from.
I thought Tim Allen was trending because Trump got him confused with Tim Apple.

Hospitals were never overwhelmed, ventilators are plentiful, masks are everywhere, and death toll is 10-20 time LESS than what was originally predicted by the scientists and experts (except in democrat run places). So, is Trump your guy in November?
New post: "Trump administration urges justices to allow continued border-wall construction"
Many of Trump supporters are two time Obama voters. Also, it's quite telling that you seemed to have completely forgotten about him in your article. I guess those eight years are just a vacuum void?
Forget his severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. How about his op-Ed‚Äôs and tweets trashing Nick Langworthy, the NYGOP, and the Brooklyn GOP? How does this help our party and unify us to win??
Now we know what Trump and Putin talked about last week.   Putin said to start getting US troops out of Germany now, before you lose the presidency.   And Trump said, "Yes sir, right away."
Donald Trump‚Äôs repeated victory of destroying the independent life, will be a complete triumph of dishonesty, of unpredictable darkness. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
One way to rig an election is by programming the vote-counting machines to count only a percentage of one party‚Äôs votes, while over-counting the other party‚Äôs votes. It is of interest that the patent for one recent model of the vote-counting machine is held by Ivanka Trump.

Wtf is trump up to while we‚Äôre all talking about this?
Not astonishing at all. Anyone who pays any attention knows Trump is a corrupt traitor. Putin OWNS Trump. Trump would literally be broke without dirty Russian money laundered through Deutche Bank.

Why are you making statements like Trump is going to jail? It's not happening anytime soon. Please don't excite people for nothing.
That was about Cuomo. He dug New York 6 billion into the hole before Covid, and directed nursing homes to take Covid positive patients, adding 1000s to Ny‚Äôs death tally. Even taking your assessment of trump as true, it would have been much worse with a similar national directive
Worth revisiting today...Personally I prefer NAZI because that‚Äôs what Trump is! Instead of Jews he‚Äôs going after minorities. Instead of the gas chamber he‚Äôs using COVID-19.
Trump should have consulted with the Fair Housing Act secretary. I know he does not like to read. It is illegal to descriminate against people of color. Trump company made billions from their low income apartments.  Trump company settled and paid the fine.
Rewatching 30 Rock and came across the episode where Jack tells Trump he does his hair using a cotton candy machine...phew
In 1973 Trump company was sued, for housing for descrimination. They coded applications with a "C" for colored. They threw away these applications. Trump management made billions off low income apartments. Trump is trying to scare suburban dwellers for the same reasons.

Even if Trump ties up the vote count in court, He and Pence are out on Jan 20th if there's no clear result.  The Speaker of the House would be sworn in and be acting President until the results are certified one way or another.

This Wuhan coronavirus started back in January. School districts have had since January to get ready but what have they done nothing. President Trump does not control the schools each city or state does. Blame  superintendents for having many months to fix it and doing nothing
All Trump supporters? Eh, roll the dice.
Or they could die. Sad reason to lose a Trump supporter.
Trump could start by not saying the virus would one day disappear like pixie dust and that we have the virus under control when we didn‚Äôt. Or maybe take proper action when he was informed twice in January. Or not deem it a hoax. He‚Äôs been an incredible failure regarding this.
Top Republicans reject Trump's suggestion to delay election

Something about the democrats destroying the worlds ozone by pushing the narrative tht global warming is a hoax, or maybe tht Trump was instrumental in the abolishing of slavery. Some Cockeyed BS. They have more plot twists then Dark.
And this isn‚Äôt solely a right or left thing. But in the age of Trump, it isn‚Äôt neutral either. Climate deniers and anti-maskers are exclusively right wing phenomena and conservatism has been hollowed out by this type of thinking.

U.S. Backs Down, Allowing Michael Cohen to Write Trump Tell-All Book
We can argue whether that stutterfuck of a President is better than Trump (God bless this man) until cows come home. But we won‚Äôt.
Who is voting him out?  You speak for all Americans?  And you Dems call him arrogant?  Don‚Äôt underestimate the silent majority.  I am team Trump all the way.
I created this after he spoke  George wallace 1965 Trump 2020
Right. President Trump is way better.
Right because you can‚Äôt compare Donald J Trump and Barack. The first one is my president and the later one is history.

Wonderful timing on the part of the author, who admits that people look at him crazy for suggesting it, to release it on the same day Trump starts talking out loud about not having an election in November.
I wonder how many will vote for him anyway
Today Vanessa Guillens mother met with Trump and Univision was the ONLY channel I saw that televised this meeting. DO BETTER AMERICAN CHANNELS. JUST BC SHE WAS HISPANIC DOESNT MAKE THIS TOPIC A HISPANICS ONLY PROBLEM.
Trump is watching the  John Lewis funeral service. He again said, out loud " why don't people love me like they love  John Lewis"? Silly üêá, tricks are for kids.
And Trump is so much better ???üòÇ

Worst case I think is enough GOP governors bag the elections in their states to prevent Biden from getting to 270, then GOP-majority state congressional delegations in reinstall Trump, with scotus upholding
Trump Thursday.
They told Trump Herman Cain just died and trump asked does that mean another black person will be moving to the suburbs. Not funny RACIST!
Mayor Bloomberg did the same as a favor to GWB when Oprah had guests on who were perceived as anti Iraq war. Trump‚Äôs interview at the Lincoln Memorial was timed to distract from the best episode of 60 Minutes ever...
I think Trump‚Äôs frail ego held out as long he could until he realized #FoxNews was going air the eulogy part with President Obama.
Another black man with the conk mentality. Could have done so much for his people dies and Trump ain‚Äôt even acknowledged his existence.
Listen to "THE ELECTION IS NOT RIGGED SHOULD NOT BE DELAYED" by THE DEREK VARSALONA SHOW. ‚öì  No President Trump the election is not rigged. You must accept the results of the election even if you lose in 2020. Listen to my Take on THE DEREK VARSALONA SHOW
With every tweet, Executive Order or unlawful misuse of power, Trump is showing all that an election is irrelevant. He‚Äôs not leaving until every Democratic leader unites and make him irrelevant. Do it now. New impeachment hearings, subpoenas and ENFORCEMENT.
You have proven to be wrong. Classic Trump. Looking for a distraction. Always blaming something or someone, when you are being liar-in-chief. Surprised that you didn't blame Obama. Try as you may. You can't disrupt voting in America.
#wewillvote for for Donald trump
Herman Cain could have saved his own life if he didn‚Äôt attend the rally.  Trump is at fault for treating this virus like a joke but people have to be held accountable for their ignorant actions.
For everyone saying Trump *can‚Äôt* cancel an election, I think we are way past what what he can and can‚Äôt do, legally or otherwise.  It is what he *will* and *will not* do, and what the craven, evil Republican Party will go along with.  If the past 3.5 years have taught us...
To believe that your property value will go down is unproven. However, racism is still alive and well. Trump is trying to stoke fear about the very thing that his family made billions on. Ownership of low income housing
ONLY 86% of polled 2016 Trump supporters will be voting for him in 2020. Self-identifying Republicans are down. Yes, the Cult of Trump is enthusiastic but it is increasingly looking like an impossible statistical needle to thread. #WeWillVote
Your denial is showing again. Trump tweeted out that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to throw the opening pitch on the 15th even though it wasn‚Äôt agreed upon. No date was finalized and officials scrambled when they realized his schedule was full that day. Trump‚Äôs fragile ego exposed again.
You‚Äôre absolutely right! Trump shouldn‚Äôt care. So why did he feel the need to lie about the Yankee invitation?
He literally had to sign a death waiver to go to Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa. It‚Äôs like a real life Dethklok concert.
Such a shame that Fauci has embarrassed Trump so much on this issue. Donald has such a fragile ego. Trump even lied about being invited by the Yankees to throw the first pitch because he saw Fauci do it. Trump has no credibility whatsoever.
You can thank trump. #TrumpIsKillingAmericans
Well, Trump did brag about passing a cognitive test that required him to identify animals, so good on him for not relying on medical-related experts, I guess? üòÇ
When the Fair Housing Act was put in place, qualified Black families  began to move, "up on the hill", in my hometown. Afterwards, Whites moved further out from the city. Housing. Black families moved to those areas when there were homes they wanted to buy. Trump stoking fear.
How is trump destroying the USPS? Please tell us. The USPS lost 8billion last year continuing its streak of THIRTEEN straight years losing money the high being around 13 billion a few years ago BEFORE trump. Seems like the actual facts say the usps is destroying itself.
He's a real sick bastard.  He has me blocked because I enjoyed harassing him too much.  Ask him why his sister was maintaining a server in Trump Tower before the election.  Ask about his friendship with Maricopa County Assessor who copped a guilty plea to trafficking minors.
In light of Herman Cain‚Äôs death, I‚Äôd like for you to read the list of quotes of Trump regarding the virus back in March. Scroll through these without either laughing out of his sheer incompetence or getting angry for the same reason. #TrumpVirus
Any virus would have exacerbated Herman‚Äôs condition, but the virus that did just that was the same virus that we‚Äôre in the middle of a pandemic over. He didn‚Äôt have any other viruses until he went to the Trump rally, and since died. But Trump shouldn‚Äôt have held it to begin with.
Trump's violation of the Fair Housing Act, reminds me of growing up in a town (Akron Ohio). Realtors did what was called "redlining". Black families could not live in what we called "Up on the hill". Realtors   did not show well qualified Black people houses there.
What kind of good intention comes by saying a virus will disappear? That‚Äôs baffling, but I know you Trump supporters would also probably support anything he does, no matter how stupid. Trump said we had the virus ‚Äútotally under control‚Äù on January 22nd. 150K deaths later....
Sorry. I‚Äôm sickened by the praises for GWB and Reagan. Never forget that Reagan said he believed in ‚Äústate‚Äôs rights‚Äù in Nashoba County, where Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner were lynched. And Bush is responsible for way more deaths than tRump.
What he is doing is racist. He will also be in violation of the Fair Housing Act. The Trump family made Billionaire on the backs of low income renting. Now he wants to do the opposite by trying to stoke fear in residents suburban communities. Interesting....
Trump is America‚Äôs Stalin.
Trump is out of his mind.  #TrumpIsKillingUs
But remember, it only sounds correct when at a Bruse concert and you've had two of the overpriced 16 oz. Budweiser's in the shitty paper cups. üòÇüòÇ

You got it right. That's the way they pronounce his name in Jersey. ü§£ü§£ü§£
I think so especially at Bruse concerts. üòÅ
I can only speak to my knowledge, the Trump family's  in low income housing law suit.  There were certainly thousands of landlords across the who  violated the Fair Housing Act. I spoke to the Trumps because he is stoking fear about low income housing in suburbs.
Nobody needs media influence to form an opinion on Trump. All you have to do is listen to him.
No, he's right Jersian's slur his name, Bruse!

Trump can‚Äôt delay the election, experts say - The Washington Post #TrumpThreatensAmerica
And Hearman Caine is dead of the trump virus along with 150,000 fellow Americans.
Emporer Palpatine, i mean Trump wants to delay the US Election. this guy needs to get out of dodge. i am so done with him. Basically he wants to be president for a few more years until he cannot stop elections anymore. #votegold #votejojorgensen #JoJorgensen2020
He joined a hundred and fifty thousand of our fellow Americans gone from the Trump virus
He wasn‚Äôt right about anything. Being a 74 year old immunocomprpmised man is all the more reason to wear a mask and not engage in risky behavior while in a pandemic. But as you see, ignorance has consequences, and he unfortunately paid the price. Trump‚Äôs rally killed him.
CJ, get your head out of the sand. No one‚Äôs celebrating. What people are trying to do is get people to take this virus seriously because it‚Äôs NOT a hoax, and you‚Äôre just acting as a shameless enabler of Trump even though his rally caused a death. Wake up and do better.
Excellent list and gotta live the Todd in there üëç
Hes a traitor and a coward... Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
2/ ... that are ruining millions of lives,  are screaming bloody murder over Trump merely suggesting an Election Day delay. Nice try, but we already have a lot of documented proof you don‚Äôt support democracy or the Constitution.
The only fake is the info coming from the Nazi Trump administration, who can't tell fact from fiction.
Trump‚Äôs rally literally killed someone. We should never forget this.
Some clever folks on social media have been posting sarcastic ‚Äúdelay the election‚Äù comments for months as a smart response to those Trump-haters who think shutting everything down is a great way to defeat him. Maybe now, the ‚Äúburn it all down‚Äù types will think twice
Unfortunately Herman was a part of the advance team for the Tulsa Oklahoma Trump rally. He is shown in a group of people. No one was wearing a mask.
Maybe if Trump didn‚Äôt need ‚Äúblack‚Äù for his Tulsa debacle , Herman Cain would still be alive.
Holy shit Donald Trump killed Herman Cain
I trust you to give us the truth, the whole truth &amp; nothing but, Madam Speaker Nancy Pelosi! Trump &amp; his people would never know the truth if it came up &amp; bit them!
It serves the fool right, &amp; I‚Äôll be shedding no tears for him whatsoever! Hopefully this is a wake-up call to Adolf Trump‚Äôs people, but I suppose that would be asking for too much!
Trying to talk to a Trump voter about literally anything
Don‚Äôt worry: I will NEVER give in to Trump supporters and/or MAGAts.
Classic Trump. Trying a distraction to take the light off his failure to provide leadership in the face of 150, 000 families who lost their loved ones to the Coronavirus. No empathy. No leadership. Shame on the liar-in-chief.
3/ ... and in Trump‚Äôs case, where everything he says is immediately opposed by the Dems &amp; the media, there‚Äôs a good chance his tweet will now be met with self-righteous calls for as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù an election as possible, complete with debates, conventions, rallies, etc.
2/ ... like keeping their nominee hidden, nixing a real convention, &amp; likely avoiding any Biden-Trump debates. So when your opponents are engineering a pretty strong strategy of destroying the rules, it‚Äôs a great idea to suggest breaking some too...
1/ Here‚Äôs why the  tweet suggesting delaying the election was such a smart move: One of the biggest threats for Trump in this election is the way the Democrats are getting away with breaking all the rules...
States have collectively written a letter to Barr, and Trump, saying that they want the federal goons out of their cities.
Trump thinks it‚Äôs safe for your child to go to school but not for you to go vote him out.
Trump created the worst public health crisis in US history due to poor leadership. Now he wants to benefit from it by delaying the election? If Trump ordered everyone to wear a mask and not allow States like Florida to open prematurely we would not have this resurgence of COVID.
Aside from the utter outrageousness of this, Trump does not have this power.
The only flare ups of the TRUMP VIRUS are in the USA thanks to you.  The only country that‚Äôs a disaster is our country and once again, it‚Äôs because of you.
As Trump is sending out his private army to attack peaceful protesters....
Police throwing peaceful protesters into unmarked vans is dangerous. Democracy continues to die under Trump.
Hell to the NO #Trump. No delay, no extra days in office so you and #MitchMcConnell can take another shot at #SCOTUS. Your days in office are tied to Inauguration Day 2021. Buh -bye. #NovemberIsComing and you can‚Äôt do anything to stop it!
They are dying on the trump hill all the ones he has good blackmail on. The rest left or retired already.
You need a better excuse! You can't continue to blame Trump Admin. All this unrest was going on B4 anyone one was sent there! Stop blaming others for your incompetence, you are a disgrace ! People like you are a danger to this country !  Try doing your job !
Read: Trump suggests nationwide voter suppression.
It‚Äôs cool, I was just wondering what the racist homophobic drooling moronic Trump supporters think of RBG, and now I know! So thank you, SenatorInsane!
This is dangerous.  Election Day is constitutionally protected.  If the election is delayed Trump (and by extension, his conservative enablers) risks having a complete vacuum of power on 1/20/21.  The clear political calculus: The GOP needs to suppress the vote in order to win.
Please show proof that he is a pedo. Speaking of commies, why will Trump say nothing of Putin arming the taliban and even worse put bounties in our men and women of the military?
Coronavirus is getting close to becoming Trump‚Äôs Obama‚Äôs Katrina

Trump tries to win over suburban voters with racist rethoric .
Prediction: If rightful pressure rises against Adam Silver to resign, he will shift the focus off of him by making several anti-Trump statements. It's an M.O. that the news media falls for every time since former Broward County Scott Israel used it after the Parkland shooting
If Trump was fighting the military industrial complex, he would cut the military budget. Instead he increases it every year. This move is simply to insult Merkel and please Putin
Totally. I am not at all comfortable with the chaos we are devolving into under your party‚Äôs leadership. All Trump-supporting GOP must go!
Judge, I am voting for trump again, I live in NY

You can't trust any of these Republicans. Donald Trump owns these pathetic FOOLS. That's their Cult leader and they will all vote for him eventually. Republicans will always be Republicans. Don't trust any of them.
Shocker! It‚Äôs a Cult. And it‚Äôs the same  cult as the Trump Cult. It has nothing to do with Morality, it has everything to do with being white and entitled....
Our economy just took the biggest hit in history, thanks to incompetent trump! He will bankrupt the country like his casinos!
Wow, his stormtroopers are inside the federal courthouse, how is it they saved all of Portland without leaving the premises? Trump is delusional!
Hopefully they start by firing all the idiots that trump hired!
Trump must be stupid, absentee voting is by mail, not carrier pigeon!
that tweet you sent out last night w/Trump caught on hot mic. Did you delete or twitter? I saved it and tried to share it but says been deleted?
Trump lying again!!Media knows mail in voting is safe and secure. In fact,  they hear even trump knows it because he votes by mail!!
Paying tribute to Nazis. So on-brand for a Trump stooge.
Johnson is a corrupt Russian stooge just like Trump #July4Moscow
Whoa, whoa. Why the hate? Nobody attacked you. But if I lived in a swing state I'd hold my nose and vote for a Dem for the 1st time ever. Literally anyone is better than Trump. Joe Biden, Joe Budden, Joe Montana, Joe Mantegna. Anyone.
Sorry!
PS I do t believe those polls like o do t believe Trump polls. They are all lefty‚Äôs who are polled. I live in Albany and Siena has polls all the time. Never in 25 years have I been polled. Fuck Cuomo.
I don't want to find out... But can we send everyone off that way from Trump Administration on Jan 20,2021?
Yeah, it was all staged. The Trump-Barr Goon Squad was just a huge, illegal photo-op. The jokes on them though. Turns out, Americans don‚Äôt want armed thugs invading their citified and terrorizing their citizens. Morons
Pompeo is a corrupt thug. He was owned by the Koch Brothers and he‚Äôs a Trump stooge.

True story. I saw a neurologist today &amp; I was given some of the same Qs as Trump. I did ‚Äútoo well‚Äù on the test because I knew the answers.
At some point trump gonna realize his behavior killed a ton of his voters. It‚Äôs gonna be hard to steal an election if your voters are all deceased
If you had to choose between Trump winning in 2020 or Rosen being the QB, who would you take?

Why is that they put it?...Should not be moved? It can't be moved. Dosent this just give Trump the idea that it is possible?
His presence would be a disgrace. He doesn‚Äôt belong in the presence of Rep. John Lewis, the living embodiment of righteousness &amp; decency. Trump is a foul stain on Democracy. I‚Äôm relieved he‚Äôs not there; it would distract from the celebration of a great man who deserves only love.
Trump is Upset He wants Answers, and He ll get Them!
Pompeo-Trump-Barr, the entire corrupt Regime, the entire corrupt Republican Party have absolute contempt and hatred for real Democracy.
Trump Calls Out the Red Cross without saying a Word! The Us Flag üá∫üá∏ Swallows theirs as their corruption is about to be revealed! Hattie
Do you think that Trump is aware of the likelihood that he will never receive the love and respect, nor the heartfelt eulogies John Lewis received.
Read Mary Trump‚Äôs book.
thinking about becoming culturally significant for tweeting something about how Trump must sit on his own balls eleven times a day and immediately calls Jared to yell at him about it
I‚Äôm sure he feels no guilt over this despite it being widely regarded that he contracted COVID at Trump‚Äôs OKC rally
When trump yells ‚Äúit‚Äôs rigged!‚Äù  üôÑ dude. We know.
Your boy is just making excuses for when he loses. He won‚Äôt accept defeat . You‚Äôve heard trump speak. You really think he‚Äôs all there. I mean we all now he has the best words and knows more about everything than anyone ever etc
Dear baby Jesus. Trump looks like he‚Äôs about to devour an entire 13 year old girl!
It‚Äôs very straightforward. Wear a mask, wash your hands, physically distance. Why would anyone listen to Trump calling it a hoax?  America can‚Äôt flatten the curve!  It‚Äôs a conspiracy, alright!  I asked a magat to explain why America can‚Äôt get a grip on Covid. Crickets.
Trump &amp; Bill Barr right this very minute...
States run the elections. State officials have already said the elections will proceed as usual, in the ordinary course by law. Trump knows he‚Äôs going to get crushed and he is trying to distract from the #TrumpVirus and the #TrumpDepression
I think Trump supporters should feel free to boycott the election if they don't feel it's safe to vote.
Glad you are voting straight R!   Thank you.  But think about it Trump walking down slippery ramp slowly was a thing to the left. So getting assistance from a nurse should be a HUGER thing yet crickets from the left.
I would literally rather have to carve my vote into my own shit and walk it to the poll booth than delay the election. Fuck you Trump. Ya orange prick
Ignore Trump‚Äôs lies and distractions. He knows he‚Äôll be crushed in the election.
I have had the Mary Trump book for a week but haven‚Äôt read a word. Seems a deeply sad tome. I‚Äôll get to it, maybe this weekend.
Herman Cain is dead and Trump is advertising Pizza üçï
Herman Caine died of Covid after claiming it was a hoax and proving himself wrong by not wearing a mask to Trump's klan rally. He can fuck off in hell.
She has at least 4 bodies on her, for sure. Five, if you include ‚Äúwe came, we saw, he died *cackle*‚Äù Ghadaffi. I suppose that we can link her to the deaths that her Middle East policy wrought. The arms sales to Al Qaeda in Syria/ISIS.  I also blame her for forcing Trump on us.
What Trump is saying is: I know I am going to get crushed.
Time for Texans to wake up before trump totally destroys it!
Democrats should raise the possibility of moving the elections up, so trump can‚Äôt do anymore damage to America!!
So Trump wants to delay the election due to a corrupt mail in process. He wants to delay the election due to a national emergency until such time it is safe for people to go out and vote. He also believes the country should be open and schools open full swing. WOW, just wow
After trump‚Äôs suggestion of delaying elections, Democrats should suggest early elections to rid trump from causing more damage to the country!!
like i know everyone on here likes to treat trump as some sort of aberrant entity but if you look at the numbers he's pretty much just a dumbass that says the quiet part out loud. he hasn't meaningfully expanded executive power - hell, the muslim ban is basically torture memo 2.0

never Trump asshole Trump 2020 haha you corrupt fuck
Hospitals were never overwhelmed, ventilators are plentiful, masks are everywhere, and death toll is 10-20 time LESS than what was originally predicted by the scientists and experts (except in democrat run places). So, is Trump your guy in November?
Many of Trump supporters are two time Obama voters. Also, it's quite telling that you seemed to have completely forgotten about him in your article. I guess those eight years are just a vacuum void?
Yes, we do know. Putin owns Trump
‚Å¶ This article reveals Jr getting his skull bashed in.
There was never going to be a V shaped recovery üìà according to most experts. Note: Donald Trump is definitely NOT an expert.
Haha.... Were you trying to get a head start before Trump retires down to Florida. I know we are glad he left NY.
Yeah it's truly sickening...I hope Biden campaign just keeps drilling down he does not want to defund police.... This is all Trump is has got. Scare tactics &amp; playing on racial fears. We are at a time of racial Justice/reconing &amp; growth and this man is truly a monster!
Wtf is trump up to while we‚Äôre all talking about this?
Not astonishing at all. Anyone who pays any attention knows Trump is a corrupt traitor. Putin OWNS Trump. Trump would literally be broke without dirty Russian money laundered through Deutche Bank.

I'm not worried about the Russians after  the election We can fuck them 50 different ways! Trump should worry though! They don't play fair!
donnie is still touting  the ineffective hydroxy chloroquine even after Fauci told him to shut the fuck up!  Trump better pay attention,  Fauci might deliver him the kiss of death!
I'm pretty sure that most Americans, " the intelligent ones " know that trump and the Republicans are killing Americans and destroying the economy! Proof is in the pudding! Watch the news!
I wonder what Trump has to say about them üßê
And a crony who holds a lot of stock in UPS and Fed Ex. They grifting and self-dealing never end in the corrupt, rancid Trump Regime.
What a move! Thank you president Trump!!!
That was about Cuomo. He dug New York 6 billion into the hole before Covid, and directed nursing homes to take Covid positive patients, adding 1000s to Ny‚Äôs death tally. Even taking your assessment of trump as true, it would have been much worse with a similar national directive
Worth revisiting today...
What about pushing ballot drop boxes?  I‚Äôve never seen one but both parties are fans.  Trump may lose his appetite for the PO if it looks like there‚Äôs a work around, fingers crossed.

my own personal opinion based on the fact that he is 79 years old, Makes Trump sound intelligent when hes not on script and hear very little from him as he is locked in the basement until needed
Hope Trump isn't putting that crazy demon lady in control of vaccine development. He was extremely impressed by her, don't think I've even heard him give such glowing reviews to Dr. Birx
Really? You wish Trump had killed tens of thousands of nursing home patients unnecessarily and incurred a lot of debt before locking down the economy for months?
We all know why. Putin OWNS Trump.
The Trump-Barr Goon Squad? This is illegal. This is Trump and Barr taking cues from Putin, Ergodan, MBS. Sickening.
It‚Äôs sickening what they have done behind OurBacks! Trump Holds the Bible and The Flag! Bill of Rights!Constitution! He fights for Us, ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù
But you think trump is telling you the truth.  Delusional.
So the Trump-Barr Fascist Goon Squad is taking its show on the road? They are going to terrorize another American city? Outrageous and Illegal.

What's surprising is trump isn't wearing a sailors cap and suit wearing medals in gold sunglasses wanting to be called general.
....days after attending the Trump rally ignoring guidelines about masks and social distancing
Unconfirmed: trump sat up in bed for the first time today watching fox news when his bucket of KFC was delivered.  A tv tray was set over him that the bucket was placed on.  Cabinet gathered around and commended his fortitude.
It‚Äôs been proven right. Muller report, senate intel committee this year run by republicans. Russia helped trump win the election.
You will, hell I can give the results now trump 1, Biden 330 million...
after trump‚Äôs presidency is done, how many minutes until silicon valley banishes him from the internet?
Our allies intel agency's confirmed Russian bounties but trump &amp; gop say there is very little to go on.  Sidenote:  also confirmed.  But the guy screaming at phama ads on tv telling u to believe the opposite is correct.  Same person brought u 150k deaths.
One less Trump Vote. May his soul finally rest in peace.

Looks like  endorsed candidate is not doing so good with the economy. If only Katko had pushed Trump and his party to take action back in early March. #Vote2020
We will see more mail-in voting than in previous elections. It is the Republicans' and Trump's worst nightmare.
Biden has been doing the wise thing: nothing. Whether it's him or his team advising him, he is just letting Trump hang himself.  Never interrupt your opponent when they're making a mistake.
Frankly, they deserve it. Never thought so many in Congress would just give up the Constitution so they could enrich themselves so blatantly. The entire gov't, even Post-Trump, faces a crisis of legitimacy. When the govt acts like this, why should we follow laws that oppress?
Biden staying out of the spotlight has worked to his advantage. Trump has been looking like a whiny idiot in public. All Biden has to do is bide his time.
I didn‚Äôt think Eric Trump knew what hockey was.
Biden because of the current circumstances.  People bringing up the 2016 election don't realize it was a different world then. Trump ran on an anti-establishment platform. Now he is the establishment. He has absolutely bungled COVID-19 and the economy is in weak shape.
Trump wants to keep as much of that cash as he can. It's "his" money. What has he paid himself now, $340M in less than 4 years? All his family - and their WAGs - are on the public dime, even those damn endangered animal killing trips of the "smart" son. It's all been a big hustle
Their polling has been fantastic (by Trump standards) this week-  YouGov has him practically neck and neck with Biden, along with Zogby, Rasmussen, and others
Almost every poll the past week, with the exception of Ipsos, has been very good for Trump.
Everybody needs to vote. This race is tightening up. Trump is almost pulling neck and neck with Biden.
The news for Trump has been consistently good this past week. YouGov has him back to 2019 levels. Idk why, it makes no fucking sense, but they do
You lost me at "Trump taken responsibility."
Here‚Äôs another local source. It‚Äôs the same shit people get on Trump about funneling campaign dollars to his businesses. I don‚Äôt like either.
Just like Trump
Trump is scared.
Trump is the biggest loser on the planet. He destroys everything. He‚Äôs killed 150k people destroyed the economy to where it‚Äôs worse then the Great Depression. He has corrupted the government and office of the president. Wake up trump is a disaster
Them poor people in Florida. First they elect that fucking moron Governor DeSaints. Then the other moron Trump moved down to Florida and unlished  the TRUMP VIRUS on them. Us folks NY were glad he‚Äôs moved BYE BYE!!!!

The scary thing about this assessment (besides it being right) is that it lays bare how similar Trump's end goals and strategies are to the rest of the party, regardless of how many times we try to pretend he's an outlier.

Crazy that a person that‚Äôs as brain washed as you works for any kind of school. Any person that believes anything trump says clearly isn‚Äôt very smart and is very gullible and delusional. Trump is a horrible leader he‚Äôs a fraud and needs to go. Open your damn eyes
Gotta love a fake tRump supporting Christian.
I hope the Senate and other Republicans will think about this. We can't risk losing our democracy by leaving Trump in office.   #TrumpThreatensAmerica
If the right plan was in place. If we had good accurate fast response testing. We don‚Äôt have that we have a moron President with no plans destroying the Economy killing people with his failed leadership that‚Äôs corrupting our whose country. Get a grip trump is a massive failure
Really he is and not the guy telling people to inject bleach the guy that held a tally against expert advise that killed Herman Cain. The moron trump that still won‚Äôt wear a mask when we have 150k dead people the worst economy in history. Get a grip you‚Äôre brainwashed

Good evening,Ricky. Sweet dreams. I wonder what would John have thought of Trump..ü§îü§ìEileen
He is not still your president. Trump is. If you are not sure, check for the picture of the president at your local post office or other government office.
That is our system. Trump will only be president for 8 years because Biden doesn't know what planet he's on.
John Lewis skipped out on Trump's inauguration so....
Are you saying Trump isn‚Äôt?
Going forward I wonder if Dems will be motivated by the prospect of Trump 2.0 to take on possibly divisive issues at the expense of "business of the day" items.
So what? Dems have been claiming Trump‚Äôs presidency is illegitimate for over 3 years.
Its a world of Stevie Wonders and Ray Charles according to Trump.
Wrong, we see the Trump ship sinking, the economy tanking, and the pandemic spreading in America- all the result of Trump‚Äôs incompetence.
Wrong, ‚ÄúTrump virus‚Äù.
I guess people were right about Trump not accepting the election results. How hard he‚Äôs going now about delaying and litigation proves it. It also proves he isn‚Äôt fit for office.
On the plus side, this tells me that Trump is scared. He knows that his chances are getting smaller and smaller and he has to do any dirty trick he can to even hope to win.
Trump lied continuously today, lie after lie after lie after lie... Herman died because he went to a Trump rally. And #TrumpRacist did not attend the funeral of Mr. Lewis.
No, it is called the ‚ÄúTrump virus‚Äù in the USA, because Trump failed to manage it, and said ‚ÄúI take no responsibility.‚Äù
Trump is toast, he knows he is losing, and when he loses the election, many are coming for him. He is right that ‚Äúnobody likes me‚Äù. He is a liar and a criminal and incompetent. He will have to pull some spectacularly bad stunt that will test our institutions and our legal system.
Don't forget, two weeks ago this Sunday, Trump told Chris Wallace he would release a new Healthcare Plan!  I can't wait!  I could really use a new Healthcare plan!!

If congressional Republicans don't push back against Trump when he proposes a delay to the election with no rational justification, what makes you think they will do so if he refuses to acknowledge the results of that election?
Donald Trump is trying to sew doubt in our voting systems because he is afraid to face voters in November in the wake of his failure to lead our country through a national crisis.  Voting from home is safe, secure, and reliable. In this moment, it's necessary.

Responsible, no. Cain didn't have to listen to that fool, Trump.
How you know it was politically motivated was the fact that politicians were encouraging people to protest in close contact after telling people for months to stay home, then chided the Trump camp for having a rally for ‚Äúhealth reasons‚Äù as if the virus knew the difference
As much as Trump would like that, he put that Tweet out there to get tonight's news cycle to focus on that instead of the crappy economic news and the fact that he was not at John Lewis' funeral. Anybody who has passed 4th grade social studies knows an election can't be canceled.
Trump is probably sick himself. He seems so fragile, so scrambled when he speaks. He's still probably taking that awful drug that kills people.
All the protesters are trumpanzees.. Trump incites violence and domestic terrorism.. stick a fork in Trump!!! HE'S DONE!!!
The TRUMP VIRUS is getting worse everyday. Trump and the republicans need to GO.
RUSH: I'm not sharing this with you to frustrate you, folks. I think that the point here is once again the Democrats are not confident that they're gonna win this.
Hey suzy...stick a fork in Trump.. he's done!!
But only ‚Äòcertain‚Äô rallies. Certainly not a Trump rally
That‚Äôs great. But are you saying that none of the people out protesting without masks were high risk? Or that there was no chance in those interactions of being infected? To highlight Mr. Cain‚Äôs death because of the Trump rally is political &amp; ghoulish

The Trump economy: Worst quarter on record. GDP dropped $1.8 trillion. Record unemployment. Corporations getting richer while small businesses &amp; working families suffer.  Look around the world. It doesn't have to be this way. This is the result of his failed response to COVID-19.
I have decided that if I‚Äôm ever trump rich and am making a building, I‚Äôm calling it Maison Ducaq. Not up for debate.
‚ÄúTrump economy‚Äù: his failure to prevent, have a plan for, and manage the Coronavirus pandemic in the USA has destroyed the economy. The ‚ÄúTrump virus‚Äù has produced the ‚ÄúTrump economy‚Äù. He owns this. He has failed America. He should resign or be fired, as if this were a business.
The Trump nominee who is a founding member of the Tea Party Caucus and lied about WMDs in Iraq and terrorism in the Netherlands? Couldn't be. Doesn't add up.

More leadership in one speech than Trump displayed all his presidency
If you‚Äôre still a Trump supporter in 2020, you‚Äôre a sad human being
I think Trump is right to move the election. Democrats and Independents will vote on Tuesday, November 3. Republicans will vote the next day. It will promote social distancing too.
I'd be shitting myself if I was Trump!
Trump always tells the truth.  It's just that it's always wedged and carefully concealed between SO MANY LIES.
Trump is run by Putin. He does everything Putin asks. Trump is the biggest moron on the planet he gets played by every world leader. Removing troops from Germany only helps Russia
How can you honestly as an American even consider Trump as an okay candidate?

I thave tried toforgive any failures which may have occurred during his service to the country, that they were due to his own weaknesses and by no means intentional. I don't feel the same about trump.

Coronavirus denial can kill! Herman Cain, anti-masker and Trump supporter who attended Tulsa rally, dies from COVID 19.
the "its a joke" excuse is purely saved for the tweets that are so reprehensible even they cant back it but still dont wanna piss Trump off
For 4 years, Donald Trump has waged war on our democratic norms &amp; institutions.  This is the natural culmination.  But John Katko has lived through the same 4 years that we have, &amp; come to a very different conclusion: he endorses¬†Trump¬†for re-election. In #NY24, we've had enough.
in light of Trump‚Äôs tweet about the election I beg you to do what you did for the primaries and mail every registered voter in NY State an application for absentee ballot. It‚Äôs expensive, I know, but voting in 2020 is priceless. Please
To clarify, I can‚Äôt believe Trump suggested to delay election, and that the questions about ‚ÄúWho is the President‚Äú could be reality. Answer? Probably the President Pro Tempore.
Always wondered what it would be like to: 1: live in 1918 2: live through a Great Depression  3: live through civil rights protests 4: live under a corrupt dictator   trump has singlehandedly made me wonder no more #trumpsucks

Donald Trump broke his campaign‚Äôs record for single-week digital ad spending last week, purchasing an estimated $3,535,971 in ads from July 20-26.  More on Trump‚Äôs historic week in the Week in Review:

First overt move to "Trump the Dictator" - suspend the election.  Watch this space.
To quote Donald Trump ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù
Sadly this is what happens when you have a man that shouldn‚Äôt be any where near the White House leading. Politicizing a pandemic holding rally‚Äôs against the advice of experts. Imagine how many deaths trump and his admin have caused that aren‚Äôt as well know. Vote trump OUT. RIP
It‚Äôs not like Trump has a plan for the next four years anyway. He wants to stay out of prison, that‚Äôs the plan.
Normal people have been taking it seriously from the start bc we listened to scientists and not trump and his goons who were more worried about poll numbers then people lives. Open your eyes people this should of never happened if not for trump and his reckless behavior

You‚Äôre right, no one made Cain go to that rally. Ultimately, it‚Äôs on him. But I‚Äôd also add that nobody made Trump have an indoor rally. As President, he more than anybody else knew better. Just a senseless loss of life.

From a FB friend...  Joe Biden, April 2020: ‚ÄúMark my words: I think [Trump] is gonna try to kick back the election somehow.‚Äù  Donald Trump‚Äôs response: ‚Äú[these are] the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality.‚Äù  Donald Trump:
As long as the trump supporter I sit near at work doesn‚Äôt talk about trump or anything else political...she‚Äôs not that bad but I can‚Äôt get it out of my head that she must be racist and god knows what else to want to vote for trump again.
Trump has blood on his hands.
This is just Trump strengthening Russia in Europe. Please study the news, this has been vehemently criticized by both parties, this is not a partisan issue - this is a national security and strategic partnership issue.
And then 4 months later, Trump tries #ElectionInterference because he knows he will lose to #Biden2020Landslide
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
It‚Äôs funny how when Dr. Fauci says something that goes against what Trump believes everyone says he is lying. But when one pediatrician who believes some illnesses are caused by having sex with demons in dreams, everyone jumps on board and says we should listen to her.

President Trump only has himself  to blame for why the wearing of a mask or encouraging its wearing is seen as an inherently anti-Trump position. There didn't need to be sides on this issue. #COVID19 #coronavirus #publichealth #ThursdayThoughts
Do not let the growing conversation around fascism in the United States remain centered on Trump. Trump is certainly fascism's central avatar right now, but the Republican party openly endorses and encourages fascist rule at this point.
While I love you and always lean on your expertise Neal, we also thought everything else was impossible until Trump and Barr proved us wrong over and over again(not due to our own faults, but lack of oversight). I‚Äôm terrified ü§Ø
I hear a lot of this sort of cynical excuse-making for Trump but we *don‚Äôt* definitely know what other presidents were thinking so it‚Äôs not a useful comparison
We all knew you would try this tactic. Dictator Trump is afraid to lose the election!
Trump is a clear and present danger to the United States of America üá∫üá∏
"You know, Trump can't actually delay the electons" displays a confidence in our institutions that isn't reinforced by anything that has actually happened.
Trump staked his whole presidency and re-election on the economy. Even though the majority of people understand the economy would go down when trying to mitigate COVID, Trump cannot handle the news of the economy or discuss the economy in pandemic terms.
WHOA Did you miss the news that Trump Supporters stormed the Michigan Capitol? Did you miss the "Umbrella Man"? Rioters come in all political affiliations.
Sure üôÑü§° #DumpTrump Trump floats election 'delay' amid voting fraud claims
Absentee voting is also mail-in voting.  When Trump was voting absentee, wasn‚Äôt he mailing in his ballot? Or was  his fixer, Michael Cohen or someone else voting in person on his behalf? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
America first is exactly the same as Trump first. But I blame the Republicans for allowing this. The audacity to submit a bill w billions for wealthy people and complying with trumps idiocy to revamp the FBI building ( that we will pay for).What about the American people, Mitch?
Trump knows he can‚Äôt delay an election (or people around him know). The point of this is to distract and to bolster the ‚Äòwe wuz robbed‚Äô narrative when he loses in November. At this point, honestly, he‚Äôs best ignored. Focus should be on GOP lawmakers who stand watching, silent.
Hey All, Trump can't do the election thing but the speed with which we all stopped paying attention to the GDP numbers was remarkable.
Even if the delay the election tweets go nowhere. We need to take them seriously and rebuke Trump on this issue. Plus the GDP numbers are horrible. Economy shrunk 33%. So shit news all around today for Trump.
I think it's unlikely that Trump actually succeeds in delaying the election for real. I think it's more likely he tries to undermine American elections in any way he can up to November in an effort to increase cynicism and depress turnout. #Vote
Except when you are talking about civil liberties, intelligent pandemic leadership, following the Constitution, giving away $ to corporate friends of Trump &amp; having Russian bounties in the lives of US Soldiers.
It is critically important to not only support Joe Biden, but help every possible race down the ballot. Republicans have abdicated responsibility to put a check on Trump. All politicians with an R need to be voted out. ALL OF THEM.
Did I not say it?
President Trump floats election ‚Äòdelay‚Äô amid claims of voting fraud
What will probably happen: - Trump loses - Trump declares voter fraud and vows to investigate - Trump tries to contest the results and will not concede. - Trump will start doing more outrageous things up until  Jan 20 that could undermine Government.
Absolutely everyone expected in 2016 that Trump would float this. Make sure to #Vote in November.
All hands on deck. This is not a drill. Democracy is on life support. Just like white people ultimately must solve racism, the GOP has to solve our Trump problem.   WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS?!
So sick and tired of this bullshit from Trump and no Republican steps up to call it out. Each day brings a more outrageous suggestion that gets put up as a valid argument. Let's see the "both sides" of delaying an election to cover for Trumps horrible mismanagement.
Good think the majority is going to be so overwhelming even the GOP voter suppression won't stop us from booting Trump.
Trump is tweeting to divert the COVID crisis don‚Äôt fall into his bullshit
Yep, it was only a matter of time until Trump suggested the Election be delayed.  - Secret police - Delaying elections - Sucking up to strongmen dictators - Using race as a scapegoat - Pushing division on the population - Nepotism  Where have we seen this before?
Trump..YOU HAVENT BEEN DOING YOU JOB SINCE JANUARY 20, 2017!!!
He is with Trump, which nullifies the "for the constitution" part.
Well if anyone should know about fraud,it's trump

When you look at the trump family and all we have learned I've never seen a family so replete with monsters and demon sperm.  Generation after generation.  People like Mary are the exception in that family.
Lets not forget Donald junior holds fundraisers based on killing animals.   I suspect he fits the profile of a sociopath that is cruel to animals.  It's cool to be a killer in the trump family.  Means you aren't weak.  You're an alpha.
man sure would suck if trump got coronavirus üëÄ just tragic. üòÇ
Trump often says something is coming in the near future.  Why aren't there articles about it never happening?  Its a ploy he uses.  He says it to try and quell a news cycle and there is no follow up.  So it works.
Given the change in attitude by Lindsey Graham Ted Cruz.  The gop trips to Russia.  All the denying of Russian interference, the silence about bounties, etc.  Wouldn't any rational person come to the conclusion that trump and the gop are all compromised by Russia?!
Without a doubt we are seeing a very deliberate, methodical approach to creating an authoritarian government by trump and the Republican party.  All of these day after day attacks on democracy.  It's systematic changing over to totalitarianism. Like china, russia.
They will answer "yes". They've been given explicit permission to hate.  That's all a Trump supporter wants. Hare for what's good. Hate for what's fair. Hate for people that aren't part of their tribe.
Germany is one of our most important allies.  To hurt them, only hurts us.  Trump changing the structure will have consequences that weaken both of us.
When the pandemic first hit.  Many calls for an international commission to coordinate.  Trump pulls out of world health organisation.  All the while complaining they were left unprepared by Obama.  Red state leaders defy science.  Covid everywhere, directly gop leadership.
It's important to note trump &amp; republicans have never had a plan and have fought all efforts to have a plan.

I thought the same thing, then I saw an interview on MSNBC and read another piece on I want to say the Atlantic, where they said that they also wanted to get rid of all of Trump‚Äôs enablers so who knows what‚Äôs going to happen in 2022
Trump misrepresentation of what this means is ridiculous because even if we we weren‚Äôt in NATO we would still probably be spending highly on defense.

trump's crusade against AFFH is framed as objection to "low income housing". it's not hard to read between the lines.   but...  AFFH isn't about low income housing. it *specifically* addresses bias against protected classes.   no reading between the lines required. IT'S RACISM.
Trump‚Äôs version of the American dream is not having to share the same community as poor people... and he is proud of this.

Such a shame that Fauci has embarrassed Trump so much on this issue. Donald has such a fragile ego. Trump even lied about being invited by the Yankees to throw the first pitch because he saw Fauci do it. Trump has no credibility whatsoever.
What about the black man who was killed by another Blackman because he was a trump supporter?
Well, Trump did brag about passing a cognitive test that required him to identify animals, so good on him for not relying on medical-related experts, I guess? üòÇ
When the Fair Housing Act was put in place, qualified Black families  began to move, "up on the hill", in my hometown. Afterwards, Whites moved further out from the city. Housing. Black families moved to those areas when there were homes they wanted to buy. Trump stoking fear.
In light of Herman Cain‚Äôs death, I‚Äôd like for you to read the list of quotes of Trump regarding the virus back in March. Scroll through these without either laughing out of his sheer incompetence or getting angry for the same reason. #TrumpVirus
Any virus would have exacerbated Herman‚Äôs condition, but the virus that did just that was the same virus that we‚Äôre in the middle of a pandemic over. He didn‚Äôt have any other viruses until he went to the Trump rally, and since died. But Trump shouldn‚Äôt have held it to begin with.
I'm going to guess he's too busy eating **** to reply to too many people right now.  Trump could've been working with electoral commissions to ensure that votes/voting are secure but...  #whowouldhavethought #trumpthedisaster
My 2020 quest for America: I want ALL the racist and prejudiced bigots to reveal themselves before 11:59 PM Dec 31, 2020. I would rather know who the racist and prejudiced bigots are so I know how to handle them and keep it moving. Stop acting like Donald Trump will change.
Leftist liberal media circus show whose only aim is to discredit Trump
Some people need to stop waiting for Donald Trump to change his racist mindset. He is not going to attend John Lewis's funeral nor mourning for Herman Cain. Why do some people have a Walt Disney hope of Donald Trump becoming anti-racist? He is who and what he is. Accept this!!!
Trump's violation of the Fair Housing Act, reminds me of growing up in a town (Akron Ohio). Realtors did what was called "redlining". Black families could not live in what we called "Up on the hill". Realtors   did not show well qualified Black people houses there.
What kind of good intention comes by saying a virus will disappear? That‚Äôs baffling, but I know you Trump supporters would also probably support anything he does, no matter how stupid. Trump said we had the virus ‚Äútotally under control‚Äù on January 22nd. 150K deaths later....
Sorry. I‚Äôm sickened by the praises for GWB and Reagan. Never forget that Reagan said he believed in ‚Äústate‚Äôs rights‚Äù in Nashoba County, where Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner were lynched. And Bush is responsible for way more deaths than tRump.
What he is doing is racist. He will also be in violation of the Fair Housing Act. The Trump family made Billionaire on the backs of low income renting. Now he wants to do the opposite by trying to stoke fear in residents suburban communities. Interesting....
US: Former GOP Presidential Candidate, Trump Fed Pick Herman Cain Dies After Battle With¬†Coronavirus
damn waste
I can only speak to my knowledge, the Trump family's  in low income housing law suit.  There were certainly thousands of landlords across the who  violated the Fair Housing Act. I spoke to the Trumps because he is stoking fear about low income housing in suburbs.
Nobody needs media influence to form an opinion on Trump. All you have to do is listen to him.

Trump can‚Äôt delay the election, experts say - The Washington Post #TrumpThreatensAmerica
He wasn‚Äôt right about anything. Being a 74 year old immunocomprpmised man is all the more reason to wear a mask and not engage in risky behavior while in a pandemic. But as you see, ignorance has consequences, and he unfortunately paid the price. Trump‚Äôs rally killed him.
CJ, get your head out of the sand. No one‚Äôs celebrating. What people are trying to do is get people to take this virus seriously because it‚Äôs NOT a hoax, and you‚Äôre just acting as a shameless enabler of Trump even though his rally caused a death. Wake up and do better.
Herman Cain, a Trump-up, fmr Presidential Candidate has died from what his most simplistic President dubbed "Hong Kong Flu" and "China Flu" the #Covid19. Cain was infected at a Trump Rally ü§î

Trump out here killing people and he's trying to postpone the election
Hey, Herman Cain died today he was not wearing a mask üò∑ at Donald Trump rally in Tulsa Oklahoma. So deaths on Donald Trump watch is 151,000 dead Americans and 4 millions infected. Supporters of Donald Trump, how many more dead people you want?vote:Joe Biden for President
The only fake is the info coming from the Nazi Trump administration, who can't tell fact from fiction.
Trump‚Äôs rally literally killed someone. We should never forget this.
Unfortunately Herman was a part of the advance team for the Tulsa Oklahoma Trump rally. He is shown in a group of people. No one was wearing a mask.
I trust you to give us the truth, the whole truth &amp; nothing but, Madam Speaker Nancy Pelosi! Trump &amp; his people would never know the truth if it came up &amp; bit them!
It serves the fool right, &amp; I‚Äôll be shedding no tears for him whatsoever! Hopefully this is a wake-up call to Adolf Trump‚Äôs people, but I suppose that would be asking for too much!

President Trump appears to be suggesting that the US Elections in November be delayed due to fraud. The Trump administration has also gutted the postal services which would further hamper mail-in voting. November cometh.

4/7 It‚Äôs a culmination. Of what? Of Trump‚Äôs Nazi politics. Camps,  bans, raids, purges, institutionalized hate, paramilitaries and secret police ‚Äî all that‚Äôs a pattern. What does it culminate in? The next step of the sequence of implosion. The final seizure of power...
3/7 themselves, organize, protest, dissent, vote. Trump is instituting martial law right before a crucial election that will decide the fate of democracy in America for at least a generation. Probably longer. That‚Äôs not a coincidence...
Wow it‚Äôs becoming a common narrative. I brought up Candace Owens to a couple of my friends and one said the same thing. As if though a black Trump supporter can‚Äôt have their own mind. Are we all reading from a narrative painted by media?

(Yesterday) Biden is supportive of something called #BLACKlivesMatter AND has vowed to pick a woman running mate and likely a Black one for political reasons, rather than just picking the best person, and he says Trump is divisive? Yeah. Ok. YK
Classic Trump. Trying to  create a distraction. Let law enforcement handle protests. You  get busy by addressing our national crisis, the Coronavirus. Stop ducking and diving. Start leading ( which in this case you have lost interest)
Trump slept in January and February. When the scientific research community tried to wake him up about the Coronavirus, he said " leave me alone, wake me up in March".
Trump, let Pompao consult on the Germany situation. Classic Trump, grabbing a distraction. Get back to the Coronavirus. stop ducking and diving.
There is just not a single thing that Trump can do that will get your approval.   You had all the time in your life to try to take the toughest   job in the world  and be The Man.

But Governors can. They'd be breaking the law. But why would that bother the governors that are now killing thousands of their citizens at Trump's direction. Especially since it's Trump's DOJ that is responsible for enforcing the law.
I don‚Äôt think Trump really wants to change the Election Day,he just wants to say the election was rigged because if he loses he can blame it on absentee ballots being fraudulent. That would be his excuse.

I think you mean ignorant and i'm not the ignorant one. Please do some research. Trump might say some crazy things and he's a narcissist but he's a real American and has done great thi ngs for this country.
I feel like the parents that want their kids to go back to school, are really saying please take this child off my hands. It's been 3 months and i can't take this kid anymore!  If Trump not sacrificing his kid's life, why sacrifice your child?
We would all like schools to reopen - We‚Äôre not idiots. But it‚Äôs not safe. No one wants to gamble with their child‚Äôs life. Trump is killing people by the thousands. He won‚Äôt care if he adds a few children to the mix.
Omg wtf
I recall editorials in The NY Times early in his Presidency chastising those of us who compared Trump to a Nazi. How‚Äôs that lookin now!?
Every time Trump says something idiotic   tries to claim it was just a joke.
Because they're all in the same corrupt pedo child trafficking group. Their day will come. People don't like Trump because he knows to much. He even said he used to be in the club and wants to expose them for what they want to do to America.

I agree! A+?? lol Near the end of the interview, Ruddy's grade on Trump's corona crisis response was down to "a pretty darn good job" on the economy, the best part of his response. Sounds like his real overall grade is B- at best...at that's still a lie.
Ambassador your compassion for nazis elicited little support -  few trump supremacists and dutch nationalist party.  I suggest an apology to Americans who died fighting them and  Jewish who were tortured and exterminated by this evil regime.  I hope you read the comments
What you are doing is special pleading, exempting politicians (Obama) you agree with from the very standards you set for politicians (Trump) you disagree with.  It's also opportunism.

Former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has died after Covid-19-related complications. Cain's death comes weeks after he attended President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
These people will grasp at opportunities to jump ship &amp; try to save their reputations but only if they‚Äôre losing. If they‚Äôre winning they will continue to ride the wave. The wave is crashing &amp; they want off. Remember who they are while supporting Trump, it‚Äôs their true selves.
You lie like Trump
Hermain Cain went to a Trump rally without a mask. Republicans just don't get it and now he's dead. That's the tweet.
Are you talking about trump or Biden
A million Republicans decided not to vote for Trump today, if not more. This was a suicide mission and it's clear the party will not go down supporting him. A monumental mistake.
The media should have ignored Trump.
How about the trump family and all republicans send their kids back to school, the rest of us will wait and watch how that turns out before we send our kids back.

Oh I meant in 2016 haha. But yea if Bernie was up against trump this year we‚Äôd be in trouble.
Thought you are a journalist. No president, including Trump, has the power to delay election.   A suggestion is not an action. I'm sick and tired of people who are masquerading as journalist but in reality a partisan political journalist.
I think you‚Äôre the one who is blind! Did you not hear the divisiveness that came out of Obama‚Äôs mouth earlier today, in what was supposed to be a funeral, he turned it political. The man hated and destroyed America, then a tough guy like trump comes in and the sheeple can‚Äôt.....
So, the Trump campaign finally realized that their campaign images of their federal goons beating up Portland‚Äôs moms wasn‚Äôt a good strategy for winning the suburban vote...the 6 bankruptcies totally makes sense now.

Oh please lmao. They‚Äôd be on Fox News for 72 hours straight calling for his removal. But for trump? Nothing
Fearing Trump interference, FBI agents hid copies of Russia investigation docs
Just a question... Much like the Divine Counterparts are hated (mostly spiritually) but also highly protected... Do you think there can be a chance that trump is... I mean hey we all do our shit bud God is the one who Judges? What do you think about this?
That‚Äôs why trump keeps doing it because he can lie his ass-off like crazy with no push back they are all a bunch of fools
Sad that Herman Cain lost his life because of his support for Trump.  If he had just worn a simple mask he would be alive.  Not tragic just stupid.
Too bad it was the trump virus that did him in.
Trump grossly mishandled the US pandemic response and now we have 150,000 Americans dead. Period. Fact. If you still support Trump by this point, then you‚Äôre either brain dead stupid or next level delusional. Pull your head out of your a** and stop behaving like a cult member.
Trump‚Äôs Beautiful Depression or The Perfect Depression or The Best Depression....
Totally agree! Trump in his delusion would love for that to happen. Can‚Äôt wait to get rid of this nightmare!
You guys are a bunch fools trump got you suckers to do exactly what he wanted focus on his stupid tweets to stop the media from reporting the real news  of the day the worst numbers for the economy ever  shame on you
So the trend was heading Trumps direction. That‚Äôs around the time the Wikileaks hack was underway...then the loss of death was the Comey reopening the investigation 10 days before the election. Trump won by 72,400 total votes in 4 swing states. He needs to win them all plus other
Exactly! What‚Äôs makes it even look more bad is that he knows trump is ignorant and has been shown to allow white people to be racist towards black to say give him a second term because he said something racist
President Obama‚Äôs touching eulogy for the great John Lewis/Trump‚Äôs awkward, ugly, smarmy acknowledgment of the death of Herman Cain from the Trump virus ‚Äî compare and contrast.
Antifa means Anti-Fascist. If Trump is against Anti-Fascism that means he is Pro-Fascism. Simple Logic.
You're joking, right? I could knock down your talking points one at a time, but you still wouldn't get it. But I will tackle the first one. Trump finds out long ago that Putin is paying bounties to the Taliban to specifically kill American Soldiers. Yet Trump does NOTHING. WTF?
trump is a fascist

Many years ago The late NYC Mayor Edward said this about Donald Trump, " I don't believe any he says even if his tongue was notorized".
Now do Trump.  He's been yammering for a half hour and I have yet to hear the words "Herman Cain" come out of his mouth.  I guess he doesn't like black conservatives either.   Or he doesn't want to rile up the racist part of his base, which I kind of understand.

Please let us refer to it as the Trump virus since he allowed it to get totally out of control.
Mike what is your point with all of the posts about shootings? The protests are about police brutality you goofball. Sometimes you‚Äôre a good source for comedic relief w/ Trump but after that you‚Äôre all over the map and we can‚Äôt tell what side you‚Äôre on anymore.
listening to trump talk rn and he really does not care
Useless-ass Dems will try to "investigate" and "lawsuit" Trump out of office, instead of just yoking his ass up, and voil√†!  His ass will still be in the White House, the whole time, running amok.
No, he passed away from the TRUMP virus.
Tom Read needs to say good bye this year after the election. Listening to trump lie to us again on the pandemic is to much to bear. He supports these lies.
WTF is this man talking about  Trump News Conference  I can't I always turn the channel when he comes on.  Makes me sick to my stomach

He's done both, only Dem governors forcing sick people into nursing homes to intentionally kill tens of thousands of the eldery have bumped the death toll in the US. Look at your party if you want to know why people died. Trump bent over backward to give them the resources.
By denying science, promoting misinformation, undermining messages about the importance of the mask or denying the seriousness of the Pandemia, Trump is doing what cult leaders always do in the end, killing their followers. #dyingforTrump
Agreed, Trump 2020, the Dems are way too violent, divisive and hostile.
This should be against the Law!! And made a federal  crime! Punishable by Prison! The Prince of the under world doesn't want to abdicate his throne! This is something the public should take very seriously! This could be the over throwing of the white house! Trump is  wrong!

I'll remind you Trump and his fellow Republicans pushed through a tax cut DURING A GROWTH CYCLE. That was absolutely unprecedented in scope. You lost your "fiscal responsibility" claims right then and there.
Its going to be a very embarrassing sight to the rest of the world when we have to drag Trump, kicking, screaming, and crying, from the West Wing come January. He'll try Anything to delay that.
Donald Trump is a congenital liar. Trump said he will win the 2020 election. Therefore, Trump will lose. How comforting.
#tRUMP's  is the party of #Grifters.
I believe you. You are preaching to the choir. I‚Äôve suggested that we will not have an election if Trump &amp; Barr have their way. They are both in deep shit. They won‚Äôt cede power without trying everything destructive.
are you talking about herman Cain? another non masker who died from Covid???WTF is wrong with you all... It's unbelievable  how you continue to allow trump to continue to spread non truths and very dangerous information and you all enable  Herman's death is on you as well!
you should all be ashamed of yourself.... trump had that rally and people died, and you all encouraged.. she,me...and deaths are on you as well!
it‚Äôs like taking a victory lap when trump does something dumb (usually directly contradicted by a past tweet)- you‚Äôre technically right, but who cares
I know.  But plenty of Republicans got off Trump's train a long time ago.  He's calling for Trump to be impeached over a tweet that Trump will say was a "joke" tomorrow.  You know what I see?  A hypocrite who sees Trump is going to lose big, and now he's embarrassed.
I feel like coach Ryan is on that train, but at the same time he used to talk about how he had the most money in his pocket when bill Clinton was in office so maybe he would‚Äôve voted against trump in 2016. Mr Connington definitely got a red hat

The very sight of Obama exposes how grotesque Trump really is.
Sad to hear of any death due to the TRUMP PLAGUE hopefully Mr. Cain‚Äôs passing is stark reminder to simply mask up and distance

Maybe she can find out why Biden spied on the Trump campaign. Also, what Hunter did to earn all that money in the Ukraine and China. Since she was an AG she could prosecute Biden and become president.

He would likely be if the Senate elections do not happen or are not federally recognized per Trump's fantastical plot. Grassley would not be in the majority. Dems would have a 5-seat majority and he is the senior Democratic Senator.

I was showing the comparison of the same poll that showed a small lead then for Clinton and is now showing a much larger lead for Biden. Trump doesn‚Äôt have Wikileaks through Roger Stone to hack DNC emails. Oh and it‚Äôs no theory.
Is it true that not one member of the White House was represented at the John Lewis funeral??? Pathetic. I hope people remember when Trump is dead.
POTUS tweet came after CBS report where, of the 100 trial voters registration they sent, 1st, it didn't arrive on time. 2nd, some of the mails were missing therefore their "vote" would not be counted. Which prove Trump's right. Beside, lots of voters fraud recently in New Jersey
Grassley would no longer be in the majority if 23 GOP senate seates aren't filled. Dems would then hold a 5-seat majority on Jan. 3, if Trump's dream of cancelling federal elections were even to happen.

I understand that you are upset that Trump turned out to be the monster I always said he was. I don‚Äôt blame you for being upset that you have not been able to recognize his incompetence. Thankfully, most other Americans have. How will he cheat now? Cancelling the election?

If Biden wants a female VP, he should pick one from a state that Trump won in 2016.  Biden's VP will be pro-abortion, no matter whom he picks.   If he picks Harris, it remains to be seen if the left keeps quiet because of her record prosecuting drug offenders.

Trump has yet to get COVID but came into contact with multiple people who had it.. there‚Äôs a cure obviously
I'm sure he does feel some shame. He's given interviews about it, in fact. For a year+. Save the criticism for those who still stand by Trump. When defectors from enemy powers come to our side, we welcome them. We don't say "Now you're defecting?"
Creepy Joe will finally be able to sniff her hair!
I am concerned that Trump is carrying on about VBM as a cover-up, but knows he has the postmaster in his pocket!
So, no mention of his mask less attendance at Trump‚Äôs rally? No lesson learned which might be discussed for public wellbeing?
Before we all start jerking Dubya off, let's be real. Much of what Trump is now doing can be linked to the Bush administration. Bush created the organization currently picking up citizens in unmarked vans. He lied us into a war that is still going on now. C'mon!

Trump is laying out the foundation to stir up martial law.  He wants to stop the election and this is his only avenue to do it.
As it should be. He made his choices, we are seeing the consequences. He chose Trump over science. He shares responsibility for Americans dying. His bad example not only did him in, but likely others as well. At least we can learn from his poor choices. #MaskUp
What does it mean to say he can't?  If Trump issued an executive order saying that the election was delayed, couldn't some states refuse to administer the election on Nov 3?
It's OK. He just meant to distract from his horrific numbers in polls, ruined economy, and mass killing of Americans through his negligence.

I don‚Äôt care about trump nor his supporters and you can not guilt me into doing so

You might want to sit down for this: Trump used to be a Democrat.
"I take no responsibility at all"                           Donald Trump
Why? Because President Obama is about to speak at Rep John Lewis‚Äô memorial? Cool. We can compare the ratings after and ridicule trump for his abysmal ratings.
tRump &amp; the soon to be former GOP never were ‚ÄúConstitutionalists‚Äù. Indeed, they seem to have rejected every word but the 2nd Am (for white men). When will we finally admit there is no common ground for dialogue much less governing with No-Constitutionalists?  #DeconstructTheGOP
"Trump also does not have the power himself to move the date of the election, which was set by an 1845 federal law placing it the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The date could move theoretically with action by Congress..."
True. And I‚Äôd be totally fine with these trump cultists exposing themselves and dying from covid, but they endanger us all when they refuse to take it seriously and refuse to wear a mask.
"Trump has betrayed his oath multiple times and allowed massive, preventable deaths and economic suffering, so how does he correct course, precisely?"
Trump is going to violate on Biden come debate time. 100 percent.
Looks like a preview of a Trump/Biden debate.

President Donald Trump suggested the U.S. should delay the November election.
Clearly, as long as members of the Senate remain in office post-Trump they will try to maintain the Trump legacy of divisiveness, bigotry and the breaking of norms.  They ALL must go.  This is the future fight of the Republican Party  via

Joe Biden says Trump's failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump
Okay Mr. Trump, if you‚Äôre so adamant about delaying the election until people can ‚Äúproperly, securely and safely vote‚Äù than why are you forcing children back into the classroom before we can ‚Äúproperly, securely and safely‚Äù educate the future of the United States of America!
Indeed we must all rise up and make sure that every person can vote!!  Trump will stop at nothing to destroy our country.

Top Republicans offered a rare rebuke of President Trump on Thursday, condemning his suggestion that the Nov. 3 general election be delayed ‚Äî something he has no authority to order
U.S. to redeploy troops away from Germany, fulfilling Russian dream, and costing U.S. billions
I know I saw him on tv talking about the rally. He went down that rabbit hole with Trump.
Compared to Trump?! OF COURSE!!!  However that's really not a good argument in this scenario. Should i ask if trump is yours?
Trump leading all of these people down a rabbit hole.
Yet at this defining moment in our history, when it came time to stand up to those who would challenge Trump and his bigotry (AOC/Biaggi) you chose to go with those who either advocated appeasement or were closet Republicans themselves.  That‚Äôs not privilege? Please.
Trump will be dead by 2050

Yes Trump is leaving coronavirus death in his tracks
any thoughts? May he rest in peace. No shade in him or his politics but he died from a virus that's "no big deal" and a "hoax." Attended a Trump rally healthy, dead days later.. it's a lot to consider. What say you?

The real fraud is Donald Trump using baseless mail in voter fraud claims.  To the people voting for him, stay asleep.
Why is Twitter allowing Trump to spread false lies about mail-in ballots? Since when does a U.S. President engage in such ill nonsense and still have the ability to use your platform??? #ProtecttheElection #retweet #share #SpreadTheWord #Dems4USA
Imagine actually dying for trump.  MAGA cringe.
Because Trump is such a jokester, right?
Trump suggests postponing the election - 1. The president does not have the power to postpone an election. 2. Congress holds this power 3. Question: is Trump afraid of losing the election or is he preparing to contest the election results, or both?
It‚Äôs really time the government steps in and stops you posting these Chinese slogans. The Chinese want Biden to win the election because they can‚Äôt push around or buy Trump.
Herman Cain is dead because HE CHOSE to go to a Trump rally that EVERYONE knew would be mask free.

Obama Takes Trump Shots During Hyper-Political Eulogy For John Lewis
You spoke of our daily nightmare: Trump driving us off the cliff into fascism.
In the early stages it was considering a possibility, tests were still being done when the Trump started saying it was the cure, then scientists got more info indicating that it was not effective &amp; dangerous but Trump won't shut up about it still being a cure.
The digital age. Binary. From an Obama one to an absolute Trump zero
It‚Äôs 2020 homeboy. Nobody gives af about 2016. In 95 days, 2 hours and 36 minutes Trump is going down like power windows.
I can't help but wonder if #Donorrhea and the #RepugnantCONS are so dead set against 'vote by mail' is because they haven't figured out how to suppress it yet!  Trump says ‚Äòyou may never even know‚Äô who won the election if we proceed with mail-in voting -
Well assuming that statistical 50% of parents are the dads that means only 28% are the moms so trump is losing that one tooüôÑ

Hence, the idea of voting by mail. Which Trump has preemptively attempted to stop, for no reason.
Maybe what we can take away from these past 3 1/2 years is that while you may have disagreed with Obama, and I may have disagreed with Bush, both were good, decent men. I don‚Äôt think the same will EVER be said about Trump.

Trump is tweeting today about postponing  the election to create a DISTRACTION from the fact that Hernan Crain, who contracted #TrumpVirus at his rally,  has passed away from COVID. Do not be diverted
Qanon is a huge factor that cannot be overlooked. It must be investigated and terminated. Most dangerous misinformation campaign I've ever seen. Majority of Trump supporters believe it, and as you've seen, Republicans and even Miachel Flynn. It's truly frightening times in USA.
Oh I know. I've said for a long time if he loses he won't leave willingly. This is not gonna end well...no matter how it goes. And it's all on the GOP. All of it. For not removing Trump at impeachment.
A truly loyal Trump Republican.  All the way to his end. Fielty to sacrifice as dictated by the GOP to save the economy by dieing to save the economy. Good job Herm!!
Well it's Trump's goons doing that so that's on Republicans to stand up and stop Trump
Funny though the guy breaking windows covering his face with umbrella was a Trump supporter and white supremacy! He was trying to entice fights and discord! Do you think he was the only one?

Trump is lower than pond scum......God Iwill be the first person at my polling place on Nov 3rd. ü§®Let's ask Dotard J Trump! He's so good with letters!
You lie like Trump
Is it? Or is it just something you internet tough guys like to say to appear "above it all" as though your support of Trump would exclude you from said Karma?  Either way, ü§°.
Trump is not allowed at funerals
In other words you see money to be made by jumping on the bandwagon. Only someone who knows they have no genuine argument resorts to ‚Äúright wing/religious bots‚Äù! Kinda like Trump and his Obamagate/Antifa. You‚Äôve lost all credibility now.
You should have thought about that before you sold your soul to Trump. We will now clean house and rebuild the Republican party. And no, you're not part of it.

I didnt praise any of them, you did. That counts for more than you ever did, for which you ignored their crimes in your vitriol for Trump.
If this story is true, and it sure as hell explains a lot, like why we still don't have a national testing program, Trump and Kushner should be in fucking handcuffs.

Of course if he wasn't such a Trump ass kisser, his family would have just enjoyed dinner with him!!! But THIS will never be on your conscience now will it!!! He died for the cause right???!!!
won't cause they hate Trump and the supporters. #maga.    Just like they didn't say a word about officer Dorn..
Yet he‚Äôs crushing your guy...Shows how horrible Trump is
It is an established fact that #Obama has a much larger penis than #Trump

Sad that Herman Cain lost his life because of his support for Trump.  If he had just worn a simple mask he would be alive.  Not tragic just stupid.
So the trend was heading Trumps direction. That‚Äôs around the time the Wikileaks hack was underway...then the loss of death was the Comey reopening the investigation 10 days before the election. Trump won by 72,400 total votes in 4 swing states. He needs to win them all plus other

Mr President Donald J Trump won the election with 60mill+ of us citizens who like him &amp; love our country. For 3+yrs, Our President &amp; us were attacked for our ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù victory. DERANGED DEMOCRAT‚Äôs use of illegal persecution &amp; hoaxes against AMERICA has not stopped!
Now do Trump.  He's been yammering for a half hour and I have yet to hear the words "Herman Cain" come out of his mouth.  I guess he doesn't like black conservatives either.   Or he doesn't want to rile up the racist part of his base, which I kind of understand.
Totally wrong move!  Flynn needs to sue for $. The Resistance is terrified of Flynn‚Äôs ‚Äúdiscovery phase‚Äù in a civil trial. A trump pardon would negate all this and Flynn would not see any $.
Mary Trump's book is really helping me understand him when he speaks.  It's like a Trump Translator.
Trump is reveling in the fact that other countries are having an upswing in coronavirus as if that makes him look good.  He is a sick and evil man.  And he says "plahs-ma"
Please let us refer to it as the Trump virus since he allowed it to get totally out of control.

I know.  But plenty of Republicans got off Trump's train a long time ago.  He's calling for Trump to be impeached over a tweet that Trump will say was a "joke" tomorrow.  You know what I see?  A hypocrite who sees Trump is going to lose big, and now he's embarrassed.
Probably.  He'll try to put us all in HazMat suits if Trump wins.
THIS was the straw that broke his back. Not Trump's abuse of power over the past 4 years. Not kids kidnapped from their parents &amp; put in cages. Not the solicitation of foreign help to try and win an election.  Not the Individual-1 campaign finance indictment. This tweet did it.üòÇ
He‚Äôs a trump supporter so his life doesn‚Äôt matter. At least that‚Äôs the general consensus.
I'm expecting (or hoping for) a paddy wagon next to the stage during Biden's inauguration. Though, Trump may already be on a plane to Russia by then.

I hate to break it to you. You weren't alive back then. Wait till trump enforced a mandatory draft and then come back to me
Is that right?
Absolutely no joy. He was a Father,a Grandfather and there will be people, completely separate from Politics, who will genuinely mourn him.  My question is is the Trump Campaign Criminally Liable for actively PREVENTING attendees at the rally from Social Distancing?
Trump doesn‚Äôt give a flying cr.p about you and all Americans. Don‚Äôt you get it?
Your blind hatred for Trump makes you say things you really sound ignorant on. This isnt Trump's fault, it isn't really Cain;s fault either even thou he said he wont wear a mask.
I was showing the comparison of the same poll that showed a small lead then for Clinton and is now showing a much larger lead for Biden. Trump doesn‚Äôt have Wikileaks through Roger Stone to hack DNC emails. Oh and it‚Äôs no theory.
I understand that you are upset that Trump turned out to be the monster I always said he was. I don‚Äôt blame you for being upset that you have not been able to recognize his incompetence. Thankfully, most other Americans have. How will he cheat now? Cancelling the election?
There‚Äôs only one person I hate that isn‚Äôt a fictional character, and he is Donald Trump- whoops
And you idiots think Trump has an ounce of integrity...He doesn‚Äôt ...He‚Äôs toast. He knows it.
Now do Trump.  The actual "President."
So much more respected than Trump
Imagine choosing Trump's politics as the hill to die on.  God rest his soul.  "Herman Cain"

I'm sure he does feel some shame. He's given interviews about it, in fact. For a year+. Save the criticism for those who still stand by Trump. When defectors from enemy powers come to our side, we welcome them. We don't say "Now you're defecting?"
Call me crazy, but for now I'm taking Trump's tweet as trying to drive this story from the news cycle, which it effectively has.
B-b-but Trump says that the country is doing better than any country during any time in the history of the entire world and he can't be lying right? üò®

They have millions of practicing alcoholics and ex users on their side willing to sell any one of us who had the same problem out if we support trump. They dont want democracy. They want a socialist state. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is our kids future.
At this point, I'd almost rather Trump runs and loses the election, than one of his ass-kissers run in place of Trump and Republicans who gave up on Trump, like those of the Lincoln Project, vote for the ass-kisser. We need to clean out All remaining Republicans!
I don‚Äôt care about trump nor his supporters and you can not guilt me into doing so
To be pro trump is a crime. We should send them all to Russia to wait for the Trump family to arrive.
No need to write comedy when it writes itself:  "With Mike Pence aboard, the Trump 2020 campaign bus collided with a dump truck around 11 a.m. in Allegheny County, according to journalists in the accompanying press pool."  Please post your favorite joke based on this news.
Putin doesn‚Äôt want him. Trump is useful to him messing up the US in the US, not in asylum in Russia.

This picture is absolutely despicable. As a Trump supporter, I am absolutely ashamed at this
Amazon, Apple, Facebook, &amp; Google CEO's face tough questions at a Congressional antitrust hearing.  One GOP Rep. facing re-election asked, "for a friend."  "While I don't favor censoring, is it possible to delete all images of me, err my friend, standing beside Donald Trump?"
Mr. Caine willingly chose to commit suicide.  Case closed.  They just can't make up their minds. One Trumpublican blames his mask for COVID19 and one refused to wear the mask. Republicans are dropping like flies, of course Trump wants to delay the election
Actually, if I was chancellor of Counyry with Foreign Troops in it who are ordered to act on the whims of Trump, I would have requested the reduction and MORE than 15,000.  Marcon has advocated for the creation of The EU Military. It needs to happen.
He's saying it. I will NEVER understand the decision by resisters to attack the Enlightened who have seen Trump for what he is, &amp; "better late than never" are putting #CountryOverParty to topple Trump. Honestly,  it hurts our chances of a bipartisan defeat of Trump. Knock it off.

If Cain got COVID at the rally in Tulsa Trump recklessly insisted on holding, indoors, can‚Äôt we say that in a meaningful sense Trump killed him?
Trump's pinned tweet is kinda huge. Lots to unpack here but to crystalize the issue: Have we come to the point where only fascism can save us from global communism?

Abso-fuckin-lutely.  I also hope we get our version of President Zelensky, (Biden) I watched his anti-corruption, pro-democracy sitcom on Netflix when Articles of Impeachment were filed against Trump.  He is great. GOP attempts to smear him = further proof they've sided w/ üá∑üá∫.
is so in the tank for Trump it‚Äôs pathetic. Whatever Trump says, he‚Äôs on board. If Trump said we need to kill all kittens.  would say...Do we really need kittens?
I was actually naive enough to think Trump would hate governing (but loved campaigning) and would walk away after one term, calling it a success. I guess I underestimated how effectively he could grift from the WH (and how little oversight would happen)
We can not let a delay happen. Trump is getting desperate. Try being a real president instead of a fake president.
Do we think Trump is trying to deflect attention from the GDP numbers or the obvious insider trading of Kodak shares?

Hi Trump supporters who live in low- income housing. This is what he thinks of you.  He doesn‚Äôt like you. He doesn‚Äôt want you living in his neighborhood. He definitely doesn‚Äôt want you visiting any of his hotels or clubs.
so I guess that we are not going to see Trump in the Rose Garden today to talk about the Economy.

The fact that Donald Trump is the President blows my mind everyday
It's like there are actual consequences for Trump pulling the US out of the U.N. Human Rights Committee...
It's a great thing to see a headline as clear and declarative about this fact. Whatever his motives, Opus Dei theocracy or his investments in Vector Group, or covering up for Donald Barr and Donald Trump in re Epstein- he's helping Putin. He has been since his job audition memo.
Not only is  ahead of Trump in the Texas polls, but the US stock market is up. Do you think that the stock market being up and Biden leading in polls in any coincidence? The market WANT Joe Biden to win in November!
Donald Trump wants to test injecting people with disinfectant. Fauci and Birx have said there are no plans to do that.
He's an Aldrich Ames president. Democrats knew it, tried to warn people and even remove him from office. Republicans knew it, covered up evidence, &amp; acquitted him.  TN 23 have the nerve to feign outrage about Trump leaving #Germany in the lurch.
I see Biden is leading in Texas...wow...that shows how bad Trump is
Just a thought about these inane reports about Biden allies objecting to the possibility of Harris as VP because she's not "loyal" enough to Biden - seems to me to be one (of countless) problem w/ Trump admin -- a little too much loyalty - f*k that! #TeamofRivals

"Trump's brief experiment with taking responsibility for the pandemic appears to be over. The president is back to hyping hydroxychloroquine, falsely claiming much of the country is ‚Äúcorona free,‚Äù and endorsing a doctor who believes medicine contains alien DNA."
And yet Roger Stone was found guilty. Trump had to do a 'take home test' because he was petrified about having to face a questioner (and STILL he lied). And the Corrupt AG to this day, won't release the report in its entirety.
This man has no credibility. Fake news is fake news and if everyone was banned why is Trump still on these platforms?
Don Jr met with Russian Agents in Trump Towers. Trump knew. When the Mueller Investigators asked Trump he said 'I don't recall...' Trump directed Roger Stone to contact Assange to get the info that the GRU had given Assange. Stone did. When asked Trump said 'I don't recall.., '
Because Don Jr. never met Russians in Trump Towers to discuss... adoptions?
The same Roger Stone who Trump pardoned so Stone wouldn't rat him out?
Which say exactly what? That Trump told Roger Stone to contact Julian Assange (who was working with the GRU) to get dirt of Hilary Clinton?
Why would he ask Putin about it?  You really expect Putin would say "Oh, yes, Mr. President, we have put many bounties on your troops!"  No, he'll deny it.  Trump would then say "Putin denied it" and you all would screech "he's taking Putin's word!"   No win scenario.

I see the Left denouncing Trump regarding the "Russian Bounty" story, which is unconfirmed. Yet in 2012, during the Obama administration, the CIA trained and funded the Islamic State in Syria. Operation Timber Sycamore. What Taliban?
They can demand what they like.  That doesn't change the law.    And the codes restricting "taking over law enforcement" are in reference to federal TROOPS.  Unless Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, he can't have the Guard or the active military take over policing.
Not only do i know he isnt, no president in the last 100 years have been. But you personally cannot sit there and critique Trump on one hand and defend Obama on the other. You just cannot.

Missed opportunity ‚ùóÔ∏èPresident Trump declair a NATIONAL HOLIDAY IN MEMORY OF ‚ÄúJOHN LEWIS‚Äù‚ÄºÔ∏è
Until trump gets a hold of you with more kompromat and you sing a different tune by sunset tonight.
I wonder how many will vote for him anyway

They told Trump Herman Cain just died and trump asked does that mean another black person will be moving to the suburbs. Not funny RACIST!
Another black man with the conk mentality. Could have done so much for his people dies and Trump ain‚Äôt even acknowledged his existence.
Listen to "THE ELECTION IS NOT RIGGED SHOULD NOT BE DELAYED" by THE DEREK VARSALONA SHOW. ‚öì  No President Trump the election is not rigged. You must accept the results of the election even if you lose in 2020. Listen to my Take on THE DEREK VARSALONA SHOW
With every tweet, Executive Order or unlawful misuse of power, Trump is showing all that an election is irrelevant. He‚Äôs not leaving until every Democratic leader unites and make him irrelevant. Do it now. New impeachment hearings, subpoenas and ENFORCEMENT.
#wewillvote for for Donald trump
Herman Cain could have saved his own life if he didn‚Äôt attend the rally.  Trump is at fault for treating this virus like a joke but people have to be held accountable for their ignorant actions.
For everyone saying Trump *can‚Äôt* cancel an election, I think we are way past what what he can and can‚Äôt do, legally or otherwise.  It is what he *will* and *will not* do, and what the craven, evil Republican Party will go along with.  If the past 3.5 years have taught us...
ONLY 86% of polled 2016 Trump supporters will be voting for him in 2020. Self-identifying Republicans are down. Yes, the Cult of Trump is enthusiastic but it is increasingly looking like an impossible statistical needle to thread. #WeWillVote
Your ongoing support of trump has brought us to this point. You are #ComplicitCorruptGOP
What about the black man who was killed by another Blackman because he was a trump supporter?
How is trump destroying the USPS? Please tell us. The USPS lost 8billion last year continuing its streak of THIRTEEN straight years losing money the high being around 13 billion a few years ago BEFORE trump. Seems like the actual facts say the usps is destroying itself.
Leftist liberal media circus show whose only aim is to discredit Trump
Sorry. I‚Äôm sickened by the praises for GWB and Reagan. Never forget that Reagan said he believed in ‚Äústate‚Äôs rights‚Äù in Nashoba County, where Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner were lynched. And Bush is responsible for way more deaths than tRump.
Trump is America‚Äôs Stalin.
But remember, it only sounds correct when at a Bruse concert and you've had two of the overpriced 16 oz. Budweiser's in the shitty paper cups. üòÇüòÇ
See Laura knows.... ü§£
You got it right. That's the way they pronounce his name in Jersey. ü§£ü§£ü§£
I think so especially at Bruse concerts. üòÅ
Nobody needs media influence to form an opinion on Trump. All you have to do is listen to him.
No, he's right Jersian's slur his name, Bruse!
Dam the last week your tweets have been hilarious, yet with the right amount truth sprinkled in ... why aren‚Äôt you president ? üòÉ
Emporer Palpatine, i mean Trump wants to delay the US Election. this guy needs to get out of dodge. i am so done with him. Basically he wants to be president for a few more years until he cannot stop elections anymore. #votegold #votejojorgensen #JoJorgensen2020
Excellent list and gotta live the Todd in there üëç
2/ ... that are ruining millions of lives,  are screaming bloody murder over Trump merely suggesting an Election Day delay. Nice try, but we already have a lot of documented proof you don‚Äôt support democracy or the Constitution.
Waiting for you to thank Trump for doing your job and lowering drug prices. You whine. He gets stuff done.
We can not determine if he contracted it during the rally.  What we can determine is that he was there without mask, so either he contracted it or spread it.  Trump falls into this because the rally was irresponsible and a public health hazard, as well as terribly embarrassing
Some clever folks on social media have been posting sarcastic ‚Äúdelay the election‚Äù comments for months as a smart response to those Trump-haters who think shutting everything down is a great way to defeat him. Maybe now, the ‚Äúburn it all down‚Äù types will think twice
Holy shit Donald Trump killed Herman Cain
Trying to talk to a Trump voter about literally anything
3/ ... and in Trump‚Äôs case, where everything he says is immediately opposed by the Dems &amp; the media, there‚Äôs a good chance his tweet will now be met with self-righteous calls for as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù an election as possible, complete with debates, conventions, rallies, etc.
2/ ... like keeping their nominee hidden, nixing a real convention, &amp; likely avoiding any Biden-Trump debates. So when your opponents are engineering a pretty strong strategy of destroying the rules, it‚Äôs a great idea to suggest breaking some too...
1/ Here‚Äôs why the  tweet suggesting delaying the election was such a smart move: One of the biggest threats for Trump in this election is the way the Democrats are getting away with breaking all the rules...
Trump thinks it‚Äôs safe for your child to go to school but not for you to go vote him out.
Aside from the utter outrageousness of this, Trump does not have this power.
The only flare ups of the TRUMP VIRUS are in the USA thanks to you.  The only country that‚Äôs a disaster is our country and once again, it‚Äôs because of you.
Hell to the NO #Trump. No delay, no extra days in office so you and #MitchMcConnell can take another shot at #SCOTUS. Your days in office are tied to Inauguration Day 2021. Buh -bye. #NovemberIsComing and you can‚Äôt do anything to stop it!
How come no one discusses the black man who was killed by another black man because he was a Trump supporter after all Black Lives Matter don‚Äôt they?I hesitate to think if it was a white man who killed him,omg!
Referring to the black man who was killed by another black man because he was a Trump supporter I hesitate to think what would‚Äôve happened if it was a white man who killed him.omg!
What about the black man who was killed by another black man because he was a Trump supporter I don‚Äôt hear anyone talking about him I thought black lives mattered?He was murdered in cold blood in the daytime
You need a better excuse! You can't continue to blame Trump Admin. All this unrest was going on B4 anyone one was sent there! Stop blaming others for your incompetence, you are a disgrace ! People like you are a danger to this country !  Try doing your job !
I had a momentary lapse of reason. Maybe 3 will oppose tRump on this.
Read: Trump suggests nationwide voter suppression.
Please show proof that he is a pedo. Speaking of commies, why will Trump say nothing of Putin arming the taliban and even worse put bounties in our men and women of the military?

Prediction: If rightful pressure rises against Adam Silver to resign, he will shift the focus off of him by making several anti-Trump statements. It's an M.O. that the news media falls for every time since former Broward County Scott Israel used it after the Parkland shooting
If Trump was fighting the military industrial complex, he would cut the military budget. Instead he increases it every year. This move is simply to insult Merkel and please Putin
Totally. I am not at all comfortable with the chaos we are devolving into under your party‚Äôs leadership. All Trump-supporting GOP must go!

Wow it‚Äôs becoming a common narrative. I brought up Candace Owens to a couple of my friends and one said the same thing. As if though a black Trump supporter can‚Äôt have their own mind. Are we all reading from a narrative painted by media?
I just finished The Plot Against America and I'm wondering if some of the Trump playbook came from how Lindberg is depicted in that book/show. Now I know the show just came out and also I doubt that Trump can read, but wow, this makes sense somehow.

Don't worry Laura, never count me out. I have Michael just where I want him.
If people don‚Äôt like that I support Trump they would never say it to my face. If they did it would be a huge issue. Last I checked we are free to support who we want.
Because they past the ‚Äúpoint of no return‚Äù with him. At this point, if Donald Trump handed them turd cookies, they will eat them. He could do no wrong. Look back and think of what they already ignored, looked the other way, digested and tolerated. It‚Äôs pathetic.
(Yesterday) Biden is supportive of something called #BLACKlivesMatter AND has vowed to pick a woman running mate and likely a Black one for political reasons, rather than just picking the best person, and he says Trump is divisive? Yeah. Ok. YK

... Trump isn‚Äôt worthy of any cult of personality, but that‚Äôs not what irks the leaders of the Never Trump movement. What irks them is that GOP voters don‚Äôt think the Never Trumpers are worthy of worship at all!
That‚Äôs apparently what Trump voters said in 2016 about him. Can‚Äôt explain why else anyone would have voted for him.
Mr . Trump have you seen HTBX status on T-cells. I think they have something here that will become very popular very soon.  Company is close to moderna down in Miami. Have a look.    $htbx
Look what a bubble this man lives in! I wear the mask in public places, but I‚Äôve at least heard of all the reputable studies saying masks don‚Äôt work. Isn‚Äôt there ANY possibility that the folks he accuses of murder might have a point? Trump or no Trump, French needs more humility
Makes sense. Never Trumpers think they have the right to destroy those who disrespected them! More proof they are even more arrogant than Trump, &amp; there‚Äôs nothing an arrogant man hates more than another arrogant man. Luckily, they‚Äôre too arrogant to see how insignificant they are
Manfred Mann's version is the best no matter what  says. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
That's what Democrats and the Establishment don't like about him.  Otherwise, if #Trump kept his mouth shut and just ran the Empire as his predecessors did, they to would be quiet.

Just in case you didn't know that donald john drumpf was a racist pig, enjoy: Trump tells voters in suburbs they will ‚Äòno longer be bothered‚Äô by low-income housing  I wonder what and WHO he was talking about.... #RememberInNovember
This is just another example of how the democrats are just immature crybabies. They have done nothing but try to destroy Trump and wouldn‚Äôt know if he has done anything good.
Yes. There aren‚Äôt any ‚Äúadults in the room‚Äù anymore (if there ever really were). Trump‚Äôs succeeded in fully establishing a Kakistocracy of sycophants in every office and department.

The worst part about it is that hydra chloroquine doesn‚Äôt work and isn‚Äôt safe accords to the FDA BUT there several drugs now proven to work. Trump could just promote those, but he is sticking to a drug that is harming people. Just inform folks on the drugs that ARE working.

I really cannot believe what EWTN has turned into. I should've known what was happening from when Arroyo suddenly was appearing on Fox almost as much as any show host. Some Catholics are enamored with Trump because he claims to be "pro-life". We can't be single issue voters.

Mitch is more dangerous than Trump, in all honesty. It's been his project from the start to own the courts and he's been the water carrier for the Reps for decades. Im still hurting about Booker, but he's one more than literally anyone that a slice of toast would be better than.
The republicans should be a fringe group of radicals who can't win a city seat, but they haven't been opposed on areas that matter. Dems moved way in their court on trade, economics, wall street, etc.. They gotta be reigned back in. Once Trump is gone the vests gotta go on.
But all of that ends November 3rd. Once Trump is gone, there is no excuse. It would be irresponsible to let Biden run the status quo and disillusion people who were convinced that Dems were the answer and their lives didn't improve. That's the real danger.
I apologize for my implication that you are in any way racist. I just don't want people to go to sleep. I'm on edge. If change doesn't happen, god knows what the next "Trump" might be like. This one is bad enough.
Look, my main concern is that people are going to get complacent. My hope is that seeing Trump, we reach a pivot point where we can make real change, but it's not going to happen if we just show up on Nov 3rd and assume elected leaders will sort it out. A lot of people just

President Trump tweeted this morning, suggesting a delay in November elections due to the expected increase in mail-in voting.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why [Trump] continues to do things that damages him with the electorate!‚Äù  PROBABLY BECAUSE HE DOESNT ANTICIPATE HAVING TO FACE THE ELECTORATE. HE WILL NOT LEAVE OFFICE.
‚Äú What's stopping Trump supporters that verify signatures from throwing out votes they deem didn't "match up"? ‚Äú  Again ... you just proved that you REALLY don‚Äôt know how signature verification works.   But hey , at least you tried to look up for some info ...that‚Äôs an evolution.
Get fucked trump
The left is going to melt their brains with Trump floating delaying the election.
How can anyone with a brain blame President Trump for the China Virus!  He has done everything possible and probably more than anyone else could do.  It is something that has never happened and it will end when there is a cure!
Yeah, I‚Äôll vote for Biden. Yeah, Trump is about as morally bankrupt as any American you‚Äôll meet.   But this is probably not the argument to make.   Last time I criticized anything about moderate dems I got hammered with replies. Don‚Äôt care.   Our standards are so low.
Is that someone who is scared of the old TV show Xena, Warrior Princess? There was nothing scary about that show whatsoever. Trump is definitely a racist xenophobe, but I don't know about being a xenaphobe. Then again, she was a powerful woman so he's definitely scared of those.
The dems are worried about some surprise from trump?  No. Dont mean shit
Bad doctoring of Trump images. At least try to make a point. Good help is hard to find when all the donations to the campaign are being skimmed by someone in the campaign. Wink, wink.
You're absolutely right. Trump not only produces gas but generates it in millions of people every time he opens his mouth.
You can make that point without venerating the Trojan horse of #Resistance political theater that  just ends up with a right wing consensus. Look at the like numbers on the original video. There are a ton of people who think these are good people just because they say "trump bad"
I mean, if you're going to pitch Biden this is the most convincing way to do it. If Biden knows he's not going in on any mandate other than not being Trump, he would be a lot more easy to influence.
Imagine not seeing that 4 more years of neoliberalism will likely result in another Trump likely more eloquent and less incompetent. Theyre already eyeballing Tucker and after 4 years of realizing VBNMW was a farce he would skate right in because peoples lives continued to worsen

I didn't compare Trump to Hitler, I shared a photo of a vandalized campaign sign. But there are ominous parallels between Trump's behavior and Hitler's early tactics. It's all of our responsibility to ensure that nothing even approaching the horror of the Holocaust happens again.
And I bet Trump already had some shell corporation buy stock in all the companies funded to produce vaccines.  Anyone want to make book with me. Even if he loses the election he would make a ton of money. That's all he cares about.
Your subject is wrong. You're talking about Donald Trump who refuses to condemn the Russian  bounties on American soldiers and instead invites Russia to compromise our election. All the while letting Americans die .with the virus.
Americans are paying in 2 ways: once because Trump has done NOTHING to stop COVID-19 and again because Republicans have no spine and are only about white people. No its, ands, or buts.
The "flue" says it all. One thing I've noticed is that Trump supporters and conspiracy theorists who are calling this a hoax can't manage grade school level spelling and grammar. You can't tell me there's not a correlation between lack of education and being easily fooled.

Short answer: no. Long answer: nooooooooooooo. Biden cares far more about peeling Trump voters away than working in a real way with the left. His goal is to basically not have to commit to any left priorities so when he wins he can continue to serve his corporate masters.
The key word is "reported". In Foxspeak that means "let's throw this against the (Trump) wall and see what "sticks".Too obvious.

I really need to unregister. This party has gotten far too right wing. It's basically becoming a party of Republicans who didnt survive Trump, silicon valley libertarians, and rich white liberal managers. Im over it.
I wish. The reality is not much will change if Biden is elected. Sure there are likely to be reforms around the edges, but most of the agregious abuses of Trump were authored or pushes by Biden. The patriot act, the crime bill indefinite detention. Biden championed all of them.

We detained and imprisoned the Japanese. And the Occuppy and civil rights protestors were beaten, hosed and tear gassed. America is not above squashing dissent for those demanding justice. Trump is not a unique threat and to ignore that demeans every historical push for justice.
IF TRUMP WERE LIKE HITLER: "Storm Troopers" would've mowed them all down, long time ago. China would've been flattened for COVID-19, "People Of Color" and LBGTQ would be exterminated. 100% travel ban. You "never Trumpers" have no idea how good we have it here, in U.S.A. 2020.
So I unfriended a dude on snap and Facebook for being a Trump supporter. He wasn‚Äôt anyone I talked to often, but I told him why I was going to after he posted a picture of him with a Trump 2020 sign on his lawn. Gross.
Didn't he also say recently to corporations that he has no proposals that will in any way change how they do things? I mean, we're basically just re-electing Trump no matter what we do.
Same. I did it out of desperation becI saw the looming Trump win and couldn't fathom that because I still bought the "lesser evil" stuff. I felt disgusting and Trump won anyway. I'm not going to do it again. Biden is less tenable to my conscience. Whiskey won't work this time.
See also: rephrasing.  The tweet was meant to illustrate the silliness of the argument that comes straight from GOP propaganda.  The fact is: Joe Biden does not support defunding police as Trump and Tenney have claimed.  I‚Äôm a journalist. I know how to use quotation marks.

Man, you so smart. Can't you count back to zero from 5? Trump can't.
Deaths are NOT just a fraction. They are real people that the current administration has failed to protect. Trump and you folks at Fox show no compassion for the thousands of Americans that have died. Just how you can sell your stock of Hydroxycloroquin.

But why would that bother the governors that are now killing thousands of their citizens at Trump's direction. Especially since it's Trump's DOJ that is responsible for enforcing the law.
I don‚Äôt think Trump really wants to change the Election Day,he just wants to say the election was rigged because if he loses he can blame it on absentee ballots being fraudulent. That would be his excuse.

I think you mean ignorant and i'm not the ignorant one. Please do some research. Trump might say some crazy things and he's a narcissist but he's a real American and has done great thi ngs for this country.
I feel like the parents that want their kids to go back to school, are really saying please take this child off my hands. It's been 3 months and i can't take this kid anymore!  If Trump not sacrificing his kid's life, why sacrifice your child?
We would all like schools to reopen - We‚Äôre not idiots. But it‚Äôs not safe. No one wants to gamble with their child‚Äôs life. Trump is killing people by the thousands. He won‚Äôt care if he adds a few children to the mix.
Every time Trump says something idiotic   tries to claim it was just a joke.
Because they're all in the same corrupt pedo child trafficking group. Their day will come. People don't like Trump because he knows to much. He even said he used to be in the club and wants to expose them for what they want to do to America.
You don't look at what a president says you look at what he does and Trump has done more for this country than Obama.

So lets tolerate trump. Cool?
But you do care. You use it so more people hear what you say. But there's a line between use and misuse. Make friends. Talk, ask questions. What we do here is mainly about connecting. It's not primarily gaining followers. Many such as yourself may not even care about numbers.
These people will grasp at opportunities to jump ship &amp; try to save their reputations but only if they‚Äôre losing. If they‚Äôre winning they will continue to ride the wave. The wave is crashing &amp; they want off. Remember who they are while supporting Trump, it‚Äôs their true selves.
Hermain Cain went to a Trump rally without a mask. Republicans just don't get it and now he's dead. That's the tweet.

A million Republicans decided not to vote for Trump today, if not more. This was a suicide mission and it's clear the party will not go down supporting him. A monumental mistake.
The media should have ignored Trump.
How about the trump family and all republicans send their kids back to school, the rest of us will wait and watch how that turns out before we send our kids back.
Trump is undeniably immature and nuts.  Other countries must laugh at us for tolerating him.
I am a Never Trumper.  He is unfit. He's a coward.  Trump is a clear and present danger to the people of the United States and to the Constitution.   In short he is depriving a village of an idiot.
Oh I meant in 2016 haha. But yea if Bernie was up against trump this year we‚Äôd be in trouble.
Thought you are a journalist. No president, including Trump, has the power to delay election.   A suggestion is not an action. I'm sick and tired of people who are masquerading as journalist but in reality a partisan political journalist.
I think you‚Äôre the one who is blind! Did you not hear the divisiveness that came out of Obama‚Äôs mouth earlier today, in what was supposed to be a funeral, he turned it political. The man hated and destroyed America, then a tough guy like trump comes in and the sheeple can‚Äôt.....
If Obama is a ‚Äúgreasy politician‚Äù what does he call Trump privately?
I hope you don‚Äôt have any children cause that would not be good!!! Your touting 56% as if mom wants their kids back in school. Sadly that is not the case!! This mom can‚Äôt wait for  to be the next president and Trump a distant albeit horrifying memory!!
I thought Trump said he knew it was a pandemic before anyone else.
You should have thought about that before you sold your soul to Trump. We will now clean house and rebuild the Republican party. And no, you're not part of it.
We got trump because racist white uneducated men were upset that we got a Black President.
Trump is manipulating it!!

Too bad it was the trump virus that did him in.
Trump grossly mishandled the US pandemic response and now we have 150,000 Americans dead. Period. Fact. If you still support Trump by this point, then you‚Äôre either brain dead stupid or next level delusional. Pull your head out of your a** and stop behaving like a cult member.

you should all be ashamed of yourself.... trump had that rally and people died, and you all encouraged.. she,me...and deaths are on you as well!
it‚Äôs like taking a victory lap when trump does something dumb (usually directly contradicted by a past tweet)- you‚Äôre technically right, but who cares
I feel like coach Ryan is on that train, but at the same time he used to talk about how he had the most money in his pocket when bill Clinton was in office so maybe he would‚Äôve voted against trump in 2016. Mr Connington definitely got a red hat

The only person BEHAVING ‚ÄúTRUMP-LITE‚Äù is you John. More Trump Jr. ... enjoying that privilege you pretend to deny, by attacking people. Is it too difficult for you TrumpLite to have a respectful discourse? Or do you always become offensive when trying to validate your points?
We have to be on the watch. Trump promessed to deliver the US in chaos to Putin. He is not done and i am scared of their last resort plan. Please remind everybody in the house that this horrific scenario is still possible before the elections.
So, can families of Covid victims do a massive class-action wrongful-death suit against the Trump administration?

OOOOOooo! Trump, and the Machiavellian Republicans would like the Democrats to end the filibuster, that way the can out vote the democrats and have there way, and there goes America as we know it! The Poor and middle class would be dead, "Let em eat cake!" mind set!

Obama presses for voting rights in pointed eulogy honoring John Lewis
POTUS tweet came after CBS report where, of the 100 trial voters registration they sent, 1st, it didn't arrive on time. 2nd, some of the mails were missing therefore their "vote" would not be counted. Which prove Trump's right. Beside, lots of voters fraud recently in New Jersey
Not a Trump supporter BUT if we blame him for everything wrong in this country because he's the president, I just want to point out Obama was in office for 8 years and....nvm
Exactly what Trump's America looks like...
Trump wants the news to talk about his tweets all day. The actual news is that US GDP plunged by a record 33% annual rate in the 2nd quarter as coronavirus lockdowns raged.

Not saying that the FDA will approve something for corrupt reasons, or that treatments won't be safe or effective, but Trump always meddles for his benefit at any cost, &amp; that erodes any reason to have confidence in the impartiality of the depts meant to protect us with science.
For all those who spoke badly about President Obama, I guess you like the way Trump is running the country, people dying all over the country and he still causing havoc., continue to listen to him ,
Can Trump delay the Election w/out going through Congress? AG Barr seems to think so.
Don't know, but I think it answers the question of what Erick, Son of Erick was doing during the trump inaugural address.ü§¢
They're making lots of the treatment before they get FDA approval so they'll be ready to hit the ground running if/when it's approved.   That would more comforting in an admin that doesn't double down on EVERY mistake because of Trump's ego, PR, &amp; #SunkCostFallacy.
If Biden wants a female VP, he should pick one from a state that Trump won in 2016.  Biden's VP will be pro-abortion, no matter whom he picks.   If he picks Harris, it remains to be seen if the left keeps quiet because of her record prosecuting drug offenders.
The reason why Herman is not here today, because he follow Donald Trump advice not to wear a mask.
It‚Äôs not the post office, it‚Äôs the Trump mega donor who he hired as the post master who is calling all the shots in mail delivery now!! This was done purposefully so mail in voting ends up benefitting Trump!!!
Trump has yet to get COVID but came into contact with multiple people who had it.. there‚Äôs a cure obviously
I'm sure he does feel some shame. He's given interviews about it, in fact. For a year+. Save the criticism for those who still stand by Trump. When defectors from enemy powers come to our side, we welcome them. We don't say "Now you're defecting?"
Creepy Joe will finally be able to sniff her hair!
I am concerned that Trump is carrying on about VBM as a cover-up, but knows he has the postmaster in his pocket!
So, no mention of his mask less attendance at Trump‚Äôs rally? No lesson learned which might be discussed for public wellbeing?
Before we all start jerking Dubya off, let's be real. Much of what Trump is now doing can be linked to the Bush administration. Bush created the organization currently picking up citizens in unmarked vans. He lied us into a war that is still going on now. C'mon!
Trump's future will be in Federal Prison, not the White House.
Someone thought of him doing that to try and take the heat off of Trump!

you replied and I quote, "Yet he still acted quickly." I countered with, (the travel ban had holes.) he acted impulsively, that what he did. and calling it the Chinese virus is just wrong and for you to sit up here and give tRUMP credit for his hubris is maddening. shame on you.

Trump is laying out the foundation to stir up martial law.  He wants to stop the election and this is his only avenue to do it.
As it should be. He made his choices, we are seeing the consequences. He chose Trump over science. He shares responsibility for Americans dying. His bad example not only did him in, but likely others as well. At least we can learn from his poor choices. #MaskUp
What does it mean to say he can't?  If Trump issued an executive order saying that the election was delayed, couldn't some states refuse to administer the election on Nov 3?
It's OK. He just meant to distract from his horrific numbers in polls, ruined economy, and mass killing of Americans through his negligence.
Waiting for #Trump to start rage tweeting.

You‚Äôre losing and you know it, hence you trying to delay the election you slimy, morally-challenged criminal. Flip to Trump debasing the USPS and suddenly putting his crony in charge? Why? Get ready for loooong delays in USPS mail, especially mail-in ballots. #obvious

Eric Trump has the IQ of a stale pretzel rod.  Biden needs to stay positive in his campaign, let the Trump's put out negative ads and people need to vote.  He'll win.  Otherwise 4 more years of, Person Woman Man Camera TV
I‚Äôm more focused on getting to Election Day and people voting than if Trump accepts the results.
Especially since one party is going to vote that way in a much greater percentage. It‚Äôs the perfect invitation for Trump to declare victory and stop further tallying.
I deleted my first tweet about my Dad. He is a tRump supporter. We never discuss political issues or religion. He is extremely intelligent and non racist. I think it's about money for him. I love my Dad but he is also one of the most arrogant man that I have ever met.

Clever thinking, but it's entirely possible - even if it has seemed otherwise - that Trump supporters actually DO have limits. Republicans never seem to run out of electorally-attractive dullards (Reagan, Bush the Younger, now Trump) to exploit for political gain.

Definitely cool that the response to trump and Biden calling for the arrest of anarchists isn't a defense of people's right to protests but a rhetorical pretense that anarchists dont exist, trumps really the anarchist, all of which still assumes that we should round up anarchists

Dead people can't get the Rona. Trump saved like 100,000 people from getting double Corona and that's a fact. We should double impeach him anyways though because I have a feeling he's a Nazi.

Agreed. I believe these are trump/Barr plants whose purpose is to stir up trouble so that Trump‚Äôs secret police can come and  beat up protestors. Time for marches to stop and protest leaders to sit with mayors/ lawmakers and hammer out positive change. #JohnLewisMemorial #BLM
Trump really has to suck when the guy who spied on Americans, the guy who started a pointless war based on fake evidence, and a pedophile are more likable.
Meacham nails it - Trump is challenging the legitimacy of the election and will unleash unending litigation.   THIS is the core, not the delay of the election.   And we have no clue if GOP will follow him if DEMS flip the Senate and some are out of a job.
Did anyone ever doubt that this is where we would be w trump as president? I mean the guy has a track record for turning things into shit
So we now know there is nothing Trump won't try to distract people from the economic mess we are in and the day of mourning and celebration of a beloved civil rights leader and Conrgessman.
Congress decides when the election is Federal law - not the POTUS decides when there is an election and even Republicans and  McConnell defied Trump today.

Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúCan You Assure Anybody of Anything‚Äù School Reopening Plan.  #COVID19
Then you are helping Trump and that is the reality you will have chosen to live with when reality returns to Earth1.
EVERYTIME TRUMP DOES HIS BRIEFING HES READING HIS OBITUTARY
Everyone needs to commit to not being stupid -   It's easy to get overwhelmed by the lies that McEnany and little Stevie spin for the teleprompter and Trump spits out.
and trump shouldn't delay elections because he fears losing
How many think Trump will decline the nomination and walk.
Possessed or on some good drugs.
All this talk about Demon Semen means I have to change my password on just about everything #DemonSemen #Trump #TrumpDoctor #2020worstyear #MaskUp #AntiMaskerProblems
Trump's appearance was a barn burner of lies.  Holy hell - it's too hard to count.
Too little too late from the MONSTER Trump and all he offers is a vaccine that is not yet found.
Pence's fear-mongering is ridiculous. THIS is Trump's America RIGHT NOW. Sending federal agents to incite riots in places they do not belong.
Trump has no interest in the science and has never followed it and has not followed it and given the funds needed to the schools - It is all smoke and mirrors.
So the OAN plant is ready with the Portland question on federal troops and Trump lies are unmatched even for him.   He needs his Adderall.
Trump's fear-mongering about election and mail-in voting is abhorrent.   He weaves this cloud of confusion and provides no proof of huge amounts of voter fraud as they do not exist.
Trump spinni9ng lies to fear-mongering Americans is appalling "everyone" does not know and do not accept the lies he is spinning.  Funny that he and the GOP are the ones who refused money for election security for the last 3.5 years.
The fear-mongering and saying we have to have a final vote the next day is exactly how to scare dumbasses that are in the Trump cult.
Trump can't read very well. It's not PLAHSMA nor REMDESAVAR. Someone could write it phonetically for him. He should not be discussing medical issues anyway. These press conferences are a farce.
No this is obviously the same kind of ‚Äúgarage door pull‚Äù that conservatives in the States claimed was misunderstood at NASCAR. :-) Apparently Trump‚Äôs racism has given people permission to also show theirs north of the border.
Here's a point: it wouldn't have hurt Trump if he didn't mention it in the first place.  And the Henry Ford study had issues, including the fact that the no-HCQ group was statistically significantly older - a known major risk factor.  Many, many larger studies found no benefit.
It is killing me that I can't find my mashup pic of Drumpf and Dominar Rygel. Trump is what you get if you take a sentient space slug and remove the humanity.
This is a horrendous pressor or whatever Trump calls this debacle #MAGA should be appalled but they will follower the pied piper over the cliff.   We have alot alot alot according to Trump.
Did Trump fall down? He has a gash where his brain is supposed to be.  #RemovetheFraud #TrumpTreasonousTraitor
Adolf Hitler called Donald Trump‚Äôs election postponement concept ‚Äúa real affront that made me drop my morning kuchen‚Äù and reminded Republicans it will throw off their coordinated voter suppression program.
DEM did NOT obstruct funding UI - What a fucking liar Trump is!!   DEDMS have had the Heroes Act since MAY 15  - Stop the damn lies.   DEMS have a 3 Trillion dollar act that GOP has refused to even look at a  NOW Trump is taking DEMS bill and using it
When you‚Äôre a deranged racist, there is no rhyme or reason for your actions. Trump‚Äôs goal has been to undo whatever had Obama‚Äôs name on it. Didn‚Äôt matter if it was good or not, it had to go. No debating merit or weighing benefit, it had to go. Absolutely no thought involved. Sad.
#CNNTownHall My biggest fear about Covid is that trump wins the election-or as he said, if he loses he will not leave the WH. How do we drag him out of the WH? or get him out on the basis of his insanity ?
YA STILL BE OK AND HERE WE GO PRESADENT TRUMPS FEET STINK HERE WE GO PRESADENT TRUMP AND AUNT MARSHA STARTING RICHARD NIXON AGAIN SIBLINGS I CAN BEAT TRUMP AND PUTKINS ASS SO EASY THERE BLOOD STREAMS ARE A FILTHY STINKING MESS TRUMP ALLREADY BOLEY BRIEFINGS BOWLING BANQUET üí©ü¶†‚ò†Ô∏è
What an ass Trump is - He cannot even say anything of substance.   He is recycling the same speech day after day.   He cannot even say the name of drugs and what they do and that they are NOT cures. Dexamethasone is used in chemo and is no cure for COVID-19.
trump can‚Äôt say plasma or remdesivir
That would actually be the TRUMP Virus !
Again with the embarrassingly wrong assertion that a Biden presidency would be the same or worse than a trump one. That‚Äôs just stupid. I‚Äôm sorry but it is it‚Äôs just stupid as hell and completely unserious; one is a meh centrist the other is a fucking fascist
Finnaly... Some Separation from Trump
The president of the union I was under was like Trump. She even separated us from the larger union we were under to make us weaker and more vulnerable. You can read what I wrote but you‚Äôre making a challenge where there is none for posturing purposes and an argument?
No. There is no bottom. If nothing he's witnessed until now was enough, this one Trump tweet is certainly nothing. I think you'll see conservatives who've been *all in* begin to try to rehabilitate their standing with this garbage.  Don't let them.
What the hell is there to respect about Donald J. Trump?? Nothing. Zero. Nada. He should be TOLD to resign. He is incompetent. Unable to lead. Unfit for office. Get it through your goddamn heads. Please!!!!  Imbecelic trumpers #TrumpTreason #RemoveTrumpNow  We cannot allow
Biden needs everyone's vote knowing that Trump will refuse to leave.  There are few avenues to get him out given AGBarr is Trump's lawyer not the People's,
Bad Trump
Holy hell - The Republicans got some courage and slapped down Trump on his proposal to delay the election due to mail-in voting.   No way. No how. We do need to secure voting including the damn USPS new head and donor friend of Trump who is delaying the mail right now. GET BUSY.
YA STILL BE OK PLUS SIRE TIRE IM LOOKING FOR YOU SIRE TIRE YOU ALL HAVE TOO F..CKING DIE I WILL CONTINOUE TOO RETALIATE TRUMP PUTKIN TWO YOU ALL HAVE TOO F..CKING DIE SHITTY SPLICE IN BILL CLINTONS BULLSHIT DO NOT LET ME CATCH YOU ANYWHERE NEAR MY KIDS OR FAMILY I HATE YOUR GUTS
Trump was, not Jesus Christ.
How about stopping election interference from Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, and North Korea in favor of tRump???
Im sorry if I made you uncomfortable by reminding you of just a tiny sample of the human suffering that trump has wrought and that will end with Biden. Elections aren‚Äôt about Expressing Yourself they‚Äôre about outcomes; a less than perfect president is BETTER than a fuckin monster
But drinking the Trump Kool-Aid was a contributing factor.
With two Supreme Court appts trump gutted public sector unions, virtually legalized wage theft, greenlighted even more voter supression and extreme racist gerrymanders that make many conservatives almost impossible to unseat, and so much more and this was just SCOTUS PICKS
Idk if you know this but politics isn‚Äôt a hobby or spectator sport for many of us; me and 700k others are going to lose our food stamps and starve if Trump wins and his rule changes take effect, 750k DACA kids will remain fugitives in constant fear.
#dyingforTrump we told you that b**** Herman Cain was crazy just like we told you that b**** Donald J Trump was crazy
+ ISIS video "Answer the Call" - when the terrorists were defeated in al-Busayr, the tribal sheikh collaborated with the Kurdish SDF forces and praised Trump.  ISIS continues to focus on local leaders who provide information to the US intelligence services / SDF.
IS terrorists shot dead "hypocritical" tribal leader Suleiman al-Kassar Abu Naim (pictured), who was known for his eulogy to US President Donald Trump and active support for the SDF, near the city of al-Busayr, in the east of Deir al-Zor province ...  Abu Naim was featured in+
Why the fuck is tRump talking about pizza? He's really lost his shit!
Died from drinking the Trump Kool-Aid.
Agreed he will stop at nothing, but is just throwing distractions at the wall to see what sticks. Even the Republicans know that delaying an election is political suicide, and it does belie the fact that Trump actually believes all those "fake polls" that say he's losing
You are right about the violence but maybe a tad off about saying protests are not an effective way to inspire change. Millions and millions of women marched on DC the day after Trump was inaugurated. Two years later, the euphoria from that march contributed to Dem Wave 2018.
The reason you have to qualify with ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù is because the idea that Biden is ‚Äòanother side of the same coin‚Äô or will ‚Äòkeep going the same path trump did‚Äô is absurd; he‚Äôs objectively 50,000x better than trump on every issue progressives care about and he‚Äôs the only other option
We all know them now so shut up. Trump loses in worst loss in presidential election history save yourself the embarrassment and just concede now.
Not until trump falls
Did he tell trump? Clearly not.
trump also applies that to hispanics/latinos, asians, women, American Indians....pretty much everyone, asshole.
You spelled trump 2020 success rate incorrectly
I HOPE TRUMP IS PREPARING FOR 350 MILLION AMERICANS TO BE ADMINISTERED THE VACCINE WHEN IT COMES OUT BY MAKING ENOUGH SYRINGES AND LINING UP PEOPLE, INSTITUTIONS TO ADMINISTER IT..OR WILL THAT BE YOUR UPCOMING FAILURE. CANT BLAME OBAMA. START STOCK PILING NOW
The combination of Obama‚Äôs sought-after presence and his dire warnings about Trump appears to be paying off: Digital events he has participated in have raised $24 million for Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign since the start of last month.
Trump Lied.  Herman Cain Died.
And  we didn‚Äôt cancel it or postpone it. Invalid argument from another trump troll. You prolly just stopped saying he‚Äôs still your president. üòÇ troll!
Absolutely! Go Trump 2020
That is known.  What is unknown is, if Trump loses, will he voluntarily leave the   My guess is, if the election is close, he will declare the election a fraud and fight to stay in office.  The solution is to kick his fat ass out in a landslide.
RUSH: It's amazing how the Democrats continue to fall for this guy and -- after almost four years -- still have no idea how Trump does what he does and why he's doing it when he does it.
Many say Herman Cain led a remarkable life and will be missed; that he loved his family, America and God. He was a successful businessman, beat cancer and was a voice for freedom.  Those things are generally true!  By becoming a Trump sycophant, he committed suicide.  Also true.
President Trump is taking a lot of heat for not attending the John Lewis funeral. Did anybody notice John Lewis' absence at Trump's Inauguration? I did. John Lewis was also a noted member of the 'Resistance' that pushed the Russian Hoax for 3 years. Trump was/is justified!!!
A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to halt a public charge rule in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
Whether someone opposes or supports Trump, one thing should be clear to any rational thinker. This is pure evil propaganda. The NYT and whoever the Gerbles wannabe behind it need to be exposed and ridiculed for what they are.
Trump may be closer to getting this done than you think. How many Bill Barr's are out there. Seemingly intelligent career professionals that will do anything to see their dream achieved. How many are in the military or police?
Trump never confirms it's a joke
You truly are the Enemy the People. This spliced masterpiece of propaganda neglects to include an important piece of information. After Trump correctly declares ‚ÄúWe are the party of Abraham Lincoln‚Äù. Wallace was from the party of Andrew Johnson and the Klan - a Democrat. #FACT
U R right The coup is underway! and I am really shocked at the lack of urgent response. Trump now has a secret police grabbing people off the street and the news reports it like a traffic jam on the highway.  Democratic politicians say it is "wrong"?? &amp; Reps support it evidently
Have we finally found the GOP's "bridge too far" with Trump?
Do not mistake this as 'unbelievable'. No! Believe it. Trump is no idiot. He is king of the 'con', scams &amp; being a thug &amp; getting away with it. He floats this dirt &amp; then denies &amp; pays others to explain it. He's undermining the election before it's even happens! #DictatorTrump
Trump floats election delay, congressional Republicans reject idea
um, you and your daughter voted by mail there, sherlock.
Review: 'The Fight' documents the ACLU in the age of Trump
Please don't until after the Trump administration.  You and your cronies keep me sane.
Like he wouldn‚Äôt be harmed if Trump had the power. Trump would be destroying all his followers. He‚Äôs a killer.
Holy Shit! Donald Trump says his supporters can't be persuaded to be healthy when they're balls deep in their own sisters.
NY-27. Was like Trump+25. If we're lucky we'll get that to like Trump+15 lol but that's probably obscenely optimistic.
I'm sorry, but the bullshit fearmongering  used to do "for" Republicans he's now doing "for" Democrats. His only means of communicating is bloviation, hyperbole and insufferable historical quotations. We need to reject HIS politics.
After Trump‚Äôs campaign made him sign away liability.
BREAKING: Mike Pence in a motor vehicle accident with a Trump Campaign bus:
Great news!
But unlike Trump they weren't trying to rig things.
Trump is funnier.  Biden's would be funnier in the slapstick farce way of Weekend at Bernie's, except that Bernie is still alive just not there.  At least it would be funny until you actually needed someone there.
I stronly suggest that you,Mr. Trump, turn your senators around and approve the $3 trillion dollar stimulus package ,or you will have a war on your hands with THE PEOPLE! There will be  a revolution and people will steal food and break into stores!
I really hope it comes down to this and all the trump appointees say no, in an ultimate and final move of betrayal, cementing him as "that president who kept hiring people who hated him"
Just listened to 20 mins of NPR in the car. I've been podcast listening, so it has been a while.  My gosh, how can anyone listen?!?  Every question was either: a) please tell me how this hurts Trump? or b) this can't help Trump, can it?   Terrible journalism, worse listening.
Seems like Mr Trump getting off over the death of a black man is very on-brand for him
Can Trump pardon Mike Flynn even while this shit head judge plays his games?
Sad Herman Cain died from internal racism by following Trump and going over the cliff with him
It was covid  brought on by following trump to not wear a mask. When will people learn
But that's the thing. Under any other circumstances, Carter would be there. Trump would still not.
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
Trump hates everyone who refuses to serve him and his selfish interests. He has concern for no one but himself.
You meant Donald Trump  the most corrupt president ever. Donald Trump the divider the racist in chief.
Economy tanks, Trump muses about delaying the election
US government drops effort to silence Trump‚Äôs ex-lawyer
I‚Äôve had the same thought. What helps me out is that I also thought maybe Trump would have resigned right before everything went south and declared ‚ÄúI was the best president, I got everything done in less than 4 years, I‚Äôm amazing. Now Pence can just hold down the fort.‚Äù
Cain may have died from COVID19, but a contributing factor was Trump Kool-Aid.
BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election. Trump will cling to power an any way possible, even at the cost of our democracy.  #ResistTrump
We have a President of the United States who can credibly have these kinds of charges laid against him by other political leaders in public. Think about how low he has brought our Presidency.
If we dont get trump out on november 3rd there will be no post offices in the future. #Saveourpostoffices
Yeah right; thanks for the sprinkling of fairy dust Politico but every single action by trump and conservatives indicate that what they ACTUALLY plan to do is flat-out steal the election by sabotaging USPS/vote by mail, massive voter supression etc
Yeah, news came out this morning that he died of covid after getting infected after Trump's rally.
Maybe trump will give the eulogy
Oh, is it really NEWS to Trumpers that the majority of people think Trump is corrupted waste and needs to go? No kidding, it's like you guys hate all of America, except for the white, rich people who brag about guns. The rest of us can join the kids in cages. Smh. #deporttrumpers
Why isn't Trump at Lewis' funeral today? Oh, cuz he's RACIST and not even W will speak his name. That's why we have riots. He wants to contest and delay the election, so Trumpers, there will be more than riots soon, which is what you've wanted. To exterminate everything not you.
Thank you,  We cannot allow the fascism of Donald Trump stomp out the freedom of Americans. We owe John Lewis that.
I can only see it growing in intensity if Trump is out of power. It becomes a heroic lost cause narrative
We are voting for trump of coarse. NY.
I do wish Trump would drop out. Biden is an awful candidate but there is so much energy to defeat Trump I think Biden wins.
And Trump doesn‚Äôt like soldiers that get captured by the enemy but he likes doctors bought by his father to diagnose a phantom bone spur. You know, a bone spur can be removed.
I wonder if Trump was invited to John Lewis‚Äôs funeral
If the election is not delayed as Trump wishes, I highly recommend his supporters stage an epic boycott and not show up on November 3rd.
Allow me to educate you. I had to take Constitutional law. Election can only be delayed by full congress and independent of that, trump‚Äôs  term expires on 1/20, full stop.
The fact that George W Bush is a Republican, but also knows how to be a respectful human being... Makes it apparent that Trump is seriously that terrible. Just stating the obvious. #DumpTrump2020 #RIPJohnLewis
And let's see how long you actually keep your testicles.  #RemoveTrumpNow #FailureInChief #LoserInChief #TrumpsterFire
Sure...Cronyn is worried crapless Trump and Barr will try it, but I‚Äôd bet Cronyn would join them.
And as we've seen, he'll have already acted. And as we're seeing, the federal officers responsible for enforcing the orders of Congress or the Courts are answering to Trump.ü§∑
Stop watching Fox News and Trump. Anyone can go to a stupid march and say they are pro life.  Trump is not prolife.  But hey it‚Äôs not easy convincing Catholic MAGA cult followers.
No one should die from Covid. But the paragon of virtue you describe in your tweet of your grief is the man who tweeted this below. A man who could have avoided his own death, and others as well. He literally died for Trump. Was it worth it?
If the election is postponed past February, the charges against Trump will have to be dropped, time expired
I've been blocked by #Roc's own mouthpiece for Trump, none other than B-Lons himself. I replied to his tweet about #HermanCain: "A terrible loss. And a sad wake-up call for many that COVID-19 is real and it has the power to kill. We must do what we can to help save lives."
. How do you know Trump was "joking" about delaying the election? Did you talk to him about it? No? Why would you think this is a joke?   Do you think it's a joke to undermine our elections and our institutions of democracy?
::Trump suggests pushing off the election::  "..."  ::Pelosi passes mandatory mask policy for House members and staff::  "OMG AUTHORITARIAN!!"  All in the same day, people. Whew.
This is a lie. Trump is cutting funding for testing, closing testing centers, and slowing testing, because he's blatantly stated that if we stop testing, there will be lower numbers. He doesn't care if people die. He just wants to look good.  Blood is on your hands.
Frankly it can be hard to feel bad for someone who takes a foolish risk (Cain's participation in Trump's Tulsa rally) and suffers for it
Frankly it can be hard to feel bad for someone who takes a foolish risk (Cain's participation in Trump's Tulsa rally) and suffers for it
Joe Biden has our support. Donald Trump has done nothing for internet consumers except facilitate more mergers and stripping away consumer protections. Competition remains an illusion for so many, so we need #netneutrality to protect us from yet more monetization.
Hopefully after the election and Trump wins we can dismantle the Marxist teachers union. Then rebuild the whole school system "Build Back Better". LOL
That's exactly what they wanted so the can blame Trump. Keep schools closed so both parents can't go back to work. Keep the lockdowns crash the economy. It's clear the Democrats want this country destroyed and will sacrifice anything.
Not to mention the sheer, almost incomprehensible immorality of the ruling political movement. People like Trump and McConnell are about the clearest, purest form of evil you can get without actually committing genocide
Gives a more reason now not to trust the US mail. They are just pissed because President Trump won‚Äôt bail them out
Better yet ..... we will send Trump up to you.
Trump‚Äôs Four-Pinocchio interview on Russian bounties
For what it's worth: multiple ranking members of the military say they will step in when Trump tries to delay/ cancel the election and/or refuses to leave. Here's a good breakdown of possibilities:
If she didn't have the corrupt intent to hide her dirty tracks we wouldn't have Trump. Her emails, Wall St. speeches and general dishonesty very much caused these crises.

What do you think tRump's job will be in prison?
How‚Äôs this: ‚ÄúAn ANTIFA rioter, taking a break from looting, snuck into Cain‚Äôs hospital room disguised as an orderly and poured a vial of poison (provided to him by George Soros, of course) into Cain‚Äôs IV, all to undermine Trump.‚Äù
Can President Trump delay the election?
Can President Trump delay the election?
Omg..stop drooling Joey! Tanked under Trump? You need 2 learn what it takes 2 use your brain. B4 the virus the stock market was at an alltime hi, the US was set up to get $ 4 trades w/ other countries (which Obama never did), etc. Stop dreaming  night about Obama or just wipe.
Me waiting for the conspiracy theories to hatch: 1. Murdered by leftist doctors to embarrass Trump; 2. He would‚Äôve lived if they‚Äôd allowed him to take Hydroxychloriquine; 3. He was infected on purpose by a Biden supporter.
No, Trump is just less concerned about telling lies, and dressing a can of spam up to look like a t-bone steak, and you've succumbed to the virus that is his narrative. Consider for a second I'm right, and imagine how you're making other people feel.
I‚Äôd like every GOP senator and congressman to be asked about this instead of Trump‚Äôs nonsense and asked why they haven‚Äôt acted to fix it
"Last month, Cain had tested positive for COVID-19, just a little¬†over a week after he had attended a Trump campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20."
I'd like to suggest you get therapy. If not for yourself, for your son. You live in this delusion that your 51 years of experience on this earth have somehow made you all-knowing, and understanding of the pains other people live with, and Trump does the same, hence you're a fan.
What is so remarkable is that ignorant, selfish, boorish #trump #republicans are actually proud of their ignorance, selfishness and grotesque behavior. SAD!
Gov. Cuomo on President Trump's suggestion to delay election: "He has no authority to change an election date, that would take an act of Congress, and I don't believe there's any desire for that."
Trump proposes delay federal elections until it's 'safe'‚Äîsomething he doesn't have the power to do
A friend of mine just said said that all those Kpop stans who reserved tickets for that trump rally probably saved lives...in 2020, trolling helped people. WTF.
Thoughts on tRump trying to delay the election? He's fucking terrified! Get that squatter out!
#WeWillVote for President Trump!!!
But he learned quick it was going to be a war. If he beat John Kerry this wouldn‚Äôt be happening. He dared to beat the female candidate. The unstability of that side is truly frightening. They‚Äôll do much more to destroy shit than trump ever could have
#JohnLewisMemorial where is Donald J Trump oh wait he's out protecting the suburbs from people like John Lewis
Portnoy asked him if he regrets it. He had the perfect life. Why fuck it up. Trump answered it well I think. Check it out. I mean if it‚Äôs narcissism, he‚Äôs got the biggest case in history. It would dwarf Michael Jordan‚Äôs which would be tough to do. I think we wanted to help.
See what, exactly? The creation of Trump Pizza?
The only thing I can say in defense of trump is that he has been getting HAMMERED from all sides since day one. Maybe if the jellyfish stood up and guided him, he wouldn‚Äôt be such a mess. Dudes trying to open a safe with bullets coming from everywhere. Who succeeds there?
Just wait until Trump sends out "warmest condolences to the family of his incredible HUD Secretary."
Herman Cain dies from coronavirus after being hospitalised following Trump's Tulsa rally
Congress' Approval Drops to 18%, Trump's Steady at 41%  Are 41% of Americans racist morons? Apparently. SAD!
It was. Portnoy is ok with kneeling. Trump wasn‚Äôt. But it was cordial. And that‚Äôs fine. That‚Äôs opinion and policy. I‚Äôd rather tax cuts vs free shit than ‚Äúthat guys senile‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that asshole‚Äù. There‚Äôs zero value in that.
Nothing that ever happens will make Trump's people take it seriously.
I‚Äôm in Hair died because he didn‚Äôt wear a mask at a Trump rally everybody else did
Wow!  Just finding out about this now.  If Trump had a soul, this would anguish it until the day he dies.
Vote third party. That‚Äôs all I can say. You‚Äôll probably agree with JJ on most everything. At least you can feel good about it after. lol.  I did that last time. I‚Äôm going to get dirty this time. Did you watch Portnoy interview trump?  Why can‚Äôt trump always be that guy.
I‚Äôm going to give Donald Trump credit for this: he is preparing to make commercials for pizza joints starting in January. Hopefully, he won‚Äôt drive them bankrupt, too.
President Trump has mused about delaying this year's election based on unsupported conspiracy theorizing about the integrity of voting during the coronavirus disaster.
What is what we plan to restore after we ditch Trump on November 3?
This is what makes it so hard for me. I couldn't be more opposed to Trump and his leadership, how hes handled a crisis, etc. But the "woke" cancel bullshit is what makes me want him to win again.
look at him! no brain! no thoughts! just ‚ÄúTRUMP‚Äù
We are living in Poe's "The Masque of the Red Death," and Trump is Prospero.
I do not speak kindly of the dead who were horrible people in life.  The fact that Herman Cain died from the virus that he and his friends tried to downplay is another example of how irresponsible, selfish and careless the Trump administration have been about COVID-19 in general.
LEMME TROLL TRUMP SUPPORTERS OMG
Which scares the dickens out of me. A Terrified Trump is more reckless and vengeful than ever!
I am with you President trump.
100%. This is when the LP should put their ‚Äúsquad‚Äù in place.  Reps have become jellyfish. They‚Äôre spineless. That‚Äôs a massive part of the problem. Trump is kind of third party. He‚Äôs not a king. He needs support and the reps are too spineless to not kowtow.
Don't fall for this garbage. All the Dems know is cheating and lying. Corrupt. Checking out "Trump Mulls Delaying General Election" on Tea Party Command Center:
Trump proposes to delay federal elections until it's 'safe'  #DumpTrump #DumpTrump2020 #TrumpIsACriminal
I hear you. Like I said. These are my opinions. This will pass. We will recover. And when that happens, I have certain things I cannot vote against and Biden has the wrong opinion on all of them. So I have to flip trump. I normally go 3rd party, but the left has pushed me too far
So, worth noting, I am NOT a fan of Biden. I am not likely to vote for him. I just will not vote for Trump. If gun to my head I HAD to pick one? I'd easily vote Biden. But Im much more likely to write in/3rd party than vote Biden.
CNBC: "Cain had attended Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis."
I need more than ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trump‚Äù now like i needed more than ‚ÄúI have a vagina‚Äù in 2016.  To me, dems have either horrible ideas or no ideas. It‚Äôs I‚Äôm not trump or free everything for all. I really wish the LP would get it together. Learn from the socialist.
President Trump is going through the same process... except that the initial ideas and questions come out during press conferences and on Twitter. 4/8
I don‚Äôt think trump burned the house down. China did &amp; rioters did. You could say he did t try to put it out well enough. But people doing things because they‚Äôre mad he won isn‚Äôt him burning it down IMO. Plus JB assisted √† Guy that didn‚Äôt do great.
Big fan of Trump. Not a fan of this idea. Even if genuine it looks bad. Hold the election on the normal date in person. Wear a mask if you want to. No mail in voting, no election delays. Trump will win.
This November, we will elect Donald Trump out of office! üó≥Ô∏èüí™üëã#WeWillVote
But I don‚Äôt really see a leader. I see trump and a guy that will fold the rioters demands. I think The dem leaders in this city are allowing it because they think it dumps trump. Joe has probably promised funds to rebuild if he wins. So they are all in and we‚Äôll all foot the bill
Also, he was at Pres. Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa without a mask less than 2 weeks before his diagnosis.
None of them in the past few hundred years. You aren't attacked for being white, you're attacked for supporting Trump. I'm as white as they come, and I have NEVER been attacked, not even once. This isn't payback or retribution, it's disgust.
A rover takes off for Mars, Trump floats the idea of delaying the November election, Herman Cain dies from coronavirus, the funeral of John Lewis is about to start.   It's not noon yet.
Rochester NY (Kodak's home) media  touting this as very positive. It seems odd to me. Value your perspective and am asking if you could address in more detail. Worry that Kodak is in cahoots with the trump administration in a nefarious way.
Barr. Barr is hands down the worst of all the craven, bootlicking little goblins in Trump‚Äôs orbit (and that‚Äôs saying something. Giuliani. Ross. Stone. As you mentioned, pompeo. And on and on for days)
It‚Äôs unfair that the one person from Trump‚Äôs orbit to succumb to Covid is a black guy.   Don‚Äôt worry, though. Louie Gohmert is trying to fix that.
Not at all. Lifelong republican who hates what trump did to my party. He likely caught the trump virus at the trump rally.
His last public appearance at a Trump rally without a mask.
MasterTroll. Not that he also isn't an autocratic fascist catastrophe that sets a new low bar on politicians too, though. Trump is like when you start smelling something bad and realize you stepped in dog excrement that morning and didn't realize it until you tracked it all over.
Nope, you can‚Äôt do it, Mr. Trump.
Trump showing his true fascist autocratic self and trolling Twitter at the same time. But it will make a great new ad from the Lincoln folks.
Tempting as it is to say that fools like Cain who attend goddamn trump rallies in closed spaces full of idiots without masks deserve to get sick, nobody deserves to die just because they‚Äôre stupid and he‚Äôs ultimately as much a victim of trumps failure as the other 150,000 victims
Trump killed Herman Cain.
A drugmaker with monopoly rights made a deal with Trump &amp; Co. to get paid twice If its coronavirus vaccine succeeds. Even if it fails the firm makes a profit.  The astonishing story of inept Trump dealmaking told by  is now at
I‚Äôm a conservative libertarian. There are certain things I‚Äôm not flexible on and there are currently 0 candidates outside trump that represent those issues en mass for me. So the enemy of my enemy is my friend. I voted Johnson last time and it was useless. I have to hold my nose
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
He posted an anti mask post before his last public appearance, at a Trump rally in June.   Where he was not wearing a mask.   Is it still a hoax now, Trumpers?  I wish his family positive vibes as they grieve his loss.
Another victim of the trump virus.
Man who went to Trump rally without a mask in rona hot spot dies.
I appreciate not wanting a victory for Trump.  Know that I want a victory for Biden no more than I want one for Trump.  Neither is an option for me.    I will be voting for  in a state Biden will likely win handily.  Because voting for her is my only option
Trump is a complete moron! Not knowing where to go to vote is on him. Every voter receives confirmation of their voter registration,  as well as where that particular individual goes to vote. The fact he went to 3 different places should have disqualified him from the election!
Donald Trump should RESIGN Pass it on!
I guess you wish you can take back the  ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äù is off his rocket tweet. Instead it‚Äôs Trump who‚Äôs crazy!!
Trump is counting on the Pelosi reelection would also not happen because of delay.  Her reelection needs to happen as Jan 3rd 2021 her term ends.  Congress needs to address these unforseen "loopholes", Full disclosure by politcal candidate
Would you approve of Trump delaying the election?
Biden will become a far left puppet. Too risky. Plus he ain‚Äôt lasting 8 years. If his VP is hard left, I‚Äôm out.  I‚Äôm voting trump. Won‚Äôt matter in NY, but 3rd party is written off as Alex Jones crazies. But maybe if trump closes the gap, they will pay more attention.
Reported this and a couple of his other tweets that involve misinformation on voting, and possible voter suppression! I'm sure nothing will be done about them, but this trying to steal an election he's gonna lose by 25M votes has got to Stop! Trump is endangering our democracy!
Goes on multiple city political tour in June. Goes to an unmasked indoor trump rally in a COVID hot spot. Dies a month later after getting COVID.  I mean, RIP and all but the willful ignorance cost him his life. The shits real.
This is dangerous. We have time to prepare for the election in a pandemic. We also need Congress to provide funding.
Trump really tryna get the election put on hold because of a virus he doesn‚Äôt even beleive is a big deal.   Nah fam, we gonna vote you out on November 3rd, masked up.
I dont understand that logic of voting Trump when all those things going on happened under his term
trump wants to DELAY the election and is using lies about mail-in voting to justify his rhetoric. Don't let them get away with it.    #delay #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpPressConference #MichelleObamaPodcast
But are you voting for Biden?  That‚Äôs no better. I have a number of friends in the LP that have always voted 3rd party. All of them are voting trump. Biggest reason is reopening, riots &amp; leftism gone wild. I wonder how rampant that is. Taking 2% from the LP is a big swing
The stay at home stuff is so easy to turn back to Trump though. People *should* be able to see through thag bullshit
I know personally, a Republican voter my whole life would vote for my cat before voting for Trump.
#trump and #trumpvirus kills doggies too.  :-(
Trump will murder Biden in debates that I expect.

Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
As Mary Trump said on  I think he would need some inducement that gave him a way to save face in his own mind.
President Donald Trump suggested delaying the 2020 presidential election this morning, tweeting it will be "the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history."
The sad truth is that  and the rest of his GOP cronies have their heads so far up Trump's ass that they truly believe all of their own lies.  Only remedy is to vote this scum out of office.  Pretty sure this putz wont hold his seat anyway...writing is on the wall!
Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, isn‚Äôt doing his job. He must clear out.
I'm voting for Donald Trump
Trump Floats Whether to ‚ÄòDelay the Election,‚Äô Something He Cannot Legally Do. Trailing badly in the polls, Trump baselessly suggested the November election would be ‚Äúthe most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT‚Äù in history.
"...if you owned 100,000 Kodak shares on Monday morning, they were worth $210,000. By 10 AM on Wednesday, those same shares were worth $5.3 million."  Trump and the GOP have been using this pandemic to fleece the country. They are doing it right in front of everyone.
Something something inside trading something.  The entire thing will bottom out in a few weeks because Trump is pumping money into it to make hydroxychloroquine, which he will push, again, as a "cure" for COVID.
You know, a headline like this does nothing to further your integrity. You and I both know Congress dictates the date of the general election. Why do you need this click bait headline? I think ‚ÄòTrump redefines stupidity AGAIN thinking he can delay the election‚Äô would have worked.
Fuck Trump
Fact is 1. Trump praised it and orange man bad. 2. It could decrease deaths and fear which would allow the economy to flourish which would help the Orange man.
A. Absentee voting and Mail-in voting are the SAME THING, and both are 100% safe &amp; secure (you've used it yourself, as have many others in the Trump admin.)  B. Keep dreaming about delaying the election. You're going down on November 3rd and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
Look for those who downplay Trump's threat to delay the election, as not a threat because he doesn't have the authority.    Throughout history, fascists have always gained traction, by people not taking their threats seriously.
The thing about Trump suggesting delaying the election is that it is not news that Trump is like this, but the fact that he's not afraid of the immediate censure of his entire party to make this suggestion just demonstrates how far the GOP has fallen.
Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
I'm constantly floored by the fact that so much of what Trump has *actually* done is what racist conservatives told us Obama was going to do (but never did). Where is the outcry? This man just suggested delaying the election, for crying out loud. Hypocrisy at its finest.
Better idea, throw Trump out of office until we can have the election!
Only his "I love the poorly educated" believe this is in anyway viable....Trump is NOT A KING OR A DICTATOR. He's in for a Tremendous, Bigly-Biggest Ever ELECTION LOSS EVER...Even bigger than a Putin opponent loss.
Trump suggests the US should 'Delay the Election' because of his baseless mail-in voter fraud fears
Kind of late to walk back months of silence on universal masking.  Until Trump does a PSA that is repeatedly played on FOX news and their idiot hosts get on board we are screwed.
Umm, did your sycophantic yes-men suggest this to you? Because YOU, "President" #DictatorDonald tRUMP, CANNOT. It is set by FEDERAL LAW, and cannot be UNILATERALLY changed. Also, nowhere near enough votes in CONGRESS to change. #BlueWave2020 coming for #GestapoTrump!

Y'knew this was coming. Here it is.  BBC News - Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election
Trump is crafting ways to rig this election and he's been setting up American for this for months.  He's a con man who knows how to setup the mark and make the con work for them. They play a long game working to steal from you in a way that you don't realize until it's too late.
Excited because he isn‚Äôt trump.  I think the moderate middle is more rational &amp; there‚Äôs an argument to be made either direction Whoever sells it better wins.  I‚Äôm waiting on debates to see how it looks like it might fall.
Unemployment corrected to 16.3%. Black unemployment 16.8%, the highest in more than 10 years. Latino unemployment 17.6%.  150,000 deaths - from the virus alone. Russian bounties- Trump silent.  Any leader taking a victory lap over these numbers is completely out of touch.
I think debates will tell a lot. If trump can sell and Biden stumbles, polls might snap right. But if Biden can pull it together and trump resorts to name calling he could bury himself.
The extreme left isnt excited to vote Biden. They're excited to not vote Trump. I think Biden can pull more than enough middle/disgruntled R to easily win. Hillary had no shot at doing that, Joe I think can
By the time Don Lemon is on tonight the headline will be Trump has declared himself god emporer for life
Unemployment corrected to 16.3%. Black unemployment 16.8%, the highest in more than 10 years. Latino unemployment 17.6%.  150,000 deaths Russian bounties - Trump silent  Virus response - non existent  Any leader taking a victory lap over these numbers is completely out of touch.

Most suburbanites are white. Yes, there are people of color in the suburbs as well, but the % doesn't represent the mix of people as a whole. And many white suburbanites would feel more comfortable if the suburbs stayed white. This is the population trump is signaling to.

Im sure Adam Silver is weeping at the fact that a racist wana be Donald Trump isnt going to be tuning in. Gona be a long fall of no sports for Charlie.
I think you're missing my point. Maybe I should have stated it better. When Trump or a Republican says something stupid, he's an imbecile. When a democrat or someone perceived as being against Trump says something stupid, ie Fauci or Biden, it's a lack of info or he's evolved.

Enough with it. We get it, you love Trump.
Here's a thought: If there's no election of Pres by noon, Jan. 20, Trump's term in office ends, per Article 2 &amp; per 20th Amend. He doesn't just remain till he's replaced.  W/no elected leaders, NANCY PELOSI, Speaker of House becomes 'acting President' till matter is resolved.
The only reason   or  are not bailing out the  is because they benefit from a Trump admin.End of.

No, he didn't NOT act immediately. He dithered for months and spiked a coordinated national plan. In the meantime, the virus came to us not from China but from Europe. Trump is both incompetent and corrupt. He is responsible, too, for Herman Cain's death. To hell with him--soon.

Or, it's both true that Trump didn't want folks talking about the economic collapse he caused AND that he is planning to undermine the election and its aftermath, and the latter is the greater emergency.
I think God not feeling us right now, maybe it was separating families &amp; placing children in cages, or probably thinking trump was the 2nd coming. So now we have a plague with over 151,000 dead, over 4.5 million infected and over 30 million unemployed Americans.

Donald J. Trump defends Putin, raped children with Epstein, raped women, kills Americans with negligence, gets impeached for treason, cheats on his wives with porn stars and hookers, and this who the GOP chooses as their moral and political leader.
With over 151,000 people in the US dead from COVID-19, the US GDP down 9.5%, and a plummeting approval rating, Trump on Thursday continued to push wildly misleading claims about mail-in voting as part of a larger, clear effort to undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 election.
When in the movie did they refer to him as a child of two worlds? And, the only reason they wanted him to leave was out of fear of Zod and company trashing the earth. And, only through Lex's machinations, did they hate him. The US government didn't help. Imagine Trump's reaction.
It's too late for anyone in the Federalist Society to salvage any sort of face. Trump is a Frankenstein's monster that took conservatives decades to make. He's a product of everything wrong with America, and those who supported him should just quit politics. Their sum is fascism.
We're not safe in Donald Trump's America.
Trump Failed America: Don the Dumb  via
The only think that Trump has accomplished while in office is that he makes GWB seem presidential. I‚Äôve not forgotten my hatred for Dubya, but I‚Äôd trade Trump any day of the week for him. That‚Äôs a sad statement.
Are you suggesting that with Hillary we don‚Äôt clean up the DOJ?  Also, flipping the Senate is, IMO, paramount, even over the Presidency.  Are you suggesting Dems will continue where tRump left off?
Yes sometimes they say things to get the dogs off their track and ‚Äúchange their mind‚Äù later on. I don‚Äôt trust McConnell almost as much as I don‚Äôt trust trump.
Another Trump accomplishment: worst GDP quarterly decline. Ever. ‚ÄúWe are going to win so much, you‚Äôre going to be sick and tired of winning.‚Äù
Hate is what Trump got, and sadly someone has to respond. Have a nice weekend too.
It demonstrates a complete lack of an ability to think things through to their logical ends. Trump and the forces of white supremacy want to be ‚Äúproven right,‚Äù and this gives them the opportunity to claim victory even in a ‚Äúsincere‚Äù loss.

Who is the 3% that moved to approval of Trump based on his performance in July?
I genuinely don't understand how this is a criticism.   Many politicians' accounts are run by social media staffers and I've never seen polling data to suggest the public has a problem with that.  I HAVE seen ample polling data suggesting Trump's personal tweeting is unpopular
It may sound strange but I see Paul Prenter as a Trump-esque bad guy dropping offensive comments for no reason
Chris Ruddy is ridiculous. Conflicting advice? Trump listening? People opposed Trump‚Äôs travel ban. Whaaa? Since when did Trump give a crap what others thought? Only as a retort. One time No Masks. New evidence. New mandate. Chris Ruddy is living Trump‚Äôs alternate reality. Insane!
For all his alleged dealmaking  skills Trump and his moronic progeny have ceded the Middle  East to Putin and the Far East to Xi-soon we‚Äôll be paying $50 for a gallon of gas or $100 for a mask!
Exactly. Trump will have some corrupt company come up with almond milk and hydro chloroquine and call it a vaccine. Don‚Äôt fall for it.
I agree! A+?? lol Near the end of the interview, Ruddy's grade on Trump's corona crisis response was down to "a pretty darn good job" on the economy, the best part of his response. Sounds like his real overall grade is B- at best...at that's still a lie.

What you are doing is special pleading, exempting politicians (Obama) you agree with from the very standards you set for politicians (Trump) you disagree with.  It's also opportunism.

I have this fantasy for January 20th, 2021. Biden finishes his oath of office, he nods to a group of federal agents, who then wrangle Donald Trump into an unmarked van.
If Biden wins the election, what would that do to tech stocks? When it comes to regulation of the tech industry, Joe Biden ‚Äúis seen as more moderate‚Ä¶than some of his challengers for the Democratic nomination would have been."

Can he really do that? Can't the governor deploy the Guard to fight the Feds, if it comes to that? I assumed everyone was trying to avoid full-on civil war, but if Trump tries to call out the Guard... who has ultimate control? I thought they served the states.  F*ck us.

Trump is disgusting
Obama‚Äôs FBI under James Comey gave Epstein a pass  The same FBI that had time to spy on the Trump campaign
He assumed the risk because trump made it a political imperative that those surrounding him not show weakness by wearing a mask. This is mr trump‚Äôs fault whether you think so or not.
You‚Äôre by far the worst person in America, other than Trump.
Question for the class: if Trump‚Äôs claim of problems with voting is correct, what‚Äôs he been doing for 4 years?  Last time he whined the process was ‚Äúrigged,‚Äù so wouldn‚Äôt fixing that be the bare minimum of the job he was hired to do? So either he couldn‚Äôt do his job or wouldn‚Äôt.

2-to-1 margin, Americans said in a Quinnipiac poll that they thought it would NOT be safe to send children back to elementary school in the fall. And by roughly the same spread, they said they disliked how Mr. Trump was dealing w/the reopening of schools.
What a pleasure it was 2 hear #Obama speak 2day at #JohnLewisFuneral.  Listening 2  was comforting, reassuring &amp; hopeful.  When  speaks his drone-like speech makes me feel anxiety, disgust &amp;  anger.   What do you feel listening to #Obama? to #trump?
Many people knew Trump would be a disaster President. But not many predicted this:
Also please stop dropping fake tweet memes....if you really want to impress us go to their pages and retweet the actual orginals...cause that same place you're getting these from has been known to post fake tweets from Trump as well.
I hope Biden turns trump over to Iran.   I really do.  In my heart of hearts he deserves to walk the streets of Portland unaccompanied no security no weapons. Let the people have him.
I apologize for Comin at you crazy, but bush still terrible and should always be terrible. Next thing you know we gon be looking back on trump the same way when president Tucker Carlson or whoever in office
Why would people support a racist, lying, corrupt President? It reveals a lot about them and the karma they will get.  I will tell you this much, if you voted for Trump in 16, society will give you a pass. If you vote for him again we will know you are a racist. #BurnItDown
What kind of loser tries to ‚Äúcancel‚Äù a small business owner simply Bc they have conflicting ideologies? This is the opposite of supporting free speech &amp; expression. Come on ppl. Start acting like human beings. #cancelcancelculture
Donald Trump is counting on having millions his thralls in the street who believe that the election was rigged. It's not going to be as easy as you think. This will not be a contest in the courts. This may be a contest between the magats and the rest of us.

The reason DHS is doing this is because George Bush during 9/11 gave them the authority.  The President Obama came along and tighten the screws even more.  And now we have President Trump building on the foundation that his predecessors gave him.

That‚Äôs just silly. Did you watch the Biden press conference? He took the mask off to talk... and it was the Trump campaign which said masks are encouraged.
Honestly At first I thought it was Megan Rapinoe
People are being way too overconfident &amp; don't understand the extent to which this country is dumb and racist. Trump has killed 150k+ ppl &amp; golfs while ppl are terrified how they are going to keep their home. Yet they will still vote for him.
What is it with Trump and Clinton lol? Thank God Barack Obama is not associated with these perverts!
WAIT.... so if the left says not all protesters are starting riots, then how can they say all cops are bastards? Also, how are all Trump supporters racists?  I‚Äôm apolitical but I just see these things and I‚Äôm like, how the heck do people not see this? Does that make sense?

For me it‚Äôs Harris. Smart , Articulate and will prosecute Donald Trump.
Propaganda works through repetition. Trump is a skilled propagandist.
