I think what Mr Souza described is the Trump base! Obviously he is uninformed when it comes to who likes Trump! Less educated are not one of the characteristics of this group
Giraffe FAIL  via  Trump VS Ramps... hopefully this one will be him falling all the way out of the White House.
Just curious! I have been asking this for months with no answers! So tell me how is Trump’s vanity wall going to stop this?
Unbelievably and Incredibly I sensitive but no one would ever accuse trump and his ilk of having the sensitivity to care!
Do you think these trump supporters seem so pissed lately is because they know he’s getting his ass kicked in Nov.?
A great representation of Trump supporters! Not a single minority!
Hypothetically   If the attendees at the trump joke tonight catch corona, could they hold the golf course and therefore trump responsible. The bill hasn’t passed in Congress t
I love seeing this set of words. They are great words. The best words. My new favorite talk shit about Trump words lol. And I'm being serious, not sarcastic. Honestly.
But China and Iran don’t want Trump? Is Biden weak with them? You guys are idiots
Really work with more communities? Like Sweden-I don’t recall Sweden allowing any of its citizens burn things down-left or right. Democrats allow to keep tempers up-see look what’s wrong-it’s trump elect us it stops-that’s a threat-
We should pull Trump's passport before the election, he's a flight risk. Putin is chilling the vodka and heating up the girls. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace

Watching Joy Reid the Reidout, Trump is doing a speech about virus from his ritzy country club, and his rich members are going to make it look like he has a favorable crowd. All in shorts and polos. How fuckin low can you get. Rich people who pay hundreds of thousands of dollars.
FATHER the SLEEPER has AWAKEN....Donald Trump, WE come for you! How can this be, Because BIDEN is the KWISATCH HADERACH. #TrumpKillsSeniors
They thought Trump wanted to close them.
Trump, Graham, and Ron Johnson are using the American flag as toilet paper, ENOUGH. Vote All these Russian assets the F*CK OUT. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
I am not fat but well built. Absolutely for Trump or Pence.
Trump's kinda Man?  One's that do this to women.  Just Vote Blue.
Hey Eagle, you should do your research.  That wasn’t trump.  The departments in charge of that were put in place by Obama.  What else you got?
President Trump needs to act this is blasphemy 👎😀🇺🇸
Is Ron Johnson, a US Senator in cahoots with the Russians to help steal the election for Trump, by trying to discredit Joe Biden, where the F*CK is the FBI? This is the United States if true Ron Johnson is a piece of 💩. #GOPComplicitTraitors
Trump wants to kill TikTok. So stupid, because 1) all social media platforms are sharing data with China and 2) it's the only social media platform that's actually good for kids.

The BS of the first two sentences aside- that he thinks Trump's critics have not left their states is comically ignorant.
Here we go...buckle up.  I so hope Trump doesn’t mandate this.
Just think Lindsey Graham, you and your buddy Trump can go golfing as much as you want after November 3rd. That is of course,If Trump isn't going to court trying to stay out of Jail. #TrumpIsALaughingStock
Someone should tell the F--in Morons on FOX that working Americans don't have a job to go to. FOX is out of touch with reality, as is dementia Trump.
There is as long as you can use the numbers to hit Trump over the head with.
Let me be clear.  If you are a Republican, then act like one and stand true to your principles, even if I disagree with them.  If you are a Re-TRUMP-plican, you are part of the problem and need to be voted out because you are spinless and have abandoned the beliefs of the party
Kanye West and Kim Krashdidian, walk around with gold jewelry on their hands. He's trying to get votes to help Trump. Yes Trump, the guy who spits in the face of Democracy. #TrumpHoaxedAmerica
Well she is 80. Trump/Biden shouldn’t be running this country either in their mid 70’s but I digress.
Trump announced a new executive order that bans U.S. transactions with #TikTok owner #Bytedance and #China tech titan #Tencent, which runs the messenger app #WeChat
Trump is racist. But as VP....you can’t say that. Sounds like Biden has moved on from her and I hope that’s true.
With everything that is going on, trying to chill with my coffee. Listening to Stevie Nick's music, was thinking about the election and Trump. And this is what came on... And I saw Trump's reflection in a snow covered hill Until a LANDSLIDE brought it down. Smile. Vote Biden.
Trump signed an executive order to shut down TikTok. Because you know that is so much more important that the close to 160K deaths since March. Millennials and GenZ have Trumped Trump when it comes to the Social Media Game
Basic geography.  State capitals.   Even if he knew it was coming, Trump wouldn't be able to retain the information.
I enjoy mocking Trump as much as anyone but I just can't get behind the "thighland" thing.  He simply misspoke and quickly corrected himself. Not unlike when Biden recently misspoke and said "millions" when he meant "thousands" and immediately corrected his mistake.
Trump running to avoid prosecution? No, I don’t get that feeling at all. #slander #losers #nhpolitics
So yeah, something is not right here. I’m not buying that they are generally all of a sudden outraged about death , but rather, they sense an opportunity to get Trump and are taking advantage of it.
First off, the original projections were AT LEAST one million.  We are not even 20% of the way to that bottom figure, so why isn’t Trump getting credit for saving so many lives?
There is just something not right, maybe even sinister, but I can’t quite put my finger on it, about the relentless blaming in the media of all the Covid deaths on Trump.
Trump reads the Bible, Yeah right, he's still reading, "In the beginning God created the heavens and Earth." That's only how far he got. #TrumpHoaxedAmerica
Donald Trump’s penchant for crying “hoax” gets the treatment in a stinging new ad that saw #TrumpHoaxedAmerica go viral on Twitter.  via

President Trump won’t give them money now democrats are going after everyone 👎😀🇺🇸
According to Trump today, Joe Biden wants to “hurt God”. Are we living in a Shin Megami Tensei game and I’m just now figuring it out?   Also, Biden... if you need another member for the party I’m IN.
We have to work together and fins middle ground if we are going to defeat Donald Trump.  is doing a great job in doing so
The fact that the American people + trump want the 600 extended. The senate would be idiots not to pass it
Trump has signed executive order that prohibits transactions with TikTok and WeChat parent companies Bytedance and Tencent effective in 45 days
Trump is a blithering IDIOT.
I’m not a Republican but let me tell you, I feel bad for them considering that Trump supporters are giving Republicans a horrible rep. I don’t agree with Republican policies but I can atleast find common ground and be civil with true republicans. I cant find ground with Trumpies.
There’s a difference between true republicans and trump supporters.     are true Republicans who place their country over party. Trump supporters are not Republicans, they are cult members. Trump supporters have  defamed the GOP
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnel, corporate greed, the current state of my country, and my mother: these are going to be the reasons I lose it❤️
As much as I would love to agree with you I don't think that even if Trump loses that we will have seen the last of him. CNN predicted there is even a possibility of him buying into One America News just to keep his mug in front of us.
What are news outlets(not Fox) going to report on when Covid changes course and Trump vacates? What did everyone used to talk about, I forgot.
You love your prez because fox news told you so. Joe doesn't need to apologize to me but show his progressiveness with his actions. A steaming pile of crap is a better potus than tRump.
If my last name were tRump, I'd get the cash from my book and hide my face. No one wants or should follow a Trump, who is pissed at her dysfunctional family whose family is destroying our democracy. F Mary and all the tRumps!
His favorite verse is “ render unto Trump what is Trump’s”
Grew up with that type, recognize!  Trump is a #FakeChristian
I do not understand how any human, with eyes and ears, can see the past 4 years of tRump and say, yeah, I like that. There is something sinister afoot and our democracy is in serious danger! Scary.
Did you see even ten seconds of the Swan interview?  Trump is completely senile and he already has the codes.
When Biden is safely inaugurated we can all sit back and breathe a collective sigh of relief. But then we have to get right to work to repair the damage Trump inflicted.
Reality TV at it's finest. Trump could only dream of the ratings. Jerry Springer should moderate.
Michael is right about being insulting, but the real insult is on the rabid white nationalists who are stupid enough to believe that just because of skin color all Blacks vote together. Just like they voted for an idiot named Trump!
Trump belongs in jail. #TrumpKillsSeniors
This just in Trump claims if elected Biden plans to peg God
Mildly is putting it mildly. I left the Republican party the minute Trump was nominated and haven't looked back. I could see the writing on the wall and wanted nothing to do with that mob.

Then why does Trump keep citing Wall Street pnumbers to tout supposed economic success?
Makes me think Trump is right, we should do less testing
Trump, Where are you moving to now?  New York doesn't want you and Florida is sick of you.  🤡🤡🤡
Because we know who we want!!  I'd take sleepy Joe over Twitter Trump any day!!!
Trump touting America First... while standing in front of tri-lingual packaging.

Trump would dismiss this as fake news although he has never explained adequately how he reaches that conclusion. Unless it was his fake evil twin brother. OMG!! Can you imagine TWO of him?!?
Well, don't sound too much like Trump! I like your tweets!
Ah, but he is the Chosen One! The use of the word demented is entirely appropriate when describing Trump.
Having to deal with actual isolation bc of high risk family members along with worrying about the future of my country due to Trump, and worry about college admissions has my mental health at an all time low. I haven’t left my house in 5 months, I’m stressing over college prep...

Best Trump sign and his name is not even on it.
It’s impossible to be overly anti-Trump.
Wasn’t Trump’s because of religion 😀🇺🇸
You mean like the Trump administration?
Too bad they didn't award Pariah of the Year. Trump would get my vote, which is the only vote he would get from me. Next year I would elect him Prisoner of the Year!
What if it’s true Lincoln stopped plantations from enslaving blacks because they created a system to enslave all people with money &amp; taxes I said from the start this goes back before Trump or Obama It’s like me having a new car after working all my life &amp;
Not required to release your taxes to become President. Trump didn’t “get away with” anything like moron Bill Kristin (smarter than the rest of us) writes. #CrookedJoe Biden is senile &amp;  now comes the excuses for not debating Trump.  Plan now is fraud mail-in voting #nhpolitics
LMAO 🤪 sorry for laughing .   President for Life?Rep Clyburn that’s a bit hypocritical. You have served around 14 terms or 28 years and your 80 years old ? That’s a LIFETIME ! Congressman shut up!This is why we must have TERM LIMITS ✅🇺🇸
It will be. Just so #Trump can boast he got rid of the virus...even though it will still be around 🤔😐😧

The picture is of Biden praying in the AME church in Charleston where he went to mark the anniversary of the massacre of 9 people at a Bible Study. But to the Trump minions, that's a sign of weakness.  Also - note the comments asserting Biden is senile? Russian-driven nonsense.
Glenn, when Trump lies as much as he has in office, an unprecedented amount even for any President, it’s difficult for any rational human being to start with the premise that he’s trying to be accurate. We start with the premise that he’s probably lying to defend his other lies.
Why must Biden be so combative? This certainly isn't the first time he escalated a relatively benign question into full on confrontation.   He would be well served to remain as calm &amp; composed as often as possible to highlight the distinction between him and Trump.
Trump to be re-elected
Mask man who hates Trump supporters.  It’s a New NH.
Biden's campaign should set the debates to only 3 with a condition. Trump must release his tax returns. If a week prior to the 1st debate, the tax returns are not released, that debate is cancelled. 1 week prior to the next debate, if the returns are not released, cancelled etc.
NH.... 4 votes in this family CT - 94 year old dad for Trump MA - in-laws plus extended family - 15 votes for Trump  Trump all the way..👊👊👊🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Head on a swivel is the only way to watch this Administration and its enablers.  and Ukraine could be a significant source of election interference. Early in this presidency, Trump ID’d Johnson as a most useful tool. #nhpolitics
Is that what fly into the explosion? I think Trump should have created special teams of drone pilots. Have the best camera gear installed on them. Then simply deploy the drones over the the protests. Thus taking pics out of sight looking for weapons.   shutter click got you
Hang on. Do y'all actually support Trump?
He is a prime example of what drinking can do to your brain Donald Trump should play the commercial with the egg frying in the pan Show the egg this is Trump Then crack it in the pan this is Biden LOL 👎😀🇺🇸
Can we REALLY afford leaving Trump in office, Coronavirus is killing people at a rate of 1000 a day, 90 days to election, equals 90K dead, then after the election, 78 days until Trump leaves anther 78K. Total deaths  is another 168,000 people. On top of what we have now.
It is very democrat Trump needs to counter with a pick of his own It’s time for the first black VP Candace Owens not half black like Harris Let’s get it on ❤️👍😀🇺🇸
Look, Trump is delusional, we have the worst jobless rate and unemployment since the depression. He is suffering from some form of dementia. Yo-senites, swipply, Ullesssjss S Grant. Can't even pronounce words correctly, and the Fuckin virus is NOT going AWAY. #TrumpIsNotWell
August 2020- 15 known to have followed  April advice are now blind, having seizures or dead; President Trump suggested during a White House briefing that injecting disinfectant might be a possible coronavirustreatment. #TrumpFailedAmerica
President Trump needs to replace Michael Pence because make him a director or an ambassador The president can’t have him debating a black woman because democrats will make it look like a race war He need to replace him with Candace Owens She will tear Kamala Harris apart ❤️👍😀🇺🇸
160,000+ Americans died of COVID-19 because of Trump’s incompetence and 68,000 die each year from lack of Medicare for All.
The real Donald Trump promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, trade deal w/China and temp. Tariffs, denuclearize Iran and N. Korea, a GOP health plan , to name a few... and we should believe this ..why?
LET’S THINK LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP Do we create a society of intelligent human beings that can MOTIVATE SOCIETY TO INVENT better energy sources
While grocery shopping today, I saw someone wearing a Trump 2020 mask.  I was honestly of two minds about this. First, it was good seeing a MAGAt actually following Covfefe-19 procedures. But second, is that really the best they could find? Sheesh.
Boycotting Twitter doesn't seem like it would have the right effect. I think we all know someone at Twitter had to call Jack to make this happen. There's no way an algorithm is watching Trump. But it is watching the rest of us. I kinda wanna get suspended or banned intentionally
Deutsche Bank is taking Trump down!!!
let's face it. You are trying to create a racist America but not with Trump. Do u support ufettered voting rights? Liberal judges who support human equality? A non religious State that doesn't take sides? Jesus never hated or judged. Hypocrites!
as President you made things happen. I'm honored to have voted for you. This Trump idiot on the other hand... I'm honored to have written in your name.
you guys may be hypocrites but u have money and talent. When trump is out, will u go back to supporting hidden racists? States Rights? Cut taxes? War on drugs? Your greatest racist hits?
The thing is, he isn’t new to his job. This never happened in almost 40yrs serving under a number of administrations- Dem &amp; Rep. Whats the difference...Trump.
Tonight, might be a good night for Trump and his grifter family, to leave the USA

If someone watches Trump and notices he can actually engage in a conversation with someone and would rather use their right to vote for him than not vote and risk the alternative does that make them a "moron?" Subjectively insulting someone's opinion isn't an argument
All evidence to the contrary. VOTE TRUMP OUT!!
If u haven’t done it yet after 3.5 years, u don’t deserve another 4 years. VOTE TRUMP OUT!!
Ignoramus Donald Trump sued Nevada for mail in voting, will it even be able to go to court in 90 days? Then he says Obama's eulogy was angry and not what our country is about. Voting is precisely what we are about. John Lewis was about the right to vote. #TrumpsaMoron
Come on man! Sometimes I wonder if the Trump campaign is scripting his idiotic babble.
I agree.  President Trump is the best President ever!!!
I just got a campaign email from my senator in which she says her opponent is supported by Trump and by Corey Lewandowski but never actually says her opponent's name. Fascinating!

#nerdgasm of the week: using "scrcpy" to control my phone from my laptop. Yes, I like Real Keyboards and Mice over tapping a touch screen. Terminal[left] Phone[right] Re: the Wallpaper. It's just me mocking this news story:
Like everywhere else in the country, in the more rural areas of the state, Trump definitely has more, but in the more urban areas, (here that would be cities like Manchester and Nashua), it’s more split, with Biden having a few more.  At least from my observations
What signs? Don’t think I’m aware of this one. Last sign related post I saw was a friend of mine complaining about Trump signs in Dracut, but that’s not really worth tweeting about.
I like your optimism about New Hampshire, but as one who lives just over the border from there, I see an awful lot of Biden signs up there. Signs are split pretty evenly between him and Trump.
If you never voted, now is the time to start by voting Trump out. He cares about no one but himself.
Nope, I never supported Trump. I wrote in Romney
The Politicized AG Barr, should go to jail, as well as the IMPEACHED Lying Trump. I think chubby Barr, would look good behind Bars. #CORRUPTION
Someone explain that to Trump.
I hope they come out with a vaccine for the Trump Virus shortly.
The #RNC is weird: Delegates are “expected” to attend but there will be exceptions if sick/quarantine. Still in Charlotte Arena...but essentially NO press (Only AP/Reuter’s and AON attending). Most speeches cancelled but some will go on.   So this is 2,000 in mini #Trump party.
Just heard that Joe Biden will not accept the nomination in Milwaukee and it sounds like Donald Trump won't accept the nomination in Charlotte and/or Jacksonville. Hot take: in 2024, one of the parties will just hold their convention in front of a green screen
Nobody I know, wants to vote for a lying, IMPEACHED snake. Like the Imbecile spreading lies on top of lies. Fox Should be taken to court for supporting the lies. People are dying because of Trump and his cult. #TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks
Trump spreading bullshit again, Kids are not immune from the virus, and certainly the teachers and staff are not. He also said the explosion in Beruit was an attack, again he lies, reporters say other countries look to us for guidance, they shouldn't with Liar in Chief. 🌊🌊🌊
Might the question be, HOW will Bill Barr help Trump win the election?
He’s living in a Trump Bubble
Trump basically left it to individual states to create their own safety rules, basically being a republican and providing less government over sight, he did ask doctors and crate guidelines but ultimately it was up to the states themselves and they failed their duty to the people
Toss up, who is the stupidest asshole, Death Santis or Snake King Trump.
Trump must really be messing with their money ... 🤨
Wait, I thought he said that he has been tested regularly? Trump is the one that constantly lies?

has officially HAD IT with Trump’s bullshit! This segment is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is what Democrats do all the time. They can’t admit they failed and they blame it on trump! Hillary being so corrupt should disqualify her on judgment. She must be mentally ill.
Any question remotely related to black people, Trump hears a criticism (unconscious guilt) and immediately goes into his defense talking point (lie) that "nobody's done more for African Americans" than him.
Trump pledges fealty to Fox host on UFOs: ‘I’ll do whatever you ask me to do — including total transparency’  Unbelievable!!!!
Many MANY of us are scared to death over Trump. The only thing scarier is Biden. Will there ever be another worthy candidate? No one out there is any good at all. No one!
You’re comparing winning millions of dollars... to a voting for a guy who will neither put millions in your pocket or give a shit about you. Regardless if it’s Biden or Trump. Terrible tweet/comparison.
Only in FLA so that Trump can mail his ballot in. Nuts 🙄
A text book example of how to interview the current president. Hope other anchors take note of this.
When, and it will happen, Biden debates Trump and he comes off as competent, coherent, and prepared (and yes, occasionally tongue-tied) a bunch of the Trump supporters who have never actually heard Joe speak are going to be asking themselves why they were pushing for more debates
to whoever made the “dracut is trump country” ... i didn’t know dracut was its own country
It's good to see that the Trump spokestooges are getting better looking.
People are individuals. Many good people love guns and small government or just tolerate Trump because they don’t like Dems.   Many Dems who support woke candidates with policies that empower the poor, are still hateful, greedy, self-centered people who mostly just want accolades
One of my aunts loves Trump too. With her you might be right. She’s always been kinda mean and hateful even though she loves me.  I know some real jerks who are liberal too. Egotistical, morally self-righteous. Some value ambition and attention over charity and understanding.
My neighbor loves Trump. He also loves his kid and helping me out, whether it’s helping push my wife’s car outta the snow or texting me when I leave the garage door open.   No one was more welcoming when my Puerto Rican family moved into our very white neighborhood.
I’m sick and tired of this idea that we have to pick a side. My sister likes Trump and her AR-15. She’s gonna teach my daughter to shoot it.  Nothing you or the internet or Trump or Biden ever tells me will overcome my 42 years of living and seeing how good and kind she is.
If you say police are bad, how are you at all different than Trump when he calls journalists and his critics ‘enemies of the people?’  If all Trump supporters lack character and patriotism, how are you different than Trump when he says liberals want to destroy America?
If you stereotype and lump all Trump supporters together, how are you better than Trump?  How do you plan to reach them and change their minds with group hate and dismissal?  How are you better than those who rant about all “the libs” or claim all progressives are socialists?

I’m gonna say it! I think that the democrats have a lot to do with why we are seeing so many cases now. Things were just starting to get better and then we see so many cases more. They need our country in chaos and afraid. They will do whatever it takes to defeat Trump!
I am pro-America. Love my country to death. But I am Anti-Trump  ❤️🇺🇸❤️ #AmericaOrTrump #USA #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Most of those deaths were because democrat run states and cities failed their citizens! Those same states reminded us all that they would not let federal government take over decision making. Now they want to blame trump!? That is plane and simple stupid. Do you agree?
In any of those questions Trump answered, was he coherent?
It only makes sense that Barack Obama is a Leo and Donald Trump is a Gemini
He's part of the Trump cult!

What Trump said was bad but, but, but . . .  What about this totally unrelated thing that's also bad that some non-descript people did?
Biden has interviews, not as many as Trump, but he's not POTUS.   But you probably rely on the doctored videos and chatter about his senility. That's fake news.   I encourage you to watch Biden for a complete conversation. He may not be a smooth speaker but he's coherent. Really.
Disappointing not being able to discern between a Racist and a Fascist.  I agree Trump is a Fascist and a Racist. And Joe Biden....I don't believe to be Racist..that's good.  But excuse me, make no mistake when it comes to economics.....He is a Fascist.  Economics 101   🐂 or 🐻
Who watches this and thinks Trump comes off well?  Who?
Donald Trump is a huge embarrassment, I don’t know how anyone can continue to literally fly his flag this point but they do. Oh they do.
Kudos to  for being patient, persistent and laser focused on getting Trump to answer the question asked and to clarify/justify his statements.  Every journalist, please push back on Trump's lies/delusions. Dont accept his bullshit.
The fact that shut your mouth is trending to trump is insane. Democrats have a monopoly on social media. Republicans need to get in or get out. It’s the new future.

I share the concerns of Trump and others on mass, never-before-tried-on-this-scale #MailInVoting.  But it will likely be a reality.  The #GOP should have some people fighting against it in court, where and when they can, but they should have many many more others
Trump needs to continue to show that leadership on the virus through November in order to win re-election, no matter how well the economy improves, or how much the civil unrest/ violence subsides, if it does.
I give credit to Trump and the campaign for finally accepting that the #Corinavirus is the main issue today , whether they like it or not, and dealing with it appropriately.  I share their frustration that other things such as the economy and security aren’t number one, and I...

First and foremost.. Obama and his administration 2nd antifa and Black life’s matter for spreading the race bait 3rd the mayor of the city for allowing the riots 4th the governor for not bringing in the national guard 5th Trump for not bringing in 5x the troops and crushing them
#WomenAgainstTrump It blows my mind that any woman would support Trump. My mother is in the Trump cult and she can't explain to me what she thinks he's done for women, other than degrading them and treating them like they are a lesser being.
The Treasury is just a cut out to launder cut before it goes into Trump pockets.
Attorney General Eric Holder said, if Trump doesn't leave the White House on January 20th, he is stripped of power and at that point is considered trespassing, and can be escorted from the White House. #VoteThemAllOut
You mean kinda like this? Sure he's not gonna full stop it but he's an idiot of he thinks calling for less testing is a good idea (among all the other reasons he's an idiot).
Me too. People are hurting, but they are going to build a building, that helps Trump. Where are our leaders?  Stop the madness!
Why is the media, giving Trump a pass?
Speak about Trump's prolife policies among others.

The most damning inside portrait of the Trump administration yet  #SmartNews
I watched the devils advocate with #KeanuReeves and they filmed this one scene at trump tower. Filled with the richest and the worst NYC had to offer. He was mentioned in the film in the party scene where  character was left alone. Made me think about the trump fam
Here I was hoping for a 6'6" Behemoth weighing in at around 375 who answers to the name of Tiny. Did I mention Tiny is Gay and he likes it rough. Who knows maybe Tiny is Trump's little Suzie Who, and he can reach down into the Grinch's heart and cause it to grow 3 sizes in a day.
He is not 100% at fault of course but if you ignore common logical fallacies like whataboutism and try to direct the convo elsewhere it really does nothing. Trump was a variable in this equation and a big one.  If he was a strong supporter of science we'd be in a better position.
everyone you know is a criminal
2016. Your right Trump has no chance. Please keep saying it.
Actually you're the one who has offered nothing of substance.   Not surprisingly, just like your hero Trump, you project your own shortcomings on others.
Rs have gotten less than 45% of the national vote for President 0 times since 2000. The two lowest showings? McCain in 2008 (45.7%) and Trump 2016 (46.1%.)

Microsoft, you'll tell us if Trump asks for a favor though, right? Like to get his beak wet in the deal.
Who knows millions???? 1?? No one knows because engaging in useless whataboutism doesn't do anything but distract from the fact that Trump fumbled the pandemic response and continues to mishandle it day in and day out.

A Navy Captain who was part of the intelligence community at the time in 2016 was made aware the Trump Tower, hq for the Trump campaign, was being bugged by the current administration.  Forgive me for not remembering his name. This proceeded the exodus that was in the news.
This week: Trump's election threat, bad GDP report, stimulus delay, higher death rate, Lewis funeral, and some amazing video editing.
No wonder he got the Trump endorsement. He's got the sketchy business activity down pat.
These Democrats have created more hardship for the American people than we could imagine. I’m voting for Donald Trump
Democrats could care less about the constitution! They want what they want. Ever notice that all the thing they say trump is corrupt over ... it is them actually doing it!
Trump is definitely doing this for security reasons, personal not national. #sarahcooper
Who is spreading this fake news??? Until you reveal who exactly this source of "fake news" is and call out this specific dual-citizenship group with no loyalty to the US, you will NOT be getting my vote again President Trump.
Keep in mind, trump is lying when he says 99%+ cases are harmless. Theyre not. The Death Rate is 10 times higher than the Flu. COVID-19 attacks the immune system in ways we still dont understand. Kids have B Cells that delay the onset of the virus, they are not immune.  Wake Up
The Earth is 4.5 billion years old. The Earth is round. The Earth is dying. Trump is killing it.
A lot of asserting going on in the White House! What're your impressions on this story?  #trump #tiktok #dataprivacy
One thing I have learned about Nancy is she will risk everything, even lie to make trump look bad!
And Trump is the one who would lie in a debate? Biden is about as dishonest as they come
I don’t want ‘debates’. Not because I worry about Biden, but because I don’t think they’re valuable, and it’s just more airtime for Trump.
I don’t know about the other families but the Richards family asked that he not get the death penalty. Those who might rightly criticize Trump for going for it again need to acknowledge that Eric Holder approved the prosecution going for the death penalty.
She said that the liberals have released criminals into our society and Trump should send in law enforcement to eradicate them..  I took a course in liberal BS jibberish..😉🤣🤣🤣
This year FALL has two meanings to me. First it brings vibrant colors in the tree foliage, the White Mountains are blanketed in Reds, yellows, and bright orange. That's fall in NH, Secondly, it will be the FALL of Trump and his greedy, corrupt, self serving GOP. #VoteThemAllOut

So Senate control may well come down to #MEsen. There's only been 2 public polls taken of that race, and in those, Gideon holds a 45% to 40.5% lead on Collins on average. Given that Biden is gonna win Maine decisively and that Collins isn't clearing Trump's share of support...

I believe it was  who said that Obama had left a loaded gun in the Oval Office for Donald Trump. It’s true. These abuses of power only compound. Yet one more thing libertarians have been futilely trying to warn everyone about for decades now.
Get em Trump!
Why hadn't that occurred to me - of course and the Trump family will get there cut. The vaccine almost certainly will not be safe and effective - but that won't be proven until after the election.
Worse part is the political media will play along.  But Dem messaging should be branding every Republican a member of the Bush/Trump/McConnell party.
PRESIDENT ASKED SHOCKING QUESTION: Trump EXPLOSIVE Press Conference from...  via   censored by fox
Nope. The VP pick is the one move Biden can make that will dominate the news cycle   Why play his Ace now?  Only political junkies care about the VP drama.  60% of public only cares about Covid and the Economy. I wouldn’t even do it until Labor Day unless Trump closes within 6%
#VoteOutRacism everybody knows trump is a racist. He has proved it over and over.
I am  getting tweets from Biden people attacking Trump for doing this. I hope they keep attacking him like this as it is the only way the word will get out to all the media.
Keep talking , you are making Trump look good. Most of your followers would not know about the swamp with out you demonstrating it . Most of your followers are watching CNN and they are not silly enough to bring it up.
I love seeing this set of words. They are great words. The best words. My new favorite talk shit about Trump words lol. And I'm being serious, not sarcastic. Honestly.
They have a sweaty scared guy with a big red button to hit b4 trump says something stupid.  His life sucks.
People that do not see what’s going on are either stupid or trump supporters.. oh wait....

At least it’s consistent. The last Trump “tax cut” didn’t do shit for me either.

Give me 1 right that the Republican party took away. The Republicans were the ones that recognized black people's civil rights. The Democrats voted almost unanimously against the Civil rights act. Democrat politicians care about your vote. Not you.
As a country we have a lot of work to do.  The trump virus is the least of it. We need to come back together. Russia is pushing for one candidate and China the other?  We are AMERICANS first and foremost. All of us They do not get a say in our country.
Fake news Dumpy Trump!!!
They  voted for Trump
Oh Please take TRUMP with you
I know my history. Trump is making excuses. He’s the President and he doesn’t make his crap in the USA. He’s a fraud.
Finally,  a message from the Trump campaign I agree with
Folks, even if we do find a successful vaccine before November 3rd (and I pray we do), remember Donald Trump had nothing to do with it. #ProjectLincoln  #donwinslow #JoeBiden
Hey Eagle, you should do your research.  That wasn’t trump.  The departments in charge of that were put in place by Obama.  What else you got?
Imagine all we will find out about all the graft and stealing the trump family has done that we will find out about after they leave.  How many people will write books?

Everyone knows now who Putin has in his Back Pocket I think Trump like Back pockets

No  if they didn't have their shit together no extra debates maybe Trump should get people that know what they are doing to run it If I were Trump thank god im not I would fire everyone that screwed this up
How can there not be a similar argument for whether Trump is all there or not? Given that they both might be in mental decline -- maybe -- there's also the wealth of evidence of Trump's corruption where there is none for Biden. How does that not tip the scales in favor of Biden?
I know! Trump should be in prison, but it’s people like you who keep protecting him! Didn’t you learn a lesson when you protected the molester? Do you ever learn?

You are a funny trump parrot. Do you mind the fact that trump does not care for you? Unless it makes money for him he does not give a shit. He is president not to fix America, but to make himself and his friends richer.  If you are to blind to see that I feel bad for you.
Lol no I have a mind of my own, can read. I don't need some shadowy one letter group to spoon feed me lies and propaganda.  I knew trump was a useless asshole long before he became president, and have witnessed the death and destruction he has brought to the country.

No one can prove that Trump is racist without including their subjective interpretation of what they think he meant.
I'll really be glad when its all over am so sick of turning tv on and that's all you hear is negative am older so I have seen many things  but never anything like Trump he is just so nasty and Dangerous to the country
I'm not accusing anyone of anything. You're all just proving my point nicely. Trump's "racism" turns on subjective interpretation of what he says. Biden's racism is objectively racist.
Or if Trump said that poor kids were just as smart and talented as white kids
Trump is President now. He should set an example and make his stuff in America. Stop blaming everyone else.
Oh I see only you can Vote for who you want , but I don't only for who you think I should , I get it your a real Trump supporter but just hiding like in 2016  I get it now
No but I don't know if I could vote for him if he takes Stacy Abrams she has as big of an Ego as Trump
Well, if Mr Trump gets away with being there a dozen times, and it was ok to “share” maralago employees with Epstein at orgy island why isn’t he getting coverage!?   He’s the expert on cheating! Pig.
Bullwinkle Moose would be better than Trump!
And you're right. Maybe it wasn't a good idea for anyone to be marching with those people or be any way involved. I'm just saying that not EVERY person there was a supremacist. Some just didn't want the statute down. But either way Trump condemned the supremacists.
if I see the words "falsely said" one more time from the I Hate trump media I will run to my tweeter page and call them out just like you ,,,,,It can not be a kawinkidink.
Wrong. Trump loves everyone equally unlike Joe the racist.
Let me be clear.  If you are a Republican, then act like one and stand true to your principles, even if I disagree with them.  If you are a Re-TRUMP-plican, you are part of the problem and need to be voted out because you are spinless and have abandoned the beliefs of the party
Hey what if I told you that neither Biden nor Trump actually take their religious beliefs all that seriously, and saying that Catholics *must* vote for one or the other is a ridiculous false dichotomy
Another piece of fake news to disrespect our President! Put some celebrities in it because they know everything right?You people are as brainwashed as Biden! Go ahead and vote for someone that can't even put a sentence together unless someone orchestrates it for him!  Vote Trump!
Sure as long as you agree that voting and supporting Trump is the biggest mistake you ever made in your life.
If Trump could get Biden to say some thing nice about religion , God or rebuke the liberals in the media who are anti religion , then it would be a public service.
Well she is 80. Trump/Biden shouldn’t be running this country either in their mid 70’s but I digress.
Trump is racist. But as VP....you can’t say that. Sounds like Biden has moved on from her and I hope that’s true.
I knew they were going to do this; act like they were all acting in good faith only to wait until the last minute, throw up their hands and blame the democrats for not bending to their will so Trump can swoop in and look like he's saving the country with his fake executive order
Please Mr Trump take action today to help us!! I look for work everyday.
What’s your thoughts on protesters/rioters? Worse than a Trump rally!!!!!
My point is that when Trump says very fine people you have to assume that he is talking about white supremacists. You have to  subjectively assign the most racist meaning to it. You don't have to assume anything with biden's racism.
Trump signed an executive order to shut down TikTok. Because you know that is so much more important that the close to 160K deaths since March. Millennials and GenZ have Trumped Trump when it comes to the Social Media Game
What does this even mean,,., let’s pay attention to business, 1.8 million jobs added,  unemployment down to 10.?%..,  Cuomo is bleeding out and pleading for the rich to come back TRUMP 2020
So basically, the NRA is run just like the Trump campaign.
See that's this thing. To find racism in what Trump says you have to ignore entire parts of what he says. In your example you ignore the part where he says "not white supremacists, though. They should be totally condemned." He said it in the same sentence lol
Trump never said that poor kids are just as smart and talented as white kids. See Trump's supposed "racism" is subjective, determined by people who either hate him or look for racism in everything. Biden's racism is objective, overt racism.
Kind of does for me. What it does **NOT** mean is never conservative. As long as the GOP remains Trumpy, even after Trump himself is gone, I will be never GOP.

President Trump won’t give them money now democrats are going after everyone 👎😀🇺🇸
Ok, my personal opinion is if the people closest to the press don't trust his ability to make an informed decision then there's a problem.  I don't like any president so it's not just my dislike of trump.
Ohhh, so Trump is showing off his Thai language skills. Interesting.
And before you think it because I hate trump, I do, but that's not it. I would feel the same for any president, especially one as old and questionable as trump or Biden. No pres should have unchecked power.
Obama whispered to Moscow stooge that he would help him "after the election" and made fun of Romney for pointing out Russia was a danger. When he said Trump would never win the nomination at the Press show, the one 2 yrs later they called Trumps female press sec a fat ass ,
I can understand that if they felt he was unfit to be able to handle a military option that they should have talked with the VP and Congress about pulling trump out by way of the 25th.
Do you want $30 billion above and beyond what the states are going to be allocated for this Covid because you defunded the police, .. letthd riots run amuck ...and at the s axme time bashed  Trump every chance you got,.. good luck with that  NYC is a disaster
We have to work together and fins middle ground if we are going to defeat Donald Trump.  is doing a great job in doing so
The fact that the American people + trump want the 600 extended. The senate would be idiots not to pass it
I’m not a Republican but let me tell you, I feel bad for them considering that Trump supporters are giving Republicans a horrible rep. I don’t agree with Republican policies but I can atleast find common ground and be civil with true republicans. I cant find ground with Trumpies.
There’s a difference between true republicans and trump supporters.     are true Republicans who place their country over party. Trump supporters are not Republicans, they are cult members. Trump supporters have  defamed the GOP
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnel, corporate greed, the current state of my country, and my mother: these are going to be the reasons I lose it❤️

Trump is a hoax #TrumpsFakeChristianity
What are news outlets(not Fox) going to report on when Covid changes course and Trump vacates? What did everyone used to talk about, I forgot.
He won’t let criminals out of prison, kill us with a virus, send well wishes to child rapists and spend our money on his hotels and golf courses during the worst recession trump created.
Of course Trump is a  #Biblicalidiot My parents were agnostic and I was raised with more Christian values than he has.

Your comment got me thinking. Did it matter who the GOP picked in the 2016 Primary? Those "in the know" thought Trump was the worst candidate (and they were right). But the alternatives: a woman (for party of white men? No), Bush again? No. Kasich (considered a RINO now) amaz...
Historian who has accurately called every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump in 2020 race
Grew up with that type, recognize!  Trump is a #FakeChristian
How did Trump suppress the black vote?  And he called for the death penalty when he thought they were guilty, but I'll admit is was dumb for him to double down on thinking they were guilty later on after they clearly weren't.
I also think that the media cherry picks and takes things out of context to further their position that Trump is a racist.
Nobody says your not going to believe this anymore when it comes to trump. Pretty sure that was the last one.
Free America from trump
CNN is propoganda. All news outlets are propoganda.  There is a comparison. Trump has never said anything overtly racist. Biden has on many occasions said openly racist things.    Either way. Your comment said Biden isn't racist, but you just admitted he was.
I am more confident that trump will send love letters to Maxwell. How’s Nestor?
NH Trump 2020!
You're telling me, in a year that ANY Democrat can beat Donald Trump, Joe Biden is the man?? The best?? 👌
I'll not lecturing. I'm just trying to help you shake those delusions. If you believe Trump is racist but Biden isn't, youre clearly delusional.
As did Trump's business practice. How many patents does your family have in China?

Why are they clapping?  Not only is Trump an idiot but he has used that joke before.  I swear he thinks he is a brilliant stand up comedian.
Agree it’s an outlier just not a huge one. 40% is what McConnell’s Democratic rivals traditionally get. Also nationally undecideds are breaking towards Biden but in a deep red state undecideds will break towards Trump. They disagree with Trump but are. primed to hate liberals
Give me one thing... Just one thing.. That Trump has done to hurt black Americans.
Um. Trump lost in NH (and will again).  Yes, and we use the money to regularly crush cocky out of state repub operatives' dreams.   Btw, GOP data is owned by a national private corp, our data is owned by NHDP. Their data has about 20% of what our data has.   #nhpolitics
All good old Al and John needed was the votes.  Money or how Trump earned it didn't get me to vote for him.  I voted for Trump, because Hillary was the alternative. You know, the one in #pizzagte or #PedoIsland.  Drinks #adrenachrome, with the head bobing.
This is not just Trump v. Biden. This is Trump v. united    Biden has twice as many gen election wins than Trump. Obama/Biden ticket carried NH twice, Trump lost. (If you include FITN both Trump &amp; Biden are tied)   won 6 of last 7 (86%) prez races.   #nhpolitics

I tell my friends all the time Trump isn't going to make it till Nov election he is going to resign  and have Pence Pardon him and His whole family that's why Rudy has been around to make that deal I bet its been talked about for a long time Trump can't take chance Biden beats
They didn't go after Clinton Foundation because Bill or Hillary didn't make everyone hate them like Trump Judges CIA  AG's Black  everyone so alot have big scores to settle with him and Clintons know to many secrets about everyone
Absolute bop! Still hate Trump though😂
It's almost like the NY AG is working with the Trump campaign. This is galactically stupid timing
That's fantasy. Finch is correct, IMO. This plays right into the #2A crowd's hands. I'm not going to bite cuz I don't think Trump should remain anywhere near the Oval, but the vast majority will have no problem siding up with him to fight this. This is ridiculously stupid timing
Having to deal with actual isolation bc of high risk family members along with worrying about the future of my country due to Trump, and worry about college admissions has my mental health at an all time low. I haven’t left my house in 5 months, I’m stressing over college prep...
Absolutely.  It is simply nuts and way out of hand.  I am so angry with the democratic leadership.  They only want this violence to continue b/ they somehow think it will help Biden get into office.  WRONG!!  I am an independent who loves Trump!
It's wild how many people on this thread are asking what our alternative is. Get involved in your state legislative races. Make sure you vote in (Progressive) people that won't cow-tow to biden OR trump. Veto-proof majorities in both houses, the exec is far less consequential.
Wow turns out Twitter is backing trump. I totally got spanked for my comments on chumps tweets.
Damn he should have waited till after meeting with Trump
Don't you ever feel embarrassed to tweet such nonsense? Trump NH ground game was an epic fail in 2018 and will be in 2020. The    ground game is legendary. The    team is already ahead of you by two laps without spreading COVID too. #nhpolitics

They are demonstration life after Trump. All the right is asking for is 4 more years of fair and competent running of the country before they take over which is inevitable anyway.
You are awakening a sleeping giant. Touching what means most to Americans. Thank you for re-electing Donald Trump.
What if it’s true Lincoln stopped plantations from enslaving blacks because they created a system to enslave all people with money &amp; taxes I said from the start this goes back before Trump or Obama It’s like me having a new car after working all my life &amp;

A magnificent Titanic-like luxury liner turned upside down in an horrific catastrophe? Wasn't the Poseidon Adventure a prophecy of the Trump Era?
It's one thing that Trump's intentional wrecking of postal deliveries delays medications, but once people discover their checks are late, Donald's gonna really piss some people off
From Day One of the Trump Administration the Republicans have acted as the Russian Counter-American Advancement Party w/Donald as their willingly eager Butt-Boy in Chief.  "Let's meet in secret, Valdemir, I've got something special to show you. Bring your camera."
I can't believe they think they  can get away with that shit not with CNN and Msnbc and all the other real news people I left Fox out not bought and paid for by Trump
Head on a swivel is the only way to watch this Administration and its enablers.  and Ukraine could be a significant source of election interference. Early in this presidency, Trump ID’d Johnson as a most useful tool. #nhpolitics
#LincolnVoter  Born and raised republican. Now kind of disenfranchised with both parties but I'm going to just punch the blue ticket this year. Even the "good" Republicans supported trump so I can't trust them.
He is a prime example of what drinking can do to your brain Donald Trump should play the commercial with the egg frying in the pan Show the egg this is Trump Then crack it in the pan this is Biden LOL 👎😀🇺🇸
Funny I just checked the NYT best sellers list, the biggest selling book, number 1best seller, is a book by someone called Mary Trump Hummm, is she related to you Donny?
It is very democrat Trump needs to counter with a pick of his own It’s time for the first black VP Candace Owens not half black like Harris Let’s get it on ❤️👍😀🇺🇸
NH Primary Source:   told  interviewer he canceled July 11 Portsmouth rally due to #COVID19 (not a tropical storm) #nhpolitics #WMUR
President Trump needs to replace Michael Pence because make him a director or an ambassador The president can’t have him debating a black woman because democrats will make it look like a race war He need to replace him with Candace Owens She will tear Kamala Harris apart ❤️👍😀🇺🇸
No, not a one. They all defected to democrat when it became the party of trump.
LET’S THINK LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP Do we create a society of intelligent human beings that can MOTIVATE SOCIETY TO INVENT better energy sources
In this day and age, what made the Trump campaign think they would get away with doctoring three images?!
I live in NH and I guarantee he takes NH. In PA Republicans have gained 165,000 new voters to only 30,000 for Democrats. Trump will 100% win again.
Trump wouldn't stand a chance if you had that
The thing is, he isn’t new to his job. This never happened in almost 40yrs serving under a number of administrations- Dem &amp; Rep. Whats the difference...Trump.
"Trump is not a conservative." Truer words never spoken. This is a stone cold fact.
Shhhh let them keep lowering expectations. Then a well rested, well prepared Biden shied up on TV to depart Trump.
“People are dying, it is what it is”-trump
These images are as doctored as can be lmao nice try trump 😂😂😂😂😂😂 at least the VIDEOS we have of  are REAL HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report   #dirtytricks are showing #desperation #TrumpIsLosing
Every time  compares himself to Abraham Lincoln and his accomplishments, I literally want to puke! Trump is no where near Lincoln! No one should ever mention Trumps name when talking about Lincoln! #history
It's so true. Many of them don't even know or care about policy. Theyre fine with destroying the country just to see Trump lose
If you think trump is such a liar then why listen to him? Go get your news from Sputnik or TASS
Governor fought mayors on masks and luckily trump is the president of only 1 state now?
Hay tony, he wasn't a one term president like TRAITOR trump
Or Trump's pushing of a disproven drug will help bring him down
Trump releases his tax returns or NO DEBATE! Sounds fair to me, Joe released his!
Trump said the explosion in Lebanon was caused by a bomb and was a terrorist attack.   Remember when you could take things said by the President at face value?  Because right now the one thing I think when I hear the president* say something I have to wait for confirmation still.
We the people will be in jeopardy if trump continues to talk. He is a danger to the us. Please remove him
What better way to get people to turn the TV off than beginning your ad with “Endorsed By President Trump!”   🔌 📺 #NHpolitics #NH01
Pandemic models failed to anticipate the chaos in the US.  Two decades of pandemic war games failed to account for Donald Trump
Nope, I never supported Trump. I wrote in Romney
Big news! Trump is still letting Putin pay to hunt US troops.
So, to ssummarize Donald Trump’s massive rally in Portsmouth... #nhpolitics #trumpislosing
100%  drives me absolutely bonkers when with all the horrific things one could slap Trump with, folks start dropping fat jokes  "lol Trump is a fatty"  yeah and so am I, what's your point
The #RNC is weird: Delegates are “expected” to attend but there will be exceptions if sick/quarantine. Still in Charlotte Arena...but essentially NO press (Only AP/Reuter’s and AON attending). Most speeches cancelled but some will go on.   So this is 2,000 in mini #Trump party.
If Biden get's 90 percent of the vote on election day , will dems admit that is impossible therefore we need a do over or demand Trump leave office anyway ?
Speaking of Trump Derangement....
Has Trump ever said anything that we could not predict he would say the opposite eventually? I am serious ANYTHING?
Trump isn’t “breaking tradition”; he’s breaking the law.
There must be 40,000 trump fans there! Wait...
Everything Trump says is a LIE
He’s living in a Trump Bubble
I feel like Vader, coming in behind trump as he tries to destroy America.   "The stupid is strong with this one."
Trumps blabs his hunches like the guy at the local barber shop. Only when it's the POTUS it's either wildly reckless or howlingly stupid, and in Trump's case, both.
Trump will attack anyone who crosses him.  He is a child.
Ohh no!  What are we going to do?  We surely cannot vote for Trump!  And now we cannot vote for Biden!    ohh well, screw it!  BIDEN 2020
This man is incapable of tying his own shoes but he’s on track to become the president because Trump doesn’t kiss the media’s ass- so they have been non-stop crazy on him for four years. #Trump2020
There's no "they" controlling Trump. Unlike a lot of other politicians, where there are true handler's.  I'll understand if you don't see the good in that, but it's hard to argue that he has people controlling or restricting him. Like it or not, many are drawn to that.🇺🇸
Not a fan of your antics but congratulations. Now don’t fuck up the work to get rid of trump.

I will add this to the trump poll for his supporters.
Well every time trump says China virus instead of #TrumpVirus I donate so he should have plenty of money.
Is Biden setting up Trump with help from the press for an aggressive debate that will make him look foolish . Is Biden faking dementia and will be bragging about it after the election along with how he stole this state or that the way they did when Kennedy won in the 60's
Trump will win Nov 3rd Bach!! Get ready to bitch another 4 years.
Okay I’m confused on some of the “words” you use in that PA. Firstly it certainty is an opinion that trump is racist, just like you think it’s okay to through around a swatstika.
Maybe ur confused her about genocide and fascism let me help. Trump isn’t a fascist he’s a conservative republican, I study law and politics btw. Also genocide is murder of a specific race or culture. trump didn’t cause COVID, even if he did that’s not genocide.
First off here’s what ur forgetting. Adolf hitler killed 20 million innocent people because of their race. Donald Trump didn’t get elected because he was racist, most of those bullets for trump are opinionated. Hitler isn’t even close to trump.
What in gods name other than this do they have in common? When did trump commit mass genocide? When did he convert to fascism or started a war over the economy. U ppl don’t know how good u have it. Grow up
🚨🚨 NEW  polling shows  neck and neck with  trailing by only 3 points (43-46), with Biden leading Trump 48-44 in #AZ06.  5 days ago Schweikert was found guilty of 11(!) ethics violations. Let's kick him out of office.

Media blamed it on it's scape goat in the middle east so hopefully now that Trump thinks it was a boom the media will call him a dope like they always do.

You're clearly a Trump hater, dude.  You just can't stand the fact that he's exposing the far-left Democrats like Biden.
I am starting to think maybe Trump is not a good person to run a country. If I am still alive tomorrow I will think that one through.
When Trump loses on November 3rd the world will tell him #ItIsWhatItIs
Strange.. no mention of Trump sending well wishes to the child rapists? Twice.  Every person who supports and defends  these pigs need to be in prison.
Donald Trump ignores history, he is ignorant of what it teaches. It is lost on him, he is mentally too far gone.
I've always wondered how Hitler turned a whole country like that, when suddenly I have a front row seat to much the same thing.  Luckily I don't think trump is smart enough to carry this through, our system is different enough ( I hope) .
I thought Trump would pick a Russian! 🧐
We must shatter voter turnout records to rid ourselves of this toxic person in the White House.  Anyone who hitches their wagon to Trump must also be defeated.
Traitor trump is not responsible for the trump virus, but he is responsible for it getting far worse in this country than it had to be.  "It is what it is", is not a plan or strategy

It can not be a corwinkiedink that swan's questioning style copied that of congress going after the AG, this is probably the style they will use against Trump during the debate while Biden stands there and laughs .
Sometimes I forget how strongly my boss and all his regulars support trump and I make a comment about the current climate of our country and wooooo lemme tell ya. That never goes over well😅
This tweet was not meant for you...it’s for normal people that understand that a system that makes us choose between Trump and Biden is broken. If you don’t understand why Biden is ultimately no better than Trump, it’s because you’re not questioning enough. Have a nice day.
Donald J. Trump.
How is this real? What a terrible person Trump is
Not only must Trump be defeated in November, we need to do it on an EPIC scale. A total, complete repudiation of his legacy of death, economic collapse and corruption.

Liz, there will be no reason for Biden to debate Trump. The media w/protect him. Mail in voting will start before debates. I hate to say this but Dems are winning at every step. Blaming Trump for Covid 19, the poor economy, due t shutdowns. Trumps people suck. He's a one man band

Hate to be morbid, but I think in this case many never-Trump GOPers (like me) view the VP as the possible president some time before 2024....so the choice is a bit more important this time.
The Trump Administration’s decision to suspend the 2020 Census count a month early so that Trump can reapportion congressional seats in Republicans’ favor while he is still in office is an illegal power grab. Get counted today at
works both ways...John would probably not want the racist in chief at his funeral and Trump is a petty racist and had no desire to attend...it would not play well with his base (which is all he cares about)

If Trump did lie in a debate, Biden probably couldn't correct him anyway. You need to remember real facts and truth to confront the opposite. You can't confront an untruth by just saying it is untruth. And, remember Joe said, “We choose truth over facts.” Truth without facts? OK

Trump controlling the narrative. If we don’t test, we won’t have positive cases. If we fudge the statistics, we make things look better than they are.
He said he might drag it through the courts for years. Donald Trump is the biggest POS that has walked this Earth since George Wallace
Reality Trump Just Tried To Upstage John Lewis's Funeral As Obama Speaks
If you 20m listen to my discussion this morning on WKBK we discuss Sununu's election possibilites, #Feltes v #Volinsky in the Dem Primary and "the  pledge" and Biden v Trump it may be a roadmap 4 the election #nhpolitics
Whatever else happens after he leaves office, Trump has permanently warped political standards in this country and reduced politics to meeting the absolute minimum threshold of "not constantly embarassing" (which of course Biden barely clears)
Pretty incredible how much Trump has poisoned the political discourse in this country and lowered everyone's standard for what counts as leadership that this tweet isn't being relentlessly mocked for the absurd pandering that it represents
The Lord willing I will indeed be voting for Donald J. Trump on Tuesday, November 3, 2020! Regardless of what the haters say. They don't believe in democracy!
Yes, it is beat Trump at any cost. Unfortunately, the Never Trumpers are the same. And, we all will pay the price, but they don't seem to care. When will the American citizens come first?
Good - now do Trump

ICYMI: Black Man Shot 'Execution Style' In 'Broad Daylight' After Giving Interview About Supporting Trump
There are definitely other situations in which it makes sense to call Trump a murderer, but in this particular case he had consent from his victim, which I think matters.
While Trump certainly bears some responsibility for Cain's death here, that responsibility is akin to a doctor assisting in a physician-assisted suicide, and since I would not call such a doctor a murderer, I am reluctant to apply the term to Trump in this case.
Looks like Trump's propagandists are taking over at VOA:
They won’t be able to push back the elections. That’s an unheard of precedent. We went through a Civil War and 2 World Wars without doing so. Were it to be forced it would certainly be a negative mark on Trump.
Thousands of people are buried there. They lost their lives in the two world wars. Some fought for the Kaiser, others for the Nazi regime. There were no Nazis around in WWI and Hitler and his criminals got in the last free election 33% of the vote. He got less than Trump.
In June, Trump decided to hold a rally in Tulsa. Some Republicans attended out of a sense of defiance, including Cain, who was photographed—like most  without a mask. Nine days later, he was hospitalized with COVID-19. Today, he died at a hospital
Or Trump orders Postal Service, which his crony now controls, to stop delivering mail because of some irregularity; lawsuits filed to order mail to be delivered; appeals; this is far from over......
Most people are so obsessed with Trump now that political beliefs don't matter.
Nobody deserves it. They shouldn't be blaming him, his blood is on Trump's hands.
On NH call, Trump is saying stuff about health care.   TL;DR: HE WANTS TO REPEAL THE ACA which would: - Kick 105,000 Granite Staters off plans - Kick 57,000 on Medicaid Expansion off their plan - End protections for 572,000 Granite Staters with pre-existing conditions #nhpolitics
On NH call, Trump going on about China.  If you want to know about the real impact of Trump's chaotic China policy, read this piece from 3 ambassadors who live in the Granite State:  TRUMP GOT PLAYED BY CHINA; GRANITE STATERS PAY THE PRICE    #nhpolitics
For someone whose only qualification for Congress seems to be that he was a close adviser to President Trump, weird that Trump got  name wrong on this N.H. call.  (Maybe Trump will get it right on the N.J. call?)  #nhpolitics
Trump on N.H. call, Governor Sununu is a "fantastic guy, fantastic governor."  Fact check: Not the case at all. Sununu has screwed over Granite Staters to help special interests every chance he's had.   But I love that friendship for the two of you!  #nhpolitics
Trump says on N.H. call that Democrats "hate our country."  Fact check: Not true AT ALL. We hate what you have done to our country. 150,000 Americans dead. Worst GDP quarter in nation's history.  #nhpolitics

Trump spoke about plasma, it's supposedly related. Definitely a Covid play though.
Trump issued a tweet today threatening to delay the election? Why? Cause he is jealous of all the love&amp;attention voting rights icon Lewis has received culminating with his burial  today." Little boy" Trump wanted to show the world that he could steal what Lewis fought 4-the vote!

Watchdog group: Trump campaign improperly masking payments
Trump is such an idiot.
Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
This reveals more about Trump's desperation after his chaotic mismanagement of the global pandemic killed 150,000 Americans and left our economy in ruins than about what's going to happen in November.   Make a plan to vote today:   #nhpolitics
Trump loves creating doubt. He believes his disciples will do anything to keep him in power.
A hallmark of authoritarianism is having democratic processes that are just for show to enact the despot's will. Trump is giving a signal to his Congressional loyalists. He can't do this himself, but they will.
NH GOP governor  pushes back hard on Trump floating possibility of delaying Nov. 3 election #nhpolitics
(Trump himself voted by mail, in THIS cycle.)
Since when does Trump care what the Constitution says though??
If you had asked me in 2016 if Trump would try and delay the 2020 election because he was responsible for 30 million people being out of work and causing massive social unrest, I would have said that seemed like you were low balling it.
We always knew that Trump would try to find a reason to attempt to delay or cancel the election that would boot him out of office, but his own chaotic mismanagement of a global pandemic that killed 150,000 Americans was not on my bingo card.
“I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. Is there a way we can do something like that by injecting or almost a cleaning...” - Trump  NEVER says bleach like you insist. The media did though. It was a question to a medical professional you hack!
Millions losing health insurance right now is a catastrophe. Lowering health care costs and expanding access to care is my top priority, and I have the expertise and actionable plans to actually do that. We can't afford anything less. #nhpolitics

Biden Harris Yard Signs with H-Frames 12
Yes vote for who you want... Consequences be damned.  Just don't pretend Biden=Trump.
Let's say you're right.  TRUMP IS 1000X WORSE FOR LGBQT RIGHTS.  AND HE LITERALLY STEALS/CAGES CHILDREN FROM ASYLUM SEEKERS BY THE HUNDREDS, THOUSANDS.  You can't see the difference? Shame on you!  Don't hide behind Bernie.  Bernie is VOTING FOR BIDEN because he's NOT AN IDIOT.
PPS: I'm not TELLING you to vote for Biden. I'm just stating the effect of choices that you have.  It's PURE BS to say that Trump and Biden are the same.  If you're ok with letting Trump win, that's your choice.  But OWN IT.  Don't hide behind Bernie...  ...BERNIE IS VOTING BIDEN
Who says I voted for Biden?  You don't control my vote.  You holding the Democratic party (and thus the nation) HOSTAGE TO YOUR SELFISH DEMANDS is HELPING TRUMP.  YOUR ULTIMATUM IS HELPING TRUMP.  If you're not against Trump, you're with him.  PS: BERNIE SUPPORTS BIDEN.
Considering the National Letter Carrier Union’s recent endorsement of Biden, any Trump supporter who has a sign indicating so in his or her front yard, should either vote in person, or drive their ballot to town hall themselves.  No joke. Just be safe.  You never know.
Something is not passing the smell test for me.  In their three joint appearances so far, neither Biden nor Harris have taken any press questions.  And now, it looks like none of Biden’s campaign are going to be making appearances on the Sunday morning talk shows tomorrow...
This woman is such a monster. Let's laugh of the credible sexual assault allegations against Biden. Let's laugh off him drafting the Patriot Act. Let's laugh off of very rotten thing the man has ever done. Let's pretend it's fine because that's what helps us beat Trump. Go away.
Leo I don’t think Kamala Harris was picked because of her race I think she was picked because in the primary she did a lot of damage to Joe Biden They needed her to basically kneel before him To show democrats he is all powerful the supreme race the great one a royal emperor 👎🇺🇸
I’m gonna vote for Biden and if he actually follows through with his proposals then great I got what I wanted right? But if shit doesn’t change and nothing improves and he backs out on everything he’s promised I want every single liberal to give me a rimjob
You can't see a difference between Trump and Biden?  ONE of them will be elected. If you throw your vote away on a 3rd party candidate, that means YOU DON'T CARE IF TRUMP IS REELECTED.  You either OPPOSE Trump, or you DON'T.  There is only ONE way to OPPOSE Trump: Vote for Biden.
I don’t know if you’ve been paying attention but Joe Biden promised to stop arming the Saudis
I thought you consider AOC an imperialist because she’s voting for Biden.
Are you really an anti-imperialist if you can’t decide between Trump and Biden?
About Kamal: Biden said his VP choice would be a woman-then he said  a woman of color-this was HIS prerequisite-he picked her because she was a black woman-he made race a criteria-so picking on her record is not racist--but because she is running for VP.
Biden said his VP choice would be a woman-then he said  a woman of color-this was HIS prerequisite-he picked her because she was a black woman-he made race a criteria-so picking on her record is not because she is black-but running for VP.

That is a lie! Biden has had 50years to suggest change. Not a word
Everyone wants changes to be made for voting in this election due to the Coronavirus, but for some reason, the Biden camp refuses to consider moving up the debate schedule to accommodate the larger than normal early voting.  Something is not adding up. #Debates2020
...has been usually lost in the mainstream media coverage of the event.  This event is a few years old, but Biden has been bringing it up and that is why it is getting attention again.
President Trump has taken questions at the end of all his press conferences the last several days since the VP announcement. (He almost always does anyway.)  Biden and Harris have taken a grand total of zero at their three events together so far.  🤔
now you just need somone to tweet from your account like Biden does 😆
Vote for Biden so Trump doesn’t turn our country into an autocracy.
It will be fun the day after the election to see the sure thing of Biden go down ( which Harris has done) to defeat you know like your last sure thing Hillary
This is complete and utter nonsense. Let's get specific: In what way is America gone forever if Biden wins the election? We'll still have our Constitution with all of its checks and balances and we'll still have our votes to hold leadership accountable. 1/2
Oh Hillary that is just not true! The postal service is does need some changes. The reality is that even if the money the money you and your wackos would not allow time to make the changes needed for this election. It certainly was not a priority under The Obama &amp; Biden administr
It is not because Kamala Harris is a woman, or because she is not white, that people like me have an issue with her, and might be perceived as “freaking out” about her.  It’s 1) her views on the issues, and 2) considering Biden’s age and evident cognitive decline, the reality...
I copied this; following the announcement of the historic peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made the astonishing claim that the Obama admin was partially responsible for preparing the way for the deal.
I agree - I can’t stand Trump but I won’t vote for Biden either because of this. I will blank the ballot for the second presidential election in a row.
That’s the Biden campaign calling to see if thegg th should remind you to vote on Election Day
I dont know if I should like biden or not.  But at this point, anything is far better than tru.p
It’s funny everyone is using my  comment about Biden being an EMPTY VESSEL They did this with a lot of my words like ABOLISH &amp; TROJAN HORSE LOL 😀🇺🇸
It seems like if Biden loses we’re not getting a better candidate next time. No valid reason not to vote for Biden.
I am making this clear now. If you consider yourself a leftists, democrat, liberal, socialist, soc-dem, etc... and you don’t vote for Biden as well as advocate for an independent; You are a rat fuck, piece of shit, privelaged mouth breather who has no business talking politics.
Stop complaining about Biden when the alternative is 10x worse.
Biden and Harris are smoking up some weed right now, coming up with their Crime Bill for 2021. I guess November 3rd is just a test to find out if it's true that poor kids are just as bright as white kids.
I love the implication that Schumer is somehow a stronger personality than Biden. I mean, who looks at Chuck Schumer and thinks, There's a charisma machine.
Lol 😂 , that tweet was about Biden taking credit for the UAE / Israel peace deal .   ✅🇺🇸

Plagiary knock this stuff out  For the debates I am hopeful they Michael Buffer to come stage. Yelling Lets get ready to Rumble. Make Biden and the President shake hands. Have the moderator come and give them the rules.  POTUS goes back to his podium. Joe is looking boxing gluvs
Biden is a lost cause. I bet overnight when Biden is sleeping they slip on ear buds and sublimely tell him the facts as they see it.
The longer people say that the less a chance change will every come I like Biden 12 years ago but he is clearly not at the top of his game
I thought their names were “Braindead Biden and Heels High Harris”!
There is simply no greater moral or human rights  issue in our time than abortion.  It kills more innocent people than anything else.  I hope people understand the gravity of this issue, and think long and hard before voting for Biden/Harris or anyone of any political party...
...would be the most pro-choice, pro-abortion one ever.  The differences could not be more stark.  For those of us who believe in the sanctity of all human life from womb to tomb, the prospects of a Biden/ Harris Presidency should cause us grave concern.
In this election you will see the greatest disparity in terms of candidates positions on abortion than ever before.  The record clearly shows Trump/Pence is the most pro-life, anti-abortion administration since Roe v Wade, and it also shows a Biden/Harris administration...
I had my doubts about Biden’s Catholicism already with his stance on abortion, but his selection of someone like Harris, confirms my belief that he does not take it very seriously.
But upon reflection, I think that speaks to the reality that everyone is thinking right now, that Kamala would really be the President if they are elected, considering Biden’s age and clearly evident cognitive decline.
Wtfiswrongwithyou? Trump is a confirmed pathological liar. Saying Biden is a liar is mighty funny coming from a JPS trump supporter. Bless your brain
The thousands that lined the streets in Ohio recently wasn’t a rally, either....and all they wanted to do was wave to a freakin car that rode by...  You can ignore the truth all you want, and live in your fantasyland...but it’s 4 more years, n Biden choosing Harris guaranteed it
That is fake because if she was really looking for the truth she wouldn’t run with corrupt Biden
She has no brain like Biden They should name their ticket DUMB &amp; DUMBER 😀🇺🇸👎
Are you that out of touch?  The DNC was calling her a Russian spy, Assad apologist, etc. A two time veteran who has had extensive background checks and security clearances.  The second she “endorsed” Biden it all went away.  Hmmm🤔
Biden cannot fly? Is it out of fear? Did Biden see a gremlin on the wing of the plane?
Is he taking the same road Hillary took to-the White House? 4 years and the best you do is Biden and Harris??? Trump will be re-elected and it’s the Dems fault-
Stop name calling with Biden.  POTUS you come off as a bully. Your base or core voters will not stray because you stopped assaulting a mentally ill senior.  Do not shoot at Camela. She is not Hilarity. Nor is she Black. A person of color does not mean black.
How is Joe Biden going to run for President after he's charged with treason?...He'll run from his jail cell like Eugene Dibs did. #MAGA
If Joe Biden dies in late in October, what happens on election day?
Business Insider Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back    Biden will feign a stroke late in October.

As a right-leaning political outsider, Kamala Harris as VP makes no sense to me.  1: CA is a safe state for Biden  2: She has little-to-no momentum in the primaries  3: BLM is reinvigorated and she locked people up for non-violent marijuana charges The Donald should be thrilled
They're gearing up to send more black men to prison. A Biden Harris ticket would essentially guarantee that the US will never not be the most incarcerated country on the planet. This is such an unbelievably dark election for the people and history of America. There's so much evil
Looking forward to watching these two - and many other inspiring Democrats - at the 2020 Democratic National Convention next week!  #DemConvention  Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
She’s absolutely the safe choice. We saw what an all white ticket did the last time and neither of their polices are left enough to upset the moderates and independents. Biden isn’t left enough for most dems, me included. I’m so much less excited than I was when Hillary ran :/
Biden can't speak.
Perhaps but history is against her - George HW Bush was only VP since Martin Van Biden to become president after his predecessor competed his term
Enough said about Biden. What a leader.
Sorry if this sounds like fluff as refreshing as listening to Biden and Harris was, it was also refreshing to see how much their spouses really seem to love them.
The DNC working with Jill Biden have come up with a plan to help Joe in campaign events when he leaves his basement. Here is a picture of that effort
So that is what Biden and her have in common.
Skip the debates? It because we have seen Biden for for so long he we need to see him in a debate. I will retire in a year. I was 10 when he first won office.
The saddest thing will be if Biden wins. Then it is the fault of all the fools who voted for him!!

Clearly Joe Biden didn't select Kamala Harris (period).
Um Biden IS Catholic 🤨
You thinking this is a good line of attack in Biden is hilarious. #DumpTrump2020  #BidenHarris2020  #BlueTsunami2020
pushing radical politics online and voting for biden/harris is kinda like...       💭 🤔  bragging about how much you love spicy food and pulling taco bell picante out your purse
This is a big hit. She will say I was just there for hope.   Question, Camal did you come out and say you an apologize for acting with out care about the truth?  Bet you did not. Go smoke a bone and you and Biden can listen to music that won't be written for 3 years. HASHAHAHAH
Are you talking about yourself?  Biden/Harris 2020😇😇😇
Treating our poorer citizens as lesser citizens speaks volumes about you and your whole administration. All Americans do not matter to you. Icant wait to vote for Biden/Harris. #DumpTrump2020  #BidenHarris2020  #BlueTsunami2020
I’m not questioning her qualifications. Just the selection by Biden.
Yeah I’m not that naive to junk that it’s all the candidate. But all the talking points today has tried to paint the picture that it was Biden who is bringing her in.   But after all the animosity during the campaign it just doesn’t seem like it’s a blend of ideas here.
So these turds think it's okay that Fearless Leader can conduct policy via Twitter, but Biden can't announce his pick online? OK, got it...😏
Both could be an option but don’t feed me the line that it was all Biden.
Honest question.   Did Biden really pick Harris or did the DNC pick Harris for Biden?
What bullshit. #CrookedJoe picked #Catholic hater Kamala Harris for VP. Send Harris &amp; Herono asked a Trump nominee to resign from the Kights of Columbus but Biden is #Catholic? : Biden Plays the Catholic Card
I have a good title for Harris &amp; Biden The ROOSTER &amp; The Canary Get it rooster becomes she’s a cocksucker &amp; canary because it is a bird that is used to die Its life has no valu like JOkE 👎😀🇺🇸
Donald Trump isn’t going to go after policy issues. He’s going to go after the context of Joe Biden’s and Kamala Harris’ character. Donald Trump is and always will be weak.
Nail, meet head! So well said. Thank God those white fossils didn't bbn prevail. I also hope Obama keeps his ear in Biden cuz, well, Biden...
I supported bernie but never got t hff e bernie bro meme. I WILL and DO support Biden and always was gonna support any Dem. Love Kamala too. This is t hff e most important election of our lives
With respect, the “America as you know it will be gone forever” is nothing more than scaremongering. There is nothing extreme about Biden, and all of the constitutional checks and balances will still be in place. Trump’s divisiveness as a tactic must be repudiated loudly in Nov.
Biden is the candidate-Dems got that wrong as well-
No way! It hurts like hell. He is such a nice guy. Reminds me of a Hispanic co worker who thinks Biden is evil. They are lost to Putins propaganda and the dark web. We must shut those down! Fox news needs to be sued for slander. Outrageous!
I hope and pray you will have a prominent role in the Biden admin. I also dream of an all black administration one day. I believe the saving of this country will come from ur black citizens. I for one am ready
Just compromise. Something is better than nothing.  Why is that so hard? After biden wins, you can kick ass but you are losing this argument.  I'm a Bernie supporter and now  Biden/Harris "bro". Dont make is suffer to get at tRump. Please! Pretty please Speaker!
The same reason they picked her for VP She is another empty vessel like Joe Biden They don’t have to worry about her going rogue like Barack Obama 👎😀🇺🇸
History was made today 8-11-2020: the first African American woman - of Jamaican and SouthAsian descent - will be the running mate to #Biden, the presumptive Democratic Nominee for President of the United States. Kamala's mother was a trailblazer herself! #WomenSupportingWomen

Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. I'm hip with it.
Fox's Cavuto fact-checks Trump camp claim that Harris called Biden racist: 'She never did'
This how Joe Biden started out?
I’ll say this, as DA -  record is problematic. As a US Senator her voting record and advocacy on policy issues satisfy me thoroughly - and certainly moreso than Biden’s.  I’ve settled for Biden.  I’ll vote for Harris.
Ridiculous. Neither Biden nor Harris support socialism. This life-long GOP voter (until Trump) will never support the current GOP ticket, nor will I vote for anybody who doesn’t distance themselves from Trump.
BIDEN-HARRIS ticket is awful!!!!  VOTERS: yeah, but the alternative is T...   VOTERS WILL REJECT THE BIDEN-HARRIS TICKET
Biden/Harris a Winning Ticket! We’re ready for November! Couldn’t be happier with this choice! Team Biden for the WIN! ❤️
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
BREAKING: My Trump-voting Republican father said he thinks Kamala is a good pick. He likes that Biden and Harris competed hard then patched things up, and that she's not hard left. Also, she's pretty. (Doh)
“Kamala” James Harris dies on Sunday, Kamala Harris is chosen as VP running mate on Tuesday. #illuminati
It should be noted that Trump was not mentioned once in this press release as the alternative to Biden-Harris. Most likely because he’s exceptionally unpopular in NH. #nhpolitics

Joe Biden helped write the 1994 crime bill and Kamala Harris made a career of locking people up for marijuana offenses. So there’s the systematic change you all wanted, I guess?
well it should help #CrookedJoe Biden win California. #RaceCard
and doesn't help him in any state he needs help.  CA was already in the bag for Biden...can't wait to see the ads showing her fucking her married boss for a job...literally...
OMG...between Biden picking Harris and the NCAA cancelling football, Trump is going to be in the corner in the fetal position.
This is Biden’s America....Trump is trying to stop it from spreading.  If you don’t understand THAT fact, then you really should stop posting such nonsense...
🆘 We Now know that Joe Biden under his current mental state”Will DO WHAT he is TOLD!”Prominent Black businessmen ORDERED Biden to pick a Black Woman to be his VP running mate in Nov or lose the election!So if Biden Wins Harris will be Second in line and could become POTUS ✅🇺🇸
#VPPick  I’m a little surprised; I thought it was going to be #SusanRice . I’m not sure how Kamala helps Biden in the swing states.  It will be interesting to see how/ if this pic helps or hurts him.
Kamala Harris on the ticket with Biden just made my day! First time in a long time that I screamed for happiness and not frustration at the 📺.
Kamala Harris Is Biden’s Choice for Vice President
And you know this for a fact? Even if you have seen Joe Biden tax plan whic I highly doubt, you aren’t smart enough to crunch the numbers! So quit taking out of your behind!
Imagine if Biden pledged to only consider a man? If you think that would be sexist, you agree that Biden saying the same about only choosing a woman is too.
Yet he still has followers. Truly baffles me. We need a landslide for Biden.
Depends on who wins the US election.  Biden: I’ll stay Trump: let me know the fastest way to learn mandarin and cantonese
Biden doesn't hate God, I believe he is Catholic, and I am as well. We believe in God and his only begotten son Jesus Christ. By the way John F Kennedy was also Irish Catholic. I had a picture of John and Jackie with little John outside a Chapel. Trump is an illegitimate POTUS.
No American wants to see social security defunded. Vote Biden. 🗳 #nhpolitics #VoteTrumpOut
If America wants Barack Obama to be president for another 8 years then vote for Joe Biden 👎😀🇺🇸

YES!!!!! Another incredible N.H. Primary alum is rising in the ranks! Turn PA Biden Blue,
Biden could nominate Ivanka as his VP and I’d still vote for him. ❤️
If for no other reason, a vote for Joe Biden is vote to get rid of AG Jaba the Hutt!
I voted for Susan Rice cuz she’d be the worst but Val Demmings would be Biden’s best pick.
We can’t let Biden destroy America
WTF is wrong with u. FYI, Biden hasn't won yet. If u compromised and told Americans in 100 days u and the next admin will fill those gaps, you would get support. But, you hate of Trump (which I hate too) is making us all suffer. You are a loser to us.
Love you, Amy, but if he’s Biden, please call them Harris and Warren. Or say Joe. Words matter, and first names signal reduced respect (when juxtaposed with surnames).
I did no such thing, oh You meant Joe Biden
I love Bernie Sanders with all my heart, but if people vote for Bernie this November simply because he’s on the ballot... that would divide Biden’s votes. Do NOT vote Bernie in Nov. I wish it could have been different but it’s not. We can’t have any more of Trump. #VoteBiden2020
Honestly, whether Biden is up 7% or 9/10% nationally doesn't make a world of difference when it comes to the outcome. He would win solidly in any of these scenarios, only places where it'd make a difference would be like GA/TX/OH/IA/ME-2 etc after Biden's already at 334 EVs.
BIDEN SUPPORTS KKK
I know I don't much about you but I have been rooting for you to be picked by Joe Biden as his running mate.I believe you're are very qualified, intelligent and at the same time a beautiful woman in &amp; out.Your dreams are valid and may God bless you.
I don’t care who the VP is, Biden has my vote. ❤️
This will be money very well spent. The GOP is so out of touch with what our country actually needs. Go BIDEN!
Your party nominated Biden, this should the #1 reason why you're far from overconfident.
He acting like Biden  by saying he comes from a blue collar family Scaramucci is an idiot 👎😀🇺🇸
"It's shocking that Joe Biden would even consider putting communist Karen Bass a heartbeat away from the presidency – but that’s exactly what he’s doing."
She talks like Biden have them talk at the same time to get a complete sentence 👎😀🇺🇸
🆘NOW we know there is a 200 mph Electric Corvette coming thanks to Joe LMAO 🤣 .That was a GM Competitive  Secret Joe !        IF by some miracle Joe gets Elected in Nov:    Joe will have the SECRET NUCLEAR CODES  🤦‍♀️ Xi Jinping 🇨🇳 standing by 😱.
They way Biden is campaigning, he welcomes any distraction!
I don't VOTE for IMPEACHED assholes, he can stick radical left up where the sun don't shine. Biden will hurt the Bible and hurt God. What an F--in imbecile. #KanyeConJob
I don’t think Biden choosing his VP based on Gender and Race matters to #Dems/#NHDems at all. #nhpolitics
And... Jeff Dunham / Ventriloquist, a guy who gets paid for playing with puppets. Hmmm...🙄 Sounds like that could be right up Joe Biden's alley, free hugs &amp; puppets🤢🤮
Is Joe Biden Mentally There?  via  “Wait what”? 😂😂😂
No...I think Biden should hang Trump’s mug shot!
I voted for the guy and I will again Biden would be an even worse choice
You won’t be safe in #CrookedJoe Biden’s Amerika! #nhpolitics #tlot

If you want people to like you, this is not the way!!  Biden 2020!
Pls.  It’s not Biden running for president. It’s HIS squad
Looks like Biden is pedaling away from Chris Wallace.
Biden wears the same glasses as you showed. Aviators is what I think is the proper name. But I am not sure.
Going for the Biden look?
The fact that I have cancelled Netflix should not be misinterpreted as a precursor to an announcement that I am Biden's pick for VP.
Oh Biden does that all on his own every time that he speaks
#nhpolitics #CrookedJoe Biden? Really?
Move along folk, nothing to see here:  Biden gaffes ignored by MSNBC's primetime shows for 3 straight nights  #FoxNews
The only person that Biden could pick as his running mate that would lose my vote- Trump.   In which case I'm just swimming to Portugal.
Hey Donnie. I think you miscalculated the Kanye West situation. I believe he will take votes away from you, not sleepy Joe. Republicans that don’t want to vote for you or Biden will vote for Kanye. Another miscalculation on your part.
This " I can't believe I have to say this..." on Biden tweets is becoming so frequent it reminds me of  #ToddlerInChief posts or this bit
How is it racist to say some people say this person will cause Biden problems?. I'm talking about a possible candidate for VP. So any discussion of a candidates negative points is racist? Don't think so,
If Biden raise taxes the rich, what do u think will happen. The rich will pass that tax down to us, the poorer people. That could mean lower wage increases, job cuts, higher prices, a ripple effect back down to us. Raising taxes on the rich is a joke. People like u r fooled by it
🆘Joe! TAX or CONFISCATE the Remittances those Illegals are sending back to their home countries &amp; if you want them to have Health Insurance Fund it through Illegal’s Remittances !Leave Citizens Taxpayer Dollars Alone!Drop Out Joe!  ✅🇺🇸
Joe,did you know there are about 48 million African American Citizens  and around 27 million Hispanic Citizens/59 million Hispanics in total in US ? You managed to Isolate yourself from 14 .6 % of America . You need to drop out now ✅🇺🇸
But China and Iran don’t want Trump? Is Biden weak with them? You guys are idiots
FATHER the SLEEPER has AWAKEN....Donald Trump, WE come for you!

No what its saying is that if Biden had 1000 voters,  333 of them are now less likely to vote for him. There is no mention of any one being MORE likely to do anything.
Or such thing as putting my big boy pants on and supporting any of the following...Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and/or the coronavirus crisis
I agree with Biden here. Abortion isn't about rights and responsibility started in the bedroom.
There's like a 5% chance Biden wins you know that right?
Leo I don’t think Kamala Harris was picked because of her race I think she was picked because in the primary she did a lot of damage to Joe Biden They needed her to basically kneel before him To show democrats he is all powerful the supreme race the great one a royal emperor 👎🇺🇸
I’m gonna vote for Biden and if he actually follows through with his proposals then great I got what I wanted right? But if shit doesn’t change and nothing improves and he backs out on everything he’s promised I want every single liberal to give me a rimjob
21 yrs ago Jen O’Malley Dillon arrived in Manchester to coordinate out of state volunteers for Gore’s 2000 NH Primary Campaign. She was the hardest working, most talented member of the entire staff. The Biden Harris campaign is in great hands. #nhpolitics

Biden doesn't support prosecuting the last administration. Keeps him out of jail when he's done. (Nudge, nudge, wink, wink, ya know what I mean?)
Literally never said that. Another lying politician. I thought Biden was racist kamala? Remember you believe Biden’s accusers? Flip flop bs.
They “got on board” because they’re opportunistic ass-kissers. They’ll shank Biden if they think it’s in their interest.
Good point. I didn't vote for the worst POTUS in American history. I'm voting for Biden/Harris
Although I’m off at college, today I received my “swag” for the Democratic National Convention this upcoming week! I’m excited to attend my first convention, even though it is online, and help Joe Biden win in November! #DemConvention  #mepolitics #joebiden

That is a lie! Biden has had 50years to suggest change. Not a word
The Postal Service Union just endorsed Biden. #TrumpKillsUSPS #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
"I believe the debates should now involve a Biden v Trump map test." This would be awesome. A simple test on major countries of the world. There can be no doubt who would win that...without cheating. Trump would cheat.

Biden's "Book of Trump's Lies". I have to ask, hownmany volumes?
This is complete and utter nonsense. Let's get specific: In what way is America gone forever if Biden wins the election? We'll still have our Constitution with all of its checks and balances and we'll still have our votes to hold leadership accountable. 1/2
Infowars needs a “Biden For Prison” T-shirt.
Biden has been complicit in helping the Communist Party of China shape the culture according to Communist values and beliefs. It is likely that this influence on our media will continue to expand here in our own country if Biden is elected president.
Boy I wish Biden would hold an event like this. What a man you are, congratuations😉😉😉
Now we know why they had to stop the dem primary mid run, then blackmail the other candidates to withdraw so Biden would not have to speak.
It was a reporter who asked about VP not being a citizen not Trump, what a set up, some reporter should ask Biden if he  lies or if his VP is a citizen, or what he meant by this that or anything.
Oh Hillary that is just not true! The postal service is does need some changes. The reality is that even if the money the money you and your wackos would not allow time to make the changes needed for this election. It certainly was not a priority under The Obama &amp; Biden administr
So it's offensive if Trump says it, but not if Newsweek says it? Wouldn't matter to me even if she is eligible under the 14th Amendment. I wouldn't vote for her or Biden.
I remember that so well, Trump was sworn in. It was so memorable. Or where you suggesting Biden being sworn in? Biden will see that crowd, leaning over to someone close, and whisper, what's the big occasion? Then Kamala will be told, you don't need knee pads for this promotion.
That’s the Biden campaign calling to see if thegg th should remind you to vote on Election Day
Look, I’d rather give Biden a try than give you 4 more years! Do you know how many people would leave now if they could?

I am making this clear now. If you consider yourself a leftists, democrat, liberal, socialist, soc-dem, etc... and you don’t vote for Biden as well as advocate for an independent; You are a rat fuck, piece of shit, privelaged mouth breather who has no business talking politics.
You do NOT represent my America!! Its either Trump, God, freedom, Capitalism,  or Biden, losing freedoms, being arrested for religion and Communism!!
That’s ok because California will go Biden/Harris.
It has been clear to me since the Senate voted not to remove Trump, that it is up to we the people to remove them and Trump.  In order to do this, we must unite and vote for Biden.
Your correct, I voted for POTUS Obama and I'm voting Biden/Harris on November 3rd from NH
Absolutely cannot wrap my head around how disturbingly low the bar has to be to consider Biden a “lesser” evil. This guy destroyed millions of lives, probably tens of millions if you count his foreign policy work and people are just like “pobody’s nerfect”

One Tough Question For DOJ If Biden Is Elected: Whether To Prosecute Trump
Biden has asked people to be patriotic to end the #trumpvirus . 1000 dead people a day for 17 days. What number would you recommend a mask you disgusting animal. Our families are dying! It’s a piece of cloth!
Trump just said that biden politicized the pandemic... But he called it a Democrat hoax like... Are you fucking serious?

Yet your party has Biden as the presumptive nominee, out of all the others in the running. How does that square with your distain for "white privilege"?  Time to drop this BS.
That's if we even keep being a country. If Biden wins, I'm not going to make the false statement. That I would leave the country. Instead, I would just hope my state, NH, secedes. Cut off that vortex of crippling fed. debt.
Let me know when she calls Biden a motherfucker that's apples to apples
BaaaHaaaHaaa  I watched Biden than trump yesterday. Biden was coherent, clear, and strong. Trump was slurred, confused and scared.
Yeah, I really can't have it with "both sides are just as bad" this time. I'm not excited about Biden in the slightest but fuck man, we've had concentration camps and secret police among so many other terrible things these past 4 years, it's obvious who's worse in this situation.
Don't you just wish his father wore a condom that night?
He chose Booker because Biden has praised Booker's policies on housing on his own website and said that he is going to expand those policies. Even though factually incorrect, it's not a leap to assume that Booker would be in charge or heavily involved.
I have no idea. Maybe because on Biden's website he said that he was going to enact housing strategies proposed by Booker and Clyburn? I have no idea why.
She leaked that there's going to be a hit on Biden.

CNN ripped Tucker Carlson apart for pronouncing her name the same way. Calling him racist and disrespectful toward black people. Biden does it literally the next day. Crickets.

Joe Biden is a single term president. He is too old to run again. Kamala Harris’s negative upbringing to power hopefully is because she had to play by what she was given for political gains. We should have a better candidate options in 4 years. This is the first step !
#TrumpKillsUSPS  we all need to pack our GO bags and head to Biden’s new house when trump does not get the hell out.
Promising to speed up the insolvency of SocSec and Medicare is a sure fire way of getting those elderly retirees in FL to turn out in droves, just probably not with the results Trump is banking on. The Biden campaign should just run Trump’s own words on a loop.
Who is donating to Biden besides China?
Well today's was a great ad for Biden. We went from a coherent speach from Biden to drunk uncle at Thanksgiving
even fox was afraid to report Biden was crying on the stage as Harris spoke of his son,,,,,the good one.

Clearly Joe Biden didn't select Kamala Harris (period).
LOL Trump was counting on Biden picking Bass for the same reason he was desperate to run against Bernie Sanders over Biden.
Um Biden IS Catholic 🤨
That's a terrible take. There can be no doubt by any serious observer that Joe  Biden would chew up and spit out Donald Trump in a debate.
We were honored to have had opportunity to hear from Senator Harris at our Flag Day Celebration in June and we are ready to go to work to to see a Biden and Harris victory this November!

In 2018,  was 99% sure that two Democrats he would not be supporting were Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. My how things have changed.
Didn’t Kamala Harris call Joe Biden a racist and say that she believed his accusers? 🧐
Yeah Biden will sign the laws, she’ll enforce them, just like old times.
See, this is how effective govt can be again. Ask, and in less than 12 hours Biden/Harris delivers.
I have a good title for Harris &amp; Biden The ROOSTER &amp; The Canary Get it rooster becomes she’s a cocksucker &amp; canary because it is a bird that is used to die Its life has no valu like JOkE 👎😀🇺🇸
Yup. Now "if you don't vote for us you're racist and sexist." There was no other reason that Biden HAD to pick a woman of color.
With respect, the “America as you know it will be gone forever” is nothing more than scaremongering. There is nothing extreme about Biden, and all of the constitutional checks and balances will still be in place. Trump’s divisiveness as a tactic must be repudiated loudly in Nov.
A white dude who worked on the Clinton campaign just said I was “whitesplaining” racism when talking about Biden’s past and how Harris attacked him on it in that debate 🤨
I think using NH signs from 8 past conventions as the backdrop for the NH delegation’s morning zoom caucus will add a bit of convention excitement. Not that  need to get any more excited than we are! Biden/Harris!! #nhpolitics
Sorry, watch a video of him from 2016 and one from recently. He had dropped. Keep in mind I'm not a huge Biden fan, I have no agenda here. But trump had taken a downward turn

President Biden. VP Kamala. Senate Majority Leader Warren.  I MEAN COME ON.

Ridiculous. Neither Biden nor Harris support socialism. This life-long GOP voter (until Trump) will never support the current GOP ticket, nor will I vote for anybody who doesn’t distance themselves from Trump.
As long as you don't Force anything, you still got my vote. But know wavering, I get any word your forcing vaccines, and I'll buy the whole town Biden signs.
She was really impressive! Really excited by Biden/Harris!
Far left radical? Seriously have you met Biden? #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpHatesWomen #Trumpisacrybaby #TrumpIsARacist

would not vote for her but I can see her as pres more than I can see Biden.
Just so we're very clear.  Biden &amp; Harris were not in the most corrupt administration in American history, didn't destroy the economy, let 160,000 Americans die or inflame the streets of America by being racists, nope that's the impeached Trump &amp; his toady Pence. #nhpolitics

Hey Peter should we start quoting the brilliant Joe Biden?
This is a c/p pitch for the Hillary 2016 campaign, no? Or yes, but Hillary was perceived as a b*tch so this is different? The overton window moves faster than this pick (or Biden for that matter).
Now the narrative becomes if you don't vote for Biden Harris you're a racist.
Gonna be interesting to see the Trump campaign continue trying to push the Biden wants to defund the police line after Biden picked one for VP.

Very happy for the Democratic ticket of Biden/Harris! I was lucky enough to meet both spouses of the future President and Vice-President!
I’m sorry but I utterly despise Harris. She’s an unapologetic authoritarian who will step on and destroy anyone she can for power. Her record as a prosecutor is atrocious. I will never ever vote for Trump, but this just made voting for Biden a lot harder for me. We’ll see.

Does the least harm to the Biden ticket.  Rice would have fed the Benghazi lunatics. And Warren is a) also old, b) white, and c) too far to Biden’s left for Biden to be happy.   Not the ticket I wanted, but that got decided long ago.  Predictable.  Trump must go, so... ok.

So if this started off with the GOP signaling to black people that they think they’re stupid and will vote for Kanye over Biden, and ends with the GOP getting Kanye sent to prison, does that help or hurt their standing with minority voters?
I think you mistyped that. It was supposed to be "top advisers told Joe Biden this morning who his VP pick is."
Biden should show up at the press conference and make the announcement there!  (with a mask on of course)
I do not care if Biden's plan is to sleep the entire time!  We need to unite, break voter turnout records and vote Trump out!  Every single message should at least mention getting registered and vote.  NH Democrats must turn out in record numbers on 11/3!
Voting for Biden
Like Biden, lots of meds.
Imagine if Biden pledged to only consider a man? If you think that would be sexist, you agree that Biden saying the same about only choosing a woman is too.
Karine Jean-Pierre will be Biden’s Running Mate’s Chief Of Staff.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO IT IS!  VOTE FOR BIDEN!
If Mr. Biden were my parishioner, I would have to follow the example of those brave priests who have denied him Communion.
Or, just spitballing, Biden wouldn't stand up and say he's not taking responsibility, and actually take responsibility, like a real leader, and do something about covid.
“GYM” Jordan the masochist and it would only take one good punch and hed be knocked out, by a woman nonetheless.   Sexual misconduct should never have allowed him to get this far.   We need people that are above reproach like Joe Biden !
If America wants Barack Obama to be president for another 8 years then vote for Joe Biden 👎😀🇺🇸
Biden was going down hill he had to keep peddling to keep his balance notice how he didn’t stop he would have fell on his head LOL 👎😀🇺🇸
Obama, without question!    Next to Obama, 2nd would be President Biden and 3rd would be Hillary Clinton!

YES!!!!! Another incredible N.H. Primary alum is rising in the ranks! Turn PA Biden Blue,
Where Joe Biden lives and where Donald Trump holds campaign speeches are two completely unrelated things but you knew that didn’t you?
And what does my race have to do with anything?
Biden's plan? Let Trump talk.
Obama wasn't a Progressive either. He was a centrist. You just don't understand the terms. Cops are fine, but with a current progressive effort to defund police departments and get cops under control in America, a cop might not be the best person to do it.
I'd rather watch a loop of Biden on his bicycle. #RidinWithBiden2020
Democrats must have a reckoning with their past not ours. Slavery, KKK, Jim Crow, Biden’s crime bill, ect. Only then can America heal.
I love Bernie Sanders with all my heart, but if people vote for Bernie this November simply because he’s on the ballot... that would divide Biden’s votes. Do NOT vote Bernie in Nov. I wish it could have been different but it’s not. We can’t have any more of Trump. #VoteBiden2020

Honestly, whether Biden is up 7% or 9/10% nationally doesn't make a world of difference when it comes to the outcome. He would win solidly in any of these scenarios, only places where it'd make a difference would be like GA/TX/OH/IA/ME-2 etc after Biden's already at 334 EVs.
She's a COP! She spent her career LOCKING PEOPLE UP. I don't like that. That's not progressive. I don't need to do research because I've been watching for the past 50 years. Progressive is a platform she does not support so STFU!

The stakes could not be higher in November. It is going to take us all rallying around the Democratic ticket to save the soul of our nation.   I hope you will tune in to the Democratic Convention next week and do everything you can to elect Joe Biden in November!
Joe Biden will reestablish America leading by example and put us in a position to address the challenges ahead.
Joe Biden has plans filled with actionable policies to address racial inequities in criminal justice, housing, health care, and so many more areas in a real way.   The current president does not.
Joe Biden knows how to get our economy back, distribute an eventual COVID vaccine, and prevent the spread of future epidemics.   The current president does not.
No...Joe Biden is a sick old man that will turn the country over to the far left. You know so much about Trump, why not Biden ?
Sounds like Biden's advice to his son
BTW I’m a huge AOC supporter and will be thrilled to see her as part of Biden’s administration. Cuz that’s how we evolve ya know?
If you buy that she's a progressive. More than Bernie or EW? I call bullshit. Kamala Harrtis is a centrist.
Trump better be ready for the debate because Biden is faking it.
im not paying Joe Biden to speak from  HIS Basement i am paying for the Trader and chief  to talk from white house TAX Dollars
Nope.  More than anything, I’m voting to *remove* Trump.   Biden is, eh, acceptable. And he could select something found forgotten the back of the fridge and I’d still vote for him.  Does it matter? A hell of a lot, yes. In so many ways. But won’t change my vote.   Will not.
I don’t care who the VP is, Biden has my vote. ❤️
#Biden doing the traitor thing again. I want a president that does not salute communist countries!
We can not let this happen! An American president spending our tax dollars on Americans is just once again proving how crazy Biden is! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
You lost all your credibility when you tried to say with a straight face that Biden is in a better mental state than Trump.
Ok.  But do you think that, in terms of mental competence, it is worse to mispronounce words like Trump, or not know where you are, what you're doing, what your name is, or who your wife is, like Biden
Ok again fine. But regardless of your opinion of Trump at least be honest and recognize that Joe Biden barely knows what's going on.
He has legitimately not known what state, city, or location he was in multiple times. He has literally forgotten his name. You don't like Trump, fine. But you're just being dishonest or willfully ignorant if you think Biden is in a better mental state.
Great point. Trump mispronounces a couple words. Biden hasn't known where he was, or what he was running for, or even that his name was Joe Biden on multiple occasions. Definitely the same.
I thought this was from the Biden campaign: #RIPKamala 😶
Her only weakness, as I saw it was health care, but that has to be worked from a position of power. No one can say how to pay medicare for all until they can view all the revenue streams. Would you rather give a friend $ to buy food or to buy a gun?
Never Trumpers are being paid huge dollars to support Biden.
Biden and his elite friends force poor black children into failing schools. Why?
He acting like Biden  by saying he comes from a blue collar family Scaramucci is an idiot 👎😀🇺🇸
She talks like Biden have them talk at the same time to get a complete sentence 👎😀🇺🇸
Now we know why he's voting Biden.
President Trump supports religious freedom, while Biden goes to pander.
LOL! President Biden!
If Kanye Somehow Stays in the Presidential Race, It'll Hurt Trump, Not Biden  via
They way Biden is campaigning, he welcomes any distraction!
Making ridiculous mistakes is not the same as literally not knowing where you are. Lesser of two evils I know. Although Trump is not the smartest tool in the shed, Biden is starting to not know what is even going on.
Right. Just like the assumption should be that Biden can't run a country because he forgets where he is or what he is talking about more often than not.
Trump can't ride a bike? Is that supposed to be a big win for you? Did you "get him." Quick question. Is Biden still making horrifically racist comments on a daily basis on live TV?
Thought it was Biden
Is Joe Biden Actually Trying To “Hurt God?” Trump Says He Is, So It Must Be True Erin Corbett August 6, 2020, 5:35 PM  NO—Joe Biden would never ever try to hurt God.  Trump has come up with more lies over 30,000 in 3 years
Thanks for saying. I think it is high time for a Progressive to have a seat at the table. Bernie supporters are still licking their wounds from 2016, let alone 2019. We had 8 years of centrists with Obama/Biden and the people are ready to have a voice that considers the people.❣️
Is Trump just trying to get votes away from Biden by introducing a “wildcard” nominee? Like is Kanye the new Jill Stein?
It's OK, he's Looking for the correct Progressive for the job!?! 😳  Why Joe Biden Keeps Missing His Own V.P. Deadlines
I voted for the guy and I will again Biden would be an even worse choice
Yep, but you have to remember that he’s only capable of thinking 10 minutes ahead. All he cares about is getting re-elected. By the time people realize what the truth is, it’ll be too late. If he’s still president, he’ll invent another scheme. If not, he’ll blame  Biden.
Being genuine here, what convinces you that Biden is going to win? I seem to have no hope we're going to get Trump out :/. ESPECIALLY given the sloppy campaigning - I feel like their doomed to repeat the same mistake 4 years ago
That plus the fact Trump simply does not know how to debate. He will make stuff up and Biden will be ready for it and slam the door on it. Then Trump will get frustrated and start with the insults and again, Biden will be ready and put an end to that. This should be spectacular!
Does anyone know about a secret deal between Obama/Biden between a high ranking sexual abusing priest in the Vatican and China that was shut down by Trump but will be reinstated if Biden wins. Just hearing about it, very complicated and sick !
Oh Biden does that all on his own every time that he speaks
Move along folk, nothing to see here:  Biden gaffes ignored by MSNBC's primetime shows for 3 straight nights  #FoxNews
Biden doing something criminal! Treason.
After Biden's comments on Black diversity, some worry blunders could impact support
How do any of Biden’s policies matter more then having a rapist in office? A man with no morals, pretending to be religious after constantly saying he is not and wishing well to pedophiles. How do you sleep at night?
My question, this followers purge - did it affect a single liberal? Can't imagine Biden's real number is over 17, so...
This " I can't believe I have to say this..." on Biden tweets is becoming so frequent it reminds me of  #ToddlerInChief posts or this bit
Yes, Saint Joe Biden, didn't he give the eulogy for kkk leader Robert Byrd AND call him a mentor AND friend? The reason for the President's blm comment is not the movement itself but the ppl associated with it that breed the hate and chaos. Nice try tho😆
Nope. The VP pick is the one move Biden can make that will dominate the news cycle   Why play his Ace now?  Only political junkies care about the VP drama.  60% of public only cares about Covid and the Economy. I wouldn’t even do it until Labor Day unless Trump closes within 6%
I am  getting tweets from Biden people attacking Trump for doing this. I hope they keep attacking him like this as it is the only way the word will get out to all the media.
While this from the  is the most explicit, the entire coverage of Biden’s potential running mate has been equally sexist.  But, YIKES.
Instagram Displayed Negative Related Hashtags For Biden, But Hid Them For Trump
I likely am, I don't see it getting better with Biden. I'm not sold he wants change, and the DNC just wants a status quo puppet. The economy, tariffs to get cash back and investing locally were pros, but he is an ass. And Biden seems like he has alzheimers which could be very sad
Have you not seen Biden's track record? His crime bill, pro-segregation stances, racist statements as of late? I'm not telling anyone who is and isn't racist, just pointing out this man surely is no straight arrow
🤣 I didn't vote in Trump, but back to my main point since you didn't read it the first time: IT DOESN'T GET BETTER UNDER BIDEN.
I wish I could be a wash out for one of the worst teams in the NFL, but instead I'm privy to knowing how big of a POS Biden is.
Biden has continually proven he's a racist shill. Nothing gets better under Biden.
Glad to see how much you love looking at other people's taxes, perhaps you should get a job at the IRS . Perhaps Biden's son would  like to show us his taxes. Also kids sometime read this site so we avoid 4 letter words.Anything to pretend the only thing going on is Biden's BS.
It is not clear that Biden will step down. I think he will be taken out due two mental incapacity. Then, if Hillary becomes the VP, don't be surprised if Harris is taken out. It sickens me to think that any of these things will happen, but this is bizarro world.
Exactly and she has demonstrated this over and over. Her appearance on the ticket was strange and I wonder if she was actually Biden's pick or is she there serving behind-the-scenes powers. Still, peace, love and blessings for all.
81% of people saying they'll vote by mail are Biden supporters.  67% of people saying they'll vote in person are Trump supporters.  Even Donald Trump can do that math.
Hick would be running way behind biden, but he wins narrowly anyway. it looks like bullock probably wins to get the Dems to 51... IA looks like it’s going down to the wire, so another narrow Iowa election might happen-carrying echoes of the dem primary so many months before
I see Bernie signs more than I see Biden signs  I also see Trump signs more than any other #Trump2020
🤢🤮 what about the “I believe Joe Biden’s accusers” which was said...  NOT DURING A DEBATE!!  I guess what she’s telling us is not to believe anything she says during a debate because... “it’s a debate”
Good point. I didn't vote for the worst POTUS in American history. I'm voting for Biden/Harris
No-one is safe from the utter contempt that Joe Biden has for actual people
The one unambiguously good thing about Joe Biden is how thoroughly he owns the Pod Save bros and their Democratic Insider grift by ignoring them every single day.
You are a despicable piece of tyrranic filth. I hope Biden eviscerates you in November and you wind up in prison for the damage you have done to this country for the past four years.
What are the rules? Kamala Harris is born of 2 immigrants, not citizens at that time, making her ineligible to be President, correct? I’m asking. Should Biden have to step down (if he by a miracle won), Pelosi (if Dems retain the House) would then become President? Right?! Yikes!

Your ignorance and incompetence has ruined this country, but Biden will fix is just like Obama repaired the wreckage Bush left.
When Biden is elected I hope these people can get the mental healthcare they desperately need.
Your correct, I voted for POTUS Obama and I'm voting Biden/Harris on November 3rd from NH
yo. When Biden wins. You know all you interns who run this will be fired. Right?
Truthfully, I believe she is looking at it short term for the relief everyone needs, but playing longball on a Biden/Harris administration doing a tax structure before Reagan and his Trickle Down
the election for president is for more than just NH, it's for the entire country. Biden/Harris would be better for the country overall even if they didn't focus on NH as much.
I mean, do you need any clearer indication of how Kamala Harris will say whatever she needs to say to get coverage than this? She's the perfect Biden VP in that she stands for nothing but protecting a viciously carceral state
Many of my fellow postal workers voted for Trump. Over 600,000 employees affected. Those are lots of votes that could go for Biden now.
Shit maybe Kamala Harris and Joe Biden will win in November
How did Politico know Kamala Harris was Joe Biden’s VP pick back in July when he probably still doesn’t know who he picked.
There was a reason that Obama and Biden's pants always had worn knees. I mean this figuratively, of course.

Great speech from Joe Biden. Terrific speech from Kamala Harris. Sometime you can feel the chemistry, this is good chemistry, Biden-Harris.  ⁦Just what America needs.  ⁦ #nhpolitics #JoeBiden2020 #BidenHarris2020
Biden said one of the reasons he chose Harris, in a word: “possibilities.”

Another Devastating Biden Ad from Team Trump
You’re not kidding. “vote Blue, we have scientists rather than the My Pillow guy!” and “Biden can drink water with one hand!” Oh how far we’ve fallen in less than 4 years.
Kamala Harris as VP will be impactful but can we also just take a minute to reflect upon how lucky we will be to have Dr. Jill Biden as our First Lady.  #WomenSupportingWomen #WomenInPolitics #BidenHarris2020 #VOTE #BlueWave2020
Kamala blasted Biden with fatal historical points, but yesterday just laughed and said it was a debate! Haha. There is no doubt that she is very intelligent, but also no doubt that she will lie, and accept anything, if it is in her personal best interest. She is not principled.
I'm not overly religious, but Biden is definitely Catholic.  Get your facts straight!
YES. YES.  YES.  Biden’s choice proves he’s neither afraid nor threatened to embrace those with different views from his own - GREAT choice!
Biden's VP pick slow jammed the news on  as a Presidential Candidate.  Let's watch, shall we? 😁
The game is on, for the next three months, and I've lost my patience for trying to be conversational with stupidity. The future of this country rests on voting Trump &amp; minion out, and if you're anti Trump, and still bashing Biden/Harris, you're helping their cause.
#Bioheatfuel  on #GSBiofuels: What the Kamala Harris VP Pick Means for Biden’s Energy and Climate Platform
Kamala Harris: A Tireless Champion For Health Care   Today, Vice President Joseph Biden announced Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. Brad Woodhouse, Executive Director of Protect Our Care, released the following statement in response:
Hell, I would vote for Joe Biden if his veep pick was a juggling mime.  Whatever it takes to get  the f*ck out of the White House.
Ask about the Biden charges please
Not sure 🤔 Biden is a placeholder to be replaced at the last minute due to “health problems” I suspected Michelle Obama to be put in his place. Now, I’m not sure who will actually be running for President?

the joe biden store website is down LMFAOOOOOOO
literally RIGHT after my friend and i were discussing the VP and i was about to get into the shower mr biden sends me a mf text
Incredible that we went through months of Veepstakes where multiple women were publicly hung out to dry by an extremely sexist process only to arrive at the choice everyone assumed Biden would make in March.
In 2008 the ticket of Barack Obama &amp; Joe Biden looked like America. In 2020 the team of Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris looks even more like America (Mr. President &amp; Madam Vice President)  #JoeBiden2020 #nhpolitics
I am anxiously waiting to cast my ballot for the Biden-Harris ticket!!  will make an incredible Vice President will do a great job wiping the debate stage with Pence.
If you are referring to Biden, I don't believe it says that.
Not nice. Biden is an asshole! I don't wish him harm. He can do that on his own.
Google "Joe Biden naked at pool" and find the US News and World Report article.
Have you googled the Biden material? I checked it before I posted.
Worships him? You really don't get the argument...and probably don't want to. Between Biden and Trump, Biden would be so terrible for the American public as he really cannot think well and clearly looks like he is in stage 3 of the Reisberg Scale.
It’s serious mental illness &amp; I had no idea it was such an epidemic here. Biden will make sure they get the help they need though.
Biden can’t win being the anti Trump. He has to detail a vision worth replacing an incumbent. People are loathe to change from the devil they know without solid promise of a better future.
Big Numbers, Electoral Map 334 - BIDEN        125 - trump              79- undecided
This week  touted a "data-driven campaign. (  Also this week  sent a mailer with a wrong address for a ballot app, couldn't even say who the mailers went to &amp; now we know many Dems received them. (  #nhpolitics
Hopefully all of us!  And ditto here--no matter who Biden picks for veep, he's got my vote.

Please Rob, get real. The Democrats have rendered our votes useless in recent years! Bernie had more votes than HRC, yet they pushed her down our throats. Now 4 years later, they're doing the same thing but with Biden. His temper won't win him any favors - not for the people!!
