These 2020 Democrats turn a blind eye to rapey men. But Democratic is not really my party anymore. It has been taken over by ex-Republicans. I don't hate them it's just that I have very little in common with a party that would choose a Biden or a Clinton.  However, #TrumpMustGo

Daily Wire: Trump Seizes Opportunity After Biden Gaffe: Biden ‘No Longer Worthy Of The Black Vote’
Option 1: Joe Biden is senile and old so we can forgive his overt racism but he’s absolutely not fit to be president. Option 2: Joe Biden is not senile and completely fit to be president, but he’s ridiculously and overtly racist and dems don’t give a shit.  Pick.
Because not wanting Biden to have access to the concentrated power exercised by Trump is not a good enough reason to leave Trump in charge.
I might bother if I lived in a swing state, but no way Biden wins Idaho. With Bernie it would have been possible.
Only if when biden wins all you MAGAts move to a different country. Deal?
A traitor to my Bernie values. I guess I am a coward. But I must cast a vote for Biden this time.

I'm finding myself going to a very dark place. Were it not for COVID, Biden would not be the nominee and would definitely lose. So, it would be fitting if it was COVID that ended his candidacy. But who knows, he's so full of himself, he might not even drop out if he gets it.

No one is advocating religion. Biden is religious - this is a fact. The ability for him and others to be religious, while holding their own beliefs is very important for representative democracy. This holds for being a part of any group, or party...

He’s literally working with Bernie on uniting behind policies. Bernie is getting his stuff done the best he can in the system he’s in. Biden sucks. A lot. But he’s the only option that isn’t actively destroying further leftist ideology.
If Trumps followers believe Biden can hurt God, then the biblical god isn’t a omnipotent as evegelical think and should really reconsider their faith.

Here is Joe Biden’s full quote from this clip: “What you all know, but most people don’t know: unlike the African American community — with notable exceptions — the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”
Make no mistake: Biden will end President Trump’s tough policies against China and stop President Trump’s efforts to hold the Chinese accountable. Biden would return to the failed status quo, allowing China to rip off America as it did for decades on his watch.

Yep. Particularly with Kanye abortion views. The thinking of many Republicans seems to be: Kanye is black, therefore his candidacy would hurt Biden. I think his electoral appeal among blacks will be limited. May be greater among disenchanted whites.
Biden essentially “looks” the same as Trump to the outside world — creepy old man status — but he’s got the Senator &amp; VP experience that I feel is necessary to be in office. If he wins, we move away from Trump completely &amp; we can start digging into policy/change.

Wrong. His running mate (regardless of color or gender) WILL BE the nominee. That's the way the game is played &amp; while that doesn't scare me ... it does piss me off &amp; always has. Biden's particular problem is that it's gonna be hard for him to ID a VP that doesn't 'outshine' him.
Just wait a week. It will be available at the Dollar Store-on the same messy book shelf as “Triggered.” Also, the well respected , well educated, no scandals,loyal,much loved, respected career politician Joe Biden doesn’t have time to read ghost written trash, the “author” is 🍄.
I mean if you don’t like Biden, fine. But vote for him so we get guys like this running the fucking health care show.
Just someone who can compare several numbers and tell which one is bigger.  After SC (when Pete/Amy dropped out) Biden was a close second, not 4th or 5th.

Not one state. We then went on to have Super Tuesday, and 3/10, and 3/17. But Biden’s performance in SC solidified him one of the front runners.  After that, when given the choice between Bernie/Biden the voters chose Biden.

Bernie’s in blue. Biden’s in pink.  It’s 538’s primary forecast.
Nah. If that were true they wouldn’t have flipped back to Biden instantly after SC. It would have taken several days to get new polls.  Polling was part of things, but it wasn’t the whole thing.
Vote for Joe Biden
The first 3 states were, demographically, perfect for Bernie. Super Tuesday and beyond we’re better for Biden.  After SC Biden had weathered Bernie’s best three states and was only 5-ish delegates back.  That’s not losing badly. It’s barely “losing” at all.
NH had 24 delegates. NV had 36. That’s 60.  SC had 54.  That one win propelled Biden to within 5 delegates of Bernie and twice that of Pete. It was a big win.
The other candidates dropped and endorsed after South Carolina.  Biden had come back before things coalesced.
Pete won Iowa. Pete and Bernie tied in NH. Bernie won NH. Biden won South Carolina.  There are only 4 states before Super Tuesday. Bernie only clearly won 1 and tied in another.
When people dropped out Biden had not only won SC, he’d won so decicely that he was just 5-ish delegates back from Bernie and twice the delegates of 3rd place.
If you’re not honest about why he lost you’ll just make the same mistakes again next time.  Bernie got plenty of coverage, and his ratio of positive/negative coverage roughly matched Biden’s.

I wish this was true, but it isn’t.  We didn’t learn when Ford pardoned Nixon, so the country could “move on”.  We didn’t learn when we let war criminals walk away scot free from Bush’s administration.  Biden will be elected and all of a sudden it’ll be “let bygones be bygones”.

If you want more Wacos and Ruby Ridges, vote for the guys that allowed them to happen, Biden or Barr... Or you can #VoteGold2020
You can’t support Biden? Seriously? Tell me that’s who you wanted to be president for years? Trump outside of the economy is a wreck. But no where near the wreck Biden would be. Get a better candidate that Biden
I think she has a Biden sticker on top of the mask
If the election is exclusively voting by mail... will joe Biden be able to figure out voting for himself? #AskingForAFriend #Election2020
so Maria Harf just called all of you gun owners violent . This is the left with joe Biden they will take our guns !
Because Biden will make Trump look like the moron that he is.
And?   Do you know how many things Trump has flip flopped on just SINCE being President?   To think someone won’t  change their stance on something after 30 years to meet the challenges of the times is absolutely laughable.   The attacks you guys have for Biden are so lame 😂
The “Biden is senile” train has left. It’s all you guys have against an incompetent, uninformed and unfit simpleton who’s obviously in way over his head.
Who’s trying to back out? Biden already said he’d debate him.   Biden has almost 50 years experience in government, 8 of that as VP. He’s also obviously 100X more intelligent than Trump. Trump doesn’t even read his security briefings because he DOESN’T LIKE TO READ 😂   C’mon now
Bring it on. Biden will destroy him in debates.
your not serious right ? Biden can’t fight his way out of his own Biden ,lol. Your afraid like the fake ass hustlers that are pulling all the strings . Joe Biden is sleep walking they just making sure he doesn’t fall in his face .
is a political hack and he is afraid cause we gonna see a man that can’t even  lead a fantasy football team . Joe you are one to talk about lies , the democrats as a whole have been hustling America 4 decades. Biden doesn’t debate its clear he’s a weakass bitch.
Trust me Kate he isn’t winning anything but a bed at the shady acre old folks home . And joe hasn’t not faced the American people he takes pre made questions by pre picked journalists. Kate couldn’t even answer that Biden will do the debates. Vote joe vote 4 socialism.#Trump2020
You mean his "allies" wouldn't do what is needed to elect Biden if they don't agree with his choice? What a bunch of bullshit! Vote Biden no matter what!
Thank you for the reminder! November 3rd is right around the corner, and I promise you I will do exactly what you said above, by voting for Biden!
We ALWAYS do presidential debates. The fact that one candidate has cognitive issues should make it even more necessary for debates. Voters might discover Biden’s issues? Yes. That’s why debates are a must.
Now yes.  in the past did in Nam.  if Biden elected...... No
trump has went full dictator.. never go full dictator.. #TreasonousTraitorTrump  #Biden will erase all of your criminal ,facist ‘laws’. #TrumpForPrison2020
Hilarious, but unfortunately too easy considering how far right Biden is.
Biden is campaigning at the US's center -- it's gotta be Duckworth.  Gave her legs for the country, Donald dodged draft.  Can assemble an AR15, Trump cant.  First woman to give birth in chamber -- suburban women 🧡  Easy to replace seat, solid policy chops.  Where's the downside?

It’s sad that almost the entire old guard of the conservative movement is now pledging their allegiance to Biden.   People like George Will and Kristol who lectured us for years now hate the greatest conservative president we’ve ever had. And I think half our GOP congress agrees.
What about if #Biden gets Elected?
is a democrat radical socialist liberal who is on board to make sure that Joe Biden is elected and therefore all about keeping schools shut down to hurt Americans to get Joey the election. She is politically motivated to keep the schools closed and to destroy kids!
America now that this has happened in Seattle under the radar that now makes half the United States police forces are either being defunded and or voted to be abolished and all in democrat run cities . This is what America will be under a Joe Biden presidency. Dem=socialism.

Camel-Face Harris to run along side her hero (Not)Biden . Remember how she dismantled him at the debate ? We do -but he already forgot-he probably forgot her name .. or who she is ! Burn !🤮
If you can predict that with Biden then you can surely see the mental illness in Trump. My daughter has Aspergers and Trump has all those signs plus lots lots more
This time last year my hopeful prediction was a Biden / Harris ticket. At that time there was not a collective backing for Biden...but now here’s hoping!!  Harris would be a smart pick for VP or to replace the despicable Barr as Attorney General.
Just like the HRC conspiracy, it will move uncomfortable Biden voters for the critical time period, then fade into the category of 'funny/obscure' electoral trivia.
This is what our whole country will be like If the radical socialist democrat get control of our whole country . Under a joe Biden presidency the criminals will be the protected .  is the one standing between this type of America and a law and order America.
Biden will have inadequate time to respond, all the allegations against Trump are already known, and people will be casting their vote before it can be thoroughly debunked.  If they're really good, they'll keep it really general so it cant ever be confirmed or debunked.
Now, it's well documented that Joe Biden has had issues updating his sense of personal space from the 1970 model to the 2010 edition.  This sets the perfect stage for an allegation of encouraging or operating a child sex trafficking ring a few days out from the election.
He is clearly on drugs...that they likely gave him.  They did the same thing with Hillary, but it was far less noticeable.  Biden's bell has completely cracked and he is unfit for any further service to this country.  the Liberal/Socialist "Cult" has taken control of him.
You mean like Biden
No, that’s Biden who doesn’t know where he is!
#Biden   I want to know this woman!
If you woke up tomorrow to ANY headline in the world news, what would that headline read?  #WearADamnMask  #Biden
You would need a personality like #POTUS to fight off these predators. Can’t help but feel #Biden Is running to protect his son.
While I don't presume to know who Biden will pick, Kamala would make an EXCELLENT Vice President! I've thought so all along.
And that will stop overdoses 🤔 tell me how that makes any sense . Atleast before the election we are seeing socialism being used in America so it’s easy to see what a joe Biden ran country would be like . The Purge
Biden, you will never get my vote or any of my families vote. You sir are the scum of the earth.   VOTE RED TO SAVE AMERICA   GODBLESSAMERICA 🇺🇸
Evangelicals are raised to  value faith more than doubt. Critical thinking is based on doubt, which is discouraged.  Biden's base has a lower percent of  white evangelicals.Since Biden will be elected, we are certainly willing to move all you trump voters out of the country. Russia or China are probably the only countries that will take you though. Bon Voyage.
And you are not worthy of the Christian vote or any votes at all. How dare you, a heathen in word and deed, say Biden is against God. He is a true believer and you have said yourself you've never asked for forgiveness. You won't get it either.
WhooptiFriggindo  #NeverTrumpers   A No Vote for Trump is a Vote for Biden.   Republicans that don't vote elect democrats
Seeing the DNC and Biden waste money in TX is glorious!
Name one accomplishment of Joe Biden in 47years.
You liberals can't even stand for the flag? You Joe Biden don't have this countrys best interests in mind.
That's right, the American people, the communists want Biden. They want to totally control you.
Sad, you sound as confused as your Uncle Joe Biden.
Although there is enough videotape out there for Trumpists to use an endorsement from her against Biden.  Sadly it will be used out of context. And we never know who's been asked not to publicly endorse for such reasons. She'll be around longer than Biden tho so 👍
Joe Biden: All-American Dad
Just a ploy so that when Biden loses, the DNC can say they gave it their best shot! Won't work! #Trump2020 #TrumpLandslide2020
I’ll bet you don’t feel a response is necessary 😂. Biden has spoken publicly many times especially recently. He is very eloquent. Trump can’t even read fluently from notes. Why would you say I hate trump. He’s just incompetent and incapable of be president. Do you hate Biden?
What a comparison; between Biden &amp; Trump campaign.  Sez a lot!
And, as smart as she is, she's an utter failure. Tough or not, she fits with the Biden ticket. I think the f up with announcing Harris too soon gave them enough time to reevaluate the heat against her. Enter Obama administration Rice.
I agree with this sentiment! Biden doesn't have the chops or the energy to face Trump.  It will be a glorious defeat for Biden!
I bet Biden can’t say ‘Build Back Better’ 3 times fast.
You mean "insane". Biden will turn this country into a Marxist country. Full of fear, take away guns, everyone on welfare. Sad, our fredom will be gone.
I'm registered to vote but I won't be voting for you, Biden! #Trump2020 #Trump2020Landslide
sorry assholes but Joe Biden's supporters are gung-ho and can't wait to get the traitor out of the White House so go ahead and spread your lies if it makes you feel better but we already feel good #YesWeCanAgain
Does Joe Biden know?
I doubt Biden makes it to election day.
Joe Biden is suffering mentally, and his party gives zero fucks.
he initially blaming Joe Biden 4 does Portland Fiasco that was started by a white nationalist this is his presidency it's happening right now it's not Joe Biden's America it's his and Trump if the votes aren't done by January 1st Nancy Pelosi becomes president
do you really feel that Trump will not be reelected in Nov? I'm a little shocked by this.  I guess Cernovich wants to see a Biden White House. What a waste!
Mr Biden, you would be the next to worst president in history, Obama has the first spot.Joe Biden forms better sentences than Donald J Trump. Biden is also intelligent and not a con man out for every available quick buck like Donald #TrumpIsLosing #DonaldTrumpIsAPedo #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie
What Biden is experiencing is devastating. And it's shameful that the Democrat Party has propped him up in a position where his decline is also so public and embarrassing. Like him or not, a man who has served this country for decades deserves better than to be in his position.
Yes! I want to see Chasten and Pete both be a part of the Biden administration!!!!!
Uhhh....In 90 days trump will still be president. He will still have the authority to do this in 90 days even if Biden wins the election...

I'm from #Idaho. I don't want creepy #UncleJoe #Biden sniffing me!
Biden is far from being radical left!!
I feel the same way. I will vote Biden no matter what. I do hope he picks someone that can bring the skeptics on board though.
👏👏 I know right!!! Democrats are some really powerful people. Biden has the power to hurt God plus democrats can create a virus? WOW! If we are that powerful then why don't we just throw the traitor out of office?
I was asked to justify Biden's qualifications.  It was a moronic and bad faith question. I don't care if you think you should be able to demand an answer when the alternative is a sh!tweasel like Trump.
I *wouldn't* sell Biden under your stipulation.  Do you not understand the very simple difference?  Or is dishonesty your only tactic?
I don't give a shit what you expect. That has nothing to do with Biden.  You really don't think well.
Biden is way more Republican than Trump!!!
Oh and Biden isn't a radical!!! He is more Republican than you are!!!!
News flash the NRA isn't the 2nd ammendment! NRA is a very corrupt organization and has been for many years now. Biden doesn't want to take away the 2nd amendment either!!! So stop lying!!!!!! #DonsNextCon
Biden draws distinction between diversity within Black and Latino communities
Me: "Biden's like a delicious, edible burger. Trump is a shit sandwich."  You: "So you say that Biden isn't worse than Trump."  That's how a hack works.  Trump is as shitty a person as you can find. &amp; again, anyone demanding evidence that Biden is qualified is acting in bad faith
I was not answering you, nor do I care what an idiot thinks about Biden's performance.
Why do you write "appeared?" The Trump campaign obviously did manipulate the images to cast Joe Biden in a negative light. More dirty tricks from Trump #TrumpHasNoPlan #DonaldDeath #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

That’s why I’m trying to recruit people who don’t wanna vote for Trump or Biden because then we might have a shot. Honestly, I’d rather vote for someone who actually wants to help, than throw a vote away KNOWING it’s just gonna help Trump.
If you’re not gonna vote for Trump or Biden anyways, vote for  who’s actually trying to change the country instead of just trying to split votes.
Really stupid take.  "Argue that Biden is qualified given my stupid assertion that American government has never worked."  Way to commit that begging-the-question fallacy.
Derp.  We're banning large gatherings for a reason, you dingus.  It's not Biden's health that prevents it.  I'm through with you.
Biden will likely go back to the Paris agreement.  But the problem is - you're a chump if you think the Paris agreement was going to be enough to reverse climate change - after it was deliberately watered down by the Obama administration.
Just imagine Biden he wouldn’t even no where he was at... it would be nice to have one good choice for President
Not once has Biden said he doesnt want to debate. More gaslighting
Men like Tucker used to own women like those on Biden's short list. It's just too big a jump for him.
The brainwashed that gets sucked into misinformation or at least can't tell the difference.  I do wish we did our elections more like a parliament though. I like Biden, but I do think he's to old. Trump also is to old amongst all the other reasons.
Obama/Biden Hopefully one day Pete Buttigieg
Thank you Biden for being uniting!! #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Voting Biden is like voting for a prowler to come into your home and shoot you.
ACA was originally a Republican plan coming right out of Mitt Romney's state from the Heritage Foundation.  T WAS A BIG FUCKING giveaway to the Insurance companies - this is AFTER Obama campaigned for Medicare-For-All (which Biden promises he will veto if ever presidented to him)
Joe Biden. Because by the time moderator Joe Biden, by chance, formed a coherent question, candidate Joe Biden would forget what the question was.
How can Joe Biden be a candidate for POTUS if he has no idea where he is and has a hard time finishing a sentence (and is as corrupt as the assholes who support him?)
Just because Trump is terrible doesn't make Joe Biden great.  This is the logic a kindergartner would use.
Everyone who died from Cov&gt;d19 will be voting for Biden in November.   #Mailfraud
No not reliable and still voting Biden.
Between Biden &amp; Trump is a phony choice.  Neither party (Republican or Democrat) represent the American people anymore.  Both these candidates are deeply corrupt as well.
I don't think Biden should deny debating him though. Stay away from him and just let the traitor make himself look like a jackass. Biden should do a cognitive and bring the results with him. That way he can shut his BS up right away.
Umm, Biden will veto it.  I'm not saying this, he said it.  If you vote for the Democratic party, you are a political chump.
Unconstitutional activity that Americans are now being subject too.  Obama could have reversed some of those powers before he left office but refused to do so.  Biden may not deploy the gestapo as crassly as Trump, but he's just another corporate stooge - as are the Dems.

Anything about Joe Biden?
Biden is more Republican than Trump!!! #CountryOverParty  #EvictTrump
Donald Trump wants to delay the election because watching Joe Biden campaign is hilarious stuff and he doesn't want it to end.
When Joe Biden says he's "in the hood" he doesn't mean the one with neighbors.
I’ve got a conservative doing it to me because I suggested that there were plenty of issues to pick with Joe Biden’s capabilities and policies and that we didn’t need to spread misleading videos. Informed me that saying this proved I had no brains.
Attempting to explain how Joe Biden’s mind work is not within my area of expertise.... not gonna even touch it.
I don’t even like Biden. But I will support upholding and defending the Constitution regardless. (FTR, I despise Trump, too.)
Then will come  those who remember their oath to defend the Constitution over some trespasser in the White House. The troops may or may not agree with Biden, but the Constitution says what it says. And Biden’s a Gold Star dad. They’ll respect his family’s sacrifice.
The real Republicans will be voting Biden. Biden is closer to being Republican than Trump is.🤷‍♀️
Yep, I'll agree that Biden's health concerns me.  But in the same vein of 2016, I'm simply hoping that other members of his administration will help shore up his weaknesses and pitfalls in a sense.
I don't know what four years of Biden would look like (at least not precisely).  In 2024, if we are at a point in saying Biden was an obvious mistake, then I'll gladly flip to voting for a respectable Republican president.  I'm just tired of hearing Trump voters say
"Trump has done an acceptable job and deserves another four years".  It's not even about supporting Biden to me; he wasn't even a top 3 candidate of mine in the primaries.  It's simply about change.  Change in that I know what another four years of Trump can look like.
But honestly the war with the communist sphere of influence and even isis is far from over and we all know electing Joe Biden is pretty far from the solution but in order to make this outcome make sense I'm going to have to be pretty anti Trump along with the restWe deserve better than Trump &amp; Biden! #UNITY2020 is on a mission to draft a President &amp; VP to unite the country.

Yes, Sen. Harris needs a position in the Biden administration but I'm not certain that VP is the best use of her talents. I believe the tactical thing to do is simultaneously announce key cabinet positions along with VP announcement.
I can't imagine anyone that could support someone for a position when they are clearly in trouble, cognitively speaking. Yet here is one supporter, cheering Joe Biden on. How do you explain your support? What game are you playing at? What do you hope to gain?
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.

Let’s see Biden go to Texas!
What I've been saying for months the that Biden will withdraw from the race immediately after he is nominated. At that point, under DNC rules, the DNC (about 700 people) will replace him with whomever they want. I'm guessing Harris at this point.Wrong again Chris. Why should Biden get a pass on people getting to judge him by allowing them to vote before they even see him debate? And if you believe current polls you are not of any use as a "journalist".
It was easy for me to decide not to vote for Trump in either 2016 or 2020.  Voting for Clinton or Biden too great a rejection of pro life values and, while neither party exercises fiscal policy discipline, the Dems offered, in my judgment, even less hope of that. Issue, not party
Or they just decided that Biden would do even more damage than Trump.
Put dementia and foot in mouth disease together and this is what you get! Doddering uncle Joe Biden.
#Biden what a piece of shit
So you want to get rid of the Constitution for Marxism? Maybe Sharia Law? That is what will happen. Biden will not be making the decisions it will be the puppet masters. Hope you dig and find the truth.
So do you, you support Biden 😂
Montana looks like Joe Biden is sniffing Idaho.
Joe Biden has turned into a ridiculous mix of BS and Dementia.  How is it all going to end?  I don’t think it will be pretty.
But that's your opinion, people that don't support Biden (who helped pave the way for Trump) don't see him saving the country or world, so why not try to convince people to vote for Biden by not mentioning Trump
Maybe give reasons to vote for Biden that don't include trump
You definitely aren't progressive if you support Biden and progressive democrats don't exist, you're either progressive or you're a democrat.
That's not how it works, not supporting Biden doesn't mean you support Trump, like not supporting trump doesn't mean you support Biden. At least be smart.
Except Biden is an ignorant criminal too who would have more help to further trash the Country. If you want progress, you'd actually have to vote for progressives, not people that helped give us Trump
Also, not supporting Biden doesn't mean you support Trump. I know, that's a hard concept for democrats
The democrats basically handed him another term when they chose Biden.
Even Biden isn't supporting it...
All you care about is trump not being president, actual progressives see how we got trump, which Biden helped play into it, and don't want the same shit
Not really, because there really isn't a difference between Trump and Biden, trump can actually move more to the left than Biden.
When you'd be one of them. But then again, Bernie Bros was just a way for centrists like yourself to alienate and demonize them for wanting better for everyone. Voting for Biden isn't doing that. Constantly voting for the lesser evil isn't doing that.
It's funny that you think Biden would be influenced by a progressive when democrats do all they can to stop them.
Lesser of 2 evils? You do realize Obama and Biden sent $65k in “hotdogs” and “pizza” to the White House right?
Well I’m a citizen of this country and I don’t agree with that at all. Biden is not Qualified to be president and we all need to see that
The more unscripted public appearances Biden is forced to make, the less likely he will win. He is senile.
It was very nice of  to make a campaign ad for Joe Biden
Biden can no longer handle a debate, let alone being President.
So are you admitting that Biden would say something to take himself down???
What legitimate good did Biden do???
I made a comment about Trump or Biden being a sexual predator, so this dude kept saying I beat and killed a dog and because I couldn't prove I didn't do it, I did it. It easily fell apart when I started asking where it happened, how did I get there, when it happened etc
Every dollar you don't donate to trump is a dollar you donate to Biden. So I don't have to donate anything to either of those assholes and I'm still supporting them??
Liberal hate 😂  So funny because it doesn't really exist 😂 The country should burn, but Biden needs to support M4A, cannabis legalization, defund the police and military budgets, GND, economic stimulus packages until this is over even with unemployment benefits
We’re not worried about you at all Joe Biden. American people see you in capable of running at 7-Eleven let alone this country.
Trump hated Epstein. Obama, Biden, Clinton’s, podesta, have all been to the island.
Joe Biden doesn’t even know where he is, the DNC is struggling to even find a candidate. You guys had 4 years to find a viable candidate, and just like everything else the do nothing Democrat’s did just that. Enjoy four more years of Trump, btw inflatable tubes dance better!
I still have yet to see one Biden sticker or flag, although you can’t walk through my neighborhood without seeing an American flag or KAG flag. North Idaho does it right!  #Trump2020 #KAG
Joe Biden also is complicit. He’s willing to be used. He’s willing to be a puppet. I have no sympathy for him.
But even Biden said things wouldn't change, and he isn't one for actually moving left to support policies that would really help the American people. Of course, you not being the VP would also be good for America
That's what we have to look forward to, if the likes of Biden, Pelosi &amp; Schumer take over leadership. The LIBERAL &amp; PROGRESSIVE COURT OPINION won't kill murderers of our citizens, but gladly KILL INNOCENT BABIES in the womb.
Biden doesn’t allow his staff to have it either. And yes it’s for security concerns.
If Biden wins there will be protests, if Trump wins there will be riots.
Biden is as obligated to debate as Trump is to show his tax returns.
Biden is like Politician Ken Doll Barbie. Now with a new outfit that makes him even more generic. And I'm voting for him. Insert generic Democrat vs Trump. That is exactly what this election is.
Vs Biden who won’t make it 4 years.
i was 5 years old when biden became a senator. im 52 and hes running fo president. jfc
You're privileged enough to say 'biden will get things back to normal' and privileged enough to be able to be ignorant in Bidens history and how Biden helped pave the way for Trump, Obama did too  Voting for what helped create the problems won't fix the problems.
Cause. Its. The. Only. Way. Biden. Could. Win.
Re your editorial "Putin Needs A Trump Victory:" Well China needs a Biden victory and China is a MUCH GREATER threat! Also not true that Trump is Putin's fervent admirer. He's tough on Russia &amp; China and puts America's interests 1st. So what is not to like about that?
I fucking hate Joe Biden. And democrats that actually think he'll move left, when they keep stopping any progress.
Biden doesn't even support M4A, during a pandemic, and people think he's going to change his mind later??? We've been seeing for years the need for it, what else has to happen for it to actually be implemented?
Not supporting Biden or 'working for him' in no way means they're working for trump, what an empty argument. And what makes you think Biden would actually support Medicare for All or anything that would make the country better?
And since the teachers unions wants to shut schools,when they endorse Joe Biden it will be the kiss of death for his candidacy.
Lol I thought the same thing accept Obama being Vice President for Biden!
Biden doesn’t know what state he’s in or what year it is. Democrats should be ashamed of this choice and will give Trump 400 electoral college delegates. Klobucher would have whipped his ass. Biden/Harris will be soundly beaten. The polls won’t capture the truth
Clearly, Biden will refuse to debate,  because he is almost 80 years old and probably incapable of playing a game of Chutes and Ladders with my 3 year old grandson. The Democrats don’t care.  He would just be the Bobblehead in the Backseat of of the Presidential Limo.
Hahahaha man I will never understand how completely ignorant people are . Biden can’t even wipe his own ass. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
Do you think Biden’s EC margin will be greater than Reagan’s 1980 thrashing of Carter?
Running Joe Biden is a form of elder abuse. Do liberals have any self respect. This is a medical issue and they are acting like all is OK. Go back and watch Being There and watch how they treated Chance the Gardner.
If you want to prove to yourself that google and the media are manipulating us do the following: Google “ Biden incoherent again today”. Since Biden today held 2 different public events today and failed on when or where it’s appropriate. See what you get.
Biden was incoherent today. A new poll has Trump getting 41% of the Latino vote. If he picks Kamala, he will lose the black male vote who hate her. The threatened school shutdown and city violence will hurt Biden. Trump does not deserve re-election but he will get 400 delegates.
Biden didn’t know what year it was yesterday.
I so hope that Stuart Varney is right!  The American people have to be smarter than voting for that burnt out bulb, Joe Biden.  It would be like hiring a child molester to take care of your children.
You're just as ridiculous as he is 😂 Biden and Trump aren't much different, and recognizing the similarities between them will help you out
Good old liberals being wrong as usual. I didn't know socialists were willing to sacrifice minorities, I thought thats what democrats and republicans were doing by supporting Biden and Trump.
Uh no, like I was telling him, nice try  No one said Biden is worse, but liberals refusing to accept that Biden helped build what trump is doing, and other democrats helping trump, it's ludicrous to think that voting for what helped give us Trump, would fix what he's done.
Clearly this is a commie muslim ot to undermine Joe Biden.
They’re called “Biden voters.”
Biden thinks it's pronounced Cameltoe Hairless! That's why he's into her. "She's a good kid...a tall kid."
If Black Biden has a chance to be leader of America, we know where it stands. I hope we don't have to find out 😁
Biden can't even keep his hands off of children, let alone speak to the press.  What makes you think he would handle the Corona virus better?
Its incredible how all these economic experts suddenly have the best advice to offer to USPS that was non-fucking-existent a month ago. Nothing to do with shitting your pants about Biden, no sir-ee.
What is the matter with you?  Biden Harris NO WAY. I guess you don't like your freedom. #MAGA #TrumpTrain
Blows my mind that you think that a vote for Biden is different from a vote for Trump. Feel free to explain what’s substantively different instead of just making a public performance of your incredulity, if you can.
The DNC needs a marketing strategy to constantly inform Americans what the Democrats have done while in office. This can't just be a process that occurs during election season but has to happen no later than day 2 of the Biden presidency!
Whereas Joe Biden’s response to “how will we hold the primaries on the epidemic” was “why bother holding the rest of the primaries?”
Means plenty.  Just like Joe Biden’s slut-shaming of Paula Jones and Anita Hill means plenty. Just like his fifty-year history of using Black people to scare White Democrats into voting like Republicans means plenty.  You go ahead and vote for the politer of two evils.
Literally nobody likes Biden

I should probably come clean here... I didn't vote for Trump. I dont like Trump. Your first clue should have been when I said he's truly a Democrat.  But you assume assume assume.  Trump is a douchebag, but Biden is a racist. FACT.
was almost worried about Kamala Harris as a VP pick due to her history of corruption, but Biden has done nothing to help them get elected anyways. crisis averted

I wonder where Hunter Biden is hiding out these days?
I know that you’re ignoring the larger issue because it’s inconvenient to look at from a perspective needing to ignore Biden’s entire career so you can pretend he’s going to be different fom Trump in any meaningful way whatsoever.
No, it’s the same issue. You’re just pretending that Biden has ever supported any public services at any point in his career.
Riigght....your presidency has made the US the laughingstock of the world...Biden and Harris will return us to being a respected country...#BidenHarris2020Landslide...#UrineTroubleTrump
The president in the title is Obama. Good read; made me consider that if Biden had run in 2016, he would've beaten Trump.
Yes, Trump, who gives daily briefings speaking directly to the press and people of this nation, is hiding in his bunker. Definitely not Biden, whom no one ever sees. Smh
Tho I agree that Trump could have taken action sooner relative to #COVID, do you really think you &amp; Biden, or matter Hillary Clinton could have kept the death rate to absolute zero? That's not rational or reasonable. So maybe Trump bears some responsibility but not all of it.
Thank God Biden voted to give Trump that power in 2002. Definitely wasn't shortsighted and stupid of him to be in favor of the DHS.
Just another Hiden Biden
America vote Joe Biden this will be everywhere . There will be disbanded police departments than Joe will get and take away guns . This people will next go to the suburbs cause eventually there will be nothing left in the city to loot or burn . Suburban mothers kids won’t be safe
all over the country people can’t express they are voting for  cause of attacks . The polls are wrong guaranteed most republicans or conservatives we don’t do polls and Trump has polled good ever . I’ve been across the country, no Biden signs no where
But as VP she need only wait out the expiry of Biden like Johnson. She will have a 10+ years' tenure. Horrible
Bernie not only got plenty of coverage but his positive:negative ratio was right in line with what Biden got and, historically, what frontrunners get.  The media didn’t sink Bernie.
Rather than making magnanimous and “big tent” noises, he spent the week after NV crapping on the party and praising Castro. It was disasterous (for him). It encouraged the moderates to coalesce and, after SC, that meant rallying to Biden.
Did you keep your doctor and have your premiums go down by $2500.00 ? Thise were lies the affected me personally. Did you bash Obama and Biden for lies? Than why Trump? ALL politicians lie. ;)

My promise: if my area does start mass mailing ballots, I’m going to gather as many as possible and send them all back for Trump.   No one will ever know I frauded Biden and I’m ok with that! Whatever it takes!
omg why has'nt biden droped out of the primary yet he literallt can't win
I get it’s a problem for you, but it isn’t for most voters. That’s the point.  You’re right it’s not a goddamned game. There are real impacts here. So why don’t you stop exaggerating about Biden and start working on getting rid of Trump?
On 1/21/20 the president will either be Biden or Trump.  I’d recommend you figure out which one is closest to your views and vote for that person.  Good luck.
Both polling and results after she did drop show her supporters were basically split between Bernie/Biden for 2nd choice. Her presence in the race didn’t change the result of any ST state and only cost Bernie about 10 delegates.  It didn’t matter.
I know what the “problem areas” are. But on most of it you just misunderstand the history.  Biden’s a mainstream Dem, always has been. And the party is further left than ever, Biden along with it. He’s not as far left as you (or I) want, but he’s certainly not “conservative”.

He’s really not.  Biden’s entire career has been a straight shot down the center of the party, and the party has been (slowly) moving left for decades.  What you’re saying isn’t backed up by reality.
Every candidate has a different path.  Warren has positioned herself as the compromise between Bernie/Biden. She doesn’t know if that’s realistic until she goes a round where it’s basically those 3  Staying in for ST made sense for her. She dropped after ST because it didn’t work
But Warren’s voters were basically evenly split between Bernie/Biden for 2nd choice. If she’d have dropped out before ST it doesnt change the result in any state, and only gains Bernie about 10 delegates.  Her staying in didn’t change anything.
Candidates have different strategies/paths and this different “this isn’t working” points.  Warren has cast herself as the compromise between Bernie/Biden. It made sense for her to stay in one round after it had basically gotten down to those 3, and that means ST.
Biden came in 2nd in Nevada, which considering Bernie’s strength in caucuses isn’t bad.  But Biden didn’t just win SC. He won it in such a dominating fashion as to basically erase Bernie’s delegate lead.
Seems like it’s satirizing Biden as racist and his VP choice a pandering one, both of which are accurate
Who is Joe Biden trying to name a movie actor?  Oh, I thought we were on jeopardy for a moment.

Debates are basically never a game changer. Few actually watch and those that do are largely partisans who mostly see what they want.  Debates didn’t sink Biden in the primary, they’re not going to in the general.
Ideologically she was between Bernie and Biden. Had the most name recognition aside from those two.  Her plan was to hang around until it was those two and then try to be the compromise. From that perspective it made sense to see how ST went. When it didn’t go well, she dropped.
Black Biden Building Back Blue Better should really be Joe's slogan
I mean, I get you’re not a huge fan of Biden’s. But the voters as a whole do like him. He won over a huge field and it really wasn’t close. And now he’s busy trouncing Trump.  I’m not sure why we’d want to “never let it happen again”.
"Not again" means understanding that Biden and Harris will never allow progressive policy in this country and that anyone who says they can be pushed left is a liar.
Lots of people fought hard for more than a year.  But because of the way delegates are handed out, once you’re behind you’re in trouble. After SC it was pretty clear no one other than Bernie, Biden, and MAYBE Warren had a chance. It was time to get out.
Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  Pete wasn’t leading. He was a distant 3rd, broke, polling below viability in almost every ST state. He dropped because he clearly had no path to victory.
Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  Pete and Amy dropped out because they had no path to victory (which is what you’re supposed to do). And Biden WAS making a comeback.
Harris was supposed to be an iseological ally to Biden but instead attacked him and didn’t endorse until after ST when he didn’t need it any more.  That’s just politics sometimes.  If Bernie needed Warren’s endorsement to win then they should have treated her better...
Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  It wasn’t “premature”. Pete was a distant 3rd, broke, polling below viability in almost every ST state. He dropped because he clearly had no path to victory.
Biden got delegates in IA.
Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  Pete and Amy were trailing, broke, polling below viability in almost every ST state. They dropped because they clearly had no path to victory.
Warren’s plan for victory was to present herself as compromise between Biden and Bernie - someone who could appeal to progressives AND the establishment.  It made sense for her to stay in for one round after it had gotten down to (basically) Biden vs Bernie.
Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  Pete wasn’t leading. He was a distant 3rd, broke, polling below viability in almost every ST state. He dropped because he clearly had no path to victory.

Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  Pete wasn’t “crushing Biden”. He was a distant 3rd, broke, polling below viability in almost every ST state. He dropped because he clearly had no path to victory.
I don’t know where you got that.  Biden’s up significantly in every swing state. He’s not only capturing the bulk of independents but - when pushed to decide - he’s getting like 6 of every 7 undecideds.  So much so that states like TX and GA are “swing states”.
On the other hand Biden’s strength was with African American voters - particularly southern African American voters. His plan was to survive until SC, win there, and be the last non-Bernie standing to coalesce behind.  He did just that.
Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  Pete wasn’t leading. He was a distant 3rd, broke, polling below viability in almost every ST state. He dropped because he clearly had no path to victory.

Dude we’re both voting blue, as I said. If you can’t be critical of the politicians in your party, you are participating in the same tribalism as trump supporters. Im not happy Biden and Harris are the ticket. But yes, I would much rather have them than the current circus.
Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  Amy and Pete dropped out because they had no path to victory. With a 6 delegate lead and 26% in NH, Bernie was hardly “running away with it”.
And Biden might have “baggage” as far as progressives are concerned, but Biden’s entire career has been a straight shot through the center of the party. That’s why he did so well with voters over 30 and African Americans.  His record wasn’t a problem for most voters.
Don’t get me wrong I’m voting blue, but this ticket is ridiculous and if you think Biden/ Harris are for the people... man. This is a conservative ticket with a Democratic name tag. The DNC is not our friend
Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  Pete and Amy dropped out because they were broke, behind, and had no path to victory. That’s traditionally what you do when it’s clear you can’t win.

"We need"  You know what we DON'T need? Biden/Harris any more than we need Trump.
So SC became the Hail Mary (that also didn’t work). When he lost SC he dropped out.  At that point, thanks to his incredibly strong support among African Americans - Biden is the only legitimate non-progressive candidate left standing. And the voters coalesce accordingly.

"We're not going to let Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris cut America's meat!" may be one of the dumbest and most surreal campaign lines ever uttered.
This is the safest idea outside of drive in ballot drop off locations. Request a mail in ballot and drop it off at voting sites. #BudenHarris2020 Biden will fix the Post Office.
"Truth" can be subjective. How someone selects, sorts and filters data/facts to make something seem true but may not be the truth.  That is why Biden prefers "truth over facts" because the facts would have been filtered and twisted to form his version of truth.
Why do you think we should be silent about their atrocious past records? Should I not criticize Trump for his use of DHS to violate protesters rights? And if I should call that out why shouldn't I call out Biden for voting for the establishment of the DHS?
I barely like Bernie and Tulsi is a joke. Criticising a candidate for their record is what you're supposed to do. Y'all get it for Trump why don't you have the same standard for Biden/Harris?

Candidates typically drop out as soon as it’s clear they can’t win. For the 3rd and 4th place candidates (Biden was a close second at that point) that was after SC.  It was 100% normal behavior. Only Bernie keeps going after the result is clear.
You are wrong Senator!  The 8 years of Obama/Biden were not the longest period of growth.  You’re not stating facts. The 8 years of stagnation were the slowest and lowest 8 year period.  You know this.  But, you are in politics, and won’t let facts stand in your way.  Good luck.

That says it all right there. Trump says to manufacture in the US while Biden actually manufactured goods in the US.

You have already collapsed it  Biden-Harris is our ticket out of the hell you have created.  Now if you can STOP CHEATING by trying to dismantle our USPS you will witness it for yourself. Remember karma is a bitch!
What would happen if you filled out your absentee ballot now, and then, God forbid, Biden dies between now and the election. It wouldn’t count, right?  Sorry to say it, but we just gotta show up, mask in hand, and vote. Time to risk your life for the country.
Trump supports fracking and beyond, and is happy to allow companies to do anything in their power to make a buck today even if it destroys tomorrow. I get the feeling Biden will at least maintain status quo.
I sincerely do hope Trump loses, but as one person astutely pointed out many months ago with respect to their choice to vote Bernie over Warren: if Trump decides he's not gonna play ball, whose base do we think has the organizational capacity to force him out? Biden? LOL
Biden has been running for almost a year. He has no message. Harris also ran and had plenty to say before. You’re running cover for them.

Is Saagar out of his mind? I saw his video about how Trump can beat Biden. I don't like Biden. I think he's creepy, and cognitively in decline. I voted for and donated to Bernie. I will vote for ANYONE before I'd vote for Trump, but I'll keep pushing for down ballot progressives.
I'm a progressive, and I have to say that this is yet another election where it's "the lesser of two evils." It sucks.  My question: Will it be easier to promote and implement the changes that you and I both want with Trump or Biden at the helm?
Biden is full of it. Did you call out his nonsense?
Biden to Tara Reade before/during/after penetrating her w/his fingers: "‘I want to f— you,' ‘What the hell, man, I heard you liked me.’ ‘You’re nothing to me. You’re nothing,' 'You’re OK, you’re alright,'”😥 IT'S NOT ALRIGHT!!!😡
The most ridiculous thing is that based on how quickly biden enters the frame on the same track after this monster train, he must actually be going insanely fast.
Hell fkn yes to NOT voting for Biden/Harris.
Two party system. Electoral College. I’m not a millennial, and I’m def not voting Biden/Harris.
They have Biden-Harris Pride shirts up! :D   #BidenHarris2020
This platform is somewhat progressive, and I should and will vote for him. So should everyone else who can vote.   That doesn't change the fact that Biden is not very progressive in terms of where i think the country needs to actually be.
If we aren’t fighting for health care, remind me what specifically is the difference between Biden and Trump?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Harris's time as a prosecutor needlessly ruined people's lives, and her perspectives on policing and crime are based in cruelty, "deterrence," and fear. I'm voting for that ticket, but we must address the fundamental cruelty of the "justice" system.
I think knowing this is true and realizing that Biden/Harris aren't going to be some sort of savior for the marginalized community is important while also understanding that Trump needs to go in the meantime.
The Biden campaign is qUiRkY
This is what Biden will look like come November.
The people insisting we can move Biden left after the election will be incredibly silent if/after he wins.
It’s fascinating that we are expected to fall in line and shut up in regards to Biden+Harris. “Better than Trump” shouldn’t be their only way of getting people to vote. They should be held accountable NOW and prove why BIPOC and LGBTQ+ should vote for them.

Well, the first part (sadly) is correct. Before an announcement of who it was (though most of us knew he'd pick Harris as his yes man), I said the worst part of this election is that we will be saddled with whoever Biden chooses for '24.
Didn't Biden announce only a week or so ago that he wants to increase funding for police?
Well, that'll make me vote for the awful Biden/Harris ticket now.
I dunno I always find it funny when the cry about me not voting for Biden. Then I hit them with the ol "I wouldn't have voted for Bernie either because I live in a red state."

Excellent as usual. Also, as I said weeks ago, I've gone to a dark place hoping Biden doesn't make it to November because I cannot vote for this ticket and I am done with Dems at the federal level at any rate. I'm not young and this is the worst Dem ticket in my adult life.

Let’s be real here. Biden is 77 years old. We all know what her being picked for VP means and how important it was.   She more than likely will be the first woman President, whether by happenstance or running in 2024. Biden has said he’s going to be the “transitional” President.

Bernie tried to crush Biden. Biden tried to crush Bernie. That’s what campaigns are.  It’s not somehow underhanded or unfair that people are trying to win elections.
It can’t pass! It can’t pass because you can’t answer basic questions like “how do you pay for it”!  You need 60 votes in the Senate. You’ve got like 25. After a blue wave, maybe like 30.  You don’t have the votes. Biden should concentrate on real things not fantasies.
Yes, but another thing that is different is that Biden is the nominee and he is horrid. Their positions are a slap in the face to both progressives in general and Blacks in particular. Will those groups still come out to support them? We'll see. #DownBallot
It’s funny you forget that trump was bffs w Epstein 🥴🥴 also I don’t like Biden!! So maybe next time get your facts straight!!
Again, show me the video of Pete supporters harassing election officials at home and I’ll concede the point. Show me Biden supporters booing Warren. Show me the pages of rat/snake emojis from Beto. Show me where Gilibrand doxxed critics.  Bernie’s campaign was uniquely toxic.
The Debate isn’t about the two candidates and what they want, it’s for the American people so we can here them speak to the issues.  Biden doesn’t debate its confirmation of his cognitive issues.
I mean, it sure seems more measured than The Economist's 91% Biden. Folks need to be willing to read a bit more, but I supposed that's what got us in trouble in the first place?
Has Biden given me good reasons to support him?  Why is it my responsibility? He's the one running. Spend all the money making good policy proposals and marketing them to the people.
I am not entirely happy with her or Biden in general but...but I am putting aside my  gripes until there is a better day to fight. Now is not the time to fight. The day is coming after the elections. Then drive them to make the changes you want to see. Now is not the time.
Some people (AOC, Tlaib, Omar, etc...) tried to help elect Bernie. Some tried to help Warren. Some tried to help Biden. Some tried to help Pete.  That’s a campaign, not a conspiracy.
Hey Trump, look at the stock markets reaction to the Biden Harris ticket!

Biden being racist doesn't mean that Trump isn't racist either?? You literally can't support BLM and vote for Trump
She just got a Netflix special. The lack of any standard in broadcasting has been a detriment to a functioning society. All the reality TV BS and, yes, Sarah Cooper's schtick ... meh. Satisfaction with mediocrity in this also translates directly to acceptance of Biden/Harris too.
That's not why we can't elect progressives. Are you going to vote for Biden/Harris in November? If the answer is yes you've found out why we can't elect progressives. Until we withhold our votes for centrist hacks that's all we'll continue to get. #DownBallot
Biden is a pedophile, Trump is too. That's why I don't support either, because I have morals.
Plenty of reasons to hate Biden and Harris, but there are just as many equally valid reasons to hate Trump. You just can't vote with a good conscience in the US. After the pandemic response and the response to protests, I can't even fathom voting Trump though.
So neither Biden nor Trump then lol
Fundamentally I don’t want to live in an America post four more years of trump. I KNOW this. do I want to live in America after four years of Biden? I don’t know. But I want to avoid the other possiblity so hard that I’m unfortunately willing to eat some shit.
There's folks on my twitter feed who are just really pissy about the DNC and Biden and Harris.  I get not being happy with your 4th choice or whatever, but at THIS stage of the game, we should be focusing on beating Trump.  Nothing else matters if he steals this election. Nothing

I wasn’t happy with Biden, so no.
Every candidate gets negative coverage. Especially front runners.  That’s not something only Bernie faced. Biden’s coverage had basically the same positive/negative ratio.
It wasn’t sabotage when AOC, Tlaib, and Omar endorsed, raised money for, and campaigned for Bernie in October.  It wasn’t sabotage when other Dems did the same for Biden.  That’s how elections work; people try to elect their preferred candidates.
I already knew I wasn’t voting for Biden. Harris doesn’t change that. I’ll be leaving my ballot blank in regards to POTUS. When the electoral college is gone, maybe then I won’t. Fk this two party system.
Some people tried to make the case that Bernie was unelectable. Some people tried to make the case that Biden was unelectable. Some people tried to make the case that Warren was unelectable. Etc...  Every candidate faces criticism. Only in BernWorld is it a conspiracy.
The former primary rivals will appear at a high school near Biden's Delaware home to discuss their shared vision.

By 11/3/2020 he’ll still pull the lever for Biden/Harris. It’s about careerism not ideology.
Lol bruh this shits in your face... endorsing biden and harris... hillary all over again yall dipshits say “anybody but trump” WAKE THE FUCK UP or yall will be enslaved bu these satanic fucks
That's one hell of a dynamic duo they got there. Biden can make crime legislation that targets black Americans, and Harris will lock em up! Minority voters need to dump their abusive boyfriend, the DNC.  Stop letting them exploit you.
I’m voting biden only because I want trump out of office. Bernie would be my ideal candidate but it’s 2020 the year of being shit on so.
There is some delegate shuffling at state conventions months after candidates drop out. But, no, Biden’s lead after 3/17 is before any of that happend. He had an insurmountable lead from delegates he’d earned.
Lots of primary to go after SC and still anyone’s game.  But after ST, and 3/10, and 3/17 less than half the primary was left and Biden had an insurmountable lead.  It was clearly over.
Kamala is a cop. Pete is a rat. Warren is a snake. Beto is in the pocket of Big Oil. Biden is a rapist with dementia. All of that came out of Bernie’s campaign.  Sure... Bernie never attacked anyone. Uh huh.
I bet $50 that Biden drops out and hands it over to Harris. The ploy to not have debates won’t get support. They’d rather have Harris debate Trump than keep up this farce that Biden isn’t senile.
It wasn’t “interference” when Tlaib, AOC, and Omar endorsed Bernie in October. It wasn’t “interference” when other Dems endorsed Biden in Feb.  People advocated and voted for who they wanted, it wasn’t Bernie.  And Bernie had clearly already lost pre-pandemic.
Kamala was also really nasty to Joe Biden during the debates but they got over that shit because being tenacious and informed turned out to be positive qualities and we have an authoritarian to oust.
Super Tuesday was the last point the primary was even remotely competative. After that it was just a Biden landslide.  If Bernie was going to win he had to do it on ST. He didn’t.
Biden picking Harris is more evidence he’s not in control of his own campaign. I doubt he ever was. He is a means to an end of bypassing democratic institutions while ensuring most people feel like their vote was counted
As I recall, Biden took some hard swings at Barack Obama in the debates. Obama chose him as a veep. Team of Rivals playbook.
Call me a racist if you want, but after the corruption of the first black democrat president, there is no way I’m going to vote for the second.   (because Biden is nothing but a placeholder for who the real president will be)
Don't you want to see Biden wipe the floor with Trump?
She and Biden are the antithesis of your ridiculous #defundpolice movement. Once again the Democrats will alienate their own voting base and lose. You learned nothing from the 2016 election.

Donald Trump Issues Statement About Joe Biden and Kamala Harris  via
Basically at this point I’m hoping Biden/Harris wins, get held massively accountable to promises by everyone, and in 4 years Bernie or AOC or Yang or SOMEONE good contests them and wins in the primary and we go from “lesser of two evils” to an actual for the people good candidate
I think instead of Bring Back Better, Biden’s branding statement should be: Fighting for the Soul of America.  More inspirational to me.
As I said early on, if the protesters didn't take the fight to the convention and moved to have Biden replaced would be same old same old and nothing will happen. Now with Harris as VP the chances of any meaningful change are even less likely.
Vote Blue no matter who people don’t get to complain when Biden inevitably starts saying and doing racist shit when he hypothetically is in office. We’ve been telling you that since day fucking one. But you refused to listen and fucked everyone over.
The democratic party doesn't believe that. They never have. After all, if a black person doesn't vote for Joe Biden and his non-black VP well, in his own words, "You ain't black!".
She has one point ... Harris is better than Biden. But, then again, that's not saying much. This is it. If progressives don't withhold their votes now, we will not have a progressive ticket for the next 50 years.
No problem with Biden wanting more money for cops and Harris as his VP ... things will be fine.
That’s not how the nomination works.  Delegates are bound, they can’t change their mind and support someone else. Biden has the majority so he’ll be the nominee.  If he got eaten by wolves or something it’s still not Miss America where the runner up takes over.
For some reason I find it hard to believe a member of the "Biden could literally pick a ham sandwich for VP and I'd still vote for him" crowd was being hyperbolic when he said a Biden-Hitler ticket would be better than Trump.
Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
Biden's VP pick: Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots
Pete won Iowa. Pete and Bernie tied in NH. Biden won SC.  Of the early states, Bernie’s only clear win was Nevada.
Yes, Rosa Parks would definitely love the woman who called Biden a racist for opposing busing then walked back her comments saying "it was a debate" and is now his running mate.
I think it's too early to be concerned about 2024. My concern is this November first. While not everyone's idea of the best ticket,  Biden won fairly. Harris is a solid vp pick. Not 'bullying ' to me. Let's vote blue, get on a better track, go from there.
You need to understand we are voting for a part of a bigger picture. Voting for biden is a vote for a dem majority. Dem supreme court justices. You may not love them but they are great candidates to swing middle and some reps for a dem vote and that means groundbreaking
I’m not super jazzed but in all fairness if Biden picked a leftist running mate, my first thought would have been “I guess that person is more establishment than I thought,” not “I guess Joe’s ready to listen to us.”
I believe #KamalaHarris is a very strong #VP pick. I want them to win.  But it also seems true to me that neither #Biden nor #Harris seem committed to structural changes that will prevent us from being in this exact same situation in 4, 8, 12, and/or 16 years.
Liberals: vote Biden or you're a racist, greedy capitalist  Conservatives: vote Trump or you're a lawless communist  Libertarians: stop voting for the 2 parties...we love you, whatever you want, just put us in power  Me: I'm not a communist and I hate pandering... 🤔🤔
Good luck with that Harris character...she is a liability to anyone...actually I'm glad Biden chose her...she'll drag the ticket down and that is good...now---celebrate democrats...
Because Democrats wanted Joe Biden as the nominee? And just because Harris wasn’t doesn’t mean she won’t make a great VP.   See? Fucking stupid question.   You guys got nothing. It so funny 😆
How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: Inside the history-making VP pick
Warren voters were basically split between Biden/Bernie as 2nd choice. Had Warren dropped before ST it wouldn't have changed the overall result in any state and would have only gotten Bernie about another 10 delegates.  Bernie did worse once she did drop.
Warren was presenting herself as a compromise between Biden/Bernie. It made sense for her to stick around long enough for the race to get down to basically the 3 of them and see how it went.  That happened on Super Tuesday. It didn't go well for her. So she dropped afterwards.
I can’t be the only one that sees Bette from “The L Word” whenever I see posts about Kamala Harris, right? On a related note: Biden/Harris 2020.
Joe Biden couldn’t wait to find out who he picked for Vice President!
To be clear: Biden himself said he was selecting his running mate based on skin pigment and XX chromosomes. Period.
You are SO DESPERATE. PROUDLY WILL VOTE FOR BIDEN-HARRIS. IF I HAVE TO CRAWL THROUGH BROKEN GLASS. BUT YOU WOULD LOVE THAT.
All my black American Brothers and sisters I suggest you look and read the congressional records from 1974 , Joe Biden easy and purely is a racist . Trust me read them than today’s remarks come into View perfectly. “ You ain’t black unless you vote for me “ Joes heart is racist.
Joe Biden got bullied into choosing Kamala Harris.  Just the type of guy you want to run your country...
That's exactly what you should do: fight. Voting for Biden is in no way fighting though.  Go join the protests.
It doesn't have a chance with Biden in power. It's a lose-lose.   And even if it did I don't vote for fucking war criminals or cops.
That's censorship. Not a good strategy. Plus, Trump and his base will find new nicknames and allegations, regardless.  Biden just needs to roll with whatever cheap shots are thrown, and keep focused on what he knows he can do.
Civilian Bomber? See your thinking is the Problem in this world. Labeling people that have done no harm. Then you equal that harm with a Person like #Trump and make people believe everyone is that “same” evil that Trump is. #Biden is no #Trump, not even close.
Joe Biden announced Tuesday afternoon he selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.
I know Biden is bad too but hes not as bad as trmp and like literally thats all that matters
Calling Biden a racial segregationist and saying that she believes his accusers. Now they're best friends everyone...
Exactly this is the worst ticket in my adult life. Biden is the elephant in the room but wtf does Kamala bring (all the Blacks that didn't vote for her in the primary)? It remains to be seen how many people will or will not fall in line. Count me out.
You're assuming Biden will win despite him doing everything in his power to lose voters -that makes it quite uncertain.
Hey, Father, my Irish-Catholic mother made sure I was baptised, confirmed and educated in Catholic schools for 12 years. You insult Joe Biden's Catholic faith and you ignored pedophile priests. All I can say is Go fauck yourself
claim Trump is a dictator. Claim trump will cheat or won't leave office if he loses. Set Democrats up to fail with Biden/Harris. While media claims they will win. Nov. 5th Civil unrest after Trump re election.
And she's going to be the next Vice-President of these United States. She and President Biden will have their hands full undoing all the damage to this country that you and your fellow Republican senators have aided and abetted these past four horrifying years.
Women will vote just be Because she is a women. How shallow you are to think women just vote and don’t use intelligence to pick their candidate.  I will not vote for either Biden or Kamala. #Trump2020!
Good example of socialism, vote joe Biden in the country will be Portland
We had Bush hand over the Great Recession to Obama. Should Biden win, he would be handed an even worse situation. Given the trend, how can we reasonably hand the Presidency over to the GOP anytime soon?
Biden wins in November, he either dies or resigns bc dementia, and she becomes our first woman president
But you don't follow me. I follow you. Biden/Harris will be the last vote I cast for the Democrats. I already left the party to start building a Progressive Party. I waited 40+ years to vote for someone like Bernie. I'm tired of being a disappointed Democrat.
Kamala Harris absolutely trashed Biden during the Democratic primaries and now they're linked up for President/VP.  What a bizarre pick but sometimes politics doesn't make any sense haha!
That debate moment narrowed it for me.  Biden and Harris proved who they are is and I am positive that they will take no prisoners till 11/3.  That said, all the women considered are, hands down, the gold standard for not only VP,  but Pres as well.  Sincere respect for all!

That was just awful.  Biden will never be President . Don't know what drugs they have him on or sadly if that's just him  but I would be more inspired watching paint dry. And it looks like they put a stopper in her. BORING.

#meghanmccain what are your thoughts on Kamala Harris being selected as Biden's VP?
Biden blew Bidens chances all by himself,now Harris really crucified him. Lol
Hate to tell ya but Russia would prefer Biden as well. All it takes is just a little brains and keeping up on politics to figure it out.

You past it because of Joe Biden. Don’t liewants to tax you if you decide to leave California cause the democrats want to take your police away keep raising taxes , keep you shut down . People of California you need to shut this down . This will be what Joe Biden will do as president. This is completely illegl
If he gets any traction  then 'they' can say he is a Biden/Harris vote siphon.
America vote Joe Biden this will be everywhere . There will be disbanded police departments than Joe will get and take away guns . This people will next go to the suburbs cause eventually there will be nothing left in the city to loot or burn . Suburban mothers kids won’t be safe
all over the country people can’t express they are voting for  cause of attacks . The polls are wrong guaranteed most republicans or conservatives we don’t do polls and Trump has polled good ever . I’ve been across the country, no Biden signs no where
My promise: if my area does start mass mailing ballots, I’m going to gather as many as possible and send them all back for Trump.   No one will ever know I frauded Biden and I’m ok with that! Whatever it takes!
omg why has'nt biden droped out of the primary yet he literallt can't win

can you please tell AG Barr that we deserve to know before the election the results of the Durham investigation, the democrat nominee was in the administration who did the spying and knew . People shouldn’t be voting not knowing Biden’s Role and what cabinet where .

Let’s be real here. Biden is 77 years old. We all know what her being picked for VP means and how important it was.   She more than likely will be the first woman President, whether by happenstance or running in 2024. Biden has said he’s going to be the “transitional” President.

So crazy that Biden is the nominee... 🤪😷🤪😷. Seriously the world has gone mad.

That's one hell of a dynamic duo they got there. Biden can make crime legislation that targets black Americans, and Harris will lock em up! Minority voters need to dump their abusive boyfriend, the DNC.  Stop letting them exploit you.
Call me a racist if you want, but after the corruption of the first black democrat president, there is no way I’m going to vote for the second.   (because Biden is nothing but a placeholder for who the real president will be)

Who cares.   It’s Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris. Tell her to choose wisely.

Well put Brit. I do believe it was time for a man just like President Trump. Our Nation was a Patsy for China, our Allies, including NATO. Some of our Politicians, such Biden, Clinton etc we’re benefiting from our Largess with others.
And finally.... After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.  And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?). Next, she ends her pathetic run at President. Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
Kamala Harris was the perfect pic for joe Biden, love it
People accusing me of being “Pro-Trump” because I shared a meme stating that both Trump and Biden are pedophiles says it all really.

In 2008 Obama had zero foreign relations experience. Put Harris on the ticket for VP as the more ticket-friendly option, and Rice as SOS after Biden is elected. Done.
And nobody would need to. With Rice it's Game over. Knowing what I was getting with Biden (a trainwreck, but no worse than Trump) as an independent I was holding out for Biden's pick.  With Rice I was out.  With Harris, I'm in.  I'm now in.
Great choice Joe.
Even we independents see Rice as the original Benghazi liar-face. Some GOP said they wanted her ... BECAUSE she was unwinnable. Were you even around in Nov 2016? Remember what happened? Don't get cocky when Biden's numbers are up. You need us.

Stay the course. Harris helps ensure large voting blocks go with Biden. If the goal is to rid ourselves of Trump, a powerful voting block on the other side is needed.  A stanch progressive one heart beat away still doesn't scare me as much as Trump.
So while I must agree with, Ms Harris is a great woman, COLOR does not effing matter, but one thing, a helluva hypocrite!!! How can she forget all the truths she said about Biden during the debates, throw them under the rug, SERIOUS character flaws we are talking, take weeks
I don’t think Biden will have the same taste as trump. It should definitely wait a couple years. Bad timing. People losing homes and trump wants to remodel a place he won’t be living. Stupid

First of all  is doing some incredible reporting but it's depressing as hell. Trump is using the power of the US government to steal a 2nd term using the same tactics &amp; zeal of an authoritarian.   the answer can't just be "vote". Get more aggressive.
Easy, stop testing, no reported cases. Just like Obama/Biden did with H1N1 let people die, then stop testing so your numbers don't go up
Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists. He fought for their cause in schools, experts say.  via
Republicans don't understand that Democrats don't even like Biden either lol. We know Trump's gonna get reelected. He's running against an even bigger idiot 🤦🏾‍♂
Oh sweetheart, Joe Biden is not the President yet.  And the bill was far from clean! It included funding for an FBI, planes and other non Covid related garbage. Mitchie said it was DOA in May! GOP wanted 200.00, they wanted what was right. We know the truth...not your lies...
How many D voters will Obama (I mean Biden) lose by not picking Harris? How many R voters? How many swing voters? Obama's going to be 110% behind the VP pick. Who's going to go against Obama? Cmon man. ;-)

Senators Ron Johnson, Lindsey Graham, and Chuck Grassley are all working actively to spread Russian propaganda through the Senate against Joe Biden.  They should ALL resign NOW.  PASS IT ON.
The Russians are sending false documents to senators Johnson and Graham to denegrate VP Joe Biden to get trump re elected. The gop senate are actively accepting these documents  and using them. The GOP senate is in bed with Putin

Probably going to play Covid relief hero now that  blocked the bill! Ready for blame game, and Dem, Biden bashing!
Joe Biden is denigrating his own candidacy very well all by himself.
Since Biden will be elected, we are certainly willing to move all you trump voters out of the country. Russia or China are probably the only countries that will take you though. Bon Voyage.
And you are not worthy of the Christian vote or any votes at all. How dare you, a heathen in word and deed, say Biden is against God. He is a true believer and you have said yourself you've never asked for forgiveness. You won't get it either.
WhooptiFriggindo  #NeverTrumpers   A No Vote for Trump is a Vote for Biden.   Republicans that don't vote elect democrats
Seeing the DNC and Biden waste money in TX is glorious!Nope. I won't vote for creeps and keep us trapped in a garbage cycle. We *should* have multiple options. Both Trump and Biden are horrible and responsible for policy that has killed many. Neither is better.
And if you believe the democratic party with Biden and Harris are going to fix the corruption, you are fooling yourself.
I wouldn't be surprised if Idaho does. I expect both Trump and Biden to improve on the Trump/Clinton numbers. (The third party vote was about 13% in 2016.) If I had to guess Trump gets more of that 13% than Biden.
Biden/Harris is just as bad as Trump/Pence. The only way to bring change to our country, is to change the people we vote for. The only candidate good enough for us is   #BidenIsARacist #TrumpIsARacist #JorgensenCohen2020 #Elections2020
Yep Biden should answer all questions Trump is asked in the way he would if he were president.
Not to mention Biden has literally said marriage is between a man and a woman, so really if you’re pro-black and pro-LGBTQ, voting for Biden/Harris makes no sense. #JorgensenCohen2020 #JoJorgensen #VoteGold2020
I hope Biden does what he can to fix these hole to prevent it from happening again.
Biden will never be President and neither will you. No matter what the vote tally ends up being.
Imagine being a leftist agonizing over whether to vote for Biden thinking your vote actually matters
You would have voted for a Biden/Gabbard ticket? Why?
👏👏👏 Not if but when Biden brings science back!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Imagine being excited about a Biden Harris ticket lololol
Do you think Trump has the ability to leave a helpful transition letter for Biden?  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
The tone from these people shifted from triumph to weird hostility to the left on a dime. Almost like they're worried.  Biden won't win my vote unless at the minimum he endorses #MedicareForAll. This is a political game of chicken. I'm not swerving.
The thing is Ron, I am an idiot - but I still won't vote for Biden/Harris.  So ... can you go below idiot?
Bumbling Joe Biden can't do that, even though she really isn't black (she's half Indian and half Jamaican). He needs a black running mate, so that makes her black enough for his purposes. She's black enough to pass.
Joe Biden is an excommunicated Catholic. Just putting that out there. He and Trump have both put ideology over the Divine.
I’ve been told that my vote for  is a vote for Trump. I’ve also been told it’s a vote for Biden.   Guess I’m voting for 3 people this election.
That’s not all I’m interested in but the Dems and Republicans are fighting over them as if they aren’t people.  Not to mention Biden even said if you’re black and don’t vote for him, you’re not black.
I think that during the first debate Biden should spill out any dirt or proof against Trumps falsehoods all over the table. It would disarm Trump right from the get go. Kamala should do it as well.   leave them nothing!!!!
And if they manage to do so, I have no faith that anything will change.  Why?  Because Biden pretty much said so.
Can't wait to see Biden's expression when he finds out Kamala is his VP pick!
Dumb.. she’s a hypocrite. For sure now I’m not voting for Biden. What she did as a prosecutor in Cali is despicable. Check out Katie. I respect you and your ethics👍🏻
There are a couple nuggets of truth in this that are pretty devastating: the fact that Harris owned Biden in that debate ("I was that girl") and the fact that she didn't dare stay in the race because she knew she'd get shellacked in her home state by Bernie
Yeah.... Between Biden/Cop Kamala and the Great Orange Cheeto, definitely voting third party... We've got #batmaam. #JoJorgensen2020
Anyone that was on the fence about Biden, but now will for sure with Kamala?
With what?  A choice between Trump or Biden?  No thanks.  Maybe if Jesse Ventura were on the ballot ... but it looks like they're making sure that ain't happening.
#BREAKING: Joe Biden has named Kamala Harris as his running mate.  #Biden #Harris #election2020
So taking into account Biden's chances of dying in office, and him now having a running mate, you have three options:
Joe Biden has a running mate.
I can handle a Biden/Harris ticket. Bring on the debates!
I congratulate the future President Kamala Harris on becoming Joe Biden's VP pick.
Definitely not voting Biden now 🤦🏻‍♂️
Yes yes yes!!!!! I love Biden’s pick!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏♥️
Yes!! I also hope and pray that Biden and Congress work on fixing all the holes that allowed Trump and his goons to pull the shit that they have.
Hey Republicans you really screwed us in 2016 by nominating Trump!!! Please think of America this time and Vote Biden so we can begin to repair the damage!!!!! #EvictTrump #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I agree! I could dislike Biden, but I would still vote for him!
corruption of the DNC, and going along with the Joe McCarthyism, they would have at least let you join in on their lobbyist bought convention with gropey Joe dementia Biden.  But I guess not.
I would vote Biden every damn day until #EvictionTrump is out of office if I could!!
Most likely scenario is Biden is shaping up his cabinet (perhaps prematurely), offering Mayo Pete SecDef or SecState.
IM WITH YOU 100%! Biden definitely couldn't pick anyone worse than Trump or Pence.
😂😂Biden knows his history and isn't stupid unlike our current #DictatorTrump.
Pete Buttigieg is not going to be Biden's VP pick. It will be a woman. Mark my words.
Well, on fourth of july,  professor Plum said,  Joe Biden, in the basement,  with the chew toy! #Clue
I would vote Biden, but (Clutching my pearls) I would be "very disappointed."
I will support Biden no matter who he chooses. I just hope he has picked someone that will bring the skeptics on board.❤
Did Biden see his shadow and it’s 4 more years of the great President Trump?
I dont believe thAt was biden. #Lookalike
Trump being bad, doesn't make Biden good.  What are we, in kindergarten?
Biden and Obama
I would vote for Biden every single day until he was in office if I could!!!! #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Welp, Nancy,  a russian kid made a cartoon of biden on facebook. And a russian bot posted your face on twitter that said cryptkeeper.
This should be how we trumpet every poll result:  BREAKING:  New polls out this week show that Joe Biden is not far enough ahead!  Not. F*cking. Far. Enough!
I hope more of his major donors wake up!!! It would be even better if they start donating to Biden.
Biden should show us how he would give the speeches as president. He can then provide truth instead 9f propaganda.

Biden wouldn't be a puppet to Putin!

Biden still plans to win the 1960 race.

Biden is planning an executive order tomorrow!
Hey dingus:  Biden has accepted the debate schedule. Trump has not.  Why do you lie?
Joe Biden forms better sentences than Donald J Trump. Biden is also intelligent and not a con man out for every available quick buck like Donald #TrumpIsLosing #DonaldTrumpIsAPedo #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie
What Biden is experiencing is devastating. And it's shameful that the Democrat Party has propped him up in a position where his decline is also so public and embarrassing. Like him or not, a man who has served this country for decades deserves better than to be in his position.
Yes! I want to see Chasten and Pete both be a part of the Biden administration!!!!!
Uhhh....In 90 days trump will still be president. He will still have the authority to do this in 90 days even if Biden wins the election...

Biden is far from being radical left!!
I feel the same way. I will vote Biden no matter what. I do hope he picks someone that can bring the skeptics on board though.
👏👏 I know right!!! Democrats are some really powerful people. Biden has the power to hurt God plus democrats can create a virus? WOW! If we are that powerful then why don't we just throw the traitor out of office?
I was asked to justify Biden's qualifications.  It was a moronic and bad faith question. I don't care if you think you should be able to demand an answer when the alternative is a sh!tweasel like Trump.
I *wouldn't* sell Biden under your stipulation.  Do you not understand the very simple difference?  Or is dishonesty your only tactic?
I don't give a shit what you expect. That has nothing to do with Biden.  You really don't think well.
Biden is way more Republican than Trump!!!

For sure! I’m right there with you. Though, I think Harris will turn out to be a good choice. Originally early on, I thought Biden would go for Klobuchar which KH is a way better choice than her at least. 😂
Honestly, I think it came down to a lot of factors such as experience, age, and political leanings. Biden gets hit on a lot about his age and so getting someone who is subtantially younger was key.
It's going to be up to us to keep our foot on the gas pedal. It's going to be up to us to make sure that Biden / Harris is the bridge to a better world. We must be more active now than ever before. #1u #UnionStrong

Biden’s VP choice was based on immutable characteristics of sex and race, and the lowest level of expediency. Unfortunately, I worry such decision-criteria would characterize his Presidency. More identity politics is the last thing America needs in 2020.
Chameleon Kamala will change her previous views at the drop of a hat, if it means moving forward into the limelight, where she can throw her weight around and snap her fingers at her underlings.  She will definitely be wearing the pants in her relationship with Sleepy Joe Biden.

Why do all of the Talking Heads say Biden is trying to decide on things? Biden hadn’t made a decision in years!  Every decision made is from people around him, he’s not capable of picking out his own breakfast let alone the Vice President!
It's the great transition from everything being racist to everything being sexist the moment Biden chooses his running mate.

I think this is more closer to correct than not. More and more I get the feeling that Biden is just a stand-in for the next Uber-progressive president, who will slide in there when Biden is carted off to the nursing home basement for the final goodbye.
The problem for the Democrats this fall is that activities in Portland auger for the same activities on a more widespread basis if a Biden presidency comes to fruition.   We’ve got to keep the Democrats OUT! Their philosophy is death and destruction. Biden can’t escape the truth.
No you wanna scratch the debates cause we both know Biden can’t string together a coherent sentence.
National Archives would have her complaint, why can't that be released, if with Biden wanting it
Yeah Joe Biden why haven’t you called for assistance from the Democrats out loud and in public. Write it down for so you don’t screw it up
If Biden wasn't a shitty candidate, he wouldn't be having such a hard time at getting people to support him. And yet, that's what's going on
No he isn't LMFAO what's so wrong with wanting Biden to actually earn his votes? Really? What's wrong with a politician earning the votes they get?
If you don't see the blatant equivalencies between Biden and Trump, you need to get your head out of your ass, wipe the shit off your face and see the world how it really is, not some delusional 'democrats will solve everything' nonsense when they played into this, enabling trump
No it's not, Biden is actually why we have Trump, he helped pave the way
I don't support Biden 😂 and no you can't because Donald Trump is a racist lmao
'the black American I know' lmao they have every right to be upset with what Biden said, but don't think Trump isn't racist and that they don't see it, too.
I think Joe Biden owes quite a few un-notable and notable exceptions a reparations beer.😆
Wrong again Chris. Why should Biden get a pass on people getting to judge him by allowing them to vote before they even see him debate? And if you believe current polls you are not of any use as a "journalist".
It was easy for me to decide not to vote for Trump in either 2016 or 2020.  Voting for Clinton or Biden too great a rejection of pro life values and, while neither party exercises fiscal policy discipline, the Dems offered, in my judgment, even less hope of that. Issue, not party
Or they just decided that Biden would do even more damage than Trump.
Put dementia and foot in mouth disease together and this is what you get! Doddering uncle Joe Biden.
