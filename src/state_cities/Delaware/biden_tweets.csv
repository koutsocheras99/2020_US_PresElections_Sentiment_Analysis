Joe Biden launches new national ad aimed at Black¬†Americans
So where‚Äôs all the Biden flags in this Delaware marina ..the White Marlin open is this week and not one Biden  flag to be seen ..but the Trump flags dominate ..poor unc Joe still no respect in his state ..
I am just as right about Biden being a bumbling Idiot as I was about Simmons not being able to play. That would make me 2 for 2.
I wasnt angry at all . You made dumb statement that debates will have no influence.  Of course they will .  Biden has been a politician his whole life . A debate should be easy for him. But because Dems dont even like their own candidate they dont want him exposed.
If Dems see Biden not be able to complete a sentence in a debate it could definitely change some people's minds and influence the election . I still hold out some hope that some Dems may  have common sense. But after watching their behavior since the night Trump  won maybe not.
We need you and Joe Biden.
A small percentage could be the difference in election. If they want Biden to represent the country as president he needs to show  people he mentally can do so or they need to find another candidate. .
So Biden has told the truth his whole 40 plus years in politics?? The whole previous administration is the most corrupt to ever hold office. So stop with the lying digs at Trump. Their has never not been debates for presidential elections. Why should Biden get a pass.
It's Biden ducking the debates, not Trump. Dems are terrified how Biden will crash and burn if he came out of his basement and actually had to talk unscripted and without his handlers
They are hoping that he will take the black vote away from Biden.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Joe Biden and I approve this message.‚Äù (In 15 minutes I may not remember this message or know even what State I‚Äôm in, but I now approve this message that my handlers just put up on a teleprompter for me).
Because they know that trump is going to suck against Biden
Nobody holds up a 7-11 or shoots children in the streets of Chicago with assault rifles or other weapons of war. All Joe Biden is reminding us is that as a Senator and again as VP, he did nothing to stop the killings in the streets of our cities. Now he wants to defund police.
So, speaking of testing, when will Joe Biden stop refusing to have his mental acuity tested and reported to the American public?

Zero sum game.  There's no room in politics here for anything other than the total domination of your opponent.  Because we're a nation of enemies voting for the other is sacrilegious and wrong.  That's how people tie themselves up excusing Trump or Biden or amyone else.
I think Biden is a decent, empathetic man. I don‚Äôt expect FDR, just some decency. I no longer believe that America is exceptional, a world leader or that we have educated citizens. For now,  securing the nuclear codes is enough.
I‚Äôd vote for a pet rock over Trump. Biden is what we have. I‚Äôd crawl over broken glass to vote for Biden.
Joe Biden is Trump 2.0
If Joe Biden can‚Äôt debate he should be disqualified.

Biden has no need to debate "father." Biden hasn't had to shake-up his campaign because he's already got a nice lead. "Father" has had to replace his campaign manager and rework all of his advertising because his current campaign isn't working. It's too late for it to work anyway

What about the $1.5 Billion Hunter Biden came back from China with when his daddy took him on a Vice Presidential trip?
Biden can‚Äôt debate. His mind no longer works well enough for a debate. That‚Äôs why his supporters are calling for the debates to be canceled. How desperate must they be, to call for the debates to be canceled?

Biden will not be the candidate
MR Biden , my heart breaks for you.  The Deep State is pushing you in to give the race a sense of normalcy.  Watch, they will ask you to step down if you win in a year to allow the VP you choose to take your office.  Don‚Äôt step down if they do and stick it to them for betrayal.
How about the pallets of cash flown to Iran? How about Hunter Biden‚Äôs trip with Daddy to China from which he returned with $1.5 Billion? How about Barisma paying Hunter Biden $80K per month for nothing? How about Biden using US aid to squash corruption charges against Barisma?
And Joe Biden won‚Äôt enter office if elected, because his handlers will invoke the 25th Amendment and inaugurate his VP-elect. If his VP-elect has the last name Obama or Clinton, it will confirm for sure, that‚Äôs the plan.
Joe Biden America needs you
If they do, its over for Biden. Fucking hilarious the  chose Biden for their candidate. Sad these are our 2 choices....
Biden is a coward. He knows Trump would wipe the floor with him.
Biden‚Äôs controllers are maneuvering to cancel the Presidential debates. Once that happens, Biden will be sitting and dozing, waiting for the Presidency to come to him.
I also recommend that Biden refuse to engage with Trump at all until he releases his tax returns.
Biden has his allies publicly floating the ifea that he shouldn‚Äôt debate Trump, to see if the voters would let him get away with it.  Why not? He‚Äôs already geting away with hiding in his basement and no press conferences. Hidin‚Äô Biden.  Ah, what a President he would be.
No, the loss of 150,000 + Americans is on China and on whoever it was who closed down our national pandemic office (Obama and Biden). It‚Äôs a slimy political tactic to blame Trump and shield China, Obama and Biden. It‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs relentless hard work that prevented 1 Million deaths.
I can say this much see Joe Biden on TV with black mask on his face as well like he show dose number on TV they don't lie  remember Donald Trump's go in   he was talking about building wall up for people from Mexico ask that question to your self I'm not taking side on this
Every one point out think Joe Biden   basic talk Abt black people race if that was case he also was obma person in white house isn't odoma black as well just think about that one every one else in America he also near Michelle odoma as well I don't think he judge by skin color

It = the loss of 150,000 + Americans   Caused by China, exacerbated by the Obama-Biden administration, and kept from becoming 500,000 only by Trump‚Äôs endless commitment and hard work.
The mainstream media have assured us that the Antifa folks are peaceful protestors.  But we saw the arsons, the shootings, the lootings, the Molotov cocktails, the brutal attacks. Who are you going to believe? The mainstream media and Joe Biden, or your lying eyes?
So where are Antifa‚Äôs loyalties? By burning Bibles and American flags, they themselves proclaim that they have no loyalty either to God or to the United States. Some may feel they are evil. Biden doesn‚Äôt.
Ocasio Cortez stands for what the Democrat Party has become. She‚Äôs for Biden and Biden supports her and her Green New Deal. Is there anything more we need to know?
But wasn‚Äôt it the Obama-Biden administration that closed down the pandemic office? And allowed our national inventory of PPE masks and gowns to fall to near zero levels?  Sure, blame it on Trump.

"We" lose either way. It actually will be worse for "us" if Biden wins. Everyone goes back to ignoring us and having no problem with police killing us just like the 8 years Obama was president. Every other group will get policies to help them but us. Benign neglect will return.
I'm waiting for the Biden interview next...
cuz that girl hates Trump so she will vote for Biden !!! its like a trend with these young know it all kids these days.and sadly they are the ones that going to suffer the most if Trump looses
Imagine Biden and god getting into the octagon
Biden is moderate.. nice try at this angle: not working however
So, if Biden can hurt God, maybe he can also get rid of the pandemic!
Trump Joe Biden is going to blow you out of the ocean and blow you right in the jail because he‚Äôs gonna be the next president of this country God bless USA Joe Biden will be the next president number 46.
I see Biden‚Äôs gaffe / regurgitation of wrong received wisdom on African Americans was immediately overshadowed (in my bubble) by Trump claiming Biden would hurt God.
Trump is scared that Biden gets sworn in at noon and before he gets to Marine one he gets arrested seconds after becoming former President. If lucky he will have family arrested with him so he won't do an Epstein
Kaya - Looking forward to Trump v Biden....a total mismatch.  Like a NFL team playing a high school team.  No odds on this one in Vegas!
today‚Äôs my wife‚Äôs 84th birthday so i decided to bake her a cake (and by cake i mean vote for joe biden)
Joe Biden didn't crash the economy with a moronic trade war, we were on our way to down even before the pandemic. He was already using emergency resources for the soybean farmers he bankrupted.
As a person who lived in Wilmington DE and knows what everyone else in this area knows, Joe Biden did in fact mean to insult black people.  As is his racist nature.  No one in this area likes him.
The response was to mock the guy because the answer is so blatantly obvious you have to be a joke of a person not to understand how Joe Biden could be and is a war criminal. Did the arming of terrorists and civilian bombings mean literally nothing to yall...
Joe Biden doesn't need to brag about passing a cognitive test that's only designed to check for dementia. Demented Trump will only be our president for a few more months and then Awake Joe will right this ship.
Thank you to everyone commenting on this about how much they love Barr. This will make it so much easier for us in Antifa to sweep you all into prison, once President Biden gives us the go ahead. Your jail cells await you.
You needed to click my link. The most recent Q poll was in there with Biden up 15 in Maine. There r other polls factored in with the Q as well
Joe Biden want to take your Oxygen away, he wants to take away your cars. He‚Äôs hell bent on getting rid of the Sun !!! it‚Äôs true i‚Äôve heard people say! He also want your TVs removed.
She can't be Trump for one day. All these Democrats are used to softball questions from the press. They don't know how to handle the hard questions.  It's not only Pelosi who acts like this. They all do.  Look at Biden for Christ sake!
Wow...  is there no minority biden won't insult?!
Biden knows how to hold a bible.
Any woman Biden picks for his VP will be 1000% better than mike pence!
I agree.  This election is a choice between America or trump.  It must be Joe Biden.  Period.
I keep picturing Biden as The Saint of Killers.
Let me look outside.....  nope President Obama or VP Biden are not here to take my guns..... still!   Trump took money find iderctly from Russia through the NRA.
biden but he's in an anime with a squad trying to kill god
Next he‚Äôs going claim Biden hates his grandma.
Oh right. Then there was Obama at a state funeral for a black civil rights leader delivering a campaign speech for sleepy Joe Biden. You hypocrite.
The reason Wall Street continues to set records some 85 days from the election is because they ALREADY KNOW Trump will win.  The market is a very accurate forward looking indicator with some of the smartest people in the US.  A Biden win would crater the market.
Not much of a God if Joe Biden can do him/her/it harm
JOE BIDEN ACTUALLY JUST IMPLIED THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE ALL THE SAME AND YALL GONNA VOTE FOR THAT ???
What the hell is he talking about?  Biden isn't for any one of those things.  "Our kind of energy".  Common man, are you an addict?
Any person that tries to tell me to vote for Biden is getting slapped. And if you‚Äôre white you‚Äôre getting slapped twice I don‚Äôt make the rules.
Most of us know that VP Biden is a life long, devout Roman Catholic. And if you didn't know it before his son's tragic death, you know it now. This was possibly one of the most despicable things Trump has said yet. He should seek God's forgiveness.
Top Democrats contemplate civil war if Biden loses
Look at the GOP.  We should all remember this for years and years... They have a complete failure in the White House. He‚Äôs done nothing, 160,900 dead Americans.  Millions infected with possible long term effects. A toothless travel ban, tax evasion.  The GOP? ‚Äúlet‚Äôs lie on Biden‚Äù
When Biden said the line about if an African American votes for Trump ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù, it wasn‚Äôt a random weird set of words. He really thinks that.
I feel very badly for the good, common sense folks in Portland.  Your leaders are irresponsible and fundamentally unstable.  This is a national preview of a Biden win....totally insane and not grounded in reality.
But......Biden.  üôÑ
We really stuck between biden and trump to cap off 2020.
At least he agrees that Biden will be president.
I was ready to vote as soon as Biden became the nominee.
Angel: So God did you hear about Joe Biden? God: Of course I did. I am omnipresent. But...what did you hear? Just to make sure we are on the same page. Angel: Trump says Biden is going to "hurt God." I am pretty sure that's you. God: Oh Me! Angel: I know, right?
Let Trump win the toss up states here, who cares.  Biden still gets the electoral college win easy
Oh so you would rather have 4 more years of crooked Trump?? Trump lies and doesn‚Äôt give a damn about anyone but himself and the rich so don‚Äôt fool yourself! Biden is for everyone and that‚Äôs where my vote is going and I hope and pray everyone else‚Äôs is too!
All of those also describe 45. I‚Äôm not a big Biden guy, I agree he‚Äôs creepy, but he‚Äôs got a much more level head. Also he is about as right as a democrat can be, and he actually cares about common people. Trump does not give a fuck unless you‚Äôre rich, and that is not arguable
That would require logical thinking.  Trump supporters don't have that.  It ends with 'biden or God', thats the choice they hear.
I live in DE, it is well known that Biden is Catholic wtf is this joker talking about, he needs better opo.....
Great Jeff‚Äôs, now ask Biden what day it is.
What do you mean 'now?  He said 'conservatives would be hunted if biden wins', that was like a month or so ago.
Joe Biden is a fucking dumbass
For the mainstream media to back Biden they have officially abandoned all Independence and have confirmed their alliance with the Dems.  This has to be the case as any thinking person sees the horrific policies and mental affliction.  Total Propoganda!
I‚Äôm not the slightest bit religious, but what he said about Joe Biden and God was deeply offensive to me. Not to mention he sounded completely deranged saying it. Does his base actually believe stuff like that? And the press is busy worrying about a Biden gaffe now and then?!
Bashing Trump is a perfectly good reason for voting for Biden tho. What you‚Äôre saying is ‚ÄúWould you rather get punched in the arm or punched in the dick? If the arm, explain to me why without mentioning the dick‚Äù ... the reason I‚Äôm choosing the arm is because the dick is worse
I attend same Catholic Church as Biden does. He‚Äôs there every week (pre-Covid anyway), praying, going to Communion, then chatting with parishioners after Mass. He and Jimmy Carter are the most devout presidents we‚Äôve ever had. (I‚Äôm praying  will be president.)
It's great that guns are taken away. Hopefully Biden makes sure of that
Biden is senile and has dementia. Prove me wrong libs.    #bidenscognitivedecline
I'm waiting for the presser stating Biden will now hide all the Demon Sperm and Alien DNA.
Next is Biden hates puppies and babies.
there it is black folks!!! Biden thinks you guys are the same ... nothing special!!!
Mr. President-Did you or anyone else actually HEAR VP Biden say that. Or see it written by him somewhere?
I‚Äôm not,but my wife is Latina and I‚Äôm/We are still with Biden.
I‚Äôm still voting for Biden Mr Prez
And President Biden has never said "it is what it is" about over 150,000 DEAD people.  2/2
President Biden has never called white supremacists &amp; neo-nazis "very fine people." President Biden has never called for the death penalty for five innocent young men. President Biden has never said "I wish her well" when asked about an accused child sex trafficker.   1/2
Few instances that may arise? Have you read about how this is going to work? As Joe Biden would say "come on man!". My 9 yr. old son yesterday had a whole discussion with my neighbor about how it's possible. Common since goes along way.
Joe Bide's brain is toast!  Mr, President please stop calling him "sleepy Joe".  This denotes a harmless, docile old man.  Biden is far from harmless.  His policies will tank America.  He's a dangerous  baffoon...how about "Slippery Joe"!

I can‚Äôt get over the fact that Dems hate Trump so much but the best they could come up with to defeat him was Joe Biden. He‚Äôs SO BAD, like parody bad, that it feels like Dem establishment secretly want four more years of Trump to complain about.

Joe Biden Says That Black People All Think the Same 'With Some Notable Exceptions'
I hear Biden is so close to his VP pick he can smell her.
If Biden refuses to debate Trump, Trump should debate Jorgensen. This would benefit both Trump &amp; Jorgensen. It would show the anti-Trump crowd that they don't need to vote 4 Biden, thus splitting their votes &amp; helping Trump. The real loser would be Biden.
that man gets in there he will not be running this country Obama will be Joe Biden will just be a pretty picture he'll be a face that's all he'll be you do know that right
do these people realize I pray God wakes them up do they realize that they vote for Joe Biden or they rig the ballots so that Joe Biden wins it could mean everybody loses their freedom and I don't want that and I'm not alone
Former Vice President Biden would be the oldest elected President.
Remind me again which candidate doctors thought needed a test to detect dementia? Biden is doing just fine and will surround himself with competent people. Bunker boy, on the other hand, thought that test was hard what with having to remember 5 things directly in his line of site
Is Biden?
He is in no way anxious. They want to make stupid demands and make it look like Biden denied to debate. They talk a big game but they know that trump is not well.
Biden the dog! #TeamJoe #Biden2020 #Dogs4Biden
Inherited a Growing economy??? HAHAHA Biden your a funny guy. Doesn‚Äôt everyone remember 2008-2016? All the Job Loss, all the Home Foreclosures, all the Drug addiction. Trump came in and brought back jobs that Obama said would Never come back.
Joe Biden was a stunch supporter of Police for years until now.
If you vote Biden, well, you're already dead. #YouAintBlack
Because he's black, Biden concluded that blacks take drugs to enhance performance
Not likely, if his family cared anything about him that‚Äôs what would happen Jill Biden wants to be first lady so bad she‚Äôll just let him go on and make a damn full of himself and risk hisOverall health
As a Democrat, I welcome any Republician who is willing to vote Trump out and support Former Vice President Joe Biden.

Gaslighting someone is the ultimate fvck you &amp; arrogant to assume that if you don't vote, it's a vote for Trump. If not voting is a vote for Trump, then not voting is also a vote for Biden. Why is it exclusively a vote for Trump? Not voting is a vote for Biden, just as easily.

Addie my 7 year old said ‚ÄúJoe Biden, he‚Äôs so handsome‚Äù tonight.
Biden doesn't have to do anything. Your dad is hanging himself every single time he opens his mouth. The entire country hates him. Your party has been bleeding support for years. We all know your dad will cheat though, bc in a fair election it'd be a route.
I feel sorry for you. You have been conned by 45th President and his cronies or you have been paid off. The coronavirus is real and there is no scheme to rig anything. It‚Äôs time for America to get integrity, leadership, and empathy back with Joe Biden. #Biden2020
TRUMP YOU ARE THE SWAMP AND YOU WILL BE DRAINED! VOTE BIDEN 2020 TIME FOR YOU TO GO BACK TO NEW YORK AND FACE THE CHARGES! OBAMA DID NOTHING WRONG! BEST PRESIDENT EVER! JEALOUS?
Vote for Biden.
Control of the board is your Vice President Biden. Name a color. No, i'm sorry, "you ain't black" was not in the form of a question.
warning; this tweet offends trumpsters and biden fans... Can we get both President Trump and Sleepy Joe on a Celebrity Jeopardy? we wouldn't even need to write actual jokes.  They're actually on that cognitive level.
Biden doesn't even know where he is half the time.
Because I‚Äôm on Twitter, I know Trump has pulled out of PA ads, but it‚Äôs VERY different experience here in the Philly market from 2016 when it was wall to wall Hillary and Trump ads. Now it‚Äôs only Biden.
I know I tweet about this a lot but it continues to be wild that I‚Äôve been in the same room with governors and senators and representatives and Biden all by happenstance. I‚Äôve passed by my senators on the street. Nearly rear ended the leiutenant governor.
You are not Conservative, you are a Trumpster, very different. Trump had made a mockery of the Bible when he gassed protesters to hold a Bible upside down. Trump has never read the Bible once in his life and has only been in a Church in a faux rally. Biden = religious, Trump = no
Biden goes to mass weekly and seems to understand his faith more than a Trump supporter like yourself does. Trump stands for nothing we do as a Church.
Is it too late to forego a woman as VP for Biden? Asking for a friend.
Mark this tweet. Biden will not debate. He can‚Äôt. Reminder to everyone Bernie Sanders did not end his campaign he only ‚Äú suspended‚Äù it. Democrats do not have a candidate....
Shut up Biden! What have you done in the 47 years working in We The People government?
Better pay attention America: If Biden is elected, he won't be the president long. His vice president will have to take over quickly and the secret is that is the plan. The Democrats will use Biden to try and get the middle of the road vote so they can install a hard leftist.
It‚Äôs not even close. Keep telling this lie though.  It‚Äôs all you and trump do.  17.5 million republicans have registered Democrat for the first time ever. ByeDon2020.  Here‚Äôs the numbersüëáüëáü§£ü§°
Biden is crushing trump in campiagn contributions.  You do know that, right?    Like it‚Äôs not even close!
It‚Äôs not even close how much more Biden has raised compared to trump in the last 6 months. It‚Äôs like 4-1!   I‚Äôm not amazingly well off.  But I gave $750 to his campaign today, first time I‚Äôve ever given to a campaign directly.   ByeDon 2020
How‚Äôd she get through eight years of Obama and Biden?
I would absolutely LOVE to see Biden debate! Biden is incapable of handling hard questions without getting aggressive. He's already called one young girl ugly and one man fat. He's so funny to watch get riled up! I say, bring it on! üòÇ
As long as you let Biden give his acceptance speech at the WH too. The WH belongs to all of the people.
That is true. Biden doesn't have as much enthusiasm behind him. But the enthusiasm to get rid of Trump is more than equal to the task.
I think you Dems are hilarious fools. Joe Biden the list and his wonderful snake son, Hunter. You‚Äôre the fool and an uninformed sheep attempting to take us all to slaughter! Not me! I‚Äôm from a 4th generation military family and disgusted watching this nonsense go on.

Agree! But unfortunately not enough people will actually do it. Biden vs Trump is the biggest joke in American history
Lmao! Yea and trump is in the prime of his life üòÇüòÇ Biden is doing just fine. This guy on the other hand
Lol I can feel the desperation coming from these tweets. Everyone knows Biden is doing just fine. We're all watching trump have a complete breakdown in real time though. Everyone can see he's in no shape to lead this country. Nevermind the fact that he's in no way a leader.
It‚Äôs a ridiculous question and Biden‚Äôs response was fine but you are invested having a horse race so you do you.
Biden worked to get rid of a corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine!   He did great work there.   But here you are ignoring trumps allowing the murders of our American soldiers, with Russia weapons and Cash paid bounties.   Why are you ignoring the facts?   All you do is lie!ü§°ü§°
I like what Biden says here.   He nailed it in the head.   He laughs at trumps claims that trump got extra points. üëç  It‚Äôs laughable!   I like the ‚Äúprogram‚Äù analogy.  As a recovering addict I totally know what he‚Äôs talking about.   PS: still no fed plan for Herion problem in US
I have shared Biden‚Äôs videos and ashamed to contribute to this.  This is absolutely heartbreaking for me to watch his decline in such a public way.  His family must step in, it is cruel.
Lol Biden will be just fine. Your boy on the other hand I'm not so sure about
Biden said today he never took a cognitive tests but said a few weeks ago he took one daily...this is getting silly now.  Why isn't the media rolling out doctor after doctor on every talk show discussing Bidens mental condition...you know if he was a Rep he would be slayed!
Delaware home of Joe Biden.
Anyone else genuinely feel a little bad for Joe Biden? I used to roast the shit out of him but it it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs facing enormous pressure to campaign from special interests to the point where he likely doesn‚Äôt have much of a say. Get the poor guy off of TV and let him retire.
No!  It‚Äôs was a Russian probe. Biden/Obama were doing their job.  Investigating Russia for hacking our elections.  Like the Epstien/Maxwell case, guess who‚Äôs name keeps popping up?  Trump! His name keeps popping up in these high profile investigations.  Obama/Biden did their job
How many ways is Trump cheating to win? He was impeached for shaking down Zelensky for oppo dirt on Biden. He is slowing down the mail. He is sending secret police to cities for campaign ads. He is ending the census way early. Who knows what else? Every one of us must VOTE.
Uhm Biden would also be a fascist.
No!  It‚Äôs was a Russian probe. Biden/Obama were doing their job.  Investigating Russia for hacking our elections.  Like the Epstien/Maxwell case, guess who‚Äôs name keeps popping up?  Trump! His name keeps popping up in these high profile investigations.  Obama/Biden did their job

Perfect example of Democrats determination to power grab. This tweet does not reflect what is actually being said at hearing. Yates, Obama, Biden and Comey have lied and attempted to delegitimize our elections. They all should be charged
Riiight... Biden is the one with issues...
Absolutely awful what Comey, Yates, Obama and Biden did to our Country. Weaponized the FBI and DOJ in order to delegitimize the election. They should all be jailed
They say it‚Äôll be a fair election but manipulate things behind the scenes. Why didn‚Äôt Obama go on CNN and ask Klobuchar and Bootiegieg to drop out and endorse Biden? Why‚Äôd he do it from the shadows over a phone? Why are you so adamant about covering up their corruption?

I'd need evidence or proof before I consider voting for biden.
Whatever.  Trump and Biden are not the answer.  This ad is no joke.  Trump thinks he's got absolute power.  He doesn't have the Constitutional authority to demand things like opening schools.  He knows zero about the 10th amendment, and zero about compassion
You‚Äôre nuts! Biden‚Äôs brain is defective. He can keep a thought. He needs to stay in the basement for the next 4 years. Trump has more energy in his index finger than Biden has in his body!
Nah. Biden's not banning press from his convention so they can't see how far he's gone, is he?   Nothing wrong with Biden mentally -- it would be Fox's lead every day.
To Pence, Trump, the rest of the Administration and to Trump's campaign team, you don't know the real Former Vice President Joe Biden no better than you know yourselves.
No. It was born with JFK.   Clinton, still best economy in modern history and President Obama, pulled us out of the worst financial collapse in US History. 9-15-08.  Obama Biden has job growth their entire presidency, the entire time.  They added 16.1 million jobs first 18months
I saw a new Biden TV spot. Basically, Trump killed a grandma who died from Covid.   It‚Äôs like all they got is their notes from the Romney campaign.
To put things in perspective in 2015 around 58 million people died. That's around 158,000 a day. How is it one man's fault for all covid deaths? Is it Cuomos fault for the 34,000 dead? If you think Biden is the savior then you're already dead

Smile More? Some Critics See Sexism in Debate Over Biden VP
Yeah, they‚Äôre going to try to steal this one with mail in ballots. I had to travel to Central PA last week and all I saw were Trump signs. There was one Biden sign. In a fair election Trump will win with over 300 Electoral votes. Dems intend 2 have the illegals steal the election
This I agree with. Biden‚Äôs Strategy in the debates should be to goad Trump. Trump is predictable, undisciplined &amp; easily triggered.  His supporters call Trump a counterpuncher, but that‚Äôs actually defensiveness. When attacked Trump is compelled to respond, often to his detriment.
I am one of those people who think Biden may be at a disadvantage to Trump in the debates‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¶because they‚Äôre not debates, they‚Äôre shouting matches.  The format allows one candidate to rudely interrupt and shout down his opponent. And when it comes to rude, Trump has no equal.
It‚Äôs never crossed 30,000. Also it crashed in December.   Trump took over an upturn economy.  President Obama and VP Biden took over the worst economy since the Great Depression! 9-15-08.   Trump took over a solid economy, he has now ruined.  Obama/Biden took over the worst Fact!
Because the DNC elites chose Biden after South Carolina and pooled all of their resources behind him to defeat Bernie on a Super Tuesday. Are being intentionally obtuse, or...?
It never crashed once under Obama/Biden. Show your data...

this is how biden can win the millennial/gen z vote
There's no constitutional requirement on when the census is done.... Couldn't Biden just start over in 2021?
Joe Biden‚Äôs grandchild attends the most elite, most expensive private school in Delaware. Joe knows the value &amp; difference in private vs public education. Joe is also a graduate of an elite private-Catholic DE high school.
The last time that there was not a presidential debate was in 1972.  Can't help but think it'll hurt Biden if he were to get himself out of them this year.
There is one single goal here and that is to elect Joe Biden in 2020. He could pick Mike Pence (OK, stop), but I need to see Biden as POTUS. Anything else is mere distraction.

You convinced me, I'm voting Biden.
True, I mean financially, we are at one of the worst points in American history. And COVID should have taken 6 weeks, not 6 months. Face it, Mr. Art of the Deal failed. The worst thing Biden will do it nothing, which i would orefer to actively destroying/ embarrassing U.S. daily.
After Hitmer's BS? LOL Yeah right! It's gonna take a lot more than twitter inflating fake numbers and suppressing what doesn't fit their agenda to convinced the rest of the silence majority to vote for Biden. Biden, the guy that fingers women without consent. That guy.
We have to pray for these people. The few still supporting trump have a form of insanity.   ‚ÄúThe inability to reason or digest facts‚Äù  insane‚Äô When Biden is brought in we must address the serious mental illness in our country, indirectly brought to light under trumps failed term.
Fingered a girl without consent, but you will still vote Biden.
She'd let Biden finger her without consent, then vote for him if it meant that orange dude didn't get to be president anymore.
Yep...just like clock work.  Biden has no chance whether he debates or not.  This just gives them more time to figure out a replacement.  They are deciding right now whether to remove him or roll the dice with him and dump him a year into his term replaced by Kamala Harris.
Biden is ready to debate.   America, don‚Äôt believe this hail mart lie.  Biden admin has tried to coordinate debates with trump team and they won‚Äôt respond.
A record high for the Nasdaq ‚Äòwould all come crashing down,‚Äô says Trump in a tweet, ‚Äòincluding your jobs, stocks, and 401(k)s,‚Äô if Biden wins presidency
Bernie was ahead of Hillary and would definitely be ahead of biden
I used to be a Democrat until 2016. These past two elections have been a complete disaster. Sadly I would prefer Trump over Biden. I'll never be convinced that the party who hates police and literally is destroying America after wasting millions on useless investigations

Hey Y'all its the first Monday when it is totally official.  SOWA IN DA HOUSE!!!  Welcome to the Biden School.
America has had to live with the failed cheater from the 2016 election.   Biden isn‚Äôt scared.   I like that he‚Äôs taking his time.   The republicans are clearly in panic mode.
To be honest it would make more sense if Trump debated Biden's running mate. It's been Weekend at Bidens for a minute now.
No.   Keep pretending Biden‚Äôs the problem as 150,000 dead Americans and climbing are at our feet.
He‚Äôs getting his ass kicked. I can name 50 people who voted for trump that are now voting for Biden.   Millions and Millions of Republicans in America registered Democrat for the first time ever this year.   Trump has done more for the DNC than any president in history. FACT FACT
Biden all the way!! I‚Äôd raher Warren for President but...oh well.
‚ÄúBiden isn‚Äôt my first choice either but we have to get rid of Trump and worry about fixing society later‚Äù  I want to know how people can say this when 35 million households are staring eviction in the face and people can‚Äôt afford to pay their COVID-19 related medical bills
Right? My thoughts exactly. These idiots are nothing if not predictable and entirely transparent. Talking about debt lol. I'm sure they'll be blaming it on Biden starting 1/21. What garbage.
This looks like Biden‚Äôs work.
Let‚Äôs be real this is so the democrats can try and force mail in ballots so you can steal the election because you know Biden won‚Äôt win

This doesn‚Äôt change my impression that any argument/theme the Trump campaign makes against Biden only magnify Trump‚Äôs own problems. Does he really want to compare supporters shortly after an article that accuses SIL Jared Kushner of letting COVID-19 devastate blue states?
Good reason to vote Biden!
You do know that Donald Trump is only 3 years younger than Joe Biden, and in much worse physical shape?
I am not a Biden supporter. However, Dumb Donald is a disgusting, disturbing, dangerous, racist,egomaniacle, sociopathic maniac. Also, every time I read a comment against Biden,they all say the exact same thing. It's almost like u r reading a script or ur brainwashed.ü§î
Can we concentrate on one god damn thing? Get Biden elected in 2020. That's it, Biden 2020.
Betting markets, like everyone else, remain unsure who Biden's VP pick will be... but traders lean toward  as the pick
It's more about the schedule than the number.  Trump wants something to run against to change the tempo. The press is 100% focused on him and ignoring Biden. In 2016, the free media helped challenger Trump. Now he can't win w/o a mistake by Biden he can amplify.
They're fighting the last war where Clinton tried for Arizona and Texas in the final stretch and mysteriously lost by identical margins in Midwest swing states. Biden can't be hit w/ same playbook b/c misogyny and boringness. He has room to run with a VP who challenges whiteness.
Biden MUST debate Trump!! The country must see him truly alone and how he handles himself!!
Electing President Biden and the Democrats being in the House and Senate majority would be a excellent start!  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Biden does what he is told.
LOL "If Biden wins there will not be a right-wing version of #Resistance. Since 1789 the right side of the Assembly believes, deep down, that its losses are entirely legitimate, whereas the left believes, deep down, that its own losses are a betrayal of the constitutional order."
Joe Biden is mentally unfit for the Presidency. NM the creepy sniffing or touching. Of course, the Democratic Party is also unfit to lead a nation so it appears to be a match made in heaven.
But I don‚Äôt know if I will survive mentally if we have four more years of trump so Biden it is
The media needs to stop letting Trump control the narrative.  If Trump wants to ban press from his circus let him. The press should use that time to give free press to Biden.
"I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun. The kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg so it was straight and then watch the hair come back up. So I learned about roaches and I learned about kids jumping on my lap. I love kids jumping on my lap." - Biden
Trump killed everyone. He should have a mandatory lock down. Nobody comes outside until all cases are gone. Should be shot onsite if caught outside. At risk patients quarantine in  nursing homes. Biden wouldn't have let the virus in, in the 1st place. Cnn groupies be like ü§£ ü§£
"I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun. The kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg so it was straight and then watch the hair come back up. So I learned about roaches and I learned about kids jumping on my lap. I love kids jumping on my lap." - Biden
60,000,000 got H1N1 in America, .0002% died.   President Obama had a vaccine in progress 5 months before it hit our shores.   Great great leader.  3 in America died from Ebola.  Trump never looked at Biden‚Äôs Pandemic plan. They left trump a plan! The fucking idiot never looked
Would be Joe Biden's America?  Umm...but isn't it actually Trump's America? I mean, Trump IS the president this is happening under, correct? Correct.  This IS Trump's America, and it WILL CONTINUE to be Trump's America unless he's removed from office.
Nobody would dog-whistle to such a tiny fringe group.  It's like worrying that Biden is dog-whistling to Antifa black bloc. Doesn't make sense to do.  If you don't believe, I suggest asking people at a Trump rally. I'll bet you: they won't have heard of any of these conspiracies.
President Obama and VP Biden took over the worst collapse in modern history.   And they nailed it and now trumps ruined it.  Sick of the charity, deplorable, fucking idiots, let‚Äôs call a spade a spade.
"I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun. The kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg so it was straight and then watch the hair come back up. So I learned about roaches and I learned about kids jumping on my lap. I love kids jumping on my lap." Joe Biden
They never said she would win with 92% of the vote.  Although she destroyed him on the popular vote, she ignored swing states. She alienated Bernie supporters. America also didn‚Äôt know how bad of a failure trump was.   Biden is ahead in the states she lost.   Landslide! ByeDon
Trump losing will be the only good moment of this year. Last I checked he was 15 points down. Unless he grows a brain overnight, or Biden comes out screaming n words and f words at the first debate, Trump literally cannot win. And I cannot wait.
Nah! You should give the facts a try.  Biden 2020  Trumps America has a 33% drop in GDP.  To put that in perspective, the Great Depression only had a 15% drop.   For those in the back, that's more than double the trouble.   Making America broke again.
Not going to happen. Jill isn‚Äôt appearing with him anymore either. Still no Biden signs in Delaware.
Good point.   It‚Äôs not like we have to worry about Biden, like we constantly have to worry about trump.   Did you ever locate your spine, Ted?
I hope that he does, but I imagine that resigning will taste too much like losing to him, so I doubt he will.  IMO, I think he's just setting to stage to cry voter fraud when Biden wins. He'll leave the Whitehouse, but he'll forever claim that he was cheated out of a second term.
He admitted he did something wrong.  Joe Biden admitted it wasn‚Äôt right.   See the difference?  Biden = Integrity.  Trump = blame, lies and division.
Not all Biden supporters are PEDOS.. but all Biden supporters feel that groping children is not a ‚Äòdeal breaker‚Äô
Women should not be criticized for ambition. The narrative that the Biden VP pick is presumed to be a black woman is perpetuated by the likes of    when Biden *did not say that.* The ongoing erasure of Warren in coverage is pathetic.
Is this your counter to wanna be president Biden? Former VP? Democrats themes seem to be stolen from PeeWee Herman! I know you are but what am i!!!!
I love how Joe Biden was in govt for 40 years and fixed America with his magical hairy legs. I also love how he wrote the Clinton crime bill which was responsible for disproportionately locking up black people for minor offenses. #Biden2020
I never said viruses care about politics. After all virus‚Äôs don‚Äôt have a conscious, neither does Joe Biden.
Biden‚Äôs their best hope...
Keep posting lies that are easily busted. Thank you!
Joe Biden did not write this Tweet.  P.S. Marxists are Traitors.
We‚Äôd rather not see it anyway. While it‚Äôs going on, they can give Biden the free publicity.
Great idea. Press should just focus on covering Biden during that time.
VOTE FOR BIDEN!  Trump has had almost 4 years to "Make America Great Again" and we're worse off now than we were in 2016, WAY worse.  Trump has had his chance and squandered it. Let the adults take over.
When we elect Joe Biden, we will make America Great Again!
What are the chances that she is on Biden's VP short list?
It would make a huge difference Senator! I havent been able to keep up with bills with my hours cut from 40/week to 10/wk. Hoping you are VP Biden's choice for a running mate.
I was a socialist back when socialism wasn't cool. But I'm voting Biden. I'm voting ALL blue. Cast aside the rhetoric or hurt feelings - this is democracy vs fascism.
Joe Biden could select a toaster oven as his running mate and he would still get my vote.
Biden will NOT win Georgia.... That's what Brian Kemp is literally there for.
No surprise..but who will step in..or will the Dems prop Biden up for a ‚ÄúWeekend at Bernies‚Äù
If Biden is no longer running then the Ukraine scandal comes back. That is what they are trying to avoid.
Biden wasn't announced as Obama's VP until August 22nd.  Biden knows who his running mate will be, he's just waiting to make the announcement. (I'm guessing it happens tomorrow)
When will Joe Biden answer questions about  Hunter Biden and his dealing with China and other Countries?  Next Question who is paying the Press not to ask questions that might hurt Joe Biden chances of winning the Presidential Election?
Press should just say ok and say they are going to focus on Biden during that time.  Don‚Äôt play Trump‚Äôs game and discuss him not getting covered.
He really is. Maybe he has Biden‚Äôs disease?
They said ‚ÄúI have seen Drug companies taking ads against Obama and Biden though.‚Äù Yet they don‚Äôt show any.  They asked others to post the ads but no one could find them. They can‚Äôt find them because the ads don‚Äôt exist. The Krassensteins lie. Honest people don‚Äôt get raided by DHS
I have not seen a Biden lawn sign anywhere in Delaware. Plenty of Trump signs.
That's a good thought, but they also have evidence and a vocal victim that said Biden finger fucked her involuntarily.  The law doesn't apply to them.

Biden would crush him.   Trump frail, weak and clearly losing his mind.  It‚Äôs sad to watch him.  Very very weak.   He shit his pants again today on the golf course. Very very sad.  A dog would be treated better.  Here he is full of his own shit.
just thinking about Biden as president i feel so sad!!!
Plenty of bad cops would vote for Biden.

Though a floor fight that repudiates Biden‚Äôs pick would amuse me.    Non-zero probability of this happening.
Any VP pick that Biden makes will chase away a big enough slice of votes he needs.   So who cares.
I don‚Äôt think Biden will win. All that vote suppression stuff that helped Biden lock up the primary will work in Trump‚Äôs favor in the general, and on top of that Trump‚Äôs base doesn‚Äôt think COVID-19 is real.

That said, if you‚Äôve been following this at all, you know that it didn‚Äôt just come out of thin air. Other countries are doing the same thing. Our military has done it. The Biden campaign has done it.
Crawling over broken, covid infected glass to vote. However, i don't think there's any way in hell trumps people let him debate. They like to push the whole Biden dementia garbage, but it's just more projection, as always with trump.
Yeah, but one time Biden was hanging out with some friends in a hot tub and ended up going back in time. It was awesome.
I don‚Äôt think Joe Biden will refuse... but I‚Äôll still vote for him!!!
The other alleged "negative" is that she hit Biden too hard in the debate.  That's good, she'll be on Biden's team and they're running against Trump.  Don't you need sharp elbows when battling Team Trump?
Its time for the American people to demand a full investigation of Hunter and Joe Biden! Biden has been stone  walling and refused to answer question about it and the Press are afraid to ask about it!

Helped write. Sorry. And I cant argue with that. I'm really torn between the two but Biden seems to have way too much baggage imo. Hopefully after November we can try to mend relations destroyed by political or religious views. Either way I wish you well.
I think it‚Äôs a fit.  I think they could be a team similar to Obama/Biden where they can work as a team and use each other‚Äôs strengths to serve.
I remember alot of politicians saying a bunch of dumb stuff. Do you think Biden is going to swoop in and save us all?
Through their espionage and intellectual property theft, China now has the keys to the kingdom. We'll have all we we can do just to fend off their cyber attacks. Never mind their global military ambitions.   And Democrats let them have it all. Just ask Joe Biden.
I will not be convinced to vote for Biden. His openly racist comments,  weird touching of children and incoherent ramblings about roaches and kids rubbing his hairy legs creeps me out. He bowed to protesters, showing weakness and called police the enemy.

Is critical thinking a strong point for Biden/Harris supporters? Most people miss it - Harris‚Äô father‚Äôs ancestral pride. It isn‚Äôt different from Southern pride in Dixie heritage. Certainly, neither advocate slavery and neither are culpable for it.

If we go back to 1972 when Joe Biden ran against Caleb Boggs for US Senate ‚Äî the answer is still ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. I never considered voting for Biden.
Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúdementia‚Äù doesn‚Äôt much matter because, if elected, he will resign for health reasons after being sworn in, else the Democrats will sorrowfully and prayerfully remove him through the 25th Anendment. I expect the identity of his VP choice will confirm that‚Äôs the plan.
Trump is a problem but only a fool would think Biden is the answer.
I say too little, too late. He hasn't changed...he just says more things, more often now. Joe Biden is racist!

I completely agree with you. There is no way I would consider voting for Biden. I don't believe that the man could hold the position for a year even if he somehow wins. Him getting the democratic nomination shows how weak the democrats are currently.
This video shows a fit and toned person who resembles Biden. Are body doubles common political practice?
Not a single person voting for Biden.
Biden can't win fair and square so he's resorting to scaring people into voting for him. Your SS is safe. Stop listening to lying Democrats.
Joe Biden is SO racist. In 2008 he said "you can't go to a 7-11 store or a Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent". He's an embarrassment!
Give Joe Biden credit. He apologized to the black community for saying that all blacks think alike. And he no longer opposes busing to achieve school desegregation. And it‚Äôs been several years since he eulogized any segregationist at his funeral. The new Joe is greatly changed.

Anybody helmet shaming Biden for not wearing a helmet on a MUP that goes between the cape henlopen park and the rehoeboth boardwalk is catching a block.
Joe Biden figured any reporter who asks him anything other than a cream puff question must be a Trump supporter. And as Joe always says, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre for Trump, you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù So I figure Joe just couldn‚Äôt tell the reporter was black.
If we let Biden win?  Rand Paul is just one more R Senator manipulated by the Russians. Put another way he‚Äôs a useful idiot. Or more succinctly an idiot.

So where‚Äôs all the Biden flags in this Delaware marina ..the White Marlin open is this week and not one Biden  flag to be seen ..but the Trump flags dominate ..poor unc Joe still no respect in his state ..
I am just as right about Biden being a bumbling Idiot as I was about Simmons not being able to play. That would make me 2 for 2.
I wasnt angry at all . You made dumb statement that debates will have no influence.  Of course they will .  Biden has been a politician his whole life . A debate should be easy for him. But because Dems dont even like their own candidate they dont want him exposed.
If Dems see Biden not be able to complete a sentence in a debate it could definitely change some people's minds and influence the election . I still hold out some hope that some Dems may  have common sense. But after watching their behavior since the night Trump  won maybe not.
We need you and Joe Biden.
A small percentage could be the difference in election. If they want Biden to represent the country as president he needs to show  people he mentally can do so or they need to find another candidate. .
So Biden has told the truth his whole 40 plus years in politics?? The whole previous administration is the most corrupt to ever hold office. So stop with the lying digs at Trump. Their has never not been debates for presidential elections. Why should Biden get a pass.
It's Biden ducking the debates, not Trump. Dems are terrified how Biden will crash and burn if he came out of his basement and actually had to talk unscripted and without his handlers
They are hoping that he will take the black vote away from Biden.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Joe Biden and I approve this message.‚Äù (In 15 minutes I may not remember this message or know even what State I‚Äôm in, but I now approve this message that my handlers just put up on a teleprompter for me).
Because they know that trump is going to suck against Biden
Nobody holds up a 7-11 or shoots children in the streets of Chicago with assault rifles or other weapons of war. All Joe Biden is reminding us is that as a Senator and again as VP, he did nothing to stop the killings in the streets of our cities. Now he wants to defund police.
So, speaking of testing, when will Joe Biden stop refusing to have his mental acuity tested and reported to the American public?The same people who will get an abortion in a Biden presidency are the same that will in a Trump presidency.  So honestly voting for Biden isn't a vote for abortion.  It is a vote for a better future for those of us already born though. Doesn't pro life mean us too?
Beautiful juxtaposition  hypocrisy of the far right  Like why is trump's nickname for Biden 'Sleepy Joe'  But trump doesn't even get to the oval until late am  Trump's daily schedule: preset 'executive time' and an early wake-up - Business Insider
Mitt Romney is a family man and one of the few Republicans that I respect as a person. I personally would probably even go as far to support Mitt Romney over Hillary Clinton. Unfortunately, in the current political atmosphere, Mitt Romney would split the Biden vote.
I am having a really hard time with this-so Trump is unbolting mailboxes-blue heavy steel mailboxes that have US Mail printed with oil based paint-so we can‚Äôt vote for Biden- do I have that right? How do we mail get well cards to relatives he is getting sick
...if I wasn't broke, I'd ask for double on him directly asking Biden if he would lock her up, and when he gets the predictable 'what is even wrong with you' look, he tries to spin it as 'proof of collusion'.
People are allowed to have differing opinions, obviously the people in this conversation hate Trump but they just wish they could‚Äôve got someone better considering Biden‚Äôs pretty much criminal past, but instead of somewhat trying to converse you dismiss them as fake.
Don‚Äôt worry. Probably Joe Biden looking to increase campaign donations.  He said he wanted to expand Social Secirity.
Peaceful research movement.  Let me guess: her evidence was that the person had a Biden yard sign?
Biden‚Äôs given three speeches in my hometown of Wilmington, DE in recent weeks and went on a nice bike ride a few miles away in Greenville the other day. Oh, and he kind of made history yesterday by tapping the first minority female to be his running mate.   Where have you been?

Listen up people considering voting for Biden!  I would vote for Mickey Mouse before voting for Biden. At least Mickey loves America and isn't a Socialist/Communist.  So if Trump hurt your little feelings with his tough talk I WILL NOW APOLOGIZE on his behalf. We good?
Rotten to the core. He‚Äôs never been a decent person but he has sunk to the lowest levels of deparvity. His need for power &amp; surroundining himself with butt kissers show he can‚Äôt honestly win. He will lie and cheat anyone. #CrookedTrump #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #Biden #mailfraud

üòÇüòÇüôå  I'm honestly not sure.  I can say that locally, I'm seeing less support for Biden than I was for Hillary, and I was not that surprised when she lost.
As I recall Obama sent 150 Billion dollars to the middle east which was used to kill Americans! Joe Biden did nothing to stop this. I guess he was too busy trying to cover his son Hunter ass from a criminal investigation!
As long as you know all my answers are *my crazy leftist opinions* we're good. Dems/Repubs would give you different answers. üòÇ  Short answer is Obama chose Biden for VP to appease racists, centrists, and right leaning swing voters. And it worked.
Harris the woman that will destroy with Joe Biden the White Obama the people of Destruction.  (wherethenewsis com)
A true Democrat look what he's done for pa there you answer.  He went Joe Biden in Office the white Obama.  (wherethenewsis com)
Here's Biden talking about his Crime Bill:
Harris is an opportunistic, nasty woman. She accused Biden of racism and said she believes the women who accused Biden of sexual assault. Despite these FACTS she decided to accept the VP position just for the power. She will sell any American down the river for more power.
The way I see it, and again, I'm far left here, Trump is a symptom of America, and Biden is an architect of the system that elected and supports him.   Biden will solve nothing.    Also, Black Lives Matter began while Biden was VP.  Just a point that gets lost.
So, I was never going to vote for Biden.  Adding a cop as his VP definitely will make me not vote for him harder. üòÇ
I'm a leftist, meaning I support social programs, universal healthcare, environmentalism, etc. Both Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris have spent their careers locking people up for things like marijuana use. Add Biden's war mongering &amp; sexual aggressiveness to that- Trump, but effective.
You really can't. We've played this game before. We are ignoring the problem while only post pining the inevitable gop fascist take over, and telling us voting biden will stop it is laughable as biden spent his whole career siding with the Republicans.
this is the dumbest take. trump literally has no policy, he uses the GOP platform that still says they need to get obama out of office. biden has extensive and detailed policies. google would tell you this
SORRY, fracking would continue under Biden. Just no new permits. STOP THE LIES!!
Biden and Harrris May need to cut the meat of the Republicans since they a bunch of cry babies! #BidenHarris2020
Honestly I dislike Trump and Biden it really feels like another repeat of Hillary versus Trump both choices are terrible

I'm sorry, FUCKING WHAT?  Biden isn't the President, and he won't be officially until January.  I don't know if you accidentally put "Biden" instead of "Trump" or if that was a legit Freudian slip. Either way, Trump has been in charge, so it's HIS failure.
Biden‚Äôs choice for VP, is Sketchy at the least. Harris was dating Biden‚Äôs son and spent a lot of time with Biden in his home. It‚Äôs awful funny he‚Äôd pick her for this position. Skeptic are wondering if she has some dirt on him or what is she dating him and his son. Time will tell
Woooowwww. The projection with this is just on another level. Or did we already have the election and Biden is president? Seriously can the gop be this stupid? How is that possible?
Talking about Biden during a press conference? That's not a press conference, that's a campaign rally. Is there no line this president won't cross?

Obama/Biden economy was the worst since Jimmy Carter.  The REAL TRUTH is Trump inherited a total mess and got things cleaned up in light speed!  Kamala please stop the lying.  We all know the truth and it not going to work!

Also a weird metaphor when you consider Biden's association with trains.  Dunno, this seems very 5 year old boy in playground-esque.
Well now lets take a look at our future under Biden! No police, no jobs, more taxes which means a lower standard of living for all Americans, open boarders means a higher standard of living for non-americans who will receive all the perks from Gov. Now tell me why vote for JOE.
Biden said he would of never closed the boarders or shut the country down. Everyone would be dead if he dealt with covid.
It‚Äôs too late and no longer matters. We‚Äôre looking to the Biden administration.
Don‚Äôt vote Kanye. Don‚Äôt vote trump. Don‚Äôt vote Biden. There are more candidates that don‚Äôt have a weird ass history, and even if you don‚Äôt agree with, for example, a libertarians views 100% I‚Äôm so confident they‚Äôd be better than the ones getting the media‚Äôs attention.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will deliver their convention speeches at the Chase Center in Wilmington next week, the Biden campaign said Thursday.
The hard facts, are that until we get this pandemic under control, nothing is going to get better. That should've been the focus from day one, but it wasn't. Trump talked miracles and hoaxes instead.  That is the first step, get Covid under control. Biden &amp; Harris will do that.
Personally though, I'd close down all of campus/most of Newark and put him on the steps of memorial hall at  (like the "Welcome Back Biden" Event) or shut down a chunk of Wilmington and do it in front of the Wilmington Train Station.
No matter how you feel about the presidential or vice presidential nominee, it's pretty incredible to consider how much history is *still* being created in Delaware.
Consistently voting for the lesser of two evils just brought us closer to evil.  If Joe Biden's brand of racism and sexual assault and anti-choice is polite enough for you to vote for him over Trump, fine.  Go for it.  It's your vote.    My morals won't allow me to.

More lies. We just have to vote for him right? He has some magic plan to fund all this that we'll find out about in April huh? Lmao! Yea no thanks. Keep your payroll tax. I'll be voting Biden.
So if you go to the  website it takes you to Joe Biden's campaign page. Yeah let that flipping sink in. That should tell you all you need to know. The Brown Coats support Biden. Go ahead take the red pill.

I still wanna see a Trump vs Harris debate  It would be good content and arguably necessary since Biden can barely finish a sentence
When is Biden going answer questions on his son Hunter?
Well, you might be right but if Biden wins they will weaken it. But all those lost buisnesses, closed schools and student athletes will have been scaraficed in the name of politics. My friend closed her shop forever this week üò¢ I am sick of all of them..
So of course You Know Who had a presser immediately after Biden/Harris, and the contrast was like whiplash.    I didn‚Äôt think he could sound any more stupid, but when held up next to the intelligence and optimism of Biden/Harris, he only proved that whining IS what he does best.
Harris said it best, ‚ÄúTrump has ruined everything that he‚Äôs inherited‚Äù   He simply can‚Äôt lead.   Vote for Biden/Harris in 2020 Great leaders   Also vote for a rotting melon, over the failed trump/pence team, if that‚Äôs your fancy.
She definitely is losing it!! What is so exciting about Sleepy Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP!!! The woman has been a total hypocrite from day one!! But that's what liberalism is all about, hypocrisy and the double standard!! Trump in a landslide on November 3rd 2020!!
Bush tanked it. Clinton fixer it. W tanked it. Obama fixed it. Trump tanked it. No worries though, Biden will fix it.
I'm a campaign donor and on his FR event happening now, Biden just said he raised $26M AND added 150k donors to his list in the last 24 hours.   I mean ... that's #JOEMENTUM.
If I understand the Democratic plan they want to take our guns, jobs , money raise taxes, do away with private health care, open the borders to anyone, grant citzenship to all with all the free stuff we are entitled to as Americans. If this sounds good to you vote for Biden.

I am pretty sure that anyone crazy racist wouldn't be voting Biden anyway, since he gratefully served under and in support of Obama. To the people to whom it might make a difference, I suspect that is unforgiveable. Those people are ridiculous, but... here we are in 2020.
That doesn't matter. Because the next election it'll just be the same problem. Because the democrats won't push for progressive policies. We aren't going to stop the gop from putting up another trump just by beating him with biden now. And biden won't win anyway

Waste of a Vote
In a small state like Delaware, seems like everyone has a Biden sighting. Do you have a photo with Joe or Jill? Share it here!
also, you underestimate the people who didn't vote for Hillary because they weren't enthusiastic who now, despite not being enthusiastic for Biden (bc honestly why should they be) will vote for anyone bc they hate trump so much, hence "silent majority"
Reminder that  is still trying to exclude our digital producer Verna and video strategist Jenna from our guild, even though both are hard at work on our all-hands coverage of Biden in Delaware today. Do the right thing. Stop excluding your workers. Recognize
GOP are a bunch of traitors. Selling our country out to Russia. Biden and Harris are the true patriots.
I was about to post a satire thing about Harris standing in for Biden in at least one of the debates with Trump.  Then I thought, that may not be satire for long.

Stephen,besides being a bum you don‚Äôt know the real Joe Biden. You might actually have to visit Delaware to meet Joe if he ever gets out of his basement.
Joe Biden needs to tell the American people how his idiot son Hunter got rich taking money from foreign countries with your help! And God forbid if you are elected what do we have to look forward to from Hunter and you other then more corruption!
In the current climate where people are massively protesting police, Kamala was probably the worst choice he could have made. Her cop past is exactly why her campaign flunked, I saw no chance for Biden to beat Donald and it just got even worse with Harris as vp.
Prolife Delawareans! Join us to protest Biden for his stance as pro-abortion ‚ÄúCatholic‚Äù TODAY at press conference. Working on location/time.
Biden doesn't stand a chance, he was put in place by the dnc to stop bernie, who actually had a decent chance to beat trump, biden is going to lose. We can't keep voting for the dems just for them to do nothing.

Biden has been in office longer but nice try
Let me translate this tweet:  "The average, middle-class white woman will be voting for me, just like her husband has told her to do. They want safety from POC &amp; to keep their suburbs as white as possible. Biden is for equality, and would end my racist segregation tactics."
In the moment's leading up to¬†Joe Biden announcing Kamala Harris as his running mate, his campaign built the suspense.

I think Biden makes up his own tenets of Catholicism to follow. His stance on abortion is condemned by the church. He shouldn‚Äôt  receive communion, if and when he goes to mass, in my opinion. A lapsed Catholic (CINO).
You guys push that dementia card hard boy but your guy was just up on stage talking about the flu of 1917 that ended ww2 while Biden was out exercising. Might want to sit this one out, just makes you all look stupid, I know it doesn't take much but still...

There‚Äôs no more room. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, there‚Äôs just no more room in that pee brain for anybody else.
Are you old enough to remember Biden telling people they aren‚Äôt black if they support Trump?
Joe Biden‚Äôs mind is slipping. He forgets where he is; he stumbles and seems confused. It‚Äôs sad. Kamala Harris also had about zero support and dropped out early. She‚Äôs a terrible candidate who will excite nobody.
It‚Äôll haunt him when they impeach him after the Biden/Harris win.    They‚Äôll pull this out and have the evidence that he did talk about the Mueller probe.
A lot of Libertarians and (l)ibertarians seem like they are looking for any reason whatsoever to not vote for the Libertarian candidate.  SMH.  Not voting for POTUS at all can be defended, but voting for Trump or Biden over Jorgenson seems intellectually inconsistent.  Comments?
I‚Äôll be updating this #BidenHarris2020 story throughout the day, so keep checking back.  Meanwhile, we have these reporters and photogs out and about today:
On 1/21/2021 Harris would assemble the cabinet to vote to remove Biden. The 25th amendment provides that a President can be removed if the VP and a majority of the cabinet determine the President is ‚Äúunable to discharge the powers and duties‚Äù.
Biden is racist. Voted against black people constantly, incarcerated them at higher rates, worked to help crrate their all time high unemployment rate (under obama nonetheless), openly opposed the LGBTQ community, asked a black reporter if he‚Äôs a junkie and uses POC for votes.

Manipulated. Biden was quoting someone else. I am reporting this.

No.  Biden is solid man.   He didn‚Äôt say, the 1917 flu ended world war 2.  Trump did. Trump said that.  Biden will win.
It‚Äôs bad enough he is tweeting politics, even worse he missed the fact that Biden is Catholic #fail
Everybody got all this shit about Biden and Harris but who‚Äôs the alternative? Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll wait
Harris couldn‚Äôt get a single vote when she was running in the primary. She isn‚Äôt going to help Biden.
Just to clarify. Biden ran against Castro, Harris, Buttigeg and many others. All represent some form of minority in politics. (POC, gay, women) So if he cared so much about equality, why didn‚Äôt he step aside and endorse any of them? Answer: because he doesn‚Äôt care.
A decisive victory by Biden/Harris is something to look forward to. Not much else I know, but it might rattle the dark triad kleptocrats. All is not lost, James T. Kirk would never give in, so nor will I. üòé
Am I the only one who sees the irony in Biden selecting a ‚Äúblack‚Äù women  to serve under him? Why not step aside and be her VP? Answer: because he doesn‚Äôt really care about POC. This is all about votes. This is race baiting at it‚Äôs finest.
Trump's goon are literally kidnapping protestors in unmarked vans and teargassing priests. Remember when biden did that as vp? No?
‚Äúif and when Biden decides to step aside‚Äù Now that‚Äôs a vote of confidence. SMH.
Biden or harris might listen to progressive demands. Trump in a 2nd term will hunt you down in the street like dogs.  This isnt a hard choice.
Build from the ground up man. National elections require big tents, hence biden harris. You want a more progressive candidate then we have to start from the ground floor and build up. Once the party is full of AOCs theyll be no one to block progressive policy from within.
I've been aii the way in on biden. I like Harris, personally wanted her as AG to go after Trump and Barr and reestablish rule of law. But, she's a great choice.

Have u seen k. Harris vs our Vice President Biden
Nobody gets picked because they‚Äôre the best. Each VP is circumstantial. Pence was picked because he seemed stable in comparison(Trump actually wanted Newt). Kaine was a safe choice to calm white dudes who didn‚Äôt want to vote for a woman. Biden was to appeal to blue collar voters.
The Internet: We know he's awful but you have to vote for Biden  *Biden announces VP*  The internet: Here's all the reasons you can't vote for Kamala  So I guess we ________??????
For what it is worth... drop the mic moment vs Pence: You are not afraid to tell the President Biden if u think he is going down the wrong path. HE respects YOU. YOU respect HIM. That's how u run the country. Pence has done nothing but be a yes man for Trump.
The radical liberal loons aren‚Äôt here to rebuild anything. They‚Äôre desperate to stay out of jail. They think Crooked won in 2016 and Biden is just taking bullets for her until when? The last week in October lol?

He won't step aside. He will be blindsided. Harris would assemble the cabinet to vote to remove Biden. The 25th amendment provides that a President can be removed if the VP and a majority of the cabinet determine the President is ‚Äúunable to discharge the powers and duties‚Äù.
If you look at what GOP is saying about Kamala, you‚Äôd think she was further left than Bernie üòÇ  But ask yourself: are you more likely to see criminal justice reform and prison reform with Trump or Biden? Because those are the options.
In just over a minute, Trump bounces from nutty conspiracy theory, to threatening political rivals, to misogyny, to racism, to being baffled that Biden is able to tolerate criticism.   A pretty good summary of most of the reasons why Trump must be voted out of office.
