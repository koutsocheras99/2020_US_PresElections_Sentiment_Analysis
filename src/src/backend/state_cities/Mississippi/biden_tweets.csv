is racist garbage! Biden will still get 99 percent of the African American vote.
and this is someone who is so delusional to believe Biden is a good candidate, or even really mentally incapable of serving out his term. Let him come out and answer questions on policy, on how he would address the Pandemic, on Policing issues. Not through press releases

So the ‚ÄúGRABBER‚Äù thinks he can speak for AAs. Not offended by what Biden said but I am offended by what you just implied. You don‚Äôt think for AAs, and we know you hate them. SOBs, Cent Park 5, don‚Äôt rent to (C) coloreds, no AAs counting your money, the suburbs, etc....
I read the transcript of Biden‚Äôs original garbled remarks. I see what he was imprecisely trying to say. I see why Black citizens could take offense. He apologized. He clarified.  What else can he do? This bullshit Dennis is doing is just that.
Biden should ask him at the debate if he was thinking of Stormie Daniels when he misspoke Thighland.
Biden said a racist thing
That's pretty much right. Trumpers try to claim Biden has low mental abilities, while Trump flutters around like a deranged cuckoo bird.
Just have questions selected,  let President Trump answer and play videos of biden o the topics
I would crawl over broken glass. I would wait however long it takes to cast a vote for Biden #RidenWithBiden2020
If Joe Biden does not debate, ask a group of reporters to select questions and just playback Joe's stupid gaffes about the subject.
It is a damn shame that they are promoting and pushing Joe Biden,who obviously has dementia. That's elderly abuse. He will not debate you because it will expose the shell of a person he is.

Joe Biden lost his wife and a child in an accident after he first became a senator. More recently, he lost a son to brain cancer. I bet he has prayed to God a million times or more.  I know this: Only God can answer prayer. Only God gets to choose who is against Him!
Your dear leader benefits from an economy that Obama built. BTW black unemployment had the biggest drop under Obama. Facts! What Biden hasn‚Äôt  done is refer to AA‚Äôs as SOBs and ask for the death penalty for five innocent ppl or not rent to ‚ÄúC‚Äôs‚Äù.

Wow!  What‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs platform? Who is being polled? I know of no one who has been polled. Wake up American. Biden‚Äôs position has changed on many things. He isn‚Äôt the Joe Biden we have known.

Joe Biden will not come to Milwaukee for DNC
Can‚Äôt say that idea is better.  He isn‚Äôt. The whole Democratic Party is corrupt.. if you are not voting Trump then you either are voting Biden and abortion, LGBTQ and open borders etc. I am in no way saying Trump is a moral man. He has done more than the Democrats.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is no longer traveling to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a report.
Democrats are going to use the enept post office to try to  the election ,but people are wishing up on Joe Biden and know he would be a disaster for our country as we as his progressive radical liberal VP choice .
Joe Biden will.
It‚Äôs weird... I‚Äôve seen neither Trump nor Biden signs... anywhere....
Triggered much? Did you actually watch Biden‚Äôs interview on talking about defund the police?
Biden gone pick a black woman running mate and thats gonna be their reason to do nothing for black people, another symbolic victory
Easy, they‚Äôve never actually watched a Biden speech.  They‚Äôve seen a couple edited FB clips and run w it.
I surely will do just that. Biden in 2020!
when he got elected after the bus interview with Billy Bush coming out, he pretty much was set for 4 years. It just falls on people to get out and vote. That 3rd party sh*t ain't going to cut it this time. Either you vote Biden or pretty much guarantee 4 more years of Trump.
Biden has been in Washington for 30 plus years.  Not what‚Äôs needed.
they need to debate like now. i just wanna see trump destroy biden
Here‚Äôs something: if you‚Äôre a Democrat don‚Äôt demonize Trump supporters. There are reasons why they voted for him.  Trumpeters: don‚Äôt demonize Dems because there are reasons why people want to vote for Biden.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
We could have 20 debates and Joe Biden would mop Donald Trump's ass all over the stage.
I think it‚Äôll be to Biden‚Äôs advantage if there‚Äôs no audience. The Orange buffoon plays to a crowd. I hope he creeps up on Joe like he did HRC in 2016 and Joe throat punches him.
We All know that Joe Biden CAN‚ÄôT handle the World Stage. I don‚Äôt know what kind of BS these Lowlife Democrats are trying to Pull but it‚Äôs BAD I do know that. No American would actually think that she‚Äôll of a man could be President of this Country there‚Äôs a Master Plan

Sad but true. I do NOT like Biden or his politics, but some sort of dementia ultimately afflicts - what is it, one of three aging or aged adults (and some younger ones, too)? So at a human level, not a political one,  I feel great compassion for him.
If Biden wins, many of may have to leave.
As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals.
Not everything is political. Someone could put a Biden flag on a boat and pass by also. I know there are not many Biden supporters with boats but any of them could do it...
. Right, let‚Äôs all vote for Biden.  We can tank Wall Street with ballot harvesting and kill Main Street with the virus.
Unfollowed, per your request. Biden is in full-scale dementia - there are videos showinig helpers holding his elbow to guide him on the street. You REALLY want a senile puppet int he WH? Really?
I am getting older 61 years.  I feel bad Biden is losing his memory and cognitive assets but to me, he shouldn‚Äôt run for Pres. The people around him are using him and his wife Jill is No. 1 idiot!!!

A UNION WORKER'S RESPONSE TO JOE BIDEN (back in March before he had totally lost it), on taking our AR-14s (?) and AR-16s (?) and 100-round clips (?), none of which exists except in poor Biden's demented state:
This is such a lame attempt to give the Biden team cover for even considering skipping the debates.   I can‚Äôt imagine a legit scenario where the three presidential debates don‚Äôt happen. Biden knows he has to debate Trump.
Conflabulation - Joe Biden
So  went to Cuba with the Venceremos Brigade and spoke at the opening of a new Scientology center in her district a decade ago.  No matter whom  chooses I am sure we will hear blown-out-of-proportion negatives about them.  If you support Biden, chill out.
One week into trump's presidency he started taking credit for the economy. He hadn't signed one bill. Hadn't passed any new legislation at that time. As usual he hijacked the accomplishment of someone else and claimed it as his own. Biden will fix his mess like Obama fixed Bush's

Imagine not voting for trump because he‚Äôs racist and sexist and turning around to vote for Biden. It‚Äôs just silly at this point.

THERE IS NO DEBATE!!!
I remember when Obama said just a few months ago that Joe Biden just doesn‚Äôt have (IT)! But I guess Joes it must have been COVID 19! So now Obama backs sleepy Joe üò¥!
It‚Äôs ridiculous considering how many runs Joe Biden made.
Since Biden has clearly said he will be in office most likely one term, Harris as VP opens her up  for President for the next two terms and that scares the crap out of them. A female POC as POTUS!! This is a polite way of telling her to stay in her place!
I believe Biden will take NC. Not sure on GA yet.
The Black woman is "too ambitious" for daring to run for POTUS once. Meanwhile, Biden unsuccessfully ran for POTUS multiple times before Obama picked him and was never once referred to as "too ambitious"

I don‚Äôt know about the rest of you Taxpayers but Joe Biden wants to Forgive Collage Loans for the very people who are Burning our Country Flag and Toppling History. Not ME !!!
We‚Äôre dealing with an existential threat right now known as Donald Trump. Whether it‚Äôs Biden, Sanders or Warren, it will take either one a while to clean up the mess. We‚Äôre gonna play catch-up with the pandemic for months. That has to be addressed before we can do anything else.
I wanted someone that would push an agenda like FDR and that person was Warren.   Now that she is outta the race - let me say this, and knowing first hand directly the dysfunction with this administration   Biden would get us back to having a functional government
2/Biden will, at least, deliver some goods, even if it‚Äôs not all of what we want. He also won‚Äôt allow the pandemic to go unchecked.
1/That‚Äôs what they don‚Äôt seem too get. Biden sounds more progressive now than I thought he would. Yes, I rather he be a Sanders/Warren progressive, and I want corporate money out of politics, but we‚Äôll get absolutely none of what we want with Trump.
A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump.

Actually China is closer to Facism than Communism with their One China platform. Sounds a lot like hitler. Which makes their biggest supporter, Joe Biden, Mussolini.
Two other polls released today show Biden with double digit   leads, 56% to 43% Biden favorability and 53% to 42% Biden favorability. Something just doesn't jive here...
Judd, you seem well informed and a very smart man. Tell me something.  Today Rasmussen Polling has Trump's favorability at 51%, Biden at 47%?  How can that be even remotely possible? Are Americans truly that stupid and that ignorant? Is Rasmussen only polling closeted racists?
Actually, Joe Biden is only the figurehead. The man in charge would actually be Barrack Obama. Take a look at the people running the Biden campaign. There can never be a debate because everyone would see and hear that Biden is incapable of performing the duties of President.
Watch and see,Biden won‚Äôt debate!
So that's why Biden's ties with Ukraine was never headlined? Because he's rich...or is it because he's in politics? You're saying you've never heard of a rich person being charged with any crime's...ever?

*3 months into presidency* ‚Äúpresident biden has reportedly signed an executive order removing the need for passwords. says that they are too hard to remember and can‚Äôt get into any of his accounts anymore.‚Äù
At this point Biden knows we don‚Äôt have a choice but to vote for him. NO CHOICE. It‚Äôs basically like he‚Äôs running against himself.
Keep in mind, Joe Biden has been running for president since 1987. And still... only 106 references to him as "too ambitious." If I include articles that mention Hillary Clinton, it goes up to 154.  13/
I searched  for "Candidate Name" + "too ambitious." Here are the results:  Al Gore: 18 Joe Biden: 106* John Kerry: 112 G.W. Bush: 150 Mitt Romney: 176 Donald Trump: 380* Barack Obama: 707* Hillary Clinton: 1,166  *Excludes ones that refer to Hillary Clinton
I'm not too concerned about any of this having an effect on Biden's decision. He's been in the game long enough, he knows how it's played.
Kind of like that Politico from the other day where Chris Dodd said she shouldn't be VP because she was mean to Biden at a debate one time.
Important to note that these are literally just Biden donors/allies who are all mad about Harris for Reasons and don't want her to be VP.
Just wondering if they have ever asked the same question of Biden supporters????
I see what you‚Äôre saying. But there is just no way I‚Äôm voting for Biden and whatever corrupt POS gets named his running mateüòÇ Bc we all now that senile son of a bitch won‚Äôt last two weeks
With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has announced he will choose his running mate next week.US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election
I agree, but suppose we turn out and they inform us in a couple days that Biden lost? What then? Because if we allow a second term Putin may teach him how to never have to leave office. What do we do then? I hope it doesn‚Äôt happen, but if it does‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Quit being cruel to Biden...
Biden will never be president... stop wishing...
Biden:  ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make me call Corn Pop‚Äù  ‚ÄúHey little girl, do you want to feel my legs?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWow, you smell good.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWho stole my pudding?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhose house am I in?‚Äù
Biden:  ‚Äúwell, you smooth talking negros better get your act together. Cause you ain‚Äôt black unless you vote for my old white butt‚Äù  Public: ‚Äúwow, that seems really racist. We better ask a professional.  Rev. Sharpton, what do you think?‚Äù  Al: ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok. That honky is a democrat‚Äù
If you claim to be a Republican and you vote for Joe Biden....  Your not a Republican.  Your not a conservative.  Don‚Äôt lie to people. Just admit you call yourself a Republican but are really a big govt progressive who is happy with keeping the DC game alive
No AG Barr arrest on Obama or Biden. They're above the law.
Trump will and is cheating to try and become a two term illegitimate president. But the stable people will not allow this to happen, trump will lose in the largest landslide Biden victory.
This is a shameful attack on a good man, no one believes trump; however this is a bridge too far. Trump does not deserve to be anywhere near Vice President Biden. Trump is sick and needs to be hospitalized!
Electing more and more democrats. American has some serious issues that‚Äôs been around long before trump. Don‚Äôt u wanna make this a better place for all? Biden can‚Äôt do that on his own. It‚Äôs our responsibility. Kicking back letting elected officials do whatever is what got us here
No AG Barr arrest on Biden. Democrats are above the law.
Wow.  And you still claim to be a ‚Äúconservative‚Äù?  You know the debates will expose Biden to a national audience and they will see that you and the democrats are pushing a dementia patient for the most powerful position in the world.  If this happens why even have elections?
Hahahahaha   You said logical and Biden in the same sentence.
Excuse me but should I vote for him (Biden) because he was Obama‚Äôs Vice President? Should I vote for him because if I dont it will be a vote for Trump? Somebody anybody help me out here..
If you are voting for Joe Biden May I ask why?
Biden has too many old, white men like himself involved in the process and it‚Äôs not a good look. I will support whoever he chooses but I think he needs someone younger than Bass. In 2024 she‚Äôll be 70‚Äì aren‚Äôt we ready to pick someone younger than that to run for POTUS in 2024?
Yes. I like Joe Biden as President.
Joe Biden will have to earn my vote. He must change his policies. At this point it is what it is. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èYou are NOT worthy of the Black vote and how dare you attack Joe Biden‚Äôs faith. Fact: You stoke fear and racial divisions with your racist rhetoricYou are a Demagogue and you will be defeated in November. The virus is winning because of the choices you have made.
Please ‚Äúsilence‚Äù Biden.
One of the coolest byproducts of this is that it's forcing Christian supporters of Biden/Trump to discuss pros/cons Biblically.  Had a very painful discussion, no argument with a "woman be quiet" believer this morning.  Just dawned on me that a female VP will just kill him?!?!

So biden calls trump out for stopping  flights and now biden is saying trump did not do enough earlier ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£  How do you support such   Democrats and Republicans are the same. They just take from opposite pockets
Oh you mean the poor kids and the white kids? You know... the thing??? ü§£ü§£ü§£ Trump has done more for minorities than any other president. As Biden put it, y'all believe the "truth" instead of facts. What a sad sad world we live in.
And how do y'all think Biden would have handled this? Remember... Trump was the one called a xenophobe for stopping those flights. He said he wished we could do something like those things to get rid of it. And the advice at the time was to save masks for first responders.
This is disrespectful on so many levels. Biden cannot hide his disdain for the Black community.
Biden just said racist remarks today. So Ohio wants that? No
Why is Biden for killing babies then? God is against murder I guess Biden is for it.
Biden didn‚Äôt come out against burning bibles!!
You think Biden goes to bed without watching Colbert? Hah.
Monday is what I think but I‚Äôm entering my official guess as Saturday at like 7am EST because Biden probably mows his lawn then. Waking me up. Fucking old dudes, man.
I don‚Äôt understand the question. Do people really not know what this means? There‚Äôs so many things you can say about Biden but remembering his dad‚Äôs driving fondly is weird? Oof. How embarrassing to be so sheltered and DSA? A group supposedly for the worker?
She claims Biden would talk down to her during meetings but it turned out she worked in the mailroom, a position she would not have been in meeting with him or have daily contact with him.
She worked in the mail room and was fired for throwing mail away. She never had daily contact with Biden.
Biden must be pretty powerful if he can hurt God tbf.
Because he‚Äôs Joe Biden. Now open pdf.
Tell me again how it's a good idea for Biden to debate Trump. Remember what I said would happen? Yeah this shit right here is a perfect example. Foot in mouth. He has always been this way folks! Smdh üôÑ

Obama-Biden did NOT spy on the Rump Campaign. FAKE News and we have the facts to prove my Rump AH wrong!!!
Doesn't matter what Trump says. It's what Biden might say that I'm worried about.
Yeah I dunno. Joe ‚ÄùGaff Machine‚Äù Biden on the debate stage seems like an unnecessary risk considering current polling. ü§î
I dunno. They seem desperate for debates (prolly bc they expect Biden will put this foot in his mouth like he usually does) but Trump doesn't want to release the returns. Would be interesting to see what they decided to do if Joe gave that ultimatum.
Biden should make all debates contingent upon Trump releasing his tax returns. üí°
Lmao ppl hating on Trump and so naive how ridiculous Biden is talking.. shows ppl voting for Biden is completely oblivious and doesn‚Äôt care for the future of our country.. Go Trump!! Going to destroy Biden when they debate
If you are still voting for Biden then you ain‚Äôt American..
With all regards to our Democratic friends, how could they, in true conscience, vote for Mr. Biden?
Not voting for Biden is a vote for trump so not voting for trump is a vote for Biden!
There are pictures of Biden fingering Tara Reade???! Or are you referring to him touching the shoulders of a woman? To go from that to fingering is a big leap. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Doesn't matter what Biden would do in such an interview.  All Biden has to do is NOT be Trump and let Trump be Trump.  That is the winning strategy.
I never fully trusted  and yes, her voting record is problematic - and her support for #Biden even more so. But IMO she's still far better than Yang.
Every Response Biden makes during the debates should begin, "Mr. Trump, didn't you previously say...."  Let the debates focus on what Trump has said and NOT done during the last 3.5 years.

C'mon - what's the real reason you won't watch?  Anything to do with having your belief system replaced with a little TRUTH?  I hear Biden's gonna narrate some of it - but the slur makes it hard to figure out what he's saying.

Surely 4 more years of Trump will fix that! You‚Äôre right! If you think Biden was my choice you‚Äôre wrong. I just live in the constant reality of -NOW-.  You realize tourniquets can and often result in amputation but they keep you alive right?
Biden is a liar, he would raise taxes even higher than that!!!
Exactly where did Krystal tell us to vote for #Biden?

She doesn't actually name #Biden in that video, but she does in this tweet:

Big deal.  We fill stadiums with rock bands and sports events.  And you don't get it do you?  All Biden has to do to win is NOT be Trump.  That's  it.  That's  why people  will vote for Biden.
I have to say, she and Biden seem to have an great chemistry, but to have her as Attorney General would be an excellent move. She knows the law, stands by it and has the lady balls to be great at it.

Thanks again Nancy for stalling, not working with republicans and waiting until the last damn minute to negotiate. You and your pathetic party really care about the American people. I pray Biden loses big to Trump .
You got to remember a lot people on the left were behind Sanders and not Biden. And we all saw what the DNC did. That's why they have Biden instead of Sanders. But deep down i dont think they really do hate America.
In any case, the response to either #Trump or #Biden is identical. #Revolution
God help us if Biden wins. But he's getting so bad, they will probably remove him, and insert who they really want last minute. One who was not voted in.
Lol I‚Äôm going to feel bad for Biden going against Trump when the presidential debate starts.. yet again I‚Äôm not..this guy is going to get destroyed lmao.. Go Trump!!
If #Biden even wins.
Also, credit where credit is due: #AyannaPresley, Warrenite üêç though she was, has also not endorsed #Biden so far. I have not been a fan of Presley, and still am not, but I hope she will follow #RashidaTlaib in explicitly declining to endorse #Biden.
There's actually a lot of truth to this. I read an article about "comfort" and while Sanders may have had a more disruptive message of necessary change, people want "comfort" like Biden, exactly like "elect him and everything will be OK again"

Ultimately, none of this matters.   Undecided or swing voters have turned off vast majority of press. These voters will watch debates, look for big speeches or major moments in October...and 95% of those will be Trump or Biden.

Harris makes case against Trump in first speech as Biden's running mate

I also think that it‚Äôs interesting that the Kamala and Biden walk off song was ‚Äúmove on up‚Äù by Curtis mayfield - which was also sampled by Kanye West for ‚ÄúTouch The Sky.‚Äù Who some have called Trump‚Äôs shadow running mate. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs intentional but still funny.
And yet, I can hear the Stelter‚Äôs, Cilliza‚Äôs, and Navarro‚Äôs of this world having multiple orgasms over the unserious allegations. Plus, it‚Äôs more clear now, Biden is a placeholder.
It‚Äôs weird to see people being unable to hold hands and hug in this announcement and official bringing together of Biden and Harris. It looks like a blind first date that went well but ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt know you like that... yet.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs keep it a buck. We hitched our wagon to Biden, the weakest candidate, even though he did NOTHING to earn our vote besides stand next to President Obama.   So weak that he NEEDED a woman of color (Kamala) on the ticket with him and his chances are STILL shaky.
What I meant was that Biden wasn‚Äôt my first choice to win the Democratic candidate nomination, it was originally Bernie Sanders. But I‚Äôm going to vote for him now because we got to get what‚Äôs already in the White House OUT of the White House.

I‚Äôm not sure Biden counts, because he was never formally a candidate. You can‚Äôt lose if you don‚Äôt play.  I think the answer is no. Mondale (1984), Bush (1988), and Gore (2000) all had to fight for their nominations, but they got them.

Biden has also been accused of sexual assault and Kamala Harris has publicly stated that she believes his accusers, so like I have said...everyone politician has something. You have decided that there are things you are willing to ignore or overlook.

They are! Just bought two yard signs (to replace the two Biden signs I had) and two mugs.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris gonna put every black body in prison
Harris: Do we tell them now? Biden: Let em wait a little while longer. Harris: I think they already knew. #BidenHarris2020
SMART MOVE BIDEN! VERY VERY SMART MOVE!!!
At 4: Biden chooses a running mate.  joins us with the story.
Kamala Harris has been selected to be Biden‚Äôs running mate. How do you feel ?
I accept Kamala as the the vp. She has her flaws, but then again, I believe any other candidate Biden could've picked would also have flaws. She's not my choice but im not upset about it. Just a little dissapointed.
At a debate Kamala chewed him up. Yet Biden chose a critic and a straight talker to be his VP. Strong leaders like dissenting voices.  (and Oh she is a strong woman too)
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate    Twitter had #VPpick as a trend and upon clicking it I was shown only a few tweets that were vulgar racism and sexism attacks on Kamala.   I think Twitter  is broken.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! Let‚Äôs Go Joe and Kampala!!!! Biden/Harris 2020!! It‚Äôs clear now!! November can‚Äôt get here soon enough!!!  Jackson, Mississippi
So she doesn‚Äôt think Biden is a racist anymore?
Some of y'all praise  on a Monday and throw  under the bus on a Tuesday. Weird to see. REMINDER: Twitter isn't the Real world. Only 17% of Wisconsinites polled wanted to "defund the police" in today's Marquette poll. GREAT PICK BIDEN!
Joe Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
This is what is needed in the White House though is it not?   Have a VP to hold the president accountable instead of blindly following everything he does. I originally wished Biden would pick a right-leaning moderate as VP to help unify ever-so-slightly.  Kamala isn‚Äôt a bad #2.
Live Coverage: Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
After you and other democrats crushed it? Does Kamala still think Biden is a racist? Or has she changed her mind from 4 months again?
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate  (Via WJTV 12)
Didn‚Äôt she call Biden a racist??
I hope she holds Biden accountable like this in office.  Something Pence doesn‚Äôt do for DJT.
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate  via
Joe Biden in a desperate attempt to salvage the black vote selects Kamala as his running mate Politricks...
So can we get rid of Biden and just have Kamala?
It‚Äôs no secret that I was really hoping for Warren to be tapped. I voted for her in the primary and really wanted to see her name on the ballot again. But that doesn‚Äôt diminish my elation at see that Biden chose Kamala Harris. A powerhouse team üí™ #BidenHarris2020
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
Former Vice President Joe Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 running mate, making her the first Black woman on major party presidential ticket.
I‚Äôll be honest, I really wanted Warren. But I‚Äôm still elated to see Biden choose Harris! That‚Äôs a powerhouse team and I can‚Äôt wait to see Harris demolish Pence in a debate üí™

Hey  who do you think Biden is gonna pick for VP
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is expected to announce his pick for vice president, as early as today, according to CNN.
Maybe the Big 10 resigned to become Biden‚Äôs VP pick.
Not my first choice, but it won‚Äôt change my mind in voting for Biden.
BREAKING: Joe Biden selects his running mate with announcement coming as early as Tuesday
Hidin' Biden? I would have gone with "Tickle Me Biden" but that also works too.
How about Obama spying on trump all the Biden‚Äôs should be investigated and locked up with Hillary
Slow maybe he‚Äôs not scared of his shadow and run and hide in his basement like biden it shows strength not stupidity we need a president that has courage not stupidity üëá
My VP pick? Karl Malone. Biden needs someone with some consistency and reach. With "The Mailman" you get that, and since the USPS is an election year issue, the nickname helps. Plus, he's from Louisiana, helping with southern votes, and COULD finally turn Utah.
And they give Biden a pass when he consistently loses his place in the middle of his own sentences, and they even try to justify his nonsensical word salads which are often reeking of racism.
I‚Äôll still vote for Biden in the fall, like we have a choice, but I will burn the establishment down for the next midterms and draft  to primary them in 2024, because no one in the running to be VP would be so disloyal to run against them in 24 if they weren‚Äôt picked.
She never said he didn't, she just basically told Eric that while he was busy laughing at what Robin said about Biden , he should look at what he said about Trump ,too.
Wow! That Biden kid is carrying quite a bit of baggage. üò≥
Where‚Äôs their masks? Doesn‚Äôt matter when you‚Äôre on Biden‚Äôs short bus!
It‚Äôs 100% true and you know it! You‚Äôre just to left to face the facts! Biden has twonyears tops before he‚Äôs full blown lost!
Now do Joe Biden...
We don‚Äôt own the Biden residence. The WH is publicly owned and shouldn‚Äôt be politicized.  Plus it‚Äôs illegal.
It could be a snail, I‚Äôm still voting for Biden.
kamala harris is not a good person stop pushing biden to pick her as vp you blind bastards
I‚Äôd vote for Biden if he picked a can of tuna fish.
Mr. Jay White.  He's complaining about not having any options other than Biden.  I'm saying, what has Trump done that's made his life worse the last 4 yrs.
If  picks Whitmer, well, it won‚Äôt be good, if he picks anyone other than Harris, I‚Äôll be done with the party establishment 4 good, I‚Äôll vote for Biden in November, but I‚Äôll be working for the drafting of candidacy of  in 2024 for President. #ChooseUnity #ChooseWisely
You say I'm not black enough if I don't vote for Biden, and then they say I'm a know sellout if I sided for Trump. I don't like neither one of them Mfs. And, for my vote it really doesn't matter. Because it's basis on popular and electoral shit that is rigged. .....üßëüßëüí©ü§°
He‚Äôs a biden voter
Don‚Äôt confuse aging for not seeming bright. Biden knows how it works. Notice he doesn‚Äôt take the obvious shots at Mitch, chances are if elected he‚Äôs gonna have to finesse a Republican Senate.
I was a Harris supporter, but she couldn‚Äôt meet her moment when she had the opportunity. Also, there seems to have been some issues with Maya(her sister) and her campaign staff. Also a female Obama doesn‚Äôt work, I like her at DOJ that‚Äôs the dream job in a Biden administration.
Below I will list a variety of Presidential candidates as well as what party they're running as and a link to their platform. I was originally planning on waiting for Biden to choose a running mate but apparently that's never going to happen.
Yeah. Biden would have an alert  on the highway when he forgets who he is and where he is going
Still being a sore, insecure loser, I see? Joe Biden needs to do better, but tell your fellow Republicans to do WAYYYY better.
She‚Äôs whacko! He literal extended the federal unemployment for all of the Michiganders she put in the unemployment portal! She‚Äôs just pissed he‚Äôs leading from the front and not sniffing Biden‚Äôs rear end!
If the ACC cancels, Biden could try to pick up Notre Dame.
The VP pick is  decision.  Tweets that divide the party around that choice are counterproductive - especially as he has said he has made up his mind.  To defeat Trump, we should stand united behind the Biden and her ticket.  #Whomever.
I doubt any will see this, but, I am a 60ish black male. Anybody else think Biden could sharpen his image up a bit with a haircut. ( i.e. tapered around ears and neck? ) I realize it has nothing to do with character, but the hair bothers me.
Just cause I‚Äôm black who said anything about Biden
I believe Trump‚Äôs presence on the right emboldens an equally authoritarian response from the left. If he‚Äôs left in office they‚Äôll be no room for left-center or right-center. That‚Äôs the importance of Biden in this case.
Every country on earth except Russia would prefer Joe Biden
I‚Äôm not ignorant of our voting system. Republicans and democrats will both destroy America, just in different ways.   Just curious where do you get 1.3% from? You can‚Äôt blame people voting 3rd party for Biden‚Äôs potential loss. If he can‚Äôt get the votes to win then that‚Äôs on him.
If I didn‚Äôt vote for her, it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference. I just wouldn‚Äôt be voting in that case. I‚Äôm not going to vote for someone (Biden/Trump) who are extremely questionable, who‚Äôs policies I don‚Äôt agree with, and who perpetrate the same corrupt political machine in the States.
U.S. intelligence assessed that China is hoping President Donald Trump does not win reelection, while Russia is working to denigrate Democrat Joe Biden.

#LetHerSpeak at the debates! She missed one morning campaign rally in Jackson MS and was back on the trail that afternoon in Hattiesburg.  Meanwhile Biden is MIA and trump hides in the bunker signing unconstitutional orders. #voteVold #LetHerDebate
You can easily same the same for any other candidate. Voting for Biden or Trump won‚Äôt accomplish anything more than it would voting for her. It‚Äôs not about making a statement as much as me voting for someone who I consciously agree with. A vote for someone is simply a vote.
I never suggested that Biden didn't help write the Crime bill.  Biden didn't make racist District Attorney push 3 strike rules. Biden didn't make states across country adopt three strike rules. Our criminal justice system has needed rehauling  for years. I practiced criminal law.
You really think Joe Biden will do a good job? He doesn‚Äôt even know what fucking day it is! Also, why is an article about providing more made in a America products prompting you to profess your hatred for America? We need less liberal cancer like you in this country!
West himself has hinted he may be in the race to detract from Biden. When an interviewer from Forbes suggested as much in a text message Thursday, West responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not denying it.‚Äù

How can anyone - progressive or not - want a person with senile dementia like Joe Biden to have his hand on a nuclear trigger?
The Left are masters.   Clinton had a vulnerability. Russia, The uranium, speaking fees, foundation.  The solution, call Trump a Russian. They are doing it again.  Why? Because Biden has been an agent of every country but America and his family have made millions for his betrayal
and   could just get up and batter Biden in a Debate for a Better America.   The Press could not resist the eyeballs it would bring.
Any day Biden just tell us who the Veep is! Today is your chance to steal the wind from trumptard
Sex is good but have you ever imagined Biden making Hillary Clinton Secy of State again and seeing her walking into the UN with Susan Rice and Samantha Power on her flanks. Putin would faint!!!! The bitch is BACK! üòç
Never mentioned Biden, he talked about the present political climate from the perspective of what LEWIS wanted for America. Stop with the snake oil.
Really it‚Äôs fuck trump AND biden
He has been a part of the swamp for decades, he comes off much more competent than the Biden.   His politics are even better than the leftist puppet Biden has becomel
. Roman Catholics are voting for Trump en masse.  Biden and Pelosi‚Äôs claims of faith don‚Äôt matter.  They‚Äôre avowed secularists, clearly.  Kamala Harris will pay for her transgressions against the Knights of Columbus if she‚Äôs nominated.
Joe Biden got the keys to the Indians twitter or what?
. I worry about the Pacific Supply Chain if Biden is elected.  The only U.S. Pacific port that isn‚Äôt deep Blue politically is Coos Bay, Oregon.
is racist garbage! Biden will still get 99 percent of the African American vote.
and this is someone who is so delusional to believe Biden is a good candidate, or even really mentally incapable of serving out his term. Let him come out and answer questions on policy, on how he would address the Pandemic, on Policing issues. Not through press releases

I absolutely love Ana! She is a huge Joe Biden supporter and she will be great in this role!
So the ‚ÄúGRABBER‚Äù thinks he can speak for AAs. Not offended by what Biden said but I am offended by what you just implied. You don‚Äôt think for AAs, and we know you hate them. SOBs, Cent Park 5, don‚Äôt rent to (C) coloreds, no AAs counting your money, the suburbs, etc....
I read the transcript of Biden‚Äôs original garbled remarks. I see what he was imprecisely trying to say. I see why Black citizens could take offense. He apologized. He clarified.  What else can he do? This bullshit Dennis is doing is just that.
Biden should ask him at the debate if he was thinking of Stormie Daniels when he misspoke Thighland.
Biden said a racist thing
That's pretty much right. Trumpers try to claim Biden has low mental abilities, while Trump flutters around like a deranged cuckoo bird.
Just have questions selected,  let President Trump answer and play videos of biden o the topics
I would crawl over broken glass. I would wait however long it takes to cast a vote for Biden #RidenWithBiden2020
If Joe Biden does not debate, ask a group of reporters to select questions and just playback Joe's stupid gaffes about the subject.
It is a damn shame that they are promoting and pushing Joe Biden,who obviously has dementia. That's elderly abuse. He will not debate you because it will expose the shell of a person he is.

Joe Biden lost his wife and a child in an accident after he first became a senator. More recently, he lost a son to brain cancer. I bet he has prayed to God a million times or more.  I know this: Only God can answer prayer. Only God gets to choose who is against Him!
Your dear leader benefits from an economy that Obama built. BTW black unemployment had the biggest drop under Obama. Facts! What Biden hasn‚Äôt  done is refer to AA‚Äôs as SOBs and ask for the death penalty for five innocent ppl or not rent to ‚ÄúC‚Äôs‚Äù.
I say to Joe Biden it‚Äôs Easy to be a Bleedinfheart when your giving Away Taxpayers Money. Illegal people should Get ZERO from our Government except a criminal charge and put on the Mexican side of the Wall that President Trump is building!!!  That‚Äôs IT !!!

Keep in mind that these looters are Joe Biden's voter base.
Who or¬†What¬†Exactly Is Running Against Trump? The inner-Biden at 77 is turning out to be an unabashed bigot in the age of ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù and thought crimes that has apparently declared him immune from the opprobrium reserved for any such speech.
Because they don't post anything negative to Joe Biden. Twitter and all other social media has their priorities. Children are on that list.
As a brain aneurysm survivor I agree Biden should not be President
Two things can be true: Biden is not your first, second, or eighth choice AND you can fight like hell for him because 5 out of 5 dictators recommend his alternative.
The fact you think Biden will win is funny,  Oh mis amigos eres muy divertido
Truth Is, Biden Never Had a Firm Grip on Reality.
Defending ‚ÄòNew Europe‚Äô from Old Europe‚Äôs Woke.   In the name of ‚Äústrengthening democracy‚Äù in Central Europe, Joe Biden‚Äôs clueless policies would undermine democracy and NATO, too.  By¬†Clark S. Judge¬†‚Ä¢¬†August 8, 2020
I don't know if you are part of Joe's campaign strategy but he needs to be care what he is saying, a lot of 2nd amendment supporters are swinging toward Biden. And monitor his tweets about spun stories, we need him to win, it's very important he calculateshis platfrm

No really - What if Biden picks  for VP? I'm just protecting the Presidency (besides, I think the CFR discriminates against women). üòé
Note the date - 2019 - before Covid19 - you had run up the deficit with absolutely nothing to show for it - but a tax cut for billionaires &amp; 30 miles of falling down fence - Joe Biden knows how to address the essential needs of Americans and protect and secure America's future.
Sorry about bombarding with photos just trying to show how ridiculous the Biden claims are.
Those Biden pics are no more ridiculous than this, stop acting like hypocrites.
The Libertarian Party Presidential Candidate is only here to assist Joe Biden. Have you bothered to read her policy views relating to Black Lives Matter? The current Libertarian Party is little different from every leftist group. They want unlimited illegal immigration.

Biden:  "Any rock that doesn't vote for me isn't truly a rock."
She's  trying  to give cover to Biden, absolutely and so very obvious. She's an Obumberler sicko.
No sir. Donald inherited the Obama-Biden era economy and brags that he got it in order. Please do some research on this.
If they are that stupid, let them vote for a documented racist and fool, Donald Trump... Donald Trump mocks, criticizes and ridicules and he becomes more popular. Biden says virtually nothing that is significant and the press makes a mountain out of molehill.. Do your job media.
Joe Biden is doing a wonderful job of denigrating himself.
Joe Biden's voter base.
When I heard Trump saying that Biden is coming after your guns and religion, I  laughed. When he said that Biden hates and wants to hurt god, I was completely dumbfounded by the desperation of the blasphemer-in-chief. How do religious Republicans stand for this?
I can't listen to Biden either, I don't think he knows what planet he's on
Because we know that Joe Biden needs assistance to clean himself after going to the bathroom.
Biden doesn't know what planet he's on.  Why hasn't our Party given us someone we can stand behind, instead you've given us a racist old politician with no leadership ability and has never accomplished anything in 40 years. WHY? Please offer us a worthy candidate.
The Shadow of Dukakis Looms Over Biden.   Biden‚Äôs lead is shrinking as questions about his fitness for the presidency multiply.
Biden lost me as a voter
Come on man!! No way is Joe Biden writing these tweets!!!
Not according to joe Biden
Joe Biden today literally was just racist towards to black community
Biden: "If you don't vote for me - You're not Mexican"?
Biden is senile..pass it on
Joe Biden and Bill Clinton showed everyone how they felt about the black and Latino communities in 1994 with the 1994 crime Bill. After Clinton signed the Bill Biden wrote! Tell me more how democrats love people of color
If your right and maybe you are, Why is Biden the best you have to offer, If your serious about us and what we deserve then step up and present someone that's competent. We do deserve better, Your shoving a racist man with no leadership ability down our throats and its scary
Wow, the lies have an extra hint of desperation these days...he will ‚Äúoutlaw religion‚Äù and ‚Äúhurt God?‚Äù There are literally dozens of pictures of Biden praying, and I‚Äôm pretty sure the only times Trump went to church were for his multiple marriages.Only way he may improves my life is the lack of environmentalism and sustainability under him GROWS under Biden in a few years when I‚Äôm done with my degree and there‚Äôs plenty of job opportunity.
And yet, using a large platform   you proudly proclaimed you would not be voting for Biden over his....policies? Man, wtf JackO, how can you defend this position seeing the direction of the country the last four years? It‚Äôs a two horse race my guy
Does this mean he will close and put out of business the rest of outdoor dining restaurants, too? What about people jogging/biking/playing outside? This is crazy! Masks should be worn when social distancing is not possible. Biden will collapse our country.
FOX needs to start calling out Biden daily and pressuring him to do an interview with Bret Baier or Harris Faulkner
Biden would have taken out Corn Pop
After President Donald Trump attacked his challenger Joe Biden over affordable housing, Democrats have slammed his statements as racist.
Trump and Biden singing "It's 5 o'clock somewhere" together at the first debate would really unite the country, IMO.

She was phone banking and called a Black grandmother, asking if she would vote for Biden-Harris. The 91-year-old woman burst into tears, because it was the first time she'd learned Joe Biden had picked Kamala Harris‚Äîa black woman. Read the thread.
The bishop said it is the "first time in a while" there hasn't been a Catholic. So please explain how Biden isn't Catholic but Tim Kaine, Paul Ryan, John Kerry, etc. are.

he Mississippi Democratic Party is responding to Senator Kamala Harris being chosen to be the running mate of former Vice President Joe Biden.
I won't say the primaries are "rigged" because 1) Biden was popular and might have gotten it even if we had same day/ranked choice voting and 2) I don't believe the Dems are that organized.
I mean, our primary system is totally screwed up and a lot of people didn't get a chance to vote for their preferred candidate. But it doesn't matter because Biden/Harris is who we have, so VOTE
I WAS WRONG: I searched "Hillary Clinton"+"baggage," but not "Hillary Rodham." She actually SURPASSES George W:  Hillary: 28,595 Bush 43: 21,017 Trump: 15,273 E. Dole: 4,438 Biden: 3,478 Condi Rice: 2,879 Bernie: 2,488 Palin: 2,371 Warren: 1,585   33/
Because Biden reminded people that Trump called white supremacists fine people? Ok.
Now it‚Äôs personal, huh? It wasn‚Äôt personal when they made things up about Biden‚Äôs son, I guess. And what hoax? It‚Äôs what Trump said.
Biden must have forgot to take his meds at the right time and they are waiting for him to be mildly coherent before walking him out. They should just let Heelz Up Harris come out and fluff the crowd. #PeePadsAndKneePads #maga #BidenHarris2020

I‚Äôve seen a few tweets lately addressing Biden‚Äôs Catholicism vs Trump‚Äôs...whatever his supposed religiosity is (mainlineish Protestantism, maybe?). My standpoint: neither man has a strong claim to Christianity, so it‚Äôs a silly argument.
Unless they‚Äôre trying to pull the more radical progressives who ain‚Äôt exactly enamored with Biden back into showing up and voting. Problem is Harris is not wholly attractive to such folks.
Some of yall are down playing Biden and Harris and don‚Äôt know the difference between the 3 branches of govt. Please sit this conversation out.
First question to Harris..You said Joe Biden is a racist and you believed his accusers of sexual assault what has changed?
Think Reagan (Trump) vs Mondale (Biden) in 84...
Presumptive Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday. But who is Harris, exactly? Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the VP nominee:
People using ‚ÄúJoe Biden is racist‚Äù as a reason to keep Trump in office when Trump‚Äôs dad was a whole ass KKK member.   It‚Äôs giving me delusional.
Incredibly, Elizabeth Warren, who has only served as a senator since 2013 and ran for president once, already has half as many "baggage" stories as Joe Biden, and trails Bernie (a 30-year congressman/senator+2x POTUS candidate) by fewer than 1,000 results. 22/
Incredibly, Elizabeth Dole, the wife of 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole, has 1,000 more "baggage" stories than 3x POTUS candidate Biden. She has 2x as many baggage stories as 2x POTUS candidate Bernie, who has been in Congress since 1991.  She merely *considered* running in 2000. 19/
Joe Biden, who has been in the U.S. Senate since the 1970s and run for president three times now (&amp; spent four years as VP) has about ‚Öô as many "baggage" stories as Hillary Clinton, who came into the national spotlight as Dem nominee Bill Clinton's spouse in 1992. 18/
And yes, there are articles about men's baggage. I searched  for [candidate first+last name] + [baggage]  Bush 43: 21,017 Hillary: 19,943 Trump: 15,273 E. Dole: 4,438 Biden: 3,478 Condoleezza Rice: 2,879 Bernie: 2,488 Sarah Palin: 2,371 Warren: 1,585  16/
Shades of 84 election, with Biden playing the role of Mondale
Trump is to Reagan as Biden is to Mondale
Kamala Harris is "mopie [sic], depressing, nasty" &amp; "will be more baggage for the very frail Biden to carry," writes New York radio host   I'm reminded of the time Donald Trump, another blatant sexist, called Hillary Clinton a "nasty woman" during a 2016 debate. 12/
Now, Kamala is also racking up the "baggage" headlines. Shortly after Biden's announcement, the Washington Times ran this treasure on the left.  But hey, at least it's "Kamala's Baggage." In 2016, the Examiner wrote about "Bill's Clinton's Baggage for Hillary." (right) 3/
Whoever is pulling his strings picked her because of her skin color. We all know Joe Biden is Alzheimer‚Äôs to the past of no return!
at this point, it‚Äôs either Biden or Trump and honestly i‚Äôll rather deal with Biden for the next 4 years than having to deal with Trump‚Äôs bullshit
biden just blew me.
Question: Do you think Sen. Kamala Harris as Biden's V.P. nominee will help him by firing up his base, or hurt him with moderates who see them as too liberal, or make little difference? #BidenHarris2020
Choose better phrasing. ‚ÄúTaps‚Äù isn‚Äôt a great choice given the sexual connotations... ‚ÄúIn Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate‚Äù
Pre-emptive grievance politics on the left is something.   Biden announced Kamala Harris, who will be the first Black or Asian VP nom for a major party.  The rush to lament how you'll now be "smeared as a racist &amp; sexist, akin to Hitler" for the next 4-12 years is... interesting.
Joe Biden can barely put two sentences together! How‚Äôs he going to do anything? He is absolutely NOT what our country needs!!! Trump has done more for this country in the last four years than that man has done in his entire life!!
A Kamala day keeps the Biden away.
Biden picks Kamala Harris for VP. She will be the first African American woman nominated for VP by a Major Party. Kamala Harris will join Sarah Palin and Geraldine Ferraro on the short list of woman nominated by a major party for Vice President.
Say his name! His name is Bernell Tremmell and he died simply for his political beliefs. Say his name! He doesn‚Äôt fit blm‚Äôs agenda so the left will fail to acknowledge his existence. If this was reversed and he had a Biden sign there would be chaos. Double standards are SAD!
Hey   I'm having trouble deciding on a Biden/Harris' ticket name. Your a sharp guy.   'Sleepy Joe &amp; Kamala Blow' Or 'Basement Biden &amp; Heels up Harris'  Go take the poll
I think we can all agree we should probably settle on the official name of the Biden/Harris ticket. #maga #wwg1wga
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.

#BREAKING: Biden selects Kamala Harris as running mate&gt;&gt;
JUST IN: Joe Biden has chosen California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
True for this election, but kind of bigger than usual when you consider Biden would not run as an incumbent (probably)
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is expected to announce his pick for vice president, as early as today, according to CNN.
I dont get the acceptance speech controversy? Didn't Dr Fauci tell us all to stay home if we didn't have to go out?  Where does Mr Trump live?  Would they be pissed if Biden gave his speech from his basement? #maga
Obama/Biden had complete control with a super majority for two years to pass anything he wanted and all he barely do was ACA
Gosh, I just can't figure out why people don't have a visceral hatred for Biden like they did for Clinton, it's such a mystery.
Biden in 1985 used the N word to refer to remarks another person made. In 2020, TCU‚Äôs head football coach said the word in the same context to tell a player the team will not use that word. The same people voting for Joe Biden are the same people that want TCU‚Äôs head coach fired.
He knows Biden is a bad investment
Biden's campaign refuses to comment on his search, but his team has been in recent contact with a small group of finalists that includes at least four women of color.
Scaramuchi is a nut. Supports Biden because it is best for the republican party he says. I say, the hell with both parties, do what is best for the American people.
Bullshit Biden
I do not care how you feel about Biden, VOTE FOR BIDEN
Vote Biden and he will let you play with the hair on his leg.
If Biden were going to pick a white woman, it would probably be a good idea for him to pick one with more experience than that so as not to piss off the groups that handed him the nomination.
They always say if Trump acted a week earlier how many lives would have been saved.... how many would have died if he waited weeks like Biden would have
Oooohhhh.   Lol I‚Äôm kidding. You can obviously vote for whoever. But ü§Æ at the choices we have between Trump/Biden
We all know Biden didn‚Äôt write this, because nowhere in that tweet thread do the words ‚Äúlook fat, here‚Äôs the deal‚Äù appear.
I am glad you are viewing somethings Biden stands for and says. Do not understand how Christians can back candidates that support anti-christian groups and individuals.
Hey, why don‚Äôt you tell us more about Biden hurting the Bible and hurting God... üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ So tell me how Biden is supposed to hurt the ‚Äúall powerful creator of all‚Äù.. First off stop pretending you‚Äôre religious, second let‚Äôs focus on reality and not fictional characters.. üñïüèº
Biden again praises Latino diversity as being 'unlike the African American community'   He is an Ass. I am Latino. We all migrated from parts of Europe or Africa or Asia where we landed and set up roots may be different but we are the same
WATCH: President Donald Trump accused former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to 'hurt God' during a stop in Ohio on Thursday.
WATCH: President Donald Trump accused former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to 'hurt God' during a stop in Ohio on Thursday.
Lol, right? How powerful must Biden be if he can hurt God?
Everyone is talking about Harris and her policies today and I think it's gonna be really funny if Biden doesn't pick her.Vote for Biden anyway.
I like having a fair and free election that would give Biden a chance to be president. Kamala being the VP nomination means nothing if trump steaks another election.
That‚Äôs cool. The trump one is made in China, and Biden‚Äôs made by union workers.
Not surprised.  Didn‚Äôt his son and Hunter Biden have some ‚Äúdealings‚Äù together?
This is not new and the reason why the GOP is losing members by the thousands. Reasonable people find it appalling what trump has done and now represents the GOP. True republicans must now vote for Biden and Harris to reclaim decency for American!
No no Trump every thinking person will vote for Biden and Harris and there are more that 90% of the thinking population. Trump will lose in a landslide and that includes the popular vote and electoral college. Resign s a name s  a be yourself the embarrassment
Man I‚Äôm scared to fucking vote ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ who the hell yall voting for... cause Biden crooked too ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù-joe biden
We the people feel sorry for you trump. You are sick and need help. The country is better than you and your pathetic followers think, we are moving forward together without you. Biden and Harris 2020.
Electing Biden won‚Äôt be easy. After we finish celebrating Biden‚Äôs VP pick, we should get back to fighting for our right to have a free, open, and fair election. Did you ever think we would be using these words in reference to an American election? We acting like we‚Äôve won already
Yeah, they‚Äôre gonna be a problem should Biden win.
Didn‚Äôt take long to get the establishment teat suckers to start screaming about NO DEBATES.  Next from you and your ilk is....  Biden should just step aside and let Harris be the pick.  Mail in voting.
I agree that just because you don‚Äôt think Trump is doing a good job makes you bad.  I do think that if you believe that Joe Biden can do a better job it just makes you cuckoo ü§™
Look at how racist Joe Biden has been for years. You ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for me. So  if you don‚Äôt vote Dem you not blk. Typical lib attitude.
What has Biden done in his decades in office. Nothing. Lowest blk unemployment tax cuts deregulations. Look at what‚Äôs happening in lib Dem states. Really??
Great show Joy I am over the moon with excitement seeing Kamala Harris selected as the next Vice President. Howard University and an AKA, Biden will restore this nation to respect and with Sen Harris this restoration will happen soon.
Hallelujah! Congrats Ms Harris! Biden/Harris!! Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!!!!
Joe Biden is on the cusp of announcing the biggest, and possibly most consequential, decision of his political career with the unveiling of his running mate.
Doug Jones is the kind of Senator the US needs more of; he has stood by his principles (including voting to impeach) and voted his conscience, knowing it would hurt his re-election chances. I hope he has a spot in the Biden administration.
The Russians are incapable of denegrating Biden worse than he does himself...!
Since he running as a republican wouldn‚Äôt he take away votes for trump there are still a few misguided Blacks who support trump. Informed people regardless of color are voting for Biden. Trump must be soundly defeated!
Nothing can make me vote for trump. The only 2 things that would make me not vote for joe Biden is if he dies before the election or if we were to find out he‚Äôs a pediphile. Other than those, I‚Äôm riding with joe.
Joe Biden ? Yeah right üòÇüòÇ
US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election
I agree, but suppose we turn out and they inform us in a couple days that Biden lost? What then? Because if we allow a second term Putin may teach him how to never have to leave office. What do we do then? I hope it doesn‚Äôt happen, but if it does‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Quit being cruel to Biden...
Biden will never be president... stop wishing...
Biden:  ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make me call Corn Pop‚Äù  ‚ÄúHey little girl, do you want to feel my legs?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWow, you smell good.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWho stole my pudding?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhose house am I in?‚Äù
Biden:  ‚Äúwell, you smooth talking negros better get your act together. Cause you ain‚Äôt black unless you vote for my old white butt‚Äù  Public: ‚Äúwow, that seems really racist. We better ask a professional.  Rev. Sharpton, what do you think?‚Äù  Al: ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok. That honky is a democrat‚Äù
If you claim to be a Republican and you vote for Joe Biden....  Your not a Republican.  Your not a conservative.  Don‚Äôt lie to people. Just admit you call yourself a Republican but are really a big govt progressive who is happy with keeping the DC game alive
No AG Barr arrest on Obama or Biden. They're above the law.
Trump will and is cheating to try and become a two term illegitimate president. But the stable people will not allow this to happen, trump will lose in the largest landslide Biden victory.
This is a shameful attack on a good man, no one believes trump; however this is a bridge too far. Trump does not deserve to be anywhere near Vice President Biden. Trump is sick and needs to be hospitalized!There‚Äôs another pic of him with his hand on a cops knee. Biden is just touchy feely.
Look at #KHive in the news y'all!
Biden already said he‚Äôll defund the police

The left loves throwing the racism card out to anyone who doesn't share their views. The Dems have went so far left there's not much other choice but to vote the other way. Biden should've selected Tulsi Gabbard, who is more moderate, to sway more votes from the middle and right.
SCORING BIDEN AND TRUMP ON RELIGION
Harris‚Äô policies do not speak to the needs of the many families in Mississippi whose loved ones are incarcerated in #ParchmanPrison and others throughout this State. Biden‚Äôs policies always have favored #MassIncarceration. They both are ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù.
Suspicious signs of a sudden spate of paid "trolls" (professional liars) advocating for #Biden and #Harris, using the socialist rose symbol üåπ and the #GreenParty sunflower symbol üåª to disarm opposition. Don't be fooled. Engage as hostile, or report (as fake) and block.
This has been the Achilles heel of the  Instead of pushing the  to provide their constituents with viable candidates who share their interests, establishment Dems within  force us to accept the status quo. This will ultimately be Biden‚Äôs undoing

Yeah if you vote early you will not see Joe Biden make a fool of him Self in the debate
Are you ok? This woman is the one running for president not Biden!!
The fact is, when you push bomber Bernie who was voting to bomb brown people, voted for that same crime bill and funding Biden did, and was even more culpable of carceral injustice, your hypocrisy and misogynoir is revealed.
I'm voting for Joe Biden.
She is as lost as BIDEN and KAMALIE.
Yeah - her Secret Service escorts will help keep Biden from wandering off and getting lost - has to be easier than supporting her limp body and trying to make it look like she was self-propelled.
I almost agree - his and Obama's policies for the area were so bad and destructive that they welcomed a sane President Trump having a hand on the tiller...
Amazing - he teams up with a former prostitute and now they come up with a quick, Un-Constitutional signal to show us how they would run things...and they're stupid enough to think it plays well with Feds micromanaging everyone ...

Direct action is great but if you‚Äôre White living in a majority white, liberal state in the NE don‚Äôt tell me how voting for Biden is like cutting off your leg instead of your arm. You‚Äôre a willful idiot. You talk that game about direct action and revolution while living in MAINE?
She originally made claims that he Biden would say inappropriate things to her during meetings. And made her uncomfortable when he touched her. Turns out she worked in the mailroom and she oils not have been in meetings with him.
It was made clear her private personnel records would not be with Biden‚Äôs. She‚Äôs avoiding requesting from the right agency because she has never filed a complaint.
But when she went to request her records she went to Univ of Delaware where Biden‚Äôs records are kept. Of course her request was denied. And she tweeted about the denial. It fits the story she‚Äôs trying to portray of being railroaded from having her story investigated.
And her personnel records are separate from Biden‚Äôs. Her information is confidential and wouldn‚Äôt be with his records. SHE has to request any of her records from Senate.
And yes originally she did say she file a written complaint. But after Biden said he would release his records, she changed her story and said she never mentioned rape or assault in any complaint she filed.
How about you give us a date of the attack. How about you give us a location. How about you go to the Senate for your personnel records rather that Univ of Delaware when it was made clear that your confidential records wouldn‚Äôt be with Biden‚Äôs records.

Donald Trump is a fascist. Droning has increased and even become less regulated under him. Less vulnerable people will die under Biden. That‚Äôs objective fact no matter how much he sucks. You‚Äôre delusional otherwise.

Biden/Harris. America‚Äôs dream team.
&amp; 3 months out from the election is kinda a shit time to get that started. If we all truly felt this way about our choices why are these our choices? It‚Äôs a reflection of us as people. Fuck joe Biden but if he gets trump out of office &amp; we can start to gain the ground needed
I don‚Äôt see that being pushed at all I just see constant shitting on Biden &amp; Harris. It would be fucking amazing if we could not vote for the old racist/rapist democrat or republican at all this time, but we need to do more to get people on board with that type of thinking first.
A lot of you people are bitching about Biden &amp; Harris, but what are you going to do vote for trump? Or are you going to for Jorgensen? Either way you keep him in office, the only way to not have Biden nor trump in office is to kill the mindset of a 2 party system.
Good choice, Mr. Biden.

By way of nominating Biden and Harris, two of the worst offenders of state endorsed poc imprisonment methods, the DNC essentially nominated Jorgenson.
So BIden is now kinda like Ted Cruz when Trump called Cruz's wife crazy and ugly and accused Cruz's father of being involved in the Kennedy assassination.
More have died with the regular flues than with this.  This was just another plot to try and bring Trump down.  The power hungry will stop at nothing to try and get One World Order.  Only the ignorant and those seeking Power will be voting for Biden whose Dementia is so apparent
I got it at 3:49cst. Well after the news. TBF the servers used to send out a mass text like that have to relay through other systems and it could have gotten backlogged. This may not be on the Biden end of the technology and just a bottleneck.
She‚Äôs the best choice. Trump can‚Äôt attack Biden anymore for wanting to ‚Äúdismantle‚Äù the police because she‚Äôs the former AG of California. Susan Rice would have brought up Benghazi all over again. She‚Äôs a strong pick for the centrists who are on the fence.
Yep, has the background but has to understand that VP means VP.  Advise Biden and make sure he wins at his endeavors as POTUS.
Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate.
It‚Äôs gonna be rice. It‚Äôs the absolute silliest choice. Least CAMPAIGN experience. Tons of baggage. Joe‚Äôs instincts are garbage and DiFi was an early Joe endorser and apparently isn‚Äôt a big KDH fan. It fits the bullet points. Biden is dense, Clyburn and DiFi are happy.
And it was revealed she can request her own records thru Senate. Biden cannot give say to release her personnel records. She has to do it. But she went to Univ. of Delaware where Biden Senate records are.
And Biden spoke on this stating that he would release any pertaining personell records back when she claimed she made a written complaint back when it happened. Then she reversed saying she never did.
Anyone who doubts the deterioration of Joe Biden needs to see this...should remove all doubt...
GET ME BIDEN ON THE PHONE I WANT TO HAVE A WORD
I don't think it would be presumptuous at all to announce a few key cabinet posts. It allows the public to compare and contrast what a Biden admin would look like against the Trump faux-admin.
that shit actually became a lot easier to do when they started filming using so much green screen, spies have a lot more trouble snapping pics on sets, and all the scripts like quadruple watermarked with each person's copy unique identifier.  In conclusion Joe Biden is CGI
Biden hasn't said a single word about tax increases, except to say he will raise taxes on incomes over $400,000 and that multi-million dollar corps who pay nothing now would have to start.  Your tweet smacks of desperation.  Laughable.
I think Biden has a very strong chance of losing no matter who he picks. For the first time in my life I don‚Äôt believe the data even a little bit
It's hilarious how the Biden folks refuse to admit that his campaign was a zombie before black women saved it. They get so upset they can't even form sentences as can be seen in that video! Bless their hearts!
Wow! Joe Biden is a idiot! #Trump2020
Yes! Joe Biden's campaign has a debt that needs to be paid to black women and it's past due. They here to collect!
Who cares?  Biden and VP will both losers in November!
And Biden‚Äôs brain is fried!
This could be Biden‚Äôs Sister Soulja moment if he came at this hard, but the Democrats think they can hide him, hold the ball, and run the clock out.
I think it already has. Biden‚Äôs lead in the RCP average has dropped three points in a month.
Willie Brown:  "Harris is a tested and proven campaigner who will work her backside off to get Biden elected." ironic phraseology...
Around July 7th Biden was at 51.1% and Trump was at 41.5%. Fast forward to today and Biden fell to 49.9% while Trump climbed to 42.1%. But please tell me again how the VP choice doesn't matter. üôÑ  #BidenHarris2020
Looks like Biden too!!!!
Trump = Rocky  Biden = Bullwinkle!
CNN Guest: There Are No Left-Wing Outlets That Exist to Tear Down Trump
Authorities told her she herself (Tara Reade) would only have the power to request her personnel records from the Senate even if she had made a report. Confidentiality laws. She intentionally requested records at University of Delaware where Biden's records are.
Very hard to investigate if she cannot give a date of the attack. She originally claimed to have reported the incident but when Biden stated he would release any personnel records she then claimed she didn't make a report.
100‚Äôs?   Count Biden‚Äôs parade today. You may get closer.
Yeah it‚Äôs a real mystery as to why Sanders never attacked Biden for praising George Wallace.
He says he won't choose until he gets his pudding - then, as they wipe his chin, he forgets he had pudding and demands pudding before he chooses...
I thought Senile Joe was corralled into choosing a 'woman of color'. I guess Kamala would work - she has enough melanin to call herself "Black" - and a side bonus is she doesn't seem to mind being groped by older men to get ahead...just ask Willie Brown.
I say Biden is a Lying Dog-Faced Pony Soldier...
Jim Crow Joe Biden could become the next President of The United States. And all he did was sit by the water cooler during the primaries. And sit in his basement during the campaign. The Democratic movement offers No Hope and No Change. We need a Progressive Movement.
This was the Back Bay Biloxi MS Trump Boat Parade today. We had the National Anthem to start the day off and  not 1 single Biden flag in sight. Thousands of Trump boats/ Flags building  not 1 some single Biden/ Socialist flag in sight.,,,#Trump2020
USPS is the most corrupt institution and the mailmen are brainwashed Biden supporters. #boycotttheelection to show your support for  and the RIGHT party
Best picture of the day showing how many of us Deplorables were at the Back Bay Biloxi Trump Boat Parade!! Thousands of Trump Flags, not 1 Biden. Also, no rioting, no looting and best of all, a Great time was had by ever single person that attended. #Trump2020 #winning2020
For Biden Family, a History of Tax Problems
She stated Biden would say inappropriate things to her during meetings. She worked in the mailroom. Explain to me how she would‚Äôve been in meetings with Biden. She had no daily contact with him.
Zoom in and pan around....not 1 single Biden flag, not 1. But thousands of boats with 1,000‚Äôs of Trump flags of all kinds. Fake Media won‚Äôt show this. #winning2020 #landslide2020 #nobidenhereatthisparade.
Right here in my home town!  We love Trump down South!  Biden has nothing!
This dude total biden bot.
They act surprised - Biden has a long history of racist activities and inane comments...as he deteriorates mentally, his filter is eroding...
About the time they realized Trump shaved 3 points off of Biden‚Äôs lead in a month.
They all met with Biden recently I guarantee it (well not Liz ofc)
How Biden‚Äôs VP ‚ÄòShort-lister‚Äô Susan Rice Enriched and Abetted the Terror-Sponsoring Castro Regime
Here‚Äôs your IQ Test. What‚Äôs your take on Joe Biden?
Like what? Tara Reade still cannot give a date of this so called attack or even a location. She claimed to be in meetings with Biden and it turns out she worked in the mailroom and had no day to day contact with him. Stop the lunacy.
Y‚Äôall blaming Biden for Reades housing insecurity and financial instability. She lied to get into law school. Maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs affecting her ability to get work. Not Biden. Not Biden supporters.
You are NOT worthy of the Black vote and how dare you attack Joe Biden‚Äôs faith. Fact: You stoke fear and racial divisions with your racist rhetoricYou are a Demagogue and you will be defeated in November. The virus is winning because of the choices you have made.
Please ‚Äúsilence‚Äù Biden.
One of the coolest byproducts of this is that it's forcing Christian supporters of Biden/Trump to discuss pros/cons Biblically.  Had a very painful discussion, no argument with a "woman be quiet" believer this morning.  Just dawned on me that a female VP will just kill him?!?!

Why doesn‚Äôt Biden denounce burning bibles?
So biden calls trump out for stopping  flights and now biden is saying trump did not do enough earlier ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£  How do you support such   Democrats and Republicans are the same. They just take from opposite pockets
Oh you mean the poor kids and the white kids? You know... the thing??? ü§£ü§£ü§£ Trump has done more for minorities than any other president. As Biden put it, y'all believe the "truth" instead of facts. What a sad sad world we live in.
And how do y'all think Biden would have handled this? Remember... Trump was the one called a xenophobe for stopping those flights. He said he wished we could do something like those things to get rid of it. And the advice at the time was to save masks for first responders.
This is disrespectful on so many levels. Biden cannot hide his disdain for the Black community.
Biden just said racist remarks today. So Ohio wants that? No
Why is Biden for killing babies then? God is against murder I guess Biden is for it.
Biden didn‚Äôt come out against burning bibles!!
You think Biden goes to bed without watching Colbert? Hah.
Monday is what I think but I‚Äôm entering my official guess as Saturday at like 7am EST because Biden probably mows his lawn then. Waking me up. Fucking old dudes, man.
I don‚Äôt understand the question. Do people really not know what this means? There‚Äôs so many things you can say about Biden but remembering his dad‚Äôs driving fondly is weird? Oof. How embarrassing to be so sheltered and DSA? A group supposedly for the worker?
She claims Biden would talk down to her during meetings but it turned out she worked in the mailroom, a position she would not have been in meeting with him or have daily contact with him.
She worked in the mail room and was fired for throwing mail away. She never had daily contact with Biden.
Biden must be pretty powerful if he can hurt God tbf.
Because he‚Äôs Joe Biden. Now open pdf.
