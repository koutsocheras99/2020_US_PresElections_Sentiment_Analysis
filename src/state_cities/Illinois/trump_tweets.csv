Trump tried to pass off that so-called press conference as a "peaceful protest". Exactly what were they protesting his policies. I have a problem with the fact that the media accepted that, as a reasonable explanation
I'm not voting for him or Trump and they both are crazy
To the bigots who are so racist, they are willing to follow Donald Trump to Russia. Do you really believe if Vladimir Putin got control of this government, that he would allow you to keep your little farm wherever it is.
It doesn‚Äôt seem that any explanation is needed!  To quote Donald Trump, ‚Äúit is what it is!‚Äù
I think it important to say to you that while you guys are playing with that stimulus package. The Trump Administration is f****** over the post office
It‚Äôs extremely foolish and some sort of attempt to show everyone how tough they are or how trump loving they are. We all know it‚Äôs a poor decision and we wish they‚Äôd do better.

The order, starting in 45 days time, would ban any U.S. transaction with TikTok-owner ByteDance.  via  An order that's not worth the paper it was written on, and has absolutely no teeth
While on the contrary...Trump points out that many members are wearing masks and another news org points the camera to show just that. And all Kathryn does is to have the typical MSM knee jerk reaction of faux outrage
Trump is betting on a victory in Nov so he can forgive taxes. All he can probably do now is defer.
Why are people even pretending like Trump's opposition to mail-in voting is real. Everybody knows the reason for that is that if everybody has the opportunity to vote, his ass is out and he knows it. Which is why he wants people to vote by mail where he approves
Now if the MSM would hammer Biden about Russia the way they do to Trump
How to put the brains Auburn never Trumper, up against a trump supporter any day of the week

No way!!  I am sure Trump has  already cheated!   Even if he wins, there will be Democratic Senate and House.  Then it is curtains tor Trump and for anyone associated with him!!
...guess your asking China to help didn't work, huh?
Most decent people have been driven out of GOP leadership, which doesn't leave much left to oppose Trump and his enablers.
After the whole Trump debacle ends, I would hope the Justice Department, as soon as all the crooks, Nazis, and grifters are cleaned out, will start treating white-collar crime seriously. Trump should have been jailed long ago for blatant lawbreaking.
The Dems are giving us a gift. Every NRA member will vote for Trump.

So this right wing Republican says they can't look the other way concerning Jerry Falwell Jr.'s recent pants-unzipped-arm-around-a-girl-with-HER-pants-unzipped photo. Sure they can! They look the other way all the time with Trump...
Something's rotten in Denmark.  Did Trump show them pictures from Epstein's Island?  Or, do the poll numbers show that parents are getting p*i*s*s*e*d at the teacher unions?
You can believe Obama Propaganda, but I believe my wallet. A gal of gas 2013-2016: $4.05 A gallon of 2% milk was UP TO $3.99  Today Under Trump Gas today is approx $2.19 gallon  A gal of 2% milk today is $2.75 Your income tax was decreased too  THIS is how AN economy grows!
The Trump administration has moved against #TikTok and #WeChat, but strategic investment opportunities in #China and other emerging markets remain.
Trump's condescension towards his base doesn't get talked about enough.
Obama destroyed business like no other Pres. His regs restricted industry growth &amp; caused American companies/jobs to RUN overseas  Trump halted NAFTA, eased business/industry regs &amp; negotiated new trade deals Companies returned, new business/jobs sprouted &amp; unemployment was LOW
Do the people look like racists, or do they look like true patriots that love this country? TRUMP 2020
‚û°Ô∏è4.9 million cases. ‚û°Ô∏è160,000 dead. ‚û°Ô∏è55 million first-time unemployment claims.  President Trump‚Äôs #FailuretoLead left millions infected, thousands dead &amp; the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. #COVID19
So Trump was right again...guess all those leftist are gonna apologize now for calling him an idiot right? #wishfulthinking
Well said! Make us stay home, let us file unemployment, then pin it on Trump. Europe‚Äôs economy is in free fall.  Actual GDP is -9.2% MSM touting GDP of -32.5% which is ANNUALIZED % not the right # With Joe‚Äôs policies we‚Äôll all see ACTUAL UNEMPLOYMENT &amp; A CRASHING STOCK MKT
Less then .09% in children overall 98% survival rate and most virus never have a vaccine that is developed...but yeah somehow it‚Äôs Trump fault you #Clown
Like I said. Always about him.
Trump is always in it for himself.
I think Trump is the dumb one. Like mail voting and then backtrack on FL.   That‚Äôs not what Trump said about both. Sure after his folks schooled him, but it‚Äôs not what‚Äôs out of his mouth. Things never go as he says.   But we all know he needs to deal for Iwanka.
Absolutely not!!  Trump has so damaged this country in every way possible.  I seriously believe they should take away his citizenship, that of his children, Melania and her family!  They should all be exiled!!

Your plan Joe? Should the President start treating patients?  -The real stats do not reflect your info. States control of COVID policy.  If Trump had a treatment, the LEFT would deny it  watch Americans die because ORANGE MAN BAD! HCQ/Zinc?  PS-Test sites are EVERYWHERE
Fundamentally it comes down to whether people think Trump (and his Supreme Court picks) is worse than Biden (and his picks).  Clearly some people think they're equally bad.  It's fine, we disagree, and I don't think our minds are going to be changed on that.
Trump said he would release his taxes four years ago.
Hey folks, this is merely a small payback for Trump pardoning D‚ÄôSouza

If he does this it will definitely end up in court. The payroll tax is established by federal law as written by congress. No executive order can over-ride a federal law. Of course Trump has done these kind of exaggerated politic stuns in the past to detract voter.
Wouldn‚Äôt it be kind of authoritarian for Trump to unilaterally mandate masks nationwide?
I think Biden is actually more racist than Trump. Trump just says somewhat racist things because he thinks that‚Äôs what his base wants to hear.
I would stay hoping we could have a healthy debate as to how we both view Trump.  There would be no harm in that.
The DAM is breaking for Donald Trump to delay any more lawsuits to protect himself.
Trump is so corrupt
A man that for decades refused to rent to Blacks &amp; created a corporate culture that made sure no one working for him would rent a Trump property to a Black person is? How are you, a person that had to be forced by the federal government to stop this practice, better then Biden?
He wouldn't have fought tooth and nail the past 4 years to hide his taxes from the public if there wasn't something in them.

88/166 days of ugliness remains. Warning with nothing to offer but hate &amp; fear, Trump will escalate the ugly as his principal tool.
Lol. Trump with a wand, made all the jobs in Obama‚Äôs rising economy he inherited - just disappear.
That travel ban was racist. ONLY banned Chinese citizens. The virus doesn‚Äôt see race but incompetent Trump did.    Meanwhile Americans, Europeans, and others just walked into our airports and into NY and CA with no testing. No quarantine. No screening.   That‚Äôs stupid racism.
TikTok threatens legal action against Trump US ban  This has the look of Mafia tactics. A legitimate business is told to sell to an American company or else risk being put out of business?
Trump played golf OVER an ENTIRE year out of not even 4 years.   Before COVID-19, Trump‚Äôs jobs were less than Obama year after year. He inherited a steady rising economy.   Trump is destroying this country pretty well by himself. Just like he did he businesses. Bankrupting üá∫üá∏.

Things I learned during the 2020 election... - Biden is a worse candidate than Hillary - Trump is a worse candidate than Biden - A Biden vote is immoral - Trump wins if he follows Covid doctors  - It's the worst election ever. We lose no matter who wins.
Things the candidates for President should do to win... - Trump: Stop tweeting. Stop talking. Just stop. Put up pictures of the American flag. - Biden: Do nothing. Say nothing. Just stop. Put up pictures of you smiling.
Righteous protesters should... - Demand Antifa/violent among them stop. Stop being a Trojan Horse for violence.  - Keep pressing on toward righteous goals - Spell out goals and explain what needs to happen to end the protests - Be honest if Trump is the actual focus of protests
I wish someone in congress would speak up on behalf of all the children put their foot down and stop Trump from making false claims that children will be fine if they catch #COVID19. Children will get it and in turn give it to siblings, parents, grandparents etc. #Children matter
donald j trump idolizes straight, white, men and if you‚Äôre anything other then straight and white then you‚Äôre invalid and you are nothing to him. i am so sick of this shit so physically sick and tired of this man.

donald trump is a shit show president who doesn‚Äôt give a jack shit about us and the innocent black people dying at the hands of those who are supposed to protect us and those at the border who are being raped and assaulted and separated from their families
Media things that should happen... - Press Trump on Epstein link - Call out Biden for hiding his mental issues by avoiding live interviews - Cover late-night violent "protests" live - Admit that you are not doing your job and do better
I would wait entire year if I had to to get that mf out of office. FUCK TRUMP.

This epitomizes the GOP in the era of Trump. Trump, speaking of Biden, "He's against God. He's against guns." Only now would those two sentences be conjoined in this way.
I agree that trump is bad and not really Christian. But Jesus wasn‚Äôt liberal or conservative. Jesus didn‚Äôt have any political affiliations. And yes, he may have seemed more left leaning, but he wasn‚Äôt liberal or conservative.
I've heard about this incredibly frustrating practice‚ÄîUSCIS sending immigration applications back because an inapplicable field was not filled in with "N/A"‚Äîfrom  legal services colleagues  I'm thankful  is drawing attention to this
Which is not to say that I disagree with your larger point. Any mention of God that Trump makes is empty and meaningless, and he doesn't give a shit about religion or people who practice it. Those same Evangelicals that I grew up with will probably believe every word though.
Every time Joe Biden opens his mouth, at least 1,000 new Trump voters are created.
When it comes to being a decent human being:  All of the Trump's fail, all the time because they are hateful, divisive, bigoted facists.
I *wish* this was the most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve heard Trump say. After ‚Äúnuking hurricanes‚Äù, ‚Äúwindmills cause cancer‚Äù, ‚Äúbuy Greenland‚Äù, etc, I‚Äôm not even sure this is in the top 10. ü§Æ
I doubt that, but we can all rest assured that God will damn Trump to hell along with all the Republicans who have enabled him and the blasphemous Evangelicals who believe he is the second coming of Christ.

Imagining a world where Biden wins and Democrats retake the Senate and hold the House. RBG and Breyer retire on Jan. 20. Multiple Senate and House investigations are opened into the Trump admin. Ok, that was nice. Back to reality.
No person can hurt God or the Bible (see 1 Peter 1:25)  But those who follow God in obedience to the Bible can be hurt  260 million Christians live in countries where they face persecution. Many are forced to flee  The US has all but shuts its door on them

You don't have to, but as the only two realistic options for next POTUS are Biden or Trump, a vote for neither functions as if you prefer both of them to an equal degree, which I find hard to believe to be true for almost every voter.

Trump said he was going to drain the swamp.  He let go a lot of people who worked under Obama, which is usual practice. Then trump brought in his own people to replace the swamp dwellers. Turns out they were much worse than anyone he called ‚Äú swamp dwellers‚Äù.  Typical trump
not true. Taxes and finances werent mentioned once in the mueller report.   The only person who said what you have said is Trump.   Have you seen amy reports if mueller looking at taxes  Mueller was special council for less than two years, you seem very confused on reality.

Let's start with the basics, its a trump supporter
Many of us were Never Trump in 2016. I‚Äôm not sure why you think we would leave the Republican Party and magically go back to it just because Trump‚Äôs gone. There‚Äôs no going back unless there‚Äôs a major upheaval and we throw the evangelicals out.
An important difference between Joe Biden and Donald Trump... is willing to admit a slip of the tongue and generally correct it on the spot. While  doubles down trying to prove what he said is correct. I prefer a leader with a little humility.
Should Donald Trump stop managing his own twitter account, have one staffer handle it and drop 4-5 critical posts daily, and focus on being President?   Feel free to explain your answer.
I voted by mail in 2016.  Not sure about it this year. I don‚Äôt trust what trump is doing to the post office.
Dear President Trump, you've been a Godsend to Americans everywhere!  I IMPLORE you to replace COVID-19 colluder/Democrat mouthpiece Dr. Fauci with Dr. Simone Gold!  She represents American health like Kayleigh McEnany represents YOU!
Neither does Biden or any politician they all lie, question is why is Trump the only one censored or called out while the other side defends their candidates regardless?ü§î
What's in a name? Trump from the word Trumpery. Hmmm Trumpery? Perhaps we will stop being shocked about all his Trumpery now that we know it's all he is and will ever be.
Hubby won‚Äùt be going to jail, but Trump will!!
Don‚Äôt you have more important things to focus on? People are struggling financially, we are in a pandemic, and we have an election coming up and Trump is Putin‚Äôs bitch. Do something for the people in your state, not Trump
I got a bad feeling now, with the usps, Kanye being added to ballots with gop help, trump sowing doubt about the election, the JD and homeland security in his court and an unpredictable SCOTUS. Cheer me up
Wouldn't they only go to grand jury as evidence to bring charges?   Personally, I dont think they will go that route until Jan 20th at noon. I think they will make allegations public first to see what trump does.

Trump says kids 'almost immune' from Covid-19. Hear a doctor's response   Look, he‚Äôs been 100% wrong at everything COVID Trust him with your kids?
If Trump had a PERFECT Covid policy the Left wld lie &amp; disagree b/c they‚Äôd rather watch citizens die than give Trump a win..   The blame should be placed directly on State governors. Fed govt can advise, close borders &amp; acquire supplies/vaccines. States direct their own policies
Trump Administration supporters have often claimed that the only reason why they pursue charges against General Flynn is because they don't like Trump. So are we to believe that, the police are only supposed to investigate crimes of people they like. That makes zero sense
This is early advice for voters using ABSENTEE BALLOTS.  Absentee ballots are REQUESTED &amp; EXPECTED by the voter. They are mailed to polls early.  Mass mail bombs EVERY reg voter a ballot and is HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO FRAUD!.   Trump always states absentee balloting is appropriate!
So because you think Trump lies it makes it ok for the FBI to lie and violate US citizens rights? #LiberalLogic #LiberalHypocrisy
Cool cool....Trump brought in 165million same time period so...

I still don‚Äôt want healthcare in the hands of my government. Imagine Trump (or reps) dictating my coverage for 8 years. No thank you! üòïI‚Äôll take the Switzerland model. I can easily change jobs. Not so with countries.   The wait time is debatable.
Age discrimination? I mean who‚Äôs as ‚Äúfit‚Äù or as ‚Äúsharp‚Äù or as ‚Äúquick‚Äù when they get older? Wisdom and experience is the only thing that gets better with age. That‚Äôs just science. But to discriminate? To compare him to younger self? Smh. Compare him today to Trump!
Bernie Sanders feels it's uniquely important to get rid of Donald Trump.  Doesn't that count for something?  Like, this is really about Trump for a lot of us.

But voting Green for POTUS will?  This is very tiresome.  Again, everyone should go hog wild progressive for Congress.  They would at least stand a chance on making some change.  But a progressive Congress with Trump will get you nowhere.
What makes Donald Trump tick? That's too easy... Here are a few things: 1. Smart, strong, assertive women. 2. Fact checking. Being challenged. 3. Sharing the spotlight with more skilled, knowledgeable and popular people like Dr. Fauci. 4. The use of proper English language!
We made it through 8 years of senile, old Ronnie, we can make it through 4 years of Joe. Anyone but Trump really is fine by me.
This may have been missed but I'm no Biden champion.  If this was a parliamentary-style vote I'd be voting differently.  So I'm going the lesser of two evils route.  I think Trump has damaged our system and our political way in a uniquely dangerous way.
What if democrat far left start to gel with Trumpers? Conspiracy theories and all. With the racism not so obvious as today. Back to dog whistle and not the bull horn right now... coming together behind a populous candidate. A Bernie or a Trump without the overt racism.
Genuine question -- what's the play by voting Green Party?  What do you hope to achieve?  As a comparison point, what I hope to achieve by voting for Biden is to make Donald Trump no longer be president.
I cannot believe how stupid and ignorant Trump is!!  Can‚Äôt imagine someone as intelligent as Obama ever having a conversation with him!!  Think Joe Biden will chew him up and spit him out in a debate!!
The relationship between the Green Party and Dems is closer than Green Party and GOP.  If someone was 0% likely to vote for Trump and 1% likely to vote for Biden/whatever Dem, the Green Party vote costs the Dem, not Trump.
If the reverse was true we‚Äôd be subject to endless committee hearings on it in the Senate
Yep.  Note that we're not sitting here championing Biden or this system.  We're just saying he sucks less and sometimes that's important, especially right now.  And yes, Trump is way worse than GWB or any of the others.
This whole progressive indifference to Congress and the Supreme Court boggles my mind.  Do you think a Trump second term-appointed Kavanaugh 2.0 would uphold or veto 2032 president AOC's M4A bill?
#LincolnVoter                                             Will never vote for a Republican again because the Republicans enabled Trump.  Our Democracy, Constitution and the Rule of Law ‚Äútrump‚Äù loyalty to party and to President. They failed their oath of office and constituents.

And what's he saying now?  Now compare that to Trump.
I‚Äôm old enough to know Trump is a crook. He has been on the wrong side of the law since 1970‚Äôs. Like so many white collar crimes they have just a slap on the hand. But what has done more damage to the USA  than the white collar criminals, very little.
Obama handed a steady stable rising economy to Trump. Jobs increased year after year. Trump has less jobs than Obama did each year.
Trump hands the guy the paper.He looks at it  It says something we all think is wrong.   Guy looks confused.
Magic wand or not, he passed on a strong stable steady economy to Trump. All DJ had to do was ‚Äúbuild‚Äù on it, instead his incompetence destroyed it!
I'm being dumb and letting myself get Mad Online about "Biden and Trump are the same" people.  COVID management.  Supreme Court nomination.  Even at least fathoming a public health care option.  If none of this convinces you then vote progressive for Congress and Biden for POTUS.

In apparent fear of the right wing, the media decided from the beginning to treat Trump differently than any other U.S. President. Their frantic, determined efforts to normalize him have proved to be an existential danger to the U.S. and the world.
OMG.  This is absurd.  Look at what's happened with freaking COVID.  Americans aren't allowed to travel to 95% of the world because our pandemic has been so mismanaged.  No one is claiming that Biden is amazing.  But the "same as Trump" stuff is willful ignorance at best.
Genuine question -- what's your opinion of the Supreme Court in all of this?  Are you indifferent as to whether Joe Biden or Donald Trump nominates the next Supreme Court justice to very likely replace RBG?

They found a person with mental issues to manipulate. Sad but shows how low the Trump administration will go to get relected so he can keep destroying are country with is racist and corrupt ways!
I‚Äôm guessing that Trump has been dealing with low fluid pressure for many years.
Trump saw one video with Tony Lopez and decided it was enough
Oh yeah, Kirk was pretty much the most moderate Republican in the Senate in his time there, but Illinois is a prettttyyyy blue state nowadays, so his days were numbered in the Senate almost as soon as Trump was put on the ballot.
Kirk was less liked downstate and Duckworth was appealing to WWC voters based on her background.   While Kirk was loved in the collars, at least more when compared to Duckworth. She was still popular there, but Kirk was more tolerable to the suburban-ites than say Trump was.
This is good - check it out:
Wow, great work ‚Å¶ !
If there is anyone who is a modern-day Tartuffe, it's Donald Trump.
Donald Trump is a desperate, cowardly man. Claiming that Joe Biden would "hurt God" if elected is yet another incendiary statement by Trump. If anyone fits the modern-day definition of Tartuffe, it's Donald Trump.
If we‚Äôre gonna be honest both trump and Biden are currently headed for the lake of fire.
I support Trump BECAUSE of the facts! Long term politicians who have enriched themselves by virtue signaling and rent seeking have hijacked the narrative with a complicit MSM are his sworn enemy. You are their puppet Pinocchio
Want a real OMG moment?  Just watch the Axios interview with Trump.
I would like to hear Trump‚Äôs response to, ‚Äúwhat is the scientific method?‚Äù
Trump is simply a waste of oxygen at this point. As I said before I love my conversative Americans but this dude is straight garbage as president.
45 is so hurtful and embarrassing, I truly hope that the textbooks tell the truth about this. And I'm embarrassed for your children that have to say you(Donald Trump) were part of their legacy.
Man life is to short to be hating on each other! Unless it's trump then hate away!
--- /   Hello=== Jan 17th -- CLOSED BORDERS ! You probably didn't get your Trump Check  !! $$ &amp; the Dems went on the Russia Russia hunt as well as their hold up on infrastructure programs !!!
To get a tRump picture of him praying in church you would need to superimpose a church.
Fifth Avenue - isn't that where Trump said he could get away with killing someone if he wanted to?
Trump continously saying that the Lebanese explosion was an attack&amp; not money, politics, and the constant mismanagement&amp;lack of action from political leaders is incredibly telling&amp;makes me very nervous about what the U.S. Is hiding that will probably be blamed on an attack
I couldn't believe...ANY of my senses when I heard him say that about children.  Cartman-Trump will do anything to get his own way and shove and cram those poor kids into schools they shouldn't be in yet.  Has he learned NOTHING from the Liberty University debacle?
Sadly, Trump sees himself as only the president of the red states. Many of these states, however, are subsidized by blue state tax dollars. He chooses to not see this connection. A great leader is willing to do the hard work that is needed to unite a nation. Trump divides us.
So trump supporters keep saying there is only a 1% morality Covid rate. He‚Äôs officially welcoming these poor fucks to the 1%.
Deadass tho, any Trump interview looks like a fuckin Saturday Night Live comedy skit
I love Donald Trump with all my heart and soul for what He's went and did for this country.  He has truly maked America great again.  My heart aches with all the unfair catty remarks this country has maked about Him, for He is the Chosen One and he is our true Lorde and Saviour.
Trump talks in circles that‚Äôs why  will win because  can‚Äôt answer a question honestly without lying and the repeats his lies over and over because he has no way to explain it!   will demolish the toddler President!! #Biden2020
What did  do?  He took credit for an economy that started growing in 2009 and flourished even after his policies started.  Then Trump because he‚Äôs an idiot tanked the economy with no plan to prevent COVID-19 because it was a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù!  Well now people are dead!
Trump calls "Black Lives Matter" a bunch of Marxists and ONCE AGAIN, for the 50th time, condemns those who kneel during the Star Spangled Banner.    (I couldn't copy and paste the link to the article for some reason.  It's on the Daily Mail)
Has Trump even acknowledged this horrible accident yet? #Biden2020
I‚Äôm not ignorant, I know facts because I watch many news sources that aren‚Äôt Fox News and Breitbart.  Facts, science, truth, and history are going to eat Trump and James Woods alive!  #Biden2020
He was great!
Well, of course he is.
The BIG NEWS is how badly Trump dropped the ball on handling the Coronavirus. As a matter of fact, he couldn‚Äôt even find the ball because he never even looked for it.
What the hell is this madness. Is Trump declaring himself president for life a d into the hereafter?
I can barely deal with trump no need for another lol.
No Trump. They don‚Äôt care about your stupid fight with sports. They care about living. Paying their rent and feeding their families. They care about the safety of their children at schools. Stop tweeting trouble and finally do your job to save human lives. Trump 2020 for Prison
Trump looked terrible in this interview. He has to go. He shows no humility, grace or responsibility to the American people. He is a joke and shame on you for voting for him. Again im not knocking conservatives but Trump isnt the answer. We all need to be better.
Maybe Trump can have the Internet scrubbed of settling Trump University!üòÇüòÇüòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Was settling the Trump university federal fraud lawsuit taking advantage of tax loopholes?  üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Remember Trump told us he doesn‚Äôt settle lawsuits? That is unless he can‚Äôt win them because he‚Äôs guilty of fraud. üòÇüòÇ Tax loopholes? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Because Trump and his family are not using their positions to enrich themselves? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. They‚Äôre the biggest offenders. You, like your arguments border on delusional. Now go away please. You‚Äôre brainwashed like any cult victim. Get some help.
Uh, menonites?  Artificial inseminite, Samsonite luggage?  WHAT?????  WHAT?????? WHAT?????

Ex-Presidents scrubbing images from the Internet? I think it‚Äôs you who needs to wake up. Most photographed person on the planet and yours alleging they can successfully scrub themselves from the Internet?! I can see why you support Trump.
Good for you. And Trump doesn‚Äôt love America he uses it as he sees fit for Donald Trump. His family has a long long history of state and federal tax fraud which cheats millions and millions of $$ from our military that he claims to love so much.Why is he hiding his tax returns?
tRump-(or should I just say rump) ‚ÄúDoes this chair make my ass look big?‚Äù
At least 200,000 people will not have a chance to have that memory. They will he dead due to Trump‚Äôs lack of interest in taking a leadership role in fighting the deadly Coronavirus.
Ya think?ü§î He looked like the ass he is.
You do realize Joe Biden sufferered and suffers from a speech impediment, right? And if you think Donald Trump is there ‚Äúmentally‚Äù you really have been sold a bill of goods. He‚Äôs the farthest thing from mentally stable as can be. And he‚Äôs a conman.
I‚Äôm surprised Trump hasn‚Äôt had these photos ‚Äúscrubbed‚Äù from the Internet!ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòú
Since they‚Äôre already there, President Trump should go and make it a rally?
Do Biden supporters not want to see a debate between him and Trump?  Coronavirus is not stopping a debate.  It could just be them two, a moderator, and the TV cameras.  Is that too much to ask?  The people deserve to see them debate.
Few days late trump.  Oh yeah that's right, you were golfing.
Because he‚Äôs an idiot.
I think Trump recently found out that many Republicans vote by mail. Now he needs to learn that they do this in many states. It  may take a few weeks for him to figure that out.
Hey Sean, I did of course watch you and the great one Mark Levin. You know Sean you are great too! I'm ordering your book right now and I can hardly wait to read it.  Thank you for your continues support for our great President Trump!
Wow, I really applaud this reporter for continuing to speak truth to #Trump #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER #VoteBidenToEndThisNightmare #SusanRice #GoodMorningTwitterWorld
Transalation. Governor told trump he will shut down all or most in person voting. Floridians better get their vote by mail on

needs to get off his ass and pick a VP! He said this week, now not this week. He looks like trump. I‚Äôll a have health plan in two weeks.......
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Trump made no sense whatsoever.
I LOVE IT!!!  Not only did the apple fall from the tree, it stuck its thumb out on the highway with a sign "anywhere mom isn't...or bust"
I‚Äôm going to start manipulating my checking account balance the way Trump manipulates COVID 19 statistics. ‚ÄúNo, the red numbers are good! You‚Äôre just not looking at it correctly!‚Äù
How is this guy president???? America please don‚Äôt vote for this clown. If you are a conservative at least vote for someone who has a brain. Trump is an embarrassment to America.
TRUMP IS TOTALLY UNHINGED- DELUSIONAL- SAYIN SO WONT MAKE IT SO ‚ùóÔ∏è
I sincerely can't see a way Trump wins re-election because I already know he isn't going to win any debates and he's been slowly killing or alienating his base since 2017! Trump: Lie, Biden: No that's a lie Don the con and here's proof! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
And how do you explain Trump? Creeping on his daughter!
helped our country and now Trump's economy has started, only 3 GOP years after he started! If Trump was responsible for the economy then why did the progress begin in 2009? Obama had it going up. Why do Republican presidents always leave the economy tanking?

D.A. Is Investigating Trump and His Company Over Fraud, Filing Suggests
I'm far more concerned with what the US Constitution says than what Trump wants.  I'm sick of Republicans who are more pro-Trump than they are pro-freedom.  I'm voting for Sethi.  Hagerty is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
...who is the white supremacist that murdered nine African Americans at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C.  In any case, Trump is wrong on both counts.  As I have said ad nauseam the past few days, per the teachings of my Catholic faith (CCC 2267)...
...Instead, Trump's desire for the execution of Tsarnaev is motivated by his vengefulness and general infatuation for killing people.  For the same reason, I would strongly suspect that Trump is also for executing Dylann Roof...
Is Donald Trump's eagerness for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's execution really motivated by the fact that Tsarnaev is a Muslim?  While many would not put that past Trump given his Islamophobia, I really doubt that is the prime reason behind his desire to see Tsarnaev executed...
Wrong. Dems want to save lives. Trump and the GOP see school children as expendable commodities. How awful.
Trump
Translation:  must have said something that really irked Trump.
I can‚Äôt even look at the American flag like I used to, all I see is maga and trump

Team Galactic definitely maxed out donations to Trump
This Trump+4/Cox+4 district in the Palm Springs area is home to California's only Independent State Legislator, Chad Mayes. Mayes left the GOP in 2019 and now faces a Republican in November. Mayes has a very good fundraising lead on Kotyuk though.
This Trump+3/Cox+9 district in the Inland Empire is open this year, hence it being on the board. Medina is raising a decent chunk of change, but Bogh is doing slightly better than her.
This Clinton+13/Raimondo+25 district in Middletown is pretty much only on the board because Mendonca is the former State Rep here who outperformed Trump in 2018. Though his fundraising leaves a lot to be desired...  On to California!
Looks like a tRump tan. Lol
This Trump+7.5/Fung+6 district in the Smithfield area was somewhat close in 2018 (Hawkins only won by 5 points) and Rea is raising some good (by Rhode Island standards) money here.
This Trump+10/Fung+5 district was just on the edge of competitive in 2018, but no one likes to raise money in Rhode Island, so I don't have much to say.  #RhodeIslandRaiseMoneyChallenge2020
This Trump+12.5/Fung+12 district in Coventry only went red by 31 votes in 2018, but no one wants to raise money here, so my analysis here is kinda bleh.
Jackson faces a tough challenge from former State Rep/2018 gubernatorial hopeful Patricia Morgan here in this Trump+5/Fung+4 district in West Warwick. Jackson flipped the district blue by almost 7 points in 2018 though...
This Trump+15 district in Cranston was actually won by Barbara Fung's husband Allan Fung by 37 in 2018! It was Fung's home area which helped.  State House Speaker Matiello is in for a tough re-election bid this year and Fung is probably one of his strongest opponents ever.
This open-R seat in the Lincoln area went to Trump by 5 and Allan Fung in 2018 by 1. This may be the smallest fundraising numbers we've seen in this series so far too!
Just a dumb attack line. How many people, especially on the State Legislative level, were in their 40s/50s/60s even when they decided to first run thanks to Trump. It doesn't matter how old you are when you first enter politics, you can make as much change as someone younger.
Trump just said: If you elect Joe Biden you will lose your windows and doors üö™
Are all of trump supporters mentally challenged? Why stand in front of your house with a confederate flag? Smh
...but even that does not make putting him to death an acceptable option.  Trump wants to put Tsarnaev to death because he is a simply vengeful person who likes the idea of killing people.  That attitude is in no way compatible with the teachings of Jesus.
Pointing out Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's evilness is an overstatement of the obvious, but why is Donald Trump so antsy to put him to death?  As previously stated, I am against Tsarnaev's execution solely based upon the teachings of my Catholic faith...
Too freakin funny Lol you got me üòÑbc I don‚Äôt put nothing stupid pass trump after the disinfectant suggestion
LIAR LIAR LIAR. Trump 2020 for Prison then hell.

I'm not surprised that a trump supporter is sexually attracted to a minor I'm mean his president has more than 30 rape allegations 13 being children and 1 is FROM HIS OWN DAUGHTER.
you missed the part where he said hotter and smarter. if you were actually smart you would know not to vote for trump but your a white supremacist.
Who else is getting ready for tonight‚Äôs big reveal of   ‚ÄúThe Trump Health Care Plan‚Äù  It has the feel of ‚ÄúThe Oscars‚Äù. I in my tuxedo my wife in an evening gown watching tv and waiting, and waiting, and waiting. He said 2 weeks he would have it ready. You know he NEVER lies.
Sickening...
Last time I looked I didn‚Äôt see any Trump supporters burning, looting, killing what will you all do when he wins again,mabe drink the koolaid??
For Trump.
How is it everyday of the week kids, parents, friends etc can fill the malls but can‚Äôt sit safely in a classroom,? President Trump puts America first Pelosi puts Power and politics first she‚Äôs kidding herself if she thinks we don‚Äôt realize it!
Get the moths out of brain didn‚Äôt you here the dems want a three trillion dollar stimulus? Another $600 plus weekly for people not to go back to work? You‚Äôre Trump hate is blinding you
Over 60 million people and rising have watched pres Trump fight tooth and nail for the American people he won the Presidency get over your shell shock start bracing yourself for another win! Now he has the police endorsement!
January started one of several travel bans creepy joe called pres trump a racist Pelosi marched arm in arm in china town they refused to call it the china virus does that tell you how the dems would have handled it?!!
If anyone says "I'm voting for Trump because he's pro-life," here's proof right here that he is anything but pro-life.  No one doubts that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be incarcerated for the balance of his natural life for the evil he did, but killing him IS NOT PRO-LIFE!
trump, Was in the Great State of Texas this week, I know, the sewer odor still lingers......
You talking about respect?  Where‚Äôs the respect when made fun of disabled, women, calling Mexican rapists, etc.  at this moment, Trump turd deserves all the disrespect.  This man has no respect and deserves none. So, boohoo.
Why move the country farther to the right ? It‚Äôs Faschist enough now!  #Trump is nothing less than the dream of the Grover  Norquist #Libertarian conspirators  #Pence is the political equivalent of a water well sourced from an abandoned lead mine
America at its finest. Trump and his republican minions are opening things up way too quickly and the American people know this but yet half will still vote red this election. It makes no sense to me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Say it with me ‚ÄúThe Pandemic Is FAR From Over‚Äù and repeat...
Fake News Trump was never on the island sorry
I do that all the time with someone I went to high school with over on Facebook.  He posts pro trump stuff and I take time out of my day to shit on it.
The Lincoln Project are single handily taking trump down. They give me life, as my daughter would say
Nope Naw, No, Never, Steve never praise trump that‚Äôs something you would remember. Prove it!
Not the point at all, but weird to see a "Shapiro" who disagrees with Trump...
I‚Äôm enjoying it except when you shit on Trump supporters lol what are they saying? Do they ONLY want you to play Pok√©mon??
WE ARE IN A BIG HOLE AND TRUMP KEEPS DIGGING!
He doesn‚Äôt need to be He‚Äôs beating Trump by staying at home
This Trump+12 seat in suburban Memphis is rated Lean R by  It's an open seat that's getting bluer on the presidential level and went R by 10 points in 2018. All three Democrats who have reported here are raising good money, while the two R's here are struggling.
None of these points sound like Sleepy Joe Biden.  Trump is the only candidate! #Trump2020Landslide
This Trump+10 district in the Germantown area of Memphis has been zooming to the left in the past few years (Obama lost it by 30!), but White is kinda entrenched, having been here since 2010. If this district keeps up trending to the left though, Jerri Green could win.
This Trump+20 seat in the Nashville suburbs (in Rutherford County) was very close in 2018, as Sparks only won by 5 points. We don't know how much Sparks raised in this pre-primary period, but Thomas raised a decent amount.
This Trump+13 seat in suburban Knoxville went Republican by only 3 in 2018 and now that it's open, Democrats sense opportunity. Republicans have a close primary and Couch has a somewhat decent war chest going into November.
This Trump+9 district makes up most of Chattanooga and parts of neighboring Bradley County. Gardenhire won by 11 points in 2016 and Scruggs has to be hoping this district gets bluer on the Prez level to help him out here.
Me looking at all the Trump hating on Twitter knowing damn well these geniuses are playing into his trolling and don‚Äôt even realize it:
Trump campaign must have figured it out. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs trying to get rid of tik tok... that won‚Äôt stop these beautiful children!
HAVE NO IDEA WHO SHE IS BUT HELL ITS BEATS TRUMP OR BIDEN
Disagree. I won‚Äôt support ANYONE who supports Trump. I‚Äôve met Pence; nice man, terrible policy wonk.
There will be hell to pay if trump goes through with this Tik Tok threat. Generation Z will collaborate a revenge on him like he has never seen before. His Aids better tell him. Bad idea
That's what we're hoping for.  Trump 2020!
Furthermore, I don't even think Trump's a real republican, he just found a way to bulldoze himself into the White House.
You know you have the right President when people from other countries want Trump!  When is the last time someone in America wanted another countries leader?
Why doesn‚Äôt a reporter ask Trump which candidate the election will be rigged in favor of? Who would these so-called election hi-jackers like to see as the POTUS? Throw his nonsense right back at him.
Considering the time‚Äôs the clip of trump trying to vote in 2004  #nTrump EXPOSED In 2004 Video Struggling To Vote  via
I'm waiting for the inevitable line of Trump hating the sound of TikTok because he knows that his time as president is running out
It‚Äôs easier to provide a constituency with a *sense* of superiority, than actually giving them economic and social equality. #Trump supporters work cheap !

All good points. Trump‚Äôs primary motivation in life is vengeance against all who criticize or challenge him.
Trump has got to shut this thing down.
I‚Äôm so sick of trump supporters calling themselves the silent majority.  You guys never shut the fuck up? Where is the silent? I would love for you guys to be silent for a single god damn day.
Actually fun fact  Trump said ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Foundation Was Built By African Americans‚Äù then the next day they tried to impeach him  Trump is on the the side of god
So, nobody thought to run up to security, point her out, etc.?  Not to sound like Trump at Parkland ("I WOULD'VE GONE IN THERE"), but didn't anyone think to take any action, whether it was ratting out the suspect or at least staying with the victim until help arrived?
Trump Recovers Taxpayer Cash On A $1 Billion Obama-Backed Solar Plant That Was Obsolete Before Ever Going Online - The Daily Caller.   If we could only get our money back from Solyndra......

Do it Trump!  We don't need anything from China!  The USA is self sufficient on their own.  I think the China virus was the last thing we needed.  Screw crap from other countries.  Even they want made in USA merchandise.

"It is possible he's lying...."  "DON'T YOU DARE SAY MY MR. PRESIDENT IS LYING!  PRESIDENT TRUMP NEVER LIES, IT'S JUST THAT EVERY COMMIE-LIB NEWS REPORTER HAS FUCKED UP EARS AND IS CONSTANTLY MISUNDERESTISENTING HIM!"
This Lakeville-based district went to Trump by 11.5 and Johnson by 4. It also overlaps with the key #SD58 Senate district, so it's doubly important there. Preese is raising some good money though, so it's definitely one to keep an eye on.
This Trump+4/Walz+4 district in Shakopee features one of the most interesting Republican primaries in the State House. Former State Rep Bob Loonan is looking to get his job back, but he has to face Erik Mortensen first, who beat him in the 2018 primary and then lost in Nov.
This Trump+6/Walz+3.5 district in the Hastings area was very close in 2018. Jurgens only won by 422 votes and is getting lapped in fundraising by Waits. If this area gets bluer on the Prez level, this could be ballgame for Jurgens.
This Trump+3/Johnson+0.2 district in the Chaska area is a district that's kinda stubbornly remaining Republican even though it's a suburban district. Boe only won it by 120 votes in 2018 too, so Kessler out-raising him here ain't that good for him.
This Trump+0.3/Walz+4 district in central Washington County was the site of another super close election in 2018 (Christensen only flipped it blue by 137 votes!), but Christensen seems to be in a better position this time around.
This White Bear Lake-area district went to Trump by 1 and Walz by 5 points. Wazlawik flipped this seat blue by about 400 votes in 2018 and appears to be in a pretty decent position to win re-election this year.
This Trump+11/Johnson+3 district in the Lino Lakes Area did vote Republican by 10 in 2018, but the seat's open now and Kris Fredrick is putting up some impressive numbers compared to the other Republicans.
This Blaine-area district went to Trump by 4 and Walz by 4.5 points. West only beat Malik by about 200 votes in 2018 and Malik is handily out-raising him here, hence the Tilt DFL rating!
This Trump+3/Walz+5 district in the Champlin area did only flip blue by 5 points in 2018, but Stephenson appears to have somewhat entrenched himself here, at least in regards to fundraising.
This Trump+16/Johnson+5 district in the Anoka area is pretty clearly a reach district for the DFL in their quest to expand their House majority, but Erickson out-raising Heinrich has to be good news for them.
This Mower County-area district went to Trump by 9 and Walz by 8 points. Poppe should be fine here though, but the fundraising is kinda close
This Trump+14.5/Johnson+3 district in the southern Rochester suburbs seems somewhat similar to HD-25A, but the DFL'er here (Randy Brock) raised about 15 times as much as the incumbent R and has almost triple the cash-on-hand.
This Trump+16/Johnson+3 district in the northern Rochester suburbs doesn't seem like a big flip opportunity for the DFL, but Kim Hicks is out-raising Duane Quam here in this (for now) small-dollar race.
This Nicollet County-area district went for Trump by 4 and Tim Walz by 18 points! Walz had home-field advantage essentially, but that underscores the fact that Democrats still have a solid hold on this district downballot and Brand is no different.
This Trump+11/Johnson+2 district in St. Cloud was another close one in 2018. Theis only won by 4 in 2018, is getting out-raised here, and only has a small cash-on-hand advantage.
This Trump+21/Jeff Johnson+7 district in the Grand Rapids area was only won by the Republicans by 4 in 2018 and with the seat open this year, Democrats sense some opportunity. However, Republicans do lead in the fundraising departmentNo. This is bad. Louis DeJoy is a trump stooge who wants to destroy the postal service, in the same way Betsy DeVos wants to destroy our education system.
Trump did so much for yall hu? You should look what "tax cuts" means in the GOP, are you familiar with lee atwater?
Wtf are you talking about? Is this like when you lied about the H1N1 deaths? Are you just a compulsive liar like trump? Usually when people make retarded claims they back it with a citation so they dont come off as retarted as the claim.
You mean like trump forcing companies to cover pre existing conditions through an EO while simultaneously trying to repeal a law that does the same thing.
Trump invents Obamacare!
Thank you for  "An American Pickle". Im unemployed and living in misery during Covid and the Trump Administration. It was nice to have an evening I could spend with my wife just laughing and not thinking about anything serious. This movie made us feel better! #HBOMax
He didnt change for people like him he changed to get trump out of office because he is a disgrace to GOP beliefs. Dems werent ever going to vote trump, rick is here to sway moderate republicans away from the con man.
D'Souza trying to defend Trump's mispronunciation of "Thighland" was the most embarrassing thread I've seen on Twitter so far.
I‚Äôll vote you out of humanity. Trump 2020
So if Republicans/Trump loses we know they cheated. Too many silent supporters...
Trump and his antigens who follow him blindly shall be wiped out by Covid19.  Like Joe, all we need to do is to shelter in place and cast our ballets.  We will be much better off as a country once Trump is thrown out of office.
Imagine no internet, television, or newspapers. You have to vote based on the principles that matter to you and your day to day life. Vote trump, you stand for patriotism. Vote D, stand for NY, SEATTLE, PORTLAND, PEDO... What would you choose?
Have you lost your mind ? Obamacare That's what it is What is Trump going to take credit for next ? Going to the moon ? Inventing the wheel? Absolutely unbelievable ü§£ü§£ü§£
Nobody:  Trump Campaign:
Every host on Fox News stretching for the amount of verbal gymnastics that it's gonna take to explain how Trump's executive order is different then the provision that was in Obamacare.

Oh yea all those essential workers would really appreciate your disregard for their health. Because they totally have a choice to stay home. After all trump gave them 1200 dollars right? That should cover 6 months worth of rent?
Trump WAITED to close travel from Europe. He also disbanded the pandemic response team. He downplayed the usage of masks, pushed a medicine that doesn't work, and has been playing this whole thing off as a hoax whose aim was to jeopardize his re-election.
Trump telling them social distancing and face masks was an msm hoax at the time totally helped keep those people healthy right? Hell he said it again today and he got cheers.
Oh he made a deal all right ü§™North Korea is  testing missiles constantly and Iran is much closer to having nuclear weapons With Trump making deals America will end up in a war I wouldn't trust him to make a deal with a four year old Hell get outwitted ü§™
So don‚Äôt pay for sex changes. Trump tried to fire them...via tweet. Unforgivable. If you can pass MEPS, ur fit to serve. He just did it because he‚Äôs a bigot. U don‚Äôt care. But make no mistake about it, he‚Äôs a bigot
Donald Trump called for a total ban on all Muslims entering the country. He didn‚Äôt get it (it‚Äôs illegal). But don‚Äôt tel me he is for religious liberties.
Well Rick Wilson was right Trump will ruin every piece of our country he can My God this man is capable of anything

US intel: Russia acting against Biden; China opposes Trump
"Citing several recent after several scandals" would be a trend if  or Trump wrote this. For 2 days Leftists have criticized Dinesh &amp; Trump over #Thighland, and here the "experts" at  Washington Post make these kind of grammatical blunders in their Falwell articleüòÇ
These are trying times, I‚Äôve questioned Trump, Q, and everything time and time again. Nothing wrong with it.
You're right that "some seek to tarnish our country." Don't worry! Trump will lose in November, and we'll restore our country. #twill #Patriotism #USA

Las Vegas fines hotel for hosting Trump campaign event despite coronavirus order
Time for DHL's parent, the German Post office, to expand and bid for handing mail-ballots. This would freak out Trump big time.
If you remember how much Trump hates Mercedes Benz, just think how he would flip out if DHL would expand back into the USA to handle the ballots for the election.
Trump is hated by Boog bois but go off
Outside of the occasional news dump, Fridays news headlines used to be boring as hell.  Not in the age of trump.  Goddamn, the historians will have a field day with 2020.

Just a reminder of how petty Leftists are over how Dinesh or Trump pronounces #Thighland,  Leftists pronounce the 'capital' of Kentucky "Loo-ee-vill". Conservatives pronounce it "Frankfort"
Trump is making some sort of a comeback in polls. But even Trump is showing signs of dementia
Are you sending your children to school ?Our children's health should come first  It seems as though Trump wants everyone to die  He's certainly helped enough people to do so Totally irresponsible
Why not?  If he's serious about his order he should enforce it completely.    Just another example of how Trump does shit without thinking it through. Complete and utter incompetence at every level of his Maladministration.
One week I after I gave Mika and you the Trump Impeachment Smash Pouch Prayer, I relating the concept of smashing down symbolic trump &amp; hearkening Abraham's angels to heal &amp; unite us. He said, "I am not Abraham, but I will do what I can, and then place Kippah on his head."
The majority of Americans at this point don‚Äôt want this. Trumps approval is at 38%. He sowed a dis-information campaign amongst our lesser-blessed citizens to win initially (some of us were kicking and screaming) At this point many moderates and poor have figured out Trump is bad
I think a trump had by killing over 160000 people
Agreed. People will say Obama failed with H1N1, despite his immediate response. We didn't have a Pandemic because Obama acted, yet they don't mention those deaths occurred over 11 years, at a 62,000 deaths total, while in 6 months under Trump, 160,000. Fast forward 11 years. Bad!

In front of Kirsten Gillebrand, I actually welcomed her to a rally by giving her a Kirsten yarmulke and smashing Trump impeachment glass, right in front of her. Her response: le Chaim!
Why you won't hear a disparaging word  --   Because our society responds negatively to people who punch down.  But trump "punches down" all the time. He does it so often we expect it from him. What an insecure person he is.
Trump issued two executive orders, one for each app, which take effect in 45 days.
This is the same crap JFK went thru  Biden had always made it clear how his faith has helped him in life As the granddaughter of a Baptist minister you are being a hypocrite supporting Trump He is not religious at all He can't even quote one Bible verse
I can not wait until you are in the White House I have family in Arizona but they are total Trumpers and will not take this pandemic seriously The information Trump has given with Fox channel is killing people  These Governors should be charged with manslaughter
The more time goes on, Trump continues to peel his own onion, revealing the genuine wickedness from within.
Trump administration is using a private server and also WhatsApp.  Your point?

They aren‚Äôt exploiting him. He wants to help Trump- he wants to inflate his ego further.   He‚Äôs not crazy- he‚Äôs selfish
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm voting for Trump!
Why is that the priority? Haven‚Äôt the last 4 years of trump been relatively ok?
He did. He had said many degrading and sexual things about his daughter. Yes, I do make a big deal out of things Trump does, as should any sane person, because he has done things during his presidency that would get anyone else locked away for the rest of their lives.
It doesn't matter who she is. Her FATHER is calling her hot. Trump has tried to mack on her MULTIPLE TIMES. He is a sexual predator of the worst kind. Anyone who can still support him after what he has done needs to be checked into the loony bin.
Twitter and Facebook claimed to have removed hundreds of fake accounts purporting to be black conservatives (obviously to minimize the appearance of black support for Trump). However, here's one example of MANY I could show you of Twitter using NPC botnets posing as blacks
But it shouldn't have been.   Trump fought blue states for Ppe,  machines and Masks.  If this had been 1 state yoiu could say governor.   This was country wide goes to Feds.
PolitiFact - No, Joe Biden isn‚Äôt 'on board with defunding police'
Because you‚Äôre white and your life won‚Äôt be any worse than it is now with Trump in office. That‚Äôs white privilege.
I would ask, "Senator Lindsay Graham, given how often you've spoken out about how pedophiles and how bad they are, why are you still so strongly supporting Donald Trump? You know, perhaps more than anyone else, what he is. Does Trump have dirt on you?"  That's what I would ask.
Here's an example of a #LeftistIdiot.  as it's premise claims Trump is a #BiblicalIdiot which implies lack of Bible knowledge. However, the video only points out hypocrisy (from 10 years ago). That logic only highlights inconsistency, not ignorance. Meidas is stupid
It is quite obvious that the Left is now trying to garner the religious votes. Today, they claimed that when Trump attacked Biden for being "against God" it was specifically an attack on Catholics. Atheists are against God. So are all attacks against atheism now anti-Catholic?üôÑ

Never Trumpers are more Republican than he ever was.  Trump is not a conservative.  No person or party has a monopoly on good ideas.
I've personally decided that I'm going to grit my teeth and vote for biden in november specifically because of the threat Trump poses. But I've made videos about this topic in the past.
Trump self portrait.

Go President Trump!
They dont car if its tested. They only care if it has the Trump label on it. Thats what being part of the cult requires. ANYTHING the doofus says they will defend to the death.
I'm terrified that if Trump stays in office that last number will happen
Perhaps at the debates  both men should be asked to recite their favorite Bible verse and where it comes from I would also like to see them sit on the floor and see who gets up first I'd bet money Trump would lose on that
Well hell Trump said Biden would destroy energy ü§™What's next?Music meat bread wine and animals
Thanks for the information Maybe pardons should not be allowed by the POTUS anymore Perhaps a board of directors to make decisions Trump pardoned Blago for us and people in Illinois were furious

Evangelicals see Trump as God He is their golden calf I should know My sister supports him completely In her eyes he can do no wrong It's useless to try to reach them It's a total cult
People voted for Trump right??
Well that figures Is anyone that supports Trump decent?
I can not even begin with this one The same class as Michelle Obama ? Betty Ford Barbara Bush ? I don't care Ms Trump was born in another country but she has no class in my book What has she done for the White House Decorated badly and spent money on her hair Be Bestü§™

Do you have an issue with right wing Trump supporters violence? Since there is actual proof of that?
Was thinking GITMO  but close enough :)
It‚Äôs not a feeling it‚Äôs an observation based on fact. Don‚Äôt take my word
I support the candidate who isn‚Äôt going to continue to be woefully inadequate. It‚Äôs a 2 part my system. I‚Äôm a realist. Left politics survive under Biden. They wilt and die under Trump.
We know who Biden is. We know who Trump is.   It‚Äôs not checkers it‚Äôs chess. Trump is a nowhere strategy where at least democrats won‚Äôt continue basic strategies of voter suppression
Yeah, Democrat districts where the elected officials get to staff their health departments and coroners with Leftist medical workers who won't hesitate to lie on a cause of death certificate or diagnose bee sting as COVID. That's why I'll die before I'd go to an ICU in a dem city
Michelle Obama claims to suffer from low-grade depression because of Trump.   They used to call that WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH  She also suffers from high-grade HateAmericaism ‚û°Ô∏è
Is a Trump supporter really going to lecture me on a political candidate making incendiary racist remarks?
So those links include studies in the US, the UK and Spain. All found same results. The FDA (which works for Trump) said don‚Äôt take it. What could anyone possibly say to make you believe it‚Äôs not effective? What would it take to change your mind?
The MeidasDouche #TrumpKillsSeniors meme among all the other propaganda the Left puts out, is pretty stupid. They're basically saying Trump wants to kill everyone who would vote for himüòÜ  How about #TheLeftKillsEveryone including babies, whistleblowers, investigators, etc...
I think it was a poor choice of words. But I also stand by my statement that Trump supporters live in an alternate reality
Leftists: "Trump said Biden doesn't follow the Bible. That's an attack on the Catholic faith"  Also Leftists: "None of you Christians who support Trump follow the Bible"  Ergo the Left thinks we're all Catholic (I'm CERTAINLY not) and is attacking us for itüòÇ
So far today Trump claimed Biden is Thanos, yet he's diminished and addled. Then he talked about the country of Thigh-land
In Trump's mind it is 1955 That is what he wants Jim Crow laws and women in the kitchen barefoot and pregnant I never thought I'd see any man still like this

Breaking glass signifies smashing down corrupt American soul that Trump has corrupted. In Jewish weddings the groom smashes down glass, to relate to original breaking of vessels, fall from Grace. We must work together, with Gods help to put things back together again
Given the #FailedGOPMembership's failure to hold Trump accountable for his #Incompetence, #BlatantRacism, attacking American Citizens, not to mention his failure to  control the spread of the #Covid19Virus was a simple proposition, #NeverRepublican seems right to me for America!

Imagine how much she would have housed Trump if she was sober.
Aw. You say bye, yet here you are. Seems like your understanding of ‚Äúbye‚Äù is as keen as your understanding of Trump‚Äôs idiocy. Sad.
Trump is not interested in the facts. His desire is only to divide. Every utterance from his lungs, throat, cheeks, teeth and lips is a deception.
Anyone who has seen Joe Biden in action knows he can't be President, so Trump must win to save this country.
Trump will come up with something worse to say shortly - that‚Äôs what the Biden team is banking on.
When Trump wins, again why will not concede!!
Are we STILL doing this like 2016 never happened and isn‚Äôt about to happen again? BERNIE IS OVER, FOCUS ON GETTING TRUMP OUT
Trump would say it was rigged against him.
He's only voted with Trump 91% of the time.  I can see him getting primaried as a RINO, that's how bad the Republican Party has become.
Whoever is careless with the truth and lies about small matters cannot be trusted with important matters. - Albert Einstein  If Trump been reasonable, &amp; ethical, he could have MAGA. Instead, he's created the complete opposite, which was predictable.  I wrote this Dec 8, 2015
She‚Äôs been blocking anyone who believes in science and not worshiping Trump
These people are all racists at heart and they whole heartedly support trump because he emboldens their racism with out being obvious about it. Some in the GOP support him out of party loyalty, these are the ones who can be converted bc they arent inherently racist.
Have you listened to Trump? üò¨
President Trump is exploring options to use executive authority to extend a partial eviction ban and address unemployment benefits.
Omg I didnt see this. Good thing trump isn't a manipulative lying egotistical narcissist that has been contradicted by intelligence agencies and the DOJ or else id think hes lying for political gain.
Not to be there one to give any credit to a member of the Trump Family because most of them are deplorable human beings but his older brother Freddy was a pilot in the Air Force Reserves
He could but I'd bet every penny I have Trump will not do anything ever
Did you all not see what the Left did to people while Trump is president? Stone? Flynn? Imagine what they'll do with Biden and his AG. EVERY ONE OF YOU who are outspoken conservatives are marked, and you better decide now what you're going to do in Nov in spite of the vote 1776
The only way we can regain our national soul, is to smash down trumpism and pray for our better angels to heal and unite us. Trump is consumed by the darkest of all angels. Satan.
#DonsNextCon?üòÇ Here's #TheLeftsNextCon. Beirut is telling citizens to leave the city. This will create a 'migrant crisis'. Democrats will vow to welcome Muslim migrants (Biden needs all the votes he can get), then blame Trump for being racist if it doesn't happen overnight

I can get down with a good media puppetteer conspiracy theory, but they don‚Äôt single out trump. Narcissists have a way of making people feel like they are always the hero or the victim. I follow the whole spectrum. There‚Äôs left, there‚Äôa middle, and there‚Äôs right.
Thats not a Facebook meme. It has to be fake news. This guy has a grainy green text qanon screenshot that was taken on 4chan before antifa blew up his hideout and deleted his proof stash. But its real for sure because trump said beleve me 3 times on a Tuesday which is code. Duh!
The media isn‚Äôt one entity. It‚Äôs 1000‚Äôs, or maybe even in the millions of entities that just serve their own interest to get people interested in them. It doesn‚Äôt have 1 mind that is out to get trump. They just want readers and clicks. and we 100 also rely on and need free press

Your opinion is granted. In summation, I think we need Trump off as many things as possible and out of office. But most importantly, people like you and I have to come to the middle and talk.
People flock to trump.  It‚Äôs his gift. But it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs a professional bull artist. He‚Äôs spent his whole life trying to convince everyone he‚Äôs a great businessman He has problems. Biden is a figurehead to re-instate the establishment until we can figure this sh*t out
And coming back around to Twitter (and not to pile on when you tactfully concede) but would they not be liable if trump said some dumb sh*t and people went out and did it or attacked someone or whatever?
HCQ is not proven effective by all accounts but the far rights‚Äô. I follow them all. Trump leads and they follow. There may be some special interest I‚Äôm not sure but we need Remdesivir
The ONE thing we need to effectively run democracy is an election everyone can trust. And trump is trying to take a sledgehammer to it to save his own ass. That is why I celebrate when he is shut down
Well to be fair I do feel like that‚Äôs one problem with society 2020 is there isn‚Äôt an objective bastion of truth everyone can run to. But it ain‚Äôt trump man. The establishment has its inherent flaws but that guy is destroying our institutions that actually do us a lot of good
The post in question featured a link to a video, in which Trump says children are ‚Äúvirtually immune‚Äù to the coronavirus.
The clintons may or not be scum bags, I digress, but trump is most certainly a scumbag, and the sitting president, and will do or say anything to get himself re-elected and that is a danger to everyone. In my subjective mind I‚Äôm defending America because I love it. Shut him down
Is twitter liable by law if Trump tells people to do things, as the president, via Twitter?   Such as taking hydroxychloroquine to cure coronavirus, that an American citizen is commiting treason?  What the hell is the president doing screaming in all caps on Twitter anyway?
If conservatives were real Americans they would shut trump down now before he destroys the rest of our national security and the integrity of our elections. Honestly, honestly, it‚Äôs your blatant disregard that is troubling
Trump doesn‚Äôt have the right to impose his will on private companies. Isn‚Äôt that what you conservatives always want to avoid?  Government imposing on private business?  I‚Äôm a political science major homie. History is not something I avoid
Ha censorship?  Trump spreads lies on twitter on the daily. If you can‚Äôt see it it‚Äôs your blatant disregard. Twitter should have shut him and he down a long time ago. It‚Äôs a private company. They use the platform to bash, among other things, Twitter itself. They owe him nothing
I honestly do not know why Trump wants to debate Biden What does Trump have to stand on The economy? No His handling of Covid 19 No Trump is hoping to make Biden look stupid It's his ego that's the only reason he wants to debate He really lives in an alternate universe

This claim is just laughable on its face.   's support of gay marriage in 2012 was seen as the tipping point in the fight for marriage equality.    Trump opposes trans rights for military service members and cannot credibly claim to have done more.

What was Trump‚Äôs leverage in the wall funding negotiations?
Thats giving the too much credit. Nitpick? I'd say just invent your own reality. Lets accuse hospitals and doctors of fudging cases because they make Trump look bad. Lets pretend mail in voting is fraudulent. Lets pretend all protesters/rioters are "Antifa".
My God what in the hell is wrong with people I'm so of people being so damned stupid and cruel Dr Fauci does not deserve this Trump is responsible for this
And you didn‚Äôt answer the question about wall funding negotiations. Since you‚Äôre clearly not an idiot, you must just be avoiding the question. Understandable, considering how Trump had no hand in that negotiation and looked.....sad.

We need to weed out the trump at the polls and a plant a better tree with stronger, more diverse  roots.
Remember how David Frost interviewed Nixon? This was another one of those moments About time Ironic how it took a journalist from another country to do it Are American journalists scared of Trump Most of them act like it
Yes, wear a mask so traffickers can't be recognized, missing children whose photos are distributed have a harder time being identified and rescued. Interesting how crack downs on masks ramped up when Trump elevating more border restrictions that would hinder trafficking
He‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs guy so unfortunately he gives zero fucks.
Its just as plausible that the deaths are a ten times as many and the Trump admin is hiding the true numbers. See? Its easy to make up bat shit crazy conspiracy theories. Is mine so "implausible"?

He dum. There‚Äôs no wrong answer here. He‚Äôs being asked about his interpretation of a situation. To answer Trump‚Äôs: yes, everyone knows what every topic means to them. No points awarded.
His staff should have spelled it that way on his notes.  Staff do that ALL the time. Trump does not have adequate staff is a minor quibble against the whole of Mango Mussolini, but Mussolini's generals would never have allowed this kind of public embarrassment.

Sure, but also doesn‚Äôt give you a higher IQ. Trump definitely has a skill set, there‚Äôs no denying that since he‚Äôs in the White House. It just doesn‚Äôt make him good at negotiating, because he‚Äôs just not. Just look at the wall funding and North Korean negotiations. They were awful.
Absolutely! However, they positively didn‚Äôt get the head start with capital and existing business that Trump got handed. Not even close.
You can tell by the clips of this interview that Trump is used to being surrounded by yes men. Any time Swan (repeatedly) counters something he says, Trump doesn't present evidence or counter that point. He just continues on with the dumb lie he wants to say
...Trump is nothing more than a homeopathic poison for the rest of us to mobilize against, to weed out hate and to occupy the dream.

Trump provides a perfect example of a soul totally consumed by the evil inclination. As far as I am concerned his sole purpose in reality is to awaken society to compost his weed like desires into a greater sense of community. The first step is to vote him out of office

Biden is also guilty of sexual harrassment and seems to have dementia. He has also made racist comments. Trump is tough on crime, stands for gun freedom, and is against abortion. Most Christians like this.

Trump figures he's killed off 100K Seniors so why not steal money from Social Security and Medicare?  When people show you who they are believe them.  #Trumpers #Birthers #Deplorables #Magats #Bigots
Oh, no, remember, kids are, ‚Äùstoppers.‚Äù A new fangled epidemiology term right up there with #HydroxyChloroquine See tweet below. It could literally be a PSAT Q., Trump is to HQA as #DeVos is to stoppers. If we have that anymore? Sadly.
No way! He's going to withdraw his court challenge to Obamacare?  Such good news!  Wait, it's just another empty promise from an empty suit? Ah. Well, that's all Trump's got to offer anyway.
i called out an (ex) good friend yesterday for being a trump supporter and today he called me a bigot then gave the definition of a bigot. Weird turn later on when he explained what google does. Weird times
I give Trump a shot in November because of that.
Repair/trump reperation.
I hate how people are like ‚Äúpeople who voted for Trump are so racist!‚Äù Like y‚Äôall know how many people voted for Hilary and are racist af LMAO I hate politics man. Trash!
So what? Trump is at his country club.
That is a confession that they did help trump, but no one cares what trump told you to climb anything.
Go watch him lie on Fox.  People are tired of Trump. 160K Dead and he's golfing????   No, we don't want to hear his lies.
Trump should issue executive order to get people like you FIRED!
Trump talks out of his a** so much that you cannot trust anything he says.  No credibility.
This is what happens when you open the door to foreign influence. I don‚Äôt like it either way. I have a feeling Trump may be a little more willing to listen to efforts to improve election security now that there are countries that may be involved that want him out.
Trump seems to have caved but the proof is in the pudding. Let‚Äôs see the fine print.
I think  is confused.  He seems to be describing Trump‚Äôs base.

No it isn't a moot argument. If she's bringing someone else down due to her religious reasoning then I can point out how she is wrong because she is clearly endorsing worse behavior. If you blame Cardi B for ruining family values you shouldn't be supporting trump. Redundant

Required reading for Trump supporters. If I could have them read one thing I would have them read this:

Is Trump involved in any of the policies? Or is his cabinet running everything and not telling him?

Donald Trump failed to close the borders when corona started, so you‚Äôre 100% correct. A man caused all of this.

But you got to understand is that it doesn't matter if Trump wins or Biden, wins we all lose in the end. Both are basically the same except one is a fascist. I'm not going to vote for the lesser up to evils again because "orange man bad".
I would agree with this. No doubt Trump is closer to the core Republican base than the swamp guys and that‚Äôs why he won the nomination
Why is Cardi B the daughter of the devil but Trump is someone you're praying for? God didn't put anyone in office, you and your fellow Republicans did. Don't absolve yourself of responsibility. How are you so deluded...
I never endorsed this music, I think it's rich that Republicans are attacking it when the president they elected has done much worse and isn't for family values in the slightest. You expect cardi b to have family values but not Trump.
I mean you have literally retweeted tons of trump shit so idk what to tell you
What I'm saying is that doesn't make any sense. If you're not voting for anyone, then you're not voting for anyone it's very simple I don't care if Joe and Trump are the two main candidates, no one is entitled to our vote.
Just last week Trump asked to extend it while they work on another stimulus SHE REFUSED she was asked earlier this week she said NO again. Go back and watch her interviews.
Any person who believes Trump has a more authentic faith than Joe needs to STHU and sit down.  What a ridiculous, delusional position to take. I‚Äôm agnostic, I wouldn‚Äôt care if he was too. What I do care about are fake, dishonest attacks to defend a fake, dishonest conman.

He'll win don't worry about it. 90% of America is voting for Donald Trump again. It's the little 10% of the atheist lies on the fake news that tells you he's losing they try to scare us fuck them.

Voting for Biden and Trump is a waste of a vote
Trump makes so many gaffes, that I miss many of them. I didn't hear this one at the time, but I see nor reason not to remind  about his past mistakes
Voting for Trump and Biden is a waste of a vote. I'm tired of voting for the lesser up to evils like we always have and I'm damn sure not going to vote for pedo, pro police, pro war, racist Biden because "orange man bad " so I might either withhold my vote or vote third party.
If you only dump Trump and don't also dump those who have enabled him to remain in office (in this case nearly every other elected Republican) you'll just get another Trump in short order.  Like I've told any gross friends  "Clean your house and maybe I'll come over again"
They don't have to Google it. If Trump says there are palm trees in Indiana,  you bet there are palm trees there. Anything else is fake news

No, you don't. Trump isn't Racist at all. It's just a Leftist media smear campaign. Historic funding to HBCUs, First step act, opportunity zone investments to poor Black neighborhoods, Young Black white house leadership meeting.  So some research please. Stop listening to media.
Hmmm.... Trump must be doing something right

No matter how deep you dig for him to be right, he is wrong. To justify his gaffe you had to turn to regional dialects.  Of which Trump doesn't have. Was he using a different dialect saying "Yosemite" too?  Show yourself some respect and quit defending that nutter.
Your publushed musing about wasting your vote on a write-in for president is irresponsible, and you know it. We have a two-party system. A vote not cast for Biden is a vote cast for Trump, whose re-election is unacceptable.
What happened to you? Your present role as #MorningPropagandist is very disheartening. Do you think everybody is stupid because you wanted to be a #PinkPuma operative? This 24/7 Anti-Trump format is going to blow up in your face. You‚Äôve thrown yourself overboard. #NuGOP
Then why did trump say it "incorrectly" immediately after he said it "correctly?"   Have all of us also been mispronouncing "Yosemite?" Or "anonymous?" Or "origins?" Or "Ulysses?"

I think he is trying to steal as much of our treasure before he bails out of the election. He is not going to accept the Republican nomination for presidency. Soon after the selection, Pence will pardon Trump and his family.

Guys we need to take control and spread the real news and truth of what‚Äôs going on. This is not the only doctor I‚Äôve heard this from.   #Hydroxychloroquine #Zinc #doctor #medicalfield #hospitals  #Fauci #Kovid19 #trump #Trump2020
Against trump is an understatement. I‚Äôm a former republican... but never again.
Not wishing harm to an innocent child.  Just trying to point out the contradiction of Trump wanting OTHER people's kids put in harms way for his election benefit.
Wasn't Facebook where Russia established fake accounts and stirred up demonstrations, and pitched for Putin's Trump.
Still not worse than tRump!!  Never will be.
He will never say anything bad enough for me to change my mind about tRump.  No matter what tRump has to go.
Still no where near as bad as 100 things tRump has said.   Please!
My votes for law and order! 4 more years President Trump!

This sums up Trump very succinctly.
"I am a special education teacher and lifelong Republican who reluctantly voted for Donald Trump in 2016 as the less bad of two bad choices." There is nothing that you can show me that validates this quote! You couldn't have proven this in 2016!

We can‚Äôt even VISIT Italy, much less move there.  Trump has made US into the number one ‚Äòshithole country‚Äô.

So according to Trump‚Äôs logic if we did less cancer screenings we‚Äôd have less with cancer?
so much other important shit going on &amp; Trump is worried about fucking TikTok lolllll
Most voters aren‚Äôt swing voters. Hillary won more votes than Trump. If the young African-American males that voted for Obama had bothered to vote in 2016, Hillary would have won. If Jill Stein‚Äôs voters had cared about the country, Hillary would have won.
Wait...you think it‚Äôs a hoax, and you support whatever Trump says. He says that testing is bad. The only thing worse than a liar is a liar who is a hypocrite.
I am wrestling with such anger these days over having this idiot in the oval. Every day it‚Äôs something else. I have a cousin who is defending Dr. Demon Sperm because Trump did. It‚Äôs all just unbelievable.

Can we just tell Trump supporters the election IS delayed?
Trump goons
Trump delayed, trump denied, trump lied, 155,000 Americans died
I agree. 100 days of trump lying, cheating and stealing can change a lot of things. I also think the cancelling/sanitized history issue is giving him a ton of votes.
Anyway, who wants to buy a 100k account before trump deletes
Cmon, you don't know almost all the media, our allies, the entire world, and the deep state are all in a coordinated effort to bash our dear leader trump! /s

Preposterous that the monkeys R complaining about eviction, when in fact they don't realize they're all born 2 serve investors or they have no place on this earth. Right now priority is 4 Trump/Pelosi and cabal to steal Trillions for investors overseas.

What Steve Scalise wont ask. "If Trump has blocked travel earlier from Europe would more lives been saved?" etc. Of course blocking travel saves lives. The issue isnt that travel was blocked, it is because travel wasnt blocked soon enough.
Yes Steve Scalise. Killing it! If every dem could watch the 5 minutes he just had, they would finally understand how Trump has been dealing with Corona like a boss. Way to go buddy! üí™üèº
Not all tRump supporters understand that they are racist.
It sends exact signal trump wants. He probably got something from somebody to do it. He never does anything for American people.
I just need facts, not bs. I would like a time delay for everything trump says so that a fact check could be scrolled at bottom.   I would like honest polls which show electoral poll as well as popular.   I would like GOP to care for people over money for 30 days.

Trump wants to know election results the night of the election because Republicans have figured out how to manipulate electronic voting booths. In 2020 we expect an accurate count and a day or two doesn‚Äôt make a lot of difference with mail in ballots that are sent a week early.
I am asking that we have a new segment on "The New Abnormal" called "Really Dumb Guy/Girl OR Smart Dumb Guy/Girl where you separate the various Trump clan lackies, toadies, lickspittles and demon-spawn into one of the two categories.

The Reason Trump‚Äôs a Monster ‚Äì Markin Report
Trump had it right 4 months ago when he stated if we left it up to the medical people, we would be on lockdown for 3 yrs. They have no concept of the negative ramifications caused by the lockdowns.  They are focused solely on eliminating the virus, at alll costs.  Not practical.
You wouldn‚Äôt have to say Hillary Clinton‚Äôs name either, you might remember when she called Trump supporters deplorables
this is not a matter of spineless or fake news, for Trump it is a matter of deep loyalty and allegiance to his country of origins, Russia, and his Creed, which is exactly that of Putin, Judaism.
You believe that. Don‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. And that‚Äôs my point. You haven‚Äôt see he/she. So you don‚Äôt know. And if god is always in control like y‚Äôall love to say, then god gave y‚Äôall Donald Trump! Gotta love it üòÇ
Hello. I have a question for you and other TSB members. I live with my sister in the western suburbs of Chicago. We want to get involved in defeating Trump, but aren‚Äôt sure how - especially given our various physical limitations. Suggestions?
Probably worse than Arnold, who tried (and failed) to sell surrender of Fort Arnold/Fort Clinton to the British for ¬£20,000. Trump has profited from his presidency and successfully killed many whilst demolishing the country's reputation.
Sorry this wonderful person had to die because of trump's weak leadership.  Everyone needs to listen to the experts and stop listening to the orange bafoon in our white house!
On November 3rd, #WeWillVote as scheduled. Any delay of any kind is unconstitutional! Trump is a disgrace to the human race! I've heard of chimpanzees being smart. I think they would beat Trump in the cognitive test. #TrumpleThinSkin

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Even if its not Trump's  FAULT he absolutely did next to NOTHING to make it better.
They won‚Äôt be able to blame the mask wearing since he didn‚Äôt wear one... I wonder if this will change Trump‚Äôs tune? Oh yeah, right, he doesn‚Äôt give a shit about anyone but himself. Not even his ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù
He got jealous that Trump got all the attention for bad hair.
Another Russian tactic. When is Trump going to realize Russia is making a fool out of him?

Laying the blame on Trump and his administration for the scourge that Communist China released on the world is fairly typical of the Marxist Democrats who instead of working with the administration, initiated many inane and failed investigations including a sham impeachment.
Yo what has Trump done for this country? Like dead ass I really want to know.
We need President Trump who is not afraid to rock the boat and to deal with these countries who take economic advantage of our nation. His predecessors were just too inept, too complacent and did not have the business acumen nor the balls to stand up and renegotiate trade deals.
Trump doesn't even hide it...  This old Marine is voting in person! F*CK THE VIRUS! F*Ck TRUMP! SEMPER-FI!!!
No, no, no.  The reason we have more cases is because we test more. Testing clearly causes the cases.  Thus sayeth trump.
I don‚Äôt believe those other countries are using HCQ at all.  That‚Äôs being touted only by trump.

Trump is an oaf, cheated his way into Wharton, went bankrupt, lies about his ill gotten gains, and traveled in a cloistered circle of syncophants.  And you are a convicted criminal who spent too little time in jail.
Huge news that happened in 2009-10! Huge thing that  already did that your putz of a President wants to repeal. Huge new lie to tell Trump‚Äôs base! Huge act of pathetic political theater!  Huge embarrassment for you, Jason. Where‚Äôs your self-respect? Who owns you? Sad.
Exactly. He might steal some of the black vote from trump. Lol
The Trump Pandemic has now killed 164,093 Americans. #FailedPresident #TrumpVirus
One hand washes the other. Today's republicans don't believe in a republic; a gov't of, by, &amp; for the people. Trump believes in a gov't that serves him, and McConnell believes in a gov't that serves his power and donors. They only call themselves republicans.  They are oligarchs.
TRUMP all the WAY!!
I wonder how long Trump will start calling him Lying Ted again?
Does Trump even care if there‚Äôs a desl? He‚Äôs (allegedly) the ‚Äúdeal-maker‚Äù - but can‚Äôt seem to be bothered to actually get involved.

What about Kushner‚Äôs ‚ÄùDemocide‚Äù initiative? His team withheld help for Blue States thinking Dems would be killed off. It backfired. Trump's criminality will hurt Republicans, eventually.
I don't see how some black and Jewish people don't get this. Racists tend to hate both of us. And if they do keep us around ahem, Stephen Miller and diamond and silk it is to justify how they aren't racist. Imagine disrespecting your ancestors for trump.
Yes, however think of how the Republicans who voted to impeached Clinton has to defend Trump for this or the Christian right. The hypocrisy will be entertaining.
I propose a contest for Trump‚Äôs campaign nick-name.
#RampWalkerTrump Ramp-Walker Trump isn't LOVED by the Black population.
Not true. We actually hold him accountable but compare to trump meh
But he isn't. If it ok for Marc to support farrakhan then we have to be okay with white people supporting trump. There are no levels of racism. If you are a rando that hates Jews you are no better than the president who hates black people. Sure the president can do more damage.
And trump saying he would fuck ovanla. Lol
I'm not as rich as trump, but if class were counted in dollar bills, Trump would be a pauper compared to me. just sayin'.
But both are abhorrent are they not? You're right trump has more power and influence with his racism. But Farrakhan also comes from his own position of power, however insignificant it is compared to trump. And his racism must be equally unacceptable.
I thought Trump is a world class negotiator. Isn't why people elected him?
And I heard his lawyer helping him file works for the Trump campaign.
We should all be embarrassed that China and Russia see our elections as some kind of proxy war. Any American president other than Donald Trump would be embarrassed, too. On November 3, we need to restore our place in the world.
The Trump administration and the MAGA movement has dragged us to the gates of hell.
And how many times did Trump bitch about President Obama signing Executive Orders??
They need jobs clubs are close. Doing it the right way. Trump needs a lesson
That Trump believes that Biden could "hurt God" exposes the shallowness, the superficiality, of Trump's own beliefs. Believers in God know that God is stronger than either Biden or Trump.
This is horrible- especially when Trump pardons real criminals.
No wonder Trump won't stand up to Putin!! (Beside the obvious fact that Trump is weak-willed.)
My dad got a purple heart for his bravery in WW2. He would be disgusted by Trump's politicization of the military. Have you talked to Putin about his bounty on our troops yet?
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes

Trump‚Äôs committed so many crimes against humanity. This is genocide as well as ‚ÄùDemocracide,‚Äù which Kushner's report proves. They all need to be tried.
Is the suggestion that we're not smart enough to understand Trump? That's BS. Anyone in the world can look through his facade of "businessman/dealmaker" and realize he is simply an ignorant, incompetent cruel liar. Oh yeah - he's a fraud also, as proven in court!
None of this immoral, politically-driven conduct is excusable. DeSantis would rather have Trump's approval than to the right thing for his state's residents.   -- &gt; I'm sure glad I don't live in Florida!

If he can get to that 270 fuck what the ballots say. I'd love to throw that in trump's face.
Trump remembers the full page ad he took out demanding the death penalty for 5 black men that didn't commit the crime they were accused of, right? And refusing to rent to black people for decades? Oh, but Joe said something dumb!
In the end Trump will be greatest thing ever to happen to American socialism as 1) evil gold-loving billionaire right out of central casting puts bad fave on capitalism 2) teaching 10s of millions the role of Prez is to aggressively intervene in free markets.

Don't forget that Trump, when pressed in a recent interview, couldn't name a favorite Bible verse, or even if he prefers the Old or New Testament. He said he likes them all equally, but it seemed clear he just had no idea of a legit answer (about what he claims is his fave book).
Trump really has a way of making Biden sound like he's a way better candidate than he actually is
I see.  This seems pretty on brand for Trump then.
Meghan and S.E. are Never Trumpers until it comes time to actually vote out Trump and then its "Heavens no, how can I go against my Republican values!"
We are paying for Mexican imports through USMCA and no new walls . Trump just replacing existing barriers.
I would wait ANY amount of time to vote Trump out.
trump is the most un-American president in U.S. history. He attacks almost every democratic institution. He no morals &amp; no ethics.
They should make a commercial about all the "god" things Trump has given us... except maybe the evangelicals will read that literally.   Fuck people are stupid.
If I say, "Trump's a fucking moron."  The focus is on my frustration.    If I say "Trump's a moron", that leaves open the ability to see the damage to the country and consider remedies. The argument is the same, but the way expressed has consequences.

Honestly, those even considering not voting against Trump don't deserve to be kowtowed to or even considered. It is absolutely irrational under any semblance or shade of conservatism to help Trump. Maybe I'd rethink that position if Warren or Bernie were on the D ticket.
I agree. The benefit of Susan Rice is we get to Russia/Syria/NATO/foreign policy. Which, for Trump, has been a complete and utter total disaster.

Because moron, they actually donate to good causes. They have an incredibly high rating. Unlike the Trump foundation which had to close down because of fraud.
What‚Äôs that racist sheriff name who loves trump,again
Yes that where they began but grand poopoo David duke love trumps. Racist marching with tiki torches loves trump.
Apparently conservatism and pragmatism are mutually exclusive for you. Another 4 years of Trump will annihilate your conservative ideals.
Trump: "Biden is against God." Biden: "Sorry I didn't immediately respond to our lying, misleading Tweet.  I just returned from Church." Trump: "Hush, this is an important putt!"
No one is going to please everyone. No one is going to be perfect. And no one is Pence or Trump besides those imbeciles.
With Trump in power? What the fuck?
That isn't what he said but go off. You know what trump did say tho? Yo, semites.
Susan Rice ideally but Kamala is my second choice. In an ideal world where I could pick just to piss off trump? Barack or Michelle.
I just got off the phone with God.   He says He's getting a record number of complaints about Trump and wishes He had never created the whole damned Trump family.   God said something about Beelzebub, and how he continues to cause nothing but trouble, but it's beyond His control.
No one knew how cheap trump was to buy. Corrupt like the world has. Never seen.
Dumb as hell but compare to trump.
Dude check my feed. Look at how people is upset at what Biden said but was like fuck it compare to trump. Feel free to she how the 98% live
Why do you post these inane headlines? This is not news. You are spreading falsehoods. Have you covered whether Trump has ever been known to be a church member or church-goer during his adult life? Biden has been a devout Catholic his entire life.
Dan, check the story behind ur claim as it‚Äôs the total opposite of what the propaganda machine has feed u, trump was the first person to go to the authorities re Epstein being a pedo. Search palm beach news, espstein got out smarter by trump on a real estate deal. 5d chess.
That‚Äôs how I feel I tried to explain to trumpkins pointing this out. Like compare to trump meh and that is sad as well. But he pushing it
So if that is shutting on black folks what trump been doing oops
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ now do trump oops and all those racist flying confederate flags ooops.
Who said it wouldn‚Äôt but compare to trump it will be minimal and also coming from trumpkin doesn‚Äôt help either. Just saying
Nice that anything done poorly was the fault of "the governors" and anything positive was Trump. I'm not sure that's how things really work here in the real world.
Nice to see Trump will ONCE AGAIN be playing golf and enriching his own company rather than doing the work of being President.  #VoteDEM2020
Next time give me a better option. Racist trump over moderate joe there is no contest. Why you think we pushing for a black VP. To check him on dumb shit like that.
Her Facebook is a trump cult page in general ü§£
So what do you want to do, burn the state?  At least President Trump can find Ohio.  Where's O'biden?  Obama speaks for Biden, Jill speaks for Biden, but Biden never speaks?  Takes no candid questions, only responds to specific journalists, when he knows the question &amp; answer.Biden and Trump locked in. Ye sketching out a solid plan, ppl don‚Äôt like his comments about slavery and Harriet so I don‚Äôt see it gaining real tractionüò≠
Trump sings Executive Order,  declaring "Saturday is NOW part of The Weekend"!!!
I see a lot of hypocrats putting the deaths from covid on trump will they blame nurses and doctors when they see this ?
We all understand you are doing the best you can President Trump, thank you.
Jordan is SWEATING about this Trump and TikTok dilemma
Did somebody pop white smoke when Donald Trump was elected? If so I missed that.
Never trump gives us a Biden presidency.
Just released ‚Äî   Preliminaries for the Trump v. Biden Debate:  1. Bill Walton v. Lou Holtz 2. Gary Busey v. Jose Canseco 3. Dick Vitale v. Tim McCarver
Known tool to steel information off your phone I deleted it as soon as I heard and it wasn‚Äôt from Trump he just repeated info
Biden carries a Rosary with him... EVERY DAY!!!  Trump carries Hepatitis, Herpes and enough Adderall to kill a small horse!!!
Trump say the rich people mad at him and expect not to see him for ‚Äúawhile‚Äù so I‚Äôm expecting August to be wildüò≠
I love how thousands of Americans are dying everyday due to a global pandemic and he is worrying about TikTok
I don't know.
If Joe Biden's family cared about him, they wouldn't let the Democrats use him. My God love your father/husband more than you hate Trump. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #WalkAway #TrumpTrain #follo4follo #KAG #FreedomOfSpeech #BuildTheWall #VoterIDNow
Clearly you don't know how our voting system works.  A vote for anyone other than Biden is just helping Trump.
So if Trump wasn‚Äôt president, there wouldn‚Äôt be a single COVID death?
Isn‚Äôt that what trump does best?
Awesome. I love it when our leaders support women's healthcare needs. Just another reason to vote for Biden over Trump.
I rather politicians show their true colors like Joe Biden and Donald Trump instead of the continuous pandering.
Trump took None of his advice remember?? No the fall guy is Trump not Fauci
Heard someone say they didn't like Trump because he's not nice. 1st is not true. 2nd Jimmy Carter was a very nice Christain man, not a good Potus. It took our 1st Divorced Potus, Reagan to SAVE AMERICA. #DonaldTrump is not my pastor/Priest., he is an awesome President.#Maga #KAG
Mark my words, the left is showing you know what life under their control would look like. People are fleeing from New York, Chicago, &amp; California, Portland, etc.. Ask yourself Why? And if you continue to vote Democrat, your insane. #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica #MAGA #Trump #voterID
I will be voting TRUMP
Haven't you heard?!? Evidently...according to Trump.   They're as loud as a Jumbo Jet &amp; SLAUGHTER MILLIONS of birds!!!üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Well...we knew she was getting murdered as soon as Trump, "wished her well"!!!
Great point. Make no mistake...a conservative vote for Biden is not (necessarily) a converted Democrat/Liberal/Progressive. People are voting against Trump, not for Biden.
Comey went rogue.    Sally Yates is forced to admit this rather than calling him out immediately in real time early in the Trump administration.
So is Trump a better alternative?  WTF????
This is Trump‚Äôs watch isn‚Äôt it?
We don‚Äôt need Trump to do anything he will be gone soon
Says a member of the party that takes every Trump tweet absolutely literally.
trump goonsü§Æ
I truly don't think minorities are worse off. I don't say that lightly, my neighbor &amp; family are diverse. At least look at the stats. If Trump's a racist, he's not very good at. Good luck &amp; God Bless
Do you honestly think black lives matter to Biden? If so how come the 8 years he was in office, he did nothing.He thinks blacks owe him, for what? Just compare facts &amp; actions, you will see Trump has done more in 3years than Biden in 40.
Why? It was one of the WORST interviews I've ever seen!!  Trumps own stupidity is the ONLY thing close to the truth that came out of it!!!  He NEVER made Trump actually ANSWER a single question that he asked. And instead allowed him to lie and Campaign!!!  Pitiful.
You know what else he did?!?  LET TRUMP NOT ANSWER A SINGLE FUCKING QUESTION HE ASKED HIM!!!  LET HIM TAKE EVERY QUESTION AND TURN IT INTO A CAMPAIGN SPEECH!!!  That "Journalist" needs to find a different job!!!!
No...they do what children do. They "Parrot" what the "leader of the gang" says!!  They have NO MORE idea of "What facts" they are talking about,  than Trump does when he says "Look at the stats! Read the books!".  IT'S ALL BLOWN SMOKE!
If you could cheat, PERIOD.  Trump would have won in 2016 by 59 Million votes!!
Trump will call this "A China guy  "forging ballots"!!
This is Trump‚Äôs watch still
Yes he will by the way is Trump anything articulate like Obama?
You just exaggerate everything like Trump schools will be pared down enrollment at schools or virtual no school system will EVER neglect our children they just want to keep them healthy I think you have been spoiled by all we have
I forget his name,  but is there still a Republican running against trump?
Trump's demand for US cut of a TikTok deal is unprecedented
No class or respect for democracy. They know Trump's base is bigger &amp; stronger than ever, so fraud is thier only answer. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #WalkAwayFromDemocratSocialists #VoterIDNow
One of his most serious faces!  So much better than the giddy schoolgirl grin trump gives putin.
My fiance is Russian,  adopted by Americans at 9 but raised in Europe while they worked at DoD schools. Came to the US when he enlisted in the military 3 yrs ago. Even he (who pronounces a lot of things wrong) can say this properly. Another WTH Trump..
That was a joke of his Trump has no sense of humor
Hey hate to be political again but whenever trump or his brainless followers spout "If we test less people the less cases we will have less cases!" I die a little more inside. Hey, surprise, just because you ignore/deny/neglect the problem doesn't mean it will disappear
Article: Hannity partners with RNC to fundraise for Trump‚Äôs re-election by selling ‚Äòpriority access‚Äô to his new book
‚ÄúWe should only honor former presidents who uphold our...democratic values.There should be no schools, bridges or statues devoted to Trump.His name should live in infamy, and he should be remembered, if at all, for precisely what he was ‚Äî not a president, but a blundering cheat.‚Äù
Gotta say it's pretty spectacular to watch Trump destroy himself every passing day with his handling of the pandemic. Just really sucks millions of people will be hurt in the process ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Corona baby Trump and co vote by mail
Good enough for Trump good enough for us
You are describing Trump perfectly
Yes but Trump‚Äôs base with no masks will be culled by the virus he is killing his base
You haven‚Äôt been doing well in court lately Trump 5 states have only mail in ballots 35 have no reason needed for mail in ballots we have been voting by mail now forever what are you afraid of?
Then I guess according to the same logic, Donald Trump as your president is working. Dont change what is working, right?
Do you like Trump? You seem like a bot who would. As a bot I'm not sure you can argue, but if you're really Misha you could refute this claim. Sincerely, Team Gishombies #Gishombies  #GISH2020
Agree Orangeman Trump bad
Do you remember the Republican President Reagan had dementia even if Trump or Biden had beginnings of dementia rather than normal aging they have advisors Biden listens a Trump does not ever so......
Biden has some common sense and empathy for all he will have the sense to take good advice Trump has no common sense and takes nobody‚Äôs advice
You got that type of stuff with Trump I‚Äôm afraid and look where we are now
Awesome Trump needs to get the hell out of our White House
Up 139% on murders. This is so wild how the media turns a blind eye to this to talk about something meaningless with Trump all day.
The saddest thing is Trump never had any cognitive ability in common sense, empathy, telling the truth his whole life
And a Trump is the best republicans have the pot calling the kettle black here
The Democrats need to start recruiting some more HARDASSES &amp; a lot less PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE PUSSIES!!!  If Trump was a Democrat... SOMEBODY in the GOP would have said, "Okay enough of this shit!". And had his ass assassinated!  Tell me I'm wrong!
Being proud of a New Appointment by Trump,   Is like bragging about getting to run your own Circuit City...  ...in July of 2008!!!
The only jobs that will disappear are Trump's and his administration.
But what kinda person would add swastikas and purposely put Trump in there... oh that‚Äôs right, leftists...
That would involve....involvement. And since Trump deemed NASA "Unnecessary". I doubt it even crossed his mind to, "ensure protection" for anyone.  Hell, EVER!!!
"Private Contacting"!  You think Elon gives 2 fucks about people's security?  He cares as much about people as Trump!!  NOW...if a LARGE unidentified ship were to come to take his capsule. Fighter Jets would be on them like COVID at a Gohmert staff meeting!!!
Trump promised he would be signing a new healthcare law today. Did i miss it,,?? #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpVirus #healthcare
That's the same way NYers know Trump. Terrible person.
Evidently YOU don't understand the "Trump Thing"!!! It's like Soylent Green!  "IT'S STUPID PEOPLE!! THE "TRUMP THING" IS STUPID PEOPLE!!!!"
I still wish that somehow the  would nominate anyone else. Hell, I‚Äôm a no name that‚Äôs 7 years too young, but I‚Äôm fairly confident I could do better than Trump
Absolutely!!! A debate would be nothing but Trump lying!! No fact checker fast enough has been born!
They talk to "A Lot of People"! The same "Lot" that Trump talks to, that tell him he's right!  The lot of VOICES in their heads!!!
Absolutely not!!  Is Mike Tyson supposed to ACTUALLY fight a Shark?!?  They wouldn't be able to be CLOSE to fast enough to fact check, the machine gun fire of bullshit Trump would spew!!!
Today would be a great day for tRump to resign. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #ObamaIsBetterAtEverything
No president has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.   You really need to quit watching CNN and MSNBC  Donald Trump is the greatest president since Lincoln  MAGA 2020
Tampering with US Mail is a Federal crime.  Why are no charges being brought against trump's lackey postmaster general?
If mail-in voting is allowed for this 2020 election and Trump loses by a slim margin, he‚Äôs not leaving the office.
Kanye and Trump are both Gemini‚Äôs running game on the world.
Trump is banning tiktok cause he mad that he got played by viewers at his rally üòê
Pretty sure they TRIED to buy TocTok-us. And China said F U! So now, Trump is tantruming!
Trump needs to leave Tik Tok alone. üôÑü§¨
bro trump is a bitch
Are you one of the one percent who has benefitted from Trump? Bet you will take that socialism social security check and Medicare when you can
Just like Bitch McConnell promised!!!  He's like Trump. On their way to the grave, and willing to take WHOEVER with them!!
He's not destroying it to "Help Trump"!   He's doing it BECAUSE HE WAS TOLD TO BY TRUMP!!!
THAT would require a sense of being fallible &amp; intelligence of forethought.   Both of which Trump is EXTREMELY LACKING!
10.  Because Trump has eliminated prenatal government healthcare!!!
Who says? First you accuse that election will be rigged by sloppy counting now you say be sloppy and rush counting you can‚Äôt have it both ways even in your scrambled brain Trump
It MAY be PARTLY true. WHY would they send anything? Bitch Mitch already BLATANT SAID he wouldn't pass anything!!!  OF COURSE there blaming Democrats!! Who else? Trump already said he didn't believe the "alien sitings"! So... THEY'RE OFF THE TABLE!
There's a documentary coming out, that Trump has been fighting in court to keep suppressed for 4 years! He just LOST!!! It gets released next month!!!  That MIGHT be a topic.
This is perfect. Trump supporters have no idea HOW DUMB YOU LOOK. "Hes trying to help us" LMFFAAAOOOOOOüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠  Absolute dumbfucks of the highest degree‚Å∞
BOTTOM LINE:  There WAS a department set up to handle pandemic response and reaction.   PRESIDENT TRUMP DIFFUSED &amp; DISMANTLED IT!!!  There was a "Pantry" of supplies.   PRESIDENT TRUMP SOLD AND DEPLETED IT!!!     ****THESE ARE FACTS****
This is insane. Trump and his gang of criminals need to go ASAP.
Get ready. Trump will Not admit he lost this election.. he either will win or it was stolen from him. Time frame from Election day until  first day in office could be crazy.
Rubio would have beat HRC far more easily than Trump did.  Polled far more strongly against her, and wasn't held down by tremendously low personal favorability ratings.
What a stupidly leading question asking if he was joking. Trump tweets are never jokes.
Don‚Äôt you hate that we have a free press Trump?
Americans wake up to the Trump threat
No better look at Trump for that honor
No Trump is crippling our nation
I hope she's fishing.  It was obvious the constant trump saga of corruption was getting to her, as it is with most of us.  We can vent, but she has to remain professional, which she always is.  I think she just needed to detach, but I'm worried about her.
At the start of the year I would've said Trump, but after the whole pandemic debacle I can see Biden winning.
I don't think so, but he is hurting his nemesis Bezos by slowing down the mail. He's the reason trump refused to bailout the USPS. The test delays are due to so many companies starting up quickly and using fax machines instead of more expensive and quicker permanent technology.
Clinton's was a EULOGY. Obama's was a Trump Roast!
Would this work at your job or company?  Trump: I've done such a horrible job that you need to fire me, I understand. BUT, I've put the company in such a "hole". You should probably wait until you can afford to replace me!
I thought Clinton's was pretty damn good! Better actually...because it was about THE PERSON. Not Trump &amp; his politics! Seemed MORE "Campaign Speach" and a lot LESS "eulogy". Kinda disrespectful if you ask me.
After going to a Trump superspreader virus rally in Tulsa without a mask like an idiot.
You always put Trump first
I hope you‚Äôre joking, because otherwise you just said one of the dumbest things ever said. Still think Trump is a secret genius?

This is Trump‚Äôs legacy we see
If Trump doesn‚Äôt pay his bills, who is paying for the ‚Äúpretend‚Äù federal agents in Portland and other cities.
Cain was among the highest-profile public figures in the United States to have died from Covid-19. Less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis, Cain attended Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which had been staged despite concerns about mass gatherings during the
They about to blame Cain‚Äôs attendance to the Trump rally as the cause of his covid death. People are really sad.
Trump will treat him like a hero, praising him and lowering the flag.
Has trump lowered the flag, yet?
He drank the Trump Kool aid and died cause of it
What's the point of surrendering? When you are already surrounded and going to jail?!?  MAYBE he thinks there's a chance he can slip out the back, while they bust in and rush Trump!  Regardless. ALL of them know they're screwed!! Guilty by Association!!!
You can commit one at ANY AGE. As long as you have dirt on Trump!
At least Joe has a sense of humor however silly Donald Trump has no sense of humor and doesn‚Äôt really care about anyone
Beware of everything trump does between now and the election.There's a first time for everything!
One more reason to vote trump. Let‚Äôs get current daca kids their citizenship. Then lock down the border. Allow immigration the legal way. Protecting the people looking for the American dream.

Obama and Biden followed Bush and the second greatest recession of all time and they turned it around.  Trump has been riding Obama‚Äôs economy cost tails.  Now Trump has f.....Ed it all up
I love how trump wants to ban Tik Tok becuase China‚Äôs stealing information yet he wants Microsoft (patentned 3D facial recognition) to buy it and have a database full of our faces
Photos surface of Donald Trump with child traffickers and a porn actress that he paid hush money to.
Iran and Russia make sense here, but why wouldn't Xi want Trump in office? Trump has advanced China's interests better than any other POTUS. And didn't China give Trump election dirt on Biden last summer? etc
Trump still can‚Äôt say plasma correctly.
Interesting that CNN are taking this in full- they must have been briefed that Trump is going to say something important. #trumppressconference
1) You‚Äôre a few days too late on #BeirutBlast. 2) It‚Äôs NOT CALLED THAT!!! It‚Äôs the #coronavirus or #COVID__19 or #SARS_CoV_2 (if you‚Äôre not into the whole brevity thing). You are solely being the #RacistInChief. 3) How much are we paying for your trip to another  property?
Your feelings don't trump grammar rules.
I‚Äôm watching the docuseries Immigration Nation on Netflix and all I have to say is that whoever approved this to be filmed within the Trump Administration was dumb. It makes his administration and policies look even worse.
Really? With everything he's said and done since hitching his wagon to Trump, THIS is the first reason they've found to suspend him? There has to be something else going on that we're not privy to. And now, great, I'm a conspiracy theorist. Damn it!
If Trump is not defeated in November, start learning Russian... Therefore, work like hell to preserve our Democracy, flawed that it is.    Top U.S. intel official: China wants Trump defeated, Russia is sabotaging Biden
I don't see how some black and Jewish people don't get this. Racists tend to hate both of us. And if they do keep us around ahem, Stephen Miller and diamond and silk it is to justify how they aren't racist. Imagine disrespecting your ancestors for trump.
But he isn't. If it ok for Marc to support farrakhan then we have to be okay with white people supporting trump. There are no levels of racism. If you are a rando that hates Jews you are no better than the president who hates black people. Sure the president can do more damage.
But both are abhorrent are they not? You're right trump has more power and influence with his racism. But Farrakhan also comes from his own position of power, however insignificant it is compared to trump. And his racism must be equally unacceptable.
The Trump administration and the MAGA movement has dragged us to the gates of hell.
What does Ryan win if Trump actually goes on to make some childish comment in a presser about Haotong or the hat?

Tell everyone to vote again trump what ever you did last time, he is an embarrassing specimen to America and the world
But who put Donald Trump in power? The source lies with the disintegration of now dystopian republican politics.
Does trump have dementia?
Even the most left leaning polls say that Trump has 25% of the black vote. Biden is making the same mistake Clinton made 4 yrs ago. He's alienating voters faster than Trump is.
I just wondering is Trump displaying dementia behaviour?
We have a big voice to make:  - Biden who may be showing signs of mental decline  OR  - ‚ÄúThighland‚Äù Trump who has proven to be very very dumb   Not an easy choice.....
90% of the people watching this around the world are laughing and thinking is it really possible for anyone to not only be that mind-numbingly stupid to think that but to make a film of herself saying it. The other 10% vote for Trump.
If he can get to that 270 fuck what the ballots say. I'd love to throw that in trump's face.
So basically, Donald Trump wants to own the internet and have the say of what can and cannot be on it. #CleanNetwork
And the world of science which may be above the thought level of Trump and just maybe his supporters!
I think it‚Äôs a good idea for him to go give trump and Mikey a big wet juicy kiss !!
No one apart from Trump calls it Thighland.
If President Trump called in to Fake News MSNBC or CNN,would they refuse to put him on live?I would call them on every single lie on their airtime Mr. President!Sick of these liars lying every single day!Wish there was legislation that could force them to tell the truth!STOP Lies
Trump I‚Äôm will say anything to get back in, as we have seen , he can‚Äôt be trusted

We just need a medical term to we what‚Äôs happening to trump x
Well I guess supporting Trump a president who cannot read or pronounce words correctly, ‚Äúacing‚Äù his cognitive tests And astounding all the doctors with his cognitive capabilities, thinks Covid is going to magically disappear etc. is a better fit for this country?
I hope he will be forced to debate Trump. All his excuses sound stupid.

Another way to interpret Trump's response is that he believes Biden to have monumental power beyond the comprehension of mere mortals.

Susan Rice ideally but Kamala is my second choice. In an ideal world where I could pick just to piss off trump? Barack or Michelle.

Donald Trump is in plain sight. He still gets up in front of America every day &amp; tries to downplay the deadly pandemic and his poor leadership during it. He even went as far as to say ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù when asked about the 150,000+ U.S. deaths.   He has no answers &amp; never will.
This was laugh out loud funny.

interesting seeing as the Trump administration also sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, lied about it to Congress, then fired the Inspector General the day before he released the report on it.
Consider his fudging around electoral college(EC)/popular vote(PV) splits.  In 2000, the 13 points picked Gore, so it was supposed to be a PV model.  In 2016, it picked Trump, who lost the PV but won the EC, so now it's a model of who will win at least one of PV and EC.

The only revenge I care about is seeing Trump and his corrupt family of grifters face justice inside a courtroom for a lifelong crime spree, which includes crimes committed from the oval office.
As a friend of mine stated, Trump's dissonance between his lack of intelligence and high level of confidence in that Axios interview is unbelievable
Maybe you should try these classics:   ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter‚Äù ‚ÄùJesus would vote Trump‚Äù ‚ÄúThe God-Emperor Trump‚Äù ‚ÄúBeth Moore should go home‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Last Jedi was a great movie‚Äù or if those don‚Äôt work... ‚ÄúAngloid Lives Matter‚Äù
Even if Trump‚Äôs attack proclamation ends up to be true (even a broken clock tells the correct time twice a day) it‚Äôs completely irresponsible to refer to it as an attack without any confirmation. We all know his ‚Äúgreat‚Äù Generals had nothing to do with his statement. He‚Äôs a moron.
Trump bragging that he could correctly identify a picture of an elephant and a giraffe (as kindergartener could). But he sees the word Yosemite pop up on the teleprompter and it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs never seen the word before. This is a man who claims to be a genius by the way. LOL
I can't even imagine. People losing both parents. How do you survive that? And we are telling teachers to up their life insurance policies? Really? And I watched trump compare our testing to India? How the mighty have fallen.
When, and if, the Republican Party itself repudiates Donald Trump, let us know. Until then, you are simply engaging in empowering his enablers, and promoting their victories, and allowing for future Trumps.  Its absolutely breathtakingly dangerous. The GOP must end.
Election 2020: Trump vs. Biden on tax policy
I‚Äôm Catholic. I like competence. I also like a president who is not corrupt and chaotic. I‚Äôd like a President with empathy and morals...someone my 4 sons could look up to. In other words, NOT Trump! Love Thy Neighbor. #WWJD
Classic poor leader‚Äî rather than give praise to the people who really made a good thing happen, he takes the credit. But when things fail, he‚Äôs quick to pass on the blame to everyone but himself. What a miserable human being Trump is.
We have a President who doesn‚Äôt grasp the concept that every American city is HIS city. HE is ultimately accountable. Trump wants to just bucket cities like Portland that are struggling into the ‚ÄúTheir Cities‚Äù bucket rather than be accountable. He is not a leader.

Does Mr Trump have systemic brain disease?
The "it is what it is" line is obviously a misguided line for a president to take when describing viral fatalities in his own country, and Trump's assertion that the coronavirus is "under control as much as you can control it." I guess that means nothing more needs to be done.

Trump is an idiot!
Literally nothing about this is actually surprising. This is precisely why Trump is President. To carry out this specific agenda while demolishing the legitimacy of the US as hegemon. It has succeeded.   The question is not how simply how do we fix it. Its what do we do about it.
Trump is clearly deranged and cannot handle ANY criticism. He‚Äôs an idiot.
And yet, almost certainly the election of Trump will result in more death than Biden. You know this. Why deny reality?

If  is even half as good in the debates, Trump is toast
That‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt want Trump to praise real American hero‚Äôs. The press might say he‚Äôs got a ‚Äúnew tone‚Äù which will add to the myth that‚Äôs he‚Äôs an actual human being.
From our perspective, Trump is only POTUS because the DNC and Hillary took the middle class of the USA (last bastion of our value system as we know them) for granted. A box of brightly painted rocks could have beaten trump, who is a bully,  cheat, and a draft dodger. A reprobate.

No more $1T dollar stimulus bills. Legal protections 4 schools &amp; small biz that open &amp; incentives 2go back 2 work (payroll tax cut)! Helping ppl who lost jobs b/c govt shut them down deserve help but don‚Äôt bail out states w/insolvent pensions #twill
To the bigots who are so racist, they are willing to follow Donald Trump to Russia. Do you really believe if Vladimir Putin got control of this government, that he would allow you to keep your little farm wherever it is.
It doesn‚Äôt seem that any explanation is needed!  To quote Donald Trump, ‚Äúit is what it is!‚Äù
I think it important to say to you that while you guys are playing with that stimulus package. The Trump Administration is f****** over the post office
It‚Äôs extremely foolish and some sort of attempt to show everyone how tough they are or how trump loving they are. We all know it‚Äôs a poor decision and we wish they‚Äôd do better.
Vote 'em out anyway. The only one I could make an exception for is Mitt Romney. Every other republican supported Trump when it mattered most.
Huge like trump?
I hate these comparisons. People liken him to a mobster or Damien or whoever. Those people are evil and smart.   Trump's bumbling stupidity is what is so dangerous. He is literally Homer Simpson.

While on the contrary...Trump points out that many members are wearing masks and another news org points the camera to show just that. And all Kathryn does is to have the typical MSM knee jerk reaction of faux outrage
Yes it did. Donald Trump is a colossal failure!
Why are people even pretending like Trump's opposition to mail-in voting is real. Everybody knows the reason for that is that if everybody has the opportunity to vote, his ass is out and he knows it. Which is why he wants people to vote by mail where he approves

This epitomizes the GOP in the era of Trump. Trump, speaking of Biden, "He's against God. He's against guns." Only now would those two sentences be conjoined in this way.

I don‚Äôt see where he sows division. It‚Äôs the trump haters that do that in their hatred and intolerance and inability to accept an election
I‚Äôm fine with this move if Trump commits to it. TikTok is basically Chinese spyware
Is that what you tell the people who were raped by trump? "Have a blessed day" or the lgbtq community "have a blessed day" or the African Americans that are fighting for equality? Have a blessed day... Meaningless and useless
That would make all of us stupid, then. But that can't be right, because "when everybody's stupid, nobody's stupid*."  So, POUTS is lying again.   * Syndrome, "The Incredibles" (close enough)
Trump says if we test less, we would have less cases? Duh! Stupid statement Trump as usual. Suppose those people didn‚Äôt get tested, they would still be walking around positive &amp; just dONT know it! Non testing does  not make virus go away Trump!
Couldn't agree less.  Bernie Sanders fans allowed Trump to win the presidency with their protest votes and abdication of responsibility.  If they're foolish enough to be willing to let him stay there, it doesn't matter what Biden says or does.
Colorado Sec. of State Griswold rips apart POUTS's efforts to undermine vote-by-mail by illustrating how it allowed her state to increase turnout by 9% despite the #COVID19 epidemic.

It's better they are exposed &amp; out in the open than hiding under a rock. They're easier to spot &amp; deal with. Once Trump is defeated, most of them will crawl back under their rock &amp; you won't hear a peep out of them. People will know who they are &amp; they will live in shame forever.

Take a step back and think about this. Think of all the people in Trump's orbit who KNOW on a daily basis that he is a habitual liar and a con artist. Yet they still prop him up. Donald J Trump is a nothing but a complete puppet.

Thank goodness what Joe has going for him is Trump is no longer the UNKNOWN. He has showed us for 4 years he aint shit so easy peasy ..he had his chance and he sucked, hard! Bye bye Sucker!
Correction: We still can't obtain the *evidence* of why because of rampant obstruction of justice by the POUTS administration and Senate Republicans, but we certainly know why.  Judge Emmett Sullivan asked why prosecutors weren't charging Flynn w/ treason.
That is the saddest part. He was head of BLACKS FOR TRUMP and trump STILL didnt give any condolences. HOW do ANYBODY of color follow him? I understand why racists do but black anx brown people?? Why??!! He hates yall the most!! And so does his base.
Mary Trump wrote a book about POUTS's dysfunctional family &amp; toxic personality.  If Ms. McCain doesn't have facts to refute Ms. Trump's evidence, then this is just the usual hoax-mongering to deflect from the damning truth: POUTS is a malignant narcissist.

Trump, GOP soften on opposition to $600 jobless benefit
Trump said the results of the 2016 election were going to be fraudulent up and until he won. Again despite being only the 4th president in history to lose the popular vote. And 2nd republican in a row to do so... But trump lost by roughly 3 million vs bush losing by about 500k
Biden was not my first choice either. But the extreme left was not chosen in Biden as the extreme right was chosen with trump. The electoral college was setup to keep people like trump from becoming president. The framers of the Constitution foresaw this  type of situation.
And the "I know why" I was referring to is this: if trump declared 2+2=5 then every republican in this country would believe it
Yes because the people who are pieces of trash come up with absurd things like  "TDS". Wow you maga people are going to be lost after trump loses hard in November
I'm not mad. I want Clinton to go down if he did those things. I want anyone who did this to go down. Trump has plenty of other things like colluding with foreign governments to be imprisoned for treason. So I'm not worried about trump. You are going to pissed when he loses.
ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) - Trump says he'll act as soon as Saturday to ban Chinese-owned video app TikTok from US on security fears.

Trump is a fascist and silencing media is what fascist do.   If Trump could do it, CNN and MSNBC would be history too.
I would compare the fire to when Trump faced impeachment and was acquitted. The purpose of the fire was to coalesce blind allegiance. The GOP certainly provided that. The time from then to now would encompass the major facets of his blitzkriegs. G Floyd protests would be normandy
Have faith in the power of democracy. The powers of actual justice are coalescing. The citizens of this country are uniting in one common purpose. The shape takes more form everyday. From the actions of protesters in Portland to the folks  Trump is on his way out.
Trump threatens to do a lot of things, then finds out he's a feckless moron without the power. This is no different. A real President would know better. Not to mention he's just being petty because of the Tulsa rally. He's like a 6 year old.

Yet Trump followers avtually think he has accomplished something and it was BARACK who did nothing smh. How can they live in the same damn country? How?!
You missed your chance to fix this problem when you acquitted Trump for extortion, bribery and obstruction of justice, although the evidence that he had committed those crimes was overwhelming and Republicans admitted it.  You own those farmers' problems.
Who cares whether POUTS's claim that "96%of Republicans approve of his job performance" is true or not? It doesn't matter; we didn't hire him to be the President of the United Republican Party.
Not to trump.
This implies that people in this country are suddenly going to start acting like responsible adults when Trump is ousted, and I'm willing to put money on the exact opposite.

Every time Trump gets trapped on a question he asks for a graph, then stares at it. Obvious, it's the first time he's seen the graph and has no idea what it represents.
If responding to the pandemic is not Trump's responsibility why does he keep saying what a great job he is doing? FYI: Obama's playbook was created on lessons learned from H1N1. Trump chose to ignore it and now there are 156K CV19 deaths.
How do you guys let Trump out free? His Coronavirus is full of LIES &amp; FAIRYTALES!! Thank you very much, cause Trump proves what a DOPE HE IS and it‚Äôs funny!!
Biggest implosion of the GDP on record could only be accomplished by Trump.
It's a national crisis and Trump should have shown some leadership. He was the first to criticize Obama over H1N1
Hundreds of millions spent hunting the child pedo rings down. And stifling the child trafficking coming across the southern border. It's absolutely an accomplishment for Trump. Stop being a hater.
Trump won‚Äôt show
. announced four executive orders aimed at reducing patient and consumer spending on outpatient drugs, but our policy expert  says the orders face ‚Äúlong odds‚Äù of actually being enforced.
Trump lied about the virus. It wasn‚Äôt a hoax.
Trump is just racist and stupid. We must vote him out  it‚Äôs imperativeNow, to make this week perfect, we just need someone to release Trump‚Äôs pee tape
Show him a picture of Trump and tell him this is what happens if he doesn‚Äôt get a haircut
The day before the 2016 election I was with a group of friends and Hilary came on TV - one of them said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anyone who is voting for her‚Äù and were shocked when I told them I was and honestly interested when I explained why. Not why I hate Trump but why I liked her.
Yes, yes, yes THIS!! The assumption by the left that Trump people are all informed and still choose him is so UNinformed. I am surrounded by ignorant people who are otherwise wonderful people. They hear that Dems are demonic from everyone they know and do not know any different.
More lies from KKKing Twitters Administration. No one believes a word you say. You lie almost as much as Trump this days.
(Pt. 3) "uncounted mail in ballots" to keep people think they're working out the election, while Pelosi and schuemer take the presidency for a term, Soros gets his brown shirts to back off publicly, creating a 1984 government-state, showing that aunt Nancy is better than trump
I can‚Äôt wait for you to throw a fit in November when your buddy Biden doesn‚Äôt win, just like Hilary was ‚Äúleading the polls‚Äù how that end up for you, better just get use to it the trump train will be chugging for 4 more years bud
Who will you be voting for, Joe??   ‚ÄúWe can only re-elect President Trump!‚Äù- Joe Biden.
And trump is for a border wall, pro capital punishment, against environmental protections, against universal healthcare, etc. which are contrary to the #CatholicChurch
There is a chance of that cus it‚Äôs being reported across the country so Chris Wallace you are biased cus that is more a fact than him afraid of Biden cus in a fair election with VOTER ID AN NO MAIL IN BALLOTS this will landslide to Trump again but you protect the left! Yep
Chris you say your not for one or the other but what you said about Trump being afraid wants more debates He wants more debates to open the eyes of America and get all 330million. For you to openly say He‚Äôs scared cus of Biden. Nope but there is a very good chance
I heard an indirect theory on the election, its not trump vs biden, its trump vs pelosi, because if there's no clear winner by Jan 20, Pelosi assumes the presidency until there is a winner, so if every couple days a new batch of ballots is found, we end up with president pelosi
as a strong supporter of yours I ask that you seriously consider not entering into any ‚Äúdebate‚Äú with Mr. Trump. Something he is very good at , is making a fool of other people. And he doesn‚Äôt play by the rules. You do not need to debate him. There‚Äôs no upside
Like you I‚Äôve voted R since 1984. Reagan got $2500 from me in 80 when I was 15. No more. Character, integrity matter. I trained 23 years with the allies Trump has ditched. No more.
you two idiots are crazy.  You probably love trump too.  Two Thugs.
President Trump is railing against a growing desire by some to have universal mail-in ballots for people who want to avoid going to the polls during the pandemic.
NEW Trump 2020 Campaign Ad!  via
With as much is being made of the Mail In Ballots already I guarantee that this is how the left will steal the election. Why can‚Äôt Trump do an EO no mail in ballots. It‚Äôs not a fair an secure process!
You are such a liar!  I wonder who tells more lies, you or Trump? Either way, you‚Äôre both on your way out! #TheRepugnantOnes #FakeFraudFailure45
Trump also promised to uphold the Constitution. He's failed miserably on both counts.  Unemployment skyrockets, GDP plummets, and American citizens tear-gassed. Meanwhile, the spineless GOP races for a front-row seat to this Shitshow.
Find a man that looks at you the way Pence is looking at Trump.... *shudder*
These are the far right, Quanon, would-be Trump supporters of Germany.  There are far fewer of them in Germany since ww2 did a good job of wiping out most fascist.
My Reaction to Donald Trump banning TikTok
Ask Trump
Dementia*. And yes. At this point I‚Äôd rather vote for   than Trump, of which I most certainly will not be doing. #Biden46
Bet he calls for a bs review on the ballots after Biden wins. Yes let‚Äôs investigate the meaning of why I LOST, but the reason I won 2016? Russian Propaganda? Lets just forget about it bc im a narcissist who likes to grab em by the pussy and can‚Äôt accept my losses; right Trump? :)
if trump wins again...well...time to renew my passport and say hi to trudeau as long as he doesn‚Äôt Berlin Wall our asses.
That's because there are few people I hate more than Trump. I'm not afraid to admit that. I find him to be a horrible person, and an even worse leader. Like I said, it's not about party here. I've never felt this way about another President, but I find Trump vile
2/2 that era never owned slaves, so again, hard for me to respect someone who dealt in human flesh. Trump however, is like no president before him, even Nixon. Any man who would  talk of dating his own daughter, even jokingly, does not deserve anyone's respect.For all of Trump‚Äôs bluster on Medicare and telephone appointments, my extreme high risk husband was given no choice because it wasn‚Äôt allowed as it had been before. This was the next day after his presser. What EO ‚Äúforget you‚Äù is he planning this time on pre existing conditions?
Joe, I‚Äôve been to the Grand Canyon.  It‚Äôs hard to believe I‚Äôd even notice uranium mining there. It‚Äôs BIG.  Our energy needs trump most photo-ops.  A little bit of uranium will save a lot of birds from being chopped up by wind turbines.  You like birds, right?
Really? What‚Äôs his agenda?  After closing borders, ramping up testing, using the Defense Production Action and starting a massive vaccine initiative, do you think Trump‚Äôs goal is to kill Americans?
The Antifa thugs made a mess of Portland way before Trump‚Äôs agents showed up.   Frankly, you‚Äôre lying.
What if Trump chose Kanye as his veep?  The Trumps and the Kardashians in the White House.
Maybe you haven't been paying attention but Trump is not a fan of China.... But keep on telling people he's going to be okay with vechain
IDGAF if we‚Äôre getting close to Election Day, impeach Trump again. And prosecute the assholes at the EPA.
The ads targeting Florida senior citizens whom do NOT benefit from a payroll tax cut are literally being written right now. Trump is cutting Social Security.
When is that big trip to throw a pitch for the Yankees, oh right djt made that up. Trump has been slurring, mispronouncing and mangling words for months. Now he is dragging his leg. But beyond all that, he is a mean, petty man that perpetually lies.
Awww, the poor little white dudes are terrified by the ladies. Boohoo.   It‚Äôs bullshit like this that helped Trump win the election.
#FakeChristianTrump Other than a rare photo-op appearance by a Bible, absolutely nothing. He uses the Bible like all of his other cons. Of course not all that alleged Christians are either. Trump is a little boy pretending he knows how to be a man.
remember when Trump* called that guy ‚Äúmy black guy‚Äù :-/
Did you know Trump* repeatedly cheated on his wives and had unprotected sex with an adult film star. Clearly poor judgment.
AS if the Trump campaign even knows what ''Fair and Square" means.
Trump* sure does act the victim a whole lot. Lots of tears.
Nazis are some good people - Trump*
Where would we be if Washington hadn‚Äôt liberated those airports? We should ask Trump*?
Your question is stupid. Do you like Trump* because your pecker is as small as his or just because you like small peckers?
I think bragging about walking in on underage models undressing is nasty, dispicable and something Trump* does.
Check this out... "He said, 'Well, I'm only doing what my boss told me to do ‚Äî I am not allowed to rent to black tenants,' " Guess who the boss was? Trump!
I‚Äôm not sure Trump* was done grabbing women by the pussy without permission by that point, though....
Why do the nazis support Trump*?
Episode 1076 Scott Adams: Trump is Medically Correct and CNN Might Be Killing Tens-of-Thousands
Well, I guess Trump's balls aren't gonna lick themselves. Good job, Denise.
Playing ghoul to Trump's succubus.
Trump has respected the law and the Constitution far more than Queen Pelosi has.  It was Obama who started spying on Trump and led the way to transform it into an attempted coup.  Trump has no interest in unending power.  Democrats always do.
so tiktok is a national emergency but the pandemic isnt? ok trump ‚ù§Ô∏è priorities ‚ú®
China can call out all the racism they want, but we know they will mostly lie for political effect.  While they‚Äôre giving Democrats a boner, Trump will crush them diplomatically and economically.  And we will point out their own sins against Uyghurs and others!
Cold war, man, cold war.  We‚Äôve played that game before; we know how to play it and with Trump in the lead we can play it better than ever.  We can bring China to heel with few shots being fired. Time for another round of M.A.D.
Still waiting to find out what Trump said to Justice Kennedy that made him stop in his tracks.
Trump is a little boy pretending he knows how to be a man. Sad really.
Trump will never be a man, always a boy pretending  to be a man.
We need a freezing cold war with China.  Trump already tried being nice on trade but China would have none of it.  If they want ‚Äòwar‚Äô, let‚Äôs give them ‚Äòwar‚Äô and play to win!  Diplomacy won‚Äôt work since China is committed to its own supremacy.  Fine, crush them.
In my 41 years of existence, I have never heard a single English speaker say "Thighland" other than Trump, who is b a r e l y an English speaker.
Trump vs Biden Twitter war.
I truly wish that  trump would be silenced everywhere. His pictured blotted out on everything except a "wanted" poster. If I never hear his voice again I would be a happy man.
West said ‚¨á   ‚ùå slavery was a choice &amp; Harriet Tubman didn't help slaves  ‚ùå he wears a MAGA hat and Confederate flag  ‚ùå he has a mental illness which seems to be inconsistently treated  These factors appeal more to Trump's base than Biden's
Well Epstein is obviously dead, so he‚Äôs not anymore. Unfortunately can‚Äôt say the same for Trump.
But then she leaves the guy for Danny! So does that mean you‚Äôre gonna vote for Trump?
Donald J Trump is not a man, real men don't: Grab women by the pussy Cheat on their wife Ridicule disabled Americans Bully everyone Wear orange makeup Lie Cheat Steal Lust after their daughters Hate and fear women Kill the ozone with hairspray
Oh no! You mean Conway draws a Not-for-profit salary!? Oh no! The amount of money he must be earning definitely dwarfs his four years of attacking Trump, advocating for his impeachment and launching a campaign that damages Trump before the election.
Are you so blinded by your hate of Trump that you can't even recognize an organization that is actively trying to defeat him?
Please. George Conway has been publicly criticizing Trump since he took office. He is a major force in the #NeverTrump movement within the GOP and the Lincoln Project ads cannot be taken as anything other than outright attacks on the President
Trump was literally sued for racial decriminalization over his Trump apartments.  Biden has received multiple civil rights awards and recognitions.
Trump is a constant danger to the american people.
Trump. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Another million pissed away by Donnie playing a game he has to cheat to make par, no doubt with a republican lackey in tow, but the GOP still can‚Äôt agree on the $200.  Have they taken even $1 out of the $5 Billion of GOP and Trump pork off the table yet?
In case racism and fascism wasn't enough for you to vote out Trump in 2020.  Will be interesting to see what happens as a result of this mess.   Gotta love people writing laws about technology that have no idea how technology functions.  Also something, something free markets.
*trump googling what inting means*
Why do all the openly white nationalists support Donald Trump*? I think we all know.
Do yourself, your constituents and your legacy a favor and uncouple yourself from Trump.
American voters deserve the truth about your tax returns  ! Jerk!
Trump and Kanye; Proof that money can't buy you good mental health.
I abhor Trump, and I hate to admit this, but Thighland sounds wonderful.
Lady......how you think you got Trump????
I do not want Biden I don‚Äôt want trump. Shit fucking sucks and I don‚Äôt think either can make it 4 years into a presidency. Just focus on your local elections people.
You all realize that if we mobilize, vote in hoards and get Dem control of all 3 branches, they do not take power until January of 2021. THEN we can have a true mask order, and shut down (after 3-500K Trump deaths) &amp; we'll still be AN ENTIRE YEAR behind the rest of the world.
As a white male American  &amp; Donald Trump are not only embarrassing; they‚Äôre also criminals and racial bigots!!! This is the USA not 1930‚Äôs Germany.  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #IamAnEmbarrasedWhiteAmerican #Biden #AmericansAreOne

Trump is much better at tossing out red meat than he was at selling steaks.  As ridiculous as this statement sounds ‚Äî and as wrong as it is ‚Äî his base believes it, eats it up, and regurgitates it.
You understand that Israelis love Trump? And that‚Äôs bad
But that‚Äôs not what Trump said. He said they‚Äôre immune, which is provably false.
Stunning that the NRA‚Äôs charity status could go POOF!  It has been run as a business as long as I have known about it.  I would hope they do the same that they did with the Trump ‚Äùcharity‚Äú/slush fund and ban these schmucks from any other charity ever.
Absolutely not he is to weak and don‚Äôt  trust her she jumped ship when she was told they had plans to take Trump down will never vote for either one
I try not to think of Trump getting justice for his crimes. The multitude of them is astounding. Yet, he always ends up getting away with it.  I pray they find something that sticks.
Really? I don‚Äôt watch tv. Seems fake.  Do you think all the pedos are worried Trump will be re-elected?  Justice just handed out $35m housing grants for victims of #HumanTrafficking. That‚Äôs a lot of victims.   Btw, What ever happened to those 90,000 kids Obama had at the border?
Almost 160,000 Americans are dead from the Trump Plague. We are closing in on 5 millions infected by the Trump Plague. Where is the National rapid testing program you promised in April? Everyone needs to be tested do that we can suppress this virus until there is a vaccine.
This what you choose to do with your lives. Lmao
The GOP thinks that sowing doubt in #MailInVoting will keep enough #liberals home to allow #Trump an #EC win.  They don't realize that we would fight through a Chainsmoker's concert to vote that human waste out.   They will only succeed in depressing conservative turnout.
What‚Äôs your PhD in? Stupidity? Must have ‚Äúearned‚Äù your degree from Trump University. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

Trump wants to use the White House as his personal property, as if he‚Äôs a potentate. He cherry picks states that he ‚Äúapproves‚Äù for Mail-in voting, w/partisan  LIES about Republicans included. I‚Äôm worried about our future, we need him gone. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #Biden2020 üá∫üá∏

Trump is banned until he removed post.
Facebook, Twitter penalize Trump for posts containing coronavirus misinformation
Schumer doesn‚Äôt seem to notice that the states are doing a bang-up job of COVID testing.  Chuck, have you heard of federalism? Trump loves it!  Democrats are fine with states‚Äô rights ‚Äî 10th Amendment ‚Äî until they want an all-powerful government ordering states around.
I don't care about your political views, but what the Trump administration is doing with the Census is absolutely sickening and is borderline dangerous. This is not something that we can just do next year, you'll have to wait until 2030 to fix it.
President Trump holds a COVID-19 press breifing:
. lost the federal testing equipment it was expecting because of a Trump administration initiative to bolster #COVID19 testing at nursing homes, an  spokesperson said today.  #ilstu #BloNo #twill
Trump and his administration coming out guns blazing! This is amazing! Time too finish these treasonous bastards off. GITMO Is ready!! Trump 2020 LANDSLIDE. #Qanon #WWG1WWGA #GodWins
I think he was more Trump with people around him to tell him not to say certain things in public.
Non story:  Mitt Romney knows his honest opinion is 100% irrelevant. The  and Trump arent going to change it. Move on to more important issues.
Are these test hits getting ready to bomb USA just asking Pelosi did say Trump would be gone before election
So Biden called black reporter a junky because he dared to ask about his mental state and also says he wasn‚Äôt texted but in previous state said he was and was tested all the time which is it and could you imagine if Trump called a black reporter a junky which he would never do
Hillary accusingly Trump of working with post office to steal election in 2020 actually what she did do in 2016
Hillary‚Äôs COVID response, if she had been elected, would have been catastrophic.  President Trump has kept the economy as open as possible, closed travel, and urged us to open up again and return to school.  That‚Äôs great.  #BacktoWorkAmerica  #BackToSchoolAmerica #MAGA2020
Idiots who say shit like this have never listened to a complete Trump speech ever. Joe Rogan is the Jim Jordan of Joe Bucks
I had several: Mrs. Weller - Language Arts (yes) Mrs. Dodson - Literature (I‚Äôve come to appreciate her over the years) Mr. Peck - Math Mr. Azbell - Science (RIP) Mr. Jacoby - History (RIP) Mr. Trump - Health (RIP)
Ok for the billionth time this week:  Trump's approval on any issue will NEVER dip below 30%  Blame his fantastical base.
5 trillion deficit, 27 Trillion National Debt, 170 Deaths from TrumpVirus, Largest GDP loss in History.....Please No More Trump Style Winning.
But if Trump refused one would be no issue at all though i'm sure.
gives exactly ZERO f***s about what Donald Trump thinks, and neither should anyone else.
If Trump loses, it is Trump‚Äôs fault.  His ego won‚Äôt allow him to stick to the script.  #ReadTheManuals
Omg. I was nervously googling this guy a few days ago. I remembered his summer time NPR interview in 2016 when he predicted Trump.

Yo-Semite! We should drug test Trump*!
Puerto Rico tried to close the airports in March and last month FAA said no both times. Does GOP/trump have influence with the FAA?
As true as this is, we couldn't have Trump without Nixon and Reagan.  They laid the foundation for Trumps bullshit.  only cares about power and money.
Lmfao, are you fucking serious?  How about this. Trump is a pathetic fucking rube.
I have a 4th and 2nd grader. Both are intelligent, compassionate and highly educated.  Trump has none of those qualities. Choose a different comparison. üòä
We‚Äôre never getting out of this with Trump at the wheel.
Hearing Trump ramble my first thought is always "how could anyone vote for this idiot"  As I think about it more though I realize his rambling incoherent references to "people say" is exactly how conservatives always engaged when I was growing up.
Trump* bragging about walking in on underage models getting dressed.  I‚Äôm sorry, What were you saying?
, Trump* said stern could call his own daughter ‚Äúa piece of ass‚Äù, and has cheated on every wife. Oh yeah, there are over 25 accusations about sexual harassment... and he once was caught on a hot mic bragging about sexually assaulting someone. Idk if this is a good lane for ya.
Herman Cain died because Trump* lied.
I don‚Äôt think it matters.  Trump won‚Äôt go even if asked.  It won‚Äôt be guilt like a normal person.  Fear of death and funerals, fear of being directly blamed by loved ones and his racism will keep him away.

Betsy DeVos NEVER has done the right thing and she never will.  She has an agenda that is about hurting students as destroying public education for the profit of herself, her family and her personal religious dogma.  She needs to go with Trump.

This mask parody was getting a lot of play yesterday.  She nails the virtue-signaling hollow bs of the whole situation.  There‚Äôs a report that suburb playgrounds are filled with non-mask families. Signal of Trump voters, calling bs on #MaskHoax
This deal reeks of Trump. Follow the money.
Is this tweet from 2017? 2018? 2019? How long you gonna publish the same article?  Senate Republicans played you for 6 years before Trump.  Their only plan is for poor people to die without care.  Just like this damn pandemic.
I wish it would be over in 92 days.  We have to endure this until inauguration.  The days in between are going to make this look like the good old days.  No one has even accused Trump of not being vengeful.  He will make America pay and pay BIG.
Americans deserve to Trump‚Äôs tax returns.
I‚Äôve found myself relieved with the rift in #YangGang Twitter this week. I was overjoyed to be on the same page, at least about a candidate, with Trump-to-Yang folks. But I never came close to feeling true solidarity with them. It all struck me as bizarre. nice...but bizarre.
President Trump holds a press confrence:

Heartbreaking all to hurt Trump brainless Democrats

Trump says Antifa is a terrorist group why hasn‚Äôt anything been done anything about it
Both Republicans and Democrats want to send Americans a second round of $1,200 stimulus checks as part of the next coronavirus aid package. A new report suggests the Trump administration is considering unilateral action to get relief to Americans.
If Kamala Harris ends up as VP that might be the one thing that can save Trump after Covid. It's the biggest way the dems can burn all their goodwill, naming Californias top cop as Bidens running mate
I‚Äôm comparing it to the ‚Äúsoon to be 0‚Äù Trump* promised in Feb, though :-/
With Trump, you get both.
Trump is over 20,000 Documented Lies as President.
Our governor was proactive and we were stayed at 1% for a long time.  Then trump had her open the island. Now we are at 12% even though everyone wears a mask. It's bad
I don‚Äôt think that they‚Äôll retry it anyway. But Trump is right, that pos deserves the needle.

Did I just spend 45 minutes sending the entire script of the Bee Movie to donald trump over Instagram dms??????? Yes.
But trump passed all of those immigration policies restricting legal immigrants. How is he pro immigration?
And I have a genuine question, why do you support trump? What has he done. Im asking because I just dont see it and its clear you have a different perspective
And since there was a whistle blower who said that trump knew about it he must‚Äôve seen/heard of the report
Well that usually is a clue about what Trump plans to do next...
It is August 2, 2020, 4:49 pm CST and still no promised healthcare plan from Trump  Simply shocking ain‚Äôt it.
This woman really was wearing a Trump 2020 mask... and was wearing it wrong. I laughed in her face and I wish her nothing but the worst.

SpaceX Dragon just splashed down and I'm trying to care about it but I just can't push covid19, Trump's unbelievable and down right callous responding to this pandemic and his political "All for me and none for you" platform out of my mind.

The GOP has been radicalizing since the 60‚Äôs &amp; that kicked into high gear with Gingrich. The remaining ‚Äúmoderates‚Äù vote with Trump 90%+ of the time. They are not the party of conservatives, they are the party of autocrats &amp; fascists. Burn it down &amp; rebuild.
It's being run by a Republican Trump cultist who literally makes his money from destroying the USPS. He has no interest in saving it. His business empire depends on it ending.
Congratulations to the Trump Administration for getting what they deserve. And kudos to all of the MAGAe foreign policy ‚Äúexperts‚Äù who were stoked that we stopped letting Iran get away with everything. Idiots.
Still no opion on the latest epstein info. For someone who likes to call out trump on tiktok you'd think Clinton on epstein Island would be tweet worthy.
Nice. Glad to see swing states in play!!  What would the electoral college look like if vote was today and trump won the state‚Äôs he‚Äôs leading?  Thanks
Make Trump go away again!
They literally bitched about every thing he ever did. The amount of scrutiny Trump receive IS about 1/100th of what Obama received.
I‚Äôm *really* looking forward to the teary-eyed Paul Ryan interview where he‚Äôll choke up about ‚Äúhow *hard* I tried‚Äù to keep Trump in check. Screw him and EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN who aided and abetted this catastrophe. Fires and purges are the LEAST they deserve.

This is about Medicare &amp; Medicaid too. They want to defund everything that people of Trump &amp; McConnell‚Äòs age group that depend on to live on, use for healthcare. It is bad enough what happened to those that got covid in nursing homes. Why does the GOP hate healthcare so much?
Right after the election you think that‚Äôs by chance and you know for sure will extend it when Trump wins that‚Äôs how stupid they think we are

Yes, continue to shed Anerican lives, jobs, and GDP. Stay the course until the airplane is good and  cratered so nobody walks away. Putin demands the end of the USA, so vote Trump!
Joe has no reason to debate the Russian mobster idiot Trump. I'd prefer he not debase himself by getting on stage with that thing.
Wasn't Trump supposed to be on Smackdwon
There appears to be only one way now to stop Trump. Check out this cartoon  via

Ever watch SpongeBob? Every time the hero screams out EEEEEVVVVIIIILLLLL, thats what I hear every damned time I see Trump. Every. Damned. Time.
Ever watch SpongeBob? Every time the hero screams out EEEEEVVVVIIIILLLLL, thats what I hear every damned time I see Trump. Every. Damned. Time.
I hope he doesn‚Äôt refuse. That‚Äôs another chance to watch Trump‚Äôs idiocy.
Do you all think Trump reads our tweets?

It is not a top priority for Republicans. It is a top priority for Trump is the only way he thinks he can stay in office
A Trump.  " When the plane had its wings fall off at 20,000 feet, it Trumped, killing everyone on board"
Is Joe Biden obligated to debate Donald Trump?  The purpose of debate is to learn where the candidate stands on issues.  After the Clinton/Trump debates I don't wish to see Mr. T. photo bomb and stalk his opponent again. It was just plain creepy!
Trump is expected to ban #TikTok today even as Microsoft floats the idea of buying the $50 billion app
trump supporters been real quiet tonight-
Trump thinks shutting down tik tok is gonna solve anything. Like 90% of the people on there are under 18. Calm down
Nope. This has nothing to do with trump. India, UK, USA and Australia have all banned or are considering banning Tik Tok. If you don‚Äôt think China is a threat then read up on Hong Kong and Muslims being put in concentration camps in China.
This isn‚Äôt Trump trying to control the media. It‚Äôs bi partisan.
Your daily reminder that  is a piece of shit.   He's enabled Trump from day on.  FUCK HIM
not trump trying to ban tik tok before he even figures out how to pay americans now that they‚Äôre losing unemployment ‚ô•Ô∏è
fuck trump is he really that fucking bitter about us ruining his rallies tiktok is something that I actually care about but I guess I cant have anything? ik he and his vp hate me for who I am but seriously? cant i have one thing? could you at least ban conversion therapy first?
Did you see that you TikTok is being banned. Donald trump just pulled a because I can on TikTok.
Trump only gives a damn about two amendments, the 2nd for his followers and the 5th for himself, his family and co-conspirators.
Absolutely. Better that Trump &amp; Pence destroy institutions and pass fascist legislation.
Small turn put?  Sounds like your referring to a Trump &amp; Epstein man child orgy.
I live here trust me trump has influence. Our governor is Trump's. Puppet. We were doing well  1% until he told her to open the island now we are at 12% CORVID while simultaneously battling earthquakes, hurricanes &amp; blackouts
No One: Not a Fucking Person Asked: trump: I will not be throwing out the first pitch at the Yankees game because I too busy pretending to give a fuck while playing golf! #NotMyPresident
Because Mitch McConnell doesn‚Äôt care about the pain of Americans. He cares about the 5 billion dollars of GOP pork &amp; Trump wants toward his own pocket that had absolutely nothing to do with shelter, food or other essentials in this crisis that that he and Don didn‚Äôt get approved.
Real talk if it looks like Trump stays in office for another 4 years what will you do?
I love it when I make fun of anti-maskers or Trump cultists I get weird attempts to log into my Twitter account.  Dicks.
#twill   Trump‚Äôs DOJ cleaning up where #Democrats have somehow never been able too.  This is going to hurt Cartel Caah Flow üòÇ
Trump was 58 years old, eligible to vote since Nixon was President, in a car with the nephew of George Herbert Walker Bush who should also know how voting works and Donnie had no idea how cast an in person ballot.  Had he ever voted before at all polling station or not?
How does anyone take Trump seriously when he tweets nonsense like this?
If you pay attention it actually does absolve him, which is the proper word, absolve. No need for him to be exonerated, specific word that one. At this period of time Trump was too busy grabbing adult women by the... well you know. Known facts.
In the past I have questioned some of  Watergate statements. But just as he has put aside Nixon and Watergate, today I put aside Watergate and thank him for this well done piece.    Trump Has Been Comparing Himself to Nixon. That‚Äôs Hooey.
If you think the push of force against Trump during this cycle was something, wait until he wins 2020. News will say this is evidence of racism in America. BLM will disappear again, like in 2017-2019, leaving angry black men and women behind. This is a coup. A continuous one.
Right. I mean it would be great if we could simply sit down and map out rational courses of action rather than pander to either side really Trump won because he genuinely loves America, even if he doesn't win awards for "shiny clean sinless soul". The left doesn't understand that
"We've already had complaints where they're being sent to people who are dead. They're being sent to dogs," Pres. Trump said about universal mail-in voting.
DUH???  What planet is Trump on?  Does Biden know where he is?  Someone please stop this LEFT/RIGHT MADNESS!!!
Wow - this headline and this article:
Kushner is a small and vile creature. Are we sure that he wasn‚Äôt born a Trump?
Trump‚Äôs tweet puts the spotlight on Dems and their new fetish for mail-in ballots.   What chaos will they cause?  Will the counts on Nov 3 be reliable or will we be counting mail-ins for weeks?The investigation only suggests 1 occasion where Trump may have obstructed justice before the was president. It has a few from after he was president, but they couldn't have influenced the election for, I hope, obvious reasons.  If there was anything concrete he'd be gone by now.
Acosta is one of the most clueless tone deaf DNC propagandist in all of media. He keeps proving Trump is dead on correct on MSM
‚ÄòNew‚Äô is that the Trump campaign was contacted and they took the meeting and did not bother to inform FBI. I understand the collusion is not proven. Its possible that they really did not collude in legal sense, but more likely it could not be proven because inv was obstructed. /1

Why can‚Äôt the governor of New Jersey shut this trump business down for non compliance with local public health law‚Äôs ! I don‚Äôt understand they are putting kids in danger and senior adults not to mention reporters ! No minorities that I can come up from the pictures ! just!
Why can‚Äôt the governor of New Jersey shut this trump business down for non compliance! I don‚Äôt understand they are putting kids in danger and adults not to mention reporters ! No minorities that I can come up wi th from the pictures !
Trump is in court trying to kill affordable care and pressure existing conditions. This executive order comment is complete BS.
Trump is a serious threat to Americans.
Im sure the ‚Äúinstitution‚Äôs‚Äù executive committee will also not be voting for Trump too since they are so offended by both their behaviors
I wonder how much of that executive committee will still he voting for Trump
Tucker  Carlson sounds like he is voting for Kanye West. Not Donny Trump. I bet Don is going to be pissed.
Does Trump know the Trump-Pence campaign just admitted the public has been confused about what his administration wants us to do the stop this virus from killing people?
Yeah and trump demeans them.
Trump is going to give tons of money to Beirut, a terrorist hotbed, but blocking relief money for Americans out of work.
Trump USA üá∫üá∏ Biden no way
While this is a step in the right direction, Facebook and other social media companies like Twitter and Youtube need to take greater responsibility for the spread of misinformation on their platforms.
Stay out of it trump. You‚Äôll only screw it up.
Where are the republican leaders from the congress? Vote them out of Congress along with Trump.
He‚Äôs retaliating because the Canadian government is cracking down on Americans defying their coronavirus laws. Trump pulled troops out of Germany for duets he bank following subpoena on trump
trump and his followers.
Dream on trump
That‚Äôs not the way to get more votes trump. At least he doesn‚Äôt lie like you. Where‚Äôs the medical insurance thing you promised in a couple weeks that‚Äôs past due?
Trump is allowing thousands of black people to be killed by his police forces and has a bunch of POC trapped in cages rn. Obama wasnt perfect, but Trump is terrifying
Draft dodging coward Trump should never comment on our heroes. It‚Äôs insulting.
Why would Trump do that when he did the same thing personally against Obama.
If anyone embodies pure idiocy it‚Äôs Trump. In fact, if you look up use idiocy in the dictionary a photo of Trump pops up.
Trump has a lot of nerve after he said thigh land and yo Semite.
God help us all if Trump gets reelected on November third.
No because Chuck Todd will ensure that the public knows ‚ÄúPelosi doesn‚Äôt want to kick people out of their house‚Äù and the lawsuit is really about ‚ÄúTrump and his cronies trying to kill people‚Äù by not spending $3,000,000,000,000 we don‚Äôt have.
It‚Äôs focused on getting trump re-elected #boycottKimandKanye
Shame on you and Kanye for your support of racism, violence, and Donald Trump
And he's ahead of Trump, too.
If Trump doesnt do it who will.
Trump is trying to steal our democracy every day. November can't come soon enough for me.
Trump is not worthy of anyone‚Äôs vote. Black, white, yellow or red. We all need to vote out Trump.
trump cares about the election so much he's willing to help kanye get on ballots in states where he think he might lose. so gracious.
People are brainwashed to think nothing can be worse than trump. Even if trump is as bad as some people think, Biden is inherently worse.
Trump continues to flout social distancing guidelines even as he urges others to follow them  He has that luxury since everyone is tested before getting close to him. Example; Gov of Ohio. Tested positive, so couldn't meet him as normal during a visit.
I fully support the republicans pulling back on giving money to the states and cities. Americans should not bail out democratic run states and cities who failed on funding their pension system. They give into unions for votes and now want is to bail them out. Hold firm Trump!
Trump will make Pelosi look stupid. She is playing politics with the stimulus package. Worst speaker of the house in my lifetime
Well, when you have people like this making Donald Trump out to be immortal, we are screwed as a society.
I know all about the past, believe me. But what‚Äôs diff now is that he is rectifying those mistakes by having comprehensive plans for POC. Trump, on the other hand, has a history of overt racism that is carried into his presidency, with no evidence that it will change.
If Trump did pray, in his mind, would he not be talking to himself?
Joe Biden says if you vote for trump you ain't black. Joe also says if your white you are racist? Hes white therefore racist. Also blacks are not diverse compared to latinos.
deserves prison for life.  #TrumpHoaxedAmerica 160,000 deaths as trump mismanages pandemic to steal another election. Murderer. #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory #25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #WeStillShootTraitorsDontWe?
Amen . President Trump isn‚Äôt perfect but he‚Äôs trying to save America. God willing he will get ready-elected . The left will try and steal the White House
There is no way Trump will lose, the democrats having given Trump supporters the will to make sure that happens, thank you!
You have always been for tRump. That is why I try my best to not watch you
Not sure what coulution is. If you mean collusion, yes, there are many examples. Every time Trump says there isn‚Äôt you know there must be.

The cult of Trump
All you depraved left wing idiotos were scared to death about Trump having the nuclear codes what about this fool C'mon Mannn ü§£
Alright now let‚Äôs talk about the accomplishments. He got us out one of the biggest recessions. He passed the Affordable Care Act which gave millions health care. He passed the Wall Street reform. Ended the Iraq war. We had a great economy which Trump took over.
This is the price we pay for the electoral college electing Trump.
We were talking about Trump but sure let‚Äôs bring up Biden since y‚Äôall know Trump is awful. No the 1994 bill was awful and unlike Trump supporters we accept what Biden has done wrong. Want to talk about the Obama administration and it‚Äôs accomplishments.
He passed along the costs to the tax payers. Trump says other countries pay the tariffs. He is outright lying. We just pay higher prices.
Trump doesn‚Äôt want any immigrants. Why doesn‚Äôt this guy know that Trump is going to try and ship him back to his country of origin?
Nice picture. Do you really believe there was a global effort to get Trump and McCain was part of it?
The intelligence agencies may have been little too aggressive in investigating the Russian angle, but there is no proof yet that they targetted Trump without reason. Almost 4 years of Trump/Barr investigation has proven nothing except procedural errors
Russian meddling in our election is proven fact. Even republican senate confirmed it. Trump appointed intelligence officers have confirmed the same. It is also proven that some within Trump orbit were talking to Russians. Was there a collusion/conspiracy? I don‚Äôt know. /1
My nephew and his gurlfriend moved to Texas from Shit Seattle and they are voting blue.... pisses me off. Because they hate Seattle cause its dirty but blame Trump. Indoctrination!
She's looking for cover for either voting for Trump again or for not voting for Biden, but for someone else.
Trump was barely seen wearing a mask. He has a huge following and if he simply tells his followers to wear the damn masks we would be in better shape.
So no explanation of what Trump has done?
Trump has sign an executive order for TikTok that will start in 45 days!!
Thankyou lmao. I don‚Äôt even know why she brought up the minority part but I don‚Äôt understand how people can vote for Trump after what he‚Äôs done these past 3 and a half years
BREAKING NEWS -  TRUMP HAS SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO BAN TIKTOK IN THE US IN 45 DAYS
If it's a wave election, Trump wins KY by 10.
Nope. False. If Trump wins, everybody loses except his supporters. If Biden wins, not everybody automatically wins, but at least people of color like me have a shot.
Thanks for brining up COVID. Trump mishandled it and caused our economy to sink. Hence why we are doing worst than other top country‚Äôs with COVID.
Almost 150k dead. Our economy is awful. Trump dosent care about anyone other than himself. I mean just listen to his latest interview done by HBO.
He's thinking better than Trump!
When Republicans do something to denounce Trump while he is still in power and actually do something about holding him responsible for his actions. Your dumb support for the GOP is disgusting.
I think the same.  President Trump is not a quitter. And he is now the most powerful person in the world, with a great chance for the reelection.
You can welcome tRump charities too   They both broke non profit rules.
i just saw my first trump flag in schaumburg i-
Another Trump presidency is exactly what we need. Drain the swamp!
We need everyone to vote.. by mail or in person.. leave no one behind. Vote blue! Remember Trump &amp; GOP will lie, cheat &amp; steal votes. Your Vote will count!üåäüåä
Any other POTUS would have better utilized this act. Trump completely mismanaged it.
Does Trump mean the kind of patriotism where you serve your country in the military? That‚Äôs not Trump. He is a coward draft dodger.
Until March Trump has been kissing China‚Äôs ass. The only reason he turned against them is the virus Trump completely mismanaged.
He could be a Satanist, I would still vote against Trump
True, but it does mean that there should be consequences to treasonous acts against the American people.  Replace trump, McConnell, Graham, &amp; the Russian 8, and then we can talk about reviving the  #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

The NRA is a corrupt non profit organization kinda like tRump charities
Just another example of Trump's making America great again.  Donny loves racist cops.
The dems are for one thing and they will destroy the country because you people are so stuborn. Give it up, you make people more pro-Trump and therefore Trump will win in November, thank you!
President Biden will be your President too. He will do much more for you than Trump but you won‚Äôt admit it. Just sit back and enjoy.
Trump has lost his stones. His true wussy colors are popping through. Just like the draft dodging coward he is.
Who‚Äôs not all there? Trump is not all there. That‚Äôs why he was forced to take a mental test. Someone must have been giving him the answers in order for this loon to pass it.
My thoughts are crystal clear. Trump is a draft dodging coward who has told more lies than the last 4 in aggregate. He is responsible for 150,000 lost lives, the worst deficit in history and the just reported worst quarter in history.
Let's not forget that  never has a true idea of what is going on and has DESTROYED this country since the moment he stepped foot into the White House.   Don't be blindsided, Trump is PROVEN to be unfit to lead this Great Country.  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Trump has misled Americans since the BEGINNING!!! How many American LIVES have we LOST due to his INCOMPETENCE???
The Trump administration investigation into the Clinton foundation found no wrong doing. No evidence supports your claim.
My god, these Trump fanatics have no shame.
But I do admit, I see why so many people love Trump. They make meekness and mediocrity look acceptable.  "I love Trump because he lowers the bar and makes me feel like less of a failure as a human." #DrainTheSwamp
"To hobble the U.S. Postal Service ...would be an obvious strategy of a terrorist group or a foreign adversary. It also appears to be the strategy of the president of the United States."
What a #coward trump is.  He lies with such ease it's disgusting.  #trumpisalier
Maybe he can hold his event in the Trump DC hotel, bill the campaign for the rooms and then bill us for the extra Secret Service costs.
It made Trump president. You' be Governor of your state in no time.
Putin trolling trump
that Donald Trump wanted to ban it!
1st order of business, Trump is elected. 2nd order of business, republicans take house back
Trump took advantage of rampant undiagnosed mental illness before.
I don‚Äôt know..... it‚Äôs too fast. I think it‚Äôs a placebo mixed with bleach. I‚Äôll follow science and not trump.
President Trump cannot pick and choose which facts are true and which are fake: the US has 4% of the global population and 25% of #COVID19 cases. We are not doing better than other countries.
Trump did what???
So are trump and republicans.
Our nation run by trump is in shambles.
I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll vote against trump. She doesn‚Äôt want to piss off her republican friends.
Trying to control judicial process. Shame on trump and cronies.
Let‚Äôs do a fact check on this video. trump manipulated images of Biden.
When Trump was ahead in the polls he planned to skip the debates. Now that he is losing so badly he wants them. Too bad for Trump.
You‚Äôre a liar Trump. What the GOP is trying to pass is not for the people. it‚Äôs all for big business so let that be clear
cities run by Republicans are death traps for The Trump virus and racist
Donald Trump is a criminal.  #DonsNextCon  Also, if you think trump is responsible for pandemic mismanagement, reply with #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory  ...go ahead. Just admit it. #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory

Trump is above the law
COVID-19 Unemployment Benefits: Donald Trump Says He‚Äôs Considering Executive Action On Extension, Other Relief If No Deal Reached With Democrats  Executive Orders do NOT become laws. Trump still doesn't get that after almost 4 years!
Trump has screwed more allies than anyone in history. He has also made the office he serves a laughingstock the world over.
The grossly incompetent one is Trump. We have never had a POTUS as incompetent as Trump.
My caucasian cousin just said, ‚ÄúTRUMP 2020‚Äù üôÉüëéüèº
This is what happens when you put an idiot in charge of the well being and security of a nation. Trump wanted HCQ, the govt had to buy it to soothe his ego and now they are going to promote it, damn the scientist And if 100s of thousand americans die, thats just an inconvenience
Belated thought... Did Trump also think this cartoon character's name was Yo-Semite Sam?
I mean Trump is friends with the same Mf.
You used to just be an annoying idiot. Now? 158,000 deaths on trump's hands mismanaging or gaming pandemic to steal another election. Murderer.  #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory #25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #WeStillShootTraitorsDontWe?

Trump plans to screw over everyone by cutting the benefit to 1/3 what it was.
Our country is run by Repub Trump &amp; over 1,000 people per day are dying from the Trump Corona Virus. We have the highest deficit in history, we just posted the worst quarter in history and Trump touts a drug that does more harm than good. I‚Äôd rather have demonstrators than die.
It is a good one , Trump did answer good , later on when they going to come back and ask  him again , he will say I I did tell you I will do whatever I can , total transparency. There you go , people who are awakened do know about UFO's ,  rest they can stay sleeping , lol .
This the real Trump!
I really don‚Äôt like Biden but Trump is a huge threat. As a queer person there is always an uncertainty that if things go sour we will be one of the first groups targeted. It‚Äôs a crappy situation and I don‚Äôt think you should be so judgmental. Yes I don‚Äôt like Biden.
Exactly. I don‚Äôt like Trump, but this isn‚Äôt even a fair comparison.
Florida: sets new record for COVID hospitalizations Trump: ‚ÄúThis is going away‚Äù
The only way to drain the swamp is to get rid of Trump.
Please Kanye fans, don't vote for him. Votes for Kanye will only help keep Trump in office. Kanye can't possibly win. He can't get on the ballot in all states. This is only ploy to take votes from Biden.
Don‚Äôt forget about the economy. GHB handed Clinton a crazy high deficit, which Clinton fixed. GWB handed Obama a nightmare, which Obama fixed. And then there‚Äôs Trump, who topped both GHB and GWB.
Crooked democrats will do anything to get Trump out of office. Too bad it will not work. So you might as well start crying now!
However like Trump it appeals to his base.
It says everything about President Trump that he struggled to say anything about John Lewis other than that he didn‚Äôt attend the President‚Äôs inauguration.
I'd let him teach my kids to drive for sure! Trump would teach them to aim for POC on sidewalks.
Awesome like Trump
Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so badly and the left will never get over it. They tried to destroy him with the all costs, it never worked out for them, never will.  And this November he will do the same for Joe Biden...oh boy!
'Daily Show' releases video mocking Trump for stumbling over his words  via   Gee. Isn't that the subject of one of trump's ads against Biden?
No way, no how will Biden debate Trump. It doesn't matter what Biden is, he won't be running anything, the party will be running the country, right over the cliff.
The kind of people who follow Trump who believes anyone not sufficiently loyal to him is an enemy of the state (cue authoritarianism). BTW he is the president and is running for reelection.
trump, Barr, what are you doing? Got caught with your pants down.
If we all bout a small book of stamps each month, the US Postal service could meet its payroll and expenditure demands without trump defunding.
Another reason to vote Trump 2020
Tr7mp made no national policy for the Trump Corona Virus so all 50 governors were bidding against each other for PPE and ventilators. This drove up prices many times higher than normal. Thanks Trump for costing us so much extra.
FISA warrants were all proven warranted. No crimes. Just Trump lies.
Yea, sure. I won‚Äôt believe it till I see prices actually come down. It is a proven FACT, TRUMP LIES more than any other POTUS in history.
If everyone could afford to, they could buy stamps via internet which would most likely keep the post office operational. That way the post office will not be underfunded when trump defunds them.
As a vet myself these are exactly my feelings. I will NOT be VOTING for TRUMP THE DRAFT DODGING COWARD.
What‚Äôs you PHD in, imagination? There is no deep state. It would be impossible to cover up. Not that many people could keep their mouths shut that long. Quit drinking the Trump kool aid.
This still isn't as bad as Trump many times a day.This is a set up to reduce payroll taxes so Trump &amp; Republicans can claim future cuts to Medicare!
FNC's Wallace: Trump, Biden Have Both Said 'Troubling,' 'Insulting' Things About Black Community. Chris Wallace is a LIAR and protecting racist biden and it‚Äôs sickening

I don't think the science changed. I see a lot of people coming to the conclusion school closures were never necessary. I think the converse. They are still needed, but this snake is willing to gamble safety for political gain. Schumer is low key as bad as Trump.
President Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat. But what is WeChat, and why is it so controversial?
Trump is incapable of debating in any meaningful way. There will be no debates.
I‚Äôm a disabled vet too. Trump has done nothing for us. We didn‚Äôt even get a COLA this year. Obama passed choice not trump.
His and his family‚Äôs lives have been threatened and Trump is a bully who incites more people against him. He‚Äôs stuck between a rock and a hard place.
Omg you don‚Äôt know the Bible at all. Otherwise you would not be supporting trump.
It‚Äôs not 99% survivability. And even if you do survive it permanently can damage your lungs, heart, brain, kidneys etc.  go away with your false facts. You sound like trump with his children are immune crap. Tell that to the kids who have it and the ones who died.

Positing that "the left" (usually a boogeyman of astronomical proportions) is somehow more dangerous than Trump/ism indicates just how blind and/or evil those making such assertions really are. It's sheer upside-down-world madness. They are who they warn us about. #since2016
The orders take effect in 45 days and could bar the popular apps from the Apple and Google app stores, effectively removing them from U.S. distribution.
Trump will never be a decent human being.
Just a random thought. Local police are now interested in stopping the riots. Why? Because they are helping President Trump get re-elected.
It kind of does, though.  Republicans haven‚Äôt been Republicans for decades.  Trump is restoring faith in a party that people like your father ran into the ground.

Of course he isn't. Neither is trump.
She has every right to nit want to defund the police. Hell, many Black Lives Matter supporters don't agree with defunding. The Trump thing is more of the fact to many Black people, Trumpnis racist. So Chubba felt his coach supoorting him meant he was against Black lives

Something about me being a diehard Cowboys fan who is voting for Trump! That will get the dms going!
On this point, Jared Yates Sexton, author of "American Rule: How a Nation Conquered the World But Failed Its People," wrote last Thursday on Twitter:¬†  "Those of us warning that Trump is an authoritarian capable of destroying democracy haven't been doing it for profit...
"Ultimately, those of us who warned the American people¬†for years, sometimes on a daily basis,¬†about this¬†Mad King and would-be tyrant¬†take no joy from saying,¬†We told you so.¬†There is no satisfaction in¬†being correct about such a horrible thing.
You didn‚Äôt get the memo that Trump is responsible for anything bad that happens and gets no credit for anything good.
Dr Tedros told the WHO Committee, ‚ÄúThe pandemic is a once-in-a-century health crisis, the effects of which will be felt for decades to come.‚Äù  Yet, Trump refuses to take COVID-19 seriously.  #WeWillVote  #GTCBlue #gtc2020   #GTCB008

Great to see someone actually holding Trump to the fire, but good grief. That was painful.
The new bit  on Trump is wholly original and awesome, but reminds me of what  said about Trump. I love both. Two completely different takes on the same premise.
That's kind of what I've seen as well, but I kind of also think at this point they have to take that risk. They are the only ones that have access to Trump like this, and they need to expose him for what he is
Did God ordain Barack Obama to be Pres? Ordination doesn‚Äôt equal sanctification. Trump is in power because God sovereignly works all things according to the purpose of His will (Eph 1:11). That‚Äôs not an endorsement or reason to trust Trump

Then the press needs to boycott the entire GOP convention and not give trump any free press or coverage.
I think he would kill it but Biden strikes me as the kind of guy that would pick someone that looks less biased knowing they are going to have to investigate this administration and Trump for a multitude of reasons. Seems like he would worry about further dividing the people. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Trump taught him that
"Prosecutor in 2009 Epstein Case Said Donald Trump Was the ONLY ONE Who Helped Him"
Trump effectively ensured there won‚Äôt be a delay in the election. He forced Democrats to go on record as demanding it not be delayed. It is classic reverse psychology.  Trump played them, &amp; they got suckered into ensuring COVID-19 won‚Äôt delay the election.  Brilliant!!!
TRUMP!!!!  Biden is showing signs of dementia!  He is not fit to be President let alone in charge of a ice cream truck!
He‚Äôs on tv saying China virus when everyone knows it now as the Trump Virus
And with one tweet, he ensures that Democrats won‚Äôt be able to attempt to delay the election.  In one tweet he removes that option from the deck Democrats are trying to stack against him.  Donald Trump is a brilliant man!!!

The election MUST proceed as SCHEDULED!!!  You, Donald Trump, do not have the right to delay it!  It was NOT delayed during the US Civil War and will NOT be delayed in the mess that is 2020!
Yo, you realize if there‚Äôs a delay in election that Trump doesn‚Äôt just get an extension right? The Speaker of the House  would act as interim president. While I think that‚Äôd be great, I think you should be careful what you wish for.
This entire scam was planned to get rid of Trump. The Dems don‚Äôt care about one persons life.
Let me ask, if it was a Democrat in the office right now, would you be singing the same tune? Mail-in voting provides a safe, SECURE means of voting in this pandemic (which, by the way, Trump has downplayed at every turn)
Thank you President Trump,  we need law and order in this country.
I‚Äôm just going to say it right now: both the democrats and Trump are wrong on their election solutions. Americans voted in person during the civil war, even during a pandemic voting in person is the best way to go since polling places will do everything possible to ensure safety.
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.

I don't see how some black and Jewish people don't get this. Racists tend to hate both of us. And if they do keep us around ahem, Stephen Miller and diamond and silk it is to justify how they aren't racist. Imagine disrespecting your ancestors for trump.
Not wanting trump to win is different than what Russia is doing. Russia is actively working for Trump.
And Russia is again working to ensure that Trump wins.
But he isn't. If it ok for Marc to support farrakhan then we have to be okay with white people supporting trump. There are no levels of racism. If you are a rando that hates Jews you are no better than the president who hates black people. Sure the president can do more damage.
But both are abhorrent are they not? You're right trump has more power and influence with his racism. But Farrakhan also comes from his own position of power, however insignificant it is compared to trump. And his racism must be equally unacceptable.
And I heard his lawyer helping him file works for the Trump campaign.

That is the most ridiculous .... so SECupp doing this for publicity? To support Trump? I have no respect for her.
Socialist/Marxist Democrats are tearing down every norm, then blaming it on President Trump.  It's Democrats who want to hold debates ransom, in exchange for Trump's tax returns?  Providing tax returns, is not a legal condition to Presidency?  Democrats claim it's unconventional?

Trump really has a way of making Biden sound like he's a way better candidate than he actually is
Joe Biden is like... A hundred times more racist than Donald Trump. And he keeps showing it.
Trump spent 3 1/2 years pouring massive amounts of borrowed money into the economy and like Bush W in his reelection campaign, has kept interest rates very low. Then when the virus hit, they poured trillions into the market
Remember when everybody at the United Nation laughed at trump when he claimed to have accomplished so much. The only reason people aren't laughing now is because they are aghast at trump's incompetence and body count
Well there would be Trump
Another way to interpret Trump's response is that he believes Biden to have monumental power beyond the comprehension of mere mortals.

I don‚Äôt think Trump really cares if we vote by mail. What he is doing is setting the stage for claiming that many of the mail in votes are fraudulent. Then when he loses, he can say he warned us and that the election was corrupted and therefore not legal.
jan. is a long time to wait without a national testing &amp; tracking system. How many more people have to die before trump admits he make the same mistake China did, what any autocratic government does: deny. Yet, unlike the Chinese that went on for weeks, trump is going for months
Consider his fudging around electoral college(EC)/popular vote(PV) splits.  In 2000, the 13 points picked Gore, so it was supposed to be a PV model.  In 2016, it picked Trump, who lost the PV but won the EC, so now it's a model of who will win at least one of PV and EC.

Trump will never do another interview other than Fox / Hannity ever again. He‚Äôs normally so coddled and protected that he forgot what it‚Äôs like to be asked real questions.
Hey Joe, continue to let that black face mask hang off of one ear and you'll look like a comedy character out of the Sunday "funnies!" In plain English, you are dumb and stupid for allowing the radical left to hijack your campaign. But we love it! Trump 2020, Victory!

so I get this right, let me recap. Russia has turned to Chuck Grassley with info to help Trump. What happened to you? I guess Russian money. You both need to go!!!!!!!
Trump dismantled pandemic team. That put us way behind recovery. It could be debated if deaths could have been prevented but certainly diminished.
WTF is Trump talking about?   Pre-existing conditions are already covered by Obamacare. It doesn't make sense that he would destroy the ACA, which covers pre-existing conditions, in order to sign an EO guaranteeing coverage for pre-existing conditions.
President Trump said he's not worried about the legality of the executive order.
President Trump announces he's working on an executive order that will require health insurances companies to cover all pre-existing conditions for all customers. He said it could be coming as soon as two weeks from now.
I honestly feel like both sides are taking it down to the wire in a dumb game of political chicken. When passed, the extra $$ will be retroactive. If not, our only other hope is to rely on a Trump executive order.
Just sayin‚Äô.

Ronald Reagan massacred the LGBT community with *his* non-response to AIDS, Richard Nixon beat and brutalized his political enemies and minorities with the War on Drugs, and Trump has failed us all by letting 150k Americans die in a preventable pandemic.
Regardless of how ludicrous the smear, it needs to be pointed out that by repeating it, you‚Äôre just furthering the smear and doing Trump‚Äôs propaganda work for him.
Simple question to ask your MAGA friends.   Why does Trump always take the side of criminals?  Examples: -NRA -Ghislaine Maxwell  -Epstein -The people he has pardoned -Putin  They should be able to answer this simple question without blabbing about QAnon conspiracies or Fox News.
Yes and he keeps shuffling through the papers, trying to find one that proves his point. Maybe Trump should go back to school when they open. Then he can test if it's safe!

I don't see how some black and Jewish people don't get this. Racists tend to hate both of us. And if they do keep us around ahem, Stephen Miller and diamond and silk it is to justify how they aren't racist. Imagine disrespecting your ancestors for trump.
But he isn't. If it ok for Marc to support farrakhan then we have to be okay with white people supporting trump. There are no levels of racism. If you are a rando that hates Jews you are no better than the president who hates black people. Sure the president can do more damage.
But both are abhorrent are they not? You're right trump has more power and influence with his racism. But Farrakhan also comes from his own position of power, however insignificant it is compared to trump. And his racism must be equally unacceptable.
And I heard his lawyer helping him file works for the Trump campaign.
And how many times did Trump bitch about President Obama signing Executive Orders??
No wonder Trump won't stand up to Putin!! (Beside the obvious fact that Trump is weak-willed.)

So what do you want to do, burn the state?  At least President Trump can find Ohio.  Where's O'biden?  Obama speaks for Biden, Jill speaks for Biden, but Biden never speaks?  Takes no candid questions, only responds to specific journalists, when he knows the question &amp; answer.
Gas lamp is lit folks! Here comes more Trump bullshit
Biden is objectively better than Trump. Biden can pick a toaster as his running-mate and I‚Äôd still vote for him. #LincolnVoter
I‚Äôm a former Republican. I couldn‚Äôt believe Trump was the Republican nominee. Trump is a known socialist.
Seems pretty clear that Trump never watched this interview - he seemed ill-informed, argumentative, and in general, an ignorant buffoon.  Maybe it was "fair" after all!
The Chinese may have done what any autocratic government usually does, deny, but they only did that for weeks, while trump has been denying for months and doesn't seem ready to do anything about the virus until after the election, if then
The Chinese, like a typical dictatorship, may have denied the hidden virus for weeks and thus increased the problem, but trump has been denying for months and doesn't seem ready to do anything about the virus until after the election. How long can we wait while more people die?
from Nursing home to hotel, prior to imposing COVID patients on nursing homes?  This woman knew it was a death sentence.  Did she advise Wolf?  Why did this only happen in Democrat run states?  This is what should anger you and every American.  Seniors are Trump's voter base?
Senator Ron Johnson is a pathetic joke. He does zilch for his constituents and Americans in general - he's just worried about what Trump wants.
This whole attack on USPS is purely political - no question about it.  What kind of adult supervision is in place to restrain Trump's "Chumpmaster General"?
Are you suggesting Trump is a liar? 3 weeks ago we were promised his "beautiful" health-care plan in 2 weeks. Also... crickets.   Literally nothing he has promised has come to fruition - certainly not anything important.
#EDITORIAL  Trump unfit to be president  I have over 60,000 #free #eBooks including #Frankenstein by #MaryShelley
Talk is cheap, money is not. Trump has a very long history of not paying his bills, so we shouldn't be surprised. But why would the city host him again BEFORE that last bill is paid?
This was laugh out loud funny.
Rather have a successful civilian like President Trump!  School principle?  US education ranks 38 out of 71 industrialized countries?  20 yrs ago, US was #1.  Democrat run academia is an abysmal failure.  No child left behind, means HS grads can't read.  No grading k-12, now no
Those 2 people helped to enable trump at every turn.
Left constantly referring to President Trump as dictator or Nazi?  Who is actually hiding the truth?  President Trump is out there every day, answering questions from MSM.  When Democrats have something to answer for, MSM goes dark.  Must have loyal MSM for totalitarian Gov?
is an idiot. Promoting conspiracy theories is beneath the office of the presidency. It's shameful and dishonest.  Trump: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm doing the country a big favor‚Äô with my conspiracy theories about voter fraud

Hillary was grilled for 11 hours and found no wrongdoing. Trump has the top scientist in the world telling him to shut down the country and he refused to do it because he didn‚Äôt want to believe them and now look where we are at. I‚Äôd say he committed a worse crime.
jan. is a long time to wait without a national testing &amp; tracking system. How many more people have to die before trump admits he make the same mistake China did, what any autocratic government does: deny. Yet, unlike the Chinese that went on for weeks, trump is going for months
Definitely not an opportunity to build a new FBI building in walking distance to trump's hotel either? To line *45's, Jared &amp; ivanka's pockets even further? Am I correct  ??
Hah! Trump looks like a friend of mineüòÇ
Let's hope she is going to have stuff to charge Trump and his organization.  I would like nothing better than to be able to say Ex-President Trump earlier than Nov 3rd.
The Trump Economy
trump is manipulating and burying things and classifying things and hiding things so he can cheat his way to the very end of his term.  Then... we're gonna get him.  Cannot wait.  And Biden will NOT pardon him.
Democrats should get Diamond &amp; Spice -- whatever their names are -- on the ballot to take Trump votes away.  The Pubes are hoping that Kanye does that to the Dems.
Are you crazy? There were 4 deaths in Benghazi, because of Trump‚Äôs ineptitude and claiming it was a hoax there are close to 160k deaths. He won‚Äôt be forgotten at the polls. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #ByeDon2020
Trump cares more about the legality of mail-in ballots than he does about COVID19. People see right through that, too.
Eminent domain is socialism. Ergo, Trump is a socialist.
What is ‚Äúconservative‚Äù about eminent domain? Trump is even more socialist than Bernie Sanders.
I have to say, the moment this Trump donor was nominated for Postmaster this was the inevitable and predictable outcome.  This unqualified political hatchet-master general should resign yesterday and let someone competent do the job.  Don't wait til he tries to sell off USPS!!!
I think everyone knows it's illegal but Trump and Meadows.
Only accused felons get "wished well" by Trump.
I can't wait til Trump goes away!
Wear did the IMPOTUS get his legal advice from? Rudy?  I would wait till someone with more knowledge of the situation. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt take Trump‚Äôs word for it
Your "low-grade depression" is because our MAGA President Trump has REVERSED the destructive policies of the years 2008-2016!
I was president of the DePaul College Republicans. I voted for Johnson in 2016, because Trump supports eminent domain, protectionism, and massive deficit spending. Since then, Trump has only gotten worse and the GOP has been enabling him. I‚Äôm voting for all Democrats this year.
His statements all come down to...if folks are allowed to vote, Republicans will never hold office. His action of suppression backs up that theory. The people of the US despise trump.
Opinion: This is one of the most unpatriotic moments in Trump's presidency - CNN  A rambling imbecile...that‚Äôs the only way I can describe this.
Trump‚Äôs gang simply has no bottom.  Period.
Um, have you ever heard Trump? Glass houses bro.
You think trump cares? These are just the side effects of him screwing the post office.
How can Trump, who clearly has less than zero credibility opine on the credibility of a well-respected career DOJ employee.  Trump will sink to any depth, and insult anyone about any topic. He is disgusting.
As a friend of mine stated, Trump's dissonance between his lack of intelligence and high level of confidence in that Axios interview is unbelievable
Maybe West will be trump's VP pick
I really think trump thinks we are doing so much better than any other country. Delusion
Clearly Trump has no idea what he's looking at in that clip... but I'll forever remember that brief exchange... Trump: "you can't do that" Swan: "WHAT CAN'T I DO THAT?"  And of course no relevant response from Trump.
I can't even imagine. People losing both parents. How do you survive that? And we are telling teachers to up their life insurance policies? Really? And I watched trump compare our testing to India? How the mighty have fallen.
What does that say about the incumbent?  That someone that is "in hiding" is a better choice for president that trump... that's what it says.
This is not a crime, this is exactly why we have elections.  The people elected President Trump, to change the course and policies of the United States.  Democrats didn't like that!  Democrats assumed policy continuation was certain under Hillary. Shocking degree of corruption!
They all went rogue!  Obama, Biden, Yates, Clapper, Brennan, Comey, Rosenstein, McCabe &amp; Stroyk.  This is the darkest period in American history, a single party corrupted our justice dept &amp; our election system. Sally Yates just testified, Trump was undercutting Obama policies?
Did IMPOTUS ask the money to be transferred to TRUMP MANAGEMENT or directly into his personal account at Deutsche Bank
Seems like  conducted a master class in interviewing. He read the charts, and called out what he saw - clearly Trump didn't understand the charts, which is scary in itself.  When is Trump scheduled to sit down w/Swan for Part 2???
And how many students returning to school prematurely will "go away" after they die from coronavirus? How many teachers and school staff?  How many kids will bring the virus home to parents and/or grandparents. Trump is incapable of thinking this far ahead - but we all have to!
He was "not asked to do anything" - good to know that DeSantis is not capable of doing anything on his own initiative. I'm sure he heard how bad Florida's system was, and he didn't care to address it. (Maybe on orders from Trump?)
Education is essential, not these Liberal Progressives who radicalize our kids; teach Socialism and Racism.  President Trump was right again, when he passed School Choice.  Use it!  Essential conditions for Teachers Unions?  Medicare for all and 116b to Teachers Union, baked into
Trump doesn't understand anything about National or world issues. He only reads what he's given by Kushner or Miller. He's not very good at the reading part either.
But Vance in NY can still get him!  And I sure hope he does - Trump is a habitual liar and crook and must be held accountable one way or another.
Of course, how could anything Obama does or says be anything else? Trump is super-jealous of Obama, simply because he doesn't measure up.
Exactly. I'm tired of hearing about it. The DNC are really ticking me off lately. Biden can't pick anybody that doesn't have "baggage." If not, &amp; the perfect running mate is out there, Trump's goons will just make something up anyway.
Trump throwing a former allie under the bus is not news.
Clearly the GOP has nothing to offer voters in 2020 beyond the tired old attacks and tropes from 2016... and there's that coronavirus thing - how's that working out for Trump?
Everyone should find Trump's insane claims offensive. He's done little for anyone but the Trumps and the Kushners, and he'll leave our nation in ruins after his dismal failure on coronavirus.
Of course, because Trump sues anyone and everyone.
Trump will take that grudge to his grave... Why? Because it's all about Trump, no one else matters.
I can only dream about a future where we don't have to hear the lies and made-up BS Trump spews all day. Please, everyone vote so we can end this national disgrace that is the Trump Presidency!!
Is Ivanka or Melania under the desk with tRump?üò≥
If Biden does not say that, how can Trump hear it?? Unless, of course, he's lying. Again.
Lies! Lies! Latino, as well as every other minority, had the lowest unemployment  in "history."   Blacks, women &amp; students, all setting employment records.  President Trump did it once, &amp; he will do it again, post virus.  New jobs coming home, include PPE &amp; drug production.  MAGA
Hopefully, trump will go away
Is trump saying he is very angry inside
No, she's practicing being presidential, for when she becomes trump's VP pick
I can see how some people might think trump put Swan in his place, but that would require people to believe the president's gibberish. I've heard three year olds have a better logical grasp of reality than trump

They're from the virus. The 1000 US deaths a day. While Trump Golfs and says "It is what it is" when asked about the 1000 Coronavirus US deaths a day. Hospitals are overwhelmed, people like you are down playing the risk, tRump is ignoring his responsibilities and playing Golf.

Please Mr.Trump, do more to end this virus...you are the leader of this country....if you are unwilling or unable to do so, please leave your position.

If Harris is the VP, then Schiff could be appointed to the Senate and the Senate Intelligence Committee. That would get him media coverage in the campaign and with Biden getting much less coverage than trump, Schiff getting air time would be a big plus
That's how trump stimulated the economy, even before the virus, by drastically reducing the interest rate that the Fed charges and by pouring massive amounts of borrowed cash into the economy
I used to think that trump was a Machiavellian genius that was tricking the simple-minded by twisting facts, but now it's very obvious that he's just plain slow
I'm beginning to think that trump really believes this nonsense. I thought he was a Machiavellian expert that was cleverly confusing the issue for his rather slow base, but it turns out that he's really just dumb
It's like they're begging for another terrorist attack just so they can blame it on Trump. Cuz ya know, nothing else has worked.
This election is between trump and Biden. Not Hillary, Obamam or Pelosi.   We've seen what Biden did as VP for eight years. We've seen what trump has NOT done in the past nearly 4 years. Before this country is destroyed, we must make a choice.  I've made mine.
He couldn‚Äôt get a word in. Only thing this did was further expose Trump‚Äôs narcissism and stupidity. Old adage:give him enough rope-hopefully SOON!
And I am not accusing him of not supporting human rights prior to this. But, to see him kneel during the national anthem and making this statement after once having Donald Trump on his mask is where the change is made.
Typical tRump bull shit dog whistle.  He needs to clear this up but he won't.  He wants the racists to know he's with them but he can't come out clearly either way Yet. It's pretty clear if you're paying attention.
David Duke endorses tRump. No surprise, We are numb to this shit.
We should go out to some desert wasteland and dig a big, deep hole - that should be named for Trump. Both his head and his heart are just big, dark, empty columns of nothingness and narcissism.  "The Donald Trump Memorial Black Hole" sounds about right....
Watching this interview and paused where Jonathan swan says thousands of Americans are dying every day and Trump replies it is what is is.
Trump is right. Let‚Äôs all do absentee voting. The perfect compromise. #TrumpThreatensAmerica #DangerousIdiot
This is INCREDIBLY ALARMING!! Republicans know they can‚Äôt win if people vote. They stole the vote in 2016, they can steal it again this year. Trump is correct, this could be a the most corrupt election ever, but not for the reasons he‚Äôs stating.
This interview is the most frightening thing I think I've ever seen. We're being "led" by an arrogant, ignorant, hyper-sensitive fool.  John Lewis didn't go to Trump's inauguration, so he can't say anything positive. That's says it all.   Kudos, great work!
If it doesn't have pictures or a glorifying testimonial to trump, he won't even look at it.
I predict Trump gets 20+% of the African American vote this time around.
can't read.  No SAT testing and free college, means all will go, few will qualify.  Academia, wants to mainline tax money directly to failed institutions, without holding teachers responsible for failing kids.  Thank God Trump passed School Choice, use it!

The intelligence agencies may have been little too aggressive in investigating the Russian angle, but there is no proof yet that they targetted Trump without reason. Almost 4 years of Trump/Barr investigation has proven nothing except procedural errors

Sad to see them cut and run, but Dylan blaming Q and Trump for his own doubt and fear was... interesting. Not going out of my way to watch his YouTube. But I‚Äôll check it if it floats in, out of curiosity.
I don‚Äôt think Trump really cares if we vote by mail. What he is doing is setting the stage for claiming that many of the mail in votes are fraudulent. Then when he loses, he can say he warned us and that the election was corrupted and therefore not legal.
Trump has screwed more allies than anyone in history. He has also made the office he serves a laughingstock the world over.
The grossly incompetent one is Trump. We have never had a POTUS as incompetent as Trump.
Consider his fudging around electoral college(EC)/popular vote(PV) splits.  In 2000, the 13 points picked Gore, so it was supposed to be a PV model.  In 2016, it picked Trump, who lost the PV but won the EC, so now it's a model of who will win at least one of PV and EC.

This is the price we pay for the electoral college electing Trump.
We were talking about Trump but sure let‚Äôs bring up Biden since y‚Äôall know Trump is awful. No the 1994 bill was awful and unlike Trump supporters we accept what Biden has done wrong. Want to talk about the Obama administration and it‚Äôs accomplishments.

Hahah,  so for saying ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt keep kids in cages‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrump should denounce China‚Äôs actions against the Uighurs‚Äù I‚Äôm bound by chains? Right- clearly I‚Äôm the one bonded, lol. Keep tumbling, Zach.
Buy American? Trump makes over $1 million from st While dozens of the Trump-branded products sold by the store are listed as having been made in the United States, a sizable chunk are made in foreign countries or are from an unknown origin. #SmartNews
why isn‚Äôt donald trump unemployed like the rest of us - at least we were good at our jobs ????
so far Kanye's platform is, "I sort of think Trump is cool, and also abortion is bad."   these are not positions designed to attract Democratic voters.
Trump just announced Obamacare

The post office is under direct malicious assault.  Every Republican that voted to support Trump during the impeachment is complicit in the direct attack on our civil service and must be removed from office immediately (or in November).

I‚Äôm in Chicago, I‚Äôve seen zero Biden signs.  Still seeing many Bernie bumper stickers and I‚Äôve seen a few for Trump.  I drove through northern Illinois and through Wisconsin in June  and it was trump flags, signs, bumper stickers, hats, shirts everywhere!
So how did Trump make people on the left more racist? Peoples internal instinct about someone they don‚Äôt know is just human nature, that doesn‚Äôt make them racist. Everyone in the world does it. Btw Biden is also kinda racist
It's hilarious how easy it is for Trump to run to the left of the Democrats
This is scary shit.  Just another octopus tentacle of Trump.
No it doesn‚Äôt. The only reason why this nation is so divided is because of Trump. I‚Äôm not voting for Biden cuz he‚Äôs a white catholic man like myself, I‚Äôm voting for him because he‚Äôs the most qualified for the job and I want him to pick the most qualified woman to be VP.
Fuck trump supporters.
Trump hasn‚Äôt handled shit.
Well, stop talking about Trump. Have some manners u were working with Obama for so many years and done nothing. What a hypocrite. U are 77 year old for the love of jesus what can accomplish?
Laying the blame on Trump and his administration for the scourge that Communist China released on the world is fairly typical of the Marxist Democrats who instead of working with the administration, initiated many inane and failed investigations including a sham impeachment.
And not just Trump. Straight ticket Republican or we'll just get more ridiculous impeachment attempts
Yo what has Trump done for this country? Like dead ass I really want to know.
I fully expect once Trump is out of office several charges and indictments will occur, not only that most likely other countries like Canada will announce he is not welcome.  Maybe even war crimes for what he did in Syria, many people died when pulled the troops out.
Narrowly lost should remind us that Trump narrowly won and that nearly half of our electorate thought he was a good choice.
We need President Trump who is not afraid to rock the boat and to deal with these countries who take economic advantage of our nation. His predecessors were just too inept, too complacent and did not have the business acumen nor the balls to stand up and renegotiate trade deals.
He does. It‚Äôs Friday. Central time for those trump supporting idiots who don‚Äôt know how time works
Does Trumpüçäü§° even know that DISSENT &amp; PROTEST are America's PARENTS? This country would not have come into existence if it wasn't for these characteristics. So much so, Thomas Jefferson advocated that it's okay to burn the post office (symbol of Govt) once in a while.
He Predicted Trump‚Äôs Win in 2016. Now He‚Äôs Ready to Call 2020.
I said this 4 years ago when Trump got elected, he has mental and social disorders, anyone who thinks he can or wants to change is delusional, for years I keep hearing Chris and the media ask "why" stop asking why, its been and always will be a lost cause, its in his DNA.
Allegedly, and I hope if true she gets justice. Neither Trump or Biden are fit for office.
He is pro trump so make sense
Isn't it funny the most hard core religious right wingers turn out to be the biggest violators of the bible?  Trump talks about God all the time, everyone forgets the dozen or more sexual assault/harassment allegations, the women he paid off, Epstein trips with underage girls.
You get that the estimate was by a conservative group trying to bring down Obama, right? They thought $106 million was an outrageous amount for eight years, and then Trump outspent it in two and a half
Everyone this is NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE OFLEADERSHIP.  TRUMP steal ideas all the time smh. #ThanksObama
Clinton...Bush and Obama served 8 years....Trump has only been in office 3 1/2 years
Wow!  We already have this because of the ACA "Thanks Obama".WTF writes this  stuff and I guess a better Q is who announces it?This is right up there with "hurting God".Y'all are overestimating the stupidity of the masses. Most of us are not as dimwitted as trump cultists.
No, it‚Äôs because Trump is so hateable.
I don't think Repubs.will disavow all of Trump's legacy. There will remain those obedient to Trump's three legged stool of "success":    1) lead with audacity/charisma.  2) unleash constant barrage of information (keeps you in the news);  3) cater to the darker side of humanity.
Thanks Obama.  If it wasn‚Äôt for you, Trump would never be the greatest East President we have ever had!
I have never voted. I was never going to vote. My whole life I hated politicians and saw no difference in my life between an R or a D.  But the Democrats have effed up.  If the polling station were on fire in the middle of a hurricane I'd still go and vote for Trump.
Nope.  Kanye is a Trump pawn.  He admitted it it in a recent interview.  He‚Äôs only in it to peel gullible folks‚Äô votes away from Biden in hopes of throwing the election to Trump.  Don‚Äôt fall for it.  #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Such a frustrating few days. Why can‚Äôt adults just be adults? It‚Äôs like since trump got in office, people have forgotten their professionalism. UGHHHHHH.
Do you think this discrimination solely comes from people with conservative values and Trump supporters? Or do you think this is a nationwide/universal issue?
Trump 2020 all the way!
I just a hard time believing anyone thinks Biden will do more harm in four years--to the climate or to humans--than Trump will. And that's without taking into account Trump's dismantling of democracy and the real possibility that we don't get another chance in 24 if it's him. 1/2
Jimmy dore is a closet republican. He never criticizes trump for anything.
Not wrecking the economy Obama left him was his only strength... but then he wrecked the economy.   It's crazy that Trump has literally no real accomplishments he can run on.
Actually, Reagan was one of the originators of modern politicians tapping into fears to stoke division and hate.  He helped forge this path we're on now.  He was just better at hiding it from most people &amp; put more finesse into it than The tRump.
BIDEN DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO PROVE. IF HE CAN'T DEBATE SAFELY, IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM NOT TO. TRUMP IS AN IDIOT &amp; HIS DEBATES WOULD JUST CONSIST OF FALSE SMEARS ON BIDEN/DEMS AND NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR THEM ANYMORE!!
Let's face it: Trump has never written a memo.
Trump certainly Pardoned a lot of people for Kim Kardashian while she is REBRANDING her image as a lawyer. She sure has gotten a lot of publicity and deals from it. I wonder at what cost?
I've got like 23 family members ready to vote. Only 1 I couldn't reach. He's lost to Trump lol
Trump doesn't even hide it...  This old Marine is voting in person! F*CK THE VIRUS! F*Ck TRUMP! SEMPER-FI!!!
Maddow breaks it wide open.  This is how Republicans are trying to keep Trump in office, by sowing misinformation from Russia directly to the Senate. WTAF!!!! #TRMS
It is sad and embarrassing to watch this man. Of course I‚Äôm voting for Donald Trump because he‚Äôs intelligent, good with business, and he really cares about America. Joe Biden needs a nursing home.
How kind of Trump to Pardon so many people from Jail for Kim Kardashian as she is REBRANDING herself now as a lawyer. She was at the WH in April, with her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù Ivanka in May/June. She sure got A LOT OF PUBLICITY &amp; deals. Although, Hm.was it at a cost?
I actually welcome this stupidity. Fact is many Republican voters support this kind of BS, if they didn't they wouldn't have voted and continue to support Trump, you can't have it both ways, you can't support Trump and not his views. If you vote Trump you are a racist.
Restored from Trump?
Funny u say that when most states that fail are democrats running not Republican And trump made the best economy not democrats and trump if u r smart did more during this pandemic than any democrat would have dems wouldn't of stopped travel and this shit would've been way worse
Hey Trump that‚Äôs not a health plan!
I hear that Trump said that Biden against God. For some reason, I find that funny. It would be an interesting challenge to figure out what that means or could mean precisely. It would be even funnier if we got a sign from God himself. At the debates, somebody should ask Biden,
hillary or trump? buddy‚Äôs four years late
The repayment would be on Congress. Trump can order the withholding deferred. Obama did I believe. Not sure before that.
Trump giving press conferences from his private country clubs is SO Donald Trump, and it makes me want to puke.
If Trump thought he was pronouncing it right he wouldn‚Äôt have corrected himself. More importantly he doesn‚Äôt know where Thailand is unless he went there with Epstein.
No, no, no.  The reason we have more cases is because we test more. Testing clearly causes the cases.  Thus sayeth trump.

you lost me at "conservative christian fundamentalists.  They're not any of those things.  They're Jerry Fallwell jr. Sucking money to advance their complete utter cynical perversion to get rich off dumb followers. That's why they love trump. They're all in on the con.
He‚Äôs not able to circumvent Article 1 Section 9, so he‚Äôs either monkeying around funds or pressuring McConnell - who seems willing to let these expire and has started to distance himself from Trump
Pompeo is now telling America, 8/7/20, he met with Russian ambassador telling him to stop putting bounties on American troops in July of 2020. Why?? Pompeo did not want trump to know he was working against trump.
At a time when a pandemic rages across the globe, trump  is propagating divisions with allies, enemies alike. The world cannot fight a virus effectively without cooperation! And only trump is doing the exact opposite of what needs to be done!
I don‚Äôt believe those other countries are using HCQ at all.  That‚Äôs being touted only by trump.
If Trump is going to eff with the postal service, we need to have contingencies in place to ensure ballots make it to the election boards on-time. Make sure people can drop them off in-person. Carpools (but how, during pandemic?) to get people to the drop-offs.
When Trump said it was a peaceful protest I laughed a hearty laugh.  He's the best.
GOP! IF THAT'S TRUE, WHY IS IT OK FOR TRUMP AND ALL YOU REPUBLICANS TO VOTE BY MAIL? YOU JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO SUPRESS VOTES FOR DEMOCRATS BY DENYING THEM THE ABILITY TO MAIL IN THEIR VOTES! WE KNOW WHAT YOU CORRUPT REPS ARE DOING!

No explanation needed. Now o chill out with another true Christian, Jim Bakker. Remember him? Pants down Jimmy. What's with these televangelist? Horny bastards. All of them get caught with their pants down with prostitutes while preaching " praise the Lord". And supporting Trump.

I remember when late night talk show hosts used to take on the left And the right and it was comedy. Now all of you are just another arm of the left wing media constantly attacking Trump and it is no longer comedy. Can‚Äôt wait to see how nuts you are after he wins
Is this what radicalized Zuck to be farther to the right than Trump‚Äôs followers?
I think she is in on it, I mean she just met with Trump in April. He sure gave her a lot of Pardons and publicity to boost her new lawyer career look..but was it at a cost? Who knows. What I do know is that there‚Äôs is no way they didn‚Äôt see this coming and Kimye is NO VICTIM.
Donald Trump is only a ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù president for those laws with which he personally agrees (and which don‚Äôt harm his ability to rake in tens of millions of dollars at his own properties while serving as president).

Trump is a racist and a bigot. Trump wants us to believe Biden is a racist. Really!!! Here is trump‚Äôs history as a racist.

I know they're probably trying to look tough... in their country club attire ü§£ü•∫  But just like every other picture of Trump rally-goers, (and just like Trump himself) there's no joy. Just anger and meanness.   How is this 'winning'?  It's kind of sad.
in Hitler's Germany and Whitmer's Michigan elections are stolen. Postmarks are no longer required on mail in ballots - so no proof is required they were mailed - to make ballot box stuffing free and easy. They prove Trump right at the same time they deny it.
Nobody knew about the Bible until trump found it &amp; made it popular Many people are saying trump says he read it cover to cover &amp; completely memorized it According to a credible source, trump proved it to supporters, saying "it says Holy Bible on one cover &amp; nothing on the other"
I just thought of a campaign ad. We find 4 registered Democrats named Donald Trump. We get them to endorse  on camera. Then we show #45 talking about "Sleepy Joe." Then we say "4 out of 5 Donald Trumps prefer Joe Biden for President!"
Trump sandwiches for everyone
Spoke to someone who said that "Trump will win by a landslide" it's not fun to hear but definitely don't underestimate the situation. We need to actually show up and VOTE!!!
Never hated myself more than just now when I was like ‚Äúoh looks like Donald Trump got a trim. Look at how even his bangs are‚Äù
All of Obama's EOs were met with cries of "overreach" from the GOP Why are they suddenly a good thing when they come from Trump
Yep, it's funny how they claim to hate government involvement with private business but they're fine with Trump's executive order. I don't think that many of them understand the basics of our political system or even the ideological beliefs that they claim to espouse.
Don't leave out That Doctor Donald Jackass Trump said That summer heat would burn the virus away If Trump's ignorance was money It would pay off The national debt

Trump‚Äôs spiritual advisor can suck a fart out of my ass.
WHAT AN ASS. At his "press conf" at his golf club in front of donors, he says he'll sign an EO guaranteeing pre-existing conditions, that "nobody has ever done before" - it's LITERALLY part of Obamacare, &amp; Trump admin is in court TO REMOVE IT. Don't believe a word he says.
My favorite thing about  was them having  Boris Epstein on to say Trump has nothing to do with Russian Jewish gangsters.  That's just priceless.
Like Trump feels guilty.
Yes, Trump has a way to cheat. He has Russia, the GOP and the Postmaster General!  Remember 2016?   Well..2020 is looking the same way to me like it did 4 years ago!  I actually see more Trump signs in my hood now than the last election!  This Democrat of 40 years trusts nothing!
Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right if you say he started it then put a stop to it don‚Äôt continue to do so. We‚Äôre at the point where if you‚Äôre support trump your racist homophobic etc etc, and on the left far too progressive, socialist etc etc but the majority of the country is middle
I‚Äôll preface my question by just saying that I am in no way trying to bait you &amp; I would really like to understand your perspective.  I have two questions;   1) do you think Trump has made life better for the average American? 2) do you think Trump is a competent leader?

He's right and you are wrong. Obamacare mandates that pre-existing conditions are covered. Trump trying to declare it unconstitutional WILL overturn that. Sure, he might support it now -- but it's already in the law.

1/ I keep wondering if because Pompeo knows Trump is going to get back-lash for not bringing it up with Putin, perhaps Pompeo &amp; Trump discussed Pompeo making the call and planned to leak it quite a bit after call was made.  In doing that Trump can save face with his puppet-master

Of course they are! Who didn‚Äôt think they weren‚Äôt.
What a lier. You and the fake whistle blower lied to us because you don‚Äôt like trump! Your a sad man who history will not treat kindly
Trust you?  lol The unemployment rate dropped significantly further under Obama than under Trump pre-virus. Trump simply rode the wave of the Obama recovery. That's a fact if you look at monthly or quarterly data.  No administration in history has been more corrupt than Trump's.
So depressing. The Post Office is being destroyed to help Trump win the election. And it will probably work.
Trump didn‚Äôt draft walker though
Do you really think that no one noticed that that's been law since Obama passed the ACA ten years ago?  Or that Trump and the GOP have tried to repeal it? Repeatedly?  THIS. IS. SHAMELESS.
I imagine China is tired of Trump's incessant lunatic histrionics, whereas Russia just wants to continue the puppet show.
This piece is ridiculous. Both sides nonsense.  The bill failed because Trump and Republicans do not care about ordinary Americans. They only care about themselves, power and hurting people they don‚Äôt like.  Republicans and Trump are fully responsible for all the pain ahead.
unfortunately, YOU are LYING again and, you, along with  &amp;  are #PutinsPuppets with  Colluding w/Putin via Andriy Derkach to smear  VP Biden. U R a DISGRACE.  YES you are #GOPComplicitTraitors the party of tRUMP
Did u even LISTEN to his actual words and what EXACTLY he‚Äôs doing? You‚Äôre kind of embarrassing yourself, oh silly person. From day 1, Trump has been UNFLAPPABLE. Remember,  in the end, History is written by the winners. Presidents get judged by what they DO, not what they think.
That's been law since 2010, and Trump has tried to repeal it several times.  Do you really think that we haven't been paying attention?

Deliberate destruction of the US Postal Service in order to invalidate millions of mail-in ballots in order to cling to power. And Trump will do so with the full backing of DoJ, the Republican Party, their wealthy backers, and a sizable amount of the police.  This could get ugly.

I think you're giving Trump too much credit. Previous presidents created all of the things that Trump is exploiting in office.  Obama had kids in cages. This is just a continuation. Hillary wouldn't have taken Putin at his word. We'd likely be at war with Russia.
I think the same could be said for Trump
So obvious that Trump can‚Äôt do anything about it? Give up on your false Messiah

HUGE NEWS -- NOT!  #FakeNews #LiarInChief   How many tweets from Trump staffers and sycophants are out there talking about this non-news? They're all over. Shut up you goddamn liars! We already have coverage for pre-existing conditions thanks to the #ACA . We're not stupid!

Of course not. Trump is (news flash and spoiler alert) lying.

Had DACA been properly challenged immediately after it was announced, an injunction would've probably been granted. Similarly, had trump followed proper procedures, he could have swiftly reversed it with no real challenges. However, neither of those happened.

If Trump wins it's 100% the fault of    and  !  NEVER IN MY 60 YEARS OF LIFE HAVE I WATCHED A PRESIDENT LITERALLY WORK AGAINST AMERICA AND THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERS OF MY PARTY TOOK A BACK SEAT IN FEAR AND ALLOWED IT!  SHAME!
You would think the very stable genius would have more ideas to help people suffering financially than a payroll tax cut... since people who have lost their jobs and have no pay won't benefit at all  I mean Trump's a money guy...  #TrumpCrimeFamily
Exactly. Apparently, ‚ÄúTrump rocks‚Äù.
This is great  via
Don't use the word we because u hate Donald Trump so it's just u and don't include us with u. Let  Trump do whatever he wants. U are not the President and u will never be.
Yeah, those are already covered. trump's trying to rescind the law that covers them (ie, ObamaCare) - remember?
Aren't you glad he stopped those flights and put those walls up at the borders or it would have been 10 times more deaths.  Great call Trump!!!  What a great president we Have! Thank you Jayson for bring this to everyones attention! One more reason to vote TRUMP 2020!!!
comment section is interesting tonight. Not even breitbarters can contain their excitement when senile daddy trump wants to hand out ‚Äòfree money‚Äô.
and congratulations to #trump for another 1,200,000 people filing for unemployment this past week! #TrumpFailsAmerica
I‚Äôm here now. The good news is there‚Äôs more Biden signs than Trump signs. But some ppl are racist and ignorant af up here. Sad truth. He‚Äôs unfit in more ways than one.
You forgot allowing Trump to be president again for another four years. You think that‚Äôs a better option?
Trump is now taking credit for Obama care
Are you kidding with the things they are using to say Trump is racist and you think this is slighting Biden because they only took a six second clip?
She‚Äôs probably gonna lose it, Trump maybe, same with schweikert
Y‚Äôall rather not vote, and let Trump be president again??? Like where are you going with this?
Curious how Trump can produce a healthcare plan without legislation instead of just an EO?
I mean trump speaks of him lovingly and he sat in the oval with a maga hat on. I‚Äôm not sure how many would be Biden voters he‚Äôs going to siphon off
WOW. If Trump said that they would be screaming RACIST!
When someone said "we survived Obama, you'll survive Trump" I didn't really expect it to be this actively wrong
My liberal dad often sends the family links to articles, mostly anti trump opinion pieces, but every now and then he sends a jennifer rubin column and I have to pop off in the email thread
The person making that call is consciously deciding to let those people suffer and many of them die to make a point--and some have admitted as much, although most just circle back to the pointless "we can't wait," though clearly we will be waiting if Trump is reelected. 2/2
I agree with that. But, digging in your heels because "we can't wait for M4A," for instance, makes no sense if your goals are honorable. We're not getting M4A with Trump. What we will get is 10s of millions currently covered by ACA left with no access to health care. 1/2
All I know is this.   if you don‚Äôt pick Kamala, you don‚Äôt get my money.  You don‚Äôt get my time.  You will get my vote cause Trump is a freaking nutcase. But that is all that you get.
Thank you President trump!
tRump could have saved us all a lot of time and just renamed Obamacare (and everything else Obama did) and kept everything the same.
Trump's wallet experienced a rebirth in #russia.  #AllRoadsLeadToPutin #FollowTheMoney
If you think Hillary was a bad candidate, Biden is worse--except that he catches Trump in a vulnerable moment.
It gets worse. I live in Pennsylvania where Trump is suing so you can't bring your mail-in ballots to drop boxes.
...  literally schooled your ass in how Obama ran the economy objectively better than Trump has.   But I guess the stupid are used to laughing at logic and facts so...
Trump IS America‚Äôs enemy. He just left the door unlocked.
So yes, actually feel free to go through the timeline, I tweet about how bad Obama/Biden and Hillary all are as well. My question here after I said I agreed with a lot of the good things,was, to be fair, are we going to get a rundown of things Trump has gotten wrong?
This thread was more helpful than you realize and in ways not even about trump. Thank you for that.
shame on you for allowing your husband to be a puppet in Trump‚Äôs blatant use of Kanye to fraud this election by having voters choose Kanye over Biden. Shame shame.
Oppo during the VP process is a good thing. Hiding and ignoring possible problems only hurts Biden.  You really seem to not understand what is at stake and what Team Trump would do with that oppo if it had remained hidden to protect people‚Äôs feelings.  Also, loyalty is overrated.
Promises made, promises kept...oh wait.
Trump tried to take credit for Obama's economy and now he's trying to take credit for #Obamacare coverage of Preexisting conditions.  The dude is demented. #VoteBlue2020
Biden got Trump so psyched that Trump thinks Biden can beat God. Biden's work is done here.
Or, ‚ÄúHow dare you criticize this military guy who supports Donald Trump ‚Ä¶ who hasn‚Äôt done anything about Russian bounties on American troops.‚Äù
Trump has actually ramped up the bombings. He‚Äôs attempted coups in Venezuela and Syria, bombed the Iranian General who took down ISIS, done a coup in Bolivia... why does it always go back to Obama/Biden? I‚Äôm not defending them either.

You're right. Trump landslide in November. I can't believe I was actually worried that Biden would somehow beat Trump.
Didnt he outright lie that Twitter treats Trump's account just like any other user? A random Twitter account would be suspended for posting half the stuff that Trump does.
Right, GOP goes the way of the imploding GDP while the $2.3 Trillion Trump WealthFare Tax cut remains untouched

There using covid-19 to get Trump out of office!
If you don't recognize the person posting it, just ask yourself why they're saying awful shit that divides a mostly-united front against Trump.
They say absolute power corrupts absolutely.  In Trumps case, he was raised to be corrupt and then given the most powerful authority ever bestowed on a human being.  Putin will go for broke with helping Trump because it would be the Coup de Gr√¢ce of our great experiment.
GOP hasn't turned it's back, Senators Johnson and Grassley are welcoming it to the point they are using it in their phoney investigations to discredit Biden.  Just when you thought the treason was only Trump and his minions you realize it's the whole Republican party.
nah, Donald Trump read it wrong, ha
Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt see how this is part of the problem? The media played you. Biden has more blood and his hands than Trump, and a far more effective history of racism. So tell me why we should reward his racism with a reason besides ‚ÄòTrump Bad‚Äô
Thank you,  for calling  Trump‚Äôs so-called press conference what it was‚Äîa campaign rally. Great show, as usual. Cheers.
Presidents always have justification for their usurption of power but pretending like Trump originated this is not honest.

There is a passive/aggressive element to McConnell for sure. This going to be a slog to get through November 3. When Trump, wins &amp; I think he will, the gloves will come off. Trump is a fighter &amp; plays a longer game. He will have more support. McConnell will be a speed bump

So basically, Donald Trump wants to own the internet and have the say of what can and cannot be on it. #CleanNetwork
is not my first choice for president. But Trump is killing thousands of Americans along with our democracy and must go. Despite being Mr. MBNA, Biden is a suitable bridge to 2024. He will be able to repair some of the damage wrought by this administration.

I don‚Äôt think Trump really cares if we vote by mail. What he is doing is setting the stage for claiming that many of the mail in votes are fraudulent. Then when he loses, he can say he warned us and that the election was corrupted and therefore not legal.
Consider his fudging around electoral college(EC)/popular vote(PV) splits.  In 2000, the 13 points picked Gore, so it was supposed to be a PV model.  In 2016, it picked Trump, who lost the PV but won the EC, so now it's a model of who will win at least one of PV and EC.

Trump is not worthy of anyone‚Äôs vote. Black, white, yellow or red. We all need to vote out Trump.
He‚Äôs a life long practicing Christian and he just brought in a far right Christian... wtf are you talking about? Trump is the most anti Judie Christian politician in modern USA history. Outside of 6 atheists we had including (Washington, Jefferson)
Trump lies about everything
But who put Donald Trump in power? The source lies with the disintegration of now dystopian republican politics.
Even the most left leaning polls say that Trump has 25% of the black vote. Biden is making the same mistake Clinton made 4 yrs ago. He's alienating voters faster than Trump is.
Why is a vote for a 3rd party a vote for Trump?

Trump Wants To Postpone The Election, But Americans Really Don‚Äôt
He can't tell you his real priorities-- five terms, trump TV channel, trump tower in Moscow--because you can't handel the truth
If he can get to that 270 fuck what the ballots say. I'd love to throw that in trump's face.
Trump is the one person that has never made one single mistake in his whole life !
If lying and selfish behavior are ways to hurt God, trump wins
Trump thought he could stimulate the economy by pouring in massive amounts of borrowed money and keeping interest rates very low. Then the virus hit and in poured trillions into the market, but one people needed one month's rent, the republicans suddenly remember the debt
I know all about the past, believe me. But what‚Äôs diff now is that he is rectifying those mistakes by having comprehensive plans for POC. Trump, on the other hand, has a history of overt racism that is carried into his presidency, with no evidence that it will change.
And Trump's not a mess?
If Trump did pray, in his mind, would he not be talking to himself?
Yep. The same Americans also believe windmills cause cancer and Trump is a smart man. They‚Äôre in a cult. Hopefully they can snap out of it come November.
And the world of science which may be above the thought level of Trump and just maybe his supporters!
I think it‚Äôs a good idea for him to go give trump and Mikey a big wet juicy kiss !!
There is no way Trump will lose, the democrats having given Trump supporters the will to make sure that happens, thank you!
Do you have any thoughts of your own? Do you just scam for scum.. Dynasty..  King Trump. Smartass bitch.
If President Trump called in to Fake News MSNBC or CNN,would they refuse to put him on live?I would call them on every single lie on their airtime Mr. President!Sick of these liars lying every single day!Wish there was legislation that could force them to tell the truth!STOP Lies
Not sure what coulution is. If you mean collusion, yes, there are many examples. Every time Trump says there isn‚Äôt you know there must be.

The cult of Trump
Well I guess supporting Trump a president who cannot read or pronounce words correctly, ‚Äúacing‚Äù his cognitive tests And astounding all the doctors with his cognitive capabilities, thinks Covid is going to magically disappear etc. is a better fit for this country?
I hope he will be forced to debate Trump. All his excuses sound stupid.
This is the price we pay for the electoral college electing Trump.
He passed along the costs to the tax payers. Trump says other countries pay the tariffs. He is outright lying. We just pay higher prices.
Trump doesn‚Äôt want any immigrants. Why doesn‚Äôt this guy know that Trump is going to try and ship him back to his country of origin?
Nice picture. Do you really believe there was a global effort to get Trump and McCain was part of it?
The intelligence agencies may have been little too aggressive in investigating the Russian angle, but there is no proof yet that they targetted Trump without reason. Almost 4 years of Trump/Barr investigation has proven nothing except procedural errors
Russian meddling in our election is proven fact. Even republican senate confirmed it. Trump appointed intelligence officers have confirmed the same. It is also proven that some within Trump orbit were talking to Russians. Was there a collusion/conspiracy? I don‚Äôt know. /1
My nephew and his gurlfriend moved to Texas from Shit Seattle and they are voting blue.... pisses me off. Because they hate Seattle cause its dirty but blame Trump. Indoctrination!

Which cabinat post did trump promise West, so he would do this ?
How many hours investigation on Benghazi, and how many hours on the soldiers ambushed in Niger, right after trump put Chad on the no fly list and they pulled out all of their highly experienced anti-terrorist fighters from Niger
Donald Trump can't win an election facing Biden head to head.  He needed Jill Stein in 2016 and Krazy Kanye now.  Plus all the Russian help then and now.
If it's a wave election, Trump wins KY by 10.
Nope. False. If Trump wins, everybody loses except his supporters. If Biden wins, not everybody automatically wins, but at least people of color like me have a shot.
Trump says he‚Äôs doing a fantastic job

Not that I usually ever watch TV during the day, but I've seen her defending trump more than once. Not that I knock anybody that said they were voting for Biden now

He's thinking better than Trump!
Trump is the face of evil and the voice of hatred
When Republicans do something to denounce Trump while he is still in power and actually do something about holding him responsible for his actions. Your dumb support for the GOP is disgusting.
I think the same.  President Trump is not a quitter. And he is now the most powerful person in the world, with a great chance for the reelection.
i just saw my first trump flag in schaumburg i-
Any other POTUS would have better utilized this act. Trump completely mismanaged it.
Does Trump mean the kind of patriotism where you serve your country in the military? That‚Äôs not Trump. He is a coward draft dodger.
Until March Trump has been kissing China‚Äôs ass. The only reason he turned against them is the virus Trump completely mismanaged.
Why did doctors want Trump to take cognitive test?? What is he hiding??
Trump really has a way of making Biden sound like he's a way better candidate than he actually is
He could be a Satanist, I would still vote against Trump
Joe Biden is like... A hundred times more racist than Donald Trump. And he keeps showing it.
Trump in 4
Trump spent 3 1/2 years pouring massive amounts of borrowed money into the economy and like Bush W in his reelection campaign, has kept interest rates very low. Then when the virus hit, they poured trillions into the market
Remember when everybody at the United Nation laughed at trump when he claimed to have accomplished so much. The only reason people aren't laughing now is because they are aghast at trump's incompetence and body count
Well there would be Trump
The dems are for one thing and they will destroy the country because you people are so stuborn. Give it up, you make people more pro-Trump and therefore Trump will win in November, thank you!
President Biden will be your President too. He will do much more for you than Trump but you won‚Äôt admit it. Just sit back and enjoy.
Another way to interpret Trump's response is that he believes Biden to have monumental power beyond the comprehension of mere mortals.
Trump lies all the time
Trump has lost his stones. His true wussy colors are popping through. Just like the draft dodging coward he is.
NRA was using funds the wrong way, jets and vacations  Trump is an idiot
Who‚Äôs not all there? Trump is not all there. That‚Äôs why he was forced to take a mental test. Someone must have been giving him the answers in order for this loon to pass it.
My thoughts are crystal clear. Trump is a draft dodging coward who has told more lies than the last 4 in aggregate. He is responsible for 150,000 lost lives, the worst deficit in history and the just reported worst quarter in history.
That isn't what he said but go off. You know what trump did say tho? Yo, semites.
Susan Rice ideally but Kamala is my second choice. In an ideal world where I could pick just to piss off trump? Barack or Michelle.
Illinois. Unfortunately we don‚Äôt have a chance here. But I still will vote for Trump and will ask all the honest people that I know to do the same.
The Trump administration investigation into the Clinton foundation found no wrong doing. No evidence supports your claim.
So what do you want to do, burn the state?  At least President Trump can find Ohio.  Where's O'biden?  Obama speaks for Biden, Jill speaks for Biden, but Biden never speaks?  Takes no candid questions, only responds to specific journalists, when he knows the question &amp; answer.

They just said on the news that Trump is a ‚Äúworking class‚Äù president.  If you believe that, you are blind.
When Trump was ahead in the polls he planned to skip the debates. Now that he is losing so badly he wants them. Too bad for Trump.
Left constantly referring to President Trump as dictator or Nazi?  Who is actually hiding the truth?  President Trump is out there every day, answering questions from MSM.  When Democrats have something to answer for, MSM goes dark.  Must have loyal MSM for totalitarian Gov?

I don‚Äôt think Trump really cares if we vote by mail. What he is doing is setting the stage for claiming that many of the mail in votes are fraudulent. Then when he loses, he can say he warned us and that the election was corrupted and therefore not legal.
jan. is a long time to wait without a national testing &amp; tracking system. How many more people have to die before trump admits he make the same mistake China did, what any autocratic government does: deny. Yet, unlike the Chinese that went on for weeks, trump is going for months
Trump has screwed more allies than anyone in history. He has also made the office he serves a laughingstock the world over.
The grossly incompetent one is Trump. We have never had a POTUS as incompetent as Trump.
Consider his fudging around electoral college(EC)/popular vote(PV) splits.  In 2000, the 13 points picked Gore, so it was supposed to be a PV model.  In 2016, it picked Trump, who lost the PV but won the EC, so now it's a model of who will win at least one of PV and EC.

The FBI had fisa warrants on carter page before he was hired by the trump administration. Because was an unregistered Russian agent.
This is what happens when you put an idiot in charge of the well being and security of a nation. Trump wanted HCQ, the govt had to buy it to soothe his ego and now they are going to promote it, damn the scientist And if 100s of thousand americans die, thats just an inconvenience
China felt the same way. They didn‚Äôt want their scientists speaking directly to the media. So they censored their communications. Just like the Trump administration is doing it.
This list is false. Love Thy Neighbor! #WWJD (Hint, He wouldn‚Äôt vote for Trump.)
Nope. Nobody outside of committed trump base voters belive it.
Trump is mentally comprised. Totally unfit for office. 160,000 dead Americans is evidence of that
Bingo, the trump administration makes them authorize their communications with the political arm of the White House. Hence they don‚Äôt communicate directly anymore.
Belated thought... Did Trump also think this cartoon character's name was Yo-Semite Sam?
Let's hope she is going to have stuff to charge Trump and his organization.  I would like nothing better than to be able to say Ex-President Trump earlier than Nov 3rd.

The only revenge I care about is seeing Trump and his corrupt family of grifters face justice inside a courtroom for a lifelong crime spree, which includes crimes committed from the oval office.
FISA warrants were all proven warranted. No crimes. Just Trump lies.
Yea, sure. I won‚Äôt believe it till I see prices actually come down. It is a proven FACT, TRUMP LIES more than any other POTUS in history.
As a friend of mine stated, Trump's dissonance between his lack of intelligence and high level of confidence in that Axios interview is unbelievable
As a vet myself these are exactly my feelings. I will NOT be VOTING for TRUMP THE DRAFT DODGING COWARD.

Things that come to mind: they're pro-life, anti-vaccine, pro-home schooling, anti-public schooling, don't believe in science-only biblical depictions. Of course, all of these are totally contradictory to Trump's lifestyle/rhetoric; the one who's disobeyed all 10 Commandments.

You‚Äôd think someone (trump) who‚Äôs been accused by Democrats of sexual assault 28 times would be locked up by now and have tons of evidence against him. Especially knowing media is in favor of the left.
Look, there are no facts that trump has sexually assaulted, trafficked, raped... ect. Women, they are all accusations, most of them have been settled, which means not enough evidence to provide guilty
how much of the 3 has gone to those who never needed it, how much to Trump "friends and relations"
Why would trump try to expose a sex trafficking ring if he was involved with it. Just think about that. I go by facts, not accusations.
Ruined foreign relations? How? Because trumped placed travel bans on countries that Obama bombed the fuck out of ? Obama dropped over 26,000 bombs on the Middle East. And everyone still loves him üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è if trump did that , it‚Äôs the end of the world.

Report: Twitter bans Trump campaign from tweeting over COVID misinformation
"Michael" has had an identity crises since his college days.  I am sure that has led to many ups and downs with depression over the years.  Long before President Trump was in office.
President Donald Trump is still trying to overturn "Obamacare," but his predecessor's health care law keeps gaining ground in places where it was once unwelcome.
Kanye West is not stable enough to be president, trump is using Kanye to try and steal enough black votes from Biden so trump will win. 3 months before an election Kanye decides to jump in. How can that be because trump is the republican runner up. This is an Illegal Set Up.
If Kanye really wanted to seriously run for President he would of had to go against trump to see which one got the nomination. Kanye is only out to take black votes from Biden so trump would win That's how they are thinking. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Since Kanye decided to jump in the Presidential Race 3 months before Voting on Nov 3rd this is why trump is complaining about Mail In Voting. It sounds like trump &amp; west have a thing going on West wants to take black votes from Biden so Biden won't win
So the republicans just want Kanye so he can take black votes from Biden. If Kanye West really wanted to run for President he would of been in the race from the beginning, this is just a set up between trump and kanye to do just that.
Biden Says He Will End Trump‚Äôs Tariffs On Chinese-Made Goods
For lack of any actual data, my personal anecdata is that I know two people who have expressed a desire to vote for Kanye West.  Their preferred candidate is Trump but are misinformed and believe they can't vote because they are felons.  I did not challenge this belief.

The world will celebrate when Trump is defeated on November 3.  The world will cheer when the SDNY finally pays Trump back for his decades of douchebaggery.  And the world will cheer when Trump finally dies from whatever obesity-related illness he succumbs to.
Trump will next be taking credit for...air.
No, I sure as hell wouldn't let you blow me, away or anywhere else. My standards are much higher. Try Trump, although I suspect you aren't his type either.
You‚Äôve still got many followers.  You‚Äôre so photogenic.  I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre a Trump supporter

After the divisive antics of Obama and company, people have a lot of balls calling Trump divisive. Boston beer summit, Ferguson, Baltimore, Tea Partiers, God, guns and religion and many, many, more examples. Left is about holding people down, right is about giving then a hand up.

You support Trump running with dementia.  Looks like your pic was taken on one of those worse days!  Try again.  And I'll be muting you.  There's enough ugliness on Twitter without seeing you again.
These jobs were not added, they are simply being filled with people who have been unemployed during the Trump virus. Also, there are still about 15 million unemployed, unemployment is still over  10% and this is far less jobs that were recovered in June. Not good.
My retirement fund has more than doubled since Trump took office.  It was basically flat when you were in charge.  I don‚Äôt want to go back to your ways. Judging from these tweets , most people agree with me.  I‚Äôm voting Trump
I love you guys &amp; I was a Bernie supporter &amp; I dislike Trump but this episode was #TrumpDerangementSyndrome. Not the #LiberalValues advocacy I've come to expect. The second guest couldn't even fathom that he might win legitimately. I guess they can't all be on point.
My sister is driving thru Maine right now &amp; she said just about every house has a Trump sign on their front lawn. 4 more years I say!!!
As is the Devil! His name is Trump!
Dementia Donald? Don the Con? Trump the Chump? Hope you and Donald get the help you both need. Don's will come with incarceration.
Good. They need to get the necessary basics passed. Let Trump put the EO out. Then they may get their act together.

Do you think tRUMP realizes the reason Russian and China want him to win is he is a bought and paid for idiot that can easily be controlled?
How would Trump know they let him unless he knows... because he had experience grabbing?!!! Your making excuses for someone who bragged about sexual assaults!
Debating tRUMP is a joke. Here's how that will go tRUMP: a bunch of bullshit and lies Biden: thats false and a bunch of lies. And so on and so on.

Trump said he never met her so she's a liar. She sued him for defamation 9 months ago. All she has to prove is that Trump does infact know her. That would prove, in court, that Trump lied.
LOL  Trolling for Trump with the name "Boris" written in Cyrillic! Priceless.
And your a trump supporter.  LOL
Only if you assume it's cus they are black. Did trump say that? Or are you assuming. There are a lot of shithole countries not because of the people but because of their govt and it's laws. China take for instance.

No way. Isn‚Äôt this the same guy that gave Trump a 91% chance at re-election?
Anyone who tries to defend Trump ain‚Äôt doing him any good
The biggest political crime and scandal in American history was you being "elected" with assistance from our political adversaries.  In 100 years the word "trump" will STILL be synonymous with corruption. But don't worry, Donnie, it'll still mean fart in England.

I think this is admiral trying to look into this issue at this time. However we have to live in the real world. trump has got us all hostages. Can we use Fed Ex or some other company that trump does not have his grubby fingers in?
I suspect BS because who pays an extra $13k for incorrect hosp. charges? Besides, didn't Trump PROMISE health insurance for everybody?
I‚Äôm afraid I disagree...the Republican Congress and Governors currently are behaving in the same way as Trump and your father was the only one with enough spine to disagree. So while I never say never......this is as close as I‚Äôll get. I‚Äôm a former independent who voted GOP often
The GOP is all over Twitter today. Think they might have a feeling they are all about to be out of jobs very soon. In some cases wearing orange jumpsuits. The writing is on the wall and for those of us that can read know your time is up. For those that can't read vote tRUMP.
Trump is nuts.

Trump needs to resign and not be elected again. We need a new President. Let's elect a new President in November.
The EO will be challenged in court and trump will never deliver his healthcare plan he's promised for 3.5 yrs
Up, perhaps because his COVID-19 response is such a disaster that 160k Americans have died and the economy collapsed.  By the way, Trump tells child sex traffickers he wishes them well
Maybe people hate Trump because of his COVID-19 response disaster. 160k Americans dead and economic collapse
Trump has been president for 3.5 yrs. What did Trump do to affect prices?
I‚Äôll ask it again.. Did anybody who voted for Trump bother to vet him in any way before casting a ballot. In other words didn‚Äôt bother to have any idea that everything he touched in the private sector turned to shit.. and lied about everything? Just wondering?

Oh I think 45 just made a mistake here. Joe Biden is a REAL Catholic. Trump may have just alienated more than a few voters.
I have decided that Covid restrictions were all designed to keep Biden away from the public as much as possible.  When restrictions started to ease, Trump did a couple speeches. Biden, I don't think, can stand up to scrutiny,  so we're all back in jail. üôÑ
Hint: tRump thinks that he is God...
Trump attacks Biden's Catholic faith: 'He is against the Bible'
So we have no way of knowing how many millions or even billions of dollars Trump owes to Russia. That kind of knowledge could seriously jeopardize his presidency and even possibly his freedom. It seems like information like this would be important to know before an election.
Not any more. It's been the Trump Virus for awhile.

Normally during debates each candidate gets a general topic list so they have an idea  of what to prepare. Just ask Biden &amp; Trump to recite their favorite passage and say where its from. Trump would fail even with prep work

so I get this right, let me recap. Russia has turned to Chuck Grassley with info to help Trump. What happened to you? I guess Russian money. You both need to go!!!!!!!
Trump dismantled pandemic team. That put us way behind recovery. It could be debated if deaths could have been prevented but certainly diminished.
WTF is Trump talking about?   Pre-existing conditions are already covered by Obamacare. It doesn't make sense that he would destroy the ACA, which covers pre-existing conditions, in order to sign an EO guaranteeing coverage for pre-existing conditions.
President Trump said he's not worried about the legality of the executive order.
President Trump announces he's working on an executive order that will require health insurances companies to cover all pre-existing conditions for all customers. He said it could be coming as soon as two weeks from now.
I honestly feel like both sides are taking it down to the wire in a dumb game of political chicken. When passed, the extra $$ will be retroactive. If not, our only other hope is to rely on a Trump executive order.

Regardless of how ludicrous the smear, it needs to be pointed out that by repeating it, you‚Äôre just furthering the smear and doing Trump‚Äôs propaganda work for him.
Simple question to ask your MAGA friends.   Why does Trump always take the side of criminals?  Examples: -NRA -Ghislaine Maxwell  -Epstein -The people he has pardoned -Putin  They should be able to answer this simple question without blabbing about QAnon conspiracies or Fox News.
Yes and he keeps shuffling through the papers, trying to find one that proves his point. Maybe Trump should go back to school when they open. Then he can test if it's safe!

Trump is telling lies, I know because his lips are moving!!!!!
Just the beginning of his excuse not to debate Trump!!!
Trump is gonna win because of the moronic shit that the left is encouraging and doing. You could've won but they pushed you out too and you still, after all this back them. That says alot about your character now too. I rode with you 100% until you decided to go to the dark side
And I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong I don‚Äôt agree with everything trump has done. I‚Äôm just saying the journalist was being ridiculous.
Can someone teach Trump how to pronounce YOSEMITE?  It's really sad for the POTUS to make mistakes like that on national television.  His ignorance is becoming more obvious day by day.
As an interviewer he could actually ask a question and wait for an answer instead of making his own assumptions mid interview out loud hoping to get trump to say a condemning sentence. That‚Äôd be professional journalism.
Bob, its a robot, stop trying to act cool on the internet, and take care of your kids

You might be a little wrong on that. It‚Äôs Trump.
Yep my thoughts exactly  #COVID19  Trump's Axios interview blasted by late-night comics
A debate would just be Trump calling people names and declaring that he has a big dick and it works just fine.‚ÄùFolks, I don‚Äôt have any problems in that department. Trust me‚Äù. Then he might make fun of a couple of handicapped people.
Because him running is gonna draw people that would otherwise Vote for biden not Trump supporters

My bad. NYAG, not SDNY.  Ms. James is the New York AG rather than US Attorney, and therefore far out of Trump's reach.
No, don‚Äôt vote for Kanye.  Voting for Kanye is exactly what Trump wants you to do, as it takes votes away from Biden.
You‚Äôre correct in respect to NY, but not in other states. I understand in NY, IL, CA it won‚Äôt matter, but if you are bashing Trump and you get your one chance to vote against him and don‚Äôt it does say something about you.   IMO

Donald Trump's lack of mental ability is a campaign issue that can't be ignored.
Even if the Hatch Act did not apply to the President or VP I think that we can all agree during this time it is not a good move on Trump's decision to hold it there or even think of holding it there. Yet it is getting him attention and controversy which he thrives on! SHAMEFUL!
Trump said he was going to drain the swamp.  He let go a lot of people who worked under Obama, which is usual practice. Then trump brought in his own people to replace the swamp dwellers. Turns out they were much worse than anyone he called ‚Äú swamp dwellers‚Äù.  Typical trump
I am looking into early voting also. My dad voted for tRump on 2016 he is voting Biden but still is afraid of mail in voting. He has always voted at the polls (some things I can't changeüôÑ) so my friend and I thought of early voting make a day of it lunch ect...think it will fly
I think the Trump failure and GOP failure have  made the VIRUS as a opportunity to restructure American Life and in a way that is SHAMEFUL. People are out of work people are dying needlessly. I think majority of Americans would put this comment back to the Republicans.

I think if we examine the evidence carefully, we will discover that Trump was born at his wit's end and has been there ever since.
I have voted Republican since I was 18. Alot had to do with how I was raised. I could not vote for Trump in 2016 my conscience would not let me looked like a con smelled like a con. 4 years later I do not think I will ever return to the Republican Party failure all the way around
You might also note that Trump took steps to remove the provision that military born children were not necessarily citizens in 2019. Implying pretty strongly that prior to this they were. The Supremes have previously refused to take up the issue as a

Stop with the excuses. Trump had control of both houses of government until 2018. He didn‚Äôt need Democratic approval. He could‚Äôve pushed through whatever he wanted. Truth is the Reps couldn‚Äôt agree on health care. They failed themselves. And nothing is coming. Too late now.

A reporter asked President Trump why his guest weren't social distancing.... His response was epic " Its ok. Its a peaceful protest" lol
has rarely traveled outside this country. His Daddy paid U of Penn $10Million to take his spawn &amp; graduate him. He has never been a billionaire. He is a failure at everything he has ever done it's his brother Bob who really ran the Trump Organization. #Hypocrite
Anyone in NYC Business will tell you if not for Robert Trump, his kid brother,  would lucky to be a used car salesman.
dad : *tells me Trump is a great president with no supporting info, repeating he‚Äôs great and he‚Äôs gonna save us*   me : *explains my disagreement with facts, referencing to both spoken and written public infortmation*  dad : *ending call* whatever you do, stay woke son‚Äù üôÑ
Enhanced benefits come from federal. Apparently Trump is trying to put an executive order to keep the $600 until end of year. Dems said no because they want a one trillion dollar bailout to dem states.
Trump is a fraud he got into Wharton by having somebody else take his entrance exam. He is noted as the most stupid kid ever at that school.
If you allow trump to touch are social security you too will be looking for a job. No more nice guys in our party play to win.
This old had needs to more on with her useless life. Dr Fauci and Dr Birx make trump look like a 2yr old stupid for his toddler age. This man you love is a JUNKIE he snorts Adderall, cocaine, and meth daily yet you love him. Maybe your too are a junkie.
I do believe its time to Boycott  MSNBC wants to attack Nancy Pelosi it's time this woman looks for a new job with trump and putin. Get out of America Traitor.
I think a large plot is being looked at for Trump Town. There, his followers with CV19 will meet and wait for Trump to channel his connection to God and cure them all.
Indefinite damage. From here on, all upcoming elections the GOP will be voted out. Idea, when Trump opens his Trump Town the senior GOP leaders can go with him to help govern.
Your right no president has ever allowed 181,000 Americans to die from a virus. Loser trump allowed 181KDeadAmericans while he golfed. Trump is a common criminal lock this fraud up now.
#TrumpGolfsAmericansDie This is not a lawful president this is an ILLEgally elected president by Putin. Trump is in a legal POTUS he is nothing but a criminal.
You were never a real president trump you were not legally elected. You in fact are a lie and a fraud placed in the White House by Vlad Putin your Boss. You were never legally elected. You lost the election by more than 3 million votes. You are a fraud-criminal and TreasonTraitor

Any politician that allows trump to touch our Social Security is a dead politician. He/She will never get reelected ever again. Trump is stealing our Social Security for himself and his criminal kids. The Gop are all committing suicide let them die.

Trump loses 12.9 Million American jobs intentionally. Make no mistake trump is intentionally killing America because Putins wants him to kill America.
Putin want the GOP to give him America for forgiveness of trump loans. I don't care about trump or his illegal money from Putin. Still we now must finish killing our economy its the only thing the rich criminals understand. We can kill the Banks, housing market, retail, farms.
We The People are done with the GOP and Putins loves affair. We are going to have to finish off the economy. We the people are already dead money wise because of trump now it's time we kill the economy intentionally just the way the GOP is killing America.
Kudlow is just another trump criminal given a job to steal money for trump.
The entire Schlapp family are criminal. They are trump donors so they are in fact criminal.
Trump has been begging them for months now.
Andrey Derkach is a liar that is an actual Russian not an American. Trump has Putin and China in our election this year. Trump must go now now in November today lock the criminal up already. Do not wait for our country to be lost to putin forever.
Executive orders means trump and the entire GOP are now stealing more of our money for putin, trump and the gop members themselves. Especially moscow mitch communist from Ky. Kick mitch mcconnell out of America he is a communist traitor and needs to be in prison or evicted.
trump will get out of bed with the Saudis. These are the criminals that bombed new york 9/11. Trump is a traitor never trust he with our freedom. Trump wants to kill our freedom that is his job according to Russian media.
This is a russian account trying to make President Biden look bad. Block these criminals they don't belong in American politics no matter what loser trump wants. Trump can't win on his own OANN is a russian operation.
Face Falwell, Jr. has been fired because he lies constantly about how God loves trump. Falwell, Jr needs to repay all the tax money he didn't pay because he is a fraud. No religious tax free life for the fraud ever again.
Trump intentionally killed our economy because Putin ordered trump to do so. Putin owns trump he lent trump money through the russian bank in New York now trump can't repay it unless he steals more American money for the virus and gives it all to putin. #TrumpIsTheHoax

Hilarious to see liberals offended by Trump saying anything about God when they themselves mock God by backing abortion.
Would it be hilarious to see KW with votes that were taken from Trump. 'BIDEN WINS. TRUMP AND YEEZ SPLIT GOP VOTES.' DISGUSTED TRUMP SUPPORTERS...VOTE WEST.
I‚Äôm honestly really interested to see what happens to the Trump supporters once he ain‚Äôt president cause they be treating it like it‚Äôs their only personality trait
If you think Trump has outsmarted all of them, then you're in for a surprise when Biden does beat him.  You've no clue how Hillary, Barack, Nancy, &amp; Chuck just took Donald to the woodshed.
Awful example as they mandated draconian tracking to cell phone data.  Better is Sweden / Netherlands.  We did similar to Germany, now Germany is spiking again.  We flattened curve, problem was "leaders" wanted lock down until Trump lost, that is what screwed this up
Is Trump‚Äôs attack on Biden anti-Catholic rhetoric? We‚Äôll be fine. Kennedy was good.
If Trump doesn‚Äôt get re-elected, it leaves the Johnson Government very isolated. Without their Libertarian allies in power in the US, they will be left without their ‚Äúsell the UK for some shiny beads‚Äù trade deal.
If I owned a golf course I'd be there as often as possible and for Trump it's possible.
Another interpretation by Trump Trump = God. The God that is worshipped is not Trump aka Jim Jones.
Thailand Trump's- Thigh land.  Heard at Whirlpool rally.
I have to disagree. That‚Äôs a surface level reading. The hatred of Obama was totally irrational and based on literal fictions. The animus toward Trump is something we can articulate without making up fake conspiracies. The left doesn‚Äôt hate Trump like the right hated Obama

Trump‚Äôs America. Only the wealthy can get vaccinated.
I'm thinking Trump gets 15% of the black vote 50% Latino and 75% Asian. I type this based on my experience over these last few months. Black vote might be even higher
LMAO.... He is already so far up Trump's ass, I think pool boy is perfect. Pence, Trump, and Putin call all have their pee pee parties...
VP Biden, I am a Vet, spent 20yrs in the US Army, I am very glad I am glad you running and no how the Military needs a good Commander and Chief. Trump has no idea how to run the Military. We need to get them codes out of Trumps hands. I got your back Joe. üòÄ
Wait so i need clarification, did trump just ban damn near half of the gaming industry....
trump is lying once again. He did not do anything to fix the water problem anywhere. He is to stupid to know how to fix anything. Born stupid he will die stupid.
Since no GOP that is alive did anything to stop Trump from breaking the law after law after law. #RIPGOPForever
This is trump telling us he is going to kill Social Security. Nothing like watching a man commit suicide in plain site.
No he didn't do anything to stop the virus no missteps because he did ZERO-NOTHING-TRUMP IS WORTHLESS #TrumpKillsUSTroops #TrumpKillsSeniors
This man Jason Miller is a trump/putin licker. He hates America and loves Russia. Vote Joe Biden to Save America from Putin. Biden will destroy Putin, Saudis, N. Korea, and every other fascist, dictator in any country. Jason Miller go live in Russia where you belong.
You either vote for Biden or Putin. Trump works for Putin dumb ass.
Trump lying again trying to steal another Obama accomplishment.
He has nothing to run for president on. He crashed our economy we are now in a depression worse than ever before, he lost all our Allies they do not trust him, he committed TREASON, Allows Putin to kill our Veterans. Trump killed America he must pay for the rest of his life.
They no longer produce their own products in America is whole story is a trump lie.
Yes it's illegal has hell. It's called creative financing in the banking world this is what brought down all our banks when Bush was president. Trump is the cause of the 2021 Greatest Depression Ever.
You lying SOB Biden is a devout Catholic. Trump is an atheist he is now and has always been nothing but an atheist. Trump believes he is God and believes in nothing else.
trumps kids are just like trump. The do not love trump they love the money he steals.
Yeah well it kind of is you maroon. Did you not see what Joe said today? Also he gave a eulogy to a KKK leader. Oh the irony. And again how is President Trump racist? Because when I ask this question all I get is "because he is" and nothing to back it up.
All that money trump stole for himself and his kids and friends none for us people. McConnell is a criminal married to a communist. McConnell can not be trusted he is a communist. The richest of all Americans received all that money.
Joe Biden did not dodge the draft he served his son's served. Trump is a 4x draft dodger. Biden does not steal from us for himself. He has worked for America his whole life to protect and defend our freedoms. Trump steals, commits Treason, allows Putin to kill our Veterans.
Joe Biden knows and respects our constitution he respects all people no matter what age, color or religion. Ins Co. can no longer deny people with illnesses. Our allies know and respect him. Our Allies hate that trump is in bed with Putin and the Taliban.
Trump your lies aren't even believable you hate God you don't know God. Most importantly God hates you donny j trump God sees all the hate and crimes to commit your going straight to hell, by the looks of you very soon.
swing and a miss   thank you for consistently hitting it out of the park for those of us living with disabilities. I am beyond proud to call you my Senator
Joe Biden is a devout Catholic. Trump is a russian liar that hates God.
Trump is threatening Dr. Fauci daughters to be killed. This is not a president trump is a mobster and his cult are Nazis.
Both of their deaths are Trumps selfish fault. He stole our PPE's and money to stop a pandemic. Trump is always a criminal first.
Your not a true American. Biden is a true American and is always loyal to his country and it's citizens. Trump is a criminal that works for Vlad Putin. Either your an American or your not. If not get out of America you belong in Russia with Putin.
Junkie trump is now nothing more than a retarded man.
Real American Military Veterans hate donald j trump and know he is working against them by allowing Putin to murder them for money going to the Taliban and to trump. USA Vets do not trust and will not honor that treason committing criminal. Vets hate Trump and so does America.
Trump is a fraud and a con huge child.
Impressive boasts!  Now if trump could only pronounce "Yosemite"!
Trump does not know God he is a liar he has never praised God for anything. God however, knows trump. He knows trump is a coward, liar and a criminal. He knows trump cheats in life and on his wives. God knows trump is a rapist of children and older women forced abortions.
Trump has earned every attack against him. He's a POS, but you're ashamed to admit it.
This is trumps biggest lie ever. Trump hates Main Street people he only loves wall st filthy rich people. Trump is a liar and a criminal. He is allowing Putin to murder our Veterans as will. Trump is a criminal must be locked up forever.
Trump administration tackling Chicago's crime-ridden neighborhoods  via
Oh sure, trump's solution is to send his goon squad of mercenaries to tear gas the crowd, shoot them with rubber bullets and beat up and abduct protesters!  That's not solving anything.
Yet no regard for human life in relation to C 19.   Abortion is nothing more than a POLITICAL TALKING POINT.  The topic ONLY comes up in election years.  In Trump's words, "It is what it is.".At least we are better than The World.  #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
He could run to Moscow. They'll name it Putin Tower, not after Trump.
How is this Mayor Lightfoot's fault?  Did she shoot the rapper?  She's trying her best to keep Covid-19 under control in Chicago while trying to control the gangs and gun violence. Worry about trump's inaction on the virus and racism. Quit deflecting on Chicago!
How you can say you "kneel for Jesus" and support someone like trump is unbelievable!
Are you serious? You are considering Trump?
You won't commit to voting for Joe Biden until the debates are over?  Really?  Like you think trump will do a 360 and say something intelligent?
Trump's showing what a crook he is!  He thinks like a mobster.
Trump is a liar
I'm not talking to Eric Trump right now - can you please tell him to stay off my youtube video ads complaining that Twitter deleted his tweets......  asking for America
Dumb as a box of rocks!  But they're counting on trump supporters, who buy anything they're selling. Kayleigh doesn't count on people actually checking the facts!
Trump says Biden is going to ‚Äúhurt god, hurt the Bible.‚Äù How do you hurt an imaginary fairy in the sky or a book?
Have you ever listened to trump?  He can't even speak in whole sentences!  He babbles on, lying and making no sense. You have a lot of nerve, trying to call out Joe Biden!

I'd like to see Trump say the alphabet backwards. Mind will melt.
My mom died last May from Covid. But, I guess it is what it is. Bad Karma on Trump. Madness erupting.
I think we could be billionaires if we just piled up Trump and his entire administration (2016-present) into one room.
I read a theory that Trump resigns then Pence pardons in on all future charges. I say wait until after election then throw everything at him.
Is this about the older Trump litter?
Really? See before it was I'd rather vote for a traffic cone then Donald Trump. Now, we have to wait to see who Joe Biden's VP pick is before we can vote for him.  No SE, no. We vote for Biden so we can get rid of Trump. Doesn't matter who he picks.
It depends who is announcing it. Fauci, the UK that has one underway in testing, the CDC - yes - Trump or Trumpettes NO
Imagine not realizing that the Attorney General of the United States under President Donald Trump investigated Clinton Foundation but couldn't find anything.
Didn't she see the MAGA hat and golf club Trump holders in his office?
Oh Rudy the red nosed psycho. How will you react when you contract Covid and Trump says it is what it is and denies you access to his lower mouth to rim?
I hear a staff member was fired for failing to restock bronzer spray. Trump had a very difficult time deciding if he should spray the top half or bottom half of his face. Melody suggested spray the top half and cover half with a mask to hide his mouth.
They'll be the first state to try to secede when trump wins again .
Holy shit could you imagine if even hf this sentence was uttered by Trump or Ted Cruz? Thered be hell. But its Biden so meh right? Bullshit bullshit bullshit.

It is on my end, I think. It hasn't been behaving since my last temp ban.

We can do this all day. Biden is bad. But trump is worse IMO.
I love when a Trumper online goes ‚Äúbut Al Sharpton did this‚Äù or ‚ÄúBill Clinton did that‚Äù.   Just because I don‚Äôt like Trump doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm in love with every democrat ever
You obviously don‚Äôt wanna talk about how Donald Trump called for the heads of the Central Park 5
If it‚Äôs true he should go to prison. I have no alliances to people in politics. Clinton? Trump? Sharpton? Jackson? Who cares, if they‚Äôre guilty send them away.
Donald Trump spent 85k to take out these ads calling for the heads of 5 innocent boys. Was quoted in saying hate was a solution for progress. And years later when DNA evidence proved their innocence he still holds onto the idea they committed the crime
Fox news goes to extremes with blatant false news and praising trump constantly
Trump also called for the heads of the Central Park 5 and the Trump family has a history of housing discrimination against POC
Just as tRump has destroyed the R‚Äôs - NOT pursuing this will destroy the D‚Äôs.  We will not stand for it again!
President Trump saved 2 million lives by banning travel from China in January.
Honest to God, that was my first thought when I saw trump and pull ups in the same sentence!
Don't need a degree in Psychology to see Trump can't cope with the fact that  That he knows deep down he is one fucked up person who will never be recognized as a past President.

How Trump is sabotaging the office until Joe and the dems take over
Trump claims children are immune so schools should open. He is willing to put children in danger to win election. Please get him out. Beyond dangerous. SERIOUDLY.
This is why trump is placing his buddy as head of USPS. He's not going to allow the mail in votes to be counted. The fix is in and we know how this on is going to happen.
Listen up liar Pence it was trumps responsibility to be ready for any pandemic. He chose to steal the money and sell the equipment President Obama left with instructions on how to handle it. This is all on trump and pence #TrumpPence157KDeadAmericans you did nothing.
Trump is doing illegal drugs he is a junkie.
This is a giant lie. The black man is a paid for loyal trump fraud. Joe Biden is extremely intelligent and he is not a junkie. Trump and this ass wipe black man are junkies tripping their brains out.
America is with our Vets. Trump is with Putin killing our Vets.
You couldn't find a more stupid man than Gov. DeSantis other than trump if your tried. DeSantis is the reason his state is leading in covid 19 cases and deaths.
All our Veterans know trump is compromised by Putin, Saudis, Taliban, N Korea. They understand how dangerous trump is to America. They do not want trump in their life ever again.
This is how stupid the entire trump family is. They have no idea how money works or how government works. They are as useless as a termite. They do nothing but cause failure in everything and anything trump touches.
This is how stupid Eric Trump is. We haven't hit the bottom yet but we will in 2021 when all the banks go belly up, housing market crashes again and the market will no exist. We are now entering the greatest depression ever seen since the beginning of records be recorded.

Kanye West is a huge fraud and liar. He is a drug addict and a thief married to a fraud. No surprise this man is a criminal and a fraud just like trump. Trump is gonna use him for all he can get I hope they both get hurt very badly also Kanye fake wife is another fraud.
This is unacceptable and the Secret Service needs to start to protect Dr. Fauci and his entire family. This is trump madness his hateful followers are just this stupid to kill a man of Science because they are to stupid to understand science. Trumps followers should be expelled.
Trump hates America and lover Putin. #TrumpTreason
Translation this scott adams is a Putin/Trump treason lover russian. Hope your show tanks it's awful and your a russian lover. Senator Kennedy is as stupid as trump but you too must not be very intelligent to think Ms. Yates didn't just make a complete fool of Kennedy.
The same Senator Kennedy that suck's off Putin every 4th of July. Go live with Putin in Russia no one deserves to suffer for the rest of his life as much as you other than Trump the Russian spy. #GOPTheDeadParty

There is absolutely no reason Biden should agree to even one debate with this cockwomble. Just stay the course, Mr. VP, and let Trump continue to destroy himself.

trump has killed 157KAmerican because he is to stupid to get of the trump virus infecting the entire world. All other countries have done very well controlling it only trump and America have totally and completely failed. Trump is a failure again.
No Veteran will ever endorse trump they can't trust him due to trump allowing Putin to have them all murdered. Trump is unfit to even speak to a Veteran much less direct them. They are men and women of honor trump is a criminal that committed TREASON and murder.
The media has become brain dead. All of them lost total respect for them they all allow trump to lie and never question his lies ever.
Trump kills all he touches. He has proven that to be true.
Fauci, I wouldn't trump to kill an ant farm.
This trump ad proves trump is unstable and unfit to ever be in politics. Besides he works for Putin not America.
F off - Mr. Trump Read your Exodus and tell us how, God wanted everything to Go Back to what the Egyptians thought was Great.  This is in God's plan and your only part to play in it is the anti-Christ.  #ItIsWhatItIs  God's in control. You keep doing you
The only positive thing I can take from trump is he has committed Treason and is able to receive a Death Sentence instead of life in prison. I am all in for the death penalty for trump.

Nobody ever knew about Jankmaster and Smeg Heads, until Trump
Nobody Ever Knew until Donald tRump told us in partial sentences.

Lol yeah that‚Äôs completely what I meant. Bill Clinton is disgusting but he‚Äôs gone, done. Trump is the same animal and you‚Äôre chanting ‚Äú4 more years‚Äù
First, I‚Äôm not seeing many on the left holding Bill Clinton as some great person in the year 2020. Second, it is Trump and you fuckfaces are trying to re-elect him President.
Certainly, I have my issues with Trump and I certainly don‚Äôt see him as God‚Äôs chosen prophet or anything like that. He‚Äôs a really mixed bag, and I don‚Äôt really know what his motives are. But if he‚Äôs going to defend us, at this point I will take it.
At this point, Trump. He‚Äôs the only one I see out there who‚Äôs willing to minimize obstacles (in the civil realm) to our sacramental union with Christ, and that is my one issue right now. The other side has shown itself to be completely hostile; I utterly loathe leftism now. ‚úùÔ∏è
Trump 2020 is just an expiration date so don‚Äôt worry lol
I just saw a woman at my Walmart with a ‚ÄúTrump 2020‚Äù mask, a clearly fake Gucci bag, McDonald‚Äôs drink in one hand, dragging her kid along with the other.   If it walks like a Karen and talks like a Karen...
Clowns?  Doesn't trump have enough clowns in his administration, himself included?
And considering how awful Trump has been I‚Äôm still sore about Nate‚Äôs missed call. That pollster failure makes one doubt these polls with Biden so far ahead.
Dan, when trump stated it is what it is referring to the 155K Americans that have died from the pandemic, I can‚Äôt imagine what his plan will be.
We got to hear a real intelligent president speak in Obama, something Trump will never be.
This also is gross and irrelevant when you do it to Trump. His weight has literally nothing to do with coronavirus.

Sure sounds like a mobster shake down. Never forget  worked with Organized Crime to build Trump Tower. And he revered John Gotti.

Yes this is the guy that is going to steal the election for trump. He's going to mail out the ballots but never receive any of them back to be counted. This is all a trump/DeJoy fraud. DeJoy owns 75M in assets with USPS competitors.
You know why Mary it's its all because of your lying, cheating, fraud, putin loving criminal trump the biggest loser in the world.
George I believe this is intentional to have all people vote by mail then declare it illegal on the 3rd after all mail in's have been received. This is the easiest way for trump to cheat.
To get Trump out of office.
This is my I don't trust it. trump knows everyone will do a mail in ballot then on Nov. 3 he'll declare mail in ballots are not going to be counted because he received information they are all fraudulent. This is exactly what any criminal would do.
This man using misleading graphs and trynna trick himself he doing trump got daddy issues that‚Äôs why mans need to lie to himself
Those people are to stupid to understand trump laughs at their pain he like to see people hurt it makes him feel good to know people live in pain daily he loves to hate everyone.
If you vote for trump you are an American you are a full blown Nazis criminal.
Trump made a complete and total fool for himself for the entire to watch and laugh at.
Don't trust trump he going to push to use vote by mail then declare it illegal on Nov. 3 after everyone thinks they already voted just to find out their votes won't count. You must start thinking like trump everything he does is to set up another crime for profit to himself.
He installed his criminal friend to run it. This new guy ownes 75millions in usps competitors. He took the job to crash the mail service and make for money for himself. This is another sell by trump for money.

1st order of business, Trump is elected. 2nd order of business, republicans take house back
I don‚Äôt know..... it‚Äôs too fast. I think it‚Äôs a placebo mixed with bleach. I‚Äôll follow science and not trump.
Sharp-eyed critics found the real photos -- and they tell a different story.
Only the Democrats can snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory.
President Trump cannot pick and choose which facts are true and which are fake: the US has 4% of the global population and 25% of #COVID19 cases. We are not doing better than other countries.
So are trump and republicans.
Our nation run by trump is in shambles.
I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll vote against trump. She doesn‚Äôt want to piss off her republican friends.
Trying to control judicial process. Shame on trump and cronies.
Let‚Äôs do a fact check on this video. trump manipulated images of Biden.
When Trump was ahead in the polls he planned to skip the debates. Now that he is losing so badly he wants them. Too bad for Trump.
Donald Trump is a criminal.  #DonsNextCon  Also, if you think trump is responsible for pandemic mismanagement, reply with #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory  ...go ahead. Just admit it. #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory

Trump is above the law
Sad to see them cut and run, but Dylan blaming Q and Trump for his own doubt and fear was... interesting. Not going out of my way to watch his YouTube. But I‚Äôll check it if it floats in, out of curiosity.
I don‚Äôt think Trump really cares if we vote by mail. What he is doing is setting the stage for claiming that many of the mail in votes are fraudulent. Then when he loses, he can say he warned us and that the election was corrupted and therefore not legal.
Trump has screwed more allies than anyone in history. He has also made the office he serves a laughingstock the world over.
The grossly incompetent one is Trump. We have never had a POTUS as incompetent as Trump.

The FBI had fisa warrants on carter page before he was hired by the trump administration. Because was an unregistered Russian agent.
This is what happens when you put an idiot in charge of the well being and security of a nation. Trump wanted HCQ, the govt had to buy it to soothe his ego and now they are going to promote it, damn the scientist And if 100s of thousand americans die, thats just an inconvenience
China felt the same way. They didn‚Äôt want their scientists speaking directly to the media. So they censored their communications. Just like the Trump administration is doing it.
Nope. Nobody outside of committed trump base voters belive it.
Trump is mentally comprised. Totally unfit for office. 160,000 dead Americans is evidence of that
Bingo, the trump administration makes them authorize their communications with the political arm of the White House. Hence they don‚Äôt communicate directly anymore.
Belated thought... Did Trump also think this cartoon character's name was Yo-Semite Sam?
Exactly how we feel about Trump, the 160,000 dead Americans is a direct result
I mean Trump is friends with the same Mf.
You used to just be an annoying idiot. Now? 158,000 deaths on trump's hands mismanaging or gaming pandemic to steal another election. Murderer.  #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory #25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #WeStillShootTraitorsDontWe?
How does someone who advises our President on a daily basis have time to earn this kind of money? Illegally and through major corruption. These 2 will join Trump in prison next year.
In other words, swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona shouldn‚Äôt vote for Trump because he could care less about them.
Trump plans to screw over everyone by cutting the benefit to 1/3 what it was.
Our country is run by Repub Trump &amp; over 1,000 people per day are dying from the Trump Corona Virus. We have the highest deficit in history, we just posted the worst quarter in history and Trump touts a drug that does more harm than good. I‚Äôd rather have demonstrators than die.
It is a good one , Trump did answer good , later on when they going to come back and ask  him again , he will say I I did tell you I will do whatever I can , total transparency. There you go , people who are awakened do know about UFO's ,  rest they can stay sleeping , lol .
This the real Trump!
The trump administration didn‚Äôt declassify who Flynn was talking to.
Flynn‚Äôs call wasn‚Äôt legit. Flynn wasn‚Äôt under surveillance. The trump admin DOJ won‚Äôt declassify who he contacted that was under surveillance... then he lied to VP pence
Absolutely!!  Biden is giving Trump enough rope to hang himself.  And Trump can't help but do that!

Correct, democrats policy will be better for the working class but it does not cater to them. With Republicans &amp; Trump working class get to freely be bigots and racists.
Crooked democrats will do anything to get Trump out of office. Too bad it will not work. So you might as well start crying now!

Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so badly and the left will never get over it. They tried to destroy him with the all costs, it never worked out for them, never will.  And this November he will do the same for Joe Biden...oh boy!

trump, Barr, what are you doing? Got caught with your pants down.
If we all bout a small book of stamps each month, the US Postal service could meet its payroll and expenditure demands without trump defunding.
Another reason to vote Trump 2020
Tr7mp made no national policy for the Trump Corona Virus so all 50 governors were bidding against each other for PPE and ventilators. This drove up prices many times higher than normal. Thanks Trump for costing us so much extra.
FISA warrants were all proven warranted. No crimes. Just Trump lies.
Yea, sure. I won‚Äôt believe it till I see prices actually come down. It is a proven FACT, TRUMP LIES more than any other POTUS in history.
If everyone could afford to, they could buy stamps via internet which would most likely keep the post office operational. That way the post office will not be underfunded when trump defunds them.
Are you guys capable of making, like, positive Trump ads instead of negative Biden ads? Or are you only able to lean on (manipulated) negativity because you know that Trump has done nothing positive?
As a vet myself these are exactly my feelings. I will NOT be VOTING for TRUMP THE DRAFT DODGING COWARD.
What‚Äôs you PHD in, imagination? There is no deep state. It would be impossible to cover up. Not that many people could keep their mouths shut that long. Quit drinking the Trump kool aid.
In Dec of 2019 Trump was saying he would probably not attend any debates for 2020. Now that he is losing big time he is willing to,take any chance to get an extra vote. I say, Biden should just skip the debate.
Good, but If I were Biden I would demand that Trump reveal his tax returns or NO debates!

This is what I believed about the 2016 election: it was necessary to vote out Republicans across the board.  Instead we got stupid vote-swapping schemes, idiotic third party bids, ticket-splitting, and apathy, which delivered the White House and a pliable Congress to Trump.

Why did it take the media 3.5 years to finally learn how to interview Trump?
He thought Trump would be to the left of HRC.

"U.S., #China Plan to Review Phase-One Trade Deal Mid-Month,"   * Discussions come as Trump threatens to ban TikTok in U.S.  * Trump has said the #trade deal means ‚Äòmuch less‚Äô to him now.
how's co-chairing trump's IL campaign going? any updates on that? strongly looking at the numbers?
Trump is either incapable of grasping reality or he‚Äôs just a total imbecile

Will says Biden ‚Äúunderstands, as some progressives seem not to, that presidential elections are won not by pleasing the most intense faction but by assembling a temperate coalition.‚Äù Is that how Trump won, George? Since Goldwater, the GOP has been an intense faction, en masse.

Your religious beliefs do not trump a person's right to exist or identify as whatever gender they choose.  The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that you cannot discriminate against Transgendered people.
Those are really good statistics if you want to minimize a group of people. As trump tends to want. Real studies put the true number between 1.2 % and 6.8% of the population.
The funny (?) thing about all of this is that Q-Tip may turn out to be *right* about the child sex trafficking ring, at least in the broadest of strokes. They‚Äôre just wrong about everything else, especially the hilarious theory that Trump is somehow trying to stop it.
watch something else, I am tired of hearing trump and the horde say anything.
We've known it for a while but after that Axios interview it should be painfully obvious that the only reason anybody still supports Trump is because they're a racist and they like that he is one too.   Any other rationale is literally indefensible.

But you got to understand is that it doesn't matter if Trump wins or Biden, wins we all lose in the end. Both are basically the same except one is a fascist. I'm not going to vote for the lesser up to evils again because "orange man bad".
I would agree with this. No doubt Trump is closer to the core Republican base than the swamp guys and that‚Äôs why he won the nomination
What I'm saying is that doesn't make any sense. If you're not voting for anyone, then you're not voting for anyone it's very simple I don't care if Joe and Trump are the two main candidates, no one is entitled to our vote.
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs an acting position open. Trump prefers to surround himself with actors. Qualified people wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep a straight face when he rattles off his nonsense.
Just last week Trump asked to extend it while they work on another stimulus SHE REFUSED she was asked earlier this week she said NO again. Go back and watch her interviews.
Any person who believes Trump has a more authentic faith than Joe needs to STHU and sit down.  What a ridiculous, delusional position to take. I‚Äôm agnostic, I wouldn‚Äôt care if he was too. What I do care about are fake, dishonest attacks to defend a fake, dishonest conman.

Voting for Biden and Trump is a waste of a vote
Trump makes so many gaffes, that I miss many of them. I didn't hear this one at the time, but I see nor reason not to remind  about his past mistakes
Voting for Trump and Biden is a waste of a vote. I'm tired of voting for the lesser up to evils like we always have and I'm damn sure not going to vote for pedo, pro police, pro war, racist Biden because "orange man bad " so I might either withhold my vote or vote third party.
If you only dump Trump and don't also dump those who have enabled him to remain in office (in this case nearly every other elected Republican) you'll just get another Trump in short order.  Like I've told any gross friends  "Clean your house and maybe I'll come over again"

TikTok and WeChat might actually problem for American citizens, but that‚Äôs not why Trump signed his executive order
No, you don't. Trump isn't Racist at all. It's just a Leftist media smear campaign. Historic funding to HBCUs, First step act, opportunity zone investments to poor Black neighborhoods, Young Black white house leadership meeting.  So some research please. Stop listening to media.
Hmmm.... Trump must be doing something right
Exactly, when has anyone ever heard of and apology or a clarification from Trump? Never Biden may fault on his words at least he has the courage and heart to change the tone and admit his mistakes. #Election2020 #Biden2020 #COVID19 #VoteBlue #VetsResistSquadron
No matter how deep you dig for him to be right, he is wrong. To justify his gaffe you had to turn to regional dialects.  Of which Trump doesn't have. Was he using a different dialect saying "Yosemite" too?  Show yourself some respect and quit defending that nutter.
Your publushed musing about wasting your vote on a write-in for president is irresponsible, and you know it. We have a two-party system. A vote not cast for Biden is a vote cast for Trump, whose re-election is unacceptable.
What happened to you? Your present role as #MorningPropagandist is very disheartening. Do you think everybody is stupid because you wanted to be a #PinkPuma operative? This 24/7 Anti-Trump format is going to blow up in your face. You‚Äôve thrown yourself overboard. #NuGOP
Kanye is allowing this. He loves Trump.
Then why did trump say it "incorrectly" immediately after he said it "correctly?"   Have all of us also been mispronouncing "Yosemite?" Or "anonymous?" Or "origins?" Or "Ulysses?"

Kanye west needs inpatient psychiatric care. Nothing he says makes any sense except to donald trump. Maybe they could be roommates at the nut house.

I think he is trying to steal as much of our treasure before he bails out of the election. He is not going to accept the Republican nomination for presidency. Soon after the selection, Pence will pardon Trump and his family.

You know Biden is a coward to go against President Trump and that he's got a yellow streak like the black lives matter put on the streets
Big loaded in front the trump towers
Trump is going to lose the election by taking all the youths toys away.
&lt;span class='s1'&gt;Tribune columnist Eric Zorn deconstructs the ways in which Donald Trump has evoked the Bible during the 2016 campaign. &lt;/span&gt;Oct. 27, 2016.
Wow!  Another thing the email lady called in 2016.  Those of us with common sense knew a trump presidency would be disastrous!  How much worse do things need to get before this country wakes up and says enough of this bullshit...#trump Must Go!  #VOTE #Biden2020
SLANDER SLANDER SLANDER THATS ALL THE REPUBLICANS &amp; TOM CAN DO BECAUSE THEY MUST COVER UP FOR TRUMP TO KEEP THEIR ‚ÄúBRIBES‚Äù COMING!! THEY NEVER ACTUALLY SHOW US ANYTHING, JUST THREATEN US THAT THEY HAVE IT? THEY CAN‚ÄôT PROVE SOMETHING THAT DIDN‚ÄôT OR DOESN‚ÄôT EXIST!
Oh yes he doesn‚Äôt even know which is up or down as he hold the Bible upside down. Trump is a fraud.
This tweet is exactly why Trump beat Hillary and will beat Biden. America hates liars and Biden is a phony liar.
WE‚ÄôRE TIRED OF TRUMP &amp; THE REPUBLICANS SMEAR TACTICS! BIDEN SPENDS HIS TIME WORKING ON GOALS. TRUMP‚ÄôS DOING NOTHING
NOT IF THE MANUFACTURING IS THE TYPE THAT WILL ACCELERATE THE EXTINCTION OF OUR PLANET!!! THAT ‚ÄúWEAKENS‚Äù OUR NATION &amp; WORLD! TRUMP IS AN IDIOT AND DOESN‚ÄôT BELIEVE WE‚ÄôRE IN OUR 6th EXTINCTION. HE JUST WANTS TO MAKE THE INDUSTRIES HAPPY SO THEY CONTRIBUTE TO HIS CAMPAIGN!
Republican values flew out the door when Trump was nominated in the R party. He doesn't represent any of the fiscally conservative ideas that made our party great. He completely destroyed the party. I jumped ship and switch to the correct party of the people.
ACTUALLY, CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT MORE JOYFUL &amp; HAPPY- LOOK AT ALL THE FUCKING REPUBLICANS! THEY HAVE HAVE STICKS UP THEIR ASSES! THEY ARE NOT HAPPY. LIBERALS KNOW HOW TO HAVE FUN AND GET DOWN &amp; DIRTY! TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE IDIOTS FOR SUPPORTING A PEDOPHILE, RAPIST, RACIST, TRAITOR!
I'm sick of people saying that Trump is doing "some things right." That's like praising the guy who robbed your house for closing the door behind him after he left.   #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
IT WILL BE GOOD TO GET RID OF YOU. YOU LIE A LOT &amp; WE ALL HAVE HAD ENOUGH LIES FROM TRUMP AND ALL THE CORRUPT REPUBLICANS. YOU HAVE SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON BULLSHIT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN CLEARED, AND NOTHING ON TRUMP &amp; THE ADMINISTRATION OR GOP. YOU‚ÄôRE AN ASS KISSER!
Trump just picked a fight with the planet's biggest video game company
GOP! WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THIS FAKE INFO??TRUMP?? STOP LISTENING TO HIS BULLSHIT! I LIVE IN CHICAGO- AND HAVE ALL MY LIFE! I LOVE CHICAGO AND ‚ÄúCHAOS IS NOT REIGNING!‚Äù TRUMP JUST WANTS TO SEND HIS ROBO COPS HERE. FUCK TRUMP! HE KNOWS WE HATE HIM! TRUMP TOWER IN CHGO IS HIDEOUS!!
Cant wait for #trump to take out his handy dandy #blacksharpie pen to change the spelling of #Thailand to #Thighland .sad to see our country go to hell. Trump gas not done a thing for this country, we all look like dot heads with face coverings for a fake virus,  let's all drink bleach , Trump said its the thing to do.
The last insight in my tree rings today would cover many years of subscription. Fabulous work on collecting data to support insights. I particularly like Pence's quote. Could they be any more obvious? This is swinging for the fences for Trump. This is going to make $$
The governor has no right to force us to wear masks, covid-19 is fake its an engineered virus to take down Trump.  Pritker sucks balls
McConnell's wife's family business appears on Trump admin's list of companies that received most PPP money  She was given stimulus money for her family business in China! WTH!
Trump doesn‚Äôt even know the Lords Prayer as witnessed at George Bush Sr. Funeral.
If only CNN could be as stern when President Trump‚Äôs Family is routinely attacked by the media.  Sucks when it happens to you, doesn‚Äôt it?
Vote for tRump
I think it‚Äôs really pathetic when a billionaire wife is chronically depressed because a man she dislikes is president. Can‚Äôt you get a life and channel your energy into something positive instead of agonizing over Trump?

That's pathetic that you have to doctor up a photo.  LOL.  From the side that is always whining about fake news loves to spread fake news.  Tired of the same old hypocrisy.  This is why Americans don't like tRump!
Ummm, you notice it says America OR tRump right?  You can't have both.  tRump dances to the putin drums not USA.  Put the kool aid down and open your eyes!

I was down in southern Illinois today I gave up counting all Trump 2020 signs way too many. The people also had Pritzker Sucks signs, it was great
President Trump is a man who leads by example. He took the drug the he recommended for COVID. Where else do you see that. Rare in our days. Surely Fauci, Gates and friends won‚Äôt take the vaccine first
This guy is spot on!!!!
You‚Äôre right, especially living in the most liberal state of all. It‚Äôs coming at her from every direction. I can‚Äôt win. I‚Äôd love to hear what has changed other liberals minds to flip and vote for Trump. Was it one specific reason? If so, what was that?
She knows all this stuff about Obama, that‚Äôs why she was Republican. Her preference is the Republican Party just not Trump. I think we can all agree he has said some dumb stuff but his accomplishments and get it done mentality outweigh his past comments.
As parents I think we need to just let go and let them make their own decisions. Easier said than done. My daughter likes things about both parties, she just hates Trump so much as a person... she‚Äôll choose no one instead of him. She needs to learn more but won‚Äôt. üò¢
Yup. Only Trump could manage to allow more than 150K Americans die and do essentially nothing about it AND whine forever about how HE is the victim in all of this. Perfect.
My daughter 26 moved from Illinois to Seattle WA and hates Trump. It kills me, she was raised Republican and now feels Trump hates women and minorities... what can I say to wake her up?
No knowledge of cause, never talked to any generals, just pure speculation based on his d we‚Äôd Arledge imagination. If given a choice , Trump will inevitably select the worst and most cruel option.
I hope Neil You g will remember, a Trump voter don‚Äôt need him around anyhow
It‚Äôs August 4th, your miserable shot show failed and Donald Trump is still your President

I heard the Vatican was taken down, Pope and 350 others arrested and 650 airplanes loaded up with the money, gold and documents confiscated by Trump. He‚Äôs taken down the 3 pillars of the deep state, the Vatican, the Royals and Federal Reserve!

Alexander Vindman compares Trump administration to 'authoritarian regime' in scathing op-ed   He must be confused, the Marist authoritarian regime are the Democrats who want to destroy America and control every aspect of our life‚Äôs
Evangelical Trump Supporters:
Makes us all understand now why Trump didn‚Äôt want Obama to close down Guant√°namo Bay prison. Trump made sure it stayed open in Cuba. He even got the Pentagon to agree to add new wings to it, remode &amp; update... wonder why. The indictments are beginning!! Get the popcornüçø
Because Trump is a misogynist.
I used to think you were our champion but, you staunch defense of Trump shows me your blinders are still lined with greenbacks and not your fellow Americans needs
Obviously Clinton let it go, Bush cut him a deal, and people are questioning why Obama didn‚Äôt do anything about Epstein. Trump‚Äôs and prince Andrew‚Äôs names don‚Äôt appear but are speculated to be redacted
None against Trump
Manfred is a Trump cronie. What do you expect Kap. Same game plan !
My pastor wouldn‚Äôt say anything in a sermon, but behind closed doors he‚Äôd let you know just how little he thinks of Trump. My church is also pretty progressive though considering the average age of members (older), so definitely an outlier.

Yet it‚Äôs ok with you that Gates and Obama funded the damn lab in China that started all this in motion years ago? But now it‚Äôs all Trumps fault? Put all your blame where it belongs!The investigation only suggests 1 occasion where Trump may have obstructed justice before the was president. It has a few from after he was president, but they couldn't have influenced the election for, I hope, obvious reasons.  If there was anything concrete he'd be gone by now.

trump cares about the election so much he's willing to help kanye get on ballots in states where he think he might lose. so gracious.
People are brainwashed to think nothing can be worse than trump. Even if trump is as bad as some people think, Biden is inherently worse.
Trump continues to flout social distancing guidelines even as he urges others to follow them  He has that luxury since everyone is tested before getting close to him. Example; Gov of Ohio. Tested positive, so couldn't meet him as normal during a visit.
I fully support the republicans pulling back on giving money to the states and cities. Americans should not bail out democratic run states and cities who failed on funding their pension system. They give into unions for votes and now want is to bail them out. Hold firm Trump!
Trump will make Pelosi look stupid. She is playing politics with the stimulus package. Worst speaker of the house in my lifetime
Well, when you have people like this making Donald Trump out to be immortal, we are screwed as a society.

Alright now let‚Äôs talk about the accomplishments. He got us out one of the biggest recessions. He passed the Affordable Care Act which gave millions health care. He passed the Wall Street reform. Ended the Iraq war. We had a great economy which Trump took over.
We were talking about Trump but sure let‚Äôs bring up Biden since y‚Äôall know Trump is awful. No the 1994 bill was awful and unlike Trump supporters we accept what Biden has done wrong. Want to talk about the Obama administration and it‚Äôs accomplishments.
She's looking for cover for either voting for Trump again or for not voting for Biden, but for someone else.
Trump was barely seen wearing a mask. He has a huge following and if he simply tells his followers to wear the damn masks we would be in better shape.
So no explanation of what Trump has done?
Trump has sign an executive order for TikTok that will start in 45 days!!

No way, no how will Biden debate Trump. It doesn't matter what Biden is, he won't be running anything, the party will be running the country, right over the cliff.
trump, Barr, what are you doing? Got caught with your pants down.
If we all bout a small book of stamps each month, the US Postal service could meet its payroll and expenditure demands without trump defunding.
So it is ok for Trump to ask that question?
Let me guess, the Washington Post lies too? Lmao 90 days until you will owe me $1200 because Biden will destroy Trump in the election. Haha can‚Äôt wait.
If everyone could afford to, they could buy stamps via internet which would most likely keep the post office operational. That way the post office will not be underfunded when trump defunds them.
This still isn't as bad as Trump many times a day.

I thought Trump built the greatest economy the world ever has seen? (Not even close but you believe it). And now Trump has self destructed. He is awful and you won‚Äôt change my mind. Stop trying. You won‚Äôt change my mind about Biden. Stop trying. You‚Äôre a loser. Fact. 91 days. üòò
I‚Äôm going to have faith in the voters that they can 1) see through this and 2) know that Kanye is an unstable idiot. But as Trump said in 2016, he loves stupid people, and then they voted for him.
Biden was for gay marriage before President Obama was. Fact check me. Trump was in politics long before 2015 with his Birtherism crap and all his crazy comments before. You righties forget all that Trump has done wrong. You‚Äôre idiots. 91 days üòò
Who‚Äôs the boss Donald Trump
Trump says Epstein was never a Mar-a-Lago member. He was. New book tells what got him exiled
People make mistakes and Biden has learned from his. Trump was a pro-choice democrat until 2015 so spare me the righteous Biden nonsense. And the YouTube video was not what you say it is you pervert.
"...text 8802 for Prez Trump--" and lo, now allegedly President Trump emails the faithful with THIS?!: "Patriots wear face masks"????! If that's true, Mr. President, why don't we want dirty ole Mr./s Biden next term, eh?
You love to use what others say as evidence instead of what is said by the actual source. You did it with Trump and you are doing it with Biden now. You are worthless to argue with because you argue vague points that don‚Äôt directly state a purpose. And you question me being an...
He doesn‚Äôt read, so he only knows the name from hearing it. It‚Äôs telling that in that jumble of letters, Trump immediately saw Semite.
When will Christians issue their correction about Trump being a Christian?
Thank you, again, Andy.
What makes so sure he will be reelected? I have to know. I worked for the Bernie campaign. I do not see a scenario where Trump wins.
"It is what it is" is a verbal shoulder-shrug.  It's what you say when you miss the bus. It's NOT how you react to 155,000+ dead. Donald Trump is a murderer and this department is flying a FAKE flag.   HELP US SPREAD TRUMP'S SHAME. #ItIsWhatItIs
Make America Great Again.  Resign. 1,000 deaths per day on trump's incapable hands mismanaging pandemic to steal another election. #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory #25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  156,426 American deaths on trump's hands.

Hahahahaha. Yeah Biden is brain dead. Put any Donald Trump speech or press conference next to one of Biden‚Äôs and the clear winner or context and grammar would be Biden by a wide margin. You support the dumbest president in our history. You should be proud. Lmao. 92 days üòò
trump took money from Russia through NRA.
Right mmmmhmmmm. Why should I believe trump. Could it be he LIES to everyone everytime he opens his mouth?!?!
trump thinks that just by hanging around Kanye and giving Ben Carson a job he‚Äôs done wonders for the black community.
trump
Anybody looking at this and thinking, 'Wow smarter than Trump'
How can anyone after watching this interview still back Trump up? He obviously has a very hard time discerning information. Who‚Äôs really the President right now?
As it gets closer to the election and it becomes more clear Biden is going to win, that‚Äôs when you will block me because you don‚Äôt want to lose $1200. 2016 is not going to repeat itself as America is falling apart because of Trump. Wake up, dumbass. 91 days. üòò
Have you read -  Journalist's gobsmacked reactions during Trump interview are Twitter's too  #Memes #DonaldTrump - your thoughts?
oh man I wanna say it was Andrew Yang vs Joe Biden. but Yang had said that biden was a strong debater. I have no doubts that he will beat Trump.
Keyword you say is "Every year".  This is 1000 per day. Second, Swine flu was NOT pandemic proportions, COVID is, meaning it is a flu that "magically disappears" Trump thought Swine flu would go away.  This one isn't and this one kills or leaves you weak for many months.
Trump Plan is to attack Legitimacy of voting system.  He's defunding the post office, he's lying abt mail in voting. He's trying to stealing election
There isn‚Äôt a silent majority anymore. The independents and women have left Trump. While I don‚Äôt believe this poll, I do believe Biden will win back WI, MI, and PA which will hand Trump a much deserved loss. #BetMe

tRUmp LIES (no matter which one,they all do it)
I've been against Trump since he threw his hat in the ring.
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You should learn that. It explains why so many people have departed Trump and there isn‚Äôt a silent majority as you say. The polls show there is a vocal majority and you‚Äôll learn the hard way in 92 days and $1200 less money. Haha üòÜ
explain this. These are republicans. Good ones too. The real republicans left. Explain why they want Trump out so badly?
Amen~! Go Trump, Go~!
Cyndis Blue needs to wake up. Throwing the future of our kids towards trump if not voting.
"...not trump", Thou shalt not trump.
trump let them out from under the rocks they were hiding under. He emboldened them to act.
Call it what it is. Trump virus.
If you listen to Trump everybody is wrong but him which means he‚Äôll never listen to anybody but himself, only what he says is truth, unless a previous statement he made contradicts the current but, he never checks for contradictions.
Trump is just not letting the medical experts work.  This is hard on the experts that need to hear Trump's inept thoughts on how it should be done.
Was trump on pedo island (given we have all the info so far)  IDC if Trump's a pedo fuck him! But until then he is innocent. Now ask yourself why these reports that existed in 2014 never seen the light of day?   If trump exposes all this shit well buckle up!
Are you talking about Obama or the year Trump has spent golfing?  Because believe me no business is being conducted in the White House much less a golf course.

THE FAKE NEWS GOES BY THE NAME OF DONALD JOHN TRUMP
It's much easier to attack your opponent then list what you have done positive, especially when you're a failure like Trump
Unlike Trump, Biden will hire the very best staff.
Trump
Have there *ever* been any Presidents' kids besides Amy Carter who attended a DC public school? The Trump, Obama, Clinton, Ford, Johnson and Coolidge kids all attended private prep schools. Maybe Taft's son? Any of TR Roosevelt's kids?
That says it all with trump and friends.
Help the post office trump.
Trump can use directive 51, passed in 2007, to push back the election. Lets see how long yhe ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù lasts now?
It is hillarious to watch Democrats attack Trump for throwing out the idea of moving election day. He gets them into such a frenzy. Mail in voting actually does change the election day when you can still find and count votes 2 weeks after the actual day. I call BS.
One car for trump, one for the secret service, and six for?
and  I think Trump doesn‚Äôt support the troops like he claims.

So can trump. But he‚Äôs not doing it.
Go Trump! You are the best!
Yeah trump really sucks but you know what‚Äôs really scary?  The precedent he has set.
They should all be arrested and but in jail. The reply you are referring to also put no mention of politics only the original tweet. Even in the original tweet it simply stated it was a political statement, nothing about Trump
Wow! trump supporter I‚Äôm sure.
What‚Äôs trump gonna do?
So, since the Trump campaign decided to make a campaign ad that looks like a 90‚Äôs WWF PPV promo, I figured I‚Äôd go ahead and cast 90‚Äôs WWF wrestlers as the Trump stable.
Trump keeps promising an overhaul of the nation‚Äôs health-care system that never arrives
I thought the Treasury department was independent from the executive branch!!!! I guess trump is using it as a cash cow!
If trump wins again it‚Äôll be worse. Biden will at least give us some normalcy with the government and the world. And start a road to recovery. It won‚Äôt be overnight though. Those that don‚Äôt vote either way just gave up our children‚Äôs future.
He's a snake oil salesman who proudly talks about "all those flags that say Trump/Pence in the boat parades in Florida"....and also the Fox River in St. Charles today.  Shocking! No social distancing!!

I predict that the good people of California's 22 congressional district will send this Trump sycophant back to being a dairy farmer on Nov. 3

Wrong! We have more cases because trump failed miserably. Prime example...he‚Äôs got time to criticize everybody and everything with tweets when he can expend his energy in trying to save the people and economy.

As a former neurosurgeon you, more than anyone else in Trump's Whitehouse should know the importance of masks.  You wore them for years, and yet I haven't heard a word from you backing up Dr. Fauci.  You obviously are just another Trump sycophant.
tRump has failed consistently, but Putin has not. The orange twatwaffle may well lose but he will not go gentle into that good night: We need to be prepared for that.
As you know #jamescomey, in reopening Hillary's investigation right before the 2016 election, you played a huge part in the electoral college results which allowed Trump to be president.  My question is, how do you live with yourself?
#YesWeCanAgain Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves! We are voting for Biden not because he is going to be a great president... We are voting for him because trump is literally the worst.
Trump needs to enact the war powers act to get Clorox up to speed on the bleach wipes.
Not only is Trump the worst president we've ever had, but he's also the most morbidly obese, as Nancy Pelosi memorably called him, since Howard Taft in 1909.

That is simply not accurate. Trump was called a racist, a rapist, a bigot, &amp; a criminal long before he became POTUS. MANY people disliked this idiot long ago, not just after he beat the despicable Hillary. Frankly, I found him amusing.  But unlike ANY other job in the world, ...

But Trump is a fascist.
Trump is allowing thousands of black people to be killed by his police forces and has a bunch of POC trapped in cages rn. Obama wasnt perfect, but Trump is terrifying

trump cares about the election so much he's willing to help kanye get on ballots in states where he think he might lose. so gracious.
People are brainwashed to think nothing can be worse than trump. Even if trump is as bad as some people think, Biden is inherently worse.
I fully support the republicans pulling back on giving money to the states and cities. Americans should not bail out democratic run states and cities who failed on funding their pension system. They give into unions for votes and now want is to bail them out. Hold firm Trump!
Trump will make Pelosi look stupid. She is playing politics with the stimulus package. Worst speaker of the house in my lifetime

I'm torn because Tencent is the largest corporation in China and likely got there through shady methods so I don't think Trump is on the wrong idea, but this is probably rough.
Alright now let‚Äôs talk about the accomplishments. He got us out one of the biggest recessions. He passed the Affordable Care Act which gave millions health care. He passed the Wall Street reform. Ended the Iraq war. We had a great economy which Trump took over.
We were talking about Trump but sure let‚Äôs bring up Biden since y‚Äôall know Trump is awful. No the 1994 bill was awful and unlike Trump supporters we accept what Biden has done wrong. Want to talk about the Obama administration and it‚Äôs accomplishments.
Trump was barely seen wearing a mask. He has a huge following and if he simply tells his followers to wear the damn masks we would be in better shape.
So no explanation of what Trump has done?
Thankyou lmao. I don‚Äôt even know why she brought up the minority part but I don‚Äôt understand how people can vote for Trump after what he‚Äôs done these past 3 and a half years
Thanks for brining up COVID. Trump mishandled it and caused our economy to sink. Hence why we are doing worst than other top country‚Äôs with COVID.
Almost 150k dead. Our economy is awful. Trump dosent care about anyone other than himself. I mean just listen to his latest interview done by HBO.
You can welcome tRump charities too   They both broke non profit rules.

Maybe he can hold his event in the Trump DC hotel, bill the campaign for the rooms and then bill us for the extra Secret Service costs.
Putin trolling trump
Trump took advantage of rampant undiagnosed mental illness before.
I don‚Äôt know..... it‚Äôs too fast. I think it‚Äôs a placebo mixed with bleach. I‚Äôll follow science and not trump.

Our nation run by trump is in shambles.
I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll vote against trump. She doesn‚Äôt want to piss off her republican friends.

Absolutely! When riots quiet, positive tests arrest, polls for Trump bump, and the pedos get exposed, the swamp-media-dark whatever will try to turn our gaze away!
Please Kanye fans, don't vote for him. Votes for Kanye will only help keep Trump in office. Kanye can't possibly win. He can't get on the ballot in all states. This is only ploy to take votes from Biden.
trump, Barr, what are you doing? Got caught with your pants down.
If we all bout a small book of stamps each month, the US Postal service could meet its payroll and expenditure demands without trump defunding.
So it is ok for Trump to ask that question?
If everyone could afford to, they could buy stamps via internet which would most likely keep the post office operational. That way the post office will not be underfunded when trump defunds them.
Are you guys capable of making, like, positive Trump ads instead of negative Biden ads? Or are you only able to lean on (manipulated) negativity because you know that Trump has done nothing positive?
This still isn't as bad as Trump many times a day.
Good, but If I were Biden I would demand that Trump reveal his tax returns or NO debates!
Imagine if Trump had said that to the host.
It's fun going back to early COVID pandemic episodes of  to see just how embarrassingly bad Trump was early on in the outbreak and to see how much  dunked on Trump/Pence over how obviously dumb they were.
Biden will crush trump in a debate.
trump, bleach, vaccine, Jim Jones, Purple Cool aid. No thanks... I‚Äôll listen to Fauci. Can‚Äôt trust trump. Devil himself.
If trump thinks that the virus is a hoax, why doesn‚Äôt he show up in public to give his acceptance speech in an enclosed auditorium?!?!
trump was talking with his genitals not generals. He gets confused sometimes.
Hopefully trump will go away
Obama had to deal with a housing market collapse that devastated the economy right as he showed up in office, so he had to deal with worse than the virus financially. The virus is only as bad as it is in America because Trump doesn‚Äôt know how to lead, so it exploded here.
Again, that's the weirdest slogan for an incumbent.  We intend to this November, regardless whatever subterfuge you have strategized.  1,000 deaths every day on trump's hands mismanaging pandemic to steal another election. #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory

Unlike Trump, Biden will hire the very best staff.
Have there *ever* been any Presidents' kids besides Amy Carter who attended a DC public school? The Trump, Obama, Clinton, Ford, Johnson and Coolidge kids all attended private prep schools. Maybe Taft's son? Any of TR Roosevelt's kids?
That says it all with trump and friends.

They should all be arrested and but in jail. The reply you are referring to also put no mention of politics only the original tweet. Even in the original tweet it simply stated it was a political statement, nothing about Trump
Wow! trump supporter I‚Äôm sure.
What‚Äôs trump gonna do?
So, since the Trump campaign decided to make a campaign ad that looks like a 90‚Äôs WWF PPV promo, I figured I‚Äôd go ahead and cast 90‚Äôs WWF wrestlers as the Trump stable.

I thought the Treasury department was independent from the executive branch!!!! I guess trump is using it as a cash cow!
If trump wins again it‚Äôll be worse. Biden will at least give us some normalcy with the government and the world. And start a road to recovery. It won‚Äôt be overnight though. Those that don‚Äôt vote either way just gave up our children‚Äôs future.

*Trump sorry I deleted that word from my keyboard.
Regardless of who started COVID (you know, the first victims), the issue is the fact that Trump has done a terrible job of actually containing the virus.
There's a lot of things Trump does that make me think "is he allowed to do that?" and apparently the answer is just always yes
There‚Äôs a chance he has and just doesn‚Äôt want us to know. It‚Äôs been in the White House by now, and Trump Jr‚Äôs girlfriend had it at some point, as has some of Pence‚Äôs staff.

If Trump gets his groove back‚Äîhis resiliency is remarkable and undoubtedly infuriates his foes‚Äîcalls to replace Biden will begin. It‚Äôs one thing for Biden to ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù against a president on the ropes from corona/crash/race war. It‚Äôs another to take on a reinvigorated Trump.
I‚Äôll trade you. I live in IL and debatin between writing in Bernie and voting Green. I want Trump to lose by the biggest pop. Vote total ever. I‚Äôll vote green to help with boosting a third party because it‚Äôs safe in IL to do so if you vote Biden to help w/ EC in a tighter state.
All previous norms went out the window with trump, the country will have to sink to depths unseen before they‚Äôre going to give up on their racist in chief. They‚Äôre clinging to his bigotry even harder than guns and their perverted interpretation of the Bible.
Ohhh but he does.. the racist, crook Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt give a damn about the little people..he made his son and brother millionaires.. btw, Trump was a billionaire and his family were millionaires BEFORE he ran for office.. name me one kind or generous thing Biden did for any1?!
Vote Trump out now!
I hope you get your wish but as we said on the Railroad, wish in one hand and shit in the other, see which one fills up first. I don‚Äôt know why anyone would vote Republicunt after Trump trashed our nation the way he has. Happy Birthday üéÇ!

Several points:  1. I don't value the word of Jeffrey Epstein.  2. There is no evidence.  3. Even if he had something to do with the creation of the foundation, that is basically irrelevant if he didn't run it.  4. I think it's likely that Trump and Clinton both are guilty

The only reason trump might be ignoring the bounties is he‚Äôs getting a kick back from Russia.
Because a Trump never lies. "Friend," huh? The only thing that makes it slightly believable is the exceptionally poor writing. Why are Republicans so bad at basic language skills?

what are the Democrats going to do about the US Post office and what they believe is happening from Trump's group of cronies we know they're sabotaging it we need all the Democrats to get up off their butts and do something now I'm so angry
President Trump, you can‚Äôt fix stupid!!
I heard that Trump has stopped tv ads. He wouldn‚Äôt do that unless he is going to pull out of the race. Forget what the campaign says. Out of character unless he wants to use his money for a different venture.
They weren't divisive to me, but then I'm not racist.  Trump was more divisive in his campaign than Obama was in 8 years and he us continuing to rip the country apart.
You mean trump right
Trump, Biden, and Sean Connery. I‚Äôm in
And date if they do mail-in voting this is how they will forestall Trump being president for the next four years, we need four more years to count the votes lol
I miss having a President that speaks to us Americans with intelligence and class, not with rage tweets... Barack Obama is a saint compared to Donald Trump and this is coming from a guy that absolutely hates politicians.
Massive delays hit postal service under Trump's postmaster-General

Difference between #Trump and Obama in terms of pandemics, #Obama saw the mistakes he made during #H1N1 and made a plan so it would not happen again. Trump dissolved this plan before this #pandemic even fucking started. Get real, republicans. ADMIT you are wrong. so is the cheeto
Notice it say 5 years of economic growth. FIVE! As in before Trump was elected. As in the Obama administration put measures in place to get our country out of a recession yet was pilloried by conservatives. I could go on but you know what that was about.
We didn‚Äôt always have schools and children were not as fat. Trump doesn‚Äôt process information well since his stroke. #TrumpHadAStroke #TrumpIsUnwell
I would bring in one tank to blow a hole in his new fence. Trump would shit himself and run (limp as fast as he can since his stroke) for the backdoor.
We need to take up a collection to rescue the Post Office, I get my meds from the VA by mail, if Trump does to the Post Office what he‚Äôs done to the VA, we‚Äôre all in trouble.
It means Trump has a 5th grade vocabulary and nothing else.
Final thought: Trump has a responsibilty to UNITE the people, and has done nothing but piss in every direction. A lot of Reps are pissed, a lot of Dems are pissed. Dudes bad news, after you sleep tonight, try to wake up. He is not your friend.
Let‚Äôs be very clear, this entire political system is a mess ON BOTH SIDES and trump has done nothing but make that worse. Period. I voted for him too before anyone calls me a bleeding heart liberal. His presidency ALONE has changed my mind (can‚Äôt speak for others), not the media.

I ‚ù§Ô∏èPresident Trump! He knows how to upset the Dems.. especially when it comes to his re-election!üòÇü§£
Trump is scared of getting voted out. He knows he fucked up the country's Covid response and is doing everything in his power to cover up his failure.
Quite a coincidence. Obama compares Trump to George Wallace at a funeral today and the NYT just HAPPENS to have a long article along the same lines with quotes from Wallace‚Äôs daughter. Like magic!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Now might be a good time to remind the other half of America that we felt the same way about Barack Obama that you feel about Donald Trump. We just were grown ups about it.

Fox's Chris Stirewalt: Trump Election Delay Shows Weakness
A number of congressional Republicans openly reject Trump's suggestion that November's presidential election should be delayed, a move that the President would have no authority to make
But it didn't. Trump did. Racist Trump. We'll wait while you let that sink in.
Listen to her. Just getting rid of Trump is NOT ENOUGH! It's time to hold the  accountable for their inaction as well as Republicans. Black people are tired of empty promises and bad policies from EVERYBODY. Listen to this if you REALLY care about Black lives.
You are right. The real surprise is that the whole Trump administration hasn't caught it.
This did not have to happen. He made the ultimate sacrifice--to Trump.
Donald Trump will probably be the last president of the united states
There are differences between "Trump can't legally", "Trump doesn't have the power" and "Trump literally has no avenue to make this happen". Delaying the vote falls into the latter category.
Donald Trump wanting to delay the election rather than have a vote by mail election just shows that he's scared of losing and is a corrupt mother fucker. America is much better off without him in office and that's a fact...
you don‚Äôt  know trump his mess with the democrats heads 62% of people polled say they  afraid to  voice their political opinions . Those are all Trump supporters .
As in the 2016 election, if Trump actually wins this one, I believe you are correct Wesley, it will just fade away.  Joe Biden et Al willtl fade away from public view and punishment.CORONAVIRUS TRUMP Sat, 8 Aug 2020 03:00:00 CDT

This is what I believed about the 2016 election: it was necessary to vote out Republicans across the board.  Instead we got stupid vote-swapping schemes, idiotic third party bids, ticket-splitting, and apathy, which delivered the White House and a pliable Congress to Trump.

Wrong! The Trump administration is bolstering Wall Street with favorable taxation and legislation. And, trying to destroy Main Street with authoritarianism.
That is going to backfire on trump big time. Just like when the repubs absorbed the green party tried to use them to draw votes away from Clinton back in 2016. There still are repubs and russians who hide in those groups I know this.
God has nothing to do with him or trump or his horde of criminal politicians.

I will resist the temptation to call my hubby's best friend. He calls me all the names Trump- lovers call us non-trump-lovers, but I'm better than that. I will enjoy his misery in silence.
I guess I need to be taught like a child lol. Did trump pay to get info/inside the ring of fire (so to speak)? Or am I not even close?
‚ÄúWhen people start paying attention after Labor Day, they will be expecting to see Share A Beer Joe and instead see Share An Ensure Joe.‚Äù Classic ‚Å¶ here
Senate primary centers on who‚Äôs the most loyal to Trump, his agenda. One candidate‚Äîa longtime Romney loyalist‚Äîreturned a contribution from Utah‚Äôs junior senator and called him as toxic as Obama to Tennessee‚Äôs GOP voters:
you can a interview with pelosi but you never get one with Trump and you think Biden is going to win  . Well let me tell you something . That bull market you talk about will be in the toilet if that happens . Chill boy
Just as tRump has destroyed the R‚Äôs - NOT pursuing this will destroy the D‚Äôs.  We will not stand for it again!
As George Reedy liked to say, Trump doesn‚Äôt know the difference between Karl Marx and Groucho Marx.
I think "The View's" Sunny Hostin is probably one of the only people surprised by this. I bet 10% of them told someone they were tired of Trump and won't vote for him again.
How about u two donate the 600+ million and just have your 3 debates and let us pick...   Trump tops Biden as both tout large July fundraising hauls
Sadly, Trump sees himself as only the president of the red states. Many of these states, however, are subsidized by blue state tax dollars. He chooses to not see this connection. A great leader is willing to do the hard work that is needed to unite a nation. Trump divides us.
If Trump is too cowardly to release his tax returns, he shouldn't be president.
If Trump accepts the  nomination from the White House are you going to prosecute him for violating the Hatch Act?
If you're a Trump supporter I don't think you want Epstein's client list exposed, your boy is very likely one of them.   Nah, he's probably wishing Maxwell well out of the "kindness of his heart," lol.
Omg the Trump campaign could have a lot of fun with this ad
Watch the reaction to this tweet. Tens of millions of Americans know what Obama/Biden did. They want justice not just for Trump but for the country. Senate Republicans may find this of little or belated interest‚Äîthey might learn the hard way how much this matters to us:
I know some people hate Trump but you want THIS GUY to be your President?? ü§Ø
Trump doesn't understand something he should as president. Weird, must be a day that ends in Y.
The video of George Floyd‚Äôs death is the catalyst for all that we see now... not Trump!  We knew who he was when he came into office &amp; he‚Äôs proved us right.  On the other hand, we have seen how truly spineless &amp; conniving Republicans are.  Is that due to the orange dude? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The BIG NEWS is how badly Trump dropped the ball on handling the Coronavirus. As a matter of fact, he couldn‚Äôt even find the ball because he never even looked for it.
Never!  Trump feeds off division
From their complete failure to hold accountable ObamaGate perps to their embarrassing capitulation on the left‚Äòs successful race/culture war and their refusal to back President Trump against the mob, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to make the case why the GOP should keep the Senate.
More lies and misinformation from your so-called ‚Äúgood brain‚Äù??  But then again, Trump only cares about himself. #BidenForPresident2020 #WeWillVote
Astonishing that Republicans are talking about Bruce Ohr without mentioning his wife worked FOR FUSION GPS on the anti-Trump project in 2016. Hello
Plot twist: Biden and Trump have a secret bet to see who can look more lost and still get elected president.
The dossier was discussed in the Oval Office on January 5, 2017. Comey told Obama he would brief Trump on the so-called pee tape:
laid the groundwork for ongoing legal saga Flynn and his family still deal with to this day. Yates tattled to Trump‚Äôs WH lawyer about Flynn, claimed he ‚Äúlied‚Äù to Pence and might be compromised, a target for blackmail by the Russians. Yates singlehandedly prompted Flynn‚Äôs demise.
Stop using words you don't know the meaning of.  Pop quiz: who was the first socialist?
So Ronna why is it okay in Florida? I am tired of hypocrites, the lying, the spinning, the division, the hate, the incompetence. Basically I am tired of Trump and the ass kissing GOP, like you. I think the majority of Americans are too. Trump and his enabling cronies are done.
The only reason trump might be ignoring the bounties is he‚Äôs getting a kick back from Russia.
Because a Trump never lies. "Friend," huh? The only thing that makes it slightly believable is the exceptionally poor writing. Why are Republicans so bad at basic language skills?
Except people are dying. Trump supports pedophiles and he is one himself. Lose the racism, get some self-respect, and you won't have to defend pedophile misogynists who mock the disabled. #calledout #owned #schooled
Trump supports pedophiles and is one himself. Just lose the racism and you won't have to keep trying to defend the indefensible. #racist #calledout
It would be, except that Trump supports pedophiles and is one himself. If I kill someone and then stop another killer, does that make it okay? We need to think just a bit beyond the surface.
Humanity? Trump? Projection is your only skill. Lose your racism. Gain some self-respect. Maybe then you'll feel your name is worth capitalizing. #calledout #owned
tRump-(or should I just say rump) ‚ÄúDoes this chair make my ass look big?‚Äù
Apparently Ben Sasse‚Äîlast heard from expressing his outrage that Trump wants to withdraw US troops from Germany bc it emboldens our foreign enemies‚Äîwas way too busy to attend this hearing on domestic threat of Antifa:
Is it to help Donald Trump?
At least 200,000 people will not have a chance to have that memory. They will he dead due to Trump‚Äôs lack of interest in taking a leadership role in fighting the deadly Coronavirus.
Trump: "They are dying. That's true. And you have -- it is what it is. But that doesn't mean we aren't doing everything we can. It's under control as much as you can control it." Our president just said it is what it is to 1,000 people dying a day. #NotMyPresident #Wow #GTFOH
I think Trump recently found out that many Republicans vote by mail. Now he needs to learn that they do this in many states. It  may take a few weeks for him to figure that out.
Yea but the difference is Trump is not at fault
Transalation. Governor told trump he will shut down all or most in person voting. Floridians better get their vote by mail on

Jesus Christ isn't helping you with the mental health issues you have, if you believe the garbage you're spewing.
Is that a graveyard for all the Trump fans that have died from covid?
You really, desperately need to see a mental health professional if you believe all that horse shit. If you don't really believe it, you're a shitty person trying to peddle it to the gullible and mentally ill.
What‚Äôs Trump gonna do- say ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre the puppet.  You‚Äôre the puppet.  You‚Äôre the puppet‚Äù again?  Remember that?  Because that was a real mature, dignified, presidential response, want it?
Are any of you voting for Trump for any reason other than just to piss off the liberals?
Well, . . just like I told you last week...  Of course, after Donald Trump's loss in November &amp; the backlash against you &amp; your company for your family's connection to Trump, I'll be laughing when your family's name is removed from WWE AND wrestling.
you need to rewatch the video of trump saying he could grab any woman by the pussy because he‚Äôs famous.Isn‚Äôt that a sexual predator or conspiracy theorists? He‚Äôs been a predator for years. Keep following him blindly. #Putin‚ÄôsBitch
Donald Trump: Billy Bush says infamous Access Hollywood 'grab them by the p***y' tape is real - ABC News
I don't expect Biden to do an interview with anyone involved with Trumps' campaign, and I don't get bothered by Trump not doing one with any of the MSM that is actually part and parcel of the Biden Campaign committee, and are riding interference to protect Joe from the public eye
Ask trump why he let over 156,000 Americans die? Ask him why he claims to support US troops but never confronted Putin when there was bounties on them? Or when he publicly shamed a decorated veteran because he didn‚Äôt vote for trump in 2016?
46 minutes? We have almost 4 years of Trump talking nonsense.
how you gonna for trump when you also have ‚Äúpositive vibes only‚ú®ü¶ã‚Äù in your ig bio ?
President Trump responds to investigation into Trump Organization: "This is a continuation of the worst witch hunt in American history."
I don‚Äôt want to see Trump do anything, let‚Äôs just vote.
I‚Äôm in total agreement, we saw Trump‚Äôs antics at the first election debates .
Please dear lord god never use the word "naked" in conjunction with Trump. I need to inject bleach into my brain after that.
Unbelievable the mayor has the gall to blame President Trump. If this idiot would the job of protecting the citizens, none of this would be happening. Unbelievable!
D.A. Is Investigating Trump and His Company Over Fraud, Filing Suggests
Trump says TikTok 'out of business' in US if not sold by around Sept 15
Trump made tic tok into an American business. He took it away from China and it‚Äôs not going anywhere
...who is the white supremacist that murdered nine African Americans at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C.  In any case, Trump is wrong on both counts.  As I have said ad nauseam the past few days, per the teachings of my Catholic faith (CCC 2267)...
...Instead, Trump's desire for the execution of Tsarnaev is motivated by his vengefulness and general infatuation for killing people.  For the same reason, I would strongly suspect that Trump is also for executing Dylann Roof...
Is Donald Trump's eagerness for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's execution really motivated by the fact that Tsarnaev is a Muslim?  While many would not put that past Trump given his Islamophobia, I really doubt that is the prime reason behind his desire to see Tsarnaev executed...
Wrong. Dems want to save lives. Trump and the GOP see school children as expendable commodities. How awful.
Translation:  must have said something that really irked Trump.
Trump just said: If you elect Joe Biden you will lose your windows and doors üö™
Are all of trump supporters mentally challenged? Why stand in front of your house with a confederate flag? Smh
Trump supporters believing they are above the rest once again...you are  transforming these idiots and making them think they are Nazi Germany over here... this man needs to be thrown in jail for life...#POS #POSPOTUS
...but even that does not make putting him to death an acceptable option.  Trump wants to put Tsarnaev to death because he is a simply vengeful person who likes the idea of killing people.  That attitude is in no way compatible with the teachings of Jesus.
Pointing out Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's evilness is an overstatement of the obvious, but why is Donald Trump so antsy to put him to death?  As previously stated, I am against Tsarnaev's execution solely based upon the teachings of my Catholic faith...

Who else is getting ready for tonight‚Äôs big reveal of   ‚ÄúThe Trump Health Care Plan‚Äù  It has the feel of ‚ÄúThe Oscars‚Äù. I in my tuxedo my wife in an evening gown watching tv and waiting, and waiting, and waiting. He said 2 weeks he would have it ready. You know he NEVER lies.
Last time I looked I didn‚Äôt see any Trump supporters burning, looting, killing what will you all do when he wins again,mabe drink the koolaid??
How is it everyday of the week kids, parents, friends etc can fill the malls but can‚Äôt sit safely in a classroom,? President Trump puts America first Pelosi puts Power and politics first she‚Äôs kidding herself if she thinks we don‚Äôt realize it!
My daughter is a high school teacher, they go back next week, only teachers in the building. It could all be done remotely but Trump is pushing for an opening so someone has to be sacrificed.
Get the moths out of brain didn‚Äôt you here the dems want a three trillion dollar stimulus? Another $600 plus weekly for people not to go back to work? You‚Äôre Trump hate is blinding you
Over 60 million people and rising have watched pres Trump fight tooth and nail for the American people he won the Presidency get over your shell shock start bracing yourself for another win! Now he has the police endorsement!
I‚Äôm just saying that trump is more worried about an APP because we ‚Äúruined‚Äù his rally than US troops having bounties on them. Trump is always talking about how much he cares about the military, but didn‚Äôt even confront Putin about it. So who‚Äôs really the Communist?
January started one of several travel bans creepy joe called pres trump a racist Pelosi marched arm in arm in china town they refused to call it the china virus does that tell you how the dems would have handled it?!!
If anyone says "I'm voting for Trump because he's pro-life," here's proof right here that he is anything but pro-life.  No one doubts that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be incarcerated for the balance of his natural life for the evil he did, but killing him IS NOT PRO-LIFE!
Mrs. Trump dos does not escape blame and scorn, any more than the other 2.
I do that all the time with someone I went to high school with over on Facebook.  He posts pro trump stuff and I take time out of my day to shit on it.
The Lincoln Project are single handily taking trump down. They give me life, as my daughter would say

Me looking at all the Trump hating on Twitter knowing damn well these geniuses are playing into his trolling and don‚Äôt even realize it:
Trump campaign must have figured it out. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs trying to get rid of tik tok... that won‚Äôt stop these beautiful children!
My idea was to bring in an M1 Tank, blow a hole in Trump‚Äôs new no climb wall, then film him shitting his pants as he runs out the back door.
HAVE NO IDEA WHO SHE IS BUT HELL ITS BEATS TRUMP OR BIDEN
Disagree. I won‚Äôt support ANYONE who supports Trump. I‚Äôve met Pence; nice man, terrible policy wonk.
What? The Bible is a BOOK! Why are you more upset about a BOOK than the 150,000 people trump killed
There will be hell to pay if trump goes through with this Tik Tok threat. Generation Z will collaborate a revenge on him like he has never seen before. His Aids better tell him. Bad idea
I‚Äôm just saying that y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt say anything when Russia hired people to kill US troops because trump didn‚Äôt say anything, but now that trump got his feelings hurt by an app he wants to ban it and y‚Äôall are agreeing. Nobody complained about it before trump did
Speaking of Steel Wheels.......      p.s. ....don't forget to pick up a few 7 layers at Taco Bell while they lastü§£
What about Amazon Alexa, Siri, Google homes? Y‚Äôall are more concerned with TikTok than your president ignoring Russia have bounties to kill US troops. Trump called Putin and he said ‚ÄúIT NEVER CAME UP‚Äù
What about Russia? Y‚Äôall were SILENT when Russia basically admitted to having bounties on US troops. Trump also said during an interview that he called Putin, and HE NEVER EVEN ASKED HIM ABOUT IT! HE SAID ‚ÄúIT NEVER CAME UP‚Äù

All good points. Trump‚Äôs primary motivation in life is vengeance against all who criticize or challenge him.
‚Äúirrelevant.‚Äù My book explains their contemptible role as useful idiots for the Left; their shameful attacks on evangelicals, pro-life students, and rank-and-file conservatives for supporting Trump. Perhaps one should read a book or at least be familiar with the subject matter...

He's not so terrified that he's rigging our postal system and having the gentleman who was given the job of month ago who has given the Trump party millions and millions of dollars to rig the system for November what is someone going to do about it
what are the Democrats going to do about the US Post office and what they believe is happening from Trump's group of cronies we know they're sabotaging it we need all the Democrats to get up off their butts and do something now I'm so angry
Standing shoulder to shoulder in Florida without masks. That Trump, he is a quick learner!
President Trump, you can‚Äôt fix stupid!!
I heard that Trump has stopped tv ads. He wouldn‚Äôt do that unless he is going to pull out of the race. Forget what the campaign says. Out of character unless he wants to use his money for a different venture.

Trump has failed at getting the virus under control. He thought he new best, but in not listening to the scientists all Americans will now continue to suffer the consequences of his epic failure.

Difference between #Trump and Obama in terms of pandemics, #Obama saw the mistakes he made during #H1N1 and made a plan so it would not happen again. Trump dissolved this plan before this #pandemic even fucking started. Get real, republicans. ADMIT you are wrong. so is the cheeto
Have you seen our latest news?
We didn‚Äôt always have schools and children were not as fat. Trump doesn‚Äôt process information well since his stroke. #TrumpHadAStroke #TrumpIsUnwell
I would bring in one tank to blow a hole in his new fence. Trump would shit himself and run (limp as fast as he can since his stroke) for the backdoor.
We need to take up a collection to rescue the Post Office, I get my meds from the VA by mail, if Trump does to the Post Office what he‚Äôs done to the VA, we‚Äôre all in trouble.
It means Trump has a 5th grade vocabulary and nothing else.
Final thought: Trump has a responsibilty to UNITE the people, and has done nothing but piss in every direction. A lot of Reps are pissed, a lot of Dems are pissed. Dudes bad news, after you sleep tonight, try to wake up. He is not your friend.
Let‚Äôs be very clear, this entire political system is a mess ON BOTH SIDES and trump has done nothing but make that worse. Period. I voted for him too before anyone calls me a bleeding heart liberal. His presidency ALONE has changed my mind (can‚Äôt speak for others), not the media.
Epstein files are released #BillClinton is DEFINITELY involved, and no articles. but you have time to post about trump and the virus? I‚Äôm a liberal, but come on guys, get your shit together.  everyone is talking about it. Your silence may scream complicity.

Laying the blame on Trump and his administration for the scourge that Communist China released on the world is fairly typical of the Marxist Democrats who instead of working with the administration, initiated many inane and failed investigations including a sham impeachment.
Yo what has Trump done for this country? Like dead ass I really want to know.
We need President Trump who is not afraid to rock the boat and to deal with these countries who take economic advantage of our nation. His predecessors were just too inept, too complacent and did not have the business acumen nor the balls to stand up and renegotiate trade deals.
Trump doesn't even hide it...  This old Marine is voting in person! F*CK THE VIRUS! F*Ck TRUMP! SEMPER-FI!!!
No, no, no.  The reason we have more cases is because we test more. Testing clearly causes the cases.  Thus sayeth trump.
I don‚Äôt believe those other countries are using HCQ at all.  That‚Äôs being touted only by trump.
Obamacare already does that. And let me head off the next "leadership" tweet: women and people of color already have the right to vote. Don't have Trump promise to soon grant these rights. üôÑ

Trump is an oaf, cheated his way into Wharton, went bankrupt, lies about his ill gotten gains, and traveled in a cloistered circle of syncophants.  And you are a convicted criminal who spent too little time in jail.
Huge news that happened in 2009-10! Huge thing that  already did that your putz of a President wants to repeal. Huge new lie to tell Trump‚Äôs base! Huge act of pathetic political theater!  Huge embarrassment for you, Jason. Where‚Äôs your self-respect? Who owns you? Sad.

The Trump Pandemic has now killed 164,093 Americans. #FailedPresident #TrumpVirus
One hand washes the other. Today's republicans don't believe in a republic; a gov't of, by, &amp; for the people. Trump believes in a gov't that serves him, and McConnell believes in a gov't that serves his power and donors. They only call themselves republicans.  They are oligarchs.
I wonder how long Trump will start calling him Lying Ted again?
Does Trump even care if there‚Äôs a desl? He‚Äôs (allegedly) the ‚Äúdeal-maker‚Äù - but can‚Äôt seem to be bothered to actually get involved.

Translation- Trump doesn‚Äôt care if states have resources to open schools safely
What about Kushner‚Äôs ‚ÄùDemocide‚Äù initiative? His team withheld help for Blue States thinking Dems would be killed off. It backfired. Trump's criminality will hurt Republicans, eventually.

We should all be embarrassed that China and Russia see our elections as some kind of proxy war. Any American president other than Donald Trump would be embarrassed, too. On November 3, we need to restore our place in the world.
And how many times did Trump bitch about President Obama signing Executive Orders??
They need jobs clubs are close. Doing it the right way. Trump needs a lesson
That Trump believes that Biden could "hurt God" exposes the shallowness, the superficiality, of Trump's own beliefs. Believers in God know that God is stronger than either Biden or Trump.
This is horrible- especially when Trump pardons real criminals.
No wonder Trump won't stand up to Putin!! (Beside the obvious fact that Trump is weak-willed.)
My dad got a purple heart for his bravery in WW2. He would be disgusted by Trump's politicization of the military. Have you talked to Putin about his bounty on our troops yet?

Trump‚Äôs committed so many crimes against humanity. This is genocide as well as ‚ÄùDemocracide,‚Äù which Kushner's report proves. They all need to be tried.
Is the suggestion that we're not smart enough to understand Trump? That's BS. Anyone in the world can look through his facade of "businessman/dealmaker" and realize he is simply an ignorant, incompetent cruel liar. Oh yeah - he's a fraud also, as proven in court!
None of this immoral, politically-driven conduct is excusable. DeSantis would rather have Trump's approval than to the right thing for his state's residents.   -- &gt; I'm sure glad I don't live in Florida!

It‚Äôs obvious that you believe by doubling down on the same racist rhetoric as trump, you will get re-elected, I‚Äôm here to tell you, I will be doing everything I can to stop that. Starting with supporting
Trump is the poster boy for ‚Äúnot all there‚Äù!
He‚Äôs going to win !!! The Dems cheated 4 years ago but they still couldn‚Äôt win. Wish I lived in a state where I could put up a trump flag and not expect my house to be set on fire, but the silent majority is out here waiting to vote. #Trump2020Landslide
The misinformation that Trump and team are sending out is Confusing and killing people. Not only should this be stopped but the Trump admin should be held responsible. Does he not care that 160,000 + have died, partially due to improper ‚Äúguidance‚Äù?
Trump remembers the full page ad he took out demanding the death penalty for 5 black men that didn't commit the crime they were accused of, right? And refusing to rent to black people for decades? Oh, but Joe said something dumb!
In the end Trump will be greatest thing ever to happen to American socialism as 1) evil gold-loving billionaire right out of central casting puts bad fave on capitalism 2) teaching 10s of millions the role of Prez is to aggressively intervene in free markets.
How is it that it is not safe for Trump go to his convention yet it is safe for children to go to school?
You also know that Trump cut off Federal funding for Chicago.
With tarriffs, tearing up trade deals, trash talk directed at companies and even literally hawking cans of beans from his desk IN The White House Trump is the most reckless invasive anti free market President of all time. $FSLY investors - and many others - will pay the price.
Did you arrange for a positive test result to get out of meeting Trump? Smart plan, it worked.
Oh but this must be fake news! Trump has assured us that children are immune to covid and just throw it off!
You make Her work for less than Trump spends golfing.
‚ÄúNot insinuating that all. Trump needs writers to make him sound sane.‚Äù  Trump needs to get his money back. It‚Äôs clearly not working.
SE and Meghan as well are test ballooning their excuses for when they eventually vote Trump. They got the love and attention they wanted from the left, now its time to return to their ideological home.

I have not read all the replies, but no one seems to have pointed out that the man was not speaking to a ‚ÄúThigh‚Äù audience, but an American one. His surrogate just told that audience they are dumb and Trump is always right. Way to win voters!
Four more years of Trump and we will be in a situation similar to Europe during the Black Death. Europe lost half it's population. Trump will do nothing to save us. Lies and inaction will turn America back to the Dark Ages. Is he worth it?
Mayra, you‚Äôre the sweetest.Thank you! Trump is not the only one that has to go!

Pretty sure Trump told him it would fight off coronavirus ... üòè
Just when I think  can‚Äôt be crueler than he already is, he attacks a devout Catholic saying Biden will hurt g-d. Trump is beyond contempt but I still feel he will hijack the election.
If there‚Äôs a god, she laughs that Trump think he‚Äôs can hurt her.
The fun part of all of this: The POTUS can only pardon Federal crimes. The state of New York has been waiting patiently on Mr. Trump...
That is what he said. He lucky it‚Äôs trump he is against

I can't wait for the GOP and the Trump campaign to imply that Hunter Biden was at the bottom of this scandal... it's coming soon!
Why would anyone think Trump's unlikely promises are politically motivated???
Don't forget that Trump, when pressed in a recent interview, couldn't name a favorite Bible verse, or even if he prefers the Old or New Testament. He said he likes them all equally, but it seemed clear he just had no idea of a legit answer (about what he claims is his fave book).
I see.  This seems pretty on brand for Trump then.
Meghan and S.E. are Never Trumpers until it comes time to actually vote out Trump and then its "Heavens no, how can I go against my Republican values!"
We are paying for Mexican imports through USMCA and no new walls . Trump just replacing existing barriers.
I would wait ANY amount of time to vote Trump out.
trump is the most un-American president in U.S. history. He attacks almost every democratic institution. He no morals &amp; no ethics.
They should make a commercial about all the "god" things Trump has given us... except maybe the evangelicals will read that literally.   Fuck people are stupid.
If I say, "Trump's a fucking moron."  The focus is on my frustration.    If I say "Trump's a moron", that leaves open the ability to see the damage to the country and consider remedies. The argument is the same, but the way expressed has consequences.
Trump doesn't do gaffes. Trump out right lies.
. really needs to know the VP pick though before voting for Biden over Trump.
Can you state the racist shit trump has said . I wil wait
Did Trump and Biden have an in-depth religious discussion where they gave their viewpoints on God and Jesus? It seems one lives the life Jesus preached; the other is the antithesis of anything Jesus stood for.
Trump‚Äôs administrative tadpoles are everywhere.
We need a national dose of collective anti-trump Imodium for all his sh*t!
Funny, wonder if the Left would prefer that Trump, too, were ....  unmasked.
Honestly, those even considering not voting against Trump don't deserve to be kowtowed to or even considered. It is absolutely irrational under any semblance or shade of conservatism to help Trump. Maybe I'd rethink that position if Warren or Bernie were on the D ticket.
I agree. The benefit of Susan Rice is we get to Russia/Syria/NATO/foreign policy. Which, for Trump, has been a complete and utter total disaster.
Feeling I get about the biggest #Resistors is they are in these types of households--rich former Bush voters in 50s and 60s where the wife has defected bc Trump is too icky
Now do Trump Foundation.
Because moron, they actually donate to good causes. They have an incredibly high rating. Unlike the Trump foundation which had to close down because of fraud.
What‚Äôs that racist sheriff name who loves trump,again
Yes that where they began but grand poopoo David duke love trumps. Racist marching with tiki torches loves trump.
Apparently conservatism and pragmatism are mutually exclusive for you. Another 4 years of Trump will annihilate your conservative ideals.
Trump: "Biden is against God." Biden: "Sorry I didn't immediately respond to our lying, misleading Tweet.  I just returned from Church." Trump: "Hush, this is an important putt!"
No one is going to please everyone. No one is going to be perfect. And no one is Pence or Trump besides those imbeciles.
With Trump in power? What the fuck?
I just got off the phone with God.   He says He's getting a record number of complaints about Trump and wishes He had never created the whole damned Trump family.   God said something about Beelzebub, and how he continues to cause nothing but trouble, but it's beyond His control.
No one knew how cheap trump was to buy. Corrupt like the world has. Never seen.
Dumb as hell but compare to trump.
Dude check my feed. Look at how people is upset at what Biden said but was like fuck it compare to trump. Feel free to she how the 98% live
Why do you post these inane headlines? This is not news. You are spreading falsehoods. Have you covered whether Trump has ever been known to be a church member or church-goer during his adult life? Biden has been a devout Catholic his entire life.
Dan, check the story behind ur claim as it‚Äôs the total opposite of what the propaganda machine has feed u, trump was the first person to go to the authorities re Epstein being a pedo. Search palm beach news, espstein got out smarter by trump on a real estate deal. 5d chess.

Who said it wouldn‚Äôt but compare to trump it will be minimal and also coming from trumpkin doesn‚Äôt help either. Just saying
Nice that anything done poorly was the fault of "the governors" and anything positive was Trump. I'm not sure that's how things really work here in the real world.
Nice to see Trump will ONCE AGAIN be playing golf and enriching his own company rather than doing the work of being President.  #VoteDEM2020

Seems pretty clear that Trump never watched this interview - he seemed ill-informed, argumentative, and in general, an ignorant buffoon.  Maybe it was "fair" after all!
We‚Äôll need our guns when Trump cheats to get elected.
Trump doesn‚Äôt believe black lives mater, my lesbian ass rights or my rights as a woman. There is that and only that
Dumbest move ever, starting to think you were pressured into this. This will definitely give people a reason to vote for Trump
What timing, you‚Äôre going to win the election for Trump with this
Trump love the confederacy so please explain and called it his heritage
Trump don‚Äôt give a fuck about anyone.
The reason is because trump suck so bad. My point is stop lying and making excuses for voting for the racists. I am making any excuse for the white moderate

No need for the Debates either. Hey, Trump already said HE might not go because reasons. Now that Joe is the candidate and Trump WANTS to debate ... too bad, so sad. Hide in basement, take the W, get inaugurated, resign shortly thereafter...
Trump entire life is racism or did your think it started in 2009. Think about if democrats are racist trump was the biggest one and an anti Semitic and non religious ass. So at least we real and don‚Äôt front like he is holier than thou
4 chain and 8 chain racist loves trump. If the racist loves democrats and they where racist that same concept is being applied to trump currently.
Trump loves the kkk is endorse and voted for him. So why the fuck you crying about Z

Senator Ron Johnson is a pathetic joke. He does zilch for his constituents and Americans in general - he's just worried about what Trump wants.
No, not illegal at all. Completely disengenuous. From a racist mind set. And motivated by a desire to pull voters in key states from Biden.  It's gonna fail just like everything else Trump and his people try. But, we gotta fight like they are gonna win to make sure.
Can anyone imagine what America will look like 4 years from now if Trump is re-elected? The Black Plague killed half of Europe in the mid 1300s. Trump is doing nothing to stop deaths. America will resemble the Dark Ages.
This whole attack on USPS is purely political - no question about it.  What kind of adult supervision is in place to restrain Trump's "Chumpmaster General"?
Are you suggesting Trump is a liar? 3 weeks ago we were promised his "beautiful" health-care plan in 2 weeks. Also... crickets.   Literally nothing he has promised has come to fruition - certainly not anything important.
Jason Miller must not have the mental ability to recognize that Trump has no mental ability.
Yeah right! It‚Äôs nothing as usual. I hope they lock Trump up one day soon!
Biden knows how to interpret pandemic charts without help from journalists. Trump‚Äôs constant, chronic lying and rambling, incoherent statements shows that he has no brain capacity.
Talk is cheap, money is not. Trump has a very long history of not paying his bills, so we shouldn't be surprised. But why would the city host him again BEFORE that last bill is paid?

Hillary was grilled for 11 hours and found no wrongdoing. Trump has the top scientist in the world telling him to shut down the country and he refused to do it because he didn‚Äôt want to believe them and now look where we are at. I‚Äôd say he committed a worse crime.

None of that matters because they have plans to cheat. Trump needs to know final vote tallies on November 3rd so he can hack the totals.  Trump is telling us how he's going to cheat every single day. We need to listen.

But both are abhorrent are they not? You're right trump has more power and influence with his racism. But Farrakhan also comes from his own position of power, however insignificant it is compared to trump. And his racism must be equally unacceptable.

Are you suggesting Trump is a liar? 3 weeks ago we were promised his "beautiful" health-care plan in 2 weeks. Also... crickets.   Literally nothing he has promised has come to fruition - certainly not anything important.
#EDITORIAL  Trump unfit to be president  I have over 60,000 #free #eBooks including #Frankenstein by #MaryShelley
Talk is cheap, money is not. Trump has a very long history of not paying his bills, so we shouldn't be surprised. But why would the city host him again BEFORE that last bill is paid?
This was laugh out loud funny.
Rather have a successful civilian like President Trump!  School principle?  US education ranks 38 out of 71 industrialized countries?  20 yrs ago, US was #1.  Democrat run academia is an abysmal failure.  No child left behind, means HS grads can't read.  No grading k-12, now no
Those 2 people helped to enable trump at every turn.
Left constantly referring to President Trump as dictator or Nazi?  Who is actually hiding the truth?  President Trump is out there every day, answering questions from MSM.  When Democrats have something to answer for, MSM goes dark.  Must have loyal MSM for totalitarian Gov?
is an idiot. Promoting conspiracy theories is beneath the office of the presidency. It's shameful and dishonest.  Trump: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm doing the country a big favor‚Äô with my conspiracy theories about voter fraud
Lincoln Project ad burns ‚Äòpampered princeling‚Äô Jared Kushner as Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòSecretary of Failure‚Äô

is a fake president.   ‚ÄòJim Acosta is a fake reporter!‚Äô Trump angrily denies reports that he ‚Äòstill doesn‚Äôt get‚Äô coronavirus threat
Hillary was grilled for 11 hours and found no wrongdoing. Trump has the top scientist in the world telling him to shut down the country and he refused to do it because he didn‚Äôt want to believe them and now look where we are at. I‚Äôd say he committed a worse crime.
jan. is a long time to wait without a national testing &amp; tracking system. How many more people have to die before trump admits he make the same mistake China did, what any autocratic government does: deny. Yet, unlike the Chinese that went on for weeks, trump is going for months
Definitely not an opportunity to build a new FBI building in walking distance to trump's hotel either? To line *45's, Jared &amp; ivanka's pockets even further? Am I correct  ??
trump is manipulating and burying things and classifying things and hiding things so he can cheat his way to the very end of his term.  Then... we're gonna get him.  Cannot wait.  And Biden will NOT pardon him.
Are you crazy? There were 4 deaths in Benghazi, because of Trump‚Äôs ineptitude and claiming it was a hoax there are close to 160k deaths. He won‚Äôt be forgotten at the polls. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #ByeDon2020
Trump cares more about the legality of mail-in ballots than he does about COVID19. People see right through that, too.
This isn‚Äôt fake news!  What do you have to say about it President Trump? Don‚Äôt deny!  I heard you say it!
'There's anger there that people don't see': Rattled Trump launches attack on Obama after former ...  via  donald trump now has the opportunity to eulogize Herman Cain
Eminent domain is socialism. Ergo, Trump is a socialist.
What is ‚Äúconservative‚Äù about eminent domain? Trump is even more socialist than Bernie Sanders.
I have to say, the moment this Trump donor was nominated for Postmaster this was the inevitable and predictable outcome.  This unqualified political hatchet-master general should resign yesterday and let someone competent do the job.  Don't wait til he tries to sell off USPS!!!
I think everyone knows it's illegal but Trump and Meadows.
Only accused felons get "wished well" by Trump.
I can't wait til Trump goes away!
Wear did the IMPOTUS get his legal advice from? Rudy?  I would wait till someone with more knowledge of the situation. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt take Trump‚Äôs word for it
Your "low-grade depression" is because our MAGA President Trump has REVERSED the destructive policies of the years 2008-2016!
I was president of the DePaul College Republicans. I voted for Johnson in 2016, because Trump supports eminent domain, protectionism, and massive deficit spending. Since then, Trump has only gotten worse and the GOP has been enabling him. I‚Äôm voting for all Democrats this year.
His statements all come down to...if folks are allowed to vote, Republicans will never hold office. His action of suppression backs up that theory. The people of the US despise trump.
Opinion: This is one of the most unpatriotic moments in Trump's presidency - CNN  A rambling imbecile...that‚Äôs the only way I can describe this.
Trump‚Äôs gang simply has no bottom.  Period.
You think trump cares? These are just the side effects of him screwing the post office.
How can Trump, who clearly has less than zero credibility opine on the credibility of a well-respected career DOJ employee.  Trump will sink to any depth, and insult anyone about any topic. He is disgusting.
Maybe West will be trump's VP pick
I really think trump thinks we are doing so much better than any other country. Delusion
Clearly Trump has no idea what he's looking at in that clip... but I'll forever remember that brief exchange... Trump: "you can't do that" Swan: "WHAT CAN'T I DO THAT?"  And of course no relevant response from Trump.
I can't even imagine. People losing both parents. How do you survive that? And we are telling teachers to up their life insurance policies? Really? And I watched trump compare our testing to India? How the mighty have fallen.
What does that say about the incumbent?  That someone that is "in hiding" is a better choice for president that trump... that's what it says.
This is not a crime, this is exactly why we have elections.  The people elected President Trump, to change the course and policies of the United States.  Democrats didn't like that!  Democrats assumed policy continuation was certain under Hillary. Shocking degree of corruption!
They all went rogue!  Obama, Biden, Yates, Clapper, Brennan, Comey, Rosenstein, McCabe &amp; Stroyk.  This is the darkest period in American history, a single party corrupted our justice dept &amp; our election system. Sally Yates just testified, Trump was undercutting Obama policies?
Did IMPOTUS ask the money to be transferred to TRUMP MANAGEMENT or directly into his personal account at Deutsche Bank
Seems like  conducted a master class in interviewing. He read the charts, and called out what he saw - clearly Trump didn't understand the charts, which is scary in itself.  When is Trump scheduled to sit down w/Swan for Part 2???
And how many students returning to school prematurely will "go away" after they die from coronavirus? How many teachers and school staff?  How many kids will bring the virus home to parents and/or grandparents. Trump is incapable of thinking this far ahead - but we all have to!
He was "not asked to do anything" - good to know that DeSantis is not capable of doing anything on his own initiative. I'm sure he heard how bad Florida's system was, and he didn't care to address it. (Maybe on orders from Trump?)
Education is essential, not these Liberal Progressives who radicalize our kids; teach Socialism and Racism.  President Trump was right again, when he passed School Choice.  Use it!  Essential conditions for Teachers Unions?  Medicare for all and 116b to Teachers Union, baked into
Trump doesn't understand anything about National or world issues. He only reads what he's given by Kushner or Miller. He's not very good at the reading part either.
But Vance in NY can still get him!  And I sure hope he does - Trump is a habitual liar and crook and must be held accountable one way or another.
Of course, how could anything Obama does or says be anything else? Trump is super-jealous of Obama, simply because he doesn't measure up.
Exactly. I'm tired of hearing about it. The DNC are really ticking me off lately. Biden can't pick anybody that doesn't have "baggage." If not, &amp; the perfect running mate is out there, Trump's goons will just make something up anyway.
Clearly the GOP has nothing to offer voters in 2020 beyond the tired old attacks and tropes from 2016... and there's that coronavirus thing - how's that working out for Trump?
Everyone should find Trump's insane claims offensive. He's done little for anyone but the Trumps and the Kushners, and he'll leave our nation in ruins after his dismal failure on coronavirus.
Of course, because Trump sues anyone and everyone.
Trump will take that grudge to his grave... Why? Because it's all about Trump, no one else matters.
I can only dream about a future where we don't have to hear the lies and made-up BS Trump spews all day. Please, everyone vote so we can end this national disgrace that is the Trump Presidency!!
Is Ivanka or Melania under the desk with tRump?üò≥
If Biden does not say that, how can Trump hear it?? Unless, of course, he's lying. Again.
Lies! Lies! Latino, as well as every other minority, had the lowest unemployment  in "history."   Blacks, women &amp; students, all setting employment records.  President Trump did it once, &amp; he will do it again, post virus.  New jobs coming home, include PPE &amp; drug production.  MAGA
Hopefully, trump will go away
Is trump saying he is very angry inside
No, she's practicing being presidential, for when she becomes trump's VP pick
I can see how some people might think trump put Swan in his place, but that would require people to believe the president's gibberish. I've heard three year olds have a better logical grasp of reality than trump
This won‚Äôt save him. #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything #obama #trump #indict #confession
#SkeletonsInTheWhiteHouseCloset  There was This One Time at Trump Band Camp.
it‚Äôs gonna happen again isn‚Äôt it  (extra scared cuz I‚Äôve seen the stuff about Trump not accepting the results if he loses)
They're from the virus. The 1000 US deaths a day. While Trump Golfs and says "It is what it is" when asked about the 1000 Coronavirus US deaths a day. Hospitals are overwhelmed, people like you are down playing the risk, tRump is ignoring his responsibilities and playing Golf.
"The rally turned out to be a Blue Lives Matters meet up where individuals flew Trump 2020 flags and a Confederate Flag, Once we realized the deceit and false information, our staff and Senior Pastor,,, immediately asked the individuals to shut it down and leave..."
Hahahahahahahaha! Gabbard was a tRump plant in the primaries. Always on Fox "News" and whining like Donald that her coverage was unfair. Gabbard was rejected by Dems because she was Racist! Try to follow along. Hahahahahahahaha.
I'm waiting for trump to mention the Titons.
Trump Pronounces Yosemite as ‚ÄòYo Semites‚Äô
Trump will never do another interview other than Fox / Hannity ever again. He‚Äôs normally so coddled and protected that he forgot what it‚Äôs like to be asked real questions.
Hey Joe, continue to let that black face mask hang off of one ear and you'll look like a comedy character out of the Sunday "funnies!" In plain English, you are dumb and stupid for allowing the radical left to hijack your campaign. But we love it! Trump 2020, Victory!

Did he enjoy the new orange suit Trump bought him?
Everybody in Spinal Tap were towering intellectuals compared to trump
Trump has the 15 minute tests at the White House
I used to think trump was an expert Machiavellian instigator that could spin raw data in order to make bad news look good for his base, but now I'm thinking he's just one stage above full-blown dementia
Please Mr.Trump, do more to end this virus...you are the leader of this country....if you are unwilling or unable to do so, please leave your position.
Don't sign Omnibus Heroes Act!  They are printing money to buy votes.  This is not emergency measures, this is Christmas for Democrats.  Let them swing in the wind, we are behind you and President Trump!
If Harris is the VP, then Schiff could be appointed to the Senate and the Senate Intelligence Committee. That would get him media coverage in the campaign and with Biden getting much less coverage than trump, Schiff getting air time would be a big plus
That's how trump stimulated the economy, even before the virus, by drastically reducing the interest rate that the Fed charges and by pouring massive amounts of borrowed cash into the economy
I used to think that trump was a Machiavellian genius that was tricking the simple-minded by twisting facts, but now it's very obvious that he's just plain slow
I'm beginning to think that trump really believes this nonsense. I thought he was a Machiavellian expert that was cleverly confusing the issue for his rather slow base, but it turns out that he's really just dumb
It's like they're begging for another terrorist attack just so they can blame it on Trump. Cuz ya know, nothing else has worked.
This election is between trump and Biden. Not Hillary, Obamam or Pelosi.   We've seen what Biden did as VP for eight years. We've seen what trump has NOT done in the past nearly 4 years. Before this country is destroyed, we must make a choice.  I've made mine.
And I am not accusing him of not supporting human rights prior to this. But, to see him kneel during the national anthem and making this statement after once having Donald Trump on his mask is where the change is made.
Typical tRump bull shit dog whistle.  He needs to clear this up but he won't.  He wants the racists to know he's with them but he can't come out clearly either way Yet. It's pretty clear if you're paying attention.
David Duke endorses tRump. No surprise, We are numb to this shit.
We should go out to some desert wasteland and dig a big, deep hole - that should be named for Trump. Both his head and his heart are just big, dark, empty columns of nothingness and narcissism.  "The Donald Trump Memorial Black Hole" sounds about right....
Watching this interview and paused where Jonathan swan says thousands of Americans are dying every day and Trump replies it is what is is.
Trump is right. Let‚Äôs all do absentee voting. The perfect compromise. #TrumpThreatensAmerica #DangerousIdiot
This is INCREDIBLY ALARMING!! Republicans know they can‚Äôt win if people vote. They stole the vote in 2016, they can steal it again this year. Trump is correct, this could be a the most corrupt election ever, but not for the reasons he‚Äôs stating.Acosta is one of the most clueless tone deaf DNC propagandist in all of media. He keeps proving Trump is dead on correct on MSM
‚ÄòNew‚Äô is that the Trump campaign was contacted and they took the meeting and did not bother to inform FBI. I understand the collusion is not proven. Its possible that they really did not collude in legal sense, but more likely it could not be proven because inv was obstructed. /1
#TrumpVirus 161,250 deaths on trump's hands mismanaging pandemic to steal another election.  Murderer.

Trump is in court trying to kill affordable care and pressure existing conditions. This executive order comment is complete BS.
Trump is a serious threat to Americans.
Tucker  Carlson sounds like he is voting for Kanye West. Not Donny Trump. I bet Don is going to be pissed.
Yeah and trump demeans them.
Trump is going to give tons of money to Beirut, a terrorist hotbed, but blocking relief money for Americans out of work.
While this is a step in the right direction, Facebook and other social media companies like Twitter and Youtube need to take greater responsibility for the spread of misinformation on their platforms.
Stay out of it trump. You‚Äôll only screw it up.
Where are the republican leaders from the congress? Vote them out of Congress along with Trump.
He‚Äôs retaliating because the Canadian government is cracking down on Americans defying their coronavirus laws. Trump pulled troops out of Germany for duets he bank following subpoena on trump
trump and his followers.
Dream on trump
Libs insisted that trump was killing kids when he said that schools should reopen.  Let‚Äôs see what they have to say about the Love Gov saying the same thing
That‚Äôs not the way to get more votes trump. At least he doesn‚Äôt lie like you. Where‚Äôs the medical insurance thing you promised in a couple weeks that‚Äôs past due?
Trump is allowing thousands of black people to be killed by his police forces and has a bunch of POC trapped in cages rn. Obama wasnt perfect, but Trump is terrifying
Draft dodging coward Trump should never comment on our heroes. It‚Äôs insulting.
Why would Trump do that when he did the same thing personally against Obama.
If anyone embodies pure idiocy it‚Äôs Trump. In fact, if you look up use idiocy in the dictionary a photo of Trump pops up.
Trump has a lot of nerve after he said thigh land and yo Semite.
No because Chuck Todd will ensure that the public knows ‚ÄúPelosi doesn‚Äôt want to kick people out of their house‚Äù and the lawsuit is really about ‚ÄúTrump and his cronies trying to kill people‚Äù by not spending $3,000,000,000,000 we don‚Äôt have.

And he's ahead of Trump, too.
If Trump doesnt do it who will.
President Trump stays strong because the faithful have surrounded him with a hedge of protection through prayer!‚ô•Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üôè
Trump is not worthy of anyone‚Äôs vote. Black, white, yellow or red. We all need to vote out Trump.
trump cares about the election so much he's willing to help kanye get on ballots in states where he think he might lose. so gracious.
People are brainwashed to think nothing can be worse than trump. Even if trump is as bad as some people think, Biden is inherently worse.
I fully support the republicans pulling back on giving money to the states and cities. Americans should not bail out democratic run states and cities who failed on funding their pension system. They give into unions for votes and now want is to bail them out. Hold firm Trump!
Trump will make Pelosi look stupid. She is playing politics with the stimulus package. Worst speaker of the house in my lifetime
Well, when you have people like this making Donald Trump out to be immortal, we are screwed as a society.
I know all about the past, believe me. But what‚Äôs diff now is that he is rectifying those mistakes by having comprehensive plans for POC. Trump, on the other hand, has a history of overt racism that is carried into his presidency, with no evidence that it will change.
If Trump did pray, in his mind, would he not be talking to himself?

There is no way Trump will lose, the democrats having given Trump supporters the will to make sure that happens, thank you!

Not sure what coulution is. If you mean collusion, yes, there are many examples. Every time Trump says there isn‚Äôt you know there must be.

President Trump gives remarks at Ohio Whirlpool Corp. plant | USA TODAY  via
The cult of Trump
I'm torn because Tencent is the largest corporation in China and likely got there through shady methods so I don't think Trump is on the wrong idea, but this is probably rough.
Alright now let‚Äôs talk about the accomplishments. He got us out one of the biggest recessions. He passed the Affordable Care Act which gave millions health care. He passed the Wall Street reform. Ended the Iraq war. We had a great economy which Trump took over.
This is the price we pay for the electoral college electing Trump.
We were talking about Trump but sure let‚Äôs bring up Biden since y‚Äôall know Trump is awful. No the 1994 bill was awful and unlike Trump supporters we accept what Biden has done wrong. Want to talk about the Obama administration and it‚Äôs accomplishments.
He passed along the costs to the tax payers. Trump says other countries pay the tariffs. He is outright lying. We just pay higher prices.
Trump doesn‚Äôt want any immigrants. Why doesn‚Äôt this guy know that Trump is going to try and ship him back to his country of origin?
Nice picture. Do you really believe there was a global effort to get Trump and McCain was part of it?
The intelligence agencies may have been little too aggressive in investigating the Russian angle, but there is no proof yet that they targetted Trump without reason. Almost 4 years of Trump/Barr investigation has proven nothing except procedural errors
Russian meddling in our election is proven fact. Even republican senate confirmed it. Trump appointed intelligence officers have confirmed the same. It is also proven that some within Trump orbit were talking to Russians. Was there a collusion/conspiracy? I don‚Äôt know. /1
My nephew and his gurlfriend moved to Texas from Shit Seattle and they are voting blue.... pisses me off. Because they hate Seattle cause its dirty but blame Trump. Indoctrination!
Trump was barely seen wearing a mask. He has a huge following and if he simply tells his followers to wear the damn masks we would be in better shape.
So no explanation of what Trump has done?
Thankyou lmao. I don‚Äôt even know why she brought up the minority part but I don‚Äôt understand how people can vote for Trump after what he‚Äôs done these past 3 and a half years
If it's a wave election, Trump wins KY by 10.
Nope. False. If Trump wins, everybody loses except his supporters. If Biden wins, not everybody automatically wins, but at least people of color like me have a shot.
Thanks for brining up COVID. Trump mishandled it and caused our economy to sink. Hence why we are doing worst than other top country‚Äôs with COVID.
Almost 150k dead. Our economy is awful. Trump dosent care about anyone other than himself. I mean just listen to his latest interview done by HBO.
He's thinking better than Trump!
When Republicans do something to denounce Trump while he is still in power and actually do something about holding him responsible for his actions. Your dumb support for the GOP is disgusting.
I think the same.  President Trump is not a quitter. And he is now the most powerful person in the world, with a great chance for the reelection.
You can welcome tRump charities too   They both broke non profit rules.
i just saw my first trump flag in schaumburg i-
Any other POTUS would have better utilized this act. Trump completely mismanaged it.
Does Trump mean the kind of patriotism where you serve your country in the military? That‚Äôs not Trump. He is a coward draft dodger.
Until March Trump has been kissing China‚Äôs ass. The only reason he turned against them is the virus Trump completely mismanaged.
He could be a Satanist, I would still vote against Trump
True, but it does mean that there should be consequences to treasonous acts against the American people.  Replace trump, McConnell, Graham, &amp; the Russian 8, and then we can talk about reviving the  #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

The NRA is a corrupt non profit organization kinda like tRump charities
The dems are for one thing and they will destroy the country because you people are so stuborn. Give it up, you make people more pro-Trump and therefore Trump will win in November, thank you!
President Biden will be your President too. He will do much more for you than Trump but you won‚Äôt admit it. Just sit back and enjoy.
Trump has lost his stones. His true wussy colors are popping through. Just like the draft dodging coward he is.
Who‚Äôs not all there? Trump is not all there. That‚Äôs why he was forced to take a mental test. Someone must have been giving him the answers in order for this loon to pass it.
My thoughts are crystal clear. Trump is a draft dodging coward who has told more lies than the last 4 in aggregate. He is responsible for 150,000 lost lives, the worst deficit in history and the just reported worst quarter in history.
The Trump administration investigation into the Clinton foundation found no wrong doing. No evidence supports your claim.
"To hobble the U.S. Postal Service ...would be an obvious strategy of a terrorist group or a foreign adversary. It also appears to be the strategy of the president of the United States."
What a #coward trump is.  He lies with such ease it's disgusting.  #trumpisalier
Maybe he can hold his event in the Trump DC hotel, bill the campaign for the rooms and then bill us for the extra Secret Service costs.
Putin trolling trump
1st order of business, Trump is elected. 2nd order of business, republicans take house back
Trump took advantage of rampant undiagnosed mental illness before.
I don‚Äôt know..... it‚Äôs too fast. I think it‚Äôs a placebo mixed with bleach. I‚Äôll follow science and not trump.
President Trump cannot pick and choose which facts are true and which are fake: the US has 4% of the global population and 25% of #COVID19 cases. We are not doing better than other countries.
So are trump and republicans.
Our nation run by trump is in shambles.
I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll vote against trump. She doesn‚Äôt want to piss off her republican friends.
Trying to control judicial process. Shame on trump and cronies.
Let‚Äôs do a fact check on this video. trump manipulated images of Biden.
When Trump was ahead in the polls he planned to skip the debates. Now that he is losing so badly he wants them. Too bad for Trump.
Donald Trump is a criminal.  #DonsNextCon  Also, if you think trump is responsible for pandemic mismanagement, reply with #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory  ...go ahead. Just admit it. #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory

Trump is above the law
Trump has screwed more allies than anyone in history. He has also made the office he serves a laughingstock the world over.
The grossly incompetent one is Trump. We have never had a POTUS as incompetent as Trump.
My caucasian cousin just said, ‚ÄúTRUMP 2020‚Äù üôÉüëéüèº
This is what happens when you put an idiot in charge of the well being and security of a nation. Trump wanted HCQ, the govt had to buy it to soothe his ego and now they are going to promote it, damn the scientist And if 100s of thousand americans die, thats just an inconvenience
Belated thought... Did Trump also think this cartoon character's name was Yo-Semite Sam?
I mean Trump is friends with the same Mf.
You used to just be an annoying idiot. Now? 158,000 deaths on trump's hands mismanaging or gaming pandemic to steal another election. Murderer.  #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory #25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #WeStillShootTraitorsDontWe?
How does someone who advises our President on a daily basis have time to earn this kind of money? Illegally and through major corruption. These 2 will join Trump in prison next year.
In other words, swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona shouldn‚Äôt vote for Trump because he could care less about them.
Trump plans to screw over everyone by cutting the benefit to 1/3 what it was.
Our country is run by Repub Trump &amp; over 1,000 people per day are dying from the Trump Corona Virus. We have the highest deficit in history, we just posted the worst quarter in history and Trump touts a drug that does more harm than good. I‚Äôd rather have demonstrators than die.
It is a good one , Trump did answer good , later on when they going to come back and ask  him again , he will say I I did tell you I will do whatever I can , total transparency. There you go , people who are awakened do know about UFO's ,  rest they can stay sleeping , lol .
This the real Trump!
Florida: sets new record for COVID hospitalizations Trump: ‚ÄúThis is going away‚Äù
The only way to drain the swamp is to get rid of Trump.
Please Kanye fans, don't vote for him. Votes for Kanye will only help keep Trump in office. Kanye can't possibly win. He can't get on the ballot in all states. This is only ploy to take votes from Biden.
Crooked democrats will do anything to get Trump out of office. Too bad it will not work. So you might as well start crying now!
It says everything about President Trump that he struggled to say anything about John Lewis other than that he didn‚Äôt attend the President‚Äôs inauguration.
Awesome like Trump
Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so badly and the left will never get over it. They tried to destroy him with the all costs, it never worked out for them, never will.  And this November he will do the same for Joe Biden...oh boy!
'Daily Show' releases video mocking Trump for stumbling over his words  via   Gee. Isn't that the subject of one of trump's ads against Biden?
The kind of people who follow Trump who believes anyone not sufficiently loyal to him is an enemy of the state (cue authoritarianism). BTW he is the president and is running for reelection.
trump, Barr, what are you doing? Got caught with your pants down.
If we all bout a small book of stamps each month, the US Postal service could meet its payroll and expenditure demands without trump defunding.
Another reason to vote Trump 2020
Tr7mp made no national policy for the Trump Corona Virus so all 50 governors were bidding against each other for PPE and ventilators. This drove up prices many times higher than normal. Thanks Trump for costing us so much extra.
FISA warrants were all proven warranted. No crimes. Just Trump lies.
Yea, sure. I won‚Äôt believe it till I see prices actually come down. It is a proven FACT, TRUMP LIES more than any other POTUS in history.
If everyone could afford to, they could buy stamps via internet which would most likely keep the post office operational. That way the post office will not be underfunded when trump defunds them.
Are you guys capable of making, like, positive Trump ads instead of negative Biden ads? Or are you only able to lean on (manipulated) negativity because you know that Trump has done nothing positive?
As a vet myself these are exactly my feelings. I will NOT be VOTING for TRUMP THE DRAFT DODGING COWARD.
What‚Äôs you PHD in, imagination? There is no deep state. It would be impossible to cover up. Not that many people could keep their mouths shut that long. Quit drinking the Trump kool aid.
This still isn't as bad as Trump many times a day.
In Dec of 2019 Trump was saying he would probably not attend any debates for 2020. Now that he is losing big time he is willing to,take any chance to get an extra vote. I say, Biden should just skip the debate.
Good, but If I were Biden I would demand that Trump reveal his tax returns or NO debates!
Dump Trump !
... maybe trump should just get... IT!
The absolute BEST imitation of Donald Trump...and he did it 11 years ago!  Please pass this along to your contact list and ask that they do the same!
Has another United States elected official (even beyond POTUS) ever directly attacked more of his own citizens on social media than Trump?   Trump won't be happy until someone kills one of his detractors as a show of "loyalty", will he?  #DumpTrump2020 #DictatorTrump
It's fun going back to early COVID pandemic episodes of  to see just how embarrassingly bad Trump was early on in the outbreak and to see how much  dunked on Trump/Pence over how obviously dumb they were.
All of these BS Trump claims have been debunked. Now we have to get Trump tossed out of office and headed to prison. Do your part. Vote against Trump in November.
The ? is when will Laura go out campaigning for Trump?????
This was all set in motion well before Trump/Putin stole the election in 2016.
This says so much about the way President Trump thinks.
Biden will crush trump in a debate.
trump, bleach, vaccine, Jim Jones, Purple Cool aid. No thanks... I‚Äôll listen to Fauci. Can‚Äôt trust trump. Devil himself.
If trump thinks that the virus is a hoax, why doesn‚Äôt he show up in public to give his acceptance speech in an enclosed auditorium?!?!
trump was talking with his genitals not generals. He gets confused sometimes.
Donald Trump is the Dumbest Man in America¬≤  via
Hopefully trump will go away
Obama had to deal with a housing market collapse that devastated the economy right as he showed up in office, so he had to deal with worse than the virus financially. The virus is only as bad as it is in America because Trump doesn‚Äôt know how to lead, so it exploded here.

As the coronavirus death toll reaches 150,000 President Trump says it ‚Äúis what it is.‚Äù
Again, that's the weirdest slogan for an incumbent.  We intend to this November, regardless whatever subterfuge you have strategized.  1,000 deaths every day on trump's hands mismanaging pandemic to steal another election. #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory
The White House seems like a popularity contest for President Trump‚Äôs favor. The public doesn't care whether President Trump likes Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauci but what the public does care about is getting doctors‚Äô opinions on the pandemic.
Ridiculous.  How can you president from prison? 1,000 American deaths every day as trump mismanages pandemic to steal another election. Murderer. #TrumpIsTheBiggestMassMurdererInAmericanHistory  #25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #WeStillShootTraitorsDontWe?

I‚Äôm going to have faith in the voters that they can 1) see through this and 2) know that Kanye is an unstable idiot. But as Trump said in 2016, he loves stupid people, and then they voted for him.

Laying the blame on Trump and his administration for the scourge that Communist China released on the world is fairly typical of the Marxist Democrats who instead of working with the administration, initiated many inane and failed investigations including a sham impeachment.
Yo what has Trump done for this country? Like dead ass I really want to know.
We need President Trump who is not afraid to rock the boat and to deal with these countries who take economic advantage of our nation. His predecessors were just too inept, too complacent and did not have the business acumen nor the balls to stand up and renegotiate trade deals.
Trump doesn't even hide it...  This old Marine is voting in person! F*CK THE VIRUS! F*Ck TRUMP! SEMPER-FI!!!
No, no, no.  The reason we have more cases is because we test more. Testing clearly causes the cases.  Thus sayeth trump.
I don‚Äôt believe those other countries are using HCQ at all.  That‚Äôs being touted only by trump.
Obamacare already does that. And let me head off the next "leadership" tweet: women and people of color already have the right to vote. Don't have Trump promise to soon grant these rights. üôÑ

Trump is an oaf, cheated his way into Wharton, went bankrupt, lies about his ill gotten gains, and traveled in a cloistered circle of syncophants.  And you are a convicted criminal who spent too little time in jail.
Huge news that happened in 2009-10! Huge thing that  already did that your putz of a President wants to repeal. Huge new lie to tell Trump‚Äôs base! Huge act of pathetic political theater!  Huge embarrassment for you, Jason. Where‚Äôs your self-respect? Who owns you? Sad.

One hand washes the other. Today's republicans don't believe in a republic; a gov't of, by, &amp; for the people. Trump believes in a gov't that serves him, and McConnell believes in a gov't that serves his power and donors. They only call themselves republicans.  They are oligarchs.
I wonder how long Trump will start calling him Lying Ted again?
Does Trump even care if there‚Äôs a desl? He‚Äôs (allegedly) the ‚Äúdeal-maker‚Äù - but can‚Äôt seem to be bothered to actually get involved.

What about Kushner‚Äôs ‚ÄùDemocide‚Äù initiative? His team withheld help for Blue States thinking Dems would be killed off. It backfired. Trump's criminality will hurt Republicans, eventually.

We should all be embarrassed that China and Russia see our elections as some kind of proxy war. Any American president other than Donald Trump would be embarrassed, too. On November 3, we need to restore our place in the world.
And how many times did Trump bitch about President Obama signing Executive Orders??
They need jobs clubs are close. Doing it the right way. Trump needs a lesson
That Trump believes that Biden could "hurt God" exposes the shallowness, the superficiality, of Trump's own beliefs. Believers in God know that God is stronger than either Biden or Trump.
This is horrible- especially when Trump pardons real criminals.
No wonder Trump won't stand up to Putin!! (Beside the obvious fact that Trump is weak-willed.)
My dad got a purple heart for his bravery in WW2. He would be disgusted by Trump's politicization of the military. Have you talked to Putin about his bounty on our troops yet?

Is the suggestion that we're not smart enough to understand Trump? That's BS. Anyone in the world can look through his facade of "businessman/dealmaker" and realize he is simply an ignorant, incompetent cruel liar. Oh yeah - he's a fraud also, as proven in court!
None of this immoral, politically-driven conduct is excusable. DeSantis would rather have Trump's approval than to the right thing for his state's residents.   -- &gt; I'm sure glad I don't live in Florida!

I am sure there are others, but every single piece of advice he ever gave Trump has had disastrous consequences.

Trump remembers the full page ad he took out demanding the death penalty for 5 black men that didn't commit the crime they were accused of, right? And refusing to rent to black people for decades? Oh, but Joe said something dumb!
In the end Trump will be greatest thing ever to happen to American socialism as 1) evil gold-loving billionaire right out of central casting puts bad fave on capitalism 2) teaching 10s of millions the role of Prez is to aggressively intervene in free markets.

Honestly, those even considering not voting against Trump don't deserve to be kowtowed to or even considered. It is absolutely irrational under any semblance or shade of conservatism to help Trump. Maybe I'd rethink that position if Warren or Bernie were on the D ticket.

No, not illegal at all. Completely disengenuous. From a racist mind set. And motivated by a desire to pull voters in key states from Biden.  It's gonna fail just like everything else Trump and his people try. But, we gotta fight like they are gonna win to make sure.
Can anyone imagine what America will look like 4 years from now if Trump is re-elected? The Black Plague killed half of Europe in the mid 1300s. Trump is doing nothing to stop deaths. America will resemble the Dark Ages.

Trump could at least reverse the order and put "as you know" at the END of a sentence. For example, Trump could say, "I am a lying, evil idiot -- as you know."

"Donald today is much as he was at three years old: incapable of growing, learning, or evolving, unable to regulate his emotions, moderate his responses, or take in and synthesize information." - Mary L Trump, "Too Much and Never Enough", Page 197
FINALLY, it's starting to get the press it deserves! The sleeper story of the year. The dark horse, suddenly pulling into position to gain the race announcer's excited mention. WHEN Trump is ordered to submit his DNA, this will be on EVERYONE's lips. Let it be soon!
Wait. I thought these tests were ‚Äúbeautiful tests‚Äù supplied by the Trump Admin...
The governor has no right to force us to wear masks, covid-19 is fake its an engineered virus to take down Trump.  Pritker sucks balls
I would like to know how Trump ment he would hurt God?
Taking a page from Trump, Falwell calls the wrong he does "good". This is the current evil play-book. Unless Americans overwhelmingly reject the play, which has worked reliably since 2015 to justify mind-boggling evil, it will continue to be used as "the play that wins the game".
Trump doesn‚Äôt even know the Lords Prayer as witnessed at George Bush Sr. Funeral.
It's funny until you realize Kanye is quite possibly richer than Trump...
If only CNN could be as stern when President Trump‚Äôs Family is routinely attacked by the media.  Sucks when it happens to you, doesn‚Äôt it?
I quote Two Corinthians 14:1: "Yea, verily Donald Trump, also known as the Orange Blob, also known as Don the Con, is a #Biblicalidiot."
92% of African-Americans support Biden over Trump.  89% voted for Hillary in 2016.  Seems like he‚Äôs talking to the majority already...
This comment means you don‚Äôt like Trump‚Äôs vulgarity, but you‚Äôre perfectly fine with his policies. Because the GOP you‚Äôre still defending has spent the past 3-1/2 years enacting his policies and enabling his behavior.  In other words, you‚Äôre full of shit.
Vote for tRump
I‚Äôve been saying this for weeks. It is artificially inflated. After Trump loses and Muchin stops the shenanigans, watch for the crash and The GOP to blame the Democrats.
My guess is Trump has buying controling stocks in one of the social media companies that's looking to buy tiktok. That would be the one social media apps that he can't get banned from and he can rant what ever he wants.
I think it‚Äôs really pathetic when a billionaire wife is chronically depressed because a man she dislikes is president. Can‚Äôt you get a life and channel your energy into something positive instead of agonizing over Trump?
Many feel this way. In 2016 it was different. Hillary was despised as much if not more than Trump.
God has a plan! He picked Trump to be our leader. This nation under God is praying for Trump.
Well, I guess we now see what ‚ÄúNever Trump‚Äù means to some conservatives: Not much.
Trump hasnt said anything racist. Biden is up to 7 now.
For anyone unfamiliar with this legal term: Any such attempt to appeal would likely be denied immediately -- ie, the hearing of an appeal being disallowed. At this point there is legally NO difference between Trump providing a DNA sample and any other defendant doing the same.
A crucial statement in judge's order: "any requested relief not not expressly addressed herein has been considered and is hereby denied." This means Trump's lawyers can't come back with another stalling tactic. They could still attempt an "interlocutory appeal" to stall DNA.
lol, my trump supporting in-laws couldn‚Äôt do it either
Seriously. Trump makes more gaffes in a day than Biden has made in his whole campaign ( Thighland?)
Hahaha, love that idea. I think it will worküëç
Getting it "in the rear" means you can't get tested at all. Or, you have to wait two weeks for the results -- which makes the result worthless, because you're either in the hospital, dead, or no longer contagious. If you don't understand, President Trump explains it all here.
That is awful. Let us blame the Chinese. Move manufacturing back to the US and cut them deeply as punishment. Trump will make them pay for their crimes Biden will give them a party.
9) Equating oneself to "the 2nd Coming of God". 10) Revenge as a way of life (here). 11) Intentionally letting thousands die, while lying to them and directing them to do things that WILL result in them dying by the tens &amp; hundreds of thousands. 12) "Trump being Trump" (catchall)
Best person for the job President Trump, basement dwellers like Biden won‚Äôt do it.
For one thing and one thing only- abortion. Even though there‚Äôs no doubt Trump has paid for a few himself, he claims he is pro-life and that‚Äôs all they need.
Brian....‚ÄùHe makes dog-whistle calls to racists, science deniers, conspiracy theorists, the uninformed and those filled with arrogant hatred so often it is damn near impossible to keep up. Protesters, Trump claims, are the worst.‚Äù  Great paragraph.  Thanks.  Good article to read.
What I expressed is the OPPOSITE of elitism. To say Trump is an ignoramus isn't elitist. Without any basis but his own ego, Trump repeatedly claims to know more than experts: doctors, generals &amp; appeals to people who DISMISS expertise. Even janitors are VALID janitorial experts.
I created &amp; posted the "Weekend at Bernie's" image as a #NeverTrump Republican who first voted for Reagan &amp; for whom  will be first-ever vote for a Democrat. Trump is a traitor &amp;  are collaborators. HERE is what inspires ME!
A census counts its citizens.  Illegal aliens aren‚Äôt citizens.   And it‚Äôs President Trump, ma‚Äôam.
Even though Trump's capacity is diminished, there are a lot of corrupt people who have a vested interest in propping him up, even if it takes a "Weekend at Bernie's" effort. There are people HE corrupted, who got sucked in &amp; are now "all in". There are "initiators", like Putin.
What's your favorite part of the history of the EC? Is it that the founders were lazy and couldn't come up with anything else or the 3/5 compromise?
Great ... time for NFL now. Screw them all. Trump 2020
Since you brought up the Big Lie propaganda technique, here's a *fact* about Trump from 1990, long before politics. Trump is a nonstop stream of lies, so much that it's impossible to focus on one before it gets pushed out of the news by more lies.
Trump is a traitor, the worst in US history -- far worse than Benedict Arnold. He has betrayed America from start to finish, nothing but an evil con man w/ a cult. I've opposed all Democrat presidents since Carter, but could summarize diffs easily. There is no summary for Trump.
"Donald's need for affirmation is so great that he doesn't seem to notice that the largest group of his supporters are people he wouldn't condescend to be seen with outside of a rally." - Mary L Trump, "Too Much and Never Enough", Page 197
Trump has done far, far worse than shoot one person. Repeatedly, to this day &amp; still ongoing, resulting in over 156,000 senseless deaths &amp; growing by over 1000 per day. He values HIS life enough to get tested every day with everyone who comes near him. But, for us?? Listen here.
The how dare Trump make his acceptance speech from the WH!He has always been an interloper I
1 want Trump to go away‚Äô
Trump, nothing but an ignoramus! The only thing we can abt to hear from you is you‚Äôre RESIGN!!!!üêõü¶ñ
All who blindly follow Trump are responsible, for whom he "can shoot someone on fifth avenue &amp; not lose a single vote" as he bragged. All who follow the man who proposed injecting bleach to cure COVID-19 &amp; other evil lies daily. A cult leader is powerless without his cult -- YOU.
Facebook removes a coronavirus misinformation post from President Trump for the first time ever - The Washington Post
1. Go fuck yourself. 2. Too many, in part because selfish people don‚Äôt get vaccinated. 3. Too many, because Trump refused to deal with it early. 4. That smell is coming from the shit you‚Äôre talking. 5. Working for Salon would be better than trolling on twitter.
Cut out the pork for the rich and business associates of tRump and difference will be covered.
Some Generals said they knew nothing about this and never had a conversation with trump....

"Sociopath" is a word used by Trump's own niece, Mary Trump, clinical psychologist and the daughter of Trump's older brother, Fred Trump, Jr., to describe her uncle, Donald Trump, in her recently published best-selling book, "Too Much, and Never Enough".
Strictly 20th century? Gerald Ford.  Since 1900? Donald Trump
If you want to buy a diploma from the fraudulent, court-closed Trump University -- your idiocy is your business. But, when you spread lies &amp; help this evil sociopath murder fellow Americans  --  you are complicit in those deaths. Lashing out at me  with lies doesn't change that.
Trump isn't to blame for the deaths because he is incompetent -- although he is completely incompetent -- but because he is *deliberately* doing and saying what he KNOWS is perpetuating deaths at this high level -- intentionally lying, STILL claiming success during utter failure.
So? Since when has that stopped Trump? And who exactly is going to stop him?  ü¶óü¶óü¶ó
Yeah and watch as soon as Trump says that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening you won‚Äôt hear a peep from any Republican. Problematic! Ha! ü¶óü¶óü¶ó
Many in "the broader public" are also "isolated" from facts, what is going on in Washington DC &amp; even basic unchanging facts from history &amp; eighth-grade civics class. Elitism can be reverse: "ordinary" people dismissing "experts". THIS elitism is how Ignoramus Trump is empowered.
This is a catch-catch scenario to play to the base by Cruz.  Shameless. Showmanship bullshit.  I hope Texas sees this as a entertainer.  Trump was not watched by the FBI.  The FBI was going after RUSSIA..

They obviously know they will lose, right?  They've added almost $7 trillion since Trump took office, and now they're worried?  Spare us.  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
What did you expect.....This is the way TRUMP operates.  Mafia style..
Trump surely feels strong schadenfreude when he hears of death threats to Fauci. It should be obvious, even to his cult, that's the kind of man Trump is.
Imagine the mess left after one of Trump's angry morning Twitter rants...
Oh, Kathy. Trump is incapable of loving anyone but himself. Just ask his children...
1/2 ‚ÄúThe only possible conclusion is that the objective in Trump‚Äôs relations with other countries is not national security but Trump‚Äôs security.‚Äù So well said.........
Unfortunately, this is the case. Trump‚Äôs policy to support Russia and their influence in the Middle East is done.  Trump as colluded with Putin to make this happen, and now is wreaking our NATO relationships which allows Putin to gain ground.
Thank you.  Vets that work at the USPS will be hurt by TRUMP.
President Trump is a man who leads by example. He took the drug the he recommended for COVID. Where else do you see that. Rare in our days. Surely Fauci, Gates and friends won‚Äôt take the vaccine first
This guy is spot on!!!!
You‚Äôre right, especially living in the most liberal state of all. It‚Äôs coming at her from every direction. I can‚Äôt win. I‚Äôd love to hear what has changed other liberals minds to flip and vote for Trump. Was it one specific reason? If so, what was that?
She knows all this stuff about Obama, that‚Äôs why she was Republican. Her preference is the Republican Party just not Trump. I think we can all agree he has said some dumb stuff but his accomplishments and get it done mentality outweigh his past comments.
As parents I think we need to just let go and let them make their own decisions. Easier said than done. My daughter likes things about both parties, she just hates Trump so much as a person... she‚Äôll choose no one instead of him. She needs to learn more but won‚Äôt. üò¢
It‚Äôs not hard to predict what #NostraDumbAss will do - whatever a warm, caring human being would do, Trump will most certainly do the opposite.
From cutting water protections to weakening emissions restrictions, the environmental policy of this administration is clear:
Words cannot describe HOW FED UP I AM with these people in the area treating the pandemic like it's nothing. Thanks to these people, MY DISTRICT HAS TO START SCHOOL REMOTELY FROM AUGUST 17TH TO OCTOBER 13TH!!! I AM VERY PISSED THEY DECIDED TO GO THIS WAY. THANKS A LOT, TRUMP!
Yup. Only Trump could manage to allow more than 150K Americans die and do essentially nothing about it AND whine forever about how HE is the victim in all of this. Perfect.

My daughter 26 moved from Illinois to Seattle WA and hates Trump. It kills me, she was raised Republican and now feels Trump hates women and minorities... what can I say to wake her up?

The top 5 companies in the NASDAQ account for 40% of the market cap. Appl, msft, amzn, fb, googl/goog  Trump touting 'his economy' is utter nonsense.
That's the closest to telling the truth Trump has ever come. "It is what it is, because of me", would truthfully complete the sentence.
Also, don't forget, Florida is where Trump himself will be mailing HIS ballot -- so, in his mind &amp; his cult's -- this dispenses with criticism of why it's okay for HIM to vote by mail. According to Trump, mail-in-voting is either perfect or IRREPARABLY fraudulent, per each state.
Perhaps this is part of a Trump attempt to "normalize" what is abnormal AND illegal in regard to elections, so that when he actually takes abnormal &amp; illegal actions (as late as 01/20/21!) it won't be "about Trump", but ostensibly about "protecting elections" &amp; stopping a "coup".
It‚Äôs August 4th, your miserable shot show failed and Donald Trump is still your President
Trump's propaganda tactic: It can't be wrong if I brag about it openly. A form of #gaslighting.

I'm pretty sure that the Trump legacy will be a scourge in American history and known throughout the world. Anyone that connects themselves with the name and business involved with the Trump name will be like snake venom and poison everyone &amp; everything involved.
This is just one example of Trump's reckless audacity, rooted in a belief he can indeed do &amp; say anything and get away with it by simply inventing his own reality with lie after lie after lie. Indeed, this has been pragmatically confirmed by  &amp;  complicity.
Some of them. The majority of my friends, even if they dislike Trump are not vocal about it. Only one family friend is hardcore anti trump. I stay off of her Facebook page and she stays off of my twitter feed.

Trump's Outrageous and Unconstitutional Demands On TikTok and Microsoft  Telling business owners they have to pay the government a slice of any deal or the government will not allow it is blatantly unconstitutional.
If Trump speaks at Gettysburg, the next day he will claim, "A lot of people are calling my speech the greatest speech ever given at Gettysburg!"
Maybe Trump will order all ballots to be rerouted to the White House, "to make sure their isn't any fraud".
Trump has systematically damaged the USPS by appointing his own man to screw up the system just so he can claim that mail in ballots don't work. This way he can stay in office by hook or by crook.
He wanted to shut down the postal service some time ago, so he put his own man in charge to do it for him.. Pretty simple. Trump makes up his own rules to do what ever he wants.

We are living in the new age of Trump Royalty. As Lui said let them eat cake.
Nothing new yet time to get this in the light.  The Trump family needs to account for the mess they have created before and now.
1/5 our previous containment model was working.  Trump has sucked up to the Dictators and we are not in a good place.  America will suffer greatly in the coming years.  Another 4 years of Trump and America will no longer be able to influence or challenge acts against 1/6
1/4 The thought you posed on China is diametrically opposed to where Trump was headed.  Trump was and is in bed with China. This spat is nothing more than a tantrum by Trump.  Granted the Chinese are Communists and are definetly attempting to gain world power; 1/5
1/3 free to take over the Middle East and create great havoc on Israel and other countries friendly to Europe.  NATO the lynch pin since the 1950s is now in danger of falling apart thanks to Trump which will have an economy impact to the United States. 1/4
1/2 Yet, you fail to attribute the truth to what has been done by Trump. The tax cut imploded the middle class and poor. The deregulations will cost the country dearly in the coming years with pollution and bad water and our foreign policy is in a trash burner.  Russia is now 1/3
Breaking: New Poll Shows Trump Ahead of Biden Nationally and in Key Battleground States /
In Trump's mind, he rode on a donkey across the entire states of Texas and Florida, cheering crowds waving palm branches on both sides of the road the entire length. In reality, he is crazy Herod, with the head of every John-the-Baptist on a platter, if he can make it so.
It's "1984": Accusing #NeverTrump Republicans of a "burn-it-all-down" mentality because we ("I") want everyone but  to LOSE because of their collaboration with Trump's treason, while they ignore Trump's "burn-it-all-down" LIE the election is "fraudulent" &amp; a "coup".
There is night-and-day difference between  criticism of Dr. Birx &amp; Trump's. Pelosi's is rational &amp; sincere. Trump's is his usual hit job: revenge on Birx for the unforgivable "disloyalty" of someone diverging from him in the slightest to do her job &amp; speak truth.
Stalin set out to have specific people killed. Trump just lets a virus run rampant without any care who dies. The end result is the same - hundreds of thousands dead for no good reason.
A Republican tactic of late has been to provide substandard polling places in communities they know will vote against them. That tactic won't work against mail-in ballots, so Trump has his crony Postmaster General slowing down mail service.
It's more of Trump's #gaslighting and falsely accusing others of what he is doing even worse.  is complicit, here pushing a false narrative that  wants to cancel the debates while the valid news is that Trump has called for canceling "fraudulent" election day.
You are living in a cave if you haven‚Äôt whittnessed what the Dems are doing ! Trump ‚Äò20 / Senate / House / Clean Sweep November 3

It's not a coincidence that members of Trump's cult ignore all the times Trump berated Obama for golfing, and his insistence that as president he would be too busy to golf. Pro tip: Deals don't have to happen over a round of golf - it's an excuse used to expense leisure activity.
NO Covid (and other causes) have killed these people. Thanks to Biden, Gates &amp; Obama funding the lab that created the virus! Trump is stopping it all... not to mention saving thousands of kids! Get you‚Äôre head straight and do your homework! Voting Dem is electing Killary Clinton!

I‚Äôve found myself relieved with the rift in #YangGang Twitter this week. I was overjoyed to be on the same page, at least about a candidate, with Trump-to-Yang folks. But I never came close to feeling true solidarity with them. It all struck me as bizarre. nice...but bizarre.

We got to hear a real intelligent president speak in Obama, something Trump will never be.
Yep that is what Trump said.  Did all African Americans know that since Trump they've never had it better?  More money, housing, prison reform, and so much more that Trump did and only he did.  More than Lyndon Johnson &amp; John Lewis &amp; Obama of course! He's so mentally ill!

The national debt increased by 74% during Obama‚Äôs presidency, but Bush43 increased it by 101% and Reagan increased it by 186%.  And Obama did shrink the deficit every year in office, unlike Bush43 and Trump, so it‚Äôs not bs.
One of the reasons we have a Federal Gov is to plan and coordinate a NATIONAL response in times of national crisis. trump did none of it. He in inept. He is NO leader.
Biden has done this governing work all his adult life. He knows how to do the job nationally and internationally that trump STILL does not. He also has the ability to lead and bind the nation trump only divides.
Trump who supports Nazis and the Klan is going to criticize others‚Äô comments about race/ethnic groups . His followers and propaganda papers ignore that.
You are far smarter, more rational, more psychologically centered than trump. Only his ego made him want to be president, nothing else.
Trump could not run any real, large corporation. I worked for on global corp that has a real estate SUBSIDIARY. trump's tiny business would be a tiny department in that subsidiary, if they bought it. Then they would fire him as unfit for the organization, real business.
His skills are in real estate, salesmanship, PR, especially personal PR, trump mythology, and reading the room for the easily exploited for his own personal purposes. NYC has always considered him a joke, a circus barker. None of that makes you president and it shows daily.
So as usual, Trump is right.

You don't know enough to even say that.  I've reviewed them. They are in line with a proper response. Leadership is not making them up as you go along, without any knowledge or expertise and won't listen to any. trump can't do this and is still failing.
I have worked for two Fortune 5 (five) corps, the US Air Force and have my own consulting business. I know what good management is, what bad management is. trump has NONE of it.
Never ever will listen to a sentence you speak. Not surprised you represent Trump. Evil is as Evil is. You got your ass wiped.
Mr. Trump is not an honorable person.  He is immune from prosecution while he is in office.  This is not a drill, God will judge America.  I am a Patriot, we must force this country to live up to the true meaning of our creed that all persons are created equal.

Clearly you still want a reason to still vote for Trump. If you are going to let one decision be the basis compared to what has happened over the last four years (or even the last five months) just admit you are only debating to get attention by writing this column.
Wrong. Go read my recent TL Tweets on this subject. trump wants you to believe the response is a Governor role. The national response is an Executive Branch responsibility, lead by POTUS.
So this whole Pandemic response is trump's fault. He has blood on his hands.

trump had 3+yrs to prepare &amp;did nothing. In fact, he made it worse by cutting budgets, diminished the Pandemic Intelligence Office, letting real experienced talent go. He helped make the government unready for the possibility. He doesn't know what management of a large org is abt
trump rejected the Pandemic Playbook and the Pandemic War Games offered by the prior admin in 2016. Then he did not test it with the NATION'S stakeholders* in 2017, 2018, 2019 and was caught ignorant and unready in 2020. Then he denied, deflected, delayed until the virus exploded
You are fully exploited. viruses like this and the "Spanish" Flu can spring up anywhere there is human/animal interaction. In fact, the "Spanish" Flu sprang up in rural Kansas. So, it isn't where it sprang up; it is how it is handled. trump did nothing until it was too late.
No. Never has been. But that is what trump wants you to believe because he can't admit how derelict in HIS duties he has been since 2016. You have some studying to do.

You certainly are new to this. Politics, elections are NEVER binary. This is going to be a razor thin election. America has only one Job One - to remove trump. Any vote or no vote that does not directly do that is pro-trump.

trump began to fail the Pandemic response in 2016 by rejecting the Pandemic Playbook and Pandemic War Games, then did not test the Playbook with the NATION'S stakeholders in 2017, 2018, 2019 and was caught ignorant and flatfooted in 2020, then denied, delayed, lied and blew it
Wrong!! It merely started in China. It just as easily could have sprung it up in the US. trump would have botched it the same if it had started here. He started failing in 2016. Any corporate CEO as derelict of duty as trump would have been walked out late 2017, early 2018.
It needs to be said daily. trump has blood on his hands and he's not done.

The fed gov was not ready to perform its responsibilities, which would have ensured the states were ready to act, only after botching the bans on foreign travel. trump is responsible for all of the unnecessary deaths. He didn't do his job and then backed out of it.
The executive branch has the responsibility to manage and coordinate the national effort from ongoing preparation to implementation. This gets all stakeholders on board, knows status of all resources and prepares budgets and organization necessary to act. trump did none of this
trump actually began to fail in 2016 when he rejected the Pandemic Playbook and Pandemic War Games offered by the prior admin. Then he continued to fail by not testing the Playbook with the NATION'S stakeholders in 2017, 2018, 2019. Any CEO would have been walked out by 2018.
Yes. And I consult corporate disaster planning. I know how it should work. I know what trump was given by the last admin. I know the role of management and leadership. trump blew this.

Yes, trump has you right where he wants you.
It was a slow recovery, but trump did not improve on it.
Even before trump tanked the economy, manufacturing jobs were on the way down, contrary to his lies.
Those tax cuts were not trump's tax cuts. He promised tax cuts only for the Middle Class. The cuts passed were Paul Ryan's tax cuts giving too much money away to the wealthy and not enough to the Middle Class, The bump lasted just a few months and raised the debt dangerously.
trump's economy was nothing but a simple linear progression of Obama's economy. Why are you so ignorant?

Hope you are watching Joe Biden on TV right now! THIS is what a REAL President looks like!! Have a nice day!  Nearly 170,000 dead because of you!! #WearAMask #FAKEPresident

Milwaukee loses to Wilmington
I can hear her say that the deal began with the Obama-Biden administration
Jumping ahead, let's assume Biden wins.  Will Nancy Pelosi be Speaker again?
Have Biden and Harris issued a position on "Merry Christmas" yet?  I'm not getting in line at Walmart until I know what I can and can't say.
I don't think Mike Pence is as addle-brained as Biden.
I'm pretty sure that's the plan... Biden is the one they believe has the best chance of winning. The more interesting bet is the reason they give for him stepping down....
That‚Äôs part of why I love that she‚Äôs Joe Biden‚Äôs pick.
Hopefully he gets fired during Biden‚Äôs inaug speech. :)  If Barr‚Äôs smart, (he pretends not to be in Congressional hearings) he‚Äôll empty his personal belongings beforehand.   We should be worried about willful destruction of DOJ documents before his last day, Jan 20, 2021.

Not investigating and prosecuting the actions of the Bush Administration over things like firing of US Attorneys or the torture program is Obama‚Äôs biggest mistakes. Biden should not replicate it.
‚ÄúBut well short of a constitutional crisis, the Trump administration can nevertheless hobble the incoming Biden team and endanger the nation with a scuttled transition process.‚Äù
Herman Cain is no more sending tweets than Joe Biden.
I've made a ton of jokes, but - on the "real talk" front - a Biden/Harris ticket is clearly not wildly radical. Aren't they BOTH former prosecutors? The whole point of this team, plus Kasich/the Never Trumpers at the convention, is pulling in moderates. Does it work for you guys?
Why not, Biden tweets all the time and here brain dead.
I‚Äôm guessing Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt care enough....
Donald isn't excellent at anything except spouting whatever he thinks of on the spot. I'm pretty sure Biden goes to church way more than even Donald.  and No. Biden's remark as such is simply his inner racism coming out.
I believe that Biden touches people in an inappropriate manner and I also believe he‚Äôs FAR less creepy than Trump and Pence.
What‚Äôs he so afraid of???                Biden/Harris 2020üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Trump supports climate-destroying fossil fuels while Biden promotes renewable energy. Good message.
But now that we have CNN as an unofficial campaign channel of the Biden-Harris ticket, we can be rest assured that we can get 24/7 coverage of nothing but free Biden-Harris campaign ads
I‚Äôm telling you, I can‚Äôt believe  hasn‚Äôt made an ad blaming the sports chaos on trump. Imagine cfb fans voting for Biden just for no cfb season
If Kamala Harris is strong... she would have turned down the Vice Presidency based on what she accused Biden of being. She‚Äôs nothing but a weak opportunist
Kamala Harris came out saying she believes and supports Joe Biden‚Äôs alleged rape victims...now she‚Äôs his running mate. This is American politics.
There‚Äôs plenty of other angles to go at Biden with and be successful. No need to even touch the racist or sexual abuse allegations.
I‚Äòm not ‚Äúthe 1%‚Äù  and I got a tax cut.  ANYONE making UNDER $100K yr rec‚Äôd a tax cut.  Now, all taxpayers making $104K yr or less qualify for a payroll tax hold. Use your $ at home during the crisis. Trump pledges to waive the taxes, but Biden wants repayment w/ a 3-6% tax inc

She doesn‚Äôt even like Biden... this is hilarious. What a train-wreck the dems are lol
Scrolling through my feed I keeps seeing quotes from Biden and Harris and they are uplifting...then I keep seeing a Trump quote from tonight and it's just garbage lying word salad and rude. I cant wait for him to be gone.
Trump hasn't mention Biden or Harris. You guys haven't mentioned Cannon Hinnant.
Biden‚Äôs an ally. I like that. The opposite of being a racist.
Biden and Harris will fight for ALL Americans.  Not just those that vote for them. #BidenHarris2020
vote for Biden
Commie la Harris is Biden's new "handler" now?
The madness stops with a Biden/Harris ticket? I‚Äôm equally scared for a Biden presidency, the same policies will be passed and the same bills will be signed. Only difference is the country will fall back asleep believing that we‚Äôre back to some sense of normalcy.
If Trump doesn‚Äôt attend the inauguration of Joe Biden, should he win, what happens to the football?  The guy quietly moves from one president to the next at 12pm on January 20th.

You are done! Biden/Harris are going to bury you and Pence! Thank God!
Right-Wing Bishop Dismisses Joe Biden‚Äôs Catholic Faith in Pathetic Attack

‚ÄúIn some of the conversations, Biden left open an opportunity. Please consider joining me in another role in the administration‚Äù
None of these political gotchas matter. Do you think Harris calling Biden a racist and a rapist will matter? Not in the slightest.
Can only hope. But name recognition will siphon off some votes at the ballot. In 2016, there were 3 states that had only a 80k(?) Margin of winning in total. Thays a very small percentage. And west said he was doing this to hurt biden and help trump. Very unethical.
Is the shaking of your glass the DTs or your fear of the Biden/Harris ticket?
That is so sick!   I believe the black/Asian/white communities will vote for Biden/Harris before Trump!!  We need a REAL President!!!
Can we reclaim "suburban soccermom" from Trump, please! #BidenHarris2020
Something Biden should definitely think about!  I do think that Biden is much tougher than Trump and his team think and definitely more cognitively fit.  Trump is the one who needs to beware! Remember ‚Äúcovfefe‚Äù?

Same here. I‚Äôm mad, I‚Äôm disappointed, I‚Äôm hurt. I feel that we were stuck with Biden, but had a chance for real progressive change with Warren as VP. Kamala feels like tokenism to me. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs going to fight hard for the things I care about. #WarrenDemocratforlifeüóΩüóΩ

My daughter supported Bernie, and now she's voting for Biden/Harris. A lot of Bernie's supporters know there is too much at stake to sit this one out.
How everyone I trust seems to feel about the #news these days #cat #cats #politics  but glad  #Biden picked a scrappy VP
Morning everyone. I wanted to say something about reactions from last night. So, I know most of y'all are upset with Biden/Harris, I'm not happy either but let's really sit and think for a moment. Do we honestly really want another 4 years of Trump?
Joe Biden didn‚Äôt choose anyone. The Democratic Party chose her.
A vote for Biden in the primaries was a vote for Trump. It is getting harder for the Biden camp to hide his dementia, and trying to get Kamala Harris, the HRC camp's choice as the inter-regnum candidate is gross and won't work.
Many us feel free to vote for someone other than Trump or Biden.
Joe Biden decides Kamala Harris smells the most qualified. Then there is the fact that she likes to spend time on her knees to get what she wants from men. So overall, GOOD CHOICE FOR A TOKEN.
In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
Just ordered a Biden/Harris campaign sign and made a donation to the campaign.
Joe Biden's dementia isn't the path any country should take, his mental capacity, short-term memory issue and his global cognitive awareness is-rapidly deteriorating, it's sad yet clear
In case you need more atheists to be disappointed by, here's Ayaan Hirsi Ali insanely claiming Biden wants Sharia Law.
Lol. Should we pull up Trump‚Äôs exaggeration or lies. üòÇ. The problem is that whatever you accuse Biden of, he looks like a choir boy compared to Trump. That‚Äôs what you call an awful canidate. He has no record to run on. The one thing he had, the rising inherited economy is gone!
I really wanted her as VP, so she could run for President in 2024. I feel she did all the work and is ready to get to work and got screwed over because the media was obsessed with Biden choosing a WOC. I don‚Äôt think Kamala will push Biden left for the change we need right now

I think that a Biden Harris ticket will appeal to cross over voters. The least ‚Äòscary‚Äô ticket the Dems could have put up. RVAT will be on board. Just need the left of the Left to vote too.

Come on, gang. We all know  REALLY won that Biden VP race!!!
Biden is Catholic. Harris is Baptist.   Republicans will still pretend they're godless.
No surprise here for anyone who's watched his shift to the right. Biden chose Harris, so the former president of American Atheists says he'll consider four more years of Christian Right rule.
joe biden shutting down  stream caught LIVE with keyword recognition
I guess I'm more concerned about what does she bring to the table. She doesn't court progressives. She doesn't court black people. She doesn't bring in purple states. Unknown what she actually brings that can make biden a stronger candidate other than optics
Biden goes to the same Catholic Church as my grandma in Delaware.
You and Joe Biden are cut from the same corrupt fabric. Frankly, it's insulting to me why any sane black person would vote for either of you.
I wanted Warren. The media was so focused on saying it had to be a black woman. Kamala is great, but our country is in the toilet and we need someone with plans for big, structural change. Biden has my vote, but I‚Äôm not enthusiastic.
just said he‚Äôs surprised Biden picked  as his V.P. That  was so nasty to Joe Biden and more disrespectful than how Pocahontas was toward Sleepy Joe Biden.let that sentence sink in.
I am sooo EXCITED and looking forward to a landslide WIN in November as future VP Kamala described as ‚Äúa fearless fighter for the little guy and one of the country‚Äôs finest servants,‚Äù joins future President Biden in the November race. Every vote counts!!!

Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate #SmartNews.It is most welcome and appropriate decision
Institutional racism is a thing that has to be addressed not laid at the feet of Biden/Harris.
Congratulations  ! Now we need all DuPage Dems to unite behind the Biden/Harris ticket and get intelligence, integrity, and a taste for justice back into the White House!
It's Biden/Harris. Thoughts?
I think if they want to win the Presidency they‚Äôll support the ticket. They have two choices, Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris. What‚Äôs your guess
It isn't, but it's also not a new problem.  Putting in all on the shoulders of Biden and Harris is emotionally appealing I guess but it lets far too many people off of the hook.  How many politicians have you voted for that have actually made a real impact on this?
Wait... #Biden just named Kamala his #VP running mate. Didn‚Äôt he just die?  James Kamala Harris should be a before and after puzzle on #WheelOfFortune. #RIPKamala
How annoying. I‚Äôm not turning on my tv. It should have been Warren..and if she just found out today that she wasn‚Äôt the pick, she deserved way better. Biden should stop using Warren for fundraising now. I will get over this, but I‚Äôm pissed rn.
I raised my hand. I‚Äôm voting for Biden
Biden/Harris 2020.   OK. Let's get to work.
Guess what Pence in many ways Biden is correct.
Let‚Äôs put it this way, if the ticket had been Biden/Klobuchar or Biden/Whitmer (or gasp, Biden/Buttigieg) I would have recognized the justification in being upset. Harris is a safe pick who has the potential to be a good VP and maybe helps set the stage for the next phase
biden is a throw away candidate like  romney was in 2012..... the DNC is setting up  for 2024.. 2028...... # totalcontrol
I don‚Äôt mind Harris, and I understand why the campaign thinks it‚Äôs the right choice. Harris is youngish, she has a resume and she‚Äôs not dumb. It‚Äôs not a horrible ticket. It‚Äôs not the choice I would of made, but then again Biden was not my initial choice for top of ticket either
i thoroughly enjoyed biden's trouncing of paul ryan in the vp debate, fwiw
Not young but she just locked in my vote for Biden. Great pick Joe.
In April she said she ‚Äòbelieved Biden‚Äôs sexual assault accusers‚Äô but now it‚Äôs time to team up, got it üòÇ

I am just so excited at the news!! Congratulations to Kamala Harris!! She will be great with Joe Biden!! There truly is a light at the end of the tunnel!!  My only disappointment: was looking forward to her being AG and going after Trump and family!!!
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist?
Growing is learning that‚Äôs what Biden has done    What have you done Katie, have you changed since 15-20 yrs ago. I hope so for your growth.
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate
Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate -  News
This is the worst possible choice Biden could have made for VP (right next to Stacy Abrams).Bad criminal justice record and bad policy positions.Can‚Äôt wait to see Harris acknowledge that she‚Äôs half- Indian for once in her political career at the DNC so she can score some points.
Way to go Joe! Biden/ Harris.
YES!!!! Biden/Harris 2020 #2020Election #BidenHarris2020
I would have preferred Warren. Strategically, Harris was the safest choice. The only people this will upset are on the left and they‚Äôve already decided whether they are voting for Biden or staying home.
As I said, I'll vote for Biden &amp; whoever. No need to snipe free thinkers or falsely elevate would be heroes. We're rooting for the same team, that shouldn't mean giving up individual opinions. My opinion wasn't veiled - Harris is ok (to me) &amp; still is.
Joe Biden could pick the superfecta at Churchill Downs, unless he says, "Rioting and looting are never acceptable and in a free society must be felt with swiftly and harshly.", he will lose, probably in spectacular fashion.
Pete Buttigieg. While I think he would be a fantastic choice, it is pretty clear, the DNC wants Biden to pick a women as his VP.
Perfect!  Cut away from trump and go to Biden!
Biden has selected his running mate!  Can be announced as early as today
I figure get rid of Trump and the moment that is accomplished push hard against Biden, Democrats and every policy they put forth. As it should be
Trump pivots to the Asian scare
Biden could probably get away with not picking a woman.  The backlash might last 48 to 72 hours.

Trump is giving a political speech and denigrating Joe Biden...from the WH Press Briefing Room. Again.
The fact we have to chose between Biden and Trump tells me how poor of a job these politicians have done. They‚Äôre supposed to be public servants but is not, we work to serve them.
Obama started prison reform. It was a bill ready to go. Trump as usual riding on Obama‚Äôs coat tail.   Joe Biden championed a bill that ALMOST EVERY black leader was begging for.
Yeah. Biden was all about intergration through the federal government and state and economics with housing.   But not through busing.   Stop getting your news from memes! They don‚Äôt tell a true story. Spread misinformation. You deserve better!
My landlord thinks if Biden wins, the Covid thing will just disappear.
Nope!! Context matters.   John Lewis, Barack, and Michelle has our trust. They say Biden is no racist. They know him personally. We trust them. Especially Michelle. üòâ
Let's get Biden‚Äôs words out there‚Ä¶
Out of sheer curiosity, I looked up the cognitive test both Trump and Biden boasted about "passing." If it's a standard 'MCA' board measuring just cognitive FUNCTION, an actual question on the thing is: "What is THIS animal?"   Feel free to answer, btw.
Not sure how.  I'm sure this will kill my chances of becoming president, but Biden will be ok.
I think Biden should give his acceptance speech either at the Lincoln Memorial or either the WWII or Viet Nam memorials.
I follow politics pretty closely and don‚Äôt believe I have read or seen Biden people ‚Äúcrowing.‚Äù This is the second time today I have wondered about your comments.
Mr Biden, my son &amp; daughter-in-law are working for minimal hours- less than pre- Covid, but had to go back &amp; have no assistance making up lost income! Unemployment supplement does not help them - so please remember this group as well !
I hope they don't change the LTCG tax rate but do you think there will be a dip in the market if Biden wins the election?
Joe Biden is cheering against the American people.
is Joe Biden hiding in his basement or did the DNC just put him on a "time-out" for continually screwing up their quest for unlimited power?

Isn't that litterly the same thing that Trump fanatics do whenever Biden talks? lol
Stop calling each other names and blocking those you disagree with.  I was blocked because I had said Biden could not tell his sister and wife apart. I am not saying that because I am making fun of Biden. I said it because I think he has dementia.

At this rate if Joe Biden should win, he‚Äôd spend the major part of his first term just backrolling all of Trumps harmful policies and won‚Äôt even have the time to implement his own agenda.
Biden argued for intergration through federal and state action and was against integration through busing.   Byrd WAS kkk and denounce to become a strong advocate for civil rights.   We trust John, Barry, and Michelle to tell us about Biden. Not Trumpers
Let me give you a FACT. Bernie is far far left. A socialist.   Democrats are democrats.   Biden overwhelmingly got the MOST votes. Democrats picked  a centralist by A LOT!!!   Just numbers. Just fact. üíØ
Lol. Look at the mission of almost all far right groups.   A race war.   And it‚Äôs a narrative for folks who get their info from memes to use to gen up support for Trump. The narrative of ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù. ‚ÄúI can fix it‚Äù ‚Äúblacks are coming for you‚Äù ‚ÄúBiden is hurting the suburbs‚Äù.

Oh guaranteed, not to mention he‚Äôs inheriting the worst clusterf**k ever. It‚Äôs going to be a huge undertaking. I know Biden is capable and up to the job, but he will be blamed for the morons inaction.

AG James of NY, going after the NRA, is probably not great for Biden.
Imagine Biden being the one who let one of his families handle the pandemic plan and they both just let the virus spread, thinking that only red states would be the ones that get infected the most.   Now that sounds likes like a nazi to me.
Fundamentally it comes down to whether people think Trump (and his Supreme Court picks) is worse than Biden (and his picks).  Clearly some people think they're equally bad.  It's fine, we disagree, and I don't think our minds are going to be changed on that.
A lot of People know what Joe Biden means  but they purposely skew his comment to make it look monolithic or of malicious intent. I knew exactly what he meant when I watched the video and I think a lot of people do but we need to keep pushing the rhetoric that Joe is outta touch
Trump aides frustrated by his ‚Äònonsensical‚Äô Biden attacks in Ohio: AP reporter #SmartNews
I don't know, man.  I look at Biden as the GWB of the Dem Party.  Unexciting and gaffe-prone, but not sinister.  Not to mention, you kind of have to pick a lane between "look at all the bad things he says and means" vs. "he's senile and can't think straight".
I think Biden is actually more racist than Trump. Trump just says somewhat racist things because he thinks that‚Äôs what his base wants to hear.
It‚Äôs a gaffe because in the very statement he disses Biden, he uses the phrase ‚Äúthe black vote.‚Äù Which is doing  the very thing he is accusing Biden of.
A man that for decades refused to rent to Blacks &amp; created a corporate culture that made sure no one working for him would rent a Trump property to a Black person is? How are you, a person that had to be forced by the federal government to stop this practice, better then Biden?
Only Joe Biden has that power

Changing the way the system operates. Yes, that's systemic. As opposed to the Biden plan, which is "insert dollar amount here" to give corporations money to "do the right thing". If zero carbon credits are introduced to the market, the only offset is carbon capture.

It's incomparable, dude. There's a tangible difference between anti-slavery without promising 100% abolition tomorrow, and pro-slavery. Joe Biden *literally* told us there isn't a tangible difference.
But he was an abolitionist. The platform was full of anti-slavery. It's not comparable to today because those were tangible improvements to the situation, without going all the way. "Nothing will fundamentally change" - Joe Biden

I call bullshit on Biden. I've searched for people that chose him over the other candidates. I've come up empty.
I'm talking about the DNC nomination. It was stolen from Bernie in 16. This election it was obvious that the chosen one was handed the nomination.  Seriously,  Biden? How the fuck did this happen? Yang or Gabbard were the top quality players. I would have taken them seriously.
Maybe the strategy is to make Trump look like a good leader, with that $400..?  But it seems crazy to me that Mitch wants to make that gamble, when Biden is so likely to be the benefactor of this new precedent. It's just... Dumb.
2/12 Birtherism 2.0 apparently began as an insidious suggestion circulating in the cesspool that is Facebook.   These were making the rounds before Biden's announcement, but moved from a dull roar to an angry rumble to a Trump train whistle afterwards.

Kamala Harris Is the Future, So Mike Pence May Well Be History
Warren is Native American and Harris is African American. Joe Biden is a sexy woman. Donald Trump is my president.
Exactly; doing that shows both that Biden can work with those who have opposed him AND that he recognizes and values her strength, two things Trump cannot begin to comprehend.
I hope you find yourself in the Biden Cabinet.
Remember they project constantly.  Trump didn't pick Pence, Manafort did so of course they're going to say Biden didn't pick his own running mate. They'll try to turn it into he wasn't mentally capable of picking I bet.

The madness stops with a Biden/Harris ticket? I‚Äôm equally scared for a Biden presidency, the same policies will be passed and the same bills will be signed. Only difference is the country will fall back asleep believing that we‚Äôre back to some sense of normalcy.
Remember when Kamala Harris said about Biden's sexual harassment victims  "I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it," lol what a slap in the face to them
If Trump doesn‚Äôt attend the inauguration of Joe Biden, should he win, what happens to the football?  The guy quietly moves from one president to the next at 12pm on January 20th.

I'm not saying you shouldn't vote for Biden/Harris. I am saying this "you HAVE to vote for the *lesser evil*!" shit has to stop. The lesser evil bit has to stop in general. It's fucking awful. We need legitimately good choices, not scraps of "who is slightly less terrible"
A good sign:  "DuPage Dems - Biden 2020 ***We are sold out, new signs are being printed. We will deliver signs for new orders as soon as they are in.***"

‚ÄúUltimately 11 women made it to the final phase of the process, far more than publicly reported, with Biden conducting one-on-one interviews with each over the last nine days, sometimes in person and some virtually.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn some of the conversations, Biden left open an opportunity. Please consider joining me in another role in the administration‚Äù
She‚Äôs ranked as the most liberal politician in DC, she ranked even higher than commie Bernie! Stop lying, she is not a centrist and either is Biden!
Biden is trying to give Harris the phone because he doesn‚Äôt understand she‚Äôs not in the room.
Your "logic" is absurd, since no one but the winner qualifies in your mind and Biden can't nominate himself. It's the case of your comment being ridiculous. Bless your heart.
Biden Time with Presidential Hopeful Kamala Smollett The Party of Fake Nooses Make America Break Again, Make America Broke Again Freeing Felons and Incarcerating Christians ~ One Noose at a Time Disney Endorses Sleepy and Grumpy for President Shackles never looked so good
You are nuts! You liberals always project! Biden is the one who can‚Äôt come out of his basement because he has dementia!
There might be reasons that Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate Trump, but your analogies make no sense. Joe McCarthy and Robert Welch didn‚Äôt run for President....also I‚Äôm pretty sure the first Presidential debate was Kennedy/Nixon. The next was Ford/Carter in 1976
Yep pretty obvious. They can‚Äôt pull Biden before the nomination due to his senility. He has to make it to the election. Bernie will do his utmost to deliver his bro‚Äôs. It would be too obvious if pulled him before because Bernie (who DNC hates)would show how corrupt the process is
Can only hope. But name recognition will siphon off some votes at the ballot. In 2016, there were 3 states that had only a 80k(?) Margin of winning in total. Thays a very small percentage. And west said he was doing this to hurt biden and help trump. Very unethical.
Is the shaking of your glass the DTs or your fear of the Biden/Harris ticket?
Oh this is funny. Trump actually thinks Biden could possibly be a bigger racist than him. Hilarious.
That is so sick!   I believe the black/Asian/white communities will vote for Biden/Harris before Trump!!  We need a REAL President!!!

Something Biden should definitely think about!  I do think that Biden is much tougher than Trump and his team think and definitely more cognitively fit.  Trump is the one who needs to beware! Remember ‚Äúcovfefe‚Äù?
Amazing,yet he, Comey, Strzuk, Clinton, Obama, Schiff, Pelosi, and so many more, all walk freely,no swat raid at gun point at their homes, nada. Now- Biden/Harris?Why?Please, action where your mouths are and indict these monsters, please!They‚Äôre literally destroying our country!
Just an innocent response. We have seen Biden over 40 years &amp; witnessed his horrible record. He should have to answer questions about it. Either he can‚Äôt defend it or he can‚Äôt remember it. Either way he must debate. You know he can‚Äôt
Biden is under no moral obligation to debate someone with no compunction about lying.
I was raised Catholic, not currently a practicing Catholic, but I am amazed that Biden is not challenged because of his stance on abortion! You can‚Äôt be a devout Catholic &amp; support abortion.

Biden vs. Trump: Where do the candidates stand on Social Security?  #FoxBusiness
any choice biden picked would be immensely better than pence.  whatever he has done if anything during his term.
I think this headline is sexist.  Could you imagine "Biden Embraces Durbin" or Biden Embraces Buttigieg" or "Trump Embraces Pence"? Uh-uh. It would have been "selects" or "announces." Do better, Chicago Tribune. #WeHaveHerBack #ChicagoTribune
When did the DNC nominate Biden?
Or they could just nominate Kamala Harris since Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt been Nominated yet
Biden is a strong leader who is respectful of others opions and take them into consideration when making a decision. A good leader will surround themselves with others that can give good information on the other side another set of eyes that may not see things the way he does.
Does  support this attempt by Democrats to destroy suburbs &amp; local control? If you have a ‚ÄúSave Main‚Äù sign in your yard in Glen Ellyn this is leaps &amp; bounds worse than anything you can imagine happening to your neighborhood #twill #AFFH
Morning everyone. I wanted to say something about reactions from last night. So, I know most of y'all are upset with Biden/Harris, I'm not happy either but let's really sit and think for a moment. Do we honestly really want another 4 years of Trump?
Biden DIDN‚ÄôT make the pick. The DNC and his handlers made the pick . Biden was just as surprised as the rest of us. He was like a kid getting a surprise birthday party ü•≥ üòé
A vote for Biden in the primaries was a vote for Trump. It is getting harder for the Biden camp to hide his dementia, and trying to get Kamala Harris, the HRC camp's choice as the inter-regnum candidate is gross and won't work.
Many us feel free to vote for someone other than Trump or Biden.
If I lived in a competitive state, I'd hold my nose and vote Biden/Harris. Ugh. I can't imagine a more perfect way to continue Biden's policies when he's deemed unable to serve etc, while also virtue signaling as the Democratic party is wont to do.
Why do any Libertarians care?  We were not voting for Biden anyway, right?
In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
Just ordered a Biden/Harris campaign sign and made a donation to the campaign.
Joe Biden's dementia isn't the path any country should take, his mental capacity, short-term memory issue and his global cognitive awareness is-rapidly deteriorating, it's sad yet clear
HAHAHA  got humiliated by Biden time and time again. It's truly the best comedy of the year.
In case you need more atheists to be disappointed by, here's Ayaan Hirsi Ali insanely claiming Biden wants Sharia Law.
MSNBernC pushed for Warren or Abrams to be Biden‚Äôs VP pick relentlessly.
Interesting. I‚Äôve never seen any group so scared to have their nominee debate as I have so much with Biden. What is the fear?

biden fumbled the bag fr
Don't see what new voters she brings to Biden that he didn't already have. And he wins California anyway.
All those characteristics Donald Trump and his worthless kids lack!!   Joe Biden and Kamala Harris bring decency back to the White House and bring us back to a position of power in the world!!üóΩ
Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate.  Someone at Fox 9 has a sense of humor.
üó≥ I am!! Biden/Harris all the way!!
Reporter: Mr. Biden, any comments on your selection of Kamala Harris as your running mate? Biden: Who's Biden?
Imagine his excitement when Biden hears who he chose.
I think that a Biden Harris ticket will appeal to cross over voters. The least ‚Äòscary‚Äô ticket the Dems could have put up. RVAT will be on board. Just need the left of the Left to vote too.
Obama: ‚ÄúNailed it‚Äù  Biden: ‚ÄúUh.......nailed her......or its‚Äù
Remember when Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a Racist?
Come on, gang. We all know  REALLY won that Biden VP race!!!
When Biden heard he picked Kamala Harris as his running made,  he responded, "darn, I wish he would've picked me".
Biden is Catholic. Harris is Baptist.   Republicans will still pretend they're godless.
Sorry Biden‚Äôs Presidential bid.
No surprise here for anyone who's watched his shift to the right. Biden chose Harris, so the former president of American Atheists says he'll consider four more years of Christian Right rule.
I guess I'm more concerned about what does she bring to the table. She doesn't court progressives. She doesn't court black people. She doesn't bring in purple states. Unknown what she actually brings that can make biden a stronger candidate other than optics
Where are you getting that info? I think Trump is a lot closer to Biden than the polls indicate, but I wouldn't guess that's from the black vote.
Biden goes to the same Catholic Church as my grandma in Delaware.
just said he‚Äôs surprised Biden picked  as his V.P. That  was so nasty to Joe Biden and more disrespectful than how Pocahontas was toward Sleepy Joe Biden.let that sentence sink in.
I know that is why I said Joe Biden is the President not Kamala.
Lets hope that need will not arise. please. I just want Joe Biden to have his turn. without putting him one foot in the grave!
Yes! I'm am beyond thrilled!!! Can't wait to send in my check, get my sign, and get to work to elect the Biden-Harris ticket!
I am thrilled that Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his Vice President mate.  I was hoping it would be her.  This is a very strong Democratic team for the 2020 race.
I am sooo EXCITED and looking forward to a landslide WIN in November as future VP Kamala described as ‚Äúa fearless fighter for the little guy and one of the country‚Äôs finest servants,‚Äù joins future President Biden in the November race. Every vote counts!!!

I disagree but we will see how she will work for everyone. I will pray for her &amp; her family to help us to regain our dignity across the world. I promise to support her as she moves forward. I hope she will support Joe Biden as he did Obama!  Remember Joe Biden is the President!
I wouldnt worry. From her latest tweet. ‚ÄúI allow myself to get roped into arguments with Star Trek Trolls because it allows me to argue about something *abstract* instead of something that matters. Such as: Sweet Jesus if Biden doesn't pick a VP who is at least marginally...‚Äù
In case anyone on the Biden/Harris campaign in listening I'll debase myself for $100, heck, I'll talk myself down to $50 for you
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate #SmartNews.It is most welcome and appropriate decision
Institutional racism is a thing that has to be addressed not laid at the feet of Biden/Harris.
Congratulations  ! Now we need all DuPage Dems to unite behind the Biden/Harris ticket and get intelligence, integrity, and a taste for justice back into the White House!
not bad, but biden should be double fisting ice cream cones
It's Biden/Harris. Thoughts?
Biden would win California without her. What other state does she help him win.
It isn't, but it's also not a new problem.  Putting in all on the shoulders of Biden and Harris is emotionally appealing I guess but it lets far too many people off of the hook.  How many politicians have you voted for that have actually made a real impact on this?
Going to pass busy celebrating Biden/Harris announcement! Actually you can count me out for any of your briefings which I don't listen to anyway?
Wait... #Biden just named Kamala his #VP running mate. Didn‚Äôt he just die?  James Kamala Harris should be a before and after puzzle on #WheelOfFortune. #RIPKamala
I raised my hand. I‚Äôm voting for Biden

Guess what Pence in many ways Biden is correct.
Let‚Äôs put it this way, if the ticket had been Biden/Klobuchar or Biden/Whitmer (or gasp, Biden/Buttigieg) I would have recognized the justification in being upset. Harris is a safe pick who has the potential to be a good VP and maybe helps set the stage for the next phase
biden is a throw away candidate like  romney was in 2012..... the DNC is setting up  for 2024.. 2028...... # totalcontrol
I don‚Äôt mind Harris, and I understand why the campaign thinks it‚Äôs the right choice. Harris is youngish, she has a resume and she‚Äôs not dumb. It‚Äôs not a horrible ticket. It‚Äôs not the choice I would of made, but then again Biden was not my initial choice for top of ticket either
i thoroughly enjoyed biden's trouncing of paul ryan in the vp debate, fwiw
A great pick. I was a Harris fan from the beginning and very happy Biden chose her.
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Joe Biden said he was going to tell me first. You lied, Joe, you lied.
Biden is a class act. This doesn‚Äôt surprise me one bit.
I am just so excited at the news!! Congratulations to Kamala Harris!! She will be great with Joe Biden!! There truly is a light at the end of the tunnel!!  My only disappointment: was looking forward to her being AG and going after Trump and family!!!
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist?
psh, this could‚Äôve been ANY Biden and Harris
Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate -  News
This is the worst possible choice Biden could have made for VP (right next to Stacy Abrams).Bad criminal justice record and bad policy positions.Can‚Äôt wait to see Harris acknowledge that she‚Äôs half- Indian for once in her political career at the DNC so she can score some points.
YES!!!! Biden/Harris 2020 #2020Election #BidenHarris2020
Maybe Biden is picking baby yoda
Biden: the pick is in!
As I said, I'll vote for Biden &amp; whoever. No need to snipe free thinkers or falsely elevate would be heroes. We're rooting for the same team, that shouldn't mean giving up individual opinions. My opinion wasn't veiled - Harris is ok (to me) &amp; still is.
Mikey, this is the Trump/Pence America!!!  The American people want competence. The American people want Joe Biden. The American people will speak on 11/3. Start packing.
Joe Biden could pick the superfecta at Churchill Downs, unless he says, "Rioting and looting are never acceptable and in a free society must be felt with swiftly and harshly.", he will lose, probably in spectacular fashion.
I don't get it. I'm voting for Biden.  Same with all my friends men and women.
Even better....Biden cut to Hillary, who then cuts to  who then introduces VP.
Pete Buttigieg. While I think he would be a fantastic choice, it is pretty clear, the DNC wants Biden to pick a women as his VP.
I figure get rid of Trump and the moment that is accomplished push hard against Biden, Democrats and every policy they put forth. As it should be
Trump pivots to the Asian scare

You know that the Obama admin's FBI and DHS set a precedent in the 2016 election that Trump can now use, don't you? This Russiagate nonsense is really peak Trump derangement syndrome. The whole "Biden is the Real Manchurian Candidate" Repub narrative writes itself..
Agreed this is not a good thing to do during a Pandemic I am glad to see others feel the same! I would like to wake up one day and just have a little bit of good news like JOE BIDEN IS ANNOUNCING HOS VP!
Agreed I am now getting very irritated as most I know and losing momentum. I contribute Everytime and support Biden but not happy about what feels like a tease day in and day out!
Opinion | The wreckage that Joe Biden might inherit in November - The Washington Post
Interesting. I was in the UP over the weekend and literally saw no Biden signs, multiple Trump signs and some interesting wordsmithing involving Gov Whitmer.....
Do it Biden. Put a black woman on the ticket.
I believe she was banned by her bank, Uber &amp; food delivery companies too. She faces now what we will face in a Biden presidency: persecution for speaking out and supporting  I pray she wins.
Trump: 'Some people would say men are insulted' by Biden choosing a woman as VP
To the person that wrote the Biden tweet you got the name wrong
Actually Russia will become a bigger threat if Biden is President. China will strengthen their alliance
I think Biden will announce tomorrow that he'll make his announcement on Thursday. The announcement will be a fundraising event. They'll want to give people a heads up and let them donate money in exchange for being the "first" to know. They won't make an unannounced announcement
I have a tough time believing Pete will get a cabinet position. Mayor of South Bend is really not a qualifying resume. I know Biden owes him something in exchange for ending his campaign, I just can't imagine what.

Biden's jaunty bike ride quip was everything Trump's not: athletic, lucid, and funny
The fact we have to chose between Biden and Trump tells me how poor of a job these politicians have done. They‚Äôre supposed to be public servants but is not, we work to serve them.
I am ha[[y for her to still have a job. However this is an all out war we are fighting to get rid of trump. Once that is done we can try to get back to normal. Just hang in there, &amp; keep up the good work. Pray that our next president is Joe Biden.
Joe Biden situation is pretty sad
Let's get Biden‚Äôs words out there‚Ä¶
Supporting? They are organizing, funding &amp; promoting it. Biden is incapable of dealing with it. Let him keep riding his bike &amp; let adults with a functional brain deal with it.
Out of sheer curiosity, I looked up the cognitive test both Trump and Biden boasted about "passing." If it's a standard 'MCA' board measuring just cognitive FUNCTION, an actual question on the thing is: "What is THIS animal?"   Feel free to answer, btw.
Not sure how.  I'm sure this will kill my chances of becoming president, but Biden will be ok.
I think Biden should give his acceptance speech either at the Lincoln Memorial or either the WWII or Viet Nam memorials.
I follow politics pretty closely and don‚Äôt believe I have read or seen Biden people ‚Äúcrowing.‚Äù This is the second time today I have wondered about your comments.
No, she's right; all you need do is look at Biden's upward-trending polling numbers.
Make it a triple endorsement by Biden, Obama, and Hillary Clinton.  Just for good measure, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Adam Schiff can all approve of it after release.
Except in cases of landslide (I'll call Hawaii for Biden today, but I can't say by how much).
Because Hillary Clinton was polling ahead of Trump, and narrowly lost the Electoral College anyway (thanks, James Comey). So if Biden's ahead of her, maybe he won't lose. I don't care about polling; I'm gunning for Nixon's #18M record margin. It is unlikely, but possible.
Mr Biden, my son &amp; daughter-in-law are working for minimal hours- less than pre- Covid, but had to go back &amp; have no assistance making up lost income! Unemployment supplement does not help them - so please remember this group as well !
I hope they don't change the LTCG tax rate but do you think there will be a dip in the market if Biden wins the election?

Now that Kanye is admitting to being on the ballot to steal votes from Biden, I think it would be fair if GW Bush went on record saying Kanye West doesn't care about black people.
I would bet late this week for Biden's announcement, but who knows.
Joe Biden is a fake Catholic, fake leader, fake Democrat, real socialist, real thief, real crooked politician, real child abuser. Sorry, but that is truly what he is.
She's been treated unfairly. Personally attacked w/o evidence. Now you're getting another stab in. She endorsed Biden, getting a lot of gruff from her supporters for doing so. I agree with her on that choice too but keep it up &amp; more of her antiwar Dems might stay home etc.
It‚Äôs good to know Joe Biden isn‚Äôt the only one In the Democrat party that has completely lost all cognitive abilities
She endorsed Biden. I'd really love to talk to you about all of this. If someone is not being honest, and getting paid etc by someone w/ an overriding interest in manipulating public in some direction is a good reason to suspect them, that makes sense. But that's not happening.
Isn't that litterly the same thing that Trump fanatics do whenever Biden talks? lol
Stop calling each other names and blocking those you disagree with.  I was blocked because I had said Biden could not tell his sister and wife apart. I am not saying that because I am making fun of Biden. I said it because I think he has dementia.
November 3 will be a Biden landslide due to Trump's complete and utter incompetence.  He's nothing but a (New York) City slicker with penchant for bullsh¬°t. SDNY, do your absolute best to get the Trumps off the street.
That's largely been the program for corporatist Dems like Biden.
Hey Fox News why does  Biden have to pick a black I thought it was the best qualified Just to get the black vote That's what's wrong with this country today
You can always criticize her arguments or positions. If Biden goes on FoxNews and makes his typical campaign pitch, shouldn't that be encouraged?
6/ Employers (unlike Trump) are not dumb.  They see what's happening to the economy.  They can appreciate the pressures the next Congress is going to be under with a Biden administration to put science first and get the economy back on track.

If Biden shows up to the debates with a walker like Weinstein showed up for court, we he get sympathy votes.
Yes but Dems msm ignore &amp; won‚Äôt report on hidden Biden.  It‚Äôs a breath of fresh air to have different views &amp; chat yet not start screaming at each other.

Biden and Harris roll out was on EVERY network including Fox state run news. Trump followed up with a briefing that was only carried on Fox fake news.
Biden and Lincoln Project should make an ad with his words and run it on all the battleground states. Hellooooooo where is Mike Bloomberg???
Biden knows his days are numbered.  Probably wishes the election wasn't until 2021.  Hillary's help is never help.
Remember in 2016 when Hillary was winning the polls and was supposed to win the election?  And then the silent majority voted.  That was awesome!  Don't listen to fake polls.  I don't believe 51% feel Biden/Harris is a winning combination.   #Trump2020

Kamala and Biden are awkward...
Biden is incoherent. He might be adjudicated and then Kamala will become President.
I totally agree! Oh, wait... This isn't a satire account. Shit, sorry. Hard pass on bumbling Biden and morally flexible Harris...
I would much rather complain to Biden/Harris about how we need Medicare for all or debt forgiveness than to Trump about putting up a border wall or banning people from muslim countries.
Russian or not what does that have to do with her calling Biden a racist on national tv? Answer: nothing, just a classic deflection tactic used by sensitive snowflakes

Believe it or not Trump has done more for this country than any other President. And you Libs think Biden can do the job when half the time he doesn‚Äôt know where he is.
Biden/Harris: Medicare for some, small american flags for others!
So, is it safe to say, you believe Joe Biden would have the same influence/success?
The matter of fact she will eat biden too if he got elected üòÇ
But the thing is, we already have given away are bargaining chip when Bernie got robbed. So now why not move on and work with what we have? Not voting in a state that actually matters (if that‚Äôs you, idk where you live) and getting Trump reelected is worse imo then Biden
I just believe that great change comes from the people not the president. Trump won‚Äôt budge on these issues but I think we can get the Biden administration to listen to us. That‚Äôs why i get upset when those on the left bash biden pre-election and play into the rights plan
I think that the Dems are under the most pressure rn then they have been in a while. They know if they get into office and don‚Äôt deliver that big cities and states will flip to the right. Get Biden in and fight for change. Wishing for the perfect candidate that‚Äôll never come 1/2
You know, you‚Äôre just pissing people off with this BS Harris hate-a-thon tweeting and making people even more enthusiastic to vote Biden/Harris. You‚Äôd think you‚Äôd be cleaver enough to figure that out. Oh wait! You‚Äôre a Republican, never mind.
Seeing that Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs runningmate is so sad I was really rooting for my girl Stacey :(
No problem with that. I just know that there‚Äôs many who aren‚Äôt fortunate enough to risk another 4 years of Trump. Some may disagree and say Biden is just as bad but that‚Äôs all opinion I guess
Kudos to Joe Biden for choosing Senator Kamala Harris for his running mate!!!
Literally fuck kamala biden already messin shit up
Bill, normally true, but given this election cycle and the untested  performance ability of Joe Biden, I‚Äôm not so sure.
#WEGOTUSA!Biden/Harris 2020! Trend it now!
I think its the complete opposite. It‚Äôs the privileged middle class that rather ‚Äúmake a point‚Äù and not vote for Biden thus playing into Trumps re-election chances which hurts poor communities way more. You may not understand unless you experience it. Also what about the SCOTUS?
That‚Äôs an oxymoron... You want a POTUS that‚Äôs smarter than a 5th grader, but are dying to vote for Biden? Sheesh. Educate yourself.
Paying attention to my feelings (that have not typically been representative), I‚Äôm excited to campaign for Biden/Harris when my attitude about Biden was ‚Äúok I guess‚Äù
i think that undervalues the weight peoples thoughts hold. Trump is in people‚Äôs heads 24/7 and people are angrier than ever. If biden is a bandaid i rather have a bandaid then nothing. It‚Äôs always up to the people to bring about change anyways.
But that‚Äôs how it is right now that‚Äôs the thing. We play with the cards we get. It‚Äôs obviously a strong difference of opinion but I just rather have Biden/Harris over Trump for the next 4 years.
Because one republican is worse (imo) than the other. I just think getting them into office first and then coming together to push for what we want is smarter than campaigning against Biden when it‚Äôs obviously either him or Trump
As someone who is left-leaning. I think the smart thing to do is get them in office and then come together and push to get what we want. I think promoting anti-biden/harris ideals before the election is dangerous since so many are already looking for any reason not to vote biden
" is the best person to help me take this fight to Donald Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021,‚Äù Harris, who is 55, is a graduate of  and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority  via

Agreed, and honestly i don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs many of them that were actually not going to vote for Biden. Harris does attract the moderates though who are truly on the fence.
Whooweee now I really REALLY hope Biden doesn‚Äôt win. I mean I don‚Äôt think he will, but I think Kamala Harris is awful.
Biden/Harris 2020! DUMPTRUMP 11/3/2020!
MSNBC, your canadate is Joe Biden, and you‚Äôre going to attack Trump on one miss statement !!  üòÇüòÇüòÇ a fair and inpartial journalist would point out dementia Joe‚Äôs miss quotes but that doesn‚Äôt fit the MSNBC/CNN/ABC/CBS/NBC/ect...narrative
Joe Biden can't remember a speech that is literally in his face, but you expect him to remember you if by some miracle he wins and the dems don't throw him out in 6 months? You have to be more delusional than Joe himself. Please come out of the basement Joe we need entertainment.
The more U pick on Biden the more Dem's will love him!  How about something meaningful? The South China Sea?  Kim?  Iran?  Sending the American People a paycheck?  Put food in R stomach, pay some bills, or do something other than pick on poor Joe!
I hope Biden name his whole cabinet. That would be a fun convention. We would dance to the ballot box Nov 3 üòÉ
Biden VP pick announced at like 3:00 AM confirmed
The ‚Äú1917‚Äù pandemic helped end the Second World War because the soldiers got sick. And Joe Biden needs a cognitive test.

I will continue to donate donate donate to Lincoln Project and Joe Biden. Keep my family and friends updated with trump corruptions by texts and social media so they don‚Äôt hv too watch 24/7 like me.
NE-01 is one I've had my eye on for a while, I definitely don't think it's this close, but if Biden can hit Obama 08 numbers here (R+10), then he's doing real good.
Just to show how much politics can change in 24 years, a Biden win map this year will look almost nothing like this. Yeah he'll win the Native American areas and the Tucson area, but he'll have to win Maricopa in order to flip the state.
Didn‚Äôt the IG‚Äôs from multiple agencies investigate this at nauseam already? Sounds like a Benghazi witch hunt looking to turn up some dirt on Biden. Like a certain SOS‚Äôs emails?
He hasn't struggled to contain the virus.  Struggle means to persevere against the odds not to roll up in his pathetic cocoon and blame everyone and everything else including China,WHO, Antifa, Dems and Biden.
Anybody got footage of the Biden boat parade?
Sorry but  has had too much kool-aid.  As Biden says,  C'mon man!  Do you even believe your own words?
We need GOV Andrew Cuomo at the top of our ticket. He would put Trump in his place. Biden needs to get outgage. They are stealing the election.
Biden says Trump executive order is 'a reckless war on Social Security'
While Biden sleeps, deals with the Democrats would lead to an economic contraction in the United States of America.
Trump said Biden ‚Äòhurt God.‚Äô Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith.
I‚Äôm voting for him because I want Trump our of office. Biden is not an ideal candidate, but I look forward to the country‚Äôs leadership to go back to normal. He‚Äôs going to be a boring but competent president.
At this point I don't think it matters who Biden picks as his VP running mate.  They all have dirt that Trump is eager to dust!
We can‚Äôt keep taking from the land without giving something back. Big mining companies just want to take, them leave the devastation for future generations to worry about. Biden is right. Find other good ways for people to make a living.
Of course they are! Who didn‚Äôt think they weren‚Äôt.
Thank you.
You can see the racism behind Joe Biden with ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll black are the same‚Äù statements. Meanwhile Trump is praying with Black politicians in the Oval Office.
The #TrumpVirus is from a bat not China!  The USA is doing so bad because  is THE WORST President ever and did nothing in January but call #COVID19 a hoax.  Mr. President THAT IS ON YOU!!  is going to beat your ass!  #Biden2020 #JoeBiden2020 #Biden
I wonder who controls Biden's Tweets... They're far too coherent to be of his own doing. And to think, if he wasn't such a socialist and racial extremist, he may have been able to further lead the blind. Sorry Joe, the American people are AWAKE! #SayNoToJoe #TrumpPence2020
and screaming about Biden wanting to hurt the Bible and God.  Ridiculous.
That‚Äôs stupid. Biden and an iguana would work for me.
Donald Trump should not hold his breath waiting for African American voters to swing over to his side.  A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll showed that Joe Biden has 80% of the African American vote to Donald Trump's 6%.
To anyone that truly thinks Joe Biden is a racist you are an idiot. His comments were misguided and perhaps misspoken. No man cares more about the minority population of this country than Joe Biden. I think we should give him a pass on this one.Biden to step aside and allow Bernie to be voted in (which he overwhelmingly was). He's pulling a Hillary with the DNC and deserves to lose.

Split the vote? But us libertarian will be inclined to go towards trump and hurt Biden?
So me being a white male with no college degree for whom Biden is far too much a race-baiting conservative puts me in the remains 2 percent?
I'm pretty grossed about by rich liberal democrats praising Kamala and Biden.   So insanely out of touch holy hell.
Is this surprising at all? Police are trained and become masters of sniffing out bs. Everyone knows Biden is full of it...even if they do vote for him.
Just the city of Fort Wayne? I definitely think so. Obama won Fort Wayne in 2008, Romney narrowly won it in 2012, and Trump carried it 51%-44%-5% in 2016. I definitely think Biden could be poised to make big gains in Fort Wayne, and possibly Allen County overall.

We‚Äôre on the side of the workers and of democracy.  #SaveUSPS
I think you would be hard pressed to find a vulnerable group who would not be harmed more by a second Trump term than by a Biden term. That's who I'm voting to protect. I'll be relatively fine regardless of who's president. Other people are not as lucky.
And yeah, Biden's going to be very disappointing on many issues. I will be right there with you criticizing him. But even small steps towards progressive policy are still steps we should take when we can.
I'm really sorry that happened and the state party definitely needs to clean house.  I'm still voting Biden over Trump tho.   Right now in 2020 it's a binary choice.
#BREAKING The National Association of Letter Carriers, a union with almost 300,000 active and retired postal workers, endorses Joe Biden, warning that the ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù of USPS is at stake.

Are Biden or Harris thrice divorced adulterers? Are they the ones going around paying for sex or sexually abusing people? Are they the ones that can't recite a Bible phrase? There's no "winning" these so called evangelicals who are already voting for Trump. Fool's errand.
WEIGH IN: Do you think a nationwide mask mandate should be issued?
Oh jeez man. Her dad's Jamaican. Shes obviously black. You see what I mean? Who gives a shit? Why are arguing over how black she is?   Trump called for a complete ban on Muslims. But Biden is the racist since Kamala isnt black enough?
Not true. He terminated it on September 5th 2017.     But tell me more how BIDEN is the racist. Thats good stuff.
Trump Encourages Racist Conspiracy Theory on Kamala Harris
Trump said he didnt want people from shithole African countries. Trump said all people from Haiti have AIDS. Trump said a judge should recuse himself since he was Mexican.   Tell me more about what Biden said. Im really interested in hearing how BIDEN is the racist.
Again, a whole new level of STUPID. You want me to believe that Biden is somehow a closet KKK racist despite serving under Obama, choosing Harris, speaking out against police brutality against black men etc etc.  But tell me more about Byrd. Its so interesting.
See what I mean? So Byrd was a KKK member, quit, spoke out against KKK the rest of his life.  Biden was friends with Byrd. Biden serves as VP to a black president. Biden chooses a black woman as HIS VP.   And you want me to believe WHAT now?
My clear hatred for Trump? I think the level of stupid is horrible for our country. Voting by mail (which weve been doing for decades) is now bad! Kamala isnt eligible! Obama and Biden spied on me! Uranium one! Hunter Biden! Seth Rich!  And it just keeps going and going..
LOL. Obama told Trump, to his face, dont hire Flynn.  Again, a whole new level of stupid. If Obama or Biden committed a crime, by all means "lock them up". Nothing happens because they didnt do anything.  Now Stone, Gates, Papadopolis, Flynn, Manafort, Cohen...
LOL. Dont make excuses for his bullshit. He wants people to believe absurdities. Kamala's not eligible. Vote by mail is fraudulent. Except in Florida.   And youre comparing this crap to anything Biden or Harris has said? Thats just today, man.
So 33 years ago, Biden said he was in top half of his law school (records indicate he was in bottom half).  Ok. How many things will Trump will make up, on the spot, during his press conference? Whats the over/under? 10?
Because I know Obama/Biden would only implement a travel ban if there was a legitimate security risk. Im not so stupid as to forget this:

It you follow me you know I‚Äôm not someone who cheered on Biden or Harris in primaries   But they are now the obvious choice in November   My hope is that Democrats see the rise of actual left wing candidates in their party and realize that the old party line Dems need to change
We know Biden‚Äôs history   We also see a different Trump tweet every day that pushes racist ideology   Does that matter?
No one doubts that Biden has made problematic statements and policies- the funny thing is the new line of attack is that he‚Äôs listening to outside perspectives within his party.   And as a Trump supporter are you really going to pretend incendiary racial commentary bothers you?

Biden Mocked For Apparently Using Script During Call Asking Kamala Harris To Join Ticket
Joe Biden and Camel Harris admit that their primary plan of attack on Trump is his response to COVID (an inverted reality for sure). However, what if the plandemic never happened? What would their strategy be then? That alone tells you COVID is a political tool, not a real crisis
Judge Jeanine is simply stating the obvious. Biden is not fit to run, Democrats want a first female POTUS. Democrats murder people (eg, #ClintonBodyCount, #SethRich). They'll kill Biden to put Harris on top. Now Democrats are trying to blame Pirro for what THEY are planning

If Biden wins, he should seriously consider hiring an interpreter.  Think Luther from  but for a senile, boring old white dude.
A great interview by  with Jonathan Weinzapfel, the Dem nominee for Indiana Attorney General. A lot of people have been sleeping on this race, but if Biden can get into the mid-40s in Indiana (which I think is very possible), Dems can absolutely flip the AG's office.
Just for clarification, can you please tell me those teachings about murder and abortion from Vatican? Do really Mr. Biden endorse they? You can claim he is the best option but don't elevate him to holiness.

CNN's  just claimed that saying Democrats want to keep blacks enslaved is a racist comment in criticizing  victory. Didn't Joe Biden say Republicans wanted to "put y'all [blacks] back in chains?"  So by CNN's own standards, Joe Biden is a racist
I can‚Äôt help but feel that Biden might serve as head of state while Harris acts as chief executive.
I was voting for Biden regardless but I'm thrilled he picked  to run alongside him. She was my first choice for President. I'm also thrilled I can rekindle my mad crush on  when SNL returns.

Guilt and shaming people to vote for Hillary Clinton worked so well , I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to work again.  Seriously, if people didn‚Äôt vote for Hillary, and won‚Äôt for Biden/Harris for the same reason, maybe the party should try to appeal to those people instead.

Probably. He's already caused a rift in the left. There are people who are actually considering voting for him over Biden.
No because at his worse Biden is a much better person than Trump will ever be
A yes, let‚Äôs throw out the classic Biden gaffes when discussing Jorgenson. Nice pivoting
Whoever he picks will work for me Biden could pick a sponge with toothpicks for eyes and I'd still vote for him However all of these women are wonderful and I will support him completely
Joe Biden's campaign song.... Tomorrow.
Just as the enlightenment era came after the dark ages, Biden shall help the sun to come up tomorrow.

Regardless of how you feel about her policies, we're never going to break away from the 2-party duopoly crisis until we allow third party candidates to participate in the election.  The fact that we got tough-on-drugs Biden as the pro-BLM candidate is why we need to #LetHerSpeak.
With all due respect, Joe Biden is one of the politicians responsible for the war on drugs &amp; mass incarceration. He has the illusion of being progressive, but this country needs real legitimate change and Jo Jorgensen is the only candidate who wants to free nonviolent prisoners.
And that should be enough to make you NOT vote for Biden!!
biden#racism I think that joe is only considering black women for his vp is extremely racist.
Biden risks alienating young Black voters after race remarks

I do not support Trump at all. I use Trump as a metaphor as souls consumed by the evil inclinations, our darker angels. Biden draws and and shines Light for illuminating his darkness to the rest.

Joe Biden is a political heliotrope, drawing and channeling Light for the benefit of One Nation Under God. Trump is an autocratic phototrope, demanding that electorate draw sparks from him. (that they should feel greatful for the minute sparks they receive!)

Well, Biden isn't currently in office, so "gotten done" isn't something we can talk about with him.  But yeah the so-called president is golfing this weekend. Maybe the Libertarians will replace the Republican Party some have shown they have principles.
Pulling apart USPS to hobble mail in voting   Russians and Ukrainians working together  with Trump subordinates to attack Biden  Voter suppression   Blocking attempts to secure our elections   Trump and the  are destroying our Republic in broad daylight
Objectively speaking, both mainstream candidates are appalling, hence why 3rd party candidates are necessary in accordance with a democracy. However, the idea that Jorgenson is somehow siphoning votes away from Biden is ludicrous
As she should. Biden‚Äôs a terrible human being, while Jorgenson is a super candidate!
I'll be curious to see how ***the justices*** try to square it.  And I can't wait for the three debates with Biden.  They're going to be a laff riot.

I hope Biden's team, his attorneys, anyone in our government has been preparing counteraction for when this goes down. Personally, I can't take much more of this and I'm suffering. Watching the transition to authoritarianism while people cheer it on is just too much.
What failure in the Obama/Biden WH? They led with dignity and class. Economy was turned around after the worse recession not prompted by a global pandemic, but greed. If politicians had the American ppl on their minds, we‚Äôd have health care that makes sense. The man n WH b/c of u
Me too! I am so anxious I can barely sleep. It is heart-rending to watch those who know better and can do better stand by and do nothing! I am so sad, but so ready to stand and vote. Biden/Harris 2020
People just remember the vote is not just for Biden-Harris. It's also to replace Bill Barr, Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper, Betsy Devos, and the entire corrupt regime......we need change now so don‚Äôt forget to vote.
I do.  I don‚Äôt want any doubters at this time. Trump has got to go. If Biden/Harris do not do what the American people can respect, they can go too in 2024. Democracy is at stake with that guy in the WH!
Yes! I hope there are fewer like you. If Chump is doing so many unconstitutional things out in the open, I can only imagine what‚Äôs going on beneath the surface. Biden/Harris 2020.

Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.

As the A.G she failed at running her office, then she failed at managing her campaign, but somehow she's right to manage the country when Biden dies. We should promote her for incompetence and poor management skills. ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this, but this is NOT the election to push for a 3rd party. it‚Äôs just not.   please vote biden-harris. tr*mp needs to get the fuck out of the white house
I question whether there were any intentions in the part of Biden at all. I do think that the hadith is in line with modern Dems attempt at totalitarianism and the silencing of speech.

Bill, just say it.... you back Biden, a Democrat
I kept on smiling the entire time that she and Joe Biden were speaking.
Or Biden saying it from a cue  card thinking it said aunt Jemima
I would ask to be put up for adoption if my mom got me a JOE BIDEN ACTION FIGURE
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt give a shit. People all up in arms about Harris and all the shit a he‚Äôs done in the past. Same with Biden. Im like they‚Äôre all pieces of shit. Who cares. Both parties. People worrying about shit that will never concern them.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
This is who Biden chose? ü•¥
Really is this simple. But your life is still fine, so just keep voting and saying yes to the system. You don‚Äôt choose your place in time, but you can choose to make it better. It‚Äôs deeper than Trump/Biden.   You watched home alone? Read what that child star tells you with his xp

Biden and Harris what a team against Trump and his corruption
#KamalaHarris will push #joebiden out of the way once the squad and Bernie is in the Biden administration I say within a year or two
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday.
The left has called every Republican from Ronald Reagan to Bush 41,43, McCain, and Romney, who was laughed at for calling Russia our geopolitical foe in 2012, a fascist. According to recent intelligence Russia wants Trump but China and Iran want Biden. Where are you from?
Trump picked a racist white dude who was a failed governor as VP. Biden picked an accomplished woman of color. I think we know who cares about America.

Idk how I'm going to vote. All choices are super terrible in regards to decency (Trump) and policy/philosophy (Biden/Harris). That's not to say I don't have disagreements with Trump but I have more disagreements with Biden/Harris. I'd be on board had it been Klobuchar
I honestly can't vote for Biden/Harris. Tbh I'm not a fan of Trump either. I don't like his conduct, his hardline stance on immigration or his overall more protectionist leanings. I'm more with Reagan/Romney/McCain on policy &amp; philosophy. Idk what to do this election.
And yet I still can't vote for Biden/Harris. I had an emotional reaction after the announcment to vote for Trump but idk. The only good GOPer on my ballot that i have more in common on policy is my great governor of Indiana  and I'll happily vote for him.
Kamala doesn‚Äôt have the trust of the black community. They crucified her during the debates for her actions as AG of California from 2011-17 and DA 2004-2011. She was a sharp enemy of Biden then and threw lots of low blows...now they‚Äôre partners? Doesn‚Äôt look good.
still cant believe out of 27 candidates we even got Joe Biden
the Internet moves extremely fast. pictured: Joe Biden and sgt. Kamala Harris arresting young activist Bernie Sanders for peacefully protesting (1964)
And she on the reecord calling Biden is a racist and a rapist. Should be fun watching her reinvent that narrative.
Sorry, I don't like Trump or his more nationalist &amp; protectionist policies but it doesn't mean I can just turn my back on conservative policy positions I've had since before him and enthusiastically endorse the far-left Biden/Harris ticket.
It's one thing to oppose Trump for his demeanor and say you'll vote Biden just to get rid of Trump but they are enthusiastically supporting policy positions opposed by the GOP even before Trump. That says something about the "principled" folks.
#KamalaHarris2020 is this country next POTUS first woman and she doesn't need to run she just going to slide into the positions because Biden not going to finish his term #TheFive
I honestly can't tell if Biden's campaign is like really dense on purpose rn
I wasn't going to vote in this election. I didn't like the choices of Trump or Biden, however, with the thought of far-left Kamala Harris a heartbeat away from the presidency I'll hold back my vomit and vote for Trump.
Trump vs Biden Pence vs Harris  I'm looking forward to the debates.
For the record a brown paper bag is better than Mike Pence as VP. Love Harris as Biden‚Äôs running mate! #KamalaHarrisForVP #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBiden2020
Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Whoever would you vote for Biden.  You do realize the ol Bernie here advocates for communism right?  And Biden is fully on board with that?
And finally. Basically it doesn‚Äôt matter who Biden picks. We must get racism, hate, and incompetence out of the #WhiteHouse #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
Biden VP candidates that he could pick and not lose my vote a thread #Biden2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteTrumpOut Hela from Thor

No, but Jr. might run or DeSantis or Pompeo. So yes, more Trump. That's why Biden's VP pick is so important. She needs to be able to beat one of the above right-wing nuts.
The Obama/Biden administration said that and now #Joebiden needs blacks to vote for him
Nope. Riden with Biden all the way! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Why don't  make Jill Biden his wife his vice president since she knows everything about him, then they truly would be a real first family. #FoxandFriends
Its true and its an historical accomplishment. Criticize our "system" all you like, make alterations if you can track the results but by no mean "fundamentally change" it. That's madness and that's what Biden says he wants to do.
So you're basically a hypocrite. Chastising people for wanting to vote for Biden because they hate Trump, but you're voting for Trump because of some BS lies about Biden. Makes perfect sense. What rock have you been under with all the racist shit Trump has said/done?
What keeps me up at night is wondering if our votes will count if Russia changes them. Or that mailed ballots get lost. That people will believe the fake dirt on Biden they'll kick up. That they'll actually arrest Biden. I wonder what we can do to stop it.
I‚Äôm pissed and offended at the Republican Party for thinking that we would vote for crazy ass Kayne instead of Biden in the first place...we were done with Kayne years ago
Oh God! He‚Äôs attacking Dems, Biden, mail in voting...they‚Äôre trying to steal the election.  You‚Äôre getting interference from Russia again, you slowed the mail, so, who‚Äôs stealing the election?  Babbling sack of shit.
You. Are. Lying. But guess what? I do not care what kind of fabricated bs Bill Barr or your committee releases on Biden before the election. I will vote for him anyway and declare that if Trump can do it, so can Biden. FATWO
Biden‚Äôs been the nominee for months, you can‚Äôt equate Obama and Clinton picking since they had actual competitive primaries.......
It‚Äôs not true that Joe Biden is a predator? Are you okay? ü•¥
Trump has the vote fix in on the US side by sabotaging the USPS and Russia has the fix in with hacked voting machines and fabricated dirt on Biden. This is all I think about along with COVID.
Don‚Äôt let Ye trying to take votes from Biden distract y‚Äôall from the fact that Rick Ross had a masseuse, and 2 Chainz brought ‚ÄúEssential Workers‚Äù to their Verzuz #iykyk
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
From attacking Biden saying he wants to ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù then question Joe‚Äôs faith, to constantly attacking Democrats.  Donald has been an evil, lying, hateful, unintelligent, arrogant waste of space for decades and he‚Äôs escalating so he won‚Äôt go to jail.
Your giving Biden too much credit here sir.
How can he get away with this? Its always the same. Biden does not the the Black community can think.. So when does the R word come into play? He does not respIct. (Al) the back people.It also allows for more ideas to get seriously considered. The way it stands now, I have to vote Biden. He‚Äôs the closest candidate for me. We just need to keep demanding more once he‚Äôs in office. At least there is a chance of that with him. I don‚Äôt see us surviving Trump again
And it‚Äôs weird to think that there‚Äôs more distance between Jimmy Carter and Joe Biden today as it was from Hoover to 1960 Nixon
You falsely claim without evidence that something is wrong with Biden, but you‚Äôre not concerned about an individual capable of this soliloquy?
Pretty funny you claim without evidence that Joe Biden has Alzheimer‚Äôs but are unconcerned about the mental capacity of someone who said this.
Am I the only one confused why in 2020 our only options to vote is to mail it in or go do it in person? I can do literally anything and everything with my money on my phone but i can‚Äôt select A) Joe Biden/Kamala Harris
as a woman, I, too am upset when potlicians try to ensure that I am heard and respected. it fucking pisses me off when they try to represent my marginalized voice. FUCK.  pssst Biden is really just trying to hit on every single American woman collectively at the same time. Sick.
Did he just endorse Biden?
It‚Äôs an interesting/semi compelling premise: elect Biden so libs see our problems are w/ capitalism and not the GOP.   BUT it‚Äôs kinda ahistorical, and certainly not a factual premise to frame the debate around. He cites freaking socialism in Weimar Germany for chrissakes!
I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs necessarily wrong either, or that I think you shouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden; just that he‚Äôs a loser bully who likes the smell of his own farts more than organizing.
I would pay money to hear Biden say "Step into the cage if you've got the cojones. I will DESTROY you!
I‚Äôm already nervous about the scenario where Biden/Harris win, and even though Gavin Newsom controls the seat until 2022, how often do midterms turn out well for the incumbent President‚Äôs party?
Do whatever you want, just stop trying to vote shame leftists on Twitter.  We're not voting for Biden, we don't care what you think about it, that's our right.
By Republicans who voted in the Democrat primary.  Just like the DNC is courting Republican support rn.  Your team has made it clear they don't care for our votes.  Start making phone calls to people who might actually vote for Biden instead of harassing left twitter.
The one house on our street that had a Kamala Harris sign in their yard during the primary put it back out next to a Biden sign and honestly I'm really happy for them.
Maybe if Biden becomes president China will own the US by deploying a biological weapon (virus) against which only the US proves utterly defenseless. üßê
I think the only boats that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to see are in their own bath tub along with a rubber ducky.üòÇ
Ok.... any Looney left person challenge Biden if he wants a second term or Harris if he doesn't... Will receive a great beating .
EXACTLY.  Nope. Biden is responsible for driving folks out.
this will never happen but if rihanna ever said ‚Äúif biden wins I‚Äôll release the album‚Äù i would start canvassing immediately üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Do what you can!  I'll be annoying talking about white voters as a black woman on a ticket doesn't mean Biden reaches Obama black turn out and margins .  I'm not putting that on Kamala as VP.  It's not fair to expect that.
It is Joe Biden's job to get that union vote back up. Harris and her history with labor can HELP...she's insurance... not a liablity. Harris shedding tears  and "telling her story" isn't what labor wants to hear. They want to here this story how she protected union rights.
It's JOE BIDEN'S JOB TO GET TO 40/70/90 AND WIN.  Like Biden in 08 and 12...Kamala is insurance for where Joe is SOFT.  Obama as a Midwest Democrat was gonna win there without Biden... but Obama didn't take any chances. It start and ends with Joe and his Story.  Alrighty!
I need white men to give Biden the 41 percent support that You gave Obama In 2008.  Black women don't need to do anymore than what they've done already.  Harris is NOT RESPONSIBLE for driving black turnout to give white folks an out on voting this guy out.  Go fix your bloc.
The Left needs to move its machinery into antiwar mode. Biden will likely win and he will start a war if he does.
The woman cried talking about her mother and healthcare.... couldn't hold it in anymore... but she supposed to Sob because Biden used the sense God Gave a billygoat and selected a woman with 13 years executive experience and three statewide wins?  How did Hillary do this shit?
YES I STAND WITH THE BIDEN  HARRIS TEAM WIN
She will LOSE challenging Biden or Harris in 2024.  Let's see if she can win statewide first.
5 PCS Biden Harris Magnets Sticker
To all the skeptics I would like to say the Dem ticket isn't perfect bc nothing else is. Democracy is a work in progress. You should save your energy to plan for a world that is more perfect. Biden has proven he is willing to change with appointing KAMALA HARRIS. Let see how
Sheila Nix, an Oak Parker and veteran of the Obama White House, has been named a senior advisor to Sen. Kamala Harris.   story:
Doesn't sound like you want or will vote for Biden?
That's why I STAN LABOR.... that's the club I claim.   Before IUOE I was teamster 710.  This matters as black and Brown middle class depends on unionization.  My pop wore this button on the left when Clinton won union voters by 30. I hope in 20 biden can get back to plus 20.
Obama Democrat.  It's his party.  Biden is a Obama Democrat.
They're going to hit Biden on the Dem voter fraud in the primaries with more than just rhetoric. Bernie people who decided to do all to be helpful in giving that cover, hope you have your thinking hats on. üßêü§î
just ordered my mail-in ballot so maybe democrats will stop harassing me all day? wait, ‚Äújust vote‚Äù has an invisible asterisk where i‚Äôm only supposed to vote for Joe Biden? hmm
Biden wants to cut SS lmao
Did Biden grow up around Racists?  I'm sure he did and like many Irish Catholics I lived around and befriended in life those who hated  how they were raised and tried to do better.   I see Joe in that light.
Really he hasn't done anything in 47 years let's promised all kinds of things. He said a lot of racist things add video. You guys are going to lose real Americans don't like you. you're saying that his supporters there's probably a hundred people that want to vote for Joe Biden.
I think dude was a Warren fan.  Meh. The far left took an L.  Now they'll hope Biden/Harris will lose to prove a point.
They figured no way Biden picks her after she hit him in his snot locker in front of 18 million folks last June.   I didn't think he would... figured he would hold a grudge.   He used the sense God Gave a billygoat and 50 million bucks raised later it seems to be well Received.
Carol Moseley Braun of all people KNOW how it is to challenge white men...for a sista to hit another sista and call it Ambition was Deeply disappointing to me. I haven't looked at Carol with the same respect I had for her since.
All my jokes aside, this pretty much encapsulates all I feel about Harris. She and Rice were my last choices, and even still, I think I would've preferred Susan Rice.   I'm going to vote for Biden/Harris, but nothing in me is excited about them. And Trump is never my standard.
He couldn't avoid the recession so let's  proud of what Obama/Biden did from 09-17 and remind Folks how he fucked it all up.
I cannot wait till Joe Biden's forced to have a debate with President Trump. That's going to be the end of his campaign guaranteed. He's going to have a meltdown auntie live TV and stumble over his words. This is why they're hiding him.
These two clowns are the, say anything puppets. Put antifa. Com in your Google search just three days ago and it comes up Joe Biden. We're not stupid old man you're going to lose.Pelosi won't pass the stimulus because she wants 3.5 billion for voter fraud for you morons. NOPEüñï
NBA says photographer who posted offensive Kamala Harris meme is no longer in bubble

He‚Äôs doing what he‚Äôs supposed to do based on how his state voted. Also, this is how Bernie supporters get to tell the party to keep evolving the platform. Democracy works when our voices are heard. He still needs to earn our votes.
Just imagining the Biden/Harris administration with a Democrat controlled House and Senate and all the things they won‚Äôt get done for 2 years til they lose both chambers again
Vote for Biden! This Country depends on you! BTW WELCOME‚ù§Ô∏è
are you aware Krystal Ball Rising on fb has become a vote blue no matter what - Biden site?
So because I'm a Christian that makes me an automatic Trump supporter?    Now, what if I supported Biden? Would that make me a supporter of a pedophile? I'm trying to understand your logic here.   By the way. I'm not Catholic. That priest thing is irrelevant to me.
Biden's team will make Harris better than what she is imo.
Hush money, that's interesting, apparently you haven't looked into the Ukraine curruption for Biden. Fear not Trump will remind you
No I am voting for Biden no matter what. I dont peddle in conspiracy theories. And thats all you have.
Question is why aren't they following Biden?
Biden and his crew dissing Hillary after she lost was a clue to how he felt.
A vote for Biden isn‚Äôt just a vote for him. It‚Äôs a vote for the rest of the administration and ppl who hold high rank in varies offices. We CANNOT afford to have another four years of folks who are on the far right in those seats. Remember, it‚Äôs more then Biden.
In the end it's on Joe Biden to beat Donald Trump.   He was nominated to win back Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania at the minimum.... that means white voters.  Harris is an insurance policy with Brown voters. If she can boost black and Asian voter intensity, great.
Thank you president Biden
The federal mask mandate suggested in Biden‚Äôs BS is just another symptom of his blatantly apparent dementia. His handlers really got this wrong. #MAGA2020
Checked my wife's registration and she was ok. So neither one of us voted since we cancelled we others vote. The idea is to trim the vote so Biden does not gain a vote.
Biden is a southern dem.... and folks underestimated him... I'll be the first to admit I did.  Locking SC down defending the ACA is why he's nominee.   Black older voters liked the loyalty to Obama.
They don't have that power. You're giving them too much credit. Their main play this week is Birtherism against a woman from Oakland when they had better things to hit Biden/Harris with.
I think that Biden is a flawed candidate but that Trump is an amoral, sociopathic narcissist whose Administration is anti-life and white supremacist, if not in explicit creed then in implemented policies.
had to admit, the Liberals owners of   dictates what they talk about.  And  is feeding suggestions to Harf to bolster Joe Biden  mask mandate. Weird, she told Trump he couldn't mandate states to do anything. What changed Dana?
Stephen Colbert compares political ideology of Biden, Harris to 'Rockefeller Republicans'    Colbert you don‚Äôt know üí© from shinola!
If it wasn't for Floyd I think Klobuchar is VP.   Look she knew what the climate was took her self out and Took A clipboard to Warren's VP chances as well.  JOE BIDEN OWES HER... For all we  know Amy and  kamala talks. Not everything has to be public.
Biden Harris 2020: very sad to have to vote for you
Me: (composing epic Biden meme)  Freaking wife: Dammit, all you do is post all day!  Me: What? I just finished taking away the kids‚Äô devices.  6 yo based gamer daughter: Mommy, you should be nicer to daddy. He works hard on Twitter all day.   Me: Here Eloise, take some Robux
I hope that when Biden/Harris walk into the White House Kamala kicks that front door open!!!
Here‚Äôs hoping Biden/Harris can execute this plan
Nah I‚Äôm not I got 25 on the ACT . That‚Äôs the sad part . I‚Äôm not smarter than many who simply refuse to see how this system works . Again if you think Biden will win put money on it
Thinking about how cool it would be if hunter Biden replaced Joe Biden and Kamalas dad replaced kamala
As a Black American I‚Äôve watched  do more for the Black community than Obama &amp; Biden (who did nothing)!  - School Choice   - Opportunity Zones   - First Step Act (criminal justice reform)   - Economic Opportunity &amp; Growth   - HBCU Funding (permanent)
PSA: I understand once again that Biden/Harris AREN‚ÄôT the dream team we need- but now isn‚Äôt the time to create viral tweets pointing those flaws out. Same reason as why third party voting this November is a vote for 45. We need to encourage all voters to elect Biden y‚Äôall.
Don't worry everyone I heard Joe Biden is the most electible Democrat so we should be fine
when I hear joe biden speak
Anyway, you can lampoon Biden all you want (and God knows I have and will continue to!), but the notion that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are somehow more politically skilled than him is not the slam-dunk case their doofus aides might think it is.
whites *who were really never in any danger of ever receiving a college degree*: trump: 64%, Biden 34% - Fixed it.
It use to be. Biden-Harris want to take away your freedoms
On the other hand, the Obama and Clinton teams‚Äô dismissiveness of Biden‚Äôs natural political skills is fairly typical of how dumb, insular and naval-gazing a lot of these people are.
It‚Äôs extremely easy in hindsight to criticize Obamaworld for hitching their wagon to Clinton instead of his own VP in 2016. But it wasn‚Äôt obvious at the time how serious Biden was about running, and she seemed like a natural successor.
üòÆHow Trump could lose the popular vote by 5M and still win
‚Äúexcuse me sir i need to hold you accountable for your problematic actions‚Äù i scream as Joe Biden‚Äôs jackbooted thugs toss me into an unmarked minivan for the Crime of having a bag of oregano on my person after leaving whole foods market
Idk what ur talking about cuz we‚Äôve always been allowed to........in fact she actively (!!) encourages it.................like ppl collectively dragged her when she said she‚Äôll be voting for Biden months ago
Just not pretending that my concerns aren't just him not being my "first choice" I feel like too many people love to gaslight the "Bernie bros"  It's annoying. Trump is the one we should blame. Not the people who actively work against him AND Biden
And sure maybe we'll all reluctantly vote for him when the time comes, but the problem is, it's not a matter of not being my first choice-- it's a matter of I, and others, are legitimately terrified of Biden as well. So I'm fine with people giving me reasons to vote for him,
HERE Comes The Bullshit. #FridayThoughts
What bothers me is people minimizing my concerns with Biden. I 1000% agree it's probably worth it, because yeah Trump is THAT dangerous. But I just feel like no one's listening to my concerns about how legitimately scared a lot of us are if Biden as well
For these very reasons (these issues being ignored) I'm also voting -against- Trump, but I can't bring myself to vote -for- Biden either.
I would never expose you üíñ And youre completely right. Your points are all valid. I don't mind people convincing me to vote for Biden. When it comes down to it I might do that. I agree with all your points
Forgive me if I'm not all excited about Kamala Harris being named as Biden's pick for VP. She's still a politician and how many politicians have you known that were genuinely for the people?
‚ÄúShe was mean to me and not nice like all women should be, and also she probably wasn‚Äôt born in the US cuz I‚Äôm racist and a baby and I can‚Äôt stand losing‚Äù ‚Äî Pres. Tr*mp on Kamala as Biden‚Äôs VP
It is privileged AF to not be planning to vote for Biden and Harris.
. . .and I always suspected Biden was a dick - but I'm not including a picture. . . .
YOU ALREADY COLLAPSED OUR COUNTRY TRUMP! BIDEN IS GOING TO FIX YOUR MESS. YOU ARE THE WORST POTUS EVER!
Hmm funny when Joe Biden mispronounces it though isnt it?
Biden/Harris 2020 "Our secret police will wear badges and maybe not misgender you".
That should be too hard to do since million have lost the only income they had and do not have any money to buy anything. We are faced with the most grievous condition as we sit on the cliff over a long fall and there is one way off of it, vote Biden/Harris on Nov3.
It's gonna be a while. Even if Joe Biden wins, the crazy runs deep here.
Not voting for you  because your not doing your job. So get out of my office #YourFired  via
I don‚Äôt protect someone because of the level of melanin in their skin.   You need to have values. Morals. Convictions.   Don‚Äôt sellout the moment you‚Äôre offered a seat of power.

Joe Biden wants to increase police funding. He is NOT advocating for police reform.   How is better again?
I wonder why   &amp; the other race-baiting grifters don‚Äôt call #Biden out on it.   Yet, President  the guy y‚Äôall irrationally hate, has championed the First Step Act undoing much of this inqeuality.   So tell me who‚Äôs the true ‚Äúracist‚Äù?!
In Biden‚Äôs 1994 Crime Bill he literally prohibited grants &amp; funding to anyone who is held in prison. This disproportionately hurt Black Americans.  So you want to talk about inequality?  is responsible for much of it.   Instead of promising to reform such he defends it.
Vote Biden Harris because literally we are living in an absolutely failed state right now.
Next person who says  "Joe Biden wasn't my first choice either, but--" is getting put in my next expose video
Biden is a can of Shasta
As born overseas while of if US State department parents  this paragraph makes me ill "Tammy Duckworth¬†of Illinois powerfully impressed Mr. Biden‚Äôs search team, but his lawyers feared she would face challenges to her eligibility because of the circumstances of her birth overseas
The idiot ass president is trying to illegally defund the United States Post Office because he doesn‚Äôt want Americans to mail-in vote (during a pandemic we are still in) and people are actually sitting up here saying they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feel like‚Äù voting for Biden/Harris.
It will be spun that Biden isn‚Äôt Alpha Male enough to get pissed on by hookers.
I want sitcom Prez Biden &amp; Veep Beto, it would be so zany. Beto would bring his rock &amp; roll friends and borrow Jill‚Äôs dress and Biden would shimmy to Mars Volta good times would be had by all
Foreign relations are going to be so important and yet Biden is going to need to focus on Covid and the economy so he will need the absolute best at the UN
Gaza strip was getting bombed, Biden didn't say shit That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either I'ma part of the problem, my problem is I'm peaceful And I believe in the people
The debate on Kamala‚Äôs blackness, Biden‚Äôs age, their prison and crime backgrounds.. these are worthless discussions in August. What‚Äôs the point of making sure people dislike or like the candidates that are the only viable options? Just vote.
I believe in Heaven and in Hell.  This will be Biden‚Äôs eternity.  Confused and forever thinking he‚Äôs President.  And never being able to sniff hair or be touchy feely.
Are we seriously doing this bullsh*t AGAIN?
One Biden for Jill, one Biden for the campaign trail and one Biden to putter the Vette around the Dover Intdenational Speedway
absolutely not following your logic here.  What happens in 2024? I dunno, you try to elect AOC or someone? Biden won‚Äôt run again. guarantee you‚Äôll do better with that without four years of GOP voting-rights murder.

this is cool but how about when Joe Biden said that there‚Äôs no diversity in the Black community last week
Kanya, you are being used to take away black votes from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Do you not see that? If you're the genius you say you want to be, you would recognize that. Write music and stay in your lane that you own.
that‚Äôs my point. the ad is made by them for trump and yet the symbolism supports their opposition and makes Biden look better when clearly they want trump to look stronger here
What these folks don't realize is that the focus right now needs to be on excising the tumor. Refusing to vote for Biden won't do anything but hand #45 another 4 years.
Unlike  Biden cares about you and everyone else. #BidenHarris2020
. agreed to be VP for a man she called a BIGOT just a few months ago!  - Biden endorsed the Crime Bill  - Kamala Harris Enforced it - Trump Championed the #FirstStepAct  Actions speak louder than words! Do your research!  &amp; they call us Black conservatives SELLOUTS?
Kamala, you are a hammerhead shark. Intelligent, adept and you come in packs. I'm so proud and waiting for your new ideas for this America. Biden/Harris 2020! You go girl
half my tweets get fifty quote tweets that all say ‚Äúwell what do you suppose we do instead?‚Äù and if that‚Äôs really your only line of rhetoric when someone questions Biden or Harris then it‚Äôs no wonder liberals are so nervous right now
my guy said racists are going to lose as if Joe Biden wasn‚Äôt a whole ass segregationist. whew.
Trump doesn‚Äôt want to test because then people will have coronavirus; he doesn‚Äôt want to fund the post office because then people will vote for Joe Biden. He is a spoiled child, not a president, and he is destroying our country. ü§¨
Agreed.
The Biden campaign, Democrats and all Americans should raising hell over this. Trump is admitting he wants to rig this election.
Biden wants a national mask mandate? Looks like I'll be breaking federal laws in November.
He‚Äôs definitely going to jail. President Biden will make sure of it
Not sure what the plan is when they run a handsome guy against Biden in 4 years and he gets smoked
Biden just asked for everyone to wear a face mask. Wentso  far as asked all governors to mandate there use. Said it will save 40 000 lives.   As a side note if you do wear  a mask until the vaccine arrives you automatic know you can wait to see if it is real.
Biden already got Illinois on lock . I‚Äôm just getting my popcorn, drone camera and body vest ready . in 2016 said you would focus on electoral college and money as speech . 0 progress on either instead media had people focused on Russia üòÇ Bernie endorsed Biden. Trump won
Kamala and Biden need to trade places.

Biden is better than four years of a fascist death cult.
My one single white ‚Äúlibertarian‚Äù friend aka coworker respects Kamala. I believe he‚Äôs voting Biden for sure at this point.
Told you Biden was Marxist
Literally this. Also, the election is in 2.5 months. Are all these ‚Äúfighters‚Äù going to stage a coup in that time or just be angry from their keyboards. Real activists and organizers understand all of this which is why they‚Äôre holding their noses to vote for Biden
You've convinced yourself that you're doing such a GREAT and TREMENDOUS job! Those are two of your only vocabulary words right? You have single-handledly torn the U.S. to shreds and you think Biden-Harris will do worse than you? Spoken like a true narcissist.
I checked it yesterday and I couldn't believe it when I write the Joe Biden's campaign. I even posted it on his Twitter and ask what the hell is this old man. Now it says it's unavailable you got to be kidding me right boy they think we're stupid don't they.
George Soros, Obama wife, Hillary and Bill, Joe Biden all of them go to prison for conspiracy and spying obamagate it's real I can't wait till they go to prison. That'll be the best thing in the world when you see idiots like that go to prison forever.

13 million BLACK people opposed  1994 crime bill.  Why? Because it disproportionately HURT the Black community.  In context, 16 Million Black people voted in the 2016 election.  Let‚Äôs see how turnout goes!  Only those who are ignorant to the facts will vote for Biden.
You know ain't nobody big or important. at least I am to myself but Twitter blocks me because I'm responding on Joe Biden's page or Kamala Harris's page it's amazing that they can block you for 12 hours. Like that's going to make a difference or change my view üñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñï
Nov we will have and continue to have a real man in the White House president Trump. He's the only one that can help America. 50 years of guys like Joe Biden just talking and mumbling get nothing done. And now I'm left satanic socialist is going to help.
I'll do do a virus started by China which is in the pockets with Joe Biden. You must be mentally Disturbed or just delusional to think that this old metal case man in this left-wing socialist is going to do anything good for America. Where do you come up with this satanic banter.

Just think of the next 20 years that can be as these progressive, pro-human players fall into place. AOC will have her place (she is already huge). Warren will have a place in his administration. She‚Äôs crucial. Biden is not forever, but he sees potential in incredible people.
Don‚Äôt pick apart Biden and Harris. Vote for them and talk trash later.     Another 4 years of the Dump Administration could literally end the world.
I can't stand Trump, I can't stand Biden, I can't stand Harris.  Obama was horrible, so was Bush, Clinton, other Bush, Reagan,  Carter and Ford,  and that's all of em in my lifetime.  You realize that 60% of eligible voters don't vote, right?  Why do you think that is?

I live in the suburbs and am a mom, a wife and a nurse. I will absolutely support in every way I can and ultimately vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
This statement should be a Biden-Harris ad all by itself.
I also think Candace Owens is a piece of shit, does that make me a racist/sexist?  What if Trump dumps Pence and puts Diamond or Silk on the ticket?  Who am I supposed to vote for then?  I don't owe you, Biden or Harris a damn thing.
Of course they will run another Wall Steet Big Tech crony show, Biden &amp; Harris will not suddenly have different backers in Nov than they do, now, or become different people. And if we all believe they still "must win" &amp; give them unconditional support, we can't move them. (1)

The same way they got in this time, so of course they are going to do it again! They'll be 3/3, Gore, Clinton &amp; Biden if we are weak enough to fall for the Okey-Doke yet again!
Umm Biden/Harris would toss minorities in jail for years for non violent offenses
Pretty cool that if Biden loses we can blame toxic KHive Twitter users and if he wins we can prove toxic Twitter supporters aren't a real detriment
Neither Biden nor Harris have ever said that. You have nothing to contribute to a meaningful debate. Crawl back to your hole and prepare yourself for decades in the political wilderness.
100% with you there, I knocked enough ‚Äúliberal‚Äù doors for Bernie to know how your average working class voter felt about Obama and Biden once the platitudes wore off. Spoiler: they felt abandoned.

Those kids will be held in those facilities Trump or no Trump. I think it should be looked at in terms of changing how children and families from a foreign country are held, but it certainly isn't going to change under Biden.
Is Barr the new Comey? Trump seems to like reruns. We can conclude Barr is going to do the same shit Comey did to HRC. Would not surprise me if it was done to Harris in late September. Biden in middle to late October. Forewarned is forearmed. Street fighting ain't fair.
Whos this Biden guy you speak of
Can I suggest to my wish list that when Biden is president that Adam Schaffer‚Äôs is made Attorney General.
Another asinine tweet from a moron.  We have the worst president of my lifetime and arguably of our nation‚Äôs history  seated right now.  A Biden Harris administration will bring down our republic?  Please
I am voting for Biden/Harris in 2020 for obvious reasons. Trump has committed impeachable offenses, including dereliction of duty during a pandemic. In my heart, I know that Biden/Harris will restore and unite America, and undo all of Trump's heinous actions! #BidenHarris2020
My life does depend on it. That‚Äôs why I am voting BIDEN and hope Trump spends next 4 years in jail or courtrooms.
Agreed. I guess I‚Äôm just surprised because with a lot of mail in ballots coming in soon... this very much affects Biden. Especially if ‚Äúblue‚Äù areas are targeted by this nonsense.
80 percent of dems and a majority of Republicans support ending cannabis prohibition.  If biden cant even get on board with this common sense policy,  well hes obviously corrupt and only interested in his big money donors.
Biden should update his policies to reflect what his voters want then shouldn't he? After all politicians are supposed to be public servants.
What does this have to do with Biden ducking interviews and questions? Why Does the left always want to change the subject and not answer questions?
PSA calls it as they see it.  I'm a huge fan.  Biden clearly takes nothing political said about him personally.  So my response is a huge "So What?"
Some Republicans. That doesnt tell us anything. Biden is more popular with some Republicans.
These WH Press conferences always end up being China‚Äôs fault, everyday with Trump. Joe Biden‚Äôs right, Whiny!

This is what Biden/Harris want!!!!
Wow a huuuuuuuggggggee crowd must be employees of Biden and Harris
LIAR! Actually, more jobs are lost in 2020 than Obama and Biden created in the last 8 years. The unemployment rate in the US is  now at 10.2%.  When Obama left office, it was at 4.7%.
She is the real nominee. Not Biden
I can get over with a gradual improvement to our healthcare system. Partially because I am a realist and no fucking way that single payer will happen in the next decade and not because of Biden, because of US citizens and because of SCOTUS.
Of course she was, cause Biden is racist.
I just saw a tweet that said that Biden is like prince zuko and Kamala is like katara first of all, watch ya mouth
Even FDR needed to be forced left. Thing is voters actually did it. They didn't vote him in then check out. In 2010 and 2014 voters said we voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 so we can take the election off. U want progressive change u vote Biden and progressives and in 2023
Of course it‚Äôs Biden/Harris.

There might be reasons that Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate Trump, but your analogies make no sense. Joe McCarthy and Robert Welch didn‚Äôt run for President....also I‚Äôm pretty sure the first Presidential debate was Kennedy/Nixon. The next was Ford/Carter in 1976

Joe Biden's dementia isn't the path any country should take, his mental capacity, short-term memory issue and his global cognitive awareness is-rapidly deteriorating, it's sad yet clear

Kamala Harris, Biden's V.P. Pick, Is First Woman of Color on Major Party Ticket
They would only be satisfied with Biden/Sanders. Wait let me correct. Sanders/Biden.  It isnt about progress it is a cult of personality.  I voted for Bernie in 2016, but not a member of the cult.

Polar opposite personalities on that front. Pence provides the older/calmer demeanor while Harris will be far more vocal. I think this pick is awful on multiple fronts but how Biden thought it was a good choice is beyond me. It is free ads for trump
Biden actually chose a VP candidate who accused him of being a racist just a year ago on the democrat nominee debates. Our country is so f*cked lmao
Wait Biden picked her?
Yeah with or without Biden a rock is better than Trump

Sorry Biden is not gonna win ladies and gents #KanyeConJob
Oh guaranteed, not to mention he‚Äôs inheriting the worst clusterf**k ever. It‚Äôs going to be a huge undertaking. I know Biden is capable and up to the job, but he will be blamed for the morons inaction.
Who‚Äôs this Joe Biden you speak of
I honestly believe when Biden gives his acceptance speech he should walk down ramp holding a massive water bottle. Then take a sip out of it before he starts speaking.
I can't wait until Biden list Trump's top 10 atrocities with the caption.. 'It Is What It Is'
President is only the leader in lies, crimes, golf, days vacation per year and fast food.   Amazing he gets 40% in polls and got elected with those qualifications.   Vote Biden.
The fact you think Biden will return normalcy is frightening.  Anyway I am trying to help mama jo debate, I don‚Äôt have to debate for her. So I‚Äôm only going to respond with memes from now on and of course #LetHerSpeak

Your kidding, right? Biden hasn‚Äôt had anybody ‚Äùrecovery‚Äù because he hasn‚Äôt been president! And, as others have pointed out, these are just people returning to jobs they already had. And let‚Äôs not forget the 1.2 million new unemployment claims over the last week. Bunch of idiots
Biden won't even commit to correcting cannabis prohibition which has ruined hundreds of thousand of lives and has 80% support from his party.  Simply not being trump isn't good enough.98% of Biden voters simply want to save what's left of our democracy.

Hell yes!!!!
Clearly Biden knows that too... last speaker is Highest Honor! We must make sure it's covered! #MediaCoverYangSpeech
For everyone that was upset at Yang not being on the schedule, I raise a different scenario. Many democrats would do anything to be the last speaker. My guess there was a lot of in fighting going on to be that speaker. Yang was not even trying to be. That points to Joe Biden.
This is the highest honor. There's no way this happens without Joe Biden wanting it so. It is important that we in the Yang gang start applying pressure now to all the media outlets, They dare not cut away to a pundit  Or commercial while he speaks!!!
Heidi you have a lot of followers in the Yang gang... It is imperative that we start applying pressure now that the media not cut Yang off with commercials or puandits before Biden speaks.
I am not surprised. Do you remember how Andrew blew the doors off at those state convention speeches? Remember Biden was in the audience waiting his turn.
I am having a recurring dream that I wake up and we have a lifeless puppet for president and then I see Biden is really running for president and I scream but no one can hear me.
The middle wouldn‚Äôt vote left. Biden will keep the house and get the White House. Depending on how badly Trump derails, senate may be in play. Policies aside, people are tired of the train crash episode. It was interesting for a bit, but covid and incompetency was the nail.
I know all of you are a little partisan, this you substantially underestimate the 2-6% in all of those states that voted trump before knowing he was a conman. They‚Äôve given up. It‚Äôs over. He can‚Äôt get them back. And Biden will win. A lot of noise until then.
Biden is the ultimate teacher of political plagiarism.
Andrew Yang now has the BEST speaker slot of all... the LAST speaker before the Candidates!  Surely Biden had some role in this...  Bodes well for the Cabinet Appointment, No?  AWESOME.
HOLY CRAP! He went from forgotten to the FINAL SPEAKER BEFORE THE CANDIDATES! No Higher Honor! Folks... I gotta think Biden had some say in this! Awesome!
Amazing that they can be so tight-fisted about anything that doesn‚Äôt enrich themselves personally.  We can expect a never ending cry about the national debt when President Biden is sworn in.
I honestly believe America owes Hillary an apology. The sexism in this country is so deep until we don't even realize we're being sexist.  From a political view, if Hillary was man, she would look like Biden. Same generation, same ethnicity, same politics, same experience, etc..
And Biden is not even saying no.
I warn progress and trump ain‚Äôt it. And Biden you actually have a say.
Assuming you're talking about Astead's piece, havent read it yet. We're on a path to serious conflict. Idk if Biden fully realized the optics of declaring himself a bridge to the future, then tabbing someone who's clear about wanting to inherit. Left needs a media strategy badly.
#jeninepiro if you have knowledge of Biden being in danger that has to be reported. Or threats you are making.
Last year you said you believed Joe Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúinappropriate touching‚Äù accusers and called him everything but a racist in the primaries.
Trump answers all questions answerable.Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt take one softball question because it wouldn‚Äôt make sense. He was given the questions ahead of time at one of his great outdoor adventures from the basement and ended telling us on camera what he was told ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
By R/T'ng Biden advisers?  That is all you have?  Get back to me when Vecchio has a speaking slot at a Biden rally or something like that.

If not, Guaido should lobby Biden.  Moreover, Maduro has refused to negotiate since April/ May because he thinks Biden will win and he'll bless his fake elections with the mesita.  It unlocks the game for Biden to pour cold water on this.
I don't care about Martinez.  I want Guaido to lobby Biden to be on Guaido (and therefore Venezuela's side.)  There is a significant chance that Biden wins.  Do you want Guaido to be thrown under the bus and for Fal$on to be sitting in the Oval Office next year?
And it is very important for people like Vecchio and Guaido to have a seat in Biden's inner circle so that Martinez doesn't promote fake elections.

The difference is Trump is the  " president " and it is his job Biden is just a candidate and probable next president and has no obligation yet
If Biden wins, things go back to the way they were.  #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica #Trump2020 #trump #chinafreeworld

Virginia Mayor Refuses To Resign After Saying Biden Chose ‚ÄòAunt Jemima‚Äô For VP
Biden doesn‚Äôt take questions. Does Biden disavow ANTIFA? Does any democrat?  Idiots
And?  Guaido has asked Naim for advice.  Martinez is concerning but if you want a Biden administration to support Guaido instead of the mesita, then you better make sure Martinez feels pressure to remain on Guaido's side.
Yes.  I do.  I don't see them openly campaigning for Biden.  Ravell only really has opinions on Venezuelan politics as does Castillo.  And Carla Angola has good contacts in the Trump administration.
When will Mag Men get Joe to take questions?  It's just so bizarre, that MSM can't ask Joe any questions, without pre approval and scripted answers?  You lice, are not fooling anybody with your kid glove handling of the Biden fossil.
Biden shouldn't listen to a word Ben Rhodes says...  He's an idiot.
The Obama people are jerks and didn't believe in Biden in 2020.  Obama was rooting for Sanders.
Been nightmares every night since Trump got elected. Our cities are burning and people are dying from a pandemic that he mishandled. I‚Äôll take my chances on Biden rather than certain disaster with Trump.
The campaign begins (again)  via
Biden is 3 years older than Donald. Where do Donald, and his minions, get off accusing Biden of being too old?  The SKelly cartoon is despicable, and I demand the Tribune own up to that now!
Yes, but then back to the UFO's after Biden victory!
Wondering why Biden didn't do whay you claim in the 8 yrs in the Whitehouse or 30 yrs in Congress. Kamala ,you called Joe a racist during Debates.Were we to believe you then or now? You will truely come to know the power of God our Creator. And Great will be your fall
I blocked her and Joe Biden so their tweets don't show up on my timeline.
The 30-something liberal snowflakes whining about this could go to the polls and vote in person.  Exposure to a disease that likely won't kill you for a few minutes to vote early in an election and make sure Biden wins big on election night isn't the end of the world.

If the "day of" vote count is a landslide for Biden, it should be game over.
You were front &amp; center for Kavanaugh hanging. Used your celebrity, to get into the Capital.  You cheered on a unfounded, evidence free, hanging. Joe Biden accuser is dismissed?  If it were not for double standards, you wouldn't have any!
Hey, Molly... Biden wasn't my first choice, but he's certainly not "the lesser of two evils" !!
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He‚Äôs the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes
What happens if Biden wins?  Guaido might not be able to get lobbying and diplomatic pressure from a Biden administration if he campaigns for Trump.  Not to mention that Guaido needs Biden right now to unlock the game by throwing cold water on the fake elections.
You don't like the choice between trump and Biden?  Then how about choosing a decent person  Novel idea, I know, but boy do I miss decent.  So does the entire world.
If you want to be able to cast another ballot in 2024, vote for Biden.
‚ù§Ô∏èYour Picture w/ Kamala‚ÄºÔ∏è I‚Äôm Team Biden &amp; Harris‚ÄºÔ∏è
Everyone who can't see a difference between Trump and Biden should just keep talking to each other on Twitter. Absolute buffoons.
"two point shift"? that's usually within the margin of error, and IMO doesn't justify an explanation. What's more interesting is the sheer size of the Trump-Biden gap, though we're still ~3 months out
The issue is the opposition descending into backbiting like they always do and the international community growing bored.  I haven't heard a lot from Biden's team or his campaign surrogates about Venezuela strategy, which concerns me that he might be open to fake elections.
Yes absolutely. AND after Biden wins we should accept nothing less than a full prosecution of Trump &amp; his cabinet. Do not fall asleep!
There is a difference. Voting for Trump in 2016 caused this entire mess we‚Äôre in. Appreciate the Biden vote now
As long as Mitch is feeling good about things, the rest of the county does not matter.  However, great campaign fodder for Biden, McConnell sends the Senate home for vacation during this mess.  --&gt; Dereliction of duty by the GOP, again.
The Pod Bros are tools and I would totally promise to vote for Biden if he disses Ben Rhodes and the rest of them.
I can‚Äôt wait for Biden to go on Cumtown next month.
Ralph Nader didn't put W in the White House. Kerry had a busted story - war hero/anti-war veteran/war hero to fight terror. So he got Swiftboated because when your story's broke your enemy defines you. Thank God Biden's got a tight narrative - decent man in time of indecency.
That is literally what Biden said.  Outside means outside.  Also, what does "alone" constitute in your mind?  If I am walking on a sidewalk in a shopping area should I wear a mask?
Jogging with a mask on or walking a dog outside with a mask on is exactly what Biden just said...  That is what wearing a mask outside means.  And that is ridiculous.
I don't like Biden all that much either but right now in America the only choices are bad or worse. In the end, when no other choice is presented, I will always take the lesser of the bad.
This is about the debates. Notice that he says 3 months. When the debates begin (September) Biden will say that Trump is responsible for 10,000 deaths because he ignored Biden‚Äôs mask advice in August. In October he‚Äôll say 20,000. This is all debate positioning.
yeah, I think I'm hearing you say biden gives us some breathing room... which I'm definitely sympathetic to
Hi.  I'm religious.  I'm OK with Biden-Harris.  Who were you talking about exactly?  Oh, I'm a liberal Jew.  You didn't mean me, right?  Because leftists who self-identify as religious don't count?
ok, I was confused before. now I know *why* I'm not voting for biden.
Misogyny and a 25 year campaign against HRC was a big player last time. They saw two equally awful evils. Hoping there is more clarity and less misogyny (Biden‚Äôs a dude) this time.
Plus, it‚Äôs all just so....tawdry and sad.  Who needs to even know this anymore?  Let‚Äôs just elect Biden, chalk it up to experience, and move the F on.
Correction: Our country IS collapsing now. We must elect Joe Biden.
If you disagree with someone, fine. But I am irritated with this trope about anyone who is not wild about Biden is a Russian agent. That's so dopey 50's-McCarthyite. Come on.
At this point both are correct.  Very difficult to understand Biden, just jiberish.

I used to be critical of Kamala Harris. Now I am going to defend her at every turn
Hey, is it clear yet that if you don't vote for Biden, there's a good chance you won't ever have a chance to vote again?
They weren't going to vote for Biden under any circumstances. This is just a convenient cop out.
Well, you come out of the gate lying!! Donald Trump has done more for this country in his 3.5 years than the 3 previous Presidents combined. You are a fool's fool who knows nothing, ZIP, about how an economy runs and Biden knows less than you! Shameful!
The messaging I am seeing from the Trump campaign is stunningly bad/unprofessional. Trying to paint Biden-Harris as wild-eyed radicals?? That dog won‚Äôt hunt.
This is a Republican pollster and a 4 point improvement for Biden from June with them.
Of course DOJ should but Biden shouldn't go anywhere near that decision.
Biden shouldn't be anywhere near that decision.
So USA üá∫üá∏ should elect Biden,To solve your issues?
I only know that YOU, trump, have done nothing for anyone but yourself and your rich friends, so don't tell me what Biden is going to do. He is a decent man. Can you say that about yourself?
Next week  is speaking at the  Read his message about why  was the right person to join  on the ticket.
Silly man Biden did not pronounce her name correctly
There you go again commenting about meaningless drivel rather than about Biden selecting Harris and their socialist agenda for America. Unbelievable!
Is this supposed to be consistent with the Fox commentator predicting that Biden won't be on the ticket come November?
The fact that y‚Äôall really think you can pull the race card on Biden/Harris like Trump/Pence isn‚Äôt overtly racist is dumbfounding
Yeah, it's not. And believe me, I am not a big Biden fan. But I'm like understand you will not be able to achieve any reform under a second Trump term. Understand healthcare and abortion is on the chopping block. Criminal justice? He'll throw us all in jail.
Biden couldn't build a Lego tower in his current state. gtfo
This attack would be borderline cute but for the fact that Trump has stonewalled funding to modernize the northeast corridor‚Äòs transportation infrastructure ‚Äî one of the few areas of broad bipartisan concern ‚Äî and Biden is likely going to win 99% of the Amtrak employee vote.
I mean everybody starts somewhere but I think it's true that Americans in general don't prefer career politicians. Compare to Biden who was a Senator for 36 years or Hillary who had been around for decades before running.

This ticket! ü•∞ #BidenHarris
I‚Äôm gonna be real honest with you here, ain‚Äôt shit gonna change when Biden and Harris win. They have no incentive to answer to us, the people. They only answer to their rich ass donors and themselves.
Sorry, no one was watching!! There was more interesting news on MSNBC! BIDEN/HARRIS!!!
Yeah, I kind of agree.  Or just have one so the Repubs can‚Äôt accuse Biden of being scared of debating.
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
Ambassador Neumann, these are all good things but I think that more is needed from Biden.  Will you agree with me that Biden should declare against the fake parliamentary elections in December and also repudiate the "mesita"?
Venezuelans would have a lot more power if they demanded things from Biden as well as Trump...  Like demanded that Biden declares against the fake parliamentary elections.
That is why she was selected. Not because she is simpatico to Biden
She was not my first choice, but I now see my error.  She is the right choice.   One clue to her value to Biden is that the Trump campaign team's responses were confused and contradictory.   They have no effective counter message to Kamala, and she takes media time from Trump.
People do realize that Kanye West joined BLM in June and donated $2 million. Since then, he announced he is running to pull votes away from Biden to help Trump. It's not a far leap to think he is using his new BLM $$ influence to trigger new unrest which also helps Trump.
Yep. I‚Äôm eligible in October. And voting for Biden/Harris the next month.
Worthwhile reflection on the type of man  is: a Mensch [Verified by  as authentic, FYI] I Know Joe Biden: Rabbi Michael Beals

The eighth region in my Wisconsin breakdown series is Southwest Wisconsin. This was another frustrating region for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and one where Joe Biden will need to improve in 2020 if he's to win the state of Wisconsin. 1/4
Doesn't matter who Biden picked. Trump will win in a landslide.
Joe Biden thinks you can throw Kamala  out there
But Joe Biden thinks you can throw a Democrat out there
Someone else came up with it, but I like it. The condition for Biden to debate Trump is that Trump has to release his tax returns to the public.
5 Things to Know About Biden‚Äôs VP Pick, Kamala Harris ‚Äì Her Skeletons Have Skeletons
The GOP will become very concerned about this when Joe Biden is inaugurated.
Vote for Biden. Trump will continue to do nothing while Americans die. America will eventually become a developing country- we are already headed there.
‚Äúunder control‚Äù man u guys really dont want any of us voting biden lol
It will also feel good when you are sworn in as part of the Biden administration.
As usual, think how the GOP would react if Biden (or any other Dem) stood up a fake campaign for a GOP candidate!  They would raise holy hell and impeach everyone. But it's okay for Jared to run this stupid operation, which he'll botch anyway.
Oh yes! Let‚Äôs see, I volunteer Fauci, Gates, Cuomo, Lightfoot, Pelosi, Newsome, Harris, Biden, Clinton family, Soros family, Rockefeller family, Rothschilds family and the rest of the zionists they work for, &amp; whoever actors aren‚Äôt killed off. criminals.

Pennsylvania is Biden. Not going red. The conman has caught up to Trump there with enough people.
I guess the lesson is that Biden is not a narcissistic psychopath like Trump. He doesn't believe he has all of the answers to every question.
Sen. Kamala Harris wasn't on my radar somehow for this election, but having looked into things now, I feel a lot better voting for her than for Biden, and her history as a lawyer bodes well for,  y'know... not committing crimes in office. #BidenHarris2020
Both Kamala &amp; Biden have a history of signing bills that only serve to continue to imprison, separate &amp; oppress us. Niggas haven‚Äôt had a chance to vote for someone decent since I turned 18 so far be it from me to be the one to tell anyone where there loyalties should lie
I love this! ‚ù§üá∫üá≤  Watch "Joe Biden releases first ad with Kamala Harris as his running mate" on YouTube
Burn all this shit to the ground   Idk g, but it‚Äôs definitely not as simple as ‚Äúa vote against Biden is a vote for trump‚Äù or any of the other colloquialisms used lately.
Stop telling black people that voting for Biden/Kamala is the MORAL choice, those who harm our communities will continue to keep doing so in positions of power
I agree with this but also struggle. Many of Trump and Biden's policies are both life and death where a Green party candidate has actual plans to fix. This is a shit time for everyone
Kamala is a cop. Race and gender do not matter. Let's stop acting like the Biden/Harris ticket is exciting UNTIL they support M4A and Defunding the police
With apologies to The Wire and to Omar, ‚ÄúBiden don‚Äôt scare.‚Äù   Biden is a mature, confident person, comfortable in his own skin. It‚Äôs never been about Biden, it‚Äôs always about people and the country.   Not saying he‚Äôs perfect. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just need good. Or better.
Although born &amp; raised in the city, I am now a "suburban white woman." I can't wait to, not only vote against *45 but throw my entire support behind "Biden/Harris 2020"
How long til after Biden gets elected he resigns due to some medical condition? Place your bets now :P
Though a better strategy would be for Biden to show up out of respect, but send a flood of messaging beforehand calling out Trump for his delusions, disrespect, demagoguery, and cognitive decline, then let him prove Biden right on the debate stage. Joe won‚Äôt even have to talk.
Translation: The privileged racist white stay at home mom will be voting for me. They want their neighborhoods to stay exclusively white and keep minorities out. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Cory Booker in charge!
Agree. How can Biden ask or expect Trump to show respect for the democratic process when he‚Äôs never demonstrated the capability? In fact Trump continues do everything possible to undermine it. This can only called for in the most extreme of circumstances, but here we are.
"This is a winning pick for the Biden campaign in every way imaginable."  Joe Biden's pick of U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his VP running mate may boost enthusiasm for him among Black voters, says Prof.
Trump would single out Booker because: 1) Trump is a lying idiot 2) Booker will be a powerful campaigner for Biden/Harris 3) Trump is completely ignorant 4) Maybe Trump got Booker and Ben ("Dr. HUD") Carson confused?
we are anti-all US presidents. the US empire shouldn‚Äôt exist + all US presidents have been evil war criminals, capitalists, white supremacists, and cops. trump is no diffferent than biden or obama at the end of the day, so we don‚Äôt see anything good abt identifying as anti-trump.
I‚Äôm certain Biden and the DNC had to heavily consider the best candidate based on SNL performances also.
I really hope they keep pushing this. Maybe it‚Äôll accidentally convince some of the ‚Äúbern it all down‚Äù crowd to get out and vote for the ‚Äúradical leftists‚Äù Biden/Harris.
I think that all Venezuelans, especially the US diaspora and  should lobby Biden and his advisers to come out against the December 6th farce elections in Venezuela.  This could help Guaido pressure Maduro into granting a delay and gaining conditions.
Believe me that single-payer isn't mainstream Democratic policy.  Free college for all isn't mainstream Democratic policy.  Biden won the Democratic primary while being against those things.
Yep If elected Harris would be president within one year due to Biden dementia issue
While voters don't pick their candidate based on their VP ,  can give the campaign just a little bit more mobility and range on left of center issues, and will help on messaging.  ( last night on #ChicagoTonight
LOL you're only making some of your racist base go vote for Biden instead with this ad!! üòÜüòÜüòÜ
I'd love to know what Biden's plan is (seriously).  I am legit afraid that he'd throw Guaido and the G4 under the bus in favor of the misfit toys in the "mesita" and endorse fake parliamentary elections like Chris Murphy seems to want to do.
Biden may be against sanctions, support fake elections, support the mesita, and throw Guaido under the bus.  That is the legitimate concern.
Do you think we will see Prince Harry campaigning for Joe Biden this year or is that a leap too far?
Biden is the top of the ticket. So it‚Äôs Trump or Biden? Pretty simple. Stop the nonsense
I have an aunt who lives in Hockessin, Delaware and every time I've seen my cousin he's like "I've been on Biden's property."  Yeah, honey, I've done my share of trespassing too.
This is really more of a Delaware joke than a Biden joke.
Kind of want to have an election night party.   "For Kamala we have Jamaican jerk chicken and Indian tikka masala. And for Biden, to represent Delaware we have...um...scrapple?"
Okay, but I'm excited to see who Biden picks for his Cabinet!
Biden/Harris 2020. I‚Äôm all in! #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris #Biden #Harris
Nobody in America should legitimately support Kamala Harris or be happy about Biden‚Äôs selection of her to be his running mate.
Trump: names a member of the Amway family as secretary of education  Biden: picks a VP who let Herbalife off the hook  Anyone wanna do a video with me about major politicians siding with MLMs??
I think a lot the problem with politics is Republicans think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the radical left, and the actual left thinks Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are Republicans.
Sometimes the obvious needs to be pointed out.   The "racism" is on Laura Ingraham.  Kamala Harris is a proven vote getter in the the most populous state in the nation.  Joe Biden picked the candidate that would most help him get elected President.
Actually, Bill, that choice for VP actually hurts Biden and the Democrats. This is a woman who called Biden a sexist and racist and now they‚Äôre supposed to run together? Seriously? Do you think Harris is ready to run the country? I don‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs what will happen.
Finally some good news! Nearly a 20pt margin. Intraparty war is unavoidable with Biden's self-proclamation that he's just a bridge to the future.
Nothing against Maya Rudolph but I don't give a fuck that she may be getting more airtime because of Biden's VP pick.
He wants Nikki, he‚Äôll look weak doing it. He will be copying Biden, and will look small. But Trump will do it anyway out of desperation, plus because he IS small. He‚Äôll kick Pence to the curb if it helps him.
Yes but the Harris Biden 2020 platform is a plank on the Titanic
Doesn‚Äôt matter Harris Biden 2020 are going to loose
My takeaway: it looks I have the same laptop as Biden. Wonder if he also has keyboard issue with his, and how he deals with it.
Great for POTUS within a smaller and shrinking group of people.  Great for Biden in a larger and expanding group of people.
"All the White Guys"??   Some of us White Guys are fine with Biden's choice.  Oh, I almost forgot, Biden is a White Guy.Yes ! I believe that‚Äôs why there off until Labor Day so they can make mass copies of mail in fraud and also I believe that #kamalaHarrass will be eventually claiming #biden of sexual harassment to take over for the far left
So Biden said if you don‚Äôt vote for him #YouAintBlack, majority of the Black community don‚Äôt even vote so it‚Äôs gone be a lot of melanin being taken after the electionüò≠
Why can't we ever see Biden answer a damn question. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #WalkAway #TrumpTrain #follo4follo #KAG
My grandpa passed away with Alzheimer‚Äôs which is similar to dementia. The way they‚Äôre treating Joe Biden is wrong, dude shouldn‚Äôt be involved in politics at all.
But that's my point - Biden does better with those groups, but Obama did too!  Tammy Baldwin does too in WI, Gary Peters in MI, there are obviously more examples.  To me the takeaway might be that HRC was UNIQUELY bad with those groups, but other D's are less bad.
Again, has it?  I'm totally willing to be convinced by data here, but Biden is as normal of a D as it gets and it certainly seems right now like his EC disadvantage will be smaller than HRC's in 2016.
I just dispute the idea that the gap has widened.  Biden is doing better with non-college whites, and with seniors, which flattens out his issues in the Upper Midwest as compared to HRC.
And by conservative I mean from Biden's perspective - the bar being winning the PV by 3.5 feels like a bit (only a bit) of overkill.
Kamala Harris is a bigger joke then what Biden is. I hope these 2 idiots don‚Äôt get the chance to run our country!!
How else could the virus of been contained? Marshall law back in March? We all stay in our homes for 2 weeks? Do you know how many businesses would‚Äôve went out because of doing such a thing!!! Our economy will def go down the drain if you and Biden get elected!!
In my opinion only. Shes coming out to hurt the Biden campaign. There is no way she is going to let  get into the White House.  Shes always felt it was her destiny and another woman would never be allowed.  Especially a woman of color.  Because Hillary is a Racist

Dr. Siegel tells Tucker Carlson there is 'no science' behind Biden's mask mandate  #FoxNews
My husband and I are white older Americans, no college education; however, our knuckles don‚Äôt hit the ground, so we are Biden voters.
Trump is also terrible and incompetent. Biden is colonialist. Trump is a white supremacist. Biden is also racist, but not a xenophibic nationalist.   We need a left party, but that isn't happening this time.   Let Dems lose to show 'em? That's what we did in 2016. It didn't work.
It's so difficult. I did not vote for Hillary, and I do not believe I was responsible for Trump. However, this time I feel like if I would be. I have been voting third party in the GE for over 30 yrs. For the same reasons you just changed. Biden is terrible and incompetent.

Joe Biden is a liar and a plagiarist.   He is the candidate of division and racial politics.
Interesting that Kamala Harris deep-sixed an ongoing investigation regarding allegations against Catholic clergy following her election to AG.  Suggesting the book, Profiles in Corruption by Peter Schweitzer. Chapter on Joe Biden as well.
Regarding military actions, Biden has no idea what‚Äôs going on so he‚Äôll be conveying it to Kamala. I honestly don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be able to handle that correctly.
Anybody with a brain knows Biden isn‚Äôt mentally competent enough to hold the presidential office for four years.
Kamala called Biden racist because it was a debate so now we just calling people racist for a political tug. Sounds fishy now how that word is being used in the political realmüßê
Have to admit I teared up when you were talking about Beau Biden and his dad.
He can be whatever but I‚Äôm not saying he helped necessarily. I‚Äôm just saying with all that he has done I would just feed everybody to wolves aka Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

I've long wondered about those elusive likely voters, out there somewhere in the cosmos, who this week said to themselves "I was going to vote for Biden, but now that Kanye is in I'm on board with him".
Joe Biden for Black people?
Joe Biden picked a ‚Äúwoman of color‚Äù to be progressive instead of picking the best person available. Clown sh*tü§°
So Biden was Catholic when he ran for VP but not now?
Biden choosing Kamala Harris as his VP is a dog whistle for Black America‚Äôs matriarchal society.
So Biden said #YouAintBlack he was talking about Kamala. I completely get it now.
That did. I'm also happy. I think who ever makes Biden's decisions for him, made a mistake. We have on record saying she believes his accusers, how do you walk away from that? #Trump2020 #MAGA #PatriotsAwakened #tcot #VoterIDNow #FreedomOfSpeech #BuildTheWall
The New Blacks loving this Kamala/Biden combo
Trump signed the First Step Act, said Black Americans built this country, had the lowest Black unemployment rate in history, and did school of choice. I honestly would back out if I was him and feed y‚Äôall to Biden and Harris lmao.
Remember how Obama and Biden beat each other up trying for the nomination? Then became the best of buds.
I'm shocked that Kamala Harris has been picked as Biden's VP candidate.  Especially after she inadvertently called the entire Democrat party racist &amp; sexist.  TWICE!
Bet Biden steps down. Kamala moves up. Hillary is the VP.

So Black America says they‚Äôre tired of getting involved with the police yet are putting their faith in Biden and Harris. Make it make sense...

From what I understand, if Biden is elected, we will. If Trump is elected he wants to make this windfall a gift. #Trump2020 has always kept his promises. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #WalkAway #TrumpTrain #follo4follo #KAG #FreedomOfSpeech #BuildTheWall #VoterIDNow #Freedom
The Democrats are up to something, they damn well know Biden is not fit to be president. You can't lead  our nation from the basement. They are using this man for something deviant. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #WalkAwayFromDemocratSocialists #MAGA #Trump
If the Democrats are willing to use a "friend" Joe Biden the way they are, then using the American people is nothing. They want POWER, they know Biden is a shell of his former self. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #WalkAwayFromDemocratSocialists #MAGA #Trump #RedWaveRising2020
Joe Biden should pick Maxine Waters for V.P. She could really articulate with that loud mouth.
Joe Biden has been in the senate or WH longer than I have been alive. He says he can change everything for the better if we give him just a little more power. What has he changed in the last 40 years? Well he put a whole lot of POC in prison with the crime bill he's so proud of..
Black people complain about ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù then forgive Joe Biden everytime he says something crazy but won‚Äôt forgive Kanye. Make it make sense...
idk if im getting old or this is a token year, but i am REALLY excited to see the presidential debates between Trump and Biden
Biden and Trump locked in. Ye sketching out a solid plan, ppl don‚Äôt like his comments about slavery and Harriet so I don‚Äôt see it gaining real tractionüò≠
‚ÄúI can beat Biden off write-in‚Äôs‚Äù -
I can‚Äôt imagine not one person voting for #crookedjoe, most #Americans see right through the #Biden campaign and unless he #debates  he will lose any sensible #American s vote! All #biden does is continuously insult the black &amp; Latino community , #BidenIsRacist
Never trump gives us a Biden presidency.
Just released ‚Äî   Preliminaries for the Trump v. Biden Debate:  1. Bill Walton v. Lou Holtz 2. Gary Busey v. Jose Canseco 3. Dick Vitale v. Tim McCarverI‚Äôm voting for Biden as well here in Illinois !üíô
The post had nothing to do with a mental health crisis. And if he‚Äôs putting his name in the hat for the Presidency, albeit, ostensibly to hurt the Biden-Harris ticket, he‚Äôs fair game for public critique.
If Biden couldn‚Äôt do it, it‚Äôs definitely out of your realm. Think about that for a second. Obviously someone else made it happen and as usual your trying to take credit. #Loser #BidenHarris2020 #BLM
I honestly believe America owes Hillary an apology. The sexism in this country is so deep until we don't even realize we're being sexist.  From a political view, if Hillary was man, she would look like Biden. Same generation, same ethnicity, same politics, same experience, etc..
So there‚Äôs no chance of Barr arresting Obama, Biden and Rice?
Hey   thanks for your outstanding work! What‚Äôs this I‚Äôm hearing about how the Rs will claim that Biden is ineligible to be potus? Something Ron Johnson is cooking up vis a vis Burisma?  I can‚Äôt think of what if anything that could invalidate Biden‚Äôs candidacy.
Last year you said you believed Joe Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúinappropriate touching‚Äù accusers and called him everything but a racist in the primaries.
Amazes me that the 'best' candidates for the biggest job in the world are Trump and Biden... Not a great advert for the US. And, yes, I think Trump will get re-elected.
This was very interesting.

Anyway, much less than B Hussein Obama have to muslims and Joe Biden got from Chinese government and Ukrainian Gas Company
‚ÄúWhen Joe Biden is president he‚Äôll listen to the facts. He‚Äôll embrace science. And we will all be better for it.‚Äù Wait, that's Kamala, so it still doesn't count.
You are literally cheering over 10 million unemployed. No one is should be happy about where we are. No one including you or the don or future president Biden.
real leadership is what Trump announced this morning . Biden also said the travel ban was bad.
Trump supports law abiding hard working people. Biden/Harris support arrest for no mask and looters robbers murders arsonist destroying our cities.

You are playing right into the hands of China.  The same hands that pull the strings on senile old joe Biden.
I dispute that.  Not the thing about Biden, no.  I dispute her claim to have the power of thought.
If you think joe Biden getting a hold of an executive office is gonna lead to a Marxist revolution I‚Äôm really sorry. Nothing will change, Democrats don‚Äôt want it to.
This tweet of yours is racist, Joe Biden! Smell the coffin now, before it gets too late for you.
You have him confused with Biden
Wow!! What is this? A phone!?! Biden hides in his basement because they don‚Äôt want you to know it‚Äôs really a memory care unit.
Biden said the China travel ban was racist and Nancy told us to go have dinner in China town.  How soon we conveniently forget.
This is greatüéâ probably not far from the truth with the upcoming debate. We can only hope Biden comes locked in his TV!
Not worse than Biden who doesn‚Äôt know the state he‚Äôs in isn‚Äôt a city and the office he‚Äôs running for isn‚Äôt the Senate. As well as letting the party hide him in the basement for fear of what he‚Äôll say üòÇ
I‚Äôm grateful for the Biden/Harris ticket. Not ready to get too excited b/c after 2016, I‚Äôm realistic. A lot of BS is going to happen between now &amp; then &amp; I refuse to take anything for granted. I will vote, my husband will vote and my children will vote. BLUE!

Biden hasn‚Äôt got to win Texas Donald! #TrumpPressBriefing
This guy, Rudy, who made a fool of himself and President Trump every time he did a TV piece for Trump, is going to attack Biden‚Äôs mental capacity?? Trump created his own new swamp in DC, and Rudy is a major contributor to that.

5 Things to Know About Biden‚Äôs VP Pick, Kamala Harris ‚Äì Her Skeletons Have Skeletons
Racist PoS Donald Trump has less idea about what policies Joe Biden will or will not implement than he does about what colors human skin can achieve naturally.....
So, not an African American female as promised?  Another Joe Biden lie.
Though a better strategy would be for Biden to show up out of respect, but send a flood of messaging beforehand calling out Trump for his delusions, disrespect, demagoguery, and cognitive decline, then let him prove Biden right on the debate stage. Joe won‚Äôt even have to talk.
Agree. How can Biden ask or expect Trump to show respect for the democratic process when he‚Äôs never demonstrated the capability? In fact Trump continues do everything possible to undermine it. This can only called for in the most extreme of circumstances, but here we are.
Only just seen that Donald trump is 74 and Joe Biden is 77. Either of these two could die of old age whilst in office? Surely there are two better people for the job.
She is the biggest cop in California, she failed to prosecute Steve mnuchin, and she was arresting parents and their children for truancy. You couldn‚Äôt have made a worse choice Biden. Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt fight for the working class and neither do you.
I had no hopes in Biden, but will vote for him for his VP pick  #KamalaHarris
If you see me liking any moderate Democrat posts it‚Äôs because my leftist ass is trying to deal with the fact that Biden/Harris are our only hope üòî
Kamala Harris is the perfect embodiment of America; she is American, Black, Asian, Indian, and she is a woman. She is so strong that the present man and his cronies in the white house fear her. By her selection as the VP pick, Joe Biden has proved America will rise from her shame
Biden/Harris 2020. I‚Äôm all in! #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris #Biden #Harris
I really want to go all in w/excitement for Biden/Harris but after 2016, I‚Äôm afraid to get my hopes up. I was soooo crushed. I don‚Äôt know if I can take that again. Especially this time. #VotingBlue
Hence these are called the swing states . Went to trump in ‚Äò16.Most likely will be the same this time around . AZ needs to be blue for Biden to win , was Red by a margin last time . Educated states like NY, CA, WA, IL all are blue.
Joe Biden when it‚Äôs time to draw the clock
Nobody in America should legitimately support Kamala Harris or be happy about Biden‚Äôs selection of her to be his running mate.
imagining an alt timeline where everything was exactly the same until today when Biden picked Chuck Schumer as his running mate
Biden is Catholic.
Joe Biden May be 77 now, but on November 3, he‚Äôll be 46. #BidenHarris2020 #BLM
She wasn‚Äôt my top choice but I do love her as the pick!! She is the right choice! I was voting Biden no matter what, even though he isn‚Äôt my fave pick. Anything but the d√©b√¢cle we have ‚Äúrunningl the country right now!
Report: Harris Wasn't Biden's First Choice
Most people understand what his schtick is now. He lies. About everything; in however it will help him in the moment. I personally know many R‚Äôs that voted for him but will not again.They‚Äôre voting for Biden.They want to reboot their party, but for now we fight together.
Agreed with all you said!!! Probably waaaay more excited about her as VP than Biden as P!!
I highly doubt this.  Biden insists he‚Äôs coming after your guns.
When Trump debates Biden.  Game over.  Biden shredded and walking in circles like he doesn‚Äôt know where he is.

Kamala, Congratulations on your selection as the VP candidate with Joe Biden to be the next President and Vice president of the United States. My entire family and I wish the ticket every success and hope that by the teams election on November 3, we can bring law and order.
2 years of politicing (if that word exists) and you have a choice of Trump or Biden.... is that the best the US has?
Seriously fuck this country. It's bad enough Trump is president but the  couldnt possibly pick THE ONE PERSON THAT WOULD BEAT HIM.. so we get stuck with fucking Joe Biden and now fucking Kamila "Cop" Harris as his VP in the height of BLM  Are you fucking kidding me

Good move by Biden though. She‚Äôs a good choice.
Biden not my 1st Choice for President. Harris not my 1st choice for VP. But I trust both to fight for ALL people and to bring much needed change in regards to many facets of American life. Time to step up and make it America the Beautiful again!! #BidenHarris2020
Trump claims "some say" that men are offended by Biden choosing a woman as his VP.  It's true, what we need is more men in politics.  "Some say" our president is out of his damn mind.
I have a feeling that Barr will charge, indite and arrest Obama, Biden, Rice and others on trumped-up charges as an October surprise. What are your thoughts?

#JoeBiden Just wondering why this man is contesting for this election, why America is putting, Joe Biden, on d BallotPaper for 2020 election, why any American will consider this  for d post of American Presidency. November 2020 Must Come &amp; Pass
April 14th sorry not sorry podcast  they quote Biden saying ‚Äú this callous decision....‚Äù which he tweeted on April 1 on Biden twitter account.    So recorded between April 1 and April 14.
Vote Biden and no worry about SS.  He‚Äôll get $3 trillion for ya!  Trump won‚Äôt let Social Security go. He‚Äôs to smart for that.  He‚Äôll just change the way it‚Äôs funded.
I know my son who lost his job appreciates the $400.  We can fund social security by getting rid of some of the washington wreckless spending.  But hey,  if Biden‚Äôs elected, no worries.  He‚Äôs raising taxes $3 TRILLION.
I think what she meant was  a guy picking a girl as in Biden picking a VP not a girl meaning you HRC picking a guy! Got it!!

Biden will convert it to a ski lift
Even the most left leaning polls say that Trump has 25% of the black vote. Biden is making the same mistake Clinton made 4 yrs ago. He's alienating voters faster than Trump is.
It's all about control, influence, power. The DNC doesn't support Biden because they believe in his agenda (if he has any). They push the narrative. And they use naive people to do so.
We have a big voice to make:  - Biden who may be showing signs of mental decline  OR  - ‚ÄúThighland‚Äù Trump who has proven to be very very dumb   Not an easy choice.....
Joe Biden did nothing wrong.
Until the debates when Biden forgets where he is..I said that Biden should turn this into the punchline of a commercial earlier today! That was fast!
Just ignore you can not fix stupid there are tRump 2016 supporters that have seen the light and crossed over to Biden in 2020. I am sure a few more will before this is all over.
‚ÄúHe again repeated his law-and-order message, telling the crowd ‚ÄúNo one will be safe in Biden‚Äôs America.‚Äù
I laughed when I heard Trump say that!  Biden should turn that into the punchline of a commercial.
So Congress is going on a month long vacation in the middle of a pandemic and i still see people taking about the importance of voting Biden over Trump...their both trash. Both parties they represent are trash. Bernie trash too cause his old ass been pretty Fucking quiet.

If you do not collect payroll taxes, which is how social security is funded, you‚Äôre effectively killing social security. Biden did not lie. He understands math, which Trump obviously does not based on all the bankruptcies he‚Äôs been through.

Have Biden and Harris issued a position on "Merry Christmas" yet?  I'm not getting in line at Walmart until I know what I can and can't say.
You directly contradicted yourself, first saying "to keep it to the here &amp; now" and then asking what Biden did 47 years ago. You really aren't very good at this.
Why is the big baby calling Biden a racist? Dump hates black ppl. That‚Äôs why him or his father didn‚Äôt rent to them back in the day. Or did crazy dump forget that? I think dump needs his moms teet again with all his crying!!
When Obama was President, we didn't have to use a mask. The country was never shut down. It wasn't always about him like Trump makes it out to be. When Obama and Biden were in office we were in a much better place as a country.
I'm pretty sure that's the plan... Biden is the one they believe has the best chance of winning. The more interesting bet is the reason they give for him stepping down....
So something will happen to Joe Biden according to Jeannine Piro. Do not let her get away with this.

I‚Äôm voting for Biden
No he won't, people want change. The only way he can win at this point is if he cheats. Biden is winning all ready according to some of (many) polls.

If I unfollowed you it's probably because I caught you supporting the Biden/Harris ticket. I'm not sorry.

Someone better tell Joe Biden! He already mispronounced it!
If Kamala Harris is strong... she would have turned down the Vice Presidency based on what she accused Biden of being. She‚Äôs nothing but a weak opportunist
Kamala Harris came out saying she believes and supports Joe Biden‚Äôs alleged rape victims...now she‚Äôs his running mate. This is American politics.
There‚Äôs plenty of other angles to go at Biden with and be successful. No need to even touch the racist or sexual abuse allegations.

READ THE THREAD.   We‚Äôre not just voting for Biden/Harris. We‚Äôre voting for so much more than that. And getting Trump out of office is just an extra added bonus.
I am not watching either! I am celebrating Biden/Harris then watching the Grassroots rally at 630. It's a Great Day!
Trump hasn't mention Biden or Harris. You guys haven't mentioned Cannon Hinnant.
You guys are the best!!!hard to watch him after Biden/Harris it was so refreshing!
I just can't believe a word Biden or Harris say. Friends, family, and strangers I find vote for them lose all my respect. Don't expect me to give a üí© if you are in trouble and need help. I will look you in the eye and laugh as you take your last breath. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I won‚Äôt lie.... Biden‚Äôs speech was the most Presidential speech we‚Äôve gotten since Trumps been in office.... Because he cannot even articulate what‚Äôs going on in the world.
biden is tearing trump a new one.
The madness stops with a Biden/Harris ticket? I‚Äôm equally scared for a Biden presidency, the same policies will be passed and the same bills will be signed. Only difference is the country will fall back asleep believing that we‚Äôre back to some sense of normalcy.
If Trump doesn‚Äôt attend the inauguration of Joe Biden, should he win, what happens to the football?  The guy quietly moves from one president to the next at 12pm on January 20th.

undecideds really splitting for biden huh
I'm not saying you shouldn't vote for Biden/Harris. I am saying this "you HAVE to vote for the *lesser evil*!" shit has to stop. The lesser evil bit has to stop in general. It's fucking awful. We need legitimately good choices, not scraps of "who is slightly less terrible"
A good sign:  "DuPage Dems - Biden 2020 ***We are sold out, new signs are being printed. We will deliver signs for new orders as soon as they are in.***"
Right-Wing Bishop Dismisses Joe Biden‚Äôs Catholic Faith in Pathetic Attack
She‚Äôs ranked as the most liberal politician in DC, she ranked even higher than commie Bernie! Stop lying, she is not a centrist and either is Biden!
Biden is trying to give Harris the phone because he doesn‚Äôt understand she‚Äôs not in the room.
Your "logic" is absurd, since no one but the winner qualifies in your mind and Biden can't nominate himself. It's the case of your comment being ridiculous. Bless your heart.
You are nuts! You liberals always project! Biden is the one who can‚Äôt come out of his basement because he has dementia!
peters is constantly performing the same if not better than biden on average. lol.
Is the shaking of your glass the DTs or your fear of the Biden/Harris ticket?
Oh this is funny. Trump actually thinks Biden could possibly be a bigger racist than him. Hilarious.
That is so sick!   I believe the black/Asian/white communities will vote for Biden/Harris before Trump!!  We need a REAL President!!!
You are so sneaky Bill. A real genius. Since Joe says he's running against Joe Biden, let's have Kamala debate Joe Biden.  #BidenHarris2020  #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
Can we reclaim "suburban soccermom" from Trump, please! #BidenHarris2020
Something Biden should definitely think about!  I do think that Biden is much tougher than Trump and his team think and definitely more cognitively fit.  Trump is the one who needs to beware! Remember ‚Äúcovfefe‚Äù?
Amazing,yet he, Comey, Strzuk, Clinton, Obama, Schiff, Pelosi, and so many more, all walk freely,no swat raid at gun point at their homes, nada. Now- Biden/Harris?Why?Please, action where your mouths are and indict these monsters, please!They‚Äôre literally destroying our country!
Biden is under no moral obligation to debate someone with no compunction about lying.

any choice biden picked would be immensely better than pence.  whatever he has done if anything during his term.
I think this headline is sexist.  Could you imagine "Biden Embraces Durbin" or Biden Embraces Buttigieg" or "Trump Embraces Pence"? Uh-uh. It would have been "selects" or "announces." Do better, Chicago Tribune. #WeHaveHerBack #ChicagoTribune
Biden shot himself in the foot and gave Trump the election. He should have picked Tulsi Gabbard. A smart, articulate, young woman. Ex-military, dedicated to her religion of peace and kindness...she would have balanced the ticket. I support Trump, but I would have voted for them.
Biden is a strong leader who is respectful of others opions and take them into consideration when making a decision. A good leader will surround themselves with others that can give good information on the other side another set of eyes that may not see things the way he does.
Does  support this attempt by Democrats to destroy suburbs &amp; local control? If you have a ‚ÄúSave Main‚Äù sign in your yard in Glen Ellyn this is leaps &amp; bounds worse than anything you can imagine happening to your neighborhood #twill #AFFH
Morning everyone. I wanted to say something about reactions from last night. So, I know most of y'all are upset with Biden/Harris, I'm not happy either but let's really sit and think for a moment. Do we honestly really want another 4 years of Trump?
Why do any Libertarians care?  We were not voting for Biden anyway, right?
In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
Biden waited to announce, now the news cycle is so far removed from where it was when Kamala was running that most boomers have probably forgotten all the bullshit that went down
In case you need more atheists to be disappointed by, here's Ayaan Hirsi Ali insanely claiming Biden wants Sharia Law.
Fundraising for Harrison has been through the roof recently and with biden closing the gap in this state, Harrison is out performing biden in multiple demographics.
In order to gain the minority vote the Democrats add Kamala Harris as the VP, Harris called Joe Biden a rapist and a racist during the primaries and is a firm supporter of legislation that is killing major cities in the US (like Chicago). Hypocrites!
Second historic ticket for future President Biden!
Today, the Biden-Harris campaign officially kicked off. 84 Days remain until we beat Donald Trump. And I advise you to use every last one of them to ensure we get Joe Biden and Kamala Harris into office.
‚ÄòWe need a new direction‚Äô: GOP ex-gov John Kasich explains why he‚Äôs backing Biden over Trump #SmartNews
biden fumbled the bag fr
Don't see what new voters she brings to Biden that he didn't already have. And he wins California anyway.
All those characteristics Donald Trump and his worthless kids lack!!   Joe Biden and Kamala Harris bring decency back to the White House and bring us back to a position of power in the world!!üóΩ
Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate.  Someone at Fox 9 has a sense of humor.
üó≥ I am!! Biden/Harris all the way!!
Reporter: Mr. Biden, any comments on your selection of Kamala Harris as your running mate? Biden: Who's Biden?
Biden should have picked Tulsi Gabbard. She is smart, articulate, a veteran (the last veteran picked by the Dems war JFK), she is committed to her faith of peace and respect and a young attractive woman. She would bring balance to the Biden team, but Joe shot himself in the foot.
Imagine his excitement when Biden hears who he chose.
I think that a Biden Harris ticket will appeal to cross over voters. The least ‚Äòscary‚Äô ticket the Dems could have put up. RVAT will be on board. Just need the left of the Left to vote too.
Obama: ‚ÄúNailed it‚Äù  Biden: ‚ÄúUh.......nailed her......or its‚Äù
Remember when Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a Racist?
When Biden heard he picked Kamala Harris as his running made,  he responded, "darn, I wish he would've picked me".
Biden is Catholic. Harris is Baptist.   Republicans will still pretend they're godless.
No surprise here for anyone who's watched his shift to the right. Biden chose Harris, so the former president of American Atheists says he'll consider four more years of Christian Right rule.
I guess I'm more concerned about what does she bring to the table. She doesn't court progressives. She doesn't court black people. She doesn't bring in purple states. Unknown what she actually brings that can make biden a stronger candidate other than optics
Biden goes to the same Catholic Church as my grandma in Delaware.
I know that is why I said Joe Biden is the President not Kamala.
Lets hope that need will not arise. please. I just want Joe Biden to have his turn. without putting him one foot in the grave!
Yes! I'm am beyond thrilled!!! Can't wait to send in my check, get my sign, and get to work to elect the Biden-Harris ticket!
I am thrilled that Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his Vice President mate.  I was hoping it would be her.  This is a very strong Democratic team for the 2020 race.
I am sooo EXCITED and looking forward to a landslide WIN in November as future VP Kamala described as ‚Äúa fearless fighter for the little guy and one of the country‚Äôs finest servants,‚Äù joins future President Biden in the November race. Every vote counts!!!
You‚Äôre babbling and running scare!! Biden/Harris 2020
Biden‚Äôs VP pick is the first hopeful thing that‚Äôs happened in this country in a long time,
I disagree but we will see how she will work for everyone. I will pray for her &amp; her family to help us to regain our dignity across the world. I promise to support her as she moves forward. I hope she will support Joe Biden as he did Obama!  Remember Joe Biden is the President!
I wouldnt worry. From her latest tweet. ‚ÄúI allow myself to get roped into arguments with Star Trek Trolls because it allows me to argue about something *abstract* instead of something that matters. Such as: Sweet Jesus if Biden doesn't pick a VP who is at least marginally...‚Äù
In case anyone on the Biden/Harris campaign in listening I'll debase myself for $100, heck, I'll talk myself down to $50 for you
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate #SmartNews.It is most welcome and appropriate decision
Congratulations  ! Now we need all DuPage Dems to unite behind the Biden/Harris ticket and get intelligence, integrity, and a taste for justice back into the White House!
Biden would win California without her. What other state does she help him win.
Going to pass busy celebrating Biden/Harris announcement! Actually you can count me out for any of your briefings which I don't listen to anyway?
I raised my hand. I‚Äôm voting for Biden
Guess what Pence in many ways Biden is correct.
biden is a throw away candidate like  romney was in 2012..... the DNC is setting up  for 2024.. 2028...... # totalcontrol
A great pick. I was a Harris fan from the beginning and very happy Biden chose her.
Biden is a class act. This doesn‚Äôt surprise me one bit.
I am just so excited at the news!! Congratulations to Kamala Harris!! She will be great with Joe Biden!! There truly is a light at the end of the tunnel!!  My only disappointment: was looking forward to her being AG and going after Trump and family!!!
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist?Preach. I‚Äôm debating a neighbor who thinks he had a gotcha moment because maybe Antifa and BLM endorsed Biden. I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúbitch, KKK actually endorsed Trump, what‚Äôs your fucking point?‚Äù
You guys must be really desperate to be relying on such obvious hoaxes.  Biden answers questions all the time.   You're done. Expect to be indicted as a co-conspirator.
Taking the Biden approach
I gave it up so I will do a shot every time Biden says something coherent.
Or the addled Biden and his leftist comrades are the first step into the socialist abyss.  Signed...A Retrograde White Male.
Like the 70 votes to try to cripple or repeal Obamacare, the gov't shutdown over Christmas to extort money for his vanity wall, and cutting food stamps, this is just more petty spite.   The irony is that Biden doesn't need to campaign in POUTS's home town.
Trump is not destroying America! Who is against law and order- Democrat‚Äôs. Biden is corrupt and sneaky!
I though it would be a picture of Biden, Harris, and the squad
Chris standing up and criticizing Biden even though he is probably center left.  Don't expect that from Chuck Todd or George S.  Maybe Brennan if CBS lets her
Well my across the street neighbor tried to board the SS Comfort to rescue mole kids, claiming she was the coronavirus, but they arrested her because she had a truck full of knives and had made credible threats on Joe Biden. That‚Äôs who Q people are.
My husband just had the best analogy for Biden vs Trump. Biden is like stubbing your toe and Trump is like being water boarded. I don't like stubbing my toes but I'd rather do that than be water boarded for 4 more years.
Stop trying to snatch defeat before the election. This is counterproductive. This could have been written while Obama and Biden were in office years ago.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
The National Association of Letter Carriers represents 300,000 current and retired workers.
I'm voting for Biden. It's fun trolling the president.
Just to be clear, me voting for #HawkinsWalker2020  is not helping trump, cause I would not be voting for Biden either way. If there was truly only two choices, I wouldn't choose either Biden or trump. Because neither of them or thier parties give a dam about the workers.
‚ÄòJoe doesn‚Äôt know too much‚Äô: #Trump slams #Biden‚Äôs call for a nationwide mask mandate, Democrat irony detected ‚Äì
I bet John Lewis was pretty fucking tired too.  I bet the rise of Trump was devastating to him.  So what do you want to do?  Give up?  What‚Äôs the point of this tweet?  Nevertheless, we persist.  You remember that?  Vote Biden/Harris.
This 7-second clip of Kamala Harris, from before her being named as Biden's running mate, has been viewed 6 million times.  The Democratic VP candidate is popular in a way Mike Pence can never be.
Biden and vice presidential running mate Sen. Kamala Harris spoke briefly Thursday after being briefed by public health and economic experts on the coronavirus pandemic. What are your thoughts on a national face mask requirement?
I feel some confidence that Biden can be pushed to the left, but also little confidence that he'll do anything about income inequality or foreign intervention.
I pay more attention to the ratings. The more people that watch Fox, it tells me who the viewers will vote for. Biden and Trump know that. That is why they are spending almost double the ad revenue with Fox than CNN and MSNBC combined.
Fifteen lies that POUTS keeps repeating in the propaganzas he pretends are "press briefings" or "news conferences".  [They're neither; there is little new, they are rife with false claims, and he rarely gives an honest, straight answer to a question.]
Also POUTS: "If Biden and Harris are elected, they will steer the Earth into the Sun!"
I agree with the folks talking about courting centrist/moderate Republican and Independent voters. If those people see a prominent, nationally recognized Republican talking about why they should vote for Biden they might actually think about it.
Feel free to criticize Biden all you want when he is in a position to "hurt" you. Right now, trump is the danger.
Forgive  man. He get delusional like Biden
Watching Obama and Biden together was extraordinary and wonderful. Kind of like watching a father play ball with his son before little league.
Why are you boosting Biden-Harris with tweets like this?
It does when you consider the very real possibility that Biden could die in office. They needed someone that would play puppet for the DNC if Biden does kick that bucket. Fucked up.
She talked like physically something is going to happen to Biden, the the other guy kind of rescued her out of that conversation! She should be removed for her statement, plus is she planting ideas in a deranged Trump supporters mind? Sick lady!
After 51 Years in DC ,If you think Joe Biden  is suddenly going to bring change. You are an Idiot!
Clearly, Pirro has a direct channel to QAnon.  Her prediction of Biden's demise is as certain as QAnon's prediction of Hillary Clinton's arrest and deportation in 2017.
The fact that Republicans are indoctrinated is not news, let alone newsworthy.  What matters now is how Independent voters view the Biden-Harris ticket vs the Trump-Haley - sorry, "Trump-Pence" ticket.
Yea for sure. I‚Äôm not saying it is. I am saying the fact of the matter is we will either have Biden or Trump as our piece of shit president.
The Q Cucks Clan is out in FORCE attacking Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. They can ALL go to hell.  While I'm at it, ANYONE who is OK with taking ANY risk of giving tRump and his Nazi fife 4 more years, can go fuck themselves, too.  If THAT is your thing, unfollow me immediately.
No I actually know about it, was just hoping you might be able to link me to something more creditable than ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù. I fucking hate Biden, &amp; if I had to guess, I‚Äôd say he totally assaulted her, but I‚Äôm not about to make judgements without any proof.
Biden‚Äôs a rapist?
So you genuinely prefer the Green Party over Biden?
The responses I‚Äôm getting to this prove the point I‚Äôm making. I see A LOT of rude criticism of people who are settling for Biden, yet so many of you clearly have settled for the Green Party. If you want Bernie, vote Bernie. It‚Äôs equally as productive as voting Green.
I cringe at the idea of having to vote for Biden/Harris but to put it simply -I am not a trump supporter, so I will be contributing to the alternative. This does not correct much, but it‚Äôs a start to undoing the hate that has unraveled since 2016
Neither Biden or Harris mentioned George Floyd or Breonna Taylor. Think about that!
When the field of dems was in double digits Biden was of the last preferences for me. Our 2 party system is horrid but abjecting is support for trump. There‚Äôs no way around that. He is pure hate and I cannot support him in any way. Biden‚Äôs bad, but 45 is in another league.
Biden has a terrible history and so does Harris but it‚Äôs nothing near the incumbent. I hate having 2 bad choices but I can be sensible enough to not pout &amp; throw a self righteous hissy fit about it.  I‚Äôm voting for Biden who I hate slightly less than 45

I don‚Äôt use my xfinity Comcast email address for anything. What are the chances they sold it to the Red and Blue? First Trump emails and now Biden‚Äôs joined the party. #comcast #xfinity #democrats #republican #spam
It‚Äôs always been on us to force change. Whoever is in office is just the barrier. With Biden, the barrier is not as staggering, though he is undoubtedly a barrier.
The two appeared for the first time together as the Democratic presidential ticket.
Maybe the reason CNN is covering Biden live and not Trump is that Biden is credible and presents new, reliable information.  And POUTS just doesn't. #NoMoreFreePropaganzas

I agree. I was just pointing out that the same people complaining about Biden/Harris are the same people that voted for Biden, for the most part. Like we did this to ourselves. Shut up and go vote for him on 11/3. Your time to change the nomination was 2-3 months ago.
The issue is, there were better candidates. It is the voters fault we have Biden. Still better than Trump. Until people are willing to vote for a forward thinking politician ( we will continue to have more of the same, which sucks.
Here's the deal. You stop criticizing Biden, and I'll stop calling you a troll.  Now, is not the time to empower ignorance.

So with Biden‚Äôs VP pick does this means she will do all the speaking or just some????
Donnie,   Did you notice sleepy Joe Biden, picked Kamala? That means you will lose in the biggest defeat EVER!!!! BYE BYE DONNIE
The end result is that the DNC/Biden campaign is, again, counting on both flipping Republican votes, and people on the left-wing of the Democrats voting out of fear of a second Trump term, because nobody on the left is buying Biden/Harris as close to progressive. (5)
This ignores that Biden is basically loathed by leftists both in and out of the party, due to his essentially center-right track record, and a campaign that's essentially "lets just go back to the disappointing Obama years." (4/)
The other strategy is trying to portray Biden as the "left-winger" and Harris as his balance, in theory to try to appeal to a broader base. This was similar to the Obama/Biden ticket, with Obama at least advocating some left policies in his campaign, with Biden as a moderate.(3/)
The Dems are hoping to run the same play as 2016, now that you have organized groups of anti-Trump Republicans endorsing Biden. However, HRC partly lost big states in the rust belt by not actively campaigning in them, and given the realities of 2020, Biden may not be able to.(2/)
My guess is, they're trying to spin Biden as the "left" candidate while using Harris to appeal to the "law &amp; order" crowd. Similar to Obama/Biden. Its a common strategy, even if the candidates don't fall into those categories at all in reality
The first-term U.S. Senator from Illinois was on Biden's list as a possible running mate.
The icing on the cake of the Biden-Harris ticket?  When they win, right-wing extremists can't contemplate agitating some nut job to try to take out Biden, because it would leave a black woman in the Oval Office.  Heh.
congratulations on being selected as joe Biden running mate. Frankly i was hoping you would've got the nomination.... But its good to see you'll be part of the administration.
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris being the focus of today's new cycle has absolutely flipped Trumps crazy switch. He's going off on Hannity tonight. Just a rambling idiot.
Don't worry, Brie.  Senator Sanders has already endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket.  Now we're just waiting for the Sanders campaign laggards to catch up.
Don‚Äôt fall into the Democrats big trap that takes the focus off of Joe Biden and puts focus on his VP choice. No doubt that sleepy Joe will go deeper into hiding and VP Harris will be at the Democratic forefront üí•

I cannot wait till Joe Biden's forced to have a debate with President Trump. That's going to be the end of his campaign guaranteed. He's going to have a meltdown auntie live TV and stumble over his words. This is why they're hiding him.

üíØ but they don't care about working people they only care about Putin and Russia if Trumpers really cared they would be voting for Biden and if they cared about the postal service they would be demanding funding. Trumpers until they start caring should stop buying things online
Thank God that Biden/Harris are on the scene to save our country.  As a senior, I have seen some shit in my day, but Trump is a dire threat to our democracy. Vote BLUE
How can you alienate your own voters by attacking the postal service if people really care about the postal service then they should be voting for Biden if people don't care about the postal service they should do 2 things move out of the country and stop ordering things online.

George Soros, Obama wife, Hillary and Bill, Joe Biden all of them go to prison for conspiracy and spying obamagate it's real I can't wait till they go to prison. That'll be the best thing in the world when you see idiots like that go to prison forever.

Nov we will have and continue to have a real man in the White House president Trump. He's the only one that can help America. 50 years of guys like Joe Biden just talking and mumbling get nothing done. And now I'm left satanic socialist is going to help.
I'll do do a virus started by China which is in the pockets with Joe Biden. You must be mentally Disturbed or just delusional to think that this old metal case man in this left-wing socialist is going to do anything good for America. Where do you come up with this satanic banter.

Voting for Democrats is voting for future Marxism. Even if it's voting for "moderate" candidates such as Joe Biden..
READ THE THREAD.   We‚Äôre not just voting for Biden/Harris. We‚Äôre voting for so much more than that. And getting Trump out of office is just an extra added bonus.
What Trump really said: "The suburban housewife will be voting for me because they are thrilled I will protect them from blackie blackman! Biden will let blackie blackman move next door!"
Agreed. Trump has a strategy that will work with his base but he already has them. He doesn't seem to have one that will win over anyone outside his base. His best hope is to disaffect borderline Biden-Harris voters so they stay home instead.
Boy Biden a clown wtf this bitch not it !

I know a lot of people in  that really approve of what you're doing, but aren't thrilled with your charisma. PLEASE do whatever you can to win. This country is doomed if biden wins.  On November 4th you say whatever and however you want.  This country needs you and Pence .
Looking at Biden, he has a terrible record from his past- when it comes to race, for women, for rights. And it‚Äôs terrible, we all wanted Bernie. But what we can do is vote for the policies he has on the table right now, they aren‚Äôt the best- but tolerable compared to Trump.
Also, Warren's Senate seat could easily go to a Republican. No way Harris's seat flips.  Biden ain't that dumb. If he was on the fence, it wasn't between Warren and Harris.
Biden ain't that dumb. If it's down to Harris or Warren, Harris is the obvious choice. I was all in for Warren for President, but she's almost as old as Biden and would not be a good choice to succeed him. Harris is a good choice to be his successor.
I just can't believe a word Biden or Harris say. Friends, family, and strangers I find vote for them lose all my respect. Don't expect me to give a üí© if you are in trouble and need help. I will look you in the eye and laugh as you take your last breath. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
the u.s. has had an average of 9 cases of ebola since 1900, her speech doesn't even make sense. obama made the health care crisis worse with obama care, not better. this same circumstance would have happened under an obama/biden presidency
I won‚Äôt lie.... Biden‚Äôs speech was the most Presidential speech we‚Äôve gotten since Trumps been in office.... Because he cannot even articulate what‚Äôs going on in the world.
Does he mean better than Obama-Biden did for eight years when they threw $4 trillion at it.
Biden cares about regular Americans he will bring us jobs end hatred and bring change decency respect and dignity to the WH and to the world stage. The age of sexism will end and everyone saying sexist things about Harris will be held accountable and will lose their jobs.
Biden/Harris in TV.  You have got to win this election!  Our sanity and health depend on a win.  PLEASE
Biden doesn't tolerate sexist attacks against Kamala Harris and i don't either and i will end any friendship with people who say sexist things about Kamala. I am tired of the sexism we should've had a female president in 2016 and we will have a female VP.#BidenHarris2020Landslide

How to Watch Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' First Appearance Together After VP Announcement   On Tuesday, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee&amp; Joe Biden&amp;
I see Biden as a place holder, he has moderate views that aren‚Äôt strong enough to get us where we need to go. But the important ticket is to prevent further damage done by Trump, hold the Supreme Court secure, and hopefully in 4 years elect an actual progressive.
Does Biden have a China policy? Or is he too busy lining his pockets (or those of his close relatives) with yuan?
also reads: White women will vote for me because I‚Äôm making sure we keep blacks and browns away from their affluent neighborhoods. Biden wants blacks and browns to have equal opportunity to safe and privileged housing/neighborhoods, can‚Äôt let that happen. Peep his use of ‚Äúinvade‚Äù

i won‚Äôt take Ye seriously until I see him debating on the stage with Biden and Trump, in that moment my head will explode
Keep brown people out of the suburbs is all this is. I can't wait until.Biden wins and puts this country back on track and improves the lives of all the people not just the rich of white ones.
Biden looks like he's moving a lot because he's making up for twenty years of Democrats failing to keep up with American society‚Äîwhich they go away with (until 2016) because the Republicans are so far off center that Democrats didn't feel the usual pressure to keep pace.
If anything, Obama and Clinton were the outliers here. Both were well to the right of mainstream. Obama got away with it, but Clinton did not. Biden is trying not to repeat Clinton's mistake.
Democrats are supposed to be the majority party. Majority parties have to track with majority opinion or they stop being the majority party.  Biden is doing what every Democrat has done since 1930, and yet people like you act surprised when they do it.
This thread perfectly articulates how I‚Äôve been feeling since Biden announced Kamala. Thanks for sharing  !
Read through the toxic Biden Bros in this thread threatening people for criticizing Biden.
Joe Biden has more American blood on his hands than just about anyone you could name, including terrorist leaders. That's not some small thing for you to condescend over.
Do you see how out of touch you seem dismissing peoples' problems with Biden as being "a ticket I 'dont like'"? Like that's psychotic
Biden is also not going to help with the environment or student debt. People with power do not willingly reduce their own power for the benefit of the powerless.
When will liberal Proggressives take ownership of what they‚Äôve created in this country! Division, censorship, hate of cops, hate if the US! Biden/Harris you are  #(D) evilAwakens

In order to gain the minority vote the Democrats add Kamala Harris as the VP, Harris called Joe Biden a rapist and a racist during the primaries and is a firm supporter of legislation that is killing major cities in the US (like Chicago). Hypocrites!

All the people complaining about Harris also hate Joe Biden. I get that it's hard for a centrist to imagine someone having a self-consistent and honest worldview, but most people actually just don't like establishment politicians.

What exactly is it you're claiming? Are you denying all of the horrific violence I'm referring to happened? Are you claiming Biden somehow wasn't involved in any of it? Or are you saying that it doesn't matter because they mostly happened in the third world?
Yes, I am so awash in privilege that I'm familiar with the role Joe Biden has played in war crimes committed by the US since the early 1970s and think that those crimes actually matter
Biden supported Pinochet throughout his politicide. That's just a fact. I'm sorry if it offends you.

Hi Elizabeth! I wanted Biden to pick you, but he did the politically correct thing. Let's hope &amp; pray Ms. Harris is everything we need and more!
She does nothing but lie.    Why do you always lie? Do you still believe  accusers? Still believe he is a racist as you stated  short time ago?   Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Even all around the Biden‚Äôs
Also: Joe Biden is the secret head of Antifa/BLM while *simultaneously* being a closet segregationist.
It was awful how Biden bragged about grabbing women by the pussy. Oh, wait.
Deadass all yalls reasons for why I should vote Biden are just why I shouldnt let Trump get elected. Stop pretending it's noble or patriotic to vote for him. It sucks, full stop.
I watch the president‚Äòs news conference I love the way the reporter kept saying we don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs behind it we don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs behind it when she asked about antifa Biden hook up when you type in antifa(1)
Already done after you and Biden spoke today! #VoteBidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide #VoteOutCorruptGOP #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpVirusDeathToll165K
I bet Joe Biden got permission to play the song too!
Idk I mean Biden can't even say sentences correctly. Trump is terrible but I doubt Biden is the answer. Good thing there is checks and balances otherwise, whether it be Trump or Biden, America would be in worse shape then it already is.
You personally profited $300,000 dollars from PPP funds. You are a criminal and I hope the Biden administration pursues charges against all of the fraud in the PPP.
‚ÄúHe inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
Joe Biden introduced his newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, with the former vice president and California senator appearing for the first time together as the Democratic presidential ticket.
I swore during the primary I wasn't going to simp for Biden, but the amount of misinformation I see people who claim to be progressives are spewing about his policies / platforms is changing that really quickly.  Get informed. Get registered. Vote.
So the people vote for Biden and now they‚Äôre pushing them aside to replace him with Harris as always your vote means nothing in the Democratic plantation That‚Äôs what cnn is saying
I'd encourage you to read up on Biden's climate plan as well as Harris's voting record with regards to that topic before calling them evil.  They aren't as progressive as AOC / Bernie - but they have some good decisions behind them.
On yesterday‚Äôs VP podcast, your recommendation on how Biden and Harris explain the debate spat... reconciliation... perfect. Also, spot on with Harris needing work on her occasional snarky tone. Thanks.
WATCH NOW: Joe Biden is making his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris on Wednesday.
üîà Listen live today at 2:45 p.m. as we bring you Vice President Joe Biden and new running mate Sen. Kamala Harris' first joint appearance. Listen to  special coverage on 89.1 FM or stream at
Nah we been saying fuck the cops for months and biden done picked a fucking cop. I hate it here
The evil liars never seem to get sick with anything coming from liar45 mismanagement but it‚Äôs shameful they suck out blood of children they leave in the desert to die. Republicans will block them from being held accountable for their broken oath to America! But when Biden is in!
I definitely hope u and Biden do not win even though I don't like Trump.. sounds like u want our country in debt for grand children to have to pay the stimulus back.. 2,000 for parents plus 2,000 per kid.  That is outrageous
So it's joe biden and kamala harris, huh? ... ... ...
I'm probably going to remember Joe Biden awkwardly pawing that quadraplegic's face while telling him he's valid or whatever for the rest of my life
y‚Äôall be like ‚Äúmake sure y‚Äôall vote, but don‚Äôt vote for Biden or Trump‚Äù like huh?
Joe Biden is making his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris at 1 p.m. Wednesday.
I use to claim progressive until Dem primary. Bernie supporters/progressives became hostile to reality. Black people overwhelmingly VOTED for Biden and that was and still is ignored. Dont agree on policy, that's fine but the votes dont lie.
Kamala/Biden really? dems May have just lost California too! Kamala dropped out of the primaries right before she registered single digits in her home state! LOL
The kind that deals with Russian bounties on the heads of our soldiers, I hope! Vote for Biden-Harris!
actually, the point of the video was ‚Äújoe biden has a racism problem‚Äù. if you think that being the president of the united states for 4 years excuses the idea of having a (hypothetical) 6+ hour video proof of racist comments..... somn waaaay wrong here
It's strange here. Joe Biden was the choice population voted for, but government is Republican.
Duckworth is in her first term as Illinois' junior U.S. Senator.
Idk how to feel about Biden, like I hate him but isn‚Äôt Donald trump worse? I would literally vote for the squirrel in ice age over trump any day.
The fix is in. Harris is a long-tongued liar, a stooge, and a tool of a very dark agenda.   It started the day the 20 democrat candidates decided to drop out and make room for a dementia patient, Biden.  Now here we are.  Vote Trump 2020, GOP in all races.
I have been saying this ever since Biden got the nomination. They will use the 25th within 6 months of the Inauguration and Biden goes bye bye. Most important election in November! #Trump2020
Biden-Harris 2020! Vote for Joe! And Kamala!
Just imagine Biden and Harris in the White House most of the black community will be locked up
:45 into Reuters's video you see Kamala behind a Biden podium and not one mask or lonely person in sight.  Democrats revisiting the 90's fad of pox parties?
If there is one thing today I‚Äôm thankful for is I‚Äôm not in the Biden basement with crazy Joe and lose lips Harris
You literally said ‚ÄúWhite guys telling Black voters‚Äù on a Trump tweet. Figured you were talking about Trump. I think both canditates are trash either way but I def wont be voting for Biden just cuz he has a Black running mate lmaooooo
Biden literally said we aren‚Äôt Black if we don‚Äôt vote for him ü§°ü§°ü§°
For as stupid as no malarkey was, and it was so goddamn stupid, at least you knew it referred to biden ya know
I don‚Äôt like Kamala Harris, but I‚Äôm begrudgingly still voting for Biden
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
I stan the character development. RIP my morals but Biden üòî
Someone should print out all the tweets trump has posted since his election day and just have Biden and Harris lug it around to physically reference when asked what they'd do differently.
Leftists in the DNC had their change with Bernie, the dem party internally worked to shut him out and actively backed Biden and lo and behold he's the nominee. It's actively depressing and I think that's the idea after a certain point
And Biden not having enough of a policy or belief system to care that that's what his campaign is
I can't imagine this is anything other than the dem establishment thinking they get use fear of Trump to scrub the left leaning elements out of the party and use a Biden win as a sorta counter to Hillary showing that no, centrists don't beat fascists
anyway Biden is probably going to manage to lose now and i'm gonna go play more Shenmue
The whole Biden nomination process is wild because it's so directly disconnected to everything happening in the zeitgeist today. Like he doesn't back medicare for all, he doesn't support decriminalizing illegal immigration or defunding ICE, he's make a cop his VP
The progressive vote is going to be from mostly young voters I think, and young voters need inspired to vote. I don‚Äôt think Kamala or Biden are going to inspire the youth. I personally feel like Biden was the appeal to the moderate swing voters. He is the status quo.
The lady who has locked people up for weed then laughs on stage about giving tried weed herself. That along with her peak in the polls being 15% shows she isn‚Äôt super popular amongst progressives, which Biden needs to win.
Yes after Joe‚Äôs Announcement MAGA Biden/Harris 2020
Biden cannot be allowed to win, Harris is unhinged
So joe Biden picks up an ex cop and the biggest prosecutor of black men? Ok chief
With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden announced Tuesday that Kamala Harris will be his running mate.
BREAKING: Joe Biden has chosen California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
There are still plenty of folks who voted Trump in 2016 because they believed he was a "lesser of two evils"  If you think the VP selection doesn't matter, you're wrong.   Biden can't just look "less evil"; he has to look good.
Joe Biden is on the cusp of announcing the biggest, and possibly most consequential, decision of his political career with the unveiling of his running mate.
Thank you!! Thats how I feel. Someone suggested Biden should present his cabinet now. I think it's a good idea
If I‚Äôm doing Twitter correctly Biden‚Äôs running mate is...Bindi Irwin. #Biden2020 #biden #Veepstakes #runningmate

If Biden wins, Ron Johnson will find himself in extra deep doodoo.
Biden bought him a pizza and that's how he got his endorsement without supporting UBI
Good, because when Biden is president, he will need the revenue from the financial transaction tax to fill in the huge crater your incompetence has made in the federal deficit.

No, I'm not voting for Trump.  I despise pedophiles so I'll be voting Biden
Biden 2020! Fuck the rube MAGA Cult
Dr. Jill Biden speaking to us!
Biden said it himself. Open your eyes. Push through the TDS
As if voting for Biden isn't wasting a vote. Your statement is utterly irresponsible and disgusting. If ANY presidential candidate were to shoot someone on 5th Ave, they should be eliminated immediately. And to express approval of such an act PROVES what is wrong in this country!
They don‚Äôt understand fully what‚Äôs about to happen.  Then when April comes along and Trump is not in office they‚Äôll blame Biden.
The name Andriy Derkach sounds familiar Ron?  It should since the Kremlin linked Ukrainian admitted he is passing you and Grassley info. He betrayed you Ronnie. Doesn‚Äôt sound like you have a problem with Russia after all.
RUN FOR THE HILLS!!! Biden called for raising levies on taxpayers with incomes exceeding $400k ü•±
djt is a soulless swamp monster that has sucked the morality out of everyone around him with his mental instability and mental incompetency. Biden is Einstein in comparison.
Rep. Kathy Castor wants Florida Congresswoman Val Demings to be the next vice president, other congresswomen including Congresswoman Karen Bass (D-CA), Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Kamala Harris (D-CA) also made the shortlist.
Saw progressives doing this a lot with Biden clips during the primary season too.  This is an example of the media playing you.   They don't want you informed, they want you angry, because angry generates engagement and on social media engagement is profit.
I‚Äôve seen one press conference where Biden took scripted questions. Let‚Äôs not play just one side of the equation here.
Show us on the doll where Biden hurt God.  I have no interest in whatever you say about the ‚ÄúChina Virus.‚Äù  You‚Äôve already failed us.
Biden apparently thinks there‚Äôs only one black vote, because ‚Äòthose people‚Äô are all the same, unlike the gloriously diverse hispanic crowd.
Trump vs Biden Twitter war.
Combine this with the "you ain't black" if you don't vote for him and Joe Biden is looking pretty racist right now
West said ‚¨á   ‚ùå slavery was a choice &amp; Harriet Tubman didn't help slaves  ‚ùå he wears a MAGA hat and Confederate flag  ‚ùå he has a mental illness which seems to be inconsistently treated  These factors appeal more to Trump's base than Biden's
Right? I don't care if Biden picks a cactus!! Vote them all out!  And fill out your census! üòÄ2. And I‚Äôd still trust Biden on the issue, especially since Kamala Harris has an excellent record on protecting whistleblowers.
So if you REALLY think you're a better candidate than Joe Biden, then what's with all this corruption with the post office?  You are once again trying to destroy our democracy and it won't work.  Unlike you, Biden is a true leader.
Hey, there are some things that they did that I am not ok with. But compared to Trump, I‚Äôll gladly work to the bone for Biden. No question.
80 days till Biden. Just 80 days. It's keeping me sane. Who else is in countdown mode?
Exposed: Biden's Sister Made Millions From Joe's Campaigns Via Her Own Consulting Firm
#BidenHarrisLandslide2020 Just like Clinton was going to win by a landslide. America needs drastic changes and Biden said no drastic changes to his corporate masters. We deserve better.
So far all I‚Äôve heard you do is complain about Donald J Trump. The man saving American from career corrupt people like your buddy Joe Biden and your self.
Jason, Warren was actually my 2nd choice after Bernie, for President, but the POC spoke out and they wanted Biden. So buck up &amp; leave the sour grapes on the table. We  must support Biden/Harris to defeat the monster Trump! I will be joyful with Biden as president &amp; Harris as VP.
Is he freaking joking?  "Nothing will change",  "I will veto Medicare for all" now badly needs progressives?  Well this progressive does not need you:
I haven‚Äôt seen anything about President Trump playing golf since COVID 19 began Joe Biden and Kamala Harris day nothing but lies!!!
The Democrat version of free speech. It will completely disappear under Biden
Vote for Biden who doesn't want to be a DICTATOR!
Do the Democrats think the world is as gullible as they are? They would think the VP choice is the greatest even if Biden picked Minnie Mouse
Go in the basement with Biden where there is no internet please
When you revealed your true feelings about Joe Biden it brought tears to my eyes.  My question is, are you ignoring those feelings and memories in exchange for sycophancy, money, and power? I hope not.
#faceoftyranny #poserjoe  Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Call For Mask Mandates Nationwide To Prevent Coronavirus  via
They found a way to trash Trump and try to steal credit for Trump's success and cover their own FAILED policies. Biden and Obama despised Israel and supported Iran. Who are they kidding? Very little coverage from the left. But they had #poserpresbiden press conference.
Poser 'President' Biden told them to mandate mask wearing outside. It's not about your rights.
Biden is trying to take credit of this semi-non deal you refer to.
Dolly is the exception rather than the rule in the country music arena. She must have the same problems Biden has once you hit your 70s!
When I watched your press conference with Joe Biden I realized that Joe made a brilliant choice.  I was proud and excited that you and Joe will be representing me in November. I can hardly wait until our incompetent narcissistic president is thrown out of office.
Eric Trump: Don‚Äôt know why Harris will ‚Äòmagically become this unicorn to rejuvenate Biden‚Äô  via   This could have been said in less words: "Eric Trump doesn't know jack"
It is, and  says this for why they need to vote: It raises the sea level.  The less Biden loses by in any GOP stronghold, the less votes he needs to pull out of Democratic strongholds.  Or, the more he wins by and the more we repudiate Trumpism.
To all the Americans who have any doubts whether Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are up to the job, I implore you to watch this video.

"We are your vote black, brown, and white!" Biden/Harris, 2020
Unbelievable. Biden failed and now claims credit for Trump success.
Fuck Biden and Harris but we desperately need to win this
I think Trump would flip if all of a sudden Biden and Harris start leading the country, proposing and Congress start approving and passing things that can be passed without exec ordersüòÜ
Fuck Biden and Harris but we desperately need this. Vote, for God's sake vote.
Scott, civil public discussion is a thing of the past.  If you are a vocal Trump supporter, you are a Nazi.  If you are a vocal  Biden supporter, you want to ‚Äúgive away the country.‚Äù  There‚Äôs no discussion, just denigration.

Will anyone actually keep count?  Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
I agree. On day one Biden's gonna have all his picks ready to go!
I am already noticing lie-based attack ads against Biden and Harris.put out by your campaign.  One thing that is no lie is your abysmal performance as president.  Your influence is disappearing every day before our eyes, Donny.
It's amazing how the black people like Kamala Harris support the racist Joe Biden, she claimed he is, so strongly in the Democrats primaries.
I would trust most used car salespeople before Biden/Harris
That's Biden.
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... Seems like Harris and Biden.  But that's actually sad.
Harris will destroy this country if Biden wins. It is bad enough that incompetant Biden might win
Fox is getting hard for me to watch anymore. Too many MyPillow comercials and it makes me sick to watch so much of Biden and Harris
But your main premise is not true. Biden did not propose that we ban fracking.
Great to see Obama in this and not Biden. Biden is too demented to fight anyone lol
pro slavery, I realize I have to put all the bs asside and vote for the side that doesn't have someone trying to bring back slavery, because lets face it if Biden wins, his vp is the real president. Seriously please don't support her, don't support slavery.
Biden is a corrupt senile old man and Harris kept valuable information that would have proven without a doubt that a man was innocent, she was in favor of making marijuana illegal and laughed about jailing people even though she herself has smoked it, she-
See even if trump loses he wins because ppl despise him so much they will vote him out only to vote in a passive-aggressive form trump which is what joe Biden is
Some ppl don‚Äôt care all they see is black...look at the response from black celebs when Biden pick a ‚Äúblack women‚Äù as his VP they all loved it even tho she is the worst
I'm not afraid to say that Kamala Harris is a bitch.  She has her personal goals to achieve and nothing or nobody else matters for her. She doesn't care about Biden at all! She sniffs a chance for her! The left mob will love her. But this is not enough to help to win for Biden.
Trump completely screwed up a thriving economy Obama/Biden created. Trump had a guideline for battling any new virus and discarded it well in advance of the Trump Corona Virus.
Damn they found all 50 Biden supporters!
I don't think so  - do VP picks really mean that much to people? Not enough to sway anyone to vote or not vote for one of the two illustrious choices we have for POTUS. I would think if anything, Ms. Harris brings some respectability to the Biden ticket.
Be realistic, do you want trump? Because no one else but Biden stands a chance. And have you seen immigration nation? Those cages weren‚Äôt for children. The Obama administration wanted immigrants who were criminals out, not everyone who came here illegally. It‚Äôs trump or Biden.
And Biden promotes China.
Pelosi is an old person just like biden. Time for both to go out to pastures
Dream on, Don. Your actual opponent is Joe Biden. Pay attention.
It‚Äôs between trump and Biden and they both have allegations. But at least Biden doesn‚Äôt lock up children and separate them from their families
Next President of the United States Joe Biden and the next Vice President Kamala Harris.
She‚Äôs NOT black.  She bashed Biden, what changed.  Oh she maybe President!! Think twice!!
Great Biden gets the white house. We take everything else. Let's get all our friends to join direct groups. üòè
Idk if it's PBS or the DNC but whoever is doing the pre-speech music for this biden/harris ordeal is slaying.
This Kamala Harris, even in a deceased state, is a far better choice than the one Creepy Joe Biden chose.
Yeah in terms of environment Trump is honestly the worst, although with the Biden's mental decline, Kamala will be the real presidential candidate and with what she has done to people and her authoritarian ideals, I don't feel like she's better than Trump.
Although Biden is further to the right than Trump, so how is that going to help the left?
Would you REALLY be expressing those kinds of concerns if the VP were a man? You said "she's VP, not President. People were concerned that she is....blah blah blah....." Check your reality as it relates to having a woman capable of leading the country with Biden.
It says so much about our beautiful country that a major party ticket now includes a Black and South Asian American woman. Congratulations, Kamala #MVP
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with being able to be able get much more done with Biden and Harris. They are both far more to the right than Trump and have been shown to be far more authoritarian and a genuine threat to African Americans.
You know Donny, I found the extremely cruel words you spoke questioning Joe Biden's belief in God, offensive and something a Christian would never say.
Stop watching CNN progressives hate Kamala and Joe Biden. Wake up

Have you read -  Trevor Noah has thoughts on Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his running mate  #JoeBiden #TheDailyShow - your thoughts?
It's funny how hypocritical Trump is calling Joe Biden "sleepy Joe" when Mike Pence constantly  sleeps on the job, Kamala Harris is gonna make him her bitch in their debate.
If you look at the past 2-3 decades we are given George W, war criminal, then insane Palin, and now this turd.  It keeps getting worse.  I think that electing "Nothing will change" Biden will mean that in 4 years we brace ourselves for something even worse than Trump.
You have to look at the pattern here Rocky.  People like Biden, both Clintons, Kerry whose sole purpose in life is allowing corporatist to prevent populist on left to rise are the sole reason of the other party going to extreme right, fascism.  There is no counterbalance.
Newt Gingrich claims Biden's 'embrace' of China 'dictatorship' should shock Americans  #FoxNews
And Biden will refer to her as "the first mainstream(whatever ethnicityTrump chooses) who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking broad who is fun to sniff" No ill wishes to Biden, but I hope she takes over quick.

Democrats sounding Trump-Russia alarm ignore that China has 'purchased' Joe Biden, Glenn Beck says  #FoxNews
We have the human and industrial capital in the so-called "Rust Belt" to challenge - if not overtake! - China as the prime producer of renewable energy in the world. The Biden/Harris administration /must/ make that a key plank in its platform for the rest of this decade.
How does Joe Biden know that?!?! He doesn't even remember his own name... Stop making falsified claims you can't back up. #Trump2020 If you have even a single brain cell remaining you will vote for the RIGHT choice. Trump for another 4!!!
How many stones do you need?  Those without sin throw the first one.  REALLY!  Biden?  Evil will always prevail!
Good is evil and evil is good!! Crazy and people are blind.  I had a classmate say if he had Mickey Mouse running she would still vote for Biden.  So much Hate out there.  It‚Äôs a war between God and Satan.  If we know the end of the ‚ÄúBook‚Äù we know who wins. üòá
She doesn't remember much of Biden but very clear on Comey memories. These hearings have become such a joke. It's been 3 years!
You have mistaken this with the Democrats and the MSM.  They will do ANYTHING to win the elections. President Trump has behind him the silent majority.  Biden has behind him the violent, screaming minority.  That's the difference. President Trump will be reelected.
seriously, i really fucked with him heavy but then he let us all down by supporting biden
Having Biden and kamala harris on the democratic ticket is the biggest middle finger to progressive criminal and prison reform
I'm riding with Biden until the end.  Period.
I‚Äôm not sure if Biden will beat Trump, Kamala Harris is definitely a fucking cop, and Pence is going to get fucking WORKED during those debates with her. If he wasn‚Äôt such a ghoul I‚Äôd kinda feel bad for him but watching that bastard get dog walked is gonna rule.
Poor guy,  he doesn't know how to speak and he always sound like the first speech he ever gave.  I know Biden has his issues, but at least he's not self-centered like Trump is.
Who has confidence in Biden? He can't even remember Obama's name.
I mean with Kamala as VP, she is essentially the president due to Biden's mental deterioration. Considering she's pro slavery and anti pot, are you sure?
They will as long as Biden listens and obeys
Woman get shit done.   So so happy and hopeful.    Biden/Harris.   Yes.
biden &amp; harris?? i already wasn‚Äôt voting but that just makes it much easier lol
Can‚Äôt wait for  and  to play Harris and Biden on  in the coming months
You are going to try to paint her as  radical left but the Democratic ticket of Biden and Harris is clear indication that the party has rejected it, so good luck with that.
Joe Biden didn't fight for anybody but himself and family.

Biden just sealed his fate.  Duckworth would have been a way better choice than Harris IMHO.

Biden is handing Trump the election. The Democratic Party should be sick for letting these two be the ones running
Let's get our 2020 election on, folks! Biden Harris for the win!
It is great for the President, but horrible for Joe Biden.  Kamala Harris is very unlikable, vicious person.
There is no better Democrat to be manipulated than Joe Biden! That's why he is the ideal candidate for the left mob who wants the revolution (read: pathological destruction of the Country). Joe Biden is just a puppet for the left mob and MSM (the same).
If Biden selects Kamala Harris he will be toast. Very vulnerable VP pick
Have you heard the guy that predicted the winner for president since 1984 correctly even Trump in 2016 said Biden will win in 2020. God save us!
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... That's the normal mistakes all the people make sometimes.  Biden is totally lost and he needs to be guided by his staff (the left mob) all the time.  Huge difference!
I love how the Biden campaign view the VP selection as the ‚Äúleast risky‚Äù and not helpful or advantageous
DC Swamp Lizards. They have sold out and probably promised much money if Biden gets in. DemocRATS in Republican clothing.
They are not much a friends of the USA so is Joe Biden! #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica

Your father was a great comedian, but also an outstanding actor. He is missed. Political figures are pubic figures. His piece on Biden, like other politicians in his act are fair game. It was also hilarious. Let‚Äôs just leave it at that and not make it political.
So, Biden (in the reality the left mob who wants to govern) is more pro life than Trump??? That question is not even a subject to discussion. It's obvious.  #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver  Without any doubt!

Joe Biden is dumber than a bag of doughnuts how do you guys not see it. He can‚Äôt even talk properly.. flubs his words all the time and loses my interest immediately
People are brainwashed to think nothing can be worse than trump. Even if trump is as bad as some people think, Biden is inherently worse.Biden ain‚Äôt winning. And if you look at the body cam video, no way was that murder. Involuntary manslaughter, but not murder. Did he have enough fentanyl in his system to kill him? Could that have been the reason he said he couldn‚Äôt breathe?

I will say that. That is something I like about Trump. He may not always make the right decisions, but he sticks to what he believes. He is not easily manipulated. To be quite honest, if Biden wins, I think it will be Kamala running the show. I would rather someone who knows

Now do Sniffing Joe Biden...
Biden isn‚Äôt even glancing at #m4a and these are the headlines.   The DNC is kneecapping themselves again. Choosing a milk-toast centrist to appease the right, who will slam him as a far-left radical until November.   Brace for 4 more years of Trump.
Her own party treats her like shit because the DNC and old-school dems are just as deep in the pockets of the lobbies as the GOP. Which is why they‚Äôre trying to shove Biden down our throats.

If you think joe Biden getting a hold of an executive office is gonna lead to a Marxist revolution I‚Äôm really sorry. Nothing will change, Democrats don‚Äôt want it to.

You need to pressure the Biden campaign to appeal to the center and left. It‚Äôs on you if he doesn‚Äôt like Hillary didn‚Äôt. Biden will give us Trump again because of his refusal to unite the party.
Hillary &amp; Kerry said the same thing instead of trying to unite the party. That turned out great for their campaigns. If Biden was that worried he‚Äôd make serious policy concessions, like at least 1 of the lefts platform policy‚Äôs into his campaign.
Does this mean those "scared housewives" will be more likely to vote Biden/Harris ???
Uh............DUH!!!  That's why we're voting for Biden!!  #BlueTsunami
It‚Äôs on Biden to win the left. I have a third option of not voting or Howie Hawkins. Biden‚Äôs repeating the Hillary 16 campaign and isn‚Äôt going to even offer policy to the left to unite with him.

Racist PoS Donald Trump has less idea about what policies Joe Biden will or will not implement than he does about what colors human skin can achieve naturally.....

Im from Illinois so my vote won‚Äôt make much of a difference. Illinois will go more than 60% for Biden. Biden has played the popular side of politics.  He was against bussing until it was popular. Biden was Obama‚Äôs vice to appease the white southern voters.

Again her entire record is testimony to her being a conservative. I‚Äôm not even sure why you‚Äôre not embracing that. Biden‚Äôs trying to love the party to pack right leaning voters. Harris will distance him from the idea he picked a progressive, leftist, communist.

Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris, the prominent senator from California whose political career has included many barrier-breaking moments, as his running mate, his campaign announced on Tuesday.#KamalaHarrisForVP #montysaiyed
Pretty much sums it up. The Biden campaign adopting the Hillary 2016 campaign of rejecting party unity with the VP pick. Such a shame. Biden and the conservatives just handed Trump the 2020 election.
A total waste. Why did the Biden campaign reject party unity? This is a repeat of Hillary picking Tim Kaine in 2016.

If Biden picks a woman and if trump wants to save his daughter for his 3rd term as president, he could pick Sarah Palin to be his VP pick
Trump claims "some say" that men are offended by Biden choosing a woman as his VP.  It's true, what we need is more men in politics.  "Some say" our president is out of his damn mind.
Well we can't compare Biden's VP campaign pick to trump's VP because Sarah Palin is so much smarter than him
I'm sure trump had his speech writers make up a whole assortment of new nasty nicknames for each possible pick to be Biden's VP
I have a feeling that Barr will charge, indite and arrest Obama, Biden, Rice and others on trumped-up charges as an October surprise. What are your thoughts?

Russia, same as the Chinese Communist Party, supports Biden. Between that and mail fraud, you people are looking at some massively serious jail time. And I thought you HATED orange!
Just think. We're days away from somebody superimposing Biden's running mate in the WAP video.  Please, quit while you're ahead.
Should we look critically at the choices and their records? Of course. We should hold them to a high standard (something Biden is aware of I'm sure). But I see a lot of preemptive what feels like character assassination from the left as well as the right.
He called her a nasty woman. He said she should be in jail. They insinuated she was a pedophile. We are not prepared for the kinds of attacks that will be endured by Biden's running mate.
Time for a hot take:  If (god forbid) Biden loses, it won't be bc of his running mate.  Each contender has their pros and cons but let's be honest, she won't be in an enviable position. She'll face an onslaught of sexist criticism unseen before in American electoral politics.
You're comparing that history lesson with Biden or Bush W. ?

#makebidenbetter  needs to understand that in order to win he needs to create a clear platform and push progressive ideas. Medicare-for-all, UBI, green new deal, and decriminalizing marijuana to name a few. Let‚Äôs push Biden left
I would even bet that Biden prayed for the IMPOTUS as well.

That makes no sense. Biden is a baby killer plain and simple.If the Trump presidency has shown us anything, it's that you cannot hold a president accountable. They will dodge responsibility. Why do we pretend it will be any different with Biden?
Not being shut out. Biden is pretty clear where he stands. Your boss, Comrade Donnie is all over the charts.
I'm boating for Biden.  Fuck Trump.
So Biden should do whatever Trump does? Please go back to Fox....
Those Obama appointees wanted to privatize the post office so of course Bernie Sanders voted against them. Stop spreading falsehoods and Bernie bashing. He supports Joe Biden. This is why I never watch MSNBC. I'm sick of the anti-Bernie crap. Stop being divisive.
Wouldn‚Äôt have said a fucking word if they endorsed Biden.
May I remind you if Joe Biden wins Kamala will be VP and kept where she belongs, quietly standing behind Joe Biden.   The HarrisBiden2020 in your profile is disgusting and disrespectful and quite frankly gross. Joe Biden will be the president NEVER Kamala. #AOC2020
Police unions endorse candidates all the time. If they endorsed Biden you sure as fuck wouldn't be saying stupid sgit like this.
I know the birther crap is crap, but Kamala Harris is not a queen. Most DEMs especially young progressive ones can't stand her politics.  I'm having a hard time voting for Biden because of her Wall Street connections &amp; minority prosecuting record. Her flip-flops are intolerable.
Joe Biden is a good and decent man &amp; has many other qualities needed in a POTUS. trump is everything we never want to see again in a POTUS.
I thought ‚Äúheld accountable‚Äù is a better term for Biden procecuting Trump
This ad was ran by a Trump Super PAC. I lost my job from an economic disaster and Biden is the real threat???!? Get the fuck outta here lol
Uhmmmm no Kanye. Joe Biden should not be take seriously and claud Anderson probably taking financial advice from Trump
This still does not solve the fact some states do not count the absentee ballots until the next day and allow votes to trickle in.  If he goes to bed thinking he won bc fox tells him he did, yet the actaul vote is Biden due to absentee, he will not accept it. YOU KNOW THIS.
honestly i just think biden andvtrump are crazy
Vote Biden. Any other option (including not voting) is as good as voting for Trump.

Kamala Harris was selected by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to serve as his running mate.

TECHNICALLY Biden opposed Reagan's nom of Robert Bork, but yes he's supported virtually every other conservative appointment. A real sAvIoR to us all.
Biden helped usher in the conservative Supreme Court majority. Anyone vote shaming "to prevent a 7-2 Republican swing" is going to be in for a rude awakening.

If Joe Biden doesn't speak out against Palestinians having their lands stolen from them by Israel and UAE, then Progressives will NEVER vote for him.  We believe Palestine has a right to exist and decide it's own fate there should be no peace and no negotiations without them.
We are fucked Democracy stolen from us with Trump and we are doomed to poverty, starvation, high medical costs and low pay with Biden.   I can't see how any of this is good. Best option,   Move to Europe, Canada, or New Zealand. I'm already looking of ways to move to NZ.
So is the left wing going to sit it out or write-in Bernie or Warren just to ensure Biden Harris don‚Äôt win and prove a point?  Progressives stand a better chance in 2024 then if tRump is re-elected bcz more rt-wing policies / judges will be in place.  Better to work with Dem
Crickets from the left...they have no idea what Biden will do because he won‚Äôt do anything to make the country better. Maybe he and Harris will improve on the crime bill he championed back in the 90s and jail even more POC. #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
It's not like you made some great assumption or inferred something. The words came straight from Biden's mouth. He is not being unclear about his intentions.
But they have no problem using his Twitter account to attack Biden and Harris.
Nobody is melting down just exposing the Stupidity of Joe Biden on his selection.!!!!!

Hide ya kids, Joe Biden is raping everyone up in here
My take:  biden says:  no debate neccessary, we‚Äôve seen what you have done.
Harris talking about Biden's deceased son is kinda hard to watch
Joe Biden's VP pick of Kamala Harris is all about Obama's legacy &amp; less about beating Trump. What it ignores, Harris is not liked by young black voters &amp; MOST Latino voters.    Why is this an issue? Latinos are the largest minority voting group in America.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.

You aren't the base. You were never the base. You're a shit stirring interloper who works for losers.  You have a choice in November. Trump or Biden. If you can't figure that out then as far as I'm concerned you're fully behind Trump and are an enemy to progressives everywhere.
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
You're acting like you were the only one that has a lot to lose if Trump becomes president.   The only reason I live is for my Trans daughter and get Social Security. Biden and Trump will ruin our lives.  I have to make a stand somewhere I hate Trump and I hate the Dem Party.
someone came less than 24 hours after they announced the vp and wanted a biden harris sign   i love the enthusiasm
I agree.  VP Biden does not need the debates.   Demand he released his taxes,  an on site fact checker,  &amp; if he interrupts,  he loses his response time.
Exactly my sentiment! Besides‚Äîwith the clusterfu tRUmp will be leaving‚Äî- They‚Äôre going to need a BIG crew!! Jobs for everyone in the Biden/Harris administration!üòâüåäüíôüåäüíô‚òÆÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è

It should be clear to all that this country is beyond repair and will need to be rebuilt from the ashes.. A Biden presidency is simply delaying the inevitable.. I know that‚Äôs a tough pill to swallow.. but hey.
So fucking what if Trump wins again.   I am dead if Biden wins and I'll be dead if Trump wins. After five damn years fighting inside the Dem Party and on Twitter, I AM OVER CARING!   I DON'T FOCKING CARE ABOUT POLITICS.
You should be in that Biden spot.  You should be our next President, but I guess I will just have to look forward to 2028.
Stop saying she's progressive. Hillary tried to pull that shit and we destroyed her argument and exposed her for the filthy Neolib she is. Kamala is a Hillary clone and is as neoliberal as they come. Joe Biden is worse. He is a Conservative Dem. Progressives are Dem Socialists.

Chairman Allen West's Statement on Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's Running Mate - Republican Party of Texas
I am not French. BIDEN IS GOING DOWN. Biden said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the 1st African American who is articulate bright and clean.‚Äù Referring to OBAMA. Biden &amp; Obama are CRIMINALS having spied on Trump b4 &amp; after he took office. Corruption SO deep they‚Äôre drowning in it.
Don't tell me I'm being a dick after you say I'm being dense. If you can accept Biden for as flawed and awful a candidate as he is then you shouldn't have any issues with Kamala.
I would like to believe he is smiling down at Biden/Harris.

WRONG. Trump turned anybody with a respectable bone in their body Biden voters. Harris is a very moderate person. She is a former AG that is respectable. Trump can't compete. Keep spreading your LIES and FAKE NEWS. Nobody believes you.
She is a former AG that served real law &amp; order. She doesn't spend her time wasting away bitching and moaning on twitter. Good for her. Biden/Harris 2020
Biden/Harris over here serving that election erection.
I don‚Äôt think they gain any votes on the ticket with this move The kids that hear ‚Äúfree college‚Äù were already going to vote for Biden, and this move doesn‚Äôt do anything to gain the middle aged that actually understand what it takes to give free college, and Kamala doesn‚Äôt do that
Obama / Biden were in office for 8 years, and your organization continued to make it possible for disturbed teen-agers and abusive men to get guns and shoot innocent people.
I was a super fan of your Facebook page. A way for me to stay in touch with the news in my state‚Äôs capital.  Your followers‚Äô outright racist, sexist comments to the news of Kamala Harris being named as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate is a disgrace. Moderate your page.
Biden choosing Kamala for VP means two things: 1. He‚Äôs targeting the woman vote b/c he knows the rape allegations against him will soon come to fruition.  2. He‚Äôs targeting minority vote because he‚Äôs a liberal &amp; CAREER liberals take marginalized communities &amp; further marginalize.

Didn‚Äôt  call Biden a racist and say she believes his rape accusers??? Interesting choice
Senator Kamala Harris is Joe Biden‚Äôs VP nominee. Let‚Äôs get to work!

Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
UPDATE: Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Biden/Harris... lets gooooooooo
Joe Biden's Vice President will be Kamala Harris not Susan Rice. Here's how I responded.
Democrats close to the campaign say an announcement is imminent, and could come as early as Tuesday.
Monday: Biden is not Trump Tuesday: Biden is not Trump Wednesday: Biden is not Trump Thursday: Joe Biden is not Trump, oh, I'm Joe Biden, ice cream   "Best convention ever"
It is NOT The vice presidential nominee will be speaking right before Barack Obama. Who has the best relationship with Barack Obama and Joe Biden because she worked with them in the Obama White House, Susan Rice.
Val is not a person friend of Obama and Biden's Rice is. She was always a top two pick.
Wrong! They would never leave Susan Rice off. She is a HUGE friend of Obama and Biden. This is the schedule and Rice is the VP.
If Kamala Harris was a VP she would not be speaking twice. I don't see Susan Rice there.   It's obvious she's Biden's pick. Sorry KHive your Queen will never be VP or President
OVER MY DEAD BODY!   I'm only voting for Biden to get rid of Trump.  Biden and his VP will be defeated by a progressive in 2024. Biden better focking not all of a sudden be declared incompetent in middle of his term. If he is, they knew about it before and it was a cover up.
How about we say we disagree with her policies and would never vote for her or Biden if it wasn't for the fact Trump is so dangerous.
He's covering for her. She'll be mad if he doesn't pick her and KHive will be Swarming and ready to mass sting anyone who comments that Biden made the right choice not picking her.
Are you insane? They are the only reason I'm still on Twitter. Silence them and I won't vote for Joe Biden.
Laughable... how convenient to say that when Biden has lost his marbles
Pandering is Biden‚Äôs mantra...
Joe Biden's campaign seems to be going well
Go riden with Biden!
Donald Fucking Trump, I will be glad when you are dead and gone! You are a worthless piece of shit! Joe Biden is going to kick your worthless ass!!!!  You are a sorry excuse for a human being!!!!!   When you die I will piss on your grave, maybe shit on your tombstoneüòÇüòÖü§£üï∑‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ

Yes he needs help not social media posts calling him a con man. Just another reason why I can't stand resistors.  Just a bunch of freaking Biden bullies.
Trump obviously doesn't want to get elected. He just garrenteed that Biden will win. My Social Security benefits in eight years mean everything to me and I'm Ready to fight a Civil War to keep it and have it increased.
Don't use voter shaming on me.  I don't believe in 3rd parties in GE. I would never criticize your right to vote 4 them.  Who said I was voting for Trump or Biden? It is perfectly acceptable to refuse to vote for either of them. In Iowa u can mark on ballot a no vote for POTUS.
I vote the way I want, you vote yours. I either vote for Biden, Trump or refuse to pick and log a no vote for President. Option 3 is a protest vote.  I don't support 3rd party runs for President. Nothing or no one can EVER make me do that.
It‚Äôs insane that Biden‚Äôs bike ride excited me. The simplicity of every second of it spoke volumes.
Harris is using the opposition research she gathered. She is a very evil woman. I will never vote for Biden if he picks her. I don't like eat-mongering Susan Rice, but she's better than Kamala.   Karen Bass is the best and safest choice.
Thats why I said alone, sadly. We are not getting a much more selfless candidate like a Bernie, and we may never in this country. But I will take Biden over that orange slime any day.
And did you also see that Instagram, owned by FB, was suppressing suppressing negative Trump hashtags but not Biden ones. None of it is accidental.
Rates have nothing to do with the ACA. Republicans refuse to cap premiums.   Trump cannot get rid of the ACA and then Rename it as Trumpcare. He is such a total insecure loser.  FYI - I'm not a fan of Barack Obama, Joe Biden or any Repub or Dem. I don't like either party.
Joe Biden should pick Lori Lightfoot as his VP so she can just yell at us and shame us into making better decisions.

Yes I agree, but how can we convince people to get out and vote? Russia is working on tRump‚Äôs behalf by denigrating Biden and sowing seeds of doubt about the election.
It will be Susan Rice who has a really good working relationship with Joe. Kamala Harris attacked Biden. She's too ambitious And will try to overshadow Joe, which won't be hard. Harris would be willing declare Joe incompetent just to be president. #NeverKamala
When Joe Biden loses in a landside and the Black vote for Trump is 90%, I wonder what their excuse will be
Joe Biden is the obvious presidential candidate to lead our country!!!!!
I don‚Äôt have a problem with honest criticism, but so much of the attacks on Biden seem utterly contrived and propagandistic.
just because biden says he will DOESNT MEAN HE'LL DO ITThe repub. senate refuse any money for more testing and tracking, and then they supposedly compromise and say they will allow some for more testing. Some 7 months into this crisis and how many since Biden's letter explaining the things that need to be done and still no tracking
Hell yes!!!!
Amazing that they can be so tight-fisted about anything that doesn‚Äôt enrich themselves personally.  We can expect a never ending cry about the national debt when President Biden is sworn in.
If I can ask a question without politics as an American , Do you believe the country will be better in the next 4 yrs with Trump instead of Biden?? Who will positively impact the most Americans?

Yeah, it's not. And believe me, I am not a big Biden fan. But I'm like understand you will not be able to achieve any reform under a second Trump term. Understand healthcare and abortion is on the chopping block. Criminal justice? He'll throw us all in jail.

The GOP will become very concerned about this when Joe Biden is inaugurated.
It will also feel good when you are sworn in as part of the Biden administration.
As usual, think how the GOP would react if Biden (or any other Dem) stood up a fake campaign for a GOP candidate!  They would raise holy hell and impeach everyone. But it's okay for Jared to run this stupid operation, which he'll botch anyway.

Kind of want to have an election night party.   "For Kamala we have Jamaican jerk chicken and Indian tikka masala. And for Biden, to represent Delaware we have...um...scrapple?"
Okay, but I'm excited to see who Biden picks for his Cabinet!

Trump: names a member of the Amway family as secretary of education  Biden: picks a VP who let Herbalife off the hook  Anyone wanna do a video with me about major politicians siding with MLMs??
I think a lot the problem with politics is Republicans think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the radical left, and the actual left thinks Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are Republicans.
Actually, Bill, that choice for VP actually hurts Biden and the Democrats. This is a woman who called Biden a sexist and racist and now they‚Äôre supposed to run together? Seriously? Do you think Harris is ready to run the country? I don‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs what will happen.
biden and obama expanded ice to the problem that it is today. biden and harris will expand policing. all we have representation for here is more systemic racism and control of capital by the wealthy elite. that's not my kinda leadership or representation, it's just more fascism

During the largest BLM movement and amid global riots and protests that haven't stopped for 3 MONTHS... Biden picks a cop for VP. Man Dems can fuck allllllllllll the way off

Just think. We're days away from somebody superimposing Biden's running mate in the WAP video.  Please, quit while you're ahead.
Should we look critically at the choices and their records? Of course. We should hold them to a high standard (something Biden is aware of I'm sure). But I see a lot of preemptive what feels like character assassination from the left as well as the right.
He called her a nasty woman. He said she should be in jail. They insinuated she was a pedophile. We are not prepared for the kinds of attacks that will be endured by Biden's running mate.
Time for a hot take:  If (god forbid) Biden loses, it won't be bc of his running mate.  Each contender has their pros and cons but let's be honest, she won't be in an enviable position. She'll face an onslaught of sexist criticism unseen before in American electoral politics.

No vote for Trump is a vote for Biden!
Again her entire record is testimony to her being a conservative. I‚Äôm not even sure why you‚Äôre not embracing that. Biden‚Äôs trying to love the party to pack right leaning voters. Harris will distance him from the idea he picked a progressive, leftist, communist.
You have mistaken this with the Democrats and the MSM.  They will do ANYTHING to win the elections. President Trump has behind him the silent majority.  Biden has behind him the violent, screaming minority.  That's the difference. President Trump will be reelected.

Hunter Biden has a law degree from the best law school in the US. He then became a successful banker, before George HW Bush appointed him head of Amtrak. In other words, he knew international finance as well as governmental relations. A perfect background for Burisma.

I‚Äôm not 100% sure, but I believe there are rules as to how early a candidate can reveal their VP  choice. It has more to do with ‚Äúthere‚Äôs only one president at a time‚Äù frame of mind. Also why Biden can‚Äôt reveal his cabinet choices.

I don't think so  - do VP picks really mean that much to people? Not enough to sway anyone to vote or not vote for one of the two illustrious choices we have for POTUS. I would think if anything, Ms. Harris brings some respectability to the Biden ticket.
Be realistic, do you want trump? Because no one else but Biden stands a chance. And have you seen immigration nation? Those cages weren‚Äôt for children. The Obama administration wanted immigrants who were criminals out, not everyone who came here illegally. It‚Äôs trump or Biden.

I don't understand why this message is targeting me, I want the person to vote no matter what. However, I personally hate the pressure messaging of "vote Biden or else", even though I personally believe it myself. You're just going to turn away potential voters talking like that.
You need to pressure the Biden campaign to appeal to the center and left. It‚Äôs on you if he doesn‚Äôt like Hillary didn‚Äôt. Biden will give us Trump again because of his refusal to unite the party.
Hillary &amp; Kerry said the same thing instead of trying to unite the party. That turned out great for their campaigns. If Biden was that worried he‚Äôd make serious policy concessions, like at least 1 of the lefts platform policy‚Äôs into his campaign.

Yeah in terms of environment Trump is honestly the worst, although with the Biden's mental decline, Kamala will be the real presidential candidate and with what she has done to people and her authoritarian ideals, I don't feel like she's better than Trump.
Although Biden is further to the right than Trump, so how is that going to help the left?
It says so much about our beautiful country that a major party ticket now includes a Black and South Asian American woman. Congratulations, Kamala #MVP
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with being able to be able get much more done with Biden and Harris. They are both far more to the right than Trump and have been shown to be far more authoritarian and a genuine threat to African Americans.

Im from Illinois so my vote won‚Äôt make much of a difference. Illinois will go more than 60% for Biden. Biden has played the popular side of politics.  He was against bussing until it was popular. Biden was Obama‚Äôs vice to appease the white southern voters.
Oh FFS, can we at least agree that the liklihood of Biden/Harris continuing to dismantle the post office, ignore experts on disease, collude to make Russia a super power again, and continue to try to take away health care is minimal? Comparatively?

Again her entire record is testimony to her being a conservative. I‚Äôm not even sure why you‚Äôre not embracing that. Biden‚Äôs trying to love the party to pack right leaning voters. Harris will distance him from the idea he picked a progressive, leftist, communist.
You have mistaken this with the Democrats and the MSM.  They will do ANYTHING to win the elections. President Trump has behind him the silent majority.  Biden has behind him the violent, screaming minority.  That's the difference. President Trump will be reelected.

Obama and Biden left a pandemic plan behind in case something happened, which was then ignored when a pandemic happened. ACA isn't really to blame for this.

I've been saying ever since it was clear that Bernie was probably gonna lose that I would vote for Biden just because he'll at least be capable of listening to criticism and will fill his administration with experts.  We gotta just pour on the pressure even harder if Biden wins.
Nah, that's a bad take. If you're not feeling Biden then you don't HAVE to vote Biden. Heck, even Biden has said the same thing when talking about the Tara Reade allegations.   You're just alienating people who are on the fence if you say they HAVE to vote Biden.
That's fair. I generally only really push people to really consider voting Biden if they're in battleground states, since their vote might actually make a direct impact on the results.  I want 3rd parties to be a viable option but we gotta get election reform first sadly.
He did not say that he would veto M4A, here is the direct quote of his response to the question of if he'd veto M4A.  "I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now."
Seriously fuck this country. It's bad enough Trump is president but the  couldnt possibly pick THE ONE PERSON THAT WOULD BEAT HIM.. so we get stuck with fucking Joe Biden and now fucking Kamila "Cop" Harris as his VP in the height of BLM  Are you fucking kidding me
Not a fan of her, but then, I am not fan of Biden. That being said, I am voting Blue, no matter what. The stakes are way too high.
She represents a total rejection of party unity by the Biden campaign.
A sign that the Biden campaign rejected party unity
Biden has nothing to do with either 160k+ dead or the recession, and Kamala's healthcare plan would've covered everyone and forced private healthcare to follow stricter regulation.
Of course he did, it's Trump. The man is maximum pettiness personified.  I'd vote for a moldy lemon and stale bread before I voted for Trump, and Biden/Harris at least have some real interesting history and a lot of progressive policy writers pushing the campaign along.
Kanaka Harris was a very poor choice for a Vice President.Her time as a prosecutor proved she is someone that does what is popular instead of what‚Äôs right. Elizabeth Warren and Susan Rice were much better choices. Trump is not going to get my vote but neither will Biden.
LMFAO Joe Biden really picked the woman who accused him of being racist?  Who locked up more black people than anyone in the state of California that rivaled Jim Crow states?  Should've been without doubt that Trump would be ousted this election. Yet the Democrats are bottling it
She‚Äôs represents the Biden campaign rejecting party unity. A repeat of the Hillary 2016 campaign.
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris, the prominent senator from California whose political career has included many barrier-breaking moments, as his running mate, his campaign announced on Tuesday.#KamalaHarrisForVP #montysaiyed
Pretty much sums it up. The Biden campaign adopting the Hillary 2016 campaign of rejecting party unity with the VP pick. Such a shame. Biden and the conservatives just handed Trump the 2020 election.
A total waste. Why did the Biden campaign reject party unity? This is a repeat of Hillary picking Tim Kaine in 2016.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP nominee
A total rejection of party unity by thr Biden campaign. This is a repeat of 2016.
Warren would've been my vote in the primary had the writing not already been on the wall that she was not going to be competitive enough in the primary, so I shifted to Bernie.  If it makes you feel any better, Warren has been a *major* policy adviser for Biden in recent months.
Biden is repeating the Hillary 2016 campaign when the candidate Hillary rejected party unity by picking a life long conservative Tim Kaine.
Didn‚Äôt kamala trash Biden in the debates?
Yay! And the next president after Biden.
I don't know who he could've picked that would've pulled in more progressive and younger voters. Elizabeth Warren is amazing, but people didn't show up for her, and she's just as old as Biden is.
Biden is handing Trump the election. The Democratic Party should be sick for letting these two be the ones running
Let's get our 2020 election on, folks! Biden Harris for the win!
Biden not my 1st Choice for President. Harris not my 1st choice for VP. But I trust both to fight for ALL people and to bring much needed change in regards to many facets of American life. Time to step up and make it America the Beautiful again!! #BidenHarris2020
Kamala Harris was honestly probably my top pick for VP (her, Warren, and Susan Rice top 3), she'll be a great choice, assuming that Biden continues to work with Sanders and Warren with his policies.
She's not really polarizing, and especially neither her nor Biden are as divisive as Trump. That's a false equivalence. Listening to Harris interrogate someone is the most exciting thing out there, she's a great speaker.
It is great for the President, but horrible for Joe Biden.  Kamala Harris is very unlikable, vicious person.

So, Biden (in the reality the left mob who wants to govern) is more pro life than Trump??? That question is not even a subject to discussion. It's obvious.  #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver  Without any doubt!
Trump says that Biden hurts the Bible, hates the Church, and hurts. GOD! Really this the first I‚Äôd heard that a human being could actually hurt the Lord!
He could pay me what ever he wants. I‚Äôll take the money and still vote for Biden

I know my son who lost his job appreciates the $400.  We can fund social security by getting rid of some of the washington wreckless spending.  But hey,  if Biden‚Äôs elected, no worries.  He‚Äôs raising taxes $3 TRILLION.
Imo if Biden wins we might as well all buy some lube now for when we bend over and get ass fucked
Said this from get go. This is a way THEY'VE came up with to take votes from Biden.. One CRAZY west to another KRAZY TRUMP. Not that hard to see THROUGH. ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IK2gPyltsw
The GOP let him get away with everything else...  Hope they remember if they don‚Äôt call out trump, Biden can do it too!!
Lies..attacks on Dems &amp; Biden, he‚Äôs the only one who can solve the economic issues...then stormed off when  called him out on a lie that he got Veterans Choice passed - and he ends the ‚Äúnews conference‚Äù like a petulant child.What Democrats have going for them is an incomparable group of grassroots organizers who have boundless energy and that will work tirelessly to help elect Joe Biden. Case in point:
To be able to represent the Asian American population and younger generation as the youngest Joe Biden delegate in IL has been a privilege.   With the DNC Convention being this week, I can‚Äôt wait to see the diversity of our party unite to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
MEDIA: "How many nasty digs at President Trump can we put in his brother's obituary?"  Meanwhile, Biden-Harris supporters: "Let's get #wrongtrump trending."  You all deserve each other.
Debate my ass! You went after Biden with everything u had, u were not debating him. U were attacking him! U wanted to show his every racist side!
DAILY REMINDER: BIDEN IS THE REAL RACIST
Dodged a hell of a bullet when Biden didn‚Äôt pick her.
Because Dems feel by choosing her..they have the African American woman vote locked. How can anyone any color but especially African American identify with or want to vote for Biden? He says..."You're not black if you don't vote for me" ummm racist much? BLM the "organization"
It would be a mistake of historically epic proportions for Biden to avoid debating Trump.  Nearly the only card Trump has left is: "see-Biden-really-is-brain-dead." If Biden avoids debates, that becomes a totally reasonable inference.
Lmao there‚Äôs a house decorated in Biden‚Äôs face throughout the house and Biden supporters don‚Äôt wanna admit that they worship him. replace ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù with ‚Äútrump‚Äù and that should be enough proof that trumpies worship the fat orange&lt;3

False victim mentality..do some research on the actual BLM organization. Funded by the Democratic party. Biden didn't want Harris as his running mate, he wanted a white man who was more qualified actually. But Biden, just like Obama..is a race baiter. He ONLY chose her because
It also allows for more ideas to get seriously considered. The way it stands now, I have to vote Biden. He‚Äôs the closest candidate for me. We just need to keep demanding more once he‚Äôs in office. At least there is a chance of that with him. I don‚Äôt see us surviving Trump again
Nah. That‚Äôs some sh!t bitter Sanders supporters made up to make themselves feel better about not getting out to vote for him. The candidates who dropped out, did so bec. they knew they didn‚Äôt have a chance. They rallied around Biden bec. The goal is beating trump.
Join the Trump train  It will only get worse under biden trust me socialism and communism does not work!!!  Idk if you know but yesterday  endorsed #Trump2020! We need to #DrainTheSwamp it‚Äôs still kicking back!

Ironically,Biden is the racist. PLENTY of evidence over the years. A LOT! Democrats are a hypocritical joke.
Well, kinda hard when Biden was not taking any questions from reporters.
That can't be true. Tim Walz was already demanding justice less than 24 hours later. Same with Joe Biden.
And like I said, I consider myself to be moderate. Not left or right. I don‚Äôt like Biden or trump. It says more about you than it does me that you degrade me for asking completely reasonable and logical questions. Again, who is the sheep. Why do you ‚Äúcritical thinkers‚Äù question
Can you point me to facts about Kamala giving BJs to get promoted? I don't like Biden or Kamala, but I dislike Trump more than both of them. But this BJ thing sounds like something Trump might have mumbled. There's no way this can be proven, yet it's one of your argue points?

I'm a republican,  sad to say, at this point,  I am voting for Biden, at this point there is nothing,  and I mean nothing the Democrats can throw at us that Trump has'nt already thrown.
I think Biden should have an essentially canned script ready if Trump starts roaming. I'll leave the words to experts, but I would say:  What exactly are you doing, Don? Stay in your lane. If you want people to respect you, you have to respect them. And no one respects you.
Hmm. I just noticed that you are beautiful. Well, maybe I‚Äôll vote for Biden after all. I‚Äôm easily influenced. Yes, we will see in November. I just hope that there‚Äôs no (legitimate) dispute over the results. That‚Äôs the last thing we need.
In fact it‚Äôs stunning how shameless the Biden campaign was about it‚Äôs tokenistic criteria for VP.
It'll catch up with him &amp; once Biden is sworn in, that hit Trump with charges, then Pence can't pardon him &amp; Biden won't.
He is bad and has a record of horrific fuck ups, dude. Biden is garbage but under Trump‚Äôs America, we are collapsing.

Right again!  Biden needs to answer the questions. He is showing his weakness, and i hope it hurts him November 3rd
I vividly remember a Biden moment from 2016. It was Biden speaking extemporaneously during the doomed Hillary campaign and just ripping Trump. Ripping him. (On mortgages or something.)  I wish I could find it and send it to  Because that's the Biden I want to see.
I see no way Biden wastes political capital doing that. See Jimmy Carter
I will drive my Biden vote to Washington DC if I had to
I read something today in the big Biden Politico story, so it was a quote from an in-the-know person. I paraphrase:  "Never underestimate the ability of Joe Biden to royally fuck up."  As I say, I am petrified.

The CCP is the reason so many people died. That was Hunter Biden‚Äôs employer until a few months ago.
That's where you are wrong and it will be the biggest miscalculation of the Century for the Democratic Party. Blacks don't come out to vote AGAINST someone, just FOR someone. And they are not excited about Biden-Harris. They won't go out JUST to defeat Trump. lol
If "Judge" Joe Brown supported Biden no one would give a fuck, but if he appears hypercritical of Biden he gets a ton of traction on here. It‚Äôs pretty open &amp; shut.

I‚Äôll bet Biden next to go in death pool. Vegas has it at -220 lol.
It‚Äôs not going to be Biden/Harris on the ticket.  The Dems have another plan, later.
If the DNC and Biden/Harris want to really drive him insane, they should invite Obama to speak each time Trump speaks. Then watch the media drop Trump and go to Breaking News: Obama Is Speaking to the Nation!!
You falsely claim without evidence that something is wrong with Biden, but you‚Äôre not concerned about an individual capable of this soliloquy?

As soon as he speaks, the polls will go up for Trump. Biden has a history of saying the wrong thing.
I remember the day John McCain died. I had him confused w Joe Biden the whole time
Hillary was the subject of a smear campaign that went on for years. Biden does not have that problem. Biden wisely chose a person of color for his running mate. This excites the Democratic base in a way that Tim Kaine could not. Our turnout will be better this time.
Biden has a longer history of lying.

How many questions has Biden taken these past few days? Um! Um! Come on man! You know the thing.
True. However, they are corporatists just like the Republicans. Biden pisses on progressives.
The BS has already started. We need to concentrate on beating Trump. Despite the fact that Biden bragged about palling around with segregationists I support him completely. Trump must be soundly defeated because Russia and the GOP will cheat to win.

Well, Biden and Harris won't answer shit.
Imagine thinking you‚Äôre making some sort of argument against Biden.  Trump is awful. Lmao
The Biden campaign supports a message of inclusivity, so I say both. Don‚Äôt want to be prejudicial.
Why do you think he‚Äôs working so hard to screw Biden, if he doesn‚Äôt, Russia will screw him.
With our national union heads all in for Biden and the criminals he‚Äôs riding in on, it‚Äôll have to be a rank-and-file coalition. Who‚Äôs in?
...in total it will do way more harm than good (for him). It‚Äôs also firing up an already fired up electorate that wants to get him out. And every moment the focus is on his crooked bullshit is a moment he can‚Äôt get anyone to focus on his bullshit lies about Biden and Harris.
I believe the argument people in this thread are taking is that Biden says he‚Äôll target 1031‚Äôs but not actually do it. Like Obama did. I‚Äôm not as optimistic but time will tell

Clearly no one is doing as much as activism as you with that incredible handle that's sure to send Trump packing. In fact, it's most certainly doing more than Biden himself is to reach more voters. Your handle has more substance than the entire Biden campaign. Incredible stuff.

Where the jobs more that just part time? What years did the GDP ever get over 3%? Is spending more than all previous Presidents combined sustainable? The $65000 is how can Biden do a fraction of what Obama did after his move to socialism? Then Biden said...
Almost always, if in a depression, the opposition wins elections. So to say Biden has good odds is an understatement. He can still ruin this of course, he‚Äôs an idiot who cant go a week without gaffing, but to call it ‚Äúacademic‚Äù that Biden‚Äôs going to lose? Lol, stop posturing.
To assume, because Biden and Clinton‚Äôs politics are so similar, that they‚Äôll perform equally as well (or poorly), as well as the house and senate, is ignorant and ignores what we should focus on, which is what to do should Biden actually win, which he has good odds to do.
to ignore. Compared to Clinton‚Äôs at the same time (using RCP numbers),  he is far more stable than she was. During their primaries, biden stayed consistently at 30-some% for the majority of 2019. He won critical states clinton wavered in or lost to bernie to.
instance), if this pro-dem/anti-gop sentiment continues into the fall, dems are likely to  win at least one or two extra seats, likely pushing them into a stalemate in the senate.   As for the presidency, ive been over this a lot lately, but Biden‚Äôs lead is becoming difficult
The NYP headline is bullshit. There are not multiple women accusing Biden of sexual assault. There is only #TaraReade, and her story is full of glaring contradictions &amp; holes. All others SPECIFICALLY said the hair/shoulder touching was uncomfortable, but NOT sexual in nature.
America will last; the pentagon will make sure it lasts. The question is whether we have a chance for real change in four years if Biden loses, or eight years if Biden wins.
Because Biden is up 10 points
Even if I wasn't a Trump supporter, there is no way in hell I would vote for biden. Even if you don't like Trump, between the two, he is a billion times a better choice  don't vote  out of hate. Vote because in reality you know Trump is the better option.

Just to be clear, this was extremely a joke. I donate to people who train for community self defense and provide aid to insurrectionaries, water protectors, nobodies. I will donate a brick through a window to the Biden campaign once I get over myself.
Like some neighbors I‚Äôm flying the üá∫üá∏ I have smaller ones too in pots of flowers.  I‚Äôm in a blue state with riots going on downtown. I know more people voting for Trump than Biden. So I cannot believe the polls showing the President trailing Biden! It is not logical.
That‚Äôs why this issue isn‚Äôt going away when Trump loses.  It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôll fade off into the distance either.  He‚Äôll hound Biden and make everything as difficult as possible, while continuing to incite people that will revere him like Reagan

What's going on is, not only is Joe Biden unfit to be President....he is unfit to RUN for President. He can't handle anything unscripted. This is your red flag America. You have been warned.
So if he was for Biden you would be cool ok makes sense lol he has a right to his opinion I can say if he was a dem wouldn‚Äôt care because he‚Äôs a badass. Im he‚Äôs on the winning side though
You really think Biden and Harris are to blame for all that? Yikes.
Now if you said Biden I might believe you purely due to his obvious, but unfortunate, conginitive deficiencies.
This is all true but didn‚Äôt age very well for Mehdi because he‚Äôs been pleading with voters to support Biden as trump gets increasingly unhinged and dangerous!
Please vote for Biden this November anyway. He and Sanders formed a coalition. A missed vote is a vote for Trmp now, which means the end of democracy and the start of autocratic fascism, acceleration of climate crisis &amp; pandemic. Please.
I agree but like I said, I got Biden or I got Trump .   I‚Äôm voting Biden.   So u know I hate both parties n we should have more , but I have to go with the lesser of two evils.  Last two times I voted third party I got Bush n Trump no more .
You don‚Äôt have to own a boat to have boater mindset. You can rent one. Or borrow your cousin‚Äôs. Joe Biden can‚Äôt handle the high seas, he stares out into the depths and says ‚Äúc‚Äômon, man‚Äù.

Actually there are stark differences you fail to recognize, one being that the cult of Trump is not based in any principles or ideology. It is just that, a cult of personality. There‚Äôs no consistency in their thinking. There is no ‚Äúcult of Biden‚Äù. I support Biden bc he is closest
Now do Biden
When will Biden start taking questions?
I keep seeing these anti-Biden ads telling me he's gonna do the biggest tax increase in history and I'm like that's dope if he pulls it off

Sure, but that‚Äôs a longshot, and even so there‚Äôs a lot of anti gop sentiment atm. Biden could blow it, but he‚Äôs doing leagues better than shillary.

Do you think any cop is going to vote for the anti police brigade of Biden- B.J. ?   Every sane person is sick of seeing US cities turned into lawless shitoles by Democrats
and his gutting of the post office while installing a donor lackey as postmaster general should outrage everyone to set up his bullshit fraud vote cry when he gets crushed by biden is something a dictator would do. jeeze wake up he's the biggest con in american political history.

We have no need to cheat. Biden is expected to win fair and square. We just need to show up and all vote. trump is the one who is scared, desperate, and doing everything he can, even by illegal means, to steal the election.

I saw my first Biden sign today in a very liberal suburb of Chicago. One yard sign! That neighborhood was covered with Bernie &amp; Hillary signs before! I‚Äôve yet to see a Biden bumper sticker on my daily 70 mile drive. Biden does not have the enthusiasm for him, Trump does #MAGA2020
Do you belive everything they throw at you? Get off your as and vote in person. You have a higher chance of getting sick at the grocery store. Stealing vote won't help Biden. Not when people see this kind of famous for Dems &amp; Libs
Mail in votes are the only option for Biden to win. Dems have already tried to steal the vote in 2016. Nothing surprise me anymore. One a Dem now an ExDem!
‚ÄúBiden is the best we can do‚Äù is defeatist
Three-point swish is the Bernie Sanders to bat crack‚Äôs Biden in this question. No hope of winning but it‚Äôs the right answer anyway
Not at all. With Joe Biden we get Social Security &amp; Medicare, with Trump we get nothing.
This is also a safety tip if you're standing In front of Biden at a campaign event
the more Biden Kamala lead the more Trump will do with his unlimited power to stop votes!!
What we don‚Äôt want is brain dead Biden and evil Kamala. If they win our country as we know it is gone. China will completely own us.
You know when I laughed? When Sanders lost every single county to Joe Biden in the primary. All of them. Must have been voter suppression or something, amirite?
When we have  these moron officials telling people to march and cause trouble in our streets no wonder there is so much trouble in our cities!  And when Biden and Harris r not coming out against this violent talk they add to the trouble!
plenty of people in my life are voting biden and i respect their decision/reasoning. i‚Äôve never told anyone not to vote. just had to defend myself to people who jump down my throat when i say why i‚Äôm personally not lmao case in point
The one house on our street that had a Kamala Harris sign in their yard during the primary put it back out next to a Biden sign and honestly I'm really happy for them.
Alright, yeah, I'm bummed we won't get President Warren ‚Äî¬†but Biden and Senator Harris are leagues better than what we've got now. It's telling that the right are trading in conspiracy theories, dog whistle BS and 3rd grade insults instead of attempting to debate policy.

Don't you get it, we don't have to. The POS that  is in our White House is so corrupt that Biden "could stand in the middle of 5th ave and shoot somebody and not loose voters" Oh wait.....
Democrats must win the Congress this year too. If Biden gets elected with Republican control of either house they‚Äôll block any legislative progress.

Look I get the text engagement try but like, what do you want me to say about Illinois voting Biden/Harris?
Interesting breakdown here of suburban voters. Strong urban and near-suburban turnout puts Biden over the top (just as it would have for Clinton). But up for grabs are ‚Äúmiddle suburbs with a large share of less educated and less prosperous white voters.‚Äù
I was up north not near any towns.all I can say is it‚Äôs a lot different than in 2016 where there was a trump sign on every other house. I say 2:1 Biden.

For everyone that was upset at Yang not being on the schedule, I raise a different scenario. Many democrats would do anything to be the last speaker. My guess there was a lot of in fighting going on to be that speaker. Yang was not even trying to be. That points to Joe Biden.

Joe Biden is going to become a champion of the Dirtbag Left after ending all wars in the Middle East, but reviled by liberals for using slurs against Arabs and Jews to do it.
Or, wait, do you have some weird scenario where Biden steps in before the election?  In my scenario (i.e. reality), if Biden wins, we will already be a year into the pandemic when he takes office.   What have you heard Biden say he would do, starting in January?  What's his plan?

Bernie would 100% run against Kamala Harris.    But she won't be a candidate unless Biden dies.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. I don‚Äôt think half the people complaining bout Biden actually know the extent of trumps bullshit. Like they‚Äôll call Biden a pedo cause he‚Äôs weird but ignore the fact trump settled a pedo case in connection with the Epstein documents w a 14 or 15 yo girl.
Obama and Biden were told üëâ14,700 timesüëà from 2010 to 2016. So THEY KNEW for at least üëâ6 yrsüëà and didn't stop it. And then they handed the rapists off to Trump, who'll hand them back to Biden. And it won't ever stop, so long partisan creeps make excuses for their own leaders.
Yeah I‚Äôm voting for the Biden/Harris ticket. Not much to argue about that. But it‚Äôs not wise to act like the both of them are above reproach.
It's not unrelated. It's #blackbusinessMonth ‚ÄîI'm a small business owner and I was one of the many Black businesses that were denied loans. So, since Dr. Biden is bringing attention to that, I'm approaching her directly. I mean all you had to do was read it.

If USPS Union endorsing Biden means we can‚Äôt trust mail-in ballots, does this mean we can‚Äôt trust NYC police to enforce the law equally and fairly

Democrats are doing exactly what you advocate. Biden is trying to win an election by focusing on winning the median voter to gain power. The median voter is not me and I‚Äôd bet it‚Äôs not you either. Do you have ideas (specific ideas, not tweets) for how they could do that better?
They know it very well. Historically Democrats have always supported Indian narrative visa ve Pakistan. Relations with Pakistan generally bn better during Republican regime. Should Biden win It will depend how do they look at Afghan peace process.

You said that it would improve. If you meant that the polls will be more reliable, then you should have said that.   There is no reason to believe that Biden's chances will improve, as we get closer to Nov. That was my point. It will take a lot. He'd have to do something.

Trump is the President. Trump lives in a big taxpayer-funded White House. Should Biden get a big White House too? As a candidate who is not currently the President, Biden should feel free to do whatever he wants within the bounds of the law to get elected.
People are always dumping on Joe Biden, but he's done more for race relations in the USA than any of you bastards have.
I'm pretty sure that it was made clear, in the primaries, that a vote for Biden was a vote for Trump.   When they chose a candidate that apparently needs the votes of folks who have to go against everything they believe in to consent to a Biden presidency the deal was sealed.
I warn progress and trump ain‚Äôt it. And Biden you actually have a say.
Justice will come... just a day late and a dollar short. You know better than most that the revelation of truth is a slow-rolling, controlled release. We‚Äôre seeing justice stalled so the fix can be put-in against Trump, and where President Biden can then bury the investigation.

The Left needs to move its machinery into antiwar mode. Biden will likely win and he will start a war if he does.
This is a touching and moving piece, but also a deeply discouraging one. What this country needs right now, more than at any other point in my lifetime, a president who *is* definitively "for" something.
Bernie ran twice.  Both times, the Democratic Party did everything in their power to stop him.  Bernie had to run against both parties, as a Democrat.  Biden runs with the aid and support of Democrats &amp; the donor class and loses, again and again. The left don't want him.

I'm not really and like I have said Biden/Harris  deserve real criticism but they aren't who I'm voting for, I am voting for the future of progressive legislation having a chance in the courts which it has ZERO chance with another 4 years of Republican judicial appointments.
YES I STAND WITH THE BIDEN  HARRIS TEAM WIN
Nate Silver says that Biden is exactly where Hillary was in the polls.
Maybe we should have let the people vote for the strongest candidate to beat Trump? Goddammit. They convinced average people that the best way to beat Trump is to shut up and support Biden, and that‚Äôs the WORST way to beat Trump.
Yes but Dems msm ignore &amp; won‚Äôt report on hidden Biden.  It‚Äôs a breath of fresh air to have different views &amp; chat yet not start screaming at each other.
healthcare and also the general concept of elected officials/public servants NOT BEING BOUGHT. Biden, on the other hand...üò¨üò¨üò¨
Nate Silver literally said, in the last week, that Biden's stands exactly where Hillary stood.  Hillary and Biden have the same coalition of voters. Hillary even said so.  I remember the exact same people celebrating into the home stretch last time, as we gave the same warning.
And Biden will probably be the most conservative Democrat we‚Äôve ever had.  We can‚Äôt become complacent just bc a Democrat is in office. We need to protest and fight even harder.   Be prepared to protest day 1. Democrats will never fight for us unless we hold their feet to the fire
hoping you see this shit. Idk what the fuck Biden‚Äôs doing...playing tic tac toe by himself...and probably losing.
I‚Äôll vote for Biden bc Trump‚Äôs fascist policies are on the rise. But I am still preparing for Biden to: -Push endless wars -Cater to the rich, instead of providing recovery to the ppl -Keep immigrants &amp; black folks in cages -Privatize our schools Why? Bc Obama did all of this too
if we had that commissioned last time around then Obama, Joe Biden and many others would already be locked up. When are you guys going to wake up that you're attacking the wrong person. Seriously just because you hate the man wake up and find out what's real versus lies
This has happened before. Biden predicts Trump will do something crazy, he gets criticized for the prediction, then the prediction comes to fruition i.e. delaying the election
I thought Biden would pick Harris. But I didn't realize how overjoyed I would be when it actually happened. Representation matters.
Instead of voting for Biden, myself and the ~100k people who agree with me on twitter will overthrow the entirety of the political class, nevermind the fact that roughly ~30% of the US actively WANT more fascism in the country üôÑ
Vote Biden/Harris, then:
The polls place Biden EXACTLY where Hillary was.  The polls also do NOT factor in the fact that Trump is running a white supremacy campaign. His voters aren't going to be honest to pollsters.   We have to wait until November to see how many closeted white supremacists we have.
Just to be clear, even if Biden wins, we need to be in the streets protesting on day 1.   Why? He already stated that he will be going after protesters.  We are on the brink of economic collapse &amp; he is still the party of the 1%. We need to pressure him to provide recovery $$
will become the first black female president after the sad and untimely death of Joe Biden If this happens she would have risen in the west this is bring in the final 2 prophecies 1) world conquer global dictators 2)Conquer Israel and Destroy The True Jewish(black)
You absolutely don‚Äôt understand what doxing is do you?
David duke endorses trump. He makes it clear &amp; even articulated why he endorses trump. NOT BIDENüòÇü§£Trump literally said he won‚Äôt let Black folks count his money. Literally. Biden chose Kamala who‚Äôs African American 4 his #2 (that‚Äôs like lettin the black person have some money)
GOD FORBID, if Biden won, all of America will end up this way, there will be no places to run to.
As a journalist, I‚Äôd really like to see Trump‚Äôs tax returns. Biden‚Äôs released his. Since your talking about transparency, shouldn‚Äôt we get to see Trump‚Äôs?
Funny how you have shade for this observation and not for the original comment that finger points at Trump while ignoring the actual facts that implicate Obama and Biden. It's almost as if your outrage is just performative partisanship, and you don't actually give a damn.
You know the reason why Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt remember the ‚ÄúAll men are created equal‚Äù phrase was because he truly does not believe that we are all equal. He is the epitome of, you know, the thing, White Supremacy.
Mayor Lori Lightfoot appeared on two MSNBC shows in the wake of Joe Biden picking California Sen. Kamala Harris to be his running mate.
That‚Äôs because they respect Kamal and Biden and they know you‚Äôre a criminal an adulterous pervert Donald J Trump. Trump 2020 for Prison then hell
Lemme know when you get a chance to actually read this article and then look back on the Obama/Biden Administration. But try to do it before all the Democrats go back to sleep.
Excuse me but if you read the article you would know that her address was given out death threats were made etc. that is Doxing.
HE cannot lose it because he knows he will go to jail.   They can just go back to their jobs and live through the horror of Biden and Kamala
America is in a state of social and economic collapse right now. You can argue about degrees but that's reality. It could get better or worse under Biden. The chances of it getting better are improved if you have the discipline to be honest about that.

This is not to say Biden will have a bad administration it's just a sober look at how situation and circumstance dictate our reality. America just let a malevolent imbecile play civ on the hardest setting for a few years.
That's President Biden to you, Rafael.
biden should've picked me for vp, i can deliver him ohio + florida. those states are, like, 60% beta subs easy.
Well we disagree. You think biden is worse, he thinks trump is worse. That doesnt mean hes not the same fighter. The implication that hes not the same, after 50+ years of consistency just because he believes trump is worse, is what's silly.
Disturbing to watch people pour psychic energy into Biden. I obviously would prefer him to Trump but even if we assumed he was a superbly competent liberal administrator that doesn't guarantee a good administration.
My mother tried telling me this conspiracy theory shit the other day. It‚Äôs like you think Biden would be able to ick her if she didn‚Äôt meet the qualifications!?!!
point one: as far as you voting for #Biden i‚Äôve looked at your feed and that is not credible.   point two: since you live in calif.who cares who you vote for: tRumps odds: 0%  it‚Äôs sad when 1 minority (aisan) turns on the others (black hispanic)
Jack, my friend &amp; colleague: I‚Äôll disagree with Biden/Harris on most issues, and I‚Äôll probably oppose their Supreme Court picks. But things like the rule of law, the Constitution, and the truth are more important than issues. I can‚Äôt support a lawless authoritarian. How can you?
#jeninepiro if you have knowledge of Biden being in danger that has to be reported. Or threats you are making.

SHES WAY SMARTER THAN TRUMP TOO. SHE BEAT HIM. THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SHALL BE ABOLISHED. THEY HAVEN'T BROKEN THEM UP SO TRUMP CAN WIN AMERICA THE WHITE HOUSE STUPID. THEY KNOW THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS A FRAUD TOO. THEY PLACED HIM THERE AND BIDEN SCARED OF THEM TOO.

Sheila Nix, an Oak Parker and veteran of the Obama White House, has been named a senior advisor to Sen. Kamala Harris.   story:
Dear Senator! Why would Joe Biden agree to any debate until USPS is fully funded? If you agree, please soread the word! Thank you! You‚Äôre the best!
Trump answers all questions answerable.Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt take one softball question because it wouldn‚Äôt make sense. He was given the questions ahead of time at one of his great outdoor adventures from the basement and ended telling us on camera what he was told ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
His question was surprisingly valid.  Her response would be an all-time worst answer were it not for Joe Biden existing still  She didn't have an answer but also her sentence didn't veer off into the unknown or include a racist remark
Yea exactly. If theres one person in this country that is consistently on the side of the working class its sanders. He sees trump as a bigger threat the the working class than biden. Hes earned the right to have the benefit of the doubt.
Biden/Harris really has it all going on!  Biden: Old White Guy with Black Friends. Classic Muscle Cars.  Harris: Younger, Black/ South Asian woman. Cop. Talk Good.  Imagine how empowered the identites represented by this milquetoast, neoliberal powerhouse will be if they win!

Claire, Why would Joe Biden debate Trump unless funding for USPS is passed?

Trump can't spell even Cory correctly no wonder why Trump is frightened today. Kamala Harris can handle any attack coming from him and his base she will rise up and we will rise up and fire all the sexist bastards who refuse to vote for Biden cause he chose a woman.
i won‚Äôt take Ye seriously until I see him debating on the stage with Biden and Trump, in that moment my head will explode
Yep pretty obvious. They can‚Äôt pull Biden before the nomination due to his senility. He has to make it to the election. Bernie will do his utmost to deliver his bro‚Äôs. It would be too obvious if pulled him before because Bernie (who DNC hates)would show how corrupt the process is
Keep brown people out of the suburbs is all this is. I can't wait until.Biden wins and puts this country back on track and improves the lives of all the people not just the rich of white ones.
Oh this is funny. Trump actually thinks Biden could possibly be a bigger racist than him. Hilarious.

Just an innocent response. We have seen Biden over 40 years &amp; witnessed his horrible record. He should have to answer questions about it. Either he can‚Äôt defend it or he can‚Äôt remember it. Either way he must debate. You know he can‚Äôt
Biden is under no moral obligation to debate someone with no compunction about lying.

Joe Biden has more American blood on his hands than just about anyone you could name, including terrorist leaders. That's not some small thing for you to condescend over.
Do you see how out of touch you seem dismissing peoples' problems with Biden as being "a ticket I 'dont like'"? Like that's psychotic
Biden is also not going to help with the environment or student debt. People with power do not willingly reduce their own power for the benefit of the powerless.
I think this headline is sexist.  Could you imagine "Biden Embraces Durbin" or Biden Embraces Buttigieg" or "Trump Embraces Pence"? Uh-uh. It would have been "selects" or "announces." Do better, Chicago Tribune. #WeHaveHerBack #ChicagoTribune
When did the DNC nominate Biden?
Or they could just nominate Kamala Harris since Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt been Nominated yet
Biden is a strong leader who is respectful of others opions and take them into consideration when making a decision. A good leader will surround themselves with others that can give good information on the other side another set of eyes that may not see things the way he does.
Unbelievable.. Super exciting to see Kamala Harris to be our next Vice President!! Biden / Harris !

Republicans attacked Biden for fumbling but this time he's the one struggling Karma in the works. Now we have the last word
Biden waited to announce, now the news cycle is so far removed from where it was when Kamala was running that most boomers have probably forgotten all the bullshit that went down

All the people complaining about Harris also hate Joe Biden. I get that it's hard for a centrist to imagine someone having a self-consistent and honest worldview, but most people actually just don't like establishment politicians.
If you can point to someone who likes Chuck Schumer but hates Nancy Pelosi, loves Biden but hates Hillary, is a fan of Bloomberg and Elliot Engel but hates Amy Klobuchar, then sure. But that's not actually the kind of person you're going after, is it?
Where are you getting that info? I think Trump is a lot closer to Biden than the polls indicate, but I wouldn't guess that's from the black vote.

What exactly is it you're claiming? Are you denying all of the horrific violence I'm referring to happened? Are you claiming Biden somehow wasn't involved in any of it? Or are you saying that it doesn't matter because they mostly happened in the third world?
Yes! I'm am beyond thrilled!!! Can't wait to send in my check, get my sign, and get to work to elect the Biden-Harris ticket!
Yes, I am so awash in privilege that I'm familiar with the role Joe Biden has played in war crimes committed by the US since the early 1970s and think that those crimes actually matter
Biden supported Pinochet throughout his politicide. That's just a fact. I'm sorry if it offends you.

I totally believe they will try to indict Pres.Obama,V.P.

You need to pressure the Biden campaign to appeal to the center and left. It‚Äôs on you if he doesn‚Äôt like Hillary didn‚Äôt. Biden will give us Trump again because of his refusal to unite the party.
Hillary &amp; Kerry said the same thing instead of trying to unite the party. That turned out great for their campaigns. If Biden was that worried he‚Äôd make serious policy concessions, like at least 1 of the lefts platform policy‚Äôs into his campaign.

Im from Illinois so my vote won‚Äôt make much of a difference. Illinois will go more than 60% for Biden. Biden has played the popular side of politics.  He was against bussing until it was popular. Biden was Obama‚Äôs vice to appease the white southern voters.

Kamala Harris is the perfect embodiment of America; she is American, Black, Asian, Indian, and she is a woman. She is so strong that the present man and his cronies in the white house fear her. By her selection as the VP pick, Joe Biden has proved America will rise from her shame
No vote for Trump is a vote for Biden!
She was my hero then and she‚Äôs our hero now. Kamala Harris was actually my first choice to be the presidential nominee. But I‚Äôm very happy with this Biden/Harris ticket.
Again her entire record is testimony to her being a conservative. I‚Äôm not even sure why you‚Äôre not embracing that. Biden‚Äôs trying to love the party to pack right leaning voters. Harris will distance him from the idea he picked a progressive, leftist, communist.
I really want to go all in w/excitement for Biden/Harris but after 2016, I‚Äôm afraid to get my hopes up. I was soooo crushed. I don‚Äôt know if I can take that again. Especially this time. #VotingBlue

Yeah, it's not. And believe me, I am not a big Biden fan. But I'm like understand you will not be able to achieve any reform under a second Trump term. Understand healthcare and abortion is on the chopping block. Criminal justice? He'll throw us all in jail.
If you think joe Biden getting a hold of an executive office is gonna lead to a Marxist revolution I‚Äôm really sorry. Nothing will change, Democrats don‚Äôt want it to.
I mean everybody starts somewhere but I think it's true that Americans in general don't prefer career politicians. Compare to Biden who was a Senator for 36 years or Hillary who had been around for decades before running.
You have him confused with Biden
See even if trump loses he wins because ppl despise him so much they will vote him out only to vote in a passive-aggressive form trump which is what joe Biden is

Wow!! What is this? A phone!?! Biden hides in his basement because they don‚Äôt want you to know it‚Äôs really a memory care unit.
I'm not afraid to say that Kamala Harris is a bitch.  She has her personal goals to achieve and nothing or nobody else matters for her. She doesn't care about Biden at all! She sniffs a chance for her! The left mob will love her. But this is not enough to help to win for Biden.
Biden said the China travel ban was racist and Nancy told us to go have dinner in China town.  How soon we conveniently forget.
This is greatüéâ probably not far from the truth with the upcoming debate. We can only hope Biden comes locked in his TV!
Trump completely screwed up a thriving economy Obama/Biden created. Trump had a guideline for battling any new virus and discarded it well in advance of the Trump Corona Virus.
Not worse than Biden who doesn‚Äôt know the state he‚Äôs in isn‚Äôt a city and the office he‚Äôs running for isn‚Äôt the Senate. As well as letting the party hide him in the basement for fear of what he‚Äôll say üòÇ
I‚Äôm gonna be real honest with you here, ain‚Äôt shit gonna change when Biden and Harris win. They have no incentive to answer to us, the people. They only answer to their rich ass donors and themselves.

I don't think so  - do VP picks really mean that much to people? Not enough to sway anyone to vote or not vote for one of the two illustrious choices we have for POTUS. I would think if anything, Ms. Harris brings some respectability to the Biden ticket.

I will vote for all the other people I want. I won‚Äôt vote for anyone but I have that option in Illinois. Biden will win Illinois  Jill Stein was a Russian operative to bleed votes from Clinton just as Kanye West is doing now to get black vote
Yep. I‚Äôm eligible in October. And voting for Biden/Harris the next month.
You need to pressure the Biden campaign to appeal to the center and left. It‚Äôs on you if he doesn‚Äôt like Hillary didn‚Äôt. Biden will give us Trump again because of his refusal to unite the party.
Hillary &amp; Kerry said the same thing instead of trying to unite the party. That turned out great for their campaigns. If Biden was that worried he‚Äôd make serious policy concessions, like at least 1 of the lefts platform policy‚Äôs into his campaign.
Does this mean those "scared housewives" will be more likely to vote Biden/Harris ???
Uh............DUH!!!  That's why we're voting for Biden!!  #BlueTsunami
It‚Äôs on Biden to win the left. I have a third option of not voting or Howie Hawkins. Biden‚Äôs repeating the Hillary 16 campaign and isn‚Äôt going to even offer policy to the left to unite with him.
Idk if it's PBS or the DNC but whoever is doing the pre-speech music for this biden/harris ordeal is slaying.

Doesn't matter who Biden picked. Trump will win in a landslide.
It says so much about our beautiful country that a major party ticket now includes a Black and South Asian American woman. Congratulations, Kamala #MVP
Racist PoS Donald Trump has less idea about what policies Joe Biden will or will not implement than he does about what colors human skin can achieve naturally.....
The GOP will become very concerned about this when Joe Biden is inaugurated.
It will also feel good when you are sworn in as part of the Biden administration.
Y‚Äôall really happy about Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP...? üßê
We saw 23 million fracking jobs created under the Obama &amp; Biden administration. We‚Äôve seen 4 million of those jobs lost under the Trump administration.
If I lived in Arizona I would vote for the Democratic candidate but I will vote for my congresswoman Underwood so I will vote. Biden was my fourth choice. He is not a fan of the middle class
Im from Illinois so my vote won‚Äôt make much of a difference. Illinois will go more than 60% for Biden. Biden has played the popular side of politics.  He was against bussing until it was popular. Biden was Obama‚Äôs vice to appease the white southern voters.
Oh FFS, can we at least agree that the liklihood of Biden/Harris continuing to dismantle the post office, ignore experts on disease, collude to make Russia a super power again, and continue to try to take away health care is minimal? Comparatively?

Kind of want to have an election night party.   "For Kamala we have Jamaican jerk chicken and Indian tikka masala. And for Biden, to represent Delaware we have...um...scrapple?"
Okay, but I'm excited to see who Biden picks for his Cabinet!
Again her entire record is testimony to her being a conservative. I‚Äôm not even sure why you‚Äôre not embracing that. Biden‚Äôs trying to love the party to pack right leaning voters. Harris will distance him from the idea he picked a progressive, leftist, communist.
You have mistaken this with the Democrats and the MSM.  They will do ANYTHING to win the elections. President Trump has behind him the silent majority.  Biden has behind him the violent, screaming minority.  That's the difference. President Trump will be reelected.
I really want to go all in w/excitement for Biden/Harris but after 2016, I‚Äôm afraid to get my hopes up. I was soooo crushed. I don‚Äôt know if I can take that again. Especially this time. #VotingBlue

seriously, i really fucked with him heavy but then he let us all down by supporting biden

Kanaka Harris was a very poor choice for a Vice President.Her time as a prosecutor proved she is someone that does what is popular instead of what‚Äôs right. Elizabeth Warren and Susan Rice were much better choices. Trump is not going to get my vote but neither will Biden.
LMFAO Joe Biden really picked the woman who accused him of being racist?  Who locked up more black people than anyone in the state of California that rivaled Jim Crow states?  Should've been without doubt that Trump would be ousted this election. Yet the Democrats are bottling it
She‚Äôs represents the Biden campaign rejecting party unity. A repeat of the Hillary 2016 campaign.
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris, the prominent senator from California whose political career has included many barrier-breaking moments, as his running mate, his campaign announced on Tuesday.#KamalaHarrisForVP #montysaiyed
Pretty much sums it up. The Biden campaign adopting the Hillary 2016 campaign of rejecting party unity with the VP pick. Such a shame. Biden and the conservatives just handed Trump the 2020 election.
A total waste. Why did the Biden campaign reject party unity? This is a repeat of Hillary picking Tim Kaine in 2016.

Just think. We're days away from somebody superimposing Biden's running mate in the WAP video.  Please, quit while you're ahead.
Should we look critically at the choices and their records? Of course. We should hold them to a high standard (something Biden is aware of I'm sure). But I see a lot of preemptive what feels like character assassination from the left as well as the right.
He called her a nasty woman. He said she should be in jail. They insinuated she was a pedophile. We are not prepared for the kinds of attacks that will be endured by Biden's running mate.
Time for a hot take:  If (god forbid) Biden loses, it won't be bc of his running mate.  Each contender has their pros and cons but let's be honest, she won't be in an enviable position. She'll face an onslaught of sexist criticism unseen before in American electoral politics.
You're comparing that history lesson with Biden or Bush W. ?

Weaponizing religion: Trump's attacks on Biden's faith, calling him 'against God'
Does she believe them now?  It's a joke how both parties will clash in primaries and then pretend they didn't viscerally attack each other once there's a nominee. In the primary they said what they actually thought of each other.
It‚Äôs all fake fam
The difference between Trump and Biden is huge. Kids try to get away from Biden in fear and disgust. -- We have all seen the videos proving that. --  Not so for our POTUS! This is awesome. Warms the heart.
BIDEN AND HARRIS: Biden, well aware of the potential pitfalls of being a 77-year-old white male standard-bearer of a party increasingly comprised of women, people of color and young voters, made clear ethat his running mate would be a woman.
And please don‚Äôt use Kamala Harris race as a means to guilt people into voting for her or Biden. That woman has done some evil things, and her being black doesn‚Äôt nullify that.

How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
Yeah, no. No more donkeys or elephants for me. If Biden can't win this on his own merit, without asinine equivocations of "at least he's not a literal nazi", the sistem deserves to be reduced to cinders. And I'll remind you that he's already been shamed out of a race once.  üê∫‚úÖ
Anyone of the choices that Biden is picking from is 100 times better than the idiots in charge now.

Which is the reason I pointed out that Biden was already the statistical nominee and there was nothing that could be done to change that.

Biden was already the statistical winner when Yang announced his endorsement. I know the Berners were bummed, but his endorsement could not have changed that outcome.
Those problems existed before Biden was VP too.
Fear is a motivating factor. The goal was made clear and nobody wants to lose their job. Biden should promise to rehire any USPS workers who have been fired. They would probably be kickass campaign workers too.

Do you see how out of touch you seem dismissing peoples' problems with Biden as being "a ticket I 'dont like'"? Like that's psychotic
Biden is also not going to help with the environment or student debt. People with power do not willingly reduce their own power for the benefit of the powerless.

All the people complaining about Harris also hate Joe Biden. I get that it's hard for a centrist to imagine someone having a self-consistent and honest worldview, but most people actually just don't like establishment politicians.
If you can point to someone who likes Chuck Schumer but hates Nancy Pelosi, loves Biden but hates Hillary, is a fan of Bloomberg and Elliot Engel but hates Amy Klobuchar, then sure. But that's not actually the kind of person you're going after, is it?

I know that is why I said Joe Biden is the President not Kamala.
Lets hope that need will not arise. please. I just want Joe Biden to have his turn. without putting him one foot in the grave!

I am thrilled that Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his Vice President mate.  I was hoping it would be her.  This is a very strong Democratic team for the 2020 race.
Joe Biden is the guy who throws leftists out of helicopters, not the guy who could be convinced to move left and enact meaningful change if we all just play ball

Even better....Biden cut to Hillary, who then cuts to  who then introduces VP.
I totally believe they will try to indict Pres.Obama,V.P. Biden, Mueller, Brenner, and FBI employees.Charges of treason are likely.(Because there is no bottom to their criminality)They think that will energize trump‚Äôs racist base.Barr is the one who will do the dirty work again.

Supporting? They are organizing, funding &amp; promoting it. Biden is incapable of dealing with it. Let him keep riding his bike &amp; let adults with a functional brain deal with it.
Joe, you didn't write that. Come on man!  #Biden
Opinion: Joe Biden just destroyed one of Trump‚Äôs biggest attack lines ‚Äî CNN
All Biden has to say whenever Trump says something is ask him for factual documentation or verification. Trump will then go off message and start bullshitting.
Biden is actually on record trying to significantly reduce Social Security
Biden's already signed up for 3 debates. Trump hasn't. Trump gaslights. You're the mark.
Brian, Biden is so sick they'll have to prop him up to inaugurate him if he wins. I'm sure you think of FDR. But FDR had his wits about him. #Biden2020  #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
Now that Kanye is admitting to being on the ballot to steal votes from Biden, I think it would be fair if GW Bush went on record saying Kanye West doesn't care about black people.
Joe Biden is a fake Catholic, fake leader, fake Democrat, real socialist, real thief, real crooked politician, real child abuser. Sorry, but that is truly what he is.
She's been treated unfairly. Personally attacked w/o evidence. Now you're getting another stab in. She endorsed Biden, getting a lot of gruff from her supporters for doing so. I agree with her on that choice too but keep it up &amp; more of her antiwar Dems might stay home etc.
She endorsed Biden. I'd really love to talk to you about all of this. If someone is not being honest, and getting paid etc by someone w/ an overriding interest in manipulating public in some direction is a good reason to suspect them, that makes sense. But that's not happening.
November 3 will be a Biden landslide due to Trump's complete and utter incompetence.  He's nothing but a (New York) City slicker with penchant for bullsh¬°t. SDNY, do your absolute best to get the Trumps off the street.
This isn't just them saying that TYT isn't allowed. This is them saying that progressives aren't welcome. #DNC #TYT #Biden
Have you seen the latest pictures of Biden‚Äôs rally?  Shoulder to shoulder, no masks!  Maybe they‚Äôve decided to commit suicide without wasting campaign funds on Koolaid!  üòπ
You can always criticize her arguments or positions. If Biden goes on FoxNews and makes his typical campaign pitch, shouldn't that be encouraged?
6/ Employers (unlike Trump) are not dumb.  They see what's happening to the economy.  They can appreciate the pressures the next Congress is going to be under with a Biden administration to put science first and get the economy back on track.
The entire planet would prefer Joe Biden, with the sole exception of Vladimir Putin. Bless your heart, Junior.
Trump or Biden? These ETFs Should Climb Either Way.  via
Try looking for FACTS instead of political lies. Trump isn‚Äôt the one who plans on ending social security and Medicare. That‚Äôs Bernie errrr...I mean Biden as his puppet.
We have a lot more proof that Trump has mentally lost a step than Biden.If the Trump presidency has shown us anything, it's that you cannot hold a president accountable. They will dodge responsibility. Why do we pretend it will be any different with Biden?
Not being shut out. Biden is pretty clear where he stands. Your boss, Comrade Donnie is all over the charts.
I'm boating for Biden.  Fuck Trump.
So Biden should do whatever Trump does? Please go back to Fox....
He has ALREADY shown US who and what he is. Eveything that happens to him he has earned ? Biden/Harris 2020? Trump?? Just 20 ..years in prison
Those Obama appointees wanted to privatize the post office so of course Bernie Sanders voted against them. Stop spreading falsehoods and Bernie bashing. He supports Joe Biden. This is why I never watch MSNBC. I'm sick of the anti-Bernie crap. Stop being divisive.
Wouldn‚Äôt have said a fucking word if they endorsed Biden.
May I remind you if Joe Biden wins Kamala will be VP and kept where she belongs, quietly standing behind Joe Biden.   The HarrisBiden2020 in your profile is disgusting and disrespectful and quite frankly gross. Joe Biden will be the president NEVER Kamala. #AOC2020
Police unions endorse candidates all the time. If they endorsed Biden you sure as fuck wouldn't be saying stupid sgit like this.
I know the birther crap is crap, but Kamala Harris is not a queen. Most DEMs especially young progressive ones can't stand her politics.  I'm having a hard time voting for Biden because of her Wall Street connections &amp; minority prosecuting record. Her flip-flops are intolerable.
Joe Biden is a good and decent man &amp; has many other qualities needed in a POTUS. trump is everything we never want to see again in a POTUS.
Trump just lost the support of the USPS union. They have officially endorsed Biden. Trump isn‚Äôt doing himself any favors by alienating voters.   those are voters in Iowa that  will be losing too. #BidenHarris2020
I thought ‚Äúheld accountable‚Äù is a better term for Biden procecuting Trump
This ad was ran by a Trump Super PAC. I lost my job from an economic disaster and Biden is the real threat???!? Get the fuck outta here lol
Uhmmmm no Kanye. Joe Biden should not be take seriously and claud Anderson probably taking financial advice from Trump
This still does not solve the fact some states do not count the absentee ballots until the next day and allow votes to trickle in.  If he goes to bed thinking he won bc fox tells him he did, yet the actaul vote is Biden due to absentee, he will not accept it. YOU KNOW THIS.
honestly i just think biden andvtrump are crazy
Biden is a racist!
Vote Biden. Any other option (including not voting) is as good as voting for Trump.
The Democrats have been actively practicing ‚ÄúWar Game‚Äù scenarios where they refuse to accept the outcome of Biden losing the electoral college and start a Civil War over it.  I think our conspiracy theories officially aren‚Äôt just ‚Äútheories‚Äù anymore. üëåüèª

Some did. And some wanted it to be open to everyone - even women.  To blanket everyone is like saying everyone who votes for Biden is a commie and everyone who votes for trump is a fascist.
Kamala Harris was selected by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to serve as his running mate.

TECHNICALLY Biden opposed Reagan's nom of Robert Bork, but yes he's supported virtually every other conservative appointment. A real sAvIoR to us all.
Biden helped usher in the conservative Supreme Court majority. Anyone vote shaming "to prevent a 7-2 Republican swing" is going to be in for a rude awakening.

If Joe Biden doesn't speak out against Palestinians having their lands stolen from them by Israel and UAE, then Progressives will NEVER vote for him.  We believe Palestine has a right to exist and decide it's own fate there should be no peace and no negotiations without them.
We are fucked Democracy stolen from us with Trump and we are doomed to poverty, starvation, high medical costs and low pay with Biden.   I can't see how any of this is good. Best option,   Move to Europe, Canada, or New Zealand. I'm already looking of ways to move to NZ.
So is the left wing going to sit it out or write-in Bernie or Warren just to ensure Biden Harris don‚Äôt win and prove a point?  Progressives stand a better chance in 2024 then if tRump is re-elected bcz more rt-wing policies / judges will be in place.  Better to work with Dem
Crickets from the left...they have no idea what Biden will do because he won‚Äôt do anything to make the country better. Maybe he and Harris will improve on the crime bill he championed back in the 90s and jail even more POC. #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
It's not like you made some great assumption or inferred something. The words came straight from Biden's mouth. He is not being unclear about his intentions.
But they have no problem using his Twitter account to attack Biden and Harris.
Nobody is melting down just exposing the Stupidity of Joe Biden on his selection.!!!!!

Question for those of which this applies:  What do you like about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?
Hide ya kids, Joe Biden is raping everyone up in here
My take:  biden says:  no debate neccessary, we‚Äôve seen what you have done.
Harris talking about Biden's deceased son is kinda hard to watch
Joe Biden's VP pick of Kamala Harris is all about Obama's legacy &amp; less about beating Trump. What it ignores, Harris is not liked by young black voters &amp; MOST Latino voters.    Why is this an issue? Latinos are the largest minority voting group in America.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.

You aren't the base. You were never the base. You're a shit stirring interloper who works for losers.  You have a choice in November. Trump or Biden. If you can't figure that out then as far as I'm concerned you're fully behind Trump and are an enemy to progressives everywhere.
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
You're acting like you were the only one that has a lot to lose if Trump becomes president.   The only reason I live is for my Trans daughter and get Social Security. Biden and Trump will ruin our lives.  I have to make a stand somewhere I hate Trump and I hate the Dem Party.
someone came less than 24 hours after they announced the vp and wanted a biden harris sign   i love the enthusiasm
I agree.  VP Biden does not need the debates.   Demand he released his taxes,  an on site fact checker,  &amp; if he interrupts,  he loses his response time.

It should be clear to all that this country is beyond repair and will need to be rebuilt from the ashes.. A Biden presidency is simply delaying the inevitable.. I know that‚Äôs a tough pill to swallow.. but hey.
So fucking what if Trump wins again.   I am dead if Biden wins and I'll be dead if Trump wins. After five damn years fighting inside the Dem Party and on Twitter, I AM OVER CARING!   I DON'T FOCKING CARE ABOUT POLITICS.
You should be in that Biden spot.  You should be our next President, but I guess I will just have to look forward to 2028.
Stop saying she's progressive. Hillary tried to pull that shit and we destroyed her argument and exposed her for the filthy Neolib she is. Kamala is a Hillary clone and is as neoliberal as they come. Joe Biden is worse. He is a Conservative Dem. Progressives are Dem Socialists.

Don't tell me I'm being a dick after you say I'm being dense. If you can accept Biden for as flawed and awful a candidate as he is then you shouldn't have any issues with Kamala.
I would like to believe he is smiling down at Biden/Harris.

#BidenHarris2020 Biden should flood the airwaves with ads in the South addressing the needs of the poor. Kamala should flood the airwaves with ads addressing the Midwest working poor and lower middle class hardships. And both should push for equality all across America. #Vote2020
WRONG. Trump turned anybody with a respectable bone in their body Biden voters. Harris is a very moderate person. She is a former AG that is respectable. Trump can't compete. Keep spreading your LIES and FAKE NEWS. Nobody believes you.
She is a former AG that served real law &amp; order. She doesn't spend her time wasting away bitching and moaning on twitter. Good for her. Biden/Harris 2020
Biden/Harris over here serving that election erection.
I don‚Äôt think they gain any votes on the ticket with this move The kids that hear ‚Äúfree college‚Äù were already going to vote for Biden, and this move doesn‚Äôt do anything to gain the middle aged that actually understand what it takes to give free college, and Kamala doesn‚Äôt do that
Obama / Biden were in office for 8 years, and your organization continued to make it possible for disturbed teen-agers and abusive men to get guns and shoot innocent people.
I was a super fan of your Facebook page. A way for me to stay in touch with the news in my state‚Äôs capital.  Your followers‚Äô outright racist, sexist comments to the news of Kamala Harris being named as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate is a disgrace. Moderate your page.
Biden choosing Kamala for VP means two things: 1. He‚Äôs targeting the woman vote b/c he knows the rape allegations against him will soon come to fruition.  2. He‚Äôs targeting minority vote because he‚Äôs a liberal &amp; CAREER liberals take marginalized communities &amp; further marginalize.
I'm so happy biden picked harris im ordering my biden harris 2020 sign asap
Didn‚Äôt  call Biden a racist and say she believes his rape accusers??? Interesting choice
Joe Biden had a number of Midwest options for VP. Ultimately he chose a liberal career politician from California. Who‚Äôs standing up for our Midwest values? The #GOP team is committed to protecting what‚Äôs most important to maintaining our quality of life in America‚Äôs heartland.
Senator Kamala Harris is Joe Biden‚Äôs VP nominee. Let‚Äôs get to work!
Only in the fucked up politics of the US are Biden and Harris considered left. In every other democracy of the world they are CENTER RIGHT politicians. Try expanding your knowledge a little bit and stop swallowing what a fascist party wants you to believe.

UPDATE: Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Biden/Harris... lets gooooooooo
Joe Biden's Vice President will be Kamala Harris not Susan Rice. Here's how I responded.
Democrats close to the campaign say an announcement is imminent, and could come as early as Tuesday.
Monday: Biden is not Trump Tuesday: Biden is not Trump Wednesday: Biden is not Trump Thursday: Joe Biden is not Trump, oh, I'm Joe Biden, ice cream   "Best convention ever"
It is NOT The vice presidential nominee will be speaking right before Barack Obama. Who has the best relationship with Barack Obama and Joe Biden because she worked with them in the Obama White House, Susan Rice.
Val is not a person friend of Obama and Biden's Rice is. She was always a top two pick.
Wrong! They would never leave Susan Rice off. She is a HUGE friend of Obama and Biden. This is the schedule and Rice is the VP.
If Kamala Harris was a VP she would not be speaking twice. I don't see Susan Rice there.   It's obvious she's Biden's pick. Sorry KHive your Queen will never be VP or President
OVER MY DEAD BODY!   I'm only voting for Biden to get rid of Trump.  Biden and his VP will be defeated by a progressive in 2024. Biden better focking not all of a sudden be declared incompetent in middle of his term. If he is, they knew about it before and it was a cover up.
How about we say we disagree with her policies and would never vote for her or Biden if it wasn't for the fact Trump is so dangerous.
He's covering for her. She'll be mad if he doesn't pick her and KHive will be Swarming and ready to mass sting anyone who comments that Biden made the right choice not picking her.
Are you insane? They are the only reason I'm still on Twitter. Silence them and I won't vote for Joe Biden.
Laughable... how convenient to say that when Biden has lost his marbles
Pandering is Biden‚Äôs mantra...
Joe Biden's campaign seems to be going well
Go riden with Biden!

The Democratic Party has an embarassment of riches. I will vote for Joe Biden no matter what. All of the women floated as potential VP picks are outstanding. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Shapiro did a whole show on Covid, shreds Trump regularly, and says Biden should keep doing what he‚Äôs doing. Questioning his competence is out of line? This is a lie just like everything else said about Shapiro.

Hillary was a dumpster fire. Biden‚Äôs better but my post was more or less saying that Polls don‚Äôt matter. At all really. It‚Äôs happened before and overconfidence is a dangerous game.

Yes he needs help not social media posts calling him a con man. Just another reason why I can't stand resistors.  Just a bunch of freaking Biden bullies.
Trump obviously doesn't want to get elected. He just garrenteed that Biden will win. My Social Security benefits in eight years mean everything to me and I'm Ready to fight a Civil War to keep it and have it increased.
Don't use voter shaming on me.  I don't believe in 3rd parties in GE. I would never criticize your right to vote 4 them.  Who said I was voting for Trump or Biden? It is perfectly acceptable to refuse to vote for either of them. In Iowa u can mark on ballot a no vote for POTUS.
I vote the way I want, you vote yours. I either vote for Biden, Trump or refuse to pick and log a no vote for President. Option 3 is a protest vote.  I don't support 3rd party runs for President. Nothing or no one can EVER make me do that.
It‚Äôs insane that Biden‚Äôs bike ride excited me. The simplicity of every second of it spoke volumes.
Harris is using the opposition research she gathered. She is a very evil woman. I will never vote for Biden if he picks her. I don't like eat-mongering Susan Rice, but she's better than Kamala.   Karen Bass is the best and safest choice.
Thats why I said alone, sadly. We are not getting a much more selfless candidate like a Bernie, and we may never in this country. But I will take Biden over that orange slime any day.
And did you also see that Instagram, owned by FB, was suppressing suppressing negative Trump hashtags but not Biden ones. None of it is accidental.

Yes I agree, but how can we convince people to get out and vote? Russia is working on tRump‚Äôs behalf by denigrating Biden and sowing seeds of doubt about the election.
It will be Susan Rice who has a really good working relationship with Joe. Kamala Harris attacked Biden. She's too ambitious And will try to overshadow Joe, which won't be hard. Harris would be willing declare Joe incompetent just to be president. #NeverKamala

I find it endearing that Biden calls his spouse Jilly &amp; Harris calls her spouse Dougy. Something about those affectionate gestures seems 2 show some sort of kindred spirit. I hope they continue 2 develop trust &amp; patience &amp; respect 4 each other within the crucible of the campaign.
No he won't, people want change. The only way he can win at this point is if he cheats. Biden is winning all ready according to some of (many) polls.

She‚Äôs ranked as the most liberal politician in DC, she ranked even higher than commie Bernie! Stop lying, she is not a centrist and either is Biden!
Biden is trying to give Harris the phone because he doesn‚Äôt understand she‚Äôs not in the room.
You are nuts! You liberals always project! Biden is the one who can‚Äôt come out of his basement because he has dementia!
peters is constantly performing the same if not better than biden on average. lol.
Oh this is funny. Trump actually thinks Biden could possibly be a bigger racist than him. Hilarious.
You are so sneaky Bill. A real genius. Since Joe says he's running against Joe Biden, let's have Kamala debate Joe Biden.  #BidenHarris2020  #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
Amazing,yet he, Comey, Strzuk, Clinton, Obama, Schiff, Pelosi, and so many more, all walk freely,no swat raid at gun point at their homes, nada. Now- Biden/Harris?Why?Please, action where your mouths are and indict these monsters, please!They‚Äôre literally destroying our country!
Biden is under no moral obligation to debate someone with no compunction about lying.
I think this headline is sexist.  Could you imagine "Biden Embraces Durbin" or Biden Embraces Buttigieg" or "Trump Embraces Pence"? Uh-uh. It would have been "selects" or "announces." Do better, Chicago Tribune. #WeHaveHerBack #ChicagoTribune
Biden shot himself in the foot and gave Trump the election. He should have picked Tulsi Gabbard. A smart, articulate, young woman. Ex-military, dedicated to her religion of peace and kindness...she would have balanced the ticket. I support Trump, but I would have voted for them.
Biden is a strong leader who is respectful of others opions and take them into consideration when making a decision. A good leader will surround themselves with others that can give good information on the other side another set of eyes that may not see things the way he does.
Does  support this attempt by Democrats to destroy suburbs &amp; local control? If you have a ‚ÄúSave Main‚Äù sign in your yard in Glen Ellyn this is leaps &amp; bounds worse than anything you can imagine happening to your neighborhood #twill #AFFH
Biden waited to announce, now the news cycle is so far removed from where it was when Kamala was running that most boomers have probably forgotten all the bullshit that went down
Fundraising for Harrison has been through the roof recently and with biden closing the gap in this state, Harrison is out performing biden in multiple demographics.
Today, the Biden-Harris campaign officially kicked off. 84 Days remain until we beat Donald Trump. And I advise you to use every last one of them to ensure we get Joe Biden and Kamala Harris into office.
Don't see what new voters she brings to Biden that he didn't already have. And he wins California anyway.
Biden should have picked Tulsi Gabbard. She is smart, articulate, a veteran (the last veteran picked by the Dems war JFK), she is committed to her faith of peace and respect and a young attractive woman. She would bring balance to the Biden team, but Joe shot himself in the foot.
#teamKamala all the way. I am glad Joe Biden is comfortable with a strong, ambitious woman by his side. Godspeed.
Yes! I'm am beyond thrilled!!! Can't wait to send in my check, get my sign, and get to work to elect the Biden-Harris ticket!
You‚Äôre babbling and running scare!! Biden/Harris 2020
Biden‚Äôs VP pick is the first hopeful thing that‚Äôs happened in this country in a long time,
In case anyone on the Biden/Harris campaign in listening I'll debase myself for $100, heck, I'll talk myself down to $50 for you
Biden would win California without her. What other state does she help him win.
Going to pass busy celebrating Biden/Harris announcement! Actually you can count me out for any of your briefings which I don't listen to anyway?
A great pick. I was a Harris fan from the beginning and very happy Biden chose her.
psh, this could‚Äôve been ANY Biden and Harris
BIDEN +60 IN ALL SWING STATES BABY

I wonder what roll he‚Äôs gonna play in the Biden admin. I miss hearing from him.
I have no idea why the "Biden VP Pick" thing is giving me so much anxiety. I already know I'm voting for him no matter what. I guess I'm just sick of the discourse and I want this nightmare over so we can at least start making progress as a nation (even a tiny bit).
Agreed this is not a good thing to do during a Pandemic I am glad to see others feel the same! I would like to wake up one day and just have a little bit of good news like JOE BIDEN IS ANNOUNCING HOS VP!
Agreed I am now getting very irritated as most I know and losing momentum. I contribute Everytime and support Biden but not happy about what feels like a tease day in and day out!
Whoever Joe Biden picks I‚Äôm willing to bet there will be an article out within five minutes about if his pick is likable bc sexism.
I believe she was banned by her bank, Uber &amp; food delivery companies too. She faces now what we will face in a Biden presidency: persecution for speaking out and supporting  I pray she wins.
Social Security is a poorly designed forced investment. Not an intitlement. One to which Joe Biden was never subjected.  #Biden  #SocialSecurity

No, she's right; all you need do is look at Biden's upward-trending polling numbers.
Joe Biden ignored Twitter throughout the primary so why do some people think he should pick on VP on their deadline? I can guarantee Biden knows how to deal with this process than people on Twitter
Make it a triple endorsement by Biden, Obama, and Hillary Clinton.  Just for good measure, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Adam Schiff can all approve of it after release.
Except in cases of landslide (I'll call Hawaii for Biden today, but I can't say by how much).
Because Hillary Clinton was polling ahead of Trump, and narrowly lost the Electoral College anyway (thanks, James Comey). So if Biden's ahead of her, maybe he won't lose. I don't care about polling; I'm gunning for Nixon's #18M record margin. It is unlikely, but possible.
Joe, you didn't write that. Come on man!  #Biden
Brian, Biden is so sick they'll have to prop him up to inaugurate him if he wins. I'm sure you think of FDR. But FDR had his wits about him. #Biden2020  #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
Pretty much most of black women supports Biden
Tweeter is far left. Tweeter don't care that Biden is a pedo. Example if you publish on your TL the video of Biden touching and sniffing little girls, Tweeter will suspend your account.
biden starting not to look like a lesser evil...smh
Imo if Biden wins we might as well all buy some lube now for when we bend over and get ass fucked
Sorry, Biden's not president yet. Maybe if he wins he'll smell your hair too.

the general consensus was that joe biden won the last democratic debate. or atleast tied.
Keep telling folks that lowering bar on Biden will be their biggest mistake
I think what little appeal that Biden has is that he might make politics less exciting. Make Politics Boring Again would look nice on a blue hat.
You hate Trump so much that Biden can call black people evrything in the book and will still vote for him. I don't think you're black

Biden stutters. It‚Äôs verifiable. Nothing wrong with his cognitive grasp on reality. That cannot be said about the so-called president currently dismantling the republic and overseeing the non-response to the pandemic.
You mean Dumb Donald or Joe Biden?
Broken record Joe.  I don't know who is dumber, you or Biden.
Trust me, Biden is not tweeting. His staff is
Joe Biden is dumber than a bag of doughnuts how do you guys not see it. He can‚Äôt even talk properly.. flubs his words all the time and loses my interest immediately
Ha ha ha ha you think white people are smart... (yes, I'm voting for Biden; I try NOT to be a flippin' idiot. And no, I'm not concerned about who his running-mate will be).

You have already let America down ! Can‚Äôt wait until Biden shuts you down!

I follow both Biden and Harris.  I think their tweets are on auto pilot.  Trump is smarter than the two of them combined.
Vote for Biden. Suck it up. He is the better  of 2 evils.
VOTE FOR BIDEN/HARRIS cuz your lives DO DEPEND ON IT!!!
I didn't see proof of that and didn't find his "bragging" credible. Biden on the other hand, blatantly molests children in broad daylight and on camera over and over again.
Oh my goodness! You ARE joking, right? This administration supports all the hare-brained ideas that the person in the WH tosses out! Good gracious, but I hate to tell you that no one believes the  anymore. That ship has long since sailed. Biden does invest in the science!
I know you aren't voting Trump. Didn't say you were. If you like watching children you are clearly a Biden fan.
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden don't #BelieveWomen - remember not that long ago the radical left was pushing the idea that even if you are innocent of such charges you are guilty anyway and should step down from whatever position you hold? I guess they changed their minds.
After the election Trump will begin his revenge march. Congress, afraid of the damage will finally get the 25th going. Too dangerous to let him stay in office until Biden is sworn in.
While neither Harris or Biden are wearing their masks. After calling for a national mandate.  Seen enough yet ?

PSA calls it as they see it.  I'm a huge fan.  Biden clearly takes nothing political said about him personally.  So my response is a huge "So What?"
Second, the leftists are ridiculously painted, apparently based on your relatively limited experience &amp; the propaganda we've been inundated with. Of course they (&amp; ALL thinkers who aren't directly benefiting from his awful agendas) will have problems w/ Biden, we have all along.
AOC also is a progressive but has to claim democrat because of our flawed 2 party system. People like Hilary, Obama, and Biden are centralists who don't have the best interests for the American people like AOC and Bernie.

Joe Biden is speaking live now about Kamala Harris üëçüôåüëè‚úäÔ∏è#BidenHarris2020
From what I read from 5 days ago from the New York Times, she is being allowed to go ahead with her suit. So, if turns out to be true, I‚Äôm not going to ignore his behaviour either. But certainly not going to watch the US go to hell in a hand basket with Biden.
Please read this. PLEASE. Politicians all have their dirty background, however, her supporters + Biden's going out to VOTE is the only way to get Trump out of office.
Fuck Biden. I support the second amendment.
Voting for Joe Biden won't end racism.
Is in Joe Biden still the presumptively  Nominee?
Trump, however, has been a spotlight on some of our biggest, long standing problems as a Nation. He empowered the white nationalists to come out of the woodwork... These people didn't just start existing, they've been here, and now, we can all see them. Biden would hide all that.
Then, also, there's how Biden has been frighteningly effective, despite his power-grab attempts, right-of-Reagan positions, and love of the Patriot Acts. He not only bragged he'd written most of their content years before, but was one of the primary pushers for them on Congress.
Not to pick nits, but, it's "intents and purposes."   There are a lot of people who would disagree, whose lives are deeply affected by surface differences. Particularly Muslim refugees, and those who fight the pandemic in Blue States. Biden might also listen to Fauci &amp; such...
Shut up and have another beer, Matt Gaetz!  Do you ever listen to trump's briefings?  Joe Biden is a genius compared to trump's disjointed rants, lies and babbling!  Do what you're best at Matt...getting bailed out of DUI's!

You lost in 2016 because black folks weren't jazzed about Hillary and Trump stole blue collar workers.  What's changed?    Biden excites nobody (even when lucid) and Harris is an authoritarian who prosecuted drug cases against minorities while herself a casual user.   Enjoy.
???? You clown, Biden is a lifelong committed Catholic.
I have a friend That has a better 10 then me he said if Biden takes Harris he will not be voting for  Biden
Oof! I'm not a fan if Biden and disappointed with Harris, but in no way are they T/P part 2. You can be salty and still realistic.
But Biden‚Äôs climate plan avoids that part of the equation entirely. Good article
To meet the IPCC timeline, it‚Äôs not enough only to focus on transitioning to clean energy; it‚Äôs also necessary to drive down fossil fuel extraction &amp; production. Global oil &amp; gas production needs to fall 37% &amp; 25% to avert planetary warming of &gt;1.5‚Ä¢C.
I will not vote Joe Biden, Donald Trump, or any political candidate.....not old enough üòé
In the short term, immediate picture, Trump/Pence is indeed worse... However, Biden is a shockingly effective spin-doc for evil (like his push FOR the Patriot Acts), and far more effective all around. T/P will push us to FINALLY revolt, where B/H will hide much of what T spotlit.
What, cops supporting Trump....nooooo way lol! Obviously they believe he's their best choice at giving them the right to rape your first amendment. To keep the police unions to continue being the enemy of the people. #Pence #Trump

Eric don't you really understand how ignorant you appear and that thd world laughs at you not Joe Biden
As someone who was wrongly detained I just don't understand how you can gloss over this.  This ticket should have been so much better.  The two gentlemen advocating for the wrongfully imprisoned are Biden supporters, but the see the clear problem here.
Did he call a briefing just to be nasty to Kamala Harris?  Proves what a petty, little, vindictive human being trump is!  The Biden/Harris ticket has what it will take to restore America and trump knows it. You can be sure it's scaring the crap out of him. I expected this!
As long as we have some confidence Biden/Harris will win, let Trump be Trump until election. The country will repair.
Yes, Yes, Yes!!!!!!! Biden/Harris2020

If any politician assumed I'd vote for someone because they were a certain race I'd be insulted. To hear them say the only way biden gets the black vote is if he picks a black woman vp sounds like they're assuming an entire group of people vote solely by race. #Trump2020
Only way biden wins is if he picks Michelle Obama or oprah Winfrey.  #trump2020
Did I say anything that a rational person could possibly misconstrue as that?   That's opposition politics. Look at my "tweets and replies," or, better, WHAT I ACTUALLY SAID.   Are you cool with Mr "Patriot Acts ROCK" Biden in charge of this new SS? He's poised to win, you know.
Interesting. I was in the UP over the weekend and literally saw no Biden signs, multiple Trump signs and some interesting wordsmithing involving Gov Whitmer.....
Do it Biden. Put a black woman on the ticket.
Too bad the reporters at the briefing didn't stand up and question that "fact" he blew out of his ample ass right then!  I'm so sick of his lies and ignorant comments.  Joe Biden is an Einstein compared to trump!

Any Person with a brain will vote for Joe Biden and not Vlad Putin.

No payroll tax is just his way to kill Social Security. Also you must get on this USPS he placed yesterday he's placed in the job to kill the election. They will hold all ballots and change them to be for Trump not for Biden. Count of that. This is something Putin wants.
This is so true and it all has to do with the USPS. No person should use mail in vote it's all a scam to kill the Biden votes and transfer them to trump. This is Putins plan so he will then be seated as President not trump he'll be done and putin will take his new job in America.
Well your a very young very stupid little boy. If you take time to study Biden you would understand Biden is not a criminal while Trump is now and has always been a criminal. Grow up.

They're trying to drive down African American turnout, or steer it towards Kanye.  I think they know the vote totals for Trump are fixed, so their whole strategy will be to decrease vote totals for Biden as much as possible. Hence - the post office.

Again, this goes without saying that the caveat is if Biden continues to hold an 8 point lead in November, the forecast jumps into the 90s. All about time decay and the math.
Yeah, it sucks. A potential positive is if Kamala is a 2024 candidate (assuming Biden wins and doesn‚Äôt run again) there is another primary process that can shift the candidate to someone different. It‚Äôs not necessarily an incumbent situation where the party is tied to her.
Warren voters were pretty mutually split between Bernie and Biden as a second choice. It wasn‚Äôt enough of a swing to give Bernie any momentum. Those voters went to Biden
I‚Äôm disappointed as well, but party infighting is what lead to Trump. Hillary alienated progressives. Biden‚Äôs playform has moved to the left since the final debate. Don‚Äôt blame the candidate when progressive voters didn‚Äôt show up like they never do.
Not to mention her Senate seat is about as safe as you'd get. That can't be said about some of the other candidates he could have chosen.  Biden's favorability took a significant jump after selecting Kamala, so this is a net positive.
Eh, of the options Biden had, she's not bad. Warren is much more suited to be in a place where she can craft policy. She's (Harris) voted in agreement with Sanders on something like 93% of legislation. If progressives can't get with this ticket, they're not truly progressive.

Just not for Biden !
I'm fucking pissed that we are going to have another 4 years of trump like fucking christ we are so screwed choosing Harris as his VP I think Biden just yeeted the election away
someone better tell them that Biden didn‚Äôt pick them for his running mate
Didn't she say she believed Biden's accusers? So how is that going to work?
Oh yes! But you guys will always talk bad about her or anyone else who would be a running mate with Biden.

Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Joe Biden selects his running mate with announcement coming as early as Tuesday
After careful consideration and discussion with my family, I want to announce that I am formally removing myself from the running for Joe Biden‚Äôs Vice President pick. Best of luck to the other contenders!

"look, i know we don't LIKE him, but we have to vote for biden!!! he may be an earthbender when we need an airbender, but it's the only way to beat Cheeto Drumpf the firebender!!!"
It is significant though that this particular sample of voters split 46-39 for Hillary, and now say they'll be 53-40 for Biden. That's a useful data point.
The telling sign in this dataset is the difference in margin of those in the sample who voted in 2016 versus their intentions for 2020. There's a 7 point swing to Biden. So even without education weighting, there IS a statistically significant difference and advantage for Biden.
Seriously? Have you not been watching Biden in the last year or so?
I don‚Äôt remember trump saying he would cure cancer. Not that I don‚Äôt believe you, but I saw the video of Biden declaring it.
And yet he gets a pass. If Trump made 1 comment even close to what Plugs Biden said he would have been charged with a hate crime.
Jr how‚Äôs about Trumps campaign picks one moderator and Biden‚Äôs side picks one moderator. Let‚Äôs make this fun to watch.
I believe Biden says things that definitely come off offensive. However I believ he is sincere in his efforts to correct himself as he has acknowledged every single questionable comment. I would absolutely give Trump the benefit if he ever took responsibility for a single comment2. And I‚Äôd still trust Biden on the issue, especially since Kamala Harris has an excellent record on protecting whistleblowers.
Hey, there are some things that they did that I am not ok with. But compared to Trump, I‚Äôll gladly work to the bone for Biden. No question.
80 days till Biden. Just 80 days. It's keeping me sane. Who else is in countdown mode?

I don't know what your point is here. Neither of them have any power over how voting works in states, both would've preferred mail-in. Bernie dropped out because Bernie didn't have a path to victory anymore. I voted Bernie, so it's not like I'm super ecstatic that Biden won.

Some ppl don‚Äôt care all they see is black...look at the response from black celebs when Biden pick a ‚Äúblack women‚Äù as his VP they all loved it even tho she is the worst
I'm not afraid to say that Kamala Harris is a bitch.  She has her personal goals to achieve and nothing or nobody else matters for her. She doesn't care about Biden at all! She sniffs a chance for her! The left mob will love her. But this is not enough to help to win for Biden.
Decide. Biden Harris 2020!
Trump completely screwed up a thriving economy Obama/Biden created. Trump had a guideline for battling any new virus and discarded it well in advance of the Trump Corona Virus.
Damn they found all 50 Biden supporters!
I don't think so  - do VP picks really mean that much to people? Not enough to sway anyone to vote or not vote for one of the two illustrious choices we have for POTUS. I would think if anything, Ms. Harris brings some respectability to the Biden ticket.
Be realistic, do you want trump? Because no one else but Biden stands a chance. And have you seen immigration nation? Those cages weren‚Äôt for children. The Obama administration wanted immigrants who were criminals out, not everyone who came here illegally. It‚Äôs trump or Biden.
Pelosi is an old person just like biden. Time for both to go out to pastures
Dream on, Don. Your actual opponent is Joe Biden. Pay attention.
I will vote for all the other people I want. I won‚Äôt vote for anyone but I have that option in Illinois. Biden will win Illinois  Jill Stein was a Russian operative to bleed votes from Clinton just as Kanye West is doing now to get black vote
I don't understand why this message is targeting me, I want the person to vote no matter what. However, I personally hate the pressure messaging of "vote Biden or else", even though I personally believe it myself. You're just going to turn away potential voters talking like that.
You need to pressure the Biden campaign to appeal to the center and left. It‚Äôs on you if he doesn‚Äôt like Hillary didn‚Äôt. Biden will give us Trump again because of his refusal to unite the party.
Hillary &amp; Kerry said the same thing instead of trying to unite the party. That turned out great for their campaigns. If Biden was that worried he‚Äôd make serious policy concessions, like at least 1 of the lefts platform policy‚Äôs into his campaign.
It‚Äôs between trump and Biden and they both have allegations. But at least Biden doesn‚Äôt lock up children and separate them from their families

Harris is the first Dem to be on the top of the ticket west of the Rocky Mountains. Biden/Harris are the first candidates in decades to have not gone to an Ivy School.
It‚Äôs on Biden to win the left. I have a third option of not voting or Howie Hawkins. Biden‚Äôs repeating the Hillary 16 campaign and isn‚Äôt going to even offer policy to the left to unite with him.
Idk if it's PBS or the DNC but whoever is doing the pre-speech music for this biden/harris ordeal is slaying.
Isn‚Äôt Biden supposed to lead on day one?
Yeah in terms of environment Trump is honestly the worst, although with the Biden's mental decline, Kamala will be the real presidential candidate and with what she has done to people and her authoritarian ideals, I don't feel like she's better than Trump.
Although Biden is further to the right than Trump, so how is that going to help the left?
It says so much about our beautiful country that a major party ticket now includes a Black and South Asian American woman. Congratulations, Kamala #MVP
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with being able to be able get much more done with Biden and Harris. They are both far more to the right than Trump and have been shown to be far more authoritarian and a genuine threat to African Americans.

If I lived in Arizona I would vote for the Democratic candidate but I will vote for my congresswoman Underwood so I will vote. Biden was my fourth choice. He is not a fan of the middle class
Im from Illinois so my vote won‚Äôt make much of a difference. Illinois will go more than 60% for Biden. Biden has played the popular side of politics.  He was against bussing until it was popular. Biden was Obama‚Äôs vice to appease the white southern voters.
Oh FFS, can we at least agree that the liklihood of Biden/Harris continuing to dismantle the post office, ignore experts on disease, collude to make Russia a super power again, and continue to try to take away health care is minimal? Comparatively?
How Kamala Harris outflanked her skeptics to become Biden‚Äôs VP pick  via

We have the human and industrial capital in the so-called "Rust Belt" to challenge - if not overtake! - China as the prime producer of renewable energy in the world. The Biden/Harris administration /must/ make that a key plank in its platform for the rest of this decade.

No vote for Trump is a vote for Biden!
Again her entire record is testimony to her being a conservative. I‚Äôm not even sure why you‚Äôre not embracing that. Biden‚Äôs trying to love the party to pack right leaning voters. Harris will distance him from the idea he picked a progressive, leftist, communist.
You have mistaken this with the Democrats and the MSM.  They will do ANYTHING to win the elections. President Trump has behind him the silent majority.  Biden has behind him the violent, screaming minority.  That's the difference. President Trump will be reelected.

Obama and Biden left a pandemic plan behind in case something happened, which was then ignored when a pandemic happened. ACA isn't really to blame for this.

biden &amp; harris?? i already wasn‚Äôt voting but that just makes it much easier lol
I've been saying ever since it was clear that Bernie was probably gonna lose that I would vote for Biden just because he'll at least be capable of listening to criticism and will fill his administration with experts.  We gotta just pour on the pressure even harder if Biden wins.
Nah, that's a bad take. If you're not feeling Biden then you don't HAVE to vote Biden. Heck, even Biden has said the same thing when talking about the Tara Reade allegations.   You're just alienating people who are on the fence if you say they HAVE to vote Biden.
That's fair. I generally only really push people to really consider voting Biden if they're in battleground states, since their vote might actually make a direct impact on the results.  I want 3rd parties to be a viable option but we gotta get election reform first sadly.
He did not say that he would veto M4A, here is the direct quote of his response to the question of if he'd veto M4A.  "I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now."
Not a fan of her, but then, I am not fan of Biden. That being said, I am voting Blue, no matter what. The stakes are way too high.
She represents a total rejection of party unity by the Biden campaign.
A sign that the Biden campaign rejected party unity
Biden has nothing to do with either 160k+ dead or the recession, and Kamala's healthcare plan would've covered everyone and forced private healthcare to follow stricter regulation.
Of course he did, it's Trump. The man is maximum pettiness personified.  I'd vote for a moldy lemon and stale bread before I voted for Trump, and Biden/Harris at least have some real interesting history and a lot of progressive policy writers pushing the campaign along.
Kanaka Harris was a very poor choice for a Vice President.Her time as a prosecutor proved she is someone that does what is popular instead of what‚Äôs right. Elizabeth Warren and Susan Rice were much better choices. Trump is not going to get my vote but neither will Biden.
She‚Äôs represents the Biden campaign rejecting party unity. A repeat of the Hillary 2016 campaign.
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris, the prominent senator from California whose political career has included many barrier-breaking moments, as his running mate, his campaign announced on Tuesday.#KamalaHarrisForVP #montysaiyed
Pretty much sums it up. The Biden campaign adopting the Hillary 2016 campaign of rejecting party unity with the VP pick. Such a shame. Biden and the conservatives just handed Trump the 2020 election.
A total waste. Why did the Biden campaign reject party unity? This is a repeat of Hillary picking Tim Kaine in 2016.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP nominee
A total rejection of party unity by thr Biden campaign. This is a repeat of 2016.
Warren would've been my vote in the primary had the writing not already been on the wall that she was not going to be competitive enough in the primary, so I shifted to Bernie.  If it makes you feel any better, Warren has been a *major* policy adviser for Biden in recent months.
Biden is repeating the Hillary 2016 campaign when the candidate Hillary rejected party unity by picking a life long conservative Tim Kaine.
Didn‚Äôt kamala trash Biden in the debates?
Yay! And the next president after Biden.
I don't know who he could've picked that would've pulled in more progressive and younger voters. Elizabeth Warren is amazing, but people didn't show up for her, and she's just as old as Biden is.
Biden is handing Trump the election. The Democratic Party should be sick for letting these two be the ones running
Let's get our 2020 election on, folks! Biden Harris for the win!
Kamala Harris was honestly probably my top pick for VP (her, Warren, and Susan Rice top 3), she'll be a great choice, assuming that Biden continues to work with Sanders and Warren with his policies.
She's not really polarizing, and especially neither her nor Biden are as divisive as Trump. That's a false equivalence. Listening to Harris interrogate someone is the most exciting thing out there, she's a great speaker.
It is great for the President, but horrible for Joe Biden.  Kamala Harris is very unlikable, vicious person.
Biden rejected unity...that‚Äôs why he picked a conservative cop.
Pamela Harris gets the nod from Biden. I wrote white papers for Biden when he worked for Obama

There is no better Democrat to be manipulated than Joe Biden! That's why he is the ideal candidate for the left mob who wants the revolution (read: pathological destruction of the Country). Joe Biden is just a puppet for the left mob and MSM (the same).

First of all, I think trump is very ignorant and prejudice.  He calls Joe Biden sleepy Biden, how immature.  When he speaks, 85% he is always looking down, not looking at his audience.  He a poor speaker.  Congress is afraid of him.   trump should be IMPEACHED!
In so many words i think Nancy is trying to become President without running. Biden os 75 he can take ill any day, they shouldn't be allowed to run that old. But, if Biden is out ,it will make Kamala President and Nancy vice.. Then we become Sweden...
Good prediction, attempts to justify it as "not controversial at the time" began last year, as though that's a good excuse
My concern was her constant stance against police reform and prison reform and pairing that with Joe Biden who was one of the main heads of the bill that helped create the mass incarceration system that we suffer from. But I could be wrong
45 will not win legitimately. We all know this. He has done too much to the election process for his win to be legitimate in any way.   If Biden doesn‚Äôt win then we must march on the capital. Otherwise America is gone forever.
Whats even more deeply hilarious is that youd expect progressives to vote for him, since in the primary biden said he doesnt need us to win. The 88% of his own party that wants mfa that he straight up said in his frail demented shell of a voice, that hed veto.
You should want both biden and trump to lose.

Biden isn't accused of rape. He's accused of sexual harassment/assault. He's not "definitely a rapist."   Trump, on the other hand, has been sued for forcible rape of a 13 year old.

Kamala Harris describes moment she got the call from Biden
Kamala Harris just showed why Biden chose her as his running mate
But we really need to regroup, this fight here is lost. The morality of our people here is just gone, in four years we won't even be able to have this conversation. Can you imagine what could happen if Biden dies in that White House and power is given to this Bay area Bitch.
For example, Kamala was for Medicare for all. Her speech today was about expanding the ACA. Why? It‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs policy. That‚Äôs the gig.
Since I read this tweet I can‚Äôt stop noticing how people are naming Biden and Harris üòØ  Was this also a thing for Clinton/Kaine? I honestly cannot remember üò•üò´
Folks: Harris is the VP. Biden is still top of the ticket. Talk about Biden‚Äôs policies if you want bc Harris will not have any independent policies  from here on. So discussing how progressive or not she is is wasting everyone‚Äôs time.
This might be worse than Joe Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù
Because when the next person gets put on the supreme court, if they‚Äôre hard right leaning conservatives will be the majority in the Supreme court for at least the next 20 years. With Biden, they‚Äôll probably be a least a centrist who‚Äôs vote will swing sometimes
She was going off being anti Biden  just a few days ago. Oh please now she is a fan now?! SMDH
Goodness.   Biden campaign just had more humanity in these 2 minutes than the current administration has had in 3.5 years.
Will Joe Biden be the first person to be Vice President in two administrations?  Watching history.
Biden is giving a great speech today....Kamala is that battery in his back! They are looking focused today #BidenHarris2020
If we want to hang on to our democracy, it has to be Biden. Only through democracy can we eventually get to be truly progressive. I‚Äôm 72 years old and don‚Äôt relish the idea of watching my country die ‚Äî which it will under the üçäüí©ü§°
Yes, I do hear what you are saying, but we have just two choices before us. Voting 3rd party gets us tRump again. Maybe it will make you feel righteous when you do it, but it won‚Äôt help the country. And tRump is more dangerous than Biden.
You are being 100% unrealistic. tRump guarantees destruction. Biden gives us a chance to move in the opposite direction. We need that chance or we are utterly doomed. We cannot survive more years of HairHitler. I want to live; I‚Äôm voting blue.
I‚Äôm getting flak from idiots who say we must vote 3rd party because Twitler and Biden are identical. Not sure how people can be that stupid and still function.
Scheduled for 2:50 PM Central, Democrats Joe Biden &amp; Kamela Harris to give first joint remarks as running mates; watch at
Twitler remaining in the White House will spell the complete destruction of American democracy. He MUST be stopped. Biden may not be ideal but he is a step toward what we desperately need. We are on the brink of complete evil.
The point is to prqgmatism, fuck elon musk as a person, you need to hold two thoughts in your head and look at your own infighting. Next thing youl tell me is to vote for neoliberal Biden.
Hey  - how did you get that cool Biden/Harris badge for your Twitter pic?
I also like Yang. I was just confused about your criticism of Bernie when Yang endorsed Biden way before Bernie. That's why I asked.
The significance of this decision for Black women, the loyal members of the Democratic Party, cannot be overstated. Black women‚Äôs commitment to the party has gone unacknowledged, but they have been tirelessly loyal to the Democratic Party for generations.
When people criticize Biden/Harris for things they have absolutely done to harm others, there is no fucking reason to say "well, it's all we got, so we don't have a choice".  THAT IS WHY WE ARE COMPLAINING!    We should never have to be in a position like this.
Ha - you think our country is ready for a president and first lady who truly love each other and want to be together?
Trump says it is an insult to men for Biden to pick a woman running mate
5 Takeaways On The New Biden-Harris Presidential Ticket
The first sentence threw me off - sounded like Biden was saying it would be a waste of time to get the virus under control. Then the second sentence made me think he was saying he would delegate the problem so he doesn‚Äôt have to waste his own time on it. Now I get what he meant.
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs choice of VP surprises Trump.‚Äù
I have a Biden/Harris yard sign and face mask headed my way! #merch
Finally!  made one decent decision by having  as the VP. My sidelined vote is finally shifting to democrats. Mrs Harris is smart, logical! She would destroy anyone in debates. Hell! She destroyed Biden in presidential debates! Exciting!!
Thank you for stating your stance. I disagree w/your opinion of Biden. Even with ethics concerns, he isn't a war criminal, will not encourage physical attacks on his fellow Americans or side w/racists. We can't have 4 more years of Trump. A Biden victory is the only hope we have.
Warren really simped to Biden for this lmao
I mean, it's a shit sandwich or a shit sundae.  Obviously I will vote for a Biden / Harris ticket, but I sure as fuck ain't happy about it.
McCain needed to swing for the fences. Biden just needed to not die before Election Day.
Of course Biden, who pioneered the 1994 Crime Bill, picked a cop to be his VP. It's all coming full circle...
Let‚Äôs get together and make demands Or they lose our vote. While Biden is not a great option he presents a somewhat reasonable future for us to actually be able to fix. We have to use the rights we fought for to gain the rights we deserve!
More women prison guards! Lets vote in sarah palin too!!! My brain is warped to ignore that biden wrote the crime bill qnd kamala is a cop. During the middle of the riots.
Well then ‚Äústatistically‚Äù Biden has already won the election...
If Biden/Harris lose then the haters will be like: ‚Äúsee, I told you they‚Äôre not electable‚Äù or ‚Äúomg! How did they lose?‚Äù  If they win, it burnish their ‚Äúleft creds‚Äù by complaining about it for the next 4 years and say, ‚Äúhey I was criticizing them from BEFORE they were elected!‚Äù
I‚Äôm upset. To think it couldn‚Äôt get worse than just Biden was a mistakeü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I wish she could debate 45 instead of Biden!
Any Democrat, or person who would normally vote for Biden, but now instead will vote "Green party" because of Kamala Harris being picked as VP, I just say this to you:  Donald Trump thanks you for your support.
For the record, I'll vote for Biden / Harris in November.  I'm very depressed by that, but I've decided that if Trump &amp; the GOP win - it's 100% game-over for the planet &amp; a triumph for ruthless white power authoritarianism. #Election2020 #GOP #FascistTrump #ClimateChange #MAGAts
I say we work to put Biden/Harris in the White House and also take back the Senate. Then we strong arm Schumer and put Warren in as Senate Majority Leader.
Biden: "I will pick a woman!"  Chris: "I wonder what that means for my chances?"
He takes the exact opposite lesson he should here. The endorser of biden. Got you nowhere did it.
Reasonable and unsurprising choice.
So I guess the Biden / Harris campaign will be  Back the Blue ... ... ... ... wave.  #BidenHarris2020 #bidenvp #crimebill #topcop #KamalaIsaCop #sad #Democrats #Election2020
When can I get my Biden/Harris lawn sign and car magnet?
Kamala Harris, a former Champaign-Urbana resident, chosen to be Joe Biden's running mate
Alright Biden, I‚Äôll give it to you that Kamala Harris is a great choice for VP! Makes me more enthusiastic about my vote than I might otherwise have been!
I said for months it was gonna be Harris he made the logical choice She will be Biden‚Äôs bulldog against Trump
Biden and Kampala LMAO I want trump another 4 honestly
OK Biden pic Harris you think Trump will get desperate Don pants and try and take on Nikki Haley as VP?
Let‚Äôs hope Biden and Harris appoint Warren to a cabinet position after they win in November. The country needs her leadership, courage, and experience üòé
and  are winning team! They‚Äôve got my vote!
and  are a winning team! They‚Äôve got my vote!

Joe Biden has picked his running mate.
‚ÄúJoe Biden here. Big news: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate.‚Äù #BidenVP
Drop that VP name Biden....I‚Äôm ready to see who it is going to be
I feel like the conventional wisdom is (was?) that the VP narrative had become toxic for Biden (e.g., he's "late" because he's "not happy") but meanwhile nobody on twitter dot com can stop talking about how excited they are to hear his pick and talk about his pick and...
OK Joe Biden has picked his running mate now either shit or get off the pot quit dragging it out tell us already
. is the youngest  delegate in #Illinois. He talked to  about casting his vote remotely, as the Democratic National Convention approaches.
So unless the Biden campaign is going to throw a fast one on everyone, looks like it'll be Susan Rice or Val Demmings for the VP pick.
I expect Harris will be the Attorney General in a Biden Administration
So the list of speakers at this year‚Äôs Democratic National Convention have been announced and it includes slots for the running mate &amp; for Whitmer, Warren, Harris, Bottoms, and Duckworth. So, my guess is Biden is picking Susan Rice
who on the Biden team thought it was smart to send this tweet out?
He is actively working with Republicans in swings states to steal votes from Biden.  I take offense to that.  If Trump wins it's to his benefit.  He's a millionaire, he'll bask in the tax breaks. Don't be fooled into thinking he cares about you or this country.   Cancel this man.
But Trump‚Äôs deferral of employee payroll tax, for workers making less than $104,000 does real damage. It takes away hundreds of billions of dollars from Social Security. It helps precisely no one who is unemployed, since you have to be employed.
Perspective | With Biden likely to pick a Black woman as VP, here‚Äôs how the media can avoid playing into sexist and racist tropes
I want Joe Biden to win. I‚Äôll vote for him regardless of who he chooses as his VP. This is a make or break election. Ejection of the current occupant is paramount. There are other critical spots to fill, as well. We need sisters on the Supreme Court and Cabinet.
This is the DNC list of speakers, not necessarily knowing who Biden has picked.
Yet his handlers call Biden's faculties into question. Sad.
I mean unless Biden chooses Satan I don't - well...no even then still the better choice.
He probably has a slam for all of them ready to go soon as they announce Biden‚Äôs running mate
Saw my first ‚ÄúRepublicans for #biden‚Äù yard sign today.  Hope springs eternal.
Doubling down on a comm strategy that contestably but systemically fell short in 2016, when Biden's relative polling 2020 against Trump is not much better than where Hillary was in 2016, is inadvisable. There are alternatives, such as solidarity in action with struggling people.
I'm there.  Can't wait to have a cocktail out in public with those who helped Biden win and then kicked the virus in the ass.  I'm in the retribution camp.  I want Kamala as VP because I think she'll want to set an example and not 'heal' or 'move on', and push Joe to do so.
It‚Äôs not a zero-sum choice for everyone in terms of effect. This isn‚Äôt to say that anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to vote for Biden should vote for Biden (not voting for gross sex offending dudes is a pretty good moral line IMHO), but don‚Äôt act like there aren‚Äôt consequences to that.
(Cont from previous thread) I‚Äôm going to say Trump benefits. And I‚Äôm probably going to lose an absolute shitload of follows (and that‚Äôs fine), but‚Ä¶I mean, fuck Biden, I wanted Sanders or further left, but, as a trans person? Who‚Äôs in office actually matters some to me.
...without printing money? Yes. Does that mean we shouldn't do it? Of course not, those people need help and it's not their fault. We're prosperous enough to take this on the chin if we have good, smart leadership. Is that a good reason to vote Biden &gt; Trump? Yep. The idea...
Worse, that we leave ourselves open to manipulation. We create a space that amplifies the message ‚Äúfuck the current system, fuck Trump, fuck Biden, R &amp; D are the same‚Äù really, really loudly and consistently, but we also close ourselves off from the local‚Ä¶
And this isn‚Äôt me saying that I want TERFs in my timeline or conservatives or a shitload of conciliatory liberals or Never Trump Republicans. But my timeline went from, for example, a mix of people who will and won‚Äôt vote for Biden to basically no one who will vote for Biden.

Yet even while admitting that Russia is once again mounting a covert campaign to help Trump, William Evanina felt compelled to balance this inconvenient reality by also saying what Trump wants to hear: that China and Iran favor Biden‚Äôs election.
At this point, Biden could name the Loch Ness Monster as a running mate, and I'd be all like "Nessie 2020."
Didn't he just have an ad that highlighted how bad it was that Biden was going to cut Social Security? This guy has no strategy
That best be false. You think true Americans like the squad and Biden are worth the time harrassing. Their mindset is mine. The only difference is that your bullshit whining doesn't get the coverage when you address me. You are attention whores. Just calling you out on that.
If Biden wins it will literally be Nov. 4th when they clutch their pearls about debt and the deficit.
Kamala Harris could be Joe Biden's VP pick. Here's what you need to know.

A Biden Presidency is bad for Russia
Didn't George Will write an entire column why Biden should pick Bass?   I don't know a lot about her. But that endorsement meant a lot to me.
No....because then the Rethuglicans could nominate someone that could actually beat Biden. Biden is very beatable now, but he's got the "anyone but Trump" vibe going for him. If Trump is out of the picture, then Biden can be beaten.
*who Biden's campaign picked as his running mate
‚ÄúWhitmer, who has been ‚Äúfully vetted‚Äù as a possible vice-presidential pick by Joe Biden, is fully implicated in the big business drive to return to work.‚Äù
He just wants to get beyond November, and if that leaves a giant dookie on the doorstep of the next administration, that's "future Trump's" or "future Biden's" problem.
Brittany Cooper gets on my last nerve. She hates Biden and takes every opportunity to go off on him whenever she can. #TheBest

Even if Biden picks Susan Rice and all the idiots start yelling about it again, I will continue to refuse to learn what Benghazi is
Joe Biden is not able to finish a sentence on his own sentence unless he is saying some racist shit. You cannot be serious.It also allows for more ideas to get seriously considered. The way it stands now, I have to vote Biden. He‚Äôs the closest candidate for me. We just need to keep demanding more once he‚Äôs in office. At least there is a chance of that with him. I don‚Äôt see us surviving Trump again
And it‚Äôs weird to think that there‚Äôs more distance between Jimmy Carter and Joe Biden today as it was from Hoover to 1960 Nixon
You falsely claim without evidence that something is wrong with Biden, but you‚Äôre not concerned about an individual capable of this soliloquy?
Pretty funny you claim without evidence that Joe Biden has Alzheimer‚Äôs but are unconcerned about the mental capacity of someone who said this.
Am I the only one confused why in 2020 our only options to vote is to mail it in or go do it in person? I can do literally anything and everything with my money on my phone but i can‚Äôt select A) Joe Biden/Kamala Harris
as a woman, I, too am upset when potlicians try to ensure that I am heard and respected. it fucking pisses me off when they try to represent my marginalized voice. FUCK.  pssst Biden is really just trying to hit on every single American woman collectively at the same time. Sick.
Did he just endorse Biden?
It‚Äôs an interesting/semi compelling premise: elect Biden so libs see our problems are w/ capitalism and not the GOP.   BUT it‚Äôs kinda ahistorical, and certainly not a factual premise to frame the debate around. He cites freaking socialism in Weimar Germany for chrissakes!
I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs necessarily wrong either, or that I think you shouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden; just that he‚Äôs a loser bully who likes the smell of his own farts more than organizing.
I would pay money to hear Biden say "Step into the cage if you've got the cojones. I will DESTROY you!
I‚Äôm already nervous about the scenario where Biden/Harris win, and even though Gavin Newsom controls the seat until 2022, how often do midterms turn out well for the incumbent President‚Äôs party?
The one house on our street that had a Kamala Harris sign in their yard during the primary put it back out next to a Biden sign and honestly I'm really happy for them.
Maybe if Biden becomes president China will own the US by deploying a biological weapon (virus) against which only the US proves utterly defenseless. üßê
I think the only boats that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to see are in their own bath tub along with a rubber ducky.üòÇ
Ok.... any Looney left person challenge Biden if he wants a second term or Harris if he doesn't... Will receive a great beating .
EXACTLY.  Nope. Biden is responsible for driving folks out.
this will never happen but if rihanna ever said ‚Äúif biden wins I‚Äôll release the album‚Äù i would start canvassing immediately üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Do what you can!  I'll be annoying talking about white voters as a black woman on a ticket doesn't mean Biden reaches Obama black turn out and margins .  I'm not putting that on Kamala as VP.  It's not fair to expect that.
It is Joe Biden's job to get that union vote back up. Harris and her history with labor can HELP...she's insurance... not a liablity. Harris shedding tears  and "telling her story" isn't what labor wants to hear. They want to here this story how she protected union rights.
It's JOE BIDEN'S JOB TO GET TO 40/70/90 AND WIN.  Like Biden in 08 and 12...Kamala is insurance for where Joe is SOFT.  Obama as a Midwest Democrat was gonna win there without Biden... but Obama didn't take any chances. It start and ends with Joe and his Story.  Alrighty!
I need white men to give Biden the 41 percent support that You gave Obama In 2008.  Black women don't need to do anymore than what they've done already.  Harris is NOT RESPONSIBLE for driving black turnout to give white folks an out on voting this guy out.  Go fix your bloc.
The Left needs to move its machinery into antiwar mode. Biden will likely win and he will start a war if he does.
The woman cried talking about her mother and healthcare.... couldn't hold it in anymore... but she supposed to Sob because Biden used the sense God Gave a billygoat and selected a woman with 13 years executive experience and three statewide wins?  How did Hillary do this shit?
YES I STAND WITH THE BIDEN  HARRIS TEAM WIN
Yes but Dems msm ignore &amp; won‚Äôt report on hidden Biden.  It‚Äôs a breath of fresh air to have different views &amp; chat yet not start screaming at each other.
She will LOSE challenging Biden or Harris in 2024.  Let's see if she can win statewide first.
5 PCS Biden Harris Magnets Sticker
To all the skeptics I would like to say the Dem ticket isn't perfect bc nothing else is. Democracy is a work in progress. You should save your energy to plan for a world that is more perfect. Biden has proven he is willing to change with appointing KAMALA HARRIS. Let see how
Sheila Nix, an Oak Parker and veteran of the Obama White House, has been named a senior advisor to Sen. Kamala Harris.   story:
Doesn't sound like you want or will vote for Biden?
That's why I STAN LABOR.... that's the club I claim.   Before IUOE I was teamster 710.  This matters as black and Brown middle class depends on unionization.  My pop wore this button on the left when Clinton won union voters by 30. I hope in 20 biden can get back to plus 20.
Obama Democrat.  It's his party.  Biden is a Obama Democrat.
They're going to hit Biden on the Dem voter fraud in the primaries with more than just rhetoric. Bernie people who decided to do all to be helpful in giving that cover, hope you have your thinking hats on. üßêü§î
just ordered my mail-in ballot so maybe democrats will stop harassing me all day? wait, ‚Äújust vote‚Äù has an invisible asterisk where i‚Äôm only supposed to vote for Joe Biden? hmm
Biden wants to cut SS lmao
Did Biden grow up around Racists?  I'm sure he did and like many Irish Catholics I lived around and befriended in life those who hated  how they were raised and tried to do better.   I see Joe in that light.
Really he hasn't done anything in 47 years let's promised all kinds of things. He said a lot of racist things add video. You guys are going to lose real Americans don't like you. you're saying that his supporters there's probably a hundred people that want to vote for Joe Biden.
I think dude was a Warren fan.  Meh. The far left took an L.  Now they'll hope Biden/Harris will lose to prove a point.
They figured no way Biden picks her after she hit him in his snot locker in front of 18 million folks last June.   I didn't think he would... figured he would hold a grudge.   He used the sense God Gave a billygoat and 50 million bucks raised later it seems to be well Received.
Carol Moseley Braun of all people KNOW how it is to challenge white men...for a sista to hit another sista and call it Ambition was Deeply disappointing to me. I haven't looked at Carol with the same respect I had for her since.
All my jokes aside, this pretty much encapsulates all I feel about Harris. She and Rice were my last choices, and even still, I think I would've preferred Susan Rice.   I'm going to vote for Biden/Harris, but nothing in me is excited about them. And Trump is never my standard.
He couldn't avoid the recession so let's  proud of what Obama/Biden did from 09-17 and remind Folks how he fucked it all up.
I cannot wait till Joe Biden's forced to have a debate with President Trump. That's going to be the end of his campaign guaranteed. He's going to have a meltdown auntie live TV and stumble over his words. This is why they're hiding him.
These two clowns are the, say anything puppets. Put antifa. Com in your Google search just three days ago and it comes up Joe Biden. We're not stupid old man you're going to lose.Pelosi won't pass the stimulus because she wants 3.5 billion for voter fraud for you morons. NOPEüñï
NBA says photographer who posted offensive Kamala Harris meme is no longer in bubble

He‚Äôs doing what he‚Äôs supposed to do based on how his state voted. Also, this is how Bernie supporters get to tell the party to keep evolving the platform. Democracy works when our voices are heard. He still needs to earn our votes.
Just imagining the Biden/Harris administration with a Democrat controlled House and Senate and all the things they won‚Äôt get done for 2 years til they lose both chambers again
Vote for Biden! This Country depends on you! BTW WELCOME‚ù§Ô∏è
are you aware Krystal Ball Rising on fb has become a vote blue no matter what - Biden site?
So because I'm a Christian that makes me an automatic Trump supporter?    Now, what if I supported Biden? Would that make me a supporter of a pedophile? I'm trying to understand your logic here.   By the way. I'm not Catholic. That priest thing is irrelevant to me.
Biden's team will make Harris better than what she is imo.
Hush money, that's interesting, apparently you haven't looked into the Ukraine curruption for Biden. Fear not Trump will remind you
No I am voting for Biden no matter what. I dont peddle in conspiracy theories. And thats all you have.
Question is why aren't they following Biden?
Biden and his crew dissing Hillary after she lost was a clue to how he felt.
A vote for Biden isn‚Äôt just a vote for him. It‚Äôs a vote for the rest of the administration and ppl who hold high rank in varies offices. We CANNOT afford to have another four years of folks who are on the far right in those seats. Remember, it‚Äôs more then Biden.
In the end it's on Joe Biden to beat Donald Trump.   He was nominated to win back Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania at the minimum.... that means white voters.  Harris is an insurance policy with Brown voters. If she can boost black and Asian voter intensity, great.
Joe Biden winning a 4th grade spelling bee. Camel Hairs passing an STD screening.
Thank you president Biden
The federal mask mandate suggested in Biden‚Äôs BS is just another symptom of his blatantly apparent dementia. His handlers really got this wrong. #MAGA2020
Checked my wife's registration and she was ok. So neither one of us voted since we cancelled we others vote. The idea is to trim the vote so Biden does not gain a vote.
Biden is a southern dem.... and folks underestimated him... I'll be the first to admit I did.  Locking SC down defending the ACA is why he's nominee.   Black older voters liked the loyalty to Obama.
They don't have that power. You're giving them too much credit. Their main play this week is Birtherism against a woman from Oakland when they had better things to hit Biden/Harris with.
I think that Biden is a flawed candidate but that Trump is an amoral, sociopathic narcissist whose Administration is anti-life and white supremacist, if not in explicit creed then in implemented policies.
had to admit, the Liberals owners of   dictates what they talk about.  And  is feeding suggestions to Harf to bolster Joe Biden  mask mandate. Weird, she told Trump he couldn't mandate states to do anything. What changed Dana?
Stephen Colbert compares political ideology of Biden, Harris to 'Rockefeller Republicans'    Colbert you don‚Äôt know üí© from shinola!
If it wasn't for Floyd I think Klobuchar is VP.   Look she knew what the climate was took her self out and Took A clipboard to Warren's VP chances as well.  JOE BIDEN OWES HER... For all we  know Amy and  kamala talks. Not everything has to be public.
Biden Harris 2020: very sad to have to vote for you
Me: (composing epic Biden meme)  Freaking wife: Dammit, all you do is post all day!  Me: What? I just finished taking away the kids‚Äô devices.  6 yo based gamer daughter: Mommy, you should be nicer to daddy. He works hard on Twitter all day.   Me: Here Eloise, take some Robux
I hope that when Biden/Harris walk into the White House Kamala kicks that front door open!!!
Here‚Äôs hoping Biden/Harris can execute this plan
Nah I‚Äôm not I got 25 on the ACT . That‚Äôs the sad part . I‚Äôm not smarter than many who simply refuse to see how this system works . Again if you think Biden will win put money on it
Thinking about how cool it would be if hunter Biden replaced Joe Biden and Kamalas dad replaced kamala
As a Black American I‚Äôve watched  do more for the Black community than Obama &amp; Biden (who did nothing)!  - School Choice   - Opportunity Zones   - First Step Act (criminal justice reform)   - Economic Opportunity &amp; Growth   - HBCU Funding (permanent)
PSA: I understand once again that Biden/Harris AREN‚ÄôT the dream team we need- but now isn‚Äôt the time to create viral tweets pointing those flaws out. Same reason as why third party voting this November is a vote for 45. We need to encourage all voters to elect Biden y‚Äôall.
Don't worry everyone I heard Joe Biden is the most electible Democrat so we should be fine
when I hear joe biden speak
Anyway, you can lampoon Biden all you want (and God knows I have and will continue to!), but the notion that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are somehow more politically skilled than him is not the slam-dunk case their doofus aides might think it is.
whites *who were really never in any danger of ever receiving a college degree*: trump: 64%, Biden 34% - Fixed it.
It use to be. Biden-Harris want to take away your freedoms
On the other hand, the Obama and Clinton teams‚Äô dismissiveness of Biden‚Äôs natural political skills is fairly typical of how dumb, insular and naval-gazing a lot of these people are.
It‚Äôs extremely easy in hindsight to criticize Obamaworld for hitching their wagon to Clinton instead of his own VP in 2016. But it wasn‚Äôt obvious at the time how serious Biden was about running, and she seemed like a natural successor.
üòÆHow Trump could lose the popular vote by 5M and still win
‚Äúexcuse me sir i need to hold you accountable for your problematic actions‚Äù i scream as Joe Biden‚Äôs jackbooted thugs toss me into an unmarked minivan for the Crime of having a bag of oregano on my person after leaving whole foods market
Idk what ur talking about cuz we‚Äôve always been allowed to........in fact she actively (!!) encourages it.................like ppl collectively dragged her when she said she‚Äôll be voting for Biden months ago
Just not pretending that my concerns aren't just him not being my "first choice" I feel like too many people love to gaslight the "Bernie bros"  It's annoying. Trump is the one we should blame. Not the people who actively work against him AND Biden
And sure maybe we'll all reluctantly vote for him when the time comes, but the problem is, it's not a matter of not being my first choice-- it's a matter of I, and others, are legitimately terrified of Biden as well. So I'm fine with people giving me reasons to vote for him,
HERE Comes The Bullshit. #FridayThoughts
What bothers me is people minimizing my concerns with Biden. I 1000% agree it's probably worth it, because yeah Trump is THAT dangerous. But I just feel like no one's listening to my concerns about how legitimately scared a lot of us are if Biden as well
For these very reasons (these issues being ignored) I'm also voting -against- Trump, but I can't bring myself to vote -for- Biden either.
I would never expose you üíñ And youre completely right. Your points are all valid. I don't mind people convincing me to vote for Biden. When it comes down to it I might do that. I agree with all your points
Forgive me if I'm not all excited about Kamala Harris being named as Biden's pick for VP. She's still a politician and how many politicians have you known that were genuinely for the people?
‚ÄúShe was mean to me and not nice like all women should be, and also she probably wasn‚Äôt born in the US cuz I‚Äôm racist and a baby and I can‚Äôt stand losing‚Äù ‚Äî Pres. Tr*mp on Kamala as Biden‚Äôs VP
It is privileged AF to not be planning to vote for Biden and Harris.
. . .and I always suspected Biden was a dick - but I'm not including a picture. . . .
YOU ALREADY COLLAPSED OUR COUNTRY TRUMP! BIDEN IS GOING TO FIX YOUR MESS. YOU ARE THE WORST POTUS EVER!
Hmm funny when Joe Biden mispronounces it though isnt it?
That should be too hard to do since million have lost the only income they had and do not have any money to buy anything. We are faced with the most grievous condition as we sit on the cliff over a long fall and there is one way off of it, vote Biden/Harris on Nov3.
It's gonna be a while. Even if Joe Biden wins, the crazy runs deep here.

Joe Biden wants to increase police funding. He is NOT advocating for police reform.   How is better again?
I wonder why   &amp; the other race-baiting grifters don‚Äôt call #Biden out on it.   Yet, President  the guy y‚Äôall irrationally hate, has championed the First Step Act undoing much of this inqeuality.   So tell me who‚Äôs the true ‚Äúracist‚Äù?!
In Biden‚Äôs 1994 Crime Bill he literally prohibited grants &amp; funding to anyone who is held in prison. This disproportionately hurt Black Americans.  So you want to talk about inequality?  is responsible for much of it.   Instead of promising to reform such he defends it.
Vote Biden Harris because literally we are living in an absolutely failed state right now.

that‚Äôs my point. the ad is made by them for trump and yet the symbolism supports their opposition and makes Biden look better when clearly they want trump to look stronger here
What these folks don't realize is that the focus right now needs to be on excising the tumor. Refusing to vote for Biden won't do anything but hand #45 another 4 years.

my guy said racists are going to lose as if Joe Biden wasn‚Äôt a whole ass segregationist. whew.
Trump doesn‚Äôt want to test because then people will have coronavirus; he doesn‚Äôt want to fund the post office because then people will vote for Joe Biden. He is a spoiled child, not a president, and he is destroying our country. ü§¨
Agreed.
The Biden campaign, Democrats and all Americans should raising hell over this. Trump is admitting he wants to rig this election.
Biden wants a national mask mandate? Looks like I'll be breaking federal laws in November.
He‚Äôs definitely going to jail. President Biden will make sure of it
Not sure what the plan is when they run a handsome guy against Biden in 4 years and he gets smoked
Biden just asked for everyone to wear a face mask. Wentso  far as asked all governors to mandate there use. Said it will save 40 000 lives.   As a side note if you do wear  a mask until the vaccine arrives you automatic know you can wait to see if it is real.

Literally this. Also, the election is in 2.5 months. Are all these ‚Äúfighters‚Äù going to stage a coup in that time or just be angry from their keyboards. Real activists and organizers understand all of this which is why they‚Äôre holding their noses to vote for Biden
You've convinced yourself that you're doing such a GREAT and TREMENDOUS job! Those are two of your only vocabulary words right? You have single-handledly torn the U.S. to shreds and you think Biden-Harris will do worse than you? Spoken like a true narcissist.
I checked it yesterday and I couldn't believe it when I write the Joe Biden's campaign. I even posted it on his Twitter and ask what the hell is this old man. Now it says it's unavailable you got to be kidding me right boy they think we're stupid don't they.

1) The entire world is already laughing at us &amp; shaking their collective heads. You‚Äôve turned us into a joke.  2) What she‚Äôs saying is, Joe Biden, unlike you, is open to ideas that aren‚Äôt his own. That‚Äôs how you serve the greater good, by not acting like the only smart person.
You know ain't nobody big or important. at least I am to myself but Twitter blocks me because I'm responding on Joe Biden's page or Kamala Harris's page it's amazing that they can block you for 12 hours. Like that's going to make a difference or change my view üñïüñïüñïüñïüñïüñï

Don‚Äôt pick apart Biden and Harris. Vote for them and talk trash later.     Another 4 years of the Dump Administration could literally end the world.

This statement should be a Biden-Harris ad all by itself.
Of course they will run another Wall Steet Big Tech crony show, Biden &amp; Harris will not suddenly have different backers in Nov than they do, now, or become different people. And if we all believe they still "must win" &amp; give them unconditional support, we can't move them. (1)

Umm Biden/Harris would toss minorities in jail for years for non violent offenses
Pretty cool that if Biden loses we can blame toxic KHive Twitter users and if he wins we can prove toxic Twitter supporters aren't a real detriment
Neither Biden nor Harris have ever said that. You have nothing to contribute to a meaningful debate. Crawl back to your hole and prepare yourself for decades in the political wilderness.

Honestly, this really made me wanna vote for Biden instantly. Liked seeing those elbow in action üëçüèΩ
Well you know what Joe Biden said.
You can hate the two party system. You can hate that the presidential candidate isn‚Äôt more progressive. But Biden isn‚Äôt even in the same zip code as Trump when it comes to tearing down the democratic process here. No progressive ideas will see the light of day in Trump‚Äôs America.
I keep hearing from people that they aren‚Äôt enthused or that they hate the idea of settling. Look, I get it. So few people at the start of this had Biden as their candidate (I know I didn‚Äôt). So we‚Äôre all dealing with some disappointment. But every liberal cause is now at stake.

Literally only voting for Biden to get Trump out. Of all the options, he was like, fourth on my list. Maybe, MAYBE third.
Most realistically joe Biden would get run over by the train after becoming confused and stepping on tracks.
So true, let‚Äôs not forget Obama &amp; Gates funded the lab in China to intentionally cause this mess during Trumps term! It‚Äôs not a question of right vs. left, it‚Äôs right vs. wrong! Funny how Biden owns an island next to Epstein‚Äôs. Wtf?
The level of pure corruption and incompetence within the DNC makes this Biden-Harris Presidential pairing hilariously unsurprising.
Telling how you hide the fact your a Biden supporter and hate Trump.
#HeelsUpHarris is a phony, and her laugh is annoying as hell, between Biden‚Äôs gaffes and her phoniness they make the perfect dumb and dumber

Way to go Biden #HeelsUpHarris
Just a reminder that Biden still technically doesn't have enough delegates
After watching that clip of Joe Biden riding his bike, I have come to the conclusion that he missed the all-time best setup for a "jo mamma" joke.   I will no longer be voting for him.
Biden hasn‚Äôt got any brain cells... everyone can see that. It‚Äôs so frustrating how people can‚Äôt see the evil George Soros started. So many fell for it and we‚Äôve gone backwards 100 years.

HOW Fake Fox News discredits talking point of right wing radio. Establishment stopped talking abt Covid 19 to spread lies abt Biden. All right wing media focusing on Biden. Distraction is being used to avoid talking abt the pandemic &amp; trumps failures.
Happy colonoscopy prep day to me.   Still better than a Biden speech.
Where‚Äôs  suspending your account for lying, oh that right twitter only attack conservatives. You‚Äôre a a liar and Marxist, Biden the basement dweller will never be President and America will never a socialist country.
The corp Dems and Republicans don‚Äôt care that DT passed an executive order  bec they both wanted to end soc security &amp; now they don‚Äôt have to deal with the stimulus for the American ppl, if DT doesn‚Äôt do it Biden will surely do it.
Like Trump‚Äôs list of infractions doesn‚Äôt include Biden‚Äôs list and more not to mention he‚Äôll tell whatever he thinks you want to hear - i.e., hes a two-faced liar.
Not! I don‚Äôt like to be mean however why did he get rid of the pandemic team we didn‚Äôt need? Seemed Biden and Obama knew we needed one!
Sad the Democrats cheer because people are unemployed they want to keep America closed, they fear monger and spread political propaganda. Worst run states and cities, are run by Democrats. They support basement dweller Biden,ü§£ü§£ #Trump2020Victory #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForeverSo if you REALLY think you're a better candidate than Joe Biden, then what's with all this corruption with the post office?  You are once again trying to destroy our democracy and it won't work.  Unlike you, Biden is a true leader.
80 days till Biden. Just 80 days. It's keeping me sane. Who else is in countdown mode?
Kamala is the real candidate.. Not Biden.
#BidenHarrisLandslide2020 Just like Clinton was going to win by a landslide. America needs drastic changes and Biden said no drastic changes to his corporate masters. We deserve better.
So far all I‚Äôve heard you do is complain about Donald J Trump. The man saving American from career corrupt people like your buddy Joe Biden and your self.
Jason, Warren was actually my 2nd choice after Bernie, for President, but the POC spoke out and they wanted Biden. So buck up &amp; leave the sour grapes on the table. We  must support Biden/Harris to defeat the monster Trump! I will be joyful with Biden as president &amp; Harris as VP.
Is he freaking joking?  "Nothing will change",  "I will veto Medicare for all" now badly needs progressives?  Well this progressive does not need you:
Kamala was born in Oakland, California. California jokes and un-naturally born jokes aside, she's a natural-born citizen. There are a vast number of far more important issues with Kamala than this, and going Birther 2.0 would be playing into her and Biden's hand.
I haven‚Äôt seen anything about President Trump playing golf since COVID 19 began Joe Biden and Kamala Harris day nothing but lies!!!

Poser 'President' Biden told them to mandate mask wearing outside. It's not about your rights.
Biden is trying to take credit of this semi-non deal you refer to.
When I watched your press conference with Joe Biden I realized that Joe made a brilliant choice.  I was proud and excited that you and Joe will be representing me in November. I can hardly wait until our incompetent narcissistic president is thrown out of office.
It is, and  says this for why they need to vote: It raises the sea level.  The less Biden loses by in any GOP stronghold, the less votes he needs to pull out of Democratic strongholds.  Or, the more he wins by and the more we repudiate Trumpism.
I predict it helps Biden squeak out a victory in Illinois
To all the Americans who have any doubts whether Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are up to the job, I implore you to watch this video.

I am already noticing lie-based attack ads against Biden and Harris.put out by your campaign.  One thing that is no lie is your abysmal performance as president.  Your influence is disappearing every day before our eyes, Donny.
The level of pure corruption and incompetence within the DNC makes this Biden-Harris Presidential pairing hilariously unsurprising.
But your main premise is not true. Biden did not propose that we ban fracking.
Great to see Obama in this and not Biden. Biden is too demented to fight anyone lol
pro slavery, I realize I have to put all the bs asside and vote for the side that doesn't have someone trying to bring back slavery, because lets face it if Biden wins, his vp is the real president. Seriously please don't support her, don't support slavery.
Biden is a corrupt senile old man and Harris kept valuable information that would have proven without a doubt that a man was innocent, she was in favor of making marijuana illegal and laughed about jailing people even though she herself has smoked it, she-
Damn they found all 50 Biden supporters!
Be realistic, do you want trump? Because no one else but Biden stands a chance. And have you seen immigration nation? Those cages weren‚Äôt for children. The Obama administration wanted immigrants who were criminals out, not everyone who came here illegally. It‚Äôs trump or Biden.
Workers of those companies come up with the ideas and you think their money trickles down to the middle class. We it doesn‚Äôt moron. The Trump tax cut didn‚Äôt do anything for me. It only helped rich people. Biden will change that. 83 days üòò ‚ÄúI work when I want to‚Äù. Lmao.

It‚Äôs between trump and Biden and they both have allegations. But at least Biden doesn‚Äôt lock up children and separate them from their families
Next President of the United States Joe Biden and the next Vice President Kamala Harris.
She‚Äôs NOT black.  She bashed Biden, what changed.  Oh she maybe President!! Think twice!!
Great Biden gets the white house. We take everything else. Let's get all our friends to join direct groups. üòè
This Kamala Harris, even in a deceased state, is a far better choice than the one Creepy Joe Biden chose.
Yeah in terms of environment Trump is honestly the worst, although with the Biden's mental decline, Kamala will be the real presidential candidate and with what she has done to people and her authoritarian ideals, I don't feel like she's better than Trump.
Although Biden is further to the right than Trump, so how is that going to help the left?
Would you REALLY be expressing those kinds of concerns if the VP were a man? You said "she's VP, not President. People were concerned that she is....blah blah blah....." Check your reality as it relates to having a woman capable of leading the country with Biden.
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with being able to be able get much more done with Biden and Harris. They are both far more to the right than Trump and have been shown to be far more authoritarian and a genuine threat to African Americans.
You know Donny, I found the extremely cruel words you spoke questioning Joe Biden's belief in God, offensive and something a Christian would never say.
Stop watching CNN progressives hate Kamala and Joe Biden. Wake up

How.. Biden supports the Green New Deal..
If you look at the past 2-3 decades we are given George W, war criminal, then insane Palin, and now this turd.  It keeps getting worse.  I think that electing "Nothing will change" Biden will mean that in 4 years we brace ourselves for something even worse than Trump.
You have to look at the pattern here Rocky.  People like Biden, both Clintons, Kerry whose sole purpose in life is allowing corporatist to prevent populist on left to rise are the sole reason of the other party going to extreme right, fascism.  There is no counterbalance.

Biden picked a strong, brave woman of color. A woman of integrity who is not afraid to take a knee to get the job done. Well done, Joe. This is what success smells like.
I'm riding with Biden until the end.  Period.
I‚Äôm not sure if Biden will beat Trump, Kamala Harris is definitely a fucking cop, and Pence is going to get fucking WORKED during those debates with her. If he wasn‚Äôt such a ghoul I‚Äôd kinda feel bad for him but watching that bastard get dog walked is gonna rule.
All the pundits shown on this video are left of center, so you can‚Äôt say some right winger is lying to make Biden look bad.
Poor guy,  he doesn't know how to speak and he always sound like the first speech he ever gave.  I know Biden has his issues, but at least he's not self-centered like Trump is.
Who has confidence in Biden? He can't even remember Obama's name.
I mean with Kamala as VP, she is essentially the president due to Biden's mental deterioration. Considering she's pro slavery and anti pot, are you sure?
Willie Brown was Biden's chance?
Biden spent his life stealing from us and getting pay offs for him and his family You on the other had slept your way to were you are today
Can‚Äôt wait for  and  to play Harris and Biden on  in the coming months
You are going to try to paint her as  radical left but the Democratic ticket of Biden and Harris is clear indication that the party has rejected it, so good luck with that.
Joe Biden didn't fight for anybody but himself and family.
She also called Biden a racist. Do you purposely not mention that?

With Biden's new VP pick being Kamala harris I would like to remind people to join the Black Lives Matter group. Remember, it's better to be active than to stay home being angry. Go here:  #DefundThePolice #BLM
Nothing this lying creep could say would prevent me from voting Biden/Harris. NOTHING
Biden just sealed his fate.  Duckworth would have been a way better choice than Harris IMHO.
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Yall saying you're no longer voting for biden might as well vote for trump
Yay! And the next president after Biden.
Just a reminder that Biden still technically doesn't have enough delegates
If Biden selects Kamala Harris he will be toast. Very vulnerable VP pick
After watching that clip of Joe Biden riding his bike, I have come to the conclusion that he missed the all-time best setup for a "jo mamma" joke.   I will no longer be voting for him.
Joe Biden is a joke.
I love how the Biden campaign view the VP selection as the ‚Äúleast risky‚Äù and not helpful or advantageous
So so true ! Like night &amp; day ! Please vote for  Biden to save America ! To God be the Glory !
Big step Governor.  Thank you.  I appreciate your integrity, your decency and your willingness to own and act on your convictions.  I hope you end up in Pres. Biden‚Äôs cabinet.
Jill Biden plans to continue to teach if she becomes first lady
If you‚Äôre in #MarketingStrategy, put your politics aside and read this plan. The Trump campaign is a media machine, pumping out daily a frightening narrative through a vast network of throats. Biden‚Äôs campaign has him on a bike.
This is ridiculous.  It was a slip. God I hate defending Trump, but if Biden misspoke in that manner, and Jr, Sean, and the gang jumped on him for it I would be pissed.
Everyone thinks Joe Biden is the saviour, but he keeps telling us who he really is when he says he'll veto Med4all, tells his donors and super PACs nothing will change, cut SS which he's tried again&amp;again &amp; continue w constant war &amp; overthrow other countries president.
Look around what is happening at this moment! Biden will do 1000 times better.
Your father was a great comedian, but also an outstanding actor. He is missed. Political figures are pubic figures. His piece on Biden, like other politicians in his act are fair game. It was also hilarious. Let‚Äôs just leave it at that and not make it political.

People are brainwashed to think nothing can be worse than trump. Even if trump is as bad as some people think, Biden is inherently worse.80 days till Biden. Just 80 days. It's keeping me sane. Who else is in countdown mode?
Kamala is the real candidate.. Not Biden.
Kamala was born in Oakland, California. California jokes and un-naturally born jokes aside, she's a natural-born citizen. There are a vast number of far more important issues with Kamala than this, and going Birther 2.0 would be playing into her and Biden's hand.
I haven‚Äôt seen anything about President Trump playing golf since COVID 19 began Joe Biden and Kamala Harris day nothing but lies!!!
#KamalaHarris is another #metoo hypocrite #BelieveAllWomen Biden assaulted #TaraReade

Do the Democrats think the world is as gullible as they are? They would think the VP choice is the greatest even if Biden picked Minnie Mouse
Birtherizum is back. GOP really has no imagination. It didn‚Äôt stop Obama and it won‚Äôt stop Biden/Harris
has done more Greenstuff through private enterprise than Biden ever did in his entire career as a Senator.  #PatHeads #PutThatInYourPipe
If elected, Biden would be the first president who graduated from a public university since LBJ.
I don't know what your point is here. Neither of them have any power over how voting works in states, both would've preferred mail-in. Bernie dropped out because Bernie didn't have a path to victory anymore. I voted Bernie, so it's not like I'm super ecstatic that Biden won.
I agree. On day one Biden's gonna have all his picks ready to go!
What is Biden supposed to do to change how voting works? He's had no power in government for 3 years now. That's not his decision.
Great to see Obama in this and not Biden. Biden is too demented to fight anyone lol
pro slavery, I realize I have to put all the bs asside and vote for the side that doesn't have someone trying to bring back slavery, because lets face it if Biden wins, his vp is the real president. Seriously please don't support her, don't support slavery.
Biden is a corrupt senile old man and Harris kept valuable information that would have proven without a doubt that a man was innocent, she was in favor of making marijuana illegal and laughed about jailing people even though she herself has smoked it, she-
Decide. Biden Harris 2020!
Damn they found all 50 Biden supporters!
Be realistic, do you want trump? Because no one else but Biden stands a chance. And have you seen immigration nation? Those cages weren‚Äôt for children. The Obama administration wanted immigrants who were criminals out, not everyone who came here illegally. It‚Äôs trump or Biden.
First of all, who‚Äôs the idiot reporter that just asked Trump about Antifa and the Biden/Harris campaign.  Second of all, can reports just start saying ‚Äúreclaiming my time‚Äù when he goes on these tangents. I just had to mute my TV again. November can‚Äôt come quick enough for me.
I don't understand why this message is targeting me, I want the person to vote no matter what. However, I personally hate the pressure messaging of "vote Biden or else", even though I personally believe it myself. You're just going to turn away potential voters talking like that.
It‚Äôs between trump and Biden and they both have allegations. But at least Biden doesn‚Äôt lock up children and separate them from their families
I‚Äôve been telling people for like half a year now that the time to be complacent for any leadership is over. I‚Äôm voting Biden but I‚Äôm gonna be constantly critical of him and demanding more.
Next President of the United States Joe Biden and the next Vice President Kamala Harris.
She‚Äôs NOT black.  She bashed Biden, what changed.  Oh she maybe President!! Think twice!!
Harris is the first Dem to be on the top of the ticket west of the Rocky Mountains. Biden/Harris are the first candidates in decades to have not gone to an Ivy School.
Yeah in terms of environment Trump is honestly the worst, although with the Biden's mental decline, Kamala will be the real presidential candidate and with what she has done to people and her authoritarian ideals, I don't feel like she's better than Trump.
Although Biden is further to the right than Trump, so how is that going to help the left?
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with being able to be able get much more done with Biden and Harris. They are both far more to the right than Trump and have been shown to be far more authoritarian and a genuine threat to African Americans.
Biden could be a better leader than Trump from his basement.
How.. Biden supports the Green New Deal..
And Biden will refer to her as "the first mainstream(whatever ethnicityTrump chooses) who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking broad who is fun to sniff" No ill wishes to Biden, but I hope she takes over quick.

We have the human and industrial capital in the so-called "Rust Belt" to challenge - if not overtake! - China as the prime producer of renewable energy in the world. The Biden/Harris administration /must/ make that a key plank in its platform for the rest of this decade.
How does Joe Biden know that?!?! He doesn't even remember his own name... Stop making falsified claims you can't back up. #Trump2020 If you have even a single brain cell remaining you will vote for the RIGHT choice. Trump for another 4!!!
I don‚Äôt know why it would be this time, Biden would likely pick a cabinet that‚Äôs as optimal and expert-filled as possible
How many stones do you need?  Those without sin throw the first one.  REALLY!  Biden?  Evil will always prevail!

Good is evil and evil is good!! Crazy and people are blind.  I had a classmate say if he had Mickey Mouse running she would still vote for Biden.  So much Hate out there.  It‚Äôs a war between God and Satan.  If we know the end of the ‚ÄúBook‚Äù we know who wins. üòá
You know Biden debating Trump (or even a fifth grader) would be a train wreck. Biden does not have the mental capacity to become dog catcher.  What a sham.
Biden picked a strong, brave woman of color. A woman of integrity who is not afraid to take a knee to get the job done. Well done, Joe. This is what success smells like.
Who has confidence in Biden? He can't even remember Obama's name.
I mean with Kamala as VP, she is essentially the president due to Biden's mental deterioration. Considering she's pro slavery and anti pot, are you sure?
Obama and Biden left a pandemic plan behind in case something happened, which was then ignored when a pandemic happened. ACA isn't really to blame for this.
#teamKamala all the way. I am glad Joe Biden is comfortable with a strong, ambitious woman by his side. Godspeed.
You are going to try to paint her as  radical left but the Democratic ticket of Biden and Harris is clear indication that the party has rejected it, so good luck with that.
You‚Äôre babbling and running scare!! Biden/Harris 2020
I've been saying ever since it was clear that Bernie was probably gonna lose that I would vote for Biden just because he'll at least be capable of listening to criticism and will fill his administration with experts.  We gotta just pour on the pressure even harder if Biden wins.
Nah, that's a bad take. If you're not feeling Biden then you don't HAVE to vote Biden. Heck, even Biden has said the same thing when talking about the Tara Reade allegations.   You're just alienating people who are on the fence if you say they HAVE to vote Biden.
That's fair. I generally only really push people to really consider voting Biden if they're in battleground states, since their vote might actually make a direct impact on the results.  I want 3rd parties to be a viable option but we gotta get election reform first sadly.
Joe Biden will not only be remembered as a President of the United States but the man who introduced us to our first black female Presidentüá∫üá∏ This is one party I can‚Äôt wait to get started üëç
He did not say that he would veto M4A, here is the direct quote of his response to the question of if he'd veto M4A.  "I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now."
Biden has nothing to do with either 160k+ dead or the recession, and Kamala's healthcare plan would've covered everyone and forced private healthcare to follow stricter regulation.
Of course he did, it's Trump. The man is maximum pettiness personified.  I'd vote for a moldy lemon and stale bread before I voted for Trump, and Biden/Harris at least have some real interesting history and a lot of progressive policy writers pushing the campaign along.
Warren would've been my vote in the primary had the writing not already been on the wall that she was not going to be competitive enough in the primary, so I shifted to Bernie.  If it makes you feel any better, Warren has been a *major* policy adviser for Biden in recent months.
Yall saying you're no longer voting for biden might as well vote for trump
Yay! And the next president after Biden.
I don't know who he could've picked that would've pulled in more progressive and younger voters. Elizabeth Warren is amazing, but people didn't show up for her, and she's just as old as Biden is.
Kamala Harris was honestly probably my top pick for VP (her, Warren, and Susan Rice top 3), she'll be a great choice, assuming that Biden continues to work with Sanders and Warren with his policies.
She's not really polarizing, and especially neither her nor Biden are as divisive as Trump. That's a false equivalence. Listening to Harris interrogate someone is the most exciting thing out there, she's a great speaker.
Biden Harris LFG

And yet unlike Trump, Biden will pick an administration and work with qualified experts because he knows that it‚Äôs not really about him as an individual at all. That‚Äôs the draw for Biden in this case, he‚Äôs very good at knowing when to seek expert opinion.

Are we sure about that? I know that's the narrative I just don't know a single reason to think it's true. She doesn't do well with the groups Biden needs more of (youth, Latinos), and couldn't even make it to Iowa in the primaries. Sorry to sound like such a naysayer.

thread: why ted kaczynski would be voting biden and you should too 1/n
tRump: Follows Putin, COVID-19's a hoax, defunds Social Security &amp; USPS, promotes racist views, high national debt &amp; unemployment, economy in recession. Biden: Opposes Putin, COVID-19's real, fund Social Security &amp; USPS, fix tRump's blunders.
First of all, I think trump is very ignorant and prejudice.  He calls Joe Biden sleepy Biden, how immature.  When he speaks, 85% he is always looking down, not looking at his audience.  He a poor speaker.  Congress is afraid of him.   trump should be IMPEACHED!
In so many words i think Nancy is trying to become President without running. Biden os 75 he can take ill any day, they shouldn't be allowed to run that old. But, if Biden is out ,it will make Kamala President and Nancy vice.. Then we become Sweden...
Good prediction, attempts to justify it as "not controversial at the time" began last year, as though that's a good excuse
My concern was her constant stance against police reform and prison reform and pairing that with Joe Biden who was one of the main heads of the bill that helped create the mass incarceration system that we suffer from. But I could be wrong
45 will not win legitimately. We all know this. He has done too much to the election process for his win to be legitimate in any way.   If Biden doesn‚Äôt win then we must march on the capital. Otherwise America is gone forever.
Whats even more deeply hilarious is that youd expect progressives to vote for him, since in the primary biden said he doesnt need us to win. The 88% of his own party that wants mfa that he straight up said in his frail demented shell of a voice, that hed veto.
You should want both biden and trump to lose.
‚ÄúI asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room. To always tell me the truth, which she will. Challenge my assumptions if she disagrees. Ask the hard questions. Because that‚Äôs the way we make the best decisions for the American people.‚Äù             ‚Äî Joe Biden
Yeah, this is not a good look, DNC.    This is the perfect moment to test  influence with Biden. Have a few quiet words with Joe about this.  These machinations reek of old Democratic party hierarchy. Most of us have tossed such things into the dustbin of history.
If you can't see the writing on the wall you'll fall first... Biden is not going to be sitting President, hes 75, hes gonna succeed to Kamala. Making Nancy vice... Their gonna kill Trump kicking of the civil war. You herd it here first!!
Do you realize, Seen a man die, Gangster lean, and bone thugs Cross roads were made while Kamala and Biden were controlling the Justice system...i t was a time of great death.
If you have some critique of the Biden Harris ticket, buy one of their yard signs and write it on the back. Where you and no one else can see it.
Today's paper. Curious that the cover pic changed the blue fields to purple. Harris' suit; Biden's and THE FLAG. WSJ signals "no threat here" with injection of red into the print. I have mixed feelings about this.
To be fair, Obama is a really gifted speaker and had a slant/style especially suited to the times.   The Squad's recent results in primaries reinforce the idea that Biden is a transitional candidate - as he's said himself. Like AOC, I'm willing to accept the win.
Next: ‚ÄúMike Pence says Joe Biden wants to remove water from United States. You won‚Äôt have access to any kind of water in Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù
We have to survive as a country until Jan 3rd at noon when 45 is removed. I am fully confident Biden/Harris are winning the election in November ‚Äîbecause people are going to vote in huge numbers against Resident!
You did by capitulating to Biden, your great freind.
Opinion | Biden and Harris are the perfect rebuke to ‚ÄòMake America Great Again‚Äô
YO WE ALREADY LOST. BIDEN WAS THE VOTE FOR TRUMP. YOU DONT GIVE AWAY YOUR VOTE FOR NOTHING.
So part of this BS tactic is to instill fear that if Biden/Harris are elected and something happens to Biden‚ÄîNancy Pelosi has a chance at the presidency‚Äîsince (according to their misinformation) Harris is not eligible?
If Biden wins I‚Äôm definitely renouncing my citizenship.

You can expect more of Biden and Harris and still vote for them. JFC. You more woke than Angela Davis now? Politics make your head hurt too much and you‚Äôd rather have to be out on the street fighting? Vote.
Okay, fair enough. At least you're consistent. There are too many people who, without any apparent awareness of the irony, call Biden "Creepy Joe" while enthusiastically lining up to vote for the Donald.
Biden and Harris have exactly one job for the next 82 days: Win. We have one job: Help them.
Biden isn't accused of rape. He's accused of sexual harassment/assault. He's not "definitely a rapist."   Trump, on the other hand, has been sued for forcible rape of a 13 year old.
...evidence standard rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. Regardless of all of that, if the sexual harassment and abuse of the candidate were guiding my decision, it's abundantly clear that Biden would get my vote over Trump, who has COUNTLESS accusers.
Resident 45 has skipped over attacking Biden and moved on to racist&amp; sexist attacks on Sen. Harris. Drumpf is used to racist and/or sexist attacks. It is his go to method for avoidance of any responsibility
Fox News's Jeanine Pirro Spreads Conspiracy Theory Suggesting "Something's" Going to Happen Biden  ‚Å¶ has the same kind of ‚Äúsense‚Äù about Biden that ‚Å¶ had about COVID-19.   He‚Äôs going to ‚Äúmagically disappear‚Äù.

But we really need to regroup, this fight here is lost. The morality of our people here is just gone, in four years we won't even be able to have this conversation. Can you imagine what could happen if Biden dies in that White House and power is given to this Bay area Bitch.
For example, Kamala was for Medicare for all. Her speech today was about expanding the ACA. Why? It‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs policy. That‚Äôs the gig.
Since I read this tweet I can‚Äôt stop noticing how people are naming Biden and Harris üòØ  Was this also a thing for Clinton/Kaine? I honestly cannot remember üò•üò´
Folks: Harris is the VP. Biden is still top of the ticket. Talk about Biden‚Äôs policies if you want bc Harris will not have any independent policies  from here on. So discussing how progressive or not she is is wasting everyone‚Äôs time.
This might be worse than Joe Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù
Because when the next person gets put on the supreme court, if they‚Äôre hard right leaning conservatives will be the majority in the Supreme court for at least the next 20 years. With Biden, they‚Äôll probably be a least a centrist who‚Äôs vote will swing sometimes

Yes, I do hear what you are saying, but we have just two choices before us. Voting 3rd party gets us tRump again. Maybe it will make you feel righteous when you do it, but it won‚Äôt help the country. And tRump is more dangerous than Biden.
You are being 100% unrealistic. tRump guarantees destruction. Biden gives us a chance to move in the opposite direction. We need that chance or we are utterly doomed. We cannot survive more years of HairHitler. I want to live; I‚Äôm voting blue.
I‚Äôm getting flak from idiots who say we must vote 3rd party because Twitler and Biden are identical. Not sure how people can be that stupid and still function.
Scheduled for 2:50 PM Central, Democrats Joe Biden &amp; Kamela Harris to give first joint remarks as running mates; watch at
Twitler remaining in the White House will spell the complete destruction of American democracy. He MUST be stopped. Biden may not be ideal but he is a step toward what we desperately need. We are on the brink of complete evil.
The point is to prqgmatism, fuck elon musk as a person, you need to hold two thoughts in your head and look at your own infighting. Next thing youl tell me is to vote for neoliberal Biden.
Hey  - how did you get that cool Biden/Harris badge for your Twitter pic?
I also like Yang. I was just confused about your criticism of Bernie when Yang endorsed Biden way before Bernie. That's why I asked.
The significance of this decision for Black women, the loyal members of the Democratic Party, cannot be overstated. Black women‚Äôs commitment to the party has gone unacknowledged, but they have been tirelessly loyal to the Democratic Party for generations.
When people criticize Biden/Harris for things they have absolutely done to harm others, there is no fucking reason to say "well, it's all we got, so we don't have a choice".  THAT IS WHY WE ARE COMPLAINING!    We should never have to be in a position like this.
Ha - you think our country is ready for a president and first lady who truly love each other and want to be together?
Trump says it is an insult to men for Biden to pick a woman running mate
5 Takeaways On The New Biden-Harris Presidential Ticket
The first sentence threw me off - sounded like Biden was saying it would be a waste of time to get the virus under control. Then the second sentence made me think he was saying he would delegate the problem so he doesn‚Äôt have to waste his own time on it. Now I get what he meant.
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs choice of VP surprises Trump.‚Äù
I have a Biden/Harris yard sign and face mask headed my way! #merch
Finally!  made one decent decision by having  as the VP. My sidelined vote is finally shifting to democrats. Mrs Harris is smart, logical! She would destroy anyone in debates. Hell! She destroyed Biden in presidential debates! Exciting!!
Thank you for stating your stance. I disagree w/your opinion of Biden. Even with ethics concerns, he isn't a war criminal, will not encourage physical attacks on his fellow Americans or side w/racists. We can't have 4 more years of Trump. A Biden victory is the only hope we have.
Warren really simped to Biden for this lmao
I mean, it's a shit sandwich or a shit sundae.  Obviously I will vote for a Biden / Harris ticket, but I sure as fuck ain't happy about it.
McCain needed to swing for the fences. Biden just needed to not die before Election Day.
Of course Biden, who pioneered the 1994 Crime Bill, picked a cop to be his VP. It's all coming full circle...
Let‚Äôs get together and make demands Or they lose our vote. While Biden is not a great option he presents a somewhat reasonable future for us to actually be able to fix. We have to use the rights we fought for to gain the rights we deserve!
More women prison guards! Lets vote in sarah palin too!!! My brain is warped to ignore that biden wrote the crime bill qnd kamala is a cop. During the middle of the riots.
Well then ‚Äústatistically‚Äù Biden has already won the election...
If Biden/Harris lose then the haters will be like: ‚Äúsee, I told you they‚Äôre not electable‚Äù or ‚Äúomg! How did they lose?‚Äù  If they win, it burnish their ‚Äúleft creds‚Äù by complaining about it for the next 4 years and say, ‚Äúhey I was criticizing them from BEFORE they were elected!‚Äù
I‚Äôm upset. To think it couldn‚Äôt get worse than just Biden was a mistakeü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I wish she could debate 45 instead of Biden!
Any Democrat, or person who would normally vote for Biden, but now instead will vote "Green party" because of Kamala Harris being picked as VP, I just say this to you:  Donald Trump thanks you for your support.
For the record, I'll vote for Biden / Harris in November.  I'm very depressed by that, but I've decided that if Trump &amp; the GOP win - it's 100% game-over for the planet &amp; a triumph for ruthless white power authoritarianism. #Election2020 #GOP #FascistTrump #ClimateChange #MAGAts
I say we work to put Biden/Harris in the White House and also take back the Senate. Then we strong arm Schumer and put Warren in as Senate Majority Leader.
Biden: "I will pick a woman!"  Chris: "I wonder what that means for my chances?"
He takes the exact opposite lesson he should here. The endorser of biden. Got you nowhere did it.
Reasonable and unsurprising choice.
So I guess the Biden / Harris campaign will be  Back the Blue ... ... ... ... wave.  #BidenHarris2020 #bidenvp #crimebill #topcop #KamalaIsaCop #sad #Democrats #Election2020

‚ÄúJoe Biden here. Big news: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate.‚Äù #BidenVP
Drop that VP name Biden....I‚Äôm ready to see who it is going to be
I feel like the conventional wisdom is (was?) that the VP narrative had become toxic for Biden (e.g., he's "late" because he's "not happy") but meanwhile nobody on twitter dot com can stop talking about how excited they are to hear his pick and talk about his pick and...
OK Joe Biden has picked his running mate now either shit or get off the pot quit dragging it out tell us already
. is the youngest  delegate in #Illinois. He talked to  about casting his vote remotely, as the Democratic National Convention approaches.
So unless the Biden campaign is going to throw a fast one on everyone, looks like it'll be Susan Rice or Val Demmings for the VP pick.
I expect Harris will be the Attorney General in a Biden Administration
So the list of speakers at this year‚Äôs Democratic National Convention have been announced and it includes slots for the running mate &amp; for Whitmer, Warren, Harris, Bottoms, and Duckworth. So, my guess is Biden is picking Susan Rice
who on the Biden team thought it was smart to send this tweet out?
He is actively working with Republicans in swings states to steal votes from Biden.  I take offense to that.  If Trump wins it's to his benefit.  He's a millionaire, he'll bask in the tax breaks. Don't be fooled into thinking he cares about you or this country.   Cancel this man.
But Trump‚Äôs deferral of employee payroll tax, for workers making less than $104,000 does real damage. It takes away hundreds of billions of dollars from Social Security. It helps precisely no one who is unemployed, since you have to be employed.
Perspective | With Biden likely to pick a Black woman as VP, here‚Äôs how the media can avoid playing into sexist and racist tropes
I want Joe Biden to win. I‚Äôll vote for him regardless of who he chooses as his VP. This is a make or break election. Ejection of the current occupant is paramount. There are other critical spots to fill, as well. We need sisters on the Supreme Court and Cabinet.
This is the DNC list of speakers, not necessarily knowing who Biden has picked.
Yet his handlers call Biden's faculties into question. Sad.
I mean unless Biden chooses Satan I don't - well...no even then still the better choice.
He probably has a slam for all of them ready to go soon as they announce Biden‚Äôs running mate
Saw my first ‚ÄúRepublicans for #biden‚Äù yard sign today.  Hope springs eternal.
Doubling down on a comm strategy that contestably but systemically fell short in 2016, when Biden's relative polling 2020 against Trump is not much better than where Hillary was in 2016, is inadvisable. There are alternatives, such as solidarity in action with struggling people.
I'm there.  Can't wait to have a cocktail out in public with those who helped Biden win and then kicked the virus in the ass.  I'm in the retribution camp.  I want Kamala as VP because I think she'll want to set an example and not 'heal' or 'move on', and push Joe to do so.
It‚Äôs not a zero-sum choice for everyone in terms of effect. This isn‚Äôt to say that anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to vote for Biden should vote for Biden (not voting for gross sex offending dudes is a pretty good moral line IMHO), but don‚Äôt act like there aren‚Äôt consequences to that.
(Cont from previous thread) I‚Äôm going to say Trump benefits. And I‚Äôm probably going to lose an absolute shitload of follows (and that‚Äôs fine), but‚Ä¶I mean, fuck Biden, I wanted Sanders or further left, but, as a trans person? Who‚Äôs in office actually matters some to me.
...without printing money? Yes. Does that mean we shouldn't do it? Of course not, those people need help and it's not their fault. We're prosperous enough to take this on the chin if we have good, smart leadership. Is that a good reason to vote Biden &gt; Trump? Yep. The idea...
Worse, that we leave ourselves open to manipulation. We create a space that amplifies the message ‚Äúfuck the current system, fuck Trump, fuck Biden, R &amp; D are the same‚Äù really, really loudly and consistently, but we also close ourselves off from the local‚Ä¶
And this isn‚Äôt me saying that I want TERFs in my timeline or conservatives or a shitload of conciliatory liberals or Never Trump Republicans. But my timeline went from, for example, a mix of people who will and won‚Äôt vote for Biden to basically no one who will vote for Biden.

That best be false. You think true Americans like the squad and Biden are worth the time harrassing. Their mindset is mine. The only difference is that your bullshit whining doesn't get the coverage when you address me. You are attention whores. Just calling you out on that.

Are we sure about that? I know that's the narrative I just don't know a single reason to think it's true. She doesn't do well with the groups Biden needs more of (youth, Latinos), and couldn't even make it to Iowa in the primaries. Sorry to sound like such a naysayer.

I will continue to donate donate donate to Lincoln Project and Joe Biden. Keep my family and friends updated with trump corruptions by texts and social media so they don‚Äôt hv too watch 24/7 like me.
Joe Biden needs to get on with it and make his VP pick. Yes he is going to upset some people by going against is word not picking a black woman.  Things happen.  Take the criticism and move on dude. We have an election to win in November.  So make a decision Sir.
Dippy Every country prefers Biden, except Russia
I could only vote for Biden if he selected the right brand of paper bag.  (sarcasm font implied)
We need GOV Andrew Cuomo at the top of our ticket. He would put Trump in his place. Biden needs to get outgage. They are stealing the election.
Was has Biden, Pelosi, schumer done for the last 35-40-50 years?!
Biden says Trump executive order is 'a reckless war on Social Security'
ü§£üòÇdo you honestly think that Trump supporters will be united under Biden???üòÇü§£ like hell we will!
Biden touches little girls. Enough said
Guys I found Biden‚Äôs boat parade:
Trump said Biden ‚Äòhurt God.‚Äô Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith.
Just like impeachment was a way to deflect attention from Biden-Burisma, this lame statement from an Obama/Clapper holdover reeks of political obfuscation, an attempt to discredit Senate GOP investigation into Biden‚Äôs extensive dealings in Ukraine
The more you read this, the worse it gets. It sounds a lot like the dossier‚Äîpolicy and political disagreements portrayed as ‚Äúelection interference.‚Äù The bit about Russia is intended to make Biden appear tough on the Kremlin, and the citation about Derkach raises red flags:
Hay Kamala, NewsFlash, that‚Äôs what President Trump has been sooo g for the last 31/2 years!  sent the jobs to China! China OWNS Biden, all of the Biden‚Äôs!
This guy is just a idiot! Everyone time he opens his mouth he shows everyone how dumb he is! Just like last night, claiming Biden was going to take your guns and God from you. How stupid! Now he is going to force insurance companies to cover, what Obamacare already covers! Dumba‚Äî
We can‚Äôt keep taking from the land without giving something back. Big mining companies just want to take, them leave the devastation for future generations to worry about. Biden is right. Find other good ways for people to make a living.
If Trump gets his groove back‚Äîhis resiliency is remarkable and undoubtedly infuriates his foes‚Äîcalls to replace Biden will begin. It‚Äôs one thing for Biden to ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù against a president on the ropes from corona/crash/race war. It‚Äôs another to take on a reinvigorated Trump.
CNN avoids on-air coverage of Biden's 'Are you a junkie?' remark about taking a cognitive test
Ohhh but he does.. the racist, crook Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt give a damn about the little people..he made his son and brother millionaires.. btw, Trump was a billionaire and his family were millionaires BEFORE he ran for office.. name me one kind or generous thing Biden did for any1?!
After a bad week for Biden, discredited US media dusts off the Russian election interference fable:
If you think Trump has outsmarted all of them, then you're in for a surprise when Biden does beat him.  You've no clue how Hillary, Barack, Nancy, &amp; Chuck just took Donald to the woodshed.
"Yo you know what SUCKS? Fucking Energy"  - Joe Biden, I guess
Trump claims Biden is more powerful than god.
No one should be surprised that Andrea Mitchell referred to Biden campaign as Team Obama. ‚Å¶ nailed it here:
Donald Trump should not hold his breath waiting for African American voters to swing over to his side.  A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll showed that Joe Biden has 80% of the African American vote to Donald Trump's 6%.98% of Biden voters simply want to save what's left of our democracy.
If you think Biden and Trump are the same please unfollow me. fucking brain dead take
He‚Äôs ridin‚Äô with Biden ü§£üöóüöôüèé
I‚Äôm just ready for a president who‚Äôs is calm and collected! He‚Äôs hears a conversation and than goes on a tangent as if he‚Äôs an expert! He claims to be more knowledgeable than #dranthonyfauci ! #newamerica #Biden #justsaying
Clearly Biden knows that too... last speaker is Highest Honor! We must make sure it's covered! #MediaCoverYangSpeech
For everyone that was upset at Yang not being on the schedule, I raise a different scenario. Many democrats would do anything to be the last speaker. My guess there was a lot of in fighting going on to be that speaker. Yang was not even trying to be. That points to Joe Biden.
This is the highest honor. There's no way this happens without Joe Biden wanting it so. It is important that we in the Yang gang start applying pressure now to all the media outlets, They dare not cut away to a pundit  Or commercial while he speaks!!!
Heidi you have a lot of followers in the Yang gang... It is imperative that we start applying pressure now that the media not cut Yang off with commercials or puandits before Biden speaks.
I am not surprised. Do you remember how Andrew blew the doors off at those state convention speeches? Remember Biden was in the audience waiting his turn.
I am having a recurring dream that I wake up and we have a lifeless puppet for president and then I see Biden is really running for president and I scream but no one can hear me.
The middle wouldn‚Äôt vote left. Biden will keep the house and get the White House. Depending on how badly Trump derails, senate may be in play. Policies aside, people are tired of the train crash episode. It was interesting for a bit, but covid and incompetency was the nail.
I know all of you are a little partisan, this you substantially underestimate the 2-6% in all of those states that voted trump before knowing he was a conman. They‚Äôve given up. It‚Äôs over. He can‚Äôt get them back. And Biden will win. A lot of noise until then.
Biden is the ultimate teacher of political plagiarism.
Andrew Yang now has the BEST speaker slot of all... the LAST speaker before the Candidates!  Surely Biden had some role in this...  Bodes well for the Cabinet Appointment, No?  AWESOME.
HOLY CRAP! He went from forgotten to the FINAL SPEAKER BEFORE THE CANDIDATES! No Higher Honor! Folks... I gotta think Biden had some say in this! Awesome!
And Biden is not even saying no.
I warn progress and trump ain‚Äôt it. And Biden you actually have a say.
Assuming you're talking about Astead's piece, havent read it yet. We're on a path to serious conflict. Idk if Biden fully realized the optics of declaring himself a bridge to the future, then tabbing someone who's clear about wanting to inherit. Left needs a media strategy badly.
#jeninepiro if you have knowledge of Biden being in danger that has to be reported. Or threats you are making.
Trump answers all questions answerable.Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt take one softball question because it wouldn‚Äôt make sense. He was given the questions ahead of time at one of his great outdoor adventures from the basement and ended telling us on camera what he was told ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
By R/T'ng Biden advisers?  That is all you have?  Get back to me when Vecchio has a speaking slot at a Biden rally or something like that.
Anyway... Biden's advisors appreciated Guaido's interview.
If not, Guaido should lobby Biden.  Moreover, Maduro has refused to negotiate since April/ May because he thinks Biden will win and he'll bless his fake elections with the mesita.  It unlocks the game for Biden to pour cold water on this.
I don't care about Martinez.  I want Guaido to lobby Biden to be on Guaido (and therefore Venezuela's side.)  There is a significant chance that Biden wins.  Do you want Guaido to be thrown under the bus and for Fal$on to be sitting in the Oval Office next year?
And it is very important for people like Vecchio and Guaido to have a seat in Biden's inner circle so that Martinez doesn't promote fake elections.
The difference is Trump is the  " president " and it is his job Biden is just a candidate and probable next president and has no obligation yet
Biden doesn‚Äôt take questions. Does Biden disavow ANTIFA? Does any democrat?  Idiots
And?  Guaido has asked Naim for advice.  Martinez is concerning but if you want a Biden administration to support Guaido instead of the mesita, then you better make sure Martinez feels pressure to remain on Guaido's side.
Yes.  I do.  I don't see them openly campaigning for Biden.  Ravell only really has opinions on Venezuelan politics as does Castillo.  And Carla Angola has good contacts in the Trump administration.
Biden shouldn't listen to a word Ben Rhodes says...  He's an idiot.
The Obama people are jerks and didn't believe in Biden in 2020.  Obama was rooting for Sanders.
Been nightmares every night since Trump got elected. Our cities are burning and people are dying from a pandemic that he mishandled. I‚Äôll take my chances on Biden rather than certain disaster with Trump.
The campaign begins (again)  via
Biden is 3 years older than Donald. Where do Donald, and his minions, get off accusing Biden of being too old?  The SKelly cartoon is despicable, and I demand the Tribune own up to that now!
Yes, but then back to the UFO's after Biden victory!
I blocked her and Joe Biden so their tweets don't show up on my timeline.
The 30-something liberal snowflakes whining about this could go to the polls and vote in person.  Exposure to a disease that likely won't kill you for a few minutes to vote early in an election and make sure Biden wins big on election night isn't the end of the world.
If the "day of" vote count is a landslide for Biden, it should be game over.
Hey, Molly... Biden wasn't my first choice, but he's certainly not "the lesser of two evils" !!
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He‚Äôs the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes
What happens if Biden wins?  Guaido might not be able to get lobbying and diplomatic pressure from a Biden administration if he campaigns for Trump.  Not to mention that Guaido needs Biden right now to unlock the game by throwing cold water on the fake elections.
You don't like the choice between trump and Biden?  Then how about choosing a decent person  Novel idea, I know, but boy do I miss decent.  So does the entire world.
Barack Obama: I've been to 57 states and I have one more to go.  Joe Biden: I've been to one state and have 57 to go.
If you want to be able to cast another ballot in 2024, vote for Biden.
That's my idea for why not voting for Biden is justifiable. You want the Dems to move left so you make them work for your vote.
Everyone who can't see a difference between Trump and Biden should just keep talking to each other on Twitter. Absolute buffoons.
"two point shift"? that's usually within the margin of error, and IMO doesn't justify an explanation. What's more interesting is the sheer size of the Trump-Biden gap, though we're still ~3 months out
The issue is the opposition descending into backbiting like they always do and the international community growing bored.  I haven't heard a lot from Biden's team or his campaign surrogates about Venezuela strategy, which concerns me that he might be open to fake elections.
There is a difference. Voting for Trump in 2016 caused this entire mess we‚Äôre in. Appreciate the Biden vote now
As long as Mitch is feeling good about things, the rest of the county does not matter.  However, great campaign fodder for Biden, McConnell sends the Senate home for vacation during this mess.  --&gt; Dereliction of duty by the GOP, again.
The Pod Bros are tools and I would totally promise to vote for Biden if he disses Ben Rhodes and the rest of them.
I can‚Äôt wait for Biden to go on Cumtown next month.
Ralph Nader didn't put W in the White House. Kerry had a busted story - war hero/anti-war veteran/war hero to fight terror. So he got Swiftboated because when your story's broke your enemy defines you. Thank God Biden's got a tight narrative - decent man in time of indecency.
That is literally what Biden said.  Outside means outside.  Also, what does "alone" constitute in your mind?  If I am walking on a sidewalk in a shopping area should I wear a mask?
Jogging with a mask on or walking a dog outside with a mask on is exactly what Biden just said...  That is what wearing a mask outside means.  And that is ridiculous.
I don't like Biden all that much either but right now in America the only choices are bad or worse. In the end, when no other choice is presented, I will always take the lesser of the bad.
This is about the debates. Notice that he says 3 months. When the debates begin (September) Biden will say that Trump is responsible for 10,000 deaths because he ignored Biden‚Äôs mask advice in August. In October he‚Äôll say 20,000. This is all debate positioning.
yeah, I think I'm hearing you say biden gives us some breathing room... which I'm definitely sympathetic to
Hi.  I'm religious.  I'm OK with Biden-Harris.  Who were you talking about exactly?  Oh, I'm a liberal Jew.  You didn't mean me, right?  Because leftists who self-identify as religious don't count?
ok, I was confused before. now I know *why* I'm not voting for biden.
Misogyny and a 25 year campaign against HRC was a big player last time. They saw two equally awful evils. Hoping there is more clarity and less misogyny (Biden‚Äôs a dude) this time.
Plus, it‚Äôs all just so....tawdry and sad.  Who needs to even know this anymore?  Let‚Äôs just elect Biden, chalk it up to experience, and move the F on.
Correction: Our country IS collapsing now. We must elect Joe Biden.
If you disagree with someone, fine. But I am irritated with this trope about anyone who is not wild about Biden is a Russian agent. That's so dopey 50's-McCarthyite. Come on.

I used to be critical of Kamala Harris. Now I am going to defend her at every turn
Hey, is it clear yet that if you don't vote for Biden, there's a good chance you won't ever have a chance to vote again?
Those bishops who are OK with Biden receiving the Eucharist are guilty of scandal and demeaning the Eucharist.
The messaging I am seeing from the Trump campaign is stunningly bad/unprofessional. Trying to paint Biden-Harris as wild-eyed radicals?? That dog won‚Äôt hunt.
This is a Republican pollster and a 4 point improvement for Biden from June with them.
Of course DOJ should but Biden shouldn't go anywhere near that decision.
Biden shouldn't be anywhere near that decision.
So USA üá∫üá∏ should elect Biden,To solve your issues?
I only know that YOU, trump, have done nothing for anyone but yourself and your rich friends, so don't tell me what Biden is going to do. He is a decent man. Can you say that about yourself?
Next week  is speaking at the  Read his message about why  was the right person to join  on the ticket.
Voting non Dem is a Trump vote Voting non GOP is a Biden vote  So it cancels out  See how easy this is? You fucking goons
Silly man Biden did not pronounce her name correctly
Is this supposed to be consistent with the Fox commentator predicting that Biden won't be on the ticket come November?
The fact that y‚Äôall really think you can pull the race card on Biden/Harris like Trump/Pence isn‚Äôt overtly racist is dumbfounding
Biden couldn't build a Lego tower in his current state. gtfo
This attack would be borderline cute but for the fact that Trump has stonewalled funding to modernize the northeast corridor‚Äòs transportation infrastructure ‚Äî one of the few areas of broad bipartisan concern ‚Äî and Biden is likely going to win 99% of the Amtrak employee vote.
2 means to me &amp; my wife, and what it will mean to our grown children when they reach retirement age.  Biden/Harris 2020
This ticket! ü•∞ #BidenHarris
Biden derangement syndrom smh.
Sorry, no one was watching!! There was more interesting news on MSNBC! BIDEN/HARRIS!!!
Yeah, I kind of agree.  Or just have one so the Repubs can‚Äôt accuse Biden of being scared of debating.
Ambassador Neumann, these are all good things but I think that more is needed from Biden.  Will you agree with me that Biden should declare against the fake parliamentary elections in December and also repudiate the "mesita"?
Venezuelans would have a lot more power if they demanded things from Biden as well as Trump...  Like demanded that Biden declares against the fake parliamentary elections.
That is why she was selected. Not because she is simpatico to Biden
She was not my first choice, but I now see my error.  She is the right choice.   One clue to her value to Biden is that the Trump campaign team's responses were confused and contradictory.   They have no effective counter message to Kamala, and she takes media time from Trump.
People do realize that Kanye West joined BLM in June and donated $2 million. Since then, he announced he is running to pull votes away from Biden to help Trump. It's not a far leap to think he is using his new BLM $$ influence to trigger new unrest which also helps Trump.
Vote for Joe Biden bc you have seen him, right in front of your face, on TV for 8 years.
Worthwhile reflection on the type of man  is: a Mensch [Verified by  as authentic, FYI] I Know Joe Biden: Rabbi Michael Beals
The eighth region in my Wisconsin breakdown series is Southwest Wisconsin. This was another frustrating region for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and one where Joe Biden will need to improve in 2020 if he's to win the state of Wisconsin. 1/4
Joe Biden thinks you can throw Kamala  out there
But Joe Biden thinks you can throw a Democrat out there
Someone else came up with it, but I like it. The condition for Biden to debate Trump is that Trump has to release his tax returns to the public.
Vote for Biden. Trump will continue to do nothing while Americans die. America will eventually become a developing country- we are already headed there.
‚Äúunder control‚Äù man u guys really dont want any of us voting biden lol
I wonder if Biden will make Kamala watch when he goes skinnydipping like he used to make his female Secret Service agents do.
As usual, think how the GOP would react if Biden (or any other Dem) stood up a fake campaign for a GOP candidate!  They would raise holy hell and impeach everyone. But it's okay for Jared to run this stupid operation, which he'll botch anyway.
Oh yes! Let‚Äôs see, I volunteer Fauci, Gates, Cuomo, Lightfoot, Pelosi, Newsome, Harris, Biden, Clinton family, Soros family, Rockefeller family, Rothschilds family and the rest of the zionists they work for, &amp; whoever actors aren‚Äôt killed off. criminals.

We‚Äôve been screaming abolish the police for the last two months and Joe Biden picked a fucking cop ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Pennsylvania is Biden. Not going red. The conman has caught up to Trump there with enough people.
I guess the lesson is that Biden is not a narcissistic psychopath like Trump. He doesn't believe he has all of the answers to every question.
Sen. Kamala Harris wasn't on my radar somehow for this election, but having looked into things now, I feel a lot better voting for her than for Biden, and her history as a lawyer bodes well for,  y'know... not committing crimes in office. #BidenHarris2020
Both Kamala &amp; Biden have a history of signing bills that only serve to continue to imprison, separate &amp; oppress us. Niggas haven‚Äôt had a chance to vote for someone decent since I turned 18 so far be it from me to be the one to tell anyone where there loyalties should lie
I love this! ‚ù§üá∫üá≤  Watch "Joe Biden releases first ad with Kamala Harris as his running mate" on YouTube
Burn all this shit to the ground   Idk g, but it‚Äôs definitely not as simple as ‚Äúa vote against Biden is a vote for trump‚Äù or any of the other colloquialisms used lately.
Stop telling black people that voting for Biden/Kamala is the MORAL choice, those who harm our communities will continue to keep doing so in positions of power
Kamala is a cop. Race and gender do not matter. Let's stop acting like the Biden/Harris ticket is exciting UNTIL they support M4A and Defunding the police
With apologies to The Wire and to Omar, ‚ÄúBiden don‚Äôt scare.‚Äù   Biden is a mature, confident person, comfortable in his own skin. It‚Äôs never been about Biden, it‚Äôs always about people and the country.   Not saying he‚Äôs perfect. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just need good. Or better.
Translation: The privileged racist white stay at home mom will be voting for me. They want their neighborhoods to stay exclusively white and keep minorities out. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Cory Booker in charge!
"This is a winning pick for the Biden campaign in every way imaginable."  Joe Biden's pick of U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his VP running mate may boost enthusiasm for him among Black voters, says Prof.
Trump would single out Booker because: 1) Trump is a lying idiot 2) Booker will be a powerful campaigner for Biden/Harris 3) Trump is completely ignorant 4) Maybe Trump got Booker and Ben ("Dr. HUD") Carson confused?
we are anti-all US presidents. the US empire shouldn‚Äôt exist + all US presidents have been evil war criminals, capitalists, white supremacists, and cops. trump is no diffferent than biden or obama at the end of the day, so we don‚Äôt see anything good abt identifying as anti-trump.
I‚Äôm certain Biden and the DNC had to heavily consider the best candidate based on SNL performances also.
I really hope they keep pushing this. Maybe it‚Äôll accidentally convince some of the ‚Äúbern it all down‚Äù crowd to get out and vote for the ‚Äúradical leftists‚Äù Biden/Harris.
I think that all Venezuelans, especially the US diaspora and  should lobby Biden and his advisers to come out against the December 6th farce elections in Venezuela.  This could help Guaido pressure Maduro into granting a delay and gaining conditions.
Believe me that single-payer isn't mainstream Democratic policy.  Free college for all isn't mainstream Democratic policy.  Biden won the Democratic primary while being against those things.
While voters don't pick their candidate based on their VP ,  can give the campaign just a little bit more mobility and range on left of center issues, and will help on messaging.  ( last night on #ChicagoTonight
I'd love to know what Biden's plan is (seriously).  I am legit afraid that he'd throw Guaido and the G4 under the bus in favor of the misfit toys in the "mesita" and endorse fake parliamentary elections like Chris Murphy seems to want to do.
Biden may be against sanctions, support fake elections, support the mesita, and throw Guaido under the bus.  That is the legitimate concern.
Do you think we will see Prince Harry campaigning for Joe Biden this year or is that a leap too far?
Biden is the top of the ticket. So it‚Äôs Trump or Biden? Pretty simple. Stop the nonsense
Sometimes the obvious needs to be pointed out.   The "racism" is on Laura Ingraham.  Kamala Harris is a proven vote getter in the the most populous state in the nation.  Joe Biden picked the candidate that would most help him get elected President.
Actually, Bill, that choice for VP actually hurts Biden and the Democrats. This is a woman who called Biden a sexist and racist and now they‚Äôre supposed to run together? Seriously? Do you think Harris is ready to run the country? I don‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs what will happen.
Finally some good news! Nearly a 20pt margin. Intraparty war is unavoidable with Biden's self-proclamation that he's just a bridge to the future.
Nothing against Maya Rudolph but I don't give a fuck that she may be getting more airtime because of Biden's VP pick.
My takeaway: it looks I have the same laptop as Biden. Wonder if he also has keyboard issue with his, and how he deals with it.
Great for POTUS within a smaller and shrinking group of people.  Great for Biden in a larger and expanding group of people.
"All the White Guys"??   Some of us White Guys are fine with Biden's choice.  Oh, I almost forgot, Biden is a White Guy.
Can you guys please lobby Biden's advisors to come out with a statement against the December 6th Parliamentary Elections?  I think that Biden could do a lot of good with a statement like that.  He could give Guaido leverage to get the farces postponed and get conditions.
I am delighted there is a Biden/Harris Ticket! Made my day.
Great! With Harris on the ticket, Biden will be easily defeated...
If you‚Äôre considering shaming people for not voting for BIDEN AND HARRIS, consider not doing that and instead helping the communities they‚Äôve helped ruin.  Y‚Äôall are too old to keep pretending Trump‚Äôs evil is responsible for everything wrong in the US or that it‚Äôs an anomaly.
Them: you picked  Biden: I told you it needed to be a woman, not dead fat wrestler!!! #toofar? #sorrynotsorry #icouldntresist #RIPKamalaWWE
Pretty soon I‚Äôm gonna read ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote out Trump by voting for Biden/Harris you‚Äôll be personally responsible for leaving those kids in cages!‚Äù and I‚Äôm gonna spontaneously combust
With all due respect: when was Joe Biden excommunicated? When he mourned his son? When he spoke up for women‚Äôs agency? Spoke against Barr, the Catholic who orders executions in high speed? Could you please expand so that we can all read it, and hear what you really mean to say?
#Kamala Honors to the strong women in Biden‚Äôs possible picks for VP. Their collective support of Kamala is honorable. Women in solidarity of each other. Trump‚Äôs stoogie remarks show how scared he is.
I would love to know Biden's position on the parliamentary "elections."  I think that both the EU and a potential Biden admin not throwing Maduro the lifeline he wants would be helpful.
I am a lifelong Democrat and would vote blue whoever &amp; I like Joe Biden, BUT VERY DISAPPOINTED IN HIS CHOICE OF KAMALA HARRIS. He wanted a "woman of color", which is fine, just thought there were others who would have been a better choice. Harris' record as prosecutor not good.
Not this white woman. Biden-Harris all the way
Nasty Women for Biden/Harris 2020 !!
Trump: If Biden wins, Americans will have to learn Chinese  via  if you win we‚Äôll have to learn Russian
Listen if Hamilton could endorse Jefferson then I can do my best to support Biden/Harris!
Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate: Where does she stand on economic issues? More
Two fake people running for President and V.P. , BIDEN"S been cloned and KAMALA replaced by a look alike.
NOW WE HAVE A CLONED JOE BIDEN WITH DEMENTIA AND A REPLACEMENT KAMALA HARRIS.  SHOULD BE INTERESTING!
And a sign that he is someone who is willing to listen and learn and grow. And also shows that Biden knows this isn't just about him. It's about all of us. Way different than Trump's approach and in the best possible way. He had my vote, and now he has even more of my respect.
Aside from everything else that is being said now by the "pundits," it shows that Biden is the anti-narcissist, without ego problems.   Here he picks someone who very personally attacked him during a debate! Can you even imagine Trump doing that?
#TRUMP2020 biggest landslide in Presidential Election history? Who, besides the careerless ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù, is going to vote for Joe fucking Biden??
Joe Biden did the dumbest move ever and now Trump is going to win again lmao

not ridin with biden LMAO
Biden/Harris is the best possible ticket. There will be nit-picking and criticism, but nothing is ever said about trump/Pence, and they are a total disaster. I'll take Biden/Harris any day of the week.She'll eat Pence alive in debates.... plastic man and the prosecutor... yeh!
Great choice. Biden-Harris!
boy Joe Biden really just helped out the big ten didn‚Äôt he
During the largest BLM movement and amid global riots and protests that haven't stopped for 3 MONTHS... Biden picks a cop for VP. Man Dems can fuck allllllllllll the way off
I think the odds are high that Biden will give Harris a lot to do since he was a VP and he‚Äôll have his hands full rebuilding our image abroad. But I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be a shoe-in for pres in 2024 as some suggest.
i for one imagine a world where biden sent AOC an invite to play ARAM and by ARAM i mean the presidency
Why are so many of us reporting we‚Äôre sitting around weeping with joy at Biden‚Äôs pick? God, we needed this at the end of this summer!!
Around this time of year reality sets in. In the spring you still have your ideals. By Sept. it‚Äôs clear there will be one person  victorious on 11/4: You wasn‚Äôt Trump or Biden? Given that‚Äôs the choice, what else can we do?
Easy for me to say, but in hearing what is going on inside postal service, its veterans need at every location to quietly hold meetings. Everyone should agree: whatever deJoy says, nod "Yes," &amp; do what must be done to maintain service. Biden will take care of you.
Not Joe Biden picking the devil Kamala
Not a surprising choice but I can't stand her for how she treated Kavanaugh.   So no way I vote Biden.
Biden/Harris - can't wait for my yard sign!!!
This tells me several surprising things about Biden--all of them good. 1. Unlike trump he doesn't hold grudges. 2. He can take criticism gracefully 3. He knows a kickass running mate when he sees one! #Kamala
Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs choice for VP.
BIDEN PICKS HIMSELF FOR VP #JoeJoe2020

Joe Biden isn't looking so good
Umm I'm Joe Biden
BREAKING Biden selects New Zealand president Jacinda Ahern as his running mate
Whoever Biden chooses, the media gauntlet of misogynist tropes and biases will be a given. Last week a slew of influential women wrote a letter to news orgs and  points out that it‚Äôs actually a BFD.
Isn't he a bit late to the party? Didn't Biden pledge to nominate a woman six months ago?
Will Biden condemn the Venezuelan "fake elections" in December and publicly support Guaido's strategy?  Because the fact that WOLA and other left leaning think tanks staffed by Obama alums keep demanding that Guaido support the "mesita's candidates" in them is worrying.
Why not have a transvestite as a V.P. for biden. We had a Transvestite as a first Lady (Michelle).
... He's speaking Thursday before Biden.
I really can't imagine why Trump thinks he'll do well debating Biden... Biden isn't the most eloquent speaker - we know that - but at least he can string together a sentence or two that are intelligible, unlike Trump.
So impressed that America's religious community has taken the Allman Bros response to Trump's attack on Biden's Catholicism I ain't here a wond'rin' why But I'll live on and I'll be strong 'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear
congratulations to Biden Veep pick Baby Nut
If you all can't wait for Biden to pick a VP, how are you going to wait for mail-in ballots to be counted? Do a jigsaw puzzle, for God's sake.
From experience: be very careful what jokes you make about Biden‚Äôs potential VP pick. What you do today will haunt you annually in your facebook memories.
Despite my best intentions -- visiting the CNN website to see if Biden has officially announced Susan Rice yet -- I need to make sure I don't visit CNN's website again.
Not quite the same. Biden isn't killing Americans and golfing while we die.
What he posted isn't complete (Buttigieg is speaking Thursday) and if Biden picks a VP who is scheduled for a different night, they'll just change the schedule. Organizers have no idea who the pick is so they schedule everyone.
Not that my opinion matters, but Biden can take as long as he wants. They're not choosing drapes. They can take their time and get it right.
#AGBarr wants the law to be his guide not politics.That's why he is so slow? I guess he wants to do indictments after November 3, to show how apolitical he is. Let me guess how long he will be AG after that day? Biden will kick his ass out AFAP back to retirement #realDonaldTrump
it makes me sick to think that the nu students who vocally supported Biden from the outset are getting the last laugh
Evers performed better than Clinton almost everywhere in this region. Biden would like to match Evers' margin here or even get closer to Baldwin's 22 point win in this region. Trump would be thrilled to match his 2016 margin. 4/4
The seventh region in my Wisconsin breakdown series is the Madison Exurbs. This was one of the most disappointing regions for Hillary Clinton in 2018 and one where Joe Biden must improve the most in 2020 if he's to win the state of Wisconsin. 1/4
LOL.  I think that the Lincoln Project thinks that if Biden wins he is going to hand over the GOP to them like this is Venezuela.  Sorry about that guys.  How about form your own party, although bitter ex Jeb! advisors, doesn't seem to have much appeal?
Anybody who doesn't plan on using it to gain an advantage towards being the nominee in 2024. That primary should be won on its own merits, not the whims of Biden's selection committee.
It's here, fans of  - my interview with the inimitable   We talk: - the value of moving to the sticks  - politics - messaging - how feminism and conservatism can co-exist - Biden, Trump, RBG and ACB.    #OwnTheNarrative
He will be an important voice in a Biden Cabinet...
So far... Joe hasn't taken the bait. Instead he hit from the flank... pointing out Trump is killing Social Security!  Trump tries to set a tax trap for Biden
Rebel? Then Trump wins... it ain't about Biden.
These are Joe Biden voters.
I am voting for Biden. I will be extremely happy if Andrew Yang can get a high cabinet position.
Is Bides the casual way of referring to Biden for people who are the sons of men who say thigh land?
I believe Joe Biden is right. Provide the DOJ is headed by right person.  Someone like Karmal Harris.
But is iruth?  It is truth! Biden doesn't deserve then be president! And I do not support him!
I disliked Hillary more than I disliked Trump but now I'm just hoping our Union survives this idiot so we can start repairing the Political and Social divide that he widened. I don't want Biden but I want Trump less. What a state for our country huh? Sad.
You should have been on Biden‚Äôs shortlist.
If the ventriloquist puppet doesn't have Trump‚Äôs knee to sit on, he won't know what words to parrot-except fake Bible passages. Biden will rise to the occasion.
On which of these do you agree with your  Carving his face on Mt. Rushmore Selling Puerto Rico Biden can hurt God
Trump's Delusions.   --He wanted to buy Greenland --He wanted to sell Puerto Rico --Biden will hurt God --He wants his face carved on Mt. Rushmore Has there ever been a president so delusional?
Do the Dems offer a language course on Biden-speak?
Demanding people vote for Biden despite not agreeing w/ him on many issues is your own version of a purity test. If people aren't willing to go with the party, then they don't pass. People are individuals making decisions based on what they value. Respect the process.
What? Did joe Biden tweet this way off base comment that holds no truth what so ever? seriously when u just randomly scream shit on the internet, it usually doesn‚Äôt get air time, However factual, rationale with concise thoughts helps! Good luck, we hope u all wake up!
Any normal person would quit.  But Biden is koo koo. What about RNC? They r  koo koo too  O, yeah they r going to cheat, actually they are cheating already But this is not cheating in elementary school this is very serious. Dems playing with fire!
Trump: Biden will destroy God with anarchist lightning from his electric guitar! Biden the next day: Now kids, ya gotta stay off the devil's lettuce!
Empty promises. All Biden.What Democrats have going for them is an incomparable group of grassroots organizers who have boundless energy and that will work tirelessly to help elect Joe Biden. Case in point:
To be able to represent the Asian American population and younger generation as the youngest Joe Biden delegate in IL has been a privilege.   With the DNC Convention being this week, I can‚Äôt wait to see the diversity of our party unite to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
MEDIA: "How many nasty digs at President Trump can we put in his brother's obituary?"  Meanwhile, Biden-Harris supporters: "Let's get #wrongtrump trending."  You all deserve each other.
DAILY REMINDER: BIDEN IS THE REAL RACIST
Dodged a hell of a bullet when Biden didn‚Äôt pick her.
Because Dems feel by choosing her..they have the African American woman vote locked. How can anyone any color but especially African American identify with or want to vote for Biden? He says..."You're not black if you don't vote for me" ummm racist much? BLM the "organization"
It would be a mistake of historically epic proportions for Biden to avoid debating Trump.  Nearly the only card Trump has left is: "see-Biden-really-is-brain-dead." If Biden avoids debates, that becomes a totally reasonable inference.
Lmao there‚Äôs a house decorated in Biden‚Äôs face throughout the house and Biden supporters don‚Äôt wanna admit that they worship him. replace ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù with ‚Äútrump‚Äù and that should be enough proof that trumpies worship the fat orange&lt;3

Win in a ‚Äúlandslide??‚Äù You can believe he will win - I honestly never thought it was possible for him to beat Hillary but he did obviously. But to say it will be a ‚Äúlandslide‚Äù victory over Biden/Harris just isn‚Äôt likely no matter your belief system   ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
False victim mentality..do some research on the actual BLM organization. Funded by the Democratic party. Biden didn't want Harris as his running mate, he wanted a white man who was more qualified actually. But Biden, just like Obama..is a race baiter. He ONLY chose her because
It also allows for more ideas to get seriously considered. The way it stands now, I have to vote Biden. He‚Äôs the closest candidate for me. We just need to keep demanding more once he‚Äôs in office. At least there is a chance of that with him. I don‚Äôt see us surviving Trump again
Nah. That‚Äôs some sh!t bitter Sanders supporters made up to make themselves feel better about not getting out to vote for him. The candidates who dropped out, did so bec. they knew they didn‚Äôt have a chance. They rallied around Biden bec. The goal is beating trump.
Join the Trump train  It will only get worse under biden trust me socialism and communism does not work!!!  Idk if you know but yesterday  endorsed #Trump2020! We need to #DrainTheSwamp it‚Äôs still kicking back!

I'ma Holla' 4 Kamala While I'm Ridin' Wit Biden.
Ironically,Biden is the racist. PLENTY of evidence over the years. A LOT! Democrats are a hypocritical joke.
Well, kinda hard when Biden was not taking any questions from reporters.
That can't be true. Tim Walz was already demanding justice less than 24 hours later. Same with Joe Biden.
And like I said, I consider myself to be moderate. Not left or right. I don‚Äôt like Biden or trump. It says more about you than it does me that you degrade me for asking completely reasonable and logical questions. Again, who is the sheep. Why do you ‚Äúcritical thinkers‚Äù question
Can you point me to facts about Kamala giving BJs to get promoted? I don't like Biden or Kamala, but I dislike Trump more than both of them. But this BJ thing sounds like something Trump might have mumbled. There's no way this can be proven, yet it's one of your argue points?

at this point, i probably will vote for joe biden, purely on the basis of climate + USPS. but you are delusional to think there is ever a way to ‚Äúpush him left‚Äù or ‚Äúhold him accountable‚Äù. marxists, as a whole, should refocus completely on their local sphere. where they work...
I'm a republican,  sad to say, at this point,  I am voting for Biden, at this point there is nothing,  and I mean nothing the Democrats can throw at us that Trump has'nt already thrown.
I think Biden should have an essentially canned script ready if Trump starts roaming. I'll leave the words to experts, but I would say:  What exactly are you doing, Don? Stay in your lane. If you want people to respect you, you have to respect them. And no one respects you.
Hmm. I just noticed that you are beautiful. Well, maybe I‚Äôll vote for Biden after all. I‚Äôm easily influenced. Yes, we will see in November. I just hope that there‚Äôs no (legitimate) dispute over the results. That‚Äôs the last thing we need.
In fact it‚Äôs stunning how shameless the Biden campaign was about it‚Äôs tokenistic criteria for VP.
It'll catch up with him &amp; once Biden is sworn in, that hit Trump with charges, then Pence can't pardon him &amp; Biden won't.
He is bad and has a record of horrific fuck ups, dude. Biden is garbage but under Trump‚Äôs America, we are collapsing.
Joe Biden supporters in Chicago love to be silent about Lori Lightfoot doing the same exact shit Trump does
Biden did seem to improve as the pool of opponents got smaller.
He‚Äôs busy doing what his followers seem unable to do ‚Äî getting over the primary and working to get Biden elected.

The odds they are a Biden voter is only less than 100% because they probably think he's not far enough left
Pretty sure Biden could be elected solely on a platform of banning tail grab games from Fall Guys
Removed mailboxes, lock other up, removing trucks. What next? All I can say is, they handed Biden/Warren something else they can go on while they campaign &amp; on a silver platter. This all will backfire in his face.
Right again!  Biden needs to answer the questions. He is showing his weakness, and i hope it hurts him November 3rd
I vividly remember a Biden moment from 2016. It was Biden speaking extemporaneously during the doomed Hillary campaign and just ripping Trump. Ripping him. (On mortgages or something.)  I wish I could find it and send it to  Because that's the Biden I want to see.
I see no way Biden wastes political capital doing that. See Jimmy Carter
I will drive my Biden vote to Washington DC if I had to
I read something today in the big Biden Politico story, so it was a quote from an in-the-know person. I paraphrase:  "Never underestimate the ability of Joe Biden to royally fuck up."  As I say, I am petrified.
I think opinion has soured on Abrams for now. And Biden isn‚Äôt spending political capital on a new cabinet office
You are not alone in finding this whole thing repugnant.  I don't like Trump.  (I am also not crazy about Biden true).    What you are seeing is that "Trump Derangement Syndrome" is VERY real, not just a Fox talking point or something.  Some folks go crazy if the prez is not a D

"I really don't care" was written at a time when the media was obsessing over whatever the fuck Mellannia wore.  She was not caring about that.  As for the kids in cages Obama and Biden started that, and even that is still misleading.
THE BIDEN PLAN TO BUILD BACK BETTER BY ADVANCING RACIAL EQUITY ACROSS THE AMERICAN ECONOMY
So throw out trump votes for being late. Only count biden votes. No more delivering mail to senators involved in mail suppression or the white house. Problem will be solved If they don‚Äôt feel it; they will never learn.
Interesting. Thank you. Myself, I am absolutely petrified for Biden. I think Harris will do very well.
Joe Biden damn near 80, what tf??? We honestly don‚Äôt need these old ass people running the U.S lmfaooo
What would make a vet vote for Biden? That‚Äôs strange
Trump stokes fear. Biden and Harris can raise hope.
White House does not believe she is a legal candidate. I agree. The Dems are having fits that this would even be an issue. Comrade Cammy is speaking if she was the Presidential candidate. Where's Biden? This is the most illegal race I have ever seen.
Vote for Biden they said. Don‚Äôt worry! We will simply push him left once he is in office they said. üôÉü§°

I‚Äôm absolutely voting Joe Biden in November! #JoeBiden2020
We stand together black and white we are all equal let's get out their and vote and get the right man in office that cares about the middle class and the lower classes time for us to make a change and stand together as one Biden for President
Biden already picked his VP. You can stop now.
The CCP is the reason so many people died. That was Hunter Biden‚Äôs employer until a few months ago.
That's where you are wrong and it will be the biggest miscalculation of the Century for the Democratic Party. Blacks don't come out to vote AGAINST someone, just FOR someone. And they are not excited about Biden-Harris. They won't go out JUST to defeat Trump. lol
If "Judge" Joe Brown supported Biden no one would give a fuck, but if he appears hypercritical of Biden he gets a ton of traction on here. It‚Äôs pretty open &amp; shut.
Michelle Obama to go to bat for Biden  #ForThePeople
And it‚Äôs weird to think that there‚Äôs more distance between Jimmy Carter and Joe Biden today as it was from Hoover to 1960 Nixon
Yeah pressuring Biden who's even less accessible should go great.

No number of ICE abuses during the past 3.5 yrs can cure the horrors that took place under the Obama/Biden administration. And they won't end until all are held to account, regardless of party.  But I strongly agree, we do need a better immigration system.
Who says Biden will be there yo make decisions?
I‚Äôll bet Biden next to go in death pool. Vegas has it at -220 lol.
It‚Äôs not going to be Biden/Harris on the ticket.  The Dems have another plan, later.
If the DNC and Biden/Harris want to really drive him insane, they should invite Obama to speak each time Trump speaks. Then watch the media drop Trump and go to Breaking News: Obama Is Speaking to the Nation!!
You falsely claim without evidence that something is wrong with Biden, but you‚Äôre not concerned about an individual capable of this soliloquy?
where is LITTLE CANNONS JUSTICE? where is the news running there mouths? Why is Cannon not all over the fricken news all over the world? where are you Biden? Kamala? Fake ass MFs !!!!

Are you asking Biden:Harris what they‚Äôre gonna do? Does political track record actually give you any confidence that they won‚Äôt make this a police state just like Trump? That they won‚Äôt cut social services? Y‚Äôall want more detailed plans from people done with a broken system
As soon as he speaks, the polls will go up for Trump. Biden has a history of saying the wrong thing.
Hillary was the subject of a smear campaign that went on for years. Biden does not have that problem. Biden wisely chose a person of color for his running mate. This excites the Democratic base in a way that Tim Kaine could not. Our turnout will be better this time.
Biden has a longer history of lying.

They are HIDIN BIDEN because he has a long history more making verbal gaffes and lying to destroy his presidential aspirations. Biden's history of lying...
How many questions has Biden taken these past few days? Um! Um! Come on man! You know the thing.
True. However, they are corporatists just like the Republicans. Biden pisses on progressives.
The BS has already started. We need to concentrate on beating Trump. Despite the fact that Biden bragged about palling around with segregationists I support him completely. Trump must be soundly defeated because Russia and the GOP will cheat to win.

If Democrats really wanted to help. They'd negotiate whatever they can get now and another round of help at the end of October. Right before elections. And somehow let Biden tie that into his campaign. They don't care to help tho.

Bishop laments Biden-Harris ticket doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äòa Catholic on it,' gets schooled by Twitter
3/ Actions that were shot down or controversial in earlier Dem campaigns can happen now because there's more trust. People understand it doesn't mean throwing liberal values under the bus. So Biden's faith outreach director can talk to the Christian Post.
So when Biden DOJ comes in and seeks dismissal, you be good with dat like #Flynn?
as a woman, I, too am upset when potlicians try to ensure that I am heard and respected. it fucking pisses me off when they try to represent my marginalized voice. FUCK.  pssst Biden is really just trying to hit on every single American woman collectively at the same time. Sick.

Well, Biden and Harris won't answer shit.
Imagine thinking you‚Äôre making some sort of argument against Biden.  Trump is awful. Lmao
The Biden campaign supports a message of inclusivity, so I say both. Don‚Äôt want to be prejudicial.
Why do you think he‚Äôs working so hard to screw Biden, if he doesn‚Äôt, Russia will screw him.
With our national union heads all in for Biden and the criminals he‚Äôs riding in on, it‚Äôll have to be a rank-and-file coalition. Who‚Äôs in?
...in total it will do way more harm than good (for him). It‚Äôs also firing up an already fired up electorate that wants to get him out. And every moment the focus is on his crooked bullshit is a moment he can‚Äôt get anyone to focus on his bullshit lies about Biden and Harris.
I believe the argument people in this thread are taking is that Biden says he‚Äôll target 1031‚Äôs but not actually do it. Like Obama did. I‚Äôm not as optimistic but time will tell
Wall Street &amp; bankers are saying they see Biden/Harris as a moderate, left of center administration that will be focused on rebuilding business &amp; infrastructure and not focused on punitive regulations only egregious actions if they‚Ä¶
Clearly no one is doing as much as activism as you with that incredible handle that's sure to send Trump packing. In fact, it's most certainly doing more than Biden himself is to reach more voters. Your handle has more substance than the entire Biden campaign. Incredible stuff.

It‚Äôs an interesting/semi compelling premise: elect Biden so libs see our problems are w/ capitalism and not the GOP.   BUT it‚Äôs kinda ahistorical, and certainly not a factual premise to frame the debate around. He cites freaking socialism in Weimar Germany for chrissakes!
I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs necessarily wrong either, or that I think you shouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden; just that he‚Äôs a loser bully who likes the smell of his own farts more than organizing.

Where the jobs more that just part time? What years did the GDP ever get over 3%? Is spending more than all previous Presidents combined sustainable? The $65000 is how can Biden do a fraction of what Obama did after his move to socialism? Then Biden said...
Almost always, if in a depression, the opposition wins elections. So to say Biden has good odds is an understatement. He can still ruin this of course, he‚Äôs an idiot who cant go a week without gaffing, but to call it ‚Äúacademic‚Äù that Biden‚Äôs going to lose? Lol, stop posturing.
To assume, because Biden and Clinton‚Äôs politics are so similar, that they‚Äôll perform equally as well (or poorly), as well as the house and senate, is ignorant and ignores what we should focus on, which is what to do should Biden actually win, which he has good odds to do.
to ignore. Compared to Clinton‚Äôs at the same time (using RCP numbers),  he is far more stable than she was. During their primaries, biden stayed consistently at 30-some% for the majority of 2019. He won critical states clinton wavered in or lost to bernie to.
instance), if this pro-dem/anti-gop sentiment continues into the fall, dems are likely to  win at least one or two extra seats, likely pushing them into a stalemate in the senate.   As for the presidency, ive been over this a lot lately, but Biden‚Äôs lead is becoming difficult
The NYP headline is bullshit. There are not multiple women accusing Biden of sexual assault. There is only #TaraReade, and her story is full of glaring contradictions &amp; holes. All others SPECIFICALLY said the hair/shoulder touching was uncomfortable, but NOT sexual in nature.
America will last; the pentagon will make sure it lasts. The question is whether we have a chance for real change in four years if Biden loses, or eight years if Biden wins.
Even if I wasn't a Trump supporter, there is no way in hell I would vote for biden. Even if you don't like Trump, between the two, he is a billion times a better choice  don't vote  out of hate. Vote because in reality you know Trump is the better option.

I'm still trying to figure out how folks think Joe Biden is going to resuscitate the dead.   If elected, he'd take the oath at the end of January.   So, not sure why you think the election has anything to do with people in hospitals today.   Blame the DNC for running Hillary.
Just to be clear, this was extremely a joke. I donate to people who train for community self defense and provide aid to insurrectionaries, water protectors, nobodies. I will donate a brick through a window to the Biden campaign once I get over myself.
Like some neighbors I‚Äôm flying the üá∫üá∏ I have smaller ones too in pots of flowers.  I‚Äôm in a blue state with riots going on downtown. I know more people voting for Trump than Biden. So I cannot believe the polls showing the President trailing Biden! It is not logical.
That‚Äôs why this issue isn‚Äôt going away when Trump loses.  It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôll fade off into the distance either.  He‚Äôll hound Biden and make everything as difficult as possible, while continuing to incite people that will revere him like Reagan

So if he was for Biden you would be cool ok makes sense lol he has a right to his opinion I can say if he was a dem wouldn‚Äôt care because he‚Äôs a badass. Im he‚Äôs on the winning side though
You really think Biden and Harris are to blame for all that? Yikes.

This is all true but didn‚Äôt age very well for Mehdi because he‚Äôs been pleading with voters to support Biden as trump gets increasingly unhinged and dangerous!
Please vote for Biden this November anyway. He and Sanders formed a coalition. A missed vote is a vote for Trmp now, which means the end of democracy and the start of autocratic fascism, acceleration of climate crisis &amp; pandemic. Please.
I agree but like I said, I got Biden or I got Trump .   I‚Äôm voting Biden.   So u know I hate both parties n we should have more , but I have to go with the lesser of two evils.  Last two times I voted third party I got Bush n Trump no more .

Actually there are stark differences you fail to recognize, one being that the cult of Trump is not based in any principles or ideology. It is just that, a cult of personality. There‚Äôs no consistency in their thinking. There is no ‚Äúcult of Biden‚Äù. I support Biden bc he is closest

Well, you come out of the gate lying!! Donald Trump has done more for this country in his 3.5 years than the 3 previous Presidents combined. You are a fool's fool who knows nothing, ZIP, about how an economy runs and Biden knows less than you! Shameful!
I only know that YOU, trump, have done nothing for anyone but yourself and your rich friends, so don't tell me what Biden is going to do. He is a decent man. Can you say that about yourself?
Silly man Biden did not pronounce her name correctly
There you go again commenting about meaningless drivel rather than about Biden selecting Harris and their socialist agenda for America. Unbelievable!

Wasn't Obama building the economy up after Bush W's "free fall economy? which partially resulted from W's ploy of reducing interest rates to stimulate the economy during his reelection campaign? Now Biden will have to do it all over again

I mean everybody starts somewhere but I think it's true that Americans in general don't prefer career politicians. Compare to Biden who was a Senator for 36 years or Hillary who had been around for decades before running.

Doesn't matter who Biden picked. Trump will win in a landslide.

I guess the lesson is that Biden is not a narcissistic psychopath like Trump. He doesn't believe he has all of the answers to every question.
I agree with this but also struggle. Many of Trump and Biden's policies are both life and death where a Green party candidate has actual plans to fix. This is a shit time for everyone

I think a lot the problem with politics is Republicans think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the radical left, and the actual left thinks Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are Republicans.
Actually, Bill, that choice for VP actually hurts Biden and the Democrats. This is a woman who called Biden a sexist and racist and now they‚Äôre supposed to run together? Seriously? Do you think Harris is ready to run the country? I don‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs what will happen.

He called her a nasty woman. He said she should be in jail. They insinuated she was a pedophile. We are not prepared for the kinds of attacks that will be endured by Biden's running mate.
Time for a hot take:  If (god forbid) Biden loses, it won't be bc of his running mate.  Each contender has their pros and cons but let's be honest, she won't be in an enviable position. She'll face an onslaught of sexist criticism unseen before in American electoral politics.

I don't understand why this message is targeting me, I want the person to vote no matter what. However, I personally hate the pressure messaging of "vote Biden or else", even though I personally believe it myself. You're just going to turn away potential voters talking like that.
It‚Äôs between trump and Biden and they both have allegations. But at least Biden doesn‚Äôt lock up children and separate them from their families
I‚Äôve been telling people for like half a year now that the time to be complacent for any leadership is over. I‚Äôm voting Biden but I‚Äôm gonna be constantly critical of him and demanding more.
Next President of the United States Joe Biden and the next Vice President Kamala Harris.
She‚Äôs NOT black.  She bashed Biden, what changed.  Oh she maybe President!! Think twice!!
Harris is the first Dem to be on the top of the ticket west of the Rocky Mountains. Biden/Harris are the first candidates in decades to have not gone to an Ivy School.
Idk if it's PBS or the DNC but whoever is doing the pre-speech music for this biden/harris ordeal is slaying.
Yeah in terms of environment Trump is honestly the worst, although with the Biden's mental decline, Kamala will be the real presidential candidate and with what she has done to people and her authoritarian ideals, I don't feel like she's better than Trump.
Although Biden is further to the right than Trump, so how is that going to help the left?
It says so much about our beautiful country that a major party ticket now includes a Black and South Asian American woman. Congratulations, Kamala #MVP
I'm sorry but I have to disagree with being able to be able get much more done with Biden and Harris. They are both far more to the right than Trump and have been shown to be far more authoritarian and a genuine threat to African Americans.
Biden could be a better leader than Trump from his basement.
It's funny how hypocritical Trump is calling Joe Biden "sleepy Joe" when Mike Pence constantly  sleeps on the job, Kamala Harris is gonna make him her bitch in their debate.
And Biden will refer to her as "the first mainstream(whatever ethnicityTrump chooses) who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking broad who is fun to sniff" No ill wishes to Biden, but I hope she takes over quick.

We have the human and industrial capital in the so-called "Rust Belt" to challenge - if not overtake! - China as the prime producer of renewable energy in the world. The Biden/Harris administration /must/ make that a key plank in its platform for the rest of this decade.
How does Joe Biden know that?!?! He doesn't even remember his own name... Stop making falsified claims you can't back up. #Trump2020 If you have even a single brain cell remaining you will vote for the RIGHT choice. Trump for another 4!!!
I don‚Äôt know why it would be this time, Biden would likely pick a cabinet that‚Äôs as optimal and expert-filled as possible
How many stones do you need?  Those without sin throw the first one.  REALLY!  Biden?  Evil will always prevail!
Biden is Catholic
Good is evil and evil is good!! Crazy and people are blind.  I had a classmate say if he had Mickey Mouse running she would still vote for Biden.  So much Hate out there.  It‚Äôs a war between God and Satan.  If we know the end of the ‚ÄúBook‚Äù we know who wins. üòá
You have mistaken this with the Democrats and the MSM.  They will do ANYTHING to win the elections. President Trump has behind him the silent majority.  Biden has behind him the violent, screaming minority.  That's the difference. President Trump will be reelected.
seriously, i really fucked with him heavy but then he let us all down by supporting biden
Having Biden and kamala harris on the democratic ticket is the biggest middle finger to progressive criminal and prison reform
Who has confidence in Biden? He can't even remember Obama's name.
I mean with Kamala as VP, she is essentially the president due to Biden's mental deterioration. Considering she's pro slavery and anti pot, are you sure?
They will as long as Biden listens and obeys
Obama and Biden left a pandemic plan behind in case something happened, which was then ignored when a pandemic happened. ACA isn't really to blame for this.
Woman get shit done.   So so happy and hopeful.    Biden/Harris.   Yes.
#teamKamala all the way. I am glad Joe Biden is comfortable with a strong, ambitious woman by his side. Godspeed.
biden &amp; harris?? i already wasn‚Äôt voting but that just makes it much easier lol
You are going to try to paint her as  radical left but the Democratic ticket of Biden and Harris is clear indication that the party has rejected it, so good luck with that.
You‚Äôre babbling and running scare!! Biden/Harris 2020
I've been saying ever since it was clear that Bernie was probably gonna lose that I would vote for Biden just because he'll at least be capable of listening to criticism and will fill his administration with experts.  We gotta just pour on the pressure even harder if Biden wins.
Nah, that's a bad take. If you're not feeling Biden then you don't HAVE to vote Biden. Heck, even Biden has said the same thing when talking about the Tara Reade allegations.   You're just alienating people who are on the fence if you say they HAVE to vote Biden.
That's fair. I generally only really push people to really consider voting Biden if they're in battleground states, since their vote might actually make a direct impact on the results.  I want 3rd parties to be a viable option but we gotta get election reform first sadly.
Joe Biden will not only be remembered as a President of the United States but the man who introduced us to our first black female Presidentüá∫üá∏ This is one party I can‚Äôt wait to get started üëç
He did not say that he would veto M4A, here is the direct quote of his response to the question of if he'd veto M4A.  "I would veto anything that delays providing the security and the certainty of health care being available now."
Not a fan of her, but then, I am not fan of Biden. That being said, I am voting Blue, no matter what. The stakes are way too high.
Biden has nothing to do with either 160k+ dead or the recession, and Kamala's healthcare plan would've covered everyone and forced private healthcare to follow stricter regulation.
Of course he did, it's Trump. The man is maximum pettiness personified.  I'd vote for a moldy lemon and stale bread before I voted for Trump, and Biden/Harris at least have some real interesting history and a lot of progressive policy writers pushing the campaign along.
Warren would've been my vote in the primary had the writing not already been on the wall that she was not going to be competitive enough in the primary, so I shifted to Bernie.  If it makes you feel any better, Warren has been a *major* policy adviser for Biden in recent months.
Yall saying you're no longer voting for biden might as well vote for trump
Didn‚Äôt kamala trash Biden in the debates?
Yay! And the next president after Biden.
I don't know who he could've picked that would've pulled in more progressive and younger voters. Elizabeth Warren is amazing, but people didn't show up for her, and she's just as old as Biden is.
Biden is handing Trump the election. The Democratic Party should be sick for letting these two be the ones running
Let's get our 2020 election on, folks! Biden Harris for the win!
Kamala Harris was honestly probably my top pick for VP (her, Warren, and Susan Rice top 3), she'll be a great choice, assuming that Biden continues to work with Sanders and Warren with his policies.
She's not really polarizing, and especially neither her nor Biden are as divisive as Trump. That's a false equivalence. Listening to Harris interrogate someone is the most exciting thing out there, she's a great speaker.
It is great for the President, but horrible for Joe Biden.  Kamala Harris is very unlikable, vicious person.
Biden Harris LFG
There is no better Democrat to be manipulated than Joe Biden! That's why he is the ideal candidate for the left mob who wants the revolution (read: pathological destruction of the Country). Joe Biden is just a puppet for the left mob and MSM (the same).
If Biden selects Kamala Harris he will be toast. Very vulnerable VP pick
Have you heard the guy that predicted the winner for president since 1984 correctly even Trump in 2016 said Biden will win in 2020. God save us!
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... That's the normal mistakes all the people make sometimes.  Biden is totally lost and he needs to be guided by his staff (the left mob) all the time.  Huge difference!
I love how the Biden campaign view the VP selection as the ‚Äúleast risky‚Äù and not helpful or advantageous
DC Swamp Lizards. They have sold out and probably promised much money if Biden gets in. DemocRATS in Republican clothing.
They are not much a friends of the USA so is Joe Biden! #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica
I would say 2 and 3 are pretty close. But a friend of mine knows his Doctore Biden had a stroke and he is declining fast!
And yet unlike Trump, Biden will pick an administration and work with qualified experts because he knows that it‚Äôs not really about him as an individual at all. That‚Äôs the draw for Biden in this case, he‚Äôs very good at knowing when to seek expert opinion.
I'd vote Biden if his pick was was snoopy the dog!
This is ridiculous.  It was a slip. God I hate defending Trump, but if Biden misspoke in that manner, and Jr, Sean, and the gang jumped on him for it I would be pissed.
Joe Biden listed  as criminal suspect in Ukrainian court

Of course! But I think that Joe Biden is more experienced especially as a golfer. Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
Look around what is happening at this moment! Biden will do 1000 times better.
Can you ride a bike üö≤ Rudy Giuliani! The difference here is insurmountable.Trump holding hands and Biden on a long bike ride! Yep you will not be heard off after early next year Rudy &amp; if you are indicted for corruption trump can‚Äôt save you from the justice system! Good luck üçÄ!
Not only can Joe Biden ride a bike but he can say Yosemite!
Your father was a great comedian, but also an outstanding actor. He is missed. Political figures are pubic figures. His piece on Biden, like other politicians in his act are fair game. It was also hilarious. Let‚Äôs just leave it at that and not make it political.
So, Biden (in the reality the left mob who wants to govern) is more pro life than Trump??? That question is not even a subject to discussion. It's obvious.  #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver  Without any doubt!
Tell pops He needs to call Biden and go together on a bike ride for Exercise! Biden wow at 78 killing it on his bike ride and pips needs to hold hands down the Ramp  with a General ! That‚Äôs not how a commander in Chief suppose to look like ! Silly üòú!

FDR....Sounds more like Biden than trump. Jfc. Like that statement holds any water.
Joe Biden is dumber than a bag of doughnuts how do you guys not see it. He can‚Äôt even talk properly.. flubs his words all the time and loses my interest immediately
People are brainwashed to think nothing can be worse than trump. Even if trump is as bad as some people think, Biden is inherently worse.98% of Biden voters simply want to save what's left of our democracy.
If you think Biden and Trump are the same please unfollow me. fucking brain dead take

Clearly Biden knows that too... last speaker is Highest Honor! We must make sure it's covered! #MediaCoverYangSpeech
For everyone that was upset at Yang not being on the schedule, I raise a different scenario. Many democrats would do anything to be the last speaker. My guess there was a lot of in fighting going on to be that speaker. Yang was not even trying to be. That points to Joe Biden.
This is the highest honor. There's no way this happens without Joe Biden wanting it so. It is important that we in the Yang gang start applying pressure now to all the media outlets, They dare not cut away to a pundit  Or commercial while he speaks!!!
Heidi you have a lot of followers in the Yang gang... It is imperative that we start applying pressure now that the media not cut Yang off with commercials or puandits before Biden speaks.
I am not surprised. Do you remember how Andrew blew the doors off at those state convention speeches? Remember Biden was in the audience waiting his turn.
I am having a recurring dream that I wake up and we have a lifeless puppet for president and then I see Biden is really running for president and I scream but no one can hear me.
The middle wouldn‚Äôt vote left. Biden will keep the house and get the White House. Depending on how badly Trump derails, senate may be in play. Policies aside, people are tired of the train crash episode. It was interesting for a bit, but covid and incompetency was the nail.
I know all of you are a little partisan, this you substantially underestimate the 2-6% in all of those states that voted trump before knowing he was a conman. They‚Äôve given up. It‚Äôs over. He can‚Äôt get them back. And Biden will win. A lot of noise until then.
Biden is the ultimate teacher of political plagiarism.
Andrew Yang now has the BEST speaker slot of all... the LAST speaker before the Candidates!  Surely Biden had some role in this...  Bodes well for the Cabinet Appointment, No?  AWESOME.
HOLY CRAP! He went from forgotten to the FINAL SPEAKER BEFORE THE CANDIDATES! No Higher Honor! Folks... I gotta think Biden had some say in this! Awesome!
And Biden is not even saying no.
I warn progress and trump ain‚Äôt it. And Biden you actually have a say.
Assuming you're talking about Astead's piece, havent read it yet. We're on a path to serious conflict. Idk if Biden fully realized the optics of declaring himself a bridge to the future, then tabbing someone who's clear about wanting to inherit. Left needs a media strategy badly.
#jeninepiro if you have knowledge of Biden being in danger that has to be reported. Or threats you are making.
Trump answers all questions answerable.Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt take one softball question because it wouldn‚Äôt make sense. He was given the questions ahead of time at one of his great outdoor adventures from the basement and ended telling us on camera what he was told ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
By R/T'ng Biden advisers?  That is all you have?  Get back to me when Vecchio has a speaking slot at a Biden rally or something like that.
Anyway... Biden's advisors appreciated Guaido's interview.
If not, Guaido should lobby Biden.  Moreover, Maduro has refused to negotiate since April/ May because he thinks Biden will win and he'll bless his fake elections with the mesita.  It unlocks the game for Biden to pour cold water on this.
I don't care about Martinez.  I want Guaido to lobby Biden to be on Guaido (and therefore Venezuela's side.)  There is a significant chance that Biden wins.  Do you want Guaido to be thrown under the bus and for Fal$on to be sitting in the Oval Office next year?
And it is very important for people like Vecchio and Guaido to have a seat in Biden's inner circle so that Martinez doesn't promote fake elections.
The difference is Trump is the  " president " and it is his job Biden is just a candidate and probable next president and has no obligation yet
If Biden wins, things go back to the way they were.  #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica #Trump2020 #trump #chinafreeworld
Biden doesn‚Äôt take questions. Does Biden disavow ANTIFA? Does any democrat?  Idiots
And?  Guaido has asked Naim for advice.  Martinez is concerning but if you want a Biden administration to support Guaido instead of the mesita, then you better make sure Martinez feels pressure to remain on Guaido's side.
Yes.  I do.  I don't see them openly campaigning for Biden.  Ravell only really has opinions on Venezuelan politics as does Castillo.  And Carla Angola has good contacts in the Trump administration.
Biden shouldn't listen to a word Ben Rhodes says...  He's an idiot.
The Obama people are jerks and didn't believe in Biden in 2020.  Obama was rooting for Sanders.
Been nightmares every night since Trump got elected. Our cities are burning and people are dying from a pandemic that he mishandled. I‚Äôll take my chances on Biden rather than certain disaster with Trump.

Biden is 3 years older than Donald. Where do Donald, and his minions, get off accusing Biden of being too old?  The SKelly cartoon is despicable, and I demand the Tribune own up to that now!
Yes, but then back to the UFO's after Biden victory!
Wondering why Biden didn't do whay you claim in the 8 yrs in the Whitehouse or 30 yrs in Congress. Kamala ,you called Joe a racist during Debates.Were we to believe you then or now? You will truely come to know the power of God our Creator. And Great will be your fall
I blocked her and Joe Biden so their tweets don't show up on my timeline.
The 30-something liberal snowflakes whining about this could go to the polls and vote in person.  Exposure to a disease that likely won't kill you for a few minutes to vote early in an election and make sure Biden wins big on election night isn't the end of the world.
If the "day of" vote count is a landslide for Biden, it should be game over.
Hey, Molly... Biden wasn't my first choice, but he's certainly not "the lesser of two evils" !!
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He‚Äôs the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes
What happens if Biden wins?  Guaido might not be able to get lobbying and diplomatic pressure from a Biden administration if he campaigns for Trump.  Not to mention that Guaido needs Biden right now to unlock the game by throwing cold water on the fake elections.
You don't like the choice between trump and Biden?  Then how about choosing a decent person  Novel idea, I know, but boy do I miss decent.  So does the entire world.
Barack Obama: I've been to 57 states and I have one more to go.  Joe Biden: I've been to one state and have 57 to go.
If you want to be able to cast another ballot in 2024, vote for Biden.
That's my idea for why not voting for Biden is justifiable. You want the Dems to move left so you make them work for your vote.
Everyone who can't see a difference between Trump and Biden should just keep talking to each other on Twitter. Absolute buffoons.
"two point shift"? that's usually within the margin of error, and IMO doesn't justify an explanation. What's more interesting is the sheer size of the Trump-Biden gap, though we're still ~3 months out
The issue is the opposition descending into backbiting like they always do and the international community growing bored.  I haven't heard a lot from Biden's team or his campaign surrogates about Venezuela strategy, which concerns me that he might be open to fake elections.
There is a difference. Voting for Trump in 2016 caused this entire mess we‚Äôre in. Appreciate the Biden vote now
As long as Mitch is feeling good about things, the rest of the county does not matter.  However, great campaign fodder for Biden, McConnell sends the Senate home for vacation during this mess.  --&gt; Dereliction of duty by the GOP, again.
The Pod Bros are tools and I would totally promise to vote for Biden if he disses Ben Rhodes and the rest of them.
I can‚Äôt wait for Biden to go on Cumtown next month.
Ralph Nader didn't put W in the White House. Kerry had a busted story - war hero/anti-war veteran/war hero to fight terror. So he got Swiftboated because when your story's broke your enemy defines you. Thank God Biden's got a tight narrative - decent man in time of indecency.
That is literally what Biden said.  Outside means outside.  Also, what does "alone" constitute in your mind?  If I am walking on a sidewalk in a shopping area should I wear a mask?
Jogging with a mask on or walking a dog outside with a mask on is exactly what Biden just said...  That is what wearing a mask outside means.  And that is ridiculous.
I don't like Biden all that much either but right now in America the only choices are bad or worse. In the end, when no other choice is presented, I will always take the lesser of the bad.
This is about the debates. Notice that he says 3 months. When the debates begin (September) Biden will say that Trump is responsible for 10,000 deaths because he ignored Biden‚Äôs mask advice in August. In October he‚Äôll say 20,000. This is all debate positioning.
yeah, I think I'm hearing you say biden gives us some breathing room... which I'm definitely sympathetic to
Hi.  I'm religious.  I'm OK with Biden-Harris.  Who were you talking about exactly?  Oh, I'm a liberal Jew.  You didn't mean me, right?  Because leftists who self-identify as religious don't count?
ok, I was confused before. now I know *why* I'm not voting for biden.
Misogyny and a 25 year campaign against HRC was a big player last time. They saw two equally awful evils. Hoping there is more clarity and less misogyny (Biden‚Äôs a dude) this time.
Plus, it‚Äôs all just so....tawdry and sad.  Who needs to even know this anymore?  Let‚Äôs just elect Biden, chalk it up to experience, and move the F on.
Correction: Our country IS collapsing now. We must elect Joe Biden.
If you disagree with someone, fine. But I am irritated with this trope about anyone who is not wild about Biden is a Russian agent. That's so dopey 50's-McCarthyite. Come on.

Yeah, I kind of agree.  Or just have one so the Repubs can‚Äôt accuse Biden of being scared of debating.
Ambassador Neumann, these are all good things but I think that more is needed from Biden.  Will you agree with me that Biden should declare against the fake parliamentary elections in December and also repudiate the "mesita"?
Venezuelans would have a lot more power if they demanded things from Biden as well as Trump...  Like demanded that Biden declares against the fake parliamentary elections.
That is why she was selected. Not because she is simpatico to Biden
She was not my first choice, but I now see my error.  She is the right choice.   One clue to her value to Biden is that the Trump campaign team's responses were confused and contradictory.   They have no effective counter message to Kamala, and she takes media time from Trump.
People do realize that Kanye West joined BLM in June and donated $2 million. Since then, he announced he is running to pull votes away from Biden to help Trump. It's not a far leap to think he is using his new BLM $$ influence to trigger new unrest which also helps Trump.

Joe Biden thinks you can throw Kamala  out there
But Joe Biden thinks you can throw a Democrat out there
Someone else came up with it, but I like it. The condition for Biden to debate Trump is that Trump has to release his tax returns to the public.
Vote for Biden. Trump will continue to do nothing while Americans die. America will eventually become a developing country- we are already headed there.
‚Äúunder control‚Äù man u guys really dont want any of us voting biden lol
I wonder if Biden will make Kamala watch when he goes skinnydipping like he used to make his female Secret Service agents do.
As usual, think how the GOP would react if Biden (or any other Dem) stood up a fake campaign for a GOP candidate!  They would raise holy hell and impeach everyone. But it's okay for Jared to run this stupid operation, which he'll botch anyway.

Burn all this shit to the ground   Idk g, but it‚Äôs definitely not as simple as ‚Äúa vote against Biden is a vote for trump‚Äù or any of the other colloquialisms used lately.
Stop telling black people that voting for Biden/Kamala is the MORAL choice, those who harm our communities will continue to keep doing so in positions of power
I agree with this but also struggle. Many of Trump and Biden's policies are both life and death where a Green party candidate has actual plans to fix. This is a shit time for everyone
Kamala is a cop. Race and gender do not matter. Let's stop acting like the Biden/Harris ticket is exciting UNTIL they support M4A and Defunding the police
With apologies to The Wire and to Omar, ‚ÄúBiden don‚Äôt scare.‚Äù   Biden is a mature, confident person, comfortable in his own skin. It‚Äôs never been about Biden, it‚Äôs always about people and the country.   Not saying he‚Äôs perfect. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just need good. Or better.

"This is a winning pick for the Biden campaign in every way imaginable."  Joe Biden's pick of U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his VP running mate may boost enthusiasm for him among Black voters, says Prof.
Trump would single out Booker because: 1) Trump is a lying idiot 2) Booker will be a powerful campaigner for Biden/Harris 3) Trump is completely ignorant 4) Maybe Trump got Booker and Ben ("Dr. HUD") Carson confused?
we are anti-all US presidents. the US empire shouldn‚Äôt exist + all US presidents have been evil war criminals, capitalists, white supremacists, and cops. trump is no diffferent than biden or obama at the end of the day, so we don‚Äôt see anything good abt identifying as anti-trump.
I‚Äôm certain Biden and the DNC had to heavily consider the best candidate based on SNL performances also.
I really hope they keep pushing this. Maybe it‚Äôll accidentally convince some of the ‚Äúbern it all down‚Äù crowd to get out and vote for the ‚Äúradical leftists‚Äù Biden/Harris.
I think that all Venezuelans, especially the US diaspora and  should lobby Biden and his advisers to come out against the December 6th farce elections in Venezuela.  This could help Guaido pressure Maduro into granting a delay and gaining conditions.
Believe me that single-payer isn't mainstream Democratic policy.  Free college for all isn't mainstream Democratic policy.  Biden won the Democratic primary while being against those things.
Yep If elected Harris would be president within one year due to Biden dementia issue
While voters don't pick their candidate based on their VP ,  can give the campaign just a little bit more mobility and range on left of center issues, and will help on messaging.  ( last night on #ChicagoTonight
I'd love to know what Biden's plan is (seriously).  I am legit afraid that he'd throw Guaido and the G4 under the bus in favor of the misfit toys in the "mesita" and endorse fake parliamentary elections like Chris Murphy seems to want to do.
Biden may be against sanctions, support fake elections, support the mesita, and throw Guaido under the bus.  That is the legitimate concern.
Do you think we will see Prince Harry campaigning for Joe Biden this year or is that a leap too far?
Biden is the top of the ticket. So it‚Äôs Trump or Biden? Pretty simple. Stop the nonsense
Trump: names a member of the Amway family as secretary of education  Biden: picks a VP who let Herbalife off the hook  Anyone wanna do a video with me about major politicians siding with MLMs??
Sometimes the obvious needs to be pointed out.   The "racism" is on Laura Ingraham.  Kamala Harris is a proven vote getter in the the most populous state in the nation.  Joe Biden picked the candidate that would most help him get elected President.
Actually, Bill, that choice for VP actually hurts Biden and the Democrats. This is a woman who called Biden a sexist and racist and now they‚Äôre supposed to run together? Seriously? Do you think Harris is ready to run the country? I don‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs what will happen.
Finally some good news! Nearly a 20pt margin. Intraparty war is unavoidable with Biden's self-proclamation that he's just a bridge to the future.
Nothing against Maya Rudolph but I don't give a fuck that she may be getting more airtime because of Biden's VP pick.
Yes but the Harris Biden 2020 platform is a plank on the Titanic
Doesn‚Äôt matter Harris Biden 2020 are going to loose
My takeaway: it looks I have the same laptop as Biden. Wonder if he also has keyboard issue with his, and how he deals with it.
Great for POTUS within a smaller and shrinking group of people.  Great for Biden in a larger and expanding group of people.
"All the White Guys"??   Some of us White Guys are fine with Biden's choice.  Oh, I almost forgot, Biden is a White Guy.
Can you guys please lobby Biden's advisors to come out with a statement against the December 6th Parliamentary Elections?  I think that Biden could do a lot of good with a statement like that.  He could give Guaido leverage to get the farces postponed and get conditions.
I am delighted there is a Biden/Harris Ticket! Made my day.
Great! With Harris on the ticket, Biden will be easily defeated...
If you‚Äôre considering shaming people for not voting for BIDEN AND HARRIS, consider not doing that and instead helping the communities they‚Äôve helped ruin.  Y‚Äôall are too old to keep pretending Trump‚Äôs evil is responsible for everything wrong in the US or that it‚Äôs an anomaly.
Them: you picked  Biden: I told you it needed to be a woman, not dead fat wrestler!!! #toofar? #sorrynotsorry #icouldntresist #RIPKamalaWWE
Pretty soon I‚Äôm gonna read ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote out Trump by voting for Biden/Harris you‚Äôll be personally responsible for leaving those kids in cages!‚Äù and I‚Äôm gonna spontaneously combust
With all due respect: when was Joe Biden excommunicated? When he mourned his son? When he spoke up for women‚Äôs agency? Spoke against Barr, the Catholic who orders executions in high speed? Could you please expand so that we can all read it, and hear what you really mean to say?
#Kamala Honors to the strong women in Biden‚Äôs possible picks for VP. Their collective support of Kamala is honorable. Women in solidarity of each other. Trump‚Äôs stoogie remarks show how scared he is.
Biden‚Äôs base is very excited. #Trump2020  #KamalaHarrisForVP
I would love to know Biden's position on the parliamentary "elections."  I think that both the EU and a potential Biden admin not throwing Maduro the lifeline he wants would be helpful.
I am a lifelong Democrat and would vote blue whoever &amp; I like Joe Biden, BUT VERY DISAPPOINTED IN HIS CHOICE OF KAMALA HARRIS. He wanted a "woman of color", which is fine, just thought there were others who would have been a better choice. Harris' record as prosecutor not good.
Not this white woman. Biden-Harris all the way
Saying I'm not voting means I'm not voting at all...not Trump and not Biden.
Nasty Women for Biden/Harris 2020 !!
Trump: If Biden wins, Americans will have to learn Chinese  via  if you win we‚Äôll have to learn Russian
Listen if Hamilton could endorse Jefferson then I can do my best to support Biden/Harris!
Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate: Where does she stand on economic issues? More
Two fake people running for President and V.P. , BIDEN"S been cloned and KAMALA replaced by a look alike.
NOW WE HAVE A CLONED JOE BIDEN WITH DEMENTIA AND A REPLACEMENT KAMALA HARRIS.  SHOULD BE INTERESTING!
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate - National |
And a sign that he is someone who is willing to listen and learn and grow. And also shows that Biden knows this isn't just about him. It's about all of us. Way different than Trump's approach and in the best possible way. He had my vote, and now he has even more of my respect.
Aside from everything else that is being said now by the "pundits," it shows that Biden is the anti-narcissist, without ego problems.   Here he picks someone who very personally attacked him during a debate! Can you even imagine Trump doing that?
#TRUMP2020 biggest landslide in Presidential Election history? Who, besides the careerless ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù, is going to vote for Joe fucking Biden??
Joe Biden did the dumbest move ever and now Trump is going to win again lmao
Day One Biden/Harris: Boot this bozo!
. Congratulations! We are excited to do what it takes to get you and  into the White House! You are going to be a great #VP #VPHarris #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide #Biden #TeamJoe #TeamKamala #MadamVicePresident #MadameVP #VoteBlue
not ridin with biden LMAO
It‚Äôll be a bigger beat down than Biden/Ryan 2012
Biden/Harris is the best possible ticket. There will be nit-picking and criticism, but nothing is ever said about trump/Pence, and they are a total disaster. I'll take Biden/Harris any day of the week.She'll eat Pence alive in debates.... plastic man and the prosecutor... yeh!
Captain Biden: Welcome aboard the Titanic
Great choice. Biden-Harris!
boy Joe Biden really just helped out the big ten didn‚Äôt he
During the largest BLM movement and amid global riots and protests that haven't stopped for 3 MONTHS... Biden picks a cop for VP. Man Dems can fuck allllllllllll the way off
I think the odds are high that Biden will give Harris a lot to do since he was a VP and he‚Äôll have his hands full rebuilding our image abroad. But I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be a shoe-in for pres in 2024 as some suggest.
i for one imagine a world where biden sent AOC an invite to play ARAM and by ARAM i mean the presidency
Why are so many of us reporting we‚Äôre sitting around weeping with joy at Biden‚Äôs pick? God, we needed this at the end of this summer!!
Around this time of year reality sets in. In the spring you still have your ideals. By Sept. it‚Äôs clear there will be one person  victorious on 11/4: You wasn‚Äôt Trump or Biden? Given that‚Äôs the choice, what else can we do?
Easy for me to say, but in hearing what is going on inside postal service, its veterans need at every location to quietly hold meetings. Everyone should agree: whatever deJoy says, nod "Yes," &amp; do what must be done to maintain service. Biden will take care of you.
Not Joe Biden picking the devil Kamala
Not a surprising choice but I can't stand her for how she treated Kavanaugh.   So no way I vote Biden.
Biden/Harris - can't wait for my yard sign!!!
This tells me several surprising things about Biden--all of them good. 1. Unlike trump he doesn't hold grudges. 2. He can take criticism gracefully 3. He knows a kickass running mate when he sees one! #Kamala
Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs choice for VP.
BIDEN PICKS HIMSELF FOR VP #JoeJoe2020
Ugly - Keep your seatbelts on "Who did biden pick"
Joe Biden isn't looking so good
#NEWS  Joe #Biden has selected his running mate  I have over 60,000 #free #eBooks including #TheGreatGodPan by #ArthurMachen
Umm I'm Joe Biden
BREAKING Biden selects New Zealand president Jacinda Ahern as his running mate
Whoever Biden chooses, the media gauntlet of misogynist tropes and biases will be a given. Last week a slew of influential women wrote a letter to news orgs and  points out that it‚Äôs actually a BFD.
Isn't he a bit late to the party? Didn't Biden pledge to nominate a woman six months ago?
Will Biden condemn the Venezuelan "fake elections" in December and publicly support Guaido's strategy?  Because the fact that WOLA and other left leaning think tanks staffed by Obama alums keep demanding that Guaido support the "mesita's candidates" in them is worrying.
Why not have a transvestite as a V.P. for biden. We had a Transvestite as a first Lady (Michelle).
... He's speaking Thursday before Biden.
I really can't imagine why Trump thinks he'll do well debating Biden... Biden isn't the most eloquent speaker - we know that - but at least he can string together a sentence or two that are intelligible, unlike Trump.
So impressed that America's religious community has taken the Allman Bros response to Trump's attack on Biden's Catholicism I ain't here a wond'rin' why But I'll live on and I'll be strong 'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear
congratulations to Biden Veep pick Baby Nut
If you all can't wait for Biden to pick a VP, how are you going to wait for mail-in ballots to be counted? Do a jigsaw puzzle, for God's sake.
From experience: be very careful what jokes you make about Biden‚Äôs potential VP pick. What you do today will haunt you annually in your facebook memories.Joe Biden already has three grandsons.
If Dems win (which they won‚Äôt) Biden and Harris won‚Äôt be running anything, it‚Äôll be the Clinton administration! We‚Äôll all end up in her FEMA camps with our blood drained!
I have seen NO Biden signs.  I see Trump signs and American Flags.  Gives me hope.
And I wanted this man to become the next President well spoken. Both Biden and Trump suck
He‚Äôs just pissed because he wanted to make sure Trump knew he wasn‚Äôt insulting him and we all knew he was really trying to insult‚Ä¶ LOL, it wasn‚Äôt like we couldn‚Äôt figure that out‚Ä¶of course he meant Biden...What the commercial really exposed was Hannity‚Äôs double standard
Lol ‚Äúdiscredited‚Äù?  Because it exposed your double standard?  Your words were about Biden/Harris but could easily (as the clips showed) be applied to  ? I think that WAS the point...the ad should stand.
Lol ‚Äúdiscredited‚Äù?  Because it exposed your double standard?  Your words were about Biden/Harris but could easily (as the clips showed) be applied to  ?  You only complain because you wanted to make sure everybody understood who it was you were trying to insult?
Lol ‚Äúdiscredited‚Äù?  Because it exposed your double standard?  Your words were about Biden/Harris but could easily (as the clips showed) be applied to  ?  You only complain because you wanted to make sure everybody understood who it was you were trying to insult?
You‚Äôre a joke and a fraud if you claim to be Republican and would support Biden.
Biden has a script fir everything he says. After he reads it - he walks off stage.  In a Debate there are no notes. Bye- Bye- Joey
So is Cocoa Puff going to vote for Biden or are they sworn enemies?
Those against voting for the lesser of two evils, please read this.  Noam Chomsky is a philosopher, linguist, and left-wing advocate.  He‚Äôs finally on the same page as me and he understands that Biden isn‚Äôt Bernie, but he‚Äôll be able to push the country in that direction.
Multiple redundant protections need to be put in place to protect America from Trump's (and Putin's) plans to both 1) "cheat to win", 2) "discredit a Biden win as fraudulent". Multiple actors EACH need to add their own INDEPENDENT protections: Congress, EACH state, EACH township.
Yea Joe Biden did so well with H1N1 virus they told states to quit testing, nobody wore mask, so basement Joe &amp; #HeelsUpHarris can g to hell #outnumbered
Joe Biden is a plaegeriser and has lost 2 previous presidential bids because of it. An inconvenient truth.
"if you don't vote for biden you cannot complain about trump if he wins" well i'm not voting for trump either and i'm gonna complain about biden all i want
You forget the only suburban housewives any more are in rich, white homes.... most suburban homes require two full-time incomes to support and that‚Äôs just a scrape by Till the next paycheck, especially in this economy. My vote is for Biden
Absolutely not, I wear it when it is justified, Biden is an idiot
Correction, when Hills tried to ‚ÄúRIG it‚Äù so she‚Äôd win and it backfired in her face! What a cheater! She‚Äôs so corrupt it‚Äôs sick. Killary is the puppet masterüëø behind Biden. Go against her and ya die. Biden couldn‚Äôt win Uno for God sakes!
Liar, Liar Liar. You tv ads are blantanly false. Joe Biden said he would raise taxes on people making $400 thousand and above.  He has never said most of what your shills have said. This worries me, you as an Impeached President can‚Äôt be trusted. Bad for the USA
Literally only voting for Biden to get Trump out. Of all the options, he was like, fourth on my list. Maybe, MAYBE third.
The President used the term ‚Äúfederal decree‚Äù with regard to a suggestion made by former VP Biden about a national mask mandate. I just prefer that everyone sticks to the common language so waters don‚Äôt get muddied.
Most realistically joe Biden would get run over by the train after becoming confused and stepping on tracks.
Trump wasn‚Äôt propelling that thing Biden was Trump was on the Trump train
Biden REALLY shouldn't use the "trump is a racist" strategy, as it is gonig to backfire.  Biden is the actual racist.
Biden's entire campaign is based on orange man bad, which is what Hillary did and lost with. if that's all he's got, he's going to lose also. Though, if he will also lose if he tries to campaign on policy change.
Overall, with everything going on in the world,  I think she is the best candidate and will help Biden
ALL Trump's evil is brazen &amp; flaunted, including the hypocrisy of trying to get every government in the world, friend or foe, foreign or domestic, to make announcements of investigations or charges that will hurt  including FALSELY claiming Obama/Biden did this to HIM!
I wonder if she still believes Biden‚Äôs accuser
So true, let‚Äôs not forget Obama &amp; Gates funded the lab in China to intentionally cause this mess during Trumps term! It‚Äôs not a question of right vs. left, it‚Äôs right vs. wrong! Funny how Biden owns an island next to Epstein‚Äôs. Wtf?
Biden with tiddies is traumatic
Is Kamala Harris a Nauseating Political Opportunist?  Harris either believes the charges against Biden or she doesn't. Either way, she has problems.
Biden isn‚Äôt strong enough to propel that thing.
I‚Äôm a suburban white woman and I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris! Never felt better about a vote!!!!
Lie after lie in your commercials. Do you take the people in this country as stupid?  No we see the lengths you will go to slander Joe Biden.  Voters will turn away from you this fall. Step down, it‚Äôs time.
Hey  did you notice  out of his basement today? That warm sensation your daddy feels in his backside is Biden and  foot in his ass. Start packing and don‚Äôt steal anything. You‚Äôre done.
While I recognize the intent to be "folksy" and show a familiarity with Senator Harris, referring to her as Kamala is sexist. Please, Vice President Biden, when you reference your running mate, refer to her as Senator Harris or use her full name.
#HeelsUpHarris is a phony, and her laugh is annoying as hell, between Biden‚Äôs gaffes and her phoniness they make the perfect dumb and dumber
The over/under on  Beau Biden references today was three. We are over. Way over.
I expected more from Biden's speech. Yawn!!
Biden is a Huge Favorite to Win the Election  538 has odds of 71-29. I was 70-30. 538 ran 40,000 simulations. I ran zero. I just looked at the polls.
Biden really rode the grey area with Kamala. She is s woman of color-except NOT AFRICAN AMERICAN.  She is Jamaican - Indian. Nice try Joe - this will be an issue.
Another Biden ooops.  He is really full of himself now as he was then, so what change?  Nothing, still full of Sh**
3 VERY IMPORTANT THINGS about this photo of Joe Biden calling Kamala to offer her VP spot: 1. Biden has to read from a script that is clearly visible 2. Biden does not know how to hold an iPhone (it‚Äôs upside down) 3. The cartoon on Biden‚Äôs desk is a man screaming ‚ÄúWHY ME?!‚Äù
The same 6 in 10 think Biden is going to be President.  Donald J. Trump will be the President after the next election!!
A tremendous disservice to America. And you all what another 4 years of this crap?  No thanks.  Biden/Harris...Let‚Äôs go!!!
And yet you can truly not come up with one Biden accomplishment in almost half a century of public service.
So you agree the Biden is a political nothing?
I look at policy only. It is indisputable that Biden is and always has been a political failure. His peeps can‚Äôt ever come up with a notable accomplishment.
Neither Trump or Pence will have to say a word during the 2020 Debates, just give Biden and Harris the microphone.
Nauseating But Predicted: Biden Selects Kamala Harris as His VP Running Mate
Fact. Joe Biden says he won't raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000. Once again you lie in your commercial.  Every commercial you have run is a Big lie.  I can‚Äôt trust you on anything.  It‚Äôs time to give up your lies.
NARRATOR: Biden is Catholic.
This about sums it up. I will be voting for Biden/Harris.
#APGov220 If you‚Äôre following along with news about  choosing  for his VP running mate, this has the Biden and Trump responses.
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
Way to go Biden #HeelsUpHarris
Just remember when all these GOP people say anything about her comments in the primary against Biden, they were hurled personal insults from Frump against their  family members, their own personalities, etc. now they line up to kiss his ass and don‚Äôt say a word
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
We are all waiting for Biden to be told who his running mate is.  Odds in Vegas say he will say the wrong name when he makes the announcement
Yes I know Gabe personally. We are hanging out Saturday. Come join us. He does say questionable things, as do I. But perhaps I need to see blatant racism to see something as racist. Like the things Biden says.
Whoever Biden's VP Pick, it's not about him or the woman he picks. It's about the people they are running for, the people they want to serve. The presidency is no place for an evil, narcissistic sociopath who thinks everything in the universe is about himself.
Biden hasn‚Äôt got any brain cells... everyone can see that. It‚Äôs so frustrating how people can‚Äôt see the evil George Soros started. So many fell for it and we‚Äôve gone backwards 100 years.
Trump saying to a reporter, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you who‚Äôs meddling in our elections: the Democrats!‚Äù, is as ridiculous as when Biden answered a reporter, "You!", when asked his running mate. But, TRUMP's ridiculous answer was a SERIOUS LIE.  KNOWS Trump is a literal traitor.
Biden would have been screaming.
So as someone who teaches history - it‚Äôs normal for people to make mistakes. The briefing was interrupted earlier and that can throw people off.  However, the Trump team has been hammering that Biden is in some kind of cognitive decline.   Glass houses and stones come to mind.
Black male leaders warn Biden ‚Äòwill lose‚Äô election if he doesn't name Black female running mate   I thought you‚Äôre suppose to pick the most qualified not what color their skin is, identity politics by the Democrats typical
Just like you did with the H1N1 virus, where you stopped testing, ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Biden the basement dweller
It does not mean Biden will lose.  This is a ridiculous threat.
I'm voting Biden
I really hope so. I'm disabled and now I'm forced to find a new place to live and my sister said she would get a place with me, but we just fall short of the income we need and my disability hardly gets me by. I'm praying for you Joe Biden. üòéüôèüèº
Trump is the one trying to tell America that a Biden presidency will lead to this when it's happening during his term. Either the president isn't responsible (and Trump's argument is BS) or he is (in which case this is on Trump, and his argument is BS).
Is that the same Joe Biden that Trump says hates religion and God?
If his tax deferral is implemented, Biden can campaign on the promise once he is elected, the debt will be forgiven.
Brilliant? It's easily countered by Biden coming out and saying the same exact proposal.  Id disagree with him as well.
Question why don‚Äôt you see biden signs or bumper stickers anywhere? I see Trump everywhere
Happy colonoscopy prep day to me.   Still better than a Biden speech.
Where‚Äôs  suspending your account for lying, oh that right twitter only attack conservatives. You‚Äôre a a liar and Marxist, Biden the basement dweller will never be President and America will never a socialist country.
I‚Äôm in Illinois too. There is only 1 candidate I was willing to knock on doors for, put up a sign in my yard, bumper stickers on my car, drive to Iowa to campaign for. And it isn‚Äôt Biden or Trump. I may write his name on the ballot. Still undecided. #ShouldaHadYang
I‚Äôm sure the Trump campaign will somehow turn it into a video of Biden riding his bike around his basement.
Not! I don‚Äôt like to be mean however why did he get rid of the pandemic team we didn‚Äôt need? Seemed Biden and Obama knew we needed one!
I‚Äôve seen 1 Biden sign I‚Äôve seen  1 ‚ÄúAnyone But Trump‚Äù sign And I‚Äôve seen 2 Trump signs That‚Äôs all, folks Zero enthusiasm for our next President during these unprecedented times Sad
Sad the Democrats cheer because people are unemployed they want to keep America closed, they fear monger and spread political propaganda. Worst run states and cities, are run by Democrats. They support basement dweller Biden,ü§£ü§£ #Trump2020Victory #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever
Twerp
Dumb ass
DONT BE COMPLACENT, PEOPLE‚Ä¶ as this video explains, Biden might be up 9 points, but when taking into account the margin of error, he may only be up 2.4 points.  Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1 but still lost the electoral collegeDebate my ass! You went after Biden with everything u had, u were not debating him. U were attacking him! U wanted to show his every racist side!

I say no no no mail in voting!!  Loved watching my President today on Fox! Great way to end it with the comments about Hiden Biden! He was probably lost in his backyard feeding the ducks!
When we have  these moron officials telling people to march and cause trouble in our streets no wonder there is so much trouble in our cities!  And when Biden and Harris r not coming out against this violent talk they add to the trouble!

I don't trust either to go left. Biden will just reinforce the status quo while doing nothing to address the issues that made the rise of Trump possible in the first place.

üíØ but they don't care about working people they only care about Putin and Russia if Trumpers really cared they would be voting for Biden and if they cared about the postal service they would be demanding funding. Trumpers until they start caring should stop buying things online
Thank God that Biden/Harris are on the scene to save our country.  As a senior, I have seen some shit in my day, but Trump is a dire threat to our democracy. Vote BLUE
You are scared shitless &amp; you should be. We BIDEN/HARRIS supporters are coming for you &amp; Pence. You can try stopping us with your fake voter fraud claims, but we are making it to the polls &amp; on November 3rd you‚Äôre lying ass is gone.Stay nervous.Stay veeeeery nervous
How can you alienate your own voters by attacking the postal service if people really care about the postal service then they should be voting for Biden if people don't care about the postal service they should do 2 things move out of the country and stop ordering things online.
So why is Biden your presidential candidate instead of Harris or Warren?  You apparently don‚Äôt practice what you preach!üê≠
Joe Biden is not going to close the concentration camps, any more than Obama closed Guantanamo Bay. He's going to give them a bipartisan stamp of approval and you're going to forget they even exist.

We have moved all of our planned theater performances into 2021. Update this week, stay tuned and stay healthy... and vote Biden/Harris!

Why is the big baby calling Biden a racist? Dump hates black ppl. That‚Äôs why him or his father didn‚Äôt rent to them back in the day. Or did crazy dump forget that? I think dump needs his moms teet again with all his crying!!
When Obama was President, we didn't have to use a mask. The country was never shut down. It wasn't always about him like Trump makes it out to be. When Obama and Biden were in office we were in a much better place as a country.

Joe you need to get some glasses, it will make you look better, younger, smarter and hide the eye wrinkles. BIDEN 2020!
I‚Äôm voting for Biden
No he won't, people want change. The only way he can win at this point is if he cheats. Biden is winning all ready according to some of (many) polls.
Does he not know he will be debating Biden not Harris Pence will be debating Harris and he will get whopped
whenever Biden is in trouble, he reaches out to the redbone community
READ THE THREAD.   We‚Äôre not just voting for Biden/Harris. We‚Äôre voting for so much more than that. And getting Trump out of office is just an extra added bonus.
Agreed. Trump has a strategy that will work with his base but he already has them. He doesn't seem to have one that will win over anyone outside his base. His best hope is to disaffect borderline Biden-Harris voters so they stay home instead.

I know a lot of people in  that really approve of what you're doing, but aren't thrilled with your charisma. PLEASE do whatever you can to win. This country is doomed if biden wins.  On November 4th you say whatever and however you want.  This country needs you and Pence .
Looking at Biden, he has a terrible record from his past- when it comes to race, for women, for rights. And it‚Äôs terrible, we all wanted Bernie. But what we can do is vote for the policies he has on the table right now, they aren‚Äôt the best- but tolerable compared to Trump.
Also, Warren's Senate seat could easily go to a Republican. No way Harris's seat flips.  Biden ain't that dumb. If he was on the fence, it wasn't between Warren and Harris.
Biden ain't that dumb. If it's down to Harris or Warren, Harris is the obvious choice. I was all in for Warren for President, but she's almost as old as Biden and would not be a good choice to succeed him. Harris is a good choice to be his successor.
I just can't believe a word Biden or Harris say. Friends, family, and strangers I find vote for them lose all my respect. Don't expect me to give a üí© if you are in trouble and need help. I will look you in the eye and laugh as you take your last breath. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Go play with your fidget spinner....  I‚Äôm listing to President Biden and Vice President Harris speak in complete sentences!!!
I won‚Äôt lie.... Biden‚Äôs speech was the most Presidential speech we‚Äôve gotten since Trumps been in office.... Because he cannot even articulate what‚Äôs going on in the world.
Does he mean better than Obama-Biden did for eight years when they threw $4 trillion at it.
Biden cares about regular Americans he will bring us jobs end hatred and bring change decency respect and dignity to the WH and to the world stage. The age of sexism will end and everyone saying sexist things about Harris will be held accountable and will lose their jobs.
Biden/Harris in TV.  You have got to win this election!  Our sanity and health depend on a win.  PLEASE
Biden doesn't tolerate sexist attacks against Kamala Harris and i don't either and i will end any friendship with people who say sexist things about Kamala. I am tired of the sexism we should've had a female president in 2016 and we will have a female VP.#BidenHarris2020Landslide
Kamala Harris and Biden have just came out the speech is now starting.#BidenHarris2020
She literally endorsed Biden.
How to Watch Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' First Appearance Together After VP Announcement   On Tuesday, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee&amp; Joe Biden&amp;
I see Biden as a place holder, he has moderate views that aren‚Äôt strong enough to get us where we need to go. But the important ticket is to prevent further damage done by Trump, hold the Supreme Court secure, and hopefully in 4 years elect an actual progressive.
Does Biden have a China policy? Or is he too busy lining his pockets (or those of his close relatives) with yuan?
Well i ain't taking a vaccine produced by Trump but I am willing to take one produced by Biden since he will be the one producing the vaccine to the public cause a blue tsunami is coming soon.#BidenHarris2020Landslide
üòÇ Biden got them bars!! ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black. You ain‚Äôt ain‚Äôt ain‚Äôt ain‚Äôt ain‚Äôt black‚Äù #melody
Trump can't spell even Cory correctly no wonder why Trump is frightened today. Kamala Harris can handle any attack coming from him and his base she will rise up and we will rise up and fire all the sexist bastards who refuse to vote for Biden cause he chose a woman.
i won‚Äôt take Ye seriously until I see him debating on the stage with Biden and Trump, in that moment my head will explode
Keep brown people out of the suburbs is all this is. I can't wait until.Biden wins and puts this country back on track and improves the lives of all the people not just the rich of white ones.
Biden looks like he's moving a lot because he's making up for twenty years of Democrats failing to keep up with American society‚Äîwhich they go away with (until 2016) because the Republicans are so far off center that Democrats didn't feel the usual pressure to keep pace.
If anything, Obama and Clinton were the outliers here. Both were well to the right of mainstream. Obama got away with it, but Clinton did not. Biden is trying not to repeat Clinton's mistake.
Democrats are supposed to be the majority party. Majority parties have to track with majority opinion or they stop being the majority party.  Biden is doing what every Democrat has done since 1930, and yet people like you act surprised when they do it.
You are so sneaky Bill. A real genius. Since Joe says he's running against Joe Biden, let's have Kamala debate Joe Biden.  #BidenHarris2020  #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
This thread perfectly articulates how I‚Äôve been feeling since Biden announced Kamala. Thanks for sharing  !
Read through the toxic Biden Bros in this thread threatening people for criticizing Biden.
Joe Biden has more American blood on his hands than just about anyone you could name, including terrorist leaders. That's not some small thing for you to condescend over.
Do you see how out of touch you seem dismissing peoples' problems with Biden as being "a ticket I 'dont like'"? Like that's psychotic
Biden is also not going to help with the environment or student debt. People with power do not willingly reduce their own power for the benefit of the powerless.
When will liberal Proggressives take ownership of what they‚Äôve created in this country! Division, censorship, hate of cops, hate if the US! Biden/Harris you are  #(D) evilAwakens
Trump says some men insulted that Biden vowed to name female VP Biden is expected to announce his running mate in the coming days.
Republicans attacked Biden for fumbling but this time he's the one struggling Karma in the works. Now we have the last word
Biden waited to announce, now the news cycle is so far removed from where it was when Kamala was running that most boomers have probably forgotten all the bullshit that went down
In order to gain the minority vote the Democrats add Kamala Harris as the VP, Harris called Joe Biden a rapist and a racist during the primaries and is a firm supporter of legislation that is killing major cities in the US (like Chicago). Hypocrites!
We will Biden locked down the black vote and took care of turnout problem even with all Trump's dirty tricks people will turnout cause of Biden's pick
The moment Biden picked Harris i was jumping up and down. I endorsed Harris for VP and what happened today made my day. This is what I needed after yesterday's derecho and tornadic storms

Maya Rudolph Reacts to Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's VP Pick   It's a good news day for comedy fans! When word of Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as his Vice Presidential running partner
All the people complaining about Harris also hate Joe Biden. I get that it's hard for a centrist to imagine someone having a self-consistent and honest worldview, but most people actually just don't like establishment politicians.
If you can point to someone who likes Chuck Schumer but hates Nancy Pelosi, loves Biden but hates Hillary, is a fan of Bloomberg and Elliot Engel but hates Amy Klobuchar, then sure. But that's not actually the kind of person you're going after, is it?
#teamKamala all the way. I am glad Joe Biden is comfortable with a strong, ambitious woman by his side. Godspeed.
"Anarchists should be prosecuted" -Joe Biden, July 2020
If you think I said Biden personally grabbed someone and threw him out of a moving helicopter, you really need to work on your comprehension of the English language
Joe Biden was meant to be a megachurch pastor but hes been lead astray. He hates doing this stuff, I want to save him
What exactly is it you're claiming? Are you denying all of the horrific violence I'm referring to happened? Are you claiming Biden somehow wasn't involved in any of it? Or are you saying that it doesn't matter because they mostly happened in the third world?
Yes, I am so awash in privilege that I'm familiar with the role Joe Biden has played in war crimes committed by the US since the early 1970s and think that those crimes actually matter
Biden supported Pinochet throughout his politicide. That's just a fact. I'm sorry if it offends you.
Joe Biden is the guy who throws leftists out of helicopters, not the guy who could be convinced to move left and enact meaningful change if we all just play ball
Biden‚Äôs VP pick is the first hopeful thing that‚Äôs happened in this country in a long time,
Biden choosing Kamala Harris should make this a slam dunk!!! #BidenHarris2020
All I have to say about the Biden/ Harris ticket is that we have to do our utmost to remove the cancer that is currently in the White House. Supporting the Democratic ticket is our only chance to do so.
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate       I can not believe it!!! As an Indian American, I‚Äôm proud and crying for joy!! üòçüò≠

Kamala Harris is Biden's running mate everyone it's now time for a dance party. We did it everyone. This is our moment and the Bernie Bros are going to be so mad. I like to thank the #khive for making this possible and everyone else who helped Kamala be the running mate
Putting it bluntly, the selection of Kamala Harris as Biden's VP is a big middle finger to the Bernie/AOC wing of the Democratic Party.

It looks like Joe Biden has chosen his co-loser.   Who will lose the election with him? We're waiting with bated breath... &lt;yawn&gt;
It was probably a promise they made to get him to drop out and endorse Biden when he did. He was pretty open that there was some kind of deal made, this was probably part of it

Trump doesn't flinch about anything, unlike some other wimpy presidents.  If that happened while Biden was in office,  he would have ran as fast as he could out the door.
$SPY anyone think market dips when Biden announces VP?
Perfectly illustrating media bias. Pelosi and Biden self-describe as "devout Catholics" and are reported as such with no verification. Pro-life Catholics are called "extremist" in spite of the tenet of the Catholic Church being pro-life.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, on Biden‚Äôs VP shortlist, created ‚Äúeviction diversion‚Äù program
This is not helpful if Biden picks Whitmer i would be cool with that she would make a great VP but she is needed in Michigan right now so it is unlikely that Biden will pick her
I would rather wait for Biden to announce it then to text and get my hopes up too high
I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump. I read the article. Biden doesn‚Äôt get to win simply because one person at CNN thinks he should. He has to earn it. I suspect the Dems wish he didn‚Äôt have to. The media should not be protecting a candidate. They wouldn‚Äôt if they believed in him.
I'd vote Biden if his pick was was snoopy the dog!
Lol trump say if Biden win China and Russia will own us (economy wise) and 401k and stocks will go down üßê
all Biden gotta say is he bringing back back page
Joe Biden will fix what  and the GOP destroyed ...the ballooning deficit is unbelievable ....apparently you only have a problem with a Black, Democrat President F‚Äôd up things.
There should be an ad of Biden repeatedly saying ‚ÄúPerson, woman, man, camera, tv. ‚Äú
Trump had to take a cognitive test.....   Biden doesn‚Äôt have issues!!
If he does Biden wins the election period there will be nothing Trump can do to win if that happens. No Republican has ever won without Texas if the GOP won Texas in 1976 Carter most likely wouldn't be president

Since Biden will announce his VP pick soon we don't know how soon it's time to get #BidenHarris2020 trending and make some noise. Who's with me?
makes a great point- Biden has improved in polling from 2016 by over 10% in the Midwest with white voters.

Joe Biden supports the murder of unborn children. A million a year. Have fun with that guy Mr moral.

I don‚Äôt know about that. I don‚Äôt use mine much.
For those who are wondering, I saw the first Biden 2020 car sticker and it was on a Prius. Pretty self explanatory.
If Donnie thinks this will get to Biden, he is wrong.    Now announced, I envision this will turn into another St John Church like clear the streets for the photo op incident. The protesters should come prepared for that eventuality.

Did Nader vote for the War or did Biden and Hillary? Pipe down
Of course you know any PowerPoint the Biden team puts together is gonna have paragraphs of text on each page and he‚Äôll end up just reading off of it
Biden took office when you could buy leaded gas. He was there for both oil shocks and both versions of CAFE.  In 4 years, you dropped oil to $0 and just made Isreal and the UAE BFFs. Going for peace in the entire Middle East and fixing CAFE in the next 4 years?
thinking ab the way someone explained voting for biden being taking a bullet to the leg while voting for trump is taking a bullet to the heart and honestly? yeah! like i‚Äôm not happy about it but at least i won‚Äôt DIE
When Biden first took office as a Senator, you could be leaded gas.
So if Biden and Harris was  to win the election she‚Äôs not a legit candidate according to the law so the president could refuse step down awesome
what are you talking about they both have said that they will vote for Biden and even if they didn't they live in Vermont and New York lol
I‚Äôll be voting in Illinois for Trump.  Maybe a miracle will happen and he‚Äôll carry the state!   Hard to imagine anyone voting for Biden on purpose.
Trump‚Äôs team is replete with excellent female talent.  Biden can only dream of having such a team.  Only a misogynist would foreclose the search for female talent by stating up front that men need not apply.  No confidence in women!
Sadly I am riding with Biden
We all now know the utter and criminal vindictiveness of Obama and his fellow Democrats, including Biden.  Should they return to power, Trump will be in mortal danger from their open corruption.  Democrats are at war with America.  Let‚Äôs defeat them.  #MAGA2020
Biden is also not in his right mind.  A presidential candidate in his condition is a complete embarassment for his party.  Trump is certainly a handful, but he‚Äôs been an amazingly effective president who keeps promises and works tirelessly for the benefit of all Americans.  #MAGA
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide mask mandate, citing health experts' predictions that it could save 40,000 lives over the next three months. What are your thoughts on a nationwide mask requirement?
We know why the Democrats and fake news outlets like Fox CNN ABC CBS etc. are not talking about it but why are Republicans and the president not talking about the fact that Harris parents weren‚Äôt citizens when she was born therefore she can never be president when Biden stepsdown
I mean... if you weren‚Äôt invited and Biden invited Kasich and Bloomberg?

Also: Joe Biden is the secret head of Antifa/BLM while *simultaneously* being a closet segregationist.
It was awful how Biden bragged about grabbing women by the pussy. Oh, wait.
Deadass all yalls reasons for why I should vote Biden are just why I shouldnt let Trump get elected. Stop pretending it's noble or patriotic to vote for him. It sucks, full stop.

Joe Biden introduced his newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, with the former vice president and California senator appearing for the first time together as the Democratic presidential ticket.
I swore during the primary I wasn't going to simp for Biden, but the amount of misinformation I see people who claim to be progressives are spewing about his policies / platforms is changing that really quickly.  Get informed. Get registered. Vote.
So the people vote for Biden and now they‚Äôre pushing them aside to replace him with Harris as always your vote means nothing in the Democratic plantation That‚Äôs what cnn is saying
I'd encourage you to read up on Biden's climate plan as well as Harris's voting record with regards to that topic before calling them evil.  They aren't as progressive as AOC / Bernie - but they have some good decisions behind them.
On yesterday‚Äôs VP podcast, your recommendation on how Biden and Harris explain the debate spat... reconciliation... perfect. Also, spot on with Harris needing work on her occasional snarky tone. Thanks.

I definitely hope u and Biden do not win even though I don't like Trump.. sounds like u want our country in debt for grand children to have to pay the stimulus back.. 2,000 for parents plus 2,000 per kid.  That is outrageous
So it's joe biden and kamala harris, huh? ... ... ...
I'm probably going to remember Joe Biden awkwardly pawing that quadraplegic's face while telling him he's valid or whatever for the rest of my life

Joe Biden is making his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris at 1 p.m. Wednesday.
I use to claim progressive until Dem primary. Bernie supporters/progressives became hostile to reality. Black people overwhelmingly VOTED for Biden and that was and still is ignored. Dont agree on policy, that's fine but the votes dont lie.
Kamala/Biden really? dems May have just lost California too! Kamala dropped out of the primaries right before she registered single digits in her home state! LOL
The kind that deals with Russian bounties on the heads of our soldiers, I hope! Vote for Biden-Harris!
actually, the point of the video was ‚Äújoe biden has a racism problem‚Äù. if you think that being the president of the united states for 4 years excuses the idea of having a (hypothetical) 6+ hour video proof of racist comments..... somn waaaay wrong here
It's strange here. Joe Biden was the choice population voted for, but government is Republican.
Duckworth is in her first term as Illinois' junior U.S. Senator.
Idk how to feel about Biden, like I hate him but isn‚Äôt Donald trump worse? I would literally vote for the squirrel in ice age over trump any day.
The fix is in. Harris is a long-tongued liar, a stooge, and a tool of a very dark agenda.   It started the day the 20 democrat candidates decided to drop out and make room for a dementia patient, Biden.  Now here we are.  Vote Trump 2020, GOP in all races.
I have been saying this ever since Biden got the nomination. They will use the 25th within 6 months of the Inauguration and Biden goes bye bye. Most important election in November! #Trump2020

You literally said ‚ÄúWhite guys telling Black voters‚Äù on a Trump tweet. Figured you were talking about Trump. I think both canditates are trash either way but I def wont be voting for Biden just cuz he has a Black running mate lmaooooo

"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
I stan the character development. RIP my morals but Biden üòî
Someone should print out all the tweets trump has posted since his election day and just have Biden and Harris lug it around to physically reference when asked what they'd do differently.
Leftists in the DNC had their change with Bernie, the dem party internally worked to shut him out and actively backed Biden and lo and behold he's the nominee. It's actively depressing and I think that's the idea after a certain point
And Biden not having enough of a policy or belief system to care that that's what his campaign is
I can't imagine this is anything other than the dem establishment thinking they get use fear of Trump to scrub the left leaning elements out of the party and use a Biden win as a sorta counter to Hillary showing that no, centrists don't beat fascists
anyway Biden is probably going to manage to lose now and i'm gonna go play more Shenmue
The whole Biden nomination process is wild because it's so directly disconnected to everything happening in the zeitgeist today. Like he doesn't back medicare for all, he doesn't support decriminalizing illegal immigration or defunding ICE, he's make a cop his VP
The progressive vote is going to be from mostly young voters I think, and young voters need inspired to vote. I don‚Äôt think Kamala or Biden are going to inspire the youth. I personally feel like Biden was the appeal to the moderate swing voters. He is the status quo.
The lady who has locked people up for weed then laughs on stage about giving tried weed herself. That along with her peak in the polls being 15% shows she isn‚Äôt super popular amongst progressives, which Biden needs to win.

BREAKING: Joe Biden has chosen California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
There are still plenty of folks who voted Trump in 2016 because they believed he was a "lesser of two evils"  If you think the VP selection doesn't matter, you're wrong.   Biden can't just look "less evil"; he has to look good.
Joe Biden is on the cusp of announcing the biggest, and possibly most consequential, decision of his political career with the unveiling of his running mate.

As if voting for Biden isn't wasting a vote. Your statement is utterly irresponsible and disgusting. If ANY presidential candidate were to shoot someone on 5th Ave, they should be eliminated immediately. And to express approval of such an act PROVES what is wrong in this country!
They don‚Äôt understand fully what‚Äôs about to happen.  Then when April comes along and Trump is not in office they‚Äôll blame Biden.
The name Andriy Derkach sounds familiar Ron?  It should since the Kremlin linked Ukrainian admitted he is passing you and Grassley info. He betrayed you Ronnie. Doesn‚Äôt sound like you have a problem with Russia after all.

Saw progressives doing this a lot with Biden clips during the primary season too.  This is an example of the media playing you.   They don't want you informed, they want you angry, because angry generates engagement and on social media engagement is profit.

Trump vs Biden Twitter war.
Combine this with the "you ain't black" if you don't vote for him and Joe Biden is looking pretty racist right now
West said ‚¨á   ‚ùå slavery was a choice &amp; Harriet Tubman didn't help slaves  ‚ùå he wears a MAGA hat and Confederate flag  ‚ùå he has a mental illness which seems to be inconsistently treated  These factors appeal more to Trump's base than Biden's
Right? I don't care if Biden picks a cactus!! Vote them all out!  And fill out your census! üòÄThose kids will be held in those facilities Trump or no Trump. I think it should be looked at in terms of changing how children and families from a foreign country are held, but it certainly isn't going to change under Biden.
Is Barr the new Comey? Trump seems to like reruns. We can conclude Barr is going to do the same shit Comey did to HRC. Would not surprise me if it was done to Harris in late September. Biden in middle to late October. Forewarned is forearmed. Street fighting ain't fair.

Agreed. I guess I‚Äôm just surprised because with a lot of mail in ballots coming in soon... this very much affects Biden. Especially if ‚Äúblue‚Äù areas are targeted by this nonsense.
80 percent of dems and a majority of Republicans support ending cannabis prohibition.  If biden cant even get on board with this common sense policy,  well hes obviously corrupt and only interested in his big money donors.
Biden should update his policies to reflect what his voters want then shouldn't he? After all politicians are supposed to be public servants.
What does this have to do with Biden ducking interviews and questions? Why Does the left always want to change the subject and not answer questions?
PSA calls it as they see it.  I'm a huge fan.  Biden clearly takes nothing political said about him personally.  So my response is a huge "So What?"
Some Republicans. That doesnt tell us anything. Biden is more popular with some Republicans.
These WH Press conferences always end up being China‚Äôs fault, everyday with Trump. Joe Biden‚Äôs right, Whiny!
Wow a huuuuuuuggggggee crowd must be employees of Biden and Harris
I can get over with a gradual improvement to our healthcare system. Partially because I am a realist and no fucking way that single payer will happen in the next decade and not because of Biden, because of US citizens and because of SCOTUS.
Even FDR needed to be forced left. Thing is voters actually did it. They didn't vote him in then check out. In 2010 and 2014 voters said we voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 so we can take the election off. U want progressive change u vote Biden and progressives and in 2023

There might be reasons that Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate Trump, but your analogies make no sense. Joe McCarthy and Robert Welch didn‚Äôt run for President....also I‚Äôm pretty sure the first Presidential debate was Kennedy/Nixon. The next was Ford/Carter in 1976
Interesting. I‚Äôve never seen any group so scared to have their nominee debate as I have so much with Biden. What is the fear?

Your kidding, right? Biden hasn‚Äôt had anybody ‚Äùrecovery‚Äù because he hasn‚Äôt been president! And, as others have pointed out, these are just people returning to jobs they already had. And let‚Äôs not forget the 1.2 million new unemployment claims over the last week. Bunch of idiots
Biden won't even commit to correcting cannabis prohibition which has ruined hundreds of thousand of lives and has 80% support from his party.  Simply not being trump isn't good enough.guess what the Republicans are pissed about the mail!!! You are Biden's best helper!
