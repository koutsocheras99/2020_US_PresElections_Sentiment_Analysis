Is it a surprise that China (people of color) favors Biden and Russia (predominantly White) favors Trump? Their preferences merely align with the racial preferences of Americans.
Joe Biden talks like Microsoft Sam
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúBiden National Volunteer Call with Special Guests‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
diminish joe biden? why i mean he's kind of dumb. he don't have that big of a personality cult. billionaires don't like him. minority voters don't like him. working class people don't like him. republicans like joe biden though.
gay guys don't like biden. indians don't like biden. seeing biden have to apologize to black community over insensitive comments. hispanics don't like biden. not being trump is his only advantage. i hate you south carolina.
In fact, HRC lost MI, WI, &amp; PA with a combined 0.76% total vote. Trump literally squeak out the window. And HRC was just so toxic. The election is up in the air, but Trump has an uphill battle. Biden is live in AZ, FL, GA, IO, NC &amp; SC. Hell, Trump has had to put money in TX!
I‚Äôm old enough to have voted since ‚Äò00. The ‚Äô16 polls were right though. No polls said landslide. All were within MoE. National polls had HRC winning &amp; she indeed won the popular x 3M votes. She lost MI x 3k votes and didn‚Äôt even campaign there. Biden isn‚Äôt making that error.
Personally I would rather a nuclear war happen under a President Trump than a President Biden.  I'm really thinking about this. Ultimately maybe I do hope I vote for the loser.
Joe Biden is a racist misogynist old man and I'm ashamed of the Democratic Party picking him but I'm like everyone else and I live in an imperfect world and I'll vote for the old fuck ders myself.
If I were Joe Biden my number want in a vice president would be a person who would be able to ease nuclear nation relations. That is not Karen Bass. That is not Tammy Duckworth (honey I love you to the sun and back you will be president one day). Only Kamala Harris can ease this.
Karen Bass is not a unity pick.  I'm sorry she's not. The world is in complete disarray. I will vote for Biden/Bass if that's what it is. Kamala Harris is a world unity candidate. Ya'll dumb and if it was to me I'd challenge you in your precinct and you'd lose that party position
The governor's of each state are the ones keeping things shut down. If you would like trump to call an executive order to open all great! ...but then you will just complain he overstepped... So what exactly will you do different Biden??
I think it's elder abuse and humiliating the way Biden is thrust into this role by power hungry Democrats only to make a fool of himself over and over again. That's the reality
Biden: God, could my dad drive a car?  God: No  Biden: Oof
Biden's mental cave in ... Hannity hammers Biden after 'weird, strange, embarrassing public breakdown': 'What's going on here?'
Chicken Joe.. Fred Fleitz: If Biden skips debates with Trump here's how our enemies will read it
A blind person with an IQ of 65 can listen to and see' that Biden has some level of dementia. You just can't pretend it's not there.
Attention Liberals!.... You are being duped by the most racist media and Democratic party in the history of America!!!.... Joe Biden has lost what mind he had!But you can clearly see the mind that he did have was very very very...... "Racist"!!!!. Vote these morons out of office
Joe Biden did say some stupid shit. But that is Biden. He‚Äôs a fucking gaffe machine. I don‚Äôt believe it makes him racist though. Over 40 years he‚Äôs worked across the aisle with POC and the African-American caucus. Received their endorsement &amp; won the primary based on black votes.
Come on bro! This is not the war you want to fight with Donald Trump on the other side. Biden made a gaffe and immediately apologized. Trump on the other hand has trafficked in racism For decades. He was the original ‚Äúbirther‚Äú in chief. Hounding Obama for not being born here.
I actually agree with you, That is what the electoral college is for, and I‚Äôm a Biden voter in Kentucky. There‚Äôs no need to eliminate it. But absentee / mail-in voting, early voting and same-day registration need to be the law of the land, too many people disenfranchised in M/A
And polls are going his way. He's either ahead or tied with Biden in the battleground states.
sounds good to me. now chyyyyna, bidens friends, might prove him wrong and not do it. thats not Trumps fault. just another reason Trump is kicking chyyyna, bidens friends in the balls instead of licking them like biden does
Joe Biden made some very inappropriate and racist comments. His apology isn‚Äôt an apology but an attempt to say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what I meant‚Äù when he clearly said what he denies saying. Joe Biden and Donald Trump. These are the people we have to choose from.
Well let's see if Joe Biden would have been president he would have let all Chinese come into the United States! Instead of shutting the border like Trump did! So I would say right now we would probably have about 2 million dead! Thank God for Trump!
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Biden couldn't say s*** if he had a handful of it!!!!.....lmfao....I,I,I,I mean "Come on man"..."Are you a junkie"? I mean "Come on man"!!... "You horse dick pony soldier"! I mean come on man do you snort cocaine! "Come on man"!!!....."Wait a minute I think I see Corn Popp"!!!!!
so now as a real Republican I have to find a party to support. Of course it's gonna be independents but this year I'll definitely be voting for Biden! I'd much rather have a Democrat than a sexual predator, criminal and racist! Never! It's not REPUBLICAN! We live by r morals
Biden just made a huge racist comment today he thinks that way all his life
Democrats racism on full display Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity
Biden: "Poor kids are just as smart and just as talented as white kids."
I like your style. Can't possibly defend what Biden said but you want to say something... Change the subject. Classic liberal move. Well done, I doubt anyone noticed. Thanks for the wisdom.
If trump said this Liberals would lose their minds, but since it‚Äôs joe Biden they don‚Äôt care
Joe Biden really gets pissy when a black person asks him a question about anything. ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù or ‚Äúare you a junkie‚Äù
Wow! Notable exceptions! That means a few. What is wrong with this guy. Biden's handler must have been given the night off... This isnt just a misunderstanding this is what he actually thinks...
What will markets do if Trump wins election night but Biden wins weeks later via mail in ballots?
I agree!!!  That‚Äôs my biggest problem with him.  He had a chance to unite.  Chose poorly!!!  Real bad.  But.....can he get all of ‚Äúus‚Äù citizens  back to work?   All of us!   Yes.  Biden, Liberals?   No.  When I say ‚Äúus‚Äù meaning all citizens of the USA.
UGH. I hate how you can just....say things on Twitter. This is a terrible take, I know many people who supported Warren when she was still in the primary, who then switched to supporting Bernie when she dropped out, and are now going to vote for Biden.
Dude you don't know what Alzheimer's is. My mother is suffering through the horrible disease right now. So stop trying to be funny, because it's insulting to people personally taking with someone or who have taken care of someone with the disease! Biden does not have it!
Based on this small poll, Biden voters should stop expecting people to collapse under their "Never Trump" pressure and just vote green or write in Sanders. 'Incremental' change is better than Trump isn't it?
"Vote for Biden because he isn't Trump" is not going to win my vote. Biden and his campaign have to do better.
Joe Biden actually has a plan for getting us through this pandemic and building back stronger. Your boss inherited a booming economy and squandered it just like with daddy‚Äôs $. Hope you can speak Russian. Might want t learn. #KayleighLies #TrumpLiesPeopleDie  #Dems4USA  #VoteBlue
It‚Äôs breaking because of how it‚Äôs happened.  A bunch of republican lawyers got signatures from the public to put his name on the ballot to try and take black votes from Biden. Just 1% can be the difference.
A bunch of republican lawyers put his name on the ballot to try and take black votes from Biden.
Neither Biden nor Trump are gonna win a medal in the speech Olympics, but at least Joe can blame a terrible stutter for his foibles. What‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs excuse?
Marxists have kidnapped Biden‚Äôs brain!
You do realize Biden‚Äôs been through multiple debates and given myriad interviews. Right? And how are you gonna talk about Biden‚Äôs competence when Trump sounds like he‚Äôs in late stage dementia. He pronounced Yosemite as Yo Semite üòÜ You‚Äôre in a bubble.
Yard signs are your metric? Ever consider ppl like myself in red/purple states wouldn‚Äôt dare post a Biden yard sign or put on a bumper sticker for fear of retribution? Trump voters are flipping out in Target over wearing a mask. I don‚Äôt need my house egged or tires slashed.
Biden isn‚Äôt my favorite but he‚Äôs at least competent &amp; will surround himself with people who will know what they‚Äôre doing unlike Jared Kushner in every spot just b/c he‚Äôs his son-in-law. Biden wrote an Op-Ed in the NYT in Jan of its danger. Trump was golfing for 3 weeks in March!
Many of the riots were by anarchists who just wanna see things burn and ANTIFA who are not Dem‚Äôs and hate Biden. The virus was bungled by Trump. He said it was a hoax, then it was just 15 ppl who had it and it‚Äôd be 0 soon, that it‚Äôd just ‚Äúgo away‚Äù w/out a vaccine. He DQd himself.
Those can not be told until Biden is sworn in on 1/20/2021.
Joe Biden will avoid debating at all costs . Possibly one might take place but his team will not allow him to be examined too closely in the Public eye . They know he can pull this off by dodging controversial questions about his ability to function mentally.
Take a break from Trump and report real news&gt; Why won't Biden take a cognitive test? See? I did your job for you
This is just an excuse to avoid speaking in front of people and to ultimately not have to face  because Trump is going to eat Biden alive in the same way a pig is devoured in a tank of piranhas!  #KAG2020TrumpLandslideVictory
i told joe biden my generation will be authoritarians. i told that to donald trump to. hey you guys i'm 40 years younger than you. obviously you're not from my generation. DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Plus Dr. Alan Lichtman who has predicted every race correct since 1984 and his model has worked since 1860 just today said that his prediction for 2020 is Joe Biden win.
joe biden the next biggest regret of my life.
Biden Will Accept Nomination In Delaware  I'm voting 4 ya Joe but I don't have much faith in your decision making process. To Dated not a fresh thinker. I don't think Joe has Dementia I just think that's who he is. Elitist white man. Is this Texas does he have an excuse. KAMALA
You‚Äôre the one sending all the fake stuff Bob. Biden is still wayyyyy ahead. You‚Äôre losing Bob
Yes Vote Biden
I hope when Biden wins he puts mr kirschner in charge of the Trump administration crimes against the people
Angela, I usually agree with you 100%. This time, I can't. #CryBabyTrump has ultimately made it clear, he doesn't want to debate Joe Biden. He is just acting like he does because he knows he has to. He'd gladly not turn over his taxes if it got him out of the debates.
Thanks!! I blocked Trump, Biden, politics and election. Let's see hoe that goes.
biden is the nominee and i'm gonna vote for him and democrats can bad mouth him and maybe republicans also to me but only if you say something useful. you're just not important enough to let trash talk biden to me.
Democrats Press for a More Visible Biden  I hope not.  I'm gonna have to gag my way through these 4 years. I'm voting for Biden but he makes me vomit.
Nice try but Biden has agreed to 3 debates. Let‚Äôs not forget that it was Trump who didn‚Äôt want to debate Biden
Watch this video, and let‚Äôs take a moment of silence for the Trump supporters who want to harp on Biden for being incoherent.
Keep telling yourself that.  You need to go ahead and get ready to whine and point blaming fingers when Biden loses.  Just remember that when he does, your finger should be pointed at him, not those who refused to support him.
Not even worth discussing: 1. Biden didn't run in 2016. 2. We don't have time travel. That kind of argument is useless to make, because we simply do not and cannot know how he would have responded. Biden and the DNC are just as corrupt as Trump and the Repubs. Both are equal shit
WHAT!? Biden is planning higher drug prices!? You've had 3 1/2 years to lower prices. Busy golfing?
one demagogue for another unless Joe Biden changes his ways these BIBLICAL PROPHECIES will come true.  listen joe you know your cult is weak anyways. don't go down that path. now i know you know it. arrogance is sin. you did the same thing to obama. in that regards you are racist
Kamala Harris is the only acceptable answer. Joe Biden should not stand against the will of God. Pick Kamala Harris. Get over yourself and do it.
Bullshit. There is NO better choice when you're talking Biden and Trump.  By voting for either, you're wasting your vote. NEITHER party will EVER change, and voting for their candidates only empowers them to continue ignoring you.
Memo to Biden: Cut Your Ties to Larry Summers!  #P4SED
You're right, it won't make a difference.  We KNOW Trump is a piece of crap.  But, so is Biden. Some of us actually pay attention to politicians. If people think he cares about us rather than his own interests, then he has them fooled just as much as Obama did.
I'm not going to sit here on Twitter listing every time I have watched Biden speak over the last several decades. I know his record, I've heard him speak, for a long time, as I have done with a large number of politicians.  I wish more people would do the same.
The fact that Biden is the best option the Democrats have to offer for the presidential election is pretty sad.
Oh, he will still be president. Not from delaying the election or pulling some sneaky shit after the election...   simply won't win the election. I hate Trump as much as anyone, but that is the sad reality. Biden simply does NOT have the support he needs.
3/3  All of this could be avoided with M4A, which Biden will NEVER support.
I didn't say I wasn't voting. I'm just not voting for Biden or Trump.  Again, with the insults. Insults make for the most compelling arguments. Wins people over every single time, what with the "maturity" it takes to dole them out.
What rage?  I'm simply holding to my principles by not supporting a candidate whose policies and character I don't agree with.  Keep up the insults, though. I'm sure people like you will start dishing them out tenfold once Biden loses.
For much of the same reasons that I won't support Biden.
Why is it when you hardcore Dems face someone who stands for their ideals you resort to insults?  Oh, yeah, that's because you know Biden isn't going to win, so you're playing the pre-blaming game, trying to blame the voter instead of the candidate.
No way Biden debates Trump. I hope he does, it would be hilarious to see Trump shred him... Not gonna happen though. The puppet master pulling Bidens strings will make sure of that.
It‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs white voters.
Ah, another vote-shamer. When  loses, it will be his failure, not mine.   I will not support a candidate whose policies and character I oppose.  So, no vote for Biden OR Trump for me.  Its time we stand up for our principles instead of supporting our corrupt duopoly.
biden should say that people who refuse to wear the mask in public spaces should be fined.
This is the first time I can say I've been genuinely excited about voting for Joe Biden.
is going to destroy  Biden has been in DC for nearly 50 yrs &amp; has nothing but failure upon failure to show for it + a history of racism he cannot run away from! Couple that with the fact that he has abt 3 brain cells. GOOD LUCK!
"Biden is a calming caretaker for our democracy, not the face of the Democratic Party‚Äôs future. His vice-presidential pick shouldn‚Äôt be determining that, either."
It means he is better, tho, and that‚Äôs what counts right now. Stop trying to denigrate Biden. It‚Äôs imperative that we get rid of trump, and Biden is the only way. Please shut up til after the election if you don‚Äôt have anything good to say about Joe. #AmericaStrongerWithBiden
I've changed my mind. I am now fine with Harris as VP. Biden is not a 2 term president and she will be better than the other choices.
Robin Williams jokes about rambling Joe Biden
Thank you Sizzle. Love you and our group of resisters and what we do. Together we will get Biden and Dem candidates elected.
Under Biden as VP ..Isis was on TV all the time , Benghazi happened, Obamacare no one picked up phone, economy no where near as good as under Trump..what is it you want to do again Biden?
No.  I won't fall in line.  I won't settle.  I will not support corruption.  I will not vote for either Biden or Trump.  IF Biden were elected (which he won't win), he would not work toward ANY policy that I support. He's already said he won't.  Nothing will fundamentally change.
Neither Biden nor Trump have policies that I agree with. If you think Biden is for climate change, LGBTQ rights, etc, then you haven't been paying attention to his record or what he has said this cycle. He is just as corrupt and self-interested as Trump.
They‚Äôre betting on whoever they choose for his VP to step up early in the term to become president. So the election will be Trump vs Biden‚Äôs VP.
Biden doesn't support those things, either.
Why is this so hard to understand? Neither Biden nor Trump has my support. When Biden loses, it will be because HE failed to earn enough support to win.   I will not support him because he is just as corrupt as Trump. I am standing for my principles,  just as so many others are.
Oh, I'm voting, just not for Biden or Trump.   As far as privilege,  that argument is fucking stupid. You know nothing about me to make that judgement.  Perhaps if Biden were a better candidate who supported policies I agree with, he might have a chance. His loss, his failure.
i told peeps i was like ya'll writing off alexandra owensby a little bit. she's got yarmuth, hicks, schoder, biden and mcgrath gonna run democrat ads all around me. and yes i will also sponge off of paula jean in west virgina. you gonna have to soak it all and use it for yourself
This whole "privilege" accusation for standing up for my principles and not voting for Biden or Trump has went from annoying to infuriating.  I can't help if  is a shit candidate only interested in himself and his corp backers.  I won't settle. I won't fall in line.
He IS opposed to prog policies. He has repeatedly made it know nothing will change. He has said he will only be a 1 term pres.  Biden is only interested in himself and his corporate backers, not the people.
That's not how elections work. When Biden loses, it will be because HE failed to get enough support to win.   This vote shaming, Biden-losing-blaming, has went from annoying to infuriating.
Again, stop blaming voters for the failures of the candidates.   When Biden loses, it will be because HE could not get enough support to win.   Why is that so hard to understand?
You people just don't get it. When Biden loses, that will be HIS failure, not ours.
It‚Äôs so funny to me that right wingers consider the 2 pres candidates to be ‚Äúextreme.‚Äù Like people say ‚Äúif the dems weren‚Äôt so extreme maybe I wouldn‚Äôt vote for Trump.‚Äù Biden is literally THE MOST moderate candidate the DNC could‚Äôve possibly put up, in my mind he is a republican
Biden is a pedophile.
I don‚Äôt think Biden ever suggested drinking bleach or supported putting Hispanic children in cages...Biden and Trump couldn‚Äôt be more different
Anyone else notice Trump is struggling to poll over 45% in battleground states? Meanwhile Biden is often at 50% or above
Biden up in these states means he‚Äôs winning the Rust Belt by bigger margins. NC and GA would be icing on the cake
You're trying for a "gotcha" argument, which won't work.  Yes, Trump is detestable.  So is Biden. His actions are easily traceable, do your own research. Vote for him if you wish, that is your right.  I simply will NOT support the corruption either represents.
I'll have to disagree with your prediction, Ryan, as much as I generally support you.   Biden does not have enough support to win.
Biden should steal his slogan for 2020
Biden should pick up the slogan
2020 Biden should adopt your slogan. NOW we DO need to make America great again. 2016 we were already great. Thanks for nothing.
America FIRST.. Chuck DeVore: Trump energy policy key to reviving economy ‚Äî Biden plan would destroy jobs, raise energy costs
No hiding the truth.. Karen Bass, on Biden VP shortlist, scrambles to explain remarks on Castro, Scientology
Biden keeps thinking he will win without ever offering anything at all.
Biden's not gonna be the president y'all can chill out and go back to being friends now...
i'm gonna do some phone banking tomorrow for amy mcgrath so i'll make up for some of these hate tweets today at biden for ya democrats. k.
every time biden or someone from his orbit trashed kamala harris i'm gonna scream at him on twitter or one way or the other.
another thing that pissed me off about biden was the gay marriage supreme court ruling. biden waited till basically right before it happened. he only voted for 2 of the justices on the supreme court and it was obama who appointed 2 more and 1 republican. opportunist biden.
Kamala Harris may be the only one strong enough to bring together a world wide coalition to begin to wage war on the climate emergency. Joe Biden is a weak old man.
I'll personally be extremely insulted in Joe Biden offers Kamala Harris the Attorney General's job.  Secretary of State sure. By the day I like that man less and less. Joe has got to get this news cycle turned away from this story it is pissing people off.
has another #mask #trending today, but I think it should be this one!  #yeswecanagain
Bullshit. Taking PAC money is at the heart of corruption. It has to start somewhere. If you think ANYTHING is given back from corp contributions, you're either really naive or willfully blind. Biden and the DNC are just as shitty as Trump.
Vote for Trump than Biden. U r racist old man. The dems luv Chao don't care about the rioters, lies &amp; committing treason w/u help. U let biden when on his merit not u lying for him.
This is the funniest thing I've read today. Just hope biden isn't in assisted living b4 the election.
Fact -  does not have the support he needs to win, and won't get it.  Fact - Biden and the Dem party will NOT move towards progressive policies. They have stated they will not.  Fact - Voting for EITHER Biden or Trump will give further legitimacy to our corrupt system.
As much as I despise Trump, I simply won't support Biden, just as I could not support HRC in 2016.
No, most of us aren't going to vote Biden. Where the fuck have you been?
we are all going to be living in a hell if pedo sex assaulter hair sniffer biden gets in
Can we make Trump v Biden debates pay per view? Donate proceeds to Covid relief!
Can we make Trump v Biden debates a pay per view? Donate all the proceeds to Covid relief efforts!
I thought it was sort of treacherous of Dodd to say that Biden requires loyalty to him. Excuse me Mr. Dodd Kamala Harris is loyal to the US Constitution first and if you're not get away from the presumptive Democratic nominee.
i seen some starting to say #wwjd and that's probably not a bad strategy. a lot of holiness minded people do not want to vote for biden.  you making it hard on us. it's effective with a niche population, ain't it?
joe biden's climate change plan is suicide anyways. i want him to pick kamala harris or i probably won't in the president's race. i don't like biden or trump but i hate mitch mcconnell.
yep. i'm really mad at chris dodd for saying kamala harris was ambitious like that old fogey wasn't. so offensive. i don't like him. never did. peeps like him make me cringe at the democrats. dementia joe taking things for granted.
This is the reality of American politics. If Trump doesn‚Äôt win he will claim fraud. If Biden doesn‚Äôt win he will claim fraud. Either way, America loses.
Kamala Harris will check Biden the whole way. I love Kamala Harris I have to tolerate Biden.  You know he's just to much of a bank Democrat for me but these are unusual times and even Senator Harris says that everyone is on deck to defeat Trump.
trump supporters are starting to approach my social media again, unless they post or directly say something racist i'm not gonna block any of them.  i'll tell them what they told me, i proved it though, see if you do, i survived trump so far you'll survive biden. gonna make it.
Ah, John, You'll be fine. Everyone loses every once in a while. It was a hard 4 years for me. I'm sure you're not rich enough for it to matter about Biden being President and even if you are I don't care. :)
Dem lunatic Biden gets slammed Biden questions whether coronavirus vaccine will be 'real,' despite experts' assurances
Racist ex president Obama slammed..  Levin bashes Obama eulogy for John Lewis, calls Biden 'a quasi-Bull Connor and a quasi-George Wallace'
Democrat communists can lie along with jinpings best friend Joe biden but Americans know the truth...  Americans blame China for its role in the spread of coronavirus, survey finds
Please Vice President Biden send a stronger message to the nation we need democracy And leader ship we do not need tyranny and suppression
He's the only pres. to give over double to negro universities to help them. I wish u &amp; other media to step back &amp; really be honest about everything Trump has done good &amp; biden has said
If that's the case, he should finish his work on time like the rest of his Republican classmates.   A perfectly capable genius that can memorize his cognitive words should be able to rig an election by the deadline. You don't hear Joe Biden asking for extensions.
What an idiot.  Joe Biden was right, again.
You‚Äôre right man. Americans do need to focus on winning this election. If Biden wins we truly are screwed.
That's true,  but I think it's a younger generation issue, alot of people get their news from memes,  so if they read it they won't fact check it.   My parents and grandparents don't use social media and LOVE Biden.
So, a man who has voted by mail in for the last 4 elections says it‚Äôs fraud??? Imagine being so scared of losing that you want to postpone the election indefinitely. It‚Äôs insane that out of so many people in this country our options were Trump/Hillary and now they‚Äôre Trump/Biden.
He was the only one who closed travel , Fauci and Berks said not too, Joe Biden and World Heath and Nancy called him xenophobic Nancy even out out a bill to force  to reopen travel wow ! NY and NJ gov did stupid, that killed thousands
I'm voting for Joe Biden but Europe should defend itself.  Europe has a long history of being anti migrant anyways.
FACT: ANYONE VOTING FOR DEMENTIA JOE BIDEN IS ACTUALLY VOTING FOR HIS V.P PICK TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT. BIDEN WILL BE IN THE OVAL OFFICE LESS THAN SIX MONTHS BEFORE BEING FOUND UNFIT AND THAT WILL MOVE THE V.P TO PRESIDENT.
Mre than biden will.
And that is Biden's fault, for being a shit candidate and being just as corrupt as Trump. Biden is part of the same problem and will NOT help the people. He's already said himself that things won't fundamentally change if he were pres.  Go fly a kite with your vote shaming crap.
Again, since you can't seem to understand, Biden's loss will be HIS failure. This is 2016 all over again. Dems are losing and seeking to blame people who won't support their shit candidate before the election is even over. Take your vote shaming somewhere else.Is it just me or does Joe Biden resemble Clark Griswold's brother-in-law Eddie from the National Lampoon movies with the extremely inappropriate things that he says as if he doesn't know better but with Joe you know he does?  I see a meme coming..  #YouAintDiverse #YouAintBlack
I honestly don't know how Biden can move passed this one. There is no way to spin this other than exactly what he said in my opinion.  #YouAintDiverse  Iraq War Vet: Biden's Diversity Comment Shows How Democrats 'Really Feel About Black Americans'
Don‚Äôt vote for joe Biden vote for trump 2020
Been saying all along the easiest path to victory for Trump is to beat Biden from the left
It was the early actions taken by President Trump that saved millions from dying. Had he allowed flights from China, who actually released the virus on the world, to continue this would have been 10 x's worse. You, Joe Biden, would not have the chutzpah to stop China on anything!
Nope they're straight up using him to beat the bad orange man and its not going to work. Even the reasonable people who don't like Trump understand Biden is in deep cognitive decline. It's not even about politics anymore he needs help not running a campaign.
So the right are the only ones getting the virus now? If that‚Äôs the case the polls are wrong showing Biden in the lead
They‚Äôre trying to paint him like joe Biden, and it doesn‚Äôt work
Just remember if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, then you ain‚Äôt black. Can‚Äôt get more racist than that
Mite be sometbing if this was actually created and spoke by Biden. This is nothing more than damage control by campaign aides. Biden is a racist and we know this because of his POLICIES. Shitlibs and gop always assume their voters are just as dumb as their candidates
Sir you are both delusional. Trump is the worst President ever. Biden 2020
Name one "latinx" country without people of African descent? Biden was saying "I got my African Americans."
This guy is a BernieBuster. Not a Bernie supporter. There‚Äôs a giant difference that I acknowledge. And Bernie did get his clock cleaned, before Bernie dropped out Biden was up 2 million+ votes.
Fred Fleitz: If Biden skips debates with Trump here's how our enemies will read it
Nice comment and funny how you forgot about Biden discussing African Americans versus Latinos. Had Trimp made that same comment the riots would double.
I miss Robin Williams and as for Joe Biden let's just say no one will be quoting him after he's gone because no one understands what the hell he's talking about when he speaks without a teleprompter which trust me he doesn't write his own speeches he just plagiarizes others.
Serious answer: On November 3 one of two people will be elected. Trump or Biden. That‚Äôs it. We have a first past the post system here in the United States and your socialist candidate got clobbered.
Ugh, the MAGATs are annoying, but you BernieBusters are the worst. Biden clobbered you. It‚Äôs over.
You mean like Biden just clarified? So it‚Äôs ok for trump but not anyone else?
Thank you Vice President Biden. We should all admit when we make foolish rhetorical mistakes and learn from them.
Starting to wonder if Biden is running or if it‚Äôs a team effort since he doesn‚Äôt speak for himself
"Mark Jacoby, a Republican and executive at a company called Let the Voters Decide, has reportedly collected signatures for West in Ohio, West Virginia, and Arkansas."
Ridiculous ... Joe Biden has been praying throughout his years of highs and lows - Trump only addressed a deity when his mushroom got polished. Prayer requires empathy, something #45 lacks throughout.
Where do you all get the idea that Biden‚Äôs going to do away with 2nd amendment rights? Fake news! No one wants to take away gun rights. I am a liberal and I don‚Äôt care if people have guns and I‚Äô#TheFive
I don‚Äôt know how trump can say Biden hates god, wants to hurt him, but his campaign uses pics of Biden praying to show he‚Äôs weak...either he‚Äôs a man of faith or he‚Äôs not. You can‚Äôt have it both ways #TrumpCantKeepItUp
Biden will confiscate as many guns in 4 years as Obama did in 8.
And you morons want this man to lead you? Myself I apologize for Joe Biden and his ignorant comments. He clearly is the worst choice the Dems has and yet made it as their best choice. The Democratic Party has never been more embarrassing than now. Vote RED all across the board üá∫üá∏
Ok I‚Äôve officially witnessed someone wanting to vote for Biden. Unfortunately for you that will not secure his role as POTUS! RED wave forever. No more picking and choosing based on qualifications. I will only vote red from now on. Keep fighting the good fight Ronny!! üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è

Democrats Wimp Out on Federal Marijuana Legalization. Thanks, Joe Biden!
So Biden wants to increase funding for police, ban ‚Äúassault weapons,‚Äù and arrest anarchists.  Guys, I‚Äôm not voting for him. I‚Äôm just not.
Biden makes one Fucking ad appealing to boomers and the Bernie Bros lose their minds, just like they lost the primary. This bullshit is why Bernie couldn‚Äôt get elected. You guys are so arrogant. It‚Äôs all about what you want. Fuck other people and what appeals to them.
It is so amazing that you guys try to push Biden as stupid. Any gaffe he makes, Trump will destroy that same day. Your base may not care, but undecideds aren‚Äôt stupid. They see Biden stutter once, and then Trump do whatever it is he does. Thank you for gift wrapping this election
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty fucked that Biden is trying to appeal to everyone.
This is excellent campaign strategy on your part. Biden should attempt to garner fewer votes than Trump. Allow those who voted for Trump to vote for him again. Maybe encourage more moderate liberals to vote Trump also.   It‚Äôs not because you are a woman. It‚Äôs because this is dumb
Seriously, he should resign immediately.  What an asshole thing to tweet. Virginia mayor urged to resign after allegedly saying Joe Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima' as his VP
Joe Biden calling a black reporter ‚Äúa junkie‚Äù after raising his own junkie for a son (Hunter Biden), is so on brand for Democrats

Don Surber: Biden may have flunked his cognitive test
So the Democrars refuse to work on a practical stimulus bill and Joe Biden is showing off his antique Corvette &amp; saying he can't wait for the Electric Corvette to come out because he heard it can go 200mph.  Go ahead and vote for this moron and watch America die!  #VoteInPerson
What should be concerning to Americans is that the white supremacy groups align with trump. Biden sold his soul to the devil? Really? I say that‚Äôs why trump hasn‚Äôt gotten COVID. He sold his soul many years ago. #TheFive
Don Surber: Biden may have flunked his cognitive test
Don Surber: Biden may have flunked his cognitive test    Biden today said he won't take the cognitive test that screens people for dementia and Alzheimer's.  A month ago he said he was tested constantly. Maybe he forgot.
Why is it ironic that Biden's campaign is starting to model "Weekend at Bernie's?"
Biden doesn't have a brain!
Joe Biden asks Black reporter "Are you a junkie?"  #joebiden
Idk what‚Äôs more depressing, the fact that Biden doesn‚Äôt stand a chance to win this election, or people who are so blind to that possibility.
Russian Collusion was a conspiracy theory your employer promoted  Biden and Rice unmasking political opponents the FBI spied on is a fact
You mean like Bernie and Biden
It was a disaster for  Trump's interview debacle sends a warning for the fall campaign
anyone else need a reason to vote biden this year?  run with this one guys!
Fuck Biden. Real democrats don‚Äôt vote for Republicans
Hillary and Biden supporters in shambles
Now get him to roll and the Biden‚Äôs will be brought to justice.
Biden doesn't have a plan Mr. President. He's already plagiarizing you. Same thing he did in the 80s. He has no damn chance.
Will Biden finish 3rd in WV?
You didn't mention anything Biden accomplished. A lot isn't an answer, its also a lie. ü§£ü§£
You‚Äôre our savior lmao. What would we do if we didn‚Äôt have Joe Biden for the 40 years in politics? How many children would‚Äôve been saved from his grotesque ass? He had the country running so smooth for his 8 years as VP, according to himself. You‚Äôre a joke Joe, please just stopü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
They are scared.  may make some gaffes but nothing compared to lies that  would tell. Right-wing media focuses on 'imaginary controversy' suggesting Biden won't debate Trump
Don Surber: Why Biden's VP pick is delayed    "President Donald John Trump ... is a political wood chipper."
This was like reading a statement from Biden
Joe Biden it will be 7billion people no 29, 30, 4005, 1m , 23,000! Trump would be President indefinitely.
You guys just whine and complain about any person who doesn‚Äôt stand for the exact same things you believe in. then anyone who attempts to understand or work w/you, you shun them. Biden tries to move left ‚Äú oh noes he didn‚Äôt want to raise in the minimum wage in 1973!‚Äù Come on.
Maybe she can do someone...Biden Veep Announcement Pushed Off AGAIN As Allies Wage Campaign Against Kamala Harris, Report
Looks like Alex just made a terrorist threat.  Alex couldn't kill a weak fart a week after a baked bean eating contest.  Biden's DoJ needs to put him away for life!
Don Surber: Why Biden's VP pick is delayed
I would agree with this if the debaters weren‚Äôt Donald Trump and Joe Biden. America needs these debates, they‚Äôre all I‚Äôm looking forward to right now
If Joe Biden REALLLLLLLLLLY wanted my vote, he would back Medicare for All. He want my vote he gonna hafta come get it
Again, not my fault. Voting for the lesser of 2 evils is still voting for evil. All Biden has to do to earn my vote is do Medicare for All. Simple.
Person 1 is serving a shit sandwich. Person 2 is serving a shit sandwich they threw up on. Should you still be happy about getting a shit sandwich because it least it doesn‚Äôt have vomit on it like the other one? That‚Äôs Biden v Trump
8 years of Obama/Biden policy gave us trump. Trump is y‚Äôall‚Äôs fault. Can‚Äôt gimme Medicare for all? Enjoy 4 more years of trump. I do t give my vote away to anyone. You want it? Come get it. Gimme something
But what about Biden‚Äôs victims?
Barack Obama picked Joe Biden as his running mate on Aug. 23.
Tryna pave the way for Biden to go back on his promise of having a woman of color as VP
This would be the only thing that could make me vote for Biden.
A vote for anybody but Biden is a vote for Trump  How selfish
Not subscribing, but you won‚Äôt Biden because of something to do with abortion? Jesus Fucking Christ. The omission of an act is still an act, and not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump. Get over yourself.
Reminding Biden you‚Äôre still out there miss abrams
Dan, the Democrats have had no intention of putting Biden on the final ticket.  They‚Äôve let this situation intensify so the ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù ticket after the convention will be justified, in their minds. It will be Hillary/Kamala . . . .
His team is not. I doubt either Kayne or Trump have a clue they are being played. It won't work and of course Biden has to earn his votes, but it is a ploy.
Hey  Redirecting Police Funds is the same thing as DEFUNDING THE POLICE!  Did you think we the people wouldn't catch that?  Are you brain dead?  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica  Where Does Joe Biden Actually Stand On Defunding The Police?  via
I can dig that. Without republicans Biden and Trump in the mix, who we voting for?
Kanye 100% pulls votes from Biden. And based on current polling, this could be a complete landslide, where even states like West Virginia come close to being in play even if they really aren't.
You‚Äôre obsession about Biden‚Äôs VP pick is concerning
5/ ‚ÄúByrd also supported Anita Hill in her accusations of sexual harassment by Thomas and was joined by 45 other Democrats in voting against Thomas‚Äô confirmation‚Äù (including Biden)
We despise Joe Biden more than any of them. Why would picking a VP who we despise just a little less EVER away us to vote for the piece of shit that is Joe Biden? Your analysis is  fiction! 50 million out of work- but your still employedü§¶
Mr Biden today is Sunday incase noone has told you
I am supporting  for VP as well. I'm ready to call our sister in the movement for justice Madam Vice President Kamala Harris
This is a brilliant idea. Is there any reporting that Biden has made this a demand?
BY RIDIN‚Äô WITH BIDEN!
When the virus experts should have only one motive/agenda and that‚Äôs the safety of the people. That‚Äôs most definitely not the case here. P.S. I‚Äôm def not a Trump supporter (although Biden would be even worse).
No sane person. Will vote for Biden.
You keep those career politicians in office to get rich off your back you nitwit. How any sane human could vote for a democrat is mind blowing. Lady you got serious issues. Biden 50 years. Did zip!!! Now he‚Äôs senile and that‚Äôs what you want. Wow!!!!
Madam you are aware of Just how pitiful that statement is!!! You don‚Äôt want Biden to open his mouth because you are well aware he has zero to say!! His handlers know it... come on. Why in God‚Äôs name would anyone vote Biden.
I don‚Äôt think so. The death and economic chaos wrought by  ‚Äòs continued bungling of the pandemic is a far greater risk than anything Biden might do. 150,000 dead and who knows how many survivors have been crippled. You have to have a life to have a livelihood.
Give it up, Joy.  It ain‚Äôt gonna happen.  Concentrate on getting Biden elected.
BLM is a hoax to fund raise for Act Blue a Democrat pac group that gives the money to Biden &amp; other democrats. That is right on their site you just have look for it.

If you shitlibs really cared that this was a ‚Äúlife or death‚Äù situation, you wouldn‚Äôt have voted down Medicare for All as part of the party platform. Now you‚Äôve guarenteed many will die of COVID under Biden. Democrats- snatching defeat from the jaws of victory since 2000
You seem to forget how we got Donald Trump- it‚Äôs because of 8 yrs of failed neoliberal policies of Obama/Biden. And your solution is to make Biden president?? Your just begging for us to have Tom Cotton as president in 2024 or 2028, a smarter more competent trump. Your sick af!
It‚Äôs cute how your the brainwashed blue maga cultist- telling me im easily swayed by what others say. No sir, that‚Äôs YOU.  Facts: -Biden policies are republican -Biden has 7 sexual assault accusers -Biden backed Fred Upton over a D in 2018 for 250k -Biden lobbied for Iraq War
‚ÄúSoftened‚Äù and ‚Äúpaying attention‚Äù is just like ‚Äúaccess‚Äù...joe Biden has already told his 100 billionaire donors that NOTHING will change under him. I swear to god y‚Äôall shitlibs are just as brainwashed as MAGA. Here‚Äôs a novel concept- DONT VOTE FOR CORRUPT ACTORS!
All the more reason why Biden should choose Rice  Can you imagine what Rice will do after she gets the intelligence reports?
Better yet Why should Biden debate Trump?
Well he was right on the Catholic part, many Catholics, especially in WV find Joe Biden to be a disagrace to the teachings of the church.
Democrats- give in to the minority if they rich and white but if they black or poor, nothing will fundamentally change as the fake democrat right winger Biden claimed
Moving in that direction? Lmao it‚Äôs not because of biden. It‚Äôs because of progressives. But Republican Biden has already stated to his billionaire donors that nothing will change for them- and that includes big pharma and insurance companies.
As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals. Who do you think he will pick?
Kamala Harris never met a billionaire she wouldn‚Äôt dance for. Biden taught her wellü§£. Some of the worst takes on the internet come from this twitter account lmao
Biden, as well as trump, look out for the welfare queens that give them money- corporations and billionaires. Fuckem both

Ah I see your logic...when it‚Äôs a  fascist republican doin it, it‚Äôs creepy...but when a republican posing as a democrat (Biden) does it, it‚Äôs acceptable. Magas = Biden bro‚Äôs
January 20, 12 noon, Joe Biden sworn in as #46.  January 21, Stephen Miller is on a military plane to Gitmo.  Hope he doesn't have an aversion to water poured on his face.........
Just might be the perfect storm for that, so long as no one gets complacent just because "the polls show Biden winning." No repeats of Clinton + Trump doing what Trump does, and we very well could see both houses in the blue...
We really aren't safe in Donald Trump's America. I'm willing to try Joe Biden's America out for a bit.
Tired: allow Biden to choose a VP with the most progressive policy alignments that actually has a chance (Kamala Harris)  Wired: try to tear down said candidate and end up with someone as VP that will literally leave hardcore leftists in tears (Susan Rice)
Biden says anarchists should be prosecuted. You want me to fucking vote for that?
The fuck does Biden have to do with this? Obsessed much?
Joe Biden would never be better, he does not have a complete thought or a complete sentence, I can not wait until they debate
At the  convention  endorsed Biden. ‚ÄúI am voting for Joe because our democracy is at stake, &amp; I think we have had four years of the perils of someone with no experience at the wheel, and we‚Äôve ‚Ä¶It‚Äôs so much worse than everyone feared."
Chances are he has.  is a traitor to his country. Devin Nunes declines to say whether he received foreign information meant to damage Biden
150k dead Americans, economy in complete shambles, opponent he has no idea how to attack and that is fairly popular? I still like Biden‚Äôs chances üòÜ
A vote for Biden, is a vote against Christ. Trump isn‚Äôt perfect but at least he isn‚Äôt bullying Catholics 24/7 like Biden is. The worse part is Biden is Catholic. #Trump2020
I literally was shopping for the settle for Biden t shirt today lol
And just because I‚Äôm pointing out folks on the right crying about everything does not mean I was an Obama fan, or even a Biden fan.  Too quick to label and choose sides.  There is no escaping the the fact that Trump is a clown who is doing nothing except worrying about his image
Biden is so untrustworthy the Democrats wouldn't even let him attend John Lewis' funeral for fear he'd say something stupid! That's how BAD a candidate he is!  #VoteDemsOut  #VoteRedOrAmericaIsDead

Eh, I‚Äôm black and when I saw Biden say that back then, at no point did I think mitt Romney was going to be enslaving me. And I don‚Äôt think any other black people did either.
Yeah, Biden‚Äôs a gaffe machine. Although, back then Romney was leaning heavy into the white identity politics. Not to donald trump levels, but he was. But at this point we all know that isn‚Äôt really him. It‚Äôs why he‚Äôs not really popular amongst the Republican base.

I would literally vote for a middle eastern porta shitter before I voted for joe Biden.
Bernie lost. Fair and square. You aren‚Äôt doing the movement any favors by feeding your audience conspiratorial bullshit. Biden was winning by over 2 MILLION VOTES by the time Bernie was winding down his campaign.
Dudes still wanna vote for Ye. Biden wasn't wrong.
Jealous that Biden is winning?
Joe Biden aint doing ahit for America
Even counting mail in votes, Biden will lose.   Why does everyone think he'll win? Fuck the polls (not reliable and biased for over a decade now), pay attention to what ppl are actually saying. Biden doesn't have enough support.   #NeverBidenNeverTrump  #EvictCongress
Now that media is disparaging individuals they ignored. I‚Äôm not sure Biden can beat Trump for this very reason. There are people who felt ignored for years and are now feeling like a President cares about them so they‚Äôll vote for him regardless of what he does.
Biden and Kammy did
Haha Tammy Bruce...Biden pushing masks, idk til when...November 4th
I‚Äôm so sick of people saying this. You do realize the Democrats created the kkk and Biden in the biggest perv on earth and don‚Äôt get the started on the clintons. You need to do some research my dear. You making very uneducated statements.
You just made derogatory comments about a woman who named as the VP by Mr. Biden!! You're POS!!
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
idk i 100% get that there are many people--undocumented immigrants and their loved ones for example--who have no reason to hope this will be better for them and that's real and despicable. but we can organize against *that* under biden instead of begging to be allowed to vote lol
the biden/harris ticket is about keeping everyone who voted reluctantly against hillary the first time to stay home because these dems aren't as scary. they dont give a fuck about leftists but we still need them to do anything other than get snatched by feds for the next 4 years
honestly at this point i would be happy with a biden presidency that leads to literally anything positive actually getting done even if it's small. like do y'all remember what a functioning federal govt looks like?? cuz thanks to mitch mcconnell i literally don't
I‚Äôm voting for Biden/ Harris and I‚Äôm so excited - I wish the election was today !
One thing about Biden that owns is him declining to be on Jon Save America
"they should reevaluate the importance they place on superficial factors. what you want from an analyst is accuracy and understanding, not some hot take about how a backbench congressman reminds them of a young Jack Kennedy."
I've seen so many people in my little corner of Ohio (mostly centrists, moderate Republicans, and pretty much every riding with Biden Dem) have been calling for DeWine 2024  Certainly not an opinion I hold but looking at the other possible Republicans running, I hope he runs.
Just imagine being on the Biden secret service detail , he swims in his pool nude, they had to remove female staff !
Biden has no idea what‚Äôs even going on in the world today, his mind is stuck in his kkk past ! He believes he is better than you and us and that‚Äôs the definition of a racist !
Not jealous are we? Biden-Harris are winners.
How can Joe Biden be ahead on a fox polls on the coronavirus?  He‚Äôs done nothing, at all!
We should have bets on how many times Biden will garble it a day.  (If the #FakeNewsMedia shows it.) #VoteRedToSaveAmerica

YES Biden and Harris are not great at all but they are ABSOLUTELY better than the assholes in the white house now and they only way to remove those assholes now is to replace them
If you‚Äôre able to vote but deliberately sit this election out because you don‚Äôt personally like Biden and Kamala instead of voting for them to get trump out of office you‚Äôre dead to me js
Voting for anyone but Biden/Harris is unequivocally a vote for Trump/Pence.   That said, trump is going to win and cripple democracy and once that happens shits going to get super sideways.   The pendulum always swings back harder.
Biden should‚Äôve stocked up for hunter before he breeds again
What a fuck show. I can‚Äôt wait until all this is over. If it‚Äôs ever over. I feel like if either side wins just gonna be pissing and moaning for 4 more years. Ps I hate all 4 we have to choose from. I‚Äôm only voting Biden to see if anything goes back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù
Biden and Harris CANNOT beat Trump in a fair and square election....I am just gonna depend on God to sort it out......none of them neither D or R can ruin what God ordains.....but I can laugh at them as they try.....
I love how Biden made the CJ system worse with the Crime Bill. Fuck criminals.  I love how he has no sympathy for young people. Fuck young people.  I love how he'll make sure NOTHING fundamentally changes and corporations keep fucking people. Fuck people.

She's only paying lip service in an attempt to sway progressives.   However, she's full of shit. Like Biden, there is absolutely NO WAY she'd actually do it. Look at her past actions, listen to what she's said before...now she's suddenly changes her tune? Bullshit.
Really? The Biden campaign needs to demand that Cheeto provide his tax returns, ALL of them.
She doesn't actually bring in ANY new voter support for Biden. Biden's base was already clamoring for Harris...no one outside of his base gives a shit about Harris.
She is NOT left of Biden. They are the same.
And really theoretically at this point, come on bet on yourself take a chance, Democrats are going to have unified control of the Democrats. Part of Joe Biden's plan is to help update homes for energy efficiency. Buy the house now and Democrats help ya upgrade it next year.

It‚Äôs also funny that when Biden chose his vp every completely forgot how Congress and the senate screwed over the American people I‚Äôm happy about the pick but news should be holding them accountable until they get something done
The only VP candidate I was even remotely "excited" about was Stacy Abrams. I'm still not "excited" about any Biden ticket. However, Biden could have picked Bobo The Clown as his VP and I would happily vote for him. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

As a registered Republican, I genuinely am pleased with Biden‚Äôs pick. Kamala is rocksolid, smart, and tenacious. I am certainly not 100% aligned to that ticket, but it sure is hell beats another four years of Trump.
Joe Biden Picks #KamalaHarris As His Running Mate
Kamala Harris is going to jump turnout substantially in Indianapolis and so when Biden did the perfect answer of picking Harris - Biden ensured that the #bidenharris2020 ticket will win in Indiana also.
Listen... I was down with ya until you made that statement about Biden... Shame.
I said Biden/Harris is the worst presidential ticket ever.. but really anybody Biden chose would have still made it the worst ever.  Biden is the worst presidential candidate I‚Äôve seen so far as an American voter.
If for some reason   is the reason you won't vote for Biden - #WTF is wrong with you?  Like, if you were not going to vote for #Trump before - but Harris is your issue does that mean you prefer Trump to Harris?  Pence to Harris?  Like, What? ü§Ø #Vote2020

I think the Democratic ticket of Biden/Harris would look a lot better flipped around to Harris/Biden  but I'm still going to vote for you.  Hell, I'd vote for  over #CadetBoneSpurs
Biden and Harris both support taxpayer-funded abortion. I don't care if you hate Trump, are a life-long Democrat, pro-union, whatever - IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A CHRISTIAN, YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR THIS TICKET!
Because of Mitch McConnell's dilly dallying Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States. The last victim of the Grim Reaper from Kentucky could well be Donald Trump himself. McConnell must pay the ultimate price &amp; have his legacy destroyed as a back stabber known.
I'll back Biden as democratic candidate, but if I had my choice, Kamala Harris would have been at the top of the ticket, not VP. She could tear Cheeto AND Pence apart in a debate without breaking a sweat.
"BUT TRUMP" is a bullshit argument, and a sad one.  We need to stand for our principles NOW. Voting for either only shows it's ok for them to shaft us more.  Biden is JUST as corrupt and atrocious as Trump. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
I do own my choices, since you don't seem to pay attention.  You Biden supporters are simply caustic bastards who apparently can't understand we are sick of the corruption from Dems and Repubs and refuse to support them.   I'm sure when Biden loses you'll blame progressives again
But see, I personally don't agree with you on Trump, but I don't disagree with you on Biden. I know we have to have 1 or the other, but as an independent, I can't fully support either.   As for you personally, you're one I can disagree with, but turn around and have a beer with.
Like typically you want a VP from a swing state, who isn't expected, who pulls a demographic you struggle with. Kamala doesn't do that for Biden.
She's kinda disliked by the left and right and only speaks to a specific breed of libs that Biden already secured the vote of. I just don't think it was a strategic move Biden will gain anything from, not that he will lose much.
Y‚Äôall... I‚Äôm legitimately afraid that tr*mp is going to win this election like people are going to refuse to vote for Biden esp now that he‚Äôs chosen Kamala because of the shitty things they‚Äôve both done but trump supporters actually will vote enough for him to win
They won't even have to bother. The Attorney General of New York will have dismantled your NRA thugs before Biden and Harris have a chance.  No one wants to disband the NRA we just want it to be the sportsman's charity it was designed to be.
Biden has owned this news cycle.
Uncle Joe shouldn't debate Trump either. Trump is comfortable in front of a mic. Joe is prone to stick his foot in his mouth. We, progressives, can't have that. There is no advantage to Biden debating Trump. #TrumpIsALoser
When Biden and Harris are far left and Kyle is a liberal   Republican logic is fun
Ordered my Biden/Harris swag today. We need some Doug and Jill swag too! And stickers of your pets - that‚Äôs not a weird request, right? ü§£
So wait, they are both saying Joe Biden is a Trojan Horse for Leftists while touting how Leftists think he and Harris are too centrist?  What kind of messaging is this?
Since Biden said that anarchists should be imprisoned I'm honestly disappointed I haven't seen any Tankies4Biden yet....
When will you? Everybody wants to talk about Biden being in cognitive decline when Trump is talking about curing COVID-19 with Lysol or UV light. Claiming the WW2 ended in 2017 because of a flu. Imagine if Biden said these things.
how are you calling Joe Biden racist with Trump has done nothing but make racist comments throughout his career and you call Biden a liar when Trump is the liar in chief. 22k + documented. I can produce receipts. ‚ÄúLook at my African-American!‚Äú How bout the CP5 Leo?
Today is a good day for our nation.  Biden/Harris will spend years fixing the problems from the tRump era.  But we will have their back.  AMERICA  STRONG and moving forward once again.!
It‚Äôs a binary choice. Trump or Biden. It goes far beyond the ACA. We cannot take another Kavanagh or Alito on SCOTUS. Recognizing climate change. Not calling BLM terrorists. Combating C19. Roe. Not isolating allies &amp; befriending dictators. All major issues Biden is better on.
Neither of them is my first choice, but I‚Äôm fairly content with small change at then national level. If you can‚Äôt see that the Biden ticket is an improvement from the Trump ticket, we aren‚Äôt seeing the same things. Vote in more progressive candidates on the local &amp; state levels
I‚Äôd rather have Biden/Harris in office than Trump/Pence. I still want to defund the police. I‚Äôd also like to not wake up every day afraid that our planet will suddenly collapse &amp; someone will say ‚Äúhaha gotcha!‚Äù bc I‚Äôve been in hell along which is what Trump presidency feels like
Is that you? üëÜüëÜüëÜ  The snark is just perfect. The fact that you are sitting on the sidelines yet cannot help throwing shade at the Dems because they don‚Äôt fit your ideological purity test sad. Remember Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden. üñïüèºüñïüèº
I don‚Äôt like Kamala but she‚Äôs better than Pence just like how I‚Äôm not too keen on Biden but he‚Äôs better than Trump
So Fake President blows up and is a little bitch over the fact Kamala Harris was made Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate.  Really ?  You don‚Äôt even have the Republicans supporting your Nazi Ass any more.
History does repeat itself, unfortunately, and people never learn from it.  The polls have been untrustworthy for a long time...Biden will not win this election, and the Dems will scream out progressives are to blame...again.   #NeverBidenNeverTrump
She's just another corp politician just like Biden. A sellout to corporate interests and only interested in their pocketbooks and hers.   Once again, the Dem party has made an egregious mistake and will lose the election.   #NeverBidenNeverTrump
I can't see Biden winning, anyway. He simply doesn't have the support and the "polls" have been eschewed as fuck for a long time, now.
The idea of 4 more years of Trump is atrocious, but the thought of Biden is equally shitty.  No unfollowing from me, my friend. Some of us actually don't react like a dickhead...lol  #NeverBidenNeverTrump  #NoComradesUnder1k
One thing about Biden, he won‚Äôt remember what Kamala said to him or about him
The fact you said "over Trump"  means you aren't actually talking about progress. Trump has to go. We all agree, that doesn't mean whatever Biden drags in is good lmao.
Kamala Harris, Biden's V.P. Pick, Is First Woman of Color on Major Party Ticket   Nice! Excellent choice!
People would have been saying the exact same thing about a very centrist Gov. Ralph Northam of VA at one time. His platform was much more milquetoast than Biden‚Äôs. However, with a liberal state house and senate, Northam has made VA one of the most liberal states in the union.
You know nothing of my socioeconomic status or the privilege I have. But if you are the type to stay home and not vote for Joe Biden because you are bitter that he‚Äôs not as liberal as you want, that is a privileged position. If he‚Äôs good enough for Bernie he‚Äôs good enough for me.
And hopefully we get a lot more social justice-esque progressives unseating these relics of the house and senate and they can‚Äôt put pressure on Biden (should he win) to move on the issue.
Oh, I 100 agree with you. We do need universal healthcare. It‚Äôs embarrassing that we don‚Äôt have it. But the ACA is a remarkable upgrade to the system we had before dealing with insurance companies alone. We have a better chance of getting there with Biden/Harris than Trump.
He's so jealous of Kamala n Biden!! #BlueWavesaComing
That‚Äôs not to say that we cannot build up on it. But you are much more likely to build upon the ACA with Joe Biden and a Democratic House and Senate with a progressive supreme court justice then you are with Trump‚Äôs FU Policy.
That is to say nothing of putting Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court and will be preparing to put more Kavanaughs on it. He has thrown napalm on the USPS. Voters have been disenfranchised. Biden wasn‚Äôt even in my top 10, but him and Trump are apples to hand grenades.
Yes I can.  Biden is part of the problem. We need to #DrawTheLine and stand for our principles.   #IWillNotFallInLine #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Me sitting in my car listening to lofi hip hop beats and tweeting about American politics with a half eaten Marcos pizza in my passenger seat:  fuck Biden
i like Kamala fine but my biggest fear is that this will BOTH 1) alienate a block of energized voters (blm protesters) AND 2) make voting FOR biden against Trump less paletable to the center-right (bc of her more explicit progressive policy platform and racism and misogyny)
Start dropping hints of major corruption scandal against Biden..then tweet about the coming announcement every day till election day
I‚Äôll believe it when I see it.  I‚Äôm not saying Biden won‚Äôt win, but I felt better about Clinton this time four years ago.  I‚Äôm still not entirely sure polls factor in people who usually never vote but voted for Trump in 2016
If you say defund the police and ACAB and then turn right around and vote for Biden/Harris you‚Äôre a joke. This whole election is a joke. The only way out of this is
"I've decided that Kamala Harris is the best person to help me take this fight to Donald Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021.‚Äù -Joe Biden   Kamala Harris is smart, capable and‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm actually thankful how many deep sighs the Biden campaign makes us have because it makes us mindful of our breathing and that‚Äôs healthy?
Biden choosing Kamala is dirt in the grave of legalized weed
I'll give Biden this, Kamala was probably a better choice than John Delaney!   Half of you might not know who that is üòâ
Wth? Biden who is clearly racist. Just listen to what he's said.. picks Harris as his VP! Playing the race card for black votes. What I can't understand is why it doesn't infuriate the black community? A white man using a black woman to advance hisself?
What the hell?? We have Biden who is clearly racist. Just listen to what he's said. He picks Harris as his VP! Playing the race card for black votes. What I can't understand is why it doesn't infuriate the black community? A white man using a black woman to get what he wants?

Under the Kamala-Biden regime there will be 3 types of prisons, those dedicated to criminals, those dedicated to blacks, and those dedicated to anarchists. Don't like it, leave.

If Biden didn‚Äôt pick Harris I would have been concerned, logical choice
I am gonna get a shirt too I am so much more excited about Joe Biden now. I just LOVE Kamala Harris so much!!!!!!! Cheers! BYE CON DON!
Biden/Harris may be the worst presidential ticket of all time. üòÇ
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! i just screamed joe biden picked kamala harris!!!!!!!!!!!!! yay!!!! i love you kamala harris! &lt;3
Joe Biden chooses the woman who wiped the floor with him during the debates!
Biden/Harris for the win! Kamala Harris will mop the floor with Trump and Pence. #VPPick
breaking: sofia the first chosen as biden's vp pick. the ruling class sticking together even further.
I hope it's Harris for Biden's VP.
What a idiot worst president in history well maybe he would if he cheated him like he is trying to do with Biden
Same here. I liked Tammy for multiple reasons.   1. She‚Äôs young and if Biden is planning to be ‚ÄúThe Bridge‚Äú she would be perfect.  2. She‚Äôs got an unbelievable story that would resonate w/ which she represents.    3. Military. The contrast. She lost limbs serving. Trump dodged x5
oh his slide will start back up they just had a big infection party in my region.  i watch them ambulances drive by every night. i say byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
‚ÄúThe only way to prevent this scenario, is to deliver an election night lead to Biden. This means voting in person. No, not everyone will be able to do that. But if you plan to vote against Trump and can take appropriate precautions,
i just read on politicalwire they might ask if you can if you're brave if you believe it necessary to get in line to vote and not do mail in. to make sure biden wins on election night. i'm gonna do it. i hate the idea of getting the vid or possibly spreading it to someone myself.
I will be glad about whoever Biden picks at the nominee. I read a really articulate article as to why maybe Kamala Harris wouldn't want to be vice president. I just couldn't stand people attacking her, I support whoever it is, but seriously don't continue to be mean to Kamala.
Hmm China would prefer Joe Biden....of course they do!
Electing Biden only strengthens the corruption.
If Biden is a true, practicing Catholic, he must go to confession every few hours for promotion of abortion, lying, stealing, cheating, plagiarism, and so on and so forth. #whatacrock #BidenDementia
You did a fantastic job. I'm so sorry you and your husband and family are going through this. Just saw a Biden ad on Fox where a woman blamed President Trump for the loss of her family member.  Made me mad. You didn't place blame. You just want to be counted.
Mayor Pete would make an excellent chief of staff. Biden could take him under his wing.
And now listen to any sentence that Joe Biden has said recently and tell me how you think he could possibly debate Trump. The left really has no grasp on reality whatsoever.
Potus is a rock star, he comes right back out and gets the job done....could you imagine Biden, he would be whining in the corner.....wondering why he was being punished lol

i'll just let it be known in 2024 if kamala harris decided to primary joe biden i would support that. it would be so amazing and good for the world to have kamala harris in the white house. i believe india would be more receptive to a united states led by kamala harris.
i thought about that as well. biden may not pick kamala harris and maybe that's for the better anyways. being a senator puts her before an international audience. i may have switched back to the future is better off with kamala harris as america's senator.

Needs to work on its power scaling.  One minute Biden is weak and fragile then suddenly he‚Äôs challenging God.  Totally unbelievable.
New York (CNN)A bug in Instagram's algorithm systemically shielded Donald Trump from negative hashtags without doing the same for rival Joe Biden, the company confirmed.  ik it's true because in 2015 and 2016 i was prohibited from sending messages to friends/family on fb myself.
i still can't post on instagram &amp; facebook is just as bad.  think of all the family's who used the im service as a way of communicating. couple years it could stop even messaging each other. people would have died from this. it's very serious. diabetics
‚ÄúSleepy Joe Biden is in his basement to hide how frail and weak he is. He‚Äôs afraid to debate me because of his cognitive decline.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAlso Joe Biden will personally kill God in hand-to-hand combat.‚Äù
Kamala Harris support, encouragement, and push for a Biden presidency leads me to vote for Biden.

This is in response to two recent letters to the editor in your paper. Apparently some people are still suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome or they are uninformed, misinformed or ignorant.
Look I don't like Trump but this man Biden don't even know what planet he's on
It‚Äôs good to know that Biden is in the hands of Wall Street. A moment of truth for the
So many rumors going around so many people in my town are being targeted by them Russian robots that I heard Joe Biden talking about. Spreading rumors and lies. It's just a bunch of imbred hick cousin fkrs.
I keep telling people that Owensby is gonna win as well between Yarmuth, Amy, Biden, Hicks and possibly even Swearengin in West Virginia that's a lot of good association. I honestly can not believe how Democrat it has become.  Which, it's hard and everything when they cut and cut
What do you propose once your in office? How will four years of Joe Biden bring us back from the brink? What are your big ideas?
6 years ago  Only if Biden had the opportunity to do anythi... oh wait
Well yeah they're pro-Biden right now though. They're supporting Biden and the Dems still don't see it as enough. I'm essentially saying the DNC is not giving a pass to a group just because they don't follow Liberal Orthodoxy
Eh I mean it wasn't really the network but plenty of people there were pro Biden. I don't watch much but the Twitter discourse is pretty pro Biden.   I just think it's fishy that a network that seemed at least mildly sympathetic to Biden is banned. Very fishy.
Wow. After all the Biden simping they still got denied. Rip.
Must be a Joe Biden Rally
this imbecile is saying Democrats are cheating,that the election can't be trusted, that Biden HATES god! Really! it's incredible.I'm not even interested in politics, only since traitor Trump got elected&amp;I can tell you what's going to happen!Racist can't have a leading party!
Isn't Biden too old to be a coach?
I agree Trump is trying to prevent our votes, I will crawl through a moat  of crocodiles, filled with broken glass,amidst swarming rabid bats to vote for Biden.
Joe Biden is a racist? Ok üëå Fucking unbelievable how you can get in slow this man‚Äôs heart and tell people what he believes. Reps. James Clyburn endorsed him over everyone else as did John Lewis who known him for 40 years, but they are too slow to notice his racism. GTFO.
Trump is a horrible human that only cares about himself and his salesman DNA makes you believe he's in it for you. Biden is way over the hill.
Trump is literally just throwing every key word he can think of our there in an attempt to attack Biden.  Trump is so dumb and, yet, his worshippers manage to be even dumber.  Fuck us, #amiright?
Trump stands on national TV and says Biden hates God! What kind of crap is that! Trump is making it really easy to vote and support Biden as a republican!
Is it a surprise that China (people of color) favors Biden and Russia (predominantly White) favors Trump? Their preferences merely align with the racial preferences of Americans.

diminish joe biden? why i mean he's kind of dumb. he don't have that big of a personality cult. billionaires don't like him. minority voters don't like him. working class people don't like him. republicans like joe biden though.
gay guys don't like biden. indians don't like biden. seeing biden have to apologize to black community over insensitive comments. hispanics don't like biden. not being trump is his only advantage. i hate you south carolina.
In fact, HRC lost MI, WI, &amp; PA with a combined 0.76% total vote. Trump literally squeak out the window. And HRC was just so toxic. The election is up in the air, but Trump has an uphill battle. Biden is live in AZ, FL, GA, IO, NC &amp; SC. Hell, Trump has had to put money in TX!
I‚Äôm old enough to have voted since ‚Äò00. The ‚Äô16 polls were right though. No polls said landslide. All were within MoE. National polls had HRC winning &amp; she indeed won the popular x 3M votes. She lost MI x 3k votes and didn‚Äôt even campaign there. Biden isn‚Äôt making that error.
Personally I would rather a nuclear war happen under a President Trump than a President Biden.  I'm really thinking about this. Ultimately maybe I do hope I vote for the loser.
Joe Biden is a racist misogynist old man and I'm ashamed of the Democratic Party picking him but I'm like everyone else and I live in an imperfect world and I'll vote for the old fuck ders myself.
If I were Joe Biden my number want in a vice president would be a person who would be able to ease nuclear nation relations. That is not Karen Bass. That is not Tammy Duckworth (honey I love you to the sun and back you will be president one day). Only Kamala Harris can ease this.
Karen Bass is not a unity pick.  I'm sorry she's not. The world is in complete disarray. I will vote for Biden/Bass if that's what it is. Kamala Harris is a world unity candidate. Ya'll dumb and if it was to me I'd challenge you in your precinct and you'd lose that party position
The governor's of each state are the ones keeping things shut down. If you would like trump to call an executive order to open all great! ...but then you will just complain he overstepped... So what exactly will you do different Biden??

Joe Biden did say some stupid shit. But that is Biden. He‚Äôs a fucking gaffe machine. I don‚Äôt believe it makes him racist though. Over 40 years he‚Äôs worked across the aisle with POC and the African-American caucus. Received their endorsement &amp; won the primary based on black votes.
Come on bro! This is not the war you want to fight with Donald Trump on the other side. Biden made a gaffe and immediately apologized. Trump on the other hand has trafficked in racism For decades. He was the original ‚Äúbirther‚Äú in chief. Hounding Obama for not being born here.
I actually agree with you, That is what the electoral college is for, and I‚Äôm a Biden voter in Kentucky. There‚Äôs no need to eliminate it. But absentee / mail-in voting, early voting and same-day registration need to be the law of the land, too many people disenfranchised in M/A
And polls are going his way. He's either ahead or tied with Biden in the battleground states.
sounds good to me. now chyyyyna, bidens friends, might prove him wrong and not do it. thats not Trumps fault. just another reason Trump is kicking chyyyna, bidens friends in the balls instead of licking them like biden does
Joe Biden made some very inappropriate and racist comments. His apology isn‚Äôt an apology but an attempt to say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what I meant‚Äù when he clearly said what he denies saying. Joe Biden and Donald Trump. These are the people we have to choose from.
Well let's see if Joe Biden would have been president he would have let all Chinese come into the United States! Instead of shutting the border like Trump did! So I would say right now we would probably have about 2 million dead! Thank God for Trump!

The idea that the DNC will capitulate to the left if we pledge them our votes but will move right if we don‚Äôt vote is the most bassackwards reasoning I‚Äôve ever heard. Biden is not a leftwing candidate, we know what his policies are, if neoliberalism is shown to be a winning...

This is what Vote Blue No Matter Who gets ya....if Biden wins, his incrementaism will give us Tom Cotton in 2024
He has to go. One more reason to vote for Biden
I honestly can't imagine anyone being as bad as Trump. Biden's campaign has also been shifting left little by little, when historically dem campaigns tend to drift toward the center. I think he sees an opportunity to make some bold policy on climate, healthcare, etc.
Joe Biden is a hardcore republican while Harris is center-right Republican.  No progressive agenda coming out of this admin and that‚Äôs straight from Biden‚Äôs mouth ‚Äúthings won‚Äôt fundamentally change‚Äù he told his 100 billionaire donors
Pushing Biden/Harris means progressives get shit on for 8 More years. Nah, I‚Äôd rather see the party burnt to the ground. Losing 1000 seats under Obama shoulda done away with liberalism
Simple as this...my life is no better nor no worse under Trump than it was under Obama. Obama/Biden 8 years of failed neoliberalism created the conditions that made Donald Trump possible. If Obama‚Äôs 8 years were so great, we wouldn‚Äôt have trump. Going back to Biden is doom
It helps me...the Democratic Party can‚Äôt be reformed. 2-3 progressive wins every cycle, we mite get there by 3000...many of us don‚Äôt have time to wait...we been trying y‚Äôalls way for like 30 yrs and look where that‚Äôs got us. Only hope is Biden drops dead before November
Just think, this could be ANYBODY, this could be Nanshee, could be Chuck the Shmuck, Nappy Nadler or Shifty Shiff....hell it could even be Biden.
Trump burns everything down then takes credit when someone else uses the firehose to put the fire out. When Biden is president he will Tweet daily how great he is that the economy is working for the middle class again.

No false claims from Biden /Harris press conference?
He is a habitual liar! Fact Check: At briefings, Trump is settling into a routine of false claims and exaggeration
This crazy chick just threatened former Vice President Joe Biden.
Oh puhleaseü§£  If your so concerned about corruption, you wouldn‚Äôt be shilling for Biden/Harris- both of whom built their careers by playing ball and taking bribes. You libs are fucking worse than conservatives. Act like your all moral and righteous when your exactly  same
It‚Äôs a race to see who can cut it faster- Republican Trump or Republican Biden. Hope they both 6 ft under before November
Imagine what wearing a mask and social distancing can do! We did not learn that from anybody at the White House. Biden/Harris have already made you look like fools
Hey Biden this is a lie!  this needs fact checked and marked "political misinformation" per your own rules. For once can you do the right thing?  #FactCheckBiden
I hope that‚Äôs her reaction cuz if she uses those 60 seconds to simp for Joe Biden, I‚Äôm gonna lose my fucking mind
If she uses those 60 seconds to kiss Joe Biden‚Äôs ass, I‚Äôm done.
Black Lives Matter activist  must be a 1 percenter because he said he was 99% sure he would NEVER vote for Joe Biden OR Kamala Harris.   Hypocrisy is on full display!  #Blexit #WalkAway #LRA #Lexit #VoteDemsOut
‚ÄúThe press must look past the campaign coverage that was and embrace its role as a safeguard of democracy.‚Äù  Yes. A thousand times yes.
I feel like this needs to be said: You can still be ACAB and pro-defunding the police and support the Biden/Harris ticket. Is it ideal? No. Is it better than Trump? Exponentially.
What do you have to say to Tara Reade, Kamala? You said you believed her, you believed her story that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her. What changed? Is the possibility of power more important to you than the word of victims of sexual assault?  #WalkAway
If Biden gets elected I‚Äôll bet you $1.00 that the Dems will at some point during his term say Biden is not mentally fit to be president and Harris becomes the first female president in history. This has to be their play,right?
Will you apologize to joe Biden for pushing the phony rape smear you and other dumdumleftists like the guy you quote tweeted pushed?
‚ÄòShe‚Äôs up to the task‚Äô: Democrats excited about Kamala Harris joining Joe Biden on 2020 ticket

It was a debut of the duo Democrats believe can win back the White House ‚Äî and they think Sen. Kamala Harris gives Joe Biden just what he needs to ensure that.
Joe Biden is pulling the reverse Obama with Kamala. Obama picked Biden as VP to get the white racists on board. Now the white racist wants that favor returned by picking a black woman because, in Joe‚Äôs mind, all blacks will vote for a black woman on ticket. It‚Äôs tokenism
I‚Äôve got friends mad at my anti-Biden stance. To them I say that I‚Äôm pulling for Paula Jean Swearengin to take the WV Senate race and have a monthly donation set up with her campaign, and you should too.
Good luck to you Biden people. I hope the strategy of wooing suburban republicans works out, I really do.  I‚Äôd like to say I‚Äôm going to get blitzed every night for the next four years, but I‚Äôm losing my health insurance in two months, and your boy doesn‚Äôt give a fuck.
All I‚Äôm saying is that it‚Äôs hypocritical to vote for Biden if you have an issue with sexual predators being elected into office
Ummm you and Ryan grim are absolutely shameless. Both of you pushed the Biden smear. Disgusting and embarrassing.

I‚Äôm joining the Biden campaign Thursday night at 7 p.m. to learn how to make calls into battleground states. Someone join me!
Kamala Harris was on record last year saying she believed all of Biden‚Äôs victims. Politics are crooked
Joe Biden said he would defund the police. We can start there.

It‚Äôs Biden-Harris Day.  ‚ÄúThis is a moment to celebrate. It‚Äôs a moment for young women and young men to be able to see that any door is open to them. And I want to congratulate Senator Harris and VP Biden for this historic choice.‚Äù  eloquent thoughts on
was the best choice. Here's why Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his VP
can handle it! Kamala Harris' balancing act
I cannot help but see my immigrant parents' faces and the world they created for me in America out of nothing.  Grateful to them.  Grateful to Joe Biden for his choice.  After almost 4 years of shameful policies and ugly rhetoric about immigrants, I feel more hopeful today.  2/2
Chomsky‚Äôs take on voting for Joe Biden is exactly right. But let‚Äôs not kid ourselves, a Biden-Harris admin will do everything it can to placate and snuff out the activist energy that keeps primarying their friends. Must stay vigilant
Wut? Cenk you know better than this. Just because the voters wanted Biden doesn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt want Kamala as VP.
That‚Äôs part of it. But if we‚Äôre being totally honest, it‚Äôs because Bernie‚Äôs team was so unbelievably incompetent. He raises sooooo much money and still got that ass whooped. Biden‚Äôs team were supergeniuses compared to Bernies lol
God I hope someone puts these "donations" (from him &amp; Ivanka) to Harris AND Biden in tv/media ads ASAP. It's one thing to have "given" to a former GOP candidate. But to have "given" to THE TWO you're now running opposite against - just PRICELESS!lol!
That kind of idiocy is what Trump takes advantage of by screaming that Biden is going to take God and religion away.
They're not even hiding it folks. The Radical DNC has no intention of letting him stay in office should he win. I said it earlier &amp; I'll say it again, they didn't pick Biden because he's the best they picked him because he's the weakest &amp; easiest to replace! #VoteDemsOut
So you finally admit that Biden is not fit for the job and Harris who polled at 2% wasn‚Äôt wanted for the job so democrats and #FakeNews are trying to install her as President!
If Biden/Harris is the best we can come up with to oppose Trump, we fucking deserve Donald Trump

When they stack the deck, one way to send a message is not to vote for their shit candidates. Look who they‚Äôve run ‚Äî Gore, Kerry, Hillary, Biden
When Joe Biden is asked why he chose Kamala Harris I bet his answer will be because Kamala is appealing to the Latino &amp; Indigenous voters in America. You know because she's part Jamaican &amp; Indian.  I'm telling you he has NO CLUE!  #BidenHarrisDisaster
Anyone want to bet that Joe Biden probably thought he was helping himself with the Latino vote because she's part Jamaican ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and Indigenous people because she part Indian üôÑ

Voting green. I will disparage Biden and Harris because they are just as detrimental to the working class, for which I am a part of, as Trump is. (See greatest transfer of wealth from bottom to the top under Biden/Obama)
I was going to write in Bernie Sanders in November, but his shilling for billionaire bought Biden/Kamala has pushed me away. I will absolutely 100% be voting for Howie Hawkins  because he‚Äôs never raped and offers medicate for all + green new deal. Eat my ass democrats
Because Biden has a stutter and t-Rump is stoopid?
I agree. I‚Äôm saying between trump and Biden, I legit believe with Trump we‚Äôre gonna be dealing with this shit another two years.
*sigh* Obama built the cages, and Biden has spent his career trying to gut social security. Also let‚Äôs not pretend that Biden doesn‚Äôt say something racist every other interview.
Because they went to joe Biden to beat trump, that‚Äôs obvious. As for your latter question, ask me in 4 years. After AOC has more experience and I‚Äôve seen how Kamala runs the country from behind the scenes.
Kamala Harris is now conveniently embracing the #YouAintBlack &amp; #YouAintDiverse Joe Biden but those of us with our own brains remember when she tore him up for all the "Racist Policies" he helped create over his 47 year political Career.  #PhonyKamala
They‚Äôre not in the majority. Maybe in the party apparatus they are, but not the average voter. Most voters voted for Biden because he is a great matchup for Trump. And it‚Äôs my guess black voters knew he‚Äôd pick Kamala Harris.
Karen Bass wasn‚Äôt vetted as well. And as I‚Äôve posited from even several months ago...it was always gonna be Kamala, from the moment she dropped out. (Although I was one of few who already knew Biden was gonna win the nom by that point)
Please explain to me what kinda change I‚Äôm getting that will positively affect my life under Biden? Voting for billionaires doesn‚Äôt help the working class no matter which party is in charge.
Yes. Kamala is far more well known than tim kaine. Kamala helps him and if Biden wins I‚Äôll be proven right and Kyle will take another L since at this point he‚Äôs obviously rooting for Trump to beat Biden.

I agree Biden is easier to be manipulated. BUT who is he being manipulated by? Bernie Sanders? Nope. 103 billionaires who despise the working class? OF COURSE! If Joe Biden has any intentions of going left, he would have picked a progressive as VP instead of Copmala
You all seriously going to ignore the fact that Kamala Harris thinks Joe Biden is a rapey groper?
Biden's VP Pick: What Republicans have to say about Kamala Harris
I don‚Äôt know anyone personally whose lives are financially better off under Obama/Biden than trump. Personally, is the same and is gonna be the same until we guillotine the billionaire bribe takers within the party

I‚Äôm walking the walk with my vote. Fuck Biden. Fuck Copmala, FUCK Trump. btw, if I had unionization for Walmart in my Bio, I‚Äôd be fired tomorrow. I have to work at Walmart cuz bill Clinton shipped all the jobs overseas. Fuck the billionaire loving democrats bro
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said she believes and respects the women who have come forward alleging that former Vice President Joe Biden touched them without their consent.
This reads like someone making fun of people voting for Biden.
They aren‚Äôt gonna improve under 4 years of trump just as they aren‚Äôt under 8 years of Biden/Harris. In fact, 8 years of Biden/Harris will SLOW progress for poor people. Must destroy the party so the working class can take it back over. That‚Äôs what I vote for.
YES!! She will be a great VP and a great ally for Mr. Biden AND the Country! November 3rd...Please hurry and get here so we can end our country's worst nightmare!!
Planet was just as fucked under Frackin‚Äô Joe, min wage never raised under Biden/Obama, Biden/Obama started the kids in cages and exploded mass deportation. Love how y‚Äôall just forget his record because orange man bad
I do think Joe Biden is a better representative and leader. I dont agree with all his policy but I think he's a safer choice to return us to some level of normalcy. Trump is too hated man. People will always rebel against him
The DNC rigged the primary- that‚Äôs why Bernie lost. I‚Äôm not voting for corrupt republicans who pose as democrats sorry. My life ain‚Äôt changing for the better under a Biden presidency. 2008-16  compared to 2016-20 is the proof
I voted for Biden in the primary. I also knew from the jump he was gonna pick Kamala. And Yang endorsed Biden.
I was really hoping Joe Biden would die before he picked a VP. There REALLY is no God
Now do the reactions from poor people who won‚Äôt see a bit of change wether it‚Äôs trump or Biden. Pretty sure we outnumber rich people and celebs
Trump/Biden- no healthcare, no raising of minimum wage, no UBI, no green new deal, no marijuana legalization, etc...For poor people, Biden and Trump ARE THE SAME.

* 8million x worse for everyone but esp anyone who isn‚Äôt rich, white, straight, cis, disabled, christian... I could go on &amp; on. It really doesn‚Äôt matter what we think of this pick. Now isn‚Äôt the time to shit all over her. This is the ticket &amp; Biden winning is just too important.
Joe Biden is not just building a bridge to the future.  He just built a super highway.

If Biden is only trailing Trump by 2 in Texas, it won‚Äôt matter how Texas finishes.
You know what? I don't think Joe Biden should bother debating  I think he should debate this wonderful immigrant 1st &amp; if he survives that then he can debate  Democrats with 1/2 a brain will admit Joe will lose!  #BidensNotFit
This Biden supporter or satin worshipper (who can tell the difference except God) thinks it's a shame I survived a stroke.   That's how sick the left is. I'd hate to feel that small.
She always looks absolutely miserable all the time!  Come off your high horse and take that stick out of your ass and VOTE BIDEN!
Is that really Biden? Something looks off. Yes I think he'd do that but the hair plugs are missing lol
I bet whoever wrote this for Joe is really regretting this tweetüôÑü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Let's hear from the real Joe Biden or is that asking too much?
biden vp announcement needed asap to flip the news cycle over from this disaster for congressional dems
Good thing I‚Äôm not a democrat. Susan Rice- NEEDS TRASHED...Barack Obama- NEEDS TRASHED...Joe Biden- NEEDS TRASHED. I don‚Äôt j ow enough about Karen Bass but I doubt she‚Äôs caused as much death and destruction as the others
Biden will destroy Trump in any presidential debate. Be careful what you wish for, Mr. President
This bet I may lose? Biden will select a white woman as VP, to appease whites, as racism is very much alive and well in America.
We aren‚Äôt Bernie fans you moron. We are a fan of working class policies. If we were ‚Äúfans‚Äù, Biden would be getting more than the 5% of Bernies grassroots donors since Bernie has endorsed HIS friend. Not our friend, but HIS.
You are totally right.  has been the #libertarian party for nearly 2 months and the democrats still don't have an officially nominated candidate. Jo should probably take Biden's spot. It is too late for him to join. #LetHerSpeak
Poor Biden is painted into a corner to select a black woman VP Candidate, all white Warren like Karens are throwing temper tantrums.
Don Surber: Veepstakes show Biden is too weak to be elected
That is good news but the question is, will  accept his upcoming loss? History professor who has accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Trump will lose
I have a sneaking feeling that IF Biden debates him even Once that will be it he won't do it again because he's mentally not up to it. Joe can't even answer softball questions from his lapdog media let alone handle a debate with
‚ÄúNow go out there Kanye and siphon votes from Joe Biden so I can have 4 more years protecting confederate statues, cracking down hard on every way black Americans try to demonstrate and expunging anything positive Barack Obama tired to do!‚Äù
If Biden wins, we will all be picking rice for Chairman Xi
Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working against Biden
Post office total shut down by Nov., Republican senators openly getting help from Russians To Dirty up Biden, postpone elections indefinitely are the tactics used by this racist bigot narcissistic Nazi to make America the greatest banana republic EVER!
You are on the ballot here in West by God Virginia! I‚Äôm betting you get more votes here than Biden does!
Sadly this is not unbelievable as we're learning anything can come out of #YouAintBlack Biden's mouth. How any of the potential VP picks can justify what Biden says just proves #YouAintDiverse.

Apparently no one has told #YouAintDiverse Joe that no President has ever had to shutdown the best economy America has ever had. The truth is in the details #YouAintBlack Biden.
Pollak: Joe Biden Mocked Trump‚Äòs Faith for Months, Shocked When Trump Fires Back  via
Is it just me or does Joe Biden resemble Clark Griswold's brother-in-law Eddie from the National Lampoon movies with the extremely inappropriate things that he says as if he doesn't know better but with Joe you know he does?  I see a meme coming..  #YouAintDiverse #YouAintBlack
I honestly don't know how Biden can move passed this one. There is no way to spin this other than exactly what he said in my opinion.  #YouAintDiverse  Iraq War Vet: Biden's Diversity Comment Shows How Democrats 'Really Feel About Black Americans'
Don‚Äôt vote for joe Biden vote for trump 2020
I def love  !! Always have!
It‚Äôs a great show. I watch Rachel, Larry O‚ÄôDonnell, then Brian Williams. I also like Anderson and Cuomo on CNN. Sometimes I record and watch then all. Depends on what‚Äôs going on that day.
Hahaha he sure did. Love  with Brian Williams!
Been saying all along the easiest path to victory for Trump is to beat Biden from the left
It was the early actions taken by President Trump that saved millions from dying. Had he allowed flights from China, who actually released the virus on the world, to continue this would have been 10 x's worse. You, Joe Biden, would not have the chutzpah to stop China on anything!
Nope they're straight up using him to beat the bad orange man and its not going to work. Even the reasonable people who don't like Trump understand Biden is in deep cognitive decline. It's not even about politics anymore he needs help not running a campaign.
So the right are the only ones getting the virus now? If that‚Äôs the case the polls are wrong showing Biden in the lead
They‚Äôre trying to paint him like joe Biden, and it doesn‚Äôt work
Just remember if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, then you ain‚Äôt black. Can‚Äôt get more racist than that
Mite be sometbing if this was actually created and spoke by Biden. This is nothing more than damage control by campaign aides. Biden is a racist and we know this because of his POLICIES. Shitlibs and gop always assume their voters are just as dumb as their candidates
Sir you are both delusional. Trump is the worst President ever. Biden 2020
Name one "latinx" country without people of African descent? Biden was saying "I got my African Americans."
This guy is a BernieBuster. Not a Bernie supporter. There‚Äôs a giant difference that I acknowledge. And Bernie did get his clock cleaned, before Bernie dropped out Biden was up 2 million+ votes.
Fred Fleitz: If Biden skips debates with Trump here's how our enemies will read it
Nice comment and funny how you forgot about Biden discussing African Americans versus Latinos. Had Trimp made that same comment the riots would double.
I miss Robin Williams and as for Joe Biden let's just say no one will be quoting him after he's gone because no one understands what the hell he's talking about when he speaks without a teleprompter which trust me he doesn't write his own speeches he just plagiarizes others.
Serious answer: On November 3 one of two people will be elected. Trump or Biden. That‚Äôs it. We have a first past the post system here in the United States and your socialist candidate got clobbered.
Ugh, the MAGATs are annoying, but you BernieBusters are the worst. Biden clobbered you. It‚Äôs over.
You mean like Biden just clarified? So it‚Äôs ok for trump but not anyone else?
Thank you Vice President Biden. We should all admit when we make foolish rhetorical mistakes and learn from them.
Starting to wonder if Biden is running or if it‚Äôs a team effort since he doesn‚Äôt speak for himself
"Mark Jacoby, a Republican and executive at a company called Let the Voters Decide, has reportedly collected signatures for West in Ohio, West Virginia, and Arkansas."
Ridiculous ... Joe Biden has been praying throughout his years of highs and lows - Trump only addressed a deity when his mushroom got polished. Prayer requires empathy, something #45 lacks throughout.
Where do you all get the idea that Biden‚Äôs going to do away with 2nd amendment rights? Fake news! No one wants to take away gun rights. I am a liberal and I don‚Äôt care if people have guns and I‚Äô#TheFive
I don‚Äôt know how trump can say Biden hates god, wants to hurt him, but his campaign uses pics of Biden praying to show he‚Äôs weak...either he‚Äôs a man of faith or he‚Äôs not. You can‚Äôt have it both ways #TrumpCantKeepItUp
Biden will confiscate as many guns in 4 years as Obama did in 8.
