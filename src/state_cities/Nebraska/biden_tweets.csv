The GOP knows that Trump is toast and they're getting off to an early start in sabotaging the economy &amp; a Biden presidency.
Intel officials tell Congress that Russia is spreading false information about Biden. That includes Trump
There's nothing kind about the crime bill he wrote and there's nothing good or moral about what how many drone strikes with civilian casualties the Obama/Biden admin did or the things Biden has said &amp; done against women (though I've learned not to get liberals started on Reade).

Agree that Biden says stupid things and will say more. Kind of a shitshow, really. He's not racist, of course. He has the grace and humility to apologize. Awaiting Trump's apology for saying he's "against God."

Lol Biden is the exact same way so idk what point we're trying to make.
I didn‚Äôt vote for president in 2016. Not going to again this year. I think both have cognitive issues. I think Biden wins in a landslide but might not make it through first term or if he does will only serve one term so VP pick is really important.

Clearly I'm not black. And on the contrary, it's my care for the Black community that has caused my disdain for Biden. You do understand what the '94 Crime Bill he wrote did to black communities right? You do know he said "I don't want my kids growing up in a racial jungle"?
I'll be voting for Biden in a dream state.
God when he sees Joe Biden leading the polls
Let‚Äôs face it. To support Trump and the personal attacks he levels on 60% of the country, and directly on Joe Biden, you have to be shameless.
A. Your entire politics is centered around opposition of one man, Trump, who employs childish name-calling tactics regularly. Yet you employ those same tactics. Why is that?  B. I am not privy to this "reframing" of Biden's. But I'm sure it was articulate &amp; poignant. Fill me in??
Now that so many of us who didn't know before have tasted the poison all too well, we need to completely drain the supply. And we can't do that by letting the DNC win with Biden. So yes 4 more years of that rancid Trump poison taste is worth it if we can start afresh in 2024.
The water's already poisoned beyond fixing. Has been since the very beginning, under Republican and Dem alike. We need to drain the supply completely &amp; rebuild the entire infrastructure. Electing Biden is like masking the taste of the poison whereas under Trump it's revolting.
It's my position that telling the DNC to go fuck itself instead of voting for Biden - who wrote the '94 crime bill and represents corporate cronyism and demonization of the black community just as Trump does - will lead us to brighter years ahead while giving into Biden does not
That's how Trump perceives Ohio folks as out of touch, hill billies that know nothing about Joe Biden. But Ohio seems to respond to Trump's snake oil pitch.
......than 4 years of no fundamental change under Biden (and no accountability for the DNC's blatant disregard for the working class and BIPOC) followed by a GOP resurgency in 2024
Because of the DNC's choice to coalesce against Bernie and force Biden down the electorate's throat, we are stuck with either 4 more years of Trump (and a chance to nominate an actual progressive in 2024) or 4 years of "nothing will fundamentally change" and a likely GOP 2024 win
Whut the whut? This sentiment amd the quote it came in is like the script to a bad Adult Swim cartoon.   Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible, hurt God,' guns

Every voter: any race, that is still on the fence about who to vote for must be fucking stupid. If you spend your time nitpicking Joe Biden because you want some kind of perfection in the WH the only thing that will happen will be 4 more years of a murderous moronic narcissist.
So? Biden couldn't finish a sentence using the word Thailand, or anything else...
Are you daft? Biden could pick my dog as VP &amp; it would still be a better ticket than the one headed by Trump.
You mean the Biden campaign? Wish I fucking could, Jack.
Like if your position is "I'm fully committed to voting for Biden" and simultaneously "he shouldn't talk to the media or on camera ever"...  what in the FUCK are you doing? Do you have any idea what kind of statement you're making and what kind of precedent you're setting here?
I'll argue the opposite. Put both Biden and Trump under floodlights between now &amp; Election Day, refusing to shut up about how they are slaps in the faces of the working class &amp; BIPOC. Generate shockingly low R/D turnout (&amp; high Green turnout) thereby forcing the DNC's hand in '24
Let‚Äôs just call it and let Joe Biden take over now!
You heard what Biden said about Black people today? Or you just don't care?
Well, Biden has my vote!
Fear? It is a staple of Trumps campaign. It is apparently the primary strategy for most GOP- fear that everyone who might vote Biden are radical socialist leftists bent on rioting. Talk about the silent majority- it is people who want competence and ethics in government again.
Meh.  We have a few...  less than human...  politicians anymore, but Biden isn't one of them.  Regular humans tend to struggle with the hurting gods thing.

Joe Biden replied to an NPR reporter during an interview that aired at the convention of the National Association of Black Journalists and National Association of Hispanic Journalists.
Biden: "And by the way, what you all know, but most people don‚Äôt know, unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.‚Äù
Wow.  Biden is mighty enough to "hurt God"?  I had no idea he had such primal powers at his command.  Cool.

Trump Vs. Joe Biden‚Äôs VP
Trump is right, Biden will do as Obama, jail Kim Davis, sue the Little Sisters of the Poor, force to pay for abortion and contraception, and Biden would never protect bakers from the lgbt mob suing them. Biden hates christians.
Biden also openly advocates for the slaughtering of unborn babies, which is one of the worst sins according to catholic faith and doctrine.

joe biden is obviously racist.
being loud and upset about legitimate reasons, not okay. I can see Biden having that view (although I have not a clue). Our time is so short. We ABSOLUTELY need the Biden Campaign to connect with the Latinx community. How do we get this done?
I guess to me ... I already know what Pence is. And the VP candidate for Biden could be a random 35yo with no experience and I'd rather it be them than Pence.
Republicans only get "freaked out" about spending &amp; borrowing when a Democrat is in the W.H.  The GOP knows that Trump is toast &amp; they're already beginning to sabotage the economy &amp; a Biden presidency with their opposition to more stimulus for working families.

Maybe Maggie is saying that criticizing the  Biden campaign in public is unprofessional not that there's not a justifiable complaint with the campaign. But then who does Maya contact within the campaign to get someone's ear?
Trump's inability to express a coherent thought? That's a 100% legit area of concern. Likewise Biden's "age issues". I'd love to see a debate moderator press both of them on that.
In theory, I agree with you on the icky factor.   But the reality is POTUS is one of the very few jobs where having somebody mentally/physically unfit can really be detrimental.  And that's not "whataboutism" because of past attacks against Hillary and Biden's health.
What is the point? Joe Biden doesn't remember anything!
As an anarchist; you can recognize that neoliberalism is preferable to fascism.  There isn't really another valid choice for presidency if you're able to vote.  This doesn't mean that the end all of your political engagement is voting for Biden. And dear God it shouldn't it.

The CIA has ignored requests to brief senators as part of a Republican-led investigation that targets presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Biden and his son Hunter, according to sources familiar with the matter and an email described to POLITICO.
I just saw that Biden has a 3% national lead &amp; he hasn't even debated Trump yet. Trump will gain ground thanks to debates just as he did in 2016. There is somehow far less enthusiasm for Biden than there was for Hillary. Plus Trump has political power now &amp; can play even dirtier.
I'd have to disagree with you there. We don't have a national election so national polls are relatively useless and way overblown. Yes they fairly accurately predicted Hillary's margin of victory in the popular vote (2.87m). But she lost the electoral college &amp; IMO so will Biden.
I really don't understand how after 2016 we can look at mid-2020 national polls / polls from a few purple/red-leaning states &amp; act like Trump is a huge underdog again. He's not. Follow the campaign money &amp; look at how little Biden is offering for those who didn't show for Hillary

Very few are. Before China sent this virus to the US, Trump had the economy humming and things were great! Unemployment at record lows! More blacks working and successful than ever. Black entrepreneurs killing it! My retirement accounts were overflowing! Damn China virus!
Pig licker? You can do better than that! Indian scammer callers do better than that!
Biden and the Democrats would like to ban so-called "assault weapons" again. The platforms that we use (AR, which stands for Armalite Rifle, not assault rifle) allows for more versatile customization and accessories. I guess they look like something the military would use. Scary!
You can see it from your bathtub...
This is the best possible ad for Biden honestly
Republicans aren't wrong when they note Biden's declining faculties, which no doubt will be on fuller display the next 89 days than the last 89. But beyond "person, man, woman, camera, TV," their guy is a menace to the English language &amp; the formation of coherent thought too. 1/2
If you're someone with a significant platform, use it responsibly please.  There's too many left leaning folks deluding themselves into the idea that Biden and Trump are equitable. They're not. Neoliberalism is preferable to fascism. That doesn't make neolib good. Nuance please.
If you don't see how neoliberalism is preferable to fascism I don't think there's any argument that could reach you.  Yeah Biden sucks, but to think Biden is exactly as bad as Trump is deceiving yourself.  If you're against fascism you'd be pretty strongly against Trump.

He would also never endorse Trump. Though if he was forced to choose between them, I suspect he would choose Biden, since Trump is the antithesis of the morals and values of both parties.

Did you actually look into what the article is talking about? Sanders is suggesting seizing the vaccine stocks and paying nothing for them.  Biden is suggesting the government buy the supplies and give them to people for free.   His tweet is entirely consistent with that.
The government's price being seizing the vaccine stocks and not paying anything? Since that's what he is suggesting doing, whereas Biden wants to support vaccine production (because vaccine production isn't profitable anyways and we should encourage them to make it regardless)
Except in the article it discusses that what he supports is the government buying the vaccine stocks once they are made. What Sanders is suggesting is the government seizing the stocks.   The article is in no way inconsistent with Biden's tweet about giving them out for free.
The vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that's more attuned to gender and racial biases.
Out of the ashes of Trumpism democracy will rise again.  Biden 2020
How is having the government buy the vaccine stocks and distribute them for free a right wing thing?  Since that's what Biden is suggesting, whereas Sanders wants to seize the vaccine stocks and not pay for them.
Has Biden indicated that he doesn't want to debate? Trump is wholly unaware of what's going on in the world, as he showed in that  interview. Seems like a preemptive attempt to justify calling off presidential debates so  doesn't embarrass himself.

I'm not saying Trump is good. You said Biden is good and that's not true just because hes not trump. Biden has almost 50 yrs of terrible policy on his track record. And 3rd party are viable especially if on ballots in all 50 states. It's just as easy to choose them as the others.
If the debate was fair she would dominate. There is much tangible political evidence to use against Trump and Biden and their policies and shes a smart woman.
If you think Biden is good you're off your rocker as well. What part of his campaign platform do you support besides the "I'm not trump" part? Neither of the 2 are good for our country.  is good for everyone. #votegold2020 #JoNotJoe #Jorgensen2020 #LetHerSpeak
If Biden is running for President than he needs to be in front of people,the MEDIA and not in hiding.  Absolutely ridiculous the cover game being done for this.  The AMERICAN PEOPLE deserve better.
I have been saying the only thing that would make me excited to vote for biden is if he gives us  as his VP nominee
MSM catering to white audience for money? Is money the ultimate reason? Didn't Chris Dodd and Ed Rendell say what they said against Kamala? Do you think Biden has made up his mind, not capitulating and the campaign is just biding time?
Re Biden's VP pick, I'll stick with the same answer I gave  at Netroots Nation 4 years ago when he asked me about Hillary's VP pick.  As long as he doesn't pick Zombie Curtis LeMay, he's got my vote and my wholehearted support.
Or in the alternative, tell the reporters that all of the women on Biden's short list are great (they are) and you trust Joe to make an outstanding pick.  I trust Joe.
"Dems also say there is insufficient support for Community Development Financial Institutions &amp; Minority Depository Institutions, which focus lending on populations lacking access to traditional banks."
Joe Biden's inauguration speech is gonna be so wild like "hey here's an actual plan to protect public health and the economy...also TikTok and the Postal Service are hereby reinstated."
It's because the DC Republicans know that Trump is toast and they want to get off to an early start in sabotaging the economy and the Biden presidency.
Also. Vote for Biden. Just kidding...I know you're not a douche canoe
There is a small part of me that wants Biden to pick Harris so I can see more of Maya Rudolf on SNL
Cali Sen Kamala Harris should be the Dem VP candidate.  An energetic &amp; courageous leader, Harris deserves the support of  &amp; the Latino community in the US  this crucial moment in history. We urge Biden to choose Kamala Harris.
It sure does not look good that Joe Biden allows old racist white men anywhere near his vetting team.

I definitely have seen that and become aware over the last few years. But I'm also a major empath, so I have had difficulty breaking from the fact that marginalized people's need to have trump gone. He is bad for a lot of people, and to not vote for Biden is extremely privileged.
The right to vote for either Trump or Biden seems like a false flag--two parties, delegates and no convention with platform participation.
If this is the type of thinking that the GOP have, they shouldn't be allowed to be involved in politics. If you think that Biden is actually left of center you are an imbecile.

Biden is having a conversation about opening schools. trump fu*ked the virus response up so badly that it isn't safe for kids, teachers or staff.  But the more Americans that die, the happier Putin is with trump and the gop, right?
I‚Äôm typically on the side of the victims, but I have high doubt she is one. She supported Biden until 2018ish, then came out with this story. Simple fact is, she has made herself an unreliable source and has made it harder on us victims to hold our predators accountable

Here are his exact words.  "Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly diverse attitudes about different things," Biden said.
Opportunity zones, the funding for HCBU‚Äôs, prison reform, record low unemployment pre-covid, school choice, first black military chief. A racist has done more for blacks in 4yrs then Biden has done in 44yrs.
But even among them it's split on who the best choice is, so you can only get a few. And in what states, since electoral is what matters? Thousands, even hundreds of "bros" are going to be swayed to vote for Biden in Ohio.. by which VP choice?

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs against God. He‚Äôs against guns. He‚Äôs against energy, our kind of energy. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to do too well in Ohio."
Biden has always been a hard core racist while Trump, as a private citizen, was receiving awards for his good work in race relations. But now the lying fake media calls Trump the racist!
‚ÄúOur kind of energy.‚Äù You mean the kind of energy that‚Äôs been draining the earth of natural resources and slowly destroying it? +1 for Biden I guess.
Republicans are so much better at making Biden sound cool than Democrats are.
Ur not black unless u vote for me  - ‚Äújoe biden‚Äù the 80yr old white man
I know he's confused Iowa with Ohio.
Joe Biden BADLY Slurs Words Again, And We Have No Idea What He Was Trying To Say
Joe Biden Suggests All Black People Think Alike, Unlike Latinos
America will have 1,000 daily deaths due to Covid 19 until January when Biden takes over!!!
America might have 1,000 Covid 19 deaths daily until Biden can take over in January!?!
God can take care of himself. God does not need Donald Trump to protect him from Biden. This is ridiculous. Trump protecting God from Biden?
Biden called black people stupid. Which is worse?
Biden will not ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù. That is ridiculous. Did people break out laughing? What kind of audience was this? What can Biden do to God anyway? Were there any follow up questions? Is this the new Trump strategy? Protect God from Biden?
I think it‚Äôs safe to say that Biden is either losing his mind, or he‚Äôs a racist. Maybe both.
WTF! Biden's NOT against God you POS! The last time you were in a church last - the Catholics had to perform an exorcism to rid the place of the evil you brought with you!    Trump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible'
How lame is it when Biden's best campaign strategy is no campaign?
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity  #FoxNews biden along with ABC. NBC, CBS, MSNBC. CNN A D THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, all racist.  The american people need to wake up.
Joe Biden after he sniffs some hair
Well the Left has certainly tried to get him out.They set up his campaign with false claims &amp; falsified evidence of Russian collusion, have screamed racism with no evidence except biased left media narrative while Biden shows racism ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote for me then you ain‚Äôt black‚Äù
Move over Kratos, Joe Biden here to steal your god hurting crown
This is fear mongering. Why do you have to be so extreme? Just state the facts. There is plenty on records form Biden that sucks without making stuff up.
Maybe after we elect Biden.
Joe Biden, bruh.
Dude, there is nothing you or Joe Biden can say to make me vote for you. We've suffered your lies for over 3 years now. Nobody is unsure at this point. Let's just vote now and put this nightmare behind us.
Joe Biden can make God bleed. That's pretty bad ass.
If your argument against Biden is ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not all there.‚Äù I‚Äôm seeing this waaay too often as a clap back...Please re evaluate everything and listen to any...ANY interview with Trump.   Thank you.
Biden is all Powerful and able to control God. I say that is one impressive and strong person....
Biden says latinos think better than blacks, and Trump says Biden is hurting God.  Wow this #2020Election is crazy!  Or at least 2 old white men are...
Your tweet is exactly why a lot of people think the Republican Party is racist.   What you say and Biden say are the exact same thing back from a racist era.
people need to listen to all Joe biden's racist comments over his career. Thats fine if people want to vote for him BUT he truly is a racist in the old school sense not the new liberal definition of racist that includes everyone that disagrees with them.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden were having a push up contest, and Bill Brasky came in late, did twice as many push ups as both of them while taking a mental aptitude test, and got up and punched socialism in the balls. TO BILL BRASKY

I asked Biden voters - defend Biden without mentioning Trump.....GO
What joe biden thinks of the black community
You guys are really worried about Trumps health when Biden can‚Äôt even talk and we‚Äôve known that since he announced he‚Äôs running?
What joe biden thinks of the black community
Would you like to meet David Duke then? And you‚Äôre supreme leader claimed Mexicans are rapists, referred to people as ‚Äúthe blacks‚Äù, and told Jewish people he is a ‚Äúnegotiator like you folks‚Äù. But ok, Biden‚Äôs quote takes the cake
Biden is a racist and always has been. Stop making excuses and lying because he will keep making you look stupid.
If Biden was actually Catholic he wouldn't advocate for the systematic genocide of children, shutting down churches, and destruction of the nuclear family. But wait - he's not.
Have you listened to Trump these past 3.5 years? He‚Äôs totally out of his element. Has no concept of how to run a government. This isn‚Äôt an autocratic private company in which he can do as he pleases. Biden knows government and how to get things done within that framework.
Joe Biden gonna drain the worlds oceans
Joe Biden is definitely a racist
Joe Biden is f***ing nuts!
Cognitive test question Biden said No I haven't taken a test Why the hell would I take a test? Come on man. That's like saying you before you got on this program you take a test were you're taking cocaine or not What do you think Huh Are you a junkie to a black journalist
How about somebody asks Biden what country he is in?Good luck with that.
Of all the stupid pro-Trump posts I‚Äôve seen, this has to rank near the top. Biden is for ‚Äúkilling babies...poverty...communism...    letting anyone vote...?‚Äù This is the most ludicrous and misleading piece of crap I‚Äôve yet seen. Shame on you for posting.
Classic Biden behavior!!
wait!....what!?.........Did #biden just call blacks stupid?.....What a disgusting man....unfit for leadership......#nursinghomejoe
So...you're saying that some of your most vocal (or deplorable) supporters would actually vote for Biden based on his debate performance? If that were true, Hillary would have mopped the floor with you in the election, but instead she "only" won the popular vote by three mill.
YES! Vote Biden, but that is just step 1. The world does get better in many ways once he's elected, but we have to expect more of him than what he's shown us so far.
Joe Biden Hits Trump‚Äôs Biggest Boast With A Brutal Coronavirus Reality Check  #SmartNews
Experts held 'war games' on the Trump vs. Biden election. Their finding? Brace for a mess  #SmartNews
Both very light skinned.  One a real political prostitute.  The other a muslim terrorist lover and enabler.
Biden is strong, Trump is weak.
50,000 Americans were diagnosed with covid *yesterday*. 1100 Americans died of covid *yesterday*.  One of the rich old white men running for president is saying everything is under control.   The other just put out a video about car manufacturing.  I'll vote Biden. But COME ON!!!
My hope, I‚Äôm not sure how confident I am, is that Biden will be largely center-left/neoliberal and tribalism will take over, redirecting left wing energy from dismantling the American project to explaining why hiking the top tax rate by 3.6% is a priority of historic importance.
You're not gonna debate You're gonna go up there and talk shit "wheres hunter biden joe" piss off

So when do you plan to actually stop working for Kamala Harris and the Biden Campaign?
a whole bunch of criminal indictments are coming, including hunter biden .. biden will look like he's hiding  .
To top that Bible stunt, he is showing photos of Biden praying to illustrate that he is unfit. He will be praying himself when he loses &amp; he can't use to presidency as a shield from arrest..big time prayers..unanswered?
Thats fine, but realize Biden made no decisions in the WH from 2008-2016, besides what women to touch and make feel uncomfortable.
Remember how well China flourished during the Obama years? Why would it be any different under Biden?

Anybody aware that he Trump  works for free? I wonder will Joe Biden?
Mr.President. By now if your a voting constituent. You have to be aware of possible cognitive issues with Joe Biden. Does anybody remember your pre covid-19 successes? The only way Dems will win is by cheating with mail-in ballots. Not to be confused with absentee voting!
Scum ball Clyborn  whh are you covering up for Biden and obama  they committed treason
Actually sad when you have gone through this with a loved one.  For the life of me, I can‚Äôt understand knowing Jill Biden is allowing this to happen.  She seems like a nice person but allowing this is far from nice, good or right.
What's that about the insanity of doing the same thing over &amp; over again, expecting a different outcome? Current time loop--Obama, Biden/Russia/Ukraine, now "hydroxy" again with Navarro (actually not an economist) playing doctor &amp; DJT claiming "only I can solve this problem."
The next bill needs to address corrupt politicians like you and Biden who attempted to use the FBI and DOJ to take down a president.  You are scum
Why are  et al., trying to swift-boat Biden via Obama in a vain attempt to protect  from his Putin obedience &amp;  continued collusion w/Putin folks via convicted Ukraine folks? Even Barr can't find anything.
Joe Biden has always been dumb. But now he is ANGRY and dumb. This man is sick.

Explain to me how Biden is a one term president and his VP gets the job?
lol. Biden can't win
That is not what that article says. Some Republicans are helping him get on the ballot in some states. That in no way is saying that his whole run is a "Highly coordinated Republican operation to suppress Black Vote for Biden"
Every one should stop calling Mr. Biden Jim Crow Joe and vote for him.
Did you know your dad is the current President? Not Biden?
If the do so to him, they need to hold Biden to the same standards for starters. then CNN, Fox news, MSNBC, Etc.
No matter what Trump is going 2 contest the results of the election when Biden wins.  It's part of the Putin playbook 2 destroy democracy by discrediting elections &amp; so far Trump has followed Putin's playbook 2 destroy dR democracy.

Oh well. Too bad the dnc put such a POS like Joe Biden as their candidate and will lose to Trump. Guess they should have listened when we said Bernie or Bust.
Well, if that's the game we're playing, then as former VP, doesn't Biden also have access to the WH?

My point was other then your hatred toward Trump was Biden the right choice? The answer is not I hate Trump so he is better. Why is he better?
Joe ain't winning... No one is going to vote again, and deep down I don't care. My life has been better with Trump. Don't like him but my life is better. So no to Biden, and his followers. They left us out so I'm not coming to help.
Biden is going to give his nomination acceptance speech from a non disclosed place in Delaware. Why can't the news say his basement?
Trump lies anyway if his mouth is moving so I don't think a debate would accomplish anything productive or insightful. We know who Joe Biden is from his many years of service to this country and we know Trump is the one taking no responsibility but all the credit (and for WHAT?).
Tell Joe Biden to remove Larry Summers as economic advisor
Bill, I absolutely agree with you much of the time, but I am confused by your position on this topic. Trump will absolutely not release his tax returns, and Biden would absolutely slaughter him in a debate. We should give Trump no easy out on this one.
If biden gets elected illegally, he will resign and the VP will take office, hillary, wait and see, that's why he hasn't picked a VP yet.
That's because your nuts biden

Biden be damned, but Woods is taking that out of context to make a point.
I honestly don't think Biden know what's going on let alone what he's doing. The man needs medical help and nobody is getting it for him. The Democrats and his family should be ashamed of themselves.
It will be soon and we‚Äôll put Biden in the nursing home he deserves... poor guy
Only in that the media demonizes him while silent on Joe and his idiot statements and softball questions. If Trump would have asked a Black Anchor if he had used cocaine because he asked a ligit question that had been asked before where Biden said he did take cognitive tests
democrats in inauguration day be like: And here's Joe Biden!
Trump can debate a cardboard cutout of Hidin‚Äô Biden.  He‚Äôs merely a facade in more ways than one.

what proof do you have that Biden is mentally compromised at all or at least more so than Trump?  Trump suggests injecting people with disinfectant and thinks passing a test for dementia makes him a genius.  That is proof Trump is compromised.  I can get more if needed.

Biden won't be President, even if he somehow defeats Trump. And that scares me more than four more years of Trump.

It‚Äôs trump saying Biden can‚Äôt interview for me.
How is it that Trump has been sued well over 3,000 times since his innoguration and this isn't being talked about nearly enough?? How could he stand on a stage against Biden and keep a straight face? Disgusting.
I've seen old tattered Bernie signs and even a Yang sign but not a single Biden sign. How many people actually know he's a candidate?
Biden bros think they are doing harm reduction by voting for him.  I say bullshit. You are setting the stage for full blown fascism in America. I am now diametrically opposed to both parties in America.  If you are not falling in line with M4A, GND, 20 min wage, you are my enemy.
I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden. Anything else is a vote for Trump sadly and we cannot take another four years of his shit. He‚Äôs completely torn what was left of the country apart.
Everyone can make a mistake. But how is he going to make fun of Biden for mistakes when he does this shit? Oh yeah he's a hypocrite.
Are you going to vote for Biden?
Why would anyone even care when there is a compelling candidate like Joe Biden?
The GOP are aware of Trumps inability to defeat Biden. Which is why they are planning to steal the majority in the House. Appoint Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House. Which interns allows him to become the interim President. Giving the Republicans all 3 branches of government.
right, and he still won. Pretty damning statement for Bernie and the "movement". I think more than anything America wants normal and predictable leadership, and Biden is that. That is where we stand.
I never called him a political genius. He is absolutely where he is because of Obama... Bernie couldn't beat Clinton, or Biden. So... I don't think he has what it takes to win nationally. Clearly he doesn't. Bidens all we got.
you can push biden to the left. he already has a more progressive platform now than when he started. AOC and Bernie are working with him on stuff. its cool.
I feel like ur politics will never be actualized in this country. Which is fine I guess, but I imagine you are discouraged a lot. Either way, Biden is closer to being a socialist than Trump.
Bernie, AOC, Noam Chomsky, and myself, are all voting for Biden this year. But sure, YOU, know whats best for progressive causes. Im sure of it.
of course not. I agree. But praising a communist leader, not a good look for Biden or his potential VP. That's all. Onto the next one folks.
nah. They aren't talking about those things, but Biden is warming up to it. They just want to beat trump, and on that, we can agree. Bernie is on my side, why can't you agree with Bernie?
god no Im a democrat/liberal and have voted so my entire life. I voted for Bernie in 2016 (then Hillary), Biden in 2020. Just think their ads are fire.
they will, ur right, but to actually say you love a commie, is a step too far for mainstream americans. Thats unfair but you know its true. its just unwise, thats all. Plus I think Kamala has more energy and fire, Bass is too mild-mannered like Biden.
It's a fair argument. And I agree Biden is a weak candidate. I think something like a single payer option may provide the foundation for M4A to become the law of the land in 2024ish, when we win again (hopefully). I think people just want a safe play, and M4A scared some away
Wtf you talking about? I don't think we should appeal to repubs at all, we should appeal to democrats, who voted for Biden. And I don't think praising socialist dictators is a good look. That's literally it. Why am I listening to you bernie bros anyway? Lol yall lost big
Never made sense for Biden to get into a debate with Trump. But, the presidental candidates should debate.

let me make this clear - its bad strategy, for BIDEN voters, for him to elect a VP, who praised a socialist dictator. Simple. Make sense? We must occasionally accept criticism, I know its hard but its necessary for survival.
Democrats should focus on pleasing Democrats, I agree.. And a bunch of Democrats, who voted for Joe Biden, probably won't like a VP who praised a cuban socialist thug. Make sense? Sound fair?
You think? Why do you say that? She is 100% against Trump and for Biden, which is not the most conservative outcome possible. have you thought this through at all? (btw I like your user name)
We can all be Americans against Trump. Anyone against Trump I will listen to. Not all the time, but case by case. In this case - Karen Bass praising a Cuban dictator, it's fair to say that's bad optics for the Biden voter. Make sense? It's not all black n white.
After Trump tosses another medical expert aside, Biden suggests actually listening to them
It's a fair distinction you make and a fair point. I do question what you see as the Democratic "base" however. Listen, I don't agree with everything Rubin says, but the Cuban dictator sympathizing doesn't speak to the majority of Dems. Considering we elected Biden. Bad look.

Mr Biden, It is what it is also when it comes to our troops that are getting shot at for money. Mr Trump leader of the GOP that is pro military doesn't care.
There is no question Trump has lose support among Republicans since March of this year. Trump no longer has an automatic 96% approval from Republicans. Republicans are comfortable voting for Joe Biden just to end the daily drama.
That because Crazy Nancy is busy coaching her b/f Crying Chuck in the senate negotiations on cares act. Her and Chucky snd Pencil Neck Shiffty need to get together to make the selection for Biden. That way they can use the 25th and get rid of him and run the country their way.

You have to look past Joe BideN and at his VP. Within the first 2 years Biden‚Äôs will resign because of his health. I watched it happen to my grandmother and he does have early onset of dementia. I‚Äôm an American and I will vote for the person with the best policies
Why do I get the strange feeling hillary will be the pick, and if biden wins, he'll resign due to mental health and hillary becomes president.
I‚Äôm not a trump person, but isn‚Äôt weird Biden still doesn‚Äôt have a running mate? Maybe he gets elected and then they say he is mentally unstable... bam their choice for president slide in under the VP place. Never voted by the people only that party. No one running is a good fit
No really, what will a Biden presidency do that is any measure better than the Trump regime? My only thought is the RBGs replacement and even then I'm not sure they won't just shove a "liberal" Neil Gorsuch down our throats

Biden assails Trump for 'bald-faced lies' about voting by mail
The only way Biden should seriously consider ducking is if he‚Äôs every bit the oatmeal brained invalid Trump has made him out to be.   The Trump campaign has sunk so much into that narrative that one decent debate destroys the talking point and likely sews up the election.
It's a bot and it does the exact same thing to Biden's tweets.  Sensitive much?
Sure they will, trump will debate issues, while biden plays with a miss potatohead...   of course hell just sniff the plastic hair, but none the less he wont know where he's at.

That was the NYT saying there shouldn't be debates. They're not alone. Of course Biden is going to say (bluff) he wants them. He can't say otherwise but I doubt his handlers want it. He's got nothing to gain from them. I'll be very surprised if any happen.
Two out of three already canceled. Notre Dame and U of Michigan. Alternate sites have been selected but I won't believe they happen until I see it and there are calls to not have any.

This is how well the Twitterverse thinks of Kara Eastman. Joe fucking Biden has to drag her across the finish line. He wins. She looses.
Kara Eastman will lose but Joe Biden will win. If she was a good candidate she would win.
Biden gave an interview in June where he said he thinks the military would escort Trump from the WH. I am skeptical; every right winger everywhere will scream bloody murder about a coup, and the military knows it.
He can keep trying to buy my love, I will keep cashing his checks and still vote for Biden this coming election.
He is talking about the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù so when Russian hackers (already inside numerous swing state voting systems) change the outcome of what should be an overwhelming win for Joe Biden, people will actually believe there was a huge silent faction for Trump. See

Joe Biden does but he forgot that he thinks that he has dementia.
Based on my (very limited) survey of rural political sentiment (campaign signs on farm property between here and Grand Island), Biden needs to step up his farm game.  Turns out, two suburban neighbors are Trump's, too (that I know of).  It's depressing, honestly.
No to Kamala Harris. She let innocent people rot in jail and did unethical prosecutions. She will be a disaster as VP especially since she'll run for President if she is elected Vice President with Biden on day 1. Susan Rice would be a much better VP.
A Biden Tulsi card might be the only way we can get trump out of office.

I mean, we all kind of thought Biden wasn't the candidate for the moment last year and the moment didn't agree. So... whatever. I'm actually higher on Harris than others are, but I get your concerns. There's little electoral consequence for 2020 but potentially large beyond that.
My hope is that she's still going to be very involved in the appointment process, particularly for Cabinet-level offices that are going to require Senate approval. I'd love her to be VP, but I just can't see Biden making that choice.
I think it's going to be Harris because I believe Biden's going to pick someone with a similar style to him and Warren would be too much of a clash. But I don't know that, because I know nothing.
Are they ... are they expecting Biden to run for a second term? He's 78 years old! In January 2025, he'll be 84!  I do not want an 84-year-old white dude to be president. Hell, I don't even want a 78-year-old white dude to be president, but, you know, extenuating circumstances.

Nobody wants a VP who puts becoming president 1 day ahead of having ur back. The job is about loyalty &amp; being subservient to the president. &amp; she trashed Biden viciously during the debates. If a male candidate had trashed Biden like that he shouldn't choose the man either.

But even among them it's split on who the best choice is, so you can only get a few. And in what states, since electoral is what matters? Thousands, even hundreds of "bros" are going to be swayed to vote for Biden in Ohio.. by which VP choice?

Biden:   Says something stumbling &amp; stupid out of his senility and racism. . Some committee of dozens of staffers on the Biden campaign:   Writes a focus-group tested correction hours later. #LatherRinseRepeat
I sure hope Trump is spying on everyone in and around the Biden campaign as we speak.
Thank you for your continued efforts to put country over party. This has to be exhausting thank you for representing the people of America. (I am absolutely fine with President Pelosi, President Biden)
I get that. I wouldn‚Äôt be happy about it, yet my thought would be, If it‚Äôs Joe Biden vs a woman who represents what I think the Biblical model for government is, then I‚Äôm probably going to have to just vote for her and accept that God is shaming us.
Trump falsely says Biden, a practicing Catholic, is "against God"
Biden just believes Hispanics are more talented than African-Americans...
Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
Donald Trump claims Joe Biden is 'against God;' Biden aides call Trump a hypocritical divider
Right, he‚Äôs the candidate that‚Äôs sick and can‚Äôt talk properly. Ha! Your such a joker, Jon. üòú Biden has dementia. Very sad, but true.
No VP announcement yet;  I guess Biden can't make his mind up
Top GOP senators give Trump the Biden probe he got impeached for trying to force on Ukraine
Biden makes clear Trump wouldn't get any special favors to avoid criminal prosecution
What is it about Biden that makes you think he'd be a good (or even competent) President?  Honest question.

In Wild Rant, Trump Says President Biden Would ‚ÄòHurt God‚Äô  #SmartNews
Apparently Joe Biden will #hurtGod  So any I .. Fuckin what? Who said tha.. Ohh right. Him.  Why does anyone listen to rhe walking orange push up? Did I miss a meeting?
If God can be hurt by Joe Biden then clearly Joe has not gotten nearly enough credit over the years.
Biden is a political disaster and needs to be replaced as the Democratic candidate.
What joe biden thinks of the black community
I would love for a moderator to ask them both to recite one verse from the Bible.  Guessing Biden would nail it and Trump would make some excuse as to why he couldn't.
DNC thought they were playing it safe thinking Biden would have the best chance beating trump. There were better candidates... let‚Äôs say dems win, what‚Äôs going to happen 3 years from now when he‚Äôs already this out of it?
Maybe but the point I was making is all the Dems pander and act like they are part of the "group" with their fake mannerisms and speech patterns are very telling. Hillary Obama and Biden -
Then you are idiot because the first one is automatically cancelled with Biden haha
I won't put up an Eastman or Biden sign in my yard until after I've delivered my mail-in ballot because, you know, GOP election riggers.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs against God. He‚Äôs against guns. He‚Äôs against energy, our kind of energy. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to do too well in Ohio."

Joe Biden Suggests All Black People Think Alike, Unlike Latinos
God can take care of himself. God does not need Donald Trump to protect him from Biden. This is ridiculous. Trump protecting God from Biden?
Biden called black people stupid. Which is worse?
Biden will not ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù. That is ridiculous. Did people break out laughing? What kind of audience was this? What can Biden do to God anyway? Were there any follow up questions? Is this the new Trump strategy? Protect God from Biden?
I think it‚Äôs safe to say that Biden is either losing his mind, or he‚Äôs a racist. Maybe both.
WTF! Biden's NOT against God you POS! The last time you were in a church last - the Catholics had to perform an exorcism to rid the place of the evil you brought with you!    Trump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible'
Joe Biden after he sniffs some hair
Well the Left has certainly tried to get him out.They set up his campaign with false claims &amp; falsified evidence of Russian collusion, have screamed racism with no evidence except biased left media narrative while Biden shows racism ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote for me then you ain‚Äôt black‚Äù
Maybe after we elect Biden.
Joe Biden, bruh.
Dude, there is nothing you or Joe Biden can say to make me vote for you. We've suffered your lies for over 3 years now. Nobody is unsure at this point. Let's just vote now and put this nightmare behind us.
Joe Biden can make God bleed. That's pretty bad ass.
Biden is all Powerful and able to control God. I say that is one impressive and strong person....
Your tweet is exactly why a lot of people think the Republican Party is racist.   What you say and Biden say are the exact same thing back from a racist era.
people need to listen to all Joe biden's racist comments over his career. Thats fine if people want to vote for him BUT he truly is a racist in the old school sense not the new liberal definition of racist that includes everyone that disagrees with them.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden were having a push up contest, and Bill Brasky came in late, did twice as many push ups as both of them while taking a mental aptitude test, and got up and punched socialism in the balls. TO BILL BRASKY

You guys are really worried about Trumps health when Biden can‚Äôt even talk and we‚Äôve known that since he announced he‚Äôs running?
What joe biden thinks of the black community
Would you like to meet David Duke then? And you‚Äôre supreme leader claimed Mexicans are rapists, referred to people as ‚Äúthe blacks‚Äù, and told Jewish people he is a ‚Äúnegotiator like you folks‚Äù. But ok, Biden‚Äôs quote takes the cake
Biden is a racist and always has been. Stop making excuses and lying because he will keep making you look stupid.
If Biden was actually Catholic he wouldn't advocate for the systematic genocide of children, shutting down churches, and destruction of the nuclear family. But wait - he's not.
Joe Biden gonna drain the worlds oceans
Joe Biden is definitely a racist
Joe Biden is f***ing nuts!
Cognitive test question Biden said No I haven't taken a test Why the hell would I take a test? Come on man. That's like saying you before you got on this program you take a test were you're taking cocaine or not What do you think Huh Are you a junkie to a black journalist
How about somebody asks Biden what country he is in?Good luck with that.
Classic Biden behavior!!
wait!....what!?.........Did #biden just call blacks stupid?.....What a disgusting man....unfit for leadership......#nursinghomejoe
So...you're saying that some of your most vocal (or deplorable) supporters would actually vote for Biden based on his debate performance? If that were true, Hillary would have mopped the floor with you in the election, but instead she "only" won the popular vote by three mill.
YES! Vote Biden, but that is just step 1. The world does get better in many ways once he's elected, but we have to expect more of him than what he's shown us so far.
Joe Biden Hits Trump‚Äôs Biggest Boast With A Brutal Coronavirus Reality Check  #SmartNews
Experts held 'war games' on the Trump vs. Biden election. Their finding? Brace for a mess  #SmartNews
Biden is strong, Trump is weak.
50,000 Americans were diagnosed with covid *yesterday*. 1100 Americans died of covid *yesterday*.  One of the rich old white men running for president is saying everything is under control.   The other just put out a video about car manufacturing.  I'll vote Biden. But COME ON!!!
My hope, I‚Äôm not sure how confident I am, is that Biden will be largely center-left/neoliberal and tribalism will take over, redirecting left wing energy from dismantling the American project to explaining why hiking the top tax rate by 3.6% is a priority of historic importance.
You're not gonna debate You're gonna go up there and talk shit "wheres hunter biden joe" piss off
I doubt Biden/Trump beats the Jericho/Cassidy debate but 2020's been pretty wild
I will be voting for Joe Biden no matter who the VP is. I would like to see Kamala Harris as the VP!
So when do you plan to actually stop working for Kamala Harris and the Biden Campaign?
To top that Bible stunt, he is showing photos of Biden praying to illustrate that he is unfit. He will be praying himself when he loses &amp; he can't use to presidency as a shield from arrest..big time prayers..unanswered?
Thats fine, but realize Biden made no decisions in the WH from 2008-2016, besides what women to touch and make feel uncomfortable.
Remember how well China flourished during the Obama years? Why would it be any different under Biden?

Anybody aware that he Trump  works for free? I wonder will Joe Biden?
Mr.President. By now if your a voting constituent. You have to be aware of possible cognitive issues with Joe Biden. Does anybody remember your pre covid-19 successes? The only way Dems will win is by cheating with mail-in ballots. Not to be confused with absentee voting!
Scum ball Clyborn  whh are you covering up for Biden and obama  they committed treason
Actually sad when you have gone through this with a loved one.  For the life of me, I can‚Äôt understand knowing Jill Biden is allowing this to happen.  She seems like a nice person but allowing this is far from nice, good or right.
What's that about the insanity of doing the same thing over &amp; over again, expecting a different outcome? Current time loop--Obama, Biden/Russia/Ukraine, now "hydroxy" again with Navarro (actually not an economist) playing doctor &amp; DJT claiming "only I can solve this problem."
The next bill needs to address corrupt politicians like you and Biden who attempted to use the FBI and DOJ to take down a president.  You are scum
Why are  et al., trying to swift-boat Biden via Obama in a vain attempt to protect  from his Putin obedience &amp;  continued collusion w/Putin folks via convicted Ukraine folks? Even Barr can't find anything.
Joe Biden has always been dumb. But now he is ANGRY and dumb. This man is sick.

lol. Biden can't win
That is not what that article says. Some Republicans are helping him get on the ballot in some states. That in no way is saying that his whole run is a "Highly coordinated Republican operation to suppress Black Vote for Biden"
Every one should stop calling Mr. Biden Jim Crow Joe and vote for him.
Did you know your dad is the current President? Not Biden?
If the do so to him, they need to hold Biden to the same standards for starters. then CNN, Fox news, MSNBC, Etc.

Oh well. Too bad the dnc put such a POS like Joe Biden as their candidate and will lose to Trump. Guess they should have listened when we said Bernie or Bust.

Biden is going to give his nomination acceptance speech from a non disclosed place in Delaware. Why can't the news say his basement?
Trump lies anyway if his mouth is moving so I don't think a debate would accomplish anything productive or insightful. We know who Joe Biden is from his many years of service to this country and we know Trump is the one taking no responsibility but all the credit (and for WHAT?).
Tell Joe Biden to remove Larry Summers as economic advisor
Bill, I absolutely agree with you much of the time, but I am confused by your position on this topic. Trump will absolutely not release his tax returns, and Biden would absolutely slaughter him in a debate. We should give Trump no easy out on this one.

It will be soon and we‚Äôll put Biden in the nursing home he deserves... poor guy
Only in that the media demonizes him while silent on Joe and his idiot statements and softball questions. If Trump would have asked a Black Anchor if he had used cocaine because he asked a ligit question that had been asked before where Biden said he did take cognitive tests

Check the video when Biden made his promise. He said ‚Äúwoman‚Äù not black woman. Stop with the misinformation.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
It went straight to Joe Biden‚Äôs website
Way too much attention is being paid to the appearance of the Biden/Harris campaign.  How will it look? Will people participate? Will people have enthusiasm for a virtual convention?  We are picking our next leader here, not the Batchelor.  Can we not nitpick? Please.
IMO the biggest one is that people over-estimate the impact of the pres. and underestimate congress.  Biden won't be vetoing shit for being too progressive.  The House and Senate will write most legislation.   Most policy outcomes will be largely identical under any D pres.
FYI lack of response to your nonsense means I, for one, am spending all my time motivating voters for Biden/Harris. Silence IS NOT agreement #realDonaldTrump #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpCrimeFamilyForPrison
My main vote will go to   as I agree with almost everything she says, bonus points she's not wildly racist, or a pedophile like Biden, and his new BFF Kamala Harris or as I like to call her Stalin 2.0 #Democrats #Republicans #Libertarians  #nomoretwopartysystem
Of course, because Biden is going to be with Harris today, Trump has to have a news convenience with Pence. If nothing else, he is predictable. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #BidenHarris2020
Callers have reported their signs are missing. We're out of  Biden signs.  They are HOT.   Get Kate Bolz for Congress signs at her tailgate, 7 pm, Wed, Aug. 19 at IBEW  #LNK
Of course Jared is supporting Kanyr. He snd Zivsnka just went to Wyoming to bribe Kanye to run to hopefully take votes from Biden. They‚Äôre both frauds who have stolen taxpayer funds for their personal is. Kanye is a worse mental midget than Trump,
I noticed and think that is a real statement about leadership. Biden believes in himself enough that he doesn't need someone who strokes his ego. He want someone who challenges and makes him think.
Umm, that's a hard "NO" from this Suburban Housewife. I can't wait to #VoteByMailEarly  for  &amp;  and the thought of  in any position in Biden's administration is delightful!  #BidenHarris2020
the latest polls suggest Biden is leading slightly in the Catholic vote, and that has to ‚Äúburn‚Äù most one issue voters like Tobin. they know Trump is amoral, but he is just a tool to save their ‚Äúreligious freedom‚Äù. Which by the way, means freedom to discriminate against gays,etc.
Here‚Äôs the ugly reality.  Make life as miserable as possible for people before the November election.  You would not be seeing these shutdowns late in the summer with Biden as president and you certainly would not see COVID day after day leading national newscasts.
I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT HARRIS &amp; BIDEN!!! The enthusiasm &amp; energy created by Joe's VP pick is palpable...together we will VOTE OUT the dictator-in-chief and restore America's democracy. For the 1st time in 3+ years I feel hope ‚úä‚ù§
Lol, üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Yeah, and Biden is also using Bernie's "manifesto" and going to kill the middle class with $3T in new taxes.
Umm, Kamala Harris? She called Biden a segregationist and a rapist, now she‚Äôs his running mate.
Do you have something worthwhile to do today? You will never measure up to the accomplishments and character of Biden
It‚Äôs okay to dislike Kamala and still know the right thing to do it to vote for Biden. Do I want either of them in office? No. But do I want Trump out?? YES
I didn't watch the clip but I did watch the primary season. Harris is radical left and will say whatever she thinks is the right answer. Reminds me of Hillary. Biden says whatever he's told to say.
Yeah, I‚Äôve seen people state they weren‚Äôt voting for Biden now. This isn‚Äôt the year to vote independent. It simply isn‚Äôt.
Former Vice President Joe Biden ends his running-mate process having traveled a far-reaching distance -- for his campaign and perhaps for a country that has never before had a woman of color on a presidential ticket.
Maybe - I‚Äôm really not enthusiastic given some of the names I‚Äôve heard
So in your opinion, not only is Biden not a real Catholic, but Barack Obama is???
Biden/Harris all the way!
&amp; people are really tryna act like joe Biden is the better option.. THEYRE BOTH EQUALLY BAD
That‚Äôs how the Trump campaign works NOT how Biden works.  Trumps incapable of running a show or .... basically anything. Name a success of Dementia J Trump. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
I do not want to disparage Joe Biden, but White male dominance in American politics needs to end.  I know Joe is helping to make this happen.
I am sure Biden will have all the answers....if he can just remember them.
That name still gets me haha. This sounds like something Biden would say trying to remember what their name was üòÜ
Biden will do just fine embarrassing himself...
Get to know Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's pick for Vice President.
dems really backed themselves into a corner on this whole kamala/biden/trump situation. talked negatively about kamala and biden for months because there were MUCH better candidates but now have to speak positively on them because it's the only chance to get trump out of office
Biden and Obama were worthless on H1N1. DemoRats hail mary alomg with racial divide going into the election. Pathetic
Judging by how hard and kinda desperately Republicans, including assorted MAGAs in my timeline, are going at Harris, Biden seems to have chosen wisely.
I'm not interested in relitigating Tulsi Gabbard's presidential campaign now that Kamala Harris is Biden's running mate. Tulsi is a good person. Demonizing her will only make the Biden/Harris ticket unlikeable for people who are already on the edge but willing to suck it up.
Damn...dude has every right to drag Biden through the mud like this. The gloves are off.
That's impossibly naive or willfully ignorant.  Trump is wretched, Biden and Harris decent and better for the country in every way.
There are people in this world who are going to buy into the ‚ÄúJoe Biden as a radical leftist candidate‚Äù rhetoric and that is never going to stop being hilarious to me.
Nope ! I would have preferred one of the other candidates. I will still vote for Joe Biden and his pick for vice president over trump any day and every day
No . I was hoping that he would pick Stacy Abrams or  Susan  Rice . I think with Kamila Harris , Joe Biden will still be a Vice President!!
Where are you getting your information? The Obama-Biden administration was one of the most respected presidential administrations in many years.
This is Biden's tempo to be honest. Not bad.
I don‚Äôt have that emoji but I am voting for Biden/Harris
Fuck joe biden. Fuck kamala harris. Don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôve got any moral high ground voting for these sacks of shit
Sounds to me like an excuse to avoid having to acknowledge that there wasn't actually a joke (or that the joke was about Biden dying).   It's pretty common for someone to say something horrible and then claim it was "just a joke" after. It's a trope at this point.
What's the joke exactly? I would love to know what the funny part is supposed to be? Is it just "Ha ha, Biden's gonna die"?
Kamala will make us proud of America alongside Joe Biden
I'll vote for her and Biden, but please excuse me if I'm not super enthused
With friends like these...
I think she's pretty skilled at plunging the knife without seeming mad about it. Ask Biden, hah.
I'm partial to how the socialist indoctrination camps masquerading as institutions of higher learning are going to help Biden steal the election.
Is Biden great? No. Is Kamala great? No. Is Trump great? Definitely no. The problem is Trump has PROVEN his incompetence over the last four years. We can do better. Let‚Äôs try SOMETHING different, yeah?
I heard Joe Biden was *actually* born in Kenya....
I look forward to voting by mail for Biden/Harris.  Every part of that sentence is upsetting to Trump and that makes it good. But also they will be so much better for our country than the steaming pile of rancid old mayonnaise we‚Äôve barely managed to endure since 2016.
Kamala Harris Will Make Sure Racial Justice Is a Key Part of Joe Biden‚Äôs Climate Agenda  via
wow! So let me get this right. Biden wants to take away guns destroy 2nd Amendment, no religion, no anything, hurt the bible, hurt God, against energy plus Kamala is against military, fracking, and healthcare - then what is left?  No more rainbows, no windows in your buildings?
So calling you out for basically stating Biden will die (but you aren't saying you want it to happen, sure, sure) is pearl-clutching?  Get over yourself, Ashley.   No one is gullible enough to believe you aren't insinuating what you blatantly are. "Mortal placeholder", indeed.
Like voting and getting EVERY MF to vote Biden/Harris!
And smile without looking deranged! I love both Biden &amp; Harris‚Äô sense of humor. Trump is so boring and stale.
You're not going to go all Joe Biden and blow in hubby's ear and rub his leg are ya?
I am voting for the Biden/Harris ticket in November.   Let's end this nightmare.
There is no way you can support Joe Biden. Why don't you just open up the town and let us get back to normal?  Mask off lady
Biden and Harris bonded over their experiences being ambushed by animal rights activists, sources say.   "These guys are doing exactly what Trump does, so don't pay attention to them" Biden was quoted saying.   "I love cheeseburgers" Harris quipped.
Biden is as stupid as Trump. Have y‚Äôall seen any of his campaigns? He doesn‚Äôt seem be all the way there.
I'm apparently in an argument with some of them right now after a person I thought I knew better made several tweets about how Kamala will be VP in four months, insinuating Biden will die.
I'm not nervous about Harris joining Biden. Allan Lichtman's prediction about Biden winning in 2020 makes very nervous.  He hasn't guessed wrong since 1984. Words of comfort,  please Momna! My stomach is already in knots.
can you comment on Allan Lichtman's presidendial predictions being correct since 1984 &amp; he is predicting Biden to win 2020? I need to be reassured that Trump will win!  Biden just can't.  :(
Trump would just cry like a baby and whine. Biden should not even think about debating him. It would be a waste of his valuable time.
I think more people may be excited about Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick of Kamala Harris than they are about Joe Biden. I think I fall into that camp. Actually, I know I do.
My heart feels refilled with hope that American freedoms under the Constitution will be honored once again by Biden and Harris. Trump tried his hardest to ignore the Constitution and steal rights, taxpayer funds, and create divisions of hate. Good riddance to bad rubbish, DT...
Some people I know say that biden is worse than trump but if trump wins then civil war is inevitable. Hard to disagree. They're both horrible.
Let's get it straight. Biden isn't thinking anything it's the Puppet Masters in the Democratic Party who know this is their only chance. Female and black.
Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris as his Vice President. Just 4 months after she said she ‚Äúbelieved‚Äù the woman who said they received unwanted touching from Joe Biden...
I see that you are now ok with a guy that sexually assaulted a staff member running for President and now you are excited about a woman who slept her way up and by the way, call Biden a racist and who supported Tara Reade.
I definitely wish that he wouldn't talk so dismissive of the virus though. I hope I can vote for Biden/Harris.
Biden would likely appoint a merrick garland type so the courts would be less likely to overturn important precedents than with another Trump nominee from fedralist society
Yes I‚Äôm voting for Biden but in reality I‚Äôm voting for Kamala Harris through Joe
Bold of you to assume Biden will win any term at all, especially now with a cop on the ticket.
Who threatened you into saying such nice things about Biden?
Based on...what exactly? Unlike Trump, who has a known unhealthy diet, aversion to exercise, and lies about his weight, Biden is rather healthy for his age, frequently goes jogging and the like, and hasn't had any general health problems to write home about.
Is Biden not complicit and involved in all of that? Lol
Not sure what more specific criticism is needed of someone that wants Biden to die in office.
Biden and Harris weren't my first choice, but at least I can respect them and trust our government in their hands. Something I have never been able to do with
Song for Biden ... "Do you suffer from short term loss? I don't remember" ... Chumbawumba ... lol
I‚Äôm not a religious person, but I‚Äôm disappointed a person in your position would tweet such a remark. Biden is a devout and proud Catholic. He may not be a perfect Catholic or Christian, but neither are you or anyone in this world.
My take as well. Pre-covid, we were looking at a Biden/Klobuchar ticket. We upgraded, a little.
It can only get better, if Biden/Harris win that is.
I don't mean to slag on Kamala (though her efforts to sustain mass incarceration remain very unsettling). She is a fine choice. I just wish...Democrats would quit dithering and show some courage. There were at least three other candidates (Kamala included) better than Biden.
Biden/Harris 2020: a more sensible police state

When you also add Biden's age + pandemic to the picture, which makes the chance of Harris stumbling into the presidency much higher, her anti-Catholicism and awful record on life becomes even more alarming.
Idk, as a trans woman,  I just really want Trump gone, I haven't slept well the last 4 years.  Biden  and Harris were not my choices, but I will gladly vote for them over Trump/Pence honestly.  If those are the choices,  it's easy, Bernie knows it too.
Realistically,  even if someone has completely different policy preferences than what Joe Biden offers, the fact that getting progressive change done will be easier under Biden than Trump, is a no brainer.
The rich need to start paying an with Biden you WILL
"a lot of progressives HAVEN'T gotten over biden's past record"  as a pretty radical progressive, i think it would be a waste of time for biden to try to chase progressives at this point. who do you think he could have picked that would've convinced progressive holdouts?
Biden/harris 2020: dems couldn‚Äôt give less of a fuck
‚Äúa potential successor who could become the nation‚Äôs first female president‚Äù
How?  Biden is obviously suffering from dementia.  It's crystal clear if you compare him to prior campaigns.  I'm quite certain that I could beat him on a debate stage.  Trump went toe-to-toe with Hillary, who had her wits about her.  Biden will be a complete push-over.
Actually...now that I think about it.  Was Simpsons right again?  Technically assuming Biden leaves soon (I could see within 6 months or at least after COVID,) wouldn't that still make it correct or were we assuming that Elizabeth was Lisa?   Just curious.
AND does she still "believe" Joe Biden's accusers like Tara Reade?  She said she did previously.
Hahahahaha So predictable. You need to yell and scream about the Democrats, how Biden and Harris will destroy America, the mail -in vote is corrupt, again. We all know you‚Äôre full of üí©. At least I have popcorn. I knew you‚Äôd do this today.  üòÇ
I‚Äôm still voting Biden lol
Just curious  why I got a push notification about the BIG10 postponing fall sports but not Harris being selected as Biden's #VEEP?
I‚Äôm still voting for Biden, but picking Kamala Harris, a know nothing on foreign affairs in an era where the US needs to rebuild trust with other nations at a crucial axis following Trump, is uninspiring to say the least.
all things i already know, disagree with, and will have 0 impact on my voting for biden/harris over trump/pence. as SF DA she also refused to seek the death penalty against a cop killer when feinstein publicly pushed for it, pushed back against 3 strikes. it's just not that meaty
biden and harris looking at us poors like
Having a strong VP candidate helps Biden. He did well, I think. #BidenHarris2020
Like it matters VP debates never matter.  Mark my words: Biden will not debate due to his obvious dementia.
&amp; Now we have Biden who really picked Kamala Harris ... WE DO NOT WANT HER. Omg pls 2020 do better
One has to wonder if the Democrats aren't trying to lose.  Biden is clearly suffering some level of dementia, and Harris isn't going to pull any votes.
warren used to be a corporate lawyer. i am pretty progressive but in the research i did on harris during the primaries there wasn't anything really meaty in her history to really turn off progressives. if you were ready to turn your nose up and vote biden this didn't change that
One has to wonder if the Democrats are actually TRYING to lose.  Biden is clearly suffering some level of dementia, and Kamala the Ugandan Giant isn't going to pull in any votes.
Biden picked Harris as VP üòÉ
One has to wonder if the Democrats are actually TRYING to lose.  Biden is clearly suffering some level of dementia, and Kamala the Ugandan Giant isn't going to pull in ant votes.
So, on the 11th day of August, Biden climbed out of his basement, saw his shadow, and gave of four more years of t–Øump.
Hooray for America! Hooray for Joe Biden. Hooray for Kamala Harris! Hooray for women! Hooray for Asians and blacks . Hooray for America. There is Hope!
This is the first election of my lifetime (Trump is the 10th President since I was born) in which the Democratic VP nominee matters.  Biden is quite obviously suffering from some level of dementia, so at some point he'll become incapable of carrying out his duties.
Congrats to Maya for being chosen as Biden's SNL running mate.
Biden/Squirrels 2020!
So the options are Trump or Biden and a cop..
It‚Äôs a fantastic selection. She is a formidable leader, candidate, and person.  Well done by Biden and his staff. They hit it out of the park!
Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Again, don't care about politics all that much.   Biden at the debates is going to be more important than this announcment
Great pick.  Biden made herstory today.  On to victory!
Seeing the news about biden.  Still waiting to see him just fall flat once Trump pulls out all the stuff before the first debate.

"No president -- whether named Obama or Trump or Biden or AOC -- has unilateral power to rewrite immigration law or to cut taxes or to raise taxes," Sen. Ben Sasse tells President Trump on Twitter.
I find everything about Joe Biden &amp; his corporate-funded trainwreck of a campaign despicable. However, people's need for healthcare is more important than my own principles. If  &amp;  get fully on board with M4A, they have my vote. That's where I #DrawTheLine
It's so sad that this is undeniably the case. We cannot enable this blatant cronyism and abuse of the working class by voting for Biden UNLESS his campaign and  make #M4AllNow a top policy priority.
Guessing that Biden will pick Harris!
No, I can't stand Bernie. I think he's soft and would've eventually bowed and had a plan similar to Biden as president. I preferred Warren out of the people who ran, but my platform and beliefs have not been represented by a presidential candidate.
If y'all are Biden's running mate I am OUT.
First off, I'm white.  Second off, democrats are trash too. Joe Biden isn't going to do anything that is gong to actually bring about positive change systemically. Dems like Hillary, Biden, Obama are still right of center with their economic policies. That is not the way forward.

How does increased spending mean increased taxes? Trump spent $800 billion on the military and CUT taxes for the wealthy.  Low inflation means Biden SHOULD be spending lots of money. Boost the economy and provide for the working class.

It's always good to hear these stories on Twitter of Trump voters that come to their senses and avoid #Cult45. I suspect a lot of folks are trumpists bc of peer pressure. Hopefully, when they're alone in the voting booth they'll do the right thing: reject Trump and vote Biden.

Did you read what he said? Biden had good intentions in his words...like every other democratic politician...they have good intentions. Yet they fail to act! And even when a democratic politician makes a racist comment... your mind is to clouded by the media to see it.

I didn‚Äôt vote for president in 2016. Not going to again this year. I think both have cognitive issues. I think Biden wins in a landslide but might not make it through first term or if he does will only serve one term so VP pick is really important.

I'll be voting for Biden in a dream state.
God when he sees Joe Biden leading the polls
Let‚Äôs face it. To support Trump and the personal attacks he levels on 60% of the country, and directly on Joe Biden, you have to be shameless.
A. Your entire politics is centered around opposition of one man, Trump, who employs childish name-calling tactics regularly. Yet you employ those same tactics. Why is that?  B. I am not privy to this "reframing" of Biden's. But I'm sure it was articulate &amp; poignant. Fill me in??
Now that so many of us who didn't know before have tasted the poison all too well, we need to completely drain the supply. And we can't do that by letting the DNC win with Biden. So yes 4 more years of that rancid Trump poison taste is worth it if we can start afresh in 2024.
The water's already poisoned beyond fixing. Has been since the very beginning, under Republican and Dem alike. We need to drain the supply completely &amp; rebuild the entire infrastructure. Electing Biden is like masking the taste of the poison whereas under Trump it's revolting.
It's my position that telling the DNC to go fuck itself instead of voting for Biden - who wrote the '94 crime bill and represents corporate cronyism and demonization of the black community just as Trump does - will lead us to brighter years ahead while giving into Biden does not
That's how Trump perceives Ohio folks as out of touch, hill billies that know nothing about Joe Biden. But Ohio seems to respond to Trump's snake oil pitch.
......than 4 years of no fundamental change under Biden (and no accountability for the DNC's blatant disregard for the working class and BIPOC) followed by a GOP resurgency in 2024
Because of the DNC's choice to coalesce against Bernie and force Biden down the electorate's throat, we are stuck with either 4 more years of Trump (and a chance to nominate an actual progressive in 2024) or 4 years of "nothing will fundamentally change" and a likely GOP 2024 win

So? Biden couldn't finish a sentence using the word Thailand, or anything else...
Are you daft? Biden could pick my dog as VP &amp; it would still be a better ticket than the one headed by Trump.
You mean the Biden campaign? Wish I fucking could, Jack.
Like if your position is "I'm fully committed to voting for Biden" and simultaneously "he shouldn't talk to the media or on camera ever"...  what in the FUCK are you doing? Do you have any idea what kind of statement you're making and what kind of precedent you're setting here?
I'll argue the opposite. Put both Biden and Trump under floodlights between now &amp; Election Day, refusing to shut up about how they are slaps in the faces of the working class &amp; BIPOC. Generate shockingly low R/D turnout (&amp; high Green turnout) thereby forcing the DNC's hand in '24
Let‚Äôs just call it and let Joe Biden take over now!
You heard what Biden said about Black people today? Or you just don't care?
Well, Biden has my vote!
Fear? It is a staple of Trumps campaign. It is apparently the primary strategy for most GOP- fear that everyone who might vote Biden are radical socialist leftists bent on rioting. Talk about the silent majority- it is people who want competence and ethics in government again.
Meh.  We have a few...  less than human...  politicians anymore, but Biden isn't one of them.  Regular humans tend to struggle with the hurting gods thing.

Biden's campaign is actually worse because his only argument is "I'm not Trump" and that's not even true. Trump and Biden are both racist Republican sexual predators, there's no difference between the two.
Joe's exactly like you, what do you expect? Both Hillary and Biden are deeply unpopular among their own voters, so that's not really different
Have to also credit the Biden people for obfuscating the search just enough to make Harris seem like a surprise pick as well.
There's no path to victory for Biden. Even without GOP shenanigans, he'd still lose. Hell, Biden couldn't win the nomination without DNC shenanigans. The progressive votes Biden needs to win are gone to Howie Hawkins (I know, I'm one of many)
What did your model show for 2016? Did you have Trump beating Clinton? If you did, which I‚Äôm sure you didn‚Äôt, I‚Äôll believe Biden wins
I think women in this country, no matter their political affiliation, should be pleased with Harris being selected as Biden's running mate. It is cool that an articulate and smart woman has worked hard to place herself in such a position. Awesome.
The Undertold, Undersold Story of Kamala Harris

hey Donald Trump you make the statement on national news that Joe Biden don't have a clue as what you said you as well don't have a clue of what's going on in the world you are the biggest liar and the biggest idiot that we've ever had for a president
And voting for Biden because you don‚Äôt want Trump to ease the overt white supremacy (I‚Äôm saying overt because the democrats and especially Biden are not off the hook) is a good and sound choice, and you can do either and not be a bad person.
I hate that the only opinions I see are either, if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden to get rid of trump, you‚Äôre evil, or vice versa. There is nothing wrong with treating the vote as a choice for something you want, not what you want less. It doesn‚Äôt make you bad.

Democratic House candidate Kara Eastman, who received Harris‚Äô endorsement in recent weeks for her bid against Republican Rep. Don Bacon, said Biden‚Äôs pick inspired her.
Right Biden has been in government for nearly 50 years and has not done a thing - so lets hear him tell us what he has done and why his kid got all that money from Ukraine and China....This will be fun!
I bet his Depends were full when he heard Biden named Harris VP.
Has she thrown black people in Jail for smoking Marijuana?  You bet!! Did she claim collusion knowing it was a lie!!  You bet! Say you believed Biden accusers that the were secually assaulted by him?  Yes she did! Tried to destroy justice Kavanaugh with lies!! Yes
The 55-year-old former prosecutor will have to put her animated public style ‚Äì often a contrast to the folksier 77-year-old Biden ‚Äì to use in television and online streaming formats without voter interaction or feedback.
We need leadership and joe biden and  kamala Harris will bring that they are ready on day one! #BidenHarris2020
she grabbed any guys balls? she busted them ask Joe Has she mocked a disabled person? More than likely Has she mocked war heroes ?Just supreme court justices!! Has she been friends with Epstein?just Hillary/Bill Has she put children in interment camps? No obama/ biden did however
can someone do Biden next üò©
This idea that fellow D‚Äôs can‚Äôt criticize Biden/Harris for their past and present stems from Dems not learning from the 2016 election. It wasn‚Äôt lefties fault that Hillary lost. She was a bad candidate. I‚Äôm not going to fall in line because people can‚Äôt take responsibility.

So Obama-Biden had a Catholic on it but Biden-Harris doesn‚Äôt? Hmm, not sure how that‚Äôs possible.

Video shows Joe Biden asking Kamala Harris to be vice presidential running mate
I feel the argument but her and Biden are running against DONALD TRUMP...
Just ordered my Biden-Harris t-shirt.
My theory is they made Biden the candidate because the others (Mayor Pete, Crazy Bernie, Klobuchar) wouldn't have gone along so willingly.
Yeah, Trump needs a foil desperately, and Biden isn‚Äôt providing it. His biggest asset in 2016 was the righteous cause of keeping Hillary Clinton out of the White House. I stayed neutral back then because I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of helping her, and I don‚Äôt think I was alone.
When do they get rid of Biden, before or after the election?
IMO at this point there are only two things that can save Trump:  1. Disastrous debate performances by Biden. Like, Trump gives him an impromptu dementia test and he can‚Äôt remember what day it is.   2. Mail in ballots are rejected at vastly higher rates than in person ballots.
My thoughts exactly! Dems need  ticket worth cheating for &amp; Biden-Harris isn't it.
Never said it did. But it‚Äôs BS with Biden- that video doesn‚Äôt mean shit. Propaganda that‚Äôs all.
You mean the Democrats. Biden has dementia and now his vp believed his accusers and basically called him a racist just 5 months back. Communism didn‚Äôt let anyone speak out against anything with the government (see China, N. Korea) and if they did would be imprisoned. #Facts
It looked like pure instinct on Karine‚Äôs part. These are two strong, dedicated  and courageous women who will serve Joe Biden well. I am so excited about this ticket.
Team Biden/Harris response to criticism...
Biden is so far out of touch with reality, he doesn‚Äôt know anything about what is going on.
All of the things listed make her the ideal match for Biden. Biden is so far over the hill and out of touch, he is not aware of anything.
Just for that I will personally remind you everyday that Biden chose Kamala Harris until November 4th with this picture...how about that?

You can be critical of our democratic ballot and still plan to vote for them. I will 100% be voting Biden/Harris 2020 but I will not stop speaking out about the issues involving them.
I first would like to preface this teeet with letting y‚Äôall know I understand why people don‚Äôt like Biden and Harris. I truly do.   That being said, if you are someone who would rather not vote than to vote for them can you please explain why?

The same poo flinging that Harris did to Biden.  Pence will likely point that out.

This is a win for all of us. We have a pair that can truly take on the task of restoring the soul of America. Congratulations Senator Harris and Vice President Biden.
Nope!! His daughter!! Geez people!! He‚Äôs not a Biden! AKA- sniffy-joe!!
yeah the biden/harris ticket is MUCH better than trump/pence but deep down i am crying because i wish it were sanders/warren

Hey  why do you fact check anything. Biden/Harris are running for the White House. The Dems lie to us every time they run, and we are used to it. So don‚Äôt waist your time. And if you wanna gamble with your 230 protections,keep messing with Republicans, Trump will end you!
If I had a dog, she would be voting for Biden/Harris!
There have been protests about police brutality for MONTHS, and Biden chose a fucking cop.  Your argument is blown to bits.
Senator Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick!    This  is thrilled to see a Black woman (and former CJS professional) on the democratic presidential ticket. A Madam VP on the 100th anniversary of the women's vote: FABULOUS! Madam President 2024?!
Kamala Harris was by far the best choice for Vice President Joe Biden could make. He gets  A + for judgement on his first big decision of the campaign.

If Biden/Harris win, maybe when can get a non Goldman Sachs Treasury Secretary.
Laughable headline.  She didn‚Äôt cut it the first time when she ran for President.  She sure as hell isnt going to entice people the second time.  Kamala isn‚Äôt likeable and that‚Äôs the truth.  Biden campaign errored with this pick.
I‚Äôm looking forward to the debates. This isn‚Äôt going to be as bad as Clinton/Kaine.   If the moderators are sort their salt they‚Äôll bring up criminal justice. Trump &amp; Pence haven‚Äôt a leg to stand. Biden &amp; Harris will have to explain their record and hopefully see religion on‚Ä¶
Kinda hard to want to vote for Biden when he chooses a TERF for a running mate, calls for the prosecution of activists, opposes universal healthcare, and literally tells people not to vote for him.
Trump surprised Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate
Can‚Äôt believe I had to log onto twitter after work and find out Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate.....
Kamala Harris, Biden's V.P. Pick, Is First Woman of Color on Major Party Ticket
I‚Äôd like to wish a sincere good luck to Kamala Harris as she will undoubtedly carry Biden‚Äôs entire campaign from here until Election Day.   Prediction: more than one Vice Presidential debate
Trump‚Äôs weak framing of her as a phony kind of illustrates the truth of this.   Trump desperately needs a foil to saddle this unrest with. Were Bernie or even Warren the nominee, he‚Äôd be tearing them apart over it. But Biden has refused to take the bait, including here.
He sounded like Joe Biden when he's not reading a script several words some of which made sense but nothing to do with what was asked
I‚Äôm happy to see Kamala added to the ticket. No I don‚Äôt agree with her on everything. But Trump needs to go and every time Biden opens his mouth I cringe. I have way more faith in black women, whether I agree with everything they stand for or not. #BidenHarris
Don‚Äôt tell  but I think the hubs (former military, rancher from South Dakota) is warming to the idea of  It‚Äôs one vote, but it shows that people recognize the decency of #BidenHarris2020. So, with my dad, stepmom, and hubby, Trump‚Äôs lost 3 R‚Äôs in Nebraska.
Biden/Kamala is a more traditionally republican ticket than what the GOP is running lmao
And good for Biden to pick someone who will have open honest conversations with him. Not a bunch of .... well no words to describe the group of spineless GOP supporting this Tyrunt Trump.
Biden died last year its all good
So you're admitting Biden will be President in name only.
I can‚Äôt wait to watch! Harris &amp; Biden= Trump win.
Biden couldn't have picked a worse running mate.
Biden/Harris 2020 That‚Äôs The Ticket. #AnybodyButTrump
I was so hoping Biden would pick a woman with a law degree to help clean up the legal nightmare Trump's going to leave behind.

I remember the history books the unaltered ome atleast painting  biden as not a fighter for all people but just white people and your not loved by anyone bit the anyone bit trump party so i doubt itll jnify

Harris doesn‚Äôt help him in battle ground states and she is absolitely polarizing in a time when we really need unity.  She has a very shady background and her own state has become a dumpster fire.  She will get eaten alive.  Biden handed Trump 4 more years on a platter today.
Did you hear Biden picked his running mate?  Kamala. Just like the olive. Isn‚Äôt that the name of an olive?  Kamala olive.
It‚Äôs obvious that if Biden wins, it‚Äôs going to be Weekend at Bernie‚Äôs with Harris and the Clintons calling the shots. A Biden/Harris ticket won‚Äôt motivate people to vote.   Clinton barely lost in 16 because of low Democrat turnout. This ticket is even worse IMO.
1.)Tulsi Gabbard - hands down. But she won‚Äôt be a DNC soldier, so party kicked her to curb.   Not worried about Biden‚Äôs age, it‚Äôs his Alzheimer‚Äôs. Everyone knows he needs to be in nursing home, not Whote House. If you can‚Äôt leave your home to accept the nomination, you can‚Äôt win.
Well, at least I‚Äôll have something to be excited about voting for Biden. Congratulations  #KamalaHarrisForVP #KamalaHarris #KamalaHarrisVP #KamalaHarris2020
#BidenHarris2020 hilarious, Biden nominatrd one of the most unpopular, callous, Marxists in the country, so of course Biden picked a radical leftist as his VP &amp; likely Pres because we know Creepy Joe wont last one term before resigning. Trump's chances just improved dramatically!
I understand if you‚Äôre upset about the Kamala pick. Although I don‚Äôt understand the surprised reactions.  I‚Äôve seen too many, ‚ÄúYou mean to tell me Joe Biden didn‚Äôt appease leftists in his VP pick?  I was certain he would do that for the first time in his whole political career.‚Äù
She is "of color" but not of African descent but she can't undo Biden's history.
What a ignorant comment, he looked at the situation and determined it was just not worth a comment, thing is Biden or Obama would not have had protection, secret service hated them!
Dafuq? This dude got BLM in his name but support Biden/Harris. Biden wrote the Crime Bill and Harris selectively enforced it against BIPOC.
Biden loves all women regardless of age
Its not tonsay we shouldn't fight the ideal fight, but rather, we have to understand where the actual battle lies. We lost the battle for Bernie, who is not blameless, but thats done and over forever. We now have 2 choices and only 2 choices. Choose Biden.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ We shall see.  My vote is on the prosecutor.  The same one that made Bill Barr cry.  The Elf on the Shelf may get dumped by Trump prior to the debates anyway.
But but but she's not black. She's indian/Jamaican and I don't think either thinks their black. Someone should have told Biden. When she ran for Senator she portrayed herself as Indian.
Sorry. You may want to address your obvious cognitive dissonance, Biden isn‚Äôt a progressive and if you claim to be but support him, you‚Äôre not a progressive either.  Free yourself from the shackles of your lies.

What will make Trump‚Äôs legacy infinitely worse is if we refuse to apply fair scrutiny to politicians‚Äô records, particularly Dems, because we fear pointing out their shortcomings.  Trump‚Äôs impact, in that case, is that he continually lowers the bar for ALL politicians (see Biden).
Did Biden do anything to actually help her win this primary? Or did he support her AIPAC challenger?
Joe Biden I honestly believe that you pick the right partner for your running mate Kamala Harris is a very smart very well spoken and a terrific woman you've got my vote from Omaha Nebraska
I told y'all who Biden was choosing as his running mate.
I am surprised Hide'n Biden didn't pick Where's Hunter. In hopes of saving them from the wrath of AG Barr. They are both are under investigation in Ukraine for Corruption. Fact checkers cant say this is bogus, its FACTS! There are no longer Democrats now their is "Corrupt Party"
I'm thrilled Joe Biden has made history by choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate. Senator Harris is a talented, pragmatic leader with a strong record of holding elected officials accountable, fighting corruption, and advocating for the most vulnerable Americans. Let's go!
Joe Biden so desperately wants to loose this election I swear to god
If Biden is elected, Don will vote against every Democrat policy, the same way that he's voted against every bill they've brought up this session, and he'll have the same bad reason to vote against it, even if he "agrees with the idea".

Democrats needed to get on board with this a long time ago though. They left Biden out on an island and he‚Äôs got an uphill battle. Got too greedy.
You need to grow up, you think any of us care about this? Kamala called Biden a racist not to long ago and she locked minorities up for weed charges!

Of course, Biden won‚Äôt do shit for us no matter what color you are. He will ruin America. Talking about taking guns away when it‚Äôs our right. He can‚Äôt even talk straight to even be able to address the nation if he had to
Hey Big Mouth Donald Trump why don't you say something about Joe Biden and his running mate now that woman to put you in your place she'll tell you what a loser you are
Remember if you vote democrat this is who you are voting for president:
I think if Biden can tap into the progressive part of the left, he'll win. A lot of progressives voted third party in both last election and even tho Hillary won popular vote it hurt her in blue states and swing states. Biden needs to bring those aggrieved progressives back.
And, god-willing, once Biden/Harris convincingly win the election, we can pressure them to add strong progressive voices to the Cabinet. We can demand progressive ideas.  We're not going to go back to the way things were pre-Trump. We're going to fucking fix everything.
Yay for #Kamala and #Biden. #ChangeIsHappening!
I get why Biden picked Harris but Jesus Christ I wish he hadn‚Äôt
She‚Äôs definitely not a perfect pick. Neither is Biden.
Remember what Biden you ain‚Äôt black if u don‚Äôt vote for him
No we don't. Biden used Warren. You must not truly understand the #WarrenDemocrat. The majority of us will vote the ticket, but we're definitely NOT happy about it.
Look, I know Biden wasn't a lot of people's first choice, and I know Kamala comes with a lot of baggage from her time as a DA, but this is it. This is what we have to work with in order to get that stupid motherfucker and his corrupt cronies out of the White House. #vote
Ima still vote Biden doe
Will  stand with  (who endorsed her) in calling out Joe Biden?
I complained about Biden even when I voted for Obama.

I still can‚Äôt believe it was joe Biden....
at least the debates (if they happen) will be entertaining. Pence nervously chugging water while waiting for Kamala‚Äôs applause breaks every few seconds as she denies needlessly locking people up. Biden trying to figure out where he is while Trump mispronounces words. AMERICA!
That it is! I would have loved a Biden/Harris ticket but that is not going to happen. There will be so much work to be done and Kamala is fierce and up to the task. What a formidable cast of candidates he vetted. All strong wonderfully experienced women.
Excited to vote #BidenHarris2020 but I hope the 2020s versions of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris listen to the people, continue to evolve (quickly) on criminal justice issues, and take serious, lasting action on healthcare and climate change.
Kamala Harris congratulations congratulations I am so happy that Joe Biden chose you for a running mate I think you would have made a great president but that may still happen my name is Richard French I'm from Omaha Nebraska

I'll vote for Biden regardless, but, man, I don't think it's possible for me to be less excited about it.
I always felt strongly for Kamala Harris but especially when Karine Jean-Pierre begin working for Biden‚Äòs campaign. She physically put herself in front of Kamala when she was attacked on stage, he has some tough black women around him!
Joe Biden choosing a cop to be his running mate in the year of "defund the police" is hella on-brand for 2020.

Biden had a chance to unite the party. Could have went with Brother Bernie and did not. Missed opportunity

BREAKING: Biden announces his VP pick -
We can do this!  biden harris 2020!
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, is also one of the party's most prominent figures and quickly became a top contender for the No. 2 spot after her own White House campaign ended
I was NOT expecting Kamala as Biden's running mate but THIS MAKES ME SOOOO HAPPY!
If Biden wins, then: If (when?) Joe Biden dies in office, Kamala Harris will become the president, right? But is that constitutional? Or will it go straight to Nancy Pelosi?
BREAKING: Biden picks Kamala Harris, his former 2020 rival, to be his vice presidential running mate #Biden2020 B

Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.

Biden + Harris time to conquer!!!
In choosing Harris, Biden is embracing a former rival from the Democratic primary who is familiar with the unique rigor of a national campaign.
Its funny if all the people who are excited for this would have actually voted for her she would be the nominee and have a much better chance at beating trump than Biden.

In a time when people are demanding that police departments around the country be defunded, Biden chooses a former cop as his VP.  Lmao
Joe Biden picked a poor time to leak his VP pick. . .
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate.
These Biden VP leaked calls are like that first Thursday of the NCAA tourney where seeds and falling left and right
Bad polling, and he can't talk about Trump or Biden or any specific policy, so this is literally all he has to campaign on.
It's almost a cop out, but yes. Biden now, then once we get this country's collective head out of its *** then we can move on getting a woman where a woman is long overdue.
The announcement is expected very shortly.
I just found out who Biden is picking and will tell the first person to reply to this tweet.
Correct. Trump will tweet that they have found the body of Jimmy Hoffa in Biden‚Äôs backyard, along side of D B Cooper.
When did AOC or Biden become potus?
Sometimes people misspeak. Just ask Joe Biden.
Naturally it‚Äôs what I expected you to use for ‚Äúproof‚Äù.- a ‚Äúsubscription based conservative political commentary website‚Äù covering the accusations but offering no evidence of what they claim. It‚Äôs as credible as Joe Biden is going to take away your windows.
So I think I would rather have Sarah Palin as a VP then Biden as president. Man can barely speak and I was hoping the DNC picked someone else. The Democrats are just as corrupt as the Republicans if not worse at this point
Ole Joe is just Biden his time before he has to answer for his corruption issues.
It should but this is what I'm afraid of. Nobody is pro-Biden but many are anti-Trump thus they'll vote against him by voting for Biden even though they don't like him.
No he is not........Biden has outright said he wants a black woman for VP.....and I am fine with that....but dont choose a VP because of skin color or gender.....choose by the persons ability.....no room for racism
It is funny to me that liberals actually think that sleepy, creepy Biden is going to save them. Nothing will fundamentally change. As Trump is not a conservative, he is is not a liberal. This is the duopoly we live in. #VoteGold2020
I hear you... my circle is the same way, but I live in Nebraska and trust me, I see the craziness... it's everywhere. Thankfully we split electoral votes and hoping Dist 2 comes to its senses and votes Biden, but the gerrymandering that happened after '08 is a lot to overcome.
Trump and his corrupt administration is the true problem.  Biden is honest and trustworthy. I put my faith in him.
Wait, is he campaigning for Biden now....  cuz, that's the point...
I will, but I'm taking crap from people today for defending Biden.

Just a hunch but I'm assuming that every member of Nickelback is going to announce that they're Biden's VP very soon
Hope that everyone understands that who ever Biden's VP pick is, they will end up becoming President, Biden wont last though one term if he wins, so who ever is the VP has to be someone the radical left knows will push their agenda when Dementia Joe resigns.
Biden seizes on Trump's attack on Social Security and Medicare, while team Trump panics
I wonder if they‚Äôll announce another slot for her on Wednesday - when/if she‚Äôs chosen - and then this Thursday slot will just be a lead-in to Biden‚Äôs big speech? Is that out of the realm of possibility? Maybe I‚Äôm just grasping at straws but üòÇ
I WILL vote Biden no matter who he picks for VP.
But Sleepy Joe is not lying,  By reason of a mental defect or disease, he does not know the difference between the truth and lies.  Six times Biden described major events in his life that never happened
Yes, I am told Biden will speak for 15 seconds so the Democratic Party can ensure he knows where he is.
Don‚Äôt worry, Biden will restore order soon enough.
The unusual format, with just eight hours of prime-time programming spread over four nights from Aug. 17-20, will test Biden's ability to project a cohesive message to a splintered electorate.

Which will come first? The announcement of Biden‚Äôs VP or The Big Ten decision on fall football?
Kind of dreading tomorrow, where Trump will have to be extra bombastic to steal the news cycle from Biden's VP choice (you know he will try)
She's not ready.  I like her a lot, but Michigan looks relatively safe for Biden right now.  They're going with a black woman, to ensure the black voters show up.  So yeah, I'll take that bet.  Save the nickname - you can give it to the republican trolls in Michigan.
Is Biden god?
It's normal for the president to say ‚ÄòYo Semites‚Äô and ‚ÄòYo Seminites,‚Äô ‚ÄòThigh Land,‚Äô ‚ÄòMinne-a-napolis,‚Äô ‚Äòtoe-tally-taria-tism,‚Äô ‚ÄòThomas Jeffers‚Äô and ‚ÄòUlyss-eus S. Grant.‚Äô but it‚Äôs Biden who‚Äôs cognitively impaired,‚Äù  ü§î

Yes, Biden was crappy on school busing, but Trump was blatantly keeping blacks out of his apartment building.  And when did Biden run a scam university or scam charity?  Do you honestly think Biden's response to the coronavirus would be this bad?
And so it starts, there isn‚Äôt even an announcement yet and here comes the rhetoric. I am voting Biden no matter who the VP is.
Moron Biden critizing travel ban.  He could barely read the prepared statement in January as he criticized the chins travel ban.   Brian Smelther do same on europe  Two fools
Biden has his stooges wiping out this tape.  Cant even google it.  Biden and CNN criticizing Trump in Jan for travel ban that saved lives   Biden would have killed 100‚Äôs of thousands of lives.
No. This is just your strained attempt to attack Trump. Admit you hate Trump and will vote for Biden.
Perfect candidate for Biden VP. Corrupt, criminal. Liar, anti-American  and plays well with other thugs.
When you say heading in the direction of Biden do you mean A) to Delaware? B) toward senility? C) downstairs? D) also named a person of interest in Ukraine       bribery scandal? E) to an ENT specialist for a nasal lavage to keep that sniffer in well working order?

I always wondered what it would be like to live in a country dominated by the progressive left; a communist state as it were.  If Biden gets elected I will get to find out.  What an adventure and here I thought I would have to move to Venezuela or Cuba .  ‚úäüí©
Wow a real life Warren supporter! I haven‚Äôt seen one of them in a couple months.   If Biden is all that stands between democracy and fascism I‚Äôm calling it. Democracy has failed. Pack it up and go back to the drawing board.
I honestly don‚Äôt know what he has going on. I only know that trump is the alternative and we badly need to hit reset. We are in the shit big time. Biden would be one and done. It‚Äôs worth it.
What does it say that Joe Biden agrees with Trump on the almost everything and has already alienated blacks and progressives and will probably lose to a rambling racist.
It will all be over in January if Biden wins the dems will come out and say we can open up the economy now it‚Äôs not as bad as we thought. It‚Äôs has 99% recovery rate we‚Äôll be ok.
Voting cant save us. Biden cant save us. We have to save ourselves.
So would I.  Biden/Harris is a winning, caring team.
Listen, I will support the Biden VP choice‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs too important not to. She will be amazing and powerful and qualified and it‚Äôs about fucking time. But Joe, if you don‚Äôt choose a Black Woman there *will* be a reckoning. We will primary you. Don‚Äôt mess this up.

Nope. Biden will last one day. Who ever Crazy Nancy, Crying Chuck and Pencil Neck Schiff pick for his VP will become president. That is why it is important to vote RED this November.
Frankly I like Warren, but she got to be exhausting on the campaign trail. Very urgent and negative tone maybe, Idk... and she‚Äôs older, the vitality of Kamala is the perfect counterpoint to Biden‚Äôs old azz.
Hey Dumpy Trumpy did you see Biden riding a bicycle this weekend that's what I wanna see you do. You can even walk down an incline without hilding somebody's hand!
Hey   still wanna talk about Biden's decline?  I think he might still have a grasp of history that eludes your old man.
But it‚Äôs not like we are going to get less government with Biden. The reality is it‚Äôll be more and probably much more. And that‚Äôs before we talk about the tax increases that are going to happpen. Sadly, elections anymore are ALWAYS going to be about choosing the lesser of 2 evils

The Epic Blandness of the Joe Biden Campaign  via
Ya - if you can't see the corruption of Biden and the Obama WH you are blinded. Trump has not come CLOSE to the Obama administration and the Clintons
In fact, what Joe Biden said was that all governors should issue a mask mandate.
He's so proud of his word play. Does he not realize that this is a Biden Harris campaign speech?
Angry - Biden wins, how much damage can üçä do between November 4 and the inauguration?
She called her self that when she scolded Biden about busing - the chickens come home to roost
The debate over masks has moved to the presidential race.
LIES???? HE has done more for this country in 3 years than Obama and Biden did in 8. None of his "lies" were substantive and I can guarantee you if the media scrutinized Obama like they do Trump Obama would win hands down.
Chuck Hagel will be supporting Joe Biden in this election.    Don Bacon votes in line with Trump 94% of the time and agrees with virtually EVERY part of Trump's agenda.    Very very different Republicans these men are. üëç
You said you can post a dozen videos of Biden being racist - let's see them.

Biden can't his shoes Kamala is constitutionally  ineligible  It's Trump vs. Pelosi They're going to pull their every dirty trick and then some.
There is a large portion of progressives who will refuse to vote for Biden. I want her to get out the vote to beat Trump. She knows there‚Äôs a fracture in the left, she could bring it together. She does not. Bernie does, but she‚Äôs a non-factor. It‚Äôs weak shit.
I am so sick of the lying deceitful mean spirited unprofessional press. I can't stand watching it. Shame Shame Shame. Let's see when someone piles on Biden how you all react. Disgraceful
I don‚Äôt care about the color of her skin or her family‚Äôs. I care about her qualifications and she is severely unqualified to be president. If elected I see Biden quitting do to health reasons.This all a sham to have our 1st female president be a woman of color.
Biden/Harris (resisted the urge to say HOJO, cause I used to live close to a Howard Johnsons) should concede now. Only way for the ticket to win is massive mail-in ballot cheating/harvesting. Need to see RECORD voting for  in Nov!
Oh sweet. I wasn‚Äôt planning to vote Biden but if it‚Äôs actually a vote to destroy America that‚Äôs very compelling. You have given me a lot to think about here.

Please find better arguments. At best, this showcases Biden‚Äôs authoritarianism
And voting for Biden because you don‚Äôt want Trump to ease the overt white supremacy (I‚Äôm saying overt because the democrats and especially Biden are not off the hook) is a good and sound choice, and you can do either and not be a bad person.
I hate that the only opinions I see are either, if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden to get rid of trump, you‚Äôre evil, or vice versa. There is nothing wrong with treating the vote as a choice for something you want, not what you want less. It doesn‚Äôt make you bad.
Mr.President. So I watched,Joe Biden's  announcement to K Harris. He had his phone upside down. My biggest fear, is that if Joe Biden wins he won't make it four years and them Kamala Harris is President. I think it's going to be another Reagan Landslide for you!  Good Luck! Sir..

Where is the science that wearing a mask, outside , in the fresh air, walking or otherwise saves lives?  There is non because it doesnt.  Biden is a moron who read this , barely, off a piece of paper he was given by his handlers. So feable he has no original thoughts.
I hope I can go canvassing for Biden soon. I want to do something soon for them this is a team we can me proud of #BidenHarris2020

Biden has a 25 point lead in New York according to the latest polls. This is Trump just saying shit. Because in fact, he's terrified and wants to pretend he's confident. Unfortunately.
Blame the people in charge. Blame the people who keep the two party system. Blame the people who make it impossible for your choice to matter. Make your choice matter. Because if Trump wins, you voting for Biden because you think he‚Äôs your only chance...
Don‚Äôt just vote Biden cause you won‚Äôt Trump our. Find a candidate you actually like, even if you know they can‚Äôt win. Vote for who you‚Äôd want. When either win, and things get even worse, don‚Äôt blame the common voter, or say that a third party or independent are spoilers
Biden's biggest weakness is among young voters. Why not use the convention to help fix that?

If someone can convince me Biden &amp; Harris's policies and actions throughout the years, haven't had a worse effect on black men compared to Trump's admin than I might vote for them. If not then MAGA all the way.
Kamala has done more public speaking in 2 days than Biden in 2 months. Why?  #BidenHarris2020
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
You deserved that call,I believe she called you one other time as well. You are her number one fan and that was a personable thing for her to do. I hope she will be in the Biden administration!

I think a Biden-Harris ticket has great potential. If voted into office, I will watch how they address funding for the military-intelligence establishment, tax cuts going to corporate America and the 5%, the ongoing saga of Palestine, and Social Security and Medicare funding.

It was the Obama administration that caused all the issues we have now. The Democrats now stand behind open racist such as Biden, and a woman whose family were slave owners, Just more of the pro racism shown by Democrats.
